<h1>Chapter 1304: The Corpse Formation</h1><p>“Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master were bought off by the Withering Yuan Pill.”</p><p>Zhen Daozhang recalled the past.</p><p>Bribing a Yuan Ying cultivator is no easy feat; the conditions that could tempt a Yuan Ying are few and far between.</p><p>Qu Huan was his own secret agent planted in the Abyss of Sin, and even after achieving Yuan Ying stage, he was beyond control.  If not for the recent upheaval in the Abyss of Sin, he probably wouldn't have become an inside man.</p><p>After learning the inside story, the others looked at the Withering Yuan Pill with less fervor and more apprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest also waned significantly.</p><p>The consequence of consuming the Withering Yuan Pill is the decline of one's spirit, energy, and essence. The Jade Buddha can only protect the primordial spirit.  Once the hidden dangers manifest, the cultivator's cultivation will fall, making it a losing proposition.</p><p>Qu Huan generously gave this Withering Yuan Pill to Zhen Daozhang.</p><p>After learning the inside story, the morale of the group soared.</p><p>Following the original plan, trapping the Abyss of Sin in Yu City and engaging in a standoff was already the best outcome. Now that the situation has taken a new turn, they certainly wouldn't be content with that.</p><p>As the saying goes, strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin’s current plight is entirely self-inflicted.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, you've all heard that the Abyss of Sin is in chaos and has suffered heavy losses. This is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. I urge you all to hold nothing back and make a full-scale assault on the protective city array!”</p><p>Zhen Daozhang shouted.</p><p>This time, the cultivators from Xiao Han domain offered no objection.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord said, “The main force is on its way. Even if we can't break the array, we can still contain them and prevent them from repairing any breaches. However, it is said that the inner city array was left behind by the ancestors of the Abyss of Sin and has never been broken.  Getting into the inner city will probably not be so easy, and we need to plan accordingly…”</p><p>As they spoke, everyone joined forces to break through more than a dozen ancient restrictions.</p><p>Even outside the protective city array, it could be seen that within the lotus formation, one of the lotus petals was a murky gray, a chaotic region where a hurricane seemed to rage, with constant roaring sounds.</p><p>Yu City trembled, and the lotus formation dimmed.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and the others suddenly felt a tightening sensation, and then discovered that the scenery in their vision had changed dramatically, as they had been forcibly relocated.</p><p>Reinforcements arrived, assisting the Qi cultivator, forcibly separating Qin Sang and the others to slow down the progress of breaking the array.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ebony sword transformed into a beam of sword light to protect him.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, but saw no one else. It seemed he had been deliberately targeted.</p><p>However, Qin Sang showed no sign of worry. Qu Huan had already told them about all the changes in the protective city array. The Abyss of Sin was merely making a last-ditch stand.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Abyss of Sin entered the array to block the enemy.</p><p>…</p><p>Blue sky and white clouds.</p><p>Flowers bloomed in profusion, with fragrant breezes caressing the nose.</p><p>The scenery here was completely out of sync with the outside world.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he had fallen into a certain space within the array. After a few breaths, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly spotted the flaws in the illusory scene, but Qin Sang did not act rashly.</p><p>‘Hm?’</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to sense something, his gaze suddenly hardening. He tapped his foot and soared into the air.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The earth and rocks tumbled, and streams of black energy gushed out from the ground.  Wherever the black energy touched, the flowers withered and died, and the beautiful scenery was instantly destroyed.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The black energy surged, and a cold wind howled, as if countless evil ghosts were wailing.</p><p>Then, one withered hand after another clawed open the ground, climbing out from beneath.  They were corpses, countless corpses.</p><p>‘Heh heh!’</p><p>These corpses emitted incomprehensible sounds from their mouths, raising their heads abruptly. Their pitch-black eyes stared at Qin Sang in unison, creating a bizarre and chilling scene.</p><p>“We have long heard of Qin Daoist’s extraordinary abilities. Today, we finally have the opportunity to witness them firsthand.”</p><p>All the corpses spoke in unison, emitting identical voices.  Clearly, someone was controlling them from behind.</p><p>“Corpse formation?”</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recalled someone, “Are you the renowned Judge?”</p><p>While searching for the Sky Corpse Sect and Tan Hao, Qin Sang had thoroughly investigated the cultivators in the Abyss of Sin who practiced necromancy, and learned of a demon cultivator called the ‘Judge,’ who was skilled in the art of corpse manipulation.</p><p>However, his corpse manipulation differed from that of the Sky Corpse Sect; he didn't focus on strengthening a single corpse but used them to create a corpse formation, which was quite unique.</p><p>It was said that as long as one was within the corpse formation, the Judge could remain invincible, making him very difficult to deal with. Qin Sang examined carefully and indeed found that every corpse was linked by their Qi, forming a certain formation.</p><p>“I wouldn't dare claim such a title! This little bit of fame probably wouldn't catch Qin Daoist’s eye…”</p><p>The corpses laughed wildly.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze across the corpses, unable to discern where the Judge’s true body was hidden.</p><p>Perhaps, every corpse was the true body.</p><p>"Don't bother searching; none of these are his true form. He's using a soul-transferring technique, lodging his spirit in a corpse and shifting between them within the corpse array.  It's impossible to tell which corpse holds his main spirit from outward appearances. Your divine eye ability is specifically countered, clearly he was sent to stop you." Bai transmitted secretly.</p><p>Being a corpse himself, he recognized the intricacies of the array.</p><p>"Bai, can you locate his main spirit?" Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he communicated with Bai privately.</p><p>"By observing the changes in the corpse array, we should find a clue.  Engage him while I look for an opportunity to strike," Bai replied.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, ceasing his conversation with the opponent. He raised a hand, pointing towards the array.</p><p>His ebony sword whistled through the air.</p><p>Instantly, sword light rained down, covering the corpse array and forming the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>The corpses' laughter abruptly ceased, replaced by a piercing shriek.  All the corpses moved, transforming into dark shadows.</p><p>Their movements seemed erratic, but as they continued, their speed increased, eventually merging into one, with corpse energy surging skyward.  The full power of the array was unleashed.</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to use the Seven Souls Killing Array's influence on the spirit to pinpoint the Judge's main spirit, but the results were poor.  His main spirit indeed moved freely.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang altered his formation.</p><p>In an instant, the sword array became deadly, the sword light chilling, radiating intense killing intent!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The two arrays clashed. Qin Sang had the upper hand, detecting a weakness in the corpse array and directing countless sword lights toward one corpse.</p><p>The Judge was alerted.</p><p>Within the array, other corpses began forming strange hand seals, striking the targeted corpse from the air. The power of the array converged, and the corpse's energy exploded, its body instantaneously enveloped in a black armor formed of corpse energy.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>But the Judge was a fraction of a second too slow.  The corpse's armor had just formed when the sword light arrived, shattering the armor and shredding the corpse.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The corpse fell backward, shattering into countless pieces.</p><p>Unexpectedly, another corpse crawled out from the ground the next moment, the array remaining intact.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled but acted without hesitation, attacking with his sword.</p><p>As time passed, more corpses were destroyed by the sword array, but the array remained unbroken.  The Judge's corpses were seemingly inexhaustible; each loss was instantly replaced.</p><p>The Three Realms War had lasted so long; corpses were plentiful.  It was unknown just how many corpses the Judge had cultivated, it seemed as though they were endless.</p>
