<h1>Chapter 1624: First Mover Advantage</h1><p>Tenglong Cliff.</p><p>The ritual altar and the five Phase Tokens shone brilliantly.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Phase Tokens were unstable, giving the illusion that they might be flung away at any moment.</p><p>The altar itself trembled incessantly.  While the tremors appeared small, they carried a shocking force.</p><p>The five individuals rotated with the altar, their palms pressed against its edge, enduring the immense vibrations emanating from it, not daring to move an inch.</p><p>Even with their world-class cultivation, the continuous reverberations from the altar began to overwhelm them. The risk of losing their grip, or even being injured by the tremors, grew with each passing moment.</p><p>This was where the differences in their inheritances became apparent.</p><p>Su Zinan and the Sword-Bearer were not disciples of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>A blood talisman flew out of Su Zinan's Mustard Seed Bag, exploding with a ‘bang’ and revealing a blood-red specter. The specter's features were twisted, and it emitted an agonizing shriek that unsettled the minds of all who heard it. It was clearly an evil artifact.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blood specter turned and lunged at Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't flinch or dodge. He merged with the specter, his face momentarily flushed with crimson before returning to normal.  His aura surged, and the trembling in his arms subsided greatly as he pressed firmly against the altar.</p><p>The Sword-Bearer lowered his head slightly, silently invoking a blade mantra.</p><p>The heavy sword on his back shuddered, emitting a dragon-like hum before abruptly leaving its sheath.</p><p>‘Weng!’</p><p>The sword hung in the air.</p><p>Yet, it was blade energy that soared to the heavens!</p><p>The blade itself was invisible, replaced by a dazzling blade light, like a crescent moon, flashing towards the space between the Sword-Bearer's hands.</p><p>The tip of the blade pressed soundlessly against the altar, sharing the burden of the reverberations with its master.</p><p>The remaining three individuals all had some connection to the Formless Immortal Sect, to varying degrees.</p><p>The white-robed figure's robe billowed.</p><p>It turned out that the robe wasn't purely white. Complex patterns now appeared, and within the robe seemed to exist a small world filled with swirling snow.</p><p>Visible gusts of pale, frigid wind surged out, swirling around the white-robed figure and intensifying with each rotation.</p><p>The cold air accumulated behind the figure, gradually forming an ice mirror.</p><p>The mirror hovered behind the figure's head, its surface facing the altar, reflecting a shimmering, cold light.</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man trembled slightly.</p><p>Starting from his shoulders, his arms lignified, transforming into two sections of withered wood.  His fingers, dry and gnarled like branches, gripped the altar tightly, ensuring an unyielding hold.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was the mastermind, but Su Zinan had yet to witness him make a move.  Through the radiance of the Phase Tokens, Su Zinan discreetly observed Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Wudao simply transformed his eyes into a pale gold color, projecting a tangible gaze toward the altar. He made no other movements. It was unclear what demonic art he was employing, yet he maintained his position with apparent ease.</p><p>He appeared the most relaxed of the five.</p><p>Working together, they stabilized the altar, then simultaneously looked upwards.</p><p>Five beams of colored light shot out from the Phase Tokens.</p><p>In the center of these beams, a white light, now much larger than before, formed a sphere the size of a human head. Strange fluctuations within it intensified.</p><p>These fluctuations were the source of the tremors.</p><p>Waves of light churned within the sphere, each surge bringing a powerful tremor.</p><p>This tremor not only affected the altar but the entire space, shaking the earth and causing the peaks of Mount Taiyue to tremble, sending rocks tumbling down.</p><p>On the main peak.</p><p>Both sides ceased fighting, their attention captivated by the six pillars of light rising skyward.</p><p>Gold, Azure, Blue, Crimson, Yellow!</p><p>The five colored beams were nearly identical in size, encircling the white beam. Initially, the white beam was smaller than the others, but as the vibrations intensified, the white light grew increasingly radiant, threatening to surpass them.</p><p>Under the influence of the tremors, the main peak shook the most violently.  Lower-ranked disciples found themselves forced to circulate their cultivation techniques just to maintain their balance, their faces etched with awe and fear.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Someone shouted, pointing at the sphere of light.</p><p>Hua Chenzi rebuked, “Focus on recovering your energy!”</p><p>The disciples sobered, remembering their predicament.  Survival was paramount. The invaders' relentless attacks had exhausted them. They quickly cast aside their distractions and began to recuperate.</p><p>The pillars of light shot into the black canopy of the sky.</p><p>Within the canopy, dark clouds converged, locking onto the beams of light.</p><p>Otherwise, the spectacle would be visible for hundreds of miles. The Formless Immortal Sect's reemergence would spread with astonishing speed, alerting various factions prematurely.</p><p>Several hours later, the five colored beams stabilized, while the white beam continued to expand.</p><p>The sphere gradually swelled, its interior resembling a deep passage. Within the passage, chaos reigned. Multicolored rays of light twisted and collided, filled with primordial power.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>These rays of light, their origins unknown, clashed and exploded continuously.</p><p>The power of the spirit arrays and restrictions reached a frenzied peak, even interspersed with spatial turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others, mere inches from the sphere, observed the scene within, their expressions grave. If they were drawn inside at this moment, even they couldn't guarantee their safe return.</p><p>“Must we enter the Formless Immortal Sect through this?”</p><p>Su Zinan's brow furrowed, sensing danger.</p><p>“When the chaos erupted in the past, our ancestors were caught unprepared. They forcibly sealed the Formless Immortal Sect, causing spatial distortions and triggering this chaos. We have no other choice but to force our way through. But don’t worry, everyone.  Once the passage stabilizes and the Immortal Abode emerges, there will be room to maneuver.”</p><p>As Zhu Wudao spoke, he glanced upwards, confirming that the phenomenon was contained by the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation, and nodded to himself.</p><p>Although the spectacle was concealed, the fluctuations from the Formless Immortal Sect's emergence grew increasingly violent, and the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation began to falter, transmitting the tremors beyond Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Some time after the passage opened.</p><p>On a distant mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuations and awoke from his meditative trance.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>He waved his sleeve, retrieving the Sun God Tree, and rushed out of his cave, concealing his presence. He stopped at a distance from Mount Taiyue.</p><p>From his vantage point.</p><p>Everything at Mount Taiyue appeared normal.</p><p>But Qin Sang was certain this was a facade. A dramatic change had occurred within!</p><p>“Sealing off an entire top-tier sect, what a grand undertaking!”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.  Wary of any countermeasures within the formation that might detect his probing, he refrained from using his Sky-Eye Butterfly, choosing instead to observe patiently.</p><p>Concealed in the shadows, he searched the surrounding area, but found no trace of True Person Zi Lei.  He wasn't sure whether Ghost Mother's judgment was correct, but caution was always prudent.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>The sphere was gone.</p><p>Over those two days, the sphere had slowly risen, the power within the passage becoming more manifest.  Above Mount Taiyue, a spatial vortex had materialized.</p><p>The vortex was now large enough to encompass half of Mount Taiyue.  Its terrifying power threatened to annihilate everything in its path, exuding a palpable, dreadful pressure.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A deafening thunderclap echoed, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>Everyone looked up in alarm, witnessing the moment the passage connected with the black canopy, its turbulent edges colliding with the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>Turbulence filled the sky, and the black canopy tore apart.</p><p>The collision of various forces generated a storm that swept across Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Trees were uprooted, halls collapsed, the earth quaked, and the main peak of Mount Taiyue seemed on the verge of toppling, the scene one of utter devastation.</p><p>Finally, the black canopy shattered completely!</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Wudao could no longer conceal the phenomenon.  Strange light pierced the heavens, spatial fluctuations erupted, and the celestial phenomena shifted dramatically.</p><p>However, all of this was within Zhu Wudao’s expectations.</p><p>Everything was proceeding according to his plan. The top cultivators of the various sects in the Central Plains were gathered in Jinyu Province.  Even if they received the news, they wouldn't arrive in time to stop them.</p><p>The vortex expanded at an accelerating pace.</p><p>Through the vortex and the passage, mirage-like images occasionally flickered into view: a section of mountains, a pavilion, a stretch of forest, clearly projections from within the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>This proved the Formless Immortal Sect hadn't been destroyed, but preserved intact!</p><p>Just then, an unexpected change occurred.</p><p>The altar suddenly began to shake violently, and the five struggled to maintain their grip. The two replica Phase Tokens rattled ominously, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>A mishap at this juncture could ruin everything.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>Zhu Wudao’s expression shifted drastically, and he let out a long howl.</p><p>With the phenomenon revealed, there was no longer any need to conceal Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others, hearing the howl, immediately withdrew their forces and rushed to the altar, encircling it and employing their respective arcane arts.</p><p>…</p><p>North foothills of Mount Taiyue.</p><p>Yue Lingtian returned, descending into the valley to meet with True Person Zi Lei.</p><p>They were hidden there, gazing up at the sky.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei was searching for any trace of Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>…</p><p>West of the mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang stood beneath a tree, having waited patiently for a long time.  He gazed intently at the celestial phenomenon, his brow flashing as he summoned his External Avatar.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of Mount Taiyue, in a desolate mountain range not far from the mountain.</p><p>A figure, shrouded in a strange mist, drifted through the forest, its speed fluctuating, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>The phenomenon appeared.</p><p>The figure stopped abruptly and looked up, revealing a pale face.  It was Elder Fan, the Great Elder of the Skyhawk Tower, also known as Old Demon Fan.</p><p>This man had a pale, beardless face, devoid of any color, and exuded a chilling aura.  He was initially surprised, then, as if recalling something, his expression turned to one of shock and delight. “Old Ghost Zhu, I wondered why your Quyang Mountain lineage has been so secretive. It turns out you're remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect!  Fortunately, this old man followed you here, otherwise I would have missed a tremendous opportunity!”</p><p>He let out a sinister chuckle and vanished in a flash.</p><p>…</p><p>Further away.</p><p>In a market town.</p><p>Low-level cultivators, unable to undertake the long journey to attend the Dharma Assembly, had gathered in the market town to organize a small-scale Dao Discussion Assembly.  Some even offered prizes, and the participants were all disciples of nearby minor sects.</p><p>Two individuals were engaged in a duel on the stage, captivating the audience.</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion erupted outside, and several people who left the venue didn't return.</p><p>Exclamations filled the air, and the remaining attendees, unable to contain their curiosity, rushed out, even the two duelists on stage couldn’t resist.</p><p>The streets were filled with people, all gazing in astonishment towards Mount Taiyue.</p><p>“That’s… seems to be Mount Taiyue.”</p><p>“What happened at Mount Taiyue?”</p><p>“Impossible, who would dare attack Mount Taiyue?  It looks like a treasure has emerged. Let’s go!”</p><p>As this person moved, his companion grabbed him. “A treasure from Mount Taiyue? You dare try to seize it?  Do you have a death wish?”</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid of?” The man pulled his companion back. “The celestial phenomenon is so eye-catching, it’s definitely not only us who have seen it. As the saying goes, there is safety in numbers.  Mount Taiyue gets the meat, can't we at least have some soup? Let's go check it out!”</p><p>His companion's interest was piqued.</p><p>Soon, figures flew out of the market town, soaring towards Mount Taiyue on their flying artifacts.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in various locations near Mount Taiyue.</p><p>…</p><p>South of Mount Taiyue.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin were searching for the Grotesque-Faced Man in the wilderness.</p><p>They were accompanied by another individual, Elder Ming of the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>While the Poison King and Master Huaiyin tracked the Grotesque-Faced Man, Elder Ming led the Myriad Poison Mountain experts in a comprehensive search, leaving no stone unturned.</p><p>As they journeyed.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin abruptly stopped, as if sensing something.  Their expressions changed, they exchanged a glance, and their speed surged dramatically, their figures becoming blurs.</p><p>Elder Ming, bewildered, hurried to catch up, but could only see their retreating figures.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>Elder Ming finally caught up with them on a mountain peak, where he also witnessed the escalating celestial phenomenon in the sky.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Elder Ming was stunned.  “It seems to be coming from Mount Taiyue.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin glanced at the Poison King.</p><p>Hailing from the Western Regions, he knew little about the Central Plains and didn't understand the significance of this phenomenon.</p><p>The Poison King remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>“Southern Borderlands, Immortal Abode…”</p><p>The Poison King’s eyes widened in realization. “The Formless Immortal Sect!  No wonder that villain lingered in the Southern Province.  The disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators…  Indeed, some scoundrels have taken advantage of the Dharma Assembly to cause trouble!”</p><p>“The Formless Immortal Sect?” Master Huaiyin asked, puzzled.</p><p>The Poison King briefly explained the history.</p><p>Master Huaiyin nodded and was about to set off when the Poison King stopped him.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Poison King turned and said, "They dare to act now, and at Mount Taiyue no less, their forces must be considerable. If their cultivation is all like that villain's, we alone might not be able to influence the situation. The Daoist and Buddhist sects are the most familiar with the Formless Immortal Sect. Elder Ming, return to the sect quickly and send a message to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery. Tell them to contact Master Xingji immediately and inquire about the cause of this!"</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Elder Ming took his leave.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin made their way towards Mount Taiyue.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere on the border between the Savage Lands and the Southern Province.</p><p>The environment here was vastly different from the Southern Borderlands, with no poisonous miasma for hundreds of miles.</p><p>The mountains were picturesque.</p><p>The morning mist flowed through the forests, and the birdsong echoed through the tranquil valleys, surpassing even the scenery of the Central Plains.</p><p>Hidden deep within the mountains was an ancient temple called the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>There were only a few scattered temples within the mountain range, each embodying the essence of tranquility and seamlessly blending with nature.</p><p>The Hidden Moon Convent was only slightly larger than the Eight Sceneries Monastery.</p><p>Leaves fell into the convent courtyard.</p><p>Several nuns swept the fallen leaves with brooms, everything appearing as it would in any ordinary temple.</p><p>In their hands, the brooms seemed weightless, each sweep natural and effortless, imbued with a sense of serenity.  Clearly, even this was a form of cultivation.</p><p>Inside a meditation chamber.</p><p>An elderly nun sat with prayer beads in hand, a sandalwood incense burner before her, deep in meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, a young nun rushed in, flustered.</p><p>“What is the cause of this commotion?”</p><p>The elderly nun asked softly.</p><p>The elderly nun's voice seemed to possess a calming power, and the young nun's anxiety subsided somewhat.  She bowed and said, “Master, one of the pagodas in the Pagoda Forest suddenly began to glow.”</p><p>The elderly nun paused, her fingers stilling, and rose to her feet.  She walked out of the meditation chamber and towards the Pagoda Forest.</p><p>“Master, it’s over there.”</p><p>The young nun pointed towards a pagoda in the center of the forest, which was indeed emitting light.</p><p>This pagoda was different in design from the others.</p><p>Seeing this, a ripple of emotion finally crossed the elderly nun’s face. She flashed to the front of the pagoda.</p><p>The elderly nun reached out and gently touched the pagoda, the surprise in her eyes deepening.  She murmured, “The Formless Immortal Sect…”</p><p>“Master, what is the meaning of this?  What is the Formless Immortal Sect?”  The young nun asked cautiously.  She had guarded the Pagoda Forest for many years and had never witnessed such a strange occurrence.</p><p>The elderly nun's palm glowed with Buddhist light, merging with the light emanating from the pagoda.</p><p>Then, her hand reached inside the pagoda, as if grasping something.</p><p>After a moment of sensing, the elderly nun didn't answer the young nun's question.  Instead, she instructed, “Go and summon your Martial Aunt and the others from their seclusion.  Yes, including your Martial Aunt Liu Li.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p>
