<h1>Chapter 1707: The Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture</h1><p>Shrouded in hazy mist, the avatar stood before the temple gates, his gaze sweeping past Grandmaster Xingji and the other eminent monks. Apricot-yellow temple walls, gray roof ridges, and ink-black mountains formed the backdrop, the ancient temple a silhouette flickering within the floating clouds, serene and solemn.  Monks filed out, lining the path.  Inside and outside the temple, many individuals unaffiliated with the Buddhist faith were also present.  All eyes were on the avatar, curious to see what manner of being this Xie Clan ancestor truly was.  Naturally, there were also those who harbored ulterior motives, their eyes fixated on the Five Elements Elixir.</p><p>While the avatar conversed with Grandmaster Xingji, impatient voices buzzed with transmitted messages.  The dialogue between the two surprised many, but then a sudden realization dawned. No wonder Saint Huiguang had personally vouched for him; it turned out he had become a lapdog of the Buddhist Sect.</p><p>This was precisely Qin Sang's intention. He held no sectarian bias, treating both Daoism and Buddhism equally.  By openly declaring his affiliation with the Ganlu Zen Monastery, binding his avatar to the Buddhist Sect, and establishing a righteous stance, he ensured a degree of safety, at least within the monastery's walls.</p><p>After the transaction, the avatar planned to remain at the Ganlu Zen Monastery to attempt a breakthrough.  If all went well, the avatar would leverage the monastery's resources to gather the items Qin Sang needed in Zhongzhou, while his true body focused solely on cultivation in Luye.</p><p>Before his arrival, Qin Sang had meticulously filtered the avatar's memories and placed restrictions upon it. If anything untoward occurred, he would decisively abandon the avatar!</p><p>The avatar and Grandmaster Xingji chatted amicably, appearing to some malicious onlookers as colluding villains.  After the pleasantries, both parties entered the temple.</p><p>The Ganlu Zen Monastery had prepared a grand reception, fully honoring Saint Huiguang's promise.  Though Qin Sang was not fond of such pomp and circumstance, he played along. Like a marionette, the avatar was busy from dawn till noon, putting on a show for the guests.</p><p>Once the guests departed, Grandmaster Xingji personally escorted the avatar to a cave dwelling for rest.  It was evident that the arrangements were somewhat hasty; they hadn't anticipated the avatar's decision to stay at the monastery.</p><p>The cave dwelling, located on a rear mountain of the Ganlu Zen Monastery, was secluded and elegant, a truly exceptional cultivation ground. The avatar was highly satisfied, thinking to himself that it was indeed a sacred land for cultivation. Such a cave dwelling, in the Northern Sea, perhaps only Xuan Tian Palace's Lingxiao Peak could surpass, and this one was certainly not the most prestigious within the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>The only slight imperfection was that he didn't have the mountain to himself; another eminent monk of the Ganlu Zen Monastery also cultivated there.</p><p>Declining further arrangements, the avatar saw Grandmaster Xingji off. As he sat down to ponder, a guest monk led Xie An, the Zhou-Ruan couple, and others who had been waiting elsewhere to him.</p><p>"We pay our respects to Ancestor!"</p><p>"We pay our respects to Senior!"</p><p>…</p><p>They knelt and kowtowed, their voices and expressions filled with uncontainable excitement.  They still felt as if they were in a dream.</p><p>The avatar spoke indifferently, "Xie Yi and Zhou Li have been accepted as disciples by Shen Chen. As for the rest of you, return and continue as you have. The Xie Clan and Loutai Temple should work together to govern the three prefectures. This old man will no longer involve himself in worldly affairs. If you encounter any trouble, go cry to the Ganlu Zen Monastery…"</p><p>Dismissing them, the avatar sat in quiet contemplation for a while before leaving the cave dwelling. The guest monk remained respectfully outside.</p><p>"This Daoist wishes to visit Saint Huiguang on Small Fangcun Mountain. Could the Venerable Master guide the way?" the avatar asked casually.</p><p>The guest monk nodded, asking no questions, and silently led the way.</p><p>The two walked one after the other through the mountains, taking in the scenic beauty. This area was already the heart of the Ganlu Zen Monastery, heavily guarded. Along the way, the avatar sensed powerful auras hidden in the shadows more than once.  However, these individuals seemed to have received instructions, as none emerged to question him.</p><p>The journey was unimpeded.</p><p>Upon reaching the foot of a green mountain, the guest monk stopped, hands clasped together.  The avatar thanked him and proceeded towards the mountain. Suddenly, he heard a voice: "Fellow Daoist Qin, please."</p><p>A stone path materialized within the forest. The mountain itself held no apparent mystique, but upon entering, its inner splendor revealed itself. Compared to this place, his own cave dwelling paled in comparison, a truly fitting sanctuary for a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The stone path wound through the forest, accompanied by the chirping of birds.  The avatar saw no Buddhist statues or stone carvings.  Reaching the end of the path, he arrived at the summit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there were no temples atop the mountain, only two meditation cushions placed on a rock, occupied by Saint Huiguang and Saintess Qinghu, with an altar beside them. They were meditating with closed eyes and now opened them simultaneously, gazing towards him.</p><p>Observed by Nascent Soul experts, the avatar's expression remained unchanged. He noticed that Saintess Qinghu had grown three more fluffy fox tails behind her, though they appeared somewhat illusory.</p><p>"Greetings, Saint Monk, Saintess," the avatar bowed.</p><p>"Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin," Saint Huiguang inclined his head slightly, gesturing to a materialized meditation cushion and inviting him to sit.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu smiled faintly, "You have some courage!"</p><p>The avatar sat down without hesitation and immediately stated his request, "The two of you will not interfere in the transactions between myself and Fellow Daoist Mo, will you?"</p><p>"We will not interfere in any way," Saint Huiguang promised.</p><p>The avatar nodded, then produced a jade slip and handed it to Saint Huiguang, "May I trouble the Saint Monk to arrange a Spirit Array according to the instructions within this jade slip."</p><p>Saint Huiguang examined the slip and with a flick of his finger, transformed it into a streak of light that shot out of the mountain.</p><p>"This array is rather complex; it will require some time."</p><p>"No matter."</p><p>The avatar inwardly breathed a sigh of relief; at least the first step had gone smoothly. This array, known as the Myriad Mile Azure Sky Array, was a communication array. With his avatar residing in the Ganlu Zen Monastery, it was inconvenient for his true body to approach. They would use this array to communicate. The Ganlu Zen Monastery surely had similar secret techniques, but only his own could be trusted.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained this array in Xuan Tian Palace.  Due to the complexity of its arrangement and the high value of the required spirit materials, coupled with its limited communication function and usage, it was rather impractical. Only the Ganlu Zen Monastery possessed the resources for it.</p><p>Next, the three began discussing the matter of the Karmic Oath.  It was primarily a debate between the avatar and Saintess Qinghu, with Saint Huiguang occasionally interjecting fairly.  Qin Sang's objective was self-preservation.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu accepted most of the avatar's demands but insisted on one point: any promise made by her would be limited to this realm and before Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage.  She guaranteed she wouldn't bully the weak.</p><p>The oath was settled.  The altar was set, and the oath was sworn. The ritual of the Karmic Oath was complex, taking three days to complete.</p><p>Three days later, Saintess Qinghu's lips curled slightly, "Have you decided what you want?"</p><p>The avatar replied gravely, "I would like to examine the Saintess' treasures more closely."</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>Saintess Qinghu's face bloomed into a smile, her charm captivating. With a pat on her jade belt, streams of light shot out like flowing water, hovering in the void between the three, allowing the avatar to choose freely.</p><p>The avatar scanned the treasures, his expression puzzled.  There was no Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu lazily explained, "The Primordial Spirit Gathering Array is hidden within a secret realm in the Eastern Sea. Whether I move it from the secret realm or tell you its location depends on your preference. Forcibly removing the array carries the risk of damage. Of course, if the Spirit Gathering Array is damaged, I will offer other compensation."</p><p>The avatar nodded. Though he didn't reply, he had already made his decision. He would definitely have Saintess Qinghu move the array; otherwise, wouldn't he be offering her an opportunity to trap him?</p><p>He looked again at the treasures before him: various immortal trees and exotic flowers, jade slips and ancient scrolls, elixirs and magical artifacts, a dazzling array. Their values varied, but each was a rare marvel.</p><p>The avatar inwardly marveled at the wealth of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Raising his hand, he beckoned, and amidst the shimmering light, an object flew out and landed in his palm.</p><p>It was a jade-green spiritual bamboo, only three feet tall, resembling a long flute.  Its body was perfectly straight, with seven segments, each identical in length and thickness.  Even the root at the very bottom was the same, only slightly paler.</p><p>Strangely, there were no leaves on the bamboo, only a single, glistening flower blooming at its tip.</p><p>It was the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo!</p><p>Leafless yet blossoming, this was the mark of a mature Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo. The spiritual flower could be used in alchemy, but if the bamboo itself was to be refined into an artifact, the flower would be incorporated to enhance its power.</p><p>The avatar examined it carefully, primarily checking for any damage. This was a requirement of the Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele; the spiritual wood used as a medium had to be complete.</p><p>After the inspection, the avatar returned the bamboo and summoned a silver flower as large as a plate, a crescent-shaped green fruit, and a gnarled tree root covered in bumps…</p><p>Saintess Qinghu had preserved them well, all appearing freshly picked, vibrant and glistening.</p><p>These spiritual herbs and bottled elixirs had various effects. For instance, the green fruit could enhance divine sense, its potency comparable to the Azurefall Ginseng Fruit.  The avatar held the green fruit, seemingly reluctant to part with it, before finally returning it.</p><p>He then turned his attention to the jade slips.  They contained the post-Nascent Soul cultivation techniques mentioned by Saintess Qinghu, as well as other secret arts.</p><p>The Ancient Hua Scripture, the Hundredfold Yin Thunder, the Four Secret Divine Records…</p><p>Indeed, each was a supreme human cultivation method.  The Hundredfold Yin Thunder, in particular, was a top-tier secret art of the Profound Water Dao, attainable only after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  By refining Profound Water Yin Thunder and layering it multiple times, not only was its power terrifying, but upon unleashing, it could manipulate the power of heaven and earth, making it difficult for enemies to evade. It required the cultivation of a water-attribute cultivation method and the purest water-attribute True Essence; otherwise, its cultivation was extremely difficult.</p><p>It was perfectly suited for the avatar.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's true body still didn't know if he could reach the Nascent Soul stage, and the avatar was even further away. No matter how tempting the secret art, he had to reluctantly abandon it.</p><p>Returning the Hundredfold Yin Thunder, he retrieved another jade slip. Upon seeing the name inscribed upon it, his spirit was immediately invigorated.  It was this technique that had finally convinced him to take the risk.</p><p>The Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture!</p><p>Five large characters met his eyes, followed by an outline of the secret art. The jade slip was protected by restrictions, allowing him to see only a portion of the contents, but it revealed the key to this secret art.</p><p>It involved actively attracting a sliver of demonic nature from a foreign Heavenly Devil, drawing this external devil into the body to illuminate the Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Finally, he looked at the artifacts. Though there were no spirit treasures, there were pseudo-spirit treasures.</p><p>After examining them all, the avatar was faced with a dilemma. He desired the Primordial Spirit Gathering Array, the Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture, and the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo.  There was also the Seven Star Root, which could be used as a primary ingredient to refine an elixir described in the Panhu True Scripture to enhance the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>However, Saintess Qinghu's compensation, along with the Spirit Calming Incense formula, wasn't enough to exchange for everything. As for the piece of Spirit Calming Incense, he would keep it for Liuli.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu had acted rudely first, so he could demand a premium, but she had offered compensation, and he also had to consider Saint Huiguang's mediation, so he couldn't be too excessive.</p><p>After some thought, the avatar said, "I obtained the Water Aspect Hall's alchemy inheritance in the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. The senior who created the Spirit Calming Incense might also have originated from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. Perhaps it will be helpful in refining the Spirit Calming Incense."</p><p>Saintess Qinghu's beautiful eyes flickered, watching with amusement as the avatar made his selections.  Upon hearing his words, she didn't even blink. "Traded."</p><p>"Also, the main ingredient for the Spirit Calming Incense, including two Myriad Spirit Fruits…"</p><p>There were three Myriad Spirit Fruits remaining, and he intended to offer two.</p><p>Before the avatar could finish, Saintess Qinghu readily agreed, "Traded."</p><p>Both parties were inclined to make a deal, so the subsequent process went smoothly. The avatar took the Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture, the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo, and requested that Saintess Qinghu move the Primordial Spirit Gathering Array.  He also exchanged the Myriad Spirit Fruits and other previously gathered spiritual herbs for the Seven Star Root, and asked Saintess Qinghu to help him search for the various spiritual herbs required by the Panhu True Scripture, as well as the core spirit materials for the Taiji Immortal Platform.</p><p>He could collect the Icefire Tokens slowly.</p><p>This might appear to be aiding the enemy, but Qin Sang didn't care how strong his opponents were.  As long as he continued to progress, he would eventually catch up and surpass them!</p><p>"Once the Myriad Mile Azure Sky Array is complete, I will inform my true body to deliver the elixir formula and treasures," the avatar bowed slightly and descended the mountain, his hands full.</p><p>Watching the avatar's figure disappear among the mountains, Saintess Qinghu chuckled playfully, "I thought I would have to put in some effort to subtly give him the Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture, but I didn't expect him to choose it directly, saving me the trouble."</p><p>Turning her head to glance at Saint Huiguang, she added, "It is said that foreign Heavenly Devils are attracted when cultivators undergo the Void Refining Tribulation.  If the tribulation is too strong, the heavens and earth tremble, attracting the gaze of external evils.  During the Heart Devil Tribulation, foreign Heavenly Devils may invade.  Cultivators dread Heavenly Devils, yet someone dares to actively invite them in. Old monk, are you sure you haven't done anything? Aren't you afraid he'll sense something amiss and shelve it?"</p><p>Saint Huiguang replied, "This technique is a Nascent Soul secret art; I don't possess the ability to alter it.  Any modification would leave flaws, easily detectable. In ancient times, there were ascetic Buddhist cultivators with unwavering wills who dared to actively utilize foreign Heavenly Devils to find weaknesses in their own nature, seeking complete enlightenment.  This scripture arose from that practice. However, this scripture focuses more on strengthening divine sense, and since it doesn't truly involve attracting Heavenly Devils, its effect on refining one's nature is greatly diminished."</p><p>"You suspect the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound is related to foreign Heavenly Devils?"</p><p>Saintess Qinghu clicked her tongue in admiration.  "What a vicious scheme!</p><p>"That person's divine sense far surpasses his peers, even exceeding his own cultivation level.  Even if he's not a Spirit Cultivator, he must have profound attainments in it. Perhaps his divine sense can leap ahead first, rivaling that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"Now it seems the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound is compatible with the Heavenly Dao.  Unless he breaks through to the Nascent Soul realm and achieves communion with heaven and earth, even a greatly enhanced divine sense won't be able to perceive the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound.</p><p>"If he breaks through to Nascent Soul, he will surely die during the Heart Devil Tribulation.</p><p>"If his breakthrough fails and he's trapped by the bottleneck, desperate, he will certainly think of the Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture to further strengthen his divine sense and seek a breakthrough opportunity.  At that time, when he attracts the Heavenly Devil, if your speculation is correct and foreign Heavenly Devils are the source of the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound, what he attracts won't be a sliver of demonic nature but the gaze of the Heavenly Devil itself!</p><p>"If he suddenly perishes, we can confirm the source of the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound based on this.</p><p>"Even if the changes in this realm are unrelated to foreign Heavenly Devils, with the demonic nature of the Heavenly Devil residing within him, if the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound continues to intensify, he will undoubtedly be the first affected.  His demonic nature will erupt, and he will certainly die.</p><p>"Spirit Cultivators are rare in this world. Those who know about the Heavenly Dao Devil Sound wouldn't dare cultivate this technique. His kind is a rare exception; indeed, no one is more suitable than him.</p><p>"Old monk, you truly fear him deeply. Even if he cannot break through to Nascent Soul, you don't intend to let him live!"</p><p>Saint Huiguang fingered his prayer beads, eyes closed in silence.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu sighed, "I used to dislike you, but I considered your actions to be relatively honorable.  When have you resorted to such underhanded tricks?"</p><p>Finally, Saintess Qinghu shook her head, commenting, "Anxious and uncertain, nothing more.  Too many attachments are truly a burden."</p><p>…</p><p>Far away in the Northern Wilderness, in Luye, Qin Sang's true body was not cultivating at this moment.  Instead, he was constantly deducing something, the Unborn Devil Seal gifted to him by Senior Sister Qingjun surfacing in his mind.</p><p>Since obtaining this secret art, Qin Sang had harbored a certain thought, but despite searching throughout the Northern Sea and Zhongzhou, he hadn't found any cultivation techniques or secret arts to confirm it.</p><p>Foreign Heavenly Devils, also known as External Form Heavenly Devils, were terrifying existences capable of transforming into cultivators' heart devils, killing them silently.</p><p>If internal devils are not born, what harm can external devils do?</p>
