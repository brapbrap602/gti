<h1>Chapter 848: The Five Yin Mysterious Body</h1><p>Chapter 848: The Five Yin Mysterious Body</p><p>Qin Sang quietly took out the talisman he had received from the young man, gripping the True Devil Qi.  He tried to activate it, but it remained inert.  It seemed he was still doing something wrong.</p><p>"Xiang Yi and Yue Xiangu have high positions in the Commerce League. Xiang Yi is even a close confidant of the League Master. Could the East Pole League Master be a great devil? However, rumor has it that even present-day devil cultivators can't withstand the erosion of ancient True Devil Qi.  Just what was the background of Yue Xiangu's acquaintance?"</p><p>Qin Sang put away the talisman, pondering these thoughts.  As he recalled the East Pole League Master, he unexpectedly found the person's image very vague and mysterious.  There seemed to be many rumors, but all were ambiguous and deeply hidden.</p><p>The same was true of the other two major Commerce League masters; even their true cultivation levels were unclear.</p><p>In contrast, the Devil Lord, the Righteous Path leader, and the Heavenly Dao Sect's Sect Master, Ling Zhuzi, weren't so mysterious. It was certain they were all late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>"Truth mixed with falsehood, falsehood mixed with truth, you within me, me within you.  And outside, the Witch and Demon tribes are watching hungrily. The cultivation world here is truly chaotic."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, deciding not to delve deeper into these matters, lest he invite trouble.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yue Xiangu silently infiltrated the valley bottom, descending slowly along the rock wall.  As she went deeper, she found the mist growing darker and the True Devil Qi increasingly dense.</p><p>Yue Xiangu's expression tightened slightly. She suddenly swung her arm, spreading her five fingers. Several transparent threads shot out from her fingertips, instantly disappearing into the thick fog.</p><p>Not far below Yue Xiangu, on a protruding rock, a hawk, as large as an adult, stood seemingly asleep, but actually alert and vigilant.  This place inevitably endured the erosion of the True Devil Qi.</p><p>The black-feathered hawk tucked its head under its wings, standing on one leg.  A shimmering light flowed from its feathers, resisting the True Devil Qi.</p><p>The transparent threads descended from above, but the vigilant hawk remained unaware.  Only when the threads were upon it did the hawk suddenly become alert.  Its wings spread, its neck arched high, about to let out a loud scream, but no sound came. Its eyes were filled with panic.</p><p>In an instant, the hawk was completely wrapped in the threads, unable to move.</p><p>Yue Xiangu appeared on the rock, frowning at the hawk.</p><p>"The anomaly has indeed alarmed these beasts. This hawk possesses peak Yao Ling stage strength. It was left here to guard; the other beasts went to inform the greater demon."</p><p>Yue Xiangu looked upward, her eyes showing a hint of worry. "Judging from the scene here, the True Devil Qi must have leaked only in the last few days. There's still time…"</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Yue Xiangu made a grasping motion with her hand.  Firelight flickered on the threads, and the hawk's body was instantly incinerated.  She then continued her descent.</p><p>The valley bottom was very deep.  More and more True Devil Qi billowed up from within, forcing even Yue Xiangu to activate her magical treasures to protect herself from its erosion.</p><p>Besides the hawk, there were no other beasts in the valley.  Yue Xiangu descended with a relieved heart, finally setting foot on solid ground in the pitch-black depths.</p><p>"Fortunately, the amount of True Devil Qi accumulated here isn't much. Otherwise, even with my cultivation, I wouldn't dare to barge in! Success or failure hinges on this. Don't let me down!"</p><p>A fervent gleam flashed in Yue Xiangu's eyes. After searching for a moment, she found an inconspicuous opening.  Extremely pure True Devil Qi was constantly emanating from the opening. The surroundings were in disarray; the protective barriers had been completely destroyed by the outburst of True Devil Qi.</p><p>Yue Xiangu, confirming the absence of any great demons, eagerly entered the cave.</p><p>The cave was winding and uneven, sloping downwards. Yue Xiangu soon arrived at an underground hall.  There was a sudden ‘click’ underfoot. Picking it up, she found she had stepped on a piece of broken jade.</p><p>Upon seeing the broken jade, Yue Xiangu's face suddenly changed.  She quickly entered the hall, only to find more and more broken jade, almost covering the entire floor.</p><p>"Could they all be broken?"</p><p>Yue Xiangu's throat tightened. These were the jade coffins she had left behind, now shattered!</p><p>"Open!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu hissed, sending threads flying in all directions.  Firelight erupted from them, temporarily repelling the surrounding True Devil Qi, revealing the scene in the hall.</p><p>In the center of the hall, a complex large array stood, and at the center of the array, a jade coffin remained intact.</p><p>Inside the jade coffin lay a young woman!</p><p>Her beauty was striking, her innocence unusual.  Lying within the coffin, her eyes were closed, like a sleeping beauty.  She wore nothing, her figure curvaceous. Her skin possessed an unnatural pallor, almost ghastly, devoid of any color.</p><p>Upon seeing the woman, Yue Xiangu’s eyes lit up with intense joy.  She flashed to the side of the coffin, bending down to gaze intently at the young woman, her expression entranced.</p><p>She reached out with her bark-like hands, stroking the jade coffin as if caressing the woman’s cheek, incredibly gentle and careful.</p><p>Especially after noticing the woman’s slightly twitching nostrils, Yue Xiangu let out a silent laugh.</p><p>Quickly regaining her composure, she cautiously glanced at the cave entrance, then bit her fingertip, using her blood to inscribe mysterious runes on the coffin.</p><p>The blood runes covered the coffin, glowing crimson.</p><p>The next moment, all the runes vanished into the coffin.</p><p>Yue Xiangu forcefully lifted the lid, the coffin opening with a resounding click. The young woman’s eyelids fluttered, slowly opening to reveal a look of confusion. She slowly sat up.</p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p>Yue Xiangu's voice sounded like a spell. The young woman flinched, her face showing fear, seeming terrified of Yue Xiangu.</p><p>"Do you remember your name?  Who am I to you?"</p><p>Yue Xiangu stared into the young woman's eyes, her voice low and hypnotic.</p><p>"I…"</p><p>The young woman opened her mouth, then suddenly cried out in pain, clutching her head, her body violently shaking.</p><p>Yue Xiangu watched coldly, neither speaking nor intervening.</p><p>"My name is Su Nu! You are my master."</p><p>The young woman abruptly stopped trembling, her expression vacant, staring straight at Yue Xiangu.</p><p>Yue Xiangu’s lips curled into a slight smile.  In a seductive tone, she said, "That's right! Your name is Su Nu, and you are my disciple! You are the only Su Nu! Do you remember your abilities? Show me!"</p><p>Su Nu looked around, bewildered.</p><p>At that moment, Yue Xiangu released a silken thread, a surge of demonic energy rushing forth.  The young woman instinctively raised her hand, grasping the demonic energy, subconsciously activating her cultivation technique.  Then, an astonishing sight unfolded.</p><p>The demonic energy was directly absorbed into the young woman's body. She screamed, curling up on the ground in pain, but then the energy was swallowed by five strange meridians within her body.</p><p>Although the absorption was not fast, the demonic energy gradually became docile.</p><p>The young woman recovered, her eyes vacant.</p><p>At this point, the smile on Yue Xiangu’s face was uncontainable, her wrinkles bunching together as she erupted in laughter: "Haha… the Five Yin Mystical Body! It truly is the Five Yin Mystical Body! That ancient technique really worked! Using the ancient demonic energy, it truly can forge the acquired Five Yin Mystical Body. The ancients did not deceive me!"</p>
