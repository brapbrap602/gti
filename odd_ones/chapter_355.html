      After playing with the armor for a while, only then did the
                players remember to compare the attributes between the Sunil
                Soldier Armor with the armor in the shops, and the result was
                that it was almost the same!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Same quality, a quarter of the price—this was more than worth
                it!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The players were over the moon. The rest of the players did not
                observe anymore and paid willingly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Fifty something people, more than 40,000 Enas, about the
                  price of two knowledges…
      </em>
      Han Xiao smiled. There was more!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Right after, he added a new option in the faction shop
                page—equipment enhancement!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had held back when he built the armor. Their attributes
                were just the ‘Basic Version’. This was to provide room for
                enhancement so that he could open another revenue stream!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Repairs and enhancements were long term incomes. Han Xiao had
                multiple machinery enhancement abilities, so he had what it took
                to enter the enhancement business. Naturally, Han Xiao was not
                going to miss this opportunity. Also, he was going to control
                the level of enhancement that he gave and would not do full
                enhancements the very first time, leaving room for improvement,
                hence attracting the players to keep spending.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Great Mechanic Han was not greedy—by dividing one thing and
                selling them separately, he could maximize his profits, and the
                players that did not know this were willing to pay for it. Han
                Xiao competed with other shops by using cheap, high-quality
                equipment, to first let the players buy the equipment, then
                introduce the enhancement option, turning a one-time sale into
                long term profit.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After all, he had occasionally played single player games in his
                previous life too, and he was inspired by the gaming companies
                turning one game into several DLCs
      <sup class="calibre8">
       1
      </sup>
      .
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao felt nostalgic. Back when he was young, he had been an
                honest man, but his tiny and pure heart had become polluted by
                society. Turning bad was not one man’s fault, it was the world’s
                fault.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      For the following few days, Han Xiao built all the armor. Every
                player wore Enlistee Class armor—it was like the mercenary group
                had its uniform. Although the players were all Supers, Enlistee
                Class armor still proved to be helpful.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As a firm supporter of the Great Mechanic Han, Frenzied Sword
                was the first one to buy the enhancement. The attributes of the
                armor increased by around ten percent after the enhancement.
                Multiple enhancements of the same equipment would have an
                increased cost. As for the Enlistee Class armor, the first
                enhancement only cost 60 Enas, the second cost 100, and the
                third 150. Every fourth enhancement in a row, the price would
                have a big leap from the previous one; the fourth enhancement
                cost 300.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The attributes increased by eight to twelve percent every
                enhancement. It was low-cost, high profit, and Frenzied Sword
                vouched for it. The others thought that it was a good deal and
                followed. After the Sunil mission, the players all had more than
                10,000 Enas, and it was burning a hole in their pockets.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had left plenty of room for enhancements when he made
                the armor—it had to be enhanced at least seven times to reach
                the limit of his ability. The enhancement business brought made
                him 23,000 Enas, which meant on average, the fifty plus players
                all enhanced their armor at least three times!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao made 40,000 from selling the armor and 23,000 from
                enhancing them. Now with more than 67,000 Enas in his account,
                he more than enough to buy knowledges.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was having a great time selling, while Herlous was
                speechless. He found Han Xiao and said with surprise, “How do
                you know our single unit armor technology?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had built Sunil’s armor, which would definitely make Herlous
                question him. Han Xiao laughed and said, “I derived the
                blueprint during battlefield repairs. Aren’t I very skilled?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Herlous’ face twitched. Han Xiao had stolen Sunil’s technology,
                yet he had asked a Sunil to compliment his skill. Even his
                Battleship Slicing Blade could not cut through skin this thick!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Anyway, with Sunil at its current state, there was no point
                dwelling on this. Herlous still had to stay with Han Xiao, so he
                did not care about it. Furthermore, it was not any kind of rare
                technology—most civilizations had basic single unit armor, just
                with different styles.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the Area Exchange Center of Juberly Hub, Han Xiao was looking
                to buy some knowledge.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Having finally made enough money, he was about the complete the
                class advancement that he had been stuck on for so long. It went
                without saying, he was quite excited.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Colton Star Cluster area only had eight Mechanic class
                advancement knowledges, and Han Xiao glanced through and swiftly
                chose two.

     <p class="calibre5">
      The energy in his body was cheering. His class advancement made
                Han Xiao feel like he had broken through some kind of shackle.
                His vision became black, and it felt like hours had passed.
                However, it was actually only half a second. His vision then
                recovered, but it was very different with before—he could sense
                much tinier things.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Every time his strength increased, he felt like he had been
                reborn.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Data Mechanic was also called Experienced Mechanic. His
                understanding of machinery became even better. The Machinery
                Affinity at this period would make a huge leap, and among the
                four new abilities that he had just received, [Magnetic
                Vision—Data Flow] and [Machinery Analytical Comprehension] were
                both able to largely increase Machinery Affinity.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Machinery Affinity was a key attribute of the Mechanic,
                representing the speed, attributes, and power of building and
                using machinery. [Magnetic Vision—Data Flow] was an active
                skill, and after activating it, he would enter a special
                magnetic vision. His magnetic property energy would become his
                extended senses, revealing the details of the machinery with a
                magnetic field.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao immediately leveled up this skill to Level10. Its effect
                was a twenty-five to fifty percent increase in Machinery
                Affinity with a twenty energy cost per minute. The percentage
                increase changed randomly every minute. As its cost was very
                low, this skill could be activated almost continuously. Unlike
                [Surging Mechanical Force], this skill could be used in the
                building process too.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [Machinery Analytical Comprehension] was a passive talent,
                increasing machinery affinity directly according to
                Intelligence. Its effect was very powerful—every ten
                Intelligence increased machinery affinity by one percent. Han
                Xiao had more than four hundred Intelligence at this moment.
                This was a key ability for the current stage, increasing the
                benefit of the Intelligence attribute toward Mechanics. For the
                foreseeable future, this would be a core ability.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [High Concentration Refining] was the upgraded version of [Basic
                Refining]. It increased the strength of the raw materials, a
                very important effect. [Blueprint Refinement] was a passive
                skill, and it had a chance to be triggered during equipment
                building. That equipment’s blueprint level would temporarily
                increase by at most three levels, increasing the end product’s
                attributes. There was also a chance to ‘crit’ during the
                building process, resulting in an equipment of a higher grade.
                The chance depended on the user’s Intelligence and Luck.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao still had 2,500,000,000 experience, so he immediately
                leveled up all those skills and talents to the max level, using
                close to 50,000,000 at once. Then, Han Xiao also increased his
                main class to the max level, Level 15.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After Level 80, the experience to level up multiplied. One level
                required tens of millions of experience, so leveling up fifteen
                levels at once cost him 900,000,000 experience. Yet, he did not
                even blink.

      Han Xiao took a deep breath and felt the strength of his body.

                interface, spending all the Free Attribute points in
