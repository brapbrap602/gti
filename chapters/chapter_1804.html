<h1>Chapter 1795: Encountering an Old Friend in a Foreign Land</h1><p>The three departed from the Wind Pouch, eventually rejoining Realmaster Zhijian and the others.</p><p>Except for Venerable Zhenru, all those traveling together had assembled.</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian and Realmaster Zhang's auras were stable, showing no signs of injury.  Accompanying them was another Daoist.</p><p>This person wore a high crown and wide sash, possessing an immortal's air of ethereal bones.</p><p>Seeing the jade pendant at the Daoist's waist, Qin Sang, along with the other two, couldn't help but tense up.  With solemn expressions, they stepped forward and saluted, "Greetings, Ninth Heaven Investigator and the two Realmasters."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced through the ranks of the Dao Court.</p><p>A Ninth Heaven Investigator was a Fourth Grade official of the Northern Pole Exorcism Court, a position typically held by late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators or mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators who had performed meritorious deeds.</p><p>Judging by this person's aura, he was even more powerful than Li Hou.</p><p>Both his cultivation and the backing of the Northern Pole Exorcism Court demanded their utmost respect.</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian stepped forward and introduced, "This is Realmaster Wan, the Ninth Heaven Investigator. We just met. Realmaster Zhang and I have been searching for the three of you. Fortunately, you are all safe.  We are now going to another location to rendezvous with the others."</p><p>"Is it Venerable Zhenru?"</p><p>Realmaster Guyun inquired.</p><p>Realmaster Zhang shook his head.  "We found a message left by Venerable Zhenru. He was accidentally injured and has already withdrawn from the Star River, awaiting us in the Golden Palace."</p><p>Realmaster Wan's gaze swept over the three. He opened his mouth and said, "This humble Daoist was traveling in the Land of Calamity when I received a message from that old Daoist Hongyuzi. I arrived not long ago. Have you discovered any clues as to why the golden light erupted?"</p><p>Realmaster Youhuang and Realmaster Guyun both looked towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang shake his head, they both claimed ignorance.</p><p>Li Hou was tight-lipped. Qin Sang had tried to pry information from him during their chase, but the other party hadn't revealed a single secret.</p><p>However, Li Hou and the other two Demon Marquises were unharmed, indicating that the source of the golden light's eruption should be safe, and the Ghost Fang Kingdom's strength remained intact.</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian sent a voice transmission, reminding them, "Realmaster Hongyuzi is the esteemed Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor of the Heavenly Hub Court. When you meet Realmaster Hongyuzi, please do not be remiss in your respect."</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two exchanged glances, secretly surprised.</p><p>Both the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor and the Ninth Heaven Investigator had arrived. The two Courts of the Dao Court attached such importance to this matter that they dispatched two Fourth Grade Immortal Officials before the situation was clear.</p><p>Grand Realmasters rarely manifested, and Fourth Grade Immortal Officials were the most powerful individuals ordinary people could encounter.</p><p>Realmaster Wan pinched a hand seal, casting an unknown spell to confirm Hongyuzi's location. With a flick of his wide sleeve, a talismanic image manifested above them, shining like stars, hanging overhead and scattering tassels downwards.</p><p>Everyone felt as if they were within a jeweled chariot, all external fluctuations isolated. They only needed to follow Realmaster Wan's flight.</p><p>Realmaster Wan seemed to be in a hurry, rarely changing direction, flying almost in a straight line. He passed through illusions along the way without hesitation, few things able to impede his progress.</p><p>Yet, they didn't see him employ any other methods, only the talismanic image shifting, firmly protecting everyone.</p><p>It was evident that Realmaster Wan was employing a Talismanic Diagram.</p><p>A Talismanic Diagram was a combination of multiple divine talismans, similar to a formation diagram. Its power surpassed that of individual talismans, but it also placed higher demands on the caster, generally requiring prior preparation or joint execution by multiple individuals.</p><p>Cultivators of the Military Altar could command troops and execute simplified Talismanic Diagrams even at lower realms.</p><p>Yet, they didn't see Realmaster Wan summon a single soldier.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, awe filling their hearts as they silently followed behind Realmaster Wan, charging straight through the Governance Altar.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned, their path was blocked by a gray curtain.</p><p>The heavy gray curtain was like an iron wall.</p><p>The Talismanic Diagram trembled, and a wave of energy swept outwards, instantly scattering the gray curtain and revealing several cracks. Realmaster Wan stepped in first.</p><p>There were still gray curtains inside, but they had become very thin. Realmaster Wan made consecutive strikes, breaking through layers of gray curtains.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed closely behind. Just as they passed through the last gray curtain, they heard Realmaster Wan's surprised voice, "Old Bullnose, you're injured?"</p><p>Everyone focused their gaze and saw an octagonal stone pavilion within the gray curtain.</p><p>The stone pavilion was ancient and elegant, bearing the marks of time, a true antiquity.</p><p>Strangely, there were no mountains or earth here.  The gray curtain enveloped a small space, the stone pavilion floating alone within it.</p><p>At this moment, two figures were within the pavilion, one sitting and one standing.</p><p>The seated person had white hair and a youthful face, his temperament as refined as Realmaster Wan's. However, his face was as pale as paper, his breath heavy and his chest rising and falling unevenly, clearly injured.</p><p>"This person must be the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as he glanced at the other person.</p><p>He saw that the other person was wearing armor, tall and powerfully built, with a stiff expression, vastly different from ordinary people.</p><p>Seeing this person, Qin Sang inexplicably felt a sense of familiarity, suddenly remembering something, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p>This fluctuationâ€¦</p><p>So familiar!</p><p>Yin-Yang Puppet!</p><p>Qin Sang had a deep impression of Yin-Yang Puppets. Mo Xingdao had used a Yin-Yang Puppet to snatch a Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit at the Formless Immortal Sect, even Realmaster Zilei couldn't do anything about it.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal had also passed through his hands.  He had actually sold it at a loss; Mo Xingdao had gotten a bargain.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to sense the same fluctuations in this foreign realm, and the dark-skinned stranger in the pavilion was almost identical in appearance to Mo Xingdao's puppet.</p><p>It wasn't strange that this realm had similar puppet techniques, but the puppets refined by people from the two realms being identical was impossible to believe as mere coincidence.</p><p>Just then, the dark-skinned stranger raised his head, his indifferent gaze sweeping over everyone, not lingering on Qin Sang.</p><p>In the instant their gazes met, Qin Sang's heart skipped another beat. The sense of familiarity intensified, and he felt the other party's gaze was meaningful.</p><p>The dark-skinned stranger was protecting Hongyuzi. After confirming that the newcomers were not demons, he lowered his head again without a word.</p><p>Seeing that the dark-skinned stranger didn't treat him differently, Qin Sang seemed to understand something and retracted his gaze as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Fortunately, he had cultivated for many years and possessed a stable mind. His expression didn't reveal any abnormality, though turmoil surged within him.</p><p>"Forgive me for making Realmaster Wan see this," Hongyuzi in the pavilion opened his eyes and sighed softly. "When the golden light erupted, this humble Daoist and Fellow Daoist Mo were inside an illusion deep within the Governance Altar. The golden light activated the ancient mighty powers' techniques preserved within the illusion. Fortunately, we reacted quickly enough and decisively retreated, otherwise..."</p><p>Surnamed Mo!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>He was eighty percent sure that this person was Mo Xingdao!</p><p>"A puppet body... Could it be that Mo Xingdao chose to transfer his soul into a puppet? But why is he in this realm? Where are Sage Huiguang and Sage Qinghu?"</p><p>Unexpectedly reunited with an old friend, countless questions arose in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>After gaining a foothold in this realm, Qin Sang had begun investigating whether there were any ascended individuals in this realm, hoping to determine whether he had ascended to a Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Cultivation in the Storm Realm was difficult, Nascent Soul was hard to achieve, but the Central Continent had never lacked ascended individuals.</p><p>There was the Formless Immortal Sect in the distant past, and more recently, the Eight Sceneries View, the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and the Eastern Sea Demon Clan.  Counting them all, there were quite a few ascended individuals.</p><p>These people were either exceptionally talented or blessed by the realm's destiny. Even if they gradually faded into obscurity after ascending to the upper realm, they wouldn't be completely without a trace.</p><p>However, whether it was the Mount Ju Governance Sect or the two Courts of the Dao Court, there were no rumors of ascended individuals. Qin Sang hadn't even found any scriptures related to the Heavenly Tribulation of Ascension.</p><p>Either the ascended individuals had hidden themselves for some reason, or he had come to the wrong place.</p><p>Qin Sang had once thought it was the latter, but unexpectedly, he encountered an old friend in this foreign land.</p><p>Realmaster Wan entered the stone pavilion, examining Hongyuzi's injuries while asking, "Are you certain that the Governance Altar's anomaly was caused by demons?"</p><p>"It's certain that the golden light is related to demons. However, what they did inside is still unknown. Fellow Daoists who entered the Governance Altar with me are trying to track the demons, but unfortunately, we are short-handed.  Thankfully, Realmaster Wan arrived in time, and this humble Daoist can finally breathe a sigh of relief," Hongyuzi said, as if relieved of a heavy burden.</p><p>"I have one bottle of Blood-Nourishing Pills left, which should alleviate your injuries."</p><p>Realmaster Wan took out a bottle of pills.  Hongyuzi thanked him and immediately took them.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Realmaster Wan addressed those outside the pavilion, "Tell us what you witnessed before and after the golden light erupted..."</p><p>Hongyuzi, who was refining the medicinal power, closed his eyes and said, "Fellow Realmasters, please also adjust your breath and recover quickly. Once this humble Daoist suppresses my injuries, I will accompany you to the depths of the Governance Altar to investigate. Rest assured, the Dao Court will not treat you unfairly."</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>Of the five Realmasters present, only Realmaster Zhijian had the confidence to refuse the Dao Court, besides Qin Sang.</p><p>Realmaster Zhang, Realmaster Youhuang, and Realmaster Guyun had either relied on their ancestral heritage or agreed to the Dao Court's conditions in exchange for ascension qualifications.</p><p>And Realmaster Zhijian, as the initiator of this operation, couldn't easily back down.</p><p>Realmaster Zhang was the first to speak. "We were initially searching for demons in the Golden Palace..."</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian also recounted his experience.</p><p>It turned out that after they were thrown off the stone platform, they were forced to separate.  Like Qin Sang and the others, they had tried to converge towards the location Realmaster Youhuang mentioned, eventually rejoining.</p><p>Then, Realmaster Youhuang and Realmaster Guyun also recounted their encounters, mentioning only that Qin Sang had helped them scare off their pursuers, omitting the fact that Qin Sang had slain Li Hou.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke last, bowing slightly to the two Realmasters in the pavilion.  "I'm afraid this humble Daoist cannot accompany the two Realmasters."</p><p>His goal of obtaining the Demon Marquis's corpse had been achieved.  Returning to ascend and restore his strength was the most crucial matter.</p><p>Two Fourth Grade Immortal Officials had appeared one after another; these waters were getting too murky.</p><p>He didn't want to get caught up in it.</p><p>The golden light that the demons were chasing might be a supreme treasure, but Qin Sang hadn't fully mastered his own divine abilities and treasures, and was unwilling to risk it.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Hongyuzi slowly raised his head and looked over, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p>Realmaster Wan's expression remained unchanged. He sized Qin Sang up and said with a smile, "Realmaster Qingfeng appears to primarily cultivate physical power, but in this humble Daoist's opinion, it is merely a facade.  Cultivating both Dharma and Body, and achieving remarkable accomplishments in both, truly demonstrates Fellow Daoist's exceptional talent! It's a pity that this humble Daoist hadn't heard of Realmaster's name before. Truly, there are hidden pearls in the vast ocean."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart sank. Realmaster Zhijian and the others hadn't revealed his background, yet Realmaster Wan had seen through him at a glance!</p><p>"During the chaos, this humble Daoist encountered a Demon Marquis and slew him, but I also suffered heavy injuries as a result, and my Qi and blood are unstable. I ask the two Realmasters for your understanding."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and took out Li Hou's demon corpse, glancing discreetly at the dark-skinned stranger.</p><p>This person followed Hongyuzi.  If he truly was Mo Xingdao, sooner or later he would find out about his actions in this realm.</p><p>Since he hadn't exposed his origins on the spot, it meant he had other plans.</p><p>"You killed a Demon Marquis?"</p><p>Realmaster Wan was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Everyone's attention was drawn to the badger-like corpse in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>"When this humble Daoist encountered it, it was already injured for some reason. This humble Daoist found an opportunity to trap it, but unexpectedly, this demon still possessed terrifying strength.  This humble Daoist consumed a True-Settling Pill and fought desperately, only managing to slay it with great effort," Qin Sang said with lingering fear.</p><p>The influence of the Wood Spirit Qi still lingered, causing his Qi and blood to be unstable, making him appear as if he hadn't fully recovered from his injuries.</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian and the others also corroborated, saying that Qin Sang had only recently advanced and had only come at their invitation in exchange for ascension qualifications.</p><p>"It's actually Li Hou!"</p><p>After carefully examining the corpse, Realmaster Wan's face showed surprise, and he couldn't help but take another look at Qin Sang.</p><p>The Dao Court had limited information on Li Hou, but it was certain that this demon was quite powerful, possessing several formidable techniques.</p><p>For someone who had just entered the Profound Cave realm, even if they cultivated both Dharma and Body, hunting this demon without paying a price would be nearly impossible.</p><p>Realmaster Wan and Hongyuzi exchanged a few words in secret, then nodded. "Fellow Daoist has achieved the meritorious deed of slaying a demon, and healing your injuries should be your priority. However, with your injuries, returning alone could be dangerous. This place is relatively concealed; the demons won't find it easily for a while.  If anyone else gets injured later, they will also return here to heal. I hope Fellow Daoist can stay and help receive them."</p><p>"Do not leave the Governance Altar lightly before this matter is concluded.  This humble Daoist is not trying to alarm you, but if the demons' plot is significant this time, there will certainly be ambushes outside. There might even be a Demon King watching this place, ready to appear at any moment!" Hongyuzi said gravely, addressing not only Qin Sang but also warning everyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt the pressure.  He had a premonition when he saw the two Fourth Grade Immortal Officials.</p><p>Fortunately, Grand Realmasters and Demon Kings didn't dare enter the Governance Altar.</p><p>The jade pendant at Realmaster Wan's waist shimmered, shooting out a stream of light that transformed into a talismanic seal and flew towards Qin Sang.  He said, "We must take this corpse back.  After this matter is concluded, Fellow Daoist can present this seal at either of the two Courts of the Dao Court and receive corresponding merit and compensation."</p><p>Slaying a Demon Marquis was a great meritorious deed. The demon corpse didn't have to be handed over, but if one chose to give it to the Dao Court, it could be exchanged for treasures of equal value.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept Li Hou's most valuable possessions: his relics, claw gauntlets, and throat bone spike.</p><p>It was a pity that, in order to keep the demon corpse intact, he hadn't removed Li Hou's leather armor. Qin Sang had originally wanted to melt the scales into his Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>However, the Dao Court certainly wasn't lacking such treasures, so Qin Sang had no objections and handed over the demon corpse.</p><p>The stone pavilion was cramped.</p><p>Fortunately, the area enveloped by the gray curtain was quite large, divided into spaces of varying sizes, most of which contained floating stone fragments.</p><p>Leaving the stone pavilion space, Qin Sang and the others searched for nearby locations to settle down and meditate.</p><p>Qin Sang came alone to a small space with a few irregular stones floating within.</p><p>Just as he sat down, Qin Sang looked gravely at a small stone beside him.  A black light flowed across the stone's surface, and it unexpectedly sprouted chiselled features like a carved face.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo, it really is you!"</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense, touching the stone.</p><p>He hadn't expected Mo Xingdao to dare contact him in the presence of two Dao Court Immortal Officials.</p><p>"Hongyuzi discovered you outside the Governance Altar. This Mo has been waiting for Fellow Daoist."</p><p>The stone seemed to have become Mo Xingdao's puppet.</p><p>Empty eyes stared at Qin Sang, his tone flat.</p><p>"Before seeing Fellow Daoist with my own eyes, this Mo could never have imagined that the first old friend I would encounter in this realm would be you! Should I address Fellow Daoist as Realmaster Qin or Realmaster Qingfeng?"</p>
