<h1>Chapter 1464: A Word of Wisdom (4k, Combined)</h1><p>Tong Lingyu walked to the portrait, gazing at it for a long time, then said, “Legend has it that Senior Xiao Xiangzi was a Nascent Soul cultivator!”</p><p>Nascent Soul!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes showed a strange color. He stared at the portrait, looking even more carefully.  Knowing the subject's cultivation level gave him a different feeling than before.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi in the painting had an ethereal temperament, like an immortal banished to the mortal world. He was the second human Nascent Soul cultivator Qin Sang had learned about after the Four Saints Palace ancestor, but he had only seen statues of them and heard legends.</p><p>“Was Senior Xiao Xiangzi the ancestor of Xuan Tian Palace?”</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected that behind Xuan Tian Palace’s ability to unify Yin Ri Realm, subdue other sects, and incorporate them all, there must have been a peerless figure.</p><p>Yin Ri Realm had a harsh environment and sparse population, but it was still a realm, and there were certainly many large and small sects.  Only a Nascent Soul cultivator could possibly subdue all the cultivators.</p><p>Whether it was the identity of a Nascent Soul cultivator or the achievement of unifying Yin Ri Realm and establishing Xuan Tian Palace, either alone would be enough to shock the entire cultivation world.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that Xiao Xiangzi's name wasn't known outside. He had been carefully collecting various legends from the North Sea, and before hearing the name from Tong Lingyu, he had never heard of him.  Unless Xiao Xiangzi used an alias while traveling.</p><p>Qin Sang put himself in the other person's shoes and made a deduction.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang had a sudden realization. He had realized something strange: in the North Sea cultivation world, there were very few legends related to the ancestor of Xuan Tian Palace, mostly baseless rumors. The ancestor's identity and origins were always a mystery, perhaps intentionally concealed. This was somewhat similar to the Jing Hai Sect, but the Jing Hai Sect was more thorough, a completely secluded sect, little known to the outside world.</p><p>The Jing Hai Sect enshrined a Xiao Xiangzi statue in its Buddhist hall.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace hung Xiao Xiangzi's portrait in its treasure vault.</p><p>He wondered what the relationship was between these two major sects, one Buddhist and one Daoist.</p><p>“At the time of Xuan Tian Palace's founding, Senior Xiao Xiangzi probably played an important role,” Tong Lingyu emphasized the word “probably.”</p><p>“Probably?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at her questioningly. Was it not absurd that the Grand Elder of Xuan Tian Palace didn't understand the history of her sect and its ancestor?</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw Qin Sang's thoughts and smiled indifferently. “Qin Dao You, do you know how many main branches Xuan Tian Palace had at its founding?”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, she answered, “Twelve main branches!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, his gaze returning to the portrait, vaguely guessing something.</p><p>“Now, Xuan Tian Palace only has four main branches left.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu sighed softly. “From an outsider's perspective, Xuan Tian Palace's dominance of a realm seems glorious. Only those within know its difficulties. Once you become a guest elder of Listening Snow Tower, with your intelligence, you'll see the signs soon enough. There's no need to hide anything from you.”</p><p>Her gaze returned to the portrait. “For countless years, Xuan Tian Palace has been plagued by internal strife. For various reasons, internal conflicts have erupted several times, with the branches vying for power, rapidly affecting the entire Palace, resulting in bloodshed. In the most disastrous instance, it almost shattered Lingxiao Peak, causing the Immortal Spring to dry up. Only when the branches realized they couldn't monopolize the sacred land, and that further fighting would only lead to mutual destruction and benefit external enemies, did they regroup on Lingxiao Peak and establish the relatively stable situation we have today.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened to Tong Lingyu's story, reflecting on his own situation.</p><p>Even the lineage left by a Nascent Soul cultivator was so unstable.</p><p>After he was gone, would the future Qing Yang View repeat the story of Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>However, this was not something Qin Sang could decide.</p><p>Qin Sang's initial intention in establishing Qing Yang View was to uphold the legacy of Yun Youzi.  Everything after that stemmed from his responsibility as the sect's ancestor, doing what he could.</p><p>At most, he could learn from Xuan Tian Palace’s lessons and make some improvements. No sect could flourish forever.  Xuan Tian Palace now also faced internal and external troubles.</p><p>If the Dao of Immortality ended, Qin Sang would eventually perish.</p><p>Even if he luckily found a way out, Qing Yang View would struggle to keep up with him, and he would eventually have to let go.</p><p>Only self-cultivation endures.</p><p>Only the Dao of Immortality is eternal!</p><p>Tong Lingyu couldn't guess that Qin Sang had thought so much in such a short time. Her tone was somewhat low as she continued, “Xuan Tian Palace eventually stabilized, but the wounds of repeated internal strife lingered. Of the eight main branches, some were destroyed, some declined, and some were merged, leaving only four.”</p><p>The Seventy-Two Springs, once North Sea's greatest spectacle, suffered severe damage during the conflict and hasn't fully recovered.  Sect records are scattered or lost, leaving very little intact; what remains is barely recognizable. Fortunately, this portrait survived; otherwise, all that would remain of Elder Xiao Xiangzi would be a vague memory.”</p><p>Her words were heartfelt, not entirely directed at Qin Sang.  She mourned the internecine conflict among her sect's elders, as if repenting for the misdeeds of her unworthy descendants before Xiao Xiangzi's spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent until Tong Lingyu composed herself. He looked toward the treasure vault behind them. “Did the elder leave nothing behind?”</p><p>Tong Lingyu raised an eyebrow, laughing wryly. “What do you think the twelve main branches were fighting over? The sect's treasury was the first to be looted.  If it had been divided amongst the branches, that would have been preferable.  Most of the fragile items were destroyed in the Great War, and many cultivation techniques and secret arts were lost.  During the internal strife, we were also plundered by demons and devils. After so many calamities, even if records existed, they would have been destroyed. Otherwise, how could I, the Palace Mistress, be unfamiliar with Elder Xiao Xiangzi?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around at the treasures, saying expectantly, “So, there might be a Nascent Soul cultivator's legacy among these?”</p><p>Tong Lingyu chuckled. “That depends on your eye, Daoist Qin, whether you can choose a true treasure.”</p><p>“Besides the portrait, did the elder truly leave nothing else?”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Tong Lingyu was holding something back, and pressed further.  The Jing Hai Sect was gone; he wondered if any of the items those people snatched at the last moment belonged to Elder Xiao Xiangzi. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine who was there and what they took.</p><p>Tong Lingyu paused, her expression shifting.  “There is a saying!  Or, more accurately, a maxim.  While it cannot be verified, it’s likely not a fabrication.”</p><p>“What maxim?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s spirits lifted; he eagerly pressed for more.</p><p>Tong Lingyu’s lips curved into a knowing smile. She looked at Qin Sang meaningfully and asked, “What are you willing to exchange for it? Or, shall we say, your two remaining chances?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>A maxim from a Nascent Soul cultivator is invaluable.</p><p>“Is it related to cultivation or breaking through bottlenecks?”</p><p>If it were advice from the elder on cultivation, it would be worth a king's ransom. Qin Sang would be strongly tempted.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu stated firmly, offering a small clue. “It’s only eight characters long.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked dubious, suspecting Tong Lingyu of bluffing, trying to swindle him. Two chances might only buy a useless truth.</p><p>He had his eye on the seven-story pagoda and certainly intended to take it. He wasn't willing to part with any of his own treasures in exchange.</p><p>Telling Tong Lingyu about the Jing Hai Sect might work.</p><p>However, he would do that after he understood the secrets of the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang hesitate, Tong Lingyu stopped beating around the bush and said calmly, “Daoist Qin, there’s no need to rush.  Only a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator might find this maxim of any use.  When that time comes, as long as you are not an enemy of the Xuan Tian Palace, I will gift it to you freely.”</p><p>“It seems I must become a guest elder.”</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, ceasing to worry.  If it’s unrelated to cultivation, it's not urgent. Qin Sang didn't know when he would reach the late Nascent Soul stage; he would just see what tricks Tong Lingyu was playing.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned back to examine the treasures, seemingly forgetting the matter entirely.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw his nonchalant attitude, a flicker of surprise in her eyes, and remained silent, following behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the remaining treasures; he made a show of being more curious about the few items of unknown origin and purpose, including the seven-story pagoda, acting as if he were searching for a Nascent Soul cultivator's legacy.</p><p>He didn't overdo it, lest he arouse suspicion.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang decided on his targets: the Yuan Yin Water and the seven-story pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang first used Tong Lingyu’s token to take the Yuan Yin Water, then walked to the seven-story pagoda. His gaze flickered between several items before reaching for the pagoda.</p><p>The moment he grasped the seven-story pagoda, Qin Sang keenly sensed Tong Lingyu's unusual gaze.</p><p>He knew this deception wouldn't completely allay Tong Lingyu's suspicions, but there wouldn't be a better opportunity, a quieter moment to obtain the pagoda.</p><p>This treasure vault is located deep within the Xuan Tian Palace.  Officially, only a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator guards it, but Qin Sang could sense the murderous aura of many others lurking in the shadows since their arrival at the Seventy-Two Springs.  Security is very tight.</p><p>He couldn't forcibly seize or steal it.</p><p>It would be best to take them both.  Even if Tong Lingyu had withheld information and changed her mind, Qin Sang wasn't worried.  He held another seven-story pagoda; Xuan Tian Palace couldn't escape him, no matter what they did. He deserved a share.  Xuan Tian Palace possessed vast resources; cooperation benefited both sides; there was no need for them to hoard everything.</p><p>"Heh, your choices are always so unexpected," she chuckled.</p><p>Tong Lingyu stepped forward, looking at the Yuan Yin Water and the seven-story pagoda. She expected Qin Sang to choose rare herbs or powerful artifacts.  She never imagined he'd choose these two items, gathering dust in the treasury for years.</p><p>"Out of curiosity, I used various divine abilities to test the small pagoda, but it showed no reaction.  Qin Daoist, do you know its secret?" Tong Lingyu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"The unknown represents greater possibilities. I feel it's more likely to be a Nascent Soul cultivator's relic than the others," Qin Sang said calmly, toying with the small seven-story pagoda while remaining vigilant.</p><p>Tong Lingyu looked at Qin Sang intently, hesitated for a moment, but didn't break her promise. "It seems the treasures in the treasury weren't valuable enough to catch your eye, Daoist Qin. I wish you success, and hope you discover something and unlock more secrets of Senior Xiao Xiangzi."</p><p>Qin Sang put both items away.  Seeing Tong Lingyu still staring, he chuckled inwardly, took out the sacred artifact, and handed it to her.</p><p>The sacred artifact was finally returned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took the ice box, without avoiding Qin Sang's gaze.  She held it in one hand, the other hovering above, her palm glowing with light; countless runes flickered.  In an instant, the seal on the ice box loosened, but it didn't open completely; Qin Sang still couldn't see the Ice Demon Crystal.</p><p>After a moment, Tong Lingyu's brow furrowed, and she looked up at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew she'd discovered the Ice Demon Crystal's power loss. He met her gaze calmly, appearing innocent and unconcerned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu quickly regained her composure, put away the sacred artifact, and took Qin Sang out of the treasury, flew out of Qingbai Spring, and headed south. "I've had someone prepare a dwelling for you by Coral Spring.  After your long journey, please rest for a few days."</p><p>"Thank you," Qin Sang bowed politely. "I plan to leave Xuan Tian Palace tomorrow morning and meet Liuli on Ditong Island. They're slower than us, and should be arriving soon."</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang inquired about Liuli's itinerary and learned they were going to Ditong Island to obtain Ditong Fruits.</p><p>Tong Lingyu no longer made polite excuses.  "Very well. You'll soon become a Tingxue Tower guest; we'll have plenty of time to meet again."</p><p>Soon, they arrived at Coral Spring. The spring water was crimson; as it flowed, countless coral-like images appeared within, hence the name.</p><p>After escorting Qin Sang to his dwelling, Tong Lingyu left hurriedly to return the sacred artifact to the Frozen Spring.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed his attendants and rested in the dwelling overnight. That night, he didn't take out the seven-story pagoda, only playing with the seven-story tower.</p><p>The next morning,</p><p>Qin Sang left without waiting for Tong Lingyu, leaving a note behind before departing.  With the token Tong Lingyu gave him, no one stopped him as he smoothly left Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang's vigilance eased slightly. He immediately activated his thunder wings, flying far from Xuan Tian Palace until he reached an unnamed snowy mountain.  He landed, entered the forest, and opened a cave dwelling, setting up restrictions before taking out the two small pagodas.</p><p>The two pagodas, aside from their color, were nearly identical. Even the small gourd carvings on the top were the same.  Both pagodas were translucent, revealing their pure, unblemished interiors. One felt warm to the touch; the other, icy cold.</p><p>Qin Sang observed them with his eyes, then picked up the seven-story pagoda and tried to infuse it with his true energy and spiritual sense, attempting to enter it.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang abruptly shifted his gaze, looking in surprise at the seven-story pagoda beside it.  As he touched the seven-story pagoda, the seven-story pagoda's glow changed for the first time, becoming brighter and more dazzling, illuminating the cave. If this were outside, those who saw the light would think a divine treasure had appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily continued to infuse it with true energy, but the changes to the seven-story pagoda ceased.</p><p>He then tried the seven-story pagoda, discovering that when he activated it, the small seven-story pagoda exhibited a similar phenomenon, emitting a faint blue light.</p><p>No matter what Qin Sang tried, the two pagodas didn't display any extraordinary power, only this change.</p><p>Leaving a Sky-Eyed Butterfly to watch, Qin Sang took one of the pagodas far away; the reaction was the same. The distance over which the two pagodas reacted must have been very far.</p><p>He returned to the cave, holding both pagodas, and pondered for a long time, a disheartening thought suddenly striking him.</p><p>"These… are they just communication artifacts?"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to the generous patron who has once again donated a top-tier contribution.</p><p>I am still catching up on the previous bonus chapters. I am deeply grateful for your kindness but also feel quite ashamed of my slow progress!</p>
