<h1>Chapter 1836: Pursuit and Slaughter</h1><p>A sudden, unstoppable change occurred.  </p><p>Though unsure of the nature of the fluctuation, Qin Sang sensed something was terribly wrong.</p><p>Lightning flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and charged towards the man in purple armor.</p><p>The man in purple armor was trapped in a black sea of fire, besieged by four ice serpents.</p><p>The two demons possessed only one jade bracelet, held by the shorter man.  Qin Sang's plan was to use demonic fire and the four ice serpents to restrain the man in purple armor, keeping him alive for later execution while killing the other one first.</p><p>Unfortunately, a critical oversight led to a swift reversal of the situation.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Waves of fire surged towards the man in purple armor, forming a fiery mound within the inferno.</p><p>The ice serpents thrashed, spraying freezing air.  The cold and the demonic fire, surprisingly, didn't clash, creating a bizarre spectacle.</p><p>The cold air condensed into an iceberg, with flames burning within it. The man in purple armor was trapped like a beast.</p><p>The moment he was attacked, a string of wooden beads hanging around the man's neck flew up.</p><p>The beads glowed with a golden light, their material remarkably strange.</p><p>As they ascended, every bead rapidly expanded, becoming like a string of massive stones, each imbued with the power of a mountain.</p><p>It was as if several mountain peaks were hurtling towards him.</p><p>The man in purple armor attempted to use this treasure to crash through the cold air and demonic fire.</p><p>But powerful as the beads were, they were no match for the magical artifacts, especially considering the man in purple armor's cultivation was a level below Qin Sang's.</p><p>The ice serpents locked onto the beads, unleashing a torrent of freezing air, instantly transforming the area into a frigid wasteland.  With a series of ‘crack’ sounds, the beads' surfaces quickly froze over, the ice growing thicker by the second.</p><p>The beads' glow dimmed, their momentum noticeably slowing; it seemed they would soon be completely frozen.</p><p>As the terrifying cold spread past the beads, fear etched itself onto the man's face. The purple armor flared with brilliant purple light.</p><p>His purple eyes spun, forming tiny vortexes.  Purple light, like water, expanded rapidly as it swirled.</p><p>In an instant, the vortexes separated from his pupils, spreading concentric purple ripples around him, as if trying to suck the surrounding void into them.</p><p>The vortexes centered on the four ice serpents, emitting strange power towards the freezing air.</p><p>As the vortexes continued to expand and enveloped the beads, the beads' surface shimmered with purple light. Their previously dim glow suddenly brightened, their power surging, and they smashed against the ice.</p><p>With a resounding boom, cracks appeared in the ice, but the ice serpents remained unaffected, continuing to unleash their icy breath and maintain their prison.</p><p>Simultaneously, the man in purple armor transformed into a hawk—a magnificent purple hawk with strikingly bright eyes.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The hawk spat out a mouthful of essence blood, merging it with his purple armor, fully unleashing its potential.</p><p>With a beat of its purple wings, the hawk turned into a purple streak of lightning.</p><p>The beads, bloodline abilities, essence blood infused armor, and transformation—the man in purple armor had given his all in a desperate gamble.</p><p>But he never anticipated his companion's utter helplessness; he fell in an instant.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The purple vortexes swirling in the void suddenly shuddered, their outer ripples shattering under a powerful blow.</p><p>From within the fractured ripples, a hand emerged, carrying unimaginable pressure, descending from the heavens.</p><p>At this moment, the man in purple armor's mind was shaken, his terror intensifying; it felt like the sky was collapsing, and he was the only living thing beneath it, with nowhere to escape!</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The ice serpents roared excitedly, simultaneously unleashing icy flames, erupting in blinding cold light. The boundless chill merged with the descending hand.</p><p>All the man in purple armor saw was a huge, dark blue sun, crashing down onto the beads!</p><p>Before his horrified eyes, the beads exploded, deflating and returning to their original form, scattered by the icy flames.</p><p>Then, a figure stepped out of the icy flames, instantly closing in on the man in purple armor.</p><p>Terror seized the man; in the next instant, his vision vanished, overwhelmed by the blue light, the sword light, and the overwhelmingly powerful blood energy.</p><p>In his despair, he could only desperately activate his purple armor, but to no avail.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Fragments scattered as he was pierced.</p><p>Four powerful seals, the Seven Souls Killing Formation, and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!</p><p>Qin Sang, without a moment's hesitation, unleashed all three of his most potent techniques in one concerted effort, shattering the demon's magical powers and treasures.</p><p>A tremendous roar shook the earth, sending dust and debris flying.  The purple light dissipated.</p><p>In the clearing smoke, a deep crater appeared in the ground. Qin Sang, gripping the hawk's neck with one hand, plunged it into the earth!</p><p>The hawk's eyes rolled back, its breath shallow. It wasn't dead, but completely helpless, unable even to self-destruct.</p><p>Qin Sang spared the hawk's life, his gaze fixed intently on its eyes. "Speak! What is the purpose of the energy emanating from its master's corpse!"</p><p>The hawk regained consciousness, but instead of answering, its face contorted in rage. "You dare…"</p><p>Before it could finish, Qin Sang frowned, surging his true energy into the hawk's body, locking onto its spirit.  Amidst the hawk's piercing shriek, he performed a soul-searching technique.</p><p>Soul-searching was a last resort; he wouldn't have done it if the hawk had cooperated.  The higher the opponent's cultivation, the more difficult soul-searching became.  Whether he could obtain crucial information depended entirely on luck.  The situation was urgent; he didn't have time to subdue the hawk, leaving him no choice but to resort to this method.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang withdrew his hand, his expression grim. The fragmented memories obtained through soul-searching contained a few relevant pieces, insufficient to reveal the full picture, but enough to piece together the general cause.</p><p>The energy emanating from the other demon lord's corpse was a warning signal. When they separated from Fu Hou, they had taken a jade bracelet and left a soul mark.  If the master died violently, the soul mark would immediately react and allow them to locate his position.</p><p>By killing this demon, Qin Sang had exposed himself. Fu Hou and the other demons would be on their way.</p><p>He looked up at the calm, distant mountains.  He didn't know how far away they were, but his immediate concern was escape.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of a single demon lord.  But this involved a Demon King!</p><p>From the few memory fragments, he glimpsed the reason for this pursuit.</p><p>In the hawk's memories, they had been urgently summoned by Ling Yue Wang.  Nearly all of Ling Yue Wang's elite forces had been deployed, with other demon lords joining the hunt, lured by the substantial reward.</p><p>Someone had infiltrated Ling Yue Wang's territory and done something to enrage him, leading to this relentless pursuit.  Furthermore, Ling Yue Wang had recently fought a Daoist cultivator in the Nueyuan wasteland – another powerful cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage – possibly a person who had aided the intruder.</p><p>Unfortunately, the memory fragments concerning this battle were too brief.  The outcome of the clash between the two powerful cultivators remained unclear, but the demons' pursuit suggested that Ling Yue Wang had likely gained the upper hand.</p><p>Learning this, Qin Sang became even more anxious.  He couldn't know if his actions would attract the Demon King. He could only hope Ling Yue Wang was still entangled with the Daoist cultivator.</p><p>He had to escape! But how?  Unbeknownst to him, he had stumbled into an encirclement, with demon lords scattered around him.</p><p>This was a completely undeserved disaster, Qin Sang lamented, his biggest worry being the soul mark's other possible functions, such as sensing the presence of its enemies.</p><p>"This started in Ling Yue Wang's territory, unrelated to the Jushan altar. The area around the altar should be safe…"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.  Turning back was impossible. He had originally worried about the conflict between the Dao Court and Gui Fang kingdom over the altar, believing Nascent Soul cultivators would be guarding it, making a return impossible. As long as he didn't involve the Jushan altar, he had a way out.</p><p>His only option was to flee to the altar, ensuring his absolute safety.  Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't dare enter the altar, so he wouldn't fear any number of pursuing demon lords.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang considered all possibilities and made his decision. His demonic flames erupted, engulfing everything around him to obscure his tracks. He then grabbed the hawk, soared into the air, and fled northeast – toward the Jushan altar.</p><p>During the soul-searching, Qin Sang had held back, preserving the hawk's remaining soul – it would still be useful.</p><p>Using his thunder escape technique at only a third of his power, Qin Sang made no attempt at concealment.  A lightning bolt pierced the sky, its thunder echoing through the mountains, but quickly fading into silence.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang's departure, a streak of light pierced the air, landing at the edge of the battlefield, revealing three figures.  The central figure, with a prominent nose bridge, a bald head, a high forehead, and long, drooping ears, possessed an unusual appearance. It was Fu Hou, Ling Yue Wang's foremost demon lord.</p><p>"This is where Scorpion-Hou fell," Fu-Hou said, his eyes cold.  The scene was chaotic, but the lingering void fluctuations confirmed that no Grand Master had been involved.</p><p>One of his companions whispered, "The Listening Bracelet was on Scorpion-Hou.  The bracelet shattered after his death.  Was it the enemy who crushed it? Did Scorpion-Hou not have time, or was there another reason?"</p><p>Fu-Hou surveyed the battlefield. "Is Purple-Hou still alive?"</p><p>The companion nodded. "The soul mark indicates Purple-Hou is in the northeast, constantly moving…"</p><p>He hesitated. "Could it be that the two Daoists were careless during the hunt, and were ambushed? Perhaps Purple-Hou is pursuing the killer?"</p><p>Fu-Hou snorted coldly. "Scorpion-Hou was always cautious.  He wouldn't risk a battle unless victory was certain. Purple-Hou must have been captured. The killer's strength is formidable.  They likely know the secret of the soul mark and deliberately took Purple-Hou away, surely with ulterior motives!"</p><p>"My lord is wise!"</p><p>The companion prostrated himself, feigning thought. "As my lord surmises, the killer is using Purple-Hou as bait to lure us, then escaping in another direction? Purple-Hou is heading towards the Juju Mountain Altar. Logically, we'd assume the killer is seeking refuge there… Thankfully, my lord's insight is unparalleled, otherwise we would have fallen for the trap!"</p><p>"Whether bait or not, we must rescue Purple-Hou first! Send word to Daoists Gu and Ying to gather their men, and seal off the other directions. The killer must not escape!"</p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p>Fu-Hou committed every detail of the battlefield to memory, then vanished in a rainbow-like streak of speed, heading in the direction indicated by the soul mark.  The two demons followed.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang moved silently through the wilderness, concealing his aura.  His speed wasn't comparable to lightning-fast escape techniques, but it was still swift.</p><p>After flying over a mountain range, Qin Sang stopped and released a black dog, one of the remaining puppets.</p><p>He ordered the dog to carry the dying hawk, then continued his flight.</p><p>The black dog, carrying the hawk, ran in a slightly different direction than Qin Sang's, heading northeast, as if testing its master's orders.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t look back, quickly disappearing from view.</p><p>Soon, Fu-Hou arrived, spotting the black dog. A single glance froze the dog, but the potent poison in its mouth instantly erupted.</p><p>The hawk's soul was poisoned to death.</p><p>Fu-Hou tried everything to save the hawk, but could glean no useful information from the dog. His killing intent intensified.</p><p>The two demons behind him, straining to keep up, saw Fu-Hou's expression and trembled. "Daoists Gu and Ying have laid a net, tightening the circle. If the killer tries to escape from these directions, they'll have nowhere to hide!"</p><p>Fu-Hou surveyed his surroundings. The encirclement was closing from the north, leaving only two gaps: north and northeast.</p><p>When had the killer separated from Purple-Hou? Where had they truly escaped to?</p><p>Based on his earlier deduction, he should pursue them to the north.</p><p>But was the hawk truly just a diversion? What if the killer anticipated their strategy?</p><p>The hawk had clearly been soul-searched, and the killer's intentions were unfathomable.  Either choice was possible.</p><p>Fu-Hou glanced at the altar, ultimately deciding to chase north himself.</p><p>The altar was always guarded, and he'd sent reinforcements there, enough to delay pursuit.</p><p>However, if the killer went north, there was a chance of breaking the encirclement!</p><p>Having made his decision, Fu-Hou immediately set off.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was nearing the altar.</p><p>Familiar scenery came into view; the area ahead was calm.</p><p>Beneath the surface, there might be hidden danger, but Qin Sang still breathed a sigh of relief; there were no unusual celestial phenomena near the altar.</p><p>The Demon King wasn’t here!</p><p>As he approached, he used his celestial vision to detect several hidden auras.</p><p>An ambush, as expected.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised. He'd anticipated it.</p><p>The altar was the ideal hiding place; these demons certainly had prepared a defense.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected an easy path. Leaving the hawk behind forced them to split their forces, weakening the defenses here.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang burst from the forest, his phoenix wings unleashing a thunderbolt that ripped through the void, charging towards the auspicious clouds!</p><p>The moment Qin Sang appeared, several powerful auras erupted from the valley outside the altar.</p><p>One was particularly strong, a late-stage Nascent Soul demon!</p><p>This demon, surpassing the others, sped towards Qin Sang, shouting, "Halt!"</p><p>In flight, Qin Sang saw his enemy: a delicate woman, with average but pleasant features, wearing light armor; her aura was comparable to Xia Hou's.</p><p>The other demons were insignificant.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the others. With his strength, he could entangle the woman and perhaps kill more, but he wouldn't risk his life.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The two were like colliding comets, about to crash, when a terrifying crimson light suddenly erupted from the lightning.</p><p>The female demon saw nine solar birds flying towards her, her expression changing.  She slowed down, hurriedly using her powers to defend, dodging repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang, ignoring her, increased his speed by a third, directly heading for the altar.</p><p>The path was clear.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang relaxed slightly, a cold snort rang out, and terrifying pressure instantly descended.</p><p>Qin Sang's blood felt like it was freezing, his hair standing on end.  He looked up in shock.</p><p>He saw dark clouds gathering in the southern sky, a colossal shadow appearing in the clouds, covering the sun!</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
