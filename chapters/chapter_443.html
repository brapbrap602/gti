<h1>Chapter 436: Retreat</h1><p>Chapter 436: Retreat</p><p>Mu Yifeng was even more astonished than those on the boat.</p><p>He clearly remembered that when they last parted, Qin Sang was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment. Now, her cultivation was comparable to his, and even more frighteningly powerful.</p><p>She had slain a cultivator of the same level with a single strike!</p><p>After a brief moment of shock, Mu Yifeng realized that this wasn't the time for such thoughts. He quickly sent a voice transmission to Qin Sang, briefly explaining the enemy on the boat, then turned without hesitation, his escape light unwavering, flying with all his might.</p><p>He was too weak to fight anymore; staying would only hinder Qin Sang and make her hesitant to act.</p><p>Qin Sang remained submerged, unseen. Seeing Mu Yifeng's actions, she silently praised him and gazed at the distant water.</p><p>From Mu Yifeng, she learned that there were seven people on the boat.</p><p>Two were at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, requiring Qin Sang's attention. One was the owner of the covered boat, the man standing at the bow.</p><p>The other was injured; Qin Sang had seen someone meditating at the stern, and assumed it was him.</p><p>Before Qin Sang encountered them, Mu Yifeng had already fought a major battle with the Tianxing League cultivators.</p><p>Of course, Mu Yifeng wasn't alone during the battle; otherwise, he couldn't have lasted so long. But now, he was the only one left.</p><p>One of his companions was a senior brother from Shaohua Mountain, named Kuang Yi, whom Qin Sang had heard of.</p><p>Kuang Yi's cultivation was slightly stronger than Mu Yifeng's. Unfortunately, he was entangled in the battle and, seeing no hope of escape, fought desperately, killing several and severely wounding one late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, allowing Mu Yifeng to escape.</p><p>Besides the two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, the remaining five had varying levels of cultivation, but they were well-coordinated, advancing and retreating in order. It wouldn't be easy to escape if entangled by them.</p><p>Fortunately, the Tianxing League cultivators also paid a heavy price, leaving only these few, almost all wounded and significantly weakened.</p><p>Qin Sang kept her gaze fixed on the distant covered boat, secretly using her escape technique to slowly retreat. Before leaving, she used her spiritual energy to gather the corpses' storage pouches, taking the spoils of war.</p><p>The covered boat stopped.</p><p>The sky and water blended seamlessly.</p><p>A lone boat, quietly floating on the gem-like clear lake, presented a scene of tranquility and beauty.</p><p>Everyone on the boat, including the two who were meditating, stood up, their expressions unusually grave, staring ahead, their eyes filled with deep horror.</p><p>The vast expanse of water stretched endlessly.  They could faintly see where the two halves of the bodies had fallen, a patch of lake water stained crimson.</p><p>The blood spread, quickly diluted to the point of invisibility.</p><p>A deathly silence hung in the air.</p><p>"Brother Luo, that strike…the sword flashed like lightning, accompanied by divine thunder. Could it be…?"</p><p>A young man in a long robe, recalling the astonishing scene, swallowed, his voice hoarse. He subconsciously looked at the man in a green robe standing at the bow.</p><p>This man was his senior brother, surnamed Luo.</p><p>After stopping the covered boat, Mr. Luo kept his gaze fixed ahead. The covered boat was a magic weapon of a Qing Shan cultivator, controlled by him. Since stopping, he had remained motionless.</p><p>Those behind him couldn't see his expression, and didn't know what he was thinking.</p><p>Hearing the long-robed youth's words, the others’ expressions shifted, their gazes focused on him.</p><p>A quick-witted person immediately thought of something and exclaimed, "Sword Qi Thunder Sound! Brother Sun, do you mean Sword Qi Thunder Sound?!"</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone's faces changed.</p><p>Sword Qi Thunder Sound, the ultimate swordsmanship pursued by sword cultivators!</p><p>Sun and Luo's sect excelled in swordsmanship. In the past hundred years, only one Nascent Soul cultivator in their sect had successfully attained Sword Qi Thunder Sound, gaining quite a reputation within the Tianxing League.</p><p>"How could it be Sword Qi Thunder Sound?  Could it be that a Golden Core cultivator from Xiaohan Domain has arrived?"</p><p>Someone cried out in horror.</p><p>Uproar erupted on the covered boat.</p><p>If a Golden Core cultivator had arrived, they would surely die. Even if they tried to escape now, it would be futile!</p><p>"Could it be that they used thunder techniques combined with swordsmanship to mimic Sword Qi Thunder Sound?"</p><p>"Brother Sun, are you sure you saw it clearly?"</p><p>…</p><p>At this time, a man in white, who had been protected in the center, stepped forward, looking at Mr. Luo's back, and asked in a deep voice, "Daoist Luo, I was meditating and didn't see clearly…what did you see? Was it truly Sword Qi Thunder Sound?"</p><p>Mr. Luo let out a long breath before turning around. His expression was strange, showing a mixture of relief and envy.</p><p>"It was indeed Sword Qi Thunder Sound! I have witnessed my uncle demonstrate it, but…"</p><p>Mr. Luo shook his head slightly.  "But it wasn't a Golden Core cultivator. This person's swordsmanship was indeed formidable, killing Daoist Wu with one strike, but they weren't a Golden Core cultivator! That same strike was far less terrifying than my uncle's."</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to ambush us, hiding in the shadows... This person must be a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"</p><p>Not Golden Core!</p><p>Everyone's expressions relaxed slightly, but then turned to even greater surprise,</p><p>"A Foundation Establishment cultivator who has mastered Sword Qi and Thunder Sound? This... even in legends, few have achieved this..."</p><p>The man surnamed Luo nodded, saying with some envy, "In my sect, only one incredibly talented senior ever reached this level.  Unfortunately, that senior had mixed spiritual roots and ultimately stopped at the Fake Golden Core stage!"</p><p>"Even if he's not Golden Core, don't let your guard down!"</p><p>The man surnamed Luo warned sternly, "You all saw the power of that strike; Wu Dao You was completely defenseless!  The terror of Sword Qi and Thunder Sound needs no explanation from me; otherwise, it wouldn't fascinate countless sword cultivators.  Everyone, summon your magical tools, support each other, and absolutely do not get separated; don't give him a chance to strike!"</p><p>Everyone understood the gravity of the situation, huddled together, obeyed the orders, summoned their magical tools for defense, heightened their vigilance to the extreme, and watched the seemingly calm waters with wary eyes.</p><p>The man in white didn't dare to be careless; he summoned a flying sword, suspending it in front of him, but secretly sent a voice transmission to the man surnamed Luo, "Dao You Luo, that person's strength is unfathomable, and he's skilled in cunning tactics. The enemy is in the dark, we are in the light; this will be difficult to handle."</p><p>The man surnamed Luo's eyes flashed, "What do you mean, Dao You?"</p><p>"The seniors only told us to pursue and kill, to prevent them from seeking reinforcements. They didn't say we had to annihilate them.  Now our team has suffered such heavy casualties, even Wu Dao You has unfortunately perished—a first—we can't throw away everyone's lives here, can we? What do you think, Dao You Luo?"</p><p>From the man in white's words, the man surnamed Luo knew he was considering retreat.</p><p>An opponent who has mastered Sword Qi and Thunder Sound, capable of killing a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, hiding in the shadows and watching intently, was indeed unsettling.</p><p>"Dao You is right. We have already killed several, and delayed them for so long. Returning now, we can still account for ourselves to the seniors..."</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Luo nodded slightly, tapped his foot, and the covered boat turned and sped away, cutting through the waves.</p>
