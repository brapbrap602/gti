<h1>Chapter 388: Refining Corpse Qi</h1><p>Chapter 388: Refining Corpse Qi</p><p>According to Qin Sang's knowledge, the first half of the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual* details the creation of three types of corpses.</p><p>The first, a common zombie, can be made from the bodies of ordinary zombies, Qi Condensation stage cultivators, or Foundation Establishment cultivators with damaged dantians. This is the weakest type.</p><p>The second, a煞尸 (sha shi), requires the body of a Foundation Establishment cultivator with an undamaged dantian.  A new foundation is built using five types of Yin materials, and then earth煞 (sha) energy is introduced into the body. This is one of the biggest differences from other corpse refinement methods.</p><p>The requirements for a活尸 (huo shi) are far more complex.</p><p>First, the Tian Corpse Talisman is used to suppress the soul.  A multiple of five Yin materials stabilizes the dantian, and earth煞 energy is forcefully introduced.  The difficulty lies in doing this without damaging the dantian and preserving the spiritual energy within the huo shi's dantian. The failure rate is extremely high.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had just learned the secret method of creating a Flying Night Rakshasa from Wu Shang's notes.</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>A活尸 must be created from a Foundation Establishment cultivator who has reached the peak of their cultivation and attained the pseudo-Golden Core stage. Then, using secret techniques and earth煞 energy, a Golden Core or demon core is refined into the body, causing a transformation into a corpse-dan.</p><p>Wu Shang, being a disciple of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, was very familiar with the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*.  After making his decision, he made thorough preparations, including psychological ones.</p><p>Transforming himself into a活尸 would involve two significant changes.</p><p>First, his soul would merge with the Tian Corpse Talisman, resulting in unknown changes.</p><p>Second, his body would become a corpse, especially after the introduction of earth煞 energy.</p><p>Having decided to take this unconventional path, using the corpse path to achieve immortality, Wu Shang had already prepared himself to give up his physical body. As long as his consciousness remained, it was still him, even if his body turned into a corpse.</p><p>The Tian Corpse Talisman can transform others into活尸. But what if it was used on oneself?</p><p>Wu Shang collected numerous elixirs, secret techniques, and magical artifacts that could strengthen the soul and protect the consciousness. Then, he spent all his wealth preparing everything needed for corpse refinement, including a demon core.</p><p>The refinement of a活尸 doesn't have strict requirements for Golden Cores or demon cores; being intact is sufficient.</p><p>No one knows if, since the creation of the Tian Corpse Talisman, any Heavenly Corpse Sect ancestor was mad enough to use it on themselves.</p><p>In short, there are no such records in the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Wu Shang knew he was the first.</p><p>The Tian Corpse Talisman merged with his soul.</p><p>Wu Shang discovered that the talisman did have an effect, but because he had refined the talisman himself, and his modifications to the secret technique's restrictions also worked, as long as he didn't actively erase his consciousness, it wouldn't be lost immediately, and he wouldn't become a mindless corpse.</p><p>He felt a bit drowsy, indicating the talisman's effect on his soul.</p><p>Complete assimilation by the talisman was inevitable. However, this change was gradual and would take time. And some of his preparations were indeed effective, buying him more time.</p><p>What he would become in the end, Wu Shang didn't know.</p><p>Perhaps, after his transformation into a Flying Night Rakshasa, a surge in power might allow him to find a solution.</p><p>The changes to his body were as he expected. Before the introduction of earth煞 energy, he could resist the corpse transformation by consuming the refined blood of other Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Once the煞 energy entered his body, the rate of corpse transformation would rapidly accelerate, and no method could stop it.</p><p>After the煞 energy entered his body, he quickly gave up resistance and became a genuine corpse.</p><p>Of course, Wu Shang didn't mind.</p><p>Instead, he was relieved, because his consciousness remained, leaving a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Next, Wu Shang immediately began the next stage of transformation.</p><p>Integrating the demon core to become a Flying Night Rakshasa!</p><p>He actually succeeded, becoming a corpse of the Golden Core level.</p><p>Inspecting his body, the corpse-dan, stained black as ink by the煞 energy, rested in his dantian, under his complete control.</p><p>This was his 'Golden Core'!</p><p>This was the power of the Golden Core stage!</p><p>Such a sight was intoxicating.</p><p>Just as Wu Shang was overjoyed, he was horrified to discover that the corpse-dan was continuously releasing earth煞 energy, which was actually attacking his soul!</p><p>Actually, even when he was still a活尸 and the煞 energy was introduced, there were already such signs, but it was short-lived.  Wu Shang hadn't paid much attention, thinking that after forming the corpse-dan, he would possess Golden Core level strength and be able to suppress the earth煞 energy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not only did the corpse-dan fail to suppress it, it intensified.</p><p>He had not lost his consciousness due to the Tian Corpse Talisman, but under the continuous erosion of the earth煞 energy, his sanity began to be affected, gradually becoming frenzied.</p><p>If this continued, he would soon completely lose his sanity and become a mindless corpse!</p><p>This sudden change immediately shocked Wu Shang.</p><p>Time was running out, and Wu Shang desperately sought a way to counteract the earth煞 energy.</p><p>Having transformed into the Flying Night Rakshasa, his power surged.  Many previously unattainable treasures became easily obtainable.</p><p>He had consumed various elixirs, tried countless orthodox and heretical secret techniques, practiced the Righteous Path's Shao Yang methods, and even cultivated earthfire essence into his body…</p><p>Wu Shang tried countless methods, but none were effective against the Earthly Fiend Qi, or were simply not powerful enough to withstand its assault.</p><p>Finally, Wu Shang suddenly remembered something, an extremely Yang-attributed treasure as renowned as the Earthly Fiend Qi itself: the Qian Tian Gang Qi!</p><p>Perhaps, by introducing the Qian Tian Gang Qi into his body, he could neutralize the Earthly Fiend Qi.</p><p>Both the Earthly Fiend Qi and the Qian Tian Gang Qi are extraordinary treasures born from the spiritual essence of Heaven and Earth, representing ultimate Yin and Yang, incredibly volatile and destructive.  Ordinary cultivators wouldn't dare to approach them, let alone introduce them into their bodies, especially both at once.</p><p>A single mistake would result in body explosion.</p><p>Wu Shang pondered deeply, gradually finding a solution, feeling a surge of hope.</p><p>However, by then, Wu Shang's mind was increasingly eroded, his time running out. He was too weak to seek the Qian Tian Gang Qi to experiment, and had to find spiritual herbs first to refine his primordial spirit.</p><p>Thus, Wu Shang came to this place, seeking the Nightfall Lily.</p><p>Sadly, Wu Shang was already at his wit's end. His primordial spirit was almost completely consumed by the Earthly Fiend Qi, his faint consciousness unable to hold on.</p><p>In this ice cave, his consciousness collapsed, and he transformed into the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>On the brink of death, Wu Shang was filled with regret, unwilling to see his painstaking research vanish silently in this desolate ice cave.</p><p>In his final moments, he left a message on the ice wall, engraving his name!</p><p>The increasingly messy writing on the ice wall is understandable, as Wu Shang was on the verge of madness, clinging to his last ounce of willpower.</p><p>In his message, Wu Shang detailed the secret technique he hadn't been able to personally try, which he called—"凝煞炼罡" (Congealing Fiend Refining Gang).</p><p>And finally, with all his remaining strength, he planted a lingering thought within the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Because of this lingering thought, the Flying Night Rakshasa remained here, and upon sensing the aura of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within the living corpses, did not strike them down.</p><p>"To future generations of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, if you find this message, take it from this place.</p><p>"If you aspire to greatness, you may attempt my secret technique to condense the Corpse Pill.</p><p>"Will you remain trapped at the Foundation Establishment stage, growing old and dying?</p><p>"Or will you take a desperate gamble, contend with Heaven, devote yourself to the Corpse Dao, and strive for immortality, to glimpse the scenery of the Golden Core stage?</p><p>"The choice is yours."</p>
