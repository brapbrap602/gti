<h1>Chapter 789: Breakthrough</h1><p>Chapter 789: Breakthrough</p><p>Qin Sang never truly had a master.</p><p>The one who guided him most was Yun Youzi, a mentor and friend, but after being sent to the Canglang Sea, they were separated by thousands of miles, and hadn't seen each other for decades.</p><p>Especially in swordsmanship, Qin Sang had always been self-taught.  He had never encountered such a dedicated teacher.</p><p>This teacher always managed to pinpoint his weaknesses.</p><p>Thanks to his cultivation technique, Qin Sang independently mastered Sword Qi Thunder Sound, but lacking guidance, the process was lengthy, and his understanding of Sword Light Divergence progressed slowly.</p><p>However, the lengthy process wasn't without benefit; without that experience, he wouldn't have improved so quickly now.</p><p>Now that he's met a master, it’s a testament to his hard work.</p><p>Qin Sang re-entered the passage. He hadn't fully recovered.</p><p>Blades are unforgiving; the swordsmen wouldn't kill him, but injuries were unavoidable, especially the last few battles, leaving several wounds on Qin Sang.</p><p>He took some pills to suppress his injuries, and walked in without looking back.</p><p>This was an invaluable opportunity, time was limited, and he had to grasp as much as possible before the Seven Killing Hall closed.</p><p>Re-entering the passage, the familiar blue light descended, and the swordsmen appeared.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang was experienced; he didn't rush to defeat the swordsmen, but instead cleared his mind, forgetting everything, and understanding the sword through battle.</p><p>He was defeated again and again, returning to the passage each time.</p><p>Qin Sang's wounds multiplied, but he ignored them, wiping away the blood, taking pills, and charging back into the passage, hungrily absorbing everything.</p><p>His swordsmanship was rapidly improving.</p><p>Now, his swordsmanship was no longer confined to any specific style; he could act freely, using the most suitable move at will, reaching a certain level of mastery.</p><p>If he wished to delve deeper, he had the potential to create his own sword style.</p><p>Previously, he could only use Sword Qi Thunder Sound as a surprise attack, lacking variation; now, it had improved; his flying sword was unpredictable, wearing down his opponents.</p><p>This wasn't even what pleased Qin Sang the most.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel he was getting closer and closer to Sword Light Divergence!</p><p>……</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>A burst of unrestrained laughter suddenly echoed through the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang stood tall at the passage entrance, his ebony sword hovering before him.</p><p>As Qin Sang willed it, the ebony sword trembled slightly, splitting into a beam of sword light, but immediately afterward, a faint, ethereal sword shadow slowly emerged!</p><p>This flickering shadow was the nascent form of Sword Light Divergence!</p><p>"As long as I don't compare myself to that freak, Senior Qingzhu, my talent isn't so bad!  Even among those Nascent Soul stage sword cultivators, few have mastered Sword Light Divergence…"</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curved into a smile.</p><p>He hadn't expected that after countless battles, a flash of insight would allow him to grasp Sword Light Divergence on the spot.</p><p>However, he knew that while those swordsmen played a role in this significant progress, the *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter* was also indispensable.</p><p>Although it was just the embryonic form of a sword shadow, as the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Qin Sang believed that it wouldn't be long before he could split into true sword lights, allowing him to potentially defeat opponents of a higher level with just his sword!</p><p>Legend says top-tier sword cultivators can fight ten thousand.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have such grand ambitions; as long as he became stronger, he would be satisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his ebony sword, looking confidently at the depths of the passage.</p><p>He could easily defeat his former self.</p><p>Within the passage, he could surely go much further.</p><p>This time, instead of rushing, he sat cross-legged, cultivating and healing, adjusting his condition to its peak, his gaze darkening as he re-entered the passage.</p><p>Opponents who had previously felt formidable were now no longer a major challenge.</p><p>Qin Sang smoothly reached the point he'd reached before, easily defeating the swordsmen. He glanced at the place he'd been defeated before, and strode onward.</p><p>But soon, Qin Sang encountered trouble.</p><p>The swordsmen were also growing stronger.</p><p>Later, every battle was a fierce struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was firm, fixed on the end of the passage, pressing forward step by step, using all his strength to fight the swordsmen.</p><p>Finally… he saw what was at the end of the passage.</p><p>There was no stone gate, no altar, but a stone staircase leading upward, the light dim, only four steps visible, polished to an exceptional smoothness.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped resisting, being transported back to the passage entrance. He stared into the darkness, lost in thought.</p><p>He was curious where the staircase led. Whatever was there, he had to go; even if there wasn't a teleportation array, it must be related to the *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>Then he looked at where Senior Qingzhu had left the jade slip.</p><p>“If the stone steps lead to the ancient teleportation array, has Elder Qingzhu already returned to Xiaohan Domain?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, unsure.</p><p>Lacking knowledge of Elder Qingzhu's life, he could only speculate.  Finding out about Elder Qingzhu's past through Linggui Island might help.</p><p>Currently, forcing his way through was impossible.</p><p>Even with all his strength, Qin Sang had only made it halfway.  He estimated that the final guardian swordsman's cultivation was comparable to a peak late-Nascent Soul cultivator, possessing top-tier swordsmanship and immense combat power.</p><p>He would have to face two top experts simultaneously.</p><p>This presented a dilemma.  He understood the swordsmen's strength; even if he successfully broke through to the peak late-Nascent Soul stage, his chances of victory wouldn't be high next time.</p><p>Furthermore, he still didn't know how to solve the problem with the ebony sword, and his cultivation might stagnate at any time.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Suddenly remembering something, Qin Sang hurriedly took out a jade slip—the one left by Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>He looked at the *Cultivating the Yuan Demon Fetus*, a demonic cultivation technique, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>Could Elder Qingzhu's leaving this particular technique behind hold a deeper meaning?</p><p>The demonic body, an external avatar, was refined using a sword spirit. The passage's restriction didn't seal the ebony sword; could it be because of the sword spirit that it allowed the external avatar to enter?</p><p>With a peak late-Nascent Soul external avatar, he would have a significantly better chance.</p><p>Reaching a decision, Qin Sang acted immediately.</p><p>Regardless of the odds, it was worth the gamble. Refining an external avatar wouldn't hurt, and even if his guess was wrong, he'd gain a powerful asset.</p><p>He lingered in the passage a while longer, finally bowing in respect to the swordsmen, as a gesture of gratitude for their guidance.</p><p>“A single path of swords, and it brings me such great opportunity, understanding the branching of sword light…ancient cultivators, Qisha Hall…”</p><p>Qin Sang emerged, gazing up at the stone wall with yearning.</p><p>Looking around, he wasn't sure where to go next.</p><p>His gains were considerable. Although he hadn't found the teleportation array, discovering the clues left by Elder Qingzhu and this passage that might lead to it was exhilarating.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his jade token, realizing he had spent too long in the passage cultivating his swordsmanship and was nearing his departure time.</p><p>In such a short time, finding anything of significance in the Heavenly Tower was virtually impossible.</p>
