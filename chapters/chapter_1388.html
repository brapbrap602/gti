<h1>Chapter 1380: The Hundred Flowers Valley Agreement</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist is truly courageous!"</p><p>When Elder Feng heard that Qin Sang had crossed over from the nearby storm belt, he couldn't help but admire him.</p><p>Qin Sang humbly said, "This poor Daoist obtained a spirit medicine that can rapidly restore true essence, so I dared to try it. Being able to pass through the storm belt was truly fortunate; looking back now, that action was too reckless!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the value of the Moon Gazing Rhino Horn was even greater than he had anticipated, especially for Nascent Soul cultivators. Golden Core cultivators are limited by their cultivation and cannot go too far, but Nascent Souls can go to many more places.</p><p>He didn't want to expose the Moon Gazing Rhino Horn, attributing his success to a nonexistent spirit medicine.</p><p>Elder Feng didn't doubt him and changed his tone to ask about Qin Sang's injuries.</p><p>"Fortunately, it didn't damage my foundation... It was Fellow Daoist Feng who scared away the Bifang at that time, wasn't it?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He had already learned that the one-legged divine bird pursuing him was called Bifang, commanding countless demon soldiers and entrenched between the Star Sand Archipelago and the Crescent Realm.</p><p>The little fox, named Jiao Hu (Crafty Fox), was inseparable from Bifang, full of schemes, and had always been Elder Feng's major headache.</p><p>The other frog-fish's origins were unknown; it was probably a helper that Bifang had invited from elsewhere.</p><p>Elder Feng smiled and nodded, "Indeed, Feng and Fellow Daoist Shen happened to be nearby and were alarmed by Fellow Daoist's flying momentum. By the way! Fellow Daoist Shen is the Island Lord of Tianwai Island (Island Beyond the Heavens). Although his cultivation is one level lower than you and me, his strength is extraordinary, far surpassing those of the same rank. You'll know when Fellow Daoist sees Fellow Daoist Shen take action in the future."</p><p>Island Lord of Tianwai Island.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced; he remembered this person, a famous Nascent Soul cultivator who dominated Tianwai Island with a formidable reputation.</p><p>Remembering that Qin Sang had just arrived,</p><p>Elder Feng patiently and meticulously introduced Island Lord Shen to Qin Sang, as well as the other two Nascent Souls.</p><p>The female cultivator with the phoenix coronet was Madam Yue, the Sect Master of the Yin Moon Sect (Sect of the Shadowy Moon), and her strength was equally high, a heroine not inferior to men.</p><p>The black-shirted knight called himself Laiqu Ke (Guest of Coming and Going) and was a guest elder of Fengyang Mountain (Mountain of the Wind and Sun).</p><p>"The Demon Kings are stirring up trouble everywhere, and all of you fellow Daoists have come out of seclusion. Has something major happened recently?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>According to the information he had gathered, Fengyang Mountain had assembled a large army, seemingly just to deal with the demon race's incursions.</p><p>Elder Feng replied, "The demon race has already devoured most of the Star Sand Archipelago and is still not satisfied, always ready to make a move. Over the years, the demon race has repeatedly launched offensives, and we should have been accustomed to it. However, this time is different from the past. Our connection with the Star Sand Archipelago was severed first, so we are so cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang understood, pondering to himself.</p><p>The situation in the nearby seas has always been extremely complex. There is a blood feud between the two races, and they have fought countless times. This time, however, they have mobilized so much manpower, so the scale of this war is probably far greater than before.</p><p>If a great war is about to break out, he should leave as soon as possible and travel elsewhere.</p><p>He can't go to the Star Sand Archipelago for the time being; he will travel south along the Crescent Realm.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, Elder Feng glanced at him and smiled, "Fellow Daoist Mingyue, are you interested in showing off your skills? With Fellow Daoist's strength, if you and I join forces and use some strategy, we have a great chance of killing this fiend Bifang! To vent some of your anger!"</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of tea and asked strangely, "This poor Daoist was able to escape danger thanks to the help of you two fellow Daoists, so I should stay and contribute. However, in a war between the two races, the role this poor Daoist can play alone is limited. Why doesn't Fellow Daoist send a message out as soon as possible to warn other fellow Daoists? Are they just letting Fellow Daoist bear the grievances of the two races alone?"</p><p>The timescale of wars in the cultivation world is not just measured in 'years.'</p><p>Don't you see, the war in the three regions of the Beichen Realm lasted for two hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang was traveling alone outside, originally without any attachments, and he was unwilling to be trapped in one place, risking his life for irrelevant people.</p><p>Elder Feng explained, "If it develops to the point of a war between the two races, other fellow Daoists will naturally not stand idly by. Before that, Feng needs to first distinguish the situation clearly, so as not to send out a warning only for the demon race to be bluffing. Fellow Daoist, rest assured, Fellow Daoist Shen and the others are trying to contact the fellow Daoists in the Star Sand Archipelago. It won't be long before we can see the demon race's intentions clearly and plan accordingly. In the meantime, we need to guard against the demon race's schemes and tricks. I'm worried that there are not enough people and that there are loopholes in the defense line that the demon race will take advantage of."</p><p>Qin Sang showed a hesitant expression.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, he said, "Since Fellow Daoist Feng has spoken, this poor Daoist has no important matters, and it wouldn't hurt to guard a defense line for a while. However... although this poor Daoist was chased, I suffered no substantial losses. It would be good to get rid of my enemy, but even if I don't have a chance to take revenge, I wouldn't care too much."</p><p>Elder Feng understood what Qin Sang meant; he would only lend a hand within the limits of his strength.</p><p>Which of them hadn't cultivated to this realm while being burdened with grievances?</p><p>If they remembered every grudge they made, their state of mind would have collapsed long ago.</p><p>Tapping his finger lightly on the table, Elder Feng pondered for a moment and said, "I heard that Fellow Daoist Mingyue is looking for insect-controlling secret techniques and is very interested in the Hundred Flowers Valley's *Chonghua Jing* (Insect Flower Sutra)?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking at Elder Feng.</p><p>"There are only a few cultivators who are proficient in the art of insect control, and the Hundred Flowers Valley is second to none. If Fellow Daoist practices this art and can get guidance from the Valley Lord of the Hundred Flowers Valley, you will definitely improve greatly. Unfortunately, the Hundred Flowers Valley has always been mysterious and acts strangely, rarely contacting the outside world. If Fellow Daoist wants to befriend the Valley Lord of the Hundred Flowers Valley, you will definitely have to go to great lengths."</p><p>Elder Feng regretted, feeling sorry for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the hidden meaning, "Does Fellow Daoist Feng have a way?"</p><p>Elder Feng revealed a smile, "Indeed, when Feng traveled outside, I formed a small friendship with the Valley Lord of the Hundred Flowers Valley. If Feng acts as an intermediary, as long as Fellow Daoist Qin's requirements are not too excessive, the Valley Lord of the Hundred Flowers Valley should give Feng some face. If Fellow Daoist doesn't believe me, Feng can swear an oath with a Heart Demon."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>Regardless of whether the Hundred Flowers Valley was as strange as Elder Feng said, it would be difficult for him, a stranger, to suddenly visit and get the other party to drop their guard.</p><p>If he could invite Elder Feng, things would be much easier.</p><p>"In case the situation is critical..."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could explain, Elder Feng waved his hand and said, "Fellow Daoist, rest assured, if things cannot be done, Feng will not put my life here!"</p><p>"Then this poor Daoist will respectfully accept your offer!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded lightly, agreeing.</p><p>Elder Feng was overjoyed and took the initiative to swear that, regardless of whether this result was a victory or a defeat, he would keep his promise and help Qin Sang with the introduction after the matter was over.</p><p>A collaboration was reached in a few words.</p><p>Elder Feng and Qin Sang immediately left Fengyang Mountain and flew towards the nameless island.</p><p>After landing on the island, Qin Sang greeted the other three one by one.</p><p>The five Nascent Soul cultivators took out a topographical map and discussed it for a while, deciding to have Qin Sang guard a place called Shouxin Island (Hunting Star Island).</p><p>Shouxin Island was located in the northwestern part of the Crescent Horn, between several defense lines, and was a more important checkpoint.</p><p>Qin Sang took the token and communication treasures and took the first step, rushing to Shouxin Island.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's figure disappear into the horizon.</p><p>Elder Feng and the others restrained their expressions and looked at each other.</p><p>The female cultivator with the phoenix coronet asked in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist Feng didn't tell him about the traitor from the Xuan Heavenly Palace?"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Things are coming in bunches, and I can't stay idle at home on weekends. The next chapter will probably be as late as yesterday, so everyone can read it tomorrow morning.</p>
