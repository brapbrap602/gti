<h1>Chapter 1250: A Calculated Trap</h1><p>Chapter 1250: A Calculated Trap</p><p>Qin Sang, though free from the tribulation of inner demons, felt a lingering inner turmoil, one that external means couldn't dispel.  Qing Jun, having once been burdened by a deep-seated blood feud and fallen into demonic obsession before ultimately overcoming it, empathized with Qin Sang's plight.  She knew, however, that directly confronting the issue wouldn't be effective.  The recent confrontation between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo provided the perfect opportunity.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Sister, for your guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, then settled into calmness, a sense of clarity washing over him, clearing away a layer of dust.  The resentment sown over two hundred years of being treated as a mere plaything, manipulated at will, was not easily overcome.  Today, he finally found release.  If not for the presence of others, a deep bow of gratitude would have been appropriate.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean he had forgotten his feud with Dongyang Bo; only a saint could achieve such complete detachment.  As the saying goes, even a tree that desires stillness is buffeted by the wind.  Dongyang Bo would not easily give up; future conflicts were inevitable, and necessary actions must still be taken.  However, Qin Sang could now face them calmly. His gaze extended beyond the immediate past, toward the next heavenly tribulation, toward even higher realms.</p><p>Qing Jun smiled and nodded, then shifted the topic,  “This Yuan Ying spirit puppet seems derived from the art of talismanic weaponry.  However, all paths lead to the Dao. Once this matter is concluded, I can try to help you find a method to control it, and I may gain some insights in the process. Although not the strongest puppet from the Bei Chen region, it's not far off.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “The puppet houses a hundred ghosts; controlling it won’t be easy.”</p><p>“Since Dongyang Bo knows it’s you, there’s no need to maintain the disguise of the Demon King anymore.  It’s better to reveal your identity proactively than to let Dongyang Bo make a story of it,” Qing Jun advised.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, glancing at those around him, “A direct reveal would be too abrupt. We need to find a suitable moment.  We also need to account to the Demon tribe.”</p><p>While they were quietly conversing, the others had all arrived.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord said, “Xiang and I just investigated ahead, confirming the direction of the blood soul attack. It’s the same direction as the earlier strange phenomenon. These blood souls are extremely unusual; they appeared suddenly.  Considering the previous anomalies, it's likely that Ye Laomo triggered an ancient restriction, accidentally releasing them.”</p><p>“My Lord means we should go directly to where the phenomenon occurred?” someone asked.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord shook his head, “We'll split up!  Both the center of the basin and the location of the phenomenon are possibilities. Ye Laomo is cunning; he might have deliberately created the phenomenon to mislead us. We must investigate both.  Approaching the Zu Yuan alone is like a sheep entering a tiger's mouth. We’ll split into two teams, forming formations. If we encounter the Zu Yuan, we can hold out for a while. Once we find them, everyone must remember to restrain themselves and avoid provocation. Send a message to the other team and wait for them before taking action. This will delay things, but with so many ancient restrictions here, they won't be able to act easily either.”</p><p>These two locations were the most likely targets for Ye Laomo.  They had initially suspected the center of the basin, but the interference made it difficult to determine the exact location.</p><p>Without much debate, everyone agreed to trust Tongyou Demon Lord.  Qin Sang and Qing Jun accompanied Chong Yi Daochang and others to the location of the strange phenomenon, while Tongyou Demon Lord led the other half to the center of the basin.</p><p>Along the way, the blood souls became more numerous. Prepared this time, they didn’t repeat past mistakes.  They killed decisively and increased their speed, but remained vigilant against Zu Yuan ambushes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun walked side-by-side, occasionally releasing the fat chicken to sense its kin.</p><p>After a long, uneventful journey, they finally reached their destination.</p><p>“It's a mountain of corpses!”</p><p>Looking up at the scene before them, everyone's expressions were filled with astonishment. Before them stood a mountain, not particularly high compared to the imposing ranges outside the basin. The entire mountain was shrouded in a blood mist.</p><p>The mountain was strangely eerie, permeated with ancient restrictions and blood-red light, obscuring visibility. However, the summit was exposed.  On the cliffs at the summit were numerous large black iron cages, each big enough to hold three or four people. Most were severely damaged, but several were intact, each containing skeletal remains bound in chains!</p><p>The cages, exposed to the chilling wind and various tortures, served as instruments of death, leaving only the bare bones of those once imprisoned. The sight was chilling.  The prisoners must have possessed far greater cultivation than those present, yet they were trapped and tortured here until death.</p><p>They found no trace of Ye Laomo or his companions. However, they observed intense pulsating blood light behind the mountain, clearly indicating something unusual.</p><p>“The blood light that soared into the sky, illuminating the blood mist, came from here!”  Qing Jun said gravely.</p><p>Rounding the mountain, they saw a huge blood-red archway at the foot, with a straight stone staircase leading upwards. The archway was dilapidated, its inscription long gone.  The staircase, originally of unknown color, was now stained blood-red by the mist.</p><p>“No one at the foot of the mountain, and no news from Daoist Tongyou."</p><p>"Let's form a formation and go check it out. Everyone be careful."</p><p>Master Chongyi led the way, his two disciples flanking him protectively.  Qing Jun brought up the rear, while Qin Sang was carefully positioned in the middle.  They knew Qin Sang's senses were sharp and wanted him to focus on his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang, content to remain passive, silently activated his celestial eye ability, remaining vigilant against any ambushes.  The group, in formation, passed under the archway, encountered ancient barriers, and carefully made their way upwards.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, shortly after they entered the mountain, a figure silently appeared in the distant void – Ye Laomo's blood demon incarnation.</p><p>The incarnation sneered, "That cunning old Tongyou really is crafty.  Still, luring half their forces here wasn't a waste of my efforts.  Unfortunately, that little brat Mingyue is here too, making it difficult to approach. Otherwise, I'd let you all taste the true horror of the Corpse Mountain's ancient restrictions!  These insignificant little monsters dare to involve themselves in our human conflict? They don't know what death is!"</p><p>The incarnation vanished into a blood mist, leaving behind a cold snort.  His preparations here were far more extensive, but he had to abandon them due to Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>Even with Tongyou Mojun's alertness, Ye Laomo still succeeded.</p><p>This was a clear strategy, merely to delay their progress. Xiao Han Yu was forced to split its forces, proceeding cautiously, giving Ye Laomo and his allies more time.</p><p>…</p><p>"No good! We've been tricked!"</p><p>Halfway through their ascent, Master Chongyi suddenly yelled. The talisman sword in his hand trembled, a message from Tongyou Mojun.</p><p>The group exchanged glances.  Just as Tongyou Mojun had suspected, Ye Laomo had laid a trap, using blood souls to lure them here, masking his true objective.</p><p>It was unclear what methods Ye Laomo employed, but he used these blood souls to obstruct them.</p><p>Fortunately, they couldn't be controlled; otherwise, they would have had to flee in panic.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Without hesitation, the group swiftly descended the mountain, heading straight for the center of the basin.</p><p>Their descent was unimpeded.  Upon reaching the basin's center, they still found no trace of Ye Laomo and his group.</p><p>Two blood gates remained shut tight, with Tongyou Mojun and the others launching a full-scale assault.</p>
