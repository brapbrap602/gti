<h1>Chapter 874: Seeking a Master</h1><p>Chapter 874: Seeking a Master</p><p>Seeking a master?</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, but she shook her head repeatedly, repeatedly saying, “Friend, you jest. Even if we wanted to join the Lan Dou Sect, they wouldn't accept us.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>The strong man sighed, “We are already Foundation Establishment cultivators. Unless under very special circumstances, those renowned sects wouldn't possibly take us in.  If we had ulterior motives, we couldn't even pass the Lan Dou Sect's Heart's Trial.”</p><p>“Heart's Trial?”</p><p>Qin Sang heard this term for the first time. Upon inquiry, she learned it was a method used by the Lan Dou Sect to screen disciples. Even their inner disciples had to undergo a Heart's Trial after reaching Foundation Establishment.</p><p>In most sects, Qi Condensation disciples are called outer disciples, and without reaching Foundation Establishment, they can never enter the inner circle. Foundation Establishment cultivators are the core strength of a sect and must be carefully chosen.</p><p>Major sects are never casual in recruiting core disciples, and they all have similar selection processes.</p><p>Some even begin screening during the recruitment of outer disciples, but the sects Qin Sang had previously joined were special and did not have such processes.</p><p>Kui Yin Sect recruited people to serve as sacrifices for the Yama Banner, accepting anyone who met the conditions.</p><p>Yuan Zhao Sect held Ascension Conferences to provide sustenance for a collapsing secret realm. To attract more independent cultivators, they didn't set other thresholds.</p><p>Those accepted into the sect were not valued; they performed hard labor, with heavy workloads and strict demands, offering no prospects, and were expelled upon reaching a certain age.</p><p>If it weren't for Yu Hua, who was bought off by the Kui Yin Sect, Qin Sang would have been worn down by Yuan Zhao Sect and had no time to cultivate.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain did have similar methods, but Qin Sang entered with a Sword Intent Mandate, and this process only occurred after outer disciples reached Foundation Establishment and their jade registers were updated.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's Foundation Establishment was unique, unprecedented.</p><p>Not only did he have connections with the sect's Nascent Soul elders, but he was even personally given medicine by a Yuan Ying ancestor, with the sect leader observing the whole process, amazed and awed, so they dared not use such methods on him.</p><p>By chance, he never underwent such a trial.</p><p>Of course, even if Qin Sang had undergone the Heart's Trial, he couldn't have been exposed. Protected by the Jade Buddha, such methods were ineffective against him.</p><p>Joining the Lan Dou Sect was just a jest; both knew it was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. It seemed that only by contacting disciples of the Lan Dou Sect could she find out about Qi Yunzi’s whereabouts.</p><p>The problem was that since the demonic incursion, the Lan Dou Sect's sect leader had also gone to the Demon Sea. The Lan Dou Sect was now practically closed off, with its core disciples rarely venturing out.  Even in the Lan Dou Sect's market, it was difficult to encounter them.</p><p>Also, as the strong man said, the Lan Dou Sect wouldn't allow outsiders to casually examine their true teachings. Even if they found out about the teachings, obtaining them would be another problem.</p><p>The strong man excitedly said, “I previously commissioned a refining master from the Lan Dou Sect. This person was extremely arrogant and charged exorbitant prices, yet his refining skills were far inferior to Friend Mingyue's. Fortunately, he's been holed up in the Lan Dou Sect lately, and upon a friend's recommendation, I traveled far and wide to invite you, Daoist friend. Otherwise, I would have missed this opportunity!”</p><p>Hearing the strong man regard his encounter with her as a stroke of luck, Qin Sang smiled faintly, dismissed the strong man, and fell into thought.</p><p>After a while, she quickly left her quiet room, gave instructions to a servant, and hurriedly departed.</p><p>It wasn't until the next evening that Qin Sang returned to her cave abode, gazing at her external avatar, her eyes flickering incessantly. That day, she had gone to investigate the Lan Dou Sect and when the sects affiliated with it would be accepting disciples.</p><p>She learned that the Lan Dou Sect opened its gates to recruit disciples once every twelve years. Unfortunately, they had just finished a recruitment cycle this year; the next would be in twelve years.</p><p>Initially deeply disappointed, Qin Sang then learned that among the sects affiliated with the Lan Dou Sect, a sect called Yan Miao Pavilion was about to hold a disciple recruitment ceremony, and many independent cultivators had already gathered to prepare.</p><p>Although not as grand as the Lan Dou Sect, Yan Miao Pavilion also had a deep foundation, with several Foundation Establishment masters. Affiliated with the Lan Dou Sect, they thrived and were considered a renowned sect.</p><p>During her conversation with the strong man, Qin Sang had an idea. She herself would have difficulty being accepted by the Lan Dou Sect, but her external avatar had a clean background, and might have a chance to infiltrate.</p><p>After Qin Sang brought her external avatar into the market, the avatar remained secluded in the cave abode, cultivating and not interacting with outsiders; their connection hadn’t been exposed.</p><p>The external avatar's real name was Zhang Yue, and he had a clean background, having been a cultivator native to Lu Island.</p><p>After occupying this body, Qin Sang, in order to give him closure and for her own peace of mind, properly arranged his affairs. Before leaving, she told his parents that he had left home to pursue the Dao.</p><p>Therefore, Zhang Yue's identity was preserved.</p><p>His background was perfectly clear.</p><p>He would not fear any inquiries; the sword soul within the external avatar's body inherited a portion of the Jade Buddha's power.</p><p>These sects wouldn't dare use overly brutal methods on newly initiated disciples;  the resulting hidden injuries would be irreparable.</p><p>Unless a Nascent Soul master is present, the identity of a physical manifestation is difficult to expose.</p><p>Infiltrating the Lan Dou Sect would require more hesitation from Qin Sang.  The Yan Miao Pavilion doesn't have cultivators strong enough to see through a physical manifestation.</p><p>Yan Miao Pavilion and Lan Dou Sect have close ties.  An indirect approach might take longer, but it's a viable option.</p><p>His true body can remain outside, conducting investigations in secret.</p><p>Coordination between the inner and outer will increase the chances of success.</p><p>Qin Sang's biggest worry is the insufficient power of his physical manifestation.  It lacks the ability to adapt to danger.  If the mission fails and the manifestation is lost, he'll deeply regret it.</p><p>“Alright, fortune favors the bold!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, his mind made up.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* and the physical manifestation are equally crucial;  the risk is worth taking.</p><p>However, Qin Sang won't act rashly. He'll give his physical manifestation sufficient life-saving tools.</p><p>Fire Pearls and Void Thunder are the best options; their power is terrifying and they unleash instantly, leaving no room for escape. However, he's already used them.  As a second best, he'll prepare more Soul-Devouring Cones.</p><p>There's no shortage of demonic corpses here.</p><p>Qin Sang's alchemy skills have greatly improved.  He's confident in enhancing the Soul-Devouring Cones to a level that would frighten Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The Soul-Devouring Cones are more than enough to handle general dangers, but they'd be insufficient against a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided to send the Sky-Eyed Butterfly with the manifestation.</p><p>Sky-Eyed Butterflies excel at concealment and illusion; their ability to hide surpasses the manifestation.  They can easily deceive others.</p><p>After obtaining the Thunder Control divine ability, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly is no longer weak and should be able to hold its own against a Core Formation cultivator for a while, buying time for his true body to arrive.</p><p>After sending the physical manifestation, his true body won't stray too far.</p><p>The power of the Swift Return Coins is still available, and he'll have the manifestation carry them for immediate alerts.</p>
