<h1>Chapter 2083: Forging the Altar</h1><p>A crisp mountain wind blew.</p><p>Li Yu Fu quietly recounted the outcome of the three-faction meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang listened calmly.  While unexpected developments might occur, the overall trajectory wouldn't deviate significantly from his predictions.  </p><p>No matter what schemes those people employed, they couldn't stem the tide of the prevailing trend.</p><p>He *was* that trend!</p><p>His overwhelming power allowed him to manipulate it, crushing all opposition with an unstoppable force. However, the human heart remained unpredictable, profoundly complex and subtle.</p><p>High-level cultivators often lived for hundreds or even thousands of years. Even if they spent most of their lives secluded in cultivation, avoiding worldly affairs, longevity exposed them to countless plots and intrigues.  Sometimes, it wasn't a lack of willingness to use such schemes, but simply a lack of necessity.</p><p>In the cultivation world, immense power resided within oneself.  Domination was achieved most easily by ensuring obedience; a bloody purge naturally eliminated dissenters.</p><p>But the path to transcendence prioritized the hearts of the people. Qin Sang desired a Daoist sanctuary where followers adhered to him willingly, not one riddled with disloyalty.</p><p>Of course, hearts could also be manipulated. The groundwork was laid; now he only needed to wait for those shadowy figures to reveal themselves.</p><p>“As expected, the Jiao Dragon King was the first to act. The Dragon Whale Saint King offered some support, though whether he's allied with the Demon Sea remains unclear.  Old Master Fang remained silent. The Three Teach Alliance's stance is the most intriguing…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu commented.</p><p>With Qin Sang backing him, he felt confident, but maintaining a worried facade was tiring.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted noncommittally, shifting the conversation to other matters, to which Li Yu Fu responded.</p><p>Seeing the preparations at Qingyang Temple were complete, Qin Sang declared, "We can seal the mountain!"</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed and withdrew.</p><p>Moments later, the sounds of bells and chimes echoed from the mountain gate, accompanied by rising mists around Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Several powerful arrays had been erected around the mountain gate, providing additional protection.</p><p>Qin Nian Sui and his wife waited at the main hall's entrance. The sounds startled them, and upon closer inspection using their spiritual vision, they realized the sect was indeed sealing itself off.</p><p>Li Yu Fu's unprecedented firmness at the three-faction meeting had foreshadowed this. It seemed he was indeed determined to isolate the sect.</p><p>"Husband, don't worry."</p><p>Bai Han Qiu's eldest daughter, Bai Zhi Xin, sensing her husband's anxiety, held his arm reassuringly.</p><p>After a long wait, a hurried attendant returned, presenting a token—Li Yu Fu's decree as the Temple Master.</p><p>The Temple Master’s decree held the same weight as his presence.</p><p>Qin Nian Sui and his wife quickly bowed.  The attendant smiled apologetically before delivering the order, "Qin Nian Sui, Bai Zhi Xin, you are to return to the North Sea and oversee the ancestral temple. Failure is unacceptable!"</p><p>The couple were shocked, dismissed before even seeing their senior master.</p><p>"Where is Master Shen now?"</p><p>Qin Nian Sui pressed.</p><p>After marrying Bai Zhi Xin, he became Bai Han Qiu's disciple; Shen Chen, a later arrival, addressed Bai Han Qiu as senior sister.</p><p>"Grandmaster Shen is in seclusion, refining artifacts.  Strict orders were given that no one, except the Temple Master, is to disturb him," the attendant replied respectfully, adding,  "Saint King Yu Nu and Grandmaster Huan Hen are assisting Grandmaster Shen."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Nian Sui calmed down.  The sect's Nascent Soul cultivators had clearly reached a consensus.  The Temple Master might have misjudged, but it was unlikely that four Nascent Soul cultivators would err simultaneously; there must be compelling reasons.</p><p>"We obey. We will return to the North Sea immediately!"</p><p>The couple bowed again before departing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang left the main peak for a nearby valley, enclosed by three mountains.  A leveled area had been carved within, appearing from afar as a misty lake—a restricted zone inaccessible even to Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in the valley's center, sensing the ley lines. After a moment, he sat down, slowly channeling his true energy, manipulating the ley lines according to his design.</p><p>Qingyang Temple had already refined the ley lines; Qin Sang only needed minor adjustments, subtle enough to remain undetected.</p><p>The changes were happening right beside them, yet the Qingyang Temple disciples remained oblivious.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's manipulation, the spiritual energy flowed according to his will.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang's plans had evolved with each new experience.</p><p>Previously, he was the only Transcendent cultivator, and had to personally oversee the main altar.  He planned to divide the other branch altars into zones, each centered around a branch altar, and assign them to Nascent Soul cultivators. The power of all the altars would ultimately converge upon him.</p><p>However, with Su Nu and Si Lu by his side, and Zhu Que showing promise of reaching the Transcendent stage, if he could obtain three Transcendent cultivators to assist him, such meticulous division wouldn't be necessary.</p><p>The main altar is in Zhongzhou, with three core branch altars in the North Sea, Western Lands, and the Demon Sea , each manned by one of the three.  Then the three Transcendent cultivators would share his burden, greatly increasing power and speed of deployment.</p><p>Of course, the main altar is the foundation of everything.  If the main altar is unstable, all other plans are futile.</p><p>Days turned into nights.</p><p>After an unknown period, the spiritual energy around Qingyang Temple subtly changed, and the local spirit veins finally met Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his True Qi and awoke, just as a streak of light flew into the valley – Shen Chen.</p><p>"Master, did you need me?"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Shen Chen because he was about to begin constructing the altar.  It was similar to refining artifacts, and Shen Chen's careful observation would greatly benefit him.</p><p>"How is your understanding of the texts I gave you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Shen Chen's expression was vibrant. "Today, disciple finally understands the profound mysteries of artifact refinement. I dare not say I've made rapid progress, but refining formation flags has indeed become much easier. However, I still have many questions and uncertainties I wish to ask Master."</p><p>Master and disciple then engaged in a question-and-answer session.  Qin Sang answered Shen Chen's questions without stopping his own work;  Bi Hen essence and other spiritual materials flew out one by one.</p><p>One precious spiritual material after another shimmered with light.  Shen Chen had never even heard of most of them, leaving him dazzled.</p><p>Hearing Shen Chen's questions, Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Those texts contained some of Master Qi and Master Gu's insights into artifact refinement. To grasp so much in such a short time showed Shen Chen's talent.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang tossed Shen Chen a jade slip.</p><p>Shen Chen glanced at it and immediately immersed himself in it.  The jade slip contained the "Chong Xuan Codex"!</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him and, using his True Qi, drew the Bi Hen essence before him. He performed a series of hand seals, and the Bi Hen essence gradually deepened in color, then self-divided into countless blue specks of light that floated in the air.</p><p>After refining them, Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards, and all the light points sank into the earth.</p><p>The tremor woke Shen Chen, who reluctantly put away the jade slip and focused on observing his master's construction of the altar.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's precise control, the Bi Hen essence dispersed underground and 'flowed' towards the surrounding spirit veins.  Each important spirit vein received the attention of the light points, merging with them as if freezing the veins.</p><p>This was to stabilize the spirit veins and prevent excessive fluctuations during the construction of the altar that might cause damage. This step was necessary for any altar construction.</p><p>While this step sounds easy, it is extremely demanding and requires meticulous attention to detail. Qin Sang proceeded gradually, occasionally explaining it to Shen Chen.</p><p>Master and disciple remained in the valley, oblivious to the changing seasons.</p><p>After laying down the Bi Hen essence, Qin Sang brought out the Golden Mountain Jade, dividing it into pieces and carefully carving them.  Simultaneously, he scattered Golden-Veined Grass seeds, which could be nourished directly with True Qi.</p><p>The Golden-Veined Grass seeds germinated and grew. The plants were strangely shaped, with silvery leaves resembling lightning, branching profusely. Countless Golden-Veined Grass plants were planted together, their branches intertwined like a thunder net.</p><p>The Golden-Veined Grass would die after reaching a certain stage, as the growth was forcefully accelerated. They would not produce more seeds. After their death, the plants would transform into a strange type of thunder power that, unless dispersed, would persist forever.  This would serve as the 'qi veins' for the altar.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned the Thousand Feather Spirit Silk, refined it carefully, and gently inserted it into the 'lightning' plants.</p><p>Shen Chen watched in awe as the altar was built step-by-step under Qin Sang’s masterful hands.</p><p>One day, seeing Qin Sang seemed at leisure, Shen Chen presented an item.  "Master, during a journey to Bei Chen Realm, I found this piece of Unending Blood Mulberry. I intended to refine it into a magic treasure, but I felt this spiritual wood was not so simple.  Using it only to defile other treasures seems a waste, so I haven't decided what to do with it."</p><p>"Oh?  Are there still scattered Unending Blood Mulberries in the Bei Chen Realm?"  After the Ziwei Palace's ascension, Qin Sang searched unsuccessfully, thinking Ye Laomo had wasted them all.</p><p>"Your intuition is correct. This spiritual wood has other uses.  Keep it for now," Qin Sang mused.  "Staying by my side, your perspective remains too narrow."</p><p>After this matter is settled, Master will take you to the Eight Great Heavens, to join a faction—a veritable paradise for artificers.”</p><p>Shen Chen was determined to pursue the path of artifice, and the Five Elements Alliance was perfectly suited.</p><p>That secret technique to deceive a spirit weapon's consciousness using the Intertwined Blood Mulberry had always intrigued Qin Sang, but the Cloud Touring Sword couldn't be exposed. Shen Chen held a piece of the spirit tree, and with careful handling, he might be able to acquire this technique.</p><p>Shen Chen was overjoyed. Carefully putting away the Intertwined Blood Mulberry, he continued to observe Qin Sang forging the altar.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the Western Wasteland.</p><p>In the rear of the Changyou army, a scenic island lay peacefully, a stark contrast to its surroundings. Patrols kept a wide berth, staying a hundred miles away.</p><p>Suddenly, a white wave surged towards the island, stopping abruptly before it. A fully armored Changyou soldier emerged, kneeling on the water's surface.</p><p>“Report to the General! A secret message has arrived!”</p><p>Ripples disturbed the air, and the soldier's message automatically flew into a palace on the island, snatched by a Changyou man.</p><p>This man was tall and strong, with short, neat hair, a strong face, and thick eyebrows like swords. His eyes were sharp and piercing, yet his back remained ramrod straight as he sat.</p><p>This man was Minshan, a high-ranking general, second only to the clan leader and several elders. He currently commanded several armies, pressing against the Storm Realm.</p><p>He opened the message; there was no writing, only a black ink blot, like a living thing, displaying twisting lines.</p><p>His eyes flickered, his brow furrowed. He crushed the message, tapping the table thoughtfully.</p><p>The next moment, a current of water coalesced beyond the island, merging into the ocean current, drifting to a vast expanse of sea.</p><p>The current reformed, surfacing as a human figure, an exact copy of Minshan.</p><p>He gazed at the calm sea, saying softly, “Come out.”</p><p>After a while, a wisp of black smoke rose from the depths, twisting into a shadowy figure, its features indistinct.</p><p>“What’s the matter?  It’s worthy of…”</p><p>Minshan was about to ask when his gaze turned cold. He shouted, “You’re not Cihun!”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>The shadow laughed ominously. “The General is indeed cautious, only sending an avatar. I’ve long admired the General’s reputation, and am honored to finally see you in person!”</p><p>During the years of conflict, the Changyou had bought informants in the Storm Realm. Cihun was one of the deepest-rooted, always communicating only with Minshan.  His exposure was unexpected.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Minshan narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint appearing.  Since the other party knew Cihun’s identity, why not spread misinformation? This show of arrogance—was it an insult?</p><p>“The General needn't know my identity. You only need to know that, like your friend Cihun, my heart is with the Changyou.  I’ve luckily obtained important information, and I trust no one else. I couldn’t reach the General directly, so I resorted to this method.  I wonder if the General is interested…”</p><p>The shadow’s voice was ethereal, its form wavering as if anticipating Minshan’s attack.</p><p>One couldn't refuse a defector.</p><p>Although Minshan found the person suspicious, he decided to listen. “What news?” he asked.</p><p>“Much news. For instance, the weaknesses in the North Sea defenses,” the shadow said calmly.</p><p>Minshan stared at the shadow. “How can I know if your news is true?”</p><p>The shadow smiled. “I’m risking my life. This isn't a one-time deal, General. You can verify the information gradually; you'll feel my sincerity… Let's start with this!”</p><p>The Changyou had been trying to buy insiders, but with little success.  This person seemed to know the North Sea defenses extremely well, possibly holding a high position.  Such a person would only betray if they faced injustice or had grievances.</p><p>“Why have you come to us?” Minshan asked bluntly, suspicious of a plot against him.</p><p>“No! No! No!”</p><p>The shadow shook its head repeatedly. “I haven’t defected, but I wish to cooperate. This information isn’t free!”</p><p>All men seek gain.</p><p>Minshan wasn’t surprised. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Something commensurate with the value of this information. The Changyou clan has a rich treasury; I’m sure you can satisfy my desires. But what I want most is the Azure Spirit Qi!” The shadow’s voice grew urgent.</p><p>“Azure Spirit Qi?”</p><p>Minshan sneered. “If you help me conquer the North Sea or the Central State, you can take as much Azure Spirit Qi as you want!”</p><p>The shadow bowed deeply. “I will not disappoint you, General!” </p>
