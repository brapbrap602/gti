<h1>Chapter 2024: The Odd Crystal</h1><p>A rhythmic pulse emanated from within the Qianjun Ring, like a beating heart deep within the tomb, awakened from its slumber by some unknown presence.  Qin Sang couldn't determine the source of the ring's reaction. After a moment of contemplation, sensing no summons, he concluded it wasn't a living being.  Otherwise, he'd have to carefully consider the implications.</p><p>Seeing no immediate danger in the tomb passage, and finding the faded murals harmless,  Pei Gongfeng and the young Mistress Xin proceeded forward. Qin Sang remained in the rear.</p><p>He initially wished to avoid involvement, intending only to fulfill his promise to the young Mistress Xin and repay the Xin family cultivators for their scouting efforts.  However, the situation had taken an unexpected turn, making withdrawal impossible.  This place was connected to the Qianjun Ring, possibly a fragment from the Ziwei Palace, and he had to investigate.</p><p>Curiously, how did the Xin family find this place? Did they also obtain a treasure from the Ziwei Palace, something similar to the Qianjun Ring, leading them here?  However, the young Mistress Xin didn't appear to possess anything that resonated with the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, observing the backs of the young Mistress Xin and Pei Gongfeng.  The situation was unclear, so he wouldn't reveal his intentions, choosing to wait and see. Even without Pei Gongfeng, he wouldn't directly question the young Mistress Xin.  She had dared to invite a Void Refinement cultivator to explore this place, indicating considerable resources and confidence.  The Xin family's ability to deploy numerous Transformation Stage cultivators spoke volumes about their background.</p><p>‘Thump… thump… thump…’</p><p>The group intentionally increased their pace, their footsteps echoing in the long passage, breaking the silence.  But the passage remained quiet ahead, without any branches, leading them smoothly to the end.</p><p>Dazzling white light filled the end of the passage, dispelling the darkness. They stopped, peering beyond the exit to see a patch of vibrant green.  It was a dense growth of aquatic plants on the surface of the water, seemingly shallow, with a sandy bottom. This environment was common in Duizhou, yet surprising to find here.</p><p>The water was still, without a ripple.  The tomb had been eerily calm this entire time, showing no sign of danger. This very stillness heightened their vigilance. They remained where they were, cautiously extending their spiritual sense outwards.</p><p>The scene beyond was astonishing: a large lake, its water level as shallow as the passage exit, its surface covered with lush aquatic plants. Amongst the vegetation, numerous statues stood.  Their bases were identical to those in the passage, but these statues were intact.</p><p>Carved onto the pedestals were bizarre creatures—hardly imaginable beasts: a one-clawed dragon, a three-winged bird, an ox with dozens of eyes on its head—and these were amongst the most normal-looking ones.  The creatures were incredibly lifelike, their eyes wide open, staring at the passage entrance, as if ready to attack any intruders.  The sight startled the group, causing them to instinctively retract their spiritual sense.</p><p>After waiting a moment, the statues remained unresponsive.  Continued waiting wasn't an option, as they needed to enter the tomb regardless of the dangers ahead.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The moment they stepped out of the passage, a sharp sound echoed.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>The young Mistress Xin exclaimed, instantly waving her sleeve.  A golden light shot out, transforming into a golden lock with several rings, clinking as it flew, emitting golden rings toward the source of the sound.</p><p>The sound originated from a statue—the three-winged bird. It had symmetrical wings, but a growth at the base of its wings sprouted an additional wing, standing stiffly between the others, like a fan.</p><p>Instantly, the bird statue was enveloped in golden light.  Rings of the golden lock fell, forming a cage.  But the young Mistress Xin was too late. Before the lock could fully restrain it, the bird came alive, its eyes blazing with ferocity.  Its wings flapped, the middle wing emitting a silver light, seemingly capable of tearing through space, and its form vanished.</p><p>The young Mistress Xin's expression changed slightly. She flicked her finger, and the golden lock sprang open, its main body plummeting down. A 'bang' echoed as it struck the bird, sending it crashing into the water, splashing a spray of water.</p><p>More than one stone bird came to life.  Three statues closest to them leaped down simultaneously, attacking the group.</p><p>Having entered the tomb, Master Pei had to act. He hadn't retracted his purple needle; he aimed it at the forehead of one monster. Qin Sang didn't stand idly by either, using her Grey Warbler Sword to attack another.  Only one monster remained, which the Xin family cultivators easily dealt with.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang struck first.  The monster was split in two by her sword, instantly rigid, and fell into the water, turning into two ordinary stone carvings.</p><p>Next was Master Pei's target. The monster was pierced through the forehead by the purple needle, but it seemed to have no vital points.  Master Pei changed his incantation, and purple light erupted within the monster, dismembering it, before it finally shattered into rubble.</p><p>The Xin family cultivators were cooperating to deal with the last monster, and it looked like they were about to succeed.</p><p>“Not strong…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently assessed the monsters’ strength. The four were only at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>For such low-level guardians, the tomb owner's status couldn't be very high. If it was from the Purple Micro Palace, it wouldn't be a significant place, contradicting his expectations.</p><p>However, their strength might have diminished over time, and they had just entered; the real danger might lie ahead.</p><p>The four monsters were quickly defeated. Then, a series of cracking sounds echoed as all the remaining stone creatures came alive, leaping from their pedestals and charging towards them, each with its own unique abilities.</p><p>For a time, brilliant light and ice and fire flew everywhere. Fortunately, the Xin family cultivators coordinated well, and Qin Sang and Master Pei intervened from time to time, eventually killing all the monsters.</p><p>“Thank you, Elder Qin and Master Pei, for resolving this crisis. Otherwise, our Xin family might have suffered more casualties,” the Xin Clan’s Young Master said, rushing forward after the battle, too preoccupied to rest.</p><p>Master Pei had a prior agreement, so his intervention was expected.  Qin Sang, however, was invited for her refining skills.</p><p>“I'm also curious who would build a tomb here, but my safety is a prerequisite. Young Master Xin, don't expect too much from me,” Qin Sang cautioned.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, produced a jade slip, and handed it to Qin Sang. “Elder Qin, this is one of the items you need to refine.  I've prepared the materials. You can begin studying it now and start refining it once we find a suitable place.”</p><p>“Just one?”</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade slip, seemingly oblivious to Master Pei's scrutinizing gaze.  She glanced at it; it was a request to refine a magical artifact – a ferry.</p><p>She examined the details carefully.  Refining the ferry would be tedious but not particularly difficult for her, just time-consuming. Qin Sang didn't ask about the ferry's purpose, focusing instead on understanding the instructions to avoid making a mistake and damaging her reputation.</p><p>The shattered statues showed no signs of recovering. The group crossed the lake and found a stairway entrance on the far side.</p><p>The entrance was almost completely filled with aquatic plants. After clearing them away, they saw a stone staircase leading down.</p><p>“It seems the tomb is multi-layered. We're on the first level,” Manager Luo surmised.</p><p>“There's a seal!” A Xin family cultivator used their spiritual sense to investigate and made a new discovery.</p><p>The group entered in succession and found an ancient seal blocking their path. A brief inspection revealed it was of the same origin as the ancient prohibition on the stone door.</p><p>As before, Young Master Xin went alone to the seal, pressing her palm against it and asking Master Pei for help in breaking it.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang watched more closely.  When the dark light appeared, something seemed to emanate from Young Master Xin's palm. She disguised it well, using incantations as a cover; she had fooled Qin Sang before.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  “It seems the Xin family really obtained something related to this place…”</p><p>The seal was broken by the purple needle, revealing another tomb passage, similar to the previous one.</p><p>As they entered, a faint fragrance filled the air.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a stronger pulse from the Qianjun Ring; the connection became clearer, stirring her thoughts.  By continuing deeper, when the connection was sufficiently clear, she might be able to use the Qianjun Ring to directly locate her target. However, the path ahead was unknown, so having others to scout was beneficial.</p><p>Confirming the fragrance was harmless, the group exited the passage to find a sea of flowers.</p><p>Countless flowers bloomed, a vibrant display of color.</p><p>A buzzing sound emanated from the flower sea.  They looked closer and saw numerous yellow hornets flying around the flowers, busily collecting nectar.</p><p>Tens of thousands of wasps, a veritable cloud of yellow, swarmed above the sea of flowers.  They were similar in size to ordinary wasps, seemingly harmless to cultivators.  However, upon seeing them,  Pei Gongfeng's expression turned grave, and Qin Sang frowned, seemingly recalling something.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the Xin family cultivators, a jade ruyi swiftly flew from Pei Gongfeng's sleeve.  Simultaneously, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes, and he exclaimed, "They're ritual insects! Beware of illusions!"</p><p>Young Master Xin reacted swiftly, producing a small bell.  All the Xin family cultivators immediately gathered around him.</p><p>*Dang!*</p><p>A deep resonant tone echoed from the bell.  It wasn't controlled by Young Master Xin alone; all the Xin cultivators were jointly activating it.  Visible ripples spread with the sound, and everyone felt their senses sharpen.</p><p>They may not have fully trusted Qin Sang, but they dared not ignore the warning of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Better wasted effort than certain death.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang wasn't deceiving them. He recognized these wasps: ritual insects.</p><p>The term "ritual insect" originates from the Wu tribe.  It doesn't refer to a single species, but a category of spirit insects.  The Wu tribe's Insect Roster lists spirit insects suitable as life-bound insect-gu, but their mastery of insect control extends beyond this; many social insects also serve their purposes.</p><p>In the few Wu tribe texts Qin Sang had read, these ritual insects were described.  Ancient Wu tribes, at specific times, would perform ceremonies led by their chief shaman to honor deities.  These ceremonies sometimes involved spirit insects to assist, insects known as ritual insects, holding a revered position within the tribe, enjoying the same offerings as the shaman.</p><p>These insects often shared characteristics, excelling in illusions and mind-affecting abilities.  Qin Sang guessed this was to immerse the tribe members in the ceremony, allowing for undivided, heartfelt worship.</p><p>These wasps were one such type of ritual insect.</p><p>"Ritual insects of the Wu tribe are here! Could my initial guess be right—that this is the tomb of a powerful Wu cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang was perplexed.  What was the origin of this place?  Could there be remnants of a powerful Wu cultivator in the Ziwei Palace?  Legend speaks of human sword cultivators fighting at the boundary, but the outer demons are enemies of the entire Great Thousand World.  Could there have been compassionate Wu people fighting alongside the Ziwei Sword Venerable?</p><p>Almost as soon as Qin Sang issued the warning, the ritual insects detected them.  The yellow cloud solidified, all the insects turning to face them. The buzzing intensified, becoming incredibly shrill.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>A fierce wind arose, the yellow cloud spreading at an alarming rate, instantly engulfing the surroundings in a hazy yellow.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's jade ruyi emitted a clear light, resisting the cloud.  The bell continued to toll, each ring more urgent than the last. The ripples battled the yellow cloud, but could only defend, slowly shrinking inward.  The Xin family cultivators were terrified, grateful for Qin Sang's timely warning.</p><p>Qin Sang, protected by his jade Buddha, remained unaffected.  He feigned action, transmitting a voice message, "The ritual insects are only dangerous in swarms; individual strength is weak. Hold your ground and eliminate them separately."</p><p>Before he finished, his Gray Warbler Sword slashed at the swarm.</p><p>Having successfully withstood the first attack, unharmed, the cultivators followed Qin Sang's orders, attacking the insects.  However, Qin Sang departed, flying his sword towards the heart of the swarm.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that some ritual insects, bred through Wu tribe secret techniques, produced a treasure called gall crystal, a rare medicinal ingredient in insect cultivation.  Feeding it to spirit insects had numerous benefits, but breeding these ritual insects was extremely difficult, only achievable by large Wu tribes.</p><p>These insects had been trapped here for an unknown number of years, and gall crystals should remain.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword cut a path, piercing the densest part of the swarm, where he saw a flowering tree.  The blossoms were the size of an infant's fist, uniquely shaped like small, round-necked jugs hanging from the branches.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately noticed over a dozen blossoms far more translucent than the others, seemingly transformed into jade-like material over the ages.  The jugs were filled.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He dashed to the tree and looked into one of the jugs.  It was filled with yellowish crystals, level with the rim.</p><p>Gall crystal!</p><p>Normally, gall crystal was honey-like, but these had solidified into hard crystals.  Fewer than he expected; not a whole tree full, but the crystalline form seemed purer than described, likely altering its efficacy.</p>
