<h1>Chapter 1527: Civilization (4k)</h1><p>Nine years later.</p><p>The Shen梭 sped tirelessly through the storm, yet the end remained unseen.</p><p>Having survived the Beast Calamity,</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were more cautious and weary than before, taking longer rests each time.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a new idea.</p><p>Since living beings could survive in the storm zone, could there be other unknown entities?</p><p>With this thought in mind, whenever he had free time, Qin Sang would circle each shelter.</p><p>Even if he did make a discovery, the likely outcome wasn't opportunity, but danger.</p><p>Given Qin Sang's nature, every risky action was carefully considered, weighing the gains and losses before proceeding; he wouldn't undertake something with almost no reward.</p><p>Yet, he remained indefatigable.</p><p>Not out of expectation of opportunity.</p><p>But from a thirst for knowledge, a yearning for the mysteries of the unknown world!</p><p>In the vast expanse of the storm zone, the area Qin Sang could explore was minuscule, akin to searching for a needle in an ocean.</p><p>In fact, he had found nothing new, not even a second beast.</p><p>Inside the Shen梭.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, putting away the magic banner in his hand.</p><p>More than twenty years of hard work hadn't been in vain; Qin Sang had devoted almost all his energy to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion, the fire lotus was noticeably larger, appearing deeper; originally shaped like a lotus seed, it was now gradually taking on the outline of a black lotus.</p><p>“How much longer?”</p><p>Qin Sang blurted out, asking Liuli, who was controlling the Shen梭.</p><p>The sea chart was right in front of him; he could see it at a glance.</p><p>Liuli hadn't woken him, indicating a smooth journey; judging by the time he'd spent cultivating, he could roughly determine their current location.</p><p>However, Qin Sang habitually asked Liuli, essentially making conversation.</p><p>If he didn't speak, Liuli could easily remain silent for a hundred years.</p><p>Whether her nature was innate or shaped by the cataclysm was unknown.</p><p>“An hour.”</p><p>Liuli’s lips parted slightly, still sparing her words.</p><p>Progress!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>Previously, Liuli would only answer what she deemed meaningful; she might at most point to the sea chart. Now she could respond verbally.</p><p>An hour later, they arrived not at the Central State, but at another shelter.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't resume his meditation, taking over the Shen梭 and allowing Liuli to rest.</p><p>The scenery was monotonous; they had grown weary of it.</p><p>Qin Sang listlessly piloted the Shen梭, his mind imagining what the next shelter would look like and what surprises it might hold.</p><p>The various shelters along their journey had truly opened his eyes.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, an hour passed, and the shelter came into view.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed his wandering thoughts and gazed ahead.</p><p>Liuli, sensing something, also opened her eyes.</p><p>The Shen梭 sped on, the storm ahead gradually thinning.</p><p>Immediately, their vision widened; the shelter was unobstructed, clearly revealed before them.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were instantly stunned!</p><p>Azure sea and blue sky.</p><p>A boundless expanse!</p><p>A strange barrier separated the inside and outside into two completely different worlds.</p><p>One chaotic, the other calm.</p><p>Within the barrier, while still affected by the storm zone with constant gales and downpours, the intensity and chaos were incomparable to the storm zone itself—a veritable sanctuary!</p><p>They were too familiar with this sight.</p><p>Any cultivator who had been to the border of the cultivation world and the storm zone would be no stranger to it.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a look, their eyes filled with surprise and confusion, both turning to the sea chart.</p><p>So vast!</p><p>So calm!</p><p>Could this be a cultivation world ahead?</p><p>Why wasn't it specially marked on the sea chart?</p><p>The sea chart had been accurate along their entire journey.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Shen梭 effortlessly flew out of the storm zone and into this sky-covered land; it was as if all the chaos had peeled away from them.  The familiar feeling brought an inexplicable sense of relaxation to both of them.</p><p>“It really is a cultivation world?”</p><p>Qin Sang was full of doubts, gazing into the distance, discovering that this world was far vaster than he'd imagined; the previously largest shelter had only been a mountain range.</p><p>Something amiss must have a reason behind it.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously stopped the Shen梭, murmuring, “Let's travel on foot, and find out what this place is first. There might be cultivators here.”</p><p>Traveling on foot would make it easier to conceal their tracks.</p><p>The two immediately left the Shen梭, using their cultivation techniques to walk on water, proceeding slowly forward.</p><p>Qin Sang probed her spiritual sense beneath the sea's surface and found fish and shrimp, proving the existence of life. This place was vastly different from the lifeless shelters.</p><p>After traveling for some time, a dark shadow appeared on the horizon – an island.  From afar, they could see greenery and birds flitting through the trees.</p><p>Slowing their pace and concealing themselves, the two approached the island.  Qin Sang sensed nothing unusual. After landing and exploring, she found no cultivators but did discover some unusual traces in a forest.</p><p>"This was once a human settlement,"  Liuli stated confidently, standing between two large trees.</p><p>She swept away weeds and vines, revealing a section of a ruined stone wall.  Further excavation unearthed pottery and other artifacts, clear signs of intelligent life.  The desolate landscape, however, suggested the ruins were incredibly old.</p><p>"There were people here! Or at least, intelligent beings!" Qin Sang said gravely. This discovery alone set this place apart from the shelters.</p><p>After a brief pause, they continued their journey, finding several more islands.  Careful searches revealed more possible human settlements, all buried beneath thick jungle growth, eroded and almost one with nature.  They found birds, animals, fish, and insects – a balanced ecosystem teeming with life – but no people.</p><p>These islands were a distance from the storm belt and largely unaffected by it.  For ordinary people, the islands offered abundant resources.  Why were they completely abandoned?  Their confusion deepened, and they accelerated their pace.</p><p>"Land ahead!" Qin Sang whispered.</p><p>Another shadow appeared on the horizon, but unlike the islands, it was immense, stretching beyond sight. Their unease intensified.  Even the most discerning people wouldn't abandon a continent this large. Yet, the islands along the coast were just like the others—deserted for millennia, seemingly devoid of life.  It defied logic.</p><p>Based on the evidence, Qin Sang and Liuli arrived at a grim possibility.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>They flew across the sea and landed on the mainland.  From their vantage point, they saw a boundless expanse of green.  The land was a panorama of rolling hills and towering peaks, rivers flowing into the sea, birdsong, and wild animals roaming freely.</p><p>Beneath the breathtaking beauty lay a different kind of silence.  The incredibly fertile coastal areas and riverbanks were devoid of any city, village, or even a single person.</p><p>"The spiritual energy here is very thin," Liuli observed.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, adding, "No cultivators, no demonic beasts – that's understandable. But where did the humans who lived here go?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly descended, landing in a fertile plain where mountains converged.  As expected, she found ruins nearby.  Circling the ruins, she was astonished to discover the remains of a city, a truly magnificent one by mortal standards, rivaling even the capital of Da Sui.  The wooden structures had long decayed, but many traces remained, including stone walls and foundations.  Like the other sites, most of it was buried, overgrown with weeds and vines, severely weathered.</p><p>Qin Sang searched for signs of war but found none and widened her search.  They soon discovered other city ruins, incredibly densely packed, hinting at a once prosperous civilization.  But it was all history now.</p><p>They shifted their focus from mortal settlements to seeking traces of cultivators, observing geomantic formations, following energy fluctuations, and searching for spiritual veins.  They ventured deeper into the continent.</p><p>Without actively searching, they discovered more city ruins. As they progressed, they sensed a place suitable even for low-level cultivators in this impoverished land.</p><p>They were deep within the continent.  All nearby spiritual veins converged towards a single point, an event highly unlikely to occur naturally, suggesting artificial manipulation!</p><p>Their spirits lifted, they quickened their pace, tracing the source.  Soon, a mountain range came into view, resembling a crouching dragon, a place of exceptional spiritual energy.  Qin Sang and Liuli paused, their gazes fixed on the highest peak.</p><p>This peak was imposing and perilous, the tallest they had ever seen.  Most striking was the large stone stele standing atop it, the most conspicuous object in the area.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli landed before the stele.  The stele bore inscriptions, written in elegant calligraphy.  Qin Sang brushed away the vines covering it, revealing the full inscription.  Their form froze, as if turned to stone.</p><p>“Here, once was a civilization.”</p><p>The inscription was simple, the tone understated.  Yet Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sorrow, a blow to the heart.  Images of ruins flashed through their mind, their breath catching in their throat.  A once-thriving civilization… now extinct!  Hidden in the jungle, beneath the yellow earth, lay the only remaining trace of this lost culture.</p><p>The wind howled fiercely at the summit, cutting at their faces like knives. Qin Sang stood motionless, speechless for a long time.  The stele… was it the civilization's final testament? Or a tomb erected by passers-by like themselves?</p><p>Learning that the entire world was an endless expanse of storm zones, and that their cultivation world was only protected from destruction by a barrier, Qin Sang couldn't help but think:  What despair would await the day that barrier failed!  This barrier remained intact, yet the civilization had perished for some unknown reason.  They, Yuan Ying cultivators, seemingly stood atop the world, yet lacked the ability to escape their cage.  What was the difference between them and this civilization, trapped and destroyed here?</p><p>No imagination could compare to the shock of witnessing the truth firsthand.  The saying, "Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles," truly holds true.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>After a long time, Qin Sang exhaled, releasing the weight on their chest, and looked at Liuli. Liuli stared at the stele, her lips pressed tightly together.  Having spent many years together, Qin Sang understood Liuli’s nature. This expression only appeared when she was making an important decision or deeply moved.  Qin Sang bowed respectfully to the stele and softly said, "I'll go and look around."</p><p>They found traces suggesting the presence of other cultivators.  The cultivators here were likely not very strong, the protective barriers they might have left couldn't have lasted this long, and surely those who had passed by before them had taken anything of value.  Qin Sang searched the area, but sadly found no other records.  The reason for the civilization's extinction remained a mystery.</p><p>Returning to the stele, Liuli had regained her composure and also paid her respects.  The two silently continued their journey.  This was their usual way, but this time, the atmosphere was heavier than before. Even with their mental fortitude, it would take time to process this experience.</p><p>This was the smallest and most barren cultivation world Qin Sang had ever seen. They explored every corner, but found no one.  Their search yielded nothing.  They both wanted to leave.</p><p>On a deserted island, they paused to rest.  Despite the lack of combat, they felt more exhausted than ever. Qin Sang meditated briefly, opening their corpse puppet bag and summoning Ya Gu, habitually checking her condition and using bone incantations to regulate her Qi and blood.</p><p>Having finished, Qin Sang noticed Liuli had awakened and was watching them.  Hesitating slightly, Liuli softly asked, “She… is she your partner?”</p><p>Having lived together for over twenty years, Liuli had seen Ya Gu before, but this was the first time she asked about her.  Qin Sang smiled, returning Ya Gu to the corpse puppet bag, blocking their senses before saying, “Her name is Jin Liuying.  I owe her a debt, and intended to settle it, but she was implicated by me, suffering a calamity…”</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, recalling their experiences in the Canglang Sea, recounting their story to Liuli in detail. Liuli sat upright, listening intently.</p><p>“Driven by duty and guilt, I vowed to save her, but later discovered the Heaven Corpse Talisman wasn't that simple. I searched for various corpse-cultivation techniques, trying everything but to no avail, delaying things until now.</p><p>“Honestly, I didn’t expect her to persevere, it's beyond reason.</p><p>“I could sense her suffering and struggle in the darkness, teetering on the brink of despair, clinging to every fragile lifeline.</p><p>“It’s unimaginable, the unwavering belief and strength that allowed a mere Qi Refinement cultivator to endure until now, even saving me once…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, gently stroking the corpse puppet bag, their voice firm, “She's still fighting to live, how can I give up? As long as she persists, I will do everything to find a way to save her! I hope there will be a turning point in the Central Plains. Once we reach there, I hope you will help me look for the Ghost Mother.”</p><p>Throughout the story, Liuli remained calm, seeming deeply absorbed. Her eyelashes trembled slightly as she looked up at Qin Sang's face.  She nodded firmly.</p><p>“Good!”</p>
