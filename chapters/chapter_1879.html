Chapter 1870: A Scale and a Claw


Wind and sand swept across the battlefield.

The roars of combat vanished. Cultivators and demon cultivators alike stared at the sky, their faces etched with shock.

Boundless dark clouds spread from the southeast, turning day into night.  A golden light within the inky depths drew all eyes.

Within the golden light, a dragon-like figure seemed to ride the clouds, approaching.  As the cultivators caught sight of the radiance, golden clouds filled the sky above the battlefield.

‘Boom!’

Both demon and human cultivators felt a world-shaking pressure descend upon them.

Those with weaker cultivation bases reeled under the terrifying pressure.  Their hearts pounded, then faltered, their minds reeling as they coughed up blood.

Those who had formed battle formations joined forces to resist, barely managing to steady themselves. Yet, their faces were pale, their eyes filled with terror.

Among them were seasoned veterans of the Yellow Springs Path, who had witnessed the awe-inspiring might of Grandmasters and Demon Kings clashing.  But this power was on a different level entirely, beyond comparison.

“Could it be…”

“A Great Sage?”

…

The Daoist battle formation crumbled, its foundation shaken, not by force, but by fear.

The Daoists and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had been locked in endless conflict along the Yellow Springs Path, their battles typically involving Grandmasters and Demon Kings.

Grand Sovereigns and Great Sages were names whispered in hushed tones, figures of legend.

Every cultivator understood: if Grand Sovereigns and Great Sages personally joined the fray, the situation would become irrecoverable. The fate of Mount Juzhi would hang by a thread.

Even before the Great Sage's true form was revealed, the battlefield descended into chaos, though the pressure wasn’t directed at them.

In an instant, the dark clouds engulfed the Ritual Platform. The multicolored auspicious clouds above it were shrouded, their light dimmed.

‘Swish!’

From within the dark clouds, a golden ray suddenly shot downwards.

…

White Stone Prefecture.

A mountain peak within the Ritual Platform.

This mountain was the highest peak of White Stone Prefecture, but it was concealed by the grand formation of the Ritual Platform, invisible to ordinary eyes.

Unlike other places, there were no golden palaces on this mountain. It was exceptionally beautiful and serene, a scene of natural wonder.

At the summit were groves of purple bamboo.  Within the groves, several bamboo halls had been built, their doors tightly shut, the surroundings deserted.

As the drumbeats sounded, a door suddenly opened.

‘Creak!’

No one emerged.

Inside the hall, an incense burner held burning spirit incense.  On a meditation cushion sat a woman in moon-white Daoist robes. Her aura was faint, almost nonexistent.  Her face was uncovered, yet a strange sense of obscurity surrounded her.

Those who saw her wouldn't find her exceptionally beautiful, nor would they find her ugly.  They would simply forget her appearance in the blink of an eye.

Her eyes were closed, deep in meditation.

The drumbeats reached her ears.

Her eyelids twitched slightly, but her expression remained unchanged.

A soft sigh echoed within the bamboo hall.  A streak of red light shot out the door, piercing the sky, heading straight for the Ritual Platform of Mount Juzhi.

Its true form was a thumb-sized bronze bell, a red ribbon tied to its loop.

The bell's speed rivaled the Great Sage's, crossing mountains and rivers in an instant.  But its movement was far less conspicuous.  To any observer, it would appear as a peculiar shooting star.

…

Central Abundance Prefecture.

The layout of this Prefecture’s Ritual Platform differed greatly from White Stone Prefecture’s.  Eight smaller formations linked together, forming a larger formation. These were the official residences of the various departments of the Heavenly Hub Institute, surrounding a mountain peak that wasn't particularly tall.

Golden palaces, resplendent and magnificent, adorned the mountain.

At the highest point stood the grandest palace of all. A golden bell hung beside its entrance.

At this moment, the golden bell rang of its own accord, its sound echoing only around the palace.

Spiritual energy converged above the palace, forming an illusory image of a gaunt Daoist.

The Daoist stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing north, a contemplative look on his face. He glanced towards White Stone Prefecture, then raised his right index finger, pointing remotely towards the Ritual Platform of Mount Juzhi.

The next moment, his figure faded, disappearing completely, yet his posture remained frozen in the air.

…

Golden light descended from the heavens.

Blindingly bright, it was a dragon's tail, its golden scales gleaming as it plummeted from the sky.

The cultivators outside the Ritual Platform could clearly see half of the dragon's body.

‘Whoosh!’

The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds like an arrow, striking directly above the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.

The auspicious clouds exploded, shaking heaven and earth. Even the cultivators and demon cultivators in the sky felt unsteady, their faces filled with awe.

Above the Ritual Platform, a section of the dragon's body spanned the heavens, its head unseen, its size unknown.

“Retreat!”

As the Daoists stood paralyzed, the demon cultivators received the order to withdraw.

The Demon Kings were the fastest to react. By now, everything was unfolding according to the Great Sage’s plan.

Their mission was complete. Their previous display had been a bluff, meant to convince the Dao Court that the Divine Court had emerged.

They were no longer needed to seize the fragmented map; nor did they have the power to participate.

Orders were absolute.

The demon cultivators retreated like a receding tide.

The Daoists, as if awakening from a dream, found themselves in an unprecedented situation.  Hesitant, they then saw a red light approaching from the west.

‘Ring… Ring…’

As the red light streaked across the sky, the bronze bell chimed softly.

The chime wasn't jarring, but all cultivators inside and outside the Ritual Platform heard it. The chime carried a calming power, soothing their turbulent minds.

The red light reached the Ritual Platform, revealing its true form.  The ribbon danced in the wind as the bronze bell began to shake violently.

Visible ripples spread from the bell’s mouth. Yellow sound waves appeared, distorting the very fabric of space.

The sound waves enveloped the dragon's body within the dark clouds.

Just then, the persistent shriek echoed from the depths of the Sinful Wasteland, drawing closer.

Many cultivators and demon cultivators on the battlefield covered their ears in pain. The shriek drowned out the bell’s chime, piercing their minds.

The world grew darker.

Those with keen senses noticed something amiss.  They pointed towards the area behind the Ritual Platform, their voices trembling, "What is that?"

Those beside them followed their gaze, and their expressions froze.

Against the gloomy sky, strange patterns appeared, like ripples on water, radiating a black sheen.

"That… looks like plumage?"

"It's a wing!"

"One wing! Only one!"

…

Exclamations erupted.

They finally saw it clearly.  A monstrous beast's wing blotted out the sky.

Beasts were demon beasts. Logically, except for certain unusual creatures, they should have at least a pair of wings.

But from their vantage point, they couldn't even see the whole of this single wing, its edges extending beyond their sight, let alone a second one.

Suddenly, the sky seemed to fall!

The cultivators staring in that direction felt their breath catch, an immense pressure weighing on their hearts.

The sky hadn't collapsed.  The wing had simply moved, seemingly in slow motion.

‘Whoosh!’

A fierce wind erupted.

The single flap of the wing was as powerful as the dragon's tail strike. Black feathers rustled, and a black vortex of wind formed beneath the wing.

In the blink of an eye, the vortex transformed into a hurricane, as vast as the wing itself, swallowing the bronze bell and its sound waves.

The chime weakened significantly.

Simultaneously.

From the northwest, deafening thunder roared.

With dark clouds in the east, black feathers in the north, the western sky was now dominated by grey lightning.

Countless bolts of lightning, seemingly chaotic, yet with a clear purpose, converged on the Ritual Platform.

‘Boom!’

The first and thickest bolt of grey lightning slammed into the void west of the Ritual Platform.

At that very moment, starlight descended.

Though it wasn't night, countless stars appeared in the sky.

Elsewhere, the starlight might have been brilliant, but here it was strangely dim.

However, the Milky Way remained clearly visible.

Stars within the Milky Way shimmered, sending down a beam of starlight. Then, surrounding stars began to twinkle in clusters.

Beams of starlight rained down, illuminating the battlefield, converging where the first beam had landed.

At this moment, the light of countless stars shone solely on this spot.

The starlight merged, transforming into a warm jade color, then truly coalescing into a jade talisman.

The talisman was no more than three inches long, small and exquisite, the most translucent jade imaginable.

Faint starlight flickered on its surface, its runes constantly shifting, as if containing the essence of all the stars in the heavens.

The jade talisman trembled, about to shoot towards the Ritual Platform, when the grey lightning struck.

‘Rumble!’

A domain of grey lightning instantly enveloped the jade talisman.

Though the talisman wouldn't be easily destroyed, it was trapped within a cage of lightning.

The Demon Calling Drum couldn't control the beasts it attracted, but it could manipulate their instincts, subtly guiding them, though only for a short time.

However, in the Great Sage’s plan, this brief period was sufficient!

‘Boom!’

The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds.

From above, a deep hole appeared in the center of the clouds.  The dragon's tail had pierced through multiple layers of illusion.

Blinding golden light shone within, interspersed with other colors and countless strange fragments, swirling into a storm of terrifying destructive power, capable of tearing apart everything around it.

The Great Sage had forcibly invaded the Ritual Platform.  Wherever the dragon's tail reached, the illusions of the Platform were thrown into chaos.

The dragon’s tail was at the center of the storm.

The chaos signified that remnants of ancient divine powers were being awakened. Even the Great Sage dared not remain within the Ritual Platform for long.

The golden light on the scales flickered incessantly, like a pillar holding back the sea, relentlessly driving deeper into the Ritual Platform.

The Platform trembled violently.

With the storm at its core, waves of chaotic energy mixed with golden light erupted, spreading throughout the entire Platform.

Everyone within the Ritual Platform felt the terrifying tremors.

Qin Sang and Left Grandmaster hadn't yet recovered from the roars of the two beasts when they were stunned by this new development.

The storm at the depths of the Ritual Platform hadn't reached them yet, but they already felt its pressure.

And as the upper layers of illusion were consumed by the storm, they caught glimpses of something awe-inspiring amidst the chaos.

‘Boom!’

‘Boom!’

‘Boom!’

…

The dragon’s tail was unstoppable, piercing through layer upon layer of illusion.

Now, the old Daoist understood the Ghost Fang Kingdom’s true intentions.  He acted decisively, whipping his horsetail whisk upwards.

The whisk's threads lengthened wildly, shooting into the swirling primal chaos energy above.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’

The primal chaos energy reversed, swirling towards the Heavenly Prison at the center.


“Faster! Faster! Faster!”


The activation of the Heavenly Prison had been prepared in advance, making the process swift.  But retrieving it was far more difficult.

The old Daoist sensed the terrifying pressure above, his eyes bloodshot, knuckles cracking as he gripped the whisk.

As the primal chaos energy contracted, the outline of the fragmented map gradually reformed.

Suddenly, the primal chaos energy froze, as if bound by an unseen force.

The old Daoist felt his connection to the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons weaken, on the verge of losing control. He paled in shock.


He flicked his sleeve, and dozens of talismans shot out, exploding one after another as their power was unleashed, targeting the fragmented map.

He still struggled, attempting to wrestle the fragmented map from the Great Sage’s grasp, unwilling to lose the treasure.

In this critical moment, he even considered a desperate attempt to seize the Demon Calling Drum.

However, Grandmaster Ruoquan and the others had already grasped the situation.

Even at their peak, they wouldn’t dare face a Great Sage directly. Now, having severed their cultivation, reduced to the Hollow Profound realm, even the slightest ripple of the Great Sage’s power could obliterate them.

This was no longer a matter of self-sacrifice.


Even if everyone present sacrificed their lives, they couldn’t stop the Great Sage from seizing the map.


Even if the old Daoist managed to retrieve the fragmented map, he wouldn’t escape far. Death was inevitable.

Their only hope lay in a Grand Sovereign arriving in time to force the Great Sage to retreat.

“It’s a Great Sage! We can’t fight it! Run!”

Grandmaster Ruoquan shouted urgently.

The three Grandmasters poured their power into the Ritual Platform, changing its direction, leading their battle formation in a hasty retreat, abandoning all else.

The old Daoist finally came to his senses. He looked at the fragmented map with a complex expression, sighing heavily, then resolutely withdrew his horsetail whisk.

The old Daoist was the core of the battle formation.  With his decision made, their speed increased dramatically.

They had barely retreated when a blinding golden light flashed.  Looking up, they saw a massive golden hole appear above.

A dragon’s tail pierced through the illusions.

The White-Robed Demon King and the other demons had already gathered around the Demon Calling Drum, their faces alight with fanaticism and excitement as they gazed at the dragon’s tail.

‘Swish!’

The dragon's tail suddenly flicked, sending out a golden beam.

The primal chaos energy shattered, reverting to a small fragmented map, caught by the golden beam.

The dragon's tail swept up the map and the demons, ignoring the terrified Daoists, and swiftly retracted.

Though the Great Sage disdained to even glance at them, the golden beam still sent the Daoists reeling.

Fleeing with all their might, they couldn't escape the aftershocks of the golden light.  A powerful force slammed into them, sending them sprawling, coughing up blood.

The four Grandmasters, using all their power, could only protect the Daoist Grandmasters under their command.  The remaining forces inevitably suffered heavy casualties.

The dragon's tail retracted, but the golden hole remained.  The storm within the Ritual Platform raged on, intensifying.

Unlike the previous bursts of golden light, the Great Sage had truly shaken the foundation of the Ritual Platform, shattering the balance it had maintained for years.

Starting from the illusions pierced by the dragon's tail, the power of ancient divine abilities fueled the storm, spreading further, affecting more illusions, destabilizing the foundation, and causing greater chaos.

Tranquility was no more!

“No!”

Left Grandmaster snapped out of his daze, crying out in alarm.

Though he hadn't witnessed it directly, he could deduce what had happened from the signs.

The old Daoist and the others were now at the heart of the chaos.  If they couldn’t escape in time, their chances of survival were slim.

‘Swish!’

Left Grandmaster rushed to their aid without even pausing to call out to Qin Sang.


Qin Sang didn't follow. He simply watched the depths of the Ritual Platform, his face grim.
