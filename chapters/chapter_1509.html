<h1></h1><p>Thunderclouds gathered.</p><p>Clouds surged above the Great Pit.</p><p>Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>Qin Sang was closer to Yin Changsheng than the cultivators outside, and his senses were clearer. Even though he knew the Heavenly Tribulation wasn't aimed at him, he felt a primal unease.</p><p>"Finally, it's been drawn out!"</p><p>Qin Sang secretly sighed in relief.</p><p>He had played a guiding role in all of this.</p><p>After realizing escape from the underground cavern was impossible, Qin Sang racked his brains, dealing with Yin Changsheng's attacks while desperately pondering what he could do, searching for a chance to turn defeat into victory.</p><p>Initially, his target was the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool.</p><p>This was a move born of desperation. Enraging Yin Changsheng wouldn't change the fact that he was trapped; he would still have to fight. Moreover, Yin Changsheng never left the Blood Pool's side, making it impossible to easily succeed.</p><p>It was only when Yin Changsheng brought out the Suspended Sword Pavilion, seemingly placing Qin Sang in an inescapable predicament, that a sliver of hope emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed that Yin Changsheng's signs of madness were becoming more pronounced. The heretical art was eroding his mind and will; if he just persisted, Yin Changsheng would be not far from complete demonic possession.</p><p>Discovering this, Qin Sang finally found a breakthrough and immediately changed his strategy.</p><p>Yin Changsheng used a heretical art to evade tribulation and苟live on; his greatest fear was the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation was his inner demon!</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's tribulation lightning divine ability was merely for show, but it could draw out his inner demon.</p><p>However, to succeed, he had to seize the right moment to avoid being seen through by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Qin Sang used himself as bait, and through the Glazed Glass Hand, successfully launched a sneak attack with the Sun Divine Bird. Even if it didn't blast Yin Changsheng to death, he could unleash the tribulation lightning in the chaos.</p><p>It had succeeded!</p><p>As Qin Sang rejoiced, he felt utterly exhausted, both physically and mentally.</p><p>His external incarnation and Liuli were both completely drained.</p><p>The true essence within his body was also nearly depleted.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang always prepared an escape route before engaging in battle. This was the first time he had faced such a dangerous situation, leaving no room for retreat.</p><p>"As expected, it's directly a lightning tribulation."</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the might of the Heavenly Tribulation, and this thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>When breaking through a major realm, one faced the three tribulations of wind, fire, and lightning, as well as the inner demon tribulation. The Heavenly Tribulation that occurred every three hundred years was only a lightning tribulation, but its power was bound to be terrifying, aimed at striking the person dead.</p><p>Especially since Yin Changsheng had used a heretical art to evade tribulation, delaying it for countless years.</p><p>This Heavenly Tribulation was bound to be earth-shattering.</p><p>Thinking that he was also inside the underground cavern, so close to Yin Changsheng, Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine. He didn't dare hesitate, his figure flashed, and he appeared beside Liuli and his incarnation.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and put the external incarnation into the Corpse Puppet Pouch, recalled the Sun Divine Tree, and without a second glance at this battle's great contributor, tossed it all into the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>He was currently incapable of wielding this treasure.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang helped Liuli up and hid at the edge of the underground cavern. He囫囵swallowed a handful of spirit pills, then activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl to protect them both. They pressed tightly against the stone wall, wishing they could merge into it.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Liuli's delicate body was constantly trembling.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, and he sighed inwardly.</p><p>Just now, Liuli had actively released the brand, completely submitting to his control.</p><p>At that time, no matter what Qin Sang wanted to do, Liuli would have been unable to resist. He could even have easily left a certain suggestion in her mind.</p><p>She had chosen to trust Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't take advantage of her vulnerability.</p><p>Moreover, Liuli's contribution in dragging Yin Changsheng to the brink of demonic possession was immense.</p><p>He adhered to his principles. After sending out the three divine birds, he immediately severed the connection with Liuli, without making any unnecessary movements, not touching Liuli's mind and will, not even a tiny bit.</p><p>But, did that mean there were no hidden dangers?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Liuli's pale, pretty face. Judging by her current behavior, it was clearly not that simple.</p><p>To completely open oneself up and let another person control you, just the thought was terrifying.</p><p>Any slight trace would become Liuli's lingering nightmare. What kind of impact it would ultimately have, no one could predict.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the cicada slough inside the Thousand Jun Ring, which he hadn't had time to give to Liuli.</p><p>With the help of this treasure, could she still break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage as expected?</p><p>Amidst the flurry of thoughts.</p><p>The pressure grew increasingly intense.</p><p>Within the thick thunderclouds, the sound of thunder rumbled continuously. Azure electric arcs, like wild horses that had broken free, constantly leaped within the churning thunderclouds. Waves surged wildly towards the center, aiming at the Great Pit.</p><p>The point of lightning in the center of the thundercloud suddenly blazed, and countless electric arcs fell from the sky, instantly becoming like a torrential downpour.</p><p>The mountain peak shook violently.</p><p>Within the black mist, waves surged.</p><p>This was the place Yin Changsheng had chosen for his breakthrough, and he had made preparations for transcending tribulation.</p><p>But he had already fallen into demonic possession, and the Heavenly Tribulation had descended suddenly, leaving him no time to make further arrangements.</p><p>Under the bombardment of the endless tribulation lightning, the dome of the underground cavern was finally breached.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>Qin Sang personally witnessed the dome being pierced by the lightning storm.</p><p>Thunderclaps roared within the stone cavern, deafening, drowning out all other sounds.</p><p>Azure light stabbed the eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a look of horror flashing in their depths.</p><p>He didn't know how many Heavenly Tribulations Yin Changsheng had faced, but its power was terrifying to this extent.</p><p>The dazed look on Yin Changsheng's face had not yet dissipated. He suddenly looked up.</p><p>This time, it was a genuine Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>"Damn heavens!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's roar was drowned out by the thunder.</p><p>He didn't wait to be executed. He struck the Suspended Sword Pavilion forcefully. This treasure flew up with a series of crisp sounds, radiating a radiant glow like a rainbow, suddenly springing up, shooting out, and meeting the tribulation lightning.</p><p>In an instant, azure light and radiant glow intertwined, becoming a chaotic mess.</p><p>The sound of rumbling continued, the two forces colliding and mutually annihilating. Strange phenomena abounded. Between the radiant glows, azure threads danced, creating a bizarre kind of beauty.</p><p>The tribulation lightning had passed through the ancient restrictions of the dome and had been weakened.</p><p>But even so, the radiant glow was repeatedly shattered within the azure lightning.</p><p>This Heavenly Tribulation seemed to be the wrath of the Heavenly Dao, accumulated for who knows how many years, unleashed all at once.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning continued to bombard.</p><p>Azure lightning poured down.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion hovered high above Yin Changsheng's head, dutifully protecting its master.</p><p>Yin Changsheng unleashed his divine might, battling the tribulation lightning with all his strength, but was ultimately smashed into the ground along with the Suspended Sword Pavilion by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>The thunderclouds did not dissipate; he was still alive!</p><p>The residual lightning power roamed throughout the underground cavern.</p><p>The entire underground cavern was dyed an azure hue.</p><p>However, this was only the first wave of lightning tribulation. The churning speed of the tribulation clouds increased, and the electric arcs were clearly thicker than before.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang didn't have time to marvel at Yin Changsheng's resilience. He grabbed Liuli, pushed off the ground with his feet, and flew along the stone wall towards the outside of the Great Pit, preparing to use this opportunity to distance himself from the underground cavern.</p><p>As he was about to fly out of the Great Pit, Qin Sang's peripheral vision caught sight of something. In the center of the underground cavern, the ice coffin had been blasted away by the tribulation lightning at some point, and cracks had also appeared in the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool. The only ice platform that had been exposed outside had already disappeared.</p><p>Blood flowed out.</p><p>Inside the Blood Pool, a figure was struggling to break free.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's injuries were not life-threatening. Part of the restriction on her came from the restraints Yin Changsheng had placed on her, and the other part came from the Blood Pool.</p><p>The collapse of the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool had also blocked the aftermath of the tribulation lightning for her.</p><p>The restrictions on her body were finally partially undone, and she was desperately trying to break free from the shackles of the Blood Pool.</p>
