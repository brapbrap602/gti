<h1>Chapter 833: The Failed Attempt</h1><p>Only one person.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He sent out a signal and held his breath.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly had excellent eyesight. From afar, Qin Sang confirmed that this person was Xiang Yi!</p><p>Lady Liu, hidden in the deep sea, immediately activated the talisman upon receiving the signal.</p><p>The fish had taken the bait. Now was the time to hunt!</p><p>Xiang Yi was a renowned late-stage Core Formation expert, deeply trusted by the Merchant Alliance leader. Qin Sang believed his strength was likely no less than those at the peak of late-stage Core Formation and should not be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. His palm formed a loose grip, and the Ten Yama Banners silently appeared in his hand.</p><p>He had rehearsed the assassination countless times in his mind.</p><p>In one hand, he held the Dark Fiend Banner, and in the other, the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings.</p><p>He wouldn't rigidly wait for Lady Liu to activate the talisman. The moment of ambush was crucial. If a single strike could be fatal, it would be ideal, eliminating the need for further complications.</p><p>The escaping light streaked across the sea surface, pausing occasionally.</p><p>Xiang Yi was cautious, but he didn't suspect the Turtlewood as a trap. He was wary of sea beasts. Most cultivators venturing out these days were the same, fearing an encounter with the beast tide.</p><p>"Almost..."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his grip tightening.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>The sound of something piercing the air was sharp. As Xiang Yi was about to fly overhead, he suddenly paused again, observing his surroundings.</p><p>"Can't wait any longer!"</p><p>Qin Sang urged himself inwardly. Even with his concealment technique, at such close range, it would be difficult to escape Xiang Yi's spiritual sense.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang made his move, Xiang Yi immediately sensed the change. His eyes turned cold, and he shouted angrily, "Who's there!"</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>A vigorous figure leaped from the water, the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>Seeing the Twin-Headed Serpent, a strange look crossed Xiang Yi's face. He clearly hadn't expected such a powerful beast to be lurking in the shadows. He immediately became alert, fearing he had stumbled into a beast tide, and prepared to retreat.</p><p>But immediately after, Qin Sang appeared alongside the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>"An ambush! The Turtlewood is a trap!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was startled. With his experience, he instantly realized where the problem lay.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden attack, combined with the Twin-Headed Serpent, cut off Xiang Yi's escape route.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Nine Nether Demonic Fire erupted skyward. The Twin-Headed Serpent roared, its vertical pupils flashing, and endless wind blades shot out, more solid and sharper than before.</p><p>At the same time, the Twin-Headed Serpent extended its sharp claws and fiercely pounced on Xiang Yi.</p><p>After consuming the Tyrant Blood Fruit and nearly breaking through, its talent and physique had improved considerably. Now with its powerful body, it dared to engage in close combat with cultivators.</p><p>As Qin Sang unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, sword light flickered from his brow. The Ebony Sword flashed, disappearing and reappearing in the blink of an eye before Xiang Yi, accompanied by deafening thunder.</p><p>With a flick of the Ebony Sword, several sword shadows sealed the space around Xiang Yi, poised to pierce bloody holes in him.</p><p>The ambush was well-prepared, and Qin Sang's initial strike was overwhelming.</p><p>The shock on Xiang Yi's face hadn't yet faded. Upon seeing the Ebony Sword, he immediately recognized it and Qin Sang's identity. He exclaimed in surprise, "Daoist Qing Feng, it's you!"</p><p>"That useless Cui Ji!"</p><p>Xiang Yi cursed furiously. He understood the reason and wished he could tear Cui Ji apart.</p><p>Cui Ji had assured him that Daoist Qing Feng was dead, with no chance of survival.</p><p>Yet now, he appeared alive and well, ambushing him.</p><p>Although he had considered helping Cui Ji, he hadn't acted yet. Cui Ji had acted on his own, and now he was being implicated. He felt wronged.</p><p>Xiang Yi suppressed his anger. He sensed danger. The strength his opponent displayed was too strong, no wonder Cui Ji had failed.</p><p>He realized that after the Seven Kill Hall closed, Cui Ji had disappeared.  It was likely that he hadn't perished from the ancient restrictions within the hall but at the hands of Daoist Qing Feng!</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was no ordinary cultivator. Assessing the situation, he realized that since this was an ambush, there might be others besides this one person. He absolutely couldn't get entangled.</p><p>His eyes swept over the incoming attacks.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's methods were powerful, there were inevitably flaws. For an experienced cultivator like Xiang Yi, even the smallest flaw couldn't be hidden.</p><p>Xiang Yi was extremely calm and made a swift decision.</p><p>He had been on guard against beast attacks, so he wasn't flustered. A bright cyan light erupted from his body, activating his protective robe. Simultaneously, he pressed his palm to his dantian, and a red light flared.</p><p>His natal magic treasure appeared!</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent's sharp claws and wind blades struck the cyan light emanating from the protective robe.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The cyan light vibrated and dimmed abruptly.</p><p>But it didn't extinguish. Firstly, Xiang Yi's protective robe was of excellent quality. Secondly, Xiang Yi reacted swiftly, dodging quickly, and only endured the initial impact.</p><p>Although unharmed, Xiang Yi was still impacted by the tremendous force. His figure staggered, forced towards the demonic fire and the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The demonic fire surged.</p><p>Qin Sang displayed astonishing swordsmanship. The Ebony Sword was like a startling rainbow, making Xiang Yi's scalp tingle.</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't hesitate. He flung his natal magic treasure forward, attempting to force open an escape route. His natal magic treasure was a small red pagoda, rapidly spinning and showering red light.</p><p>The pagoda's power was at the pinnacle of mid-grade magic treasures. Coupled with Xiang Yi's powerful true essence, it didn't collapse when faced with the suppression of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. Without hesitation, he activated the Blood Defilement Divine Light.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The blood-red light darted out from a sword shadow, about to engulf the small pagoda.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>A white light suddenly shone from the base of the small pagoda. Then, a transparent bead popped out, blocking the pagoda at the critical moment. It rapidly expanded, taking the brunt of the Blood Defilement Divine Light.</p><p>The white bead lost its luster, and cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>This was also a magic treasure, albeit a low-grade one, which Xiang Yi had kept hidden inside the small pagoda. Even Qin Sang hadn't noticed it.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Xiang Yi laughed wildly, "Did you think I didn't know about your defiling magic treasure? That fool Cui Ji deserved to die! He told me the blood light came from those black banners! That sword is just a low-grade magic treasure, and that trick can only be used once, right?  You dream of destroying my natal magic treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.  Not only had Xiang Yi not panicked during the ambush, but he had also subtly set a trap, laying in wait for him and expending his Blood Defilement Divine Light.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't discouraged.</p><p>He had considered this possibility during his rehearsals.</p><p>When Cui Ji asked Xiang Yi to deal with him, he couldn't have failed to mention the Blood Defilement Divine Light.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light could only be used as a surprise tactic. If the opponent was prepared, it was almost impossible for it to be effective; being countered was to be expected.</p><p>The attack failed.</p><p>Qin Sang's movements didn't falter in the slightest. Without hesitation, he continued to attack with his magic treasures.</p><p>Xiang Yi was extremely cunning, completely avoiding a prolonged fight with Qin Sang.</p><p>Even if he were to counterattack, he wouldn't do it here, regardless of whether the opponent had reinforcements.</p><p>The small pagoda spun wildly, shooting red light, clashing with the Ebony Sword and scattering the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Xiang Yi desperately tried to open an escape route.</p>
