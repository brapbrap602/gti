<h1>Chapter 1138:  The Li Hong Demon King</h1><p>Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's arrival, things have been peaceful, without any major incidents.</p><p>Qin Sang occupies the former cave dwelling of Yun Youzi, located in the center of a grove of ancient trees within a basin.  Being in the Demon Realm, everything she sees feels new and exciting.</p><p>The morning air in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea is fresh and clean.</p><p>A seemingly misty cloud hangs over the basin, actually a manifestation of a spirit array, which doesn't block the sunlight.</p><p>At the basin's edge, a guard composed of demonic beasts and wood spirits diligently protects the Demon King's cave, preventing intruders.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's arrival, the guard has become even stricter.</p><p>Old Monkey even takes the trouble to personally guard the basin's entrance.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp cry breaks the peace.</p><p>'吱吱……'</p><p>From the canyon, a series of screeching howls from demonic monkeys echo.</p><p>They're giving a warning; an outsider is present.</p><p>Old Monkey, seated cross-legged atop a large rock on the cliff, looks like a cultivator, eyes closed, facing the rising sun, absorbing the purple qi, practicing his cultivation.</p><p>Hearing the cries, Old Monkey abruptly stands, a flash of sharp light in his eyes, lets out a low growl, leaps from the rock, transforming into a gust of demonic wind, and dashes towards the canyon entrance.</p><p>There, a man in feathered robes stands before the canyon.</p><p>Beside him stands a black fox with a white tail, its eyes darting around, looking extremely shrewd.</p><p>The man in feathered robes looks human; the demon guards cower before him, their expressions filled with intense fear, unable to approach.</p><p>This alone speaks volumes about his identity.</p><p>"Li Hong Demon King!"</p><p>Seeing him, Old Monkey is startled, waves away the lesser demons, and respectfully bows, saying, "Old Monkey greets the Li Hong Demon King.  We were remiss, please forgive our impoliteness."</p><p>"They were simply doing their duty, what offense is there?"</p><p>Li Hong Demon King smiles, not taking it amiss, his tone gentle. "I haven't visited Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea in years.  Is Elder Bamboo in his cave? I have important matters to discuss."</p><p>Old Monkey remains calm, replying,  "Reporting to the Demon King, our master is currently in secluded cultivation.  It's uncertain whether he can emerge today. I shall inform our master immediately, please wait a moment, your Majesty."</p><p>"Audacious!"</p><p>The white-tailed fox shouts angrily, "Our master is here on the orders of the Feather Demon King to deliver a message! Do you dare to keep our master waiting in this desolate wilderness?"</p><p>"Don't be rude!"</p><p>The man in feathered robes glares at the white-tailed fox, looking around. "The Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea is breathtakingly beautiful, truly deserving of its name. Waiting a short while is nothing. Go."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Old Monkey bows deeply, and turns to leave.</p><p>Watching Old Monkey's back, the feathered-robed man's eyes flicker. He turns towards the lush bamboo forest, appearing genuinely captivated by the scenery.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>Old Monkey returns.</p><p>"The master requests your presence…"</p><p>Li Hong Demon King and the white-tailed fox follow Old Monkey into the basin.</p><p>The white-tailed fox peeks around curiously, looking everywhere.</p><p>Old Monkey ignores him, leading them into the reception hall.</p><p>Inside the hall, a figure stands, but not the one they expected—it's the willow tree spirit.</p><p>"Greetings, Li Hong Demon King."</p><p>The willow tree spirit is equally respectful.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Li Hong Demon King frowns, displeased. "Where is Elder Bamboo?"</p><p>"The master is in secluded cultivation, at a critical juncture, unable to appear. He has instructed me…"</p><p>Before he finishes.</p><p>The white-tailed fox leaps out, ‘嗖’, pointing at the willow tree spirit and shouting, "Preposterous! Even if Elder Bamboo is in seclusion, does he not have even this small amount of time? I believe you're falsely representing the master! You insignificant willow demon, daring to prevent our master from seeing Elder Bamboo, jeopardizing important matters—can you bear the consequences?"</p><p>Pointed at rudely, the willow tree spirit stiffens.</p><p>Li Hong Demon King stands silently, clearly condoning the white-tailed fox's actions.</p><p>He sighs softly. "If the Demon King doesn't believe me, I can only report again…"</p><p>"No need…"</p><p>Suddenly, a deep voice booms from behind the hall, carrying a faint but palpable pressure.  "Bamboo has failed to greet you properly, I hope Daoist Friend Li Hong will forgive me."</p><p>Feeling this terrifying pressure, fear flickers in the white-tailed fox's eyes, its head shrinking back, its previous arrogance completely gone.</p><p>Li Hong, the Demon King, looked around the hall, his gaze sharp.  Seeing no one, he didn’t relax his guard, instead bowing respectfully towards the empty space.  "Li Hong pays his respects to Elder Zhu.  It has been many years. I hope you are well."</p><p>"Not well,"</p><p>A voice sighed softly. "Since your last visit, I've suffered a setback in my cultivation, forcing me into seclusion. I haven't found a solution to the underlying problem, so I cannot leave my dwelling. Your visit, at Yu's behest, concerns troop movements again, I presume? I've already ordered my subordinates to train diligently. How many more are you requesting this time?"</p><p>Li Hong replied, "With all due respect, Elder, my visit concerns two matters.  Firstly, the deployment of troops. The Abyssal Pit has risen again, bringing war, and this conflict could be devastating.  The humans have been pressing us relentlessly. Secondly, there is a matter of paramount importance..."</p><p>"Oh?  Something more important than troop movements?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Li Hong hesitated.  "Before I left, King Yu instructed me that this matter is of critical importance, to be delivered personally to you, not through a subordinate.  I fear…"</p><p>He glanced at the willow spirit waiting nearby, his meaning clear.</p><p>"As I said, my cultivation has suffered, preventing me from leaving. Did Yu truly insist on a personal delivery, not through the willow spirit?"</p><p>The voice was low, tinged with displeasure.  Even Li Hong felt the pressure.</p><p>He nodded resolutely. "Yes. It concerns Tianyao Hill and the fate of all Demon Kings.  Those younger beings lack the authority to deal with this, and their involvement would only cause panic."</p><p>"The fate of the Demon Kings?  So serious?"</p><p>A chuckle echoed in the void. "Since it requires a Demon King...Mingyue, the troubled times are upon us.  There is no point in hiding. Come forth and meet with Li Hong."</p><p>Li Hong looked up in astonishment at these words.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>A response came from the inner hall, followed by a figure entering, walking to Li Hong, smiling slightly, bowing, and saying softly, "Demon King Li Hong, this is likely our first meeting. My moniker is Mingyue."</p><p>Li Hong was stunned.</p><p>He had intended to use King Yu's name to test the waters, forcing Zhu to reveal himself.</p><p>Instead of Zhu, a stranger appeared.</p><p>This person possessed a pair of azure wings, their demonic aura incredibly pure, and emanating the unique power and presence of a Demon King—clearly a powerful, transformed demon.</p><p>And a stranger, completely unknown to him!</p><p>Then, the voice in the void spoke again. "Li Hong, Mingyue is my disciple. He is now also a transformed Demon King and is qualified to speak with you.  Mingyue will handle the rest…"</p>
