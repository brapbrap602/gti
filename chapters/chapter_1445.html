<h1>Chapter 1437: The Grand Assembly Begins</h1><p>On Mingzhu Island, after activating the Dan Ding令, Qin Sang quickly met Yinquan Zhenren.  Yinquan Zhenren sized Qin Sang up, sensing a difference from four months prior, though unable to pinpoint the reason. He never would have guessed that Qin Sang could achieve spirit body manifestation by refining a single Yinxiang Pill.</p><p>After brief pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>“There are rumors that the Hunmo Elder is buying something, supposedly related to the demonic path. We haven't received any concrete information yet,” Yinquan Zhenren said frankly, his tone heavy. The more urgent the Hunmo Elder is, the greater the rewards for success. Perhaps, the Hunmo Elder will become the most powerful figure in the North Sea.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang felt even more certain about his decision regarding the mysterious ice box. Having already offended the Hunmo Elder, it was unwise to further antagonize the Xuantian Palace.</p><p>For both the Hunmo Elder and the Xuantian Palace Master, the Storm Belt was not an insurmountable obstacle.  And he was not alone.</p><p>Thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind. He carefully chose his words, “I plan to attend the Wanmo Assembly, to broaden my horizons.  I also have three ancient formulas…”</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren's eyes lit up. Hearing Qin Sang's willingness to sell the formulas, he exclaimed joyfully, “Your decision is wise. Only our Dan Ding Mountain is interested in such ancient formulas; we can afford them and are willing to offer a price that will satisfy you!”</p><p>These sects skilled in alchemy are truly wealthy and powerful!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and asked, “Realperson, you’ll be attending as well, won't you? It's a gathering of demonic cultivators, and I'm somewhat uneasy. What precautions has Dan Ding Mountain taken for you, to prevent any unforeseen incidents?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren frowned.</p><p>Before he could speak, Qin Sang said, “To be frank, Realperson, I have a few enemies, and I'm worried about encountering them at the Wanmo Assembly. I'd like to borrow the strength of Dan Ding Mountain, just in case. Even if nothing happens after the assembly, I will still present the formulas. If I encounter trouble, the compensation will be discussed separately.  I presume Dan Ding Mountain wouldn't collude with those demonic cultivators.”</p><p>Qin Sang possessed sufficient strength and confidence. He would also have his own contingency plans. Dan Ding Mountain was merely a last resort, a precaution, most likely unnecessary.</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren understood Qin Sang's intentions. After a long silence, he smiled slightly, “Just to ensure your safe withdrawal? I wonder if I should hope you encounter danger or not.”  For him, befriending a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator who seemingly possessed many ancient formulas was worthwhile, even without compensation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, laughing heartily, “Realperson, just don't worry about me attracting the attention of demonic cultivators.”</p><p>“Dare they attack Dan Ding Mountain?”</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren chuckled, then thoughtfully added, “Your words have reminded me. I will make the necessary arrangements!”</p><p>Qin Sang then exchanged the unused items in his Qianjun Ring for spirit stones, planning to give them to Tan Hao for the auction a few days prior.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Mingzhu Island, his Qianjun Ring containing a new Dan Ding令 with even more intricate designs.</p><p>…</p><p>Hunmo Island.</p><p>Thanks to the Hunmo Elder's reputation, Hunmo Island is arguably the most famous island in the boundless sea. Hunmo Island is vast. Unlike other Yuan Ying cultivators who seal off the island containing their cave dwellings with large arrays, restricting entry to outsiders, the Hunmo Elder only occupies a fairy mountain in the north of Hunmo Island, shrouded in clouds, as his cultivation ground. The rest of the island is open to cultivators and commoners, with numerous prosperous cities.</p><p>No one knows the Hunmo Elder's origins. The Hunmo Elder has not established a sect, and has few disciples, almost akin to a solitary cultivator.</p><p>The Wanmo Assembly is held in the largest city on Hunmo Island, a city renamed Wanmo City during the first Wanmo Assembly.</p><p>Wanmo City is bustling with activity.  The streets are crowded, shoulder to shoulder. Cultivators are no longer uncommon; Foundation Establishment cultivators are frequently seen, and occasionally even Yuan Ying masters. Many low-level cultivators also came to join the excitement, or to accompany their elders. Fortunately, the city is large enough to accommodate so many cultivators.</p><p>On every street, heavily armored guards patrol, their eyes filled with a chilling killing intent, like killing machines. Even the most unruly cultivators dare not cause trouble here. At most, they might bicker a little, but the moment they notice the guards’ gaze, they discreetly disperse.</p><p>Although the Wanmo Assembly has yet to begin, clandestine trading sessions are already taking place in the corners of the city.</p><p>A powerful figure entered the city.  It was Tan Hao.</p><p>He didn't completely conceal his aura. Those ahead, sensing his Golden Core stage cultivation, paled, instinctively making way for him.</p><p>Tan Hao noticed the fearful glances around him, remaining calm and composed. He thought of his fellow disciples who joined the Kuiyin Sect with him.  Now, a mid-Yuan Ying stage expert, daring to snatch food from the tiger's mouth in front of powerful cultivators –  it put things in perspective.</p><p>Tan Hao touched his pouch at his waist, filled with spirit stones.  A map of Wanmo City flashed in his mind.  He strode forward, turning down several streets until he reached a grand wooden building, quickly entering.</p><p>The Wanmo Conference would begin in three days.  The most important auctions would take place here, held separately according to the value and type of treasures.</p><p>Before long, Tan Hao left the building and moved through the city again, according to his usual routine, making contact with various traders to procure items needed by himself and Qin Sang.</p><p>Three days passed quickly. The atmosphere in Wanmo City grew increasingly lively. Countless cultivators gathered, powerful figures rarely seen otherwise appeared frequently, even the fearsome guards felt the pressure and remained vigilant.</p><p>The first auction was about to begin. Tan Hao, wearing a hooded cloak, returned to the building, glancing upwards. Before the Wanmo Conference even started, he'd already acquired several spiritual items Qin Sang specifically requested.  With a bit of luck, he should easily gather everything needed.</p><p>Entering, Tan Hao didn't hide his cultivation.  A pretty young girl immediately approached, her expression respectful.  After a brief, quiet exchange, she led him upstairs.</p><p>Strangely, as they started up the stairs, the light dimmed suddenly. The stairs seemed endless.  Tan Hao patiently followed the servant, walking for what seemed like a long time before suddenly, light flooded the scene, and they entered a large hall.</p><p>A high platform stood at the center of the hall. Several people were already present. Tan Hao found a seat and waited for the auction to commence.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, in an unknown room within Wanmo City, several people in white robes, their auras concealed, sat quietly. Two sat at the head.</p><p>One, with a raspy voice, spoke, "The Grand Elder hasn't returned yet?"</p><p>The person beside him nodded. "That message was too ambiguous to be credible. However, the Grand Elder insisted on going.  Considering the time it takes to verify the information and return from the Demon Realm, he'll likely miss the final exchange."</p>
