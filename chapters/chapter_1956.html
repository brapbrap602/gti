<h1>Chapter 1947: Martial Arts Practice</h1><p>“Buns…?”</p><p>The innkeeper’s mouth twitched, his tone changing slightly.</p><p>Thankfully, Qin Sang was a distinguished guest invited by Qingyuan; otherwise, with his temperament, it would have been difficult for him to remain patient.</p><p>Qingyuan chuckled and shook his head, unsure of what to say.</p><p>The innkeeper fell silent for a while. “The Seven Heads Feast includes a dish called ‘Jade Pouch Treasure,’ made with seven precious fish species from the Blue Lake in the capital.  The bamboo shoots are thinly sliced like cicada wings to form the jade pouch, and the fish and other ingredients are marinated inside. It’s a true delicacy among delicacies. If it doesn't suit the Daoist's taste, I can prepare a separate main course…”</p><p>After ordering the Seven Heads Feast, the innkeeper went to the kitchen.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't truly trying to make things difficult for the innkeeper; he wanted to buy more time to consider his next move.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s true form stood somewhere, hands behind his back, gazing towards Jian County.</p><p>His expression was unusually grave, mentally running simulations over and over.</p><p>No matter how many times he ran the simulations, the answer remained the same—he couldn't do it!</p><p>He even doubted whether a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator could achieve it.</p><p>Qin Sang had never truly faced a Void Refinement cultivator head-on, but based on his own deductions, he could estimate their approximate capabilities.</p><p>Before a breakthrough to a higher realm, there would be no fundamental transformation.</p><p>Unless Qingyuan possessed unique cultivation techniques or abilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Baoshan's cultivation was too low, the gap between him and Qingyuan was like a chasm.  Based on this single encounter, it’s impossible to determine more.</p><p>If Qingyuan could perform similarly against a Divine Transformation cultivator, that would be truly terrifying; anyone wielding Daoist techniques in his presence would have to be cautious.</p><p>…</p><p>Drunk Fragrance Tower.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait and see what Qingyuan's intentions were.</p><p>Before the main course, cold dishes were served, all made with rare ingredients rarely seen by ordinary people. The tea was Yan Kingdom tribute tea.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the maids, leaving Yu Lang to serve tea and Tao Teng to assist.</p><p>Qingyuan took a sip of tea, looking out the window at the continuous houses stretching to the city walls.</p><p>The streets below were bustling.</p><p>The cries of vendors, the laughter of children, the greetings of New Year’s wishes, even the sounds of arguments.</p><p>Firecrackers, drums, the rhythmic thud of clappers…</p><p>After Lin Baoshan left, Qin Sang removed the restriction, and all the sounds poured into the private room, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p>"It's truly a time of celebration among humans."</p><p>Qingyuan seemed moved, sighing softly. "Daoist, did you also find the mountain too quiet after descending?"</p><p>"We cultivators must endure loneliness. I came down the mountain for other reasons, and it hasn't been long."</p><p>What Qin Sang said was true, but he omitted crucial information.</p><p>He turned his gaze to Qingyuan. "Have you been traveling everywhere, Daoist friend?"</p><p>"Indeed, I appreciate fine food and drink. Different places have their own unique character; even after seeing so much, there's always something surprising to discover."</p><p>Qingyuan smiled faintly, then quickly composed himself. "Unfortunately, not every place is like Yan Kingdom, prosperous and with its people living peacefully. Even within Yan Kingdom, it's not all joy; the human world is always filled with sorrow and joy, wind and rain."</p><p>"Is it only the human world? The sea of suffering is vast; how many can cross it?"</p><p>Since Qingyuan was so talkative, Qin Sang put aside his worries and echoed his sentiment.</p><p>This sigh came from the depths of his heart.</p><p>If ascending to immortality could free one from the sea of suffering, yet looking at the entire vast world, how many have successfully ascended?</p><p>Each realm is a hurdle, blocking countless people.</p><p>"You and I, we're better off than most."</p><p>Qingyuan pointed at Qin Sang, then at himself, suddenly turning to look at Yu Lang and Tao Teng, who were listening quietly.</p><p>"You are both scholars, studying the writings of sages. People often talk about humanity, the human way. What exactly is the human path?"</p><p>Yu Lang and Tao Teng were surprised that Qingyuan addressed them directly.</p><p>At this moment, they felt an inexplicable pressure, greater than when called upon by their teacher, causing them to sit up straight.</p><p>Yu Lang furrowed his brow, lost in thought.</p><p>After waiting a while, seeing his companion silent, Tao Teng boldly replied: "Parent-child affection, loyalty between ruler and subject, the distinction between husband and wife, order of seniority, and trustworthiness among friends."</p><p>Qingyuan responded, "This can be called the way of human relationships, applicable to governance."</p><p>Tao Teng didn’t receive praise, scratching his head, and after thinking for a while, recited:  "When the Great Way prevails throughout the land, all under Heaven share in common the same principles, selecting those of talent and ability, and emphasizing sincerity and harmony. Therefore, people do not confine their love only to their own parents and children, but ensure that the elderly have provision for their old age, the strong are usefully employed, the young are properly nurtured, and that all widows, widowers, the lonely, the orphaned, the disabled, and the infirm are cared for…"</p><p>Qingyuan smiled without speaking, turning to Yu Lang, "Little Daoist seems to have a different opinion?"</p><p>Yu Lang looked at his master, then at his companion.</p><p>In this room, only Tao Teng was a mortal.</p><p>He hesitated, not answering, but instead asking a question: "Are mortals destined to be mere lambs to the slaughter?"</p><p>What Tao Teng said, without external intervention, was naturally the most ideal world imaginable.</p><p>But the world contains not only humans, but also immortals, gods, demons, and spirits.</p><p>Mortals without extraordinary power are like pigs and dogs, subject to arbitrary slaughter.</p><p>Even if the mortal realm truly achieves the universal harmony spoken of by sages, without the ability to protect themselves, it is like a flower in a mirror, a moon in water.</p><p>For example, in Jien County, without the protection of Yu Cheng Huang and other deities, could the city enjoy such peace and tranquility today?</p><p>Can this kind of human-centered morality be considered the Great Way?</p><p>Tao Teng stared blankly at Yu Lang, somewhat confused. He couldn't understand the profound meaning of this question.</p><p>Qing Yuan's eyes lit up, and he laughed heartily, "At such a young age, to think of these things, and it seems you've given it serious thought.  It's truly remarkable. Your master has taught you well. This question, however, touches upon the debate of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism."</p><p>Having said this, Qing Yuan suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Then, a knock came on the private room door.</p><p>"Come in," said Qing Yuan.</p><p>A man dressed as an attendant gently pushed open the door, first bowing to the main seats, "Greetings to both gentlemen."</p><p>Then turning to Tao Teng, "Young Master, it's getting late. You should be leaving. My master sent me to fetch you."</p><p>"I…"</p><p>Tao Teng looked reluctant, not only because he didn't want to leave his friends, but also because he wanted to hear more of this gentleman's profound insights.</p><p>His intuition told him that this gentleman, like Qingfeng Daoist, was a master.</p><p>The attendant, however, lacked discernment, urging, "Young Master, your father is waiting for you downstairs."</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Tao Teng had no choice but to rise with a long sigh, grasping Yu Lang's hand tightly, "Yu Lang, you must come visit me in the capital city someday!"</p><p>Then he bowed to Qin Sang and Qing Yuan, and reluctantly left with the attendant.</p><p>"Mahayana, Hinayana…"</p><p>The main body and the incarnation at the Zui Xiang Tower were both momentarily lost in thought, repeating these two words in their hearts.</p><p>Subtly, it felt like they grasped something.</p><p>"This Mahayana is not that Mahayana, but there should be a connection."</p><p>Qing Yuan glanced at Qin Sang and continued, "Hinayana and Mahayana differ only in their pursuits, there is no superiority or inferiority.  Generally speaking, Hinayana focuses on self-cultivation, while Mahayana aims to cultivate others!"</p><p>Self-cultivation!</p><p>Cultivating others!</p><p>A flash of lightning seemed to race through Qin Sang's mind, instantly illuminating many of his previous doubts.</p><p>The path of Hinayana, cultivating oneself, ultimately leads to immortality, ascension, and transcendence.</p><p>And the ultimate goal of Mahayana?</p><p>This world contains not only humans, but also demons, witches, all living beings, and even the entire cosmos.</p><p>Could it be, to cultivate this heaven and earth with oneself?</p><p>"Shen Dao…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He had always harbored doubts about Shen Dao (the Way of the Gods).</p><p>Especially since he knew the origins of Shen Dao, which might be connected to the Dao Court.</p><p>Why did some people in the Dao Court switch to Shen Dao back then? What kind of theories did they follow?</p><p>Shen Dao cultivation relies on the offerings of incense and faith, which is clearly contrary to the Xian Dao (Immortal Dao) that Qin Sang had always known.</p><p>Xian Dao cultivation seeks ascension to immortality.</p><p>But Shen Dao?</p><p>If a Shen Dao cultivator ascends but cannot bring their believers to the immortal realm, even if it doesn't directly sever their faith, it would likely cause instability in the lower realm.</p><p>Unless the immortal and mortal realms can freely travel between each other.</p><p>Furthermore, the more believers a Shen Dao cultivator has, the more bound they are, how can they transcend?</p><p>So, there is also the Mahayana path in the world!</p><p>"Shen Dao can be considered Mahayana, but in my opinion, the current iteration of Shen Dao has deviated in some aspects, merely regarding humanity as nourishment for Shen Dao, failing to be the true orthodox human path.  The Mahayana path encompasses the world; cultivating merit, cultivating sagehood, cultivating blessings, cultivating concealed virtue... rooted in the human path.  In my travels, I've observed some promising developments, some even inspired by Shen Dao, whether it's the Kingly Way, the Sage Way, or other paths. The future holds promise. Perhaps one day, a hundred flowers will bloom, and the Great Way will contend, resolving the young Daoist's questions."</p><p>Qing Yuan spoke eloquently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't, nor wanted to, interrupt. He just wanted Qing Yuan to continue.</p><p>The joy of hearing the Dao!</p><p>That's precisely how Qin Sang felt now.</p><p>This chance encounter was sudden and unexpected.</p><p>Meeting a kindred spirit and hearing the Dao from a stranger seemed absurd, raising concerns about potential traps.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could judge for himself. He had already had a vague understanding, but it lacked systematization.</p><p>Qing Yuan's discussion of the Dao perfectly aligned with his thoughts and was even more comprehensive.</p><p>It not only resolved many of Qin Sang's doubts.</p><p>Even more so, hearing these words, Qin Sang's own understanding of his cultivation subtly shifted.</p><p>Yu Lang's cultivation wasn't high enough to grasp the deeper meaning, and he was still preoccupied with his own questions.</p><p>Upon hearing these words, his brow remained furrowed.</p><p>His thoughts couldn't be hidden from the eyes of the two others.</p><p>The young Daoist seemed somewhat unwilling to accept things.  He mused, “Whether it’s the way of the gods, the way of kings, or the way of saints, mortals always depend on others and cannot truly control their own destinies, isn’t that so?”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled slightly.  “You only see cultivators as the butcher and mortals as the fish.  Don’t you see that among cultivators and among mortals themselves, there is also strength and oppression?  I put the young lady from the Yin family and the Jinen ghosts into my story; what can they do to me? If everyone could cultivate, wouldn't Qi Refinement cultivators become like ordinary people today? And could the world even bear it?  Haven't you seen how locusts leave nothing behind when they pass?”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked at his disciple and said gravely, “Have you forgotten the Master’s words? A person without ambition cannot stand, but beware of empty talk and unrealistic aspirations.”</p><p>“That’s right. There’s a saying among mortals: ‘One who is not in a position should not plan the government.’ If you want to change this world… well, at least catch up to your master first.”</p><p>Qingyuan finished his cup of tea and picked up the teapot.</p><p>“Disciple humbly accepts your teachings,” Yu Lang, seeming to awaken from a dream, quickly took the teapot and refilled Qingyuan and his master’s cups.</p><p>The tea poured softly. His thoughts seemed to calm down as he sat upright, his brow unfurrowed. Qin Sang and Qingyuan resumed their previous conversation.</p><p>“In the cultivation world, the debate concerning Small Vehicle and Great Vehicle cultivation is becoming increasingly heated, especially within the Buddhist schools. However, there are exceptions, such as the Dandian lineage of the Daoist school. Though they cultivate Small Vehicle methods, they possess the bearing of Great Vehicle cultivators!”</p><p>Qingyuan showed admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang was moved and couldn’t help but ask, “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Qingyuan took his folding fan and drew a large circle in the air.</p><p>“In this vast world, the five elements’ spiritual energy is everywhere.  Cultivating by comprehending the five elements is, compared to other paths, relatively easy.</p><p>“Once you enter the path of cultivation, and then switch to another method, it's like building a bridge over a chasm.  Though this bridge leads in a different direction, walking on land is undoubtedly easier than flying directly across the chasm.</p><p>“Legend says that this bridge originated from the Daoist Dandian lineage!</p><p>“In the beginning, the Daoist school combined the five elements and created the Golden Core method, directly pointing to the Great Dao.  They then passed this cultivation method down to all.</p><p>“From then on, human cultivation seemed to find its foundation. Regardless of school or sect, cultivators first cultivated the five elements to enter the path of cultivation, then gradually clarified their own paths and pursued their own ways. This became the fundamental principle of all methods!</p><p>“The flourishing of humanity, surpassing all the races in the world, is largely thanks to the Daoist school!</p><p>“Five-element spiritual roots also became the most important criteria for judging human talent.</p><p>“The cultivation realms of the Dandian lineage—Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even Great Vehicle—also became prevalent and increasingly refined.</p><p>“Each breakthrough in realm is accompanied by a transformation. The rules are clear and convincing, and they are now considered the standard by the world.</p><p>“Therefore, the Dandian school’s naming of the final realm as ‘Great Vehicle’ was certainly not arbitrary!</p><p>“Cultivating to improve oneself, and using the Dao to improve others – what a great merit this is!”</p><p>These words deeply shocked Qin Sang. In the Talisman World, he had read some records about the Dandian lineage in Daoist scriptures, knowing that the Dandian school and the Talisman school were once considered the two most important schools of Daoism.</p><p>Due to limited texts, Qin Sang could only guess that the Dandian school might have later declined, or perhaps had disputes with the Talisman school, leading to their separation.  </p><p>During the Talisman school's heyday, their power was astonishing.</p><p>But Qin Sang had not imagined that the achievements of the Dandian school were in no way inferior to the later Talisman school!</p><p>Currently, the vast majority of cultivators enter the immortal path through the five elements, all thanks to the Daoist school!</p><p>“Food’s here!”</p><p>A shout came from outside the private room.</p><p>A waiter quickly came to the door, knocked twice gently, opened the door, and held a tray.</p><p>The tray held a dish of exquisite artistry, steaming hot and emitting a rich aroma.</p><p>The fragrance filled the room instantly.</p><p>The dish was pleasing to the eye, nose, and palate, making everyone hungry.</p><p>The waiter beamed, “The first course, ‘Phoenix Welcoming Spring!’”</p><p>Along with the dish came a pot of wine. “This is top-quality ‘Drunken Spring Breeze’ wine, please enjoy.”</p><p>The waiter bowed slightly and left the private room.</p><p>Qingyuan put down his fan and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“If the Dandian lineage was like this, then what magnificent achievements must the Talisman school, once known as the Great Vehicle school of Daoism, have had?”</p><p>“I have always longed for it!”</p>
