<h1>Chapter 1343: Void Storm</h1><p>Chapter 1343: Void Storm</p><p>After absorbing countless wraiths, the Soul Gathering Dou became solid.</p><p>Ye Laomo, observing Yu Gu's actions, knew this demon was inherently rebellious and wouldn't listen to him.  He chose to remain silent.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A sudden thunderclap!</p><p>Shaking the inner and outer courtyards of Ziwei Palace.</p><p>The blood-red altar was affected, its blood light flickering erratically.  Since the strange phenomena appeared in Ziwei Palace, this was the first time the altar showed such violent fluctuations.</p><p>Ye Laomo was slightly startled and abruptly looked up.</p><p>Thick ghost mist obscured the inner hall, making it impossible to see what was happening inside.</p><p>But at the end of the soaring blood light, the sky seemed to be torn apart, the void collapsing. A grey storm blotted out the sky, even more terrifying than the depths of the ancient Immortal battlefield.</p><p>Seeing this apocalyptic scene, Ye Laomo's heart was agitated, his breathing quickened, his expression shifting rapidly. His gaze towards the blood-red altar was complex, filled with both eagerness and worry.</p><p>Yu Gu withdrew his gaze from the Soul Gathering Dou, glanced towards the inner hall, let out a strange laugh, and turned his gaze to the blood-red altar, coldly shouting, "Merge!"</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Threads of blood shot back from all directions.</p><p>One by one, the blood infants were recalled, circling the two before merging into the blood-red altar and the ancient blood prohibitions, making their forms almost invisible.</p><p>Yu Gu rapidly tapped his fingers, sending streams of runes towards the altar, his movements unusually busy.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A violent wind suddenly arose!</p><p>Countless extremely complex and mysterious runes appeared on the altar, suddenly shining brightly.</p><p>An unprecedented wave of energy erupted from the altar, shooting straight into the heavens!</p><p>The blood light was torn apart by the wave, and the area around the altar was filled with storm-like, violent energy.</p><p>Ye Laomo was impacted, groaning softly. He quickly channeled his true energy, forcibly stabilizing himself. Witnessing the astonishing spectacle caused by the altar, his eyes revealed a degree of shock.</p><p>He and Yu Gu hovered above the altar, surrounded by the storm.</p><p>The center of the storm was the top of the altar.</p><p>There, a faint layer of green light appeared, ancient runes projecting into the void, forming a shadowy image, seemingly an ancient formation, slowly rotating.</p><p>The altar continued to violently shake.</p><p>Yu Gu stopped, staring intently at the altar, sensing the energy emanating from it, and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>Ye Laomo licked his lips, his voice hoarse and urgent.</p><p>"That depends on when the strange phenomena in Ziwei Palace end."</p><p>Yu Gu glanced towards the inner hall and calmly said.</p><p>Before his words finished, he grabbed the Soul Gathering Dou, took a step forward, and then his figure flickered, disappearing from Ye Laomo's sight.</p><p>Ye Laomo remained motionless.</p><p>A look of displeasure flashed in his eyes, which he quickly suppressed.</p><p>…</p><p>Neither of them noticed.</p><p>Not far from the blood-red altar.</p><p>Among countless wraiths and ghosts, a person stood motionless.</p><p>There was nothing to obstruct him, standing there openly.</p><p>Not only did Yu Gu and Ye Laomo fail to notice him, but even the wraiths and ghosts passing by, and the drifting blood clouds, were completely unaware of his presence.</p><p>His body was enveloped in death energy, blending seamlessly with the ghost mist, perfectly concealed.</p><p>This person was Bai!</p><p>As Qin Sang had predicted, the ghost mist and blood clouds not only didn't hinder him, but within the ghost mist, his abilities were enhanced, making him stronger than outside.</p><p>However, Bai didn't go back to find Qin Sang. He remained there, looking up, not at Ye Laomo or Yu Gu, but at the blood-red altar itself, and the mysterious ancient blood prohibitions.</p><p>Bai's eyes were greyish-white, lacking pupils, motionless, and extremely empty.</p><p>His expression showed bewilderment, his brows tightly furrowed, as he was struggling to recall something.</p><p>Upon seeing the strange phenomena at the altar.</p><p>Bai's eyes finally moved, the bewilderment on his face gradually fading, replaced by shock. His eyes grew brighter and brighter, his gaze shifting between the altar and Yu Gu.</p><p>Finally, Bai took one last deep look at the blood-red altar and slowly retreated.</p><p>The next moment, Bai paused slightly, turning his head to the side.</p><p>…</p><p>Ziwei Palace inner hall.</p><p>The continental fragments floating in the outer areas were now nowhere to be found, having been crushed to dust and dispersed by the five-colored immortal wind, leaving a chasm between the inner and outer halls.</p><p>The inner hall was even more chaotic and on the verge of collapse than when Qin Sang had left.</p><p>The void storm Ye Laomo saw was just the tip of the iceberg; the inner hall was the source.</p><p>The sky was dark.</p><p>Leaden clouds hung low.</p><p>The Five-Colored Immortal Wind was no mere hurricane; it was a terrifying maelstrom of wind and heavenly thunder, like a spatial distortion, wreaking havoc throughout the inner hall. The entire hall trembled, threatening to be overturned by the gale.</p><p>Yet, the scene possessed a strange beauty. The inner hall glowed with vibrant colors as the ancient prohibitions were activated by the wind, revealing the full splendor of the Immortal Palace. Even in its ruined state, it remained magnificent and breathtaking.</p><p>Few, however, had the leisure to appreciate the ancient cultivators’ masterpiece. Several figures were fleeing. Their greed had led them to linger too long.  When they finally realized the danger, the inner hall’s phenomena had become extremely perilous, forcing them to escape.</p><p>They struggled through the ancient prohibitions, their escaping lights mere specks in the overwhelming Five-Colored Immortal Wind, tiny and fragile. Suddenly, one light vanished.  A flash of azure light erupted from that spot – another ancient prohibition had been triggered, claiming a victim.  After a long while, the light did not reappear; the chances of survival were slim.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Ghost Mist.</p><p>After subduing the Blood Infant, everyone used secret techniques to analyze the evil array. The Blood Infant was linked to the array; more precisely, it was part of the array. They had made new discoveries, but with only one Blood Infant, cracking the array was far from easy.</p><p>Their numbers had increased. Another group of cultivators, sensing the clash between Qin Sang and the Blood Infant, joined them, outnumbering Qin Sang’s group. Even more surprising was the presence of True Person Cang Hong. With three top experts together, their safety was secured.</p><p>“Unless I’m mistaken, Daoist Tongyou should be in that direction. Daoist Leng and the others were separated first, and I didn’t see which way they went…”</p><p>True Person Cang Hong pointed to the left. They were of one mind;  he and True Daoist Zhang shared the same plan:  find more allies, gather enough people to form an array, and then confront Ye Laomo at the Blood Sacrifice Altar. Otherwise, it would be a suicide mission.  He had been luckier, having several fellow cultivators nearby when they were separated, and had gathered quite a few people since then.</p><p>After deliberation, they decided to join up with Demon Lord Tongyou first.  Qin Sang and his Yuan Ying puppet led the way again.  They faced increasing resistance, yet their speed increased.  After covering a certain distance, Qin Sang, while using his ebony sword to slay wraiths, sensed something and his expression shifted slightly. (To be continued.)</p>
