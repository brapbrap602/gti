<h1>Chapter 2068: Return!</h1><p>Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Sword Path Ancient Hall.</p><p>The teleportation formation, silent for a century, suddenly shimmered with faint light.</p><p>The light flickered.</p><p>Soon after, a figure materialized on the formation, stumbling slightly.  Qin Sang steadied himself, gripping a stone pillar at the edge of the formation.</p><p>His face was pale. He shook his head, and upon seeing the familiar surroundings, a look of deep emotion crossed his features.</p><p>The ancient hall.</p><p>The sacrificial altar.</p><p>The spirit formation.</p><p>After more than a hundred years, he had finally returned.</p><p>This time, he experienced the teleportation process while conscious, the sensation far more vivid.</p><p>Even with his current cultivation level, he felt dizzy and disoriented, even experiencing the illusion of his body being torn apart. The spatial pressure and distortion during the teleportation were incomparable to the ancient formation in Shangyuan Clear Serenity Palace.</p><p>He silently circulated his cultivation technique, gradually recovering.</p><p>His breathing evened out.</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang realized he was holding the very pillar Qingzhu had once touched.</p><p>Seeing the two incomplete Killing Talismans etched upon it, he was stunned.</p><p>Back then, Qingzhu was still alive, yet due to a series of unfortunate events, they had missed the chance to meet.</p><p>When they finally did meet, it was followed by an eternal farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang gently rubbed the Qianjun Ring on his finger.</p><p>Qingzhu's remains were within the ring.</p><p>In the Nether Valley, Qin Sang discovered Qingzhu had passed away peacefully beneath a peach tree. Following Qingzhu's last wishes, he condensed an ice coffin and brought his body back, intending to deliver it to the place mentioned in Qingzhu's death poem.</p><p>Qingzhu's homeland.</p><p>That place wasn't within a cultivation sect, but like Shaohua Mountain, it was on the edge of the vast Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>After laying Qingzhu to rest, Qin Sang meticulously set up protective restrictions in the Nether Valley, safeguarding the peach tree from the encroaching nether energy.</p><p>He prayed the peach tree would never wither.</p><p>There was also Qingzhu's death poem inscribed on the cliff face, which was also a supreme sword scripture, embodying Qingzhu's lifelong comprehension of the Sword Dao and the Killing Dao.</p><p>Especially for Qin Sang, who cultivated the same technique as Qingzhu, it was an invaluable treasure!</p><p>Filled with gratitude, Qin Sang bowed respectfully to Qingzhu. He meticulously memorized the sword scripture, then copied it onto a jade slip.  He retrieved the Killing Sword fragment but left the inscription on the cliff untouched.</p><p>This was Qingzhu's last mark upon the world.</p><p>But Qin Sang would carry on Qingzhu's legacy.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  The Killing Sword fragment appeared in his palm.</p><p>Because of the complete character 'Kill' etched upon it, Qin Sang called it the Killing Sword.</p><p>Gazing down at the character, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Even in its fragmented state, the sword emanated a mysterious aura, affecting one's mind and spirit.</p><p>The complete Killing Sword must have been an unimaginable treasure, beyond the comprehension of contemporary cultivators!</p><p>When Qin Sang acquired the Killing Sword fragment, the grey qi that was the sword spirit had whooshed into the fragment.</p><p>Recalling Qingzhu's words, Qin Sang hadn't interfered.</p><p>Of course, he hadn't forgotten Qingzhu's warning. Until the sword spirit awakened, its nature remained unknown. He had to be prepared, lest the sword spirit turn against him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the sword spirit entered the Killing Sword fragment, Qin Sang regretted it.</p><p>…</p><p>Even at the Core Formation stage, Qingzhu could barely control the Killing Sword fragment, using it to severely injure Leng Yuntian after Leng Qian's discovery. This demonstrated the fragment's power.</p><p>However, after the sword spirit merged with it, Qin Sang found a new resistance when attempting to activate the fragment.</p><p>It was definitely related to the dormant sword spirit.</p><p>Whether the sword spirit was subconsciously resisting or using the Killing Sword's power to nourish itself was unclear.</p><p>Forcing the sword spirit out would be difficult. Weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang chose to leave it be. He wasn't lacking in trump cards.</p><p>The sword spirit would recover much faster within the Killing Sword fragment than within him. The sooner it awoke, the sooner it could help him find the other fragments and the complete cultivation technique.</p><p>Now, the Killing Sword fragment was being nurtured within his Qi Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply curious about the Killing Sword's origins.</p><p>The shattered Killing Sword and the torn "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" were found in the same place.  A cultivator who mastered the technique could wield the fragment, highlighting the close connection between the two.</p><p>What would it be like when he obtained the complete technique and restored the Killing Sword's might?</p><p>"Ziwei Palace, Seven Kills Hall…"</p><p>These two secret realms flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He suspected that if the Seven Kills Hall was once a peerless immortal sect, the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" was likely its core inheritance.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower, Leaning Heaven Peak, and the lingering sword intent were all proof.</p><p>Ziwei Palace was also inextricably linked to them.</p><p>The first part of the cultivation technique and the sword spirit were both obtained in Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang suspected that these two secret realms might not be all.  Perhaps other fragments existed in other cultivation worlds. If these worlds were enveloped by the endless storm, finding them would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>The two locations were connected by teleportation formations.</p><p>After reaching Nascent Soul, he would thoroughly explore them, searching for clues.</p><p>The most alluring prospect was undoubtedly the shadow of the Immortal Palace within the Seven Kills Hall's immortal restriction.</p><p>Unlike the chaotic and desolate Seven Kills Hall, the Immortal Palace appeared complete, emanating an ethereal immortal aura. Qingzhu had only briefly explored the jade corridor and found the Lesser Spatial Shift Talisman, a lost supreme divine talisman.</p><p>One could only imagine the treasures hidden within those immortal palaces!</p><p>He was the only cultivator who knew how to enter the immortal restriction.  However, the jade corridor didn't directly lead to the Immortal Palace. He would need to expend effort to investigate.</p><p>After burying Qingzhu, Qin Sang returned to the immortal restriction, locating the hidden path Qingzhu had found on the jade corridor. Using talismans to clear the way, he found the ancient teleportation formation within the restriction.</p><p>He wanted to search for other paths, but after the trials and the battles on Leaning Heaven Peak, time was running out.</p><p>The immortal restriction was fluctuating.</p><p>Soon, both the Seven Kills Hall and Ziwei Palace would close.</p><p>Leaving Ziwei Palace didn't require the Lesser North Star Primordial Formation. When Ziwei Palace sealed, the outer formations would momentarily pause, the vortex briefly calming. This was the only opportunity for cultivators to leave.</p><p>Before departing, he had a few things to do.</p><p>"How are you?"</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his voice to Bai.</p><p>He adjusted his state.</p><p>He didn't know what the situation in Xiao Han Domain had become. He had to be extremely cautious.</p><p>If the ancient demon summoned by Sin Abyss possessed power comparable to the Demon Lord sealed beneath Leaning Heaven Peak, Xiao Han Domain and the Heavenly Alliance might have already been devastated.</p><p>In that case, he would retrieve the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid, go into hiding to cultivate, and wait for Ziwei Palace to reopen before escaping back to Canglang Sea.</p><p>However, with the successive deaths of top experts from both the Human and Witch Clans, Canglang Sea was likely also in turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the token given to him by the Four Saints Palace descendant, lost in thought.</p><p>Fairy Nangui had mentioned a Nascent Soul cultivator among the Four Saints.</p><p>Since the Four Saints Palace was a Nascent Soul sect, forming a connection with them wouldn't be detrimental.</p><p>When the opportunity arose, he would definitely pay them a visit. They should be able to answer many of his questions. (Happy New Year, everyone!)</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p><p>39314494..</p><p>...</p>
