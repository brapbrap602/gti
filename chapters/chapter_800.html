<h1>Chapter 792: Revenge</h1><p>Hearing Madam Liu's shout, Cui Ji immediately became alert, figuring it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>But he didn't stop pursuing Madam Liu. His flying knives, combined with the Purple Gloom Pearl, created a relentless wave of attacks, forcing Madam Liu into a desperate defense. Her defeat seemed imminent.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng!"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the shadows. Two cries of surprise rang out simultaneously.</p><p>One was filled with joy, the other with disbelief.</p><p>Cui Ji looked as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>He had witnessed Qin Sang's magical treasure being destroyed, Qin Sang severely injured, and falling into a horde of ferocious beasts. There was no way he could have survived, yet here he was, standing before him.</p><p>Madam Liu remembered the animosity between Qin Sang and Cui Ji. Seeing Cui Ji's expression, she immediately realized that there was something fishy about Qin Sang's disappearance in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. Something unknown had happened.</p><p>"Daoist, you..."</p><p>In that instant, Madam Liu guessed a lot, her face filled with ecstasy.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, interrupting Madam Liu. His tone was calm. "Thanks to Fellow Daoist Cui, I nearly perished in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. However, I was fortunate enough to escape. Madam Liu, since you are also here for revenge, why don't we join forces to kill this man first..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang pointed his sword at Cui Ji. The Ebony Sword flashed, passing Madam Liu and slashing towards Cui Ji.</p><p>In his eyes, Cui Ji was already a dead man. He didn't bother wasting words on him.</p><p>Madam Liu understood. Hope ignited in her eyes. She stopped running and hurriedly took out a bell, the same magical treasure used by the Liu Clan cultivator before.</p><p>Seeing the bell, Madam Liu's face was filled with grief, and her hatred for Cui Ji deepened.</p><p>A fierce look appeared on Madam Liu's face as she poured her true essence into the bell without reservation.</p><p>The bell swayed gently in her fingertips, emitting a clear ringing sound. Circular sound waves spread out, targeting Cui Ji's flying knives.</p><p>These were clearly not ordinary sound waves. The ripples shone with a dazzling red light, like rings of fire, becoming tangible.</p><p>The fire rings radiated intense heat, containing abundant fire elemental power. As they spread, the surrounding area transformed into a sea of fire.</p><p>The flying knives were caught off guard, enveloped by the sound waves.</p><p>Cui Ji's expression changed. The moment he saw Qin Sang, he knew something was wrong. He hastily recalled his flying knives.</p><p>Silver light surged as the knives unleashed sharp blade auras.</p><p>But the bell was clearly no ordinary magical treasure. Even though Madam Liu's cultivation was weaker, by fully activating the bell, she could hold off the flying knives for a short time.</p><p>Madam Liu desperately entangled the flying knives, buying time for Qin Sang.</p><p>She was gambling. The first time they met, Cui Ji was on the verge of a breakthrough, yet he seemed very wary of Qin Sang. This suggested that Qin Sang's strength was far greater than it appeared.</p><p>The astonishing power of the Ebony Sword further confirmed her guess.</p><p>By now, the Ebony Sword had already reached Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji still wanted to spout some harsh words, but Qin Sang and Madam Liu had already coordinated their attack, turning to kill him in an instant. The situation became tense.</p><p>His cultivation had greatly improved, and although he faced a two-on-one attack, he wasn't panicked. He believed he had a good chance of winning. His only concern was Qin Sang's ability to taint magical treasures.</p><p>Cui Ji manipulated his flying knives to break free while using the Purple Gloom Pearl to intercept the Ebony Sword.</p><p>But as soon as they clashed, Cui Ji's expression changed.</p><p>The Ebony Sword and the Purple Gloom Pearl were locked in a stalemate, weaving through countless purple glows.  The swordsmanship was unpredictable, sometimes like a tiger roaring in the mountains, sometimes like a gentle breeze and drizzle.</p><p>Moreover, the offensive never slowed down, like flowing mercury. Cui Ji felt suffocated.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang was skilled in swordsmanship, but he had never displayed such oppressive swordsmanship before. A single flying sword made him involuntarily feel a chill in his heart.</p><p>Cui Ji didn't know that the Qin Sang of the past couldn't have done this. His so-called swordsmanship realm was just an empty framework granted by his cultivation technique. Only now was he a true swordsman.</p><p>Strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>Qin Sang gave Cui Ji no chance to breathe. He flashed forward and flung his palm. The Ten Yama Banner spiraled out, and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire rushed towards Cui Ji, who stared in horror.</p><p>The flying knives finally broke free from the bell's restraints. Although Cui Ji worried about his knives being tainted, he couldn't afford to hesitate. He urged the knives to block the demonic fire.</p><p>The strength displayed by Qin Sang made him terrified. The thought of retreat arose in his heart.</p><p>Madam Liu failed to stop the flying knives. Seeing Cui Ji's actions, she became anxious and quickly flew towards him.</p><p>"Daoist, don't let that villain escape..."</p><p>Before Madam Liu could finish, a deafening beast roar erupted.</p><p>She was surprised to find a beastly shadow within the demonic fire. Taking advantage of the entanglement between the demonic fire and the flying knives, it fiercely lunged at Cui Ji.</p><p>The beastly shadow was extremely fast. In the instant it pounced, it split into several shadows, surrounding Cui Ji, making it difficult to distinguish the real one.</p><p>"Demon Core Realm Spirit Beast!"</p><p>Cui Ji was horrified.</p><p>He thought he had figured out how Qin Sang survived. He actually had such a powerful spirit beast, yet had never revealed it.</p><p>Cui Ji had lost all will to fight, but the situation was clearly no longer under his control.</p><p>While Cui Ji was hastily dealing with the Two-Headed Serpent, with Madam Liu's help, Qin Sang focused on controlling his sword, pushing back the purple glows. The flying sword, like a rainbow piercing the sun, easily broke through Cui Ji's protective true essence.</p><p>Cui Ji's face was filled with terror. In his haste, he could only forcefully slam the Purple Gloom Pearl forward.</p><p>The Purple Gloom Pearl's main body seemed very fragile.  A direct collision with the Ebony Sword dimmed its luster, and Cui Ji's face paled.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was knocked askew, but a sword beam successfully pierced Cui Ji.</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>Cui Ji screamed, his face ashen.</p><p>Injured on top of injury, Cui Ji's death was sealed.  His flying knives momentarily faltered, giving Qin Sang an opening. He condensed the demonic fire, knocking them away, then urged his magical treasures and the Two-Headed Serpent to mercilessly finish off Cui Ji.</p><p>Seeing revenge within reach, Madam Liu fought even more desperately, her eyes bloodshot, like a madwoman, causing Qin Sang to look at her askance.</p><p>Finally, with a despairing scream, Cui Ji was pierced through the heart by the flying sword and died.</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed a Spirit Pill to restore his true essence. His spiritual sea felt empty. The continuous battles, constantly suppressing Cui Ji, had consumed a lot of energy, yet he felt invigorated.</p><p>He had killed Cui Ji in one fell swoop without injury.  His breakthrough in swordsmanship had greatly increased his strength. After some refinement, his swordsmanship alone would make him a match for Cui Ji.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to Cui Ji's corpse and unceremoniously looted his belongings, putting them into his storage pouch.</p><p>Cui Ji died with his eyes wide open, having just broken through his bottleneck only to meet his demise.</p><p>As Qin Sang examined his spoils, Madam Liu stared blankly, speechless.</p><p>Turning around, Qin Sang saw Madam Liu's tear-streaked face, a stark contrast to her previous frenzy. Cui Ji's chest and abdomen were a mangled mess, mostly Madam Liu's handiwork.  His innards mixed with blood flowed onto the ground, the stench of blood pungent.</p>
