<h1>Chapter 685: On the Right Track</h1><p>One month after discovering the Flood Dragon's trail.</p><p>Back in the cave, the elderly couple and the other three had returned at some point. All five were in the main hall, restless, but Qin Sang was absent.</p><p>“The Daoist's speed is beyond our reach. Why hasn't he returned yet? Could it be…”</p><p>The Wang sisters furrowed their brows, their voices filled with deep worry. “If something happened to the Daoist, will the Merchant Guild blame us for our poor investigation, for harming the Daoist?”</p><p>The elderly couple appeared relatively calm. “The Daoist's strength is extraordinary. Even a Core Formation demon wouldn't be able to easily defeat him. Don't worry. We'll wait another day. If…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, the old woman's expression suddenly changed, and she darted out of the cave.</p><p>Immediately after, the others sensed something as well and followed suit.</p><p>As soon as they arrived outside the cave, they saw a streak of sword light approaching rapidly. It circled briefly above the island before descending in front of them. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>The elderly couple and the others breathed a sigh of relief, their faces showing joy.</p><p>“Senior, you're finally back! Was there really a Core Formation demon among those Flood Dragons?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Yes, at least mid-Core Formation.”</p><p>He hadn't expected to encounter such a surprise while hunting the last Flood Dragon.</p><p>After discovering the Flood Dragon migration trail, they immediately tracked it for more than ten days. Confirming that it was only a group of Nascent Soul Flood Dragons, Qin Sang decided to strike.</p><p>But for some reason, he had a persistent sense of unease before he made his move.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the elderly couple and the others to stay away, then approached the Flood Dragons alone. Out of caution, he first sent out a Corpse Puppet to test the waters.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a Core Formation demon was hidden within the group of Flood Dragons. It instantly killed the Corpse Puppet and charged towards his hiding place. Judging by its aura, it was at least a mid-Core Formation Flood Dragon.</p><p>Upon discovering this Flood Dragon, Qin Sang instantly realized he had been tricked.</p><p>It seemed his feeling after the first Flood Dragon hunt was correct; that Flood Dragon's identity wasn't simple.</p><p>But Qin Sang hadn't anticipated that these beasts would actually know how to lure and ambush. This Core Formation Flood Dragon likely possessed some level of sentience.</p><p>In the depths of the Demonic Sea, even when facing early-Core Formation demonic beasts, Qin Sang would observe before deciding whether to attack, let alone a mid-Core Formation Flood Dragon.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to turn and flee, alerting the elderly couple and the others to immediately distance themselves.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was cautious enough. His true body was hidden far away, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, which had already devoured eight Flood Dragon souls, combined with his Sword Qi and Thunder Sound, gave him astonishing speed.</p><p>After some twists and turns, amidst the Flood Dragon's furious roars, he successfully shook it off.</p><p>“We can't stay in this area any longer. Do you know of any other places where Flood Dragons appear?”</p><p>Being targeted by that Flood Dragon, continuing to hunt Flood Dragons nearby was too risky. He decided to change direction.  Demonic beasts in the Demonic Sea also had their territories. Qin Sang wasn't overly panicked, but the near-fatal ambush left him shaken and unwilling to underestimate them again.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's composure after being chased by a Core Formation demon, the elderly couple and the others were secretly impressed and gradually calmed down.</p><p>The old man pondered for a moment, then said, “Besides the trench, the most suitable place is west of Capital Rock Island. There's an area where a type of fish demon called the Floating Whisker is common. Flood Dragons seem to enjoy eating them, so they can sometimes be seen there. However, Core Formation demonic beasts occasionally appear around the Floating Whisker area, so only Core Formation cultivators dare to hunt there.”</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang looked around at everyone and asked, “When do you plan to return to Capital Rock Island?”</p><p>The five were taken aback. “What do you mean, Senior?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. “I've decided to go to the Floating Whisker area and find a cave there to cultivate for a few years. If you're not in a hurry to return, I intend to continue employing you to search for demonic beasts. However, this time I need you to find the lairs of Core Formation demons. My cultivation technique is special, so I have no choice. Of course, you won't need to participate in the hunts.”</p><p>The Radiant Universe Merchant Guild wasn't solely reliant on him as a Refiner. They only reserved the most essential spiritual materials for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's agreement with the Radiant Universe Merchant Guild allowed him to return every few years, so it wouldn't interfere with his own cultivation.  Hearing the old man mention the Floating Whisker area with its numerous Core Formation demonic beasts, he realized it was a perfect place for him to comprehend his Killing Talismans.</p><p>Since he had brought plenty of pills and other supplies, he decided not to return to Capital Rock Island for now.</p><p>But demonic beasts wouldn't come to him on their own, and searching alone was inefficient and time-consuming.</p><p>These people were easy to work with, and although their cultivation was low, they were sufficient for locating demonic beast lairs.</p><p>The five looked at each other. They had gained so many benefits following Qin Sang and already understood his character. Naturally, they were more than willing.</p><p>But for these False Core cultivators, the Floating Whisker area was too dangerous, so they hesitated.</p><p>“Following me, you certainly won't be treated unfairly. As long as you diligently work for me, I can refine magical artifacts for you for free, no worse than that bone sword and bone spear.”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was enticing. He then looked at the elderly couple. “You two have reached the limit with the Demonic Slayer Pills, but other spiritual medicines can still be used. Accumulate more resources, and perhaps you'll encounter the opportunity for Core Formation in the future. Or are you truly willing to give up?”</p><p>These words struck a chord.</p><p>The elderly couple looked at each other, then gritted their teeth. “We are willing to be at your command, Daoist.”</p><p>They then turned to the other three. “Fellow Daoists, unlike us, you haven't taken many Demonic Slayer Pills and still have hope. Whatever you decide, we won't mind. If we part ways here, let us never forget the camaraderie of these years hunting together.”</p><p>The grey-robed man agreed without hesitation, as Qin Sang had promised him a bone sword.</p><p>The Wang sisters smiled wryly. “When we first arrived, we knew nothing. It was all thanks to your guidance, Seniors, that we are where we are today. How could we abandon you now? Besides, the opportunity the Daoist has given us is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. If we miss it, we'll definitely regret it later.”</p><p>All five agreed to Qin Sang's terms.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily and immediately led them out of the cave, flying directly west.</p><p>Two months later, they arrived at the Floating Whisker area. After another ten days, they found a deserted island concealing a spiritual vein and excavated several caves near it.</p><p>“Finally on the right track.”</p><p>Looking at the simple caves, Qin Sang felt a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Since forming his Core, he hadn't had a fixed residence and couldn't cultivate peacefully. Now, he had finally found a suitable place.</p><p>“You five will take turns guarding the island. The other four will leave the island in pairs, focusing on finding Flood Dragons for now. If you discover a demonic beast lair, don't act rashly. Wait for me to personally confirm the demonic beast's cultivation level.”</p>
