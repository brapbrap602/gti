<h1>Chapter 2147: Spirit Treasure Tribulation</h1><p>His natal spirit sword stirred!</p><p>Could the Cloudsoar Sword be about to transform?</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat caught off guard, but not entirely surprised.</p><p>Back in the Talisman World, the Cloudsoar Sword had been blessed by Ziwei Tongzi, receiving great benefits. It had been nurtured within his Nascent Soul, lying dormant until now.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had helped Luohua Temple refine a Postnatal Spirit Treasure.  He'd had the fortune to observe that treasure's attempted transformation. Though it ultimately failed, it had drawn the aura of a Heavenly Tribulation.  Luo Hua Zhenren's assessment had been "insufficient foundation."</p><p>Qin Sang silently compared the Cloudsoar Sword to Luohua Temple's treasure, feeling that his sword was not inferior. He had been closely monitoring the changes in the Five Elements Crown and the Cloudsoar Sword. Even if he elevated them to the peak of Spirit Treasures, there was no guarantee of a successful transformation.  This step contained too much profound mystery, akin to the work of creation.  Stagnation for thousands, tens of thousands of years, or even permanently, was not uncommon.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had prematurely birthed a Tool Spirit, and Qin Sang had initially thought it would be the first to advance.  Unexpectedly, the Cloudsoar Sword was taking this step first. It must have received tremendous benefits from Ziwei Tongzi.</p><p>The transformation of a Spirit Treasure into a Postnatal Spirit Treasure also carried tribulation. He could not undergo the tribulation in front of Shao Shi.</p><p>Especially with the Cloudsoar Sword, extreme caution was required.</p><p>The Cloudsoar Sword trembled within his Nascent Soul. Qin Sang sensed a hint of urgency. Fortunately, these were only precursory signs of transformation. The advancement wouldn't begin immediately; he still had time to prepare.</p><p>Suppressing the ripples in his heart, Qin Sang maintained a calm expression and addressed Shao Shi, "This humble Daoist understands the Imperial Lord's intentions. Since cooperation benefits both of us, I have no reason to refuse. However, I must first see the Mirage Pearl before making a decision."</p><p>Unaware of the changes within Qin Sang, Shao Shi rejoiced, "As it should be! This old man will return at once and report this good news to the Imperial Lord.  We shall choose a day to deliver the Mirage Pearl for your inspection, True Master, to verify its authenticity. At that time, I hope you will activate the Thunder Altar and seal that Thunder Talisman within the Mirage Pearl…"</p><p>"This matter cannot be rushed."</p><p>Qin Sang fabricated an excuse. "The Thunder Altar consumes a great deal of energy, and activating it is no simple task.  This humble Daoist also needs to make preparations in advance. How about this: we agree on a time.  I will make the necessary arrangements, and Fellow Daoist Si will bring the Mirage Pearl. If all goes smoothly, we will activate the altar immediately. How does that sound?"</p><p>He had to prioritize the Cloudsoar Sword. All other matters had to be set aside.</p><p>Although Shao Shi wanted to obtain the Mirage Ship as quickly as possible, he was helpless upon hearing this and could only urge Qin Sang to hasten his preparations.</p><p>Having received a definite answer, Shao Shi had no intention of staying any longer.  He bid farewell and departed that very night.</p><p>Shortly after Shao Shi left, Qin Sang informed Su Nu and departed Qingyang Prefecture with Zhu Que.  Traveling with lightning speed, they arrived at the Zhu Yan Tribe's territory, intending to move on to another tribe.</p><p>The Elder Token that the Zhu Yan Tribe had given him hadn't been reclaimed.  Holding this token, he was a bona fide Elder and could freely use the tribe's Transportation Formation. Clan Leader Yuan Xiang's generosity stemmed from his desire to facilitate travel between Qin Sang and Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Not encountering Clan Leader Yuan Xiang or Yuan Miao within the tribe's territory spared him the need for explanations.  Qin Sang randomly chose a tribe near the River of Calamity and transported himself there, then quietly flew towards the river.</p><p>The River of Calamity was not only the edge of the Sea of Mists but also the end of the Eastern Sea.  Like the Storm Realm's Abyss of Return, it lay across the easternmost edge of the sea, stretching endlessly north and south. No one knew how wide the River of Calamity was, nor what lay on its other side.</p><p>The River of Calamity was not an ordinary river.  It was said that only a portion of the true river manifested in the world.  The River of Calamity was not exclusive to the Eastern Sea. The true river was hidden within an unknown void.</p><p>There were places in the Eastern Sea unaffected by the River of Calamity, free from danger, where one could easily reach the other side. But no one knew where these places were.</p><p>Long ago, Qin Sang had envisioned the scene of the Cloudsoar Sword's tribulation.</p><p>The Cloudsoar Sword was connected to the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, a legacy coveted by all who aspired to inherit Ziwei Sword Sovereign's mantle.  The First Sword Attendant had claimed that Ziwei Sword Sovereign had enemies throughout the world and had advised him to avoid using his natal spirit sword whenever possible, even going so far as to suggest invoking the Thunder Ancestor for concealment.</p><p>During the transformation, when the Heavenly Tribulation descended, the spirit sword would have to emerge and face the tribulation's might. This was the moment of greatest vulnerability, the time when exposure was most likely. It was best to be far from powerful cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, powerful cultivators were unpredictable; avoiding them wasn't always possible.</p><p>Upon discovering the River of Calamity within the Sea of Mists, Qin Sang immediately recognized it as an ideal location for the Cloudsoar Sword's tribulation.</p><p>Within the River of Calamity, where pure and turbid Qi were undifferentiated, chaos reigned supreme.  This could mask the Cloudsoar Sword's energy fluctuations. Even the First Sword Attendant couldn't withstand the River of Calamity's scouring. Compared to other locations, this was the most likely place to evade powerful cultivators.  As a precaution, it was best not to undergo the tribulation near a cultivation sanctuary, hence Qin Sang's journey here.</p><p>Qin Sang had done his best.  If misfortune still befell him, he would have to accept his fate. Undergoing the tribulation in the River of Calamity carried various disadvantages, but Qin Sang would find ways to mitigate them. As long as he didn't venture into the deepest parts of the river, where the Heavenly Dao was utterly chaotic, he shouldn't trigger any unusual tribulation transformations.</p><p>While contemplating these matters, Qin Sang sensed the Cloudsoar Sword within his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Within the spirit sword, the Spirit Embryo exhibited unprecedented activity, emitting strange fluctuations as if a consciousness within was about to awaken, emerging from its cocoon!</p><p>Thanks to the Thunder Ancestor's presence, Qin Sang didn't need to actively conceal these fluctuations.</p><p>Focusing his senses for a long time, Qin Sang had a growing feeling that the Spirit Embryo's pulsations were intensifying. The more pronounced the activity, the greater the hope of transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced inwardly, anticipating the kind of Sword Spirit the Cloudsoar Sword would give birth to, wondering if Yun Youzi would awaken.</p><p>Furthermore, obtaining a Postnatal Spirit Treasure before venturing to the Sacred Ground provided him with another powerful means of protection.</p><p>The Sacred Ground was the sanctuary of the Otherfolk's powerful cultivators. Using the Cloudsoar Sword there could lead to detection. But in a life-or-death situation, such concerns would become secondary. Survival would take precedence.</p><p>"We've arrived…"</p><p>Sensing the aura of the River of Calamity, Qin Sang halted his flight and opened his eyes, beholding the familiar sight.</p><p>Silently activating the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang plunged into the River of Calamity without hesitation, flying towards its depths.  However, deeper wasn't necessarily better.  He also needed to be wary of the powerful beasts that dwelled within.</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the River of Calamity in the Sea of Mists had a greyish-white turbid Qi due to the infusion of mist.  As he ventured deeper, the turbid Qi grew darker, confirming his earlier conjecture.</p><p>After several months of meticulous searching, Qin Sang, with unwavering patience, finally found a suitable location. He carefully patrolled the surrounding area, confirming the absence of any beast lairs before finally settling. Nascent Soul stage beasts couldn't completely conceal their auras, and their minds were already muddled, so they wouldn't bother to hide their presence.</p><p>The location Qin Sang chose had no land.  Surrounded by darkness, monstrous waves raged, creating a terrifying spectacle.</p><p>He released Zhu Que, instructing it to patrol and stand guard. He then summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and Min Zhuo to keep watch nearby.  Hovering in midair, he activated the Myriad钧 Ring, sending out formation tools to establish a defensive formation.</p><p>'Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…'</p><p>A cold wave swept across the area, freezing the towering waves into icicles.  The ice rapidly spread, quickly forming a platform of black ice beneath Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Empowered by the spirit formation, the platform remained stable, unaffected by the surrounding chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang added several more layers of restrictions, then gracefully descended onto the black ice and sat cross-legged.  Light flickered from his brow as a sword beam shot out.</p><p>The sword beam was luminous, radiating an extreme purity.  It circled above Qin Sang's head before the true form of the spirit sword manifested.  Its blade was light and flowing like water, pristine inside and out, inspiring reverence.</p><p>By now, the Cloudsoar Sword's transformation had progressed to a certain extent. Qin Sang could clearly sense the Spirit Embryo pulsating with a powerful vitality, filling him with confidence.</p><p>Perhaps, this was the manifestation of a sufficient foundation!</p><p>Qin Sang had preemptively activated the Thunder Altar.  With the Thunder Ancestor as its guardian deity, it could temporarily shield the consciousness within the Spirit Embryo from the River of Calamity's influence. The Cloudsoar Sword had devoured the Soul Nurturing Wood and had resided within his Nascent Soul for many years, undoubtedly imbued with the Jade Buddha's aura as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Thunder Ancestor's aura, radiating unreservedly, provided further cover for the Cloudsoar Sword.</p><p>Time slowly passed.  The black ice platform was engulfed by an endless chaotic storm.  Between heaven and sea, all was vast and hazy.  No one came to disturb them.</p><p>After more than ten days, the Spirit Embryo suddenly fell silent. Qin Sang sensed that the sliver of consciousness remained and wasn't alarmed. He waited patiently for a few days, and the fluctuations reappeared.</p><p>He inwardly sighed in relief and continued to observe the Spirit Embryo. He discovered that after this period of dormancy, it was as if a hurdle had been overcome.  The transformation accelerated, and the consciousness within the Spirit Embryo grew rapidly.</p><p>The transformation was faster than anticipated. On just the seventh day, Qin Sang abruptly awoke and looked up at the sky.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The heavens trembled.</p><p>Even in the darkness, he could see dark clouds gathering, imbued with the aura of heavenly might.  The Heavenly Tribulation was imminent!</p><p>A flash of joy crossed Qin Sang's eyes, quickly replaced by a solemn expression as he gazed at the Cloudsoar Sword.  This was his first time witnessing a Spirit Treasure's tribulation. He was mostly imitating Luo Hua Zhenren's preparations, readying himself for the impending tribulation.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>As the heavenly might manifested, the Cloudsoar Sword shot into the sky, erupting in a dazzling display of sword light. The trembling ceased, and a powerful wave emanated from the sword.</p><p>This wave originated from the Spirit Embryo's intense transformation.  There seemed to be a sense of urgency within, a joy for new life, and a fear of the heavenly might. The emotions Qin Sang sensed grew increasingly complex. This was a good sign, indicating that the sliver of consciousness was drawing closer to becoming a true being, on the verge of birthing sentience!</p><p>'Hum…'</p><p>The spirit sword began to tremble again, but this time, the trembling wasn't spontaneous. It was triggered by an external force.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed that the consciousness had finally broken through the last barrier. Although the Sword Spirit hadn't yet materialized, Qin Sang was absolutely certain: the Cloudsoar Sword had given birth to a Sword Spirit!</p><p>Simultaneously, he saw formless flames materialize in the void!</p><p>“Yin Fire Tribulation!  So Spirit Treasures also face the Three Disasters…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, gazing at the surrounding invisible flames.</p><p>He had brought along the tribulation formation he'd prepared for Zhu Que, and now it finally had a purpose.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>As the Yin Fire in the void intensified, Qin Sang sensed something else, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>He vaguely felt targeted by the heavenly might, not simply because he was close to the Cloudsoar Sword, but as if he and the sword were considered a single entity.</p><p>“I was able to assist the Heavenly Eye Butterfly with its tribulation.  The Cloudsoar Sword is my natal spirit sword. It seems I can directly intervene. Perhaps the Heavenly Eye Butterfly can also help. This is the advantage of a life-bound connection. Compared to other Spirit Treasures, it's an irreplaceable advantage!"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood the reason, feeling greatly reassured. He immediately activated the tribulation formation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Yin Fire multiplied, becoming omnipresent.</p><p>A boundless sea of fire surrounded them, flames flickering right beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the intensity of the Yin Fire, Qin Sang's expression changed, inwardly exclaiming at the strength of the tribulation!</p><p>He wasn't sure what factors influenced the strength of a Spirit Treasure's tribulation.  What he could confirm was that the aura emanating from these Yin Flames far surpassed the Heavenly Tribulation he had faced when breaking through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Facing the overwhelming Yin Fire, Qin Sang felt a sense of trepidation.  His expression grew increasingly grave as he poured his True Essence into the Cloudsoar Sword without reservation, aiding it in overcoming the tribulation.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Yin Fire surged madly towards the Cloudsoar Sword.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Beams of red and blue light erupted from the black ice platform, converging in midair to form a multi-colored halo, like a luminous mist, enveloping the Cloudsoar Sword and shielding it from the Yin Fire.</p><p>This formation was created by Qin Sang, drawing upon his understanding of the Formless Immortal Sect's tribulation formations and his own experiences. It could weaken Void Refinement stage tribulations to a certain extent, but its effect here wasn't significant.</p><p>The Yin Fire Tribulation was too powerful; the tribulation formation was but a minor help.</p><p>Some of the Yin Fire was blocked by the halo, dissipating into nothingness, but most of it penetrated the halo, burning the sword's body.</p><p>The Cloudsoar Sword had devoured three of the Ten Great Divine Woods: the Soul Nurturing Wood, the Boundless Blood Mulberry, and the Diamond Fruit. It also incorporated the soul essence birthed by the Pure Fortune Bamboo, a combination rarely seen in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Regarding the Ten Great Divine Woods, there was a popular theory. Because of their unique powers, these spirit woods had once shone brightly in the Great Thousand World, becoming renowned throughout the cultivation world. That's how they came to be grouped together. Despite their rarity and fame, their individual quality wasn't necessarily superior to other top-tier spirit woods.</p><p>However, being listed among the Ten Great Divine Woods meant they were undoubtedly extraordinary. The Diamond Fruit was known as the wood of ultimate rigidity.  The Cloudsoar Sword had devoured two Diamond Fruits. Its blade's resilience was rarely matched among Spirit Treasures.</p><p>Enduring the endless burning of the Yin Fire, the Cloudsoar Sword's body appeared to melt as the Yin Fire ravaged its interior. Qin Sang's True Essence flowed like a flood through an open gate.</p><p>However, in Qin Sang's view, crisis also presented opportunity. Just as his physical body grew stronger with each tribulation he faced, the Cloudsoar Sword's light grew purer, as if impurities were being refined away.</p><p>Ultimately, the Yin Fire failed to incinerate the Cloudsoar Sword.  Weakening at last, the blazing inferno began to dissipate.</p><p>The Yin Wind Tribulation followed closely, arriving at the Sword Spirit's most vulnerable moment, a time of utmost vigilance.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang's heart eased slightly. Perhaps due to Ziwei Tongzi's blessing, the Sword Spirit wasn't as fragile as he had feared. It greedily absorbed the benefits of the Yin Wind Tribulation, growing rapidly.</p><p>The second disaster passed without major incident.</p><p>Now, dark clouds filled the sky, lightning flashed and thunder roared.  The lightning dispelled the darkness, carrying terrifying heavenly might.</p><p>From afar, the tribulation site would appear bathed in golden light.</p><p>"It's the same golden Heavenly Tribulation as the Yao Clan!  It seems that Tool Spirits are also considered akin to Yao by the Heavenly Dao…"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, watching the golden lightning, and called for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p>
