<h1></h1><p>Traveling between the rosy clouds and crimson flames.</p><p>An attack appeared every so often.</p><p>The spirit array conjured weapons were all different.</p><p>There were zen staffs, alms bowls, and also golden swords and golden sabers.</p><p>These weapons were imposing, but had the same weakness; Qin Sang only needed to dodge in time to easily avoid them.</p><p>He proceeded safely all the way.</p><p>Under the guidance of the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang advanced swiftly.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang did not relax, and with the help of the Celestial Eye Butterfly, focused all his attention on analyzing the spirit array.</p><p>He was well-versed in the classics of the Yuanxu Sect, and had some understanding of the art of array formations and restrictions.</p><p>Although this was a Buddhist array formation, some principles were universal.</p><p>However, he was inside the array, seeing only the tip of the iceberg, unaware of the whole picture. He couldn't think of a way to break the array in a short time and could only act in accordance with the array's operation.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang's understanding of the spirit array grew, and the time to break the array would come!</p><p>While advancing.</p><p>Qin Sang was increasingly amazed by the ingenuity of the spirit array.</p><p>Apart from places like the Ziwei Palace and the Seven Killings Hall, with immortal restrictions he couldn't understand, this spirit array was the most complex and magnificent he had encountered. The array's creator had attainments in the art of array formations that were beyond imagination.</p><p>He flew continuously for several hours, but still didn't reach the end.</p><p>Adding the time spent in the first layer of the spirit array.</p><p>At this time, it had been more than half a day since they entered the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>The area covered by the spirit array could definitely not be so large, which could only be explained by the array's creator using ingenious means to create a Daoist temple in a snail shell, trapping those who broke into the array in a corner of the world.</p><p>The Buddhist sect had such a great power, yet he was unknown, for some reason.</p><p>Along the way, the figures of Valley Master Mu and the Old Fiend Hunmo and others were not seen.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped thinking about it.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the frequency of attacks was increasing.</p><p>He braced himself, his speed increasing rather than decreasing.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>After flying not far, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, his pupils shrinking.</p><p>In front of him, a Buddha statue blocked the way.</p><p>Unlike the Thousand Buddha Wall, there was only one towering Buddha here, with twenty-four heads and eighteen arms, each holding Buddhist treasures such as golden swords, parasols, zen staffs, lotuses, and alms bowls.</p><p>The attacks Qin Sang had encountered along the way had all come from the Buddha statue.</p><p>The Buddha statue had not escaped unscathed, being contaminated by the crimson flames, with its whole body alternating between crimson and gold.</p><p>The weapons in the eighteen Buddha hands were condensed from the power of the spirit array. Golden light converged, gradually solidifying in front of Qin Sang, and launched attacks on Qin Sang after taking shape.</p><p>Qin Sang approached.</p><p>The Buddha statue glared furiously.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he hurriedly dodged sideways.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two kinds of weapons left the Buddha's hands and flew over together. Fortunately, Qin Sang was alert, otherwise he might have been injured.</p><p>The attacks became more and more frequent, each one more fierce than the last.</p><p>Qin Sang responded calmly, his eyes never leaving the Buddha statue, and suddenly his eyes lit up. He waved his sleeve, summoning the Demon Banner, and with the Phoenix Wings behind him flapping rapidly, he turned into a streak of azure light, rushing in front of the Buddha statue like lightning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Fire Dragon struck the Buddha statue's forehead squarely.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>With a deafening roar, the Buddha statue's movements suddenly froze, and then began to shatter from the forehead.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire Buddha statue collapsed, revealing a crimson-gold vortex.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed in without hesitation before the crimson flames erupted.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>With one entrance and one exit, the scenery changed again.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the completely different scene around him, and knew that he had entered the third transformation. He couldn't help but rub his forehead wearily, "If this continues, I don't know how many days it will take to find a flaw in the spirit array. If I delay any longer, more nascent souls will be attracted, and it will become more and more chaotic."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, rested briefly, summoned the Fire Jade Centipede, found the right direction, and set off again.</p><p>And so on.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang charged around in the spirit array, witnessing all kinds of Buddhist methods, and gaining a better understanding of Buddhism, which might be considered a blessing in disguise.</p><p>Unconsciously, Qin Sang had been here for almost five days.</p><p>These days.</p><p>Qin Sang was exhausted by the various changes in the spirit array, but actually encountered very few dangerous moments.</p><p>If there was no pressure from the Old Fiend Hunmo and others, the four of them could have broken the array calmly, only spending more time.</p><p>There was no distinction between day and night in the spirit array.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was actually on a road paved with gold bricks.</p><p>The gold brick road was built in the void, and it was not known where it extended.</p><p>He sat down in meditation.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet guarded him, responding to attacks that might appear at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang had just taken some medicinal pills and was refining them.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, full of energy, and his aura returned to its peak. A confident look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>After five days of relentless exploration, Qin Sang finally figured out most of the rules of the spirit array, enough to break the array.</p><p>Moreover, at this time he was very close to the core of the spirit array.</p><p>He lowered his head and looked at the gold brick road, Qin Sang stood up, flew forward for a while, and suddenly stopped, found the node of the spirit array, used the same trick again, and sacrificed the Nine Nether Demonic Flame.</p><p>The Demonic Flame floated in front of him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop moving, and took out a set of array instruments from the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>This was what he had refined when he left the Yuanxu Sect. The power was not very good, but it could be used as an auxiliary means.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed continuously, covering his body with the array instruments. His movements paused slightly, he looked down at the gold bricks, and pressed down with both hands.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The array instruments trembled, Xuanhuang light gathered, and turned into a stone spear, stabbing down fiercely.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Golden light shot in all directions.</p><p>The road broke in response.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Flame followed closely, rushing down fiercely.</p><p>In an instant, a dense crimson-gold light erupted, and the Demon Banner churned.</p><p>Qin Sang squinted his eyes. His vision was a chaotic mess, and he only felt that the power of the surrounding spirit array was extremely chaotic. Powerful fluctuations came from all around, and the spirit array began to counterattack.</p><p>His expression didn't change, and he suddenly fell down rapidly.</p><p>...</p><p>This was a purplish-red space.</p><p>The sky was full of flowing fire.</p><p>The flowing fire was purple, which was a manifestation of the extreme richness of the crimson flame aura.</p><p>Streaks of purple flowing fire roamed in the void, like flood dragons, emitting terrifying fluctuations. The higher up, the more flowing fire there was, and the sky could not be seen.</p><p>Below was a bare ground.</p><p>This area was not very large, not even as large as Hundred Flowers Valley, with only two mountain ranges intersecting, converging at the highest peak in the middle.</p><p>There were traces of rivers between the mountains, but they were all dry.</p><p>A pillar of fire spewed out from the top of the highest peak, with a steady stream of crimson flame aura gushing out, and then merging into and strengthening the purple flowing light.</p><p>On this land, one could see scattered golden lights.</p><p>There were golden roofs perched high on the mountain peaks.</p><p>There were pagodas shining with golden light.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang finally escaped from the spirit array, carefully avoiding the surrounding floating fire, and looked down at the strange scene below.</p><p>"Is this the Pure Sea Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He looked around, not seeing a single person. The Pure Sea Sect was in a dead silence, and the Buddhist disciples had long since disappeared.</p><p>In addition, he did not see the Old Fiend Hunmo, Valley Master Mu, and others.</p><p>It seemed that he was the first to enter here.</p>
