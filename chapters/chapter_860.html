<h1>Chapter 852: The Chase</h1><p>Qin Sang watched the Two-Headed Vulture depart, then abruptly stopped and turned, his gaze fixed coldly on his rapidly approaching pursuers.</p><p>He was still full of questions, unsure why they valued Su Nü so much.  He wasn't unfamiliar with demonic cultivators, his first sect after embarking on the path of immortality being a demonic one.</p><p>Contemporary demonic cultivators didn't place much importance on True Demonic Qi.  Not only was it incredibly rare, but even if found, it couldn't be absorbed or utilized. Instead, it was more likely to backfire, endangering one's life.</p><p>Precisely because of this, the unusual attitude of these two towards True Demonic Qi and Su Nü made Qin Sang suspicious. The connection between the two trading alliances and True Demonic Qi seemed even closer than he'd imagined.</p><p>What secrets were hidden within?</p><p>Furthermore, Su Nü had been docile and obedient during their escape from the Demonic Island, seemingly not a spoiled person.  Yet, her inability to tolerate even a few disrespectful glances also raised Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>He wondered if it was her true nature or a deliberate act.  If deliberate, Su Nü's purpose and her relationship with Yue Xiangu became quite intriguing.</p><p>Of course, these were merely suspicions.  Qin Sang hadn't known Su Nü long, barely exchanging a few words. He didn't understand her character; perhaps being overly sheltered by Yue Xiangu had spoiled her.</p><p>Qin Sang's mission was to protect Su Nü, not to get involved in unrelated conflicts.  These thoughts flashed through his mind, but he had no intention of delving deeper.</p><p>"I have no desire to be enemies with the three of you. Why are you being so aggressive?"</p><p>Qin Sang blocked their path, his voice loud and questioning.</p><p>"We simply wish to discuss cultivation practices with the young lady, but fellow Daoist is acting like a startled bird. You misunderstand us! The Demonic Sea is now the domain of demonic beasts. If we cultivators don't unite, how many days can we survive?"</p><p>The Bearded Scholar pleaded earnestly.</p><p>His eyes, however, concealed a murderous intent, especially after seeing the Two-Headed Vulture. He immediately transmitted his voice to the Stout Merchant, "Junior Brother, this person also has a Core Formation stage demonic beast. No wonder he can travel freely in the Demonic Sea. This person is not simple; killing him won't be easy. We might have to pay a hefty price. Let him go for now. Our priority is to capture that girl, alive..."</p><p>The three communicated through voice transmission, quickly formulating a plan.</p><p>The Bearded Scholar took out a talisman, secretly activating it while his true body vanished into thin air. Simultaneously, the talisman manifested an illusory image of him, realistic enough to fool the eye.</p><p>The other two maintained their composure, guarding the illusion as they aggressively charged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The Bearded Scholar's true body, meanwhile, slipped into the shadows, changing direction to bypass Qin Sang.</p><p>Wary, Qin Sang had already awakened the Skyeye Butterfly and activated his Skyeye, scanning the surroundings. He easily saw through the Bearded Scholar's illusion and located his true body.</p><p>He remained impassive, taking the initiative to attack with his flying sword, feigning ignorance.</p><p>As he neared the Bearded Scholar's true body, his sword light suddenly shifted.</p><p>In an instant, a cascade of sword light, like a reversed Milky Way, accompanied by booming thunder, filled the air, awe-inspiring and terrifying. It was as if a forest of swords erupted from Qin Sang's hand, descending upon the Bearded Scholar in the shadows.</p><p>Startled and momentarily stunned by the astonishing swordsmanship, the Bearded Scholar abandoned his concealment and hastily activated his natal magic treasure.</p><p>A crystal square seal shot out from his dantian, shimmering with silver light. Runes on its top transformed, ultimately forming a silver character, 'Suppress'.</p><p>The sword light collided with the square seal.</p><p>The large 'Suppress' character flew out from the seal, spinning rapidly, dispersing the sword light along its path.  Simultaneously, the character itself began to dissipate, and the silver light on the square seal fluctuated, bearing immense pressure.</p><p>"Such powerful swordsmanship!"</p><p>Forced out of the shadows, the Bearded Scholar's expression turned serious as he stared at Qin Sang. "I truly underestimated you.  Your strength is rare even among the three major trading alliances, yet I've never heard of you."</p><p>"This humble Daoist is but a mere rogue cultivator, not worth mentioning."</p><p>Qin Sang replied, but his hand didn't relent.  The Ebony Wood Sword moved unpredictably, employing the sword techniques he had comprehended in the Sword Path, forcefully shattering the silver character.</p><p>Sword light cascaded down, unstoppable.</p><p>However, before the Ebony Wood Sword could reach him, the square seal flew back, condensing a new silver character. The Bearded Scholar, holding his magic treasure, retreated rapidly.</p><p>Just then, the other two arrived.</p><p>Seeing the situation, they immediately intervened, not to help the Bearded Scholar defend against the flying sword, but to attack Qin Sang directly with their magic treasures, forcing him to defend.</p><p>Blade and spear arrived simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly sighed, realizing his opportunity was lost.</p><p>While feigning ignorance and planning a sneak attack, he had secretly prepared the Blood Defilement Divine Light and the Star Conch, waiting for the Bearded Scholar to reveal a weakness, to kill him first, and then deal with the other two.</p><p>However, the Bearded Scholar was, after all, a late Core Formation expert.  Though caught off guard, he hadn't lost his composure.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't find a suitable opportunity to strike before the other two caught up.  Facing three opponents of such strength, he had to abandon the idea of a quick victory and engage in a protracted battle.</p><p>As the magic treasures approached, Qin Sang's figure flickered repeatedly. At the same time, the demonic banner beside him spun, forming a formation. A wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Fire was drawn into his palm, counterattacking the magic treasures.</p><p>Fighting one against three, Qin Sang knew this couldn't last.  Once the Bearded Scholar recovered, the three could form a formation and suppress him. Moreover, his True Essence was depleting rapidly; the spirit pills he had consumed earlier were merely a drop in the bucket.</p><p>Therefore, after a brief exchange, Qin Sang deliberately revealed a flaw.</p><p>The Bearded Scholar, freed from the entanglement and eager to capture Su Nü, instructed his companions to hold Qin Sang while he pursued the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>Qin Sang seemingly ignored this, recalling the Ebony Wood Sword.  Seizing the opportunity, he unleashed the Blood Defilement Divine Light, striking the Stout Merchant's natal magic treasure directly.</p><p>"Senior Brother, save me!"</p><p>With the Ebony Wood Sword and Nine Nether Demonic Fire arriving simultaneously, the Stout Merchant, having lost his magic treasure, was defenseless and terrified.</p><p>The Liu surname cultivator rushed to his aid, but could only block the demonic fire.</p><p>Witnessing this, the Bearded Scholar's eyes widened in fury and he hastily turned back to rescue his companion, but the sword light had already engulfed the Stout Merchant.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A silver character dispersed the sword energy.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, looking at the bloodied Stout Merchant with some regret.  The man had used some unknown means at the last moment to preserve his life.</p><p>However, he was also gravely injured, sword energy penetrating his body, rendering him combat-ineffective for the time being.</p><p>The Blood Defilement Divine Light, worthy of its origin from the Ten Great Divine Trees, had once again helped Qin Sang secure an advantage.</p><p>The Bearded Scholar was also taken aback, holding his gravely injured junior brother, incredulous. He had thought his junior brothers, even if they couldn't win, could at least hold their opponent.  Unexpectedly, they were defeated so quickly and so miserably!</p><p>What kind of divine ability was that streak of blood light?</p><p>"If you dare to entangle me again, this will be your fate!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, pointing at the Stout Merchant, then departed on his flying sword.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>The Bearded Scholar, consumed by rage yet remarkably calm, declared, "That demonic cultivator is merely at mid-Core Formation.  Fighting the three of us continuously, deploying numerous magic treasures, his True Essence must be nearly depleted!  It's just a bluff, don't be fooled!"</p><p>He instructed his junior brother to refine the sword energy within his body himself, then took the Liu surname cultivator and pursued Qin Sang.</p>
