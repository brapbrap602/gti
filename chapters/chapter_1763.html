<h1>Chapter 1754: The Ghost Fang Kingdom</h1><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>On an unnamed riverbank, Qin Sang, having confirmed the absence of any river gods or local deities, flung two demons onto the ground.  The snake demon lay unconscious.</p><p>The wolf demon, rolling over, still showed shock and confusion in its eyes. It had waited a long time for orders, only to have Qin Sang suddenly capture the snake demon.  The unpredictability of it all increased its fear of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang then glanced at the wolf demon.</p><p>The wolf demon, without needing any command, understood the look.  It conjured a gust of demonic wind, drawing up river water and pouring it over the snake demon's head.</p><p>The snake demon slowly awoke, shaking its head, still groggy.</p><p>Because the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was inherently fragile, Qin Sang tried to avoid exposing it to direct enemy confrontation. It rarely had a chance to fight alone.  However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation had reached the peak of the late Fourth Transformation stage, just a step away from the Fifth Transformation, and its supernatural powers were quite potent.</p><p>Because Qin Sang had instructed them to spare the snake demon's life and ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to constantly conceal its ability to absorb tribulation thunder, the thunderbolt that struck the snake demon didn't utilize the power of tribulation thunder.</p><p>Even so, the snake demon nearly perished under the thunderbolt.</p><p>As consciousness returned, the snake demon recalled the events.  Looking up, it saw Qin Sang standing on the bank, and was immediately terrified.  Before it could speak, the wolf demon cleverly approached and whispered to it.</p><p>After listening, the snake demon's eyes reddened with rage. It spat at the wolf demon, and the look in its eyes showed that, were Qin Sang not present, it would have gladly devoured the wolf demon.</p><p>The wolf demon endured the spitting without retaliation, sneering at the snake demon.</p><p>After the snake demon calmed down, its expression flickered before it finally sighed and chose to submit.  It slithered to Qin Sang's feet and prostrated itself.  "Little demon pays respects to the Immortal. Whatever treasure the Immortal desires, the little demon will gladly offer, only begging for the Immortal's mercy and to spare its life."</p><p>Qin Sang, withdrawing its gaze from the distance, looked down and said, "Show me your demonic essence."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The snake demon was startled.  This person must be a Daoist master. Daoist techniques are unparalleled in the world. Would a mere demonic essence even catch the eye of a master, to warrant such effort?</p><p>It instinctively glanced at the wolf demon, but receiving no guidance, it dared not hesitate. Taking a deep breath, a phantom appeared behind it.</p><p>The phantom was a giant serpent, nearly a hundred meters long, coiling on the ground like a small mountain.  The serpent's appearance was identical to the snake demon, the scales the same color, only the size was vastly different.</p><p>Seeing the phantom, Qin Sang initially thought it was the snake demon's Dharma image, but a closer look revealed it to be entirely different from its own Azure Luan Dharma image.</p><p>The serpent phantom seemed to be condensed from the snake demon's blood and qi, vibrant and lifelike, far from stiff.</p><p>"This is the demonic essence?"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the serpent phantom with curious eyes.  It was indeed vastly different from human cultivation techniques and altars.</p><p>The snake demon obediently nodded. "This is my inner truth, cultivated through the technique of meditative cultivation."</p><p>Meditative cultivation…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Meditative cultivation techniques must share common ground with Daoist methods, but Daoists cultivate guardian deities, while the snake demon cultivated a near-identical serpent phantom, the qi of which was indistinguishable from its own.</p><p>External deity, internal truth!</p><p>Could this be the difference between Daoist techniques and demonic essences?</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully and asked about the function of the essence.</p><p>The snake demon dared not, nor needed to, hide anything. The most important function of demonic essence was only one: cultivating inner truth, also called inner deity, to protect one's mind and spirit from the disruptive influences of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>The biggest difference from cultivation techniques was that demonic essence didn't stabilize vital energy, and demonic cultivators usually cultivated physical strength, which made such disruptive energy beneficial.</p><p>Physical strength, then, was this world's demonic cultivators' interpretation of body refinement, which was quite apt.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and asked, "Where did you obtain this demonic essence?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The snake demon hesitated.  "When my spirit was still dim, I accidentally stumbled into a cave, the cave dwelling of a powerful figure from my snake spirit clan, where I obtained a chance encounter…"</p><p>The snake demon then recounted its past experiences in detail. That day it had wandered around and entered a cave, drawn in by an unseen force, entering a stone chamber deep within the cave.  Suddenly, a ray of light shot into its forehead, instantly opening its spiritual awareness, and cultivation techniques appeared in its mind, after which it started its cultivation in a hazy state.</p><p>When the snake demon broke through to the transformation stage, it gradually noticed something strange. The protective effect of the inner deity on its mind and spirit seemed to weaken.</p><p>Because it hadn't yet mastered the ancestral techniques, it wasn't certain. After further cultivation, it finally confirmed this.</p><p>Then the snake demon remembered something: a predecessor had left a relic in a stone cave, saying that if a descendant achieved the transformation stage, they could take the relic to Guifang, a country in the Shuangshan region, to find it.</p><p>As the snake demon had cultivated in seclusion, unaware of worldly affairs, it only learned after inquiring that Guifang was a kingdom of demons and ghosts opposing the Daoist Court.</p><p>Shuangshan refers to Jushan Prefecture and Gangshan Prefecture.</p><p>Legend says the Daoist Court originally controlled four prefectures; for unknown reasons, it lost Shuangshan, which was seized by demons and ghosts, establishing Guifang to rival the Court.</p><p>The predecessor hadn't described the demon-ghost kingdom in detail, and the snake demon dared not provoke Daoist officials, so it was unclear about the situation in Shuangshan. It was said that the Daoist Court and the demon-ghost kingdom were constantly at odds.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang interrupted the snake demon and turned to the hyena demon.</p><p>The hyena demon should know more.</p><p>The hyena demon had once followed a Daoist master; though it didn't have access to true secrets, it had heard some things.</p><p>The Daoist Court also spoke of two Shuangshan prefectures: Zhongmao Prefecture, Baishi Prefecture, Jushan Prefecture, and Gangshan Prefecture.</p><p>Zhongmao and Baishi were governed by the Tianshu Academy and the Beiji Exorcism Academy respectively.</p><p>Gangshan Prefecture was truly occupied by Guifang, while Jushan Prefecture, located between the Daoist Court and Guifang, was the most chaotic, a constant battleground.</p><p>The hyena demon's former master had returned from Jushan Prefecture shortly before subduing it.</p><p>The master's soldiers often boasted of their battlefield achievements, leading the hyena demon to believe them to be traitors, causing great disdain.</p><p>The constant attacks between the Daoist Court and Guifang showed the legends held some truth.</p><p>Going to Guifang was no easy task.</p><p>The snake demon naturally wouldn't dare cross Daoist territory, and skirting the edges was also unsafe. Daoist cultivators called the wasteland outside the Court's territory the "孽原" (Nieyuan) and "孽海" (Niehai).</p><p>Cultivating there, the snake demon knew the Nieyuan and Niehai were fraught with danger; it feared it might die before reaching Guifang.</p><p>It had cultivated for many years, diligently refining nine snake sloughs whenever it had free time, its other abilities being mediocre.  Unfortunately, even the carefully refined sloughs couldn't save it from being captured by Qin Sang.</p><p>Having learned the situation, Qin Sang ordered the snake demon to take him to the cave.</p><p>The one and two demons returned the same way.</p><p>The cave was located among the snake demon's nine caves. After the heritage was taken, nothing special remained, so the Tianmu butterfly hadn't paid it much attention.</p><p>'Drip… drip…’</p><p>The cave was quiet, the dripping water clearly audible.</p><p>The snake demon shrank, becoming a seven-foot-long slender scaled snake, slithering across thick stone pillars, then diving into an underground river.  After a short distance, it found the cave entrance.</p><p>The snake demon turned its head, "Immortal, this is the place."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, discovering a very narrow cave with a round stone pool in the center. The water was incredibly clear. Beside the pool sat a flat black stone—the only furnishing in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang released his spiritual sense and had the Tianmu butterfly investigate, finding no hidden restrictions.</p><p>The snake demon couldn't remember how many times it had searched the place, staying nearby due to concern that its snake ancestor might return.</p><p>"You murdered the Daoist Court's sub-altar master, believing a connection existed between Daoist and demon cultivation techniques?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked directly into the snake demon's eyes, suddenly asking.</p><p>The snake demon was startled and terrified, nodding with difficulty.</p><p>The path to Guifang was impassable. After deliberation, the snake demon decided to wait until it reached a higher level before going, for increased safety.</p><p>Meanwhile, it actively sought self-preservation, noticing similarities between Daoist and demon techniques, potentially bridging the gap to resolve future problems.</p><p>It had secretly captured several low-level cultivators, but with little success.</p><p>Without personal experience, just from the descriptions of the two demons, Qin Sang felt a clear connection between Daoist and demon techniques, likely a divergence due to differences in cultivation, leading to different manifestations.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang summoned the hyena demon and ordered the snake demon to teach it its techniques, personally observing the process.</p><p>The hyena demon was overjoyed.</p><p>Although it had to become dependent again, it could finally cultivate further.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the snake demon sighed, avoiding the hyena demon's gaze, shaking its head. "I don't know how to teach others.  Since gaining sentience, I have been self-taught…"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet responded.</p><p>The hyena demon was wide-eyed, gnashing its teeth at the snake demon, but dared not act up in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the two demons with a wave of his hand, then sat cross-legged on the black stone, lost in thought.</p><p>Having captured two demons, he had gained a certain understanding of the cultivation methods of both the Daoist sect and the demon race.  In both the Daoist court and the Demon Kingdom, it seemed that the transmission of cultivation techniques was controlled by powerful factions.  The internal strictness of these factions and the high degree of control exerted by high-level cultivators over low-level ones was unimaginable. In the Storm World, even offending a large sect still allowed one to become a wandering cultivator, hiding in remote areas to cultivate in seclusion.  But in this world, offending the Daoist court would make it impossible to move freely.</p><p>The senior Snake Clan member was from Guifang, and the demonic arts she passed on to the snake demon were considered orthodox.  Since these arts did not have the ability to stabilize primordial energy, it meant that using chaotic energy for body refinement should not have any other adverse effects.  Thus, he could safely cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, continuing to refine his physical body and seek a breakthrough.</p><p>However, this was not a long-term solution; he would inevitably have to return to the path of Daoist cultivation.</p><p>"Jushan..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked slightly upwards, gazing towards the east, his expression slightly serious.  It was difficult to find a way out within the Daoist court, but the more chaotic a place, the easier it was to act!</p><p>The clash between the Demon Kingdom and the Daoist court, the collision of demonic and Daoist arts, piqued Qin Sang's curiosity.  With this in mind, Qin Sang had a clear plan for his next move: he would not rush to contact the Daoist court, but instead travel east to Jushan first!</p><p>However, there was one thing he had to consider.  The Daoist court and the Demon Kingdom had been engaged in warfare for many years—it wasn't just a petty squabble.  Strong cultivators, possibly at the Nascent Soul stage or above, might be present on the battlefield.  His current strength was considerable, but not necessarily safe.</p><p>Every time he broke through a major realm in the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, he needed to draw stellar energy into his body.  Chaotic energy and the Dragon Pool elixir alone were insufficient. He had no clear direction yet.  However, before that, he could first open spiritual apertures for the Dao Tree, integrate it into his body, and forge a spirit wood body.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang left the stone cave and returned to the cavern, discovering that the two demons were fighting amongst themselves.  The wolf demon was biting the snake demon's vital point, while the snake demon had its neck tightly constricted. Both were covered in mud, looking disheveled.  Afraid of disturbing Qin Sang, these two former demon kings had reverted to their bestial nature, carefully engaging in a scuffle, without even breaking a single stone pillar.  The snake demon was forced to disperse several demonic rays, suffering a significant loss of cultivation, yet still managed to fight the wolf demon to a standstill.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang approach, the two demons froze, reluctantly stopping their fight and respectfully standing on either side of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang did not comment on their behavior.  "I plan to travel to Jushan soon. Would you two be willing to accompany me?"</p><p>The two demons nodded in unison.</p><p>They thought to themselves that even a word of refusal would likely be their death sentence.</p><p>Qin Sang understood their thoughts perfectly and smiled slightly.  "I am not a cruel person, nor do I wish to raise an army. If you faithfully execute my orders, regaining your freedom will not be difficult; you can directly join the Guifang Kingdom then, and I will not interfere. If you accomplish great feats, I will have other rewards."</p><p>The two demons exchanged glances, greatly moved.  They did not dare to hope for any great rewards; being able to join the Guifang Kingdom was extremely attractive to them.  Whether Qin Sang would keep his promise, they couldn't be sure, but their situation couldn't be worse than it currently was.</p><p>"We are willing to follow the Immortal!"</p><p>The two demons bowed together, their tone now containing a bit more sincerity.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Jushan was the battlefield of the two major forces, and the two demons might become good assistants to him.</p><p>Before long, one man and two demons arrived at the most luxurious of the nine suspected residences of the snake demon.</p><p>"Guard this place."</p><p>Qin Sang left them with this instruction and entered the residence to cultivate.</p><p>One snake and one wolf guarded the cave entrance, their eyes meeting, and anger rising again.</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>The cave entrance opened from within, and Qin Sang stepped out with a smile.  Although he knew that using the Dao Tree as a medium to cultivate the *Post-Heaven Wooden Man Stele* would be easier, he had not expected to complete the opening of all the spiritual apertures and integrate them into his body in just two years.  The strange-faced man had spent over twenty years opening the spiritual apertures on the Chixuan Ancient Tree. Moreover, the strange-faced man had spent a long time beforehand refining his own apertures. The more thorough the preparation, the greater the chance of success.  Even so, integrating the Chixuan Ancient Tree into his body was extremely difficult, almost resulting in failure.  Qin Sang had only begun refining his apertures two years earlier, and he had simply made a casual attempt, yet it had proceeded smoothly and effortlessly.  Qin Sang had not expected it to be so easy and was greatly surprised.  This was undoubtedly the merit of the Dao Tree, saving him a great deal of time.</p><p>Completing this step was equivalent to initially forging a spirit wood body, but to use it in battle, he would need to nourish it within his body for some time.  With the improvement of his cultivation, it would gradually reveal more miraculous properties.</p><p>Looking around, seeing the two demons diligently guarding the place for two years and still weak, he dismissed the idea of using them for practice.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed east, "Let's go!"</p><p>(End)</p>
