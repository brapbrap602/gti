<h1>Chapter 1604: Impossible!</h1><p>Jade pendant!</p><p>“Are you Ghost Mother?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s movements stiffened, the might of the Demonic Fire Dragon plummeting.</p><p>This jade pendant was given to him by Tan Hao.</p><p>Ghost Mother had given the jade pendant to Tan Hao as a warning treasure, a sliver of her divine sense sealed within. It would resonate in the presence of Ghost Mother.</p><p>Both his true body and avatar carried the jade pendant at all times when venturing out.</p><p>Having been in the Middle Continent for nearly two hundred years, Ghost Mother had been completely silent.</p><p>Su Zinan's reopening of the Hall of Unknowing had stirred the entire cultivation world, yet Ghost Mother hadn't appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but suspect that Ghost Mother might have encountered a ferocious beast in the Storm Belt and met with an accident. Or perhaps she had already found the path to the Boundless Sea and left the Middle Continent.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't given up.</p><p>At the Ullambana Assembly, with experts from all under heaven gathered, Ghost Mother finally appeared.</p><p>Besides her, no one else could possibly recognize the jade pendant!</p><p>At this moment, the pursuers arrived belatedly.</p><p>“Elder Qin, be careful! We’re here to help you!”</p><p>Jiang You shouted loudly. He had already joined forces with the experts of the Golden Jade Gate. Several streaks of escaping light pierced the sky, faintly forming an encirclement, preparing to surround Ghost Mother.</p><p>The white figure didn't deny it, nodding towards Qin Sang before turning and fleeing.  Flickering in the darkness, she vanished into the depths of the mountains in a few blinks.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly urged the Phoenix Wings to follow, channeling his True Essence and transmitting his voice to those behind him: "Hall Master Jiang, it's a misunderstanding! I will give you an explanation!"</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Jiang You and the others descended from the sky. Seeing the ravaged battlefield, they looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>“Were both of them Grand Cultivators?”</p><p>A Golden Jade Gate elder examined the traces, his expression solemn.</p><p>Jiang You hesitated for a moment, then nodded slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Ghost Mother and Qin Sang flew through the mountains, one after the other.</p><p>Having shaken off their pursuers, Ghost Mother stopped on a rock, Qin Sang landing not far away.</p><p>“Senior, did you sense the jade pendant during the day?”</p><p>Although Qin Sang was asking, he was almost certain that the prying gaze from the daytime belonged to Ghost Mother.</p><p>The Seven Tones Gong ringing earlier must have been Ghost Mother's deliberate action. Her purpose wasn't to steal treasures at all, but to lure him out.  Ghost Mother dared to infiltrate even the Heavenly Profound Palace’s treasury, could she really not handle three bronze gongs?</p><p>Ghost Mother said indifferently: “The number of Grand Cultivators in the North Sea back then could be counted on one hand. Without testing you, how would I know where you came from? If you were a descendant of the Heavenly Profound Palace, you’d surely be up to no good, robbing and killing!  Tan Hao was my savior, after all. I must have a word with you!”</p><p>She still remembered Tan Hao. She wasn’t heartless or ungrateful.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed the divine sense maintaining the fire lotus, saying, “Senior now knows my identity?”</p><p>“Nine Nether Demonic Fire!”</p><p>Ghost Mother glanced at Qin Sang’s sleeve. “I remember Tan Hao mentioning that the demonic sect he joined was famous for its Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  However, that demonic sect has long been destroyed.  For Tan Hao to reveal the secret of this Palace and the jade pendant to you, are you the benefactor who gave him the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?”</p><p>“Senior’s insight is truly remarkable. I admire you!”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands. “Junior Qin Sang, greetings, Senior!”</p><p>He said with some emotion, “Several decades after Senior departed, this junior obtained the sea chart at the Heavenly Profound Palace's sacred grounds and pursued you to the Middle Continent.  I never imagined it would take nearly two hundred years to finally meet Senior.”</p><p>“Two hundred years?” Ghost Mother’s delicate brows furrowed slightly, as if recalling something. “Black spiritual fire… Did you go to the Western Desert’s Vast Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, immediately realizing the hidden meaning in Ghost Mother’s words. He asked in surprise, “Could Moonlight Bodhisattva be…”</p><p>A mysterious person proficient in Buddhist scriptures had suddenly appeared in the mortal world, silencing countless Buddhist experts and humiliating the Buddhist sects of the Middle Continent.</p><p>Only an ancient cultivator like Ghost Mother could accomplish such a feat, right?</p><p>The ancient cultivation world must have been brilliant and full of extraordinary individuals, incomparable to the nearly apocalyptic, fragmented world of today.</p><p>What ancient cultivators saw, heard, and learned was unimaginable to contemporary cultivators. Ghost Mother must have been incredibly knowledgeable, even if she hadn’t specifically cultivated Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>As the saying goes, all paths lead to the same destination. For Ghost Mother to casually utter words of wisdom, frame them within Buddhist sutras, and awe the current Buddhist cultivators wouldn’t be difficult.</p><p>Ghost Mother snorted, “I wondered who dared to use this Palace! This Palace transformed into Moonlight Bodhisattva, firstly to gather ancient Buddhist scriptures, and secondly to attract Nascent Soul Buddhist cultivators from the west, so as to obtain something from the Sweet Dew Monastery. You nearly ruined my plans!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed repeatedly upon hearing this.</p><p>Back then, he had two opportunities to meet Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother had once set up an altar on Mount Jiujia, and Liuli had even personally attended the ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang had been delayed in the Sky Rift Valley, narrowly missing Ghost Mother.</p><p>In the Vast Sea, they had used Moonlight Bodhisattva to scheme for the Buddha Bone Relic, missing her once again.</p><p>Fate played tricks, it seemed!</p><p>“Was it also Senior who infiltrated the Sweet Dew Monastery?” Qin Sang looked back, connecting various facts. He hadn’t guessed wrong. Only Ghost Mother could come and go freely from Small Boundless Mountain.</p><p>“It was me!”</p><p>Ghost Mother nodded. “I failed to lure out Holy Sage Huiguang. I attempted to approach the Sweet Dew Monastery and discovered the Nascent Soul cultivator wasn’t in the mountains, so I infiltrated it, obtained the method to reach the Western Lands, and left the Middle Continent.  I only recently returned, so of course, you couldn’t find this Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t learned much about the Boundless Sea while inquiring in the Middle Continent.</p><p>The most frequently mentioned foreign land in the Middle Continent was the Western Lands.</p><p>He had heard of the Western Lands, rumors suggesting a close connection between the Buddhist sects and the Western Lands, now confirmed for the first time by Ghost Mother.</p><p>Beyond the Western Desert, within the Storm Belt, the continent was torn apart, filled with lava. The environment was even harsher than the sea.</p><p>Crossing the continent below the Nascent Soul stage was extremely dangerous. Even with a map, it would be nearly impossible. Though Ghost Mother was powerful, she likely hadn't broken through to the Nascent Soul stage yet.</p><p>This showed that the Sweet Dew Monastery wasn't just the number one Buddhist sect in the Middle Continent; it had close ties to the Western Lands.</p><p>Furthermore, the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivator was also confirmed.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Ghost Mother’s entry into the Western Lands was definitely to search for the Wu Clan.  “Tan Hao said that Senior went through countless hardships to search for your kin. Did you find anything in the Western Lands?”</p><p>Ghost Mother neither confirmed nor denied, instead asking, “You chased me across vast distances to the Middle Continent.  What is your purpose?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned solemn. He bowed deeply and said earnestly, “This junior wishes to ask Senior for help, to save someone! This junior will repay you a thousandfold!”</p><p>Ghost Mother had already guessed, not surprised in the slightest.  She chuckled, “No wonder you and Tan Hao became friends! Who is it?  Someone also sustained by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, unable to be awakened?”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly. “She is a friend of this junior.  She first saved my life and later suffered calamity because of me. As her soul was about to dissipate, this junior was forced to use the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to stabilize her Primordial Spirit, causing her to fall into a deep sleep. Unexpectedly, even until today, this junior has cultivated to the late Nascent Soul stage, yet I’m still helpless…”</p><p>Learning that it was a female cultivator, Ghost Mother gave Qin Sang a meaningful look.  “What friend?  She's your soulmate, isn’t she? A sentimental fool among Grand Cultivators is truly rare!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>No longer teasing Qin Sang, Ghost Mother explained the reason. “The Heavenly Corpse Talisman is this Palace’s simplified version of a higher-level Enslavement Talisman, fusing Corpse Dao and Rune Dao.  Although it's not high-ranked, its complexity is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Unless you are proficient in Enslavement Dao and Rune Dao, it’s not that easy to undo.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, “No wonder.” “This junior has explored for five hundred years, exhausted all methods, but couldn’t awaken her. It turns out I hadn’t found the right approach.”</p><p>“What did you say? How long has she been asleep?” Ghost Mother was stunned. “To prevent the Heavenly Corpse Sect from betraying this Palace, I initially only passed down the incomplete Heavenly Corpse Talisman to them. The talisman you used on Tan Hao’s brother was also of this kind, only capable of enslaving Primordial Spirits below the Golden Core stage… What was her cultivation level before she fell asleep?”</p><p>“Qi Refinement stage. I can sense her soul becoming increasingly stable, but I can't communicate with her,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>If Ya Gu hadn’t been with him all this time, he wouldn’t have believed it himself.</p><p>Ya Gu’s existence undoubtedly defied the laws of the Heavenly Dao, breaking the shackles of lifespan.</p><p>Unless, what he sensed was an illusion. Ya Gu’s soul had already perished, and what resided within her body was no longer her.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Ghost Mother stated categorically. “Do you take this Palace’s Heavenly Corpse Talisman for an immortal talisman, capable of defying the heavens?  Shortly after entering the body, the corpse poison will attack the heart, obliterating consciousness. No matter how well protected, it’s absolutely impossible to exceed one's own lifespan.  I knew it was impossible to revive Tan Jie, but to appease Tan Hao, I attempted a few times. The stability of her soul must be your illusion. I think you are lovesick and overworked, be careful of Qi Deviation!”</p><p>Having said that, Ghost Mother didn’t bother saying anything more to Qin Sang, flicking her sleeve and turning to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly stopped Ghost Mother. “Senior, wait! Whether it's an illusion or not, Senior will know with a glance. She’s also a member of the Wu Clan, of the same clan as Senior.”</p><p>Hearing the words “Wu Clan,” Ghost Mother’s expression changed slightly. She abruptly stopped, her gaze sharp as knives, staring into Qin Sang’s eyes. “There are no Wu Clan members in the Four Regions of the North Sea!”</p><p>Qin Sang calmly replied, “This junior wouldn't dare to lie. During the years I was missing, I accidentally fell into the realm where the Wu Clan resides. If Senior is interested, this junior will tell you everything.”</p><p>Ghost Mother said coldly, “If you dare deceive me, don’t think I can’t kill you.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, then flew to a leeward cliff face, wielding his sword to carve out a cave dwelling. He invited Ghost Mother in, then removed the Corpse Puppet Pouch from his waist, summoned Ya Gu, and gently laid her on the stone platform.</p><p>Ya Gu’s eyes were tightly closed, her complexion rosy, her breathing long and steady.  She didn’t look like a corpse puppet at all, but rather a maiden peacefully asleep.</p><p>Ghost Mother immediately noticed the wooden牌 on Ya Gu’s chest.</p><p>“Soul Nourishing Wood?”</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang with some surprise, her icy demeanor softening slightly. She walked to the stone platform and looked at Ya Gu.</p><p>With the facts laid bare, Ghost Mother couldn't help but believe.</p><p>“She truly has the bloodline of my clan…”</p><p>Ghost Mother couldn’t hide her astonishment. She didn’t know what secret technique she activated, but the depths of her pupils flickered slightly, becoming increasingly bright.  Her gaze was like substance, as if able to penetrate Ya Gu’s body, examining her carefully.</p><p>Qin Sang took half a step back, holding his breath, not daring to disturb Ghost Mother.</p><p>“Her physical body, the Shadow Bone Mark! You obtained the bones I discarded in the Abyssal Ruins, and the modifications are quite ingenious. There are some aspects even I hadn't thought of, quite exquisite… Eh? What a peculiar energy!”  Ghost Mother discovered the Three Lights Jade Liquid within Ya Gu’s body, nearly depleted after so many years.</p><p>It was Bai who modified the Bone Curse.</p><p>As Ya Gu’s condition improved, coupled with the Bone Curse's effects, and the other spirit medicines Qin Sang found to suppress corpse Qi and protect her physical body, the Three Lights Jade Liquid was no longer needed for maintenance.</p><p>Ghost Mother could still sense the residual fluctuations of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, demonstrating her sharp spiritual sense.</p><p>“You’ve used many good things on her! Tan Hao's luck wasn't as good as yours. I’m starting to believe you now, but having consciousness after five hundred years is too illogical…”</p><p>Ghost Mother’s brows furrowed deeper, puzzled.</p><p>A moment later, the divine light in Ghost Mother's eyes receded. She raised her right hand, performing over a dozen incredibly complex hand seals, and pointed her index finger at Ya Gu’s forehead.</p><p>Ghost Mother immediately noticed something amiss, withdrawing her finger and saying gravely, “She has a natal Gu worm. How did she become its master?  Did the spirit insect willingly choose her?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “What’s the difference between a spirit insect willingly choosing a master and other methods?”</p><p>Ghost Mother frowned, silent for a moment, then said, “Her natal Gu worm is very alert, hiding within her soul. I can't forcibly extract it, it would damage her Primordial Spirit.  You should be very familiar with her natal Gu worm…”</p><p>Fatty Silkworm was sometimes audacious, sometimes timid as a mouse.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense, probing into Ya Gu’s Purple Mansion, calling for Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this time Fatty Silkworm refused to come out, trembling within Ya Gu’s soul, terrified of Ghost Mother.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, looking at Ghost Mother, unsure of the reason.</p><p>Ghost Mother smiled.  “It must have sensed my Gu worm aura.”</p><p>He didn’t know the realm of Ghost Mother’s Gu worm, he hadn't seen her use any spirit Gu insects during their earlier clash.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently coaxed for a while, finally summoning Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm crawled onto Qin Sang’s palm and immediately released a poisonous mist, enveloping itself.</p><p>The moment Fatty Silkworm appeared, Ghost Mother's expression changed drastically, her eyes fixated on Fatty Silkworm, her astonishment growing.</p><p>After awakening and arriving in this fragmented world, there weren't many things that could surprise Ghost Mother, yet she had encountered several today, all related to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the unusual look on Ghost Mother’s face and looked at Fatty Silkworm in surprise.</p><p>Could this fellow have some impressive background?</p><p>“A descendant of the Divine Silkworm!”</p><p>Ghost Mother blurted out, incredulous.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned, recalling the legends he heard in the Wu Clan.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Silkworm, nine transformations to ascend to immortality.</p><p>The Divine Silkworm was revered as the divine insect of the Wu Clan, the Gu worm of the Wu God, and the only spirit insect in Wu Clan legends to achieve immortality!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine that this fellow, with such a wretched personality, only skilled in the Poison Dao, was actually a descendant of the Divine Silkworm.</p><p>“No! It’s not!”</p><p>Ghost Mother suddenly contradicted her own judgment. Ignoring Fatty Silkworm’s reaction, she used a secret technique to sense it, then breathed a sigh of relief. “It’s not a direct descendant of the Divine Silkworm, but it possesses the Divine Silkworm bloodline, although very diluted. It's her good fortune!”</p><p>Ghost Mother looked at Ya Gu, a trace of envy in her eyes.</p><p>“The Divine Silkworm is proud. Even with just a trace of its bloodline! Unless under special circumstances, it wouldn’t willingly choose a master. How did she do it?”</p><p>Qin Sang was a bit embarrassed. “Being scared by me, does that count as a special circumstance?”</p><p>Fatty Silkworm didn't have an ounce of pride, it was gluttonous, cowardly, and a bully…</p><p>Back then, Fatty Silkworm had been threatened by him into recognizing Ya Gu as its master, smugly thinking it had won, unaware that it had completely fallen into his hands.</p><p>Ghost Mother was speechless.</p><p>“Is it the reason Ya Gu has survived until now?” Qin Sang looked at Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>“Both. The Soul Nourishing Wood and that peculiar energy played a significant role,” Ghost Mother first acknowledged Qin Sang’s efforts, then continued, “After willingly choosing a master, the spirit insect and master become one, and the Divine Silkworm bloodline must have special abilities…”</p><p>As she spoke, Ghost Mother grabbed Fatty Silkworm, forcing it to display its divine abilities.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm could only repeatedly spit out poison beads and protective auras, eventually tiring itself out, its tongue lolling out.</p><p>Ghost Mother was dumbfounded, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Who raised a Divine Silkworm like this?!”</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to Qi Zhi You Zou for the Alliance Leader donation again and again and again and again. I haven't looked at the backend these past two days, just saw it now.</p>
