Boom!’</p><p>The  serpent’s flames blazed fiercely.</p><p>Waves of icy flames rained down, a spectacularly destructive scene.</p><p>The battle between Qin Sang and Yin Changsheng was far more intense than Tong Lingyu’s;  the cave was unrecognizable, aside from the  Blood Pool of Yin.</p><p>The serpent repeatedly lashed its long tail, each strike like a blue lightning bolt, nearly shattering the Seven Souls Killing Array with its devastating power.</p><p>Icy flames danced in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were like fragile people struggling to survive a harsh winter, clinging to each other in the face of a terrifying beast, constantly on the brink of death, their corpses destined to become the beast’s meal.</p><p>Liuli completely entrusted herself to Qin Sang, focusing all her attention on contesting the spiritual treasure with Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding Liuli, his face bloodied and haggard, retreated steadily.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Array, the only sword array recorded in the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Spirit*,  withstood the onslaught of the spiritual treasure, repeatedly collapsing and then miraculously reforming.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had thought he would easily subdue Qin Sang, but he was wrong.</p><p>Qin Sang, though heavily wounded and seemingly on the verge of defeat, would somehow unleash reserves of strength, gaining a brief burst of power to survive the crisis.</p><p>At this point, Yin Changsheng finally understood: he had been tricked!</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng couldn’t possibly guess that his psychic attacks hadn't harmed Qin Sang at all, assuming only that Qin Sang possessed a method to protect his spirit, and that his injuries were not as severe as they appeared.</p><p>Yin Changsheng flew into a rage.</p><p>The serpent’s attacks became even more ferocious, mirroring its master's fury.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  Yin Changsheng’s frustration was growing with each failed attempt; the influence of the black magic was subtly deepening.  If this continued, Tong Lingyu’s scheme might actually succeed.</p><p>But Qin Sang felt this strategy was flawed.</p><p>It placed all their hope on their opponent.</p><p>If there were unexpected variables, such as the opponent possessing unknown trump cards, everything would be in vain.</p><p>He had the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Surely, the esteemed Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace possessed more than just these techniques?</p><p>Throughout his cultivation journey, Qin Sang had never passively waited for death; he had always actively sought opportunities, enabling him to escape countless perils.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Yin Changsheng used the same tactic.</p><p>The serpent opened its massive mouth and merged with the icy flames once more.</p><p>The icy flames resembled a cold sun, radiating a chilling aura. The cavern had completely turned into an ice cave; any low-level cultivator entering would instantly freeze to death.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Icy flames shot out.</p><p>Like falling meteors, they struck with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. Although he had managed to survive each crisis, he could only defend himself; he hadn't found a chance to counterattack. He was walking a tightrope, his mind exhausted.</p><p>The Golden Silent Sword trembled, emitting a clear ringing sound, once again forming a sword array, faithfully protecting its master.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A radiant torrent of fire pierced through the dark sword array, its power overwhelming, destroying countless sword threads.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>The sword array was once again pierced.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this; he tightened his grip on Liuli, shifting them dozens of meters sideways. From the beginning of the battle, he had circled the edge of the cavern, his attention always fixed on the blood pool, and he was making a new discovery.</p><p>The energy of the Blood Pool of Yin didn't seem to be connected to Yin Changsheng himself, but to the ice coffin!</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed, but before he could steady himself, he sensed something above and felt a sudden warning.</p><p>Above them, a white hand appeared amidst swirling mist.</p><p>Its fingers spread, like an eagle's talons, swooping down towards Liuli.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had predicted Qin Sang's landing spot. The hand was incredibly fast, leaving them no time to dodge.</p><p>It resembled the technique used by the Yue cultivator during the trial in the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>However, this white hand was smaller but denser, far surpassing the Yue cultivator in speed and power.</p><p>"Another top-tier technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace held countless secret techniques. Yin Changsheng, the Palace Master, truly lived up to his title;  top-tier secret techniques appeared one after another, leaving him struggling to cope.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The hand was lightning-fast.</p><p>In this critical moment, a resolute glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Then, a silver thread of lightning shot out from Qin Sang's dantian, striking the hand's palm before it could reach its target.</p><p>*SNAP!*</p><p>The large hand froze, then disintegrated, vanishing before their eyes.  Qin Sang and Liuli were unharmed.  The seemingly delicate Lei Si had easily countered the spell.</p><p>Qin Sang could no longer hide her hand and revealed another trump card, using the Celestial Eye Light to diffuse the crisis.  After the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s advancement, the Celestial Eye Light had also improved, allowing for more precise timing – this was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>Such opportunities are rare in a duel, so it wasn’t a wasted effort. However, it wasn’t good news for Qin Sang.  Each trump card used is one less, and next time Yin Changsheng would be prepared, making it ineffective.</p><p>The secret technique had been inexplicably broken.  Yin Changsheng hadn’t anticipated this, his expression stiffening.  His eyes were fixed on Qin Sang’s dantian; the Celestial Eye Light had appeared too suddenly, and he hadn’t seen clearly if it was a magical artifact or something else.</p><p>For a moment, the underground cavern fell strangely silent.</p><p>“Huff… huff…”</p><p>Qin Sang, with Liuli beside her, darted to the other side, gasping for breath and quickly swallowing a few spirit pills – better than nothing.  The Jin Chen Sword silently returned to her.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close watch on the ice coffin, her heart filled with apprehension. Yin Changsheng’s sudden stop was suspicious.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng’s chilling voice echoed from within the ice coffin.  It was not only raspy but also crazed, laced with a palpable fury – strangely unsettling. He was clearly weary and enraged by Qin Sang’s relentless resistance.</p><p>“I never imagined anyone in this world could force me to unleash the Hanging Sword Tower!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng’s tone turned icy.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, a premonition of ill omen washing over her. Tong Lingyu clearly didn't know her master well enough!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The cold mist within the ice coffin churned violently. Yin Changsheng’s figure flickered, appearing to rise from the coffin itself.</p><p>Simultaneously, a white light slowly ascended from the ice coffin.</p><p>Within the white light was an extremely ornate nine-story pagoda – Yin Changsheng’s life-bound treasure, the Hanging Sword Tower!</p><p>The tower was completely translucent, seemingly carved from a single piece of glacial ice.  Every detail was exquisitely crafted. All nine floors were hollow, lacking walls, supported only by four pillars.</p><p>In the center of each floor hung a sword.</p><p>The swords, like the tower, were carved from glacial ice, similar in size and shape, but each bore different carvings and ancient characters, barely recognizable to anyone.</p><p>Nine floors, nine hanging swords.  That’s how the tower got its name.</p><p>Upon seeing the Hanging Sword Tower, Qin Sang’s face paled, and she truly felt the threat to her life.</p><p>Another magical artifact?</p>
