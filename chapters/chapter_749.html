<h1>Chapter 741: Enemies Meet</h1><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed a prying gaze.</p><p>He turned his head and saw a window, a man standing before it, nodding at him.</p><p>"Late Core Formation."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, as expected.  The Seven Kills Palace had undergone changes, with the Wu Clan's Great Shaman breaking the formation and scaring off some. Those who dared to participate now were all experts.</p><p>"I guess the number of people won't be too high, but I don't know how many teams the East Pole Alliance will divide into. Currently, I not only have no idea what the mission is, but I also don't know the identity of the leader. To command so many experts, the leader's strength must be at least Late Core Formation.  They can't send a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, can they?  No matter how strong a Core Formation cultivator is, itâ€™s difficult to participate in battles between Nascent Soul cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, walking into the wooden building.</p><p>As evening approached, Qin Sang, who was meditating in his room, sensed the wooden building's restriction being triggered. With a wave of his hand, a tadpole-like blue light flew in.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Crushing the blue light, he stood up, walked out of the building, and headed towards the innermost wooden building.  Finally, he met the leader of this expedition.</p><p>Six people were already sitting in the hall, but Qin Sang immediately noticed this particular person.</p><p>His cultivation was the highest, if not peak Core Formation, then very close.</p><p>The man wore a long robe, looked about forty years old, with sharp eyebrows and eyes, and an air of authority.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, the man got up and cupped his hands. "I, Xiang, have been waiting for you for a long time. I had some business outside today and couldn't greet you personally. I hope you won't mind."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, you are too kind."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the gesture, curiously looking at the other five people.</p><p>Among these five, one was the man who greeted him during the day. Sitting beside him was a beautiful woman. The two seemed quite intimate, possibly Dao companions.</p><p>The man was a Late Core Formation expert, while the woman's cultivation was similar to Qin Sang's, likely having recently broken through to Mid-Core Formation.</p><p>The couple was very amiable, actively greeting Qin Sang.</p><p>To their left, a cold and arrogant young man sat alone, holding a sword. Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, he only glanced at him indifferently, with no expression.</p><p>To the young man's left was a fat man, practically overflowing his chair.</p><p>He squeezed out a smile, the flesh on his face trembling.</p><p>Both of these two were at the peak of Mid-Core Formation.  It was reasonable to assume they were likely stuck at a bottleneck and forced to enter the Seven Kills Palace to seek opportunities.</p><p>Lastly, there was a strange man with a mask covering half of his left face.  The mask seemed to be fused to his bone, covered with blood vessels, with a scarlet left eye, very eerie. At first glance, he resembled a malevolent spirit.</p><p>Compared to him, Qin Sang in his cloak didn't seem so strange.</p><p>This man's cultivation was also peculiar. On the surface, he was Mid-Core Formation, quite ordinary, but when his evil eye looked over, Qin Sang felt a slight stinging in his eyes.</p><p>None of them concealed their cultivation levels. Qin Sang easily discerned them, but their true strength couldn't be judged by ordinary standards.  Those who dared to enter the Seven Kills Palace definitely had a few life-saving tricks up their sleeves.</p><p>"Let me introduce everyone. This is Daoist Qing Feng of the Qiongyu Trading Company..."</p><p>After the leader's introductions, they all learned each other's backgrounds.</p><p>Apart from the leader, the other five, like Qin Sang, came from various trading companies of the East Pole Alliance. The man and woman were indeed Dao companions, from the same company.  The man's surname was Liu.</p><p>The leader's name was Xiang Yi.  He didn't seem to be from a trading company. His background was rather mysterious, and Qin Sang wisely didn't inquire further.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang sat down in a corner.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, for this trip to the Seven Kills Palace, it's just the seven of us?"</p><p>The Liu couple seemed quite familiar with Xiang Yi, asking bluntly, "What exactly does the Alliance want us to do? You've been tight-lipped, but can you tell us now?"</p><p>"There's one more Fellow Daoist from the Nine Star Society arriving soon. Eight of us are enough to handle most dangers.  Any more would be too conspicuous and attract unwanted attention, which would be detrimental to the mission."</p><p>Xiang Yi spoke calmly. "As for the Alliance's mission, I cannot disclose it. You will know once we enter the Seven Kills Palace. This is the Alliance Leader's order; I dare not disobey."</p><p>Hearing "Nine Star Society," Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He thought, "It can't be that much of a coincidence, can it?"</p><p>He only knew one cultivator from the Nine Star Society.</p><p>The others frowned at Xiang Yi's words; the sword-wielding youth raised an eyebrow, his face full of dissatisfaction.</p><p>The fat man chuckled, his words laced with subtle barbs, "Fellow Daoist Xiang, since you can't reveal the mission details, we wouldn't dare defy the Alliance Leader's orders. But can you at least give us a hint about the difficulty and the time required? As far as I know, the immortal formation outside the Seven Kills Palace is no small matter.  Even if forcefully broken, the time a spirit formation can last is limited. We must leave before the formation closes. If the mission takes too long, leaving no time to search for treasures, wouldn't we be spending our own spirit stones working for the Alliance? What's the point?"</p><p>As he spoke, the fat man looked around. Everyone nodded in agreement, Qin Sang included.</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't take offense, his expression unchanging.  He said calmly, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoists. I can guarantee that this trip will take at most a quarter of the available time, leaving plenty for you. As long as you all cooperate and assist me, everything will go smoothly, and it might even be faster. As for whether there will be dangers, I can only say that I have made ample preparations. But the Seven Kills Palace is unpredictable, and no one can be certain if there will be unexpected events."</p><p>"As long as you have a plan, Fellow Daoist, I have full confidence in your character."</p><p>The fat man grinned, no longer pressing the matter.</p><p>The others didn't press further, asking a few inconsequential questions as they waited for the final person to arrive.</p><p>Soon, footsteps sounded from outside.</p><p>The old man guarding the door announced loudly, "Uncle Xiang, Fellow Daoist Cui from the Nine Star Society has arrived."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Looking towards the entrance, he saw a withered, almost skeletal young man, with a perpetual leer in his eyes, sauntering in.</p><p>It was none other than Cui Ji.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't seen him since driving him away from Five Elements Island. Cui Ji had been surprisingly compliant, not causing any further trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially been wary of him seeking revenge in secret.</p><p>But since there had been no activity, the matter had been forgotten.</p><p>Compared to over twenty years ago, Cui Ji's aura was significantly stronger, but his cultivation remained stuck at Mid-Core Formation, similar to the sword-wielding youth.</p><p>Moreover, Cui Ji's current state seemed off.  He was too thin, his skin pale and bloodless, likely a side effect of cultivating some sort of secret technique.</p><p>"Is this guy also trapped by a bottleneck?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, his expression strange.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Cui, you've arrived. Please, have a seat," Xiang Yi stood up to welcome him.</p><p>Cui Ji was about to sit down when he suddenly saw Qin Sang. A wave of unpleasant memories surged into his mind.</p><p>The same cloak, and a remarkably similar aura.</p><p>"Demon Daoist! It's you!"</p><p>Cui Ji roared in fury.</p>
