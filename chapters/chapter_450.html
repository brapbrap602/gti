Chapter 443: Three Years


A cultivator of the Di clan, a Golden Core stage expert, immediately agreed: "Island Master, rest assured. I will immediately send a message back to my sect."
The Snake Madam, or She Po, uttered a sound of affirmation.  A "Cold" character ancient order appeared in her palm. She said in a low voice, "In the name of the Island Master of Guānxīng Island, I issue this order to the Lesser Cold Region! This is a matter of life and death…"

All the Golden Core cultivators on the island, regardless of righteous or demonic cultivation, or even the unaffiliated cultivators from Yīnshān Pass, including the serpentine man who revealed his true form, all looked serious, patiently awaiting the Snake Madam's every word.

They bowed to the Snake Madam and received the order!
…

The Heavenly Mandate Alliance retreated, but that didn’t mean safety.  Qín Sāng and the other Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't allowed to participate in the discussions.  They recovered their Qi while secretly observing the central island.

The Golden Core cultivators on the island gathered to discuss, no one knew what plans they would make.  Their fates were not in their own hands, but in the hands of others.

After all the Golden Core cultivators paid their respects to the Snake Madam, Chē Yùtáo's gaze swept across the area, landing on Qin Sang.

Then, Zhān Yì, seated beside Qin Sang, was summoned before Chē Yùtáo. He received a token-like object and flew north out of the fog sea. Before leaving, he nodded to Qin Sang.

Many others and several Golden Core cultivators left with him.

After a while, Qin Sang and the others finally received clear orders.

Everyone was grouped into squads according to their cultivation level.  They were then assigned to different islands within the array to cultivate. Without orders, no one was allowed to leave.
…

Over three years, the chaotic waters of the island region underwent a drastic transformation.  The Lesser Cold Region spared no expense, reinforcing the spirit array numerous times. The current True Water Thousand Illusions Array was not only far more powerful than before, but its range had also expanded several times over.

Now, the entire chaotic island region was enveloped by the True Water Thousand Illusions Array.  A rectangular area oriented east-west was carved out within the fog sea, a considerable expanse.

The Lesser Cold Region cultivators relied on the islands and the True Water Thousand Illusions Array to stand against the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.

The Heavenly Mandate Alliance also had a similar base in the south of the chaotic island region, a place called Lake Taiqing. A vast expanse of water separated the two sides; that was the battlefield.

At dawn, the thin fog gradually dissipated, the water surface as smooth as a mirror, unusually calm.

Not a single bird was in sight.

This wasn't surprising; few birds had been seen in the area for these past three years.

‘Bang!’

A clash of metal from the distance broke the silence.

Following this, dozens of multicolored遁光 (dùnguāng – escaping lights/flying figures) could be seen chasing each other towards here. Among these lights, there were also the glows of swords, blades, and other magical artifacts.

Clearly, these cultivators were engaged in fierce battle. Their cultivation bases were not low; the lowest were at the early Foundation Establishment stage, and some were even at the late Foundation Establishment stage.

One side pursued while the other retreated, fighting as they went. Although at a disadvantage, their formation remained intact, and a rout seemed unlikely in the short term.

‘Whoosh whoosh…’

More escaping lights flew past overhead.

At that moment, unnoticed by anyone, a shadow silently emerged on the water’s surface, hiding under the water, secretly observing the battlefield.

The shadow concealed a person – none other than Qin Sang.

Qin Sang watched with wide eyes.

The fleeing side was made up of Lesser Cold Region cultivators, including a fellow disciple, Senior Brother Mù Yīfēng.

As for those pursuing them, it was undoubtedly cultivators of the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.

Over the past three years, this scene had been repeated countless times, sometimes with the Lesser Cold Region cultivators being chased, and sometimes the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.

The aerial battle was intense, with magical artifacts clashing frequently and incantations flying back and forth.

Qin Sang pondered for a moment, his brow flashed, and the ebony sword flew out on its own, concealing its blade before flying towards the battlefield.

Soon, the ebony sword approached the battlefield. Qin Sang’s gaze shifted quickly, finally settling on a middle-aged man in a brocade robe.

This man wasn’t the highest-cultivating cultivator on the Heavenly Mandate Alliance side, but he was a late Foundation Establishment stage expert with considerable strength. He was evenly matched against Mù Yīfēng, even subtly suppressing him.

Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on the man in the brocade robe, and the Heavenly Mandate Alliance's battle formation, finally spotting a weakness. His eyes lit up, and his lips moved slightly: "Go!"

A deafening thunderclap suddenly echoed through the clear sky.

The ebony sword reappeared, moving from stillness to action, instantly displaying its extreme speed.  The sword light, like a bolt of lightning, darted to the back of the man in the brocade robe in an instant.

"I knew you were treacherous…"

The man in the brocade robe sneered. He had been prepared. A mysterious spirit chart suddenly appeared on his seemingly unguarded back.

The spirit chart emanated a mysterious glow; it was far from ordinary.

An ordinary flying sword would surely be easily blocked by the spirit chart.


Alas, he encountered Qin Sang and the Ebony Sword!

Qin Sang didn't use the Blood-Soiled Divine Light.  That was one of his most powerful trump cards; he only used it when certain of a kill and with no witnesses.  He'd only used it once in three years.

However, his Sword Qi Thunder Sound ability and the Ebony Sword's sharpness were enough to handle most dangers, even earning him a considerable reputation.

*Boom!*

The Sword Qi Thunder Sound was incredibly fast. Before the opponent's attack fully formed, the Ebony Sword struck, shattering it.  The spirit talisman was also damaged, though not destroyed.

Qin Sang didn't press his advantage, sheathing the Ebony Sword immediately.  His cautious use of the sword had kept its true nature—a magical artifact—a secret.

That was enough. The middle-aged man, unprepared for such a powerful surprise attack, froze.  Taking advantage of the opening, Mu Yifeng struck, his divine blade a blur of motion.

"Sword Qi Thunder Sound…"

The sneer on the middle-aged man's face froze.  His eyes widened in shock, but he was too slow.  The Nine-Flame Divine Blade pierced his chest, killing him instantly.

"No good! It's the Shadowless Sword!"

"Run!"

The other Tianxing League cultivators screamed in terror, abandoning their dead comrade without hesitation and fleeing.

Qin Sang chuckled wryly. After three years of battles, he'd earned quite a reputation—and the moniker "Shadowless Sword,"  appropriating the name of the renowned Wujimen technique.  This didn't sit well with the Wujimen disciples.

The enemy retreated in good order. Qin Sang's group chose not to pursue, dividing the spoils. Qin Sang then returned alone to the  Luan Dao waters.

After flying for some time, a massive wall of fog appeared in the north, completely obscuring his vision.  The fog reached the heavens, persistent for years, stretching endlessly to the east and west.

Seeing the fog sea, Qin Sang confidently steered his  Youluo Cloud towards the fog wall.  He raised the token he'd prepared.

Qin Sang felt a tightening sensation. The token emitted a soft, milky white light. Upon touching the fog, a bright beam shot out from the depths of the fog sea, forming a narrow passage before him.

Clearly, Qin Sang was familiar with this.

He continued his journey on his cloud, passing through the passage.

After flying a distance into the fog sea, the view ahead suddenly opened up.

A fine mist fell, making things somewhat dim, but visibility was still good.
