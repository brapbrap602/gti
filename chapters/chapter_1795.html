<h1>Chapter 1786: The Jushan Altar</h1><p>The two stood midway along a mountain range, nestled between two towering peaks. Night had fallen, yet the moon had yet to rise. The mountain hollow, which should have been shrouded in darkness, was instead bathed in a radiant glow. This vibrant light didn't just illuminate the two figures; it also cascaded over the northern foothills of the entire mountain range, stretching across the land to the north, embracing the vegetation in its warm embrace. The world seemed draped in a brocade of light. This wasn't the afterglow of sunset; the source of this radiance lay in the direction they faced.</p><p>Vast swathes of multicolored auspicious clouds drifted across the horizon, stretching as far as the eye could see. These auspicious clouds weren't static; they flowed and shifted constantly, yet they never strayed from that region of the sky.  A thick layer of clouds blanketed the surroundings, obscuring the earth, mountains, and all living things below.  A wondrous light emanated from the depths of the auspicious clouds, filtering through them and transforming into a dazzling, multicolored spectacle, radiating outwards for thousands of miles.  It was as if an eternal sun resided within, its light perpetually illuminating the eight directions, day and night, without end.</p><p>Eternal daylight reigned in this area. Even when the moon rose, its faint outline was barely discernible to a cultivator's enhanced vision, dimmed by the pervasive glow.  The radiance was almost blinding. They were still more than ten miles from the auspicious clouds, yet bathed in their light, their figures appeared somewhat indistinct. However, the glow was harmless to the local flora and fauna; the nearby vegetation was even more lush than elsewhere. Certain beasts with a natural affinity for light were drawn to the glow, gathering in the vicinity.</p><p>Yet, an eerie silence enveloped the two. The area surrounding the auspicious clouds was quiet, almost deathly still. This was because, not long ago, tremors had emanated from the depths of the auspicious clouds, sending waves of primal fear through the living creatures, causing them to flee in terror. The beast hordes Qin Sang and his companion had encountered were spirit beasts escaping from this very place. Such occurrences weren't uncommon. The depths of the auspicious clouds were volatile, periodically convulsing. Once stability returned, the beasts would gradually congregate once more.</p><p>Now, the auspicious clouds were tranquil.  The dark-skinned man gazed into the depths of the auspicious clouds, his eyes gleaming with a peculiar light, as if employing some kind of spiritual eye technique. He perceived fleeting, illusory images within the clouds: celestial palaces and jade pavilions, a vast starry sea, and a meandering celestial river, all shifting and transforming with the undulating clouds.</p><p>“Why would there be such a place within the Nie Yuan?” the dark-skinned man voiced his bewilderment.  The Nie Yuan evoked only one feeling: desolation!  Common perception held the Nie Yuan to be an untamed wilderness, yet here was a breathtaking sight, clearly not of natural origin.</p><p>“Look there,” Jiutian Jinque Yushi said, raising a hand and pointing towards the fleeting image of a palace, “Does it seem familiar?”</p><p>“Familiar?”  The dark-skinned man frowned, scenes flashing through his mind. He had accompanied Jiutian Jinque Yushi on visits to several Daoist sects, some of whose temples rivaled celestial landscapes, though their grandeur paled in comparison to the illusions before him.  Could it be…? A sudden realization dawned on the dark-skinned man.  “An Altar?”</p><p>Jiutian Jinque Yushi nodded slightly. “Indeed! According to ancient records, this was once the Altar of Jushan Zhi.”  The Altar was the heart of a Zhi, and the Altars of Zhongmao Zhi and Baishi Zhi were the pivotal points of the two Daoist academies.</p><p>“The Altar is here? How vast was the Jushan Zhi of old?” The dark-skinned man was astonished. The current Jushan Zhi was the largest of the four Zhis in the world. He had heard Jiutian Jinque Yushi mention that the Altar not only conferred authority but also housed a Daoist artifact called the Dugong Seal. The two Daoist academies each held the Dugong Seals of Zhongmao Zhi and Baishi Zhi respectively.  As for the other powers of the Altar and the Dugong Seal, the dark-skinned man remained unaware; perhaps even Jiutian Jinque Yushi didn't know everything.</p><p>One thing was certain: the Altar was the foundation of a Zhi, located at its very center.  The ability of cultivators to cultivate peacefully after being conferred authority was inextricably linked to the Altar. Grand Elders couldn't conceal their auras within the Nie Yuan, supposedly because they were too far from the Altar. Yet, this place was still so far from the northern border of Jushan Zhi. Just how vast had the former Jushan Zhi been? The other three Zhis combined couldn't compare.</p><p>Jiutian Jinque Yushi flicked his finger, sending out a golden light that transformed into a golden mirror before him, revealing the scene at the edge of the auspicious clouds. “Daoist records state that Jushan Zhi was once the foremost of the four Zhis, until its Altar was shattered in a cataclysmic battle, leading to its complete decline. Look…”  As he spoke, Jiutian Jinque Yushi shifted the image in the mirror towards the auspicious clouds, revealing the scene within their depths. He pointed casually at a few spots.  “These shadows of mountains and rivers might be illusions, or they might be real, but they are definitely not the mountains and rivers we know. They are manifestations of divine abilities and Daoist techniques. I have ventured deep into the Jushan Altar many times and witnessed two star rivers, formed by divine abilities, colliding and remaining locked in a stalemate to this day. We paid our respects and retreated discreetly. If we were to disturb those two star rivers, Fellow Daoist Mo might never see me again.” Jiutian Jinque Yushi chuckled self-deprecatingly.  The battles of their predecessors, their divine abilities lingering to this day.  Jiutian Jinque Yushi was a late-stage Dongxuan realm cultivator, just a step away from Grand Elder, yet he admitted he wouldn't even be able to save himself.</p><p>“A True Monarch’s battle? Or perhaps… a Celestial Master’s?” The dark-skinned man was utterly shocked. The Daoist Grand Elders remained hidden within the Altar, while True Monarchs and Celestial Masters were mere legends. The scene at the Jushan Altar indicated that, at least in ancient times, True Monarchs and Celestial Masters did exist in this world.</p><p>Shaking his head, Jiutian Jinque Yushi said, “It’s enough for Fellow Daoist Mo to know that it’s extremely dangerous inside. There are divine abilities of ancient mighty figures, as well as folded and shattered spaces. For countless years, every tremor of the auspicious clouds represents adjustments between them, maintaining a precarious balance. Grand Elders, unable to restrain their own auras, would trigger disturbances and dare not enter the Jushan Altar. We must be even more cautious. The outer regions of the auspicious clouds are relatively safer, but venturing deeper into the Jushan Altar could lead to utter destruction!”</p><p>Having reached his current level of cultivation, the dark-skinned man naturally understood the importance of caution. With a grave expression, he asked, “Are we going deep into the Jushan Altar this time?”</p><p>Jiutian Jinque Yushi hummed in agreement. “Based on your description, Fellow Daoist Mo, the scene you witnessed before losing consciousness bears some resemblance to the depths of the Jushan Altar. I suspect that you fell into the Jushan Altar when you broke through the realms and were somehow flung out, as there are countless eternal fissures within, some potentially connected to other realms. Moreover, according to my investigations, before I found you, there was a disturbance in the depths of the auspicious clouds, more violent and prolonged than any recorded before.”</p><p>Knowing the origin of the auspicious clouds and hearing Jiutian Jinque Yushi’s explanation, the dark-skinned man felt a surge of fear. He had been struck by a terrifying force upon breaking through the realms, losing consciousness instantly. When he awoke, he found himself rescued by this Jiutian Jinque Yushi. The Jushan Altar was fraught with peril; while unconscious, even the slightest disturbance could have easily crushed him. Being flung out of the Altar, though severely injured, was undeniably a stroke of immense luck.  Reflecting on this, the dark-skinned man sighed imperceptibly. “I recall some fragments, bizarre and surreal images. If I can find that place, I should be able to remember.”</p><p>Finding the place in his memories held the key to finding the gate between the two realms. Not only did he desire to leave, but Jiutian Jinque Yushi was also deeply interested in that place.</p><p>“Unfortunately, despite sending out so many messages, I haven’t been able to locate your companion, Fellow Daoist Mo. Since her condition was better than yours, she might not have lost consciousness and may have walked out of the Jushan Altar on her own… There’s no need to rush. This time, our primary objective is to investigate the Ghost Fang Nation's plot. We’ll have some time to scout the path, and with thorough preparation, we’ll explore fully later.  Of course, it would be best to achieve both goals at once…”</p><p>As he spoke, Jiutian Jinque Yushi’s voice suddenly paused. “Someone has arrived,” he murmured.  The image in the mirror shifted rapidly, revealing another valley. The valley was overgrown with wild grass, as tall as small trees, lush and vibrant, yet no figures were visible within.  Seeing this, Jiutian Jinque Yushi praised, “Impressive concealment techniques! It's quite a coincidence that they happened to pass by this area, considering the vastness of the auspicious clouds. Any further, and even my Tianjing Talisman wouldn't be able to reveal them.”  With that, Jiutian Jinque Yushi pressed his finger onto the center of the golden mirror, ripples spreading across its surface. Four blurred figures then materialized.</p><p>The four were hidden within the tall grass, gazing at the spectacle of the auspicious clouds.  They remained stationary, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>“Four people. They should be able to cause some trouble for the Ghost Fang Nation…”  Jiutian Jinque Yushi nodded in satisfaction.  The Jushan Altar contained treasures left behind from ancient battles, and some incredibly lucky individuals had even obtained grand legacies from mighty figures on their deathbeds.  However, after countless years of exploration by the Daoist Court and the demonic forces, few treasures remained. Even if there were any overlooked items, they would be located in extremely dangerous places, inaccessible to ordinary people. Time and again, explorations had returned empty-handed.  Now, fewer and fewer cultivators ventured into the Jushan Altar.</p><p>The appearance of these four Dongxuan realm cultivators at this time must have been in response to the Daoist Court’s summons, to scout the path for them.  Observing from afar with a talisman, Jiutian Jinque Yushi didn’t dare push its power to the limit for fear of being detected. He also recognized Youhuang Zhenren among the four.  The other three, accompanying Youhuang Zhenren, were likely of similar strength.</p><p>Jiutian Jinque Yushi waved his hand, dissipating the golden mirror, then cast several more talismans, setting up a formation in preparation for their upcoming plan. He didn't notice the unusual behavior of the person beside him.</p><p>The moment he saw the four figures in the mirror, the dark-skinned man's gaze froze, fixated on one of them. This person stood at the forefront of the group, silent during their discussions, his hand clenching and unclenching as if deep in thought.  At that moment, the person seemed to sense something and suddenly looked up. It was at this precise moment that Jiutian Jinque Yushi withdrew the Tianjing Talisman.  The mirror vanished, but that blurred face remained etched in the dark-skinned man’s mind, a flicker of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“How could it be him! A coincidence? Or…”</p><p>“Could that Ascension Tribulation have been caused by him?”  A storm raged within the dark-skinned man’s heart, yet his expression remained unchanged. Glancing at the busy Jiutian Jinque Yushi, he remained silent, standing respectfully by his side.</p><p>…</p><p>In another valley.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three had traversed layers of beast hordes, reaching the final mountain range near their target, concealing themselves in a deserted valley.</p><p>“This is it,” Youhuang Zhenren said, pointing at the auspicious clouds with a nostalgic expression.  “When I first broke through to the Dongxuan realm, driven by curiosity, I ventured deep within with other fellow Daoists and witnessed truly breathtaking sights.”</p><p>“I’ve never heard you mention this before,” Guyun Zhenren said in surprise. “You entered the depths of the auspicious clouds? I only explored the outer regions, returning empty-handed. Did you obtain any ancient treasures?”</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren shook his head with a chuckle. “What ancient treasures?  Countless experts from the Daoist Court and the Ghost Fang Nation have searched this place.  Could there possibly be anything left for us? I merely went to broaden my horizons and inspire my pursuit of the Dao.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Guyun Zhenren said, turning to Zhijian Zhenren. “Would those Demon Marquises enter the depths of the auspicious clouds?  It would be difficult to guarantee our safety if we encounter them inside.”</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren had been observing the auspicious clouds in the sky. The clouds shifted unpredictably.  After a moment of observation, he said, “The cloud qi is unstable now; it's not the ideal time to enter. When the cloud qi stabilizes, cloud paths will appear on three sides, excluding the north.  The location of the cloud paths varies each time, but they all lead to the same place, which serves as a boundary between the inner and outer regions.  It’s quite a vast area.  The Demon Marquises were active in that area before, so we’ll search nearby first and strike any lone demons we encounter.  If we find nothing, we’ll formulate a plan based on the situation.”</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren nodded in agreement.  “The depths of the auspicious clouds aren't uniformly dangerous. The danger increases as you go deeper.  If we sense danger, we’ll stop.  When the demons return, we can ambush them.”</p><p>The group discussed amongst themselves. Qin Sang spoke rarely, multitasking, listening to their exchange while comprehending the *Seven Masters’ Buddha Seals*.  He had continuously employed two of the seals in the previous battles, gradually grasping some of their subtleties.  Suddenly, Qin Sang looked up, feeling the glow intensify as the depths of the auspicious clouds churned.</p><p>“The auspicious clouds are about to tremble again. We’ll use this opportunity to enter the clouds and search for the cloud paths,” Zhijian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>Everyone nodded. They were only a dozen miles from the auspicious clouds, a negligible distance for cultivators, but no one knew if the demons had left any sentries.  The cover of the fluctuating clouds should shield them from most prying eyes.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sea of clouds surged outwards in all directions, but it didn’t expand too far, as if encountering an invisible wall, and then began to contract. As the cloud qi shifted, the glow became blinding; an ordinary person would be struck blind with a single glance! The four felt as if they were standing before the sun itself, its light radiating for thousands of miles!</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren and Youhuang Zhenren each activated their concealment treasures, enveloping the group. Qin Sang and Guyun Zhenren suppressed their auras.</p><p>The four dashed out of the valley, moving swiftly through the vegetation. In the blink of an eye, they crossed the intervening plain and entered the domain of the auspicious clouds.  The glow within the clouds was even more intense.  They circulated their spiritual energy to protect their eyes, yet their vision remained severely limited.</p><p>Qin Sang was an exception.  He had dispatched his Heaven’s Eye Butterfly to scout ahead, and it hadn’t detected any other presence.</p><p>“I wonder if the disturbance in the auspicious clouds is a coincidence or caused by the demons.  We’ll wait a bit longer, until the cloud paths appear, before proceeding,” Zhijian Zhenren transmitted his voice.</p><p>The four nodded silently, following Zhijian Zhenren deeper into the auspicious clouds. They stopped shortly after, waiting in place.</p><p>Soon, the tremors subsided from the inside out, the glow gradually receding.  After waiting a while longer, a cloud path materialized directly before them.</p>
