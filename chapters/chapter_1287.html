Chapter 1279: On the Eve of the Great Battle

At the southern foothills of the Heavenly March Plateau lay Twin Mirror Mountain.  
Speed is of the essence in warfare. After the meeting at the Ice Crystal Palace, Qin Sang and Qing Jun led their army, marching day and night, straight toward the Sin Abyss's stronghold at Jade Finger Peak.  

The Sin Abyss had been advancing from south to north, always in an uphill offensive.  
The Two Realms Alliance, taking advantage of the terrain, had been resisting the enemy. If they were to counterattack, it would be like a tiger descending the mountain, making it difficult for the Sin Abyss to gain any geographical advantage.  
However, Twin Mirror Mountain was an exception.  

Twin Mirror Mountain was one of the most famous peaks on the first tier of the Heavenly March Plateau. Its towering summit even surpassed the height of the second tier, offering a commanding view and making it easy to defend but hard to attack.  
The mountain's north and south sides were relatively smooth, resembling two icy mirrors slanting into the ground—hence the name "Twin Mirror." Its perilous terrain was evident.  
The Sin Abyss had occupied this mountain for years, firmly planting a stronghold here like a sharp thorn deeply embedded in flesh, causing immense discomfort to the Two Realms Alliance.  
At any given time, at least one mid-stage Nascent Soul expert was stationed here. Now, with Cang Hong Zhenren sensing danger and adopting a defensive stance, Twin Mirror Mountain was teeming with elite forces.  

Their goal was to pull out this fang of the Sin Abyss!  
If they could force the Sin Abyss to retreat from Twin Mirror Mountain, they could pursue and exploit the opening to tear a gap in the enemy's formation.  
In addition to Qin Sang and Qing Jun, Zhenyi Daozhang had specifically arranged for the City Lord of Yin Mountain Pass, Jing Lin, Si Di, and other familiar Nascent Soul cultivators to join the expedition with a formidable force.  

Hundreds of miles outside Twin Mirror Mountain.  
Here stood a peak, serving as a forward outpost for the Sin Abyss.  
A fierce snowstorm raged.  
The mountain was blanketed in white snow, with howling winds—everything seemed normal.  
Unbeknownst to most, hidden within the mountain was a small, highly concealed spirit formation. Inside were ice huts, watchtowers, and vigilant guards.  
Strangely, atop the watchtower, alongside the cultivators, floated an eyeball the size of a human head.  
The eyeball hovered mid-air, spinning restlessly, exuding an eerie aura.  
The guards around it remained stern, not daring to relax for a moment.  

Suddenly, a faint ripple appeared in the void.  
Before the guards could detect anything unusual, the eyeball reacted with extreme alertness. Its pupil abruptly shifted, locking onto the direction of the disturbance, and let out a shrill screech.  
"Enemy attack!"  
The guards were alarmed.  
They reacted swiftly. The moment the eyeball moved, they simultaneously activated a spirit talisman, slapped it, and without looking back, dashed down the watchtower.  
The eyeball's pupil contracted sharply, emitting a blinding light.  
Just as a white beam was about to shoot out, cracks suddenly appeared in the void. With a deafening *boom*, the space shattered completely.  
Fragments of the void mixed with snowflakes and icy winds, forming a chaotic torrent that slammed into the watchtower. Within the chaos, a few strange lights flickered and vanished.  

*Boom!*  
"Ah!"  
The entire spirit formation, along with the watchtower and the eyeball, was obliterated in an instant, reduced to rubble. Faint screams echoed before being swallowed by the storm.  
The snowstorm continued unabated.  

The next moment, three figures materialized in the void, looking down at the devastation below.  
"I never expected Fellow Daoist Qin to possess such profound expertise in formations and restrictions, easily identifying the weak point of this defensive spirit formation!"  
A dignified, square-faced cultivator stroked his beard, lavishing praise on the man beside him.  
This was none other than the City Lord of Yin Mountain Pass.  
The other two were Qin Sang and Jing Lin.  

"You flatter me," Qin Sang replied calmly. "This spirit formation isn't some top-tier array. Its purpose is merely to buy time when under attack, allowing the watchtower to detect incoming enemies. It's not difficult to deal with."  
Senior Sister Qing Jun had granted him access to the Illusory Mist Sect's treasured archives, allowing him to study at will.  
Qin Sang's understanding of formations had reached new heights. With the aid of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, his ability to dismantle formations far surpassed that of his peers.  
The trio worked together, instantly dismantling the spirit formation and destroying everything in sight. The eyeball likely saw nothing but chaos before its demise.  

Jing Lin descended to the ground, waving his hand to clear the debris. To his surprise, he discovered a damaged small-scale teleportation array. The guards had perished before they could activate it.  
Qin Sang was slightly astonished. "The Sin Abyss is truly extravagant, deploying a teleportation array at a mere outpost."  
"The Sin Abyss places immense importance on Twin Mirror Mountain, no less than their strongholds at Stone Song Mountain and Eastward Watch City. They've fortified this place like an iron fortress."  
Jing Lin scanned the area but found no useful information. After erasing their traces, he took out a sword talisman to relay the message back to the main army.  
Then, the three of them continued their mission, eliminating other outposts.  

With the destruction of the first outpost, the Sin Abyss forces on Twin Mirror Mountain had already noticed something amiss.  
In the main hall of the stronghold, there was a miniature replica of Twin Mirror Mountain, similar to the one in Cang Hong's tent.  
The Nascent Soul cultivators gathered, watching as one watchtower after another dimmed at an alarming rate.  
Their expressions grew grave. The destruction of the watchtowers was one thing, but not a single one had managed to send back any information. They hadn't even caught a glimpse of the attackers.  
And there were no survivors.  

"Order all personnel, including those at the frontlines, to retreat to Twin Mirror Mountain. There's no need for pointless sacrifices."  
The one issuing the command was a purple-robed female cultivator, her tone leaving no room for argument. She was clearly a mid-stage Nascent Soul expert.  
Someone immediately went to carry out the order.  
A man beside her spoke gravely, "Only a handful in the Two Realms Alliance could pull off something like this. It's likely Zhenyi or Tongyou themselves. As Cang Hong predicted, the Two Realms Alliance has begun their counterattack."  
"Don't forget the two who severely injured Tianzheng and Elder Ye at Blood Lake. Elder Ye witnessed it himself—the one disguised as a demon king is also skilled in dismantling formations."  
Another person spoke, his brow furrowed as he looked outside the hall. "The enemy is coming with overwhelming force. Do they truly intend to conquer Twin Mirror Mountain? There's no news from the other strongholds. Who, or how many, are coming?"  
The purple-robed woman remained resolute. "No need to speculate. Cang Heng has already made arrangements. Our orders are to hold Twin Mirror Mountain. No matter who comes, they won't breach it anytime soon! Everyone, activate the grand formation and set up the Shadow Crystal Towers on the northern slope!"  
"Yes!"  
"Understood!"  

Meanwhile, Qin Sang and his companions breached another outpost, only to find it abandoned.  
The same was true for the subsequent outposts.  
The trio knew the Sin Abyss had retreated to Twin Mirror Mountain but continued diligently eliminating all outposts.  
"That's Twin Mirror Mountain," Jing Lin pointed at a distant, majestic white peak, his expression complex.  
Twin Mirror Mountain once hosted a bustling market. Before forming his Nascent Soul, Jing Lin had cultivated here for decades, leaving behind memories of joy and sorrow. Now, it had fallen into enemy hands.  
"Truly a strategic stronghold, second only to the two great tiers!"  
After some discussion, Qin Sang and the others decided against advancing recklessly. Ahead lay a Sin Abyss camp that wouldn't be so easily dismantled. They chose to wait for the main army.  
Before long, Qing Jun arrived with the main force. The great battle was about to begin!
