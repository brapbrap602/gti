<h1>Chapter 1191: The Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy</h1><p>Qin Sang had tried to study it himself but found no clues. Whether it was the restrictions on the treasure itself or the spiritual array runes, they were all unprecedented. Bai had been fully focused on refining the Soul Pearl, and it was unclear how long it would take for him to advance. There was no time to restore the Demon-Binding Rope.</p><p>Qing Jun took the Demon-Binding Rope and the jade slip containing the copied spiritual array. After examining them, she fell into a long silence, deep in thought as she pondered the array's patterns.</p><p>"In the ancient restricted area of the Purple Micro Palace, I obtained a fragment of an ancient scripture. Some of the runes in it are strikingly similar to this spiritual array. I've been studying the ancient scripture and have gained some insights. The runes in this copy are clear and visible. Given some time, I might be able to restore the array using this."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was overjoyed and without hesitation said, "Senior Sister, please take it. I hope you can fully comprehend it soon."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind whether the Demon-Binding Rope was under his control or his senior sister's. In his hands, the rope was practically useless, and with Bai's advancement still uncertain, it might take years. This treasure was only useful against ancient demons, and its utility was limited. Currently, the greatest threat came from the ancient demons possibly behind the Sin Abyss. Dealing with these demons was a shared goal between him and Senior Sister Qing Jun, so it didn't matter who wielded it. Moreover, Senior Sister's cultivation was higher than his, and she could wield it more effectively.</p><p>Earlier, Senior Sister had even given him the banner pole. The Demon-Sealing Stake and the Demon-Binding Rope shared the same origin, but the restrictions on the stake were far denser and more complex, clearly of a higher rank than the rope. Once Senior Sister restored the Demon-Binding Rope's array, he could use it as a reference to study the array that complemented the Demon-Sealing Stake. In the future, after Qin Sang refined all the Nine Nether Demon Flames, he could find a way to repair the Demon-Sealing Stake, giving him a similar treasure with even greater power. This was a win-win situation.</p><p>"You're quite generous," Qing Jun said, raising an eyebrow, but she didn't refuse. After all, restoring the Demon-Binding Rope would benefit them both.</p><p>After some thought, Qing Jun took out a jade slip and tossed it to Qin Sang. "You're trading an almost complete Demon-Binding Rope for a few broken banners? This contains a secret technique for breaking through bottlenecks, called the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy.'"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly took the jade slip. He understood Senior Sister Qing Jun's temperament. As she had once said, she pursued the path of immortality, acting solely based on her heart, viewing others as mere passersby in the mortal world. It sounded carefree, but truly achieving that was not easy. In dealing with matters and people, only by resolving all karmic ties and having a clear conscience could one remain unbound. How many in the entire cultivation world could truly be so carefree? Qin Sang admitted he couldn't.</p><p>The two of them were closer than others due to their connection with Senior Qing Zhu, but they weren't at the point of sharing everything. Moreover, the contents of the jade slip gave Qin Sang no reason to refuse. Any secret technique that could help break through bottlenecks was incredibly precious.</p><p>"A technique for breaking through bottlenecks? Is it useful even for Nascent Soul cultivators?" Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted, eager to use his divine sense to examine it immediately.</p><p>But Qing Jun added, "Don't rush. Let me warn you first. The 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy' can be cultivated by anyone below the Deity Transformation stage, but the demonic seal can only be used once in a lifetime. The technique carries immense risks and is easily exploited by others, even for Nascent Soul cultivators. The person who created this evil technique was undoubtedly a madman. Unless absolutely necessary, you must not cultivate it. Use it for reference only. I once mistakenly thought to use the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy' to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, but the aftermath of the technique plagued me for hundreds of years, nearly leading to my doom. It's only recently that I've truly resolved it..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Senior Sister Qing Jun, with her extraordinary talent, had struggled for hundreds of years to resolve the technique's aftermath. This showed just how dangerous the technique was. He dared not act recklessly and carefully put away the jade slip, listening as Qing Jun explained the details of the evil technique.</p><p>Afterward, they discussed a few more trivial matters. Qing Jun, eager to study the Demon-Binding Rope, didn't stay long and soon left.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the side hall and took out the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy,' carefully examining it. Not long after, he withdrew his divine sense, deep in thought.</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Jun's earlier words were not an exaggeration. The dangers of the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy' were terrifying, and the process of cultivating it was horrifying. The person who created this technique was undoubtedly a madman.</p><p>The process of cultivating the evil technique involved condensing the Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy. When breaking through, the demonic seal would form and then shatter, using the seal's power to forcibly break through the bottleneck. The horrifying part was that the so-called Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy was actually condensed from one's inner demons!</p><p>To cultivate the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy,' one had to meditate day and night on their greatest obsession, nurturing their inner demons and allowing them to grow. During this process, if one was not careful and was overtaken by their inner demons, their mind and soul would be utterly destroyed! The risks involved were self-evident.</p><p>Anyone who saw this evil technique would feel a chill run down their spine. Inner demons were one of the things cultivators feared most. Everyone tried their best to avoid the emergence of inner demons, yet someone dared to go against the grain, nurturing their inner demons to condense a demonic seal!</p><p>The most terrifying part was not just suppressing the inner demons' backlash to successfully cultivate the Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy. To successfully condense the seal, the cultivator had to fulfill their obsession. Otherwise, the inner demons would inevitably spiral out of control!</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why Senior Sister Qing Jun had behaved so strangely in the past. Her father had disappeared, and her mother had died of depression. From the beginning of her cultivation, she had carried a deep-seated hatred, with her only obsession being revenge. Her talent was exceptional, and her cultivation speed was fast, but reaching the Nascent Soul stage was not something one could achieve just by wanting it.</p><p>In desperation, Qing Jun cultivated the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy,' using her obsession to nurture her inner demons, hoping to personally kill Leng Yuntian. At that time, Leng Yuntian showed no signs of forming a Nascent Soul, and Qing Jun was confident that once she reached the late Golden Core stage, she could kill him. Then, she would condense the demonic seal, form her Nascent Soul, kill Leng Qian, and destroy the Yuan Shen Sect!</p><p>But fate is unpredictable. She never expected that Leng Qian, nearing the end of his life, would spare no effort to help Leng Yuntian form a Nascent Soul. Although Leng Yuntian's path to forming a Nascent Soul was unorthodox, and his strength was inferior to a normal Nascent Soul cultivator, he was still not someone a Golden Core cultivator could kill. This led to Qing Jun being unable to condense her demonic seal for a long time.</p><p>What stunned Qing Jun even more was that she didn't even need to use the 'Seal of Lifeless Demonic Energy'â€”she broke through the Nascent Soul bottleneck on her own. She had tried every method and made countless preparations, yet she still suffered greatly during the Nascent Soul inner demon tribulation. Even after surviving the Nascent Soul heavenly tribulation, the backlash from her inner demons did not disappear and became even more terrifying, nearly causing her to lose control of her mind.</p><p>In her desperation, Qing Jun had a sudden inspiration and used her most proficient puppet technique on herself, sealing her emotions and turning herself into an emotionless puppet. This allowed her to barely suppress her inner demons. While this method solved the immediate crisis, her cultivation was also sealed. Later, after becoming more skilled, she managed to partially unseal her cultivation, but it could only be maintained for a short time before she had to focus all her energy on suppressing her inner demons.</p><p>She could only use a fraction of her consciousness to inhabit a puppet, adopting the alias of Granny Jing, and traveled the world, searching for a way to either take revenge or resolve her inner demons. Later, after meeting Qin Sang, she finally killed Leng Yuntian in the Purple Micro Palace. But because the evil technique had affected her so deeply, it was only now that she had completely resolved the aftermath.</p><p>Qin Sang put away these thoughts and looked at the jade slip in his hand. Of course, he wasn't afraid of the backlash from inner demons. But...</p><p>"I don't have any inner demons!" Qin Sang lamented.</p>
