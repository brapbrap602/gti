<h1>Chapter 820: The Great Battle with the Spirit Body</h1><p>Qin Sang's primordial spirit wasn't afraid, but he didn't want to be touched by the sharp cones either.  He didn't know what other strange side effects they might have. This was his first encounter with such a powerful spirit body, so he was extremely cautious.</p><p>A strong wind assaulted him.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated, dodging repeatedly, finally unleashing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. The fire condensed into a ball, colliding with the cones, and both dissipated.</p><p>As the fire dispersed, the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner flapped, drawing out another stream of demon fire. Qin Sang darted into the banner's formation, waving his arm, shaping the fire before him into a black spear.</p><p>The woman was just then approaching.</p><p>Pointed at by the fiery spear, sensing the aura of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the woman abruptly stopped, staring fixedly at the black fire, a hint of fear on her face.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire inherently suppressed spirits, and the woman, a pure spirit body, instinctively felt fear.</p><p>Seeing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's effect, Qin Sang's face lit up. He forcefully jabbed a finger, causing the fire spear to spin, instantly transforming from stillness to motion, shooting out rapidly.</p><p>The woman, naturally, didn't dare let the spear pierce her. She abandoned the pursuit of Qin Sang, instantly shifting several meters, quickly dodging to avoid the spear.</p><p>Having gained the upper hand, Qin Sang relentlessly pressed his attack.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, unpredictable and ever-changing, morphed into various weapons—swords, spears, halberds, and more— relentlessly pursuing the woman.  But the woman was simply too fast and agile, making it difficult for Qin Sang to prevail.</p><p>Several times, the woman attempted to surprise attack Qin Sang, but she was always forced back by the demon fire.  Moreover, Qin Sang's speed was not inferior to hers. After repeatedly failing, she became incredibly enraged, letting out angry roars, her eyes bloodshot and ferocious, a terrifying sight.</p><p>She was far from her former delicate appearance, a vengeful ghost in all its fury.</p><p>However, while Qin Sang seemed to have the upper hand, he hadn't actually harmed the woman.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up towards the distant battle between the Nascent Souls; the intensity there was even more astonishing and fierce. This made him frown, wondering how much time he had left.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, Qin Sang saw another opportunity, immediately shouting, "Explode!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demon fire erupted suddenly.</p><p>The woman was half a beat too slow; her spirit body couldn't dodge in time, and was scorched by the demon fire, letting out a painful groan.  The impact sent her flying violently.</p><p>Unfortunately, she flew directly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was instantly on high alert.  The woman showed no signs of being in distress; using the momentum of the demon fire's explosion, her speed soared, rapidly closing the distance, a cruel smile on her face.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Facing Qin Sang, the woman opened her mouth and let out a scream.</p><p>This time, no sharp cones formed, but her scream created a wave of sound, as substantial as a physical force, overwhelming Qin Sang.</p><p>This shrill cry was extremely piercing, not an ordinary sound, but a terrifying attack in itself. Cultivators without defenses would suffer greatly:  a mild attack would cause their primordial spirits to tremble and their bodies to stiffen, while a severe one could shatter their souls on the spot, causing them to bleed from their seven orifices and die.</p><p>The woman had been waiting for this opportunity, and her strategy had worked.</p><p>Qin Sang was caught completely off guard, too late to dodge, and struck by the scream, he froze in place, falling into a daze.</p><p>"桀桀..."</p><p>The woman emitted a shrill, manic laugh, transforming into a terrifying demon, her scarlet tongue licking her fangs, her fingernails lengthening into claws; her bloodlust made her impatient to seize Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>But as she reached him, something seemed amiss. Qin Sang's eyes were clear, devoid of any confusion; he was looking at her coldly.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Sword light flashed, then split, several beams of sword light suddenly erupting.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang flicked his wrist, and the two-headed  *thing* leaped from the concentric rings; it had been prepared, its vertical pupils shooting out a storm.</p><p>The woman never expected that Qin Sang wouldn't fear this spirit-shattering scream—he had been feigning it, boldly luring her close to deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>In an instant, he unleashed the full extent of his swordsmanship.</p><p>Sword light crisscrossed, fast as lightning.</p><p>Wind blades within the storm were like knives, seemingly capable of shredding everything, their power equally formidable.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, several beams of sword light pierced through the woman.</p><p>A woman screamed.  A dark wood sword struck her ethereal form, cracking her spectral body.  A storm of wind blades followed, instantly engulfing her seemingly fragile being.</p><p>The scream stopped abruptly.</p><p>When the sword returned and the storm subsided, the woman had vanished, seemingly killed.</p><p>But Qin Sang showed no relief.  His gaze swept the area before he summoned the Nine Netherworld Flames, enveloping himself.  Then, he saw the woman reforming in the distance.</p><p>She was whole, the cracks from the sword gone, without a single injury.</p><p>Her expression was terrifying.  The woman, enraged that someone so seemingly weak could withstand, even harm her, seethed with hatred, wishing to devour his flesh and blood.</p><p>"An immortal body?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He knew spirits differed from cultivators; certain attacks were ineffective. But the spirits he'd encountered before, facing this level of assault, would have been either killed or grievously wounded, not unharmed.  High-level soul refinement was truly bizarre.</p><p>"Wait...no, her spirit body seems more transparent than before..."</p><p>Qin Sang observed the woman, noticing the difference.  He thought, *That's more normal. Otherwise, possessing such formidable power and an immortal body would be too terrifying.*</p><p>Even so, the woman was extremely troublesome.  The dark wood sword and other methods only weakened her ethereal form; the Nine Netherworld Flames could harm her, but she was wary of them, rarely falling victim.</p><p>The Yuan Ying battle in the distance seemed fierce, but if either side won, it would be in an instant.</p><p>Time was on the woman's side; he couldn't afford to keep fighting her.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang gave the woman a deep look, then turned and left.</p><p>The woman, consumed by hatred, wouldn't let him go, immediately pursuing him.</p><p>"Her speed has slowed..."</p><p>As Qin Sang fled, he sensed her behind him, making a discovery.</p><p>The earlier attacks weren't entirely ineffective; they had caused damage, though not outwardly visible.</p><p>He stopped running, turned, and unleashed the Netherworld Flames, attacking simultaneously with his twin-headed warhammer, unleashing a furious assault.</p><p>The woman feared the flames, but while dodging, she became less guarded against other attacks.  Weakened from her previous injuries, Qin Sang seized an opportunity.</p><p>This time he didn't shatter her body, but the dark wood sword successfully severed a large piece of her spirit.</p><p>Before Qin Sang's eyes, the woman rejoined the two pieces, fully restored, her expression mocking.</p><p>Facing her taunt, Qin Sang's expression was cold and hard.  Without a word, he immediately launched another attack with his magical tools, seemingly performing a series of futile actions.</p>
