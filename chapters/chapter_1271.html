<h1>Chapter 1263: Back and Forth</h1><p>Tian Zheng and Tong You’s figures vanished simultaneously.</p><p>Only a river of stars remained in the void, as if a section had been cut from the celestial river.</p><p>However, a shadow emerged at the center of the star river, starkly contrasting with the brilliant stars. The inky shadow spread outwards, devouring the stars.</p><p>Tong You is currently the top expert in Xiao Han Domain, second only to Zhen Yi in the Two Domains Alliance.</p><p>Tian Zheng has also been famous for a long time.  He, Ye Lao Mo, and another cultivator named Cang Hong are known as the three great masters of the Abyss of Sin, with Ye Lao Mo’s reputation being the most formidable. He is widely recognized as the number one expert in Bei Chen Realm, solely due to his blood demon avatar, which rivals his true form in power.</p><p>Tong You is counterattacking, but it will take time to break free from the Star River Chart.</p><p>However, Tian Zheng can't spare his attention to deal with Qin Sang, so he can only release a Starlight Warrior, which is better than nothing.</p><p>The Starlight Warrior is ten feet tall, its body sculpted like crystal, exceptionally strong, with sharp features and a blank expression.</p><p>Qin Sang has heard of Xing Heng Sect. The Starlight Warrior is their unique secret technique, meticulously crafted from starlight and moonlight, and once released, it becomes a Yuan Ying level warrior.</p><p>This is a type of talisman soldier his senior sister mentioned, similar to summoning a vast army from a handful of seeds.</p><p>The Starlight Warrior possesses immense strength and is, to a certain extent, an indestructible body, born with a fighting instinct.  One only needs to summon the talisman soldier; no further manipulation is needed, and there's no worry of backlash, making it the perfect aid in battle.</p><p>The only drawback is the high cost.  Years of preparation and considerable effort are needed to create one Starlight Warrior, and it can only be used once. Its talismanic power is depleted upon its destruction, making it impossible to recover; it must be recreated.</p><p>Therefore, Xing Heng Sect cultivators treat them as treasures and rarely use them.</p><p>To hinder Qin Sang, Tian Zheng didn't hesitate to unleash a Starlight Warrior.</p><p>Qin Sang only saw a flash of light before a Starlight Warrior stood in front of him, a giant fist of shimmering light hurtling towards him.</p><p>The warrior's body is composed of starlight, it’s unclear if it's real or an illusion, but the force of the blow is undeniable. The fist wind created a vortex in the void.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The starlight on the warrior's body shone brightly, converging before the fist, the vortex rapidly expanding. The surrounding blood mist had no resistance and was sucked into the vortex, creating a visible blood wave.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his body tense, but as the punch neared, his face showed no sign of nervousness, and his speed remained undiminished.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang growled.</p><p>After breaking the ancient seal, the demonic fire hadn't been retracted by Qin Sang; it continued to swirl around him, transforming into a black dragon that pounced forward.</p><p>Simultaneously, a tortoise shell shield appeared out of thin air, blocking Qin Sang.</p><p>Almost the moment the shield materialized, the Starlight Warrior's fist slammed into it, producing a sharp, piercing sound.</p><p>This was the shell of a Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle. Even with Qin Sang's simple refinement methods, it was a rare defensive treasure, withstanding the Starlight Warrior's punch without damage.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes were cold, his speed increased by a third. He charged towards the Starlight Warrior, his tortoise shell protecting him, reaching out to grab the warrior's fist with one hand, while punching the warrior's face with the other.</p><p>At the same time, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire enveloped the Starlight Warrior.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>Several muffled sounds echoed from within the demonic fire, shaking the void.</p><p>Tian Zheng couldn't help but glance over, his face full of surprise. This guy is actually engaging in close combat with the Starlight Warrior!</p><p>He then remembered that this person was a transformed beast, naturally possessing a strong physical body.  He’d been misled by previous rumors mentioning magic banners, spiritual swords, and sword formations—common methods used by cultivators—almost forgetting the person's true identity.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>A heart-wrenching roar came from within the demonic fire.</p><p>Following a loud ‘boom’, the demonic fire suddenly exploded, a burst of white light shooting back, vaguely revealing the outline of the Starlight Warrior.</p><p>Tian Zheng’s eyelids twitched. The Starlight Warrior was beaten to a pulp by Qin Sang in a single encounter, its form reverted with the help of the demonic fire, without even needing sword formations.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Starlight Warrior to hold off Qin Sang for long, but he hadn't expected it to be so weak.</p><p>Although the warrior had returned to its original form, it hadn't been destroyed. It could easily reform as long as its talismanic energy wasn't exhausted, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang broke through the blockade, seeing the blood demon avatar fighting two opponents at once.</p><p>The crimson moon-shaped blade spun rapidly, targeting Qing Jun's neck.  A bloody torrent erupted where it passed, seeming to tear at the very fabric of space—a truly terrifying display of power.</p><p>Qing Jun, close behind Ye Laomo's main body, was about to reach the blood pool when the blade attacked.  Without even glancing at it, she continued her advance, the Five-Faced Pagoda trembling slightly before appearing above the blade.</p><p>A humming sound echoed.  The pagoda's phantom reappeared.</p><p>The bloody light was indeed halted by the pagoda, but the blade was exceptional, continuing its assault, breaking through the suppression.  Though the pagoda failed to completely stop the blade, it bought Qing Jun the time she needed.  She leaped into the blood pool, slipping through a gap between two black ropes, disappearing into the bloody depths.  The Five-Faced Pagoda followed closely behind.</p><p>The blood demon's manifestation didn't pursue Qing Jun, only letting out a dismissive sneer.  If he could lose a one-on-one fight with his main body, he wouldn't deserve to be the top warrior of Bei Chen.</p><p>'Leeeeeet!'</p><p>Jing Yu let out a sharp cry.  She desired the treasure within the blood pool more than anyone present.  The Thunder Bead shone brightly, birthing a new phantom of the Thunder Falcon.  This phantom, however, was far more substantial than the previous one.</p><p>The phantom cried out, spread its wings, and charged towards the blood demon's manifestation.</p><p>Unwilling to confront it directly, the manifestation sidestepped, pausing momentarily while muttering incantations.  Countless crimson runes materialized around Jing Yu, swirling and twisting eerily.</p><p>Jing Yu felt her blood boil, as if about to be drawn away by the runes.  Remembering Qin Sang's warnings about Ye Laomo's methods, she knew she couldn't let him complete his ritual.  She unleashed her bloodline power, lightning crackling across her feathers.</p><p>'BOOM!'</p><p>A thunderclap erupted around Jing Yu, electric surges tearing through the runes.  She merged with one of the lightning bolts, rocketing towards the blood pool at an incredible speed.</p><p>The blood demon's manifestation frowned, surprised by Jing Yu's innate mastery of lightning-based escape.  Just then, Qing Jun emerged from the pool, whirling the crimson moon-shaped blade towards Jing Yu once more.</p><p>'CLANG!'</p><p>The blade struck empty air, the sound of metal clashing echoing out.  A flying sword materialized from thin air—Qin Sang, having just repelled the starlight warrior, quickly summoned his ebony sword to shield Jing Yu from the attack.</p><p>The interior of the blood pool was complex, and only Jing Yu knew the exact location of the Corpse Flower Blood Jade.</p><p>The pressure lifted from Jing Yu. Relieved, she plunged into the blood pool without looking back.</p>
