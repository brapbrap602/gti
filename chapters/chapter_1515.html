<h1></h1><p>The environment ahead caused Qin Sang to frown deeply.</p><p>Even before entering, standing on the mountain and observing the deep valley from a distance, Qin Sang felt a dangerous premonition.</p><p>The fluctuations of the Yang Soul Crystal were growing stronger, but it was unclear whether General Gui was engaged in combat with others or had encountered some danger within the deep valley.</p><p>From the outside, there were no signs of any Dharma treasures or divine abilities, making it impossible to judge.</p><p>Facing this horde of demons and monsters alone, or venturing into the unfamiliar Cloud Sea, either one alone wouldn't intimidate Qin Sang. But now, these two unfavorable situations were superimposed.</p><p>Any unexpected event could occur.</p><p>Qin Sang considered whether to wait for Tong Lingyu and the others to arrive before entering the deep valley together.</p><p>While contemplating, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the depths of the Cloud Sea.</p><p>The frequency of the flickering treasure light was too fast, causing waves in the Cloud Sea. It seemed as though it was about to break free of its restraints, ready to emerge at any moment.</p><p>Most likely, Demon Master Hun and the others had done something inside to create this phenomenon of treasure light.</p><p>It seemed that, unlike the Fragrant Pill Pavilion, this place was not merely for looking, but could also be interacted with.</p><p>With the gathering of demons and monsters, it was likely that this was the most central location of the entire stone stele space. By the time they entered, the demons and monsters, being closer to the water, would have already benefited from it.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang left Liuli behind, concealed his presence, and proceeded alone.</p><p>The jade steps descended straight down.</p><p>As he walked on the jade steps, Qin Sang noticed that the ancient restrictions on the surrounding mountain walls were much sparser than before, not as dangerous. Although it was called a deep valley, it was actually very vast, similar to a large open area between two mountains.</p><p>This was probably why the demons and monsters hadn't set up any obstacles.</p><p>It was possible to seal off a single path of jade steps with a formation.</p><p>But sealing off such a large area would consume too much time and energy, and it might not even be able to stop Profound Heaven Palace. The gains wouldn't be worth the losses.</p><p>Qin Sang simply stepped off the jade steps, clinging to the rock wall and slowly descending. He carefully observed the surrounding environment. He didn't find any hidden dangers, but he did find some traces of fighting.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang, concealed, landed before a beach of scattered stones.</p><p>Among the scattered stones, a patch of scorched marks was clearly visible. There were also three deep gouges, several *zhang* deep, that ran across the grassland, revealing the yellow soil beneath.</p><p>The marks were black.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could notice that these marks weren't caused by fire. The scattered stones seemed to have been corroded by an unknown force. With a light touch, they turned into black powder.</p><p>The three gouges were neatly arranged, sharp at both ends, and had been clawed out by a sharp talon. A broken feather remained at the edge.</p><p>"A demonic cultivator and a Demon King fought here. It wasn't intense; they exchanged only one blow before hastily stopping. It's also possible they fought while charging into the Cloud Sea..."</p><p>Qin Sang made his judgment.</p><p>There were other traces around, but he didn't find any left by Old Demon Hun.</p><p>At the very least, it indicated that the demons and monsters weren't harmonious among themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang sent a signal, waiting for Liuli to catch up.</p><p>Liuli knew even fewer demonic cultivators from the Boundless Sea than Qin Sang, and she also couldn't tell who had left these traces.</p><p>The two of them crossed the beach of scattered stones and soon arrived near the deep valley.</p><p>A faint wind blew out from the deep valley.</p><p>The clouds and mist seemed to be confined here by some force, forming a wall of clouds. The thin mist lightly touched their skin, and they felt a faint chill from it.</p><p>From the outside, although the deep valley was desolate, it was also peaceful and serene.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli discussed for a few moments, and then, one after the other, they stepped into the deep valley.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The moment they stepped into the deep valley, a thick fog rushed towards them.</p><p>However, the visibility inside wasn't as narrow as expected. Qin Sang, secretly on guard, quickly scanned his surroundings, and then his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Liuli entered, a ball of gray light appeared in front of them, followed by a *kaka* sound from the ground.</p><p>The gray light was extremely dense and dissipated in an instant.</p><p>Not far ahead, an iron sword had appeared on the ground, thrust upside down into the earth.</p><p>The iron sword was as tall as a person. There were no inscriptions on the blade; it was just an ordinary greatsword, its surface covered in rust, full of traces left by the passage of time.</p><p>And around the iron sword stood four statues.</p><p>The statues were of four demonic beasts they had never seen before, their heads facing the iron sword, as if they were guarding some sacred object. Their expressions were more like those of fierce beasts, their eyes extremely ferocious.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel a strong aura of ferocity and evil from the statues. They were definitely not benign creatures!</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he discovered that the material of the fierce beast statues was not wood or stone, but some kind of beast bone. The stark white beast bones further intensified this feeling.</p><p>Sensing the aura of intruders, the heads of the four fierce beasts all turned towards them, staring at them, their eyes filled with killing intent, about to awaken.</p><p>A sudden change occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly cried out that something was wrong. With a thought, the Golden Sinking Sword shot out.</p><p>The surroundings immediately became dim.</p><p>Qin Sang directly unleashed the Seven Slaughter Soul Formation, enveloping them.</p><p>Liuli also held the phoenix-shaped treasure sword in her hand, the faint blue light in her eyes accumulating. Seeing that the situation was not good, she would immediately unleash the Ice Soul Divine Light to help Qin Sang.</p><p>Although the two had not cooperated many times, they were quite in sync.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>As soon as the sword formation was formed, a gray shadow pounced over. Its speed was astonishing, surpassing even Qin Sang's Thunder Evasion. In an instant, it charged into the sword formation.</p><p>It was the fierce beast closest to them. This beast had four hooves, horns on its head, and its form resembled a deer.</p><p>What Qin Sang sensed was not demonic qi, but killing intent.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The sword threads in the sword formation moved in unison, forming a dense sword net in the dim space, attacking the fierce beast from all directions.</p><p>The fierce beast opened its large mouth, emitting a silent roar. The horns on its head suddenly lit up, and then it shot out a ball of white light.</p><p>The sword threads, upon contact with the white light, melted away like ice and snow meeting the scorching sun. The fierce beast ignored its surroundings and charged directly at Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>At the same time, three more gray shadows rushed in.</p><p>All four fierce beasts had been alarmed by them.</p><p>The divine abilities of the other three fierce beasts were different from the first one, and their speeds also varied.</p><p>One had a body like a python, and a sweep of its long tail produced a green light, its power no less than that of the white light.</p><p>One carried a turtle shell on its back, extremely hard.</p><p>The other one resembled a Qilin, its entire body blazing with flames.</p><p>Being surrounded by four fierce beasts, the situation looked very dangerous, but after a brief probe, Qin Sang relaxed.</p><p>The strength of the fierce beasts was within an acceptable range, and they had no intelligence.</p><p>He conveyed his discovery to Liuli through voice transmission, and then flicked his finger at the Golden Sinking Sword, urging the power of the Seven Slaughter Soul Formation to its limit.</p><p>Liuli concealed the Ice Soul Divine Light without releasing it, and with a wave of her jade hand.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped treasure sword vanished in a flash, swift as a meteor, directly piercing towards the brow of the first fierce beast.</p><p>The fierce beast's eyes only saw the intruders. It instinctively attacked its enemies, and in the face of danger, it would only clash head-on. The white light on its horns gathered, and it shot out a thick beam of light, colliding with the oncoming sword light.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The white light and the sword light collided, and radiant light scattered in all directions.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped treasure sword revealed its blade, trembling slightly, blocked by the white light.</p><p>At this moment, the sword threads above the fierce beast rapidly converged, and in the blink of an eye, they transformed into a gray blade. Aiming directly at the back of the fierce beast's neck, it lightly slashed down.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The fierce beast tried to gather the white light again, but it was too late. Its head was severed at the shoulder and fell to the ground. Its body still maintained its forward momentum.</p><p>The next moment, the fierce beast's head and body vanished into thin air, and a new statue appeared in front of the iron sword, crouching there, with no intention of rising to attack again.</p><p>"So they are immortal bodies. No wonder Demon Master Hun and the others didn't destroy the statues. Fortunately, they won't attack continuously..."</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. Just as he was about to join forces with Liuli to slay the other three fierce beasts, he suddenly sensed something. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he quickly transmitted his voice to Liuli.</p><p>At the same time, the formation of the sword array changed greatly, gathering the other three fierce beasts together.</p><p>Liuli was slightly startled, and the faint blue glow in her eyes suddenly intensified. The Ice Soul Divine Light swept out silently.</p><p>*Kaka...*</p><p>The power of the divine light simultaneously enveloped the three fierce beasts.</p><p>The three fierce beasts were instantly covered in a layer of ice armor, crystal clear, and they froze in place.</p><p>While Liuli restrained the three fierce beasts, Qin Sang suddenly withdrew the sword formation. His phoenix wings spread wide, and he transformed into a bolt of lightning. In the blink of an eye, he crossed the iron sword and rushed into the depths of the fog.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A yellow light flashed, followed by a muffled sound.</p><p>Two figures touched and instantly separated.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his figure, looked at a yellow weasel in front of him, and said in surprise, "Huang Mei?"</p><p>Just now, while he and Liuli were dealing with the fierce beasts, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly saw something strange in the depths of the clouds and mist. Qin Sang didn't hesitate to attack, intercepting this demon in time.</p><p>However, to his surprise, the person窥视was actually Demon King Huang Mei.</p><p>Demon King Huang Mei's cultivation was among the top ranks in the entire Demon Realm. He was not a vassal of the Great Sage Tian Peng, but merely gathered at Tian Peng Mountain temporarily to plunder the territories of the human race.</p><p>It was not his turn to personally stand guard.</p><p>Demon King Huang Mei's true form was a yellow weasel, small in size, with the features of a rat. Its tail was twice as long as its body, and its entire body was covered in yellow fur.</p><p>This was not his true body.</p><p>Demon King Huang Mei was born with a mouthful of Primordial Yellow Qi. During his cultivation, he constantly refined it. This yellow weasel was the manifestation of this Qi.</p><p>He left the yellow weasel behind, intending only to observe in the dark, to check the number and strength of the newcomers. He didn't expect Qin Sang to be so perceptive, being discovered after just one glance, and blocked here.</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the yellow weasel and also found it strange, not like Demon King Huang Mei.</p><p>However, it was a rare opportunity to encounter a lone yellow weasel, and it couldn't be missed. He had to capture it.</p><p>After entering for so long, Qin Sang was still in the dark.</p><p>How did Demon Master Hun and Tian Peng open the stone stele space?</p><p>How many treasures had they already plundered?</p><p>The yellow weasel's eyes darted around, and it turned its head, intending to escape from the side.</p><p>At the same time, the yellow weasel found that the surroundings suddenly darkened.</p><p>It had just witnessed Qin Sang unleashing the sword formation, and knew the power of the Seven Slaughter Soul Formation. Its eyes revealed fear, and it let out a shriek, its fur standing on end.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The next moment, the yellow weasel's figure vanished into thin air, like a yellow bolt of lightning, swiftly escaping the range of the sword formation.</p><p>"Your speed is not bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, pointed his fingers downward, still calmly unleashing the sword formation.</p><p>And in the direction the yellow weasel was escaping, a phantom silently appeared. It was the External Body Double.</p><p>The External Body Double, expressionless, came prepared. He held his palms flat, and cold energy condensed in front of him, forming an Eight Trigrams Mirror of congealed ice. The ice mirror suddenly shone brightly, just in time to block the yellow weasel.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A loud explosion.</p><p>The Eight Trigrams Mirror shattered on impact, but the yellow weasel also tumbled back in a sorry state.</p><p>Before the yellow weasel could clearly see the figure of the External Body Double, it felt itself撞上a hard wall. In shock, it wanted to escape again, but it had already fallen into the sword formation.</p><p>Having succeeded in one strike, the External Body Double didn't stay to help the main body, but instead turned back to help Liuli slay the fierce beasts.</p><p>Inside the sword formation, the yellow weasel was restlessly moving around.</p><p>"Answer a few of my questions, and I can spare your life."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke.</p><p>Soul searching Nascent Soul cultivators and Transformation Stage Demon Kings was very difficult. Most of the time, one could only obtain scattered fragments. This was also why Qin Sang had sealed Hall Master Yin's Nascent Soul but didn't immediately search his soul.</p><p>"Squeak squeak..."</p><p>The yellow weasel bared its fangs and claws, responding with a shriek.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, and tapped the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying power of the sword formation, the yellow weasel raised its head, and let out a sharp shriek, piercing and ear-splitting. Then, its figure flickered, splitting into countless phantoms, fleeing in all directions.</p><p>*Puff! Puff!*</p><p>These phantoms were immediately slain by the sword threads.</p><p>At the same time, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire quietly approached the yellow weasel.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword formation and the Demonic Fire struck simultaneously. Under the dual impact, the yellow weasel's expression indeed became dazed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally saw what was wrong with the yellow weasel.</p><p>"It's not its true body, nor does it seem like an incarnation. Strange!"</p><p>The bloodlines of the demon race were complex, and their innate divine abilities were varied. Each had its unique features. The yellow weasel transformed by the Innate Primordial Yellow Qi, in both aura and form, was enough to pass as the real thing.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The yellow weasel didn't offer any resistance. Its body was instantly smashed, turning into a wisp of yellow smoke and disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned tightly. He felt that it shouldn't be so simple. The yellow weasel had disappeared too quickly, too thoroughly. It wasn't normal. His divine sense quickly swept through the sword formation and its surroundings, but there was no abnormality.</p><p>Then, a cold smile suddenly appeared on his face.</p><p>The sword formation retracted, and the Golden Sinking Sword leaped out. The blade spun rapidly, aiming at a certain direction. Sword light erupted, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>Far away from the battlefield, the ground was uneven, and scattered stones were everywhere.</p><p>In an inconspicuous crack in the ground, a slender hair lay quietly there. It suddenly turned into a faint wisp of yellow smoke, quietly floating out of the crack, about to flee.</p><p>A beam of sword light descended from the sky, with the speed of lightning, firmly nailing it to the ground!</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The yellow smoke completely burst apart.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang's figure appeared above, looking down. With a wave of his hand, he recalled the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>The yellow weasel's death substitution technique was indeed profound, but it couldn't escape the eyes of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Eliminating the yellow weasel would alert Demon King Huang Mei inside, but it was also impossible to let the tiger return to the mountain.</p><p>Demon King Huang Mei had the yellow weasel guard beside the iron sword, which was very tricky. It would be difficult for latecomers to avoid it. Fortunately, the yellow weasel had been eliminated and couldn't transmit any messages back. Demon King Huang Mei should still be unaware of how many people had entered.</p><p>At this time, Liuli and the External Body Double had also slain the other three fierce beasts and caught up.</p><p>...</p><p>In the depths of the clouds and mist.</p><p>When the yellow smoke burst, Demon King Huang Mei's already sallow complexion turned pale. His body swayed slightly. He took a deep breath, turned to look behind him, his face full of killing intent.</p><p>His abnormal state attracted the attention of the Great Sage Tian Peng.</p><p>"My strand of Innate Primordial Yellow Qi was dispersed by someone!"</p><p>Demon King Huang Mei gnashed his teeth.</p><p>This severe injury would require at least several decades of arduous cultivation to recover.</p><p>The Great Sage Tian Peng's expression was grave. "The Iron Sword Beast Formation has been worn down by time, but it still has some power. It appears suddenly, and most people would be flustered for a while. You hid your Primordial Yellow Qi quite far away and made additional arrangements. Yet, you didn't even have a chance to retreat? It seems that Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu have finally arrived!"</p>
