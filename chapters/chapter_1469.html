<h1>Chapter 1461: The Power of a Spiritual Treasure (4k, Two Chapters Combined)</h1><p>Chapter 1461: The Power of a Spiritual Treasure (4k, Two Chapters Combined)</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's doubtful expression, Tong Lingyu explained, "The sea chart... there are rumors in the North Sea.  It's said the journey is extremely far, but even late Nascent Soul cultivators can use the chart to navigate the storm belt and reach Central State.  Daoist Friend is incredibly powerful, your perspective is no longer limited to the four regions of the North Sea, you see the storm belt as a mere cage. That's why you started searching for the sea chart, seeking the Dao beyond. Our Palace Master's aspiration for the Dao is no less than yours. If we had the sea chart, we would have already left."</p><p>She smiled, "If Xuan Tian Palace controlled the sea chart, there would be no need to hide it.  With top-tier experts like you visiting, we would certainly grant your request. The prerequisite, of course, is that you swear not to bring outer-realm experts to cause chaos in the North Sea. Your willingness to leave the North Sea, to pursue greater things, is in fact beneficial to Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>This was undeniably true.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace is a behemoth that dominates this region, the strongest force in the four regions of the North Sea.</p><p>If all the late-stage Transformation Stage demon saints and human cultivators leave the North Sea to travel, eliminating many potential threats, no one or no force would be able to threaten Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally understood this logic.</p><p>He had suspected that Gui Mu's infiltration of Xuan Tian Palace might not have solely been for the sea chart, or at least not purely for it.</p><p>"Where did this rumor originate?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>There’s no smoke without fire.</p><p>The Palace Master and Grand Elder of Xuan Tian Palace both heard the rumor, and Gui Mu obtained a sea chart from Jing Hai Sect, indicating that someone had traveled between Central State and the North Sea in the past.</p><p>"It's untraceable now," Tong Lingyu shook her head. "If Daoist Friend Qin receives good news in the future, please don't forget Xuan Tian Palace. We will handsomely reward you. If I am fortunate enough to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, I also wish to travel outside and see the world beyond the North Sea."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled softly.</p><p>If Xuan Tian Palace couldn't find it, what chance did he, an outsider, have?</p><p>At least, there were no rumors of a sea chart in the Bei Chen region.</p><p>Could he only start with Jing Hai Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, but because it involved Gui Mu, he didn't reveal anything about Jing Hai Sect to Tong Lingyu. He planned to investigate it himself later.</p><p>He had only recently broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, he had plenty of time, no need to rush.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Tong Lingyu tentatively said, "Daoist Friend Qin, we have shown our sincerity, may I…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his hand swept across his waist, and an ice box appeared in his palm.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's beautiful eyes lit up. She stared at the ice box for a long time, seeing that the seal was intact, she secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Earlier, when Liu Li drew power from the ice demon crystal, the seal wasn't damaged, and it looked unchanged from the outside. Only by opening the ice box would one know.</p><p>"Daoist Friend Tong has treated me with courtesy, Qin cannot be greedy."</p><p>Qin Sang held the ice box, allowing Tong Lingyu to carefully examine it. "After leaving your sect's treasury, I will immediately present this to you. However, I have one more small request…"</p><p>Tong Lingyu, who had already started smiling, saw a change in Qin Sang's tone, sensing that he wanted to add conditions, and her expression slightly darkened.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "I have long admired Xuan Tian Palace and Daoist Friend Tong. Today's opportunity is rare, and I would like to request instruction and witness the legendary spiritual treasure. What do you think, Daoist Friend Tong?"</p><p>His true goal was to experience the true power of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>He didn't know if the Demon Suppressing Stele of the Seven Killing Hall was a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Aside from the Demon Suppressing Stele, this was the first time Qin Sang had encountered a spiritual treasure since he began cultivation.</p><p>At Xu Ling Sect, Qin Sang had read some written descriptions in ancient texts, such as that spiritual treasures have no rank, and the power of different spiritual treasures varies greatly.</p><p>But nothing could compare to firsthand experience.</p><p>He had already made preparations on the island, even if Tong Lingyu had malicious intentions, he could escape at any time. As for his own means, the demonic fire had been exposed, he could fight without reservation.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Cultivators of this level wouldn't actively provoke unnecessary fights; they must have a purpose. It turned out to be for the spiritual treasure.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace had a spiritual treasure heritage, which wasn't a secret among top-tier experts.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Tong Lingyu said, "Daoist Friend Qin killed the Xuan Tian Palace traitor and helped us retrieve the sacred object; you are a friend of Xuan Tian Palace. However, accidents can happen, and if we were to spar and lose control, it would be regrettable.  Let's limit it to three moves, a symbolic exchange."</p><p>Qin Sang heard the implication, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This Grand Elder was worried that she would hurt him!</p><p>Was the power of a spiritual treasure really that strong?</p><p>If he hadn't demonstrated his extraordinary escape techniques, far exceeding that of a Grand Cultivator, Tong Lingyu probably wouldn't have agreed to these conditions so easily.</p><p>Qin Sang understood, he looked deeply at Tong Lingyu, even more curious about the spiritual treasure. He put the ice box away and said, "Good! I agree to Daoist Friend Tong's proposal!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu smiled and nodded, turning to Liu Li, "Liu Li, you will stand guard for both of us."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Liuli summoned her spiritual energy and flew to the outer perimeter, turning to look back.  Two top experts sparring, possibly involving magical artifacts – the chance to observe was a significant opportunity for her.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu exchanged a glance and simultaneously flew from the islet, hovering in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang, without hesitation, summoned her magic banner.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic flames erupted. A black fire dragon circled high above, then swooped down, weaving around Qin Sang, majestic and imposing.</p><p>Qin Sang stood within the demonic fire, her expression calm, prepared for battle.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's gaze was drawn to the demonic flames; sensing their power, her expression deepened, and she couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang again.</p><p>She hesitated.  Tong Lingyu didn't, as Qin Sang expected, produce a magic weapon or artifact. Instead, she clasped her hands, looked at Qin Sang, and began to chant.</p><p>As she moved, Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill, emanating from nowhere, washing over her. In an instant, it was everywhere.</p><p>"Not a magic weapon, but some kind of spell…"</p><p>Qin Sang recognized Tong Lingyu's technique, feeling a touch of disappointment, but remained vigilant, fully focused.</p><p>Three moves were the limit. Tong Lingyu's daring use of this spell indicated great confidence in its power.</p><p>Drawing on past experience, Qin Sang silently channeled the demonic fire, condensing a layer of fiery armor around herself, while commanding the fire dragon to contract.  She transformed into a ball of fire, waiting to see what would happen.</p><p>Tong Lingyu ignored Qin Sang's response, continuing her incantations, her hand seals changing rapidly.</p><p>At that moment, the battlefield transformed.  A cold wind howled, and intense cold descended.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively looked up.  Above her, a dark aura had appeared, like a dark cloud.  Within the darkness, icy tendrils swirled, forming a strange, magical seal.</p><p>The seal formed instantly, but the spell continued.  More seals rapidly coalesced; each depicted a different image, but all were undeniably related to ice and snow, quickly forming nine seals in total.</p><p>From a distance, Liuli watched intently, her eyes never leaving the Elder's movements.  She murmured, "Ninefold Glacial Prison!"</p><p>"Fall!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu let out a low shout. The nine seals combined, their chilling power capable of freezing the void, descended upon Qin Sang!</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, now a fire dragon, roared towards the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang would not passively endure Tong Lingyu's attack. Understanding the crux of this spell, she acted without delay.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Because this was a sparring match, neither dodged. The demonic fire and the seals collided without any fancy maneuvers, under the three women's watchful eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang unexpectedly discovered that the seals shattered on contact with the demonic flames.  Immediately afterward, she sensed something amiss, reacting swiftly, altering her incantation, and, unusually, forcibly recalling the demonic fire to surround herself.</p><p>The next moment, the cold intensified around Qin Sang, who was suddenly enveloped in ice and snow.  The patterns within the seals manifested in reality around Qin Sang. The nine seals combined, producing blizzards, icebergs, and other phenomena, yet under Tong Lingyu's control, the effect was limited to a radius of less than ten meters.  Qin Sang, within the seals, showed no reaction, seemingly powerless.</p><p>‘Condense!’</p><p>Tong Lingyu shouted again.  The power of the seals surged inwards.</p><p>Then, a tremendous energy burst forth from within.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A torrent of black flames erupted from the ice seals, rushing towards Tong Lingyu. The seals reformed, attempting a counterattack, but the demonic flames were unstoppable, barely affecting Qin Sang.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's face paled slightly. She retreated, dodging the attack, and looking at Qin Sang, who controlled the demonic fire, she sighed softly, "I've heard that the Listen to Snow Pavilion's Winter Rune and Elder Lan's Sun-Hiding Circle were both countered by Daoist Qin. It was because of this spiritual fire.  I never imagined this fire to be so extraordinary. Even the Ninefold Glacial Prison couldn't contain you."</p><p>Qin Sang retorted, "If Daoist Tong continues with such tactics, this sparring match will be won by me, Qin."</p><p>Tong Lingyu responded with a smile, "It's only sparring; what does victory or defeat matter?"</p><p>Despite her words, Tong Lingyu's eyes showed a newfound seriousness. She reached out, lightly patting her pouch; a white light shot out.</p><p>Within the light was a small seal. It appeared to be made of jade, unmarked on its base, but the seal knob was carved with four ancient divine serpents, vividly lifelike, their tails in each other's mouths, forming a continuous circle.</p><p>Seeing this seal, Qin Sang's eyes instantly became exceptionally grave.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't hide it, and Qin Sang naturally saw that this seal was far superior to any ordinary magic treasure!</p><p>"This is a spiritual treasure…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred slightly, his gaze fixed on the small seal.</p><p>The small seal spun rapidly, hovering in the void before Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Qin Sang and said gravely, "This is the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal, a spiritual treasure. Be careful, Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Before the words left her lips,</p><p>Tong Lingyu withdrew her gaze, focusing on the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal, silently chanting an incantation.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal trembled restlessly, emitting an invisible wave that caused the void to vibrate, flashing with a chilling light, like a pure, transparent flame of glacial ice.</p><p>Legend says the Teng Snake is a fire-elemental divine beast, but the snake on the seal was bathed in icy flames, seeming poised to come alive at any moment.</p><p>Unlike facing the Nine Restrictions of the Cold Nether, where he felt the chilling invasion, Qin Sang felt an ominous premonition, even stronger than before!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately activated the Fire Lotus, controlling his demonic fire to leave his body, reforming into a fire dragon before him.</p><p>At the same time, he noticed that the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal's physical form had disappeared. The icy light in the void transformed into countless icy flames, like a cold sun hanging high above.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange, eerie shriek echoed through the heavens.</p><p>The sound seemed to ring in Qin Sang's ears, like the scream of an ancient divine beast, transmitted across vast time to the present.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, icy flames surged from the cold sun, and a huge phantom shot out—a giant Teng Snake!</p><p>The Teng Snake was bathed in fire; its flame-formed eyes blazed with ferocious light, fixed intently on Qin Sang.  Icy flames formed wings as its long body undulated, rushing towards Qin Sang.</p><p>For a moment,</p><p>Qin Sang felt as though he were targeted by a true ancient凶兽 (fierce beast), his spirit instantly tightening.</p><p>The Teng Snake's speed was astonishing, traversing the void and hurtling toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately activated the Fire Lotus and sent the demonic fire dragon to meet it head-on.</p><p>The two fire beasts collided directly.  In an instant, the world grew dark, and the bodies of both beasts simultaneously crumbled and shattered!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The sky darkened, and monstrous waves crashed.</p><p>The two fire beasts fought desperately, churning the rivers and seas, ultimately perishing and returning to their most fundamental energies.</p><p>In the void, demonic flames and icy flames mingled, indistinguishable from each other, a scene of utter chaos. The two forces clashed continuously, their aftershocks lingering for a long time.</p><p>After a long while, sunlight finally penetrated the area.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu had quickly retreated to avoid the aftermath, their breaths somewhat ragged. They looked at the center of the battlefield with varying expressions.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, while Tong Lingyu's eyes showed considerable surprise.</p><p>Although the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal was powerful, its might wasn't as devastating as Qin Sang had imagined; it had been stopped so easily!</p><p>Qin Sang knew that using the eighteen demonic banners to control the demonic fire, though more powerful than top-grade magic treasures, couldn't compare to a spiritual treasure.  A spiritual treasure shouldn't have only this level of power.</p><p>The aftershocks gradually dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but look up at Tong Lingyu.</p><p>He saw that Tong Lingyu had somehow retrieved the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal, holding it with her fingertips.  With a look of admiration, she said, "Daoist Qin's demonic banners are extraordinarily powerful. You easily blocked one-tenth of the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal's power!"</p><p>"One-tenth?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded and sighed softly, "Daoist Qin, don't think one-tenth is too little.  Ordinary top-grade magic treasures would struggle greatly against even one-tenth of the Four-Headed Teng Seal's power."</p><p>Qin Sang found this unbelievable, staring fixedly at the spiritual treasure in her fingertips.  If one-tenth of its power was this formidable, if Tong Lingyu had used her full strength…</p><p>Tong Lingyu seemed to understand what Qin Sang was thinking and shook her head.  "Daoist Qin, you might have misunderstood. The power of a spiritual treasure is not something a Nascent Soul cultivator can fully control?"</p><p>She didn't hide anything, readily explaining, "There are two ways to wield a spiritual treasure. One is that the cultivator's spirit is extremely compatible with the treasure's, gaining its acceptance effortlessly. This is extremely rare. The second is to forcibly subdue the treasure—either through extremely high cultivation, forcing the treasure to submit, or by cultivating the Treasure Control Scripture to control it. Each spiritual treasure's Treasure Control Scripture is unique, created by the person who refined it. If that person didn't inscribe the Scripture into the treasure during refinement, even if an outsider obtains it, without the Scripture, they cannot use it. But regardless of the method, it demands much from the cultivator's level. With my current cultivation, I can only unleash less than two-tenths of the Four-Headed Teng Snake Seal's power."</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I hung up two IV bags, came back late, recovered quite well, and rushed out two chapters.</p>
