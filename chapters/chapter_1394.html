<h1>Chapter 1386: A Figure in the Snow</h1><p>Here, the wind and waves were almost ceaseless year-round.</p><p>Tall ancient trees were nowhere to be found on the island; even shrubs were rare.</p><p>Whether moss or algae, something covered the rocks, presenting a dark green, even a profound black hue. The entire island appeared dim and desolate.</p><p>There was nothing to indicate the island's peculiarity.</p><p>Qin Sang closely followed Bifang, flying toward the desolate island. He scanned it from afar but found no traces of spirit arrays or restrictions.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of treasure was hidden here.</p><p>"It's a good place to escape after snatching the treasure…"</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the surroundings of the desolate island, musing inwardly.</p><p>Based on past experience, this place was very close to the storm belt. As long as he entered the depths of the storm belt, his opponents, fearing getting lost, would certainly not dare to pursue him recklessly.</p><p>...</p><p>On the desolate island.</p><p>Venerable Feng could only scatter his divine sense , searching aimlessly.</p><p>The demon kings, however, easily pinpointed the hiding place of the Profound Heaven Palace traitor under the Rainbow Rat’s guidance.</p><p>*Swoosh!*</p><p>*Swoosh!*</p><p>The demon kings feigned disinterest in the desolate island to mislead the others. But, as Venerable Feng and the others grew suspicious and uncertain, their escape lights abruptly changed direction. With the speed of lightning, they swiftly darted toward the northern part of the desolate island, a rocky mountain area!</p><p>The rocky mountains were rugged, with exposed stones everywhere.</p><p>It was evident that these rocky mountains formed several mountain ranges, but their terrain was chaotic and difficult to discern.</p><p>Their target seemed to be a deep valley in the middle of the rocky mountains.</p><p>On both sides of the deep valley, countless jagged rocks jutted out from the stone walls, almost covering the valley entrance. The interior was pitch black, so dark that one couldn't see their own hand.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Venerable Feng realized that the Profound Heaven Palace traitor was hiding in the deep valley.</p><p>He snorted coldly with some annoyance. Earlier, he had searched that area with his divine sense, yet he had not detected the slightest abnormality. No wonder the Profound Heaven Palace traitor had managed to escape for so long; he certainly had some tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Venerable Feng didn't hesitate. With a flicker, his figure transformed into a wisp of green smoke, rushing toward the deep valley at an even faster speed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the demon kings in mid-air suddenly split their forces.</p><p>Frogfish  and Cunning Fox  remained on their original course, one in front and one behind.</p><p>Eagle Demon  and Green Snake Demon , however, reversed their escape lights, intending to stop Venerable Feng.</p><p>Just then, the Rainbow Rat leaped from the Eagle Demon's body, leaving the battlefield early.</p><p>It was still in a weak state and dared not participate in the fighting.</p><p>The battlefield was chaotic, and with the treasure about to be obtained, getting injured or killed now would not be worth it.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's round body was exceptionally agile. It landed lightly on the ground, its tiny, mung bean-sized eyes darting around. It glanced at the battlefield, twisted its body, and disappeared into a crack in the rocks.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>Facing the two demon kings blocking his path, Venerable Feng showed no fear. His angry roar was like thunder, exuding imposing dominance!</p><p>Seeing Venerable Feng so arrogant and overbearing, the Green Snake Demon felt displeased. It let out a crisp hum, gently swaying its slender waist, and its body suddenly swelled.</p><p>In an instant, the green snake transformed into a hundred-zhang  giant serpent. Its body, comparable to a flood dragon, cast a huge shadow on the ground. Its upper body rose high, its cold eyes looking down on Venerable Feng. Its vertical pupils suddenly shot out two sword-like beams of green light. Simultaneously, its tail lashed out, creating a hurricane that swept towards Venerable Feng.</p><p>The Eagle Demon's speed was not slow either.</p><p>Its wings spread wide, like dark clouds looming over the sky. Its claws were like hooks, gleaming with cold light, their sharpness surpassing even swords.</p><p>Without a doubt, being caught by these sharp claws would result in being torn open on the spot.</p><p>The two great demons were ferocious and worked together perfectly.</p><p>They joined forces to kill Venerable Feng!</p><p>Compared to them, Venerable Feng's figure seemed so frail.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Venerable Feng acted as if he didn't see the two demons' attacks. His figure was like smoke, his speed undiminished.</p><p>*Shua!*</p><p>The claws were as swift as lightning, easily tearing apart the green smoke.</p><p>The Eagle Demon was somewhat surprised to see its attack succeed. Just as a hint of joy flashed in its eyes, it suddenly froze.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>After passing through the gaps in the claws, the green smoke suddenly coalesced, leaving Venerable Feng unharmed!</p><p>But the danger was not yet over.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The snake's tail followed closely, directly plowing a deep trench into the ground, sending rocks flying.</p><p>The green smoke suddenly floated upwards.</p><p>At that moment, Venerable Feng not only brushed past the snake's tail, but a burst of green light erupted from his body. A faint shadow of an ancient mirror could be seen, actually reflecting the green snake's two beams of pupil light back at it.</p><p>The green snake hurriedly shook its head, its body crashing into a mountain, crushing countless rocks.</p><p>The mountain peak trembled.</p><p>A miserable cry was mixed in with the loud noise.</p><p>Even so, it still failed to completely dodge, and its cry was shrill. Blood was flowing from its eyes, indicating that it had clearly suffered a backlash.</p><p>However, this kind of attack could not harm the demon king's foundation.</p><p>The green snake immediately rallied and tried to stop Venerable Feng again, but it was too late.</p><p>All of this happened extremely quickly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Venerable Feng moved with rabbit-like agility, easily breaking through the two great demon kings' blockade. The skillfulness of his methods and the strangeness of his escape technique were astonishing.</p><p>The two demon kings exchanged glances, a single question arising in their hearts – what kind of escape technique was that?</p><p>It was a bit like wind escape , but it didn't seem entirely the same.</p><p>Wind escape and lightning escape were equally famous. While not as extremely swift as lightning escape, it excelled in flexibility and elusiveness. Venerable Feng's escape technique already possessed some of the essence of wind escape. Even if it wasn't true wind escape, it was still a top-grade divine ability .</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bifang arrived above the desolate island during their chase.</p><p>It was unknown how these demon kings communicated.</p><p>The Eagle and Snake Demons decisively abandoned Venerable Feng and joined forces to pounce on Island Master Shen and the other two, who were closely following Venerable Feng.</p><p>There were only two of them facing three Nascent Soul cultivators of the same realm, but they could still manage to block their opponents for a while. Not everyone possessed an odd escape technique like Venerable Feng.</p><p>Bifang, however, completely ignored this battlefield. Its fierce eyes locked onto Venerable Feng, transforming into a streak of blood-colored light, and swooped down!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, quickly stop it!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind, hearing Madam Yue’s urgent call in his ear.</p><p>Venerable Feng could toy with the Eagle and Snake Demons whose cultivation bases were lower than his, but facing his old rival Bifang, he could no longer get away so easily as before.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace traitor was seriously injured.</p><p>As long as Bifang entangled Venerable Feng for a moment, Frogfish and Cunning Fox could kill him and seize the treasure.</p><p>By then, it would be too late!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the deep valley and said coldly, "Fellow Daoist Yue, are you still not telling this poor daoist the truth?"</p><p>"It’s…"</p><p>Madam Yue was about to offer the prepared excuse.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>An abnormality suddenly occurred in the deep valley!</p><p>A cold wind surged out of the deep valley.</p><p>Snow drifted in the sky.</p><p>In an instant, bone-chilling coldness permeated the surrounding mountains, covering the dark mountain rocks with a thin layer of white frost.</p><p>Wind and snow howled.</p><p>A white-clad man flew out of the deep valley, appearing before everyone.</p><p>This man had handsome features and an extraordinary temperament. His cultivation base was undisguised, also a Nascent Soul stage cultivator.</p><p>His face was bloodlessly pale, his skin almost translucent, and his flesh seemed to be made of profound ice .</p><p>He clearly exuded weakness, appearing strong on the outside but hollow inside.</p><p>Strangely, in the perception of others, this person's aura was still powerful, not like someone who was seriously injured should be.</p>
