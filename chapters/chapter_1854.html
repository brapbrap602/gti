<h1>Chapter 1845: The Primordial Embryo</h1><p>Remaining in seclusion.</p><p>This might help avoid the coming storm.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had to consider that if the Imperial Court and Gui Fang Country were to clash within the Treatment Altar, shaking its structure, causing chaos in the illusory realms, or even destruction, whether his cave abode could still be secured.</p><p>Finding a new cave abode wasn't difficult, but moving the spirit flowers was.</p><p>Looking at the flower field below, Qin Sang sighed softly. Spirit flowers were delicate, and suitable flower fields were rare.</p><p>Moreover, moving the spirit flowers would inevitably damage their vital energy. Even with minimal damage and an immediately available flower field, it would take over a hundred years to recover. A slight mishap could cause the spirit flower's meridians to rupture, leading to immediate withering.</p><p>Without the spirit flowers, he couldn't produce flower dew, and the remaining juice from the poisonous fruit was far from enough to support his cultivation to the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His cultivation would be affected, so caution was necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, surveying the entire flower field space. His divine sense flashed, encompassing the entire formation.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, mobilizing his true essence and performing hand seals. Numerous transparent talismans appeared before him, flickering as they flew towards various nodes of the formation.</p><p>As the talismans continued to be cast, even with Qin Sang's cultivation, his breath grew rapid, the consumption immense.</p><p>The event was sudden, so Qin Sang could only do this, maximizing the formation's power, hoping to protect the flower field when disaster struck.</p><p>If the formation couldn't withstand the storm, Qin Sang would have no choice but to move the spirit flowers and relocate his cave abode.</p><p>After a flurry of activity, no visible changes were apparent, but within the space, the interconnected qi of the flower field felt significantly tighter.</p><p>Having completed this, Qin Sang stood up. A thought struck him, another matter requiring preparation.</p><p>As the saying goes, even a tree desires stillness, but the wind does not cease.</p><p>He didn't want to be drawn into the conflict, but he couldn't guarantee that calamity wouldn't befall him. There were countless strong cultivators in the Treatment Altar, and the other two factions were numerous and powerful, while he, as a third party, was the weakest.</p><p>If he were to be implicated, it would be difficult to explain himself and extricate himself.  He would have no choice but to fight!</p><p>His escape technique was unparalleled, but it was only for escaping, not enough for combat.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of another illusory realm, the forest domain that had helped him slay Lord Li years ago. That place was brimming with endless wood spirit energy. Within that forest, relying on his wood spirit body, he was almost invincible.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had found several illusory realms within the Treatment Altar containing wood spirit energy, but none compared to that place.</p><p>Even if the hidden powerhouses of the Imperial Court and Gui Fang Country were incredibly strong, they couldn't instantly kill him. As long as a stalemate ensued, Qin Sang feared no opponent.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang left the flower field space again.</p><p>He had long ago opened a path between his cave abode and the forest, passing through numerous illusory realms, quickly reaching the forest domain.</p><p>Entering the forest, the fresh wood spirit energy washed over him, making Qin Sang feel refreshed.</p><p>The traces of the old battle had been erased, the trees destroyed in the fighting had regrown, resulting in a lush and thriving scene.</p><p>If it weren't for its distance from the flower field, making it inconvenient to gather flower dew, Qin Sang would have considered establishing his cave abode there.</p><p>For him, the forest domain was undoubtedly the best battlefield; he didn't need to do much more.  Given the suddenness of the event, Qin Sang only made simple preparations.</p><p>Scanning the forest, Qin Sang nodded silently, not lingering long before setting off again.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang successively arrived at several illusory realms, all carefully selected battlefields rich in wood spirit energy.</p><p>During this busy period, Qin Sang occasionally looked up towards the depths of the Treatment Altar.</p><p>By this time, the strong cultivators from both sides had likely entered the Treatment Altar.  The Treatment Altar remained calm, but when Qin Sang thought of the armies outside, a sense of oppression lingered.</p><p>Do your best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>After recovering his cultivation, Qin Sang rarely felt this helpless. He sighed inwardly, leaving the last chosen illusory realm and returning to his cave abode.</p><p>Halfway there, Qin Sang sensed something, abruptly turning around. His eyes instantly transformed into a pair of golden pupils.</p><p>Golden light!</p><p>A familiar scene repeated itself.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the depths of the Treatment Altar. He saw golden light soaring into the sky, surging like a bursting dam, overflowing across countless illusory realms. Qin Sang's entire body was bathed in gold, like a golden statue.</p><p>The golden light showed no signs of stopping, passing over Qin Sang, continuing to spread.</p><p>In an instant, the entire Treatment Altar was likely awash in a golden ocean.</p><p>The golden light appeared so suddenly, originating from the depths of the Treatment Altar. By the time Qin Sang noticed, he could no longer pinpoint its source, only roughly determine a region.</p><p>"The source seems different from last time…"</p><p>Qin Sang vividly remembered the previous golden light eruption.  This thought flashed through his mind, and without hesitation, he immediately soared towards his cave abode.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang remained tense.  His strength had grown considerably, but the Treatment Grounds were filled with things capable of ending his life.  Those seemingly peaceful illusions could easily become death traps, triggered by the golden light.</p><p>The golden light erupted in an instant, then quickly began to fade, though far more slowly than its emergence.  Qin Sang didn't slow his pace, and as he flew, he noticed a difference.  This golden light outburst was as powerful as the last, but its effect on the illusions was far less pronounced.  He remembered the past, countless shifting illusions, rife with danger.  Now, most illusions remained unchanged; only the already unstable ones showed any disturbance, quickly settling again as the light subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't understand the significance of the difference between the two golden light bursts, but he returned to the flower field with his questions unanswered. He stood at the edge, carefully observing the flower spirits, then entered the hidden passage to check the poisonous fruit.  The fruit was noticeably shriveled, having lost much of its juice, but seemed unaffected by the golden light.  Exiting the passage, Qin Sang sat cross-legged outside the poison cave. If the main formation showed signs of weakening, he would destroy the hidden passage's array to retrieve the fruit.</p><p>The situation was unstable; Qin Sang had no time for cultivation, and kept watch on the area beyond the flower field, considering his own abilities and treasures.</p><p>After a while, a five-colored light appeared before him. The Five Elements Crown slowly rotated within it.  Since acquiring it, Qin Sang had been studying it, confirming his initial strategy was feasible: to guide the demonic spirit to consume and gradually gain its acceptance.  The absorption was extremely slow; forging it into a postnatal spiritual treasure was a distant prospect. Qin Sang didn't have high hopes, so he had other ideas.  Before the demonic spirit finished its consumption, could he use the treasure to fight?</p><p>After experimenting, Qin Sang discovered that his disguised self was gradually gaining the demonic spirit’s trust.  As long as he was careful and avoided alarming it, success was possible. The Five Elements Crown, which birthed a humanoid demonic spirit – a rare occurrence even outside of orthodox methods – surpassed the Yunyou Sword in power, despite the latter's status as a spiritual treasure.  Qin Sang stroked his chin, gazing at the Five Elements Crown, lost in thought.</p><p>...</p><p>Deep within the Treatment Grounds, Wan Zhenren and his group carefully navigated the illusions. When the golden light erupted, it was visible throughout the Grounds.  All cultivators and demon cultivators present stopped, gazing at the source of the golden light with varying expressions. Wan Zhenren and his group were no exception.  They needed no communication; their cooperation was seamless. The moment the change occurred, they altered their formation and remained vigilant.  Wan Zhenren and the old Daoist continuously observed the source of the golden light until it faded.</p><p>Having experienced the previous golden light phenomenon, Wan Zhenren quickly perceived the difference this time.  He led his fellow cultivators in a circuit around several nearby illusions to confirm his suspicions, then sent a voice transmission: "Senior Uncle, this golden light is weaker than last time. Could it be a trap?"</p><p>Before he finished, Wan Zhenren saw the old Daoist holding a jade talisman, eyes closed as if sensing something. Wan Zhenren immediately stopped speaking.  Without further instructions, Wan Zhenren ordered a continued search, instead of approaching the light's source.</p><p>After a while, the old Daoist slowly opened his eyes and said calmly, "No need to worry for now. This phenomenon is expected; it doesn't confirm the location of the Divine Court.  There will be others nearby going to check. Or it might be a demon's trick; we have similar preparations in place to confuse them. You'll see in a bit."</p><p>As the old Daoist predicted, a group of cultivators near the golden light's source immediately changed course and approached it.  Wan Zhenren responded affirmatively, questioning internally: If the golden light isn't a demon's fabrication... could the Divine Court have hidden entrances?  The old Daoist had told him of the Divine Court’s origins, but not its details or what to do upon finding it. Wan Zhenren had no clear image of the Divine Court, imagining it vast and boundless, or perhaps hidden inconspicuously; he even doubted its very existence.</p><p>At that moment, another group of cultivators were approaching the light's source.  This group consisted of five people: three men and two women, all in simple Daoist robes with their hair bound high.  The leader was a young woman, appearing no older than twenty. The others ranged in age, but all possessed a refined air.</p><p>The five cultivators weren't clustered together, maintaining a certain distance yet forming a surprisingly cohesive unit.  The young woman led the way, her eyes sharp, as if seeing through the illusions to the source of the golden light.  The closer they got, the more intense the golden light became, as if they were swimming in a sea of gold.  A white vapor rose, forming a jade tablet above the young woman's head.  The other four cultivators, with solemn expressions, summoned their protective treasures.</p><p>Observing its aura and momentum, the young female leader's jade tablet seemed to be of the highest rank, a spiritual treasure.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The jade tablet trembled slightly.  The group of immortals halted. A white streak shot forth from the tablet, countering the golden light.</p><p>The illusory scene around them was chaotic due to the golden light, but wherever the white streak passed, the chaos subsided, creating a safe path. The immortals seized the opportunity, speeding up, chasing after the streak.</p><p>"Master Yue, she should be just ahead. Be careful…"</p><p>An immortal behind called out a warning.</p><p>The young female leader nodded slightly. She wasn't from the Daoist court, but the head of the Jingquan Temple of Moon-Hare Mountain, located in Zhongmao Prefecture. She had been sent by her master to the altar, her master, the other female leader among the five, accompanying her.</p><p>The old head of Jingquan Temple, like the old Daoist, had suppressed their cultivation and infiltrated the altar.</p><p>The other three were also leaders of various temples and sects.</p><p>The Ten Directions Forest and the Daoist court shared a common fate. The Heavenly Court conflict was vital to the rise and fall of Daoism, so they had to act together.</p><p>Though knowing her master was protecting her from behind, the young female leader didn't dare relax, fearing she might fail and disgrace Jingquan Temple.</p><p>She lightly tapped with her jade finger, a talismanic image appeared in the void and merged into the jade tablet.  The tablet emitted a brilliant light, dividing into eight illusory tablet images.</p><p>The eight images arranged themselves according to the eight trigrams, their spiritual light connecting, as one, rotating and flying forward from the original.</p><p>The speed of the rotating images increased, forming a virtual Bagua compass in the void.  Wherever it passed, chaos ceased, and the golden light retreated.</p><p>The immortals' gazes sharpened.</p><p>Within the golden light, beyond the illusory scene, they perceived something extraordinary.  It wasn't immediately before them.  They hastened their pace, finally making out its shape.</p><p>It was about the size of a baby, egg-shaped, suspended in the void, rising and falling as if breathing, like a nascent primordial embryo.</p><p>Daoist legends speak of primordial embryos creating heaven and earth, giving birth to all things.</p><p>While this wasn't a true primordial embryo of heaven and earth, it was wondrous enough to captivate the immortals' attention.</p><p>The golden light was receding, flowing back into the embryo.</p><p>The embryo’s rise and fall accelerated, as if something was about to break free.</p><p>The immortals held their breath, checking their jade talismans.  The talismans' light also changed, its brightness alternating in sync with the embryo's rhythm, mirroring each other.</p><p>The jade talismans' response wasn't as pronounced as expected, yet no one dared conclude anything, fearing a missed opportunity.</p><p>After a quick exchange, the young female leader continued to clear the way with the illusory tablets, breaking through the final illusion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the immortals remained vigilant, guarding against any demonic ambush.</p><p>They quickly passed through the last illusion, revealing a vast expanse of auspicious clouds.</p><p>The embryo floated among the clouds, having doubled in size compared to before.</p><p>As soon as they emerged, the young leader quickly scanned the area around the embryo, her brows furrowing slightly.</p><p>No demons!</p><p>If demons had discovered the Heavenly Court, had they already entered?</p><p>At that moment, her master’s voice reached her ears, “Retreat!”</p><p>Without understanding the reason, trusting her master implicitly, she immediately retracted her foot and retreated.</p><p>The other immortals, seeing the leader’s action, retreated instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, the illusory tablets' power surged, becoming sharper, like spinning blades, striking the embryo.</p><p>Their trajectory was aimed at the embryo's center.</p><p>Just as the embryo was about to be split, it exploded with a 'bang', shattering into golden light that scattered in all directions.</p><p>The embryo was completely empty.</p><p>As the embryo disintegrated, chilling laughter echoed around the immortals, erratic yet omnipresent.</p><p>The surroundings darkened, murky waves surged, as if they had fallen into a polluted land.</p><p>The immortals' expressions changed, sensing the shift in the surrounding energy.  Unbeknownst to them, they had fallen into a trap!</p><p>A soft sigh.</p><p>The female leader from behind gracefully stepped forward, her jade hand gently stroking, accompanied by an incantation.</p><p>“Jade Morning Crown, Cloud-Wrapped, Mist-Clad.</p><p>Five Pollutions Vanish, Eight Scenes Illuminate.”</p><p>Water gurgled, a clear spring appeared from nowhere, wherever it flowed, the sky cleared, and the filth washed away.</p>
