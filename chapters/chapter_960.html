<h1>Chapter 952: Green Bamboo</h1><p>Silence reigned behind the door.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a Corpse Refinement, sending it ahead up the stone steps.</p><p>He and his avatar followed close behind.</p><p>The corpse's footsteps echoed in the long stairway, soon reaching the top and disappearing through the doorway.</p><p>Behind the door was another dilapidated hall.</p><p>Strangely, the hall had only this one entrance, with no other exits. Inside, there was a ruined formation.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the doorway, surveying the hall and the remnants of the formation.</p><p>“Looks like some kind of spirit gathering formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, recognizing some of its features.  The complete formation would have gathered spirit energy, and it seemed more sophisticated than any he had seen before.</p><p>After a thorough search, confirming there was nothing else and no sign of Senior Green Bamboo, Qin Sang moved to the other side of the hall, examining the walls.</p><p>There had to be another way out.</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword, channeling sword Qi and slashing at the stone wall.</p><p>The sword Qi vanished into the wall.</p><p>“Just as I thought.”</p><p>A look of joy flashed across Qin Sang’s face. He unleashed a flurry of sword Qi strikes, all absorbed by the stone wall. Soon, a door materialized, much like the one in the Purple Subtlety Palace.</p><p>The Corpse Refinement stepped through first.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang followed.</p><p>“This place…?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the surrounding scenery, astonishment etched on his face.</p><p>The exit of the ancient hall was also in a stone wall, but outside lay a desolate landscape.</p><p>The corpse stood atop the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered, and he too floated up, surveying the surroundings. His astonishment deepened.</p><p>He mentally labeled it the eighth level of the Celestial Tower.</p><p>This was a vast expanse, perhaps as large as the seventh level. However, this level had no towering peaks, only an open space with undulating hills, none particularly tall.</p><p>Surprisingly, this was the most intact space Qin Sang had encountered in the Celestial Tower.</p><p>The previous seven levels were all fragmented; even the mountains on the seventh level were shattered.  The eighth level, however, was perfectly preserved, the land and hills untouched by any conflict.</p><p>Yet, compared to the seventh level, this place felt incredibly oppressive.</p><p>The space was unusually dark. Heavy black clouds, formed of an unknown substance, hung low overhead, almost touching the mountaintops, creating a sense of suffocating pressure.</p><p>The earth and hills were completely bare, devoid of any greenery, not even withered plants. Everything was the same black as the clouds above.</p><p>Deathly silent and desolate.</p><p>The eighth level of the Celestial Tower was a truly dead place.</p><p>A sense of melancholy washed over Qin Sang.</p><p>“Could anything have survived in a place like this?”</p><p>He murmured, scanning the area. “Could the ancient teleportation formation be here?”</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only desolate blackness, the distant hills rising and falling, no sign of any man-made structures. Qin Sang knew he had to search on his own; Senior Green Bamboo had left no clues.</p><p>The good news was, the entire space was eerily quiet, with no sign of beasts.</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword, chose a direction, and began searching with his avatar for any signs of restrictions. This space was vast, and they had to act quickly.  Qin Sang chose a direction with a particularly high peak.</p><p>He soon reached the foot of the mountain, concealed his presence, and ascended towards the summit.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Reaching the top, Qin Sang surveyed the surroundings and finally spotted something unusual.</p><p>In one direction, at the very edge of his vision, was a straight black line, like a cliff, where the earth seemed to abruptly end. It was highly distinctive.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang flew down the mountain, deciding to investigate the cliff.</p><p>Crossing over the black hills, as he neared the cliff, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, his face filled with shock.</p><p>Bai's urgent warning echoed in his ear, "Careful! Someone's there!"</p><p>To Qin Sang’s horror, on a hill near the cliff stood a man!</p><p>Tall and slender, he stood straight as a pine tree, his hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the abyss. He stood motionless, radiating no discernible aura.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly, acting as a lookout, had failed to detect his presence.</p><p>The man seemed to have appeared out of thin air, like a phantom.</p><p>A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>The man slowly turned, his gaze sharp as a blade, instantly fixing on Qin Sang.  Qin Sang’s concealment techniques were useless against this gaze.</p><p>“Senior Green Bamboo!”</p><p>Seeing the man's face, Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically, and he cried out in surprise.</p><p>He had seen a portrait of Senior Green Bamboo at Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Legends of Green Bamboo were still recounted there.</p><p>His rage for a wronged woman, splitting Sword Sect Mountain with his blade, single-handedly storming the Yuan Mirage Sect, slaying a Golden Core cultivator with a single stroke…</p><p>Each tale stirred the blood, inspiring awe and admiration.</p><p>Although Mount Shaohua, mindful of the Yuan Mirage Sect's reputation, deliberately downplayed his existence, they couldn't suppress the fervor of his admirers, and portraits of Senior Green Bamboo continued to circulate among the disciples.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had unexpectedly encountered the man himself.</p><p>Senior Green Bamboo's whereabouts had always been a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially suspected he had found the ancient teleportation formation and returned to the Small Cold Realm. After finding Spirit Turtle Island, he learned that Senior Green Bamboo had been confronted by enemies, engaged in a fierce battle, and disappeared.</p><p>He had thought the chances of seeing Senior Green Bamboo again were slim, yet here he was.</p><p>But why was Senior Green Bamboo here?</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced.</p><p>Without a doubt, Senior Green Bamboo must have reached the Nascent Soul stage; otherwise, he couldn't have so easily evaded the Skyeye Butterfly's detection.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't know Senior Green Bamboo's true nature, whether he was truly as righteous as the legends claimed.  He felt a surge of caution, his entire body tensing.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>Standing in the darkness, Green Bamboo’s lips curled into a strange, almost sinister smile upon seeing Qin Sang, making Qin Sang’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Demonic Seed Embryo, another fool seeking death…”</p><p>Green Bamboo sneered, his voice reaching Qin Sang's ears with an unnerving coldness that chilled him to the bone. “An unexpected harvest. It seems you are his chosen successor?”</p><p>“No! You're not…”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>This man wore Senior Green Bamboo’s face, yet referred to Green Bamboo as ‘him’.</p><p>His tone suggested familiarity with both Green Bamboo and the Demonic Seed Embryo technique.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively glanced at his avatar, then his body trembled.  Three-colored light flashed, and his true body retreated sharply, choosing without hesitation to flee.</p><p>At the same time, his avatar charged towards Green Bamboo, blood sword in hand, moving in the opposite direction.</p><p>Seeing this, Green Bamboo’s eyes flashed with disdain, his sinister smile widening as if watching a desperate struggle for survival.</p>
