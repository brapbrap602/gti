<h1>Chapter 1549: A House Call</h1><p>Chapter 1549: A House Call</p><p>Time flies.</p><p>Fifty years have passed in a blink.</p><p>Within the Qingxu Illusionary Realm, a certain area remained perpetually shrouded in mist.  Only Qin Sang's avatar entered every ten years or so; no one else dared approach.</p><p>Even Xie Qian and Xie An, along with other Xie family disciples, though curious about this mysterious place, only dared to steal a glance while training in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm. They never dared to trespass, instead following the forest paths to the wooden buildings prepared for them.</p><p>Undisturbed cultivation allowed for steady progress in the main body's cultivation.</p><p>From advancing to the mid-Yuan Ying stage to this current seclusion, excluding the thirty-seven years spent in the Storm Belt, Qin Sang spent decades diligently cultivating whenever possible.  However, various matters often distracted him, hindering significant progress.</p><p>The benefits from refining the Buddhist relic were evident compared to before.</p><p>The long journey to Zhongzhou was undeniably worthwhile.</p><p>During his seclusion, Qin Sang encountered few major setbacks lasting decades. Even when facing bottlenecks, patience and contemplation, or temporarily switching to cultivate the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" to shift his mindset, always led to breakthroughs.</p><p>Without any unforeseen circumstances, in another thirty or forty years, his cultivation should reach the peak of the mid-Yuan Ying stage, allowing him to prepare for the next breakthrough.</p><p>This was thanks to the seven sword talismans of his natal spirit sword and the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>In total, the actual time spent in quiet cultivation was only about a hundred years. Even a naturally gifted cultivator with a Heaven Spirit Root needed similar opportunities, like the Buddhist relic's empowerment, otherwise, being stuck at a bottleneck for over a hundred years was common.</p><p>The Yuan Ying late-stage bottleneck likely won't be as easily overcome.</p><p>But Qin Sang was confident!</p><p>He wondered if he could break through to the late Yuan Ying stage before his first Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>In the entire cultivation world, only unparalleled geniuses could achieve this.</p><p>The fat silkworm and the mute woman cultivating alongside his main body showed little change.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found the optimal method for cultivating his natal insect, the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly. Thus, he couldn't help the silkworm, only managing to feed it a Wanling Fruit.</p><p>He planned to take the silkworm on future travels to allow it to find food itself.</p><p>After the fat silkworm's fourth transformation, the mute woman's condition noticeably improved, though awakening remained distant.</p><p>The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly also improved, but not as quickly as its master.</p><p>Qin Sang combined his knowledge of the Wu tribe's blood-feeding technique with insect-controlling secrets gathered in the North Sea, along with Zhongzhou cultivation secrets acquired through his avatar over the years, creating a unique cultivation method.</p><p>The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation sped up, but still couldn't compare to the Wu tribe's methods.</p><p>The main body was in seclusion.</p><p>The avatar was active in the open.</p><p>Qingfeng Daochang, the title of the Xie family ancestor, gradually became known by various forces in Zhuozhou.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang's duel with Cheng Huanzi, using only swordsmanship, was a resounding victory.</p><p>In the initial years, this news spread widely.  Many wondered about the abilities of Qingfeng Daochang, a friend of Qin Sang, eagerly anticipating a conflict between the Xie family and the Liuhxu Sect.</p><p>To everyone's disappointment, both sides remained restrained.</p><p>Xie family disciples only operated within Fudou County, seemingly forgetting the half of Hongping County they won in their gambling match, which remained under the control of the Liuhxu Sect.</p><p>Initially highly vigilant, the Liuhxu Sect, seeing the Xie family focus solely on Fudou County without overt ambition, refrained from targeting them.</p><p>Both sides coexisted peacefully, allowing the Xie family to develop steadily – the precise outcome Qin Sang desired.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't occupy the Xie family's cave dwelling without recompense.</p><p>The avatar, as the Xie family ancestor, was responsible.</p><p>He not only personally healed Xie An's injuries but also periodically held lectures for the Xie family.  The teachings were simple but exactly what the Xie family disciples needed.</p><p>Currently, a talented Xie family descendant successfully formed a Golden Core, though a Yuan Ying breakthrough remained distant, requiring Qin Sang's continued involvement.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang lectured, Zhou Jin would also attend with his family.</p><p>Using the pill recipes Qin Sang provided, Zhou Jin successfully treated Ruan Yu's chronic illness, dramatically improving her cultivation.</p><p>Zhou Jin was deeply grateful and considered himself a registered disciple of Qin Sang; the Loutai Pavilion and the Xie family developed close ties.</p><p>Having these two forces was sufficient.</p><p>Recognizing his shallow foundation as a newcomer, Qin Sang knew establishing a sect wasn't a quick process. He prioritized his own cultivation over widely accepting disciples in the Central Plains.</p><p>The progress on the *Ice Soul Divine Light* technique was unsatisfactory, and the avatar devoted most of its time to the *Universal Treasure Manual*.</p><p>The *Universal Treasure Manual* progressed smoothly.  Having cultivated it to a certain level, the avatar could now manipulate the Four-Headed Serpent Seal in combat.  Because it was a complete copy of the *Universal Treasure Manual*, although not as perfectly suited as the Glass Treasure, its power surpassed what it had been under Tong Lingyu's control.  The *Universal Treasure Manual* allowed control over spiritual treasures without the risk of being drained dry like with the Solar God Tree; its flexibility made it more convenient to use.</p><p>Aside from cultivation, Qin Sang didn't forget the purpose of his trip to the Central Plains.  The avatar didn't stay solely within the Qingxu Illusionary Realm; it would occasionally leave, making acquaintances with other cultivators and even personally visiting Mount Bulong to meet Lu Zhang, experiencing the grandeur of a top Central Plains sect.  Through Lu Zhang's introduction, the avatar met several Nascent Soul cultivators from Mount Bulong.</p><p>Furthermore, the avatar proactively contacted several top trading houses, including the Six States Hall, commissioning them to investigate information about Gui Mu.  Many cultivators in the Central Plains were nicknamed "Ghost Mother," but none were the one Qin Sang sought.</p><p>This was unexpected.  Logically, Gui Mu had recently arrived in the Central Plains and had no grievances with its powers; there was no need for her to conceal her identity.  If she were active, she would surely leave traces.</p><p>Qin Sang even began to suspect that Gui Mu might have encountered a ferocious beast attack while passing through the storm belt, suffering serious injury or even perishing.  More optimistically, perhaps she was recovering somewhere.</p><p>Unable to locate Gui Mu, Qin Sang couldn't wait indefinitely. After careful consideration, he selected some information Gui Mu would be interested in and spread it, hoping she would follow the trail.</p><p>After being rescued from the water prison by Tan Hao, Gui Mu hadn't reneged on her promise. Though she hadn't been able to save Tan Jie, she had tried her best and helped Tan Hao achieve a Nascent Soul cultivation opportunity; she wasn't entirely malicious.</p><p>Unless Gui Mu had already advanced to the Divine Transformation stage, Qin Sang and his avatar, wielding two spiritual treasures, wouldn't fear her turning against them.</p><p>As for the Heavenly Harmony Palace and the Heavenly Aspect Palace, there was similarly no progress.  After seeing Lu Zhang's ignorance, Qin Sang had a premonition that these two celestial palaces held unusual secrets in the Central Plains; otherwise, why would they be sealed so tightly?</p><p>In subsequent investigations, Qin Sang proceeded cautiously and methodically, avoiding revealing his purpose.  He would wait until his main body left seclusion and advanced to the late Nascent Soul stage before launching a large-scale investigation.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar was also in seclusion.  With the *Ice Soul Divine Light* unmastered, the avatar only had spiritual treasures as a last resort, and its usual combat methods were insufficient. Qin Sang planned to further improve the avatar's cultivation before considering traveling.</p><p>The morning sun shone brightly on Mount Pu, a scene of vibrant life. Xie family disciples either soared among the clouds or stood on the mountain peaks, basking in the sunrise and absorbing the purple qi.  It was Xie Qian's turn to handle external affairs.</p><p>Looking at these energetic younger generations, Xie Qian unconsciously showed an expectant smile, anticipating the future of the Xie family.  He was nearing the end of his life.  Despite cultivating in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm and receiving Qin Sang's guidance, his cultivation had progressed, but his lifespan limited his chances of forming a Nascent Soul.</p><p>Seeing the Xie family's revival in his lifetime, Xie Qian felt content, believing he had lived a fulfilling life and hadn't disgraced his Xie family ancestors.  Thinking this, he couldn't help but glance at the Xie family stone.</p><p>Everything now was a gift from that person!  Was this person really a Xie family ancestor? Xie Qian had no doubts about this; he simply didn't think about it.</p><p>Just as he was about to return to the hall, Xie Qian noticed a mass of cloud, orange-red under the rising sun, drifting towards Mount Pu.  The sky was clear, the clouds thin.  Only this cloud mass remained dense and fast-moving.</p><p>Xie Qian stared intently, realizing that the cloud was actually white, and thinking of someone, immediately removed the relaxed expression from his face, mobilized his true essence, and his voice spread across Mount Pu: "Everyone, return to your caves immediately.  No one is permitted to go outside without permission!"</p><p>The Xie family disciples were in an uproar, but dared not disobey their ancestor's orders.  In an instant, the mountain was empty. Xie Qian cast an invisibility spell and hurriedly retreated into the Qingxu Illusionary Realm to report, "Ancestor, Elder Lu of Mount Bulong is visiting."</p><p>Outside Mount Pu.</p><p>Two figures stood side-by-side on a white cloud.</p><p>One was Lu Zhang.</p><p>The other was a monk in a kasaya.  The monk was handsome, with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and large ears, quite resembling a Buddha statue; he looked only in his twenties, but the aura he emanated was extremely strong, not inferior to Lu Zhang's.  Standing on the cloud, the monk closed his eyes slightly, his single hand holding a string of prayer beads, murmuring something, whether chanting sutras or doing something else.</p><p>Lu Zhang remained silent, not disturbing the monk, until they reached Mount Pu.  He pointed and said, "Master Xiaoxing, that's Mount Pu ahead."</p><p>Master Xiaoxing paused, lowered his hand, and gazed at the mountain, a hint of doubt in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Zhang noticed, smiled slightly, and said cryptically, "Master, are you also deceived by appearances?"</p><p>"Amitabha," Master Xiaoxing chanted. "A mountain's height is not its importance.  There must be something special within the mountain to hold onto Friend Qingfeng."</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded. "Master, rest assured. Friend Qingfeng's cultivation is comparable to ours, and Friend Qin is extraordinary, unmatched by peers of his level. He's certainly of great background.  Finding them is definitely right.  Look, Daoist Qingfeng already knows of our visit…"</p><p>Before he finished, the protective formation's glow parted, and a figure emerged from the mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang called out, "Friend Qingfeng, we've come uninvited.  We hope we haven't disturbed your seclusion?"</p><p>"Daoist Lu, where is such a thing…"</p><p>Qin Sang, already familiar with Lu Zhang, shook his head with a laugh, having already noticed the monk beside him. "This high monk is…?"</p><p>"My Dharma name is Xiaoxing."</p><p>Master Xiaoxing stepped forward. "Greetings, Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>"Are you Master Xiaoxing of the Ganlu Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled, secretly awed.</p><p>Having spent many years in Central China, Qin Sang was well-informed about the major powers. He was certainly familiar with the Ganlu Temple.  After all, the Ganlu Temple had a Nascent Soul cultivator, the Holy One Huiguang!</p><p>The Ganlu Temple was located in the six states of Jiangzuo, the wealthiest region in the land. In Jiangzuo, there was also a Daoist sect comparable to the Ganlu Temple, the Eight Views Sect, which Qin Sang had encountered in the Storm Belt. The True Monarch Danyou, its leader, was on par with Holy One Huiguang.</p><p>Qin Sang sought opportunities to advance to the Nascent Soul stage and explore the secrets beyond the Storm Belt, and he would inevitably interact with them. However, he didn't expect the Ganlu Temple to visit him first.</p><p>He had little connection with Ganlu Temple. This wasn't about seeking justice for the Zhu Lan Temple, was it?</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang sought Lu Zhang's opinion but received no hint.  His smile remained unchanged. "Your visit truly honors our humble abode. Please, come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang led them into the main hall and they all took their seats.</p><p>"Daoist friend, don't worry. I introduced Master Xiaoxing to you; I wish to ask you a few questions," Lu Zhang explained, bowing slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Oh? I wonder what I can help the Master with?"</p><p>He also observed the two men.</p><p>He hadn't heard of any connection between Mount Bunan and the Ganlu Temple. They may have personal connections.</p><p>Master Xiaoxing and Lu Zhang exchanged glances. "May I ask, Daoist Qingfeng and Friend Qin, where did you cultivate in the East Sea before?"</p><p>*How should I know?* Qin Sang thought resentfully.</p><p>His origins were entirely fabricated.</p><p>"My previous abode was on Qingyang Island. As for Friend Qin, I cannot disclose his information without his permission," Qin Sang didn't lie.</p><p>But he wondered if Qingyang Island existed in Central China.</p><p>Master Xiaoxing twirled his prayer beads, seeming to recall something. After a moment, he shook his head at Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang asked, "Most of the immortal mountains in the East Sea are near the coast. The further out you go, the more sparse the islands become.  Beasts roam, and few people go there. Even Nascent Soul cultivators rarely venture there. Was Daoist Qingfeng's Qingyang Island in the outer sea?"</p><p>Having prepared beforehand, Qin Sang answered fluently, "To be honest with you both, when my cultivation was low, I was forced to flee from an enemy and luckily landed on Qingyang Island. I was taken in by a senior there and able to survive. The island isn't deep in the sea, but it's not near the coast either. It's rather unsafe around there, making it hard to find friends."</p><p>"That's it!"</p><p>Lu Zhang clapped his hands and laughed, turning to Master Xiaoxing. "Master, no need to bother. If he comes from the outer sea, Daoist Qingfeng should know about him."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  "Are you two looking for someone?"</p><p>Master Xiaoxing stopped being coy. "Correct. This person's origins are unknown, and we suspect he might be from the East Sea. However, although the Temple has some disciples traveling in the East Sea, few venture into the outer sea. Thanks to Daoist Lu's guidance, we came to ask Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>From the tones of Master Xiaoxing and Lu Zhang, the person they were looking for had offended not only Master Xiaoxing but the entire Ganlu Temple.</p><p>The top powers in Central China, with their experts searching far and wide, hunting for a single person.</p><p>This scenario… seemed oddly familiar.</p><p>A name instantly flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p>
