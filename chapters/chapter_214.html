<h1>Chapter 207: The Secret Passage</h1><p>Chapter 207: The Secret Passage</p><p>There must have been hundreds of thousands of Cloud Beasts hovering above the chasm, and there were definitely more inside. If they were to be startled…</p><p>Everyone felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>“There’s a secret passage up ahead. The entrance to the ore deposit is below. Once we’re inside the deposit, things will take a turn for the better. This stretch of the secret passage is the most dangerous part. Everyone must be extremely cautious, and absolutely no one is to act on their own, or expose themselves. Otherwise, I won’t hesitate to throw you down!”</p><p>Yin Xingge icily glared at everyone, his eyes filled with stern warning.</p><p>Everyone’s expressions grew solemn. No one dared to risk their life with frivolity.</p><p>The secret passage was on the cliff wall of the great chasm. Going down from there would practically have them brushing against the Cloud Beast colony. If they were to entrust the Star Disk’s manipulation only to Qin Sang and the other two like last time, they wouldn't be able to fully ignite the Star Disk’s strength, and would certainly be detected by the Cloud Beasts.</p><p>The ten people sent their spiritual energy into the Star Disk at the same time. The Star Disk suddenly opened, emitting a dark light that enveloped everyone. Once the Star Disk had stabilized, everyone disappeared from their spot along with the Star Disk.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Yin Xingge led the way, and everyone followed closely behind.</p><p>They were getting closer and closer to the great chasm, and they could even see the feathers on the Cloud Beasts with their naked eyes.</p><p>These Cloud Beasts looked extremely similar to a demonic beast called the Cloudsoar Eagle, except that their beaks and claws were much more formidable than the Cloudsoar Eagle’s. Their size was twice as large as the Cloudsoar Eagle’s, and the feathers on them were even blacker, as if they were pieces of iron-black feathers.</p><p>The biggest difference lay in their eyes, which were as pitch-black as their feathers, and their eyes didn’t have any of the vitality that living beings usually possessed. There might have been a hint of a wild beast’s instinct, but it had been drowned out by their violent and murderous auras.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he had read previously, and realized that these Cloud Beasts were actually descendants of the Cloudsoar Eagle that had been contaminated by a Cloud Beast Core. Over countless years of evolution, aside from their similar appearances to the Cloudsoar Eagle, they no longer shared any similarities with them.</p><p>These Cloud Beasts that closely resembled the Cloudsoar Eagle possessed a strength equivalent to the Qi Refining Stage. And this was merely at the uppermost level of the great chasm. It had been said that there were even beings comparable to those of the Core Formation Stage in the depths of the chasm.</p><p>The secret passage was on the cliff face of the great chasm. Everyone knew its location and found it easily. The truth was, it was just a narrow stone path that could only accommodate a single person at a time. It slanted downward, and its end wasn’t in sight.</p><p>They followed in single file into the secret passage. Densely packed Cloud Beasts hovered above their heads, and Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel a little frightened. His spiritual senses remained firmly focused on the nine people ahead of him.</p><p>If anyone dared to show the slightest bit of unusual movement, Qin Sang wouldn’t even wait for Yin Xingge to make a move and would swiftly kick them down.</p><p>‘Hoo! Hoo…’</p><p>A few Cloud Beasts flew past them and surprisingly landed on a rock not too far ahead.</p><p>It seemed like they had sensed the presence of their kin nearby. They turned their heads and looked, but didn't see anything. Then they doubtfully turned their heads back and started grooming each other’s feathers.</p><p>Fortunately, these few Cloud Beasts weren’t very strong, and they couldn’t see through the Star Disk’s concealment. Everyone froze rooted in place, with cold sweat on their foreheads.</p><p>A Qi Refining Stage cultivator swallowed and couldn’t help but send a sound transmission asking, “Senior Yin, what should we do now?”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Yin Xingge glanced back and glared at him fiercely, before coldly saying.</p><p>That person didn’t dare to speak further. The strange cries of the Cloud Beasts echoed throughout the chasm, filling the air with a sense of irritability and restlessness. Everyone remained frozen in place and didn’t dare to move, waiting for a complete hour before a few Cloud Beasts finally finished grooming themselves. They spread their wings and flew up, merging into the ‘dark clouds’ with a ‘嘎嘎’ sound.</p><p>“Quick!”</p><p>Yin Xingge hurriedly urged everyone. They swiftly moved downward along the secret passage, and saw the second layer of ‘dark clouds,’ and then the third layer, the fourth layer, and so on…</p><p>Finally, they saw a turn in the secret passage up ahead, which went into the cliff.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly rushed into the cave and let out a long breath of relief.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mu, Fellow Daoist Qin, Junior Apprentice Sister Yunqiong, get your magical artifacts out. If we encounter any Cloud Beasts blocking our way, strike them down with lightning speed and don’t give them a chance to struggle. Also, under no circumstances should you disturb the mountain body, lest you startle the creatures outside.”</p><p>Yin Xingge’s reminder reached everyone’s ears. Qin Sang directly summoned his Ebonywood Sword. This wasn’t the time to hide his abilities. Furthermore, the Ebonywood Sword’s greatest advantage lay in ‘Man and Sword Merge, Formless and Traceless.’ As long as he was careful about not exposing it, he could keep it for self-defense.</p><p>Scattered Immortal Yunqiong tossed out a cluster of crystals. They were as radiant as neon, and flowed like water, rising into the air. They then spread and stretched out, transforming into a tiny piece of sky. It was none other than Scattered Immortal Yunqiong’s famous magical artifact, the Five-colored Crystal.</p><p>The Azure Glass has control over the Five Elements. It can materialize a spirit into the rain, which sounds similar to Qin Sang's Five Elements Clouds. However, the raindrops evolved from the colorful Azure Glass are for killing, brimmed with the intent to kill!</p><p>The tunnel is also narrow. Otherwise, the colorful Azure Glass could directly cover half of the sky. Once you're covered by the Azure Glass, no matter which direction you escape to, you can't escape the rain.</p><p>Yin Xingge spread out a celestial net, which was woven from black iron. When it is unleashed, it looks like a thundercloud, complementing Yun Qiong's five-color Azure Glass.</p><p>This magic weapon is called the Cloud-Thunder Golden Net. It contains the power of lightning, but it does not excel at attacking with the power of thunder. Instead, it is best at restraining opponents with lightning ropes to prevent them from escaping, which is suitable for this situation.</p><p>Mu Yifeng's Nine Flames Divine Edge, Qin Sang has seen it before. Nine fire dragons circle the edge, making it extremely sharp.</p><p>The three of them offered the best magic tools, and they were all powerful. Together with Qin Sang's ebony sword, the four of them could instantly kill cloud beasts with the strength equivalent to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The other six Qi Refining stage shadow guards are just responsible for controlling the astrolabe.</p><p>On the road they encountered cloud beasts that accidentally broke in. The four worked more and more closely together. The Cloud-Thunder Golden Net shot out lightning ropes and restrained the cloud beasts. Then Qin Sang and the other three waited for the right moment and attacked. They didn't encounter any accidents along the way. After killing several cloud beasts in a row, they finally arrived at the entrance of the vein.</p><p>The entrance is on the rock wall of the tunnel. To the naked eye, it looks like an ordinary rock wall. Sweeping the divine sense can't sense any abnormalities either. It was actually blocked by a spell from a high-level cultivator in the Suspended Head Pass and requires a special spell tool to open.</p><p>They are already deep underground, and everyone is very careful not to make any noise. Yin Xingge took out a blue small seal and pressed it on the rock wall without making a sound.</p><p>The blue seal turned into a ball of blue gas and penetrated the rock wall. Then the rock wall quietly melted like ice, revealing a cave.</p><p>Everyone entered one after another. Seeing the scene behind the cave, they couldn't help but sigh in amazement.</p><p>I don't know whether it was formed naturally or by human effort, but the underground is completely hollowed out, forming a huge space no less than the rift valley outside. At the bottom of the space, red fluorite shines with fluorescent light like fireflies.</p><p>These fluorites are just ordinary gems. They are the companion mineral of a positive Yang Stone Quartz.</p><p>The positive Yang Stone Quartz on the surface have been mined. Everyone was on alert when they landed on the bottom of the space. They found the marked aisle and dived down. I don't know how deep they dived until they finally felt the temperature start to rise in the aisle.</p>
