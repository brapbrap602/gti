<h1>Chapter 778: Inside the Celestial Tower</h1><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the Celestial Tower. The Yuan Ying stage witch was still there.</p><p>The man surnamed Di explained, "With your cultivation level, Fellow Daoist, you certainly have the strength to challenge the Celestial Tower alone. However, as you can see, we don't know when this senior will let us pass, and I estimate we won't have much time. The Celestial Tower is full of perilous trials, and we are all rogue cultivators. Going it alone, I'm afraid we won't make it in time. Therefore, Fellow Daoist Su and I discussed inviting a few fellow rogue cultivators to enter the Celestial Tower together to expedite our progress. What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoist Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly upon hearing this.</p><p>He hadn't planned to gather other helpers before. Firstly, he couldn't find suitable candidates, and secondly, his strength was barely enough to navigate the Celestial Tower.</p><p>No one could have predicted this unexpected turn of events.</p><p>Joining forces with other rogue cultivators wasn't a bad option.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the cultivators in the square had also gathered in small groups, clearly sharing the same thought as the man surnamed Di.</p><p>"I'm honored by your invitation, fellow Daoists. However, I have one question. There are so many powerful cultivators here, I'm afraid I'm not particularly noteworthy. Why did you choose me?" Qin Sang asked curiously, without directly agreeing.</p><p>The old woman smiled and said frankly, "Because I saw Fellow Daoist Qin arrive alone, I'm certain you are a rogue cultivator, just like us. While others may have higher cultivation levels, their backgrounds are unclear.  We don't want to be targeted by someone with ulterior motives. Besides, we are only joining forces to travel quickly. Once we reach our destination, we will part ways. As long as you can handle the dangers along the way, that's enough.  If we want to search for treasures together, we can discuss it then. That's why, when Fellow Daoist Di approached me, I recommended you."</p><p>The man surnamed Di nodded. "If Fellow Daoist Qin is still unsure, you can ask around.  We all came here alone, just a little earlier than you."</p><p>He then pointed towards the edge of the square, where a man and a woman were watching them.</p><p>The man's face lit up with joy. "It seems Fellow Daoist Wu has persuaded the female cultivator. If Fellow Daoist Qin agrees, the five of us will be enough; we won't need to find anyone else."</p><p>Qin Sang looked over and noticed the man was also a witch, while the woman was human.</p><p>This meant their small team would consist of three humans and two witches, a rather unusual combination. Fortunately, they were only temporarily joining forces, with no conflicts of interest involved.</p><p>Qin Sang actually remembered all of them.</p><p>They were all standing alone in the outer area when he first arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate any longer and accepted their invitation.</p><p>It was still unknown when they would be able to enter the Celestial Tower. The five of them gathered together for a brief discussion. Qin Sang learned that the female cultivator's surname was Yin and she also claimed to be a rogue cultivator. No one questioned her further.</p><p>After finalizing their plan, Qin Sang returned to the forest to continue refining the Golden Yao Locks.</p><p>A tedious wait followed. Some couldn't bear the wait and gave up on the Celestial Tower, choosing to search for treasures elsewhere.  With access to the Seven Slaughter Palace granted only once every few decades, and after spending so much spirit stones to purchase entry, continuing to wait could mean a complete loss.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on refining his magical treasure. Before long, he suddenly heard the man surnamed Di shout excitedly, "Fellow Daoist Qin, come quickly! We can go in!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face also lit up with joy. He hurriedly put away the Golden Yao Locks and flashed out of the forest. He saw that the old man in front of the Celestial Tower was gone, and streaks of light were rushing into the gate.</p><p>During this time, the refinement of the Golden Yao Locks was almost complete, making them barely usable.</p><p>"Where is that senior?" Qin Sang asked curiously as he joined the others.</p><p>The old woman whispered, "It seems that senior received some kind of signal and entered the Celestial Tower."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. "So, the Demon Lord and the Grand Witch Priest haven't come out yet?"</p><p>"That's right," the man surnamed Di nodded, his tone grave. "Everyone, be alert. If the Yuan Ying battle isn't over, be sure to avoid getting caught in it."</p><p>Everyone's expressions were somewhat somber, but at this point, giving up was impossible. They didn't slow down and entered the Celestial Tower one after another.</p><p>As each cultivator entered, the space at the entrance of the Celestial Tower rippled like water.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the tower, glanced inside, and rushed in without hesitation.  A dizzying sensation followed as darkness enveloped them.</p><p>Even though they had gathered information and were mentally prepared, the scene before them still left them speechless with shock.</p><p>He found himself in an unknown space, shrouded in endless darkness, as if sunlight had never touched this place. The boundless darkness sent chills down their spines.</p><p>In the depths of the darkness, points of cyan light floated like stars.</p><p>These cyan lights varied in size and shape.</p><p>Some were long and narrow, stretching for miles.</p><p>Many were only the size of a stone, shining like a galaxy.</p><p>There were also huge spheres of light, hundreds of feet in diameter.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they realized these cyan lights emanated from fragments of buildings constructed from various cyan bricks.</p><p>The long, narrow lights revealed long passageways, stretching endlessly in both directions.</p><p>Within the enormous spheres of light, entire ancient palaces could be seen, radiating a mysterious cyan glow.</p><p>These structures were severely damaged. The smaller lights were the remnants of walls and tiles from completely shattered buildings.</p><p>All the buildings were eerily silent, floating motionlessly in the darkness, devoid of life and exuding an air of desolation.</p><p>In their prime, these buildings must have formed a magnificent complex of ancient palaces. Now, all that remained were fragments scattered in the darkness, like pieces of a shattered puzzle.</p><p>The space within the Celestial Tower had been shattered, yet for some unknown reason, no terrifying spatial rifts or storms had formed.</p><p>The space remained stable, but the ancient palaces were in ruins.</p><p>The ancient cultivators were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Beneath Qin Sang's feet was a fragment of a wall. He descended, driving his Ebony Sword into the wall.</p><p>A metallic clang echoed as the wall flashed with cyan light. The Ebony Sword was easily repelled and bounced back, leaving no mark on the wall.</p><p>Even the restrictions on the fragmented walls were beyond their ability to break.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, you're here."</p><p>The voice of the female cultivator surnamed Yin called out from behind Qin Sang. He turned and flew towards her, glancing around. "The other three fellow Daoists aren't nearby. It seems the entrance vortex scattered us. Let's send out the signal."</p><p>The female cultivator nodded, and together they sent out the agreed-upon signal.</p><p>The other three converged on their location, arriving one after another.</p><p>"I've heard of the Celestial Tower before, but I'm still stunned by this sight. What a terrifying battle it must have been to reduce this place to such ruins!"  The man surnamed Di exclaimed, and the others echoed his sentiment with a sigh.</p><p>The old woman reminded them, "Time is of the essence. Let's head to the Teleportation Hall."</p>
