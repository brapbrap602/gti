<h1>Chapter 1834: Too Late</h1><p>The entrance to the Aperture.</p><p>Qin Sang was surrounded by swirling poisonous mist.  To the naked eye, the cave appeared deep and bottomless.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish…’</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out, landing at the edge of the cave entrance.  A total of eight Spirit Banners, arranged in a Bagua formation, encircled the entrance.</p><p>The Spirit Banners formed an array, a precaution against the unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated here for several decades, remaining vigilant towards the Aperture, yet he had detected no abnormalities. There were no signs of life.</p><p>Having deployed the grand formation, Qin Sang flicked a metal ball from his finger. Upon landing, it transformed into a black hound.</p><p>The black hound, seemingly sensing the danger within, crouched low like a living creature, its eyes fixed on the cave entrance, a low growl rumbling in its throat.</p><p>The black hound was, in fact, a puppet, specially refined with the help of Mo Xingdao for scouting.  Poison Dao restrictions were integrated into its body, allowing it to merge with the Poison Dispelling Radiance to a certain extent.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Poison Pearl, releasing a beam of Poison Dispelling Radiance which infused the black hound. With a single command, the hound leaped into the cave entrance.</p><p>He waited for a moment, then followed unhurriedly.</p><p>The instant he entered the cave, a wave of icy coldness washed over him.  The rustling sound of the poisonous mist flowing from the depths of the Aperture echoed like the whimpers of ghosts, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang advanced through the poisonous mist, his mind connected to the grand formation within the Flower Field space, sensing the restrictions of this place, attempting to discern the cause of the Aperture's transformation from the changes in the formation.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang paused, his brow furrowing slightly. After hurrying forward a short distance, he saw the first black hound, frozen in place by the side of the path.</p><p>The black hound was now unrecognizable. Its once sleek, black body was covered in rust, immobilized as the virulent poison continued to corrode it from within.</p><p>Within a few breaths, the form of the black hound was almost completely lost, reduced to broken metal. Its surface began to melt, destined to become nothing more than a puddle of venomous liquid.</p><p>"The toxicity is indeed fierce…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  According to his formation calculations, he was still more than ninety percent of the way from the center of the Aperture. Fortunately, he had brought enough puppets.</p><p>Summoning another black hound, he continued to explore the path, repeating the process several times.</p><p>The deeper he went, the less time the puppets could endure. However, by circulating his Poison Yuan and utilizing the Poison Dispelling Armor, Qin Sang felt no strain.</p><p>Moreover, the anticipated dangers had not materialized. As he neared the center of the Aperture, the poisonous mist remained calm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as this thought flashed through his mind, his connection with the puppet ahead suddenly severed.</p><p>Simultaneously, a gust of Yin wind assaulted him from the front.</p><p>In the final moment, Qin Sang saw a shadow through the puppet's eyes before it perished instantly.  The shadow had a humanoid outline, most likely a living creature!</p><p>His gaze sharpened. He fully activated the Poison Pearl within his body, releasing waves of Poison Dispelling Radiance that condensed into a nearly tangible, seven-colored, protective armor around him.</p><p>The heavy armor, its radiance illuminating the surging poisonous mist ahead, revealed a ghostly figure within the fog.</p><p>As the Yin wind struck him, a sword cry suddenly resonated.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword pierced through the mist.</p><p>The cave was not particularly wide, allowing for at most three people to walk abreast. Now, sword energy crisscrossed the space, as if trying to pierce the cave walls.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A sword shadow flashed and vanished as Qin Sang deployed the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.  The surrounding light seemed to grow dimmer.</p><p>The sword formation sealed the cave, instantly enveloping the shadow within. Under the focused starlight, its true form was revealed.</p><p>The sword formation was profound. The shadow, unable to break through, could only wander within the ‘starry sky’.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the monster within the formation, a strange look in his eyes.</p><p>The shadow resembled a living creature, capable of movement and instinctively attacking enemies, yet it didn't seem to possess sentience.</p><p>However, the shadow reminded Qin Sang of the Flower Fairy he had encountered before, noticing similarities.</p><p>A moment later, another thought struck him.  With a flicker of his mind, the sword stars converged, transforming into a ferocious White Tiger that slashed downwards.</p><p>The shadow looked up and roared at the White Tiger, its body swelling with dense poisonous mist. However, it was no match for the White Tiger’s ferocity.  The poisonous mist, along with the shadow's form, was instantly dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang made a grasping motion, and a wisp of black Qi flew into his palm.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura within the black Qi – the strange power that had poisoned the Earth Cricket Mountain disciple.</p><p>He had previously suspected that this power originated from the Aperture, and his suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>Circulating his Poison Yuan, he sensed the intense toxicity of the black Qi.  The strange power within the Earth Cricket Mountain disciple was different from this black Qi; she must have only been grazed by it. Otherwise, she wouldn't have lived long enough to see him.</p><p>"The shadow resembles a living creature.  Could that Flower Fairy not have been transformed from a flower spirit, but from a shadow?  How many Flower Fairies has this Aperture birthed?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. What he had witnessed in the Aperture did not align with the records in the *Poison God Classic*.</p><p>He speculated that perhaps the owner of the Flower Field had made unauthorized alterations, or perhaps, due to years without a master, the Aperture had transformed on its own.</p><p>Aware of the shadows' existence, Qin Sang became even more cautious. If there weren't many Flower Fairies, he could slay them and collect their pearls. But if the Aperture was teeming with them, he would have to retreat.</p><p>Sealing the black Qi, Qin Sang continued deeper, soon encountering a second shadow, which he also eliminated with the sword formation.  He smoothly reached the core of the Aperture.</p><p>At the end of the cave was a pitch-black space.  A faint, flickering light emanated from its center.</p><p>By this faint light, he could see several grotesque shadows wandering in the darkness.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. He suppressed his aura with all his might to avoid attracting their attention.</p><p>The shadows here were the same as those he had slain, muddled and seemingly bound to this place by a strange force, unwilling to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, his gaze piercing through the shadows to discern the source of the flickering light. His heart stirred, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face.</p><p>The source of the light was a fruit, the size of a plum, crystalline like a grape, its skin delicate as if it would burst and spill sweet nectar with the slightest touch.</p><p>The spiritual fruit was incredibly alluring.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang’s eyes also grew fervent. He had cultivated Poison Arts for many years and was extremely familiar with flower nectar. This fruit's aura was very similar!</p><p>Glancing around, Qin Sang formed a general hypothesis. He retreated calmly, retrieving a wisp of the black Qi and carefully examining it.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang understood. He returned to the core of the Aperture to sense again, nodding silently, now eighty percent certain.</p><p>The black Qi was the essence of the shadows’ existence.  At its core, it faintly emanated a fluctuation similar to the pearls within the Flower Fairies.</p><p>From this, he could deduce that the Flower Fairies evolved from the shadows. However, the shadows in the Aperture had their transformation forcibly interrupted by a special power, leaving them in this peculiar state.</p><p>That power originated from a formation within the Aperture.</p><p>When Qin Sang discerned the purpose of this formation, he couldn't help but admire its ingenuity.</p><p>This formation was subtly integrated into the core of the Flower Field's grand formation. The two formations' energies merged seamlessly, nearly becoming one.  Without understanding the *Poison God Classic*, one would be unable to distinguish the difference.</p><p>The excess flower nectar gathered here, transformed by this formation, and condensed into that spiritual fruit.</p><p>The spiritual fruit was, in reality, a poisonous fruit cultivated by flower nectar.  In this form, it was preserved, preventing waste and also preventing the birth of an excessively powerful Flower Fairy after a long period without a master, which could lead to the Flower Field changing hands.</p><p>This transformation was not perfect. The remaining nectar, following the original formation, dissipated into the outside world, its toxicity altered as it merged with the external poison restrictions, preventing the birth of Flower Fairies.</p><p>Another portion transformed into these shadows, their evolution interrupted and bound within the Aperture once they reached a certain level of power, forever trapped.</p><p>More importantly, the black Qi within the shadows, unlike the pearls within the Flower Fairies, was not completely fused with resentment, making it easier to separate.</p><p>Cultivators could separate the resentment, though it required some effort.  The cultivation speed was still faster than not cultivating Poison Yuan at all.</p><p>Of course, for Qin Sang, the presence or absence of resentment had no impact.</p><p>This formation also had its limits; it was not without flaws.</p><p>If too many shadows accumulated within the Aperture, the formation would eventually collapse, freeing the shadows from their confinement.</p><p>The Flower Fairy was a fortunate one who had escaped this confinement. If Qin Sang and the others hadn't arrived, once the Flower Fairy matured, overcoming its instinctive fear and the Aperture formation's rejection, it would have broken the formation, devoured its kin and the poisonous fruit, and become a monstrous fiend!</p><p>Now, all of this would benefit Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was both delighted and amazed. He had attained some proficiency in formations and restrictions, yet he knew he couldn't create such a formation.</p><p>The person who created this formation was no ordinary individual!</p><p>This showed that the *Poison God Classic* lineage had also produced brilliant descendants who improved upon their ancestors' methods.</p><p>Yet, for some unknown reason, this person had vanished from the cultivation world, leaving no trace in any related scriptures.</p><p>"Perhaps there are records in the Dao Court…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, sitting in meditation within the cave, his eyes fixed on the wandering shadows.  Whenever a lone shadow approached, he would trap it within the sword formation and silently eliminate it.</p><p>Strands of black Qi fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>After collecting a portion, Qin Sang paused, stood up, and took a deep look at the alluring poisonous fruit before retreating.</p><p>The poisonous fruit could not be taken lightly. He had to harvest it after eliminating all the shadows, otherwise it would enrage them, causing them to break free from the formation’s restraints during the ensuing chaos, unleashing pandemonium within the Flower Field space.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly returned to his cave dwelling and began cultivating using the black Qi.  The poisonous power within the black Qi was not as potent as the Flower Fairy pearls, but it was superior to flower nectar, alleviating his concerns about nectar shortages for the time being.</p><p>From then on, whenever he had free time, Qin Sang entered the Aperture to eliminate the shadows.  After several trips, he cleared the Aperture, leaving only the poisonous fruit.</p><p>A faint fragrance lingered in the air.</p><p>The poisonous fruit had no roots or stem, seemingly growing in the void, born from nothingness. In reality, its aura was connected to the formation, rooted within it.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang extended his right hand, enveloping it in Poison Dispelling Radiance. Just as he was about to touch the poisonous fruit, he abruptly withdrew his hand, frowning as he gazed at it.</p><p>He sensed that the poisonous fruit and the formation's energy were one.  Rashly taking the fruit could damage the Aperture's formation, thereby shaking the foundation of the entire grand formation.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had learned this formation and understood how to repair it.  However, the fusion of the two formations was incredibly intricate.  Repairing it after damage would be extremely difficult.</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang's expression shifted. He formed a blade with his fingers, gently slicing the skin of the poisonous fruit.  A drop of liquid immediately oozed out, falling into a jade bottle he had prepared.</p><p>The poisonous fruit's glow dimmed slightly, causing the formation to fluctuate, but the ripples quickly subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the jade bottle, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p>He only needed to extract the liquid bit by bit.  Since no one else could enter the Flower Field, it didn't matter if the fruit remained here.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling with the jade bottle, Qin Sang attempted to refine the liquid. His eyes immediately lit up with delight.</p><p>The poisonous fruit's liquid, originating from the same source as the flower nectar, was even purer and more concentrated.  Refining this liquid could potentially accelerate his cultivation even further!</p><p>…</p><p>Eight years passed swiftly.</p><p>“The appointed day is approaching…”</p><p>Qin Sang awakened from his meditative trance, remembering his agreement with Master Qi to commence refining the armor soon.</p><p>Master Qi had dedicated decades to the True Treasure fragment, and the chances of success this time were high. However, Qin Sang felt no excitement at the prospect of acquiring the treasure. Instead, he sighed softly.</p><p>After some preparations, Qin Sang left the Healing Platform, concealing his presence as he traveled.</p><p>During these eight years, he had only returned once to deliver the monstrous beast carcasses. He wondered how the situation in the cultivation world was progressing.</p><p>His journey was uneventful.  He reached the Island in the Pot and met Master Qi in the fire chamber.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>Master Qi appeared somewhat tense, but visibly relaxed upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>“I will control the fire for you, Master.  Feel free to proceed without reservation!” Qin Sang reassured him.</p><p>Master Qi suddenly burst into laughter.  “I naturally have no fear.  Even if the cauldron explodes, will Fellow Daoist descend to the underworld to collect your debt from me?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was a jest and couldn't help but chuckle, shaking his head repeatedly.</p><p>Using laughter to release his tension, Master Qi called for Qin Sang to seal the fire chamber, and they engaged in a final discussion.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>The mansion gates were tightly closed. Master Qi's disciples gathered outside the fire chamber, their faces filled with anxiety.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, the square cauldron was activated. Qin Sang controlled the spiritual fire, which, despite him not directly observing it, remained remarkably docile.</p><p>Under Qin Sang’s watchful eye, Master Qi levitated the True Treasure fragment above the square cauldron. His fingers moved like a spinning wheel, sending a continuous stream of hand seals into the water ripples within the fragment.</p><p>This refining process was different from before. Master Qi poured all his knowledge and experience into refining the True Treasure fragment, remaining focused for several consecutive days.</p><p>The fragment appeared unchanged, but the power of the seals on its surface had likely been amplified thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times!</p><p>Master Qi alone could not have persisted this long without Qin Sang's assistance.</p><p>With their combined efforts, the water ripples within the True Treasure fragment visibly darkened.  Finally, as the last hand seal was imprinted, a wave of water suddenly leaped from the cauldron, its ripples filling the fire chamber.</p><p>“Quickly!”</p><p>Master Qi entrusted the True Treasure fragment entirely to Qin Sang and immediately began refining the armor’s body using other spiritual materials.</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The anxiously waiting disciples suddenly felt the ground tremble. A force, both scorching hot and icy cold, erupted from the fire chamber. Those with weaker cultivation turned pale and stumbled backward.</p><p>Everyone stared anxiously at the fire chamber doors.</p><p>Inside, the spiritual fire subsided, revealing two exhausted figures.</p><p>Master Qi held a suit of armor in his hand, his face beaming with uncontainable excitement.</p><p>The armor was only the size of a palm, without plates, the entire piece appearing as if cast from water.</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice rang out, “This armor was crafted by your hand, Master. Please bestow a name upon it.”</p><p>A look of gratitude flashed in Master Qi's eyes. After a long moment of hesitation, as if recalling past events, a faint smile appeared on his face.  “In my youth, I lived beneath Bright Mountain.  Let this armor be called the Bright Mountain Armor.  What do you think?”</p><p>“Bright Mountain Armor, a fine name!” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Master Qi admired the armor for a long time, reluctant to part with it.  He then handed the Bright Mountain Armor to Qin Sang, watching as he refined it.  Suddenly, he looked up at the sky, his expression unreadable, his voice distant.  “Fellow Daoist, do you believe the path of artifact refining can lead to immortality?”</p><p>He had devoted himself to artifact refining, but neglected his cultivation.</p><p>Was it due to his dull aptitude, his inability to grasp the true meaning, or was it truly impossible to achieve both?</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and said solemnly, “Of the three thousand Great Daos, the path of artifact refining is surely among them. How could it be inferior?”</p><p>Master Qi hung his head dejectedly, murmuring softly, “Meeting you, Fellow Daoist… it was too late…”</p><p>Finally, he sighed heavily. “Too late!”</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>North of Star Island’s Immortal Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other disciples witnessed Master Qi undergoing his tribulation. He perished beneath the tribulation lightning.</p><p>In the final moment, Qin Sang seemed to see a shadowy figure within the tribulation clouds, bowing faintly in farewell from afar.</p>
