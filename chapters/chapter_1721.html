<h1>Chapter 1712: Ascension (Part 2)</h1><p>In the fire chamber.</p><p>A ball of demonic fire pulsed above Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The violent demonic fire behaved as docile as water before Qin Sang, its aura constrained within a confined space. Even if someone stood before Qin Sang at this moment, they would feel no threat.</p><p>Within the demonic fire, a celestial altar slowly rotated.</p><p>Each rotation created ripples, but under Qin Sang's masterful control, the ripples quickly subsided, and the refinement process proceeded exceptionally smoothly.</p><p>The celestial altar was the core of the tribulation-crossing formation—the Taiji Celestial Altar.</p><p>Compared to the one seen in Bingyi Palace, this altar was more complete. The forty-nine grooves along its edge for inserting the Ice and Fire Talismans were all present; only the Yin and Yang poles remained unformed, their runes flickering, and restrictive light emanating.</p><p>The Bingyi Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Orb floated on either side of the demonic fire.</p><p>A chilling aura extended from the Bingyi Divine Disc, connecting to the Yin pole, while a crimson thread connected the Yang pole to the Fire Rhinoceros Orb.</p><p>Energy flowed slowly from both treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the celestial altar at the heart of the demonic fire, his hand seals changing continuously as he meticulously inputted prohibitions, guiding the two vastly different energies to circulate within the altar's meridians.</p><p>If the celestial altar were considered a human body, the internal meridians would be its veins. The meridians circulated, connecting energy and merging with the prohibition runes until the treasure was complete!</p><p>Ten years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang had refined the Ice and Fire Talismans quickly. The Taiji Celestial Altar, however, proved more troublesome.  After shaping the altar, Qin Sang entrusted his avatar with refining the altar's meridians, a task that took ten years to complete.</p><p>As time passed, one could see that complex blue and red patterns formed on the surface of the altar, centered around the Yin and Yang poles.</p><p>The patterns gradually spread across the altar, meeting in the middle. Under Qin Sang’s exquisite control, they did not clash but extended into each other’s territory until the entire altar glowed with a blend of blue and red light, indistinguishable from one another, finally merging completely.</p><p>The celestial altar's brilliance subsided, and recesses shaped like a spirit plate and a jade pendant appeared at the Yin and Yang poles, perfectly fitting the two treasures.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Extinguishing the demonic fire, Qin Sang let out a long breath and examined the Taiji Celestial Altar.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he flipped his palm, launching forty-nine beams of light—the Ice and Fire Talismans—which inserted themselves into the grooves along the altar's edge, while the Bingyi Divine Disc and Fire Rhinoceros Orb automatically returned to their places.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The Taiji Celestial Altar trembled slightly.</p><p>Two brilliant rays of light, one blue and one red, shot out from the Yin and Yang poles, followed by a low hum from the forty-nine Ice and Fire Talismans, as if they were about to break free from the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang did not continue to activate it; otherwise, the Yin and Yang poles would generate ice and fire pillars, initiating the tribulation-crossing formation.</p><p>His eyes shone with wonder as he gazed intently, sensing the changes in energy, his face full of satisfaction.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing formation was complete!</p><p>In fact, Bingyi Palace contained not only the tribulation-crossing formation, but also a prohibition that could record the scenes of ancestral tribulations for future generations to study, but Qin Sang hadn't obtained this method.</p><p>Next, he only needed to place the tribulation-crossing formation in a suitable location and await the tribulation.</p><p>Putting away the various treasures, Qin Sang left the fire chamber.</p><p>Midday.</p><p>The sun was high in the sky.</p><p>The sun shone brightly on Luye.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly before the fire chamber, surveying the entire Daoist compound, then slowly closed his eyes.  Without using his divine sense, he felt a strange sense of merging with heaven and earth, a state of complete self-forgetfulness.</p><p>With five elemental spiritual roots and a divine sense at the Ascension level, all favorable conditions converged on Qin Sang.  When pursuing the harmony between man and nature, after overcoming initial confusion, he grasped the key.</p><p>He had achieved small success in just twenty years, and his progress had accelerated in the past decade.</p><p>For others, such speed would be unimaginable.</p><p>Of course, achieving a certain level of mastery in the harmony between man and nature was not enough to directly propel Qin Sang into the Ascension stage. He still needed to spend a considerable amount of time comprehending the Dao, reflecting on himself, and seeking a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>The key lay in the *Wu Sheng Demon Seal*.</p><p>Now, the *Wu Sheng Demon Seal* was nearing completion, only one step away from condensation.</p><p>After years of careful understanding, Qin Sang was certain it was not an illusion; the *Wu Sheng Demon Seal* he was cultivating possessed extraordinary power!</p><p>Moreover, Tianmu Butterfly, who had been cultivating by Qin Sang’s side, had reached its peak after completely refining the peculiar energy of the near-dragon spittle, supported by spirit-raising methods and various spirit medicines.</p><p>Because the main ingredient of the Green Frost Pill remained elusive, and he had discovered the secret of the *Wu Sheng Demon Seal*, Qin Sang no longer focused on helping Tianmu Butterfly break through and concentrated his efforts on himself.</p><p>His fourth-stage peak life essence insect-蛊 also possessed the ability to assist in breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p>With the completion of the tribulation formation, the conditions for his breakthrough to the Divine Transformation Realm were essentially met.</p><p>His thoughts raced, and the entire Daoist temple fell within Qin Sang's perception; every blade of grass and every tree was as clear as if they were before his eyes.  His physical manifestation had completed its task and was resting in its cave dwelling.</p><p>The bamboo grove outside the cave was a restricted area; no one in the Qingyang Temple, including Shen Chen, dared to approach it.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew through, making a rustling sound, quite serene.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was located on the other side of Luye, referred to by the Temple disciples as the Inner Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang perceived several disciples cultivating within various cave dwellings in the Inner Temple.  The Qingyang Temple now had disciples at the Golden Core stage, and several others at the Pseudo-Golden Core stage were preparing for their breakthroughs.</p><p>Before these disciples entered Luye, Shen Chen would always lead them to pay respects to the ancestral master, something Qin Sang vaguely remembered.</p><p>But that was all. Unless someone possessed exceptional talent and a cultivation speed far exceeding their peers, they wouldn't attract Qin Sang's special attention.</p><p>Deep within the Inner Temple, a stone chamber with a tightly closed door was Shen Chen's cave dwelling.</p><p>Several noteworthy events occurred in these years.</p><p>Upon Shen Chen's advancement to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang entrusted him with the position of Grand Master of the Qingyang Temple in Zhongzhou.</p><p>Shen Chen was already quite talented, and while his physical manifestation traveled, he fortuitously obtained a breakthrough-aiding elixir, which he sent back to Luye, aiding in his advancement.</p><p>However, Shen Chen's initial breakthrough was a complete success, astonishing Qin Sang.  He had initially taken this apprentice because of his talent in crafting artifacts, but Shen Chen exceeded all expectations.</p><p>The Zhongzhou Qingyang Temple now had a second Nascent Soul master!</p><p>With Shen Chen in charge, the legacy of Qingyang Temple was secure, allowing Qin Sang to essentially become a hands-off manager.</p><p>The Cloud Touring Sword also underwent significant changes.</p><p>Through continuous refinement with the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*, Qin Sang clearly felt the stabilizing and burgeoning of the Jiao Mu true spirit.</p><p>Another event involved the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After devouring the fire spirit in the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool on Fire Rhinoceros Island, the Fire Jade Centipede, which had been dormant for many years, awoke with fourth-stage mid-level cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang then fed the Fire Jade Centipede the remaining fire spirits sealed within his physical manifestation, sending it back to sleep.  He wondered if these spirits could push it to the late fourth stage.</p><p>Everything was progressing favorably.</p><p>His thoughts returned.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, descending the stone steps toward the foot of the mountain.  A few steps in, he heard rustling sounds from the bamboo grove. Suddenly, more than a dozen greenish-blue tendrils shot out, lunging toward him.</p><p>The tendrils landed before Qin Sang, emitting a series of chirping sounds as they lay prostrate at his feet.  These were the earthbound dragons raised by Su Zi Nan, their ferocity removed by Qin Sang, and now kept as mountain guardian beasts.</p><p>The earthbound dragons were very close to Qin Sang's aura, lying on their backs, their cries filled with urgency. Qin Sang smiled and flicked out several pills.</p><p>After devouring the pills, the earthbound dragons followed Qin Sang, sometimes in a line, sometimes scattered, frolicking through the bamboo grove until he entered the bamboo tower, at which point they returned to their nests.</p><p>Inside the bamboo tower, Qin Sang sat upright with a serious expression.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense to introspect, he silently circulated the *Lifeless Demon Seal*, perceiving the formation of the demon seal, continuing his comprehension.</p><p>He remained in seclusion for ten years.</p><p>On this day, the spiritual energy surrounding the bamboo tower suddenly surged.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face underwent a strange transformation, his complexion at times draining of color, becoming pale, at other times suffused with a grayish-black aura, as if he were beset by demonic energy, gravely ill.</p><p>His breathing was erratic, affecting the surrounding environment.</p><p>A ‘whooshing’ sound filled the air.</p><p>The bamboo tower shook, a gale sweeping through the bamboo grove, scattering fallen leaves.</p><p>The earthbound dragons, sensing Qin Sang’s aura, trembled in their nests.</p><p>Qin Sang was entirely oblivious to the external changes, his mind completely captivated by the internal demon seal.  The time had come to condense the seal!</p><p>Although his obsession remained incomplete, Qin Sang disregarded it, forcibly forming the seal.</p><p>The demonic intent of the Heavenly Demon was now extremely thin. The demon seal was no longer in its initial form, its structure complete, lacking only the final step. With his obsession incomplete, several inconsistencies occurred during the operation of the mental technique; the seal repeatedly teetered on the brink of loss of control, making the process extremely difficult.</p><p>The greatest danger was the triggering of a mental demon, resulting in a loss of mental control.  However, Qin Sang's mind remained clear, self-forgetful, steadfastly pushing forward with the secret technique.</p><p>‘Condense!’ he suddenly muttered.</p><p>A booming sound echoed within Qin Sang's body. His face flickered between pale and dark as demonic energy threatened to erupt, but he swiftly suppressed it, completing the final incantation.</p><p>Instantly, the demonic energy receded.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a square seal slowly rotating within him.  The seal was black and sinister, seeming to draw everything in, including his consciousness.</p><p>"Finally!"</p><p>Without time for reflection, Qin Sang began cultivating, experiencing the seal.  As before, it was intimately connected to him.  A slight touch sent his true energy vibrating.  He sensed its power was even greater than anticipated!</p><p>The seal's immense power highlighted the terrifying danger of the demonic energy absorption process, leaving him with lingering fear.</p><p>But dwelling on it now was futile.</p><p>Qin Sang refocused, and after a moment's thought, summoned his Sky Eye Butterfly and took out a jade box.</p><p>The butterfly, sensing its master's serious contemplation, remained perched on his shoulder, perfectly still.</p><p>He opened the box to reveal a crystal-clear spiritual fruit – a Lingxi Immortal Fruit.</p><p>Inhaling the fruit's fragrance, Qin Sang merged his consciousness with the butterfly and once more sensed the Wusheng Demon Seal.  The feeling intensified, on the verge of eruption!</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Only his physical body lacked refinement.</p><p>But he had seized the opportunity; there was no need to wait!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang rose to his feet.</p><p>At Qingyang Temple, Shen Chen was cultivating when he received a message from his master.  Surprise flashed across his face, then, remembering something, he was both startled and overjoyed. He immediately rushed out of his cave dwelling, awakening the other disciples and bringing them to the lower courtyard.</p><p>When Shen Chen returned, he also brought the Mingyue Guard. They saw Qin Sang's external manifestation standing behind him.</p><p>Upon reaching Luye, the deer cart trembled and sped westward.</p><p>Reaching the outskirts of the storm belt, a desolate wasteland ravaged by nine calamities, Luye stopped.  Ripples suddenly appeared in the surrounding void.</p><p>White clouds materialized out of thin air, filling the sky in layers.</p><p>Then, the clouds churned.</p><p>In the heart of the cloud sea, a mountain range, resembling a dragon with towering peaks, gradually appeared – a Daoist training ground.</p><p>This explained why Luye's protective array had been deactivated, leaving only the array protecting Luye itself.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body now stood on Luye's main peak, gazing at the heavens and surveying the earth.</p><p>The tribulation formation was placed here, connected to the spiritual veins.  He was prepared to break through and undergo his tribulation here!</p><p>"Quickly patrol the area and drive away all unauthorized personnel!"</p><p>A low voice resonated in the ears of the Mingyue Guard.</p><p>The external manifestation led the group out of Luye, scattering to carry out their orders.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The external manifestation stood atop a mountain peak not far from Luye, while Shen Chen and the Mingyue Guard guarded different positions.</p><p>In the training ground.</p><p>The main body sat above the Taiji Immortal Platform, the Ice and Fire Talismans, the Ice Instrument Divine Disk, and the Fire Rhinoceros Jade all in place.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly circled Qin Sang's head, then transformed into a stream of light, rushing into his forehead.</p><p>The next moment, a thunderous roar erupted from within Qin Sang.</p><p>Black demonic energy, seemingly appearing from nowhere, surged around him, and the Wusheng Demon Seal within him shattered!</p><p>Seal broken, breakthrough!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang's true energy boiled, his energy sea and meridians felt as if they were about to burst, sending waves of pain through him.</p><p>Yet, he was oblivious to the pain, experiencing a state of oneness with Heaven and Man.</p><p>It felt like actively merging himself with the heavens and earth, returning to his origins, without completely losing his own Dao, but seeking the point of greatest harmony with the heavens to receive the feedback of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang clearly felt the bottleneck loosen the moment the Wusheng Demon Seal shattered!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade box opened, and the Lingxi Immortal Fruit was swallowed.</p><p>The fruit, his life-bound insect Gu, and the remnants of the Wusheng Demon Seal—the power of all treasures erupted simultaneously.</p><p>In an instant, the previously blurry Dao became crystal clear, and he finally understood the ultimate truth!</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, his voice echoing through the heavens!</p><p>Above Luye, dark clouds gathered, thunder boomed, and the world's spiritual energy became violently turbulent. Within the howling spiritual tide, the energy churned, creating countless colorful orbs of light that floated around Qin Sang and Luye, descending from the sky.</p><p>A terrifying pressure emanated from Luye's main peak.</p><p>Even the Yuan Ying-cultivation-level Mingyue Guard, standing outside Luye, felt an involuntary tremor as the pressure descended upon them.</p><p>The celestial omen continued, with colorful clouds filling the sky, rays of light shining, followed by wind and thunder, throwing this world into utter chaos. Finally, a familiar energy fluctuation emerged, and they saw an unstable, formless flame in the center of the storm.</p><p>"Yin Fire Tribulation! Master… succeeded!"</p><p>A Mingyue Guard practically groaned, gazing at Luye with a mixture of awe and reverence.</p><p>On Luye's main peak.</p><p>Qin Sang, lost in a state of oneness, allowed the Yin Fire to burn.</p><p>The tribulation formation had activated. The two treasures representing Yin and Yang shone brightly, emitting ice and fire pillars respectively. Forty-nine Ice and Fire Talismans broke free from their slots, rising into the air and rotating around Qin Sang.</p><p>The talismans absorbed the ice and fire energy, two mutually exclusive forces, merging them into a single stream that flowed endlessly around Qin Sang.</p><p>Under the protection of this energy, the Yin Fire dancing around Qin Sang visibly weakened, losing its initial ferocity.</p>
