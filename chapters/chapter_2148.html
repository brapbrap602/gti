<h1>Chapter 2138  Ning Zhenren</h1><p>“Senior, from here south, ten thousand li will take you beyond the Fog Sea…”</p><p>Qin Sang exited the teleportation hall and found himself on an island. Lush vegetation covered the island, while thick white fog surrounded it.</p><p>Eight stone pillars encircled the island, taller even than its highest peak, each topped with a crystal the size of a human head.  The crystals emitted a soft glow, illuminating the island and repelling the fog.</p><p>A guard followed Qin Sang, pointing south and describing the surroundings with utmost respect.</p><p>This teleportation array was little known; only experts from various tribes ever used it.</p><p>“Thank you for the information!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, not immediately taking out the jade token.  Just as he was about to depart using his light-speed escape technique, he sensed something and turned to his right.</p><p>A young man emerged from the woods. He wore a green robe and carried a feather fan, possessing an elegant bearing. His appearance was similar to a human, but his hair was a vibrant purple-red, unusually thick, resembling thin vines.</p><p>“Friend, wait!”</p><p>The young man beckoned from afar, stopping Qin Sang.  With a single step, he appeared instantly before Qin Sang.</p><p>Waving the guard away, the young man bowed.  “My name is Zhao Hao. May I ask your name?”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was cold, distant and unwelcoming.</p><p>One can usually determine the origin of a member of the other races by their appearance, but Qin Sang couldn't place Zhao Hao's tribe. He knew the major tribes best, and assuming Zhao Hao wasn't deliberately concealing his identity, he must be from a lesser-known, noble tribe.</p><p>The young man was unfazed, continuing with a smile, “I’ve lived in this area for many years and consider myself well-connected, yet I’ve never seen you before. You must be new here.  I wonder what brings you, and perhaps I could be of assistance. This place borders the East Sea’s aquatic tribes; the situation is complex.  Those uncultivated aquatic creatures are unreasonable.  Making friends is the best way to avoid trouble.”</p><p>“Thank you for your kindness, but I prefer to travel alone!”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang didn't wait for a reply, rising into the air and flying away.</p><p>The young man frowned slightly, then caught sight of Qin Sang's robe shifting, revealing a token at his waist. His expression changed slightly.  He muttered, “Those troublesome monkeys!”</p><p>He shook his head and left.</p><p>Flying out from the island, Qin Sang travelled south, and suddenly the mist cleared, revealing a breathtaking view of the blue sky and sea.</p><p>Qin Sang paused to look back. A wall of white fog stretched to the heavens, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>This must be the edge of the Fog Sea, but he wondered if the fog would spread outwards when it returned.</p><p>Qin Sang noted the location. Seeing no one around, he took out the jade token and infused it with his spiritual energy.</p><p>The jade token emitted a faint glow, and a subtle ripple spread out.  Qin Sang sensed its meaning, then launched himself forward, following the direction indicated by the token.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.  After half a day's flight, Qin Sang reached a deserted sea area. The jade token's glow faded, its guidance completely disappearing. It lost all its power, becoming an ordinary object.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the area but found nothing unusual, only a deserted island.  As he examined the jade token, puzzled, a golden light streaked through the sky from afar.</p><p>The golden light flew directly towards the island, descending from the heavens to reveal a monk. The monk had a shaved head, wearing a golden kasaya.  He landed and looked at Qin Sang, his hands clasped together.  “I am Liao Chen, from the Purple Cloud Mountain Monastery. Are you Qin Zhenren?”</p><p>“It is I.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, secretly surprised.</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain was a Buddhist force.  Could Liuli’s new master be a Buddhist high monk?  Based on what the Yuanxiang clan leader had said, Qin Sang had suspected Liuli's master was a Daoist master from the Dan Ding sect.</p><p>Buddhist forces were said to be concentrated in the west of Da Zhou, but unexpectedly, he encountered one in the East Sea, and one connected to Liuli at that.</p><p>Liao Chen said, “I was ordered to wait for you, Zhenren. If you have no pressing matters, shall we depart immediately and return to the monastery?”</p><p>“Thank you for leading the way, Master,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“You’re too kind, Zhenren. Just call me Liao Chen,” Liao Chen turned around, transforming into a golden light and rising into the air.</p><p>Qin Sang also used his light-speed escape technique, catching up to Liao Chen, secretly frowning.  For some reason, he felt Liao Chen’s attitude was somewhat cold, perhaps it was simply his personality.</p><p>Liao Chen's cultivation was on par with Qin Sang’s. The golden light was clearly a superior escape technique. Other cultivators might struggle to keep up.</p><p>Was it truly heartless, or a deliberate test?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom Liao Chen's intentions, but he wasn't afraid of a contest of speed. Silently, he caught up with Liao Chen, walking alongside him with an air of ease.</p><p>A serious glint flashed in Liao Chen's eyes, and he slowed his pace.</p><p>Qin Sang matched his speed, feigning ignorance of their earlier competition. He asked the question that weighed most heavily on his mind:  "Who among the holy monks of Purple Cloud Mountain sent the jade token and invited me here?"</p><p>Liao Chen replied, "I was sent by Master Ning to greet you."</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain was a Buddhist stronghold, yet the one behind this was a Daoist Master. How were they connected?  This confirmed that  Liu Li had indeed joined the Daoist sect.</p><p>"Master Ning?" Qin Sang asked, his tone questioning.</p><p>Liao Chen guessed Qin Sang's confusion and explained, "When I was young, Master Ning had already been secluded on Purple Cloud Mountain for many years.  The monastery referred to Master Ning as 'Master'. Many monks, including myself, received guidance from Master Ning and regarded him as a teacher."</p><p>Within the Daoist sect, those at the great power level of Unity and Mahayana stages were respectively revered as True Monarch and Celestial Master.  It's unclear whether this originated from the Dan Ding or Fu Zhu schools, but the tradition has continued to the present day. Exceptions might exist, of course, such as someone preferring the title 'Master'.</p><p>Since Liao Chen was already in the Void Refinement mid-stage when he was young, and Master Ning had been secluded on Purple Cloud Mountain for years, just what stage was Master Ning at?</p><p>Though Liao Chen didn't explicitly say, one could infer from his words.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy for Liu Li to have such a master, but also felt a certain pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang asked a few more questions, but Liao Chen was clearly reluctant to reveal much more, so Qin Sang gave up. He figured he would get his answers upon meeting Master Ning.</p><p>The two flew southwest, frequently sensing the presence of demons along the way, but the demons couldn't detect them.</p><p>They flew until evening, yet still hadn't reached Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>As the sun was almost setting, painting the sky with vibrant hues, Liao Chen finally descended, forming hand seals and striking towards the void.</p><p>The sea was open and empty here, devoid of islands or reefs.  As a golden hand seal appeared in the void, there was a slight tremor, a subtle ripple, yet the surface of the sea remained calm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as he sensed a peculiar wave that had been previously undetectable.</p><p>The wave spread rapidly towards them.</p><p>"Master, do not resist it," Liao Chen warned.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt a powerful suction pulling him towards the source of the wave. Simultaneously, the surrounding scenery changed dramatically.  The sky and sea seemed to invert, the heavens hung upside down, and the void pulsed with brilliant colors, distorting everything around him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt himself sinking deeper, as if falling into another space, but he had no time to investigate the source of this power.</p><p>He saw a massive mountain, solitary and majestic, shrouded in mist, suspended above the sea.</p><p>Pine trees and cypresses, verdant willows and exotic flowers.</p><p>Auspicious clouds reached to the heavens, auspicious clouds connected to the void!</p><p>This was a true immortal mountain. Compared to it, even putting aside its mystical aspects, Mount Taiyu was merely a barren hill.</p><p>At the peak of this mountain, purple clouds drifted, adding to the mountain's mystique. Purple Cloud Mountain truly lived up to its name.</p><p>On all sides was the boundless ocean, with only this one mountain.  Qin Sang didn't know where he'd been taken, it was clearly not the previous sea area.</p><p>"This is Purple Cloud Mountain," Liao Chen gestured, "Please follow me, Master."</p><p>With that, Liao Chen led Qin Sang directly towards the mountain.</p><p>As they approached, Qin Sang saw countless pavilions and towers within the mountain. Near the summit, buildings stretched out, hidden among the trees, a large ancient temple. This must be the monastery Liao Chen had spoken of.</p><p>Most areas were protected by formations and shrouded in mist, obscuring the view and preventing any unforeseen issues. Qin Sang didn't let his Sky-Eye Butterfly use its abilities to investigate.</p><p>Liao Chen didn't take Qin Sang to the temple but bypassed the front of the mountain and flew towards the back.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang sensed several gazes falling upon him, a mixture of scrutiny.  Clearly, many people in Purple Cloud Mountain were watching his arrival.</p><p>However, these gazes held no hostility, only a certain amount of undisguised observation and detachment.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, following Liao Chen to the back mountain.</p><p>The back mountain was steep, with lush greenery, flowing streams, and a few scattered pavilions, clearly more serene than the front.</p><p>A quiet lake was hidden within the woods, and they landed on a stone path beside it.</p><p>Liao Chen paused slightly. Qin Sang also heard the faint sound of a guqin , coming from ahead.</p><p>Liao Chen subconsciously slowed his pace, crossed the stone bridge, and turned past the shade of the trees. A lakeside pavilion came into their view.</p><p>The pavilion was exquisitely beautiful.  A long table stood within, upon which sat a guqin. A person, whose slender back suggested a woman, sat facing away from them, intently playing the instrument. The music flowed from her fingertips.</p><p>Liao Chen stopped and stood quietly outside the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent as well.  This was simply the sound of a guqin; there were no traces of spiritual energy or musical techniques, yet it was the most melodious sound Qin Sang had ever heard in his life.</p><p>He unconsciously closed his eyes and listened intently. The music seemed to blend with nature, or perhaps nature blended into the music.  The chirping of insects, the singing of orioles, the sound of flowing water, the wind, and the rustling of leaves—all became enchanting within the melody, captivating the listener.</p><p>However, gradually, Qin Sang detected a hint of sorrow in the music, which puzzled him. The sounds of the fish, insects, birds, and animals harmonizing with the music were clearly joyful.</p><p>Had he misheard? Or did each listener perceive different sounds?</p><p>After what seemed like a long time, the music stopped abruptly.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, feeling a sense of loss. He was certain he hadn't been beguiled by the music; it wasn't some magical spell. Yet, his mind felt unusually calm, something he could only describe as "miraculous."</p><p>As the woman's hands lifted from the strings, Liao Chen softly said, "Master Ning, Master Qin has arrived."</p><p>Stepping aside, Liao Chen gestured for Qin Sang to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the pavilion. Master Ning stood up and turned to face them.</p><p>As expected, Master Ning was a woman. She wore a blue Daoist robe and her hair was styled in a Daoist bun.</p><p>In the presence of Master Ning, one instinctively overlooked her appearance; one might even forget her features upon turning away, retaining only a vague yet unforgettable impression. At this moment, Qin Sang saw no trace of sorrow on Master Ning's face. She gave him a feeling like the tranquil lake surface, or perhaps the boundless ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom Master Ning.  He could only be certain that her cultivation far surpassed his own; she was at least a Unity stage cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Master Ning was the first to speak, her voice gentle, "Master Qin, what is your rank and position in the Daoist Court?"</p><p>Master Ning's words revealed her awareness of his identity.  Qin Sang wasn't surprised. With the Thunder Altar and various Thunder Talismans, anyone familiar with Daoism would see his connection to the Talisman Sect.</p><p>However, before the Daoist Court's emergence, only scattered lineages existed in the world, their inheritors yet to receive the Court's recognition. Yet Master Ning seemed certain of his origin.</p><p>Qin Sang straightened his posture, "Third Rank, Celestial Immortal of the Nine Heavens Golden Que, Divine Thunder Jade Pivot Envoy, Lord Qin Sang of the Five Thunder Court, greets Master Ning!"</p><p>Liao Chen's attitude along the way had made Qin Sang suspect that this trip might not be straightforward.  Facing Master Ning, he felt an invisible pressure. He needed something to help him stand before her. Aside from his secrets, which he couldn't reveal, only his official position within the Daoist Court would suffice.</p><p>As he stated his rank, Qin Sang subtly activated the aura of the imperial decree from the Thunder Altar.</p><p>The imperial decree was a Celestial Master's command, issued from the Nine Heavens Golden Que, bearing the seal of the Daoist scriptures, and impossible for outsiders to forge. Master Ning could easily discern its authenticity.</p><p>"So it's Lord Qin of the Thunder Jade Mansion.  My apologies,"</p><p>A look of surprise flickered in Master Ning's eyes as she bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the change in Master Ning's demeanor.  Simply stating his title earned him the respect of a powerful cultivator.  He wondered what the Daoist Court had been like in its heyday.</p><p>It was also clear that Master Ning wasn't hostile towards the Daoist Court, which relieved Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the Daoist Court's ranks had levels. If he were an ordinary celestial official, Master Ning would not have been so respectful. This meant that during the Daoist Court's prime, even with her cultivation, she likely wouldn't have been qualified to lead the Five Thunder Court.</p><p>"Lord Qin, please."</p><p>Master Ning gestured to the opposite side of the table.</p><p>Two meditation cushions were placed on either side of the table.  Qin Sang thanked her, entered the pavilion, sat cross-legged, and looked at the ancient guqin on the table.</p><p>The guqin was dark yellow, its material unknown. Qin Sang sensed no spiritual energy from it— it wasn't an ordinary object, but a treasure.</p><p>Master Ning sat down again, put away the guqin, and personally arranged a jade teapot and cups, meticulously brewing a spiritual tea.</p><p>The steam rose.</p><p>The aroma of the tea and the sight of Master Ning preparing it were a pleasure in themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered what Master Ning would say, whether she would inquire about the Daoist Court first.</p><p>What to say, what not to say, how to create a deceptive impression of strength—he had carefully considered all this before arriving, devising a plan.</p><p>Yet, Master Ning's first question was unexpected.</p><p>Master Ning pushed a cup of tea towards Qin Sang and softly said, "Lord Qin, have you taken Daiyu Immortal Mountain?"</p>
