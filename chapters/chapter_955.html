<h1>Chapter 947: Responsibility</h1><p>Hidden in the shadows among the mountains, two figures overlooked the wasteland.</p><p>“We must cross the wasteland to leave this place?”</p><p>Bai learned about the situation of the Seven Kills Hall from Qin Sang and his expression turned grave. “If that person keeps guarding the wasteland, wouldn't we be trapped here?”</p><p>“Unless he's gone mad!”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. “Those who entered the Seven Kills Hall this time, besides the Nascent Soul cultivators from the two clans, there are also Core Formation cultivators from various major sects, all of whom are elites among their peers and hold significant positions. Would he dare to offend all the sects and search each one of them? The Boundless Sea isn't his playground, and neither High Priest nor Patriarch Ling Zhuzi of the Heavenly Dao Sect would allow it."</p><p>At this moment, the wasteland had returned to its former tranquility, with no one in sight.</p><p>After leaving the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, the two hadn't found any trace of that Nascent Soul cultivator and didn't know his whereabouts. Bai suspected whether this person would continue to lie in wait.</p><p>Logically speaking, no matter how crazy that person was, he wouldn't dare to do such a thing; it was too reckless.</p><p>An ambush by a Nascent Soul cultivator was a certain death situation for Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>If everyone acted this way, the treasures obtained would become someone else's wedding garment. Who would dare to enter the Seven Kills Hall to search for treasures?</p><p>Such a thing had never happened before, and there must have been a tacit understanding between the various factions, perhaps even established rules.</p><p>Moreover, with the two great cultivators, Ling Zhuzi and the High Priest, in the Seven Kills Hall, this person couldn't run wild.</p><p>But Qin Sang suddenly recalled a scene that had occurred in the Seven Kills Hall before.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the High Priest had fought over a treasure, their battle extending from inside the Heavenly Tower to the Boundless Sea, involving the Nascent Soul cultivators of both clans and nearly triggering a full-scale war between them.</p><p>He had been caught in the crossfire and nearly died in the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>If something similar were to happen again, the High Priest and Ling Zhuzi would certainly prioritize the overall situation and wouldn't have time to attend to these minor matters. It was indeed possible that this person might succeed.</p><p>If this person was convinced that there was a valuable treasure in the Ghost Domain, it wasn't entirely impossible for him to act recklessly.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang truly felt uneasy.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, think carefully again. Do you really not remember his appearance?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed Bai.</p><p>He had asked Bai back in the Ghost Domain, hoping to confirm the enemy's identity so he could avoid him in the future, but unfortunately, Bai hadn't seen the person's face either.</p><p>Bai shook his head. “When he appeared last time, I had just snatched Fellow Daoist's Corpsefiend. After you left, I focused on refining the body. When I sensed the demonic fire fluctuations, I sealed the Corpsefiend and came out to investigate, but that person had already left. This time, he deliberately ambushed you and didn't even reveal his true body. It was because I was prepared that I detected the flaws he exposed while setting up the formation. As for other times, whether he had been here or not, I'm even less certain. There wasn't just one or two cultivators who tried to break the restriction and enter. Several Nascent Soul cultivators once came together and set up a top-level grand formation, but they couldn't shake the demonic restriction…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly and shook his head. “Forget it, since we're here, let's face it. It's not time to leave yet. I still have an important matter to attend to. The Seven Kills Hall might descend into chaos later, and we might be able to escape then. I’ve already removed the soul mark for Fellow Daoist. What are your plans for the future?”</p><p>Qin Sang had just fulfilled his promise and removed the soul mark from the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul.</p><p>He had naturally obtained the Soul Nourishing Wood as well.</p><p>The agreement between the two was complete, and they no longer owed each other anything.</p><p>Bai frowned. “Fellow Daoist, is it over just by removing the soul mark? There’s another strange power within the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul, fused with its original Nascent Soul, indistinguishable from each other.  That should also be left by Fellow Daoist, right?”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “That power is called the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, and it's a crucial element in this corpse refinement secret technique. However, I only know how to refine the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, but not how to undo it.”</p><p>Bai stared at Qin Sang, his eyes clearly showing disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang met his gaze calmly, his words completely truthful. “This corpse refinement technique is called the 'Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual'. It's no longer of any use to me, and there's no need to keep it secret. If Fellow Daoist doesn't believe me, see for yourself."</p><p>He retrieved the Heavenly Corpse Token from the Qianjun Ring and tossed it to Bai.</p><p>After reading the contents of the Heavenly Corpse Token, Bai’s expression suddenly became exceptionally gloomy.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious. “Why should Fellow Daoist be bothered by a mere talisman seal? Without my soul mark, the main body of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman isn't difficult to break. With Fellow Daoist's strength, you should be able to easily erase the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul, right?”</p><p>Bai gave a wry smile. “Erasing the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul isn't difficult, but if I do that, I'm afraid I can only continue down the path of corpse refinement and will never be able to return to normal.”</p><p>After a pause, Bai explained, “After I fused with the Corpsefiend’s body, I discovered that the body wasn't truly dead, and there was still a trace of life force within it. Once the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul is erased, the life force will also disappear, and it will become a true corpse. If I want to restore the body to normal, I must start from the root, first refining the Corpsefiend’s Nascent Soul, and then slowly recover… Unless I obtain some kind of divine elixir or rare treasure, there's no turning back. According to Fellow Daoist, the current cultivation world is fragmented, and the strongest cultivators are only at the late Nascent Soul stage. Where can I find such a heaven-defying treasure?”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Although he had transformed himself into a living corpse, he had the protection of the Jade Buddha and wasn't considered a true Corpsefiend, so his experience wasn't as profound as Bai's.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after such a long time, the Flying Night Devil's body still retained a trace of life force. Was this the true reason why the 'Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual' called it a living corpse?</p><p>If Bai found a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, perhaps it could be used on Ya Gu.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang quickly asked, "What do you mean by life force, Fellow Daoist? Is it really possible to return to normal after breaking the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Bai gave Qin Sang a meaningful look. "The life force I'm referring to is different from the external life energy brought by elixirs. It refers to the fundamental life force. Fellow Daoist guessed correctly. As long as the Heavenly Corpse Talisman can be broken, the woman in your Corpse Puppet Bag has a chance to recover. I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to be such a devoted person, using evil methods to save someone and keeping her by your side all this time, never abandoning her. It truly makes me look at you in a new light…"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist saw her?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly. "It's not devotion, but responsibility. If it were Fellow Daoist, could you bear to watch your savior die before your eyes? If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, then avenging her would have been enough to ease my conscience. Since there's a way to save her, even if the hope is extremely slim, I can't stand idly by. Otherwise, my conscience wouldn't be at peace."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang opened the Corpse Puppet Bag and summoned Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu resembled a sleeping beauty. Unlike the Flying Night Devil, her appearance didn't resemble a Corpsefiend at all, and her skin was even more rosy and delicate than before.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist has been a Ghost Cultivator for many years. Are you truly helpless against the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at Ya Gu for a long time before looking up and asking.</p><p>Bai shook his head, his expression serious. "I suspect the 'Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual' may not be a corpse refinement technique, at least not entirely."</p>
