<h1>Chapter 472: Spatial Tempest</h1><p>An exquisitely crafted flying sword, accompanied by a deafening thunderclap, shot out from Qin Sang's brow, transforming into a bolt of lightning as it appeared before everyone.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang held nothing back, unleashing all the power he could muster.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword made its stunning debut.</p><p>The resounding might of the sword's thunderous aura, combined with the inherent aura of the Ebony Wood Sword itself, not only shocked the elegant young man but also drew the attention of Yu Shanting, Granny Jing, and Elder Palmstar.</p><p>In an instant, the Ebony Wood Sword traversed the space between the two.</p><p>The elegant young man's eyes widened in terror.  The only thing he could do was manipulate his treasured saber, erupting with endless blade light, layers of saber shadows, attempting to block the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A layer of blood-red light surged onto the Ebony Wood Sword's surface, and at this moment, the sword light also transformed into a crimson lightning bolt.</p><p>A splash of blood-red light spilled forth.</p><p>Carrying a taint of defilement, the blood-red light landed squarely on the treasured saber's blade.</p><p>The moment the treasured saber came into contact with the blood-red light, its blade light suddenly dissipated, and its bright luster turned into a decaying grayish-white at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>In an instant, the treasured saber became mere iron.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The blade shattered completely!</p><p>Even magical treasures would lose their power in a short time upon contact with the Defiled Divine Light, let alone a mere magical tool.  </p><p>This high-grade magical tool was destroyed without any resistance.</p><p>The scattering iron shards stung the elegant young man's eyes, and the unimpeded Ebony Wood Sword brought him the aura of death.</p><p>The elegant young man's face was filled with terror. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out.</p><p>A beam of moonlight, no slower than the Ebony Wood Sword, descended from the sky.</p><p>Granny Jing didn't dare let the elegant young man unleash the Void Thunder. Almost at the same moment Qin Sang decided to use the Ebony Wood Sword, she forcibly activated her magical treasure.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The bright moon suddenly intensified, shooting out a beam of moonlight. It pierced through the space conjured by Elder Palmstar's silver robe, descending upon the elegant young man, locking onto the Void Thunder in his hand, and forcibly seizing it.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword was only a hair's breadth behind the moonlight. It was about to pierce through the elegant young man's heart, killing him instantly.</p><p>Seeing Granny Jing's supporting moonlight, Qin Sang's expression relaxed.  A sudden thought flickered in his mind, and at the last moment, he forcibly restrained the Ebony Wood Sword's sword qi, slightly altering its trajectory.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p>The elegant young man watched helplessly as the Ebony Wood Sword thrust towards him, his face filled with despair.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword pierced into the elegant young man's body, but it didn't injure his heart. Instead, it passed by his vital points.</p><p>However, the moment it entered the young man's body, Qin Sang secretly urged the Ebony Wood Sword to unleash its sword qi, shredding the meridians within his body into a tangled mess. This would incapacitate the elegant young man without causing irreparable damage.</p><p>If Qin Sang were facing the young man alone, he certainly wouldn't dare to take such a risk. However, with Granny Jing's assistance, it was different. Suppressed by the moonlight, the elegant young man was indeed powerless to resist.</p><p>The sword qi raged within him. The excruciating pain from his severed meridians contorted the elegant young man's face, and he eventually fell unconscious.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword pierced through the elegant young man's chest.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure shot forward, swiftly approaching the elegant young man.  However, his gaze fell upon Elder Palmstar. The Ebony Wood Sword followed Qin Sang's gaze, its resonant hum echoing as it went straight for Elder Palmstar.</p><p>With the Ebony Wood Sword revealed, there was no longer any need to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to assist Granny Jing in eliminating Elder Palmstar and Yu Shanting, aiming for a swift victory to resolve the hidden danger and prevent any future trouble. He didn't care about Granny Jing's fate; he didn't want to end up being hunted by the entire Small Cold Realm.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword was a genuine magical treasure. Even someone as powerful as Elder Palmstar wouldn't dare to ignore it.</p><p>It was a pity that the Defiled Divine Light was wasted.</p><p>The Defiled Divine Light could only be used once, and it required time to recover.</p><p>Had he known that Granny Jing still had the strength to provide support, there was no need to use the Defiled Divine Light on the elegant young man.  Saving it for Elder Palmstar would have been far more effective.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't regret it. In that situation, it was impossible to hold back. If the elegant young man had managed to unleash the Void Thunder, he would have truly regretted it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this glance brought a dramatic change to Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>Perhaps because Granny Jing was distracted by supporting Qin Sang, the lofty bright moon dimmed somewhat. Elder Palmstar seized this opportunity, urging the river of stars to rapidly converge towards the moon.</p><p>Compressed to its limit, the river of stars' aura surged, showing signs of suppressing the moon.</p><p>Elder Palmstar gasped, then suddenly pointed a finger towards his chest.  His entire body shone with brilliant starlight, mirroring the river of stars. The source of the starlight was countless crystalline chains tightly wrapped around him.</p><p>The chains were crystal clear, bright as crystal, seemingly fragile, yet exceptionally strong.</p><p>From head to toe, the chains, like some form of torture, bound Elder Palmstar tightly.</p><p>The chains appeared out of thin air, previously unseen.</p><p>Silver hair danced wildly.</p><p>Elder Palmstar roared towards the sky, appearing almost insane.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A crisp sound echoed as a chain snapped.</p><p>With this beginning, the other chains followed suit, instantly breaking in large numbers.</p><p>Simultaneously, Elder Palmstar's aura soared at an alarming rate, surpassing the Foundation Establishment stage in the blink of an eye and continuing to climb.</p><p>"Is this how Elder Palmstar suppressed his cultivation?" Qin Sang wondered, guessing the purpose of the chains.</p><p>He immediately recalled Granny Jing's previous words, and a look of alarm appeared on Qin Sang's face.  He focused his gaze and indeed discovered that as Elder Palmstar's aura erupted, surpassing the Foundation Establishment stage, the space around him seemed to be stained with ink, plunging into utter darkness.</p><p>Within the darkness, faint fluctuations rippled.  These fluctuations were subtle yet alarming to observers, as within their depths, barely discernible cracks seemed to appear.</p><p>Granny Jing had said that the space around Heaven's Finger Peak was fragile.  If an intruder unleashed power beyond the Foundation Establishment stage, it would, at best, shatter the space, and at worst, potentially trigger a spatial tempest!</p><p>A spatial tempest was something even Nascent Soul grandmasters would avoid.  Elder Palmstar suddenly broke the chains, recklessly unleashing his cultivation. Was he not afraid of death?</p><p>Soon, Elder Palmstar gave Qin Sang his answer.</p><p>Elder Palmstar also knew the terrors of a spatial tempest.  His eyes revealed a look of horror and urgency.  He swiftly pointed a finger downwards, and a streak of light descended into the center of the plaza.</p><p>The piled stone pillar fragments were shattered by the streak of light, turning into dust, revealing what lay hidden beneath.</p><p>At the very center of the plaza was a circular stone platform.</p><p>The platform wasn't large, less than two zhang in diameter, protruding slightly higher than the outermost ring of stones. The dust on its surface was swept away by the streak of light, revealing its true form.</p><p>Having endured countless years, the dark gray stone platform was mottled and weathered, exuding an aura of endless antiquity.</p><p>On the top of the platform, crudely drawn mystical runes were etched.</p><p>The streak of light merged into the stone platform, completely absorbed, without a trace dissipating.</p><p>In the next moment, the runes on the stone platform glowed brightly.</p>
