<h1></h1><p>Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his breath gradually steadying.</p><p>He wasn't injured, merely depleted of True Essence. After a period of meditative recovery, he quickly returned to his peak condition.</p><p>Opening his eyes, Qin Sang glanced sideways at the Heaven's Eye Butterfly perched on his shoulder.</p><p>Her wings spread slightly, faint lightning flickering within her Heaven's Eye.</p><p>Just after the Heavenly Tribulation ended, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had glowed intensely, almost entirely enveloped by lightning threads, like a ball of thunder, a thunder butterfly birthed within the storm.</p><p>The lightning gradually faded as the Heaven's Eye Butterfly absorbed the swallowed tribulation lightning into her body.  She conveyed a weary thought to Qin Sang, nuzzled him gently, and then plunged into his Qi Sea to slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang had a premonition that once the Heaven's Eye Butterfly fully digested the power of the tribulation lightning, she would receive considerable benefits, possibly even greater than the advancements of the past century.</p><p>“This is also a path…”</p><p>He rubbed his chin.</p><p>Without the Witch Clan inheritance, Qin Sang could only rely on his own explorations. Because he had focused on his own cultivation for the past century, he had inevitably somewhat neglected the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>This resulted in the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's cultivation falling far behind his own.</p><p>The same was true for the *Heavenly Demon Refining Formula*, which remained stalled in the early stages of the fourth level. After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang had practically abandoned body refinement.</p><p>His luck had been quite good.</p><p>In the early Nascent Soul stage, he obtained the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and the Nascent Soul Puppet. In the mid-stage, he advanced within the Cleansing Pool and acquired the Buddha Bone Relic.  Not only was his cultivation speed impressive, but more importantly, his two breakthroughs had been remarkably smooth.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang was compelled to devote all his energy to raising his realm and cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, delaying everything else.</p><p>It was no wonder why most cultivators focused on the Dao of Spells; they simply lacked the time to also cultivate auxiliary paths.</p><p>Having her absorb tribulation lightning seemed like a viable path for her advancement, but it meant waiting for Qin Sang's Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation every three hundred years, as well as his Deity Transformation Tribulation.  The time required was simply too long.</p><p>Allowing the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to absorb the tribulation lightning of others was not feasible.  First, Qin Sang didn't want to expose her abilities. Second, no cultivator would permit anyone near them during their own tribulation.</p><p>Next, his main body and avatar would cultivate the *Ice Soul Divine Light* together.</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang’s main body quietly left the Clear Void Illusion Realm, returning to the Misty Water Market to continue cultivating secret techniques.</p><p>After the Heavenly Tribulation, the pressure of the Heavenly Dao was gone.</p><p>Qin Sang was free from a layer of constraint and could finally move freely, without worrying about incidents midway that might lead to unforeseen circumstances during his next tribulation.</p><p>In the following years, Qin Sang acted unusually, proactively inviting Jiang Mu to his cave dwelling as a guest, engaging in discussions on the Dao, fostering some rapport.</p><p>As Jiang Mu had predicted, as the Ghost Festival approached, auctions and treasure exchange meetings became increasingly frequent in the Central Region. Before his tribulation, Jiang Mu had sent news several times, but Qin Sang had ignored it then.</p><p>However, the kind of top-tier treasure exchange meeting that truly interested Qin Sang had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang had attended one auction and one treasure exchange out of curiosity.  A few so-called treasures had caught his eye, but only briefly. He quickly lost interest, unwilling to waste further time.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that Qin Sang had acquired a Fire Jujube at an auction.</p><p>When the Fire Jujube was presented, the Fire Jade Centipede stirred restlessly within its spirit beast pouch, transmitting an urgent desire.</p><p>Speaking of the Fire Jade Centipede, Qin Sang felt somewhat helpless.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had been subdued, and compared to the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang found it easier to control its state.</p><p>Although helping it ascend in the North Sea had failed, it had still benefited greatly, its potential surging. Afterwards, it continuously consumed Fire Melting Pills and various spirit herbs that Qin Sang's avatar had gathered. Qin Sang had initially thought the Fire Jade Centipede would advance before the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite being in the Central Region for over a century, the Fire Jade Centipede was still firmly stuck before the bottleneck of its fourth transformation, unable to make any progress.</p><p>The difficulty of spirit insect advancement was evident.</p><p>Since a spirit herb the Fire Jade Centipede craved had finally appeared, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to acquire it.</p><p>The Fire Jujube also had obvious benefits for cultivators practicing fire-attribute techniques, attracting many bidders, including two Nascent Soul cultivators.  Fortunately, Qin Sang possessed the legacy of Yue Fei and successfully secured the jujube.</p><p>After consuming the Fire Jujube, the Fire Jade Centipede reverted to its old habits, curling up into a ball.</p><p>It slept soundly, but without forming a cocoon, which didn't resemble a sign of a breakthrough. Uncertain, Qin Sang could only leave it be.</p><p>Aside from this, Qin Sang could also learn about the major events of the world through the Six Regions Hall.</p><p>Currently, the most talked-about event in the cultivation world was undoubtedly the emergence of Lu Ye’s descendant, Su Zinan!</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan had never met, but they had indirectly become entangled. Yue Fei had ‘died’ at the hands of his avatar, and Old Wu had been defeated by his main body. A future confrontation seemed inevitable.</p><p>Learning that Su Zinan had appeared in the Central Plains, Qin Sang paid particular attention to the matter.</p><p>Su Zinan's journey south, clad in white, was extremely high-profile.</p><p>Upon entering the Central Region, the Nether Moon Guards were recognized, and news quickly spread throughout the entire region. Countless cultivators and sects focused their attention on him.</p><p>Su Zinan, worthy of being the adopted son of a Deity Transformation cultivator, possessed extremely high cultivation, a late Nascent Soul grand cultivator, and his entourage was astonishingly large.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul Nether Moon Guards constantly followed him, at his beck and call, and an extraordinary stranger also remained by his side like a shadow.</p><p>Later inquiries revealed that the man was Mo Xingdao, a notorious figure in the Northern Wastelands, known as the foremost rogue cultivator.</p><p>Such a formidable figure acted as Su Zinan’s guard!</p><p>No one knew the extent of Su Zinan’s powers, as no fool dared to offend him.  Even without Su Zinan needing to act personally, Mo Xingdao and the Nether Moon Guards presented insurmountable obstacles.</p><p>After entering the Central Plains,</p><p>Su Zinan initially vanished for a period, his movements secretive and unpredictable, as if searching for something.</p><p>Then, as expected, he paid visits to the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Sceneries View.</p><p>His stay at each sect was brief.  Witnesses reported that he appeared furious each time he emerged, as if a dispute had occurred, before angrily descending the mountain.</p><p>Su Zinan's subsequent actions caused even greater upheaval in the Central Region.</p><p>He announced his intention to gather helpers and journey to the East Sea to search for the Illusory Palace.</p><p>The last time the Illusory Palace ruins emerged, many experienced cultivators had attempted to enter, only to be repelled at the periphery. The Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery suffered heavy losses, and True Person Zi Lei was injured.</p><p>Since then, the Illusory Palace ruins had completely vanished, never to be found again.</p><p>Coupled with the extreme danger of the ruins, interest had waned considerably.</p><p>As time passed, the turmoil caused by the Illusory Palace gradually subsided, but the events surrounding its emergence were not forgotten.</p><p>Suspicions had long existed that a Deity Transformation cultivator might be trapped within the Illusory Palace.</p><p>Su Zinan’s actions further fueled these suspicions.</p><p>He declared that if anyone could help him reach the depths of the Illusory Palace, he would not only take none of the treasures within, but would also reward them handsomely with precious items!</p><p>He displayed several treasures, two of which even Qin Sang found tempting.</p><p>Regardless of whether Su Zinan’s promise was credible, his intentions were intriguing. If he wasn't seeking treasures, why would he risk everything to force his way into the Illusory Palace?</p><p>Confirmation arrived that Su Zinan had appeared in the Red South Island Chain.</p><p>Numerous curious individuals rushed to the East Sea.</p><p>Upon learning of this, Qin Sang also considered meeting Su Zinan, and quickly decided to leave his avatar cultivating in Pu Mountain and travel to the East Sea himself.</p><p>Firstly, to see the Illusory Palace for himself.</p><p>Secondly, the whereabouts of the Deity Transformation cultivator remained a mystery, and Qin Sang wished to confirm the truth.  If the Deity Transformation cultivator was indeed missing or trapped somewhere, he wouldn't need to be as wary of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Sceneries View while investigating the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He followed the same route his avatar had taken before.</p><p>First, he traveled south by boat from the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>The river surged.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the bow of the treasure ship, listening to the sound of the vessel parting the waves.  Looking left and right, his vision was filled only with the boundless river, the shores out of sight.</p><p>By now, he had left Zhuo Prefecture and entered the heart of the Central Plains—the Six Prefectures of Jiang Zuo.</p><p>Calculating the distance, he suddenly looked up at the sky.</p><p>Soon after,</p><p>Mist began to rise over the empty river.</p><p>This mist was peculiar, invisible from afar, appearing suddenly as one approached, clearly the work of a spirit array.</p><p>The mist obscured a thousand miles of the river but didn't obstruct vision.</p><p>“It’s Dragon Dwelling Wharf!”</p><p>A low-level cultivator exclaimed from within the cabin.</p><p>A flurry of cultivators rushed out, crowding the bow, excitedly gazing ahead.</p><p>As the name suggested, Dragon Dwelling Wharf was related to the top-tier sect of the Central Plains, the Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven.  In reality, the wharf had no name, but as it was controlled by the Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven, outsiders called it Dragon Dwelling Wharf.</p><p>The Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven’s mountain gate was located less than three thousand miles south of Zhuo Prefecture, not far from Mount Bu Nian, one to the east, one to the west, both on the banks of the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>Leaving Zhuo Prefecture, one would first pass by the Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven.</p><p>Dragon Dwelling Wharf was the second largest wharf on the Flying Cloud River, second only to Flying Cloud Crossing where the Flying Cloud River and the Fu River converged!</p><p>Moreover, Dragon Dwelling Wharf could accommodate not only ferries,</p><p>But also large flying artifacts operated within the Central Region. The largest merchant house behind these operations was backed by the Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven.</p><p>Amidst the hazy mist,</p><p>Giant white pillars appeared at intervals on the river surface, stretching tens of thousands of feet into the sky, vanishing into the sea of clouds. Closer inspection revealed that they were actually water pillars formed by the river itself.</p><p>River water was drawn upwards by an unseen force, coiling like dragons to form the thick pillars, flowing against the current, supporting the clouds above.</p><p>Numerous ferries were docked around each water pillar.</p><p>At this moment, another wave of excited cries arose from the ship.</p><p>A group of cultivators disembarked, and then white shadows flickered at the base of a water pillar. A majestic water dragon emerged from the river, soaring through the clouds and mist, carrying the cultivators skyward.</p><p>As the water dragon ascended, the clouds parted, revealing the fleeting silhouette of a gigantic flying artifact.</p><p>The ship shuddered slightly as it docked beside a water pillar.</p><p>Cultivators, impatient to disembark, rushed off the ship, riding the dragons into the sky.</p><p>The boatmen took on new passengers and continued southward.</p><p>In the Central Plains, everything was orderly, undoubtedly beneficial for low-level cultivators. They could travel long distances by simply spending some spirit stones, without worrying about the dangers of the journey.</p><p>Back then, before forming his Golden Core, Qin Sang hadn’t even known what lay south of the Cloudsea Great Marsh.</p><p>“How long can this peace last?”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed silently, turning back to the cabin.</p><p>After passing Dragon Dwelling Wharf, the treasure ship reached Flying Cloud Crossing, where Qin Sang changed vessels and turned east.</p><p>Flying Cloud Crossing, rather than a crossing, resembled a vast lake.</p><p>The Flying Cloud River and the Fu River, the two most important waterways of the Central Plains, converged here. The constant collision of their waters had formed the largest lake in the Central Plains, and perhaps even the entire continent.</p><p>Numerous cities and markets thrived around Flying Cloud Crossing, commerce flourishing.</p><p>The Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery were situated on the east and west sides of Flying Cloud Crossing, respectively, on the southern bank of the Fu River. Their mountain gates were some distance from Flying Cloud Crossing, both tacitly avoiding interference with the area.</p><p>Flying Cloud Crossing was like the pearl of the Central Plains, the epitome of prosperity!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disembark. While it was his main body’s first visit, his avatar had been here several times, so he was familiar with the place.</p><p>There were cultivators indulging in hedonism,</p><p>And mortals diligently seeking the Dao…</p><p>…All walks of life, in all their variety,</p><p>Could be found at Flying Cloud Crossing.</p><p>As the ship sailed east, Qin Sang turned to look westward.  West of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery lay the foremost demonic sect, the Skyhowl Tower.</p><p>The Skyhowl Tower, along with the Malignant Transformation Sect of Ze Prefecture in the Northern Lands and the Heaven Subduing Valley of the Seven Prefectures of the Western Path, were collectively known as the three great demonic sects of the Central Plains, occasionally producing Demonic Patriarchs who reached Deity Transformation.</p><p>The three great demonic sects acted in concert, also maintaining ties with the demonic sects of the Northern Wastelands, securing their position.</p><p>Moreover, the Skyhowl Tower had more allies than just these.</p><p>Continuing eastward along the Fu River,</p><p>Past the Eight Sceneries View, nearing the East Sea,</p><p>Lay the final super-sect of the Six Prefectures of Jiang Zuo, the Jade Reflection Sect.</p><p>It was said that the Jade Reflection Sect had intricate connections with the immortal mountains of the East Sea, wielding power comparable to the Skyhowl Tower.</p><p>The five great sects of the Six Prefectures of Jiang Zuo weren’t strictly divided according to the boundaries of the six prefectures.</p><p>The Dragon Dwelling Grotto Heaven and the Jade Reflection Sect were not demonic sects, and the immortal mountains of the East Sea were predominantly of Daoist lineage.  Yet, they were secretly aligned with the Skyhowl Tower.  The three sects formed a triangular formation, effectively encircling the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>This arrangement, once established, had remained stable to this day.</p><p>Of course, no matter how these three sects collaborated, they couldn't suppress or restrict the lineages of Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>The Western Desert, largely dominated by the Buddhist and Daoist sects, was a clear testament to this.</p><p>The Buddhist and Daoist sects of the Seven Prefectures of the Western Path had begun merging long ago, giving rise to the Quiet Zen Manor.  Like a firmly driven nail, it wedged itself between the three great demonic sects, a constant thorn in their side.</p><p>The ship sailed out into the East Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked on a random island, summoned his flying light, and flew towards the Red South Island Chain, familiar with the route.</p><p>Arriving at the Red South Island Chain,</p><p>Qin Sang found it even more bustling than during his avatar’s previous visit, cultivators swarming in, rumors swirling.</p><p>He learned Su Zinan’s whereabouts with minimal effort.</p><p>After a brief pause, Qin Sang flew beyond the island chain.</p><p>His avatar had traveled here by boat, and Qin Sang still recalled the journey.</p><p>He deliberately suppressed his cultivation and altered his appearance, flying over the sea for a while before arriving at the location where the Illusory Palace ruins had previously emerged.</p><p>Hovering in midair, Qin Sang stared at the empty sea, feeling a surge of surprise.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, a large island should have been here, but it had vanished.</p><p>He circled the area, confirming his memory.  The mere residual waves from the Illusory Palace ruins had flattened the enormous island.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, using its Heaven's Eye ability to scan both the sky and the sea, but found nothing.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then turned southwest, flying some distance until he sensed a chaotic mix of auras ahead.  At least several hundred individuals were gathered, their cultivations ranging from low to high, including Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang approached discreetly, merging into the crowd unnoticed.</p><p>He overheard snippets of conversation: “Su Zinan has been searching here for seven days with no results.  It seems he’ll return empty-handed again.”</p><p>“Indeed.  So many people searched for so many years, and eventually gave up.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, gazing into the distance, seeing flashes of treasure light and flickering figures upon the sea.</p>
