<h1>Chapter 738: Parting Ways</h1><p>Chapter 738: Parting Ways</p><p>After slaying the giant turtle, Qin Sang and Yuan San Zhenren, having joined forces with reinforcements, rescued some cultivators from the beast tide. However, faced with the ever-growing tide of beasts, they were ultimately overwhelmed and forced to retreat.</p><p>Returning to Tu Yuan Island, they learned that cultivators on the other islands had also noticed the anomaly and had already evacuated. Now, almost all the cultivators from the Five Elements Islands were gathered on Tu Yuan Island.</p><p>But after witnessing the horrifying scene on Mu Yuan Island, the cultivators had lost confidence in stopping the beast tide. After a discussion, they decided to make the painful decision to evacuate.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back at the place he had called home for over twenty years, filled with emotion.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, the discovery, occupation, and subsequent recapture of such small islands by cultivators and demonic beasts, respectively, was commonplace.</p><p>These islands, though lacking Yuan Ying masters, offered more opportunities; some met their demise, while others found fortuitous chances, rising to prominence.</p><p>Abandoning Five Elements Island saddened many cultivators; they were reluctant to leave.</p><p>"Daoist Master, I overheard Yuan San Zhenren and the others discussing the possibility of finding a new location and rebuilding Five Elements Island after leaving this sea region. What are your thoughts, Daoist Master? Should we join them?"</p><p>During the evacuation, the Wang sisters, having settled their subordinates, came to inquire about Qin Sang's plans.</p><p>Rebuilding Five Elements Island wouldn't be easy.  They would need to find an island with spiritual veins, capable of supporting so many cultivators. The surrounding demonic beasts couldn't be too strong, lest it become a tragic repetition of the past.</p><p>However, the cultivators of Five Elements Island were seasoned veterans, and Yuan San Zhenren and the others had sufficient influence to rally many.</p><p>Not long ago, Yuan San Zhenren had already asked Qin Sang's opinion, which he politely declined.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "This cultivator has only recently broken through and hasn't had time to consolidate his cultivation. Furthermore, the Seven Killing Hall will open in five years, and I plan to travel extensively during this time. I'm afraid I won't have the energy to participate in rebuilding Five Elements Island. If you sisters wish to stay, you are welcome to.  Both of you have broken through to the Core Formation stage; you are more than capable of handling things independently. You have stayed by my side for so long; it's been a hardship for you. I can write to Elder Zou and secure support from the Chamber of Commerce for you."</p><p>This decision had been made long ago.</p><p>Within a mere five years, significant improvement through arduous cultivation would be difficult. It would be more beneficial to travel and gain experience. Qin Sang himself had many unresolved issues and needed to gather information.</p><p>From the western border of the Wu Shen Continent to Wu Shen Mountain, then to Du Yan Island, Hun Tian Island, and finally Five Elements Island, Qin Sang had spent his time traveling and cultivating without truly experiencing the world.</p><p>Several issues plagued him.</p><p>Firstly, he still hadn't awakened Ya Gu.</p><p>While hunting demonic beasts and cultivating, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten to use the channels of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce to collect corpse-ghost techniques from both human and Wu tribes. He spared no expense, purchasing any relevant techniques, hoping to find a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and awaken Ya Gu.</p><p>Unfortunately, the circulating corpse-ghost techniques were either rudimentary and ineffective, insignificant fragments, or incredibly bold and insane, clearly fabrications and entirely impractical.</p><p>He had yet to find a solution.</p><p>The good news was that Ya Gu's primordial spirit remained remarkably stable. Even after decades, she hadn't sunk into darkness.</p><p>Whether it was the effect of the warm jade, the existence of the fat silkworm strengthening her primordial spirit, maintaining her connection to the mortal world, or a combination of both, remained unclear.</p><p>As the fat silkworm grew, this connection would become increasingly stable. As long as Ya Gu could maintain a tenacious will, clinging to this connection without losing herself, she would buy herself more time.</p><p>Qin Sang would also benefit from collecting these techniques.</p><p>His cultivation would grow stronger, but his Corpse Pill and Flying Night Rakshasa would become less effective due to their inability to improve, eventually becoming useless.</p><p>Both were products of the corpse technique, "Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture." Qin Sang hoped to improve the Flying Night Rakshasa's strength and enhance the Corpse Pill using other corpse techniques.</p><p>Another issue was his natal treasure, the ebony sword.</p><p>After breaking through to the mid-Core Formation stage, enhancing the ebony sword had become urgent, delaying it no longer. Otherwise, his cultivation would stagnate when he reached the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>The ebony sword was his bottleneck; only the ten greatest divine wood-grade spiritual woods could enhance it. Finding such treasures in the Cang Lang Sea was like searching for a needle in a haystack, but Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>Qin Sang chose to travel now to gather information and hopefully encounter opportunities to resolve these issues.</p><p>The Wang sisters' expressions turned somber upon hearing Qin Sang's words.</p><p>The two sisters exchanged a glance.  Wang Shi, the elder sister, spoke, “Thank you, Daoist Master. However, after discussing it, we sisters plan to return to the Inner Sea if you are unwilling to stay.  These years, we have been under your protection, both breaking through to the Golden Core stage and accumulating significant wealth, enough for a period of quiet cultivation.  Furthermore, our master is getting on in years, and we should return to care for her.”</p><p>Wang Xiang, lacking her usual playful demeanor, pouted and said, “Daoist Master, our master's secluded dwelling is on Lingchun Island, a truly beautiful place, with eternal spring. This is a chart of the Inner Sea. Please don't forget us. When you come to the Inner Sea, be sure to visit Lingchun Island.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the sea chart from the Wang sisters and nodded in response.</p><p>“In that case, when you take your leave of Old Man Zou, please offer my apologies for my absence.  Also, the Qiongyu Trading Company is quite reputable and has considerable influence in the Inner Sea. Unless your sect forbids it, there's no need to sever ties with them.  Maintaining that connection will provide additional opportunities.”</p><p>The Wang sisters nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Wang Xiang, eyeing Qin Sang's cloak, seemed eager to say something, but Wang Shi pulled her back. The two sisters turned and walked away, their figures gradually disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where they stood, watching the sisters leave.  He looked down at the sea chart in his hand, shook his head almost imperceptibly, and put it away.</p><p>After leaving the waters near Wuyuan Island and escaping the beast tide, the cultivators found a place to rest.  After bidding farewell to his acquaintances, Qin Sang quietly departed.</p><p>A few days later…</p><p>Qin Sang, riding a two-headed bird, arrived at a small island. After circling the island, he landed on a rocky beach.</p><p>His ebony sword transformed into a giant sword, digging a deep hole in the beach.  Qin Sang entered, sensed the spiritual energy within the cave, nodded in satisfaction, and then sealed the entrance, setting up a spirit array.</p><p>Having just broken through and then encountering a great battle, his cultivation was still unstable, his true essence agitated. Otherwise, killing those two great demons would have been easier.</p><p>Thinking of the great demons, Qin Sang flipped his palm, revealing a jade box containing a demon pill – the giant turtle's demon pill.</p><p>After killing the giant turtle, everyone divided the spoils.  Master Yuan San, grateful for Qin Sang’s assistance, insisted on giving his share to Qin Sang, adding some spirit stones as well, ensuring Qin Sang received the demon pill.</p>
