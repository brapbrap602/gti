<h1>Chapter 1508: Linglong (4k)</h1><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng soared into the sky, his wings gently vibrating.</p><p>The Golden-Winged Garuda was a spectacle of golden brilliance. With each tremor of his feathered pinions, golden waves surged forth, scattering a rain of resplendent golden light.</p><p>His two talons were as vast as canopies, their tips gleaming with a cold light, their sharpness surpassing any blade or sword.</p><p>The imposing aura of a Great Sage of the Demon Race was on full display.</p><p>Across the circular platform, Old Man Hunmo sensed his presence and raised his eyes.</p><p>Though his vision was obscured by the flames, he could perceive the Great Sage Heavenly Peng's rapidly ascending aura, and a deep apprehension surfaced in his eyes.</p><p>He no longer hesitated, raising a hand to lightly tap the back of his head.</p><p>The light behind his head twisted, becoming dim.</p><p>Then, a spectral shadow emerged from Old Man Hunmo's shoulder, the very same Ghost Spirit he nurtured.</p><p>The Ghost Spirit rolled its white eyes, staring fixedly at the center of the circular platform.</p><p>At this moment, Old Man Hunmo's lips moved slightly, either casting a spell or communicating with the Ghost Spirit.</p><p>The Ghost Spirit abruptly grinned, a shrill laugh escaping it, and its body spun rapidly, transforming into a wisp of pale ghostly energy. Like a spirit snake, it flickered and darted to the top of Old Man Hunmo's head, then plunged downwards, entering his body through the Baihui acupoint.</p><p>Old Man Hunmo's body trembled slightly, his complexion paling, his aura instantly taking on a chilling, sinister quality, as if he had just emerged from the Netherworld, his entire being steeped in ghostly energy.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>Chilling winds blew around them, a pervasive icy intent spreading.</p><p>A bizarre scene unfolded.</p><p>Old Man Hunmo's body grew darker and darker, as if the surrounding light was being inexplicably absorbed, and a shadow of unknown origin enveloped him.</p><p>The shadow grew increasingly dense and distinct, while Old Man Hunmo himself became blurred, indistinct.</p><p>Finally, the shadow almost solidified, taking on a human form, standing behind Old Man Hunmo, yet pressing tightly against his back.</p><p>At this moment, Old Man Hunmo became less conspicuous, the attention of others drawn to the shadow.</p><p>The shadow's features were seventy percent similar to Old Man Hunmo's, thirty percent to the Ghost Spirit's, its expression sinister and carrying a threefold ghostly aura, extremely discordant and eerie.</p><p>The shadow bent down, reaching out to grasp the chain.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Great Sage Heavenly Peng swooped down, extending his talons to tightly grip the chain.</p><p>They both had several demon and monster helpers by their sides.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>Old Man Hunmo and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng exerted their strength simultaneously.</p><p>The two ends of the chain abruptly tightened.</p><p>The other demons and monsters, having been forewarned, unleashed their signature techniques, striking precisely at the appropriate locations with perfect coordination.</p><p>The ancient restrictions within the circular platform were constantly under attack, and the seal was no longer as strong as it had been at the beginning. This tremor was the perfect opportunity.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Peng gripped the chain tightly, his wings flapping wildly, the feathers on his body standing erect, emitting piercing screeches that could penetrate eardrums.</p><p>Old Man Hunmo refused to be outdone, the shadow behind him twisting, almost collapsing, only his arms growing thicker, like two black pythons, tightly entwined around the chain.</p><p>'Crack! Crack! Crack...'</p><p>The chain was actually being forcibly lifted, segment by segment.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flames surged.</p><p>In an instant, a pillar of fire shot towards the heavens, its light dazzling, blinding those who looked directly at it, forcing them to squint.</p><p>However, the joy on everyone's faces grew, their movements unwavering.</p><p>The intense flames blazed, even threatening to burst out of the cavity.</p><p>Deep within the circular platform, the flames danced wildly, the power of the seal becoming increasingly chaotic.</p><p>At the bottom of the flames, the end of the chain gradually revealed a shadow. As the chain was pulled out inch by inch, the outline of the shadow became clearer, revealing a massive, angular object, comparable to a pavilion!</p><p>Seeing the outline of the treasure below through the chaotic spirit flames, Old Man Hunmo's gaze narrowed. He suddenly remembered something, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Whether some mechanism below had been triggered or the critical point of the seal had been broken, Old Man Hunmo and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng suddenly felt the chains in their hands lighten.</p><p>A muffled sound erupted from the depths of the cavity.</p><p>The sound was like thunder, and the earth shook.</p><p>The circular platform violently trembled.</p><p>No longer needing their pull.</p><p>Amidst the raging flames, the sound of the chains clanging loudly, a seven-colored stream of light broke free from its restraints, shooting out from the cavity, like a rainbow, extremely dazzling and resplendent.</p><p>Before anyone could admire the rainbow, their expressions changed.</p><p>The instant the seven-colored stream of light erupted, the boundless flames, unbound, surged towards the sky, instantly piercing through the thick clouds above.</p><p>A wave of fiery energy swept out, scouring in all directions!</p><p>The sudden change had occurred too quickly.</p><p>They were too close to the cavity, bearing the brunt of the impact, facing the fiery energy wave head-on.</p><p>Although the demons and monsters had hidden trump cards and prepared various methods to compete for the treasure, the flames within the cavity had accumulated energy for who knows how many years, and now it was all released at once. The power of the fiery energy wave was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>The flames carried the might to incinerate the heavens.</p><p>The terrifying impact was instantly upon them.</p><p>Everyone had no doubt that if they did not dodge, the consequence would be being burned to ashes.</p><p>At this moment, even Old Man Hunmo and the Great Sage Heavenly Peng dared not forcefully withstand the fiery energy wave to rush in and seize the treasure. They immediately pulled back and retreated rapidly.</p><p>'Bang, bang' sounds echoed continuously.</p><p>The circular platform abruptly transformed into a sea of fire. Amidst the raging flames, bizarre lights flashed repeatedly, the various demons and monsters displaying their unique abilities to resist the fiery energy wave. However, they could only protect themselves, constantly retreating.</p><p>In the center of the sea of fire, the rainbow, swift as a meteor, soared into the sky.</p><p>It was only when the two chains tightened, forcibly pulling it back, that it stopped its momentum, the rainbow light shifting and flowing, revealing the treasure within.</p><p>It was actually an exquisite, multi-tiered pagoda!</p><p>...</p><p>In the middle section of the deep valley.</p><p>After eliminating the yellow weasel, Qinsang became even more cautious.</p><p>However, he no longer detected anyone spying on them, nor did he encounter any traps set by the demons or monsters.</p><p>After the yellow weasel died, the Yellow-Brow Demon King would know that something had happened at the valley entrance, and the demons and monsters would surely be on guard, making it difficult for them to proceed.</p><p>But having come this far, there was no turning back. Qinsang and Liuli did not hesitate, deciding to continue deeper.</p><p>The deep valley was indeed filled with layers of restrictions, every step fraught with danger.</p><p>Even with the guidance of the Yang Puppet Crystal, locking onto the positions of the demons and monsters, their speed remained slow.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A forceful gust of wind struck them head-on.</p><p>Qinsang's expression remained unchanged. With a slight thought, the Golden-Dipped Sword hanging upside down above his head trembled slightly, 'whoosh whoosh whoosh,' instantly unleashing a dozen sword lights.</p><p>With a 'bang,' the attacker was struck head-on by the sword lights, sent flying several zhang, revealing its true form – another monster formed from beast bones.</p><p>At this time, Qinsang discovered that eight stone pillars had risen from the ground around them, three of which were destroyed, and the remaining five intact.</p><p>Each stone pillar originally had a ghost carved from beast bones sitting on it, in an extremely ferocious posture.</p><p>As they progressed, Qinsang and Liuli continuously encountered various beast bone arrays. The monsters in each bone array were different, ranging from dragons, beasts, and yakshas, a veritable dance of demons, unheard of and unseen.</p><p>Each beast bone array was incredibly profound, greatly broadening Qinsang's horizons.</p><p>These beast bone arrays were not all intact; some, like the one before them, were severely damaged. Qinsang also discovered many new traces, indicating that the bone arrays were not indestructible.</p><p>However, the group of demons and monsters were not so kind as to clear them one by one; leaving obstacles behind could hinder those who followed.</p><p>Qinsang and Liuli had become skilled at dealing with the monsters' attacks, but they still had to return the monsters to their original forms to escape; otherwise, they would be surrounded by an endless horde of monsters.</p><p>The first monster's sneak attack failed.</p><p>Four gray shadows immediately appeared around Qinsang and Liuli, pouncing frantically.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Golden-Dipped Sword trembled, transforming into thousands of swords.</p><p>Simultaneously, Liuli's phoenix-shaped precious sword transformed into a blue stream of light, swiftly moving between the sword lights of the Golden-Dipped Sword, coordinating to slay these monsters.</p><p>The two needed no communication; their swordsmanship coordinated seamlessly, and the monsters could not get close.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>From the depths of the clouds and mist came a thunderous sound, followed by a violent tremor of the ground. The monster that had been sent flying had just gotten to its feet when it stumbled, nearly falling.</p><p>Qinsang and Liuli's expressions changed slightly. They exchanged a glance, seeing the gravity in each other's eyes.</p><p>"What did that group of demons and monsters do inside? Has the treasure already emerged?"</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qinsang no longer held back. The surrounding sword lights dimmed, forming a sword array.</p><p>Just then, Qinsang and Liuli felt something and both looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky was filled with swirling clouds and mist, obscuring the sun.</p><p>Their vision should have been a vast expanse of white.</p><p>At this moment, a rainbow appeared, its light shining brilliantly.</p><p>From their position, although it appeared somewhat blurry, they could still see it.</p><p>Inside the rainbow light, the outline of an exquisite pagoda was revealed, faintly visible.</p><p>Seeing this pagoda, Liuli's expression remained unchanged, but Qinsang felt a strange sense of familiarity, suddenly remembering something. He was immediately filled with astonishment.</p><p>He immediately sent his divine sense into the Qianjun Ring, finding the item.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Two streams of light flew out, two crystal-clear pagodas.</p><p>They were the Seven-Storied Stupa and the Seven-Storied Pagoda that Qinsang had obtained from the Pure Sea Sect and the Profound Sky Palace, respectively!</p><p>Qinsang's actions attracted Liuli's attention.</p><p>Seeing the two small pagodas floating before Qinsang, Liuli was taken aback, instinctively looking up at the exquisite pagoda in the sky.</p><p>They were both seven-storied, both radiant with flowing light, magnificent and beautiful!</p><p>Although only the outline could be seen, it was clear that the three pagodas were almost identical. The two in Qinsang's hands were like miniature versions of the exquisite pagoda, shrunk down countless times.</p><p>If someone said there was no connection between these three pagodas, no one would believe it.</p><p>However, the exquisite pagoda had been hidden here all along, and the demons and monsters had just done something inside to bring it back into the world.</p><p>How could Qinsang have treasures related to the exquisite pagoda?</p><p>Liuli's gaze shifted to Qinsang's face, only to find that Qinsang was also full of surprise and confusion.</p><p>They were actually related to the stone tablet space!</p><p>The Seven-Storied Pagoda had always been treasured in the Profound Sky Palace's treasury, which was understandable.</p><p>The Seven-Storied Stupa he had obtained from the Pure Sea Sect, how could it be connected to the Profound Sky Palace's sacred ground?</p><p>Previously, no matter how Qinsang tried, the two small pagodas showed no change. Just now, they had been lying quietly in the Qianjun Ring, without the slightest abnormality.</p><p>Now, just as he took them out, Qinsang immediately noticed something was amiss.</p><p>Without him doing anything, the two small pagodas floated up on their own, their light growing brighter and brighter, emitting an unprecedented, strange fluctuation, as if resonating with the exquisite pagoda in the sky.</p><p>And between the two small pagodas, there was also a certain attraction. Slowly drawing closer, they began to revolve around each other at high speed.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The monsters were still frantically attacking the sword array.</p><p>Qinsang had no time to deal with them, watching the movements of the two small pagodas, also feeling somewhat wary.</p><p>He saw them spinning faster and faster, forming a vortex of light in the void.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The light vortex suddenly dissipated. The two small pagodas had actually merged into one before their eyes, becoming a single stupa. At the top of the tower was a precious pearl, emitting a faint seven-colored halo, identical to the exquisite pagoda.</p><p>The body of the tower trembled slightly, as if wanting to break through the air and fly towards the exquisite pagoda.</p><p>Qinsang was quick-witted. Although he did not yet understand the reason for this strange phenomenon, he grabbed the stupa. He felt a warm, cool sensation in his palm.</p><p>A surprising scene appeared.</p><p>When he grasped the stupa, and the seven-colored halo enveloped him and Liuli, the monsters that had been frantically attacking the sword array suddenly quieted down, losing their hostility. They all returned to the stone pillars, sitting in meditation, returning to silence.</p><p>The stone pillars sank into the ground, and the beast bone array disappeared.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qinsang looked at the stupa in his hand, then at the exquisite pagoda in the sky, already having some understanding in his heart. He immediately and without hesitation, shouted in a low voice, "Let's go!"</p><p>Liuli's reaction was no slower, immediately retracting her sword and taking flight.</p><p>The two figures, like lightning, instantly disappeared into the depths of the clouds and mist.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two遁lights sped through the deep valley.</p><p>Although the deep valley was not small, it was nothing to Nascent Soul cultivators, especially since they had already covered nearly half the distance.</p><p>If not for the ancient restrictions and the beast bone arrays limiting them, they would have already reached the circular platform and encountered the demons and monsters.</p><p>Now, under the protection of the stupa, they encountered no further obstacles.</p><p>Holding the stupa, Qinsang seemed to have become the master of the deep valley.</p><p>Every ancient restriction they encountered along the way, touched by the seven-colored halo, dissolved silently, as if nonexistent. The ground below was also extremely calm, without a single beast bone array springing up.</p><p>However, Qinsang could only passively accept the protection of the stupa, not knowing how to use it to do more, and time did not allow him to explore it carefully.</p><p>In an instant, Qinsang and Liuli were rapidly approaching the circular platform.</p><p>Qinsang, who was testing other functions of the stupa, sensed the astonishing force generated by the explosion of the fiery energy wave. He withdrew his mind and looked ahead.</p><p>With the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine power, Qinsang finally saw the circular platform and the surrounding scene.</p><p>The clouds and mist around the circular platform had dissipated, and a large area had turned into a sea of fire.</p><p>Two thick chains extended from the circular platform, pulling on the base of the exquisite pagoda.</p><p>From here, he could see more clearly that the exquisite pagoda was identical to the stupa in his hand, even the patterns on the body of the tower were exactly the same!</p><p>Qinsang's gaze swept quickly across the surroundings, finding the demons and monsters scattered and disheveled.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qinsang could also guess what had happened previously.</p><p>At this time, Qinsang also came into contact with the aura emanating from the flames.</p><p>This aura, upon touching the halo, also flowed to both sides, avoiding them. Not only could it not harm them in the slightest, it did not even provide the slightest obstruction.</p><p>The two of them were like entering a land without people!</p><p>The surprise in Qinsang and Liuli's eyes grew.</p><p>"Opportunity!"</p><p>Qinsang looked up at the entrance of the Linglong Pagoda, and this thought suddenly flashed through his mind!</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>The next chapter will be a little late, please don't stay up late, read it tomorrow morning.</p>
