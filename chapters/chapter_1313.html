Chapter 1305: The Death Jade

"Your sword formation seems to have some history, but it’s still not enough to break my corpse array here! Why not unleash the Demon Fire Banner? I wonder if this so-called number one treasure of the current era lives up to its reputation!" The Judge sneered.

Qin Sang remained unmoved, continuing to engage him with his sword formation while secretly communicating with Bai. Seeing Qin Sang's actions, the Judge, hidden in the shadows, felt an inexplicable unease. His main soul was housed within a refined corpse, and as he stared at Qin Sang, he couldn’t pinpoint the source of his discomfort.

The Sin Abyss had placed great importance on Qin Sang, having meticulously studied his abilities, especially after the battle at Twin Mirror Mountain, where Fairy Qiu Zhi had forced Qin Sang to reveal nearly all his techniques, including the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. In less than a year, Qin Sang’s strength shouldn’t have improved significantly.

"It’s here!" The Judge’s heart tightened as he saw the Demon Fire Banner spiraling out from Qin Sang’s sleeve. Without hesitation, he immediately activated a long-prepared secret technique. A series of shrill howls erupted from the corpse array, followed by clusters of faint blue light floating out from within. The blue light turned out to be balls of ghostly fire, a type of yin flame, rising gently and weightlessly.

*Whoosh!* The yin flames, upon contact with the corpse qi, instantly erupted into a sea of fire. The refined corpses within the array frantically spewed corpse qi, fueling the yin flames. The flames grew stronger and stronger, seemingly no weaker than the Nine Nether Demon Fire.

In the next moment, the demon fire surged forward! The two spiritual fires collided violently, sparks flying everywhere, and towering waves of fire rose into the sky, crashing toward each other with overwhelming force. Although the yin flames of the corpse array were formidable, they still fell short compared to the Nine Nether Demon Fire. However, the Judge had an advantage—he could fully control both the corpse array and the yin flames. He wasn’t directly confronting the Nine Nether Demon Fire; instead, he manipulated the yin flames with intricate variations, making them elusive and unpredictable, using this method to entangle with the demon fire.

The yin flames burned the corpse qi within the refined corpses, and soon, some of the corpses began to weaken, their ghostly eyes dimming as they collapsed to the ground. The Judge felt no regret; these sacrifices were necessary to stop Qin Sang. Immediately, new refined corpses were brought in to replace the fallen ones.

Only after truly experiencing the power of the demon fire did the Judge understand why so many of his comrades had fallen to Qin Sang.

*Boom!* The demon fire surged forward, unstoppable. At this rate, the Judge’s refined corpses were being consumed at an alarming speed.

Suddenly, a figure quietly appeared within the corpse array, its blood-red eyes coldly fixed on one of the refined corpses.

"Who’s there!" The Judge was shocked. How could there be a third person lurking here, infiltrating the corpse array without a sound, and accurately locating his main soul?

This person was none other than Bai. While the Judge and Qin Sang were locked in battle, Bai had been observing from the sidelines. He had discerned the mysteries of the corpse array, located the Judge’s main soul, and, taking advantage of the Judge’s distraction, had secretly merged into the array using a refined corpse.

In a panic, the Judge attempted to transfer his main soul to another refined corpse. Sensing this, Bai let out a cold snort and suddenly extended his hand. His hand was slightly emaciated, with long, slender nails resembling a ghostly claw, and it shot toward the back of the refined corpse without a moment’s delay.

*Thud!* His fingers sank deep into the corpse’s body. Immediately, a surge of corpse qi erupted from Bai, and black threads spread from his fingertips like a spider’s web, covering the entire corpse in an instant.

At the same time, Qin Sang seized the opportunity, fully activating the Demon Fire Banner. The demon fire surged violently, breaking through the yin flames’ blockade, and a black sea of fire engulfed the corpse array.

*Whoosh…* Wherever the waves of fire passed, the refined corpses turned to ash on the spot.

With the corpse array destroyed, the refined corpse housing the Judge’s main soul trembled violently. The Judge could no longer care about the array and could only fight back desperately. A dark beam shot from between his eyebrows, aiming straight for Bai’s face.

*Thump!* To the Judge’s despair, the beam struck a shield—Bai had borrowed the Tortoise Shell Shield from Qin Sang in advance.

*Rip!* The refined corpse’s body was torn in half by Bai, and a ball of yellow light leapt from the corpse’s head, attempting to flee. Bai swiftly grabbed it.

Within the yellow light, a pale face appeared—it was the Judge himself, his expression filled with terror as he stared at Bai.

Qin Sang was delighted to have captured a live prisoner. He put away the Demon Fire Banner and quickly moved closer. The Judge was skilled in corpse refinement techniques; perhaps they could extract some valuable information from him.

But then, something unexpected happened. The yellow light flickered, and the Judge’s face shattered like a mirror. Bai let out a soft exclamation and reached into the light, but he was too late. The Judge, his face twisted with resentment, completely dissipated.

"This guy has more than one main soul," Bai frowned, clenching his fist. The nearly dissipated yellow light was compressed into a ball, along with a jade pendant engraved with the character for "death," which fell into Bai’s palm.

...

In Yu City, the Qi-named cultivator was issuing orders when he suddenly heard a scream. Beside him, a black-robed cultivator collapsed to the ground, spitting out a mouthful of foul-smelling black blood.

"Fellow Daoist, you..." The Qi-named cultivator remembered that it was the Judge who had been tasked with stopping Qin Sang.

The Judge struggled to sit up, his voice hoarse, "I can no longer sense my second main soul."

"What? Your corpse array is incredibly profound; the refined corpses couldn’t have been exhausted so quickly. Did he use some method to block your senses?" someone exclaimed in shock.

The Judge’s expression darkened, and he angrily said, "It’s not a block—my main soul has perished. It didn’t transmit any message before dying, and I have no idea how it was destroyed so quickly. The Death Jade used to control the corpse array has also fallen into his hands! It will take me decades to recover!"

The others grew even more horrified, feeling a sense of helplessness. "Unless he’s also a master of corpse refinement, how could he have broken through to the Nascent Soul stage in just a few years?"

In their eyes, Qin Sang had become even more unfathomable. Just when they thought they had figured him out, he always managed to surprise them.

"Fellow Daoist Qi, the secret must have been leaked by that scoundrel Qu Huan. The fellow Daoists tasked with intercepting Daoist Zhenyi are also struggling. The True One has yet to return, and we can only abandon the outer city to avoid greater losses. Most of our resources have already been moved to the inner city. It’s time to make a decision," a beautiful female cultivator advised.

The Qi-named cultivator, though reluctant, took a deep breath and glanced toward the city walls before slowly nodding.

...

Qin Sang toyed with the Death Jade, guessing it was likely the treasure used to control the corpse array. The Judge had not only lost his main soul but also the Death Jade—a devastating loss.

It was a pity they hadn’t captured a live prisoner. Qin Sang turned to Bai, who was holding the condensed ball of yellow light. A surge of corpse qi poured into it, emitting a peculiar fluctuation before the ball of light flashed and merged into Bai’s body. Bai’s corpse qi solidified noticeably.

Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. "I forgot to ask, Brother Bai, how do you plan to cultivate from now on?"

Bai twisted his neck, looking quite content. "Like other Corpse Kings, I’ll find a place rich in yin energy and absorb it. But there’s a faster way—directly refining the most yin-heavy earth evil energy."
