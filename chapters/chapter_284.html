<h1>Chapter 277: Daoist Qingfeng</h1><p>Wandering Scholar also spoke with Qin Sang, explaining that the mystical yellow aura wasn't unique to the Striped Yellow Essence. The chance of finding Striped Yellow Essence beneath that aura was only fifty percent.  Other colored auras might also indicate similar spiritual herbs. Wandering Scholar promised that no matter the herb, as long as it could heal internal injuries, he would assist Qin Sang in gathering it and refine it into medicine free of charge.</p><p>In return, Qin Sang would have to reciprocate, aiding Wandering Scholar when needed.</p><p>Wandering Scholar suspected these spiritual herbs might be guarded by spirit beasts. Even if they reached the location, harvesting the herbs wouldn't be easy and would require joint effort.</p><p>This request was reasonable, and Qin Sang naturally agreed.</p><p>However, before that, their primary concern was how to find this suspected medicinal garden.</p><p>The discovery of this place was quite a story.</p><p>It was originally the cave dwelling of an ancient cultivator, located between Nine Serenity Pass and Hanging Skull Pass, in the border region between the inner and middle zones, beyond the reach of the major sects, and a chaotic land since ancient times.</p><p>The unearthing of the cave dwelling caused a great commotion, attracting many, including Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>However, after breaking the outer restrictions, they found the cave empty, devoid of treasures. Everyone returned empty-handed.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions were intact.  Later, a cultivator repaired them and established a market there, named Autumn Goose Market.</p><p>Due to its isolated location, with no other markets or towns nearby, and its strong defensive restrictions, Autumn Goose Market stood for decades, becoming a safe haven.  Its popularity and traffic steadily increased.</p><p>Until one year, a celestial phenomenon occurred.  Unexpectedly, a large swarm of Cloud Beasts, comparable to Core Formation cultivators, emerged from the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and wandered to Autumn Goose Market, destroying it. The market's owner was killed by the Cloud Beasts.  Only then did everyone discover a hidden secret within Autumn Goose Market!</p><p>Deep within the market, concealed by a larger protective formation, lay the true cave dwelling!  That was the true treasure trove of the ancient cultivator!</p><p>Because the cave dwelling's initial discovery had caused such a stir, many knew of its existence.  The market's owner couldn't claim it for himself.  Instead, he devised a plan, spending a fortune to repair the outer restrictions, using the market as a cover while secretly working to break the protective formation.</p><p>After the protective formation was revealed, countless treasure hunters flocked to Autumn Goose Market. But the formation was perilous, and many died trying to enter.</p><p>Eventually, they deciphered the formation's pattern: every thirty years, it weakened. During this period, Foundation Establishment cultivators could form formations and enter together, with a high chance of success.</p><p>Over the years, groups of cultivators came and went. But this secret passage had never been discovered before.</p><p>The image on the jade pendant was a recording made by the first person to discover the passage. However, this person died mysteriously after leaving, and the news never spread.</p><p>Until two years ago, rumors of a secret passage and a medicinal garden began to circulate, gaining some traction, though most dismissed them.</p><p>After all, every corner of Autumn Goose Market, except for a few key areas, had been thoroughly searched countless times.  If any secret passages or treasures existed, they would have been found long ago.</p><p>Moreover, these rumors weren't new.  They surfaced not just when Autumn Goose Market was first discovered but almost every time similar events occurred.  Opportunists would spread all sorts of rumors, attempting to profit from the chaos.</p><p>Wandering Scholar, believing that no opportunity should be missed, investigated personally. By chance, he saw the image on the jade pendant and confirmed the rumor's potential validity.</p><p>Since the person who left the jade pendant was dead, Wandering Scholar didn't know the passage's exact location and needed another approach.</p><p>After a thorough investigation, Wandering Scholar suspected that the person's death was related to their companions from thirty years prior, who had entered Autumn Goose Market together.  He narrowed his focus to three individuals.</p><p>These three were also planning to enter during the formation's weakening period, currently gathering people and practicing formations.</p><p>Their first task was to infiltrate these three individuals' group before the formation weakened, observe them, and identify the killer.</p><p>Therefore, besides Qin Sang and Wandering Scholar, there was one other person.</p><p>The three of them would act separately.</p><p>After setting his target, he would look for opportunities to make contact.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang put away the jade pendant. In ten days, he was to meet Wandering Scholar as agreed and head to Autumn Wilds Market, looking for a chance to infiltrate one of the groups.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed his current state.  The Ebony Sword's power had increased after absorbing the Blackflame Camphorwood.  The Ten Yama King Flag and the Jade Ruyi Talisman were his trump cards. Coupled with the mostly recovered Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, with these treasures, as long as he was cautious, Qin Sang wasn't worried about his safety.</p><p>However, some of these items couldn't be exposed to the light. After using them, he would need to be prepared to silence any witnesses.</p><p>Before that, it was best to conceal his identity.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang left the cave, sealed the restrictions, and headed straight for Skull Gorge Pass.  He spent some spirit stones replenishing a few magical tools, making thorough preparations.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Wandering Scholar arrived as promised.</p><p>"Brother Qin, there's news from that sideâ€¦"</p><p>Wandering Scholar said hurriedly, "The weakening of Autumn Wilds Market's grand formation will be delayed.  It might be pushed back by one or two years. There might be even more people entering the market then. But a longer timeframe makes it easier to gain their trust, which might not be a bad thing for us. However, Brother Qin, you must be cautious.  Even if you confirm the target's identity, don't act rashly before Fellow Daoist Ge Yuan and I arrive."</p><p>Wandering Scholar was still a bit worried about Qin Sang and gave him repeated warnings.</p><p>Ge Yuan was the third person they were collaborating with, someone Qin Sang hadn't met yet.</p><p>This person was currently lying low in West Wasteland Town, the town closest to Autumn Wilds Market, keeping track of the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang also knew the importance of this matter. Infiltrating the enemy group alone and acting rashly wasn't wise and could lead to being surrounded.</p><p>"Rest assured, Senior, I understand the gravity of the situation and will be careful."</p><p>Wandering Scholar hummed in agreement. "Good that you understand, Brother Qin. By the way, have you decided on a disguise?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "From now on, Senior, please call me Daoist Clearwind."</p>
