<h1>Chapter 631: Winged Viper Village</h1><p>“Dumb Girl, you’ve suffered so much.  This is your reward, the blessing of the Witch God, meeting His messenger. It’s what you deserve.  Follow him, and never come back.”</p><p>The old man gazed at the empty window, his eyes vacant, murmuring to the bleak twilight.</p><p>…</p><p>Winged Viper Village.</p><p>This was the largest and strongest village in the area, the only one with cultivators, an unquestioned overlord with absolute power of life and death.</p><p>There was even a Foundation Establishment stage old priest, whose status was considerable even in the entire Xiong Mountain region.</p><p>Winged Viper Village was nestled at the foot of a majestic mountain peak.  Lush forests covered the mountain, while a large lake, connected to the largest tributary of the Green Robe River, lay at its base.</p><p>The lake’s surface was mirror-like, exceptionally clear, like the eye of the earth.</p><p>The village was built around the south bank of the lake.  A variety of wooden and bamboo buildings clustered together, far more luxurious than the stilt houses of Thousand Households Village.  The villagers lived comfortably, protected by cultivators, truly the elite among commoners.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>The village was brightly lit. Many people frolicked by the lake, some even played in the water, adults and children alike.</p><p>No one noticed a figure appear silently in the center of the lake.</p><p>The strongest expert in Winged Viper Village was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.  Qin Sang could have easily entered and wiped out the village’s cultivators without a hitch.</p><p>But he didn’t.</p><p>As the saying goes, it’s better to teach someone to fish than to give them a fish; to save someone, one must first uplift their spirit.</p><p>Hovering in the lake's heart, Qin Sang unleashed his spiritual sense without restraint.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang’s eyes lit up. He had finally found Dumb Girl.</p><p>She and the other ‘holy maidens’ were confined in a wooden building on the south bank of the lake, seemingly unharmed. The building was divided into many rooms, each ‘holy maiden’ having her own private chamber.</p><p>Two robust women, in reality guards, were inside each room.</p><p>A team of highly skilled guards stood at the entrance, making escape impossible.</p><p>The holy maidens' rooms were extraordinarily lavish, filled with the scent of burning incense, which emitted a peculiar fragrance.</p><p>Dumb Girl sat on the bed, staring blankly at the Qingfu coins in her hand. The two women watched her like wolves, as if afraid she might flee.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. He thought the coins were lost or taken by the village priest.  Why hadn't she used them to call for help?</p><p>Seeing that Dumb Girl wasn't suffering, Qin Sang relaxed. He hadn’t found any cultivators in the village, nor any anomalies in the lake's depths.</p><p>Looking towards the mountaintop, Qin Sang vanished into thin air.</p><p>After scaling several mountains, he discovered a hidden world deep within the mountain range.</p><p>A verdant peak, a waterfall cascading down a cliff, into a small lake below.  Several elegant bamboo buildings were constructed around it.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was quite dense, not inferior to the Black-winged Eagle's lair—a cultivator's dreamland.</p><p>No wonder there were no priests below; they were all here.</p><p>“They certainly know how to enjoy themselves!”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly glanced at the bamboo buildings, easily discerning the identities of the Winged Viper Village priests inside, who were completely oblivious to the outside world.</p><p>In one bamboo building, two young men idly drank wine.  Their faces were adorned with colorful, strange tattoos signifying their priestly status.</p><p>One, with a slick appearance, gulped down wine, sighing, “Sigh, every Witch God Festival, the ancestor forbids us from going out, afraid we’ll harm the holy maidens.  These are the most spiritually pure girls selected from various villages, fresh and tender, further purified by special incense and spirit creature feeding. We can’t enjoy them, yet they’re fed to snakes. What a waste!”</p><p>The other, somewhat more reserved, responded, “Be careful!  If the ancestor hears you, he’ll severely punish you. We are the Witch God’s messengers. What kind of girls can’t we get? Insect Gu are the foundation of our existence. We extract the purest Yin energy from these girls to refine Huahong Pills and feed the winged vipers to enhance our insect Gu. Is your own pleasure more important than our life-bound Gu?”</p><p>“Alright, alright…”</p><p>The slick young man impatiently waved his hand, “Don’t treat me like a fool.  I know what’s going on.  We work so hard to cultivate, with a slim chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, yet we’re confined here, unable to enjoy ourselves. Just thinking about it makes me frustrated. I’d rather be a village chief and live a carefree life!”</p><p>He took a sip of wine and sighed, “It’s a pity that Red Leaf Grass, the main ingredient of Huahong Pills, only yields a few stems annually. We can’t refine many pills.”</p><p>"Otherwise, we could capture the girls from those villages, refine them into pills, and give them to our little darling.  Maybe that would directly boost him to the second transformation, saving us all this hard work?"</p><p>The slick young man spread open his palm, revealing a winged serpent.</p><p>The serpent was pure white, slender, about as long as his finger, but its tongue and eyes were bright red, incredibly eerie.</p><p>This was a winged viper, a type of spirit insect, and the namesake insect of the Winged Viper Village priest.</p><p>The slick youth dripped a drop of spirit wine onto his palm. The winged viper, docile, lapped it up.</p><p>Another man shook his head and chuckled, "What good is the transformation of a namesake insect? If you can't improve your own cultivation, aren't you afraid of backlash?"</p><p>...</p><p>Seeing the name "Winged Viper Village," Qin Sang guessed the priest's insect.</p><p>Winged vipers thrive on yin energy, are masters of concealment, and produce a potent, intensely cold poison that slows down one's spiritual energy, severely weakening them.</p><p>Keeping these insects is great for surprise attacks and poisonings.</p><p>While not ranked on the Extraordinary Insect List due to its limited three transformations, it ranks 473rd on the Witch Insect List, higher than the Ghost-headed Bee.</p><p>Villages like Winged Viper Village, where generations of priests use the same insect, surely have unique cultivation methods.  The "Flower Red Pill" these two mentioned is likely the result.</p><p>...</p><p>Red candles illuminated the room.</p><p>The mute girl stared at the money, her gaze unblinking, lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, the two strong women at the door collapsed.</p><p>Startled, the mute girl jumped up. She saw someone standing by the bed and gasped.</p><p>"One-armed Brother, your injury is healed...?"</p><p>She recognized Qin Sang.</p><p>Her eyes lit up with a beautiful smile.</p><p>But then her expression darkened, her face filled with urgency. "One-armed Brother, you must leave! Don't worry about me!  There are Witch God messengers in Winged Viper Village…"</p><p>"Silly girl, are you afraid I can't defeat the Winged Viper Village priest, that you're afraid of implicating me, so you won't ask for help?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "You forget, I told you I'm very powerful."</p><p>The mute girl remained uneasy, "But there are so many Witch God messengers in Winged Viper Village…"</p><p>"So what? They're all trash!  They harmed you.  Dare you strike them down?"</p><p>Qin Sang held out his cold-iron sword, offering it to the mute girl.</p>
