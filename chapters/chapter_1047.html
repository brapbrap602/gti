<h1>Chapter 1039: Snatching Food from the Tiger's Mouth </h1><p>She thought she and Elder Yue were on the same side, so she didn't dare ask for help.</p><p>No wonder she felt the relationship between Su Nü and Elder Yue was strange.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scene when he left the Demonic Island and encountered the cultivators of the Western幽 Alliance.</p><p>When the Western幽 Alliance saw that Su Nü could control True Demonic Qi, they immediately tried to seize her.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, knowing my origins, you should understand why I am wary of the Eastern Apex Alliance, right? I am like a specially refined object. Moreover, the cultivation technique I practice is not a normal one. It's slowly changing me, terrifying me, making me restless day and night! After entering the Seven Kill Hall, this unease has intensified, even making me tremble."</p><p>Su Nü finally met someone she could confide in, and didn't hide her emotions at all.</p><p>From Su Nü’s words, Qin Sang connected many fragmented pieces of information.</p><p>“Five Yin Exquisite Body, True Demonic Qi, True Demonic Arts, Ancient Demons, the Western幽 Alliance, the Eastern Apex Alliance… what secrets are hidden within all this…”</p><p>Qin Sang had a premonition that he seemed to have touched upon some astonishing secret.</p><p>"If I were in your position, I would also be wary of the Eastern Apex Alliance."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, but he didn't fully believe her.</p><p>The cultivation world was full of old monsters who had lived for hundreds of years, and there were countless good actors.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't figure out why Su Nü would fabricate such a long story to deceive him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do you think Venerable Ye sneaking here has something to do with you, and that he wants to save himself?  Is he willing to give up the Soul Cleansing Liquid in exchange for me doing something for you? Facing Venerable Ye, I'm afraid I won't be able to do much."</p><p>Qin Sang asked a series of questions.</p><p>If he were asked to save someone from a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor, he wouldn't even consider it.</p><p>“I've been thinking about saving myself and escaping from the Eastern Apex Alliance every moment, and I'll do anything for it!"</p><p>Su Nü’s tone was resolute, but then she became somewhat discouraged and said miserably, “Didn't they plant a mark on me precisely because they were afraid I would escape? If it weren't for Venerable Ye, I might still have a chance to save myself. Now I can only hope for external help. If Fellow Daoist agrees, please take this Ghost Seal. After leaving the Bewildering Caves, don't rush to leave the Trial Grounds. Use the Ghost Seal's guidance and follow me. If I encounter trouble, activate the power of the Ghost Seal with all your might from a distance. Fellow Daoist, don't worry, you won't be implicated. If there are no incidents, Fellow Daoist can leave on your own. If I survive, I will definitely offer you the Soul Cleansing Liquid with both hands!"</p><p>“That simple?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, seeing a small ghost head seal held between the Earth Spirit’s fingers.</p><p>The Ghost Seal was small, and the ghost head looked like an evil ghost sealed inside.  Its function couldn't be discerned from its appearance alone.</p><p>"I don't know how effective it will be, but it's worth a try," Su Nü said with a wry smile.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and remained silent.</p><p>In fact, he already believed Su Nü's words seven or eight parts out of ten.</p><p>With so many people vying for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Su Nü had no reason to fabricate such a story just to deceive him.</p><p>Whether the masked man was Venerable Ye and whether Su Nü was lying would soon be verified.</p><p>But he didn't immediately agree to Su Nü’s request.</p><p>He had other plans in mind.</p><p>Making a deal with Su Nü and obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid was predicated on his ability to rescue her.</p><p>Going through such a big detour had too many potential variables, and he needed to find the ancient teleportation formation after leaving the Trial Grounds; he didn't have time to get entangled with Su Nü.</p><p>Compared to that, he wanted a sure thing!</p><p>"I can make a deal with Fellow Daoist, but we can change the terms."</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. "Of course, this is based on the premise that Fellow Daoist is telling the truth and not deceiving me!"</p><p>“Deceiving Fellow Daoist wouldn't benefit me at all, especially since Fellow Daoist is my savior," Su Nü practically swore an oath, her tone urgent. "My divine sense is about to dissipate.  Fellow Daoist, what are your conditions? Don't keep me in suspense. As long as I can do it…”</p><p>"I want you to help me compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid here! Regardless of success or failure, I can help you."</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>“What? You want to compete with Venerable Ye for the Soul Cleansing Liquid?”</p><p>Su Nü exclaimed.</p><p>"Exactly. If what you said is true, Venerable Ye can only temporarily unseal his cultivation and is also injured. We don't necessarily need to be too afraid. I have a method that can threaten a Nascent Soul cultivator, and we might not be without a chance of success."</p><p>Opportunities are fought for.</p><p>Qin Sang relied on his Thunder Manipulation Technique, the Demonic Banner, and his excellent escape techniques, and believed he could be the one to reap the benefits.</p><p>“Venerable Ye definitely won't expect someone to even give up the Soul Cleansing Liquid. What he said should be true. However, being able to threaten a Nascent Soul cultivator doesn't mean Venerable Ye is truly afraid of you! I know Venerable Ye better than anyone. Nascent Soul cultivators are unfathomable. Who can say for sure if he has other means?"</p><p>Su Nü refused without hesitation. "Even with his cultivation sealed, Venerable Ye is still a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor. He far surpasses us in other aspects. Fellow Daoist, please don’t overestimate yourself. I won’t take this risk with you.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "Naturally, I will ensure everything is foolproof before I act. And I won't expose Fellow Daoist. Aren’t you supposed to manipulate the formation to receive Venerable Ye? As long as Fellow Daoist can find a way to delay them for a moment, that will be enough.”</p><p>"In that case…"</p><p>Su Nü hesitated. “I can try.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, grabbed the Ghost Seal, and made an oath. "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, I value my life more than you do, and I won't be reckless. Even if we fail to seize the Soul Cleansing Liquid, our deal can still continue."</p><p>"I hope Fellow Daoist will keep your promise."</p><p>The Earth Spirit’s eyes stared fixedly at Qin Sang, quickly losing their luster. It collapsed to the ground and began to dissolve.</p><p>Their conversation seemed lengthy, but it didn't actually take much time.</p><p>Ming Wei wanted to speak but stopped herself. She didn't know who Qin Sang was communicating with or what they were talking about. Now she relied more on Qin Sang and didn't dare to speak rashly.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Ghost Seal, feeling a chill in his palm.</p><p>He stared intently at the Soul Cleansing Liquid and the seal, took a deep breath, and his mind raced, sorting through various clues.</p><p>Whether Su Nü’s words were true or false, he had to be on guard.</p><p>Noticing Ming Wei’s gaze, Qin Sang transmitted his voice, “There’s good news and bad news.”</p><p>Ming Wei was stunned, then heard,</p><p>“The good news is that someone will help us clear out those competitors. The bad news is that the person clearing the obstacles might be a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor!”</p><p>Ming Wei's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, don’t ask where this news came from, and don’t ask if it’s true or not. In any case, we have to prepare early and must work together to have any chance of obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid.”</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Compete for treasure with a Nascent Soul cultivator?"</p><p>Ming Wei looked at him like he was crazy, almost turning to leave.</p><p>“I’m not crazy enough to antagonize a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor. But Fellow Daoist, don’t forget this is the Trial Grounds, which has limitations for Nascent Soul Grand Ancestors…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. “If Fellow Daoist dares to stay, follow my previous proposal, and you won't be taking too much of a risk.”</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Being in debt feels bad.</p><p>I took the car back today, feeling that if this continues, it will drag on more and more.  I gritted my teeth, stayed up all night, and wrote four chapters, finally catching up on the owed updates!</p><p>Hoping I can slack off at work +_+</p>
