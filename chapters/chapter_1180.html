<h1>Chapter 1172: True Form</h1><p>"Hiss... hiss..."</p><p>A strange sound echoed in Qin Sang's ears, seeming to come from everywhere at once.</p><p>The Serpent King, Qianji, seemed to have vanished.</p><p>In Qin Sang's vision, serpentine shadows danced wildly, constantly shifting and changing.</p><p>Though he could clearly distinguish the real from the illusory among the serpent shadows and was not deceived by the illusions, dealing with them calmly was no easy task.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>Countless serpent shadows suddenly converged, and a fierce wind stirred the black mist, forming a massive serpent shadow resembling a tornado. Without a moment's pause, it twisted and lunged forward!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave. These were not mere illusions but the afterimages left by the Serpent King's punches moving at an extreme speed. All the afterimages merged into one, and their power seemed to stack, indicating a formidable combat technique!</p><p>The serpent shadow had grown countless times larger than before and was rapidly closing in. Its speed was so fast that it seemed to break the sound barrier, the sharp, piercing sound echoing between the mountain peaks, penetrating eardrums and shaking the mind.</p><p>A fierce wind rushed toward Qin Sang.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang felt as though he was suffocating.</p><p>The Serpent King's movements were too fast, leaving Qin Sang with very little time to react.</p><p>He swiftly retreated, and at the same time, the spiritual sword hovering around him suddenly moved to block in front of Qin Sang. A faint green sword light flickered at the tip of the blade, the only glimmer of light in the black mist.</p><p>"Hum!"</p><p>Amid the deafening echoes, the sword's hum was almost inaudible.</p><p>However, both Qin Sang and the Serpent King could clearly see that the sword light on the blade instantly surged, forming a dazzling beam of light, its momentum no less imposing than that of the Serpent King.</p><p>In the end, it even pierced through the black mist, shooting straight into the heavens!</p><p>Before the Serpent King could react, countless illusory sword lights burst forth from the beam.</p><p>The sword lights split apart.</p><p>Sword rain fell.</p><p>Countless sword lights dazzled the eyes, slashing down upon the serpent shadow.</p><p>The Serpent King was formidable. Faced with such a barrage of sword strikes, he showed no intention of retreating, instead pressing forward with determination!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The first sword light plunged into the serpent shadow, vanishing in an instant.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could vaguely see that at the moment the sword light struck, a black shadow on the serpent's body twisted, entangling the sword light until both were annihilated.</p><p>Similar scenes repeated themselves, one after another, as sword lights were extinguished by the Serpent King's hands, and the serpent shadow rapidly shrank in size. Yet, it still charged forward fiercely, unhindered.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, changing his sword technique.</p><p>The spiritual sword trembled, and the beam of light condensed into a massive sword, slashing down upon the serpent shadow!</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Another straightforward collision, but this time the impact was far more terrifying.</p><p>The ground shook, and rocks tumbled down from the mountain peaks on either side.</p><p>The sword light and the serpent shadow "bit" into each other, devouring one another, locked in a stalemate. As the attack was halted, the Serpent King's figure emerged, and he suddenly let out a cold snort, shifting several feet to the side.</p><p>In the next moment, a figure appeared where the Serpent King had just stood.</p><p>Qin Sang, multitasking, had attempted to seize the opportunity to strike, but he had missed.</p><p>He was not surprised. Licking his lips, he summoned the spiritual sword back to his hand and, together with the sword, launched a counterattack, shifting from defense to offense!</p><p>This was true unity of man and sword.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his wings, transforming into a bolt of lightning, flying side by side with the spiritual sword. His figure merged into the countless sword lights, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, elusive and mysterious.</p><p>"Bang! Bang!"</p><p>The Serpent King hastily countered, momentarily thrown into disarray, and was forced to retreat step by step under Qin Sang's relentless assault.</p><p>Though Qin Sang was not as skilled in close combat as the Serpent King, his top-tier swordsmanship more than made up for his shortcomings. The sword moved as he willed, seamless and precise.</p><p>The Serpent King had likely never encountered such a rogue swordsman before and was initially somewhat bewildered. However, as a renowned demon king, he quickly devised a countermeasure.</p><p>The black mist churned violently, surging toward Qin Sang.</p><p>The sense of obstruction grew increasingly apparent, but Qin Sang remained calm. Secretly, he formed a hand seal, and within his sleeve, three demon banners were activated, shooting out a stream of demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire was not aimed at the Serpent King but instead landed on Qin Sang himself, quickly spreading and solidifying into a suit of fiery armor.</p><p>Upon contact with the demonic fire, the black mist was instantly incinerated, emitting a strange odor. Though the demonic fire could not completely burn away the black mist, under its protection, Qin Sang's vulnerability was minimized.</p><p>Seeing this, the Serpent King's expression changed slightly. A cold glint flashed in his eyes, and his body twisted, transforming into a massive demonic serpent over ten feet long.</p><p>The serpent reared up, towering over Qin Sang, its gaze cold and piercing.</p><p>Its scales were not pure black but closer to gray, with black spots scattered across its body. This was the infamous demonic serpent—the Black-Spotted King Serpent!</p><p>"True form?"</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly on guard.</p><p>When a demonic beast revealed its true form, it was at its most powerful.</p><p>Indeed, as the Serpent King transformed, the situation shifted from Qin Sang's earlier dominance.</p><p>Though the serpent's massive body appeared cumbersome, it was incredibly agile, and its scales were extremely tough. The few sword lights that struck its body sparked upon impact, unable to penetrate its defenses.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The serpent dodged an attack with a swift movement, then lashed out with its tail, striking fiercely.</p><p>As Qin Sang dodged, the serpent's figure flickered, splitting into three. Two illusions darted to either side, surrounding Qin Sang.</p><p>Three massive serpents loomed above, their six cold eyes fixed intently on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Even without the aid of his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he could easily discern which two were illusions, but he still felt a faint sense of threat from them.</p><p>"An unknown divine ability..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as the three serpents moved.</p><p>"Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang dared not hesitate. He immediately recalled his spiritual sword and pointed into the air, sending a series of hand seals toward the blade. In an instant, radiant light filled the surroundings!</p><p>Seven sword spirits materialized first, followed by countless slender sword lights branching out, using the sword spirits as their framework. They quickly formed a sword formation that slowly rotated above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Now, the sword formation Qin Sang wielded looked vastly different from before his Nascent Soul breakthrough.</p><p>Each sword light was a foot long, incredibly solid, and identical to the spiritual sword itself.</p><p>The spiritual sword trembled lightly, and the sword lights resonated in harmony.</p><p>This was the Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation. Though Qin Sang had yet to fully comprehend its true mysteries, its power far surpassed his previous capabilities!</p><p>As the sword formation took shape, the three serpents lunged forward simultaneously.</p><p>Before the true attack arrived, a terrifying force transmitted through the air, distorting the void. Qin Sang felt as though his body was being constricted by a real serpent, subjected to three different forces tearing and crushing him.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully broke free from the binding force, formed a sword seal, and unleashed a sky-shaking killing intent. Countless sword shadows vanished into thin air, only to reappear moments later, surrounding the three serpents and enveloping them within the sword formation!</p><p>He was not worried about revealing his human identity. The pure demonic energy within him, the genuine wings of the Azure Phoenix, and the Heavenly Demon manifestation behind his head—no one who saw these would dare claim he was not a demon.</p><p>In fact, even among true shape-shifting demon kings, those who could comprehend the ancestral manifestations were exceedingly rare. Faced with Qin Sang, they might even feel a sense of inferiority.</p>
