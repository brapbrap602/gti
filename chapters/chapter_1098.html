<h1>Chapter 1900: The Aftermath</h1><p>“Senior…”</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached.</p><p>Qing Zhu's aura was extremely faint.</p><p>He wanted to help Qing Zhu, but Qing Zhu waved him off.</p><p>Qing Zhu opened his eyes, his gaze sharp. He glanced at Qin Sang, then at the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord looked Qing Zhu up and down, their eyes flickering, but neither spoke.</p><p>The blood coffin was suppressed. With the three Demon Subduing Treasures gathered, the seal, infused with sword energy, plunged into the black hole.</p><p>The crimson crystalline wall dissolved, and the space verged on collapse.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang heard Qing Zhu's voice, “Bring them over.”</p><p>Before her demise, Fairy Nangui had asked Qing Zhu to protect her descendants, lest they fall into the hands of Ling Zhuzi or the Demon Lord.</p><p>Seeing that Qing Zhu's condition seemed better than expected, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He flashed over, helped the young man and woman up, retrieved spirit pills from their storage pouches, and had them consume the pills before leading them to Qing Zhu.</p><p>The two managed to suppress their injuries and regain their mobility, whispering their thanks to Qin Sang.</p><p>Passing by Sunu, Qin Sang bent down to check on her and discovered, to his surprise, that she was still alive.</p><p>Perhaps due to the Demon Lord’s control over the Ghost Mark, Sunu was inadvertently protected by it and survived the demonic roar.</p><p>Seeing Sunu covered in Ghost Marks, Qin Sang hesitated. He glanced at the Demon Lord in the distance, the Ghost Seal still in his hand.</p><p>Half of the Demon Lord's body appeared normal, while the other half was withered and lifeless.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, focusing on suppressing his injuries. His condition seemed no better than Qing Zhu's, and his future recovery remained uncertain.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, the Demon Lord looked over.</p><p>“Heh… cough! Cough!”</p><p>The Demon Lord's laughter was immediately followed by a violent tremor in his aura.</p><p>He steadied his breath, glanced at Qing Zhu with an ambiguous expression, and said to Qin Sang, “You have guts, kid, refining the vessel chosen by the Ancient Demon into a soul slave!”</p><p>Then, the Demon Lord grabbed the Ghost Seal, restored it to its original form, and tossed it to Qin Sang, seemingly disdainful of using it as leverage.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He caught the Ghost Seal, helped Sunu up, and bowed, “Thank you, Senior!”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled strangely, “Those others fled in terror, but you dared to participate in the fight against the Ancient Demon. You have courage. This Lord lacks a successor. Boy, are you willing to join Demon Island?”</p><p>The Demon Lord unexpectedly extended an invitation to Qin Sang.</p><p>“I am honored by your offer, Senior,” Qin Sang replied respectfully, “I will consider it carefully.”</p><p>Now that he had seen Qing Zhu’s true form, Qin Sang intended to return to the Small Cold Realm with him. Whether he would return to the Boundless Sea remained uncertain.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn’t want to offend this overlord of the demonic path, so his response was ambiguous.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi interjected, “Fellow Daoist, there’s no need to force the issue. I observe that this young friend’s conduct doesn't resemble that of the demonic path.  The sealing of the Ancient Demon was all thanks to this young friend and this Fellow Daoist. May I ask for your Daoist title?”</p><p>“I am Qing Zhu. I was compelled to send an avatar into your esteemed sect for refuge. I hope Fellow Daoist won’t take offense,” Qing Zhu replied calmly, his expression unreadable.</p><p>“A trivial matter,” Ling Zhuzi said dismissively, his tone quite enthusiastic. “Since Fellow Daoist sent an avatar to the Heavenly Dao Sect, we share a certain connection.  If Fellow Daoist Qing Zhu has no place to settle down, you are welcome to choose a prime cave dwelling in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If it weren’t for your intervention, we would have met the same fate as the Great Shaman. Allow me to express my gratitude.”</p><p>“I will visit when the opportunity arises,” Qing Zhu responded noncommittally.</p><p>The Demon Lord suddenly stood up, said nothing, slowly retreated to the edge of the space, and vanished.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi’s gaze shifted, his face filled with sorrow. He addressed the young man and woman, “Fairy Nangui sacrificed herself to the demon.  You two must not forget to retrieve the Fairy’s belongings. As for that tortoise shell, since the妖族 are gone and it is ownerless, it rightfully belongs to Fellow Daoist Qing Zhu…”</p><p>The young man retrieved Fairy Nangui’s sole possession, an elegant spirit sword, his grief welling up again.</p><p>The young woman sobbed softly.</p><p>The young man embraced her and whispered words of comfort.</p><p>“Go pick it up,” Qing Zhu said, glancing at the tortoise shell without moving, casually offering it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied, flashing over to retrieve the tortoise shell.</p><p>The shell bore finger holes left by the Demonic Qing Zhu, but these didn't affect its formidable defensive power.</p><p>This treasure contained pure Profound Water energy, meticulously refined by the Nine-Life Profound Turtle for countless years. Its power was extraordinary, and with further refinement, it would become a top-tier defensive treasure.</p><p>Qing Zhu might not value it, but Qin Sang certainly did. He had noticed the shell earlier but hadn't dared to claim it in the presence of so many powerful figures.</p><p>“Thank you, Seniors,” Qin Sang said, happily storing it in his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Seeing Qing Zhu’s indifference, Ling Zhuzi’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Just then, a wave of energy rippled through the space. The elder, having restored the ancient restriction, returned with a look of anxiety.</p><p>“Grandmaster!” the young man and woman cried, rushing towards him. Finally able to release their pent-up emotions, they recounted the events to the elder.</p><p>Seeing the spirit sword they presented, the elder’s body trembled, and he suddenly appeared much older.  He carefully took the sword, gazing at it for a long moment before letting out an almost inaudible sigh.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi approached and said gravely, “The three Alliance Leaders all perished at the hands of the Ancient Demon. The alliances are now leaderless. Mou Laomo is dead, the Demon Lord shattered the Lunar Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, and I have exhausted my essence using the Blood Refining Technique. Upon returning, I must enter seclusion to heal. My next chance at tribulation is slim. Humanity needs pillars of strength to stabilize the situation, deter evildoers.  Do you two Fellow Daoists have any thoughts?”</p><p>“I am but a wandering cultivator, unwilling to participate in worldly disputes. I shall not impose upon you two Fellow Daoists any longer. Qin Sang, come with me.”</p><p>Qing Zhu turned to leave.</p><p>At this moment, the young man whispered something to the elder, then ran over and handed Qin Sang a token, bowing, "Thank you, Senior and Fellow Daoist Qin, for your protection. Fellow Daoist Qin, I am Bao Zhengnan, and this is my younger sister, Bao Xi.  You have not yet reached the peak of the Core Formation stage, yet possess such great divine abilities. My sister and I both admire you greatly. We hope you will visit the Four Saints Palace in the future. Activate this token in the northernmost part of the Rain Desert, and I will sense its fluctuation and personally come to greet you."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qing Zhu, seeing no objection, and accepted the token, thanking Bao Zhengnan.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace was shrouded in mystery.  It was passed down from the Four Saints and controlled the inner殿's ancient restrictions, holding many secrets. Within the sect were countless ancient texts and secret techniques left by the Four Saints.</p><p>Both righteous and demonic cultivators held the Four Saints Palace in awe.</p><p>Possessing this token couldn't hurt.</p><p>“Could you please do me a favor…” Qin Sang said, remembering something. He handed Sunu over to Bao Zhengnan. “She also contributed to defeating the Ancient Demon. I believe her soul remains intact and she should awaken soon. Would it be convenient for you to send her out?”</p><p>“That’s no trouble at all,” Bao Zhengnan replied, immediately having Bao Xi hold Sunu. He also took out a talisman to protect Sunu from the restrictions of the Spirit Subduing Realm. "Where should we send her?"</p>
