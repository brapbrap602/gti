<h1>Chapter 452: Wind and Blade</h1><p>A ferocious wind assaulted them, the wind blades themselves solidifying into a tangible force, blotting out the night sky and stars.  The sheer pressure was overwhelming, making it hard to breathe. The raging gale seemed intent on tearing apart the very fabric of space.  Nothing but the incessant howling wind could be heard.</p><p>The turbulent spiritual energy agitated everyone.  Facing this terrifying spectacle, the cultivators from Xiao Han Yu were tense, their expressions grave.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look towards the Tian Xing League, but instead fixed his gaze on the air blades he controlled.  The hurricane drew closer.</p><p>In that instant, the air blades moved.  They surged forward, the blade formation clashing directly with the hurricane in a dazzling display of light.  To the naked eye, all the air blades seemed to merge, transforming into a long, slender dragon that roared as it charged head-on into the gale.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>The terrifying collision caused everyone's hearts to skip a beat.  Even the battle between the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the distance was momentarily disrupted, many eyes turning towards the scene.</p><p>The gale devoured the air blades. Blade light shattered the wind blades.  At the epicenter, spiritual energy went haywire, forming a fearsome eye of the storm.  Within the eye, wind and blade intertwined, the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth torn apart, obscuring all vision.</p><p>The shockwave of the collision spread outwards, blasting a gaping hole in the water's surface, revealing the mud and aquatic plants at the lake bottom.  Massive waves surged, the current swift, but the hole remained stubbornly unfilled.</p><p>The shockwave reached both battle formations.  The tumultuous tide of spiritual energy, laced with fragments of air blades and wind blades, still possessed a terrifying destructive power.</p><p>Uproar spread through Xiao Han Yu's ranks.  Without orders, everyone raised their magic weapons to defend against the aftershocks.  Mu Yi Feng positioned himself before Qin Sang, raising the Nine Fire Divine Blade.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang let out a muffled groan, a tinge of blood on his lips, his face pale, his body swaying slightly as if unsteady on his feet.  Mu Yi Feng, noticing Qin Sang's movement, turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, signaling he was fine.  The air blades he controlled had been destroyed, causing a backlash, but as he was experienced in acting as the array's focal point, he had quickly severed his connection to the blades. He only sustained a minor injury that wouldn't affect his combat capabilities.</p><p>Quickly swallowing a healing pill, Qin Sang glanced at the approaching shockwave, immediately giving orders.  Another air blade quickly formed and, under Qin Sang's control, plunged into the eye of the storm.</p><p>This clash lasted nearly a stick of incense.  Both sides fought relentlessly.  The eye of the storm shifted back and forth, but remained roughly centered between the two battle formations.  Neither side seemed able to gain the upper hand.</p><p>However, as time passed, the destructive power of the eye of the storm noticeably weakened. The most obvious change was that the hole in the water's surface was nearly filled.  In the process, the distance between the two sides steadily decreased.</p><p>Another air blade was shredded by the hurricane, but Qin Sang didn't create another.  He looked at his approaching opponents, took a deep breath, and said in a low voice, “Prepare for close combat!”</p><p>It was the familiar routine; the blade battle would commence.  In the early stages of such confrontations, there were often unexpected changes. Later, the opponents, thoroughly familiar with each other, had exhausted their small tricks, which were largely ineffective in a formal battle. Several large-scale battles had followed a similar pattern.</p><p>*Swish swish…*</p><p>Countless figures crisscrossed, the formations shifting suddenly.  Qin Sang and his group had fulfilled their role as the array's focal point. The cultivators surrounding him returned to their squads, the glow of countless magic weapons illuminating the battlefield, dense and brilliant like stars.</p><p>The eye of the storm hadn't completely dissipated, but it no longer impeded their advance.  The cries of battle echoed through the heavens, as two streams of brilliant light finally merged.</p><p>Hidden within this stunning spectacle, however, lay death.  At such close range, some differences became apparent.  Though both the Tian Xing League and Xiao Han Yu were cultivators, there were notable disparities. These differences were not only in their magic weapons, but also in the cultivators themselves.</p><p>Despite the three years of war honing Xiao Han Yu's formations, compared to the Tian Xing League, there was a noticeable lack of cohesion.  The squads were well-coordinated, but overall, the formation showed some weakness.</p><p>As the overall formations were surveyed, the disparity became increasingly apparent.  However, the Xiaohan cultivators' overall strength was not inferior to the Tianxing League, even though the Tianxing League had significantly more cultivators and a larger-scale formation.  </p><p>Yet, in terms of the number of cultivators at the False Core and late Foundation Establishment stages, Xiaohan actually surpassed the Tianxing League.  Furthermore, Xiaohan cultivators possessed a greater variety of magical artifacts compared to the Tianxing League.  Most Tianxing League cultivators' artifacts were limited to armor, spears, halberds, swords, and similar types, looking very uniform.</p><p>Having fought Xiaohan cultivators for so long, Qin Sang didn't underestimate them due to their seemingly monotonous artifacts.  For cultivators, artifacts are only part of their strength, and these particular artifacts were highly synergistic, capable of unleashing power exceeding their individual quality.</p><p>"Brother Mu, you lead the vanguard, I'll provide support from the center," Qin Sang transmitted his instructions.</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng, wielding the Nine-Flame Divine Blade, a fire dragon swirling around him, charged forward. The squad members arranged themselves around Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng, preparing for battle. Qin Sang pointed a finger, and the Hanjin Sword, which had been circling him, shot out, running parallel to Mu Yifeng, while his free hand produced the Yin-Yang compass...</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>The battle cry shook the heavens.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The two formations finally clashed.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang couldn't see beyond his immediate surroundings; his eyes were fixed on the wave of enemies before him. This wave, like a sword piercing through opposing formations, carved a path forward relentlessly, charging straight towards Qin Sang.  Similar scenes unfolded simultaneously elsewhere.</p><p>However, the Xiaohan side maintained a flexible yet organized formation. Qin Sang didn't have the time to oversee other areas, quickly scanning his surroundings, silently assessing the strength of both sides before issuing a command.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Hanjin Sword transformed into a streak of cold light, advancing alongside the Nine-Flame Divine Blade.  Simultaneously, the squads around Qin Sang, anticipating his movements, provided immediate support.  </p><p>In an instant, numerous artifacts flew out, clashing head-on.  The opponent, unyielding, pressed on, their sword energy and blade auras crisscrossing. After the collision, the opponent's offensive momentum momentarily faltered.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't capitalize on this advantage to pursue.</p><p>"Pull back!"</p><p>As the saying goes, the first attack is forceful, the second weakens, and the third fails. Qin Sang wasn't foolish enough to clash head-on; blunting the opponent's sharpness was sufficient.</p>
