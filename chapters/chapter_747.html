<h1>Chapter 739: The Difference in Cultivation Techniques</h1><p>One month later.</p><p>A soft gasp echoed from the cave. Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, a look of joy on his face as he looked at his dantian.</p><p>His hard work had paid off. After a month of dedicated cultivation, his cultivation base had finally stabilized, and he could proceed to the next stage.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's expression turned grave. The effectiveness of the cultivation technique created by Senior Qingzhu could finally be tested.</p><p>He didn't immediately enter meditation. He made extensive preparations, then summoned his two spirit insects.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly showed significant changes in its form compared to before, while the Fatty Silkworm was still slumbering in its cocoon.</p><p>After absorbing the lightning on Red Leaf Island, the Tianmu Butterfly slept for five years before awakening.  Many spirit insects don't sleep this long during their fourth transformation.</p><p>Upon awakening, the Tianmu Butterfly lived up to expectations, gaining the ability to control thunder.</p><p>Its form had changed, particularly its wings.  It seemed as if lightning constantly danced within them, and electric sparks flashed when they moved. The two large Tianmu patterns on its wings were even brighter and more striking, almost bursting forth!</p><p>It had become a Thunder Tianmu Butterfly!</p><p>However, its newly acquired ability to control thunder wasn't as powerful as its innate abilities.</p><p>Spirit insect abilities are singular, and their power generally surpasses their own cultivation level. Some rare and unique insects can even transcend a tier.</p><p>For instance, the Tianmu Butterfly's concealment ability is invisible even to Foundation Establishment stage cultivators.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly can now wield lightning attacks and perform lightning escapes. While both are very strong, neither surpasses its current cultivation level.</p><p>These abilities simply increase the Tianmu Butterfly's combat capabilities.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly is currently in the late stage of its second transformation. Previously, it could only flee when facing a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, but now it can fight.</p><p>This thrilled Qin Sang.  With the Tianmu Butterfly now able to protect itself, he wouldn't have to be so cautious when releasing it.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was very confident in the Tianmu Butterfly's future.</p><p>The ability to control thunder is quite rare even among cultivators, only possessed by large sects with deep foundations. Thunder is the ultimate yang and supremely righteous force, something countless people yearn for.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the Three Calamities Devouring Heart Formation he encountered when stealing the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid from the Yuanzhao Sect's forbidden area.</p><p>This formation mimicked the tribulation of forming a Nascent Soul.</p><p>It is said that the tribulation when forming a Nascent Soul includes not only thunder tribulation, but also fire and wind tribulations, and is incredibly powerful. Countless cultivators have perished under these tribulations.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly is his lifebound insect, and can help him survive the tribulation. With its ability to control thunder, it will certainly be a significant asset.</p><p>Of course, thinking about this now is premature. He hasn't even begun to form a Nascent Soul, yet he's thinking about tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>The only bad news is that the Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation hadn't improved in the five years it slept.</p><p>The white mist and lightning it absorbed seemed to have been entirely consumed during its transformation.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly had a chance to reach its third transformation before the Seven Killing Hall opened. Due to the transformation consuming so much time, reaching the peak of the second transformation and breaking through to the third within the next five years is almost impossible.</p><p>He likely won't be able to rely on the Tianmu Butterfly's power this time in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>This is perhaps a case of gain and loss.</p><p>Qin Sang fed the Tianmu Butterfly some pills, then turned to the Fatty Silkworm.</p><p>The Fatty Silkworm's transformation was unexpectedly smooth.  Qin Sang only tentatively fed it a few drops of Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid, and it began spinning a cocoon and undergoing its transformation.</p><p>This was certainly due to the Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid's miraculous effects, but also possibly because he had fed it poisonous beast妖丹 in the mid-stage of its second transformation.  It has absorbed several of these over the years.</p><p>Throughout its second transformation, the Fatty Silkworm consumed the inner cores of at least peak Spirit Beast-level妖兽.</p><p>Other spirit insects haven't had such good fortune.</p><p>The Fatty Silkworm slept for over half a year during its second transformation, and this time hasn't disappointed either. It fell into slumber three years ago and hasn't shown any signs of waking up.</p><p>"Five years is definitely enough. I've never heard of a spirit insect sleeping this long during its third transformation. The Fatty Silkworm can neutralize poisons, and will gain new abilities after its third transformation. Those ancient secret realms are all filled with poisonous miasma. In the Seven Killing Hall, the Fatty Silkworm should be more useful than the Tianmu Butterfly."</p><p>Qin Sang gently touched the luminous cocoon, sensing the Fatty Silkworm's aura, then put both spirit insects away.</p><p>"I can begin. Before cultivating, I need to comprehend the technique…"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and calmed his mind.</p><p>Two talismans left by Senior Qingzhu appeared in his mind.  Initially obscure and difficult to understand, after his breakthrough, he could finally see through the fog and gradually comprehend them.</p><p>The cave was silent; Qin Sang sat still as a pine tree, unmoving.</p><p>Time passed, an unknown amount.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in the world of cultivation, unable to extricate himself. He was sometimes entranced, sometimes amazed, marveling at Senior Qingzhu's extraordinary talent, who had actually forged their own path based on the original cultivation method!</p><p>Compared to the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, Senior Qingzhu's self-created method was somewhat obscure and narrow, lacking the breadth and direct path to enlightenment of the original.</p><p>This was due to the limitations of Senior Qingzhu's perspective and experience when creating it.</p><p>This was unavoidable.</p><p>The creator of the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* must have been a supremely powerful senior cultivator, whose vision encompassed the entirety of the Dao, simplifying complexity while encompassing all things, distilling the true meaning of the killing path.</p><p>Every cultivator of this method could find their own path.</p><p>Compared to that senior, Senior Qingzhu was like a firefly to the moon, yet they managed to continue the method at the Nascent Soul stage, albeit capturing only part of its essence.</p><p>The word "genius" is insufficient to describe them.</p><p>The deeper Qin Sang understood, the more he admired and yearned to witness Senior Qingzhu's prowess.</p><p>But then he grew despondent. Senior Qingzhu had disappeared, leaving no trace for years, their survival uncertain.</p><p>Quickly, he lifted his spirits, banished distracting thoughts, and decided to cultivate this method.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had many realizations, recognizing the method's viability. Under the protection of the jade Buddha, he could follow Senior Qingzhu's path.</p><p>He also understood the method's flaws.</p><p>In all likelihood, cultivating the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* would grant new abilities, perhaps a second sword light, or something else.</p><p>But Senior Qingzhu's self-created method would not. It would only allow cultivators to barely progress, preventing a complete halt, stumbling along without the energy to focus on other things.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected other differences, only discoverable through actual cultivation.</p><p>After a brief awakening, Qin Sang took a pill and calmly adjusted his state, achieving a tranquil mind before carefully focusing his spirit and inspecting his Yuanshen.</p><p>In the deep cave, Qin Sang's aura fluctuated, but it was concealed by the restrictive formations, undisturbed.</p>
