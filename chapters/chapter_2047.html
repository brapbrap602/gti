<h1>Chapter 2038: The Hao Clan</h1><p>Qin Sang instructed the Xin family cultivators to clear an area in the back mountain, set up protective formations, and then brought out a stone hall from his small secluded world.  Only then did he have time to examine the items retrieved from the tomb.</p><p>Altars, ancient halls, stone carvings…</p><p>Anything that might contain information was stored by Qin Sang in his small secluded world. After a thorough search, he indeed found something.</p><p>“The Hao Clan…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at a square stone before him. The top of the stone was engraved with an orchid totem, and all four sides had inscriptions detailing the name of this Wu clan and some scattered information.</p><p>Mostly, it commemorated important events in the clan's history using a chronological system, but based on the Hao Clan's own calendar, making it impossible to correlate with the Great Zhou calendar.</p><p>Clearly, the Hao Clan was an ancient clan. Whether it still exists today is unknown.</p><p>On the back of the stone, Qin Sang saw some complex patterns unlike any ordinary ornamentation. He immediately recognized them as Wu clan divine runes, and intently examined them.  He discovered they were not complete runes, with fragments missing at the top and bottom, leaving their meaning unclear.</p><p>There must be more than one such stone; the Hao Clan recorded important information on them.</p><p>Qin Sang continued searching and indeed found another stone.  This one, however, didn't contain divine runes but rather the Hao Clan's secret method for cultivating sacrificial insects.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised to obtain this method, but after a cursory glance, his joy diminished slightly.</p><p>Raising sacrificial insects requires a long time and careful cultivation to yield results, a process more complex than cultivating one's own spirit insects.  Furthermore, to cultivate a useful group of sacrificial insects requires the whole clan's concerted efforts and continuous blood sacrifice rituals.</p><p>If Qin Sang wanted to cultivate sacrificial insects for the Storm World, he would first need to subdue all factions and make them willingly offer blood sacrifices.  Moreover, the suitability of this method for humans remains questionable.</p><p>However, if he could cultivate a group of mature sacrificial insects, their effects would be immense, providing double protection when combined with the Thunder Altar. Qin Sang considered the Storm World his own cultivation ground and was quite tempted, but needed to carefully consider the matter.</p><p>While Qin Sang was examining the Hao Clan artifacts, Su Nu instructed Luo Bo to take her to Elder Pei's cave abode.</p><p>Elder Pei had few disciples, and he had previously dispatched them elsewhere, ostensibly to monitor several key locations of the Xin family. In reality, it was Young Master Xin's deception, luring them away.</p><p>These disciples were still diligently monitoring. The two disciples guarding the cave abode were of lower cultivation and completely unguarded.</p><p>Manager Luo approached and knocked.  With a few words, he tricked them into opening the protective formation, easily taking over the cave abode.</p><p>Su Nu then personally captured Elder Pei's other disciples, before focusing her attention on Azure Water Village.</p><p>Elder Pei's cave abode was located on Xianjin Mountain, alongside Azure Water Village on the western shore of Qiong Lake. Su Nu stationed herself on Xianjin Mountain, and ordered Xin family experts to discreetly investigate. Gradually, news began to arrive.</p><p>With this intelligence, Su Nu looked at Manager Luo.</p><p>“Manager Luo, what are your thoughts?”</p><p>“Senior Su Nu, with all due respect, I believe Azure Water Village already knows of the death of Wandering Cultivator Zhong Liang!”</p><p>Manager Luo stood up, emitting a ball of light that transformed into a geographical map of the Qiong Lake area, highlighting several points of light.</p><p>These points represented the strongest forces around Qiong Lake.</p><p>Manager Luo continued, “I originally planned to lure out some key figures for Senior to subdue. Recently, I discovered that we don't need to devise a plan.  Several of Wandering Cultivator Zhong Liang's disciples have already left Azure Water Village.  However, their movements have been secretive, preventing us from taking action.”</p><p>He then tapped several points on the map. “Based on the clues we've found recently, Azure Water Village has been frequently contacting several forces, most notably the Liyu Palace.  Just now, the Grand Elder sent a message that Zhong Liang’s second disciple, Qi Ming, personally left for Liyu Palace. Therefore, I speculate…”</p><p>Manager Luo bowed slightly, “Wandering Cultivator Zhong Liang must have left behind the Blood Spirit Lamp.  Azure Water Village may harbor illusions, or there may be internal divisions, making them unwilling to abandon the vast foundation of Azure Water Village. They must have reached a consensus to seek protection near Qiong Lake and seek refuge with a powerful faction.  After contacting several factions, they finally chose the Liyu Palace…”</p><p>“Correct!”</p><p>The Xin family's Second Elder nodded in agreement. “The faction they choose must be stronger than Wandering Cultivator Zhong Liang to protect Azure Water Village, and the Liyu Palace is the only choice.”</p><p>“Liyu Palace? The faction where all three Palace Masters are at the Nascent Soul stage?” Su Nu asked.</p><p>Manager Luo nodded, a worried look in his eyes.</p><p>“Among the three Palace Masters of Liyu Palace, only the Third Palace Master recently broke through to the Nascent Soul stage.”</p><p>The elders Qin and another must be wary of the Palace Master and Second Palace Master of Liyu Palace.</p><p>"The Palace Master has long since broken through to the mid-stage of Transcending Emptiness, and is known as the strongest cultivator near Lake Qiong."</p><p>"The Second Palace Master, like  Pei the Attendant, has been at the threshold of the mid-stage of Transcending Emptiness for many years.  However, it is rumored that he cultivates a unique technique, deliberately remaining at this stage to refine his skills. He could break through at any time if he wished."</p><p>"The rumors may be exaggerated, but they suffice to demonstrate the Second Palace Master's formidable strength. Furthermore, he once clashed with the independent cultivator Zhong Liang, and neither emerged victorious."</p><p>"Oh?" Su Nu's eyes flickered. "Does Zhong Liang have a grudge against Liyu Palace?"</p><p>"It was supposedly a friendly sparring match. Even if there were grievances, Liyu Palace would surely not turn away Bi Shui Village if they came to submit," sighed Manager Luo.</p><p>Su Nu nodded slightly, rose to her feet, and sent out a message with a wave of her hand, ordering: "Inform Xin Sheng, quickly assemble our clan's masters. We attack Bi Shui Village today!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Manager Luo and the others bowed in response.</p><p>Su Nu's figure flickered, appearing outside the mountain, then transforming into a wisp of smoke, silently crossing numerous mountain ranges.</p><p>In Qiong Zhe Mountain, a streak of light arrived. Qin Sang, after reading the message, waved a hand, put away his belongings, and vanished instantly.</p><p>…</p><p>Lake Qiong is surrounded by numerous rivers and mountains.</p><p>At this time, three figures were traveling downstream on a large river, heading towards Liyu Palace on the eastern shore of Lake Qiong.</p><p>The three were on high alert, their auras perfectly concealed, undetectable to ordinary cultivators.  However, unbeknownst to them, someone was traveling through the mountains on the south bank of the river, silently following them.</p><p>This person was the Xin family's Grand Elder. He kept a close watch on the three, suddenly sensing something, his expression shifting slightly. He landed on a rock and paid his respects, "Greetings to Senior Su Nu!"</p><p>Su Nu materialized out of thin air, gazing towards the river. "Those three?"</p><p>The Grand Elder pointed to a young man in the middle. "That's Qi Ming, the second disciple of the independent cultivator Zhong Liang!"</p><p>Before the words were finished, Su Nu appeared above the three on the river.</p><p>Unaware, Qi Ming and his companions were flying along when they felt something amiss.  They noticed an unnatural silence had fallen over the riverbanks, even the birdsong was gone.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qi Ming abruptly stopped.  Then he heard a flute.</p><p>The flute's sound was clear and melodious, yet Qi Ming was startled, unaware of when the sound began or its source!</p><p>The two elders were entranced, unknowingly beguiled by the music.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Qi Ming was aghast.</p><p>A multicolored glow flickered from his right sleeve, a treasure about to be unleashed, when he felt a moment of mental confusion, a sudden premonition.  He forcefully channeled his cultivation, a round light appearing behind his head.</p><p>The light instantly transformed into two blades, slashing swiftly behind him.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Qi Ming heard the sound of the blades shattering, and simultaneously felt a gentle tap on his back, falling unconscious.</p><p>When the Xin family's Grand Elder arrived, the three were already like living corpses, their expressions vacant, floating side-by-side on the river's surface.</p><p>Su Nu didn't kill them, but subdued them and asked a few questions.</p><p>Qi Ming answered everything truthfully.</p><p>The Xin family Grand Elder grew increasingly alarmed. "They've already defected to Liyu Palace! What do we do now?!"</p><p>From Qi Ming, they learned that since Zhong Liang's Blood Spirit Lamp shattered, his disciples had been anxious, keeping an eye on the Xin family while seeking a way out.  Unable to abandon Bi Shui Village, they decided to seek refuge in Liyu Palace.</p><p>They had reached a preliminary agreement with Liyu Palace some time ago. However, as the Palace Master of Liyu Palace was in secluded cultivation and the Second and Third Palace Masters were absent, the final decision awaited their return.</p><p>The Second Palace Master of Liyu Palace was expected to return soon. Zhong Liang’s eldest disciple needed to remain in Bi Shui Village, so they sent Qi Ming to pay a visit as a show of good faith.</p><p>It was too late to suppress the news. Even if they seized Bi Shui Village before Liyu Palace noticed, they would still have to face Liyu Palace's wrath.</p><p>Su Nu and Qin Sang were both at the early stage of Transcending Emptiness, while Liyu Palace possessed three Transcending Emptiness cultivators, one of whom was the enigmatic Palace Master.</p><p>The Xin family Grand Elder was worried that Su Nu and Qin Sang might recklessly provoke Liyu Palace, making the Xin family's situation even more perilous.</p><p>"What are you afraid of?  Have you forgotten Elder Qin's identity? Would Liyu Palace really risk a mortal feud with Elder Qin over Bi Shui Village?"</p><p>Su Nu glanced at the Xin family Grand Elder and said calmly.</p><p>She naturally saw that Qin Sang had had another breakthrough at Feng Ju Jade Gate, significantly improving his cultivation.</p><p>In a battle between Transcending Emptiness cultivators, even if outmatched, it would be difficult for the opponent to stop a determined escape.  The gamble is that Liyu Palace, being so powerful, wouldn't dare to make an enemy of them.</p><p>Su Nu saw no problem with her plan. From the start of her cultivation, she had repeatedly risked her life to carve out her own path.</p><p>Besides, for her and Qin Sang, even if they couldn't defeat Li Yu Palace, their lives weren't in danger.  Why not try?</p><p>"While Bi Shui Village hasn't fallen to Li Yu Palace, we still have a chance," Su Nu flicked out three wisps of dark energy, which entered the foreheads of Qi Ming and two others.</p><p>The three men's faces darkened, then returned to normal.</p><p>Su Nu then waved her hand, concealing herself and one of the Bi Shui Village elders.</p><p>Qi Ming and the other elder regained consciousness, frowning as they looked around. Something felt wrong, but they couldn't find anything amiss.</p><p>After searching without result, the two continued on their way.  They had not only forgotten their earlier mind control, but also forgotten their fellow elder.</p><p>"Good. Those two should be able to delay Li Yu Palace for a while. We'll return immediately and take control of Bi Shui Village."</p><p>Su Nu rose on a cloud, taking the two with her.  A faint black aura surrounded her, and she transformed into an elegantly dressed, refined scholar.</p><p>He was the image of the Second Palace Master of Li Yu Palace, exactly as Qi Ming remembered him.</p><p>The Xin family's Grand Elder's eyes widened. He sensed that Su Nu's aura was identical to the Second Palace Master of Li Yu Palace.  Their ability to perfectly mimic their appearance based solely on memory was truly miraculous!</p><p>Bi Shui Village was located on the west bank of Qiong Lake, its main stronghold nestled between two peaks.</p><p>The scenery was breathtaking: beautiful mountains and clear water.</p><p>It was midday, and a light mist floated over the lake, shrouding Bi Shui Village like ethereal clouds.  Within the mountain gate, Bi Shui Village disciples flew about, practicing and discussing, everything seemingly normal.</p><p>Su Nu flew above Bi Shui Village and immediately saw through the facade.  The village's defenses were subtly strengthened, with a protective formation secretly activated, making a direct assault difficult.</p><p>In a distant valley, Xin Sheng and Manager Luo, along with a dozen Xin family experts, had arrived. Others were still on their way.</p><p>"Act as the situation requires!"</p><p>Su Nu gave an order, then flew openly towards Bi Shui Village with the Bi Shui elder.</p><p>A powerful aura of the Refining Void stage swept over the village, causing immediate commotion.</p><p>In Bi Shui Village's main stronghold, several streams of light shot out from a cloud tower, heading towards the sky. Upon seeing the Second Palace Master of Li Yu Palace, everyone was astonished and uncertain.</p><p>Leading them was a white-browed elder, the current Bi Shui Village sect master and senior disciple of Zhong Liang Sanren. Zhong Liang Sanren had not allowed his disciples to accompany him, as he was tracking the Pei attendant and the Xin family, worried about exposure.</p><p>The Bi Shui elder descended from the air and shouted from outside the formation, "Palace Master Ling has arrived!  Sect Master, quickly open the mountain gate to greet them!"</p><p>"Brother Wu, why are you the only one back? Where is Brother Qi?" The Bi Shui Village sect master transmitted his voice.</p><p>"Reporting to the Sect Master, we encountered Palace Master Ling on the way.  We explained the situation, and the Palace Master gave Brother Qi a talisman, ordering them to go to Li Yu Palace to establish a formal alliance.  The Palace Master came ahead to inspect," the elder replied.</p><p>The Bi Shui Village sect master looked at Palace Master Ling. The Palace Master stood in mid-air, hands behind their back, with an arrogant expression, admiring the scenery of Qiong Lake, seemingly disdainful of even glancing at them. A wave of despair washed over the sect master.</p><p>Some disciples suggested relocating the entire sect to avoid disaster, but with such a large establishment, moving wasn't easy.</p><p>After much debate, they decided to secretly send away a few lineages, while the rest would submit to Li Yu Palace, enduring humiliation and waiting for a chance to reclaim their status.</p><p>Ironically, the Xin family's fate repeated itself, only worse, as they did not even have a chance at posthumous revenge.</p><p>"Open the mountain gate!"</p><p>Since they had decided to submit, there was no point in overthinking. The Bi Shui Village sect master waved his whisk and gave the order.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The peaks trembled, the mist swirled, parting to reveal a path leading directly to the main stronghold.</p><p>The Bi Shui Village sect master and his disciples stood respectfully, shouting, "Welcome Palace Master Ling!"</p><p>"Welcome Palace Master Ling!"</p><p>The cheers echoed through the mountains. Su Nu walked on air, entering the mountain gate with a slight smile.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed from Qiong Zhe Mountain.  He received a message from Su Nu halfway, learning the details.</p><p>Su Nu had arranged everything. Before she could fully control Bi Shui Village, Qin Sang needed to stop any arrivals from Li Yu Palace.</p><p>"Three Refining Void cultivators?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked east, feeling some pressure, but nothing more.  If the Li Yu Palace's Grand Palace Master was a top-tier Refining Void late-stage cultivator, he might be more wary. But with his mastery of the Qingluan True Thunder escape technique, unless surrounded by three cultivators, he could come and go freely.</p><p>His recent cultivation breakthrough left some unanswered questions, and this was a perfect opportunity to test his new abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang bypassed Bi Shui Village, continuing east, choosing a lake rock protruding from the water to sit cross-legged.</p>
