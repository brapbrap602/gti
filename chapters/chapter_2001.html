<h1>Chapter 1992:  Master Yue</h1><p>The Celestial River Reverse Killing Formation.</p><p>It sounds related to the Milky Way, naturally utilizing the power of stars.  Unlike the Northern Palace Southern Dipper Refinement Talisman cast by Star琼 Zhenren years ago, using a killing formation to draw stellar energy into one's body is undoubtedly dangerous.  But if there's no other way, Qin Sang can only take the risk.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently listened to the other party describe the characteristics of the Celestial River Reverse Killing Formation.</p><p>The other party didn't hide their desire for the *Life and Death Reverse Wheel*. In such a setting, everyone is shrewd, no need for pretense.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou listened, becoming increasingly certain this person was Zhen Lao Mo of Wan Luo Dao.</p><p>"This old demon resides on Wan Luo Island, though a demonic cultivator, he keeps a distance from the demonic path.  It's said the Wan Luo Island cultivation technique, the *Hong Ke Sutra*, is strange and evil, his temper unpredictable, and other demonic cultivators are unwilling to deal with him."</p><p>The *Life and Death Reverse Wheel* is useless to Qin Sang.  Being able to exchange it for the Celestial River Reverse Killing Formation, Qin Sang naturally agreed, but Zhen Lao Mo's conditions were troubling.</p><p>How could he hand over the *Life and Death Reverse Wheel* without seeing the Celestial River Reverse Killing Formation?</p><p>If it were a renowned sect like Ji Tianzong, there would be some degree of trust, but these demonic cultivators are erratic and tyrannical, completely untrustworthy.</p><p>The exchange meeting continued, waves of divine senses arriving one after another.  It wasn't convenient to discuss details, so Qin Sang said, "Fellow Daoist, where are you staying? After the exchange meeting, I will personally visit."</p><p>Zhen Lao Mo was silent for a moment, then said, "Brown Peak."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou knew the peak, saying, "Brown Peak is located in the northernmost part of the city.  This old demon is truly reclusive."</p><p>After dealing with Zhen Lao Mo, Qin Sang interacted with others, negotiating terms.  Both parties were willing and decisive, often reaching agreements within a few exchanges.  Qin Sang ultimately sold two spiritual treasures, but didn't exchange them for other treasures; instead, he received top-tier spiritual materials.</p><p>Spiritual treasures are valued for their quality, not quantity. Qin Sang wanted to refine and enhance his own.</p><p>Then it was Gu Yun Sou's turn.</p><p>Near dawn, the exchange meeting came to a close.</p><p>Thanks to Gu Yun Sou's auspicious words, Qin Sang's harvest was indeed plentiful, giving him more confidence in enhancing the Ming Shan Armor and other treasures.</p><p>"The exchange meeting is over, fellow Daoists, please leave."</p><p>The host only said this, then fell silent.  The light orbs in the mist extinguished one by one, darkness once again enveloping the space.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang felt his body lighten, bright light reappearing in his vision, as he was "spat out" by the lantern flower.</p><p>Hua Ying made a face at them, climbed back into the flower's heart, and the bud closed.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang could no longer sense Hua Ying's presence; it had completely disappeared.</p><p>Looking around, they were on a vine bridge at the foot of a mountain, the surrounding environment drastically changed; it was no longer the same mountain.</p><p>They had been unknowingly relocated.</p><p>The ability to easily move these Nascent Soul cultivators, despite the lack of resistance, demonstrated the host's powerful control over the city.</p><p>No wonder no one dared to act recklessly in past exchange meetings.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, saying to Gu Yun Sou, "Please, Daoist friend, accompany me to Brown Peak."</p><p>"This old man also wants to see what kind of tricks Zhen Lao Mo is up to. Now that he knows that the Ming Hu Ancestor was slain by Daoist Master, this demon probably wouldn't dare to scheme against the Daoist Master."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was purely looking forward to the drama, anticipating Zhen Lao Mo's schemes and uncovering more of Qin Sang's secrets.</p><p>In Gu Yun Sou's eyes, Qin Sang was unfathomable. The spiritual treasures that appeared at the exchange meeting indicated that at least two Nascent Soul cultivators had fallen at his hands.</p><p>The two set their direction and headed towards Brown Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang also considered whether Zhen Lao Mo might have ulterior motives, but wasn't worried.  Firstly, his strength had greatly increased, and secondly, he wasn't lacking in help.</p><p>A small blessed land was enough to bind Gu Yun Sou, the Yu Sect Master, and himself together.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the northern edge of the city and saw a mountain.</p><p>The mountain had sparse lanterns and was relatively dark.  Even before entering the mountain, they could sense the faint fluctuations emanating from a treasure garden within.</p><p>"It's Zhen Lao Mo."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou transmitted his voice.</p><p>When the two arrived at the treasure garden, bright light erupted from the dark treasure garden, and the gate opened by itself. A middle-aged man in white robes came out to greet them.</p><p>The man had a square face, fair complexion, and no beard.  Judging from his appearance alone, it was difficult to associate him with a demonic giant.</p><p>Only upon closer examination of his eyes could one detect a profound coldness.</p><p>This person was Zhen Lao Mo.</p><p>Zhen Lao Mo's gaze swept over Qin Sang's face, then he unceremoniously said to Gu Yun Sou,  "I knew it!  With an old geezer like you, you definitely couldn't kill the old zombie!"</p><p>Yun Du Tian and Luo Hun Yuan had fought for so long, if they could eliminate the Ming Hu Ancestor, they wouldn't have waited until now.</p><p>Saying this, he bowed slightly to Qin Sang, "This is Daoist Qingfeng, isn't it? I've long admired your reputation!"</p><p>"Even Old Demon Zhen has heard of the Daoist's dharma name, so it's not like you're completely ignored," Gu Yunshou retorted sharply.</p><p>Zhen Laomo snorted, "The whole city is talking about you bringing a mysterious person. What's so surprising about Zhen knowing?"</p><p>Entering the manor, they settled down and got straight to the point.</p><p>"Where is the Heavenly River Killing Formation now? I need to see it with my own eyes to be reassured, otherwise, how can I know you're not deceiving me?" Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Zhen Laomo frowned, "To be honest, obtaining this formation requires some effort. I didn't expect Daoist to request this, and I made no preparations beforehand.  Give me the secret technique first; the success rate will increase by 30%. I can offer something as collateral to ease your concerns."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang and Gu Yunshou exchanged a glance, secretly finding it strange.</p><p>They had assumed the Heavenly River Killing Formation was in someone else's hands, and Zhen Laomo needed to trade with the formation's owner.  But judging by Zhen Laomo's tone, it didn't seem so.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said, "It seems, Daoist Zhen, you don't want to reveal the origin of this formation?"</p><p>Zhen Laomo nodded and admitted it.</p><p>"In that case, Old Demon, go get it yourself. The Daoist only wants the Heavenly River Killing Formation; he's not interested in other treasures."</p><p>Gu Yunshou suddenly interrupted, unceremoniously, "The Jitian Grand Assembly has been going on for half a year. Isn't that enough time for a trip?"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Zhen Laomo's face showed displeasure.</p><p>The Jitian Grand Assembly was crucial to the future situation and vitally important to a sect.  If he, a Nascent Soul cultivator, was absent, he would lose considerable benefits.</p><p>Gu Yunshou played the good cop.</p><p>Qin Sang explained his predicament, "Daoist Zhen must understand, missing the Jitian Grand Assembly makes it hard to gather everyone. I absolutely must seize this opportunity and cannot rely solely on you."</p><p>"Exactly, if the next trade meeting yields no results, I'll recommend the Daoist to Elder Yi of the Jitian Sect. The Jitian Sect might have such treasures, though the price would be higher. At that time…"</p><p>Gu Yunshou sneered, "Old Demon, you must consider this: While the Jitian Sect doesn't discriminate against demonic cultivators, would they allow a top-tier secret technique to fall into the hands of the demonic path?"</p><p>Gu Yunshou and Qin Sang worked in perfect harmony, their words flowing seamlessly.</p><p>'啪!'</p><p>Zhen Laomo slammed the table, pacing back and forth, seeming to weigh something. After a moment, he made his decision, "I'll entrust my few incompetent disciples to the Daoist!"</p><p>Wanluo Island was isolated, and he had no close associates. Entrusting them to Qin Sang was reassuring.</p><p>"But I have one condition:  the Annihilation Soul Lamp from the Old Zombie, you can't give it to anyone else. After this matter, I will exchange it for other treasures."</p><p>Qin Sang thought the Heavenly River Killing Formation was likely real, his mind settling. He smiled, "As long as Daoist Zhen can bring back the formation, besides the Annihilation Soul Lamp, Old Ancestor Minghu has a few other spiritual treasures. Are you interested, Daoist Zhen?"</p><p>"My dao differs from the Old Zombie's; only the Annihilation Soul Lamp is of any use; the rest is like scrap metal," Zhen Laomo said dismissively.</p><p>"I'll leave now, farewell!"</p><p>Zhen Laomo was exceptionally decisive, bowing and leaving.</p><p>Outside the manor.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yunshou watched Zhen Laomo leave.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, Zhen Laomo would rather not attend the Grand Assembly than reveal the origin of the Heavenly River Killing Formation. I thought that if Zhen Laomo dared to have ulterior motives, we would help the Daoist eliminate him, ridding the cultivation world of a major menace," Gu Yunshou said regretfully.</p><p>Qin Sang only hoped Zhen Laomo would successfully obtain the Heavenly River Killing Formation and return alive, without further incident.  He didn't respond to Gu Yunshou, turning back towards the manor.</p><p>Standing at the entrance was a red-haired young man, his arrogance gone, his expression respectful – Zhen Laomo's direct disciple.</p><p>"Since I've promised Zhen Laomo, I'll stay at Hebao Peak afterward."</p><p>"Good," Gu Yunshou nodded, "Zhen Laomo is solitary, without support. He dares not desire too much; he only needs to protect his existing interests and prevent others from attacking him. With the Daoist stationed at Hebao Peak, others will be hesitant to provoke him, and it won't require much effort."</p><p>Qin Sang called Zhen Laomo's disciple over, ordering him to go to Guqing Peak and bring Taiyi and Yulang.</p><p>Gu Yunshou continued, "I saw Master Yue's eldest disciple yesterday. Master Yue is preparing a batch of spirit pills, which will take two months. Once they're ready, he will come personally to meet the Daoist."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang was in high spirits.</p><p>He had a lead on both the Star Yuan Infusion and the Azure Frost Divine Liquid – the trip wasn't in vain!</p><p>After seeing Gu Yunshou off, Qin Sang occupied Zhen Laomo's manor.</p><p>Waiting for Taiyi and Yulang to arrive, I ordered them to change into Wanluo Island robes, disguising themselves as Wanluo Island disciples to participate in the Jitian Grand Ceremony.</p><p>Firstly, the rewards at the Jitian Grand Ceremony are quite generous.</p><p>Secondly, it allows them to broaden their horizons and gain experience.  When Qingyang Temple grows stronger, we will also participate in such ceremonies.</p><p>Half an hour later, dawn broke, and the Jitian Grand Ceremony commenced!</p><p>At the beginning of the Maoshi hour , the resounding sound of a huge bell shook the mountains, and countless cultivators emerged from their caves, gazing towards the ceremony site.</p><p>A green glow spread across the horizon, the clouds ablaze with color.  In the depths of the radiant clouds, mist swirled, and a fairy mountain appeared, shrouded in mystery.</p><p>Accompanied by the continuous ringing of bells, ripples formed in the clouds, and teams of cultivators flew out, some carrying flags, some holding banners, forming a grand procession.</p><p>Simultaneously, the vine bridges on the various peaks trembled and snapped.</p><p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p><p>The tightly wound vines separated, lashing through the air like a multitude of snakes.</p><p>Piercing sounds tore through the air as the vines shot towards the sky, forming a series of celestial ladders.</p><p>At some point, pairs of beautiful female immortals and celestial boys appeared in the sky, holding elixirs, sprinkling sweet rain.</p><p>The mist condensed, but did not dissipate, forming a crystal-clear celestial altar in the sunlight, refracting rainbows – a breathtaking scene.</p><p>The altar was complete.</p><p>The cultivators greeted each other and ascended the altar.</p><p>Guided by the celestial children, Qin Sang and the Wanluo Island disciples took their seats in the designated area, attracting curious glances.</p><p>The following ceremony was extremely extravagant, showcasing the power and grandeur of the Jitian Sect to the fullest extent.</p><p>After watching for a while, Qin Sang lost interest, focusing his mind inward and considering other matters.</p><p>With new spirit materials obtained at the trade fair, his plans to upgrade the Mingshan Armor had to be revised.</p><p>In the next six months, he needed to carefully consider improvements and seek advice on refining techniques from other master artificers.</p><p>"The flying artifact from Yun Du Tian was bought from Yonggu Mountain. Yonggu Mountain must have master artificers…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards a particular area of the altar, pondering whether to ask Gu Yun Sou for an introduction.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the ceremony had ended, and a Jitian Sect elder announced the start of the competition.</p><p>"Refining Void Mid-Stage."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly as he sensed the elder's cultivation base.</p><p>He then looked towards the Jitian Sect's seats.</p><p>This time, the Jitian Sect only sent four elders, three of whom were at the Refining Void Initial Stage.</p><p>The competition began, starting with the Jitian Sect and other sects' elite disciples taking to the field for sparring matches to liven the atmosphere.</p><p>Taiyi and Yulang mingled among the Wanluo Island cultivators.</p><p>Except when they were competing, Qin Sang spent most of his time studying the Mingshan Armor.</p><p>As dusk fell, the first day of the competition ended. The next round would be in three days.</p><p>Qin Sang called Taiyi and Yulang over, pointing out their shortcomings in the sparring matches and letting them reflect on their own.</p><p>Two months passed quickly. Qin Sang did not wait for Zhen Laomo, but he did wait for Yue Shangshi.</p><p>There was no competition on this day.  Just after noon, Yue Shangshi paid a personal visit.</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating in the treasure garden when he hurried out to greet the visitor, finding a woman standing at the door.</p><p>He hadn't asked Yue Shangshi's gender before.  It turned out to be a female cultivator.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>Yue Shangshi nodded slightly.</p><p>"I have met Shangshi Yue, please come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly observed Yue Shangshi. Her appearance was not strikingly beautiful, but her temperament was gentle, and her every move was graceful.</p><p>Seeing Yue Shangshi, Qin Sang couldn't help but think of Master Gu.</p><p>Master Gu and Master Lingxu were both alchemy masters he had befriended in the Talisman Realm.  Although there were special circumstances, their help to Qin Sang was undeniable.</p><p>With the Dao Court's return to the Grand Thousand World, free from the intrusion of the Six Heavens' old Qi and no longer restricted by the Imperial Seal, the Dao Court cultivators' cultivation bases would certainly rise to a higher level.</p><p>He wondered if they could break through to the Refining Void stage.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, he had ascended to the Grand Thousand World almost five hundred years ago.</p><p>In the Grand Thousand World, the average lifespan of human cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage, excluding those exceptionally skilled in longevity cultivation, was around three thousand years, although there was a range of several hundred years.</p><p>He wondered if they would ever meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Whenever he thought of these things, it stirred up those deliberately suppressed memories.</p><p>If his friends from the Dao Court were like this, what about his friends from the Storm World?</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang felt a little down, but he didn't show it, maintaining a composed expression as he welcomed Yue Shangshi into the treasure garden, offering the already prepared spiritual tea, Ganxue.</p><p>Yue Shangshi had no intention of drinking tea, but after taking a sip, she couldn't help but exclaim how good it was.</p><p>After a few pleasantries, Qin Sang, in a less-than-cheerful mood, didn't want to beat around the bush and directly asked: "Daoist Gu Yun Sou said that Shangshi Yue is looking for the Biyuan Shuanghua Divine Liquid, the true owner of this alchemy formula?"</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>Yue Shangshi put down her teacup and said solemnly, "No matter what, I will refine the Biyuan Shuanghua Divine Liquid for the Daoist, without charge! I just want to boldly ask the Daoist, where did the formula come from?"</p><p>Free reading.</p>
