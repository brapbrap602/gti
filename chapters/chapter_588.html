<h1>Chapter 581: The Sky Thunder</h1><p>Chapter 581: The Sky Thunder</p><p>A black panther emerged from the shadows. Its fur was incredibly smooth and glossy black, without a single blemish.  A golden ring adorned its neck, looking more like an ornament than a magical artifact.</p><p>Blocking the entrance to the stone hall, the panther regarded the two cultivators with a hint of amusement.  It appeared completely relaxed, showing utter disregard for Qin Sang and Flying Night Rakshasa, treating them like mere playthings.  For a mid-Core Formation妖兽, Foundation Establishment cultivators were insignificant; even the powerful Flying Night Rakshasa could be easily dispatched.</p><p>"Shadow Panther!"</p><p>Yun Youzi's eyes narrowed, his expression under the mask turning serious. He warned Qin Sang, "The Shadow Panther clan serves under the Winged妖 King. This is their king, a master of concealment, even among妖. Be extremely cautious, little brother."</p><p>Qin Sang silently acknowledged this.  The Shadow Panther's stealth abilities were renowned, even among cultivators.  Coupled with its mid-Core Formation cultivation—two full realms above them—it was no surprise that Yun Youzi's hidden markers had failed to detect its presence.</p><p>Facing the Shadow Panther, Qin Sang's heart sank.  He stood frozen by the lake, his body rigid, his blood seeming to freeze. He felt a faint but undeniable aura locking onto him.</p><p>The Shadow Panther paced slowly, appearing utterly unconcerned. It seemed to have no intention of attacking, not even glancing at the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit on the opposite bank.  Yet, Qin Sang knew that any movement from him would trigger a devastating attack.</p><p>Against an early Core Formation妖兽, he had a good chance of winning—using his unlocked Corpse Pill, his artifacts, and the Flying Night Rakshasa.  But facing a mid-Core Formation opponent? He had no confidence at all.</p><p>His only hope rested on the Sky Thunder.  Even a妖 beast's tough body would be severely injured, if not killed, by a direct hit.  If he could catch the panther off guard, unaware of the treasure, there might be a chance.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang clenched his fist, concealing the Sky Thunder.  Instead of immediately unlocking his Corpse Pill, he summoned the Ten Directions Yama Formation with a gesture. Ten ghostly banners encircled him, piercing the ground. After his spiritual energy transformation, his strength had increased significantly, surpassing ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators. He could now deploy the formation with ease, without needing to unlock the Corpse Pill.</p><p>He swallowed several spirit pills, cut his palm, and offered the blood to his main soul.  The main soul's power surged, preparing for battle.  Meanwhile, the Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact remained secretly in his hand.</p><p>妖 beasts relied heavily on their physical bodies; even if they possessed artifacts, they used them only as auxiliary tools.  The Blood-Soaked Divine Light of the Ebony Sword would likely be ineffective.  The Ten Directions Yama Banners, however, would be far more useful in a close fight.  Powerful as it was, the Ten Directions Yama Formation was just a set of magical instruments, not comparable to true artifacts.</p><p>The Shadow Panther glanced at the formation, dismissing it with a wave of its paw.  Its expression turned playful as it addressed Yun Youzi, "Old man, it seems you know the妖 race quite well, even recognizing my identity. If you confess who dared betray our clan and reveal the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's location, I'll grant you a quick death."</p><p>Having made good relations with several Nascent Soul cultivators and assured of a reward upon his return, Qin Sang was no longer as desperate for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. He had already prepared for failure; if he encountered a powerful enemy, abandoning the fruit wouldn't be a problem; his life came first.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his journey had been smooth until now.  He had easily subdued the golden eagle, only to be blocked by a mid-Core Formation Shadow Panther just as he was about to succeed.</p><p>The stone hall had only one entrance, now blocked by the panther.  Escape seemed impossible. Qin Sang was no longer concerned about obtaining the fruit; his immediate priority was escaping the panther's clutches.  He'd abandon the fruit without hesitation if it meant survival.</p><p>As he prepared for battle, about to convey his decision to Yun Youzi, he heard Yun Youzi's telepathic transmission, his expression shifting, a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>"A mere beast dares threaten me?"</p><p>Yun Youzi scoffed, showing complete disdain.  However, for a Foundation Establishment cultivator to speak to a Shadow Panther in such a tone was absurd; it would have been appropriate for a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>The Shadow Panther, predictably enraged, revealed killing intent in its eyes.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Shadow Leopard crouched, then vanished instantly.  In a flash, both its presence and aura disappeared from Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's perception. They had no idea where it went.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.  Without hesitation, he ordered his main soul to raise the magical artifact.</p><p>A fierce wind howled, churning the calm lake into waves.  Nine Netherworld Flames erupted as a fiery dragon, engulfing Qin Sang completely, leaving no gap.</p><p>All this happened in the blink of an eye.  Just as Qin Sang summoned the flames, he heard Yun Youzi roar, “Get out!”</p><p>A tremendous boom echoed. The stone hall's walls glowed brightly, converging into a beam of light that struck the void before Qin Sang.</p><p>The light was blinding.  Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and saw a dark figure blasted from the void, crashing to the ground—the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat. The leopard's speed was terrifying; it had been inches from him in an instant, and he hadn't sensed a thing.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard sprang up, seemingly unharmed, but its eyes were wide, its hunting stance a stark reminder of its untamed nature.  It roared in furious surprise, “How can you manipulate the blood pact left by our King? Who are you?!”</p><p>The term "King" could only refer to the demon king of Tian Yao Hill.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yun Youzi in amazement.  He'd been skeptical of Yun Youzi's earlier message, but the evidence was undeniable.</p><p>A transformed demon's blood pact, controlled by Yun Youzi—even if only partially—his mastery of forbidden techniques was unfathomable!</p><p>Ignoring the leopard, Yun Youzi's hand seals shifted rapidly, inputting incantations into the Immaculate Pearl. The pearl blazed, activating the hall's protective formations.</p><p>The hall was brilliantly lit, the light converging on the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard glared at the Immaculate Pearl, a sense of foreboding washing over it.  It had expected to easily dispatch these two, but instead, it felt a threat it hadn't anticipated – an absurd, unreal feeling.  Yet, the feeling from the Immaculate Pearl was undeniably real, leaving it utterly baffled.</p>
