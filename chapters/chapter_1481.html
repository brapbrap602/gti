<h1>Chapter 1473: Others' Opinions (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1473: Others' Opinions (4k)</p><p>In the world of cultivation.</p><p>Among top-tier experts, unless they can instantly kill their opponent, leaving no future trouble, or if it involves enormously beneficial interests that cannot be touched by others, they will try to avoid creating enmity.</p><p>Even if there are misunderstandings, as long as it doesn't reach the point of life or death, the best approach is to find a way to resolve it; at worst, they simply avoid each other in the future.</p><p>Given that the Old Man Hun Mo couldn't easily handle Qin Sang, sending someone to deliver a formal invitation to reconcile is understandable.</p><p>However, Qin Sang is well aware of the Old Devil's cunning and unscrupulous nature; his actions cannot be judged by common sense.</p><p>Assuming the invitation reflects the Old Man Hun Mo's true intentions, a proactive plea for peace is certainly not a genuine apology. It's likely related to that "great opportunity."</p><p>The Old Man Hun Mo is clearly looking for help, or cannon fodder.</p><p>In the current world, there are not many things that would make the Old Man Hun Mo so cautious, making it quite attractive to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, whether this is good or bad remains to be seen.</p><p>The Old Man Hun Mo himself is uncertain, indicating that it's not easy to succeed.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed the Old Man Hun Mo visiting the Great Saint Tian Peng; this is unlikely to be a coincidence. It's probably related to this matter, and the Great Saint Tian Peng is another helper invited by the Old Man Hun Mo.</p><p>With the Great Saint Tian Peng, the Old Man Hun Mo, and himself, there are already three late-Yuan Ying stage experts involved.  This matter certainly holds significant risks.</p><p>Another possibility is that the Old Man Hun Mo is using this as bait to lure him out.</p><p>The Old Man Hun Mo and the Great Saint Tian Peng secretly colluded to set a trap to ambush him.</p><p>However, doing so would be unnecessarily ostentatious.</p><p>When Qin Sang appears is completely beyond the Old Man Hun Mo's control. The Great Saint Tian Peng can't wait around indefinitely with the Old Man Hun Mo.</p><p>Furthermore, if the Old Man Hun Mo truly had this intention, the invitation would have painted the matter in a highly flattering light, not so vaguely.</p><p>What truly makes Qin Sang suspicious is the Old Man Hun Mo's so-called common enemy.</p><p>His transaction with Tong Lingyu involved sacred objects.  The Xuan Tian Palace would not voluntarily disclose this information and damage its reputation; he later joined the Listening Snow Tower under a different identity.</p><p>The Old Man Hun Mo probably doesn't know that the misunderstanding between him and the Xuan Tian Palace has already been resolved, and he even became a guest elder.</p><p>Qin Sang is fully aware of the dealings between the Old Man Hun Mo and the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>This old devil staged a grand play with the Xuan Tian Palace, deceiving the world, and pushing the Great Demon Conference forward. It hardly seems like they have a grudge.</p><p>Unless, something happened in the years Qin Sang was traveling that caused them to turn against each other. This could explain why the Old Man Hun Mo didn't invite the Palace Master and Grand Elder of the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Well, perhaps he did invite them, but the Xuan Tian Palace is powerful while the Old Man Hun Mo is alone, needing to find another helper to counterbalance the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The more Qin Sang thinks about it, the more likely it seems.</p><p>It's best to wait until he returns to the Xuan Tian Palace and ask Tong Lingyu before making a decision.</p><p>Furthermore, the possibility of the Old Man Hun Mo ambushing him is low, but it can't be ignored.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't intend to meet the Old Man Hun Mo now. He doesn't fear the Old Man Hun Mo as much as before, but he's also unwilling to easily expose the Sun God Tree and use this treasure simply for a duel.</p><p>Although the Sun God Bird is powerful, the timing must be precise. If the opponent is prepared, the chance of failure greatly increases.</p><p>He wants to wait for a sure-kill opportunity to give the Old Man Hun Mo a surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly weighed the pros and cons, looked up at the young man in black robes, and said calmly, "You may leave. Tell Friend Hun Mo not to spy on Hundred Flowers Valley again."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The young man in black robes bowed, immediately leaving the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang neither agreed nor refused, yet the young man didn't dare to ask more questions. The invitation itself was enough to explain everything.</p><p>Before leaving, his master didn't demand a definitive answer.</p><p>After the young man in black robes left, the banquet ended hastily.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang stayed in Hundred Flowers Valley, learning insect control techniques from Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley has a long history, with insect control as its foundation.  Generations of ancestors have collected various insect control techniques from all over the world, not limited to the Witch Clan's inherent insect-controlling arts.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly absorbed this knowledge, gaining immensely.</p><p>Previously, he was clueless about how to cultivate four-stage evolved spirit insects.  With this knowledge, and the classics he saw in the Spirit Control Sect, he could cross-reference them.</p><p>Although he doesn't have a clear method yet, he's gradually developing some ideas about what kind of spiritual objects should be found for different spirit insects, allowing him to reduce trial-and-error in the future.</p><p>During this process, Valley Master Mu also discovered that Qin Sang's accumulation in insect control was not as shallow as he had imagined; he could be considered a peer.</p><p>On a whim, Valley Master Mu proactively asked Qin Sang for his insights on the Hundred Flowers Valley's heritage.</p><p>Previously, he had already passed on the pre-Yuan Ying portion of the cultivation technique to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was indeed planning to do so and did not hold back, immediately launching into a lengthy explanation.  He was, after all, transmitting genuine Wu-tribe secret techniques.  His explanation left the Valley Master feeling enlightened, even resolving several issues that had plagued the Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators for years.</p><p>The Valley Master was amazed, and after much deliberation, asked Qin Sang to swear an oath to reveal the complete inheritance. This was exactly what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>In the Cang Lang Sea, his cultivation had been limited, allowing him to obtain only the portion of the Soul-bound Insect Gu cultivation before the fourth transformation. This resulted in the slow progress of his Sky Eye Butterfly after its fourth transformation.  Now, unable to return to the Cang Lang Sea, he hoped the Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance would provide some inspiration.</p><p>“Our ancestor received an incomplete inheritance,” the Valley Master sighed, “The cultivation of the soul-bound insects of our ancestors generally stopped at the early stage of the fourth transformation. Even exceptions were due to some fortuitous circumstance, impossible to replicate.  The most troublesome thing is that the higher the soul-bound insect's cultivation, the more likely it is to resist its master…”</p><p>Qin Sang knew this inheritance wasn't merely incomplete; it was fundamentally flawed. The Wu tribe had a unique advantage, capable of taming soul-bound insect gu.  Qin Sang, with the aid of the jade Buddha, didn't fear backlash, but other human cultivators lacked such means.</p><p>The Ghost Mother altered the Wu tribe inheritance, using other methods to mitigate risks, but it seems there were limits.  The path of the Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators was a dead end.  Whether the Ghost Mother was powerless or simply didn't try her best remains unknown.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley inheritance contained little information beyond the fourth transformation of the insect. This information confirmed Qin Sang's suspicion that the soul-bound insect gu undergoes changes after Yuan Ying. Simply using blood essence to cultivate it had limited effect, explaining the slow progress of his Sky Eye Butterfly.  Unfortunately, this was all created by the Ghost Mother to suit the Hundred Flowers Valley and wasn't suitable for Qin Sang and his Sky Eye Butterfly. Qin Sang couldn't absorb it completely, only learn from it.</p><p>Finding the Ghost Mother was the only way to obtain the complete inheritance.  The problem remained unresolved.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Qin Sang took his leave.  The Valley Master personally escorted him for a hundred miles, reluctant to let him go.</p><p>It was a win-win situation.  Qin Sang not only gained significant insights but also acquired many formulas and spirit herbs for cultivating the Fire Jade Centipede from the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Valley Master, Qin Sang continued south, traversing the Xuan Yue region and reaching its southernmost point before heading east.</p><p>The Boundless Sea was vast yet barren. Qin Sang selected a few islands occupied by well-known powerful cultivators. He approached cautiously; when his spirit sword showed no reaction, he would quickly retreat.</p><p>Traveling at high speed, Qin Sang returned to the Ghost Mother's cave dwelling, where he met Tan Hao.</p><p>For the past few days, Tan Hao had been diligently cultivating, preparing for his seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to Yuan Ying.</p><p>Little assistance could be provided for a cultivator attempting to reach Yuan Ying. Qin Sang only shared his own experiences in achieving Yuan Ying, avoiding fundamental Dao principles to prevent misleading Tan Hao.</p><p>That evening, Qin Sang left the cave dwelling and set off again.</p><p>…</p><p>Yin Ri Region.</p><p>The land revived, the snow and ice melted.  The White Head Snow Mountain showed hints of green.  The common people seized this precious time of year for farming. The Yin Ri Region finally had some vitality.</p><p>The sky was cloudless.</p><p>In the air, Qin Sang concealed his aura and flew on his sword. Seeing the dramatically changed scenery of Yin Ri Region, he murmured softly, “Eight years…”</p><p>During these eight years, Qin Sang had only spent a short time in Tian Peng Mountain and Hundred Flowers Valley; he spent nearly all his time traveling tirelessly.  Worried about missing the Xuan Tian Palace sacred site, Qin Sang had been hurrying, yet he had found no clues. His body wasn't fatigued, but his spirit was weary.</p><p>In another year, the Ice Demon Crystal would be restored. Qin Sang decided to return to the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Along the way, he rarely saw any cultivators.</p><p>While traveling, Qin Sang heard some news: the Xuan Tian Palace and the Demon Race had engaged in several fierce battles, with the Xuan Tian Palace slightly losing ground, merely losing some outer islands, its main territory unaffected.</p><p>Oddly, even at the most intense moments of the conflict, there were no reports of the Xuan Tian Palace Master taking action.</p><p>Currently, both sides were at a stalemate.  The Tian Peng Great Saint, possibly realizing he couldn't quickly defeat the Xuan Tian Palace, was not as aggressive as eight years ago. With the sacred site's opening approaching, the Xuan Tian Palace naturally wouldn't launch an offensive, leading to a stabilization of the situation.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>The Listening Snow Tower came into view.  Qin Sang activated his Guest Elder token, passing through the protective mountain array without alarming anyone. He went straight to his cave dwelling, intending to rest for a few days.</p><p>At the same time he activated his token.</p><p>On the main peak, Shi Xue felt a response and awoke from her meditative state.</p><p>“He’s finally back!”</p><p>Confirming it was Qin Sang, Shi Xue breathed a sigh of relief, quickly got up, and went out.</p><p>Qin Sang had been gone for eight years, without a word. While few things could truly threaten him, accidents could still happen.</p><p>Shi Xue quickly crossed the jade bridge, entered the valley where the Floating Snow Tower stood, and sent out a beam of light.</p><p>With a creak, the wooden door opened.</p><p>Shi Xue went inside and saw Liuli sitting cross-legged on the cold jade bed.</p><p>For years, Liuli had stayed in the Floating Snow Tower, rarely leaving the cold jade bed.</p><p>Now, Liuli's eyes were closed, her posture still.</p><p>There were no unusual occurrences within the Floating Snow Tower, but Shi Xue sensed a subtle yet powerful, strange energy fluctuation around Liuli.</p><p>Shi Xue watched quietly until the fluctuation subsided, then called out, "Junior Sister."</p><p>Liuli opened her eyes, her gaze regaining its brilliance.  Her voice remained cool, "Senior Sister, he's back?"</p><p>"He just returned to his cave; I haven't gone to see him yet."</p><p>Shi Xue nodded, hesitating. "Junior Sister, have you made your decision?"</p><p>Liuli calmly finished her meditation, her voice unwavering, "Only he can do this."</p><p>"Shouldn't you wait? Let me gauge his intentions first?"</p><p>Shi Xue looked pained.</p><p>Liuli adjusted her clothes, stood up, and gracefully descended from the cold jade bed, gently shaking her head. "This is my own affair.  No need to trouble Senior Sister."</p><p>"You are my junior sister, and this concerns our Snow Listening Tower. How can it be unrelated to me?"</p><p>Shi Xue's brows furrowed.  She hesitated, "Junior Sister, why are you unwilling to cultivate together with him, yet you've agreed to this?"</p><p>"It's different."</p><p>Liuli gazed at the vast world outside the Floating Snow Tower, silent for a long time before speaking in a calm tone.</p><p>"How is it different? To outsiders, what's the difference?"</p><p>Shi Xue pressed.</p><p>"Why care about the opinions of others?"</p><p>Liuli turned her gaze back, looking at Shi Xue strangely.</p><p>Shi Xue lowered her head, deflated. "Fine. I won't interfere in your affairs.  Handle it yourselves!  I don't want to repeat the last time and make things worse with good intentions."</p><p>The two sisters left the Floating Snow Tower and walked towards Qin Sang's cave along the snowy path.</p><p>Liuli's expression was calm.</p><p>Shi Xue followed, watching Liuli's back, a hint of worry in her eyes.</p><p>Soon, the two women arrived at the small building.</p><p>Qin Sang, having sensed their presence, deactivated the spirit array and personally came out to greet them, bowing slightly.  "Master Shi, Fairy Liuli, it's been a while. I intended to clean myself up before visiting you, but I apologize for the oversight."</p><p>He secretly observed Liuli as he spoke.</p><p>Liuli didn't deliberately conceal her cultivation, and Qin Sang easily saw she was still at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Clearly, her last breakthrough had utterly failed.</p><p>Was the imprint of the *玄牝玉鼎真经* truly so troublesome?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Even with Liuli's talent and the Xuan Tian Palace's resources, they couldn't solve this.</p><p>"We apologize for the intrusion, Daoist Master,"</p><p>The two women returned the courtesy.</p><p>Shi Xue also covertly observed Qin Sang.  "Daoist Master, was your journey to the North Sea smooth?"</p><p>Qin Sang invited the two women into the cave and personally brewed a pot of spirit tea. "I encountered some setbacks, but it was all fine in the end. This spirit tea was unexpectedly discovered in the Demon Realm.  While not as exquisite as the Snow Listening Tower's celestial tea, it has its unique flavor. Please, sample it."</p><p>Shi Xue took a sip, and the taste lingered pleasantly.  She praised, "Excellent tea!  I didn't expect the Daoist Master to be able to move through the Demon Realm so freely. I was worried you'd be discovered by the Demon King and face danger."</p><p>"It was nothing significant, not worth mentioning,"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled lightly. "I wonder, was the information helpful to the Xuan Tian Palace?"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded.  "The Grand Elder has repeatedly mentioned publicly that he wants to properly reward Daoist Mingyue. Only you dared to venture into the Demon Realm to investigate.  With this information, we've estimated the approximate strength of the demons, allowing us to deploy our forces effectively, avoiding unnecessary casualties.  After announcing your guest elder status, the Snow Listening Tower's situation has improved considerably."</p><p>"It's good that it didn't backfire," Qin Sang nodded, then asked what he was most concerned about. "The Sacred Ground should be opening soon, right?"</p><p>"All factions are impatient, just waiting for the sacred object to absorb sufficient energy before the opening.  The Grand Elder will definitely advocate for the Daoist Master's participation…"</p><p>Shi Xue paused here, glancing at Liuli, who was quietly drinking tea.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his teacup, taking a sip of the fragrant tea, using the steam as a cover to observe the two women.</p><p>He keenly sensed that Shi Xue had been hesitant since her arrival, clearly harboring some concerns.  Judging by her behavior, it might be related to Liuli.</p><p>Or perhaps, to Liuli's cultivation and the demonic imprint.</p><p>Yet Liuli's expression revealed nothing unusual.</p>
