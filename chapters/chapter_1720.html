<h1>Chapter 1711: Nascent Soul </h1><p>Inside the fire chamber.</p><p>A ball of Demonic Fire danced above Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The normally violent Demonic Fire appeared docile as water before Qin Sang, its aura restrained within a small space. Even if someone stood before Qin Sang at this moment, they would not sense any threat.</p><p>Within the Demonic Fire, a Celestial Platform slowly rotated.</p><p>Each rotation sent out ripples, but under Qin Sang's exquisite control, the ripples quickly subsided, making the refining process exceptionally stable.</p><p>This Celestial Platform was the core of the tribulation-crossing formation—the Taiji Celestial Platform.</p><p>Compared to the one he had seen in the Ice Instrument Palace, this Celestial Platform was closer to completion. The forty-nine grooves along its outer edge, meant for inserting Icefire Tokens, were all present. Only the Yin and Yang poles remained unformed, their runes flickering, and the glow of their restrictions fluctuating.</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn floated on either side of the Demonic Fire, one to the left and one to the right.</p><p>A stream of chilling煞 energy extended from the Ice Instrument Divine Disc, connecting to the Yin pole.  Similarly, a thin crimson thread linked the Fire Rhinoceros Horn to the Yang pole.</p><p>The energies of the two treasures slowly flowed into the platform.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the Celestial Platform within the Demonic Fire, his hand seals changing continuously.  Meticulously, he imbued restriction after restriction, guiding the two diametrically opposed energies to circulate within the platform's Qi channels.</p><p>If the Celestial Platform were considered a human body, the Qi channels within would be its meridians. The Qi circulated, connecting and integrating with the restriction runes, until the treasure was fully formed!</p><p>Ten years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang had refined the Icefire Tokens without much difficulty. The Taiji Celestial Platform proved more troublesome. After shaping the platform, Qin Sang had entrusted his avatar with the task of refining its Qi channels, a process that took ten years to complete.</p><p>As time passed, visible to the naked eye, complex blue and red patterns formed on the surface of the Celestial Platform, centered around the Yin and Yang poles.</p><p>The patterns gradually spread across the platform, meeting in the middle. Under Qin Sang's precise control, they did not clash but instead extended into each other's territory, until the entire Celestial Platform was bathed in intermingled blue and red light, indistinguishable from one another. Finally, the lights faded simultaneously.</p><p>The Celestial Platform's spiritual light receded, and disc-shaped and jade pendant-shaped indentations appeared on the Yin and Yang poles. The two treasures fit perfectly within these indentations.</p><p>"Hu…"</p><p>Extinguishing the spiritual fire, Qin Sang gently exhaled a stream of turbid air and examined the Taiji Celestial Platform before him.</p><p>Then, remembering something, he flipped his hand and released forty-nine streaks of light, each an Icefire Token, inserting them into the grooves along the platform's outer edge.  Simultaneously, the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn returned to their respective places.</p><p>'Weng!'</p><p>The Taiji Celestial Platform trembled slightly.</p><p>Two dazzling beams of light, one blue and one red, shot out from the Yin and Yang poles.  Following this, the forty-nine Icefire Tokens vibrated with a deep hum, as if trying to detach from the platform.</p><p>Qin Sang did not further activate the formation. Otherwise, the Yin and Yang poles would manifest ice and fire pillars, initiating the tribulation-crossing array.</p><p>His eyes shone brightly as he gazed at the platform for a long time, sensing the changes in Qi flow, his face filled with satisfaction.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing array was complete!</p><p>In fact, the Ice Instrument Palace contained not only the tribulation-crossing array but also restrictions capable of recording the tribulation scenes of past ancestors for posterity to study.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang had not obtained this method.</p><p>Next, he only needed to place the tribulation-crossing array in a suitable location and await the tribulation to break through!</p><p>Putting away the treasures, Qin Sang walked out of the fire chamber.</p><p>It was midday.</p><p>The sun shone brightly.</p><p>The blazing sun illuminated the deer wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly at the entrance of the fire chamber, surveying the entire Daoist compound.  Slowly closing his eyes, he didn't use his divine sense, yet he felt a strange sensation of merging with heaven and earth, becoming completely oblivious to himself.</p><p>Five Element Spiritual Roots, Nascent Soul level divine sense, all these advantageous conditions converged in Qin Sang.  When seeking Celestial Resonance, after overcoming the initial confusion, he quickly grasped the key elements.</p><p>He had achieved minor success in just twenty years, and his progress in the last decade had been even more rapid.</p><p>Such speed would be unimaginable for others.</p><p>Of course, achieving a certain level of proficiency in Celestial Resonance was not enough to directly propel Qin Sang into the Nascent Soul stage.  He still needed to spend a considerable amount of time comprehending the Great Dao, reflecting on himself, and searching for the opportunity to break through.</p><p>The key lay in the *Wusheng Moyin* .</p><p>Now, the *Wusheng Moyin* was nearing completion. He was only one step away from condensing the Devil Seal.</p><p>After years of careful contemplation, Qin Sang was certain that it wasn't his imagination. The Unborn Devil Seal he was condensing did indeed possess extraordinary power!</p><p>Furthermore, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had been cultivating alongside Qin Sang.  After completely refining the unique energy of the Near Dragon Saliva, supported by Spirit Nurturing techniques and various spiritual medicines, it had also reached the peak of the late stage.</p><p>Since the main ingredient for the Greenfrost Pill remained elusive, and Qin Sang had discovered the secrets of the Unborn Devil Seal, he no longer focused on helping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly break through, instead concentrating his efforts on himself.</p><p>A fourth transformation peak level natal insect also possessed the ability to assist in breaking through bottlenecks.</p><p>With the completion of the tribulation-crossing array, the various conditions for breaking through to Nascent Soul were essentially in place.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, the entire Daoist compound fell within Qin Sang's perception, every plant and tree as clear as if right before his eyes.</p><p>His avatar had completed its task and was currently recuperating in its cave dwelling.</p><p>The bamboo forest outside the cave dwelling was forbidden ground. No one in the Green Goat Temple, including Shen Chen, dared to approach it without permission.</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the bamboo, creating a tranquil atmosphere.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple, located on the other side of the deer wilderness, was referred to as the Inner Temple by its disciples.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's perception, several cave dwellings within the Inner Temple housed disciples in cultivation. Gold Core disciples had already emerged within the Green Goat Temple, and several at the Pseudo Core Realm were preparing for their breakthrough.</p><p>Before these disciples entered the deer wilderness, Shen Chen would bring them to pay respects to their ancestor.  Qin Sang had some impression of them.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>Unless someone possessed exceptional talent and cultivated far faster than their peers, they would not attract Qin Sang's special attention.</p><p>The door to a stone chamber deep within the Inner Temple was tightly shut. This was Shen Chen's cave dwelling.</p><p>Several noteworthy events had occurred over the years.</p><p>With Shen Chen's advancement to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had passed the position of Green Goat Temple Master in the Middle Continent to him.</p><p>Shen Chen was originally quite talented.  While his avatar was traveling, it had chanced upon pills that aided in breaking through bottlenecks.  He sent them back to the deer wilderness, assisting Shen Chen in his breakthrough.</p><p>However, Shen Chen's success on his first attempt had surprised Qin Sang.  He had initially taken this nominal disciple because of his talent in refining tools.  He hadn't expected him to be so ambitious.</p><p>The Green Goat Temple in the Middle Continent now had a second Nascent Soul ancestor!</p><p>With Shen Chen present, the Green Goat Temple's lineage was secure.  Qin Sang could now become a hands-off leader.</p><p>The Cloud Roaming Sword had also undergone significant changes.</p><p>With continuous refinement using the *Ji Yuan Shu* , Qin Sang clearly felt that the charred wood true spirit had become more stable and was gestating.</p><p>Another matter related to the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After devouring the fire spirits of the Flowing Fire Illusion True Pool on Fire Rhinoceros Island, the Fire Jade Centipede had slumbered for many years.  Upon awakening, it possessed the cultivation of the mid-fourth transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang then fed the fire spirits sealed by his avatar to the Fire Jade Centipede, allowing it to continue its slumber.  He wondered if these fire spirits could push it to the late fourth transformation.</p><p>Everything was developing in a positive direction.</p><p>His thoughts returned.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and walked down the stone steps.  After taking a few steps, he heard rustling sounds from the bamboo forest.  Suddenly, over a dozen greenish lines shot out, pouncing towards him.</p><p>The lines reached Qin Sang, emitting chirping sounds, and prostrated themselves at his feet.</p><p>These were the Earthbound Dragons raised by Su Zinan.  Qin Sang had removed their ferocious nature, leaving them as guardian spirit beasts.</p><p>The Earthbound Dragons felt a strong affinity for Qin Sang's aura.  They lay on the ground, rolling onto their backs, their cries filled with urgency.  Qin Sang smiled and flicked out a few pills.</p><p>After snatching the pills, the Earthbound Dragons followed behind Qin Sang, sometimes in a line, sometimes scattered, frolicking and chasing each other through the bamboo forest.  Only when Qin Sang entered the bamboo house did they return to their nests.</p><p>Inside the bamboo house.</p><p>Qin Sang sat upright with a serious expression.</p><p>He focused his divine sense inward, silently circulating the *Wusheng Moyin*, sensing the almost formed Devil Seal, and continued his comprehension.</p><p>He remained in secluded cultivation for ten years.</p><p>One day.</p><p>The spiritual energy around the bamboo house suddenly became turbulent.</p><p>Qin Sang's face underwent strange transformations.  At times, the color drained from his face, leaving him pale.  At other times, it was covered in a layer of greyish-black aura, as if he were possessed by demonic Qi, terminally ill.</p><p>His aura fluctuated erratically, affecting the surrounding environment.</p><p>'Crash…'</p><p>The bamboo house shook, and a fierce wind swept through the bamboo forest, scattering leaves everywhere.</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from Qin Sang, the Earthbound Dragons trembled in their nests.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely unaware of the external changes.  His mind was entirely focused on the Devil Seal within his body. The time had come. He was prepared to condense the seal today!</p><p>His obsession was still unfulfilled, but Qin Sang disregarded it completely, forcibly condensing the seal.</p><p>By now, the Heavenly Devil's demonic intent had become very thin.  The Devil Seal was no longer a nascent form.  Its structure was complete, lacking only the final step.  With his obsession unfulfilled, there were indeed many inconsistencies when he circulated the cultivation method.  The Devil Seal was constantly on the verge of losing control, making the process extremely difficult.</p><p>The greatest danger was triggering inner demons and losing control of his mind.  However, Qin Sang's spiritual platform remained clear, completely absorbed, and he unwaveringly pushed forward with the secret technique.</p><p>'Condense!'</p><p>He suddenly let out a low growl.</p><p>A booming sound resonated within his body, and Qin Sang's face flickered between black and white.  Demonic Qi almost erupted but was immediately suppressed by Qin Sang, continuing until the final hand seal was completed.</p><p>In an instant, the demonic Qi receded.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's perception, a square seal was slowly rotating within his body. The Devil Seal was pitch black and sinister, as if it could absorb everything, including the consciousness of its cultivator.</p><p>"Finally, it's done!"</p><p>Qin Sang had no time for sentimentality. He immediately circulated his cultivation method, comprehending the Devil Seal.</p><p>Just as he had previously sensed, the Devil Seal was closely connected to him.  A slight touch of the Devil Seal caused the true essence within his body to vibrate.  Qin Sang had a premonition that the Devil Seal's power was even greater than he had anticipated!</p><p>The greater the Devil Seal's power, the more it indicated the hidden danger and terror of the process of attracting the demonic intent, making him feel a lingering fear.</p><p>It was too late to dwell on those thoughts now.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind returned.  After a moment of contemplation, he summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and retrieved a jade box.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly seemed to know that its master was contemplating important matters.  It perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, remaining perfectly still.</p><p>Opening the jade box, he revealed a crystal-clear spiritual fruit, the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit.</p><p>Smelling the fragrance of the immortal fruit, while simultaneously merging his mind with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, and then comprehending the Unborn Devil Seal again, the悸动 became clearer, almost tangible!</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Only his physical body lacked a bit of refinement.</p><p>But he had grasped the opportunity. There was no need to wait any longer!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang stood up abruptly.</p><p>Within the Green Goat Temple, Shen Chen was cultivating when he suddenly heard his master's voice transmission.  His face showed surprise, then, recalling something, he became both shocked and delighted.  He immediately rushed out of his cave dwelling, awakened the other disciples, and led them back to the lower courtyard.</p><p>When Shen Chen returned, he brought the Nether Moon Guards with him and saw Qin Sang's avatar standing behind him.</p><p>As they ascended the deer wilderness, they felt it tremble and rush westward.</p><p>Arriving near the storm belt, a desolate wilderness ravaged by the Nine Calamities, the deer wilderness stopped.  Then, ripples suddenly appeared in the surrounding void.</p><p>White clouds materialized out of thin air, forming layers across the sky.</p><p>Then, the sea of clouds began to churn.</p><p>Within the center of the sea of clouds, a Daoist compound, with mountains like dragons and towering peaks, gradually materialized.</p><p>This was because the deer wilderness's protective formation had been deactivated, leaving only the formation protecting the wilderness itself.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body appeared on the main peak of the deer wilderness, observing the heavens above and the earth below.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing array was placed here, connected to the spiritual veins. He planned to break through and undergo his tribulation within the Daoist compound!</p><p>"All of you, quickly patrol the surroundings and drive away any unrelated individuals!"</p><p>A deep voice resounded in the ears of the Nether Moon Guards.</p><p>The avatar led the others out of the deer wilderness, scattering in all directions, carrying out his orders.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The avatar stood on a mountaintop not far from the deer wilderness, while Shen Chen and the Nether Moon Guards each guarded a direction.</p><p>Within the Daoist compound.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body sat cross-legged atop the Taiji Celestial Platform. The Icefire Tokens, the Ice Instrument Divine Disc, and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn were all in place.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly circled above Qin Sang's head, then suddenly transformed into a streak of light, rushing into his forehead.</p><p>The next moment, a thunderous roar erupted within Qin Sang's body.</p><p>A layer of black demonic Qi surged from an unknown source, engulfing him. The Unborn Devil Seal within his body had shattered!</p><p>Shattering the seal, breaking through!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The true essence within Qin Sang's body boiled. His Qi sea and meridians felt as if they were about to burst, sending waves of pain through him.</p><p>But he was completely oblivious, experiencing Celestial Resonance.</p><p>This sensation was like actively merging himself with heaven and earth, returning to his origin, yet without completely losing his own Dao. Instead, he sought the point of perfect harmony with heaven and earth, receiving feedback from the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang could clearly sense that the moment the Unborn Devil Seal shattered, the bottleneck loosened!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade box opened, and he placed the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit into his mouth.</p><p>The immortal fruit, his natal insect, and the Unborn Devil Seal—the power of all these treasures erupted simultaneously.</p><p>In an instant, the previously somewhat obscure Great Dao became extremely clear. He finally comprehended the profound truth!</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed towards the heavens.</p><p>His voice shook the universe!</p><p>Dark clouds gathered above the deer wilderness, lightning crackled, and the surrounding Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi became incredibly violent.  Within the roaring spiritual tide, the Yuan Qi fluctuated, creating countless orbs of varying colors that drifted around Qin Sang and the deer wilderness, descending from the sky.</p><p>A terrifying pressure emanated from the main peak of the deer wilderness.</p><p>Even the Nascent Soul realm Nether Moon Guards, located outside the deer wilderness, couldn't help but tremble when the pressure descended upon them.</p><p>The heavenly tribulation wasn't over yet.  Multicolored clouds filled the sky, their radiant light forming vast swathes.  Then, wind and thunder raged, throwing the heavens and earth into complete chaos.  Finally, the cultivators felt a familiar fluctuation and saw formless flames flickering within the heart of the storm.</p><p>"Yin Fire Tribulation!  The Master… has succeeded!"</p><p>A Nether Moon Guard almost moaned these words, his gaze towards the deer wilderness filled with both reverence and awe.</p><p>On the main peak of the deer wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely absorbed, allowing the Yin Fire to burn him.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing array had activated.  The two treasures at the Yin and Yang poles shone brightly, emitting ice and fire pillars, respectively. The forty-nine Icefire Tokens broke free from their grooves, rising into the air and revolving around Qin Sang.</p><p>The Icefire Tokens channeled the powers of ice and fire. The two irreconcilable energies flowed through the tokens, merging into a single force that circulated endlessly around Qin Sang.</p><p>Protected by this energy, the Yin Fire dancing around Qin Sang visibly weakened, no longer as fierce as it had been initially.</p>
