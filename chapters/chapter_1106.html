<h1>Chapter 1098: The Ferocity of the Corpse King</h1><p>"I once encountered a masterless Flying Night Rakshasa. Due to its obsession and instincts, it wouldn't attack other refined corpses that emitted the same Corpse Talisman fluctuations. If this Corpse King is the same, it should be much easier to deal with…" Qin Sang recalled the time he encountered Wushang in the Cliffless Valley. Wushang had been devoured by corpse energy in the ice cave, transforming into a Flying Night Rakshasa. If nothing unexpected had happened, he should still be trapped in that icy cave, day after day, unable to find release.</p><p>Wushang was different from Yagu. After the Corpse Talisman entered Yagu's body, her flesh and soul had been nourished by various treasures. Wushang, however, had long since fallen beyond salvation.</p><p>"I was able to form my Golden Core thanks to Wushang's dying words, which pointed me in the right direction. When I have the chance, I should visit the Cliffless Valley and let Wushang rest in peace," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>As they approached the Corpse King's lair, Qin Sang stopped. Shortly after, Bai appeared beside him and transmitted a message: "There are no Ghost Kings nearby. The top-tier ghosts in the Immortal Tomb seem to have their own territories. I've already cleared out most of the lesser ghosts in the surrounding area. When we make our move, make sure to eliminate the ghosts near the Corpse King's lair first. We shouldn't alert the other Ghost Kings for a while, which should give us enough time to figure out the Corpse King's strength."</p><p>"Let this guy guard the perimeter and deal with the ghosts. You and I will handle the Corpse King together," Qin Sang said as he released the White Crane. Sensing the eerie aura of the Immortal Tomb, the White Crane's long neck shrank back, and its feathers bristled slightly.</p><p>Bai glanced at the White Crane. He knew this creature was cunning and quite powerful.</p><p>"Alright!" After a brief discussion, Qin Sang ordered the White Crane to patrol the perimeter while he followed Bai toward the Corpse King's lair.</p><p>Bai summoned ghostly mist to conceal their movements. The terrain of the Immortal Tomb was uneven, littered with broken tombstones and scattered bones. After walking for a while, the ground gradually sloped downward, and soon they came across a deep pit.</p><p>The pit was filled with an especially dense ghostly aura, so dark that one couldn't see their own hand in front of their face. The moment Qin Sang saw the pit, his heart tightened involuntarily. This was a place of great danger!</p><p>At that moment, his Heavenly Eye technique suddenly caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure darting through the pit at an astonishing speed. In that fleeting moment, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable pressure. Anything that could give him such a feeling had to be the Corpse King!</p><p>"It's here!" Qin Sang roared, summoning his Ebony Sword in an instant. The sword transformed into a radiant wheel of light, slashing down toward the pit with blinding brilliance. The sword's radiance illuminated the surrounding area, and the pit erupted with the wails of ghosts. The nearby wandering spirits, startled by the sudden attack, turned ferocious and lunged forward in a frenzy.</p><p>At the same time, Bai made his move. The bone-chilling ghostly energy, which was usually hostile, now seemed docile under his control. With a wave of his hand, the ghostly energy surged toward him, forming a swirling vortex around his body. The energy condensed into streams, which Bai wielded with ease.</p><p>"Whoosh…" The ghostly energy spread out like a spider's web, covering the area ahead.</p><p>"Boom!" "Thud!" Two loud explosions followed.</p><p>The sword wheel dimmed abruptly, and the Ebony Sword was sent flying back. Then, a dark green ghostly claw appeared in their line of sight. Accompanied by a tearing sound, the ghostly energy streams were shredded layer by layer as the claw rapidly closed in on them.</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled slightly, and he was inwardly shocked. Just now, the Ebony Sword had clashed directly with the Corpse King, and the sound was like striking metal. Not only had he failed to force the Corpse King to reveal itself, but the sword wheel had nearly disintegrated.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this outcome to some extent. His hand seals changed rapidly, and he activated another sword technique. This time, however, the attack wasn't aimed at the Corpse King. The sword wheel shot into the sky, and countless sword energies scattered like a peacock spreading its tail. The sword rain fell from the heavens, engulfing the remaining ghosts. Screams echoed as the spirits fled in all directions.</p><p>The White Crane seized the opportunity to hunt them down.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai continued his assault. The endless ghostly energy he summoned finally forced the Corpse King to reveal itself!</p><p>The Corpse King's true form was far from pleasant to behold. Its flesh was withered, its face a ghastly green with fanged teeth and blood-red eyes, exuding a savage and brutal aura. Its body was unusually tall, surrounded by a towering aura of corpse energy. Its skin was a dark greenish-black, covered in several-inch-long black hairs that stood stiff and rigid. Its ghostly claws were pitch black, with nails as sharp as spiritual swords, and a pervasive corpse poison emanated from its body.</p><p>There was no trace of a normal human left in the Corpse King. If it had cultivated to this level on its own, it would have long since mastered transformation techniques. Without revealing its true form, it would be indistinguishable from a normal person, save for the aura of corpse energy. If its intelligence were high enough, it could even walk among humans in the outside world, and ordinary cultivators would find it difficult to discern its true nature.</p><p>This Corpse King, however, was likely a refined corpse left behind by a disciple of the Corpse Sect. For some reason, it had been abandoned here and had yet to break free from the shackles of the Corpse Refining Technique and the Corpse Talisman. It lacked the intelligence commensurate with its cultivation level and didn't know how to transform.</p><p>For Qin Sang and Bai, this was a good thing, as it would make dealing with the Corpse King easier. However, after getting a clear look at the Corpse King's physical form, both of them couldn't help but feel uneasy. The Corpse King's body was like tempered steel. The ghostly claw that had forcefully repelled the Ebony Sword and torn through the ghostly energy streams didn't seem to have suffered any damage.</p><p>"Roar!" The Corpse King bared its fangs and let out a thunderous roar. Its blood-red eyes grew even more filled with bloodlust and greed as it stared at Qin Sang and Bai. Its arms crossed violently, and with a sound like tearing cloth, it ripped through the ghostly energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he immediately activated his escape technique to retreat. By now, some of the other ghosts had been slain by Qin Sang's sword, while the rest, sensing the Corpse King's aura, had fled in terror, only to be hunted down by the White Crane. The area around the pit was now eerily empty.</p><p>Bai remained motionless, his eyes fixed on the Corpse King's blood-red gaze. His lips moved slightly as he chanted some kind of secret technique, his expression tense.</p><p>"Whoosh!" A foul wind swept through, carrying a stench that made one's nose wrinkle. The Corpse King's corpse energy suddenly exploded, and it vanished from its spot, reappearing in front of Bai in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Bai, who had been focused on activating his secret technique, was startled and hastily dodged, his body shifting several feet to the side, narrowly avoiding the attack. Even so, three deep claw marks appeared on his arm, the wounds black as ink as the corpse poison quickly spread through his body.</p><p>Bai had the Nine-Life Mystic Tortoise Shell that Qin Sang had given him. The shell, refined over many years by the Nine-Life Mystic Tortoise, was as hard as any defensive treasure and could be used as a shield. Yet, against the Corpse King, Bai hadn't even had time to raise the shell to block the attack. An ordinary cultivator would have already succumbed to the corpse poison and died on the spot. Fortunately, Bai was a refined corpse himself and wasn't as vulnerable to the Corpse King's poison.</p><p>Qin Sang, horrified, retreated to the edge of the pit to avoid drawing the Corpse King's attention. He wasn't a refined corpse, and even his third-level Heavenly Demon Transformation physique wouldn't be able to withstand a single strike from the Corpse King. If the Corpse King targeted him, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>Bai continued to retreat, engaging the Corpse King in a desperate struggle, narrowly avoiding death at every turn. But then, something unexpected happened. Despite the Corpse King's overwhelming ferocity, its body suddenly swayed unsteadily, and its corpse energy became erratic.</p>
