<h1>Chapter 2033: Bearing the Grief</h1><p>Countless irregularly shaped rocks of varying sizes floated in the void.  </p><p>The expanse of stones stretched as far as the eye could see, perhaps covering tens of thousands of miles.  According to Young Master Xin, this place contained only stones, no magical illusions or fragments of smaller worlds; an unseen force seemed to hold the stones together.</p><p>These seemingly ordinary stones, despite countless assaults by wicked winds and strange lightning, remained.</p><p>However, the illogical sights within the Fengju Jade Gate were commonplace, so everyone was unsurprised.</p><p>Entering the stone field, one was met with a monotonous expanse of grey stones, like a vast maze.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled incessantly through the stones, less dangerous than the wicked winds, but still a considerable nuisance.  Qin Sang and Young Master Xin navigated the rocks; searching for a hidden realm in such a place was an arduous task.</p><p>While searching for the realm, Young Master Xin had gathered much information.  The location had been noted long ago and searched countless times, but it was said to be barren, devoid of treasure, thus gradually abandoned.</p><p>Following the wishes of his family's elder patriarch, Young Master Xin secretly investigated and located the realm. However, he kept its existence hidden to set a trap for the attendant Pei and the cultivator Zhong Liang.</p><p>The stones' surfaces differed, but their composition was similar, suggesting a common origin. Young Master Xin speculated they were fragments of a single colossal rock.</p><p>If that were true, how immense must the original stone have been?  They had passed countless stones larger than mountain ranges.</p><p>After a winding journey, the wind carried a dampness, and a large, flat stone like a landmass appeared ahead, with a jade-like river flowing through its center.</p><p>The river flowed powerfully, its banks lined with desolate stone mountains.</p><p>The group followed the river upstream; the realm lay at its source.</p><p>Led by Young Master Xin, they soon arrived above a large marsh.</p><p>The air was heavy with moisture, shrouded in mist.  Despite the absence of any life, the Xin family cultivators dispersed, maintaining vigilant watch.</p><p>"Elder Qin, the realm's entrance is underwater,"</p><p>Young Master Xin pointed downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang extended her spiritual sense, discovering the water was only a few meters deep, the bottom covered in sand and stones.  Beneath them was a narrow gully, with water bubbling up from the ground – nothing unusual.</p><p>Naturally, if the entrance were easily found, it would have already been claimed.</p><p>Young Master Xin produced a silk handkerchief, gently tossing it into the water.  The water boiled, emitting thick vapor, quickly shrouding the surroundings in a white haze.</p><p>As it sank, the handkerchief's color gradually faded, becoming transparent until it merged seamlessly with the water.</p><p>Immediately, a faint silver gleam appeared within the gully.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. She surveyed their surroundings. They had remained stationary, and the mist showed no disturbance, yet her senses detected an unknown change nearby.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind suddenly struck, churning the white mist into indescribable shapes.</p><p>The others sensed the abnormality and became alert.</p><p>The wind, instead of subsiding, intensified, its roar deafening, surpassing thunder, like the earth tearing apart and the heavens collapsing.</p><p>Young Master Xin remained calm, standing beside Qin Sang, awaiting orders.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, instructing the Xin family members to proceed first, then she cautiously stepped forward. That single step felt like entering a new world.  The wind intensified, white mist enveloping the space; the wind and smoke shifted like a dream, though the terrifying wind noise shattered the illusion.</p><p>The chaotic wind caused unrest, anxiety spreading among the group.</p><p>"Is this it?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, scanning intently as if searching for something.</p><p>"It seems this realm is on the verge of collapse," Qin Sang stated.</p><p>The fluctuations were familiar; they had experienced them in the tomb – signs of a realm's destruction.</p><p>This was worse than the tomb; the realm was inherently unstable, and their actions had accelerated its collapse.</p><p>"Elder Qin, look," Young Master Xin pointed towards the depths of the wind and smoke, where a slender white shadow was visible.</p><p>The cylindrical shadow floated in the wind, rising and falling.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, drawing the shadow before her. It was a jade pillar, nearly two meters long and requiring three people to embrace.</p><p>The jade pillars showed several cracks; none were whole, one end clearly broken off.  The jade's texture was clear, its interior like flowing water.</p><p>Seeing the pillar, Young Master Xin breathed a sigh of relief.  "These pillars must support this secret realm," he said. "If they're destroyed, the realm loses its support.  There must be more than one here!"</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, sensing carefully.  Indeed, he detected a special, artificially created energy signature.  It was a unique method of crafting; he was intrigued, but a single broken pillar wasn't enough to reveal the whole picture.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang gave the order to proceed.  They soon found another damaged pillar, this one even more severely broken.  So far, no danger.  Qin Sang commanded, "Search separately, and bring back all the pillars you find."</p><p>He then sat cross-legged in mid-air, placing a hand on a pillar, closing his eyes to sense it. Young Master Xin stood by.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Everyone went to search.  One by one, they returned with fragments, but no complete pillar.</p><p>Then, someone rushed back: "Young Master! Elder Qin!  There's a complete pillar ahead, but it's immovable!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately went with the person. The pillar stood in mid-air, unsupported yet incredibly stable, like a divine pillar, almost perfectly intact.</p><p>Qin Sang approached, gently touching it, his gaze flickering.  With this pillar and the fragments, he could deduce much.</p><p>"The wind...it's getting stronger..." someone whispered anxiously. The realm was collapsing faster; they had little time, and needed a solution.</p><p>As Young Master Xin began to speak, a shout came from afar. A young man in grey robes, seemingly having made a discovery, flew towards them.</p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p>"Old Thirteen, you're a Transcendent cultivator; why such haste? What happened?" Young Master Xin frowned slightly.</p><p>Reprimanded, the young man stammered, glancing at Qin Sang.  "Young Master, we found something unusual, but we're unsure.  The Grand Elder is guarding it, not daring to act; he sent me to fetch you."</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded, seemingly unsurprised. Without rushing, she politely asked Qin Sang, "Elder Qin, can these pillars be repaired?"</p><p>"Yes, and not even a master craftsman is needed.  Summoning me was a bit of an overreaction," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"It's a serious matter; I didn't want to take any chances.  Will repairing them stop the realm's collapse?" Young Master Xin asked hopefully.</p><p>"It will, but only temporarily.  Many pillars are missing. To completely stabilize it, new ones must be crafted."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  "You can't gather the necessary materials now, can you?"</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed, "Opening the realm revealed its full scale. I prepared as much as possible, but not everything.  Would you have the time to...once we gather the materials..."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting her. "As I said, with the proper method, creating these pillars isn't difficult. Repairing and supporting these will buy time.  I've grasped the complete method, I'll teach you; you can commission others to craft them later."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet agreed to have the Xin family subordinate themselves to him. Even if he did, it would be to work for him, not the other way around.</p><p>Young Master Xin replied, "As you command!"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to start crafting. He was also curious about the realm's treasures, and sent the young man in grey to lead the way.</p><p>Soon they arrived, greeted by the Grand Elder, who seemed to have found something precious, his voice brimming with excitement.</p><p>"Young Master, this place might contain Celestial Frost Silver!"</p><p>Thick fog still lingered, but a patch of silvery mist stood out, different from the rest.  The silver mist was dense and still, with an internal 'whooshing' sound, like a spring.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone as he examined the mist; it was unlike anything he’d ever seen, including the name Celestial Frost Silver.  It sounded like a material, but it wasn't recorded in the Five Elements Alliance’s archives.</p><p>"Old Thirteen," Young Master Xin called the young man closer, whispering instructions.</p><p>The young man muttered incantations, forming a hand seal; light shimmered around him, then he took a step to the left, leaving a phantom shadow behind, shaped like a grey wolf. The wolf stretched, leaped into the silver mist, silently howling. Silver mist began clinging to its form.</p><p>Then, silver mist continuously seeped into the Grey Wolf, quickly absorbed for the most part, revealing the interior.  There was a pool of quicksilver.</p><p>When the Grey Wolf emerged again, it had transformed into a Silver Wolf, vigorous and solid, with a powerful aura. A qualitative change had clearly occurred.</p><p>Seeing this, the Xin family rejoiced.</p><p>“It truly is Celestial Frost Silver!”</p><p>The Xin Clan leader also showed delight.  Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, he quickly explained.</p><p>“With all due respect, Elder Qin, Celestial Frost Silver isn’t naturally occurring spiritual silver. It’s artificially refined.</p><p>“Our Xin family’s Shadow Transformation technique, combined with certain special treasures, allows for further transformation and greatly increased power.  But only a few materials, including Celestial Frost Silver, meet the requirements.</p><p>“Celestial Frost Silver is the most suitable. Its refining method has long been lost. My father, by chance, discovered that this place might contain Celestial Frost Silver, and that it regenerates continuously…”</p><p>The continuous supply of Celestial Frost Silver was indeed a treasure trove for the Xin family, a place they had to protect at all costs.</p><p>So it was artificially refined.  No wonder I'd never heard of it before.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a drop of Celestial Frost Silver, sensing it carefully, and secretly marveled at its exquisite nature.</p><p>Unable to immediately determine its use, but acting as any refiner would, Qin Sang collected a box of Celestial Frost Silver for later study. The Xin family naturally dared not object.</p><p>The most important thing in this entire realm was this pool of Celestial Frost Silver.</p><p>What followed was straightforward. Qin Sang found a place and began repairing the jade pillars.</p><p>The Xin Clan leader gathered Xin family cultivators to refine the Celestial Frost Silver, strengthening their abilities. These were the Xin family’s elite, core members. After this, the Xin family's overall strength would undoubtedly rise to a new level. Excluding cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, they might even surpass the strength they had during the previous patriarch's lifetime.</p><p>When the first jade pillar was completed and erected, the realm's collapse was indeed mitigated.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang and the Xin family worked, four figures were speeding through the Fengju Jade Gate, searching for something.</p><p>The figures' attire clearly identified them as Buddhist disciples: one monk and three nuns.</p><p>The monk, with nine戒疤 (jieba - Buddhist monk's shaved-head marks), wore a gold-threaded kasaya and held a string of prayer beads.  Golden light surrounded him, like a halo, indicating a highly accomplished monk.</p><p>The three nuns all wore simple robes and head coverings.  One elderly nun silently chanted scriptures even while flying; her aura indicated a level of cultivation comparable to the monk’s.</p><p>The other two nuns followed the elder nun.  One younger nun’s natural beauty shone through her plain robes, even though her partially covered hair indicated she hadn’t fully taken monastic vows.</p><p>Soon, they reached a fragment of a sword pavilion – the fragment of the Purple Micro Palace where Tianshan Mountain once stood.</p><p>Seeing the almost completely destroyed Tianshan Mountain, the younger nun showed sudden anxiety, swiftly descending to the mountain's base.</p><p>The broken walls and ruins spoke of the terrible event that had taken place.</p><p>If anyone had been on the mountain at the time, they would likely have been reduced to dust with it.</p><p>All hope became an illusion.</p><p>The young nun trembled and closed her eyes in pain. She had searched for a thousand years, only to find this cruel reality.</p><p>The three exchanged a look and slowly approached.  Seeing the younger nun’s expression, they knew this was the place they sought. They examined the mountain, searching for clues. Finally, the monk and elder nun exchanged a look of helpless resignation.</p><p>“Amitabha Buddha!”</p><p>The monk chanted the Buddhist invocation.</p><p>The elder nun sighed, her eyes filled with compassion. “Junior Sister, please accept this loss.”</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>A tear fell to the ground.</p><p>The elder nun opened her mouth, about to offer more comfort, when a violent tremor shook the air.</p><p>The sudden change startled everyone except the young nun, still lost in her grief.</p><p>“Is it an evil wind and thunder about to erupt?” another nun asked.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>The monk’s expression turned serious as he stared into the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>The next moment, a lightning bolt, as if traversing countless miles, tore through the Fengju Jade Gate, followed by a deep aura that filled the ancient battlefield!</p>
