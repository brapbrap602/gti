Chapter 380: A Field of Corpses


“Someone’s been here!”


Qin Sang felt a chill, questioning, “Senior, didn’t you leave a hidden mark?  Wasn’t it supposed to be undiscovered?”


Yun Youzi gently shook his head. “The paths through the mountain aren’t just one. The poisonous frog nest is large. If someone found another weak point nearby and used a different passage, it’s not strange for them to end up here. Judging by this poisonous frog’s corpse, it died at least two months ago… There’s not a sound here. Could all the poisonous frogs have been killed?”


Yun Youzi started at this point.


The nest contained many adult poisonous frogs; even a cultivator at the Core Formation stage wouldn’t dare enter such a venomous lair!


Both of them looked at each other in shock.


“Qin, do you remember what the shopkeeper of Tianfeng Tower said? The great upheaval in the Wuyagu Valley was sudden and illogical. Some said they felt an incredibly powerful aura pass by, and that the demonic beasts and ghosts seemed more like they’d been scared away…”


Yun Youzi’s tone was heavy.


Qin Sang said hoarsely, “Senior, you suspect…”


Yun Youzi slowly uttered two words, “Yuan Ying!”


…


Then, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi bravely ventured deeper into the poisonous frog nest. The further they went, the more shocked they became.


Countless poisonous frog corpses floated on the swamp, a horrifying sight; “a field of corpses” was an apt description.


Among them were adult poisonous frogs.


All the poisonous frogs had been killed with a single blow.  Their venom sacs—their most valuable and only asset—had been completely looted.


Besides that, they didn’t even see a single trace of a fight. It was as if these poisonous frogs were happily living in their nest, suddenly struck by disaster, completely unable to fight back.


Yun Youzi quickened his pace, going all the way to the end of the nest, but he couldn’t find a single living poisonous frog.


Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi and tentatively asked, “Senior, could someone have beaten us to it?”


If a Yuan Ying cultivator really passed through, even the strongest corpse refinement techniques wouldn’t stand a chance; they would be easily obliterated. The spirit herbs would certainly have been taken by the Yuan Ying cultivator.


There was no point in their continuing to risk going further inside.


“No!”


To Qin Sang’s surprise, Yun Youzi shook his head decisively.


“Qin, you don’t understand the Inner Valley. The rumors in the market are all hearsay. Very few people have actually entered the Inner Valley; they’re not to be trusted.


“The Inner Valley of Wuyagu is several times larger than the first and second layers combined; it’s a vast and boundless region. The many dangers we encountered on the second layer are insignificant compared to the Inner Valley.


“In the Inner Valley, ancient restrictions and spatial rifts are intertwined everywhere. Powerful ancient beasts, as strong as Yuan Ying cultivators, lurk among them. Without knowing a safe route, I wouldn’t dare bring you in to die.


“It’s impossible that, by sheer coincidence, that Yuan Ying cultivator happened to take the same path as us. We haven’t even left the barrier yet. Continuing inward will reveal the truth.”


The two continued forward.


Qin Sang noticed that Yun Youzi was heading directly across the poisonous frog nest. If those poisonous frogs were still alive, they would have had a tough time.


After walking a bit further, the green mist thinned. Yun Youzi seemed to have discovered something and increased his speed. When Qin Sang caught up, he saw a limb of some unknown demonic beast on the ground, clearly not belonging to a poisonous frog.


“There are more than just poisonous frogs living here. These are the poisonous frogs’ natural enemies, and they’ve been cleaned out too.”


Yun Youzi said with self-deprecation, “I wonder which senior paved the way. All the preparations I meticulously made were for naught… But, it did save us a lot of trouble.”


The further they went, the more remnants they found, the demonic beasts' blood staining the swamp blue. The demonic beast corpses had been skinned and dismembered, their valuable parts plundered.


Suddenly, Yun Youzi moved, darting to a torn piece of hide and crouching down to stare at it, lost in thought.


The hide was only palm-sized, with black, needle-like bristles. In the middle of the hide was an extremely fine scratch; otherwise, there were no other abnormalities.


“Senior, what are you looking at?” Qin Sang curiously asked.


“The Shadowless Sword!”


Yun Youzi let out a long breath, pointing to the scratch in the middle of the hide. “This sword mark was left by the Wuji Sect’s famed sword technique, the ‘Shadowless Sword.’ That’s why those poisonous frogs died silently! I didn’t realize it before, I just found it strange. Seeing the sword mark on this hide, I remembered this sword technique.”


Qin Sang was startled, his surprise evident.  "Was that the Wuji Sect Master?"

Earlier, they had assumed it was some high-ranking cultivator from a demonic sect, never imagining it could be the Sect Master of one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects!

Yun Youzi hesitated. "If it was the Shadowless Sword, it makes sense. It might not have been the Sect Master himself; a late-stage Golden Core cultivator from the Wuji Sect could manage that."

Whether a Nascent Soul or a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, neither was someone they could provoke; it made no difference to them.

They continued forward.  They saw more body parts and animal hides, but no similar sword marks.  Based on a single sword mark, Yun Youzi couldn't draw any conclusions.

The cave system was more complex than Qin Sang had imagined. After encountering more slain beast remains, the terrain changed. Once they emerged from the mud, squeezed through a narrow crack in the rock, and traveled a short distance, they suddenly heard a '咕咕' sound ahead.

A beast blocked their path, but Yun Youzi was delighted. This meant the mysterious expert wasn't following the same route.

Yun Youzi produced a magical item, seemingly made from some kind of beast hide, and covered both of them.  They passed through the beast group without incident and finally reached a wall, finding a very hidden, extremely low cave.

…

"Finally out!" Yun Youzi exclaimed.

Qin Sang emerged from behind Yun Youzi.

Although the passage through the cave was winding and long, they encountered no further restrictions or beasts.  They were fortunate to emerge unscathed and with minimal energy expenditure, leaving them well-prepared for the dangers within the inner valley.

They now found themselves in a narrow rock fissure in the mountain, with bright light ahead.

As they neared the end of the fissure, the first thing they saw was a lush green grassland. A gentle breeze stirred the grass, creating waves of green that stretched into the distance.

The sound of rushing water was surprisingly calming.  Mountains rose in the distance beyond the grassland.

At first glance, it was a peaceful scene, quite unlike what Qin Sang had expected.

The beauty before them seemed out of place. Qin Sang looked astonished.

Seeing Qin Sang's expression, Yun Youzi guessed his thoughts and said with a smile, "Don't be surprised, Qin Lao Di.  A few more steps and you'll see the true face of the inner valley."
