<h1>Chapter 719: News</h1><p>Qin Sang vanished in a flash.</p><p>He concealed his aura and silently moved north, approaching Cold Flame Island.</p><p>Coincidentally, it was dusk again, the setting sun like blood, just as it was the first time he came to Cold Flame Island.</p><p>Estimating the distance, Qin Sang figured Cold Flame Island was not far ahead, so he stopped and flew upward.</p><p>When he vaguely saw the scene at Cold Flame Island, Qin Sang's face froze. He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was seeing things, and instinctively flew a bit further.</p><p>Finally seeing clearly, Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>He remembered that when he was driven away by a swarm of demons, Cold Flame, though newly born, was already relatively stable, occupying a deep pit in the middle of the island.  While other parts of the island were affected, they weren't destroyed this completely.</p><p>Now, Cold Flame Island had completely disappeared!</p><p>At the spot where Cold Flame Island used to be, the blue flames still burned brilliantly, while around where the island once stood, countless small blue flowers, also composed of Cold Flame, floated in the air and on the water's surface, like the river lanterns he had seen in the mortal world.</p><p>The western sun was a bloody crimson, the eastern Cold Flame was unchanged, and the surroundings seemed encircled by a blue ribbon of stars.</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed intense surprise; Cold Flame was still there, but it had shattered.</p><p>This was far beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had thought Cold Flame had been subdued by a powerful demon, but it remained, and even the powerful demon had failed.</p><p>Why had Cold Flame split? Why had Cold Flame Island vanished?</p><p>Qin Sang looked out into the distance, baffled. He scanned the waters around where the island had been, but found nothing unusual; his protective artifact showed no warning.</p><p>The powerful demon wasn't there, and even if other beasts were nearby, escaping should be easy.</p><p>After hesitating, Qin Sang boldly approached.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang was close enough to see more clearly: after splitting, each flame remained stable, floating in the air or on the water, neither extinguishing nor drifting.</p><p>"Incredible!"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, waiting a moment before approaching again, this time much more cautiously and slowly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after, Qin Sang stopped, a look of surprise in his eyes, then quickly retrieved a mask from his storage ring and put it on.</p><p>At the same time, ripples appeared on the water near Cold Flame, glowing faintly gold, a sign of some kind of restriction.</p><p>Through the restriction, it was clear that the island's foundation remained, it wasn't a complete collapse, but the part above the water had been somehow erased.</p><p>Even so, the power to destroy such a large island was terrifying.</p><p>Then, a man in black armor emerged from the water. The man's gaze swept across the area, instantly pinpointing Qin Sang's hiding place. He roared, "Get out!"</p><p>In an instant, the man in black armor vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart turned cold. Without hesitation, he used his full power. A thunderous sound echoed, and a red and white streak of light, like lightning, instantly shifted dozens of meters.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The next moment, where Qin Sang had been standing, the sea erupted, a deep pit opening as a spear flashed past. The black-armored man slowly reappeared at the edge of the crater.</p><p>He had missed.</p><p>The black-armored man looked intently at where Qin Sang was, and upon seeing him, surprisingly, the tension on his face eased somewhat.</p><p>"So it's a fellow cultivator…"</p><p>The black-armored man examined Qin Sang. He saw that Qin Sang's cultivation wasn't high, but Qin Sang's incredible speed impressed him. He lowered his spear, bowing slightly. "This place is very dangerous. If you don't know what's going on, leave quickly. I'll let bygones be bygones."</p><p>Qin Sang certainly didn't want to leave. What shocked him was the black-armored man's cultivation; the aura he briefly revealed was that of a late Gold Core cultivator!</p><p>Even more surprising was the man's identity. Though he had never seen this person before, he recognized the black armor – unique to the guards of Huntian Island!</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't shown such amazing speed, this man certainly wouldn't have been so polite.</p><p>It wasn't a demon beast guarding Cold Flame, but a Huntian Island guard.</p><p>Was that powerful demon, the one that transformed, driven away by the Huntian Island Master?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave immediately. Secretly gripping the Ten Directions Yama Banner, he returned the bow, glanced at Han Yan, and said, "Friend, please don't misunderstand. I was merely passing through the Thousand Demon Sea, and when I noticed the blue light flickering nearby, I thought some treasure had appeared.  I didn't expect it to be this strange cold flame.  This fire requires your personal guarding, is it some extraordinary treasure?"</p><p>Perhaps bored with his confinement, the man in black armor didn't immediately order Qin Sang away. He smiled, "Calling it a treasure isn't wrong. This fire is called the Winter Nether Cold Flame, a peerless magical ability cultivated by the former Island Master, Dongming. Dongming passed away here, leaving behind the Winter Nether Cold Flame, its power is extraordinary; even transformed demons coveted it. The Island Master drove the transformed demon away and ordered Lu to guard this place. However, this flame bears Dongming's unique mark. It's said that before his death, Dongming was only a hair's breadth away from the late Yuan Ying stage. For others to erase Dongming's mark and subdue this flame is basically impossible."</p><p>"Winter Nether Cold Flame?"</p><p>Qin Sang was truly surprised. He thought it was some naturally occurring strange fire that attracted Dongming, not that Dongming himself had cultivated it.</p><p>That cave dwelling was originally Dongming's place of passing, no wonder it left behind so many treasures!</p><p>"Transformed demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned shock, "No wonder there was so much chaos in the Demon Sea in previous years, it was actually a transformed demon that appeared."</p><p>The black-armored man sized Qin Sang up and down, surprised, "Friend, you just returned from the depths of the Demon Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "I previously traversed the Thousand Demon Sea, hunting demons in its depths. Later, I heard about the great war between the two races and that the sailing routes were blocked by rogue cultivators. Although I was very anxious, I was helpless and trapped inside.  Recently, I luckily obtained a sea chart, discovered this route, and dared to try my luck."</p><p>"So, you entered before the great war between the two races, and stayed in the depths of the Demon Sea for nearly twenty years?"</p><p>The black-armored man exclaimed, looking deeply at Qin Sang, "Friend, you've hidden yourself well! I almost overlooked it! Friend, you may not know, but the war between the two races ended five years ago. The rogue cultivators blocking the path were never a serious threat. With your strength, you needn't have feared them. However, your caution is not wrong; that route has long been overrun by demonic beasts, that path is now cut off. Now, few cultivators dare to enter the Thousand Demon Sea. The rogue cultivators who were there couldn't escape and were also ravaged by the demonic beasts, saving us the trouble of clearing them out."</p>
