<h1>Chapter 1814: Resolve</h1><p>A fierce poison entered his body.</p><p>Qin Sang willingly restrained the power of the Poison Pearl, suppressing his True Essence and vital energy, offering almost no resistance. He immediately felt the discomfort.</p><p>Because it wasn't the original cultivation method, many techniques couldn't be employed. Without any buffer, Qin Sang almost directly endured the onslaught of the fierce poison.</p><p>His physical body, comparable to a demon cultivator's, could still withstand it. After a brief moment of concentration, he exhaled a turbid breath and entered a meditative state.</p><p>His cultivation method circulated, completing a cycle in an instant. True Essence enveloped the poison, and his breathing gradually calmed.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, raised his hands, and swiftly formed a hand seal. A peculiar fluctuation immediately surged within his body.</p><p>This fluctuation was extremely strange. Transmitted through his True Essence, it influenced the poison, causing it to gradually vibrate.</p><p>Through this fluctuation, Qin Sang gained preliminary control over the poison. Changing the hand seal, the poison immediately began to separate. A small amount of impurities was extracted, and the remainder transformed into the purest form of toxic power.</p><p>At this moment, the toxic power and Qin Sang's True Essence remained distinct, yet there were signs of fusion.</p><p>As time passed, the toxic power was gradually refined, merging with his True Essence, proving the feasibility of this path.  The subsequent process was rather smooth.  Before long, all the fierce poison taken into his body was refined.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, revealing a look of pleasant surprise.</p><p>Perhaps because the toxic essence he refined was still minimal, or perhaps the cultivation method was truly as unique as anticipated, Qin Sang's True Essence showed no signs of disorder.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed for a moment, then immediately activated the Poison Pearl, separating out more fierce poison and refining it continuously. In a short time, he achieved what would have taken several days of arduous work previously.</p><p>During the refinement process, Qin Sang also sensed the presence of residual poison accumulating within his blood and bones.</p><p>If this continued, it would surely become a hidden danger.</p><p>Qin Sang drew upon the residual poison, activating the poison-tempering body refining secret art.  He mobilized the residual poison that had invaded his blood and bones. A more intense pain surged, as if his entire body, including his bone marrow, was being scoured by a potent poison, his flesh seemingly on the verge of melting.</p><p>However, this level of pain couldn't move Qin Sang. He sat cross-legged on the meditation mat, his body motionless, his vital energy surging within him, reaching a peak before slowly receding.</p><p>After completing the cultivation cycle, Qin Sang's face showed a contemplative expression as he recalled the entire process of refining the toxic essence and tempering his body with the poison.</p><p>Inspecting his inner body again, there was indeed still residual poison. Though incredibly minute after the double refinement, it undeniably existed, like a persistent affliction, deep within his bone marrow, extremely difficult to eradicate.</p><p>He had just begun cultivating. If he were to expel the poison through breathing exercises now, he could still eradicate it completely, but it would inevitably consume time. Doing so would defeat the purpose of rapid advancement; it would be better to cultivate normally.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Poison Pearl and activated the poison-repelling radiant light. As hoped, it forced out some more residual poison, far more easily than expelling it through breathing exercises.</p><p>He focused his senses; it seemed the residual poison within his body had been purged.</p><p>This demonstrated the Poison Pearl's importance to him, at least in the initial stages of cultivation, capable of resolving the hidden dangers of the poison cultivation.</p><p>Through repeated attempts, various problems were verified one by one, gradually developing in the direction Qin Sang had hoped.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang opened the Thousand Jun Ring, from which a jade bottle flew out. Inside the jade bottle was a single drop of flower dew.</p><p>According to the *Poison God Canon*, flower dew was one of the most suitable poisons for cultivation. Firstly, it was easier to refine; secondly, the amount of residual poison would be less than other fierce poisons.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade bottle opened. Qin Sang opened his mouth and inhaled, swallowing the flower dew.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As if he had swallowed a ball of fire, it immediately exploded within his body. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly; he hadn't expected the toxicity to be so violent.  He hurriedly focused his mind and entered meditation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the initial burst, the flower dew gradually subsided.  The refinement process was exceptionally smooth, truly as recorded in the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't detect the resentment energy he was most concerned about during the flower dew refinement.</p><p>“Is its influence subtle, even imperceptible to me? Or...is the flower dew exceptionally pure, truly impervious to resentment energy?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. After pondering for a moment, he retrieved the round pearl and opened the seal upon it.</p><p>The round pearl was like water.  Qin Sang attempted to draw out the flower poison within, immediately triggering a violent reaction.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was prepared and successfully extracted a trace of flower poison.</p><p>Compared to the flower dew, this trace of flower poison was completely fused with resentment energy, inseparable.</p><p>Qin Sang employed the same technique, refining the flower poison, and immediately sensed the difference.</p><p>Silently and imperceptibly, the resentment energy within the flower poison spread throughout his body, invading his Purple Mansion, strangely drawn towards his Nascent Soul as if attracted by something. Qin Sang tried every method, yet he couldn't stop the resentment energy's invasion.</p><p>However, the resentment energy finally encountered an impenetrable barrier, completely blocked.</p><p>The resentment energy, its efforts futile, lingered for a while before gradually dissipating.</p><p>Qin Sang truly sensed every subtle change in the resentment energy and nodded inwardly. He didn't need to worry about it.</p><p>However, due to the presence of resentment energy, the refinement process wasn't as smooth as with the flower dew, and the residual poison was greater. It was still best to use flower dew for cultivation.</p><p>At this point, all of Qin Sang's questions had been answered. He could proceed without worry.</p><p>A trace of fatigue flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. The entire process had been extremely mentally taxing. He slowly ceased his cultivation and rose, walking out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>Standing at the mountain peak, he gazed at the surrounding mountains and flower fields.</p><p>The vast world was truly full of wonders, beyond the imagination of ordinary people.  There were such peculiar flowers in this world, and a hidden field of them deep within the Healing Altar.</p><p>“The flower dew doesn’t mature all at once. I’ll have to collect it periodically, requiring frequent travel between the two locations…”</p><p>Qin Sang realized a problem.  He couldn’t entrust the flower dew collection to anyone else; he had to do it himself.</p><p>If he continued cultivating on Sword Heart Island, not to mention the travel time required…</p><p>The current situation was unstable.  The Ghost Fang Kingdom was actively promoting the Demon God in the Demonic Wasteland, and the Celestial Court remained hidden, potentially sparking conflict at any moment. The Demonic Wasteland wasn't safe either.</p><p>He looked around, an idea forming.  How about staying here to cultivate from now on?</p><p>If the cultivators of this world knew his thoughts, they would surely think Qin Sang had gone mad.</p><p>Entering the Demonic Wasteland, the erosion of one's Nascent Soul by the chaotic natural energies intensified.</p><p>It was said that in the deepest reaches of the Demonic Wasteland, even the stabilizing effect of Dharma treasures on True Essence would fail. Of course, most cultivators lacked the ability to venture that far.</p><p>The location of the Healing Altar within Mount Ju wasn't deep enough. True Essence could remain stable, but even a Soul Formation expert like Dong Xuan Zhenren would fear the confusion of the mind and wouldn't dare stay at the Healing Altar for too long.</p><p>Not only was Qin Sang unafraid, but he increasingly felt this plan was excellent.</p><p>For him, cultivating here was indeed an optimal choice.</p><p>Secluded here, no one would disturb him.</p><p>As long as he didn't leave, no matter how chaotic the outside world became, it wouldn't affect him.</p><p>The Ghost Fang Kingdom and the Celestial Court might still clash over the Healing Altar, but Nascent Soul experts wouldn't dare enter it.</p><p>When he had time, he could open a path between the Poison Lake and the jungle illusion, backing onto both locations. Qin Sang was confident he could contend with any powerful enemy.</p><p>“No, I almost forgot about them…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the Skyeye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede, nearly overlooked by him.</p><p>He had the Jade Buddha, but the two spirit insects relied on the Healing Altar and the Inner Truth he manifested for protection.</p><p>“The Skyeye Butterfly can also benefit from the Jade Buddha's protection to some extent, so I shouldn’t worry. The Inner Truth I manifest also carries the Jade Buddha's aura, unlike the other guardian deities. I just don’t know how long the Fire Jade Centipede can last. If it can hold out for three to five years, it’ll be alright. I can’t abandon my refinement path midway.  I need to consult Zhi Jian Zhenren about swordsmanship and obtain the Radiant Flower Pill for the Skyeye Butterfly. I'll definitely return during that time and help it recover. Otherwise…could I ask someone to care for it?”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Healing Altar and called out the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Over the past ten years, the Fire Jade Centipede had consumed the leftover spirit herbs from the Skyeye Butterfly, making significant progress. If it could successfully transform, it could barely keep pace with him. Otherwise, it would eventually become useless.</p><p>“Let’s see what fate has in store for you!”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, having made his decision. No matter what, his own cultivation took priority.</p><p>Before that, he had to return to Mount Ju once. There were still some matters that needed proper arrangement.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally listed each item, his hands swiftly forming hand seals, sparing no spirit materials as he refined formation tools on the spot, doing his utmost to repair this formation.</p><p>This place would be his cultivation sanctuary; naturally, it needed meticulous arrangement.</p><p>After a period of busy work, the spirit formation was completely renewed. Qin Sang flew into the sky, overlooking the land with a satisfied expression.  With a thought, he activated another transformation of the spirit formation.</p><p>Outside the space, the poisonous mist and violent winds intensified.  Eventually, the outer layer of poisonous water was also impacted, filled with raging currents and whirlpools, flashing with dangerous poisonous restrictive light, deterring anyone from approaching.</p><p>Even powerful Celestial Court officials, upon seeing this scene at the Healing Altar of Mount Ju, would retreat, preferring to detour unless they had a compelling reason to enter.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took out some formation flags and arranged them layer by layer.</p><p>Even if someone infiltrated the Poison Lake, they would be lost within, unable to find this flower field space.</p><p>After ensuring absolute security, Qin Sang finally stopped, looking at his cultivation sanctuary with a smile.</p><p>He chose the highest peak in this area and opened another cave dwelling, setting up multiple seals around the aperture.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the strange poison that killed the Core Disciple of Mole Cricket Mountain originated from this aperture.</p><p>This poison was so potent that Qin Sang didn't dare underestimate it.</p><p>The aperture wouldn't erupt without reason, but the conflict between the Celestial Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom might trigger that golden light again, causing changes in the aperture.  He needed to take precautions.</p><p>Apart from this, there were almost no other changes.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his breath for a moment and then vanished from the space.</p><p>The unusual phenomena here were all generated by the spirit formation and couldn't harm Qin Sang. His figure flashed repeatedly, his destination not the exit of the Poison Lake but further into its depths.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived at the other side of the Poison Lake, his figure appearing at the edge.</p><p>“Eh?  There’s a vast expanse of auspicious clouds here…”</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the Poison Lake and discovered auspicious clouds separating the Poison Lake and the next illusion.</p><p>The moment he stepped into the auspicious clouds, a rumbling thunderous roar resounded in his ears.  Qin Sang passed through the clouds and saw a pitch-black expanse before him.</p><p>The night was boundless, yet not peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, lightning tore through the darkness, as if splitting open a crack in the void, its power terrifying.</p><p>The instant the lightning appeared, Qin Sang's heart outside the illusion pounded heavily, a sense of danger arising within him.</p><p>Having received the High Divine Firmament Scripture and cultivated three types of lightning talismans, Qin Sang was extremely sensitive to the power of thunder.  He confirmed that it wasn't true lightning, but something even more dangerous.</p><p>The ‘lightning’ vanished in a flash.  He waited for a long time before another bolt descended, its might no less formidable.</p><p>The rest of the time, the night remained tranquil, a strange and eerie silence.</p><p>“I’ll explore this later,” Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Cultivating in the poison domain, he had plenty of time.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons Qin Sang chose to stay, to independently open a path to the depths of the Healing Altar while awaiting news from Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>His arrangements for his return were also mainly related to Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang patrolled the vicinity for a while longer, observing the surroundings before flying outwards.</p><p>The two Zhenren had already embarked on their return journey.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the way he came, encountering no one until the entrance of the Healing Altar. He then traversed the Demonic Wasteland alone, encountering no obstacles along the way.  Soon, Mount Ju was in sight.</p><p>Returning to Mount Ju, Qin Sang made some minor adjustments and headed straight for Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Sword Heart Orchids covered the island, vibrant and full of life. Several halls were nestled amidst the dense forest.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang appeared above Sword Heart Island, he immediately alerted the Sword Slave.</p><p>The Sword Slave swiftly flew into the sky. Seeing Qin Sang, he was overjoyed.  “Zhenren has returned safely!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. “Have Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren been here?”</p><p>The Sword Slave nodded repeatedly.  “Not long ago, the two Zhenren visited the island, saying that Zhenren had encountered danger…”</p><p>As he spoke, the Sword Slave took out a token and crushed it, his face beaming with joy. “Master isn’t in his cave dwelling. I was just about to gather people to rescue Zhenren from the Demonic Wasteland. Knowing that Zhenren is safe and sound, he will be greatly relieved.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.  He hadn’t expected Zhi Jian Zhenren to go to such lengths for him.  After a moment of silence, he returned to the island with the Sword Slave.</p><p>Not long after, the sound of something breaking through the air came from outside the island.  A streak of light rapidly approached.</p><p>Qin Sang rose to his feet.  Before seeing anyone, he heard hearty laughter. “My dear friend, as expected, good fortune attends the virtuous!”</p><p>Before the words had finished echoing, three figures entered one after another.</p><p>The speaker was none other than Zhi Jian Zhenren, followed by Bo Xian Shanren and You Huang Zhenren.</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren looked somewhat weary.  Seeing Qin Sang, he revealed a look of immense relief, bowing respectfully. “It was indeed our fault that Zhenren was implicated.  A stroke of luck! A stroke of luck!”</p><p>You Huang Zhenren glanced around with her beautiful eyes, covering her lips with a light chuckle. “How about it?  I said that Qing Feng Zhenren possesses extraordinary abilities, beyond our comparison. How amusing that the two of you were so anxious…”</p><p>Saying so, she looked at Qin Sang. “Upon hearing the dreadful news, Zhi Jian Zhenren immediately contacted us, rushing around, sparing no effort to gather poison-repelling treasures to rescue Zhenren, determined to see you alive or retrieve your body! If Zhenren had returned any later, we would have almost completely plundered Mount Ju’s poison-repelling treasures.”</p><p>Bo Xian Shanren also added, “Qing Dan Daoyou is currently making his rounds among the Daoist sects and will soon arrive to join us.”</p><p>Qin Sang composed his expression, bowing deeply and offering a sincere salute. A thousand words converged into a single expression of gratitude.</p><p>As the saying goes, adversity reveals true character.</p><p>It was evident that Zhi Jian Zhenren was the driving force.</p><p>His relationship with Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren was casual. Without Zhi Jian Zhenren’s insistence, they might not have been so dedicated.</p><p>“The path of cultivation is arduous. We cultivators should naturally support and help each other. It's nothing worth mentioning,” Zhi Jian Zhenren patted Qin Sang’s shoulder.  “It’s good that you’ve returned, my friend. This experience, though perilous, may not be a bad thing.”</p><p>Everyone took their seats, inquiring about Qin Sang’s experience.</p><p>Qin Sang, naturally, had prepared an explanation. When he reached the most dangerous parts of his story, the Zhenren’s expressions also changed in alarm.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren instructed the Sword Slave to prepare a banquet to calm Qin Sang’s nerves.</p><p>The banquet concluded late at night, and the two Zhenren returned contentedly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhi Jian Zhenren enjoyed a few drinks under the moon.</p><p>“To be frank with you, Brother, although this experience was extremely perilous, it was also a stroke of fortune, greatly benefiting my future cultivation. However, I can no longer continue cultivating on Sword Heart Island and must leave for a long time.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren drained his cup of fine wine.</p><p>In the cultivation world, turning misfortune into blessing wasn’t uncommon.</p><p>He wasn't surprised and didn’t ask about the nature of the opportunity, only saying,  “If you have any needs, my friend, just speak.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, smiling. “I’ve always remembered our agreement to discuss swordsmanship, Brother. I will still return frequently and impose upon you.”</p>
