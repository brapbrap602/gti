<h1>Chapter 713: The Thieves</h1><p>Qin Sang increasingly felt this possibility was significant.</p><p>"A blessing in disguise, indeed.  After all this, it would end up here. Whether my guess is right or wrong, venturing into the lair is worth the risk."</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang immediately left the cave, ascertained his direction, and swiftly flew towards the snowy mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Snow covered everything, the snowy mountain towering.</p><p>From the outside, the Que Firebird nest appeared normal, but Qin Sang waited a while, yet saw no Que Firebirds going out to forage.</p><p>Something was amiss!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered briefly, his figure silently disappearing into the void, silently approaching the island where the snowy mountain stood.  Arriving at the foot of the mountain, he quietly ascended towards the summit.</p><p>His speed was not slow, and he soon reached the vicinity of the summit undetected.</p><p>The summit of the snowy mountain was circular, shaped like a volcanic crater, its depths unseen. Strangely, the area around the crater's mouth was covered in snow, with a constant stream of cold air rising from the bottom, like a glacial cave.</p><p>Because of this, the mountain walls inside the crater were covered with a thick layer of ice, forming an ice wall. The deeper one went, the more spacious it became, countless sharp icicles hanging down, looking extremely dangerous.</p><p>On the ice wall were countless small holes, about the size of a human head, and in these holes resided Que Firebirds!</p><p>Qin Sang crouched at the crater's mouth, staring at the honeycomb-like nest below.  Even here, the Que Firebirds hadn't detected him; Qin Sang's confidence grew.</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of Que Firebirds resided in the crater, yet an unusual quiet reigned. Only at the top of the crater were a few larger Que Firebirds circling, acting as sentinels, their wingbeats audible.</p><p>Apart from them, the other Que Firebirds remained quietly in their nests. Their defense was extremely tight, layer upon layer, well-organized.</p><p>Qin Sang observed silently for a while, touched his corpse puppet bag, and two Flying Night Rakshasas silently flanked the crater's mouth.</p><p>Once in position, at Qin Sang's command, they attacked simultaneously.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The two Flying Night Rakshasas appeared, their fists condensing a mass of corpse energy, striking fiercely into the crater's mouth.</p><p>The top-level Que Firebird sentries were instantly obliterated, and the corpse energy continued to spread, corroding other Que Firebirds.</p><p>Instantly, chaos erupted within the crater, accompanied by screams, as blue figures swarmed out of the crater’s mouth, gradually coalescing into a huge flock of birds in mid-air.</p><p>The flock appeared chaotic, yet followed a certain pattern.</p><p>They shrieked at the rampaging Flying Night Rakshasas; two masses of cold air rapidly condensed within the flock, the intense cold almost solidifying into ice crystals.</p><p>“Their king is indeed absent!  Thankfully, those two ice crystals are incredibly powerful. If the king were here, things would be very different.”</p><p>Silently lying on the snow, Qin Sang sensed the aura of the ice crystals, his expression grave. He hastily ordered the Flying Night Rakshasas to retreat and engage in skirmishes to create a distraction.</p><p>Then, he seized the opportunity to leap into the crater's mouth.</p><p>By now, only a few Que Firebirds remained on guard at the crater’s mouth. As for those Que Firebirds huddled in their nests, they were unlikely to detect his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang successfully evaded the Que Firebirds' perception and swiftly descended.</p><p>The cold intensified below. At the bottom of the crater was a layer of ice of unknown thickness. Qin Sang searched and finally found an ice crevice.</p><p>Passing through the unusually winding crevice, the bottom was not solid, but a large space. Upon seeing the scene within, Qin Sang paused slightly.</p><p>Deep within this space, a mass of exceptionally pure cold air swirled, refusing to dissipate.</p><p>At the heart of the cold air, a palm-sized jade tree could be vaguely seen!</p><p>“Ten Thousand Years Camphor!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up; he had finally found it!</p><p>But he did not get carried away, carefully surveying his surroundings. Three Que Firebirds, all at the peak of the Yao Spirit stage, guarded the outside of the cold air; no other Que Firebirds were present.</p><p>“It seems their king has indeed been called away. These three guards are nothing to worry about. The cold air, however, is a problem.  It's likely left by the Que Firebirds’ king to protect the Ten Thousand Years Camphor, probably a concentration of the entire flock's power, making it very difficult. Fortunately, this creature doesn't seem to be a cultivator proficient in prohibitions; the method used for this cold air is crude, leaving some room for exploitation.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, quietly summoning the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and with a gesture, three streams of Nine Netherworld Magic Fire shot towards the three Que Firebirds.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's premeditated ambush, the three Que Huo Que offered little resistance.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>Three sharp sounds echoed as the Que Huo Que's vital points were pierced by demonic flames, causing them to fall to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang darted to the icy aura, observed it for a moment, then after a brief contemplation, gathered all the Nine Netherworld Demon Flames into a single black sword, fiercely stabbing into the icy mass.</p><p>A strange sound rang out, and the swirling icy aura abruptly became much more sluggish, wobbling incessantly.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Flames were indeed the Que Huo Que's nemesis. A slight smile appeared on Qin Sang's face as they continued to pour more true energy into the demonic banner.</p><p>The icy aura's fluctuations became increasingly violent. With a loud boom, a breach finally opened.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang darted inside, instantly feeling a wave of coolness wash over them.</p><p>The icy aura, naturally countering the Nine Netherworld Demon Flames, was slowly closing in. Time was of the essence. Qin Sang took out a golden knife, crouched down, and examined the jade tree.</p><p>The jade tree, only palm-sized, had its roots deeply embedded in the subterranean ice layer.  It possessed a rough trunk and lush foliage, all complete. The jade's intense green hue gave off a vibrant feeling of life.</p><p>Unless one knew the truth, who could imagine this was merely a peculiar jade, devoid of life?</p><p>Wan Shi Zhang fears gold.</p><p>Holding the jade box in one hand and the golden knife in the other, Qin Sang carefully slid the knife past the Wan Shi Zhang's roots, effortlessly severing it and placing it into the jade box.</p><p>As long as the roots weren't disturbed, the Wan Shi Zhang would gradually regrow.  Qin Sang naturally wouldn't resort to such an unsustainable practice.</p><p>Having obtained the Wan Shi Zhang, Qin Sang immediately retreated, put away the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, and left without looking back.</p><p>The mountaintop was already in chaos.  The Flying Sky Yasha, obeying Qin Sang's orders, had diverted the Que Huo Que's attention, enduring countless blasts of icy aura, and was forced to flee in disarray.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared, retrieved the Flying Sky Yasha, and immediately activated a talisman, speeding away.</p><p>The Que Huo Que pursued for a while but was easily outdistanced by Qin Sang, returning empty-handed.</p><p>Finally achieving their goal, Qin Sang felt relieved.  They identified their direction and flew straight south.</p><p>After flying to the edge of this sea area—beyond which lay unexplored territory—Qin Sang found an island with a spirit vein, established a cave dwelling, and prepared to reside there permanently.</p><p>After completing other tasks, Qin Sang took out the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring (Yin Ring), the Wan Shi Zhang, and several other spiritual materials, preparing to begin refining a magical artifact.</p>
