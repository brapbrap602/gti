<h1>Chapter 1417: Defying Fate</h1><p>A sudden tombstone, and the inscription upon it.</p><p>Qin Sang froze, completely taken aback.</p><p>"Tan Hao?"</p><p>One of Qin Sang's reasons for coming to the North Sea was to search for Tan Hao and the mysterious Ghost Mother.</p><p>He had followed the Wind Master, traversing half of the Half-Moon Realm, to no avail.</p><p>He had planned to thoroughly investigate the Boundless Sea after the Jing Hai Sect matter was resolved.  The Boundless Sea was the most complex and chaotic region in the North Sea, making any action easier and avoiding the hostility of the entire continent.</p><p>A mysterious being like the Ghost Mother was most likely to appear here.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he discovered Tan Hao's trace under these circumstances.</p><p>"Tan Hao and the Ghost Mother were the ones who harvested those spirit herbs.  This means the phenomenon that attracted Daoist Qi was likely caused by their arrival.  Is the Ghost Mother a Buddhist master?"</p><p>Qin Sang observed his surroundings, walked towards the hill, and stopped before the tombstone. The inscription on the tombstone carried a strong sense of sorrow.</p><p>"Since parting at Yin Mountain Pass, Tan Hao has been tirelessly working to revive Tan Jie, for a hundred years. Given their brotherhood, as long as there was a sliver of hope, Tan Hao would never give up. He succeeded in finding and rescuing the mysterious figure behind the Heavenly Corpse Sect, yet here he erected a tombstone for Tan Jie. Even the Ghost Mother couldn't revive Tan Jie…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the tombstone, his heart heavy.</p><p>From the Cang Lang Sea to the Xiao Han Domain and the Abyss of Sin, and then tracking to the North Sea.</p><p>The mute woman's condition had gradually improved. Qin Sang had thought finding the Ghost Mother would be the key to her awakening. Seeing Tan Jie's tomb, Qin Sang realized things might not be so simple.</p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p>Tan Jie's tomb was here; Tan Hao shouldn't be far away.</p><p>"They wouldn't be using the Jing Hai Sect as a dwelling, would they?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, putting away his demonic fire and Golden Sinking Sword, but remained somewhat wary of the Ghost Mother, concealing his demonic banner in his sleeve, ready to strike at any moment.</p><p>His gaze shifted, over the hill, towards the stone wall.</p><p>After staring for a moment, he noticed something unusual.</p><p>The seemingly ordinary stone wall concealed a restriction within, a hidden world.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A ripple suddenly appeared within the stone wall, accompanied by a 'click-click' sound.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he stopped.</p><p>He saw the scene on the stone wall suddenly change, revealing a clearly man-made cave, the stone door pushed open from the inside, and a figure emerged.</p><p>It was Tan Hao!</p><p>"Late Golden Core… No! Peak Golden Core stage, only a step away from Nascent Soul."</p><p>Qin Sang discerned Tan Hao's current cultivation.</p><p>Given his age, there was a considerable chance of him breaking through to Nascent Soul.</p><p>The true essence within Tan Hao's body showed clear signs of instability, seemingly caused by the forced interruption of some secret technique. Fortunately, it wasn't serious.</p><p>The stone door opened.</p><p>Tan Hao pushed the door open, without summoning any magic treasures.</p><p>He skillfully cast an incantation, his pupils gleaming with light, just as he was about to look into the purple mist to observe the situation, he suddenly saw a strange figure in front of Tan Jie's tomb, and was startled.</p><p>Qin Sang had deliberately concealed his aura; Tan Hao hadn't noticed an extra person here.</p><p>In an instant, Tan Hao's hair stood on end, his face filled with terror, and he unhesitatingly summoned his innate magic treasure. But when he saw the person's face, a familiar feeling welled up in his heart, and Tan Hao froze in place.</p><p>"You are… Qin…"</p><p>Tan Hao's voice trembled, his face full of disbelief.</p><p>They had been separated for too long.</p><p>If it weren't for the enduring gratitude Tan Hao felt towards Qin Sang for their kindness to him and his brother, he wouldn't have recognized Qin Sang at a glance.</p><p>Tan Hao still couldn't believe that Qin Sang would appear here.</p><p>After their separation at Yin Mountain Pass, he had traveled widely, participating in the Three Realms War, and had not received any news about Qin Sang.  Even if he found it hard to accept, he understood that Qin Sang was most likely deceased.</p><p>A long-lost acquaintance, thought to be separated by life and death, suddenly appeared before him, and in the most improbable of places.</p><p>It was like a dream.</p><p>"Brother Tan, long time no see."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was complex.</p><p>It had indeed been a long time—nearly three hundred years.</p><p>For a time, the two men stood there speechless.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed Tan Hao's cave dwelling and found it quite simple, seemingly only inhabited by him, and didn't know where the Ghost Mother was cultivating.</p><p>Tan Hao took a deep breath, suppressing his turbulent thoughts, looked deeply at Qin Sang, and smiled, "Brother Qin, it seems you've surpassed me again, haven't you?"</p><p>When he was awakened in his cave, he had checked, and had not detected Qin Sang's presence.  If Qin Sang hadn't revealed himself, he would probably still be in the dark.</p><p>In Tan Hao's eyes, Qin Sang was exceptionally mysterious, his cultivation level impossible to discern.</p><p>There was only one explanation: Qin Sang's cultivation far surpassed his.</p><p>Tan Hao recalled their first meeting at Yinshan Pass, a similar scene.  Thanks to the Foundation Establishment Pill Qin Sang had given him, he'd been lucky enough to reach that stage.  Over the years, he'd had many fortunate encounters, leading to his current cultivation level. He expected to reach the Nascent Soul stage before 400, yet he still lagged behind Qin Sang. He remembered Qin Sang, his junior brother, having seemed to be a four or five-spirit-root cultivator…</p><p>"Just fortunate," Qin Sang replied,  a slight nod, saying little about himself.  He looked down at the tombstone, his voice low, "Tan Jie… my brother…"</p><p>"Fate is unyielding!" Tan Hao shook his head, bitterness lacing his tone, a profound sense of helplessness evident.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Tan Hao's feeling – the agonizing pursuit for centuries, only to find it all an illusion. The cultivation world was brutally unforgiving.  Tan Hao, with his temperament, needed no comfort.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then said, "A century ago, I went to Yinshan Pass, hoping to find you. I met Yi En, and he told me about you."</p><p>"Yi En? How is he?" Tan Hao's eyes lit up, eager to hear news.</p><p>"Don't worry, Yi En is well. He's already formed his Golden Core. I founded a sect, and he handles the mundane affairs," Qin Sang briefly summarized.</p><p>Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief, murmuring, "That's good… that's good…" He had sacrificed so much for his brother, including his own flesh and blood, and felt guilty towards Tan Yi En.</p><p>Qin Sang chose his words carefully, "Yi En has been searching for you. We found some of your friends, who said you'd discovered information about the Heavenly Corpse Sect and infiltrated the Abyss of Sin. I followed the trail, eventually finding the Heavenly Corpse Sect's main headquarters and the underwater prison in Yuanxu."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking at Tan Hao.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed, "You went to so much trouble."</p><p>He then recounted his experiences in the Abyss of Sin without reservation, aligning with the clues Qin Sang had discovered.  He’d heard a mysterious person calling to him at a Heavenly Corpse Sect branch, leading him to the main headquarters. In exchange for reviving Tan Jie, he released a mysterious person imprisoned in the underwater cell, who then brought him to the North Sea.  That person was Gui Mu!</p><p>"Senior Gui Mu was trapped in the underwater prison, severely injured and extremely weak. She managed to suppress her injuries, recovering some of her strength. She taught me a combined attack technique, and together we activated a protective treasure to cross the storm belt.  Senior Gui Mu obtained a treasure she had left behind in the North Sea, which allowed her to heal and regain her full strength." Tan Hao explained.</p><p>"A treasure left behind?" Qin Sang detected something amiss. "Was that senior mistakenly imprisoned there?"</p>
