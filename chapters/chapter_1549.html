<h1>Chapter 1540: The Restraining Blade (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1540: The Restraining Blade (4k)</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's cultivation was already at the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage, only a step away from the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At this moment, he possessed the formidable strength comparable to a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>This secret technique was a self-harming method; after the technique's duration ended, Venerable Chengyuan would need decades of quiet cultivation to recover.</p><p>Yet, he didn't hesitate to use it.</p><p>The opponent had two experts of the same level.</p><p>Reinforcements couldn't arrive in time.</p><p>The temple's protective formation primarily defended against external enemies; since the opponents had already succeeded, they would undoubtedly focus on escaping, significantly reducing the formation's effectiveness.</p><p>The relic was formed from the failed breakthrough of Master Hongyi, making its purpose easy to guess.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan had been stuck at the late Nascent Soul bottleneck for many years, unable to find a way forward. The relic's significance to him was self-evident and couldn't be lost.</p><p>Even at the cost of everything, he would not hesitate!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was a devout monk; decades of silent meditation in the Zen hall were commonplace. His unwavering resolve was unparalleled, rarely disturbed by external matters.</p><p>Yet now, Venerable Chengyuan's face was filled with killing intent, his eyes like blades.</p><p>The relic was crucial in the struggle for the Dao.</p><p>Once missed, he might be forever stuck at this level.</p><p>Cultivators encountering such an opportunity would undoubtedly fight for it relentlessly, risking their lives!</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his focus from the relic to Venerable Chengyuan. Sensing the change in Venerable Chengyuan's aura, his gaze darkened slightly, realizing he had encountered a formidable opponent.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>With a rapid flapping of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang moved with effortless grace, transforming into a streak of lightning and instantly fleeing the pagoda forest towards the temple's exterior.</p><p>Although his escape speed was fast, it was not as quick as Venerable Chengyuan's ability to teleport using the formation.</p><p>Having just crossed the vast bamboo forest behind Zhulan Temple, Qin Sang saw the void ripple ahead, and Venerable Chengyuan's figure appeared out of thin air, instantly blocking his path.</p><p>Before Venerable Chengyuan's figure fully solidified, a blade light erupted.</p><p>The blade light originated from Venerable Chengyuan's heart.</p><p>The blade was only four fingers long, shaped like a bird's feather, light and thin as gauze.</p><p>This was the Restraining Blade!</p><p>It was also Venerable Chengyuan's life-bound treasure.</p><p>The Restraining Blade.</p><p>A blade of restraint.</p><p>Yet in Venerable Chengyuan's hands, it was an absolute instrument of slaughter.</p><p>While in secluded meditation at the cliff face, Venerable Chengyuan's hands had long been free of blood.  The Restraining Blade, though sheathed, was like a caged tiger, its ferocity undiminished. Venerable Chengyuan's killing intent had been infused into the blade's spirit, nurtured for years.</p><p>Once unsheathed, the blade light split the sun.</p><p>The air was thick with killing intent, a mournful wind swept through.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was completely filled by this blade; the sun seemed to be split in two.</p><p>It was already late autumn.</p><p>Influenced by the blade's intent, the surrounding area was even colder, feeling like the depths of winter.</p><p>"Not a pseudo-spiritual treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression calm.</p><p>Sensing the Restraining Blade's aura, he determined it to be a top-grade treasure.</p><p>Perhaps it was a special advantage of Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed that many Buddhist cultivators in the Western Desert possessed stronger spiritual senses than their peers.</p><p>As expected, Venerable Chengyuan's spiritual sense had reached the transformative stage, allowing him to cultivate the *Sacrifice-Origin Technique*, but the Restraining Blade's power remained within the realm of a treasure.</p><p>This shows that the *Sacrifice-Origin Technique*, a secret method for nurturing pseudo-spiritual treasures, wasn't commonplace in Central Plains, or at least not widely known in the Western Desert.</p><p>After encountering that Eight-Scene cultivator, Qin Sang had thought that, apart from the Sun God Tree, his other treasures wouldn't hold much of an advantage in Central Plains, so he overestimated Venerable Chengyuan's strength and avoided rash actions.</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Venerable Chengyuan focused on breaking through and didn't want to be distracted, as cultivating the *Sacrifice-Origin Technique* required considerable effort.</p><p>Cultivators prioritize realm; that time would be better spent searching for a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>In any case, without a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even if Venerable Chengyuan were a true Grand Cultivator, Qin Sang wasn't afraid, especially since his strength was forcibly enhanced.</p><p>"Excellent swordsmanship!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, his demonic banner fluttering.</p><p>The blade light shot towards him; Qin Sang was locked on by the Restraining Blade.</p><p>Although it was only a top-grade treasure, Venerable Chengyuan had nurtured its intent for countless years.  The Restraining Blade's first unsheathing held unparalleled power and couldn't be underestimated.</p><p>For other mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, a single misstep could result in their bodies being cleaved in two.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain between his brows, a feeling of being split in half.</p><p>He remained calm, stopping his escape and unleashing the demonic fire!</p><p>The black demonic fire transformed into a dark cloud; wherever the flames spread, rocks and bamboo turned to ash.</p><p>The demonic fire retracted suddenly, transforming into a fiery dragon that soared into the air, directly attacking the ritual knife!</p><p>For decades, Storm-Belt had dedicated almost all his time to cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus".  Qin Sang's spiritual awareness had greatly increased, allowing him to refine more demonic fire within the fire lotus.  Consequently, he could now control a far greater quantity of demonic fire, dramatically enhancing its power.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan felt a chill run down his spine upon sensing the fiery dragon's might.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The blade's light sliced into the demonic fire dragon, piercing from its head straight through its abdomen.</p><p>The thin ritual knife was incredibly sharp.</p><p>The upper half of the demonic fire dragon was severed, its tail remaining attached, forming a two-headed black serpent.  However, the knife's intent was significantly weakened after cleaving the demonic fire. Qin Sang flapped his wings, simultaneously performing the Heart Lotus Seal, and moved aside to evade the attack.</p><p>"A pseudo-spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan exclaimed softly, his fingers moving like spinning wheels as he quickly formed a hand seal.</p><p>Instantly, the mountaintop was filled with swirling winds.</p><p>The temple's protective formation descended, showering down countless golden rays.</p><p>As the saying goes, speed is key in battle.</p><p>If the Zhu Lan Temple monks could have formed their formation in time and jointly controlled the protective array to reinforce Venerable Chengyuan, the pressure on Qin Sang would have greatly increased.  However, from the moment Qin Sang and Liuli began their attack until now, only a fleeting moment had passed. The Zhu Lan Temple monks were scattered throughout the temple, each performing their own duties.  Even with their rigorous training, they couldn't match the swiftness of a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>The disciples responsible for guarding the formation could only maintain its basic defensive capabilities, creating a golden dome covering the temple.  The speed at which they could shift the formation's configuration was far too slow to keep up with the battle.</p><p>Knowing the critical situation, all the monks' faces were filled with anger as they raced towards the back mountain.</p><p>For the time being, Venerable Chengyuan had to multitask, personally managing the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his eyes meeting the dazzling golden light cascading from the heavens like a rain of spears. Feeling the pressure, he quickly activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl within his body, activating his protective energy shield.  Simultaneously, he changed his hand seal, and the demonic fire soared into the air, transforming into a black cloud to block the attack.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Golden light rained down like arrows, covering the sky.</p><p>Flames flickered within the black cloud, showing signs of dispersal.</p><p>Unrelenting, Venerable Chengyuan trembled his ritual knife, preparing to strike again, when he suddenly heard two strange sounds, "Humph! Ha!", which shook his primordial spirit.</p><p>"Child's play!"</p><p>A surge of blood rushed to Venerable Chengyuan's withered face as he roared in anger. The bell sound within him rang incessantly, and bell shadows appeared around him, though the range was much smaller than before, only covering his head, shaking repeatedly.</p><p>Aware of Qin Sang's powerful spiritual awareness—an unprecedented foe—he naturally guarded against such attacks on his primordial spirit. This bronze bell was a defensive treasure; it not only protected his body, but its sound possessed special power to safeguard his primordial spirit.</p><p>The bell's sound dispersed the "Humph! Ha!" sounds, significantly weakening the Soul-Capturing Incantation's power.  Furthermore, Venerable Chengyuan's spiritual awareness was inherently strong, making the damage negligible.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to seriously injure Venerable Chengyuan with the Soul-Capturing Incantation.  His aim was to create an opportunity for Liuli!</p><p>While Venerable Chengyuan's primordial spirit was under attack, Liuli had already arrived, repeating her tactic. The Ice Soul Divine Light silently spread beneath Venerable Chengyuan, then suddenly erupted.</p><p>Unfortunately, the opponent was also a seasoned top-tier expert; the same trick was unlikely to work twice.  Venerable Chengyuan, anticipating Liuli's move, evaded the Soul-Capturing Incantation and instantly relocated, causing the Ice Soul Divine Light to miss its target.</p><p>A gleam flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Years of studying the Zhu Lan Temple's protective formation hadn't been in vain.  Using his Celestial Eye ability, he sensed the changes in the formation's energy, enabling him to determine Venerable Chengyuan's approximate location after his relocation.  He immediately manipulated the demonic fire, changing its direction to surge towards an empty void.</p><p>The timing was crucial, and such judgments were prone to errors. Moreover, the scattered demonic fire had reduced power.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan reappeared at the edge of the demonic fire's range, his ritual knife spinning rapidly as he slashed dozens of times.  Waves of blade energy bloomed like lotuses, repelling the approaching demonic fire.</p><p>Simultaneously, Venerable Chengyuan chanted a Buddhist mantra and performed a single-handed earth-touching seal.  A golden ring suddenly erupted from the ground.</p><p>The golden ring appeared directly beneath Qin Sang. This was the only method Venerable Chengyuan could think of to trap Qin Sang after witnessing his strength. Secretly, he had concentrated most of the protective formation's power here, setting a trap.  Once entangled by the golden ring, Qin Sang would be trapped, requiring considerable effort to escape.</p><p>By then, reinforcements had arrived.  The masters from various temples joined forces, cornering the two thieves within Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>Jin Huan soared, swift as lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed helpless, his brow furrowed deeply.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable subtly angled his ceremonial knife towards Liuli, preventing the nun from intervening, while simultaneously concentrating his power on the spirit array, imprisoning Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden flash of cold light erupted from Liuli's position.</p><p>Catching a glimpse of a strangely shaped small seal, Chengyuan Venerable's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Under the cold sun, the giant serpent revived.</p><p>The roar echoed across the oasis. The devout people, upon hearing the sound, looked up at the sky in terror. A fearsome monster, clawing and gnashing its teeth, tore through the golden glow, appearing vicious and menacing.</p><p>The Buddha within the golden glow disappeared, seemingly swallowed whole by the monster.</p><p>Tears streamed down everyone's faces as wails of grief rose.</p><p>The four-headed serpent seal, given to Liuli, had been refined for many years and recognized her as its master.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation was inferior to Tong Lingyu's, yet the spiritual treasure seemed even more potent in her hands, and she showed no great strain. This is the significant difference between a spiritual treasure recognizing its master and the *Tongbao Jue* (Treasure Scripture).</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The serpent plunged downwards.</p><p>"A true spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable, losing his composure, was deeply shaken and exclaimed in disbelief.  True spiritual treasures were extremely rare even in Central China.  Their refinement was incredibly difficult, and even if someone painstakingly cultivated a personal treasure to the level of a spiritual treasure, upon the owner's death, its spirit would dissipate, reverting to a mere magical artifact, incapable of being passed down.</p><p>Where did these two devils come from?</p><p>One possessed mysterious abilities and wielded a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The other's escape techniques and spiritual sense were on par with grand masters, wielding a pseudo-spiritual treasure.  Such individuals were rare even among the top sects in Central China. When did these two top experts emerge in the cultivation world?</p><p>The serpent's ferocity, the chilling flames licking at their faces. Chengyuan Venerable no longer bothered with Qin Sang, hastily moving to evade the attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the serpent changed direction, not to rescue Qin Sang, but to join forces with the demonic flames, and amidst the horrified gazes, charged towards the protective barrier above.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Golden light soared.</p><p>The mountains seemed to tremble.</p><p>The oasis lake was thrown into unprecedented turmoil, its waves reaching incredible heights.</p><p>Demonic flames and icy flames raged, an unstoppable inferno.</p><p>The monks controlling the spirit array, still following Chengyuan Venerable's orders, were focused on using the Golden Ring to imprison Qin Sang, and were unable to react. They helplessly watched as a fissure was torn in the temple's protective array from within.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Golden Ring, destabilized by the tremor, showed signs of breaking apart.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, a shout came from outside the temple.</p><p>"Brother Chengyuan, Kongyu has come to assist you!"</p><p>The voice boomed, growing steadily louder.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable.</p><p>A high monk from Luoluo Temple, one of the Seven Stars of the瀚海, a mid-Yuan Ying stage expert. Luoluo Temple, a somewhat unusual name, was named after the unique Luoluo tree of the瀚海.</p><p>Zhurlan Temple is located in the eastern part of the oasis, while Luoluo Temple lies to its east, the closest of the six major temples.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable was indeed the first to arrive.</p><p>The sound, amplified by his true energy, was like thunder.</p><p>A moment later, an old monk clad in a kasaya appeared above Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable held a purple-gold alms bowl in his left hand. His eyes, sharp as lightning, instantly spotted the fissure in the barrier. With a flick of his wrist, he aimed the bowl to seal the crack.</p><p>Suddenly, a fierce gust of wind struck from the side – it was the Jincheng Sword.</p><p>All along, Qin Sang’s external manifestation had been stationed outside the temple, both to intercept reinforcements, preventing their swift arrival, and to be ready for a coordinated internal attack to break the formation.</p><p>The treasure acquisition proceeded more smoothly than expected.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't even needed to use the Sun God Tree.</p><p>There was another one outside!</p><p>The Zhurlan Temple monks, seeing Kongyu Venerable's arrival, had their hopes rekindled, only to be dashed again.</p><p>Chengyuan Venerable could only laugh in anger.</p><p>Three mid-Yuan Ying stage experts making such a fuss around little Zhurlan Temple, he wondered whether to be furious or honored.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword energy approached.</p><p>Kongyu Venerable, unprepared for the ambush outside the temple, was startled. He hurriedly redirected his alms bowl, its mouth aimed at the sword energy, emitting purple-gold light.</p><p>With a 'dong', the sword light was swallowed by the purple-gold light. The Jincheng Sword's momentum faltered, and Kongyu Venerable, though unhurt, was shaken back several hundred meters, rendering him powerless to stop the enemies inside Zhurlan Temple.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two figures emerged from the fissure.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the oasis.</p><p>The boundless sand sea.</p><p>A few Bodhi trees stood solitary in the yellow sand, offering a meager shade to passing monks.</p><p>At that moment, a person sat cross-legged beneath the trees.</p><p>The person, wearing a hat that concealed their face, was nonetheless dressed in heavenly robes and adorned with necklaces, appearing like a Bodhisattva incarnate—the renowned Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>Monks stood in a circle around them.</p><p>Seeing the Moonlight Bodhisattva's audacious attire, the younger monks were filled with anger.</p><p>Venerables Chengzhen and Guan Hui, however, remained unmoved, their voices flying, engrossed in a debate on scriptures.</p><p>At the height of the discussion, Venerable Chengzhen suddenly fell silent, his head drooping in surprise. The jingling of his waist ornaments could be heard as they split in two.  The monks all changed color, falling into an unnerving silence.</p><p>Something had happened at the temple!</p><p>"So, are you venerable monks about to concede defeat? Then leave behind the scriptures from your temple's library."</p><p>Unaware of the situation, Moonlight Bodhisattva chuckled faintly, their voice ethereal.</p>
