<h1>Chapter 1116: Significant Progress in Cultivation</h1><p>Time flies.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, eighteen years had passed since Qin Sang secluded himself in Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Fortunately, the cultivation world remained relatively peaceful, allowing Qin Sang to cultivate steadily.  Except for occasional trips to the market town to collect resources from the commission guilds, he rarely left Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>One year into his seclusion, Qing Jun left, her whereabouts uncertain and elusive.</p><p>Over the next decade and a half, Qin Sang only saw her return once, and she departed just as quickly.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the other two sent messages annually, seeking his guidance. However, Qin Sang was worried about Yun Youzi, who remained completely out of contact.</p><p>Li Yu Fu mentioned that this was typical for Yun Youzi, which somewhat eased Qin Sang's concerns.</p><p>Eighteen years of dedicated cultivation, combined with Qin Sang's generous spending – the resources he brought back from the Cang Lang Sea were consumed at an astonishing rate – naturally led to rapid progress.</p><p>During these years, Qin Sang focused primarily on cultivating his main techniques.</p><p>The *Qingzhu Sword Scripture* was temporarily set aside; he didn't deliberately divert his attention to it.</p><p>With the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* mastered, and having successfully formed his golden core, comprehending sword intent and formations would come naturally.  It would be much easier to understand the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture* after that.</p><p>Furthermore, progress on the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* had stagnated.</p><p>After slightly refining the fire lotus seeds, Qin Sang's cultivation level became a limitation, preventing further advancement.  It, along with the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, was temporarily shelved.</p><p>The number of demonic banners he could control was related to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>The twelve demonic banner formation was even more powerful than the *Yilei Technique*, making it Qin Sang's strongest technique at present.</p><p>With the secret technique difficult to improve and his Soul Cleansing Liquid depleted, he could only seek other methods and find similar pills that could temporarily enhance his spiritual awareness.</p><p>After seclusion, Qin Sang quickly recovered his previous cultivation level.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to prioritize the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique, with the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* as a secondary focus, aiming to cultivate his physical body to its peak.</p><p>Even during his ten years of training in the demon sea, Qin Sang had not neglected his physical refinement.</p><p>Fortunately, through commissions with various guilds and forces, Qin Sang managed to acquire several spirit fruits mentioned in ancient demon texts. Although their efficacy was inferior to the Ba Xue Fruit, they still provided significant benefits.</p><p>These fruits were extremely expensive, and Qin Sang felt the pinch when he bought them.</p><p>Thanks to these fruits and years of diligent cultivation, Qin Sang's physical body grew increasingly stronger, with the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique nearing its third-stage perfection.</p><p>Of course, he didn't interrupt his cultivation of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, although progress was slower than with *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>The true killing talismans did not disappoint him.</p><p>After breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage, and with the sixth killing talisman successfully inscribed, Qin Sang's cultivation speed surpassed that of dual-spirit root geniuses.  If he had all seven talismans, he would be close to the top-tier single-spirit root geniuses.</p><p>This rapid cultivation speed, combined with the absence of small realm bottlenecks, allowed Qin Sang to cultivate both techniques simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang and his spirit insects both made breakthroughs.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, fed a constant supply of spirit medicine, had successfully entered the late third transformation stage.</p><p>This small realm breakthrough didn't outwardly change the Sky Eye Butterfly significantly. Only the celestial eyes on its wings appeared deeper and more agile, enhancing its power.</p><p>Its previous lightning-controlling ability, obtained through its transformation, remained underdeveloped.</p><p>Perhaps it would undergo further changes after its fourth transformation, but Qin Sang had almost exhausted his stock of Chi Huo Liu Jin and had no clue how to help the Sky Eye Butterfly undergo its fourth transformation.</p><p>Then there were the Fire Jade Centipede and the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>After consuming Chi Huo Liu Jin, the Fire Jade Centipede had not transformed, but it became more friendly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's condition was even worse.</p><p>Qin Sang initially assumed that the Fat Silkworm, like before, had fallen into a deep sleep due to exhaustion and would recover after some time.  Unexpectedly, after all this time, it remained asleep within Ya Gu, just like its master, showing no signs of awakening.</p><p>Its appearance showed no change.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure of their condition and dared not wake the Fat Silkworm, so he could only patiently wait for it to awaken on its own.</p><p>Under the starry night.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the star platform, drawing in stellar energy to refine his body.</p><p>The stellar煞 energy was blocked by the jade Buddha and expelled.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang revealed his transformed body, phoenix wings sprouting from his back.</p><p>Shrouded in stellar energy, Qin Sang's body was as radiant as a jewel, slightly transparent and emitting a soft glow.  His phoenix wings appeared more substantial, seamlessly integrated with his body.</p><p>To an outsider, it was difficult to imagine that these wings were actually a manifestation of a divine ability.</p><p>Drops of stellar energy seeped into Qin Sang's body, purging impurities from his flesh and strengthening his bones and muscles.</p><p>The cool, ethereal energy of the star essence, while refining his body, felt like tearing and pain to Qin Sang.  However, his body was far stronger than before, remaining unmoved.</p><p>He didn't know how long had passed.</p><p>The luminescence on Qin Sang suddenly dimmed, the star essence receding like a tide.  With a soft exhale, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, instinctively clenching his fist.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>A satisfied expression appeared on Qin Sang's face. "Cultivating both body and methods brings significant improvement each time… I should reach my peak within the next two years."</p><p>He put away his phoenix wings, stood up, and glanced at Bai's secluded dwelling.</p><p>Qing Jun returned to the valley once, during which Bai emerged to pay his respects.  Otherwise, Bai remained in his dwelling, never appearing. Qin Sang didn't know how his comprehension of the Corpse Soul Pearl was progressing.</p><p>"Eighteen years. Time flies. I've gathered some fragmented information from the market and various trading houses. The cultivation world is turbulent, far from stable.  The border situation is reportedly tense, and a large-scale war might erupt at any time. To get accurate information, I need to ask my senior sister.  Unfortunately, her whereabouts are uncertain…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these thoughts as he left the dwelling.</p><p>A crane's cry.</p><p>A white shadow flew before Qin Sang, revealing a magnificent immortal crane.  During his seclusion, Qin Sang had left the crane outside to tend the peach orchard. He didn't restrict the crane's cultivation. If it could independently break through to the late-stage Yaodan realm, he wouldn't mind setting it free.</p><p>However, the crane didn't seem as ambitious as the two-headed…  it didn't show a strong desire to break free from his control. Its only complaint was being confined to the valley and not allowed to go outside. It couldn't flirt with other birds or find a mate.</p><p>The crane landed before Qin Sang, rolling around and frantically scratching its head.</p><p>"This is a cultivator's territory. Aren't you afraid of being caught and roasted?"</p><p>Qin Sang scolded it, "Enough! Any news lately?"</p><p>The crane hung its head dejectedly, letting out a mournful cry. It shuffled back to its nest, gazing at the boundless sky with vacant eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang almost laughed.  He was about to return to his dwelling to continue cultivating when a fluctuation suddenly came from the valley's outer formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he quickly flew out of the Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>A person stood outside—Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Li Yu Fu bowed and said joyfully, "Master Uncle, the Grandmaster has returned!  Learning of your safe return, the Grandmaster is overjoyed.  He wanted to see you personally, but he needs to urgently enter seclusion and can't leave, so he sent me to invite you!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p>
