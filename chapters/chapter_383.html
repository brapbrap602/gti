<h1>Chapter 376:  The Killing</h1><p>Chapter 376:  The Killing</p><p>As Qin Sang’s voice rang out,</p><p>a howling wind swept across the land, instantly shrouding everything in a vast expanse of yellow sand.</p><p>Kong Xin and the black-robed man found their vision completely obscured.  Their spiritual senses, when extended, felt strangely sluggish, causing both their faces to fall.</p><p>However, they quickly realized the sand was only a distraction, lacking any real killing power. By maintaining their composure, they could withstand it.</p><p>“Watch out for their magic weapons!”</p><p>Kong Xin shouted a warning.</p><p>In the underground cavern, their original plan had been ruined by Qin Sang's ebony sword, but it wasn't entirely fruitless.</p><p>While fending off the ghostly creatures, everyone's magic weapons had been exposed, allowing them to capture the Bao cultivator so easily.</p><p>A typical Foundation Establishment cultivator usually possesses two or three top-grade magic weapons for protection, a sign of considerable wealth.</p><p>Kong Xin believed he had a good grasp of Qin Sang and Yun Youzi’s capabilities.  The ambush, being a two-on-two, didn't overly alarm him.</p><p>Within the sandstorm, everything was uncertain.</p><p>As the black-robed man moved to join Kong Xin, a sudden gust of wind attacked from his left, sending a jolt of alarm through him.</p><p>Recalling Kong Xin's description of their weapons, the black-robed man reacted instantly, summoning a pale bone staff from his sleeve, aiming it at the source of the wind.</p><p>The staff glowed brightly, then exploded with a loud crack, revealing its composition: a妖蟒 (yao mang - mythical serpent) spine.  The staff seemed to come alive, transforming into a white serpent.</p><p>Its triangular head opened wide, attempting to bite the incoming weapon.  Unexpectedly, it wasn't Black Dragon Stone or the Soul Binding Rope, but a cloud of black mist – the poisonous瘴气 (zhang qi – miasma) formed by the Sky Poison Shawl!</p><p>The miasma was formless.</p><p>The white serpent charged into it, passing right through, but instead of stopping its advance, the miasma spread even faster, instantly engulfing the black-robed man.</p><p>The black-robed man was momentarily stunned, then felt his consciousness wavering.  Panic surged. He tried to retrieve another weapon, but it was too late.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing sword cry cut through the air.  A sharp pain pierced the black-robed man's chest.  He snapped back to awareness, just in time to see a sword flash past like a shooting star.</p><p>Terror seized him.  He frantically reversed his bone staff.</p><p>Unfortunately, the staff was exhausted from its previous use, and his reactions were sluggish from the miasma's effects. This fraction of a second proved fatal.</p><p>Desperate, eyes bloodshot, the black-robed man spat out a mouthful of essence blood onto the staff.</p><p>Reinvigorated, the staff sped up, narrowly deflecting the sword's point.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed man screamed, clutching his right chest as he stumbled backward.</p><p>Though wounded, he felt a sliver of relief.  The sword, deflected by the staff, had missed his heart, piercing only his chest.  With some healing pills, the injury would mend.</p><p>But Qin Sang and Yun Youzi worked seamlessly, giving him no time to recover.</p><p>Before he could regain his footing, a shadow enveloped him.  He looked up in horror to see a mountain-sized dark shape crashing through the sand, plummeting towards him.</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone fell from the sky!</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The black-robed man cried out in terror, desperately using the staff to block the stone.</p><p>But the staff, already depleted from deflecting Yun Youzi's sword, was powerless against the Black Dragon Stone.  The serpentine form of the staff wailed, its body trembling as it shattered with a sickening crunch. The Black Dragon Stone, unstoppable, smashed into the black-robed man.</p><p>‘*Puff!*’</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone, incredibly heavy, crushed the already injured man.  His body, along with his robes, was practically pulverized, his life extinguished.</p><p>Only then did Kong Xin summon his own magic weapon for protection, pondering how to combine forces with the black-robed man against the two Taoists.</p><p>He and the black-robed man weren't close allies; their partnership was temporary, marked by mutual suspicion and a careful distance between them.</p><p>In fact, Kong Xin harbored a different plan.</p><p>Seeing the black-robed man ambushed, Kong Xin moved to help, but without full effort, intending to let the black-robed man test the waters.</p><p>The black-robed man, a notorious figure in the Wuyaya Valley, possessed skills far exceeding those of his peers. Even if he couldn't defeat the two Taoists, he could hold out for some time.</p><p>In the chaos, Kong Xin intended to seize an opportunity, assassinate one, and turn the tables in an instant.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the man in black proved to be a weak opponent, easily dispatched in a matter of seconds. From the initial ambush to his death, it took less than three breaths.</p><p>Alternatively, the two Taoist masters were far stronger than anticipated!</p><p>Kong Xin, terrified, immediately fled.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The clang of metal on metal echoed.</p><p>Kong Xin, gripping his blue-light sword, pointed it forward, his face grim.  He was blocked by a flying sword.</p><p>This sword belonged to Yun Youzi, who, after severely injuring the man in black, immediately targeted Kong Xin, preventing his escape.</p><p>The sword hung in mid-air, pointing at Kong Xin, and behind it, Yun Youzi slowly appeared.</p><p>Kong Xin said coldly, "I underestimated you two masters. How did you discover me?"</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "If you don't want others to know, don't do it."</p><p>"Master, don't waste time with him. A Tiger-Winged Eagle has already detected the commotion here. Kill him quickly and let's leave..." Qin Sang's voice drew closer, the word "leave" echoing just inches away.</p><p>Kong Xin's expression changed, his gaze sharp, scanning his surroundings. He saw Qin Sang emerge from the distance, unleashing the Soul-Binding Rope, forming a pincer attack with Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi, without further words, attacked with his sword.</p><p>Kong Xin's eyes flashed. He raised his blue-light sword to parry Yun Youzi's attack.  As the two swords were about to collide, he suddenly released the seal on his forehead. His power surged, and the blue-light sword blazed with dazzling light, aiming to overwhelm Yun Youzi and break free.</p><p>"So, you were hiding your strength, friend."</p><p>Yun Youzi laughed, showing no alarm.  An experienced cultivator, he wasn't fooled by Kong Xin's trick. With a flick of his hand, his sword unleashed a force matching the blue-light sword, meeting it head-on.</p><p>Although Yun Youzi's cultivation was inferior to Kong Xin's, he wouldn't be defeated quickly.</p><p>Seeing his blue-light sword entangled, the Soul-Binding Rope closing in, despair washed over Kong Xin.  Suddenly, a ferocious look appeared on his face.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>Kong Xin's meridians shattered, blood spraying as he transformed into a bloody figure, his aura exploding – his ultimate life-or-death technique.</p><p>However, before he could complete his secret art, the void behind him silently twisted, and a transparent sword shadow slowly materialized.</p><p>It pierced his skull.</p>
