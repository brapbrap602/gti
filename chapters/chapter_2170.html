<h1>Chapter 2160: A Promise</h1><p>Qin Sang saw four figures struggling amidst the radiant glow. Two of them were enveloped in a white light, their pristine white wings clearly visible even against the vibrant colors, radiating a holy aura, like celestial beings—members of the Feather People.</p><p>Among the Feather People, status depends not only on cultivation but also on wing color.</p><p>Those born with holy white wings are considered the closest to the gods. Their wings are called Holy Wings, while others have common wings.  The Feather People claim to be descendants of gods; therefore, those with Holy Wings hold the highest positions within their race.</p><p>Other wing colors signify mixed bloodlines.  Legend says that in ancient times, even below those with Holy Wings, there was further stratification based on wing color.  However, due to factors like cultivation level and family background, over the years, the distinctions have blurred. Except for those with Holy Wings, there is no longer a clear hierarchy.</p><p>This distinction isn't baseless.  It's said that the smallest group, those with Holy Wings, make up more than half of the top-tier powerhouses.</p><p>The lowest ranked are the Feather People's vassal tribes. These tribes mostly also have wings, some almost indistinguishable from the Feather People. Frequent intermarriage has led to a mix of bloodlines; some refer to both the Feather People and their vassal tribes as the Feather Tribe or Winged Tribe.</p><p>Two of the four figures are Holy Winged individuals; the other two are either common-winged Feather People or strong members of the vassal tribes.</p><p>Their figures bobbed in the radiant glow.  However, the Feather People and their vassal tribes are mostly born with innate flight abilities and possess unique skills in aerial movement.</p><p>Caught between the radiant glow and the mist river, they appeared flustered, yet they were skillfully using the forces around them; their lives were not in danger.</p><p>All four possessed extremely high cultivation levels. Qin Sang sensed that one was slightly weaker, comparable to him; the other three were likely top-tier experts in the late Void Refinement stage. No wonder they dared to snatch something from the tiger's mouth!</p><p>The sudden face-off, caused by the burst of radiant light, was unexpected.</p><p>In this struggle for opportunity, it was a fight to the death.  Even if both sides belonged to the Heavenly Department, they wouldn't hold back.</p><p>Si Huang's eyes burned with anger. The other side had spotted them, and their gaze was just as defiant. Before any real fighting started, Qin Sang already felt the tense atmosphere.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Two pale white flames shot out from Si Huang's back, powerful and resembling fire spears, aiming towards the opponents. At the same time, Si Huang charged forward, not retreating, but directly into the oncoming radiant light.</p><p>The outer ancient array had been broken by the Si You royal family and further weakened by the radiant glow; the path ahead was almost completely clear.</p><p>The Shao Shi, the Crown Prince, and others followed without hesitation.</p><p>Bound by the previous agreement, and with no immediate life-threatening situation, Qin Sang had no reason to back down; he could only follow, remaining vigilant.</p><p>In an instant, they passed through the fissure, effortlessly breaking through the third ancient array.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  With the explosion of light, the power within the mist river also changed, but whether this change was good or bad was unknown. There was no time to urge Si Huang to stop and observe.</p><p>"Those guardian beasts are gone."</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang heard Si Huang's voice through mental transmission, calm and not reflecting the anger he displayed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently. Si Huang was referring to the core of the secret realm, the source of the radiant light.  Originally, that area not only contained dangerous ancient arrays but also mysterious guardian beasts that attacked any intruders.</p><p>These beasts were incredibly powerful and inexhaustible. The Si You royal family had tried various methods, but they couldn't eliminate them.  Once within a certain range, the beasts would suddenly appear and launch a ferocious attack.</p><p>The guardian beasts were one of the biggest obstacles.  Breaking the arrays while simultaneously fending off the beasts was extremely difficult. Even Si Huang, who had discovered some patterns, wasn't entirely confident.</p><p>And yet, at this moment, the guardian beasts had vanished.</p><p>The Feather People experts had entered the range of the guardian beasts.  Had the beasts still been there, the opponents would have been even more hampered in those conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the radiant glow, searching for the guardian beasts, when he felt something strange. His gaze shifted to the front.</p><p>Faint wisps of a grayish-white substance appeared in the void.  At first, Qin Sang thought it was a result of the collision between the radiant light and the mist river, but he quickly realized something was wrong.</p><p>The gray-white substance was of unknown origin; it didn't come from the mist river, appearing as if out of thin air and gathering before him.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, his fingers pointing forward. He said in a low voice, "Could this be… a guardian beast?"</p><p>The gray-white substance changed rapidly, forming a mass before Qin Sang in an instant.</p><p>Not only Qin Sang, but also Si Huang and others found themselves confronted by similar grayish-white wisps.</p><p>These wisps then stretched and morphed, sprouting heads and limbs, transforming into grayish-white figures that emitted eerie laughter.</p><p>“These aren’t guardian beasts! Something’s wrong, everyone be careful!”</p><p>Si Huang said gravely.</p><p>Before his warning fully registered, these grayish-white figures continued to change.  Shockingly, they began to mimic those standing before them, eventually transforming into perfect copies of everyone present.</p><p>Their bodies, features, attire—even the circlet on the Si You clan's foreheads—were flawlessly replicated.  They blinked, smirked, and mimicked everyone's expressions with uncanny accuracy.</p><p>The only difference was their grayish-white hue, like faded versions of the originals.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>The grayish-white figures emitted cheerful laughter that sounded unnervingly strange to those present.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a faint breeze; his grayish-white counterpart suddenly lunged at him like a ghost.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively activated his Grey Warbler Sword, a beam of sword light piercing the figure's forehead.</p><p>The grayish-white figure stiffened, then split in two from its forehead, collapsing and melting back into the grayish-white mist, seeming about to dissipate into the surrounding energy.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was slightly surprised. The grayish-white figures were more fragile than he'd anticipated.</p><p>However, things weren't that simple.</p><p>The grayish-white mist reignited, instantly reforming into Qin Sang, mimicking his previous action with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p>A beam of sword light shot towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  If this sword light was a perfect imitation of his own, it captured the essence flawlessly, and its power was on par with his.  He'd dedicated years to the sword, and that strike, utilizing no specific technique, was perfectly natural. How had the grayish-white figure achieved this?</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>A thought struck him. Qin Sang once again activated his Grey Warbler Sword, executing a simple sword technique.</p><p>A sword shadow, light as a feather, gracefully met the incoming light, seemingly slow yet fast, suddenly splitting into two; one blocked the incoming light, while the other unexpectedly appeared before the grayish-white figure's chest and abdomen.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The grayish-white figure was severed at the waist, reforming before fully reverting to grayish-white mist.</p><p>Others experienced similar encounters. The Crown Prince was the most flustered; his initial attempt to crush the grayish-white figure with overwhelming force left him vulnerable to his own powers when the figure resurrected.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Imperial Tutor exchanged a glance, guessing the reason for the great beast's rampage and migration.</p><p>The grayish-white figures were likely a byproduct of the radiant light.</p><p>The radiant light not only destroyed its lair but also generated these strange grayish-white mists, creating an undefeatable enemy out of thin air.  The great beast, unaware of the concept of testing its opponent, attacked with its strongest abilities.  After a few exchanges, the grayish-white figures' strength would likely match its original.</p><p>No wonder the great beast's lair resembled a battlefield, yet only its aura remained.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang realized that the traces of battle disappeared after leaving the great beast's lair, proving the grayish-white figures weren't truly immortal.</p><p>Another possibility was that the grayish-white figures would dissipate automatically outside the range of the radiant light or after it faded.</p><p>The problem was, retreating now meant surrendering the treasure, and Si Huang wouldn't back down easily.</p><p>In a flash of thought, the grayish-white figure attacked again, flawlessly replicating Qin Sang's previous sword technique.  In Qin Sang's eyes, the strike was near perfect!</p><p>The grayish-white figure was like a diligent student with terrifying learning abilities, able to mimic even the powers of spiritual treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang changed tactics, using a sword technique designed to trap his opponents.  Sword light formed a cage, imprisoning the grayish-white figure.</p><p>Unfortunately, his plan failed. The grayish-white figure simply dispersed into mist within the cage, reforming outside and even using the same technique against Qin Sang.  Clearly, the grayish-white figures had never truly died.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily at a loss. To prevent the grayish-white figures from growing too strong, the best course of action was to stall them, but that assumed no external interference.</p><p>If they faced danger and had to fight at full strength, they’d confront a powerful, invulnerable version of themselves! Furthermore, their understanding of the grayish-white figures was still superficial; they didn't know if they possessed other powers.</p><p>Qin Sang was thankful he hadn’t used his thunder escape or Great Vajra Wheel Seal, as that would have been even more troublesome.  The Imperial Tutor and others, having used their abilities and treasures to counter the Mist River’s power, had inadvertently trained their copies, making them versatile and increasingly formidable foes.</p><p>"My lord, what should we do now?"  Anlingfei, her heart pounding, asked anxiously.</p><p>With the radiant glow ahead and the mist river behind, and beset by the grayish-white figures, they had no chance to claim the treasure.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the Grand Tutor also shared their deductions.</p><p>The Emperor, surveying their opponents, saw that they too were entangled by the grayish-white figures. He declared decisively, "Let's wait and see!"</p><p>Just as they were preparing to stay put and carefully maneuver around the grayish-white figures, a new event unfolded.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>"Crash!"</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>The radiant glow seemed to have angered the mist river.  Two powerful forces clashed, creating monstrous waves whose force swept through the area. Four expert Avian warriors, unable to withstand the impact, were forced to retreat from the core of the sanctuary to avoid the brunt of it.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others could no longer wait for their chance.  As the shockwave hit, those with the weakest cultivation felt the pressure first.</p><p>A strange sight unfolded. The opponents were retreating, and so were they; both sides were carefully avoiding engagement.</p><p>The difference in strength was now clear.  The Avian warrior with the lowest cultivation was gradually falling behind.</p><p>On Qin Sang's side, the Emperor and the Grand Tutor possessed the strongest cultivation.</p><p>Anlingfei and the Crown Prince had similar cultivation levels and were retreating the fastest and furthest, followed by the Court Attendant.  Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to the Court Attendant's, but his strength was comparable to a late Nascent Soul cultivator. If he unleashed his full power, he could stand alongside the Emperor and the Grand Tutor.</p><p>However, he wouldn't do so. He maintained a pace similar to the Court Attendant's, focusing entirely on dealing with the grayish-white figures.</p><p>He devised a strategy and summoned the Mingshan Armor.</p><p>As expected, identical armor appeared on the grayish-white figures, making them increasingly difficult to kill. Qin Sang didn't mind; he only defended, not attacked, carefully avoiding "teaching" them any new offensive techniques.</p><p>The radiant glow pulsed deeply, resounding with continuous booms, indicating significant destruction.</p><p>Streams of light gushed from the radiant glow, interspersed with rubble. It was clear that the sanctuary was in ruins.</p><p>At that moment, the Emperor's expression suddenly changed.</p><p>A white pillar of light shot out from the heart of the radiant glow.  The white light was clearly not part of the radiant glow, and the moment it appeared, the surrounding chaos seemed to momentarily cease.</p><p>At that instant, everyone saw a large formation below the white light; white rainbows crisscrossed, protecting what lay beneath them: ancient, elegant pavilions.</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p>Several white rainbows shattered in violent collisions, but the formation remained firm.</p><p>Everyone sensed that the power of the rainbow formation wasn't just from the sanctuary's core.  The outer formations, previously broken by the Siyou Imperial Clan and ravaged by the radiant glow, now displayed renewed power; there were clearly secrets the Siyou Imperial Clan had yet to unravel.</p><p>The formation revealed its true power, but the white rainbows continued to peel away, gradually diminishing the formation's strength.</p><p>The Emperor stared intently at one ancient pavilion at the center of the complex, a structure that stood apart, its surface shimmering with a dark light, protected by ancient seals.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren!"</p><p>Qin Sang heard the Emperor's mental transmission.</p><p>"If, as you and the Grand Tutor have surmised, the grayish-white figures disappear when the radiant glow dissipates, I implore you to help us break into that pavilion!"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Everyone could see the inherent danger.</p><p>The Avian warriors had obviously set their sights on the pavilion as well.  If he made a move, he would undoubtedly be attacked, and it was unclear what other changes might occur in the radiant glow and the sanctuary.</p><p>When they swore their oath, Qin Sang had been wary of the Emperor pushing him to his death.  In this situation, he could choose to stand by and watch.</p><p>"The Avian warriors are unaware of the pattern of the grayish-white figures' disappearance.  If they hesitate even for a moment, that will be our chance!  The Emperor and the Grand Tutor will do our best to hold them off, giving you time. They don't know your true strength and won't be overly cautious. You just need to quickly approach, aim at the pavilion and fire the [redacted] Pearl, then retreat immediately. Then, I will personally claim the treasure. They will focus on stopping me, not you. Of course, if the situation allows, I hope you can share some of the burden."</p><p>In an instant, the Emperor had assessed the situation's advantages and disadvantages. The only problem was persuading Qin Sang.</p><p>Before entering, the Emperor hadn't anticipated this situation and could only offer a hasty promise of reward.</p><p>"[Redacted] Pearl was obtained from a sanctuary, and there were several other treasures nearby. They might contain secrets related to the [redacted] Pearl; you're skilled in thunder techniques, so they might be useful to you. Whether we succeed or not, I will gift them to you."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, but he remained unmoved. He asked, "What exactly is inside that pavilion?"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'll be spending tomorrow with my family for the holiday and will be taking a break.  I'll resume updates the day after.  Happy holidays everyone!</p>
