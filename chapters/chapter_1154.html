<h1>Chapter 1146: Heavenly Tribulation</h1><p>Of course, it was clear to see that Qin Sang's fate still hung in the balance. Although Qin Sang was fast, he wasn't fast enough to easily shake off the pursuit of the Demon King Qianji. There was a vast difference in their cultivation realms. Unless something unexpected happened, the outcome would inevitably be Qin Sang exhausting his true essence and being captured alive by the Demon King Qianji.</p><p>"This guy actually let me go. He doesn't seem like a cruel and bloodthirsty person. The phantom of the Azure Phoenix actually stirred something in my bloodline. If I miss this opportunity, I might never get another chance..."</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, the falcon demon couldn't resist the temptation and, after circling around, quietly followed them.</p><p>In the night, two streaks of light flew out of the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss, one after the other. They were Qin Sang and the Demon King Qianji. The other lesser demons had already been left far behind.</p><p>However, just as the second streak of light appeared, thick white mist suddenly surged around the canyon, instantly sealing off the surrounding space and forming a massive illusionary array that trapped the Demon King Qianji inside.</p><p>The Demon King Qianji was not unprepared. His light streak came to an abrupt halt, and a strange radiance burst from his body, dispersing the white mist. But in an instant, the mist closed in again.</p><p>"An illusionary array?"</p><p>The Demon King Qianji was inwardly furious. This illusionary array was something even he couldn't see through immediately, indicating that the person controlling the array was likely no weaker than that thief from earlier. Such anomalies were rarer than Nascent Soul cultivators, and yet two had appeared at once.</p><p>Outside the illusionary array, Qin Sang's figure swayed and he fell from mid-air, teetering on the edge of collapse. Fortunately, Bai arrived just in time to catch him. Upon sensing the abnormality within Qin Sang's body, Bai asked with a look of astonishment, "What did you do in there?"</p><p>When they had entered, everything had been normal. But now, the power within Qin Sang's body was unusually violent, carrying an extraordinary aura that even made Bai tremble.</p><p>"It's a long story!" Qin Sang forced a bitter smile. "I need to focus all my energy on breaking through. Once I reach the fourth layer of my cultivation technique, I won't fear the demon king. Please, Brother Bai, take me away from here first."</p><p>The white crane assisted Bai in setting up the array, and they quickly entered the Chaos Unity Ring. Knowing the urgency of the situation, Bai didn't press further. He nodded and, carrying Qin Sang, fled in a chosen direction without looking back.</p><p>This was only the first layer of their safety net. The fluctuations of the illusionary array were extremely subtle, even deceiving the senses of a transformed great demon. However, this also meant its power was limited. If they couldn't shake off the Demon King Qianji, the spirit of the willow tree and the old macaque, along with other great demons from the Thousand Bamboo Sea, had already mobilized. They had set up a grand array in a hidden location as a last resort.</p><p>They wouldn't use it unless absolutely necessary, to avoid exposing themselves. Bai, having absorbed the power of the Corpse Soul Pearl, had greatly increased his strength. His speed was also incredibly fast, and his corpse energy transformed into a black streak of light that streaked across the night sky.</p><p>Qin Sang focused entirely on his cultivation, his mind free of distractions. The outcome was still uncertain. The power that had entered his body was like a festering wound, impossible to expel. If he could seize this opportunity to break through, both he and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly would gain immense benefits. But if he failed, he might be torn apart by the power of the Azure Phoenix, and all his cultivation would be destroyed.</p><p>The brief chase earlier had nearly doomed him. Qin Sang looked inward and saw that the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was still continuously absorbing the power of the Azure Phoenix. The emotions it conveyed were also filled with obvious pain. However, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was not lacking in intelligence. It understood that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, like Qin Sang, was incredibly resilient. No matter how much it hurt, it persisted unwaveringly.</p><p>As it absorbed this power, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's wings began to mutate into a cyan color, and the patterns on its wings shimmered with silver light, filled with flashes of lightning. The cyan light around it grew increasingly dense, gradually forming a cocoon.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt both joy and worry. Whether it was a metamorphosis or a mutation, it wouldn't be a bad thing for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. But once the Heavenly Eye Butterfly fell into a deep sleep, there would be no one to help him bear the impact. He had to break through before that happened!</p><p>"Celestial Demon Manifestation..."</p><p>Qin Sang banished all distracting thoughts, and the entirety of his cultivation technique flashed through his mind. He was anxious but not chaotic. Having seen the true Azure Phoenix and personally felt its aura, Qin Sang now understood where he had gone wrong in his previous visualization of the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>He began by correcting this step. Then, starting from the first layer, he moved to the second and third layers. It was only then that he realized there had been many oversights and even mistakes in his previous cultivation process. It was only because of his low cultivation level that he had been able to forcefully advance with the help of star energy infusion.</p><p>Now, after reorganizing and correcting his mistakes, his cultivation technique underwent a qualitative transformation, and Qin Sang's physical body actually grew stronger.</p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p>Qin Sang was enlightened, filled with joy. Unbeknownst to him, Bai outside was nearly frantic with worry.</p><p>As expected, the illusionary array couldn't hold the demon king for long. Once the array was broken, the demon king gave chase again. Bai kept glancing at Qin Sang, but there was still no sign of a breakthrough. In the end, he had no choice but to rush toward the ambush site.</p><p>"Brother Bai! Put me down!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly spoke. Bai was slightly startled. He glanced at the demon king chasing from the horizon and, in the end, chose to trust Qin Sang. His figure flickered, and they landed on a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, his eyes closed. As he finished reorganizing the final step of his cultivation technique, the first three layers were fully corrected. Like water flowing naturally, Qin Sang immediately sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough!</p><p>He had first undergone star energy infusion and then fused with the power of the Azure Phoenix. He had long been teetering on the edge of a breakthrough. It was no surprise that it came so easily now.</p><p>"Celestial Demon Manifestation!"</p><p>In Qin Sang's mind, the image of the Azure Phoenix traversing the thunderclouds appeared. Every movement of the Azure Phoenix, its divine aura, was deeply imprinted in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>In the void, wind and clouds suddenly rose! Qin Sang's body shone with a dazzling cyan light, exceptionally bright in the night, illuminating the entire mountain. Suddenly, this cyan light madly converged toward the center of the wind and clouds.</p><p>A moment later, a phantom of the Azure Phoenix was born out of thin air, holding its head high, facing the stars and moon, exuding an extraordinary divine aura. This was a true divine beast!</p><p>The Celestial Demon Manifestation had taken form! The manifestation was still more illusory than the phantom on the stone slab. Qin Sang would need to refine it further to gradually solidify it. But for now, it was enough!</p><p>The moment he comprehended the manifestation, Qin Sang's bones emitted a series of cracking sounds, and he finally broke through that barrier, advancing to the fourth layer! His physical body underwent a metamorphosis, expelling impurities.</p><p>Qin Sang's aura surged, and his wings instantly stabilized. He took control, voraciously absorbing the power of the Azure Phoenix, which gradually turned into a solid form.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai seemed to ponder something. In the distance, the pursuing Demon King Qianji's expression changed slightly. He frowned and stared intently. The aura emanating from the thief actually made him feel threatened.</p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed wildly at the sky, sweeping away the depression in his chest.</p><p>"Boom..."</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous roar shook the heavens and earth, cutting off Qin Sang's laughter.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up in shock and horror, only to find dark clouds gathering above, filled with lightning and thunder. This wasn't ordinary lightningâ€”it was a heavenly tribulation!</p><p>"I only strengthened my physical body. Why would I face a tribulation? And it's a thunder tribulation at that!"</p><p>Qin Sang's joy turned to sorrow. He wasn't prepared to face a tribulation now. Then, he noticed something was off. The thunder tribulation didn't seem to be targeting him.</p><p>After forming a light cocoon, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was still absorbing the power of the Azure Phoenix. Suddenly, it flew out of Qin Sang's body, and a crack appeared on the cocoon!</p>
