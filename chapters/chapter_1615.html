<h1>Chapter 1606: People</h1><p>Qingjun and Bai had actually ascended to the Demon Realm!</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered the agreement made beneath the Ascension Platform.</p><p>If he were fortunate enough to ascend in the future, they would still be separated by two realms. When would they be reunited?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was somewhat somber. "In ancient times, what exactly happened?"</p><p>"I don't know! Not only was my cultivation base sealed, but my memories were also either sealed or erased. What I remember are all these insignificant things. I don't even know how much of these memories are real and how much are false, nor do I know who sealed or erased my memories. Only by returning can I ascertain my origins!"</p><p>Ghost Mother's tone was desolate.</p><p>The memories Ghost Mother considered insignificant were treasures to Qin Sang.</p><p>She and Bai were similar, but different.</p><p>Bai was defeated on the battlefield, desperately sealed by an Ancient Demon. Her soul survived, but her memories faded over endless years, potentially recoverable only upon encountering familiar scenes.</p><p>Ghost Mother's origins seemed even more peculiar, shrouded in many secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang could understand Ghost Mother's feelings.</p><p>When he first arrived in this world, he also felt like rootless duckweed. However, he was a mortal then, immersed in the joy of returning from death, only sentimental when he thought of his family.</p><p>Ghost Mother had a way to return, but he didn't even know where his home was.</p><p>Could it be some unknown Minor Thousand World?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts drifted, but he had no desire to search for his homeland or return to his roots. His parents and relatives had long since passed away, what was the point of going back?</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's wandering thoughts, Ghost Mother continued to explain, "I learned about the Demon Lord's Altar being able to ascend to the Demon Realm from the Ancient Demon sealed beneath the Pure Sea Sect. He was also a pitiful creature, just like me, muddle-headed and unaware of his origins, attempting to devour my soul to survive."</p><p>Speaking of the Ancient Demon, Ghost Mother laughed gloatingly. "However, that devil's luck was even worse. He had no chance to verify if his cultivation was sealed. After sleeping for many years, he just happened to wake up and encounter Xiao Xiangzi!"</p><p>"Indeed! Senior Xiao Xiangzi personally suppressed the Ancient Demon and left behind many precautionary measures, ultimately using the Pure Sea Sect's power to slay the Ancient Demon. Otherwise, if the Ancient Demon had escaped, the North Sea would have faced another demonic tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Xiao Xiangzi's arrangements in the Profound Sky Palace and its sacred grounds, briefly mentioning some of them.</p><p>Ghost Mother wasn't surprised at all, smiling faintly. "Xiao Xiangzi was scared witless by the Central Continent's Ancient Demon! Little did he know, although these two Ancient Demons were both wicked, they probably weren't of the same ilk. After breaking free, the Pure Sea Sect's Ancient Demon wouldn't linger in this realm for long, definitely trying every possible way to find the Demon Lord's Altar and return to the Demon Realm."</p><p>An Ancient Demon had once wreaked havoc in the Central Continent.</p><p>Qin Sang had this speculation after discovering the Demon Binding Rope fragment, but clues were very scarce.</p><p>Of course, this was also related to him focusing his energy on cultivation. He only laid some groundwork and hadn't started a thorough investigation, while Ghost Mother,一心focused on returning, devoted all her efforts to investigating these matters.</p><p>"In Xiao Xiangzi's era, demons ravaged the Central Continent, causing a catastrophe. But an invisible hand in the cultivation world has been deliberately erasing history, making it little known in the present day."</p><p>Ghost Mother had indeed uncovered many secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred upon hearing this. Those capable of erasing history were probably only the Eight Sceneries Landscape and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery acting together, perhaps even involving top sects like the Heavenly Firmament Tower, the foremost sect of the Demonic Path.</p><p>He couldn't help but think of another existence almost erased from history—the Formless Immortal Sect!</p><p>What connection existed between the demonic chaos and the Formless Immortal Sect?</p><p>Ghost Mother nodded. "It seems you've also discovered some things. The demonic chaos can be said to have been caused by the Formless Immortal Sect. They inadvertently released an Ancient Demon, causing the Southern Border's living beings to suffer immensely. Back then, the most prosperous place in the Central Continent was not the Central Plains, but the current Southern Barbarian Two States. That demonic chaos not only led to the Formless Immortal Sect's destruction but also completely ravaged the Southern Border, turning it into a desolate wasteland with few inhabitants and pervasive miasma!"</p><p>'Hiss...'</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>The terrifying power of Ancient Demons was something he had experienced multiple times.</p><p>But to be able to ravage the vast Southern Barbarian Two States to the point of no recovery, what a terrifying battle it must have been, definitely beyond the capabilities of Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>"A Nascent Soul Transformation battle?"</p><p>Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>Ghost Mother said calmly, "It wasn't just a Nascent Soul Transformation battle. The Witch Clan's Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator fell during that demonic chaos. As far as I know, the Formless Immortal Sect was the undisputed overlord of the Central Continent at the time, far more powerful than the current Eight Sceneries Landscape and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, with numerous Nascent Soul Transformation cultivators within the sect. After the demonic chaos, the entire sect was destroyed. I'm afraid all their Nascent Soul Transformation cultivators perished alongside the Ancient Demon! Otherwise, even if they couldn't rise again, their legacy wouldn't have been completely severed."</p><p>"Could it be that they were taken advantage of after the demonic chaos?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Water Phase Master's dying words in the tomb, every word filled with hatred for the Eight Sceneries Landscape and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>It was just unknown whether this person was a Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator or a descendant who inherited the position after all the Nascent Soul Transformation cultivators had fallen.</p><p>Ghost Mother glanced towards Rainbow City; experts from both sects were there at the moment.</p><p>"The Formless Immortal Sect exhausted the entire sect's strength to contain the demonic chaos within the Southern Border, preventing the entire Central Plains from suffering the demonic tribulation, fulfilling their responsibility. The cultivation world is full of schemes and betrayals. During the Formless Immortal Sect's weakest moment, being taken advantage of wasn't uncommon. As for whether it was truly the work of the Daoist and Buddhist sects, how many participants rose by stepping on the Formless Immortal Sect's corpses, it's impossible to verify now. But one thing is certain, it wasn't a glorious act, and those who concealed history were definitely connected to the perpetrators."</p><p>Such was the fate of the vanquished.</p><p>If Senior Xiao Xiangzi was a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, the sect's destruction and being regarded as a thorn in the side of the Central Continent, forcing him to flee to the North Sea, would make sense.</p><p>He was ultimately a broad-minded individual. Upon discovering traces of the Ancient Demon in the North Sea, he didn't forget the common people and set a trap to suppress the Ancient Demon.</p><p>But why did his letter not mention the Formless Immortal Sect at all? Was it due to despair?</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect was destroyed, and the Witch Clan's Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator perished as a result.</p><p>The Central Continent's Ancient Demon was definitely not of the Jade Bone Devil's caliber.</p><p>It was probably only the Seven Killing Palace's Demon Monarch himself breaking free that could achieve such a feat.</p><p>Ghost Mother also said earlier that the Pure Sea Sect's Ancient Demon and the Central Continent's Ancient Demon weren't of the same kind.</p><p>Could it be that Ancient Demons also had factions? The Pure Sea Sect's Ancient Demon and the Jade Bone Devil were one faction, the Central Continent's Ancient Demon and the Seven Killing Palace's Demon Monarch another, or perhaps even more, each with different origins?</p><p>"Where was the Central Continent's Ancient Demon released from? After the demonic chaos, was it sealed again, or was it slain?" Qin Sang had encountered three Ancient Demons.</p><p>Only the Jade Bone Devil was bound by the Demon Binding Rope and thrown into the spatial turbulence to be destroyed.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi, personally taking action, could only seal the Pure Sea Sect's Ancient Demon, who died by having its true nature extinguished. The Demon Monarch was likely still sealed within the Seven Killing Palace, showing how difficult it was to kill an Ancient Demon.</p><p>Ghost Mother said, "Whether the Ancient Demon lived or died isn't important. Ultimately, the Formless Immortal Sect must have won. The Ancient Demon's origin is not simple. I only confirmed it recently. It's in the Southern Sea Immortal Palace."</p><p>"Southern Sea Immortal Palace?"</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The Southern Sea Immortal Palace was already a suspect. In the Gu God Cult's doctrines, it was described as the Vacuum Immortal Land. He planned to have his Avatar contact the Gu God Cult, but it was delayed due to his Avatar's breakthrough.</p><p>The Central Continent's Ancient Demon originated from the Southern Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace suppressed the Demon Monarch.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace, the Celestial Aspect Palace, and the Celestial Harmony Palace all had Killing Sword fragments.</p><p>The Southern Sea Immortal Palace was very likely these two Immortal Palaces!</p><p>"The Witch Clan's Nascent Soul Transformation cultivator fell in the Southern Sea Immortal Palace back then. If you agree to let me take her away, I will guide you on how to enter the Southern Sea Immortal Palace and how to find his remains. All of his belongings will be yours!" Ghost Mother brought up the matter of Ya Gu again.</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the matter of the Immortal Palaces.</p><p>Were all these Immortal Palaces places of demon sealing?</p><p>"Senior, do you not know the origins of these Immortal Palaces? The Purple Star Palace, the Southern Sea Immortal Palace..."</p><p>Ghost Mother shook her head. "I know nothing about these Immortal Palaces. I even suspect that the Immortal Palaces are not from our era. Otherwise, the disparity between Ancient Demons is too great. As for whether they are from earlier or later than us, it's unknown. This is the most peculiar aspect of this realm. The ceaseless storms, the eternal barrier, there are too many things that defy common sense."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a headache. The more he knew, the more he felt his ignorance and insignificance.</p><p>Did this realm experience multiple heavenly changes to become so fragmented?</p><p>Ghost Mother's words seemed absurd, but Qin Sang could find supporting evidence.</p><p>The Purple Star Palace was divided into inner and outer sections, with vastly different scenes separated by an immortal restriction.</p><p>During ascension, only the inner palace's immortal restriction transformed, restoring its grand, ancient appearance and immortal scenery. Qin Sang still vividly remembered the transformed inner palace.</p><p>The inner palace's immortal restriction recovered, but the outer palace remained unchanged, ultimately destroyed after the inner palace ascended, along with the Abyss and the Blood Lake.</p><p>The Ascension Platform was located in the outer palace and didn't transform with the Purple Star Palace's ascension. It was opened artificially.</p><p>Could it be speculated that:</p><p>The Jade Bone Devil, Ghost Mother, the Pure Sea Sect's Ancient Demon, the Ascension Platform, the Abyss, the Blood Lake, and the Purple Star Palace's outer section arrived first, having no relation to the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>Then, the true Purple Star Palace descended from the heavens, coincidentally landing near the outer section.</p><p>Later generations, unaware of the truth, mistakenly believed them to be one entity.</p><p>The Seven Killing Palace and other Immortal Palaces were clearly related to the Purple Star Palace, arriving together.</p><p>Because of this, the Ancient Demons within the Immortal Palaces were far more powerful than the Jade Bone Devil. They weren't of the same kind at all!</p><p>From his initial entry into the Purple Star Palace, Qin Sang pieced together his experiences and discoveries, finally finding a relatively reasonable explanation.</p><p>Seeing him lost in thought, Ghost Mother assumed Qin Sang found the price insufficient. Her gaze swept over him, and she said, "What kind of spirit insects do you cultivate?"</p><p>Qin Sang snapped out of his thoughts, remembering that before him was a great master of insect control.</p><p>Throughout the Central Continent, no one could match her in the art of insect control.</p><p>Seeking guidance from Ghost Mother on insect control techniques was part of Qin Sang's plan. Unexpectedly, Ghost Mother had revealed one shocking piece of information after another, almost making him forget about it.</p><p>He patted his spirit beast pouch and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>"A Treasure Hunting Centipede, early Fourth Transformation, not bad."</p><p>Ghost Mother recognized the Fire Jade Centipede at a glance, giving a calm evaluation.</p><p>"Does this insect only have treasure hunting abilities?"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to know if it had any other potential, preferably gaining some combat prowess.</p><p>The spirit insect's path was unwavering, how could it be guided?</p><p>Ghost Mother pondered for a moment, then said, "The Fire Jade Centipede's potential can support it to the peak of the Fourth Transformation. If it can luckily break through to the Fifth Transformation, that would be its limit. This is destiny, difficult to change unless it obtains an opportunity for transformation."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The path of spirit insects was far more arduous than that of humans.</p><p>Ghost Mother smiled. "Don't pity the spirit insect. Although spirit insects have low intelligence and singular abilities, they don't have to worry about the Four Nine Heavenly Tribulation, only the Transformation Tribulation. And high-rank spirit insects have long lifespans and excellent life-saving abilities. The Heavenly Dao has its own set rules!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. No wonder neither Witch Clan nor human records mentioned spirit insects undergoing tribulations. He thought the intervals between their heavenly tribulations were long, but it turned out they were tribulation-free!</p><p>Ghost Mother pointed at Qin Sang's dantian. "I'm not talking about this centipede, but your natal insect gu. You have the aura of a natal insect gu on you, which can't escape my eyes. Natal insect gus are not unique to my clan; other races also have legacies. Although there are differences, many draw inspiration from my clan. I can still offer you some guidance."</p><p>It turned out she had already sensed the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's aura.</p><p>Since things had come to this, there was nothing to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang called upon the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The illusory butterfly shadow flew out of Qin Sang's dantian, gradually solidifying. Gently flapping its wings, it landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, nuzzling his cheek affectionately.</p><p>Facing Ghost Mother, the Fat Silkworm and the Fire Jade Centipede's behavior was quite pathetic. Only the Heavenly Eye Butterfly remained unaffected, perhaps because Qin Sang had its back.</p><p>Staring at the Heavenly Eye Butterfly for a while, Ghost Mother exclaimed softly, "This is a Heavenly Eye Butterfly? Has it undergone transformation?"</p><p>After transforming, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's appearance changed greatly, but the characteristic Heavenly Eyes remained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, offering no explanation, much less letting the Heavenly Eye Butterfly display its ability to control tribulation lightning before Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother was tactful and didn't press further. Immediately afterward, she discovered another surprising fact. "You are cultivating my clan's secret technique?"</p><p>"This junior only knows the part before Nascent Soul. After Nascent Soul, every step is arduous. I obtained Senior's Spirit Ascension Ritual in the Hundred Flowers Valley, which helped her advance a level," Qin Sang explained truthfully.</p><p>Ghost Mother stared at Qin Sang, marveling, "Human insect control techniques are mostly derived from my clan, but there are bound to be omissions, making it almost impossible to cultivate our complete secret techniques. Do you have some special physique? Could it be that you also have my clan's bloodline?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to explain. "This junior accidentally stumbled into Witch Clan territory back then and muddled through cultivation to this point. I don't feel anything special about myself."</p><p>"Different bodies within the same clan, there are those within the Witch Clan who aren't suited for cultivating natal insect gus. It's normal for someone like you, particularly compatible, to appear among humans," Ghost Mother warned Qin Sang. "You're not of my clan's bloodline. The higher your realm, the greater the hidden danger. If you rely on some external force, there will always be a limit. You must be cautious, beware of insect gu backlash."</p><p>"Thank you for your reminder, Senior," Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, thinking inwardly, I truly don't know what the Jade Buddha's limit is.</p><p>Ghost Mother paced back and forth, considered for a moment, and then said, "I can teach you the subsequent natal insect gu techniques, and they are definitely not ordinary Witch Clan secret techniques. Also, in my memory, I have personally seen a Seventh Transformation Heavenly Eye Butterfly, called the Void Butterfly, seemingly having some connection to me. After returning, I will devote my efforts to collecting Heavenly Eye Butterfly cultivation methods for you. Even if it has undergone transformation, there will definitely be valuable insights. If you can't advance to Nascent Soul Transformation and are trapped in this realm, then it's all for naught. If you can ascend, come find us in the Witch Clan territory. I can't give you an exact location, but I will always operate under the name 'Ghost Mother'."</p><p>A Seventh Transformation Void Butterfly, equivalent to the Body Integration Realm!</p><p>Ghost Mother didn't believe Qin Sang wouldn't be tempted.</p><p>But...</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly and looked at Ya Gu. "Senior, you might have misunderstood something. She is a living person, an independent being, not my possession."</p>
