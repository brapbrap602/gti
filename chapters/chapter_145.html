<h1>**Chapter One Hundred and Thirty-eight: Thunder Wood**</h1><p>After saying farewell to Fellow Disciple Gong, Qin Sang arrived at the Spirit Beast Hall, which housed many tamed demons with their own unique uses. They were also excellent tools for cultivators, and could easily solve many problems. </p><p>As soon as Qin Sang landed, a Qi Condensation Disciple greeted him, "Disciple greets Uncle-Master!" </p><p>Qin Sang nodded, handed him his waist token, and explained his purpose. </p><p>The disciple returned the waist token and asked, "May I ask where Uncle-Master Qin wants to open a cave府? On land, or in the vast expanse of Yun Cang?" </p><p>Qin Sang understood that different demons were adapted to different environments, and so he said, "In the vast expanse of Yun Cang." </p><p>The disciple nodded and said, "If it is the vast expanse of Yun Cang, the best options are the Ling Bird and the Golden Eye Viper, who are both highly sensitive to changes in spirit energy. Of the two, the Golden Eye Viper is the most effective at finding water spiritual veins. However, the Golden Eye Viper needs to dive to the bottom of the water, but it is not proficient in water evasion techniques, and its strength is only slightly stronger than an ordinary beast, so it may encounter unpredictable dangers. When it goes into the water, Uncle-Master, I ask that you provide additional protection." </p><p>Taming a demon required a significant investment of time and resources. Each spirit beast was extremely valuable. Naturally, Qin Sang agreed readily, and then followed the disciple as they flew away from the Treasure Pagoda Peak and arrived at the mountain where the spirit beasts were kept. He took one Ling Bird and one Golden Eye Viper. </p><p>Although the jade box had a seal that suppressed its spirit energy, it had been several years since the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid had been plucked, and the orchid was already showing signs of wilting. </p><p>If it was going to be replanted, it had to absorb enough spirit energy to regain its vitality. </p><p>This process was very slow, and it would take at least a year in the spirit spring, although even the best spirit springs would not suffice; they could only slow down its deterioration. </p><p>Once its vitality was gone, it would be impossible to save, and the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid would not have enough medicinal properties to craft the Du'e Pill. That would be a great pity. </p><p>Although the White Cat's cave府 was secluded enough, with the White Cat and the Bamboo Demon knowing about it, Qin Sang was not comfortable leaving the Nine Illusions Heavenly Orchid there by itself. Unfortunately, the spirit spring had not taken shape, and could not be moved. </p><p>Qin Sang planned to first borrow the two spirit beasts to look for a cave府. If he could find another spirit spring, all the better. If not, he would have to temporarily plant it in the White Cat's cave府. </p><p>He took the spirit beasts and slowly flew towards the Jianmen Pass, recalling his plans along the way, and could not find any omissions. </p><p>When he returned to the cave府, Qin Sang immediately prepared to enter isolation and cultivate diligently. The《 Spirit Nurturing Sword Manual》was extremely difficult to cultivate, and would not be mastered in a year or two. It could be a very long time before he had any free time. </p><p>He had left the address of Gu Tiannan's Huilong Temple with the Sect Master Yu, and would only need to go there when he had time to check for important matters. </p><p>When he passed by the Jianmen Pass, Qin Sang saw the rows of peach trees on the mountain and sighed to himself, not knowing what the future held for him. Would he be able to follow in the footsteps of the Green Bamboo Immortal? </p><p>After flying out of the Jianmen Pass, Qin Sang activated the Flying Shuttle and arrived at the Wen Yue Marketplace. In order to avoid trouble, he used the Concealing Spirit Art to hide his cultivation level and found that tool-forging store from before. </p><p>The shop owner recognized Qin Sang immediately and enthusiastically offered him tea. "Fellow Daoist Qin, please come in quickly." </p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of tea and glanced at the Li Residence opposite. Song Ying was willing to give up her ancestral residence, so he would not interfere. His purpose in coming this time was to ask the shop owner to repair the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword. </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Wu, can you see if this sword can be repaired?" </p><p>Qin Sang took out Gu Tiannan's Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword. During the fight, one of them had been damaged by the ebony sword, causing the blade to be covered in cracks and unusable. </p><p>The greatest difficulty in the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword spell was gathering five usable Five Elements spirit swords. As long as the spirit swords were in hand, cultivating the spell would only take some time. </p><p>Qin Sang was thinking about cultivating several spells as means to counter his enemies after entering the Foundation Establishment stage. He happened to have these five swords, so when he chose the《 Spirit Nurturing Sword Manual》, he also bought the《 Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword》 jade slip. </p><p>Even if he could not repair it, it would not be difficult to find another one. </p><p>When Qin Sang used his divine sense to search the mustard seed bag and take out the spirit sword, he suddenly paused and his expression flickered, before returning to normal as he handed the spirit sword to the shop owner. </p><p>The shop owner took it and only glanced at it once before smiling and saying, "It turns out to be the《 Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword》. Its quality is quite good. It seems Fellow Daoist Qin put a lot of effort into it. Let me see... Hmm! The spirit sword's origin has not been damaged. It only needs to be refined again, and it should take about two hours to restore the spirit sword to its original state. Please wait a moment, Fellow Daoist Qin." </p><p>It seemed he had come to the right place. </p><p>Qin Sang nodded and indicated that the shop owner could go ahead. </p><p>After the shop owner went to the back room, Qin Sang closed the shop door and took something out of the mustard seed bag, a dry tree root, and placed it in his palm.</p><p>Like the Five Elemental Sword-Breaking Technique, this root was also looted from Gu Tiannan's body. He recalled that when Gu Tiannan fought with Heiwa, he released a bolt of lightning using this root, which smashed half of Heiwa's bull skull, frightening the bull skull so much that it dared not come out again. The power was quite impressive, and it likely also had the ability to restrain demons.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang later used the Ten Directions Yama Array to trap Gu Tiannan, he never used this object again.</p><p>After Qin Sang obtained the root, he also examined it carefully. He did not sense any thunder power within it. It seemed to be just an ordinary root, and he had thought it was a one-time-use item and tossed it aside.</p><p>Only when he took out the Five Elemental Sword-Breaking Technique did Qin Sang discover that the root had undergone a change.</p><p>The root lay in his palm, looking ordinary. However, when Qin Sang touched it with his divine sense or spiritual power, an electric arc immediately burst forth. The electric arc was thin as a hair, but its power was intense and not to be underestimated.</p><p>"Is this a Thunder Struck Spirit Wood?" Qin Sang murmured as he rubbed his chin. His expression carried a hint of joy.</p><p>There was a spirit wood that grew in the Thunder Marsh. Year after year, it bathed in the thunder, yet it managed to live. Over a long period of time, the spirit wood itself would fuse with the thunder power and transform into a Thunder Struck Spirit Wood.</p><p>The Thunder Struck Spirit Wood contained a very strong thunder power, which was not only the nemesis of demons, but also a precious material that was difficult to obtain. To Qin Sang, it had an even more suitable use.</p><p>Qin Sang's "癸水阴雷咒" could still be used to defeat enemies in the Qi Refining Stage, but in a fight with a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator, its power was somewhat weak. After all, it was a spell that took a long time to cultivate, and it was a pity to abandon it.</p><p>Fortunately, the power of the "癸水阴雷咒" was not something that could not be increased. If he could find a spirit object that contained thunder power, he could borrow the spirit object to release an even more terrifying "癸水阴雷咒." The Thunder Struck Spirit Wood was more than suitable.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang immediately gripped the root and tried to activate the "癸水阴雷咒."</p><p>In the next moment, a flash of lightning crossed Qin Sang's palm. Then, he voluntarily dispelled it.</p><p>This bolt of lightning was no longer a simple "癸水阴雷." Its power was far from comparable to before. It made even Qin Sang secretly fearful. The combination of the spell and the spirit object did not merely double the power.</p><p>Looking at the root again, it had returned to its ordinary appearance. The thunder power that had just recovered had been exhausted.</p>
