Chapter 591: Easy as Taking Candy from a Baby (Part Three! Vote!)


“Brother Qin, look…”
Saying this, Wanderer Yun took the bone flute and placed it into his Mustard Seed Pouch.
Unexpectedly, as soon as it was inside, the pouch flashed, and the bone flute popped back out.
Wanderer Yun nodded. “Indeed, this object does have a mysterious connection to the celestial bodies! However, I suspect this piece of the bone flute might be incomplete.  All the pieces must be gathered to reveal the true nature of this treasure. Brother Qin, keep it safe. If you manage to collect all the pieces one day, you won't be disappointed.”
Qin Sang was intrigued by Wanderer Yun's words, but he also understood that fragments of such treasures were certainly not easy to collect. Perhaps some pieces had already been destroyed and no longer existed.
If that were the case, this treasure would be an unattainable dream, forever lost to the world.
Besides, if the bone flute couldn't be stored in the Mustard Seed Pouch, would he have to wear it around his neck like a leopard's collar?
Qin Sang muttered to himself, placing the bone flute into his Thousand Jun Ring without much hope.
Unexpectedly, the bone flute settled quietly inside the ring and didn't pop out.
“Hmm?”
Qin Sang was astonished and quite surprised. He raised his hand and examined the ring.
Earlier, Yi Tiannie had said that the iron plate specifically named the Thousand Jun Ring. He wasn't sure if it was a made-up name or if that was its true name.
He had assumed it was an ordinary storage artifact, similar to the Mustard Seed Pouch, just with more space. Now it seemed the Thousand Jun Ring might not be so simple.
However, no matter how Qin Sang examined it, the ring seemed to have no other function besides storage, so he had to give up for the time being.
By now, Qin Sang and Wanderer Yun had flown out of the stone hall and arrived outside the waterfall.
They were very cautious, making sure there were no ambushes outside the waterfall and that the demon cultivators hadn't arrived yet before venturing out.
“Demon cultivators are wild and unruly. They don't get along with each other, even those under the same Demon King often fight. The Shadow Leopard, heavily injured, probably wouldn't dare contact its kin, as that would be like offering itself up to be devoured.  But just in case, we shouldn't take the same path we came in. I know some side routes; we'll take a detour to avoid them.”
Following Wanderer Yun's guidance, Qin Sang ascended the waterfall, heading directly towards the top. His Corpse Core remained unsealed. He needed to break the restriction and leave the ancient herb garden as quickly as possible.
Along the way, Qin Sang answered all of Wanderer Yun's questions, recounting the information he had obtained from soul-searching Yi Tiannie.
He said hesitantly, “Senior, the Three-Light Jade Liquid is hidden in an ancient ruin. According to Yi Tiannie's memories, the ruin is protected by the remnants of an ancient spirit formation, which is not easy to break through. Before my wooden bracelet shattered, I could barely break the formation myself. I'll need your help.”
Qin Sang's biggest fear was that even with their combined strength, they wouldn't be able to break the remnants of the formation.
If that happened, he would have to wait until he finished helping Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan, to see if there was an opportunity to escape.
If escape proved impossible, he would have to wait for the Purple Firmament Palace to open again to retrieve the Three-Light Jade Liquid and nourish the Nine Phantasmal Orchid.
He could wait for the palace to reopen, but he was worried about unforeseen circumstances. He wouldn't feel at ease until the treasure was in his hands.
“Wait…”
Wanderer Yun asked urgently, “You just mentioned the ancient ruin was the remnants of a great hall. There's an ancient character inside. What kind of character?”
Qin Sang waved his hand, drawing the character in the air.
The character was ancient, yet Wanderer Yun recognized it immediately. He said with delight, “It is indeed the character 'Gather'! Remember what I said about the origin of the Three-Light Jade Liquid? This is likely the Gathering Spirit Hall, where the Gathering Spirit Bowl was kept.  I never imagined that not only the Hanging Garden Palace, but also the ruins of the Gathering Spirit Hall would still exist. No wonder the Three-Light Jade Liquid remains in the world. If it’s the Gathering Spirit Hall, Brother, don’t worry. I know how to break the remnants of the formation!”
Qin Sang looked at Wanderer Yun in astonishment.
Wanderer Yun’s knowledge far exceeded his imagination.
His mastery of restrictions could explain his control over the Demon King's blood restriction, but now, he confidently claimed to know how to break the formation of an ancient ruin he’d never seen.
That probably couldn't be explained simply by proficiency in formations.
“If this old man makes it out alive this time, I will give you an explanation,” Wanderer Yun said solemnly.
“Brother Qin, this old man has a favor to ask.
Your Nine Phantasmal Orchid is about to undergo its final transformation. If you nourish it now, only five drops are needed for it to evolve. If you can patiently wait until you reach the late stage of Golden Core, at the fastest, two hundred years from now, three drops will be enough.
If we obtain enough Three-Light Jade Liquid, could you give me three drops?
I wish to put myself in a life-or-death situation, seeking a sliver of hope.  Originally, my chances of success were only ten percent, but with the help of three drops of Three-Light Jade Liquid, it can increase to at least forty percent.
In order to survive, I have to swallow my pride and ask you this favor.”
The matter concerned Wanderer Yun’s life. Qin Sang immediately became serious.
Without hesitation, he said, “Senior, along the way, you have helped me so much. Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain any of these treasures, including the Three-Light Jade Liquid. They should be considered spoils of war for both of us. You don’t need to ask; I’ll gladly give them to you. Take as much as you need; your recovery and breakthrough are the priority.  As for the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, if there’s Three-Light Jade Liquid, there will be Ten-Light, Hundred-Light, Thousand-Light… I don’t believe that with my four-hundred-year lifespan after forming my Golden Core, I won't be able to find a solution!”
Since the Nine Phantasmal Orchid had already been revealed, Qin Sang continued directly, “When the time comes to refine the Worldly Tribulation Pill, I will need your help.”
Consuming the Nine Phantasmal Orchid directly wouldn't have any effect. It needed to be refined into the Worldly Tribulation Pill.
However, Qin Sang knew nothing about alchemy, and it would be difficult for him to cultivate in alchemy in the future.
He had been pondering who to ask for help with refining the pill.
The Worldly Tribulation Pill was so precious that it would be hard to trust a stranger.
Wanderer Yun came from the Taiyi Alchemy Sect.  He had displayed superb alchemy skills when refining the Profound-Veined Harmonizing Pill. They had also shared hardships multiple times and had forged a deep friendship, making him the best candidate.
Wanderer Yun patted Qin Sang’s shoulder, remaining silent for a moment, then said gravely, “Brother, I will remember your kindness. Three drops are enough for me; more won’t help. Don’t worry, I will give my all when refining the pill! However, after the Nine Phantasmal Orchid transforms into the Heavenly Phantasmal Orchid, the difficulty of refining the Worldly Tribulation Pill will increase. To ensure success, we might have to wait until after this old man forms his Nascent Soul.”
Even with Wanderer Yun’s alchemy skills, he needed to wait until he formed his Nascent Soul before daring to attempt it.  This showed the difficulty of refining the Worldly Tribulation Pill.
Qin Sang definitely wouldn't be able to refine it himself.
He had great confidence in Wanderer Yun’s talent. After recovering from his hidden injuries, Wanderer Yun would undoubtedly soar like a dragon among clouds.  As long as nothing unexpected happened, he would certainly form his Nascent Soul earlier than Qin Sang.
“After the Nine Phantasmal Orchid transforms into the Heavenly Phantasmal Orchid, how many Worldly Tribulation Pills can be refined?” Qin Sang asked curiously.
“Naturally, only one, for the best effect.”
Wanderer Yun said proudly, “Rest assured, Brother. This old man has two major tribulations in his life. Other than those, nothing else poses a threat. Forming my Nascent Soul will be as easy as taking candy from a baby!”
