<h1>Chapter 329 Reunion at the Secret Market</h1><p>Qin Sang rented a stone hut and set up several layers of restrictions inside. He then took out the 'parchment' from his Mustard Seed Pouch.</p><p>Outwardly, the 'parchment' remained unchanged.</p><p>When Qin Sang channeled his spiritual power onto it, a point of white light flashed immediately. Before the Ziwei Secret Key could fully manifest, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual power, and the 'parchment' returned to normal.</p><p>Holding the Ziwei Secret Key, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>He couldn't decide what to do with it.</p><p>The spiritual tide had just begun to show signs. These signs would slowly develop, followed by frequent celestial phenomena and agitated Cloud Beasts.</p><p>Until the Ancient Immortal Battlefield entered a state of complete chaos, with celestial phenomena occurring day and night and Cloud Beasts going berserk, it would be difficult for cultivators, except for the exceptionally powerful, to survive.</p><p>At that time, Seven Heroes Pass would be closed and sealed, and the spiritual tide would finally arrive.</p><p>Based on past experience, the brewing speed of each spiritual tide was different. This process could take decades, even close to a century.</p><p>If this spiritual tide came late, and he could reach the Core Formation stage before the Ziwei Palace opened, he might as well enter and explore. However, Qin Sang knew that this possibility was extremely small.</p><p>He had no clue how to reach Core Formation.</p><p>Even someone as talented as Senior Brother Qi Yuanâ€™shu, the number one cultivator below Core Formation in Shaohua Mountain, had already entered the pseudo-Core Formation stage when Qin Sang first arrived at Skull Pass. Nearly thirty years had passed, and he still hadn't formed his core. This showed how difficult it was to reach Core Formation.</p><p>He would return to Skull Pass, rely on the sect's resources, and learn more about the Ziwei Palace before making a decision.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang sighed inwardly, put away the Ziwei Secret Key, and took out his gains from the auction, laying them before him.</p><p>Several types of spiritual wood were purchased for the Ebony Sword, allowing it to slowly devour them.</p><p>The top-grade spiritual artifact, the Yellow Sand Banner, wasn't difficult to control. Qin Sang could use it proficiently after a little refinement, adding another method to his arsenal.</p><p>Then there were the three Soul-attracting Grasses.</p><p>Qin Sang opened one of the jade boxes and carefully took out a Soul-attracting Grass.</p><p>Three blades of grass intertwined, forming a 'bud' at the top, the length comparable to an adult's arm, yet light as a feather.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his nose, smelling the aura emanating from the spiritual herb. There was no unique fragrance or strange smell, but as this aura entered his body, he felt his soul subtly stirred.</p><p>He didn't touch the restrictions on the Soul-attracting Grass, deciding to wait until he was settled before refining the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Three Soul-attracting Grasses, nine blades of grass, could allow him several practice attempts, but he couldn't afford to waste them. Such spiritual herbs were rare and hard to come by.</p><p>The auction had ended in the early morning hours. Qin Sang waited in the stone hut for an hour.</p><p>After daylight broke, Qin Sang left the stone hut.</p><p>Many experts had been attracted by the auction. Today's items were significantly better than before, and Qin Sang was also interested in browsing. His harvest was quite fruitful.</p><p>Among them were two of the Five Elements Yin objects, a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Unconsciously, the day passed, and Qin Sang had explored the entire stone island. Almost every moment, he could hear people discussing last night's auction, and most of the topics were related to the Ziwei Palace and the Ziwei Secret Key.</p><p>This news would spread like a storm throughout the entire Small Cold Region, quickly sparking a frenzy to search for the Ziwei Secret Key.</p><p>A 'piece of parchment' had the chance to be exchanged for a magical treasure, who wouldn't be tempted?</p><p>Even without this auction, news of the Ziwei Secret Key would eventually come out, just not so quickly. After all, the competition for the Ziwei Secret Key was actually limited to Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Moreover, the major powers controlling the Small Cold Region, such as the Eight Righteous Sects with Nascent Soul Patriarchs, wouldn't participate. They could enter the Ziwei Palace under the protection of Nascent Soul cultivators without needing the Ziwei Secret Key.</p><p>Those who truly needed the Ziwei Secret Key were the smaller sects or rogue Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>As evening approached, Qin Sang found a deserted spot and activated the restriction on the jade pendant with his spiritual power.</p><p>A faint light lit up in the center of the jade pendant, transforming into a dagger-shaped arrow of light, pointing southeast, indicating that the secret market convened by the old man was located there.</p><p>"It won't be off the island, will it?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, following the jade pendant's guidance until he reached the edge of the stone island, discovering that the light dagger pointed towards an inconspicuous stone hut.</p><p>After observing secretly for a while, he saw people entering the stone hut one after another. Qin Sang waited until the appointed time before stepping forward.</p><p>A banner hung outside the stone hut, and there were no customers. Qin Sang tightened his cloak and stepped inside. He didn't see the old man; the shopkeeper was a beautiful young woman with Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>"What would you like..."</p><p>The young woman was lounging inside. As soon as she spoke, she saw the jade pendant revealed in Qin Sang's palm, and immediately changed to a beaming smile, whispering, "Fellow Daoist, please follow me."</p><p>Walking into the back room, there was a hidden door. Behind it was a deep, dark passage, with restrictions flickering with a faint light.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped at the entrance of the passage, staring at these restrictions.</p><p>The young woman covered her mouth and chuckled, "Fellow Daoist, don't worry, these are concealment restrictions, set up to prevent the secret market from being discovered by outsiders. We don't have the deterrent power of the Yin Mountain Pass, so we have to resort to this.  The fellow Daoists participating in our secret market also don't want to be exposed."</p><p>Seeing that they were indeed concealment restrictions, Qin Sang nodded and said lightly, "Please lead the way."</p><p>Not long after entering the passage, a small stone chamber appeared at the end. A long table and some chairs were placed in the chamber, which was almost full of cultivators in various attire.</p><p>With so many people, the stone chamber was surprisingly silent.</p><p>The old man was sitting at the head of the long table. Seeing Qin Sang enter, he immediately stood up to greet him, gesturing with his hand and saying with a smile, "Another fellow Daoist has arrived. Please sit down and wait a moment, the secret market will begin soon."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and found a chair to sit down.</p><p>He keenly sensed several inquisitive gazes falling upon him. Qin Sang pretended not to notice, while also silently observing the others.</p><p>Without exception, they were all Foundation Establishment cultivators. Among them were quite a few mid- and late-stage Foundation Establishment experts. The old man's influence surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>Many of these people might be familiar faces from yesterday's auction.</p><p>However, everyone was tightly wrapped, even more cautious than at the auction.</p><p>There were likely to be many good items today, but he didn't have much spiritual stone left. However, the spoils he had collected from Yu Daiyue and the others were still there. He hoped to have some gains.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Subsequently, a few more cultivators arrived.</p><p>The time was approaching Xu-shi (7-9 PM), the start time of the secret market.</p><p>The old man sat up straight, cleared his throat, and was about to speak when a rather heavy and unusually hurried sound of footsteps suddenly came from the passage.</p><p>Who was so impatient?</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head and saw a burly figure hurriedly squeezing in from the door. It was the strong man he had seen yesterday!</p>
