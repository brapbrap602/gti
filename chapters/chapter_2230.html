<h1>Chapter 2220: The Divine Bird</h1><p>“Take it easy, don’t burn yourself,”</p><p>Mother carefully held the bowl, watching Qin Sang gulp down the medicine, her worry turning to joy.  Qin Sang was still weak, but compared to his previous listless state, his spirit was vastly improved. Yesterday, they’d practically had to force-feed him the potion.</p><p>After finishing the bowl of medicine, warmth spread from his abdomen to his limbs, and Qin Sang felt his energy returning. Seeing him drink the entire bowl in one go, the whole family rejoiced.</p><p>“I’ll get some food…”</p><p>Mother was about to rush out. Since his illness, her son had struggled to eat. Now that he was feeling better, she wanted him to eat something quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang felt empty inside, but lacked an appetite. He found the smells around him unpleasant and felt somewhat stifled.</p><p>“I can’t eat. It’s stuffy in here. I want to go outside for some air,” Qin Sang said softly.</p><p>His voice was hoarse, and the first word was slightly odd, but quickly returned to normal. His family didn’t notice, and even if they had, they would have attributed it to his recovery from a serious illness.</p><p>The reason for this was that Qin Sang was now speaking a language unfamiliar to him – an ancient language he’d only recently heard spoken by the celestial serpent general! An ancient language prevalent during the era of the demon clan's rule in the ancient world!</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know if this language still existed in the present day, perhaps it was preserved in the demon territory.  Logically, he was experiencing Liuli’s inner demon, but why were the people in Liuli’s inner demon speaking this language?  Was it influenced by the celestial serpent general?</p><p>Some believe that inner demons and dreams share similarities, both reflecting the fears hidden within people's hearts. Even minor details in reality, easily overlooked, can trigger significant changes within inner demons and dreams.</p><p>Even so, the memories within this body were also very strange.</p><p>This body’s name was just one character – Xi.</p><p>His second brother had died young. His elder brother’s name was Luan, his father’s was Chang, and his mother’s was Lan.  None of them had surnames or characters as second names.</p><p>Historically, only people in ancient times used this naming convention. As civilization progressed, with the emergence and division of tribes, surnames gradually developed. For a long time, surnames were exclusive to the nobility; commoners and slaves were not entitled to them.</p><p>This family was clearly of commoner status.</p><p>Regardless, the world presented in Liuli’s inner demon was bizarre.  Master Ning originally speculated that Liuli’s inner demon was related to Bing Yao or Qin Sang, most likely a re-enactment of an experience from the Storm Realm.</p><p>Unless she had been to a similar place or seen such ancient texts before, it was entirely a figment of her imagination.</p><p>“What? Go out now?”</p><p>His parents’ faces showed hesitation and worry.</p><p>It was the time between spring and summer, with a warm breeze and bright sunshine – perfect weather for basking in the sun. However, their son was too weak; they worried about him catching a chill and worsening his condition.</p><p>His father hesitated, “Sanlang just drank medicine. It’s better to rest a bit before eating.”</p><p>“Father, don’t worry, I’ll be with him. I’ll carry him out!”</p><p>Luan thumped his chest, shouting towards the door, “Mother, pack two flatbreads.  We’ll give them to little brother when he gets hungry.”</p><p>Although worried, Mother didn’t object, seeing her husband and eldest son agree.</p><p>“Little brother, come on!”</p><p>They helped Qin Sang to the bed’s edge. Luan crouched down, signaling for him to climb onto his back.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He placed his feet on the floor, testing his footing, allowing his father and brother to support him as he slowly stood up, finally managing to stand steadily.</p><p>“Little brother can stand!”</p><p>Luan danced with excitement. Mother, holding a cloth-wrapped package of food, leaned against the doorframe, weeping with joy.</p><p>The two brothers, carrying the food, went out, watched by their parents. Luan was extremely careful, as if escorting a toddler learning to walk.</p><p>Their house was high up, almost halfway up a mountain.  Stepping outside, Qin Sang saw a relatively even dirt road leading to a small stream, then curving and following the stream down the mountain until it met a river.</p><p>The surrounding terrain sloped down from west to east and north to south. Their home was backed by a mountain, becoming flatter towards the southeast.</p><p>The river originated from deep within the mountains, flowing south from north.  Many houses lined both banks, forming a sizable village, with wisps of smoke rising from chimneys and unfamiliar crops growing in the fields.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze drifted eastward.  Scattered houses were visible outside the village, and a town lay not far beyond.</p><p>The town walls were low, yellowish, like an earthen rampart. The villagers' homes were also roughly built; their layout seemed illogical to Qin Sang.</p><p>In the real world, even in remote areas, people received a good education. The layout and materials of towns and villages were carefully considered.  This was true even outside the Eight Great Heavens.</p><p>Sunlight warmed his skin, a gentle breeze caressed his face.  It was pleasant; the weariness and gloom seemed to lift.</p><p>Qin Sang walked towards a stream.</p><p>Reaching the stream, he knelt, Luan shielding him with outstretched arms.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang cupped some clear water and washed his face. The cool water jolted him fully awake.</p><p>Gazing at the unfamiliar face in the water, Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>He tried to summon Tianmu Butterfly, Xiao Wu, the Thunder Beast Guards, and Yunyou – all to no avail!</p><p>Even more surprising and unsettling was his inability to sense the Altar or the Altar Guardian Gods!  His Guardian God was the Thunder God – what power could obscure him?</p><p>Previously, regardless of the illusion, Qin Sang had remained lucid under the Jade Buddha's protection.  Recognizing the illusion's unreality allowed him to easily dispel it, instantly regaining full strength. Even if Tianmu Butterfly were trapped, he could summon her immediately.  Leaving or remaining in the illusion was entirely his choice.</p><p>"A powerful illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled. This was unlike anything he'd encountered.</p><p>If this were Liuli's heart demon tribulation, it was terrifying.  Master Ning actually let Liuli undergo it here – was it really easier than elsewhere?</p><p>Qin Sang felt at a loss, unsure how to proceed.</p><p>He was now a frail mortal, stripped of his cultivation, treasures, and the fruits of his millennia of cultivation! Without knowing the reason, he might think he'd been reborn, forced to start anew.</p><p>Powerless, even if he had ideas, Qin Sang lacked the ability to break the illusion.</p><p>To be precise, he hadn't lost everything.  He still possessed one thing.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his right hand, examining the iron ring on his thumb – identical in appearance to the Qianjun Ring!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring, named for its immense weight, was far beyond the capacity of a mortal to bear.  But what he wore was a simple iron ring, only slightly heavy.</p><p>However, this iron ring didn't appear with his consciousness.  According to this body's memories, his father had commissioned it years ago, a gift specially made when having a snare trap crafted.</p><p>This ring was Qin Sang's only familiar object. Once he regained some cultivation, determining if it was indeed the Qianjun Ring might be key to breaking the illusion.</p><p>'Gurgling...'</p><p>Qin Sang's stomach rumbled, pulling him from his thoughts.</p><p>Luan chuckled, "Hungry, are we?"</p><p>He produced a cloth bundle containing two steaming wheat cakes, their aroma filling the air.</p><p>Instead of giving them to Qin Sang first, Luan broke off a piece, crushing it and scattering it on the riverbank stones.</p><p>'Chirping...'</p><p>Birds chirped from the trees; several birds resembling magpies were attracted. Unafraid, they descended, readily feeding near them.</p><p>Luan clasped his hands, seemingly praying to the birds with a devout expression.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>According to his acquired memories, his father taught them to offer a portion of their food to the local birds, seeking their protection.</p><p>The birds were their faith.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the village below. A stone temple stood at the village entrance, its peak adorned with a stone carving of a bird's head, resembling an eagle. Periodically, the village elders led the villagers in worship.</p><p>Their faith in the birds meant they wouldn't harm them; doing so was a grave sin.  Birds stealing crops were seen as a blessing from the avian deities.</p><p>Though hunters lived in the village, and Qin Sang's father sometimes hunted, they only hunted beasts, never birds.</p><p>Their language and beliefs seemed strange to Qin Sang.  Could the vision he'd experienced truly be a glimpse of the ancient past?  If so, what were the cultivators in that vision like? Were they all demons?</p><p>Xi's memories held no record of cultivators, nor any mention of cultivation. Qin Sang wondered where he should even begin his search for immortals in this world.</p><p>"Here, eat! Don't choke."</p><p>Luan finished his warning before handing Qin Sang the flatbread and waterskin.</p><p>Qin Sang took a bite. The fragrant wild greens were mixed with the rich aroma of oil and a small piece of fatty pork.  This was a delicacy his family rarely afforded, even once a year. Luan swallowed hard at the smell, but Qin Sang pretended not to notice; he needed the strength these two pieces of flatbread would give him.</p><p>Though far inferior to any spiritual fruit or immortal brew, the food whetted Qin Sang's appetite. He ate faster and faster, and after finishing, felt his strength return somewhat.</p><p>"Let's continue downriver."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up.</p><p>Luan hesitated. His younger brother had fallen seriously ill, and all sorts of rumors were swirling.  When Luan had gone down to the village before, the familiar villagers had avoided him, afraid his brother's condition would cause trouble.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's improved mood, Luan, worried about upsetting him, didn't explain fully. "Don't go too far," he said instead.</p><p>They walked slowly along the stream.  Bold birds even landed on their heads. Luan looked as if he'd received a divine blessing.</p><p>As they walked, Qin Sang considered his next steps. Though lacking cultivation, his current situation was stable; at least he wasn't in immediate danger. He wondered where Liuli was and what her circumstances were now.</p><p>Liuli's demonic obsession had surprised them both. Qin Sang himself had changed; Liuli was likely the same, and worse, without the Jade Buddha's protection, she might not even remember her past identity.</p><p>Qin Sang's role was to help Liuli overcome her obsession; he couldn't simply wait for her to regain her senses.</p><p>How could he possibly find her in a sea of faces?</p><p>Could she, too, possess an item similar to the Qianjun Ring, something reflected from reality…?</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the iron ring, pondering.</p><p>Of course, the most pressing matter was restoring his own cultivation. Unlike his initial arrival in Xiao Han Domain, his mind now held countless cultivation techniques and secret arts; he wouldn't need to search for a master.</p><p>For now, he'd have to begin training anew.  He needed a way to get his family to leave him alone so he could close himself off and cultivate.</p><p>"Little brother, look…"</p><p>Luan suddenly pointed north, shouting, "A rainbow! Such a beautiful rainbow!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction of his finger.  Mountains stretched to the horizon, and between them, a five-colored rainbow arced across the sky, finally descending into the city, lingering for a long time to form a gigantic rainbow bridge across the land.</p><p>There was no mist in the mountains, nor had it rained recently. This wasn't a natural phenomenon.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. It was clearly the escaping light of a cultivator!</p><p>Xi's memories contained no record of cultivators, yet one was here, hidden from ordinary eyes.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang had lost his cultivation and couldn't sense demonic energy; he couldn't tell if the being was human or demon, nor what its cultivation level was.</p><p>Was it simply passing through or returning home?</p><p>The presence of a cultivator in the city heightened Qin Sang's awareness. His situation wasn't as safe as he'd thought.</p><p>Luan, never having seen such a large rainbow bridge, was ecstatic, eager to run to the city.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang noticed commotion at the city gate. Several dark figures burst from the crowd and raced down the main road in different directions.</p><p>They were moving incredibly fast, riding wolf-like creatures; tall and powerful, their mounts ran more steadily than horses.</p><p>Clad in leather armor and carrying swords at their waists, they were clearly city guards.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they reached the outskirts of the village.</p><p>'Dong! Dong! Dong!'</p><p>A guard struck a large gong several times, alarming the villagers, who emerged from their homes.</p><p>"Proclamation at the city gate!"</p><p>"Proclamation at the city gate!"</p><p>…</p><p>The guard's voice was louder than the gong, heard clearly by Qin Sang and Luan.</p><p>Without stopping, the guards continued downriver, towards other villages.</p><p>"Proclamation? What proclamation?"</p><p>Luan scratched his head, completely bewildered.</p><p>By now, several villagers were leaving for the city gate.</p><p>"Brother, take me to see," Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Considering the sudden appearance of the cultivator, Qin Sang had a feeling this proclamation was significant, perhaps the key to understanding this vision.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Luan hesitated, but seeing Qin Sang's improved condition, he couldn't resist the curiosity about the rainbow bridge and the proclamation.</p><p>"Wait here, I'll get the cart!"</p><p>Luan ran home and brought out a strangely shaped one-wheeled cart, helping Qin Sang settle onto it.</p><p>As the cart rattled through the village, its 'creak, creak, creak' echoed in Qin Sang's ears.</p>
