<h1>Chapter 809: Enemies</h1><p>Chapter 809: Enemies</p><p>He looked around. There were no nearby islands for refuge, so he immediately activated the talisman.</p><p>The next moment, a storm struck.</p><p>Qin Sang, like a ghost, swayed in the raging wind and rain.</p><p>It was unclear when the storm would subside. Qin Sang pressed on, facing the wind and rain.</p><p>Linggui Island was near a medium-sized island called Bamen Island, with dozens of smaller, barren islands nearby, none of which interested high-level cultivators.</p><p>According to information Qin Sang gathered along the way, the factions in this sea area were not strong. The most powerful sect, Hanhai Sect, was led by a mere Jindan cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally rehearsed how he would meet the Lord of Linggui Island.</p><p>Having come this far, whether or not it was Elder Qingzhu, a visit to the island was a certainty.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly. He planned to conceal his cultivation, mingle around Linggui Island for a while, and learn about the island lord's character before making a move.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Wang only knew about the island lord from rumors; only the residents of the surrounding islands knew the details.</p><p>Finally having news of Elder Qingzhu, Qin Sang felt some trepidation.</p><p>But overall, he was full of anticipation. Elder Qingzhu was a true sword cultivator;  his character was partially evident from the two letters and his past deeds.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang set his course towards Bamen Island, cutting through the wind.</p><p>The storm intensified, the surroundings plunged into darkness.  After flying for some distance, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, as if he'd heard something.</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently, distinguishing unusual sounds from the chaos, and abruptly changed direction.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang saw a wooden ship about to capsize.</p><p>The wind howled, waves crashed, and rain poured down.</p><p>The ship was tossed about, a protective light shield, clearly a spirit array, was shattered, flickering and about to extinguish.</p><p>Parts of the ship were exposed to the storm, appearing fragile and severely damaged.</p><p>The ship was listing heavily, on the verge of capsizing.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyesight was excellent. He saw survivors on board and, after a moment's hesitation, flew towards the ship.</p><p>Approaching the ship, he could see more clearly.</p><p>Several people were running around on deck, panicked and disorganized, not ordinary people, but their cultivation was low, only Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>These people were clearly trying to repair the spirit array but were failing. Some were breaking down, crying out in despair. Without the ship and the protection of the array, these Qi Condensation cultivators had almost no chance of survival in the storm.</p><p>"Quick! Put all the spirit stones in! Third Brother, go to the cabin and see if Master has woken up!"</p><p>A young man in white clothes, trying to suppress his panic, frantically repaired the array. However, his cultivation was insufficient, and despite his best efforts, he couldn't make any progress.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A wave several zhang high crashed down.</p><p>The protective shield dimmed further. The ship didn't break apart, but it was close, creaking ominously.</p><p>Just as everyone was despairing, a strange figure suddenly appeared on deck.</p><p>They thought they were seeing things, but upon closer inspection, they found it to be a young man, who looked even younger than them, but far calmer. His aura was not weaker than their Master's.</p><p>"Who are you? Are there only a few of you on this ship?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, frowning.</p><p>His appearance was somewhat disheveled, as he was disguised as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>The young man in white, after a brief moment of surprise, thought of his Master's serious injuries and the possibility of foul play, feeling both joy and worry, and dared not lie.</p><p>However, death at this person's hands was no different from death in the storm.</p><p>He remained relatively calm and called out, "Senior, we are disciples of Sanshan Sect. We were at sea with our Master when a storm hit and our ship was attacked by sea beasts, damaging the spirit array. Master repelled the beasts but was seriously injured and fell unconscious. We implore you, Senior, to save us!"</p><p>Qin Sang swept his spiritual sense and found a seriously injured Foundation Establishment cultivator, a middle-aged man, in the cabin. He flashed inside.</p><p>The young man in white and the others were startled and quickly followed.</p><p>They saw Qin Sang holding their Master's arm, seemingly checking his injuries.</p><p>Everyone held their breath.</p><p>The man's injuries were severe; his internal organs were damaged. Qin Sang took out a healing pill and put it in his mouth. The medicine took effect immediately, and the man slowly regained consciousness, though he remained weak.</p><p>The young man in white and the others rejoiced.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend, for saving our lives…"</p><p>The man, startled by the stranger, after hearing his disciples' explanation, tried to support himself and express his gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang waved to stop them, saying, "Friend, your injuries are too severe. You need a period of rest to recover.  The storm outside is fierce, and the wooden ship is about to capsize. I was heading to Ba Men Island when I encountered the storm and sought shelter on your ship. Please tell me the secrets of the spirit array so I can repair it."</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang returned to the deck, took out some spirit materials, and easily restored the spirit array.</p><p>The protective barrier was restored, withstanding the storm.</p><p>The ship was finally saved from capsizing, and the young man in white and the others narrowly escaped death. They followed Qin Sang's instructions implicitly, repairing the damage to the ship.</p><p>Once the ship stabilized, Qin Sang ordered others to steer while he returned to the cabin to speak with their master.</p><p>"My surname is Wu. I'm originally a solitary cultivator who took on several inept disciples.  My sect is called the Three Mountain Gate. We've been cultivating on a small island near Ba Men Island. This time, I was out on business, and we suffered many calamities, nearly losing our lives. We owe our lives to Qin's timely arrival…"</p><p>Master Wu's complexion had improved somewhat.  He curiously asked, "You cultivate on Ba Men Island? We've never met before, have we?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I am not a cultivator of Ba Men Island, but a solitary cultivator who travels. I once sought out major sects and clans, but unfortunately, my talent is limited, and I was not accepted. I unexpectedly learned of a rumor that a senior cultivator near Ba Men Island had established a training ground to teach solitary cultivators and guide them, so I came here to seek instruction."</p><p>"You're here to find the Linggui Island Master?"</p><p>Master Wu exclaimed, a strange glint suddenly flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Seeing his unusual expression, Qin Sang felt a tightening in his chest and repeatedly asked, "What's wrong? Is the rumor false?"</p><p>Master Wu shook his head. "The rumor is true.  To be honest with you, Qin Daoist, I was also a solitary cultivator from another place. I was drawn here after hearing that the senior Island Master was giving lectures, and I received great guidance from him. Later, by chance, I successfully built my foundation.  But… you've come too late."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this. "That senior cultivator has left?"</p><p>"No, not left."</p><p>Master Wu sighed, his eyes filled with deep hatred. He gritted his teeth, saying, "The senior cultivator's enemy found him! The Island Master had been in seclusion here for two hundred years, yet his enemy didn't let him be. They tracked him down and razed Linggui Island to the ground. The Island Master's fate is unknown!"</p>
