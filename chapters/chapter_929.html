<h1>Chapter 921: The Mark</h1><p>Continuing to perform the secret technique, Qin Sang worked to dispel the inner demons of his avatar.</p><p>A while later, Qin Sang opened his palm, revealing jade slips enveloped in flowing light, arranged before him.</p><p>These were all the various corpse refining techniques he had collected during this period.  He had only briefly glanced at them before, but now he planned to carefully study them.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>He looked at the row of jade slips in front of him, his expression somewhat perplexed.</p><p>“I've collected quite a few corpse refining techniques over the years, covering various schools of thought, but none of them share anything in common with the *Tianyin Corpse Manual*. Is the *Tianyin Corpse Manual* so unique that it has charted an unprecedented and unparalleled path, or am I looking in the wrong direction? Could it be that the *Tianyin Corpse Manual* is not simply a corpse dao inheritance…”</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped a jade slip with his finger, pondered for a moment, and then stood up.</p><p>He glanced around the cave.</p><p>This place, where he had been in secluded cultivation for over thirty years, felt so familiar.</p><p>Over the years, not only had his strength visibly improved, but these years of undisturbed cultivation were also a rare and precious memory.</p><p>Now, it was time to leave.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang stored the items in the cave into his spatial ring.</p><p>At this moment, his avatar also awoke from its meditative state. After Qin Sang's continuous application of the secret technique, the demonic soul had temporarily stabilized and returned to normal.</p><p>The avatar pointed a finger at the black coffin. A series of cracking sounds echoed as the coffin split into several pieces. After transforming in mid-air, the pieces combined to form a seamless suit of black armor, which enveloped the avatar.</p><p>Then, the avatar's protective aura flashed, concealing the armor beneath its outer garments. Its eyes turned to Qin Sang's main body.</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's face, and he was about to speak when his heart stirred. He looked down at the spirit beast pouch at his waist.</p><p>Fatty was awake.</p><p>“This guy, he's digested another piece of Violet Crystal. Ever since breaking through to the mid-stage of the third transformation, he's been eating faster and faster. The Violet Crystals are almost gone.  I'll need to collect a few more when I go to the Seven Kills Palace. I wonder if the owner of that place has changed…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>Both Fatty and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had broken through to the mid-stage of the third transformation, although the Sky-Eyed Butterfly cultivated much slower than Fatty.</p><p>He didn't know the true origin of the Violet Crystals. Fatty ate, slept, and ate again, cultivating at a speed faster than Qin Sang had anticipated. However, the two little creatures hadn't changed much since their breakthrough, other than perhaps their magical powers becoming more formidable.</p><p>After feeding Fatty a small piece of Violet Crystal, Qin Sang walked out of the cave.  His divine sense touched the restrictive formation, awakening Bai Zhongqiu and his wife.</p><p>“What instructions do you have, Senior?”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife hurried out of their cave.</p><p>At the same time, a ripple stirred within the miasma outside. Bai Ying'er and the Twin-Headed Serpent also emerged. The serpent seemed to sense something and stayed close to Bai Ying'er, its brow furrowed and lips pursed, looking nervously at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand and took out a jade bottle, tossing it to Bai Zhongqiu.</p><p>Inside the bottle were two strangely colored pills.</p><p>The moment he saw the pills, Bai Zhongqiu's eyes were glued to them, his expression filled with uncontainable excitement.</p><p>“Over the years, you two have served diligently. I made a promise to give you two Fiendshaper Pills, and I naturally won't go back on my word. These two were obtained by chance some time ago. The demonic energy within them has been carefully refined, making them top-grade Fiendshaper Pills,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Thank you for your reward, Senior! We are eternally grateful!”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife were overjoyed.</p><p>Although they had some savings, it was difficult for them to buy such high-quality Fiendshaper Pills.  The purer potency and reduced residual demonic energy would increase their chances of forming their Gold Cores.</p><p>After their initial joy, Bai Zhongqiu suddenly realized something and asked softly, “Senior, are you now…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. “Since you know I bought the Seven Kills Palace jade talisman, you should have guessed it already. This venomous island was merely a temporary cave for me. The Seven Kills Palace will open in a few years, and it's time to leave and make preparations. Ying'er has been by my side for so many years, managing the cave.  Although I have no intention of taking disciples, there is a certain bond between us. This place will be left to her. Don't be too ostentatious in your future endeavors, and others will hardly discover the island's secrets. This jade slip contains the methods to control the island's illusory formations and restrictions…”</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, and the jade slip flew towards Bai Ying'er.</p><p>Bai Ying'er tightly grasped the jade slip, her eyes suddenly reddening as she knelt down. “Although Senior doesn’t acknowledge me as a disciple, I have received your guidance many times and have always regarded you as my master in my heart…”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife looked at their daughter, their hearts filled with mixed emotions.</p><p>In the past, they had been terrified in Qin Sang's presence. After so many years, they had long understood that meeting this person was probably the greatest fortune of their family.</p><p>“Senior, will you return in the future?  Just consider us your caretakers…”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu’s words contained genuine sincerity.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and slowly shook his head. “You must have heard of the Seven Kills Palace.  The path ahead is uncertain, and whether I can come out alive is unknown.  It's too early to talk about the future.  Moreover, the spiritual veins on this island are only mediocre for me, and it's in such a remote location…”</p><p>The implication was that they were unlikely to meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang was long accustomed to partings and reunions, his expression unchanged.  He nodded to the Twin-Headed Serpent, signaling his departure.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent whimpered softly, turning to look at Bai Ying'er. Bai Ying'er's face was full of reluctance, and tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She had been left on the venomous island to cultivate, and for years, she hadn’t seen any outsiders. The Twin-Headed Serpent was her only friend. After this parting, she didn’t know when they would meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Bai Zhongqiu and his wife, turning to leave.  However, the Twin-Headed Serpent whined and leaped in front of Bai Ying'er.  A brilliant cyan light suddenly erupted from its body, and a cyan phantom separated from it.</p><p>The phantom rapidly shrank until it was only the size of a fingernail, landing on the back of Bai Ying'er's hand.</p><p>The cyan light faded, and the phantom disappeared, leaving behind a tattoo-like mark on her hand.</p><p>After doing this, the Twin-Headed Serpent's breath weakened considerably.  It returned to Qin Sang's side, looking drowsy.</p><p>Surprise flickered across Qin Sang's face.  He glanced at the Twin-Headed Serpent and explained to the bewildered Bai Ying'er and the others, “This is a protective measure it has given you, at the cost of its own strength. When facing a powerful enemy, use your divine sense to activate the power within the mark. It can protect you once. Even a mid-stage Gold Core cultivator caught off guard would suffer a significant blow.”</p><p>Hearing this, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife were overjoyed and urged Bai Ying'er, “Ying'er, quickly thank the divine serpent!”</p><p>In the next moment, everything blurred before their eyes.</p><p>The poisonous miasma churned, and Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Serpent vanished without a trace.</p>
