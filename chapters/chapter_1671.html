<h1></h1><p>Death Seal, Heavenly Thunder, Magnetic Light.</p><p>Any one of these three attacks, if directed at an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, would likely result in instant death.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had reached the pinnacle of body refinement, and within the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light, Dharma cultivators were far more restricted than he was. Many magical treasures and divine abilities were either unusable or their trajectory would be altered by the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic force, greatly diminishing their power.</p><p>He dared to snatch the treasure while facing the Death Seal and Heavenly Thunder precisely because of his immense confidence, believing he could handle any situation.</p><p>But he hadn't anticipated a third person, lying in wait, hidden so perfectly.</p><p>With all three attacks converging, Master Huaiyin's Arhat Golden Body, though powerful, couldn't withstand them. The Arhat Golden Body shattered instantly. Kundao had been waiting for this opportunity; how could she possibly miss it? She exploited the opening, her single strike finding its mark!</p><p>Feeling the sticky warmth of blood on her palm, Kundao's eyes curved with a smile.</p><p>In her eyes, Master Huaiyin's vigorous lifeblood was even more enticing than a Nascent Soul.</p><p>However, Kundao's triumph was short-lived. Her prey didn't lose the ability to resist as expected, succumbing to her whims.</p><p>At this moment, Kundao had already channeled the Magnetic Light through Master Huaiyin's wound into his internal organs, intending to detonate it, completely shattering his viscera.</p><p>"What foul demon!"</p><p>A furious roar suddenly echoed.</p><p>The roar contained a soul-stirring power.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Dragon's Chant, a secret, untransmitted art of the Buddhist Sect. The chant, like thunder, could subdue all enemies. Used by Master Huaiyin, empowered by his lifeblood, its might was even more terrifying.</p><p>Those with weaker minds would immediately suffer a soul shock, their hearts filled with dread.</p><p>Kundao froze slightly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had turned at some unknown point, facing Kundao, chanting sutras with his tongue. The Buddhist light in his eyes was ignited by fury, his killing intent shockingly intense.</p><p>At this moment, Master Huaiyin was bathed in dazzling Buddhist light. The fragments of his shattered Arhat Golden Body, instead of scattering, reassembled, transforming back into a lifeblood golden dragon, aiding him in unleashing this Heavenly Dragon's Chant.</p><p>The lifeblood golden dragon merged into the chant, forming tangible sound waves.</p><p>In contrast, Master Huaiyin himself looked withered, as if on the verge of death.</p><p>His Golden Body was shattered, his internal organs damaged, and his body severely wounded. Forcibly using the Heavenly Dragon's Chant in this state further drained his lifeblood; he was at the end of his rope.</p><p>The chant clearly couldn't completely subdue Kundao, only buying him a brief respite.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Master Huaiyin's outstretched right hand didn't retract, resolutely grasping at the cluster of fragments, while his left hand returned to his chest.</p><p>His fingers curled inward, forming a single-handed seal.</p><p>Kundao shook her head, freeing herself from the impact of the chant. Seeing that Master Huaiyin was still fixated on the treasure, she inwardly scoffed at his recklessness.  Just as she was about to kill him, she felt the arm she'd plunged into Master Huaiyin's body suddenly constricted.</p><p>An astonishing, tremendous force erupted from within Master Huaiyin, forcing all the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light within him back.</p><p>Kundao felt the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light compressed around her palm, unable to harm Master Huaiyin in the slightest. Moreover, the force grew increasingly fierce, threatening to throw her off.</p><p>Even more astonishingly, a golden light flowed from the hand seal across Master Huaiyin's skin, his aura visibly surging.  He had been near death, yet nowâ€¦</p><p>This golden light emanated from Master Huaiyin's hand seal.</p><p>Wherever the golden light touched, it was as if misfortune had turned to fortune.  A rumbling thunderous sound emanated from Master Huaiyin's meridians, the color returned to his face, his lifeblood golden dragon re-formed, and the Arhat Golden Body reappeared!</p><p>In an instant, Master Huaiyin had almost returned to his peak condition. If not for the horrifying wound on his back, no one would have guessed he had just been grievously injured, on the brink of death.</p><p>"Die, demon!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin roared again.</p><p>This wasn't the Heavenly Dragon's Chant, but his voice was full of vigor.</p><p>The Arhat Golden Body lowered its brow, striking a palm towards Kundao's crown.  The Arhat's arm was wreathed in golden dragons, leaving swirling golden patterns in its wake. An astonishing storm erupted from thin air, scattering the Magnetic Light, as if shattering the void itself.</p><p>Kundao was at the center of the storm, her delicate wrist still embedded in Master Huaiyin's wound. If she didn't retreat, she would have to endure this palm strike from the Arhat Golden Body.</p><p>In less than a breath, the situation had shifted dramatically, a dizzying spectacle.</p><p>Kundao's sneak attack had nearly killed Master Huaiyin, but then the tables had turned completely.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were both astonished.</p><p>Astonished by the sudden appearance of the attacker, and also by Master Huaiyin's powerful divine ability.</p><p>The attacker's concealment had been flawless, her timing impeccable, clearly a long-planned ambush.  If it were them, they might not have escaped this calamity.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine. If not for the Fire Jade Centipede's warning, he would have been the one ambushed.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had inadvertently shielded him from disaster.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability pierced through the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Kundao's attire clearly and was instantly drawn to an object at her waist.</p><p>It was a fiery red jade pendant, with what looked like molten lava flowing within. It was identical to the jade pendant in the Ice Instrument Palace's tribulation vision. The Fire Jade Centipede's reaction also confirmed that this jade pendant was what attracted it.</p><p>"Crimson Immortal Pendant!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his eyes brightening, his thoughts racing. Without hesitation, he again cast the Thunder Sound and Soul-Capturing True Words.</p><p>In truth, he had already planned this.</p><p>It was the same attack as before, only now directed at Kundao.</p><p>Master Huaiyin came from the Western Lands and had few enemies in the Central Continent.  Kundao's unhesitating attack suggested she was a ruthless killer.</p><p>Kundao had repeatedly spied on him, clearly with ill intentions. Even without the Crimson Immortal Pendant, Qin Sang wouldn't have shown mercy.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also speculating about Kundao's origins.</p><p>Since entering the Formless Immortal Sect, he had never seen this woman, nor did Qi Ling Cave Master's remnant soul have any related memories.</p><p>However, Kundao's actions offered clues.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that the explosion of the Star Pavilion and the unearthing of the ancient cultivator's legacy were her doing.</p><p>This woman could conceal herself using the divine restrictions and manipulate the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light.  But her control was clearly limited, otherwise, she wouldn't have needed to meticulously set up this trap; directly controlling the divine restrictions would have been enough to put them all in danger.</p><p>"Is she Zhu Wudao's accomplice?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered a possibility.</p><p>It was plausible that Zhu Wudao had gathered a group of demons and monsters, keeping them in reserve against Qi Ling Cave Master and the others, as a precaution against betrayal.</p><p>Furthermore, in Qi Ling Cave Master's memories, Zhu Wudao had mentioned many Formless Immortal Sect descendants hiding in the shadows, some secretly watching them.  However, they were constantly hunted by other forces and didn't dare reveal their identities.</p><p>Now that the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy had appeared, those forces were likely restless.</p><p>It wouldn't be strange for these individuals, possessing treasures from the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance, to move freely within Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through his mind, yet they didn't affect Qin Sang's judgment and actions.</p><p>As he attacked, Qin Sang reversed his retreat, his phoenix wings flapping powerfully, leaving a black fire trail in the void as he charged back.</p><p>While Qin Sang advanced, Master Huaiyin, multitasking, had already reached into the cluster of fragments.</p><p>Before the ambush, Master Huaiyin had intended to sweep away all the treasures. With the Poison King arriving soon after, he could have retreated unscathed even after enduring Qin Sang and Su Zinan's combined attack.</p><p>If the female cultivator's relics contained information about Emperor Bestowal Mountain, it would prove useful in cornering the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>Although he had obtained the more precious Xin Metal Essence Crystal, which could replace the spiritual object he was searching for, his agreement with the Poison King still stood. And he owed this opportunity, in part, to the Poison King; he couldn't simply break his promise.</p><p>Now, severely injured, Master Huaiyin didn't dare be arrogant and had to prioritize.</p><p>He gathered the golden light in his palm, capturing only the Xin Metal Essence Crystal. His arm vibrated powerfully, sending the other treasures flying away, lest they attract further attacks.</p><p>Some treasures were destroyed in the explosion.</p><p>Only a few remained.</p><p>Among them were four swords.  Two were long swords, one of which had originally rested on the female cultivator's lap and was presumably her personal sword. The other two were the size of fingers, one a golden sword and the other a jade sword.</p><p>The small spiritual swords had no scabbards. Judging by their shape, they resembled sword talismans.</p><p>There was also a black jade box with a seal, its light flickering incessantly, evidently due to the intense impact it had suffered.</p><p>Qin Sang was focused on the jade pendant at Kundao's waist.  He glanced at the treasures but didn't change his target.</p><p>However, Su Zinan, whose eyesight wasn't as keen as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's, and whose vision and perception were blocked by the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light surrounding Master Huaiyin, could only see Kundao's blurry figure and hadn't yet noticed the Fire Rhinoceros.</p><p>As he watched in bewilderment, he saw the treasures being flung away by Master Huaiyin, and his expression flickered.</p><p>Su Zinan's figure flashed repeatedly, also advancing, gathering the residual power of the Death Seal and heading straight for Kundao. His thoughts were similar to Qin Sang's:  Kundao's origins were unknown, making her a valuable captive.  It was best to capture her alive.</p><p>However, Su Zinan was more adept at reaping the benefits; he appeared to be aiming for the scattered treasures.</p><p>A faint mist constantly swirled around him. This was the manifestation of the two main soul powers of the Demonic Banner, countering the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic force.</p><p>As long as the main souls didn't detach from him, they wouldn't be detected. Even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly hadn't noticed them, assuming it was simply Su Zinan's protective magical treasure.</p><p>In an instant, all sides converged, and a chaotic battle was about to erupt.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder descended once more.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instinctively defended himself, then realized, surprisingly, that it was aimed at Kundao. Unable to fathom why Qin Sang was helping him, he put the question aside. The Golden Arhat's palm descended, generating a thick goldenç½¡wind.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Locked onto by the Heavenly Thunder and the Buddhist palm, Kundao appeared unusually vulnerable.  The Heavenly Dragon's Chant and the Soul-Capturing True Words followed close behind, further shaking her spirit.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had summoned the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Within the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light, the Sun God Birds were easily disrupted, their trajectory deviating. He had to wait until he was closer before unleashing them.</p><p>Though it seemed complicated, Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin reacted incredibly swiftly, giving Kundao almost no breathing room.</p><p>Just as Kundao seemed about to be crushed by the combined attacksâ€¦</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly saw Kundao retract her arm, spreading her other arm wide, closing her eyes, and opening her mouth in a bloodcurdling scream. The scream was so piercing that even through the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic force, Qin Sang felt as if needles were piercing his eardrums.</p><p>Outside the battlefield, the Poison King was almost there.  He faintly heard the woman's shriek and his expression grew serious.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's two roars, coupled with this shriek, indicated some unforeseen development.  The Poison King had confidence in Master Huaiyin's strength, but these sounds made him uneasy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't adept at dealing with the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic force and had fallen behind.</p><p>Thinking this, the Poison King didn't hesitate.  With a flick of his sleeve and a muttered incantation, he completed a hand seal and extended his index finger.</p><p>A black thread shot out from his sleeve. The Poison King's finger brushed against the end of the thread, stirring up a black demonic wind that pierced through layers of the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic force, rushing towards the battlefield ahead of him.</p><p>The Poison King's gaze was serious as he slowed down considerably, remotely controlling his venomous insects through his mind.</p><p>Hearing the scream, Qin Sang inwardly cursed, then saw the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light around Kundao rapidly converge, forming a yellow-black pillar of light that shot straight up, directly confronting the giant palm of the Arhat Golden Body.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kundao's hasty action was imperfect. The protective Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light around her thinned, unable to block the Heavenly Thunder and the Death Seal.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Amidst the thunderclap, the giant palm was obstructed, but the Heavenly Thunder and the Death Seal pierced through the weakened Magnetic Light, striking Kundao almost simultaneously.</p><p>Surprisingly, Kundao didn't die instantly from these two attacks. Her injuries were far lighter than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>At some point, a grayish mist had appeared around Kundao's body.  This mist resembled chaos and clashed with the Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light.</p><p>With Kundao's scream, the mist surged.</p><p>Simultaneously, the space around her began to tremble, becoming extremely unstable. The surrounding Nine Heavens Earthly Magnetic Divine Light shattered, and Master Huaiyin's gaze turned solemn; he sensed danger.</p><p>His recovery, achieved through a secret technique, was already difficult and couldn't be maintained for long.  Having obtained the Xin Metal Essence Crystal, he was already contemplating retreat. Seeing Kundao forced back, he decisively withdrew.</p><p>Kundao's shoulder was struck by lightning, her skin and flesh torn, blood vaporized by the thunderous force.</p><p>Her chest was struck by the Death Seal, a 'death' character clearly imprinted on her body. The vital essence within her was stirred by an unknown force, drawn towards the Death Seal.</p><p>But these injuries weren't fatal; the mist seemed to have absorbed most of their power.</p><p>As space and the divine restrictions vibrated, Kundao's figure became increasingly illusory.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood:  Kundao was escaping!</p><p>To his disappointment, Master Huaiyin chose to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm, the Sun God Tree reappearing, slowly rotating in his palm.  The three divine birds on it flapped their wings, about to take flight.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kundao was faster.  The mist surged like an ocean from an unknown space, cracking the void as it passed, creating numerous fissures.</p><p>Qin Sang, and the others, knew instinctively that these weren't spatial rifts, but gaps in the divine restrictions.</p><p>The other side of these fissures was likely the exit they desperately sought, but now, none of them wanted to enter.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>The fissures spread rapidly, quickly surrounding Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Su Zinan finally saw Kundao's face clearly, his eyes widening:  "Fire Rhinoceros!"</p><p>He finally understood why Qin Sang had so decisively attacked Kundao.  He was drawn by this treasure. Without hesitation, he lunged towards Kundao.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan charged forward, but Master Huaiyin moved in the opposite direction, retreating further, without a shred of hesitation.</p><p>Just then, a strange hissing wind sound came from the distance, and a demonic wind rushed over, revealing faint black threads within.</p><p>The Poison King had finally arrived!</p><p>Master Huaiyin's mind eased, and he hurried towards the demonic wind, indeed seeing the Poison King following behind.</p><p>"Masterâ€¦"</p><p>Seeing the wounds on Master Huaiyin, the Poison King was shocked.</p><p>Master Huaiyin exhaled softly, his breath ragged, and sighed, "Forgive this poor monk for being unable to continue our journey together, fellow Daoist."</p>
