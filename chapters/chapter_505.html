<h1>Chapter 498:  Preparing for the Pill</h1><p>Chapter 498:  Preparing for the Pill</p><p>A fragrant scent filled the room.</p><p>The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid was vibrant and lush.</p><p>Qin Sang sat beside the jade pool, idly stirring the water with a finger, lost in thought, replaying her conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>Restoring her foundation was only one benefit of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. For other cultivators, especially demonic beasts, this heavenly treasure was an absolute must-have.</p><p>Yun Youzi had received a dubious piece of information from his sect:  the Taiyi Pill Sect was always keenly interested in various spiritual herbs, collecting them regardless of authenticity.</p><p>To confirm, he first spent several years undercover in Xianyao City, controlled by the Yuling Sect.</p><p>Xianyao City was the closest cultivation city to Tianyao Hill in the Xiao Han Region.  It was said to be supported by Tianyao Hill, serving as a gateway between the hill and the Xiao Han cultivation world.  This highlighted the close relationship between the Yuling Sect and Tianyao Hill.</p><p>Finally, Yun Youzi even joined a trading caravan, infiltrating Tianyao Hill several times. While he spoke of it lightly, Qin Sang could imagine how thrilling and dangerous it must have been.</p><p>Humans and demons have historically struggled to coexist, and it's not solely due to prejudice.</p><p>Because of this, after years of Yun Youzi's disappearance, he finally confirmed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's existence. However, the specifics needed to be seen firsthand.</p><p>Yun Youzi agreed to accompany Qin Sang initially before attending to his own matters.</p><p>Even with Yun Youzi’s help, Qin Sang felt uneasy.  Tianyao Hill's demonic beasts at the Core Formation stage weren't like the ignorant creatures dwelling in treacherous mountains and rivers.</p><p>Beasts that had obtained Imperial Dew and gained sentience were never ordinary, possessing powerful demonic lineages.  Their strength and intelligence were comparable to human Core Formation cultivators; they couldn't be underestimated.</p><p>Relying solely on the Flying Night Rakshasa to deal with a Core Formation demonic beast offered little chance of success, let alone the possibility that the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit might attract more than one.</p><p>In such a situation, even opportunistic tactics required sufficient strength.</p><p>The Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's location was undoubtedly significant.  Without Core Formation-level strength, it would be almost impossible to enter undetected under the watchful eyes of Core Formation demonic beasts.</p><p>Therefore, Yun Youzi advised Qin Sang to remain calm.  Their primary goal in this trip to Ziwei Palace was to pinpoint the fruit's location and find a way to break the restrictions.</p><p>After breaking through to Core Formation, with three hundred extra years of lifespan, she could wait for the next opening of Ziwei Palace. They could plan thoroughly, prepare adequately, and then seize the opportunity with a much higher chance of success.</p><p>But who knew when Ziwei Palace would open again?</p><p>The opening times were unpredictable, closely linked to the spiritual tides of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  It could be as short as a hundred years or as long as over three hundred.  Such a long wait meant she'd have to endure her damaged foundation throughout her entire Core Formation stage.</p><p>Of course, if she could break through to Core Formation before the next opening of Ziwei Palace, everything would change.  With herself, two magic treasures, and the Flying Night Rakshasa, she would at least have a fighting chance.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the cave dwelling's ceiling, slowly exhaling. She then calmed her racing thoughts, preventing distractions from hindering her Core Formation breakthrough.</p><p>Thanks to the spiritual spring, the cave dwelling had exceptionally rich spiritual energy, sufficient even for a Core Formation cultivator like Qin Sang.  There was no need for a Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the restrictions on the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, placed a meditation cushion beside the jade pool, and began her meditation.</p><p>Over the past few years, whenever she had the chance to return to her sect, Qin Sang would visit Baota Peak, meticulously studying all the relevant texts on Core Formation.</p><p>She wouldn't miss an opportunity to seek guidance from Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>Unfortunately, she wasn't always granted an audience with Qi Yuanshou, meeting him only twice in recent years.</p><p>From Qi Yuanshou's disciple, Gao Yang, she learned that Qi Yuanshou also seemed to be preparing to enter Ziwei Palace and had become less involved in sect affairs recently.</p><p>Qin Sang had made ample preparations for her Core Formation breakthrough. After breaking through to the False Core realm, there was no need to return to the sect; she could directly begin her seclusion.</p><p>After breaking through the False Core realm, Qin Sang traveled extensively and fought a fierce battle with the Hooded Robe Daoist, greatly consolidating her cultivation.</p><p>After three months of secluded cultivation, Qin Sang awoke from her meditative state.</p><p>She inspected her inner body.</p><p>Her dantian was full, her spiritual energy calm and tranquil.</p><p>Her spirits were high, her divine sense powerful.</p><p>The False Core realm represented the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment; reaching this stage, there was nowhere left to go, only Core Formation.</p><p>And indeed, that was the case.</p><p>After breaking through the False Core stage, Qin Sang, despite his best efforts, found his cultivation stagnated. He was firmly stuck at a bottleneck, once again experiencing the frustration of being held back.  A Spirit Root cultivator would easily forge a Golden Core by now, a fact that filled Qin Sang with envy.</p><p>For three months, he meticulously refined the spiritual energy in his Qi Sea, calming every restless thought.  When he awoke, his gaze swept dispassionately across his cave dwelling before settling on his dantian for a long moment. Then he closed his eyes again.</p><p>He meticulously reviewed the classics from the Baota Peak in his mind, repeatedly pondering the words of Qi Yuan Shou, regardless of their immediate usefulness.  </p><p>Then, Qin Sang began his attempt at Golden Core formation. He didn't opt for the assistance of any supplementary spiritual items, instead striving to achieve it through his own strength.  While success would be ideal, Qin Sang knew the chances were virtually nil. His aim was to gain experience and integrate his knowledge. This might improve his chances when he eventually refined spiritual items.  </p><p>He currently possessed only the Kanli Golden Core Pill, the Snow Spirit Lotus, and the Iris Flower –  he needed to proceed cautiously.</p><p>Deep beneath the Great Marsh's waters, in the muddy depths, inside a lightless cave, time became meaningless.  Qin Sang sat motionless like a withered pine, his aura undisturbed. For months, it seemed nothing changed.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang stirred slightly, awakening from his meditative state.  As expected, despite his ceaseless cultivation, he felt no sign of spiritual energy condensing. He had to accept reality:  with his talent, attempting Golden Core formation through his own abilities was a fool's errand.  It was impossible; he hadn't gained a single ounce of experience.  Months wasted, with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and his resolve remained unshaken.  He felt no disappointment, accepting the outcome calmly.</p><p>It seemed he had to try the Kanli Golden Core Pill.</p><p>Instead of immediately resuming meditation, Qin Sang rose, quietly leaving the cave to return to the small island.  Finding no message from Yun Youzi, he went back to his cave.  He and Yun Youzi had agreed that if the Ziwei Palace unexpectedly opened, a sound transmission would be left on the island. In that event, regardless of his Golden Core attempt, Qin Sang would put everything aside and enter the Ziwei Palace first.</p>
