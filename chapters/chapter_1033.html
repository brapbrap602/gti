<h1>Chapter 1025: The Girl</h1><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain, unexpectedly discovering a sheer cliff ahead.</p><p>The path was blocked!</p><p>A sheer cliff wouldn't stop a cultivator. Qin Sang could easily fly over it using his sword, but reason told him not to be so impulsive.</p><p>Deep within the fog, shadowy mountain peaks loomed, seeming real and unreal at the same time.  They appeared to be mountain ranges, but might not be real.  A reckless action could lead him into the trap of the Thousand Mountains Array and into real danger.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly danced around Qin Sang, using its abilities to observe its surroundings, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang decided to retreat.</p><p>He descended the mountain by the same route, slaying several ferocious beasts before returning to the foot of the mountain. Turning his head towards another real mountain peak, he immediately started walking towards it.</p><p>Along the way, ferocious beasts frequently appeared, similar to his experience on the previous mountain.</p><p>Reaching the summit, the same scene repeated itself.</p><p>The path was blocked.</p><p>After leaving the valley, the path split into three, two real and one illusory, all dead ends.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow, surveying his surroundings and recalling his journey, revealing a thoughtful expression.</p><p>It seemed that to get through, he needed to find the real way out among the three mountains.</p><p>Those skilled in illusion arrays would have an easier time, as a damaged array would never be perfect.  With some effort and careful analysis, they should be able to find a way out or a weakness in the array, greatly reducing the danger.</p><p>Cultivators unfamiliar with illusion arrays and lacking countermeasures would probably have to force their way through.</p><p>Even if they were extremely strong and fearless of the traps within the array, their progress would be slow, wasting a lot of time and energy at this stage.</p><p>"Ferocious beasts appearing and disappearing without warning, the real and unreal shifting within the array… is the third mountain peak definitely an illusion?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself.</p><p>He returned to the foot of the mountain once more.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang noticed other changes in the illusion array.  The beasts created by the array were slightly stronger than before, indicating that the longer one stayed within the array, the stronger the opponents became.</p><p>He quickened his pace and reached the foot of the third mountain.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly saw that this mountain was an illusion, and upon closer inspection, they confirmed that there was reality within the illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before reaching a cliff face and stepped forward.</p><p>A gust of wind blew past his ears, the fog remained, but the surrounding scenery had changed. A rustling sound echoed, and Qin Sang looked around to find himself in a dense forest, surrounded by tall ancient trees.</p><p>The forest was dark and humid, and the distant roars of ferocious beasts echoed.</p><p>This time, there was no path to guide him.</p><p>Finding a way out was up to him.</p><p>Using the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities to observe for a while, Qin Sang chose a direction to set off, changing course several times along the way, finally succeeding in finding a path hidden within the illusion.</p><p>"With the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, navigating the Thousand Mountains Array is far easier than for others."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy.</p><p>He immediately quickened his pace without hesitation.</p><p>The illusion array was not static. Some places were free from beast attacks, but would contain many strange traps and mechanisms.</p><p>However, with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and his own considerable strength, the array's various defenses caused him little trouble, and his journey was surprisingly smooth.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang gradually understood some of the array's patterns.</p><p>After all, for the sake of the Eighteen Devil Banners, he had once devoted himself to studying the Yuan Shen Sect's "Taixuan Array Fragments" for a period of time, and he also had a certain understanding of array formations.</p><p>Even without the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang could calculate the way out, but it would take much longer.</p><p>After passing through countless mountains and ravines,</p><p>Qin Sang appeared on a solitary peak, frowning at what lay ahead, murmuring: "I wonder how much longer it will take to pass through the Thousand Mountains Array.  Getting here, the array's power is increasing, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly is also finding it difficult. Sometimes it needs to observe for a while to determine the real from the fake. It seems I can't just stand idly by; I should try to calculate the array, to lend the Sky-Eyed Butterfly a hand…"</p><p>Distant roars of beasts echoed.</p><p>This was a common occurrence in the Thousand Mountains Array, but Qin Sang seemed to sense something, his gaze hardening as he stared in the direction of the roars, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>"It seems someone is fighting beasts there?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Someone had reached this point even faster than him.</p><p>"The East Pole League disciples can pinpoint Su Nu's location; other factions probably have similar methods.  These are all top cultivators of their generation. Working together is indeed easier than fighting alone. It seems I can't be complacent."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, retracting his gaze and heading down the mountain.</p><p>Deep in the forest,</p><p>A young girl was fighting a fox-like beast.</p><p>Except this fox was the size of a calf, with sharp fangs, and extremely vicious.</p><p>The girl was nimble, flitting about like a colourful butterfly, waving her sleeves, leaving light, floating clouds in the air. The clouds, light as air, circled the girl and the beast, seemingly harmless.</p><p>The beast, oblivious to danger, continued its ferocious attack on the girl.</p><p>Two more wisps of cloud emerged from her sleeves.</p><p>They were enveloped in a cloud of mist.</p><p>The girl sprang back, leaping away from the beast.</p><p>At the same time, her lips parted slightly as she crisply commanded, "Bind!"</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Before the sound died away, the clouds transformed.  No longer light and airy, they solidified into white threads, fiercely wrapping around the beast.</p><p>In an instant, the beast was bound like a dumpling.</p><p>The girl's hand seals changed rapidly.  A series of bone-cracking sounds echoed from within the cloud, followed by a spray of blood.</p><p>Once the girl dispelled the clouds, the beast lay dead.</p><p>After killing the beast, the girl caught her breath, her face devoid of any joy.</p><p>"My calculations are failing more and more often.  I haven't found a way out; instead, I've stumbled into a trap.  I've even encountered such a powerful beast.  Who knows what else awaits?  At this rate, I'll miss my chance..."</p><p>She sighed softly, gently stroking the life amulet her grandfather had given her, her expression anxious.</p><p>Suddenly, the girl's ears twitched. She looked sharply towards the depths of the mountain forest, clutching the amulet.  With a flash, she moved silently to the canopy of a nearby tree, holding her breath.</p><p>"Someone?"</p><p>Her expression was grave.</p><p>The thick fog obscured her vision, but she detected something unusual in the beast's roars.</p><p>She realized the commotion from killing the beast had been considerable and might have exposed her.</p><p>Thinking this, she immediately moved away, deliberately increasing the distance between herself and the other party.</p><p>But she quickly discovered that the other person wasn't pursuing her.  Instead, they were heading in another direction at incredible speed, hardly pausing at all.</p><p>The girl was secretly amazed.</p><p>The other person's actions were strange, as if they weren't making any calculations at all.</p><p>Unless they were a brute, they likely possessed a deep understanding of the Thousand Mountain Array, able to instantly discern the illusion from reality.</p><p>But who would reach this point and still be a brute?</p><p>"Could they really be that powerful?"</p><p>Doubt clouded her mind.  Then, she noticed the commotion suddenly ceased.</p>
