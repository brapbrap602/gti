<h1>Chapter 1993: Golden City</h1><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.  She thought, *Senior Yue is so interested in the Wu tribe's alchemical formulas. Could it be that she cultivates using Wu tribe techniques?*</p><p>"This formula was passed down to me long ago by an elder," Qin Sang replied, subtly observing Senior Yue.</p><p>"That elder... is...?"</p><p>Senior Yue pressed, her eyes dimming slightly when Qin Sang shook her head.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't offer further explanation, instead asking, "Does this formula hold some significance for you, Daoist friend?"</p><p>Senior Yue quickly composed herself, sighing softly, "To claim a connection would not be inaccurate.  You must see that the heritage contained within this formula is quite unique. In the alchemic arts, the combination of herbs reflects an interpretation of the Dao. Different sects and lineages form different schools, and the methods of refinement in this formula are different from ours."</p><p>"You're referring to the Wu tribe, aren't you?" Qin Sang stated directly.</p><p>"So the Daoist knows of the Wu tribe!"</p><p>Senior Yue showed no surprise. "To be honest, Daoist, my initial teacher knew nothing of alchemy. I only embarked on this path after unexpectedly discovering an ancient text in the ruins of a senior cultivator.  This text detailed a branch of Wu tribe alchemic techniques.  It was then that I learned of the Wu tribe's existence, separate from humans and demons. Apparently, some legends are true."</p><p>Listening to Senior Yue, Qin Sang calmly asked, "What legends?"</p><p>"Legends say the Wu tribe once dominated the Great Thousand World. After the rise of humanity, Wu tribe members were driven into the wilds by human ancestors, and have since declined.  Even overseas, there are traces left by the Wu tribe, indicating a certain truth to these stories."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang fell into thought.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Senior Yue continued.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I only possess that single text. I've searched for many years but haven't found any other Wu tribe ruins. Perhaps they've been lost to time, or perhaps they were moved elsewhere."</p><p>"That single text wasn't enough to sustain my progress.  Luckily, I found some human alchemic texts and joined my current sect. However, my heart remains fixed on the Wu tribe's alchemic arts."</p><p>"It's not just sentimentality. The different lineages help me cross-reference and greatly improve my own cultivation."</p><p>"Therefore, seeing the formula for the Azure Yuan Frost Flower Elixir, I was overjoyed. I thought it meant another Wu tribe site had been discovered, and I eagerly sought the formula's owner."</p><p>Senior Yue, having only met Qin Sang once, revealed her entire cultivation journey. This clearly indicated a motive. She looked at Qin Sang expectantly, thinking, *Since it was a gift from a senior, there must be more than just one formula, right?*</p><p>Qin Sang saw through her intentions.  More formulas did exist.</p><p>The *Pan Hu Zhenjing* was a complete legacy, detailing various pills used to cultivate one's soul-bound insect-gu. The section covering the first five transformations, equivalent to the Nascent Soul stage, was especially thorough and rich. However, many formulas lacked necessary herbs, needed bizarre refinement methods, or even required Wu tribe bloodline, making them difficult to produce. Qin Sang could only select a few.</p><p>Beyond the fifth transformation, equivalent to a human cultivator's Void Refinement stage, the content drastically reduced, with only a handful of formulas, and the refining difficulties became astronomically high.</p><p>At the seventh transformation, there were no clear formulas at all.</p><p>However, the core method of the *Pan Hu Zhenjing*, the *Soul Nourishment Method*, wasn't limited by realm. The Ghost Mother had said that this method was a true Wu tribe secret, usable to cultivate soul-bound insect-gu for as long as the master's cultivation was high enough, even without auxiliary pills.</p><p>Qin Sang understood it wasn't necessarily the Ghost Mother withholding knowledge. A seventh transformation insect-gu was equivalent to a human cultivator at the Unity stage - exceptionally rare, and incredibly difficult to cultivate.</p><p>Moreover, there were countless insect-gu species.  The higher the realm, the greater the difference in cultivation experience, abilities and racial traits.  It was almost impossible to create a universally applicable formula.</p><p>At this level, the insect-gu and master had to explore and pursue the Dao together.</p><p>Of course, if given the chance, Qin Sang would visit the Ghost Mother to see how Liu Ying and Fei Can were doing. The Ghost Mother had also promised to help find a way to cultivate the Sky Eye Butterfly into a seventh-transformation Void Butterfly.  Once a seemingly unattainable goal, Qin Sang no longer considered it a mere fantasy.</p><p>"Have you ever considered leaving to search for Wu tribe inheritances elsewhere?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"The Deep Jade Sea, the Extreme Sky Peak... I've been to both," Senior Yue softly shook her head. Clearly, she hadn't found anything.</p><p>"What about Da Zhou?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Master Yue's expression flickered.  "North of Jitian Peak, the sea becomes increasingly perilous.  Not only are there roaming demons, but also various unidentified and extremely dangerous creatures, and mysterious, treacherous sea areas.  Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could perish with a moment's carelessness."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  No wonder the geographical records became increasingly vague and unreliable further north.</p><p>Between this region and Genzhou Province of Da Zhou, there were so many dangers.  For cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage, it was an insurmountable obstacle; even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't risk it lightly.</p><p>"Safe passage charts are all held by top-tier factions. They pay a hefty price for exploration, considering them invaluable and never revealing them easily. Besides, the path ahead is unknown.  We bear the heavy responsibilities of our sects; our rise and fall rests on a single person. How dare we travel far?  I hope my disciples will soon mature, so I can lay down my burden and travel the vast world." Master Yue sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang deeply empathized with Master Yue's lament.</p><p>He had founded the Qingyang Temple three times, always striving to be a hands-off manager.  Every time he left, he did everything possible to pave the way for Qingyang Temple, making careful arrangements and anticipating threats before he could rest easy.</p><p>What more for others?</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators cultivate for thousands of years, unknowingly entangled in countless karmic bonds. These karmic bonds are their attachments.</p><p>Among them, the debt of gratitude to one's master is the greatest.</p><p>Having received the grace of their sect, they must bear its karmic consequences.  With the high expectations of their masters above and dependent disciples below, their relationships are deep and the lineage is orderly. Unless they are cold-hearted, how many can remain unmoved?</p><p>However, Qin Sang keenly sensed a different meaning in Master Yue's words and pressed, "Master, does this mean there's a way to traverse the vast ocean and safely reach Da Zhou?"</p><p>As fellow human beings, Da Zhou must have contact with this place, and might even have a grand teleportation array.  The Jitian Sect is highly likely to know about it.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to use the Jitian Sect as a breakthrough, constantly considering how to impress them.</p><p>A few days ago, introduced by Gu Yun Sou, Qin Sang personally visited Elder Yi of the Jitian Sect.</p><p>Their initial meeting was brief; they hadn't had an in-depth discussion.</p><p>Being too hasty might alert the Jitian Sect, leading them to discover the altar array, which would be difficult to explain.</p><p>Master Yue's beautiful eyes lingered on Qin Sang's face. After a moment's hesitation, she nodded. "The path of alchemy is arduous, and alchemists are easily targeted.  Top-tier alchemists in various places have private connections. To my knowledge, a fellow cultivator has befriended a powerful force in Genzhou Province of Da Zhou. That faction has vast power, capable of navigating the sea, occasionally bringing rare and precious spirit herbs from Da Zhou here… That faction seems to be called Canjin City."</p><p>Canjin City!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Qing Yuan had mentioned several factions involved in trade during his lifetime, and Canjin City was one of them.</p><p>Furthermore, Qing Yuan particularly mentioned Canjin City, highlighting its largest and most well-known presence in Genzhou and emphasizing its excellent reputation.</p><p>In short, finding a Canjin City official would mean being close to Genzhou.</p><p>Canjin City had indeed extended its influence here, yet remained extremely low-key and unknown, whether due to some suppression or other reasons.</p><p>The fact that Master Yue mentioned Canjin City suggested her reliability.</p><p>If Qin Sang could contact Canjin City through Master Yue, he wouldn't need to go to the trouble of begging the Jitian Sect.</p><p>Canjin City, Genzhou's capital, and Yujing Mountain – if things went smoothly, he could reach the human race's sacred land through this route and experience the splendor of the human race in the vast world.</p><p>He happened to have what Master Yue wanted; they could each get what they needed…</p><p>Qin Sang said, "To be frank, though my cultivation is lacking, I do have the desire to travel the vast world."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Master Yue pondered for a moment, then nodded.  "I can contact that fellow cultivator, but I can't guarantee their agreement."  Knowing Qin Sang's request, Master Yue became more reserved.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind, smiling slightly.  "My senior left this item to help me cultivate a certain magical power.  Additionally, there are several other pills and Biyuan Frost Flower Elixir that complement each other. I can offer them to discuss with you."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"Absolutely!"</p><p>Master Yue, being impulsive, immediately stood up. "I'll contact that fellow cultivator right away. However, I cannot guarantee absolute safety on the journey, nor Canjin City's remuneration…"</p><p>"I'll take care of myself!  My life and death are unrelated to you!" Qin Sang firmly declared.</p><p>"Good!  As soon as I have news, I'll inform you immediately, and deliver the Biyuan Frost Flower Elixir as well."</p><p>Qin Sang saw Master Yue out of the treasure garden. "After the Dharma assembly, you can find me in Yun Du City."</p><p>Master Yue nodded, about to turn away, when she remembered something.  She pinched her fingers and calculated.  "It seems you won't make it this time. The next Canjin City trip is estimated to be several decades from now."</p><p>Several decades for a round trip?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  His breakthrough and refining would take time, so he said, "A hundred years is but a blink of an eye; waiting won't hurt."</p><p>…</p><p>After meeting Master Yue, Qin Sang became less concerned about the Jitian Sect.</p><p>Of course, the proper courtesies were observed.</p><p>At the subsequent Dharma Assembly, including Elder Yi of the Ji Tian Sect, Qin Sang met several Nascent Soul cultivators.  Among them were Supreme Elder Li Chengzi of Yonggu Mountain and Elder Fang of the Yan Xiang Hall, Ji Tian Sect.  The three discussed the Dao of Artifact Refinement, greatly benefiting Qin Sang, and clarifying his plans for the Mingshan Armor and other treasures.</p><p>The Ji Tian Dharma Assembly gradually drew to a close. The final month was the highlight, the acquisition of a Minor Grotto-Heaven being the ultimate goal.</p><p>The Ji Tian Sect, while powerful, also suffered from the drawbacks of a large organization: internal factions were rife.  Gu Yun Sou was exceptionally busy, striving to forge alliances.</p><p>Through Sect Master Yu, they finally learned some information about the Minor Grotto-Heaven. It was a fragmented Lesser Thousand World, uninhabited but producing spirit materials.  After discovering it, the Ji Tian Sect hadn't completely plundered it, preserving some of its value.</p><p>Of all the rewards, the Minor Grotto-Heaven was the most attractive; while the other rewards were also valuable, none compared to it.</p><p>There was news favorable to them.  No news had yet emerged about which faction obtained the Panlong Heavenly Pillar; their chances were very high.</p><p>As the Assembly neared its end, Qin Sang was meditating in the Brown Peak Treasure Garden, sketching the energy pathways of the Mingshan Armor in his mind, awaiting news from Gu Yun Sou.</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed his cave dwelling being disturbed.  He found a sound transmission talisman trapped by a restriction; he drew it into his hand. It contained a message from Zhen Laomo.</p><p>Zhen Laomo had returned, but instead of entering the city, he invited Qin Sang to meet outside the city walls.</p><p>Qin Sang found this strange. After sending a message to Gu Yun Sou to inform him, he left the city. On a barren mountain north of the Ji Tian Sect, he found Zhen Laomo seated on a rock.</p><p>Qin Sang looked Zhen Laomo up and down, his eyes flashing with surprise. "Friend Daoist, are you injured?"</p><p>No wonder he'd chosen to meet outside the city; Zhen Laomo clearly didn't want others to know of his weakness.</p><p>"You wouldn't break your word, would you?" Zhen Laomo's voice was hoarse.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed. Qin Sang immediately produced a jade disc.  This disc, half black and half white, was ancient and imposing, engraved with the "Life and Death Reversal" secret technique; it looked exactly like the one used when casting the spell.  The jade's aura was very difficult to replicate.</p><p>Seeing the jade disc, Zhen Laomo's eyes shone brightly. He exclaimed, "Zhen is not unworthy of his trust!"</p><p>He then produced a jade slip, gesturing for Qin Sang to use his divine sense to examine it.</p><p>As Qin Sang's divine sense touched the jade slip, he immediately saw half of a scripture; the characters flowed into his heart, incredibly profound—the celestial array of the Star Dao, the "Celestial River Reverse Killing Array"! The other half was concealed by Zhen Laomo.</p><p>"What a marvelous array!" Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>"Haha, this array can be used as a protective sect array; Daoist, you're definitely not at a loss," Zhen Laomo said intently, staring at Qin Sang.  He was injured and not Qin Sang's match, but he wouldn't be easily controlled either. If Qin Sang had ulterior motives, a fight between them would attract the Ji Tian Sect's experts.</p><p>"Here you go!" Qin Sang flicked the jade disc towards Zhen Laomo.</p><p>Zhen Laomo caught it, uttered a hearty acknowledgement, and threw the jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>Confirming it was the complete Celestial River Reverse Killing Array, Qin Sang rejoiced, thanked him, and was about to return to the city when Zhen Laomo stopped him.</p><p>"Daoist, wait!"</p><p>Zhen Laomo produced several items from a pouch; they were damaged, yet emanated a starlight-like radiance.</p><p>"What are these?" Qin Sang was captivated by the objects.</p><p>"These are fragments of the array's components.  If Daoist refines the Celestial River Reverse Killing Array based on them, it will be twice the result for half the effort!  Should be enough to match the value of the Annihilation Soul Lamp, wouldn't you say?" Zhen Laomo said.</p><p>A damaged array and a spirit treasure missing a crucial part of its scripture seemed fairly equivalent.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang shook his head. "Not enough!"</p><p>Zhen Laomo frowned. He had paid a great price for this, and considering future medicinal expenses for his injuries, he'd practically gambled everything on this secret technique.</p><p>"However," Qin Sang's tone changed as he flung the Annihilation Soul Lamp towards Zhen Laomo, "Friend Daoist kept his word, and I'm not a bullying person. In the future, if disciples of the Green Sheep Temple cause any offense while traveling, I hope you will be lenient."</p><p>Zhen Laomo was startled, his lips moving slightly.  "This old man doesn't like hypocrisy, but I have some influence within the Demon Sect. Whoever dares to harm your disciples without cause, Wanluo Island won't stand for it!"</p>
