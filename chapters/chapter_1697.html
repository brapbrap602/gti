<h1>Chapter 1688 A Wisp of Enchanting Fragrance</h1><p>Mo Xingdao was deathly silent. As soon as the Azure Fox Saint King spoke, he recalled the incident at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>That day, disguised, he had discerned the secret of the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal and planned to trade his Thousand-Knot Divine Net for it with Qin Sang.  Wary of the Jade Shadow Sect's Grand Elder, they agreed to trade outside.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang was ambushed by Demon Kings.</p><p>He had initially intended to help, fostering goodwill to persuade Qin Sang more easily. However, upon witnessing Qin Sang's power, he suspected that Qin Sang might be the Fire Devil Su Zinan was searching for, and changed his mind.</p><p>Although he was affiliated with Su Zinan, he had no intention of risking his life for him, much less making a deadly enemy for Su Zinan's sake. He decided to remain hidden.</p><p>Only when he saw an opportunity did Mo Xingdao act, deliberately using an obscure Daoist technique.</p><p>The Greenfur Rat Demon abandoned his two subordinates and fled.</p><p>Of the two Crocodile Demons, one died, and the other was captured alive.</p><p>Finally, they used a Soul Searching technique on the captured demon, retrieving fragmented memories. This demon held a significant position among the East Sea demon race, but his memories contained nothing related to the Saint King's disciples!</p><p>Mo Xingdao glanced at the Azure Fox Saint King. Whether or not the Crocodile Demons were truly the Saint King's disciples was irrelevant.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King had publicly declared it, and in front of so many witnesses, false could become true.</p><p>Upon closer examination, Mo Xingdao was also an accomplice.</p><p>He would never be foolish enough to argue on Qin Sang's behalf. He would bury this matter forever, never mentioning it to anyone.</p><p>Of those present, only Sage Huiguang could stop the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>Thinking of this, Mo Xingdao looked towards Sage Huiguang, only to see the Demon Sealing Stake, wreathed in heartfire, now tinged with blood.  Sage Huiguang was using a blood refinement technique to repair the treasure and could not be distracted.</p><p>Within the mountains.</p><p>Hearing the Azure Fox Saint King's shout, Qin Sang also knew there was no room for maneuver.</p><p>He had personally searched the Crocodile Demons' souls and knew the truth. The probability of them being Nascent Soul disciples was slim, but what did it matter?</p><p>Even if he had been ambushed first and forced to retaliate.</p><p>He had no chance to defend himself.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King acted decisively, striking to kill, and sealing off Emperor Bestowal Mountain, deliberately masking the connection between him and his avatar.</p><p>Rebuttals were useless.  Just as the Ghost Mother had once said—"What I want, I simply take."</p><p>A Nascent Soul Demon King certainly possessed the power and confidence to do so.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Saint King's pressure formed a tangible storm, and the converging golden clouds seemed to solidify.</p><p>Three Azure Fox Saint Kings stepped into the sword formation simultaneously.</p><p>Identical in their peerless beauty and enchanting allure, their expressions displayed three distinct charms, making it impossible to distinguish the true from the illusory.</p><p>His avatar dragged Qin Sang's true body down, trapped within Su Zinan's Star Sword Formation. The avatar's true essence was also running low.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body was in an even worse state.  He focused on regulating his chaotic vital energy, looking up in horror, his gaze meeting the three illusory bodies of the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>“I just offered a powerful demon-subduing treasure, turning the tide of the battle, and you intend to burn the bridge after crossing it?  Are you not afraid of being condemned by the world?!” Qin Sang channeled his true essence, roaring in unison with his avatar.</p><p>“Cease your resistance and confess what happened that day. Considering your contribution, I will only punish the main culprit.  I advise you to sever ties with this villain immediately. Do not mislead yourself.”</p><p>Everyone knew the Azure Fox Saint King's words were directed at the avatar, unaware that the avatar and Qin Sang were one.</p><p>Calling a deer a horse was no different.</p><p>Despite her words, the Azure Fox Saint King showed no mercy.</p><p>The eyes of the three illusory bodies were pure white, without pupils.  Their gazes held no killing intent, only a chilling indifference.</p><p>Like looking at an ant.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The three illusory bodies shot towards Qin Sang, looking down at him.  They simultaneously raised their right hands, their skin like snow and jade, extending slender fingers towards him.</p><p>Faint azure light gathered at their fingertips, illuminating their already translucent bodies, making them appear like sculpted jade.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The azure light was like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, a sharp pain erupting in his forehead.  Without hesitation, he urged the barely gathered vital energy in his body, pouring it frantically into the Mani Pearl.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Black flames surged from Qin Sang, tinged with faint golden light, instantly shielding his entire body.</p><p>The moment the罡fire shield formed, the azure lightning struck.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Three waves of fire erupted on the罡fire shield, azure light and firelight clashing and exploding, the residual force creating a vast spectacle that engulfed Qin Sang.</p><p>Amidst the thunderous roar, the罡fire shield trembled, enduring a terrifying impact.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the罡fire shield proved incredibly resilient.  Under the combined attack of the three illusory bodies, it did not shatter, the azure lightning held at bay.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew the immense pressure he was under.  Inside the罡fire shield, his body trembled as he struggled to maintain it. His newly recovered true essence was rapidly depleting, but the good news was that it lessened the burden on his meridians.</p><p>Seeing their attack fail, the three illusory bodies' eyes flashed with cold light.  The three bolts of azure lightning suddenly converged, without any ripple or sound.</p><p>In an instant, the three bolts merged into one, transforming into a drop of Azure Jade Liquid, faint azure lightning flickering within, traces of their fusion visible.</p><p>Completely merged, it became a flawless jade seal.</p><p>The jade seal was small, no bigger than a baby's fist, with alternating flashes of azure and white light within.  A rich azure-white spiritual light emanated, forming halos around the seal.</p><p>The white light was like clouds and mist, filled with illusions, while the azure light constantly shifted into various fox forms, chasing and playing amongst the clouds, a scene of immortal mountain splendor.</p><p>This was not mere spiritual light but a manifestation of the jade seal's power, firmly locking onto Qin Sang, pressing down with terrifying pressure!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, his body stiffening, his blood congealing, as if crushed beneath a celestial mountain. His vision was filled with only azure and white light.</p><p>At the same time, the Azure Fox Saint King's laughter reached Qin Sang's ears, clear as a bell, captivating and alluring.</p><p>"Quite a collection of treasures you have..."</p><p>The voice descended along with the jade seal.</p><p>The bodies of the three illusory forms gradually became transparent.</p><p>Clearly, this was their full-powered strike.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The jade seal descended with the force of a thunderbolt!</p><p>A jade seal appeared on the surface of the罡fire shield, embedding itself deeply within.  Azure and white light filled the sky, suppressing the raging demonic flames.</p><p>It was like a giant boulder smashing into a lake.</p><p>Centered around the jade seal, the demonic flames surged like waves, a 'creaking' sound coming from the罡fire shield. In an instant, the area directly impacted was reduced to a thin layer.</p><p>Infused with the Fire Lotus, the Mani Pearl's defensive capabilities were unparalleled, rarely breached by even powerful cultivators.</p><p>Now, sensing the danger of the罡fire shield shattering, Qin Sang was horrified. He hurriedly focused his mind within the Mani Pearl, touching the origin of the demonic fire.</p><p>He drew upon as much of the demonic fire's origin as he could control, channeling it into the罡fire shield.  Although he couldn't fully master this power, he could use the Mani Pearl to guide it, strengthening the shield.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell that the Azure Fox Saint King's three illusory bodies were not like his own avatar, but manifestations of her divine abilities and power, unsustainable for long.  If he could withstand this attack, he would have a chance to escape.</p><p>Using the Sun God Tree again was a consideration, but there was no opportunity.  The Azure Fox Saint King would be prepared, making it difficult to succeed.</p><p>The origin of the demonic fire, once unleashed, was truly extraordinary.</p><p>Like rich ink spreading within the shield, the wavering罡fire shield stabilized, resisting the jade seal.</p><p>Correspondingly, Qin Sang's true essence depleted at a terrifying rate.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The peak of Emperor Bestowal Mountain tilted, threatening to break in half.</p><p>The summit was almost submerged by the five-colored clouds, no longer distinct but interwoven, creating a bizarrely beautiful scene.  Beneath this beauty, the Five Elements Divine Prohibition was on the verge of complete destruction.</p><p>Such a spectacle still couldn't mask the fluctuations from the clash between the jade seal and the罡fire shield.</p><p>The crack in the clouds remained open, three shadowy figures flickering within. Judging by the fluctuations, they had yet to subdue their target.</p><p>The onlookers were stunned.</p><p>That person was clearly heavily injured, his robes stained with blood, his true essence in chaos.</p><p>A Nascent Soul expert attacking with three powerful illusory bodies, and that person could still resist?</p><p>Cultivators who prided themselves on their vast knowledge and connections racked their brains, unable to recall the person's origins.  They searched through every major sect, but found no match.</p><p>Just who was this person?</p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p>The three illusory bodies became more ethereal, almost like shadows. Similarly, Qin Sang felt that familiar emptiness again, though less severe than before.</p><p>His face pale, he maintained his upward gaze, staring intently at the three illusory bodies. His eyes flickered, his mind merging with his avatar, about to act.</p><p>Suddenly, one of the Azure Fox Saint King's illusory bodies blinked.</p><p>With that blink, her demeanor transformed.  The white eyes returned to normal, beautiful and captivating, like pools of water, drawing one in irresistibly.</p><p>Apart from the eyes, her features remained unchanged, yet this mesmerizing gaze brought her to life, making her seem like a different person!</p><p>The illusory body seemed to see through the罡fire shield, perceiving his weakened state. A slight smile curved her lips, a breathtakingly beautiful sight.</p><p>Qin Sang heard a soft chuckle.</p><p>Still like silver bells, but not as distant, right beside his ear, close at hand!</p><p>In the sky.</p><p>Since the Azure Fox Saint King attacked Qin Sang, Old Demon Fan and the others hesitated to speak.</p><p>They had all heard of the demon chaos at Six Continents Hall, each harboring different thoughts, but none intended to intervene on Qin Sang's behalf.  Instead, they worried that distractions would affect the Azure Fox Saint King, giving the Ancient Devil an advantage and jeopardizing their success.</p><p>However, the Azure Fox Saint King only deployed three illusory bodies, her true body remaining focused, her judgment and reactions as sharp as before.</p><p>While Qin Sang defended against the illusory bodies, the battle here continued unabated.</p><p>They surrounded the Azure Fox Saint King, sometimes converging, sometimes dispersing, their formation fluid yet organized.</p><p>"Scatter!"</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's command reached their ears.</p><p>After some coordination, Old Demon Fan and the others understood this command. The Demonic Claw was about to unleash its power, and they must avoid a direct confrontation, scattering without hesitation.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Demonic Claw split into thousands, filling the sky.</p><p>Thuds echoed from Old Demon Fan and the others. Despite their swift reactions, some claws couldn't be dodged. They activated various defensive treasures to withstand the assault.</p><p>Before the claws dissipated, another command came: "Combine!"</p><p>This was the order for a joint counterattack.  Although battered, they still had opportunities to strike back.  Exploiting the moment between the Demonic Claw's attacks, they could launch an offensive, hoping to disrupt its rhythm and gain precious time.</p><p>Such opportunities were rare.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's commands were absolute.  Without time to think, they all unleashed their magical treasures, their formation shifting into an offensive stance.</p><p>Beams of spiritual light shot from them, converging above the suspended lake into a single stream of light, plunging towards the Demonic Claw within!</p><p>Simultaneously, the bright moon intensified, moonlight pouring down like a waterfall, merging with the stream of light. The unprecedented power startled even Old Demon Fan and the others.</p><p>No one noticed.</p><p>At this moment, the Azure Fox Saint King's true body stiffened imperceptibly.</p><p>Within the mountains.</p><p>The illusory body with the transformed demeanor took a step forward.</p><p>The laughter Qin Sang heard grew louder, seeming to penetrate his eardrums, invade his Purple Mansion, and echo beside his nascent soul.  A faint fragrance reached his nostrils.</p><p>“Some kind of illusion technique…”</p><p>These words flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.</p><p>This was the Celestial Fox Charm Technique.  Ordinary individuals, once ensnared, would be instantly consumed by lust, their minds filled with illusions. Those with weaker wills would succumb to a sea of desire, becoming mindless puppets.</p><p>Even those with strong wills would be affected, their thoughts wavering.</p><p>Employed by a Nascent Soul Azure Fox Saint King, few in the world could resist it!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ancient Devil’s mind was chaotic, immune to charm techniques.</p><p>Clearly, the three illusory bodies were a probe, forcing Qin Sang to use his powerful spiritual fire, creating an opening for attack. Even if the fire wasn't unleashed, it would drain him further, worsening his condition.</p><p>Even a lion uses its full strength against a rabbit, let alone one of the world's most powerful cultivators.  The Azure Fox Saint King, her true body occupied by the Ancient Devil, could still calculate to this extent!</p><p>Now, with Qin Sang weakened, the arrival of her true form, even for an instant, would be enough.</p><p>The true killing blow was coming!</p><p>However, the Azure Fox Saint King couldn't have imagined someone completely immune to her charm.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang's body stiffened, his gaze unfocused, the power of the罡fire shield drastically weakening, as if about to dissipate.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's smile deepened, extending a jade hand. Spiritual light surged, forming an illusory fox claw that ripped through the air towards Qin Sang.  The claw's passage caused the void to tremble, its power surpassing the jade seal.</p><p>Victory seemed assured.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King’s smile suddenly faded, her brow furrowing with a strange unease.</p><p>The next moment, clarity returned to Qin Sang’s eyes, replaced by a fierce determination.</p><p>Vital energy roared within him.  Previously only minor meridians had ruptured, but now even his main meridians tore. He had already received another Boiling Snow Pill from his avatar and held it in his mouth as a precaution. He swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>One Boiling Snow Pill's impact was almost unbearable. Two in quick succession caused Qin Sang's entire body to convulse, his flesh tearing.</p><p>A blinding crimson fire erupted like a rising sun, illuminating the mountains of the Legacy Tomb.</p><p>This time, the cultivators would witness the spectacle of six birds taking flight.</p>
