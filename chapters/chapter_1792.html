<h1>Chapter 1783: The Source of Calamity</h1><p>Qin Sang was oblivious to the conversation between Zhan Gui Zhenren and the others.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren was standing at the edge of the cliff, waiting for Qin Sang to emerge, preparing to fly back to Sword Heart Island.</p><p>“How did it go?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren asked.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. “The Dao Court wants me to infiltrate the Ghost Fang Kingdom.”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren wasn't surprised in the least. He and Qin Sang had discussed this before, analyzing it as the most likely outcome.</p><p>The Dao Court had countless powerful cultivators. Tasks that were easy and not particularly dangerous could be handled by their own Immortal Officials.</p><p>Only a mission like this, infiltrating the Ghost Fang Kingdom, rife with uncertainty, would be entrusted to outsiders.</p><p>“They want me to investigate a certain Secret Realm, said to be near the manor of a Demon King. The details are unclear. Once I'm inside the Ghost Fang Kingdom, someone will contact me…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly summarized the contents of the decree.</p><p>There was nothing to hide, really. He wouldn't know the Secret Realm's exact location until he reached the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>This also implied that there were further variables at play.</p><p>“Near a manor?” Zhi Jian Zhenren furrowed his brow.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. This was precisely his concern.</p><p>The so-called manor was the residence of a prince in the Ghost Fang Kingdom, not comparable to a Demon King’s cave in the Storm Realm.</p><p>A prince of the Ghost Fang Kingdom, commonly referred to by Daoists as a Demon King, was equivalent to a Grand True Lord of the Dao Court, a Void Refinement stage cultivator!</p><p>He could emanate demonic Qi and disguise himself as a demon cultivator. It should, in theory, deceive demon cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>But who knew if he would cause a commotion in the Secret Realm? Although the decree stated that it was some distance from the manor, Qin Sang couldn't rule out the possibility of attracting the attention of the prince, a Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't had the opportunity to witness the divine abilities of a Void Refinement stage cultivator, nor did he want to test them with his own life.</p><p>Yet, this decree was considered relatively easier.</p><p>After hearing about Qin Sang’s exchange with Zhan Gui Zhenren, Zhi Jian Zhenren shook his head repeatedly. “Fellow Daoist, your luck is poor. Neither decree is easy to fulfill, both fraught with peril.”</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained optimistic. “Fortunately, I invited Fellow Daoist to accompany me, and Zhan Gui Zhenren offered some leeway.  The first decree was probably intended for a true Grotto Profound True Lord. If it were forced upon me, I could only accept my fate.”</p><p>The two exchanged a few more words, then Zhi Jian Zhenren asked him what he planned to do.</p><p>Qin Sang countered, “Has Fellow Daoist reached a decision?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren nodded. “Although one piece of information remains unconfirmed, it's almost certain.  True Lords You Huang and Gu Yun and I are making preparations. It shouldn't take much longer. I'll explain the details to Fellow Daoist…”</p><p>With that, Zhi Jian Zhenren looked around, then cast a soundproof barrier around them before slowly beginning his narration.</p><p>Seeing his solemnity, Qin Sang's curiosity was piqued, and he listened patiently.</p><p>A short while later, Zhi Jian Zhenren finished speaking and looked at Qin Sang. “What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren and the others were actually planning to venture deep into the Source of Calamity, and still intended to clash with the demon hordes of the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>“Capturing or killing a Demon Marquis would be enough to exchange for ascension qualifications?” Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>“Capturing alive is preferable. The Dao Court will surely reward us handsomely. Even if we divide it amongst ourselves, the Dao Court wouldn't be stingy with a decree. If capturing alive proves impossible, slaying a Demon Marquis is also a significant contribution. Even if Fellow Daoist's contribution alone isn't sufficient, we can allocate more to you. If Fellow Daoist feels uneasy, you can always return the favor later. We wandering cultivators should look out for each other. Neither True Lord is petty,” Zhi Jian Zhenren spoke with confidence, as if the Demon Marquises of the Ghost Fang Kingdom were easily dispatched.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The depths of the Source of Calamity were different from the Ghost Fang Kingdom.  The four of them working together, with the element of surprise, indeed had a good chance of success.</p><p>According to Zhi Jian Zhenren, the Dao Court had discovered that the demon hordes of the Ghost Fang Kingdom seemed to be plotting something within the Source of Calamity, with Demon Marquises sighted there.</p><p>To avoid alerting them, the Dao Court hadn't mobilized a large force.</p><p>The Grotto Profound True Lords of the Dao Court were often sect leaders or held important positions, making them difficult to mobilize.  Wandering cultivators from Mount Ju were the least conspicuous, which provided them with this opportunity.</p><p>But it was certain that the Dao Court would have other arrangements in place.</p><p>As long as they were patient enough and waited for the two sides to clash head-on, they would have a chance to exploit the chaos.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren smiled again. “If we manage to uncover the demons’ secrets, what’s a mere decree?  Perhaps we could even request guidance from a Grand True Lord in our cultivation.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred at these words.</p><p>Guidance from a Grand True Lord was an incredibly rare opportunity!</p><p>After receiving the Five Thunders Secret Art, he would focus solely on cultivation, and Void Refinement was no longer an unreachable goal.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't carried away.</p><p>The Demon Marquises of the Ghost Fang Kingdom would certainly be aware of the danger and would most likely travel in groups. Finding a lone opponent wouldn't be easy.</p><p>That was secondary. They could remain hidden and patiently wait for the right moment.</p><p>Qin Sang's concern was that something capable of attracting the Dao Court's attention couldn't be trivial. Were only a few Demon Marquises involved in the Ghost Fang Kingdom's scheme, or were Demon Kings also participating?</p><p>If a Demon King were to appear, Zhi Jian Zhenren's outwardly strong but inwardly weak sword strike might not be enough to deter them.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren sensed Qin Sang's worries and changed his tone. “Fellow Daoist, in your cultivation journey, have you ever witnessed a Grand True Lord of the Dao Court make a move? Have you ever heard of a Grand True Lord gracing Mount Ju with their presence?”</p><p>“Never,” Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Although he wasn't clear on the specific reasons, he had gleaned some information over the years. Unless engaged in battle with the Ghost Fang Kingdom, the Grand True Lords rarely left the Dual Courts of the Dao Court and rarely revealed themselves in the outside world.</p><p>“Because Grand True Lords rarely leave their altars!”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren glanced southwest. “Cultivating to the Five Talismans Dharma Position, they pursue unity with Heaven and Earth, drawing upon the world’s essence to nourish themselves, extending their lifespans to near-infinity.  With a flick of their wrist, they command the might of Heaven and Earth. But because of this, once a Grand True Lord leaves their altar too far, the Qi of their fusion with Heaven and Earth cannot be concealed.  With every move, wind and thunder accompany them, and extraordinary phenomena manifest.  The same is true for the Demon Kings of the Ghost Fang Kingdom.”</p><p>Pausing, Zhi Jian Zhenren pointed towards the Source of Calamity to the north.  “Therefore, it’s actually more convenient for us to act.  Fellow Daoist, imagine, a Grand True Lord entering the Source of Calamity would be like a beacon in the night, driving all ferocious beasts into a frenzy.  With such a commotion, we’d detect them long before they approach any Demon Kings.”</p><p>“Unity with Heaven and Earth…”</p><p>Qin Sang gained a new understanding.</p><p>Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators worried about their lifespans.</p><p>Upon reaching the Nascent Soul realm, they transcended the mundane, gaining access to various methods of replenishing their vital essence. Their lifespans became less predictable, varying based on their cultivation techniques, experiences, methods of preserving health, and the environment they inhabited.</p><p>There were even differences between Body Refiners, Dharma Cultivators, and Spirit Cultivators.</p><p>Generally, it was around fifteen hundred years, with variations of a few hundred years being possible. Divine Transformation cultivators could roughly double that.</p><p>However, Heavenly Tribulations were more formidable, and most cultivators wouldn't live to die of old age.</p><p>Only by breaking through to the Void Refinement realm would they only need to be wary of Heavenly Tribulations.</p><p>It was said that the Void Refinement Heavenly Tribulation was the Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, occurring every three thousand years, far more powerful than the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation. Therefore, breaking through to Void Refinement didn't guarantee a life of ease.</p><p>When Qin Sang learned that the key to breaking through to the Divine Transformation realm lay in Heavenly Resonance, he deduced that Void Refinement might require achieving unity with Heaven and Earth. He hadn't expected such a drawback to merging with the world in this realm.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren, able to execute a sword strike nearing Void Refinement power, must have received a grand inheritance. It wasn't surprising that he knew these things.</p><p>Qin Sang became curious about the Dao Court's altars.</p><p>As the core of a Court, the altars seemed to serve a purpose beyond simply bestowing decrees.</p><p>This led him to realize he'd never heard of the location of Mount Ju's altar.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang asked, “How long does Fellow Daoist intend to stay in the Source of Calamity?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say at this point.  It depends on how far the location is and the situation there, but certainly not too long,” Zhi Jian Zhenren explained.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>In that case, he could accompany Zhi Jian Zhenren on this trip. If they returned empty-handed, he could then fulfill the decree.</p><p>The decree didn't specify a timeframe, suggesting it was fairly flexible.</p><p>He made up his mind and agreed.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, the two returned to Sword Heart Island, where True Lords You Huang and Gu Yun were waiting.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang would be joining them, the two exchanged glances, not expressing joy, but not outright rejecting the idea either.</p><p>They knew that Qin Sang was seeking ascension qualifications.</p><p>True Lord You Huang turned to Zhi Jian Zhenren. “Fellow Daoist Qing Feng is still at the Second Order Decree. The Altar Guardian Divine General can only protect those of the Ascending Profound Dharma Position. The influence within the Source of Calamity will certainly be far greater on him than on us. Might we return together then?”</p><p>True Lord Gu Yun added, “Although Fellow Daoist Qing Feng has the True Stability Pill, he only has one.  This journey presents numerous complexities.  I fear…”</p><p>The two voiced their concerns.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren hadn’t revealed Qin Sang’s details to them before.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren chuckled. “True Lord You Huang, have no worries. I happen to possess a few pills that stabilize the Primordial Spirit. Although they can't completely ward off the Six Heavens Ancient Qi, they're sufficient as a temporary measure.”</p><p>True Lord You Huang nodded slightly.  They wouldn't remain in the Source of Calamity for long.  As long as they maintained their sanity, they could recover slowly upon their return.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren then turned to True Lord Gu Yun. “You underestimate Fellow Daoist Qing Feng. He cultivates both Dharma and Body, demonstrating formidable physical prowess during our last encounter. With his full strength, he has a chance of holding back two opponents.  We might even have to rely on Fellow Daoist Qing Feng at critical moments.”</p><p>“Dharma and Body cultivation?”</p><p>True Lord Gu Yun’s eyes widened, looking at Qin Sang in surprise.</p><p>Dual cultivation of Dharma and Body was rare in this world, even more so for someone like him who cultivated the Dragon Tiger Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang simply replied, "A stroke of luck."</p><p>Having revealed this to Zhi Jian Zhenren before, there was no need to hide it from these two.  Moreover, they needed to cooperate sincerely on this mission to target a Demon Marquis.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren stopped the eager True Lord Gu Yun. “I know you’re eager for battle, but this isn't the time for sparring. There will be ample opportunities to fight once we enter the Source of Calamity.”</p><p>Turning to Qin Sang, Zhi Jian Zhenren asked, “Is there anything else Fellow Daoist Qing Feng needs to do before we depart? Let’s share our ideas and resources to ensure we're fully prepared and avoid being caught off guard.”</p><p>With the Return Wind Armor already refined, Qin Sang didn't really have anything else to do.</p><p>However, a thought occurred to him. “Fellow Daoist, do you recall the Imperial Bell True Talisman? I've been gathering spiritual materials, but I still lack Kun Earth Blood Sand, and haven't had any leads.”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren looked at True Lord Gu Yun. “I recall Fellow Daoist Gu Yun possessing a piece of Kun Earth Blood Sand.”</p><p>True Lord Gu Yun immediately produced the item, a fist-sized, blood-red ore.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was composed of tiny, rice-grain-sized crystals fused together.</p><p>Once refined, it could be used to create cinnabar for talisman inscription.</p><p>Qin Sang also took out the spiritual materials he had collected.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren examined them. “These are almost enough to create three Imperial Bell True Talismans.”</p><p>True Lord Gu Yun interjected, “I have a friend who is skilled in talisman crafting.  I can ask him to create the talismans.  I'll provide the missing spiritual materials. If we obtain more than two, how about giving me one?”</p><p>The last sentence was directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Agreed,” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Every cultivator in this world could inscribe talismans, but the success rate varied greatly.  Not everyone could become a grandmaster.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he were to craft the talismans himself, he’d be lucky to create even one.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>True Lord Gu Yun laughed heartily, sweeping his sleeve to collect all the spiritual materials.</p><p>They discussed for a while longer before departing separately.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Pot Island first, retrieved the Return Wind Armor from Master Qi, and informed him that he would be leaving for a while.</p><p>Master Qi seemed rather reluctant, whether it was due to a bond with Qin Sang or an attachment to the Return Wind Armor was unclear.</p><p>Qin Sang then relinquished his cave dwelling on Pot Island and began cultivating on Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he waited for a year.</p><p>During this time, True Lord Gu Yun visited once, informing Qin Sang that only two Imperial Bell True Talismans had been successfully crafted, one for each of them.</p><p>With no further news, the four gathered, and True Lord You Huang even speculated whether the Dao Court had exaggerated matters, making them go through all this trouble for nothing.</p><p>After waiting for several more months, just as Qin Sang was considering whether to investigate the Ghost Fang Kingdom himself, news finally arrived!</p><p>…</p><p>Sword Heart Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhi Jian Zhenren stood side-by-side, while an elderly man who referred to himself as "old servant" attended them. Although his cultivation wasn’t weak, he couldn’t participate in a battle of this level and could only remain at the cave dwelling.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Two streaks of light arrived, swiftly approaching them.</p><p>As soon as True Lord You Huang landed, she eagerly asked, “Is it confirmed?”</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren nodded.  “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, the source is absolutely reliable! The Demon Marquises of the Ghost Fang Kingdom are on the move, heading in that direction. We haven’t ascertained their identities yet, but time is of the essence. We can’t wait any longer.”</p><p>“How long ago did they depart?” True Lord Gu Yun inquired.</p><p>“Two days ago, but the news just arrived,” Zhi Jian Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>As apex cultivators, their speeds wouldn’t differ greatly. They had to set off immediately.</p><p>“There must be others besides us, right?  Being a little slower might not be a bad thing,” True Lord You Huang’s expression became relaxed.</p><p>“There will certainly be others. Everyone knows the Dao Court’s tricks,” True Lord Gu Yun scoffed.</p><p>As they spoke, the group prepared to depart, heading north.</p><p>They arrived smoothly at the northern shore of the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>A vast expanse of wild grass stretched as far as the eye could see.  The thick, yellow stalks reached twice the height of a man, resembling a dense jungle.</p><p>Upon reaching land, the four continued to fly high in the sky.</p><p>The grassland was incredibly vast.  They flew for a considerable time before reaching its edge.</p><p>It was fortunate that they hadn't encountered a single ferocious beast along the way.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren halted in front, saying gravely, “Ferocious beasts roam ahead. Be cautious, everyone. If you encounter any, remember to end the fight swiftly!”</p><p>He then handed Qin Sang several jade bottles, explaining how to use them.</p><p>The bottles contained various types of pills, clearly accumulated by Zhi Jian Zhenren over many years, all given to Qin Sang.</p>
