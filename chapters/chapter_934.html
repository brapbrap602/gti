<h1>Chapter 926: Zou Lao's Invitation</h1><p>Before this, Qin Sang still wanted to attempt to forcefully push through to the later stage of the third transformation of the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, by utilizing the power of the Tyrant Blood Fruit.</p><p>Within the perilous Seven Kills Palace, every bit of increased strength meant a greater chance of survival.</p><p>Inside a quiet chamber of the cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the star platform, adjusting his state of being. Beside him lay a jade box containing the Tyrant Blood Fruit. With his current physical strength, he was less fearful of the fruit's potent impact.</p><p>Previously, when breaking through to the third level, Qin Sang had consumed both the Azure Root and the Tyrant Blood Fruit in quick succession, forcibly shattering the bottleneck. The remaining medicinal power after the breakthrough, due to his insufficient physical strength, risked causing his body to collapse if forcibly refined. Thus, he activated the Celestial Demon Transformation, diverting most of it to his phoenix wings.</p><p>Even so, refining the remaining medicinal energy proved highly beneficial, allowing him to achieve his breakthrough so quickly.</p><p>Now, consuming the Tyrant Blood Fruit, even if the breakthrough failed, would still enhance his physical body significantly.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached his peak state.</p><p>Eyes tightly closed, he opened his mouth wide and swallowed a Tyrant Blood Fruit whole.</p><p>As the medicinal power dissolved in his stomach, Qin Sang, experienced in handling such effects, grimaced but remained motionless, enduring the first wave of impact and methodically channeling the medicinal power.</p><p>The violent energy surged like a tide, rampaging through his body. Qin Sang's face paled, and he groaned, but he didn't manifest his phoenix wings. Instead, he endured the pain, intending to have his physical body refine the fruit's power.</p><p>His skin became translucent, revealing his boiling flesh and blood.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as though his body was being torn apart.  Aching and itching sensations emanated from deep within his bone marrow, a pain almost unbearable for ordinary people. Sweat poured from him, carrying a strange odor.</p><p>Impurities seemed to be expelled, though the effect was far less pronounced than during his breakthrough.</p><p>Wave after wave of medicinal tides were endured by Qin Sang.</p><p>He exhaled deeply, realizing he was drenched in sweat. Slowly clenching his fists, he felt his physical body had significantly improved, but he was still some distance from a breakthrough. After all, he hadn't been cultivating this technique for long.</p><p>Qin Sang inspected his internal state, murmuring, "Most of the medicinal power lies dormant within. I must refine this energy before consuming more Tyrant Blood Fruit.  Unlike the Azure Root, taking two Tyrant Blood Fruits together risks bodily collapse, forcing me to divert the excess to my phoenix wings. That would be a waste. There's no need to further enhance my wings and speed right now. Physical strength should be improved gradually, solidifying the foundation. Relying solely on spiritual medicines will certainly leave hidden dangers."</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang suppressed his thoughts and circulated his cultivation technique, refining the remaining medicinal power.</p><p>More than a year passed in this manner.</p><p>A figure flew out of the cave dwelling, vanishing into the azure Demon Sea with a few flashes.</p><p>Qin Sang, carrying the Celestial Corpse Coffin, flew towards Great Desolation Island.</p><p>His Avatar, now sealed within the coffin, had reached the peak of the Core Formation stage after refining the blood pearl.</p><p>The hidden dangers of the rapid cultivation method now fully manifested.</p><p>The disparity in cultivation between Qin Sang and his Avatar had become too great. The residual power of the Jade Buddha within his sword spirit and the secret technique from the *Sowing Demon Embryo* were no longer sufficient to suppress the Avatar's demonic soul.</p><p>Without resolving the bloodthirsty demonic intent, the Avatar was a true demon. Once released, Qin Sang would be the first target.</p><p>Only by activating the Celestial Demon Transformation could Qin Sang forcefully suppress the backlash and control the Avatar in combat.</p><p>Normally, he could only seal the Avatar within the Celestial Corpse Coffin, keeping it dormant.</p><p>Over ten days later, Qin Sang's light faded as he landed on Great Desolation Island and returned to the Inner Sea via the teleportation array.</p><p>He had arranged to meet Zou Lao on Skyrise Island before the Seven Kills Palace opened. He wondered if Zou Lao had the patience to wait for him until now.</p><p>Returning to Skyrise City, Qin Sang went directly to the Exquisite Jade Trading Company.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng, you've finally arrived!  You've been so elusive, disappearing for years without a word. I feared…"  Zou Lao hurried into the shop, his eyes scanning the room. Seeing Qin Sang, he sighed in relief.</p><p>"Did you think I had perished, Zou Lao?" Qin Sang asked with a smile, then his expression turned serious. "I've been preparing for the Seven Kills Palace, which delayed me for a few days.  Fortunately, I haven't missed the appointed time. Have you confirmed your plans to venture with fellow Daoists from the East Pole Alliance?"</p><p>Zou Lao nodded. "Indeed. I acted a bit late, and the jade talismans outside have already been distributed. Even if one occasionally appears, the price is exorbitant. Like you last time, I must first undertake a task for the Trading Alliance.  Fortunately, among the fellow Daoists this time, two have some prior acquaintance with me and can offer assistance."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded, asking no further questions, unwilling to be drawn into the affairs of the Trading Alliance.</p><p>Zou Lao paused slightly, then continued, "Over these years, I've traveled extensively, identifying three locations that are essential visits. For the first two, I'm reasonably confident. However, the last secret realm is said to contain ancient restrictions, fraught with danger, requiring assistance. I've persuaded two fellow Daoists to aid me. If you obtain your desired treasures early, Daoist Qing Feng, you could join us in exploring that location. Inside, apart from the spiritual herb I seek, all other treasures will be shared equally."</p><p>Zou Lao took out a map and pointed out the locations to Qin Sang.</p><p>The map was incredibly detailed, marking two secret realms Qin Sang had never heard of, showcasing Zou Lao's meticulous preparation for this journey. His lifespan was nearing its end; this was his final gamble.</p><p>"Flower Fairy Lake?"</p><p>Seeing the location Zou Lao indicated, Qin Sang's expression showed surprise. It was the entrance to Flower Fairy Lake, the very place where he and Lady Liu ambushed Cui Ji.</p><p>Zou Lao noticed the change in Qin Sang's tone. "Have you been there, Daoist?"</p><p>Glancing at Zou Lao from beneath his hood, Qin Sang shook his head. "I merely passed by, never daring to enter. Zou Lao, you don't intend to enter Flower Fairy Lake, do you? That's one of the three deadliest locations in the Seven Kills Palace…"</p><p>"Rest assured, Daoist," Zou Lao chuckled, interrupting Qin Sang. "We will only explore the outermost area of Flower Fairy Lake. The toxins there are less potent than in the depths, and with our cultivation, we can withstand them for a period. I've also prepared some antidote pills, sufficient to last until our departure. Take this token, Daoist. Crush it at the entrance, and I'll sense it."</p><p>"Since you've considered everything, Zou Lao, I'll consider joining you if I resolve my own matters smoothly."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the token.</p><p>He also pondered that even without Zou Lao's invitation, he might visit Flower Fairy Lake if the opportunity arose, to see if he could utilize the Fat Silkworm's abilities to gain some advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy to help Zou Lao.  He was quite familiar with him and knew his character. If he could truly assist him in reaching Nascent Soul, he would gain a powerful ally.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang knew full well that reaching Nascent Soul was no easy feat.</p>
