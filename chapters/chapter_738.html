<h1>Chapter 730: Crashing the Party</h1><p>Cui Ji had been lording it over Five Elements Island for years, and unless he was deliberately hiding his true abilities, his background had been thoroughly investigated.</p><p>After confirming that Cui Ji had also used the Fiend Devouring Pill for his breakthrough and hadn't purged the demonic energy from his body, Qin Sang had a pretty good idea of his strength.</p><p>After fifteen years of demon hunting,</p><p>even before subduing the Twin-Headed Serpent, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of mid-stage Core Formation cultivators, let alone one whose strength was compromised by demonic energy.</p><p>Now, with the Twin-Headed Serpent, defeating this person would be a piece of cake.</p><p>However, it hadn't been long since he had ordered the Twin-Headed Serpent to steal the Winter Nether Cold Flame from the black-armored man.  If word of it reached Tempest Island, it might attract unwanted attention, so he needed to be cautious when using it.</p><p>"Let's go. Take me to meet this Cui Ji."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up.</p><p>As a manager, his income was directly tied to the Chamber of Commerce's business. Every little bit counted. To gain entry to the Seven Killing Hall, he was now practically penniless and in debt.</p><p>If the other party was willing to settle things amicably, then so be it. But Cui Ji's actions clearly showed he wasn't interested in negotiation.</p><p>Humiliating the Wang sisters and suppressing the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce – was he trying to make an example of them?</p><p>Unfortunately for Cui Ji, he hadn't picked the right chicken to slaughter. Since Cui Ji had handed him this opportunity on a silver platter, it would be a shame not to seize it.</p><p>The four of them walked out of the shop. The old man was worried, but he didn't dare stop Qin Sang. He could only pray that Qin Sang was as capable as he seemed.</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted a message to the Wang sisters, explaining his plan and asking for their opinion.</p><p>Wang Shi blushed after hearing it, while Wang Xiang's face lit up with excitement, looking as if she couldn't wait for some chaos. In the end, they both agreed.</p><p>……</p><p>"The Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce's new managers are quite stunning. The two sisters look almost identical, yet their temperaments are completely different, each with their own unique charm.  Truly rare."</p><p>Inside the main hall, a group of people sat in a circle, discussing something, when one of them suddenly made this remark.</p><p>"They're just ignorant and arrogant!"</p><p>A young man with a pale and somewhat gloomy face, seated at the head of the table, snorted.  "I heard these two were originally rogue cultivators with no foundation in the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce.  Who knows who they offended to be dumped here by Old Zou. I tried to reason with them nicely, but not only did they refuse to listen, they even dared to glare at me."</p><p>This man was Cui Ji.</p><p>"Such a charming pair of sisters, both with top-tier talent. The elder sister is already a Core Formation cultivator, so the younger sister shouldn't be far behind. They are rare gems, perfect companions. As they say, beauties love heroes, and proximity breeds affection. With a little effort, Manager Cui, you can surely win their hearts. Allow me to congratulate you in advance…"</p><p>A man with a goatee made a strange sound, winking and cupping his hands towards the young man.</p><p>A wave of lewd laughter erupted in the hall.</p><p>A few of them looked uncomfortable, unwilling to join in the vulgarity, but they didn't dare openly defy the young man, so they could only force a smile.</p><p>Just then, a muffled thud came from outside the hall.</p><p>The laughter abruptly stopped.  Everyone looked at each other, about to get up and investigate when a scream pierced the air.</p><p>A series of screams and thuds followed, clearly indicating that the Nine Star Society's guards were being easily dealt with by the intruder.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Cui Ji slammed his hand on the table, furious.  "Who dares to cause trouble in the Nine Star Society?!"</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, everyone sensed two auras rushing towards the hall.  Their expressions changed slightly, exchanging glances and discreetly preparing themselves, but none of them made a move.</p><p>Cui Ji and the other Nine Star Society cultivators flew out of the hall. They were met with the sight of their guards scattered on the ground, injured and groaning.  The Core Formation guard captain was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Cui Ji's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Two streaks of light landed in front of them, revealing the Wang sisters.</p><p>Cui Ji's anger turned into a chilling smile. "So, the two of you have returned. Have you reconsidered and decided to accept my offer, to become my concubines?"</p><p>Spewing his vulgarity, Cui Ji's eyes darted around, searching. Not only could he not find his most capable subordinate, but there was no sign of a struggle either, which alarmed him.</p><p>"Bah! You lecher…"</p><p>Wang Xiang glared at him.  Finally able to unleash her pent-up anger and curse a mid-stage Core Formation cultivator to his face, Wang Xiang felt a mix of apprehension and exhilaration.</p><p>Cui Ji seemed oblivious to Wang Xiang's insults, his gaze fixed on a shadowed corner.</p><p>By now, the others from the hall had also emerged. Seeing the scene outside, they were shocked.</p><p>If Cui Ji's enemies had come knocking, they naturally wouldn't get involved. But if someone was targeting the entire East Pole Alliance, they would have to rely on Cui Ji, no matter how much they disliked him.</p><p>Just then, a figure slowly emerged from the shadows. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>In Qin Sang's hand was a man, the Nine Star Society's guard captain.</p><p>They had entered under the guise of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce and, catching the Nine Star Society off guard, launched a surprise attack, easily subduing the guards outside. The guard captain, though a Core Formation cultivator, was no match for Qin Sang and had been easily captured and his cultivation sealed.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the unconscious guard captain onto the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p>Cui Ji's eye twitched.  "Who are you?  Do you realize that by attacking people on Nine Star Society grounds, you are making an enemy of the East Pole Alliance?"</p><p>"I am Qing Feng, sent by Old Zou as the new manager of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce. I am a member of the East Pole Alliance myself. How can I be making an enemy of it?"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, turning to the Wang sisters. "Was this the man who publicly insulted you and wanted to take you as concubines?"</p><p>"It was him!" Wang Xiang replied crisply.</p><p>Wang Shi nodded slightly.</p><p>"How dare you covet my women! You have some nerve!"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned outrage.</p><p>Wang Shi blushed, while Wang Xiang looked even more thrilled.</p><p>"I will spare you all, considering you are merely accomplices and fellow members of the Merchant Alliance. However, this man's actions cannot be tolerated, both publicly and privately!  I will not let him off lightly! Today is just the beginning. I will also send a letter to the Merchant Alliance and demand justice! Are you staying here because you intend to side with him?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was icy as he swept it across the group.</p><p>Even through the cloak, they felt his gaze like sharp knives cutting into their skin.  They dared not meet his eyes and instinctively stepped aside.</p><p>Qin Sang's silent capture of the Nine Star Society's guard captain was too shocking. So many people were present, yet no one had noticed how he did it.</p><p>Moreover, they were all members of the East Pole Alliance. Why should they step forward to help Cui Ji settle a personal grudge?</p><p>As expected, they were all spineless opportunists.  Give them a reason, and they'd scatter like rats.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly and looked at Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji's expression was dark and menacing, his eyes trying to pierce through the cloak to see Qin Sang's true face. "A nameless, cloaked rogue cultivator dares to speak such nonsense in front of me?  Be careful not to bite off more than you can chew!"</p>
