<h1>Chapter 1982: Me or Not Me</h1><p>“The mortal realm, let no immortals or demons enter!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was flat, his voice not loud.</p><p>Yet, this sentence seemed to contain boundless power, transcending the mountains, spreading to the human world, echoing from Yun Du Mountain all the way to Mu Luo Mountain.</p><p>Anyone with cultivation could hear it.</p><p>Without any celestial phenomena, it sounded like thunder in the ears of all beings, its power unmatched.</p><p>This thunder reverberated in their hearts.</p><p>Bringing boundless terror, like a heavenly law!</p><p>All cultivators felt their hearts tremble, an invisible pressure descending upon them, making it hard to breathe.</p><p>Words holding heavenly mandate, spoken laws taking effect!</p><p>…</p><p>Yan capital city.</p><p>The Prime Minister's residence.</p><p>After experiencing the radiant light, dark clouds, rolling thunder, and other strange phenomena, the common people, unaware of the truth, were in a state of panic.</p><p>They wondered if their prayers had been answered.</p><p>Thankfully, the sky didn't actually fall.</p><p>The common people couldn't hear Qin Sang's voice. Seeing the celestial phenomena gradually disappear, the clear sky reappear, the sun set, and everything return to normal, they hesitated whether to go out and have a look.</p><p>But the Prime Minister had ordered everyone to stay in the residence and not go out.</p><p>‘Clip-clop-clip…’</p><p>A fast horse arrived at the front of the residence, carrying the Emperor’s decree, causing chaos in the Prime Minister's residence.</p><p>No one knew where the Prime Minister had gone.</p><p>Inside the Imperial Palace.</p><p>The Yan Emperor stood before his sleeping quarters, having watched the entire celestial spectacle unfold. He narrowed his eyes, gazing at the dusky evening glow. “Has the Prime Minister arrived?”</p><p>Yu Lang had left in a hurry, unable to take everything into account.</p><p>The eunuch, still reeling from the shock, trembled at the words and repeatedly replied, “Your Majesty, the imperial decree should have just reached the Prime Minister's residence…”</p><p>The Emperor made a noncommittal sound.</p><p>Immortals frequently interfering in mortal affairs, meddling in human conflicts—the existence of cultivators was no longer a secret.</p><p>He looked towards the east side of the imperial city, where there was a deer park, a dwelling place of immortals.</p><p>Such an astonishing celestial phenomenon, could it have been man-made?</p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p>A shadow fell over the Emperor's heart.  Was it not possible that such a vast empire as Yan could be erased in the blink of an eye?</p><p>Little did he know that cultivators possessing such power were extremely rare.  The immortals in the deer park were currently trembling, desperately wanting to know what had happened.</p><p>“General Qin is not at the residence.”</p><p>Someone whispered, “General Tao has also left the city, saying he is going to see Master Yun.”</p><p>Tao Teng, having received Yu Lang's message, sought help from his master.</p><p>The two of them were closest to Master Yun, and Master Yun's decrees were conveyed to the Yan cultivator world through them.</p><p>Everyone was hesitant. That decree forbidding entry into the mortal realm made their hearts pound.  They neither dared to leave nor to stay, all gazing towards the tallest tower in the deer park.</p><p>A figure stood at the top of the tower, the Yuan Ying Grandmaster guarding the capital city—the ancestor of the Kuang family.</p><p>“Leave the city!”</p><p>The Kuang ancestor said in a deep voice, and flew out of the city first.</p><p>Hearing that decree, he was uneasy and dared not remain in the mortal realm.</p><p>In an instant, the deer park was empty.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan's old capital.</p><p>A quiet and elegant courtyard.</p><p>In the courtyard stood an apricot tree, its branches lush and leafy, remaining verdant even in late autumn.  Hidden amongst the leaves were tiny specks of yellow—ripe apricots.</p><p>Beneath the tree were stone tables and benches, and an ancient well.</p><p>A scholar, having put down his book, stood up and observed the celestial phenomena.</p><p>After listening for a moment, the scholar's expression changed drastically. He glanced at the courtyard, revealing a look of reluctance, and sighed softly.</p><p>“The sages often say: The greatest concealment is within the crowd, but I fear it cannot be hidden anymore!”</p><p>He gently patted the trunk of the tree beside him.</p><p>The apricot tree swayed slightly, the apricots swinging like lanterns, emitting a strange fragrance, as if possessing sentience.</p><p>“You listened to me read, becoming spiritual, it’s fate. Come back to the mountain with me.”</p><p>He didn’t know how strict this decree was. He was afraid that leaving the apricot spirit here might result in its discovery and its being chopped down for firewood.</p><p>The scholar used magic to move the apricot tree, leaving the courtyard with a lingering look of reluctance.</p><p>…</p><p>At the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The village had only a few dozen households, making their living by hunting.</p><p>The wealthiest family was on the east side of the village.</p><p>The man was called Wang Hanzi. He wasn't originally from this village. He had drifted here, and an old hunter, seeing his plight, took him in, fed him, and even gave him his daughter in marriage.</p><p>Wang Hanzi was strong and had great strength. Every time he went up the mountain, he returned with a full load. However, he also ate a lot and was very simple.  He only smiled when he saw people, and even when he was made fun of, he didn't seem to get angry, making him seem rather simple, earning him this nickname.</p><p>The celestial changes arrived.</p><p>Wang Hanzi, who was enthusiastically eating with a bowl, suddenly dropped his bowl and rushed out of the house.</p><p>The clouds dispersed, and the thunder subsided, and Wang Hanzi remained standing there like a post, motionless.</p><p>A sturdy boy, clinging tightly to Wang Hanzi's leg, his face pale with fright, whimpered, "Father, are we still going up the mountain today?"  Wang Hanzi sighed, glancing down at his son, then at his wife, whose beauty was unremarkable but whose love for him was evident. His expression was unlike any she had seen before.</p><p>Wife and son stared at him, bewildered by the change in him.</p><p>"My master has sent me down the mountain to overcome a trial of the heart," he said, his voice low. "I fear I may fail, perhaps I already have."</p><p>Wang Hanzi ruffled his son's hair, then embraced his wife. "Let's return to the mountain together."</p><p>...</p><p>Yun Xian Shi glared intensely towards Qingyang Temple.  He sensed that the temple was the source of the cataclysm.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng..."</p><p>The image of the serene figure flashed through his mind, sending a shiver down his spine.  Cold sweat beaded on his back. He had actually considered using Master Qingfeng as a pawn!</p><p>A command echoed in his mind, jolting him awake.  He recognized the voice instantly – Master Qingfeng – but it came from the east?  The east...?</p><p>Terror seized him.  Leaving behind a message, he hurried back to Mount Yun Du.</p><p>Tao Teng, on his way to see his master, received the message.  The order to see Yu Lang left him utterly confused.</p><p>...</p><p>Simultaneously, a figure, a grey streak radiating an ominous aura, shot from the north, from Liu State.  This was the cloaked figure who had once faced Yun Xian Shi in a contest of power.  He, too, had sensed the anomalies and was fleeing in terror, no longer daring to remain among mortals.</p><p>His gaze remained fixed on Qingyang Temple, until, finally, after traveling a considerable distance,  the heavens remained clear.  Somewhat relieved, yet still wary, he didn't stop.</p><p>He looked towards the west, towards the mountain gate.  Still no word from his sect.  Was this upheaval insufficient to alarm his master and force him from seclusion?  A nameless dread filled him.</p><p>...</p><p>In Yuan Ding, there flowed a river known as the Heavenly River.  Yuan Ding's terrain slopes down from west to east, its peaks imposing and inaccessible to ordinary people.  The river's source lay high in these mountains, seemingly descending from the heavens – hence its name.</p><p>More often, however, it was called the Evil River.  Its violent currents and frequent flooding transformed the riverbanks into swamps, claiming countless lives.</p><p>It wasn't devoid of a deity.  But its guardian was an evil dragon, its power derived not from devotion, but from its control over the water veins.</p><p>Even the strongest dams could not withstand the dragon's onslaught. It preferred devouring its victims to receiving offerings.  Each flood was its awakening, its hunt for sustenance. Ironically, the more devastating the flood, the greater the offerings.</p><p>A village clung to the hillside.  The villagers were bowing in prayer.</p><p>Suddenly, a child pointed towards the river, shouting, "Look! Look!"</p><p>They gazed, witnessing a sight as unforgettable as the cataclysm itself.</p><p>A deafening roar. The water churned violently, as if a legendary dragon were stirring. Fish leaped from the river in terror.  The villagers felt their fear, exchanging fearful glances.</p><p>Then, they noticed the water level falling.  Rocks emerged from the depths.  The water receded faster and faster, revealing the riverbed's mud.  The village elders, seeing this, learned for the first time the true depth of the Heavenly River.</p><p>"There!" someone yelled.  The water was flowing towards a single point, where a vortex formed in the widest part of the river.</p><p>The water drained away, revealing a bottomless chasm.  The dragon had vanished underground.</p><p>Then, water began to rise again from the chasm, the river slowly returning to its previous level. The villagers stared, stunned, at the now unprecedented calm of the river.</p><p>Within a few decades, almost no one along the Heavenly River remembered it ever being called the "Evil River."</p><p>...</p><p>In the western reaches of the land, Yin Luo and Mount Mu Luo bordered each other.  Demons frequently descended from the mountain, tormenting the people. The establishment of Yin Luo, a country created to counter Mount Yun Du, surprisingly brought stability to the region.</p><p>Outside Yin Luo's capital city lay West Mountain. After the cataclysm, a yellow glow emanated from the mountain, accompanied by the cracking of rocks.  The peak shook violently, sending boulders tumbling down, as if its outer layer were being peeled away.</p><p>With a loud crack, a huge rock detached, but instead of falling, it formed a pillar, extending outward like a gigantic arm, its five fingers clearly defined.</p><p>Two arms forcefully braced against the mountain peaks on either side, slowly lifting the mountain.</p><p>The earth trembled, and a figure slowly rose, its body as large as a mountain, angular and composed of piled stones. Its head was a square stone, with two stone walls splitting open to reveal a pair of deep, dark eyes.</p><p>It was the Mountain God of West Mountain!</p><p>He looked towards the east, then after a moment, he grabbed with both hands, and a yellowish-brown light burst from his fingertips, enveloping West Mountain.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The peaks of West Mountain were uprooted.</p><p>The stone figure shouldered the entire mountain range and ran towards Sunset Mountain.</p><p>Each step spanned numerous mountain ranges, the momentum earth-shattering, startling countless creatures.  Birds and beasts leaped about in chaos.  Even demonic beasts and fiends jumped onto the mountain range to escape into Sunset Mountain.</p><p>The stone figure paid them no mind, continuing its headlong dash.</p><p>Ahead, on the peak of a mountain, a face materialized on a stone, watching the stone figure approach. It asked in a muffled voice:</p><p>“Hey! The decree forbids immortals and demons. You’re not an evil god, so why are you running?”</p><p>The stone figure grunted in response, saying nothing, and stepped over the mountain in a single stride.</p><p>…</p><p>Ghost Gate.</p><p>Yin-Yang Pass.</p><p>With this pass sealed, Yin and Yang are separated; ghosts and gods do not meddle in worldly affairs.</p><p>Today, Ghost Gates across the human realm opened, and countless ghosts and gods returned to the mortal world.</p><p>The human world was in chaos. Many city god temples were no longer located in their respective capitals.  In a single country, several city gods needed time to sort out their relationships.</p><p>The city gods had anticipated this; once the human realm was unified, there would only be one city god, but they would still have to obey the orders of either Yun Du Tian or Luo Hun Yuan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a surprising turn of events occurred.</p><p>The city gods were all apprehensive, unsure if this decree was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>But as they heard the decree, they all saw the same figure appear before their eyes.</p><p>A Taoist priest, dressed in Taoist robes, ethereal and otherworldly.</p><p>Soon, the monarchs of all the human kingdoms received dreams from several city gods.</p><p>Upon awakening, the monarchs immediately issued edicts, mobilizing the entire nation to create a statue in the capital!</p><p>…</p><p>In the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body appeared at the edge of the thunderstorm, fingers forming sword seals, controlling his sword with all his might.</p><p>The Grey Ying Sword pierced through the storm, found its target, and mercilessly struck it.</p><p>Even if the ancestor of Ming Hu had survived the Thunder Oath, he would be extremely weakened. How could he withstand the Grey Ying Sword?</p><p>Just as he was about to eliminate all remaining traces of the ancestor, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he altered his sword seals.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The Grey Ying Sword retracted, its light carrying several objects, among them a jet-black skull.</p><p>The skull was covered in cracks – the skull of the Ming Hu ancestor.</p><p>Before it could be completely destroyed, Qin Sang had retrieved it.</p><p>The Ming Hu ancestor could normally use his skull to be reborn, but now he had been completely annihilated.</p><p>Not knowing its use for the moment, Qin Sang put it away with other artifacts.</p><p>…</p><p>"No wonder the Daoist took the lead yet chose white; I’ve become the black piece,”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou looked at the white piece in the center of the board and gained a sudden understanding.</p><p>Yun Du Tian and Luo Hun Yuan were using the human world as a chessboard for their game, which attracted the Taoist priest.</p><p>But why would such a powerful cultivator show such favor to the human world? Was he going to become a Saint?</p><p>Saint?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's heart stirred.</p><p>He was certain that the Taoist priest was not a cultivator of the Divine Dao.</p><p>There had long been rumors of escalating conflict between the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle schools, with more and more cultivators switching to the Great Vehicle path, causing demons and monsters to become more cautious, fearful of inadvertently becoming a stepping stone for someone else's enlightenment.</p><p>The Great Vehicle path not only includes the Divine Dao but is said to branch out into several paths based on the Divine Dao, including the Saintly Path.</p><p>The Saintly Path teaches and guides the people!</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Kingdom's capital.</p><p>Upon entering the city gates, people saw a gigantic stone statue.</p><p>The area in front of the city gate was cleared and made into a plaza, with the statue standing in the center.</p><p>The statue was as white as jade and depicted a Taoist priest – Qingfeng Daochang, the master of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form stood before the statue and murmured four words:</p><p>“Great Vehicle Killing Path.”</p><p>Qingyuan had pointed out the Great Vehicle path to him, and Qin Sang had gained some understanding. This was using Ming Hu's ancestor and Gu Yun Sou for his enlightenment, in accordance with Yu Lang's wish to protect the people.</p><p>Only by knowing who to protect can one know who to kill.</p><p>The Purple Micro Sword Master, walking through mountains of corpses and blood, his hands stained with blood, cultivated the Killing Path.  He should have been a lone wolf, but he had established a force, the Fourteen Sword Pavilions.</p><p>So that’s how it is.</p><p>“But who did he protect?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked himself.</p><p>And himself?</p><p>He had been determined to pursue immortality; would he have to protect the people, willingly bear countless karmic entanglements, and become a Saint?</p><p>He felt a difference in understanding with the "Purple Micro Sword Scripture," greater than any before.</p><p>It was a divergence of the Dao!</p><p>This time, he used his disciple’s heart to clarify his own path.</p><p>And in the future?</p><p>He couldn't take on a disciple every time he sought enlightenment.</p><p>Furthermore, if it wasn’t from his own heart, it would not be the right path.</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Yu Lang walked into the plaza, seeing Qin Sang before the statue.</p><p>Qin Sang's true form and the statue were different faces, yet Yu Lang knew it was his master.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look at his disciple and said, "Qingfeng is me, but I am not Qingfeng."</p>
