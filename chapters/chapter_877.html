<h1>Chapter 869: The Beast King Banners</h1><p>A few Beast King Banners alone don't form a powerful array, their power is probably limited.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't truly coveting the treasures. By stealing these banners, he'd create a larger weakness in their formation, increasing the chances of them failing against those mysterious figures.</p><p>A mutually destructive outcome would be ideal, of course.</p><p>He was happy to cause trouble for Black Serpent Mountain, any trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang had already sensed the events on the island—Chu Heng and the others had perished, leaving only him.  He couldn't possibly join the mysterious figures; Black Serpent Mountain had overwhelming numbers, and revenge was currently very difficult. He'd take some interest before leaving.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire enveloped the Beast King Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't certain if the Nine Nether Infernal Fire could sever the connection between the banners, but he decided to try.</p><p>The black-robed man controlled ten banners; one had been destroyed by the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, and the remaining nine trembled violently, trying to break free from Qin Sang's grasp.</p><p>But under the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, their struggle weakened considerably.</p><p>Without their master's control, and far from the others, severed by the fire, the banners immediately became docile. Qin Sang didn't expend much effort in taking all nine.</p><p>The enraged shouts of the black-robed man echoed from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, sneered, then his body shimmered with the image of a dragon and sword light, transforming into a streak of escaping light that vanished in the wind and rain in an instant.</p><p>The night was filled with a violent storm, the clouds obscuring the sky, plunging everything into darkness.</p><p>Other Black Serpent Mountain disciples were closing in on their target, unaware that their fourth senior brother had not only failed, but had been killed. They hadn't even seen what happened.</p><p>By the time they realized something was wrong, it was too late.</p><p>Furthermore, none of them possessed escape techniques comparable to Qin Sang’s.  They could only watch helplessly as he fled.</p><p>“Fourth Brother!”</p><p>The second senior brother’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>The others were distraught and indecisive, unsure whether to continue encircling the target or pursue the killer.  Chasing him would be pointless given his escape speed.</p><p>They all looked to their second senior brother, but another matter caused even greater concern.</p><p>Their first senior brother was still on the island, caught in the lightning, and had vanished without a trace. He hadn't even intervened when the fourth senior brother was killed. Had something happened to him, too?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>A gigantic figure was thrown from the island, crashing into the sea and creating a huge wave.</p><p>Then, a young man surnamed Fang flashed out, blood-sword in hand, plunging into the water.</p><p>The Kui dragon roared, battling the young man.</p><p>Unlike Chu Heng and the others, Fang had protective talismans, and his injuries were light, though the star煞 slowed him down slightly. The Kui dragon was already severely wounded, and the outcome was obvious.</p><p>The Kui dragon's sneak attack on Fang was met with a brutal counter-attack, its furious roars turning into pained cries.</p><p>“First Senior Brother!”</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples rejoiced, their shouts filling the air.</p><p>“First Senior Brother, Fourth Brother is dead!”</p><p>“Avenge Fourth Brother!”</p><p>“Kill that person, tear him limb from limb!”</p><p>…</p><p>A hand formed from true energy clamped around the Kui dragon’s throat.  The young man surnamed Fang floated beneath its corpse, a formidable figure seemingly holding down a dragon with one hand.</p><p>His face was grim. Ignoring the dragon’s corpse, he glared fixedly at the direction Qin Sang had fled, having learned of his fourth junior brother's gruesome end.</p><p>But that strange force had delayed him, preventing him from arriving in time. He was unwilling to admit it, but the other person’s escape technique was superior; catching him was impossible.</p><p>“Capture the Lán Dòu Gate deserter first; we’ll settle the rest of the blood debt later!”</p><p>Fang had to make a choice; the greater matter came first.</p><p>He suppressed the Kui dragon, finally slaying the great demon.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang fled, but not far.  Once certain he was no longer pursued, he concealed his light, circled briefly in the air, and landed on a distant reef.</p><p>He looked back at the way he'd come, his eyes flickering as he pondered for a moment before setting up a concealment formation and sitting cross-legged on the reef, summoning the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The situation had been urgent before, preventing him from checking the butterfly's condition, which now caused him some worry.</p><p>The badly injured butterfly flew out, circling Qin Sang before clinging to his wrist, its large wings trembling, as if both sulking and seeking comfort.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked and comforted it, checking its body.</p><p>“Fortunately, it didn’t absorb much; otherwise, it would have been quite troublesome.  The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* describes the star煞 as terrifying, its invasion of the primordial spirit causing major problems.  A spirit insect’s primordial spirit is far too fragile, even weaker than a beast of the same realm.”</p><p>"The Tianmu butterfly's own cultivation isn't very high..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened slightly, his face thoughtful. "Was that power truly Star煞?"</p><p>He was intimately familiar with Star煞; its power was sinister and chaotic.  Why could it coexist with thunder? Was the opponent using a thunder control technique, or an array?</p><p>What role did Star煞 play?</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* uses Star煞 to refine the bloodline of demon beasts. Qin Sang wasn't a demon beast descendant, so he could only refine the Star煞 away, completely wasting it.</p><p>If he could obtain this thunder technique, he might be able to make use of it.</p><p>His priority was to determine the identities of the mysterious group and why the Black Serpent Mountain disciples ambushed them.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't rushed to leave because he trusted his escape techniques far surpassed others, allowing him to come and go freely. He planned to stay and see if there was an opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>He stroked the Tianmu butterfly, thinking of the ebony sword and the star conch. Both of these decisive techniques had been used and wouldn't recover soon, so he had to be careful in his future actions.</p><p>Then, he opened his palm and revealed the newly acquired Beast King Banners.</p><p>The Beast King Banners were bound by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, quite subdued.</p><p>Qin Sang was worried that the connection between these banners still existed, allowing the other party to spy on his movements. He immediately used his spiritual sense to investigate.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang's face lit up with a pleased expression, having made a discovery.</p><p>"There are indeed residual marks! Break!"</p><p>The marks within the Beast King Banners were forcefully erased.  A flash of golden light disappeared from the banners, and their connection to the other banners was completely severed, placing them under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>"Each Beast King Banner imprisons the primordial spirit of a demon beast…"</p><p>While erasing the marks, Qin Sang also uncovered the secrets of the Beast King Banners, leaving him surprised. The quality of the banners was not high, and the materials were unremarkable, but the crafting technique was exquisite, and their main power came from the beast souls.</p><p>"The Beast King Banners demand a very high level of control from the wielder, requiring extremely powerful spiritual sense. Even late-stage Golden Core cultivators can only manipulate about twenty. Too few, while allowing for forced array formation, results in weak power and is useless. A Nascent Soul master could certainly control this set of banners, but the power would still be too weak… Such effort to refine them, only to be used in cooperation with others. For sect disciples, close cooperation between fellow students is indeed a good combined attack treasure.  Being alone, without a sect or disciples, they are rather useless to me…"</p><p>Qin Sang said with some disappointment.</p>
