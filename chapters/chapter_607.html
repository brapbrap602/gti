<h1>Chapter 600: The Southern Ming Ethereal Fire</h1><p>Chapter 600: The Southern Ming Ethereal Fire</p><p>The passage was extremely deep, extending almost to the mountain's core.</p><p>The deeper they went, the hotter it became.  It felt as if a small sun was roasting them.</p><p>Despite cultivating their spiritual energy for protection, both were drenched in sweat.</p><p>The red light ahead grew increasingly dazzling.</p><p>This was a deep crimson flame, unlike any Qin Sang had ever seen before; it was utterly pure, without a trace of impurity.</p><p>To Qin Sang's astonishment, the flame emanated an indescribable sense of sanctity and majesty, inspiring an involuntary urge to worship.</p><p>In a daze, Qin Sang seemed to see a divine bird bathed in flames, peerlessly elegant, its gaze indifferent, overlooking all.</p><p>The flickering flames at the edge resembled a scattering of tragically beautiful feathers.</p><p>It truly seemed like an ancient divine bird resided within.</p><p>"Could this be a demonic fire?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with shock as he turned to Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi, seemingly searching for something, his gaze shifting back and forth, nodded upon hearing this: "It's possibly the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire, the legendary life-fire of the sacred beast, the Vermilion Bird.  Legend says this fire consumes all things.  Some legends depict it as white, while others maintain it’s red, like the Vermilion Bird itself. Whether it truly is the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire is impossible to confirm now, as no one has ever truly seen a Vermilion Bird. However..."</p><p>Still a distance from the demonic fire, Yun Youzi stopped, gazing at the flames and sighing, "The terrifying power of this fire is undeniable. Even if it's not the Vermilion Bird's life-fire, it must be the fire wielded by some ancient divine bird. The flames we see are merely the outward manifestation of the demonic fire's power. Its true form must be very small, hidden deep within, beyond anyone's reach…"</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire.</p><p>Legends of the Vermilion Bird endure, a sacred beast existing alongside immortals.</p><p>Now, even cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage are nowhere to be found, let alone such celestial beasts.</p><p>The Southern Ming Ethereal Fire, like its master, is a legendary sacred fire. Many artifacts and treasures falsely claim the name ‘Southern Ming Ethereal Fire,’ demonstrating its fame.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was now certain that not all divine beasts were merely human inventions.</p><p>The Azure Luan was proof!</p><p>He had seen a wooden carving of the Azure Luan from Old Lady Jing, knowing she had sensed its presence and seen it in person, proving that many divine beasts once existed in the world.</p><p>They, however, like powerful cultivators, have vanished without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi stood side by side, experiencing the demonic fire's aura.</p><p>Yun Youzi was right; even if not the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire, it was the demonic fire of some ancient divine beast.</p><p>The aura it emitted was even more terrifying than the Nine Nether Demon Fire described by Ancestor Kuiyin. The seemingly formidable Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Green Sun Demon Sect could only submit before it.</p><p>And its true form was merely a tiny wisp; Ancestor Kuiyin encountered a huge mass of Nine Nether Demon Fire!</p><p>The ancient alchemists of the Ziwei Palace actually used the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire as their alchemic fire, sealing it here.  Did they once imprison a Vermilion Bird?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but imagine the splendor of the Ziwei Palace in its prime, envying the powerful methods of ancient cultivators.</p><p>"Senior, do you intend to subdue this Southern Ming Ethereal Fire?"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Yun Youzi's purpose. He mentioned a life-threatening ordeal for his recovery, could it involve the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire?</p><p>Before entering the passage, Qin Sang had considered this, wanting to emulate Ancestor Kuiyin and obtain a powerful spiritual fire to enhance his strength.</p><p>But after sensing the power of the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire, Qin Sang abandoned the idea without hesitation.</p><p>The Southern Ming Ethereal Fire was too terrifying; such an action would be tantamount to suicide.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that even Nascent Soul Masters would retreat, no one would dare disturb the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire. What chance did Yun Youzi have?</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>Yun Youzi chuckled wryly, shaking his head.  "Let those Nascent Soul Masters and transformed demons come; which one would dare claim they could subdue the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire? At least no one in the Xiao Han Domain or the Heaven's Walk Alliance could, not even in their wildest dreams.  I’m not that arrogant…"</p><p>To Qin Sang's astonishment, Yun Youzi said calmly, "I merely wish to immerse myself in the Southern Ming Ethereal Fire, to use the demonic fire to burn my body and refine my soul, achieving rebirth through fire. Whether I ultimately become a phoenix reborn or turn to ash depends on my luck."</p><p>Rebirth through fire, soul refinement by demonic fire!</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply shocked. He thought his pursuit of the Corpse Path for the sake of forming his Golden Core was already shocking, but Yun Youzi was even more extreme, clearly seeking a sliver of hope from the impossible!</p><p>Qin Sang had never heard of such a method of healing.</p><p>He wondered if Yun Youzi had lost his mind.</p><p>“Senior, is there truly no other way? Is this the only option?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt compassion.  No wonder Yun Youzi kept saying it was a life-or-death gamble.  </p><p>To Qin Sang, it seemed like certain death.  </p><p>Like a moth to a flame, only worse!  To plunge into such terrifying demonic fire would instantly turn one to ash.</p><p>No matter how miraculous the San Guang Jade Liquid's effects, how much good could it possibly do?</p><p>“Senior's injuries… are they truly incurable? After leaving Ziwei Palace, I'll be able to form my golden core. Then we can travel together, searching for elixirs. The cultivation world is vast; we don't need to limit ourselves to Xiao Han Region. Perhaps…”</p><p>Yun Youzi interrupted Qin Sang, saying gravely, “I've tried every method, to no avail. My internal injuries are unlike anything a normal person could comprehend. I've searched through countless texts, finding no precedent. The only solution is to break through and rebuild. I refuse to spend the rest of my life at the False Core stage. Even if there's only a sliver of a chance, I have to seize it.”</p><p>Pausing, Yun Youzi's tone softened. “Qin, don't worry. If there’s absolutely no chance, I wouldn’t just blindly rush to my death. Those three drops of San Guang Jade Liquid will be a great help.  Furthermore, I know of something that can resist the burning of the Southern Ming Li Fire, offering some protection. That's why I asked you to come.”</p><p>Yun Youzi pointed towards the depths of the passage. “Hidden within is a fragment of green bronze, possibly a shard from an ancient cultivator's alchemy furnace.  Back then, ancient cultivators used to set their furnaces atop the Southern Ming Li Fire to refine elixirs, completely unafraid of the demonic flames; it must have been a divine artifact.  Although only a fragment remains, it should retain some of the artifact's power and offer some resistance to the Southern Ming Li Fire, perhaps enough to protect me.  However, retrieving it won't be easy.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction Yun Youzi indicated.</p><p>Ahead in the passage were several chambers of varying sizes. The other chambers were empty, but the deepest one housed the Southern Ming Li Fire itself.</p><p>The flames, a manifestation of the demonic fire's power, poured from the chamber, completely filling the passage, leaving no gap whatsoever.</p><p>Beyond that, nothing could be seen, only a sea of red light.</p><p>How could anyone possibly traverse the Southern Ming Li Fire to retrieve the furnace fragment under these conditions?</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that with his current cultivation level, if he were to be touched by even a few flames, he would be incinerated in an instant.</p>
