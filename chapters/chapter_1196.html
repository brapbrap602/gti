<h1>Chapter 1188: Stalemate</h1><p>The three of them sat down to divide the spoils.  </p><p>As a Nascent Soul Patriarch, the Demon Lord Pei had amassed a considerable fortune.  </p><p>Magical treasures, spiritual materials, elixirs, spirit stonesâ€”everything one could desire was present.  </p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin insisted that Qin Sang take the lion's share, and Qin Sang, without hesitation, selected a portion of items he urgently needed to replenish his Thousand Jun Ring.  </p><p>His wealth had never matched his status and cultivation level, but now, after looting a Nascent Soul cultivator, he no longer appeared destitute.  </p><p>However, even though he acquired several magical treasures, none of them were particularly satisfying. The Demon Lord Pei's life-bound treasure, though a top-grade artifact, would suffer a significant loss in power if used by someone else.  </p><p>These treasures were far inferior to the Twelve Demon Banners and the Ebony Sword, so Qin Sang decided to use them temporarily and eventually pass them on to his disciples.  </p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin divided the remaining items equally, both quite pleased with their shares.  </p><p>"Once our military merits are reported, even greater rewards await us!" Jing Lin said with a beaming smile.  </p><p>Killing a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss was no small matter, and the Two Domains Alliance had always been generous in such cases.  </p><p>Although Qin Sang was the one who delivered the killing blow, without their cooperation, it would have been nearly impossible for him to succeed. Thus, the three of them agreed to split the merits equally.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist, your sudden rise to fame has frightened both Chan Ling and the Demon Lord Tan to the point of retreating without any will to fight. The Sin Abyss will surely investigate you in secret and devise ways to target you," Jing Lin kindly reminded.  </p><p>Qin Sang wasn't overly concerned. Ambushing him wouldn't be easy.  </p><p>Of course, caution was still necessary. The myriad of divine abilities in the world were countless, and it was entirely possible to encounter an opponent who could counter him.  </p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and turned to Si Di, "My Fire Banners and thunder techniques are both lethal, so the Sin Abyss can at most prepare a few defensive measures in advance, which won't have much impact. But Fellow Daoist Si, you're different. You've exposed your life-saving technique in front of Chan Ling and Demon Lord Tan. You must be extremely careful in the future."  </p><p>Qin Sang deeply admired Si Di's decisiveness and courage.  </p><p>It was rare for a Nascent Soul Patriarch to willingly act as bait and put themselves in danger. His ability to swap places with his life-bound treasure was undoubtedly a powerful escape tool. However, once this technique was known, its effectiveness would be greatly diminished if opponents prepared countermeasures in advance.  </p><p>Hearing this, Si Di and Jing Lin suddenly burst into laughter.  </p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  </p><p>Si Di smiled and briefly explained, "Fellow Daoist Mingyue, you may not know this, but the conditions for using that technique of mine are extremely stringent. It's impossible to employ during combat. First, it requires the Cold Bell Formation, and second, I had prepared the setup here months ago to make it work. If my opponents waste their energy trying to counter this technique, I would welcome it! Moreover, with the military merits I've gained this time, I can finally exchange for a spiritual material I've long desired. Once I integrate it into the Yuejin Mirror, this treasure will undergo a qualitative transformation. At that time, I can turn their schemes against them and make them fall into another trap..."  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you've even calculated this far ahead. Truly admirable," Qin Sang remarked, inwardly marveling at how these Nascent Soul old foxes were always several steps ahead, laying trap after trap.  </p><p>"Ever since Fellow Daoist Si took command of the Threefold Pass, the Demon Lords Pei and Tan have never gained any advantage. It's not just his cultivation that's responsible!" Jing Lin praised.  </p><p>Si Di modestly waved off the compliment.  </p><p>Having fought side by side, the three of them had grown noticeably closer. Si Di and Jing Lin became even more cordial toward Qin Sang, and they tactfully avoided prying into the secrets of his Demon Banners and thunder techniques.  </p><p>Guided by Qin Sang, the conversation turned to the Nether Crystal Tower and the Soul-Severing Spike.  </p><p>"Previously, the Mystic Shield Talisman couldn't completely block the Soul-Severing Spike, but it bought us enough time to evade. However, Demon Lord Pei used some secret technique that greatly enhanced the spike's power. This is a serious issue, and I must inform Fellow Daoist Zhenyi immediately," Jing Lin said gravely.  </p><p>His injuries were still healing, and his tone was filled with apprehension when speaking of the Soul-Severing Spike.  </p><p>With the Mystic Shield Talisman rendered ineffective, the Two Domains Alliance needed to quickly find stronger defensive measures.  </p><p>Si Di added, "This kind of Soul-Severing Spike likely can't be used casually. I noticed that Demon Lord Pei seemed abnormal at the final moment. Both of you were closer and probably saw more clearly than I did."  </p><p>They both looked at Qin Sang.  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, "Fellow Daoist Si is correct. Before Demon Lord Pei unleashed the Soul-Severing Spike, he aged several hundred years in an instant, as if most of his vitality had been drained."  </p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Jing Lin's expression suddenly changed. "Demon Lord Pei sacrificed himself to the Nether Crystal Tower! That thing is indeed an unmitigated evil artifact!"  </p><p>"Given how much Nascent Soul old foxes value their lives, they wouldn't willingly sacrifice themselves unless absolutely necessary. However, we must prepare thoroughly. Demon Lord Pei, even in a hurry, managed to injure both of you. If someone were to selflessly plan such an attack, who knows how much destruction they could cause?" Si Di said solemnly.  </p><p>...  </p><p>The three of them discussed in secret for a full hour.  </p><p>Qin Sang inquired in detail about the Sin Abyss, especially the Nether Crystal Tower, but he found no information that matched what he was seeking.  </p><p>After seeing Jing Lin and Si Di off, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his thoughts restless.  </p><p>His intuition told him that the Nether Crystal Tower was likely connected to the Ancient Demons, but without any evidence, he couldn't bring it up openly.  </p><p>"After such a crushing defeat, the Threefold Pass should remain quiet for a while. It's time to visit Shiqu Mountain and see my senior sister. No matter what, I must secure a retreat for myself first..." Qin Sang thought to himself.  </p><p>The Demon Lord killed Nascent Soul cultivators as easily as cutting grass. Qin Sang didn't mind contributing to the fight against the Sin Abyss, but he had no intention of sacrificing his life in the process.  </p><p>As for fleeing to the ends of the earth in fear, that wasn't necessary either.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss wasn't overwhelmingly powerful, and there might be more to the situation than met the eye.  </p><p>...  </p><p>After the battle, the Threefold Pass returned to peace, and they finally received news from Shiqu Mountain.  </p><p>This time, the Sin Abyss had launched an almost full-scale assault, with a massive show of force.  </p><p>The Sin Abyss had set up decoys, with Shiqu Mountain and several other key locations as their primary targets. Fortunately, the Two Domains Alliance had prepared in advance and summoned the Demon Kings to assist.  </p><p>Initially caught off guard, they gradually stabilized their defenses as reinforcements arrived, holding their ground.  </p><p>The most uplifting news was undoubtedly the Threefold Pass, despite being at a slight disadvantage, managing to kill a Nascent Soul cultivator from the enemy side.  </p><p>The name "Demon King Mingyue" quickly spread, rising to prominence.  </p><p>A few days later, Qin Sang approached Jing Lin and Si Di, informing them of his intention to visit Shiqu Mountain, citing the need to retrieve the little demons from the Thousand Bamboo Sea.  </p><p>Si Di, having already exchanged for the treasure he desired, was in high spirits and confidently said, "Chan Ling is a coward. Without thoroughly understanding your abilities, he wouldn't dare act rashly. Fellow Daoist, rest assured. Once you bring them here, we will take good care of them."  </p><p>...  </p><p>Shiqu Mountain.  </p><p>Originally a major city of the Heavenly Path Alliance, the city had been evacuated of all mortals, leaving the vast metropolis desolate.  </p><p>Shiqu Mountain was heavily guarded.  </p><p>After identifying himself, Qin Sang was allowed entry.  </p><p>A Core Formation cultivator led Qin Sang into a hall within the city lord's residence and quickly went to inform Patriarch Zhenyi.  </p><p>Patriarch Zhenyi personally oversaw Shiqu Mountain, while the Netherworld Demon Lord was stationed at Wangdong City.  </p><p>Other figures, such as Qin Sang's senior sister Qing Jun, were also at Shiqu Mountain, while Dongyang Bo assisted the Netherworld Demon Lord at Wangdong City. The Heavenly Path Alliance's experts were similarly divided between the two locations.</p>
