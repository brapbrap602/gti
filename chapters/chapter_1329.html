Chapter 1321: Spirit Embryo

Within the mountain within a mountain, the nature of the Flaming Fire Energy underwent a strange transformation. The mountain itself was nearly transparent, allowing one to clearly see the flickering flames at its core. Strangely, these flames were blue. It felt as though they were walking through a sea of fire. The Frost Jade Pendant could no longer shield them from the fire's toxicity, so Qin Sang activated the Fire Lotus Seed, forming a layer of fire armor around his body.

The aura of the Demonic Fire emanated outward, causing the blue flames to shrink back in fear. Seeing this, Bing Han felt a surge of joy. The Demonic Fire's intimidation of the Flaming Fire was even stronger than she had anticipated.

Soon, Qin Sang saw the Fire Jade. This was the core of the mountain within a mountain, a small space where the Flaming Vein Energy was so dense it resembled a thick, blue liquid, like a clear spring. However, the "water" in this spring was pure Flaming Fire Energy. At the center of the fire spring floated a blue jade the size of a human head—this was the Fire Jade Bing Han had mentioned.

The Fire Jade was flat and round, floating on the surface of the fire spring, having been tempered by the Flaming Fire for countless years. Its surface rose and fell rhythmically, and the fluctuations Qin Sang had sensed earlier were emanating from it. It appeared to be incredibly soft in texture.

Qin Sang noticed that around the Fire Jade was the phantom of a square cauldron, perfectly enclosing the jade within it. The cauldron was clearly not a natural formation. With a quick glance, Qin Sang spotted a spirit array nearby, and the cauldron was a manifestation of the array's power.

"This Spirit Nurturing Grand Array was personally set up by our ancestor. Its first purpose is to absorb the Flaming Vein Energy from the earth, accelerating the birth of the Fire Spirit. Its second purpose is to suppress and subdue the Fire Spirit. However, this Fire Spirit is too unique and cannot be suppressed by the array alone…" Bing Han explained as she stepped forward.

With a light tap of her jade-like finger in the air, the square cauldron trembled slightly. The Fire Spirit immediately reacted. The fire spring rippled, the Flaming Vein beneath the ground stirred, and waves of energy surged forth, causing the mountain within a mountain to shake as if the Fire Spirit was roaring in anger. This was the fluctuation Qin Sang had sensed earlier, but here it was far more intense. Flaming Fire Energy from all directions rushed toward them.

Bing Han quickly withdrew her hand, and the Fire Spirit calmed down. Qin Sang examined the Fire Jade and asked, "How confident are you, Fellow Daoist? If we find a similar Fire Spirit outside, could we use this method to refine a spirit treasure?"

Bing Han didn't hold back and explained in detail, "We can't be certain until the spirit treasure is fully formed! Even if you find a Fire Spirit, it would be difficult to replicate this process. The unique terrain of this mountain within a mountain, combined with the arrangements made by our ancestor, is what allowed this special Fire Spirit to be born."

Qin Sang nodded in disappointment. The Void Spirit Sect had been laying the groundwork since its founding, a process that had taken an incredibly long time. He couldn't afford to wait that long. Rather than relying on this method, it would be better to focus on mastering the art of artifact refinement, ensuring that the true spirit of Wandering Cloud could safely merge with the Ebony Sword and undergo its transformation.

"Once Fellow Daoist Xiang recovers, we will begin. During this time, Fellow Daoist Qin, you should thoroughly study the artifact refinement techniques in the jade slip. If any unexpected situations arise during the refinement process, we will need your assistance," Bing Han said as she handed Qin Sang a jade slip.

Qin Sang took the jade slip and smiled. "So even if I hadn't asked, I would have had the chance to learn these refinement techniques. This time, it seems I've come out ahead."

Bing Han replied seriously, "These refinement techniques are only a small part of our sect's treasures. Once this is done, I will grant you access to all our典籍. By then, you will surely feel that this journey was well worth it."

After inspecting the Fire Jade, the two flew out of the mountain. Qin Sang returned to the Fire Aversion Pavilion to study the contents of the jade slip. After a quick first read, Qin Sang felt as though a veil had been lifted from his eyes. He couldn't help but sigh, realizing the vast difference between his solitary efforts and the accumulated knowledge of generations.

He had initially entered the world of artifact refinement by studying the insights of a Void Spirit Sect Golden Core cultivator. After arriving at the Canglang Sea, he had also collected various texts on refinement, but they were disorganized, and it was difficult to obtain the core techniques of other sects. When faced with problems, Qin Sang had to rely on his own ingenuity, and while his cultivation and powerful Demonic Fire had allowed him to achieve some success, the contents of the jade slip made him realize just how far he still was from being a true refinement master.

Bing Han had given strict orders, so no one disturbed him. Over the next few days, Qin Sang immersed himself in the jade slip. It opened up a whole new world for him, and many of his previous difficulties were resolved. He became so engrossed that he wished he could immediately delve into the Void Spirit Sect's library.

A month later, Qin Sang, who had been deeply immersed in the art of refinement, was awakened by a restriction. Bing Han and Xiang Qing were waiting outside. Qin Sang stepped out of the Fire Aversion Pavilion, and after a brief exchange, the three of them flew toward the mountain peak.

Returning to the mountain within a mountain, Qin Sang and Xiang Qing took positions on either side of the fire spring, while Bing Han floated above the square cauldron. The three exchanged glances, then sat down cross-legged and closed their eyes.

For a long time, there was no movement. The fire spring remained calm, with only the Fire Jade gently pulsating. Suddenly, Bing Han opened her eyes and stared at the Fire Jade. Her fingers moved like wheels, and a series of hand seals flowed like water toward the cauldron.

Qin Sang and Xiang Qing also began to move. They had already agreed on a plan, so there was no need for communication. Each knew their role.

The Fire Lotus Seed flew out from Qin Sang's brow. He focused his gaze on the spirit array, and a strand of Demonic Fire separated from the Fire Lotus Seed. This Demonic Fire had already been subdued by the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" and was completely obedient to Qin Sang. It floated like a black ribbon, gently landing on the spirit array.

Without a sound, the Demonic Fire merged with the spirit array, spreading along the array's runes toward the cauldron. This process required extremely precise control; otherwise, the Demonic Fire and the spirit array would clash, ruining everything.

At the same time, Xiang Qing extended his hands above the spirit array. Green Sun Demonic Fire surged from his body, flowing toward his hands, following the same method as Qin Sang. If any Green Sun Demon Sect disciples were present, they would have noticed that Xiang Qing's Green Sun Demonic Fire was different from theirs, having undergone changes after merging with the Ancestral Sacred Fire.

The two spirit fires each occupied half of the spirit array. Just as they were about to touch the cauldron, they simultaneously stopped and looked up at Bing Han.

In the next moment, Bing Han completed her final hand seal. Her jade-like hand pressed against the cauldron, and with a light tap, a soft *snap* echoed through the air. This seemingly insignificant sound marked the beginning of a transformation.

The Fire Spirit instinctively sensed danger and immediately began to retaliate. The surrounding Flaming Vein Energy was stirred up, surging toward them. The fluctuations returned, and the ground shook violently!

Bing Han's figure trembled slightly, but she remained largely unaffected, as the impact was blocked by Qin Sang and Xiang Qing. She ignored everything happening around her, her palm firmly pressed against the cauldron, using it as a furnace to refine the Fire Jade!

Qin Sang and Xiang Qing divided their attention, simultaneously resisting the Flaming Fire Energy and fully activating their spirit fires. The two spirit fires merged beneath the cauldron, burning fiercely, their auras radiating without restraint.

At this moment, the square cauldron had transformed into a blazing furnace!
