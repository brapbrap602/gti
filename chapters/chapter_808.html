<h1>Chapter 800: Foundation of Cultivation</h1><p>Chapter 800: Foundation of Cultivation</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique draws upon the power of the celestial stars to temper the body.</p><p>According to the text, while drawing upon the power of the celestial stars during cultivation, a sinister and chaotic force will also be introduced into the body.</p><p>This force is called Stellar煞 energy, coexisting with the celestial stellar energy.  Those whose primordial spirit is invaded by Stellar煞 energy all meet a terrible end, driven to madness, losing their intellect completely, and finally transforming into indescribable beings before dying a miserable death.</p><p>However, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* can use the bloodline power within a demonic beast to refine the Stellar煞 energy, obtaining pure celestial stellar energy to temper the body.  Simultaneously, the cultivator can also benefit from misfortune, gradually refining their bloodline during the cultivation process.</p><p>This is the greatest key to this technique.</p><p>Human cultivators lack the bloodline of demonic cultivators, unable to refine the Stellar煞 energy. Cultivating this technique is tantamount to seeking death, but this gave Qin Sang an opportunity.</p><p>Protected by the jade Buddha, he should be able to resist the Stellar煞 energy invading his primordial spirit.</p><p>The jade Buddha has never let him down through numerous experiences.</p><p>When demonic cultivators cultivate *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, they must first activate their bloodline power to refine it, not daring to leave even a trace of Stellar煞 energy. The cultivation speed is greatly related to the strength of the bloodline power, which is also the demonic cultivator's innate talent.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't need to divert his attention to refine the Stellar煞 energy, which is equivalent to having the top-tier talent among demonic cultivators. His cultivation speed will be much faster than that of demonic cultivators.</p><p>Of course, in this way, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* will become a purely body-refinement technique in his hands. But if his understanding of the technique is correct, even a purely body-refinement technique would still be top-tier, the best Qin Sang has ever seen, worthy of the name "Heavenly Demon"!</p><p>Upon discovering this, Qin Sang was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>But he wasn't blinded by joy. After all, this is a top-tier cultivation technique created by a demonic cultivator, with no precedent for human cultivators. The jade Buddha can resist the invasion of Stellar煞 energy, but the technique itself might have other effects on the cultivator.</p><p>For example, when starting the technique, at the moment the mind connects with the stars, one must constantly visualize the form of a Heavenly Demon. Demonic cultivators visualize their ancestors to determine their path. What should he visualize?</p><p>Also, Qin Sang currently only has the first four layers of *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>If his understanding is correct, they correspond to the first four levels of cultivation realms: Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul.</p><p>In his view, the fourth layer is already very obscure and needs careful understanding. He's unsure if randomly visualizing a demonic beast would cause unpredictable changes.</p><p>Qin Sang's understanding of the demonic language is only superficial, barely enough to understand. What he's understood so far might be inaccurate, so he doesn't dare to try rashly.</p><p>Unfortunately, what follows is shrouded in mist.</p><p>This suggests that this technique is complete, but his cultivation is insufficient to penetrate the mist.  This makes it even harder for Qin Sang to abandon it; *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* might be more than just a path to the Divine Transformation stage!</p><p>However, before deciding to cultivate *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, he needs to learn the demonic language and understand the entire technique. Otherwise, if an accident happens, he will regret it.</p><p>In any case, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* did give Qin Sang a glimmer of hope.</p><p>After obtaining the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, Qin Sang has seen countless cultivation techniques over a hundred years. Mount Shao Hua alone has a collection of over a hundred, but besides Wu Shang's  罡煞冲丹 and the Witch Clan's soul insect secret techniques, very few are suitable for him.</p><p>In addition, his talent is limited, and he doesn't have the energy to focus on others.</p><p>*Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* might be another technique compatible with him, and it's a body-refinement technique, not conflicting with the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, allowing him to cultivate both simultaneously.</p><p>The reason these two techniques are suitable for him is largely due to the jade Buddha.</p><p>It can even be said that his cultivation path is based on the jade Buddha.</p><p>The significance of *Heavenly Demon Transformation* goes beyond that.</p><p>Because he's been unable to find news of the Ten Divine Trees, the Ebony Sword cannot be upgraded, and Qin Sang's cultivation is in danger of stagnation.</p><p>Without increasing his strength, he cannot pass the Sword Path trial.  Beyond the Sword Path, there might be an ancient teleportation array. Without finding the ancient teleportation array, he cannot return to the Xiao Han domain, search for the Endless Blood Mulberry, and the situation will become a deadlock.</p><p>Furthermore, treasures and soul insects will be sealed within the Sword Path; he can only rely on himself.</p><p>Body refinement is an excellent choice.</p><p>By cultivating both body and techniques, his strength will more than double.</p><p>Without reaching the peak of the third stage of *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, he can already possess the strength of a late-stage peak cultivator, giving Qin Sang another path to take and temporarily eliminating the need to desperately search for the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>"I can learn the demonic language from knowledgeable seniors on Tian Xing Island, and then study this technique carefully. There's no precedent for this technique, so I can only explore it myself…"</p><p>Qin Sang put away the technique and played with the bone flute. A flash of inspiration suddenly struck him, making him realize something unusual.</p><p>Undeniably, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* and *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, even in ancient times, were top-tier cultivation techniques, one for demons and one for humans.</p><p>These two cultivation techniques share a similar fate.</p><p>He only managed to gather them by chance after arriving at the Canglang Sea. Otherwise, the three bone flute fragments might never have been reunited.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He'd always harbored a doubt.  Both the Xiaohan region and the Canglang Sea are rife with legends of the ancient cultivation world, all showcasing the power of ancient cultivators, including tales of ascension to immortality.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators are considered top-tier experts.  Transformative God cultivators are nowhere to be found, and even higher realms exist only in legends.</p><p>The path to immortality is severed, and the top-tier cultivation techniques have all been scattered.</p><p>Was all this coincidence?</p><p>Or was it deliberate?</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, his thoughts swirling.  But with his low cultivation level, his biggest goal remains forming his Nascent Soul; dwelling on this is unproductive.  On the bright side, if the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* and *Tianyao Huaxing* are scattered across different locations instead of being fragmented, he still has a chance to collect them.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>After seeing the *Tianyao Huaxing*, Qin Sang immediately set off for Tianxing Island.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang planned to live as a solitary cultivator, renting a cave dwelling on Tianxing Island. He has too much to do and needs to stay on the island to gather resources.</p><p>The Inner Sea is safer than the Demon Sea.  Qin Sang flew solo and encountered no problems reaching Tianxing Island.</p><p>He couldn't use his token from the Qiongyu Trading Company's manager, but thankfully he'd anticipated this. He’d fabricated a solitary cultivator identity and used it for a while in the Demon Sea, and now it came in handy.</p><p>The Canglang Sea is far larger than the Xiaohan region, but since most of it is ocean, islands with spiritual veins are largely controlled by major factions.</p><p>After the truce between the righteous and demonic paths, they joined forces to control most of the sea, dividing it into four regions and establishing rules.</p><p>Even those outside the righteous and demonic paths find it less troublesome if their disciples reveal their identities when traveling.</p>
