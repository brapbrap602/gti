<h1>Chapter 1986: Trivial Matters</h1><p>The mountain peak reached the clouds, bathed in brilliant sunlight.</p><p>Towering peaks and vast, misty waters stretched out below.</p><p>Qin Sang raised a finger towards the mountain, and fissures immediately appeared, rock and earth crumbling away. Some coalesced into grotesque stones, others formed sheer cliffs. Suddenly, torrents gushed forth, waterfalls cascaded down, sculpting the mountain into a wondrous peak of immortal grandeur.</p><p>A gentle breeze scattered seeds across the mountain slopes.</p><p>Spiritual Qi transformed into a sweet rain, nourishing the earth.</p><p>Tender shoots sprouted from the barren land, teeming with life.</p><p>Small beasts, shifted from elsewhere, appeared, their initial fear quickly replaced by the allure of the rich Spiritual Qi. They chirped and chattered, excitedly running and playing amongst the peaks.</p><p>The entire scene came to life.</p><p>Qin Sang, with a wave of his hand, commanded the elements.</p><p>Spiritual beasts gathered, auspicious clouds swirled, sweeping away the gloomy aura of the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>The ghostly realm transformed into a celestial paradise!</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers flickered, beams of light shot out like arrows, morphing into banners that plunged into the earth, forming a protective formation around the mountain.</p><p>As the formation settled, a thin mist rose from the ground, obscuring the view. From outside, only a hazy landscape could be seen, adding to the air of mystery and enchantment.</p><p>Patriarch Ming Hu's former cave was relocated to the summit. Aside from a few murals, it bore little resemblance to its original state.</p><p>After adding a few finishing touches, Qin Sang, satisfied with his work, imparted the method of entering and exiting the mountain gate to Ling Shi and the others. He instructed them to travel to the Fire Domain and bring back the demonic soldiers from his previous dwelling, before vanishing into the cave, his gaze fixed on the murals.</p><p>……</p><p>Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>The current Azure Goat Temple was a far cry from its former self.</p><p>The mountain upon which the temple stood was raised ten thousand feet, now the main peak, with the main altar situated at its summit.</p><p>The surrounding terrain was also reshaped, taking on the aura of a prominent immortal sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had invested considerable effort in diverting spiritual veins and establishing formations, laying the foundation for the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>This place was inherently less blessed than the Fallen Soul Abyss, but with centuries of nurturing, it could also become a sacred ground for cultivation.</p><p>Down below, everything remained as it was.</p><p>Seven Rows Village, the schoolhouse, Qinggui Town, Jin County…</p><p>Mortals remained unaware of the changes. The old temple remained in the mortal realm, and Yu Lang would frequently arrange for his disciples to provide medical aid to the villagers.</p><p>A new temple would be built on the summit, but for now, there were only a few thatched huts to house Yu Lang's family.</p><p>Inside one of the huts, blueprints lay before Yu Lang and Tai Yi, outlining their vision for the temple. They were discussing and making adjustments.</p><p>Tao Teng sat at the doorway, leaning against the frame, gazing out at the mountains.</p><p>The main peak offered a breathtaking panorama, with vast mountains and rivers stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Clad in simple cloth, a stalk of grass between his teeth, he appeared listless. No one would guess that he was once a powerful general.</p><p>Finalizing a detail, Yu Lang turned to see Tao Teng's expression and sighed inwardly. "Have you made up your mind?" he asked.</p><p>"Will the Azure Goat Temple accept me?"</p><p>Tao Teng looked up and countered.</p><p>"Master said he would no longer involve himself in the temple's affairs. You have no home to return to. Could I possibly turn you away?"</p><p>Yu Lang walked to the doorway, gazing eastward. "But you are Cloud Immortal's personal disciple. Wouldn't switching sects be a betrayal of your master without his consent?"</p><p>"Disciple?"</p><p>Tao Teng gave a self-deprecating, slightly bitter laugh. "Why didn't Master take me with him?"</p><p>He was unaware that, upon returning to his sect and learning the truth, Cloud Immortal had broken out in a cold sweat, retreating back to his mountain and vowing never to set foot in the mortal realm again.</p><p>Knowing the knot in his friend's heart, Yu Lang said, "Cloud Immortal taught you Dao techniques and guided your cultivation. Though he may have used you, he bore you no ill will. He left you a transmission talisman before leaving, which shows he acknowledged you as his disciple. To be accepted into Cloud Metropolis Sect, as a direct disciple of a Soul Formation cultivator, is a dream for many."</p><p>Tao Teng gazed at the sky in silence, then glanced back at the land of Yan Kingdom, murmuring, "Cloud Metropolis Sect is too far from the mortal realm."</p><p>Yu Lang sighed inwardly.  Those with different paths cannot make plans together. This was perhaps the case here.</p><p>Tao Teng was his closest friend, and they shared the same aspirations. He also wished for Tao Teng to stay, but he didn't know which choice would be better for him.  It was a decision Tao Teng had to make himself.</p><p>"You should still visit Cloud Immortal. Senior Tai Yi and I will be visiting Cloud Metropolis Sect soon. You should come with us," Yu Lang said.</p><p>Tao Teng gave a noncommittal nod.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light flew up from the foot of the mountain and landed outside the temple. It was Sha Jiayu.</p><p>Sha Jiayu first bowed to Tai Yi, then handed Yu Lang a jade slip. "I've travelled the mortal realm these past days and found dozens of children with excellent aptitudes. I've placed them in the temple below.  You can assess them and accept them into the sect."</p><p>The jade slip meticulously detailed the children's backgrounds and Sha Jiayu's assessments, reflecting his painstaking efforts.</p><p>Yu Lang and Tai Yi exchanged a glance. "Elder Brother, you have been instrumental in swiftly managing all these matters.  Both Senior Tai Yi and I wish to invite you to join the Azure Goat Temple. What are your thoughts? If you wish to revive the Sha Clan, you could also become a guest elder…"</p><p>Sha Jiayu shook his head. "Do you remember what I said before? Once you were settled, I would travel abroad. Now is the time for me to leave. I came here to bid you farewell."</p><p>He paused, then hesitantly added, "In the future, I hope you can look after the Yin Clan."</p><p>Asking a Foundation Establishment cultivator to look after a clan with a Nascent Soul cultivator seemed absurd. However, Yu Lang was the current Temple Master of the Azure Goat Temple, and even the Sect Master of Cloud Metropolis Sect would treat him with respect.</p><p>The Azure Goat Temple observed the mortal realm but did not interfere in the cultivation world.  However, who would dare to disregard the Azure Goat Temple?</p><p>A single word from him would be enough to deter anyone from provoking the Yin Clan.</p><p>Yu Lang understood Sha Jiayu's deep concern for him and felt reluctant to see him go. "The Yin Clan sent a message yesterday, saying they would visit in three days.  Elder Brother, why not wait a little longer?"</p><p>He knew that Sha Jiayu felt guilty about using Nian Hui, and Nian Hui still harbored feelings for him.</p><p>They were meant to be together, yet circumstances and entangled grievances kept them apart. It was a lamentable situation.</p><p>Perhaps a face-to-face conversation could resolve their misunderstandings and allow them to start anew.</p><p>"No need!"</p><p>Sha Jiayu, ashamed to face Nian Hui, bowed in farewell, turned, and soared into the sky on his flying light.</p><p>The light disappeared over the horizon.</p><p>Yu Lang thought to himself, the emotional entanglements of the mortal world are truly a tangled mess, and cultivators are just as caught up in them, unable to escape.</p><p>I wonder if Master can unravel them?</p><p>"When he figures things out, he'll definitely come back, perhaps within a hundred years," Tai Yi patted Yu Lang's shoulder, stepped out of the hut, and walked towards the summit.</p><p>A stone palace was carved out of the summit to house the main altar, a forbidden area of the Azure Goat Temple.</p><p>Tai Yi arrived to find the door of the stone palace ajar. His face lit up with joy. He brushed off nonexistent dust and bowed respectfully. "Greetings, Lord Emissary!"</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tai Yi as he entered and asked in a deep voice, "Are you willing to join the Five Thunders Court?"</p><p>Tai Yi's heart leaped. Overwhelmed with joy, he prostrated himself and exclaimed, "Disciple is willing!"</p><p>After gaining sentience, he had yearned for the Celestial Court. How could he refuse?</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang activated the Thunder Altar. The Five Thunders Court Seal within the altar trembled slightly, emitting a golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice resonated within the stone palace, booming like thunder, filled with celestial authority.</p><p>"I, Emissary of the Five Thunders Court, wielding the Five Thunders Court Seal, decree by the authority of the Five Thunders Court.  Disciple Tai Yi, for your deeds in slaying evil, vanquishing demons, and safeguarding the mortal realm, by virtue of your merits, I hereby bestow upon you the rank of Fourth Grade, Jade Palace High Minister of the Five Thunders!"</p><p>With each word Qin Sang uttered, the golden light pulsed, forming gleaming golden characters in the air.</p><p>As the Emissary of the Five Thunders Court, he had the authority to bestow titles.</p><p>Within the Celestial Court, positions above Fourth Grade were appointed by the Nine Heavens Golden Palace.  Qin Sang could only bestow titles up to Fourth Grade.</p><p>In truth, during the Celestial Court's prime, Tai Yi's cultivation level would not have qualified him for a Fourth Grade position, as the Emissary of the Five Thunders Court was only Third Grade.</p><p>As the last golden character solidified, the golden light flowed, and the golden decree transformed into a scroll, flying towards Tai Yi.</p><p>Tai Yi's long-cherished wish was fulfilled, and he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang was the Emissary of the Five Thunders Court, appointed by the Celestial Master. The decree he issued was recognized as legitimate by the Celestial Court. Any other Celestial Court cultivator who encountered Tai Yi would acknowledge his title.</p><p>Tai Yi held a title but had no specific duties or assignments.  This was because the Five Thunders Court existed in name only. Qin Sang had no troops under his command, and thus, no tasks to assign him.</p><p>Qin Sang was still contemplating whether to establish a court here, build an altar, and impart teachings.</p><p>He didn't know when the Celestial Court would be restored, and the opportunity to establish a true court remained slim.</p><p>"Cultivate here from now on. Take these and comprehend them thoroughly.  They should greatly advance your cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang handed Tai Yi a jade slip and a mustard seed bag.</p><p>The jade slip contained insights he had gleaned from the Thunder Altar, while the mustard seed bag held various spiritual objects that would aid Tai Yi's cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang was preparing for his departure.</p><p>He planned to leave Tai Yi behind.  He had to take the two demon lords with him, and if he also took Tai Yi, the remaining forces would be too weak. Qin Sang wasn't sure when he would find the Celestial Court, and having Tai Yi follow him around wouldn't be as beneficial as staying behind to safeguard the Azure Goat Temple and cultivate with the aid of the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Moreover, after Qin Sang's departure, no one else at the Azure Goat Temple could operate the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Tai Yi, having gained sentience from a thunder talisman, had a natural affinity for thunder. If he could reach the late Soul Formation stage and preside over the main altar, he might be able to activate the Thunder Oath Ritual.</p><p>Of course, its power would be less than if Qin Sang operated it himself, but it should still be enough to threaten Void Refinement cultivators and deter any evildoers, ensuring peace in the region.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang needed to help Tai Yi advance his cultivation quickly.</p><p>Tai Yi accepted the jade slip and was immediately engrossed in its contents, lost in contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disturb him. He summoned Yu Lang, offered some guidance, then left the Azure Goat Temple, heading north.</p><p>……</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the location of his former dwelling, released his aura, and waited quietly. A streak of purple light swiftly approached.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder bowed and said, "Since the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar is here, let's relocate the other ruins."</p><p>They immediately split up and set to work.</p><p>Qin Sang went west, Solitary Cloud Elder east.</p><p>He knew the locations of the various ruins like the back of his hand. He arrived at a volcanic zone on the westernmost edge of the Fire Domain. The ruins lay beneath a volcano.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered over the crater, formed a claw with his hand, and grasped downwards.  The magma within the volcano erupted violently.</p><p>Once the eruption subsided, Qin Sang channeled the world's energy, uprooting several volcanoes. Then, the ruins slowly rose from the magma.</p><p>These ruins were a stone disc larger than a mountain, its edges riddled with gaps. Countless strange inscriptions covered the disc, emanating ancient, forbidden fluctuations.</p><p>After unearthing the disc, Qin Sang headed north, the disc following behind him like a mountain in flight.</p><p>He relocated each set of ruins in this manner, returning to his former dwelling.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder was faster and was already waiting there.  Together, they fixed the ruins in the sky, their enormous shadows blanketing the land like a meteor shower.</p><p>Below, the magma churned as the ruins were moved into place. Qin Sang retrieved the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar and embedded it within the ruins.</p><p>The core of the ruins, which Qin Sang had separated, had been destroyed during his battle with Patriarch Ming Hu.</p><p>Although he had copied the ancient restrictions, restoring them wouldn't be easy.</p><p>For now, he would leave the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar aside.</p><p>Qin Sang and Solitary Cloud Elder began to piece the ruins together.</p><p>They sat cross-legged in the air, communicating through sound transmission. Although they weren't formation masters, they both had unique insights into the Dao of restrictions.</p><p>After some discussion, they both gained new understanding and gradually began to grasp the underlying principles. They joined forces to manipulate one of the ruins.</p><p>The ruins plummeted to the ground, landing beside the original ruins. The two sets of ruins didn't touch, and there was a large gap between them. However, the moment this set of ruins landed, the restrictions within both sets of ruins exhibited subtle fluctuations, resonating with each other.</p><p>Then the second, the third…</p><p>Five years passed unnoticed.</p><p>For five years, they remained motionless, manipulating the ruins into different positions, like piecing together a fragmented puzzle.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Solitary Cloud Elder's efforts, all the ruins were on the ground, scattered haphazardly.</p><p>From above, it resembled a city ravaged by war and floods, riddled with holes.</p><p>But in Qin Sang and Solitary Cloud Elder's eyes, these fragments followed a certain pattern and could be considered a whole.</p><p>After five long years, they moved for the first time, floating to the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>With the ruins as a reference, they could finally discern some clues from the pillar.</p><p>They pondered for a long time, exchanged a glance, and then flew to opposite ends of the ruins, jointly channeling the world's energy.</p><p>The weather changed dramatically.</p><p>The ancient restrictions within the ruins were triggered one after another. Golden sparks flickered amidst the fiery hurricanes.</p><p>The sparks multiplied, and the fragments of the ruins transformed into gold, connecting into a single piece.</p><p>A muffled sound echoed from the ruins. Suddenly, a golden light shot skyward, and a golden dragon was born within the light.</p><p>More accurately, it was a dragon-shaped outline.</p><p>This golden dragon, with majestic horns and claws, lay coiled on the ground, poised to soar into the heavens and command the wind and clouds.</p><p>The fragments of the ruins formed parts of its body, and the glittering sparks were its shining scales.</p><p>Its body was incomplete, yet its majesty remained undiminished.</p><p>Then, a golden dragon phantom rose into the air, roaring and clawing at the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Its body coiled around the pillar, its head raised high, its maw wide open as it roared towards the heavens.</p><p>Unfortunately, this awe-inspiring sight lasted only a fleeting moment before the dragon phantom vanished.</p><p>This dragon phantom, embodying a certain transformation of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation, was the key to comprehending the formation, precisely what the Clear Sky Sect needed.  Qin Sang had recorded the entire process.</p><p>He would present it to the Clear Sky Sect along with the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Solitary Cloud Elder bid farewell. "I have an appointment with Fellow Daoist Yu from the Ancient Grain Garden. I must leave now."</p><p>……</p><p>After seeing Solitary Cloud Elder off, Qin Sang returned to his new dwelling, sealed his cave, and retrieved Patriarch Ming Hu's belongings.</p>
