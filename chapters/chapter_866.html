<h1>Chapter 858: Hunting the Beast</h1><p>Chapter 858: Hunting the Beast</p><p>The shopkeeper left after receiving his payment.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed the young man.</p><p>He was handsome, his cultivation already at the late Core Formation stage, his aura subtle, even more unreadable than Yue Xiangu.</p><p>More importantly, there was no trace of demonic energy on him. This meant either he had already used a spirit herb to remove his demonic aura, or he hadn't taken a Demonic Pill, instead achieving Core Formation through self-cultivation.</p><p>In recent years, among the Core Formation masters Qin Sang had encountered, very few were like this young man.</p><p>To resist the temptation of Demonic Pills, one needed not only exceptional talent but also unwavering willpower. The young man's strength must surpass other cultivators at the same level.</p><p>"Fang has been troubled, unable to personally go to Tianxing Island to meet with you. I can only trouble you to make the trip. Please don't mind," the young man surnamed Fang said, bowing.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed freely, "Daoist Fang, you're too kind. As long as the matter can be accomplished, it's nothing for Qin to make a trip."</p><p>"Daoist Qin is straightforward! Then Fang will be frank. Fang has a pressing matter and is searching for powerful helpers.  The Daoists I previously invited encountered an accident and cannot go. It was the shopkeeper who recommended Daoist Qin..."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang spoke eloquently, explaining the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. After listening, he looked towards the mountaintop and said, "I wonder how many Daoists Daoist Fang has invited, or is it just the two of us?"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang shook his head. "Several other Daoists are cultivating on the mountaintop. They are the helpers I invited and will go with us. If Daoist Qin agrees to help, I will introduce you to them."</p><p>"Qin is indeed interested,"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "But Qin knows nothing of Daoist Fang's objective, so it's hard to make a decision."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang smiled, "There's nothing to hide, actually. Fang's objective is simple: to ask several Daoists to help me hunt a beast."</p><p>"Hunt a beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and frowned, "Is it in the Demon Sea?"</p><p>The current Demon Sea was akin to a dragon's lair and tiger's den; he had barely escaped and didn't want to fall back in.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang shook his head, "Not the Demon Sea. The beast is in our inland sea. The situation in the Demon Sea is well known, Fang wouldn't risk his life for a single beast."</p><p>That was good news. Qin Sang was an expert hunter, even having collaborated to kill a late Core Formation giant turtle.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, looking the young man up and down, "With Daoist Fang's cultivation, an ordinary beast shouldn't be a problem, right? Could it be a late Core Formation demon?"</p><p>Such a powerful demon was not easy to find even in the Demon Sea. Even if encountered, escape would be the priority, not hunting.</p><p>There are certainly many outside the Great Waste Island now; it just depends on one's hunting skills.</p><p>Powerful bloodline demons could even give Yuan Ying Masters a hard time. If the young man surnamed Fang's target was such a beast, it was no wonder he needed help.</p><p>"Correct. The beast Fang is targeting is indeed a late Core Formation demon, with unique talents and extraordinary abilities, far surpassing ordinary demons. To ensure success, Fang has also prepared a spirit array. Those other Daoists are currently practicing the array's formations..."</p><p>But when Qin Sang pressed further, the young man surnamed Fang refused to reveal what kind of beast it was.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, don't ask anymore. Fang will not say until the very end,"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang said decisively, "That beast is very rare, possessing a spirit item crucial for Fang's cultivation. Because of this, Fang is willing to pay such a high price to ask you Daoists for help.  After the matter is complete, the beast's corpse belongs to me, and you may not take a single thing!"</p><p>The reward offered by the young man surnamed Fang disappointed Qin Sang; it was only one high-grade spirit stone.</p><p>"Is the beast in the North Sea? A round trip might take several months. To travel so far for a single high-grade spirit stone…"</p><p>Qin Sang showed hesitation.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang showed displeasure, "It's just hunting a beast. Daoist Qin only needs to manage the array; how many spirit stones do you want?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the young man and smiled bitterly, "Qin needs at least six high-grade spirit stones."</p><p>"Six!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang frowned, "Never mind that Fang doesn't have that many high-grade spirit stones; even if he did, he wouldn't spend so much on a single beast.  Fang has invited more than just one Daoist.  He probably couldn't afford it even if he spent everything he owned! Let's put it this way… Fang is currently short-handed. If Daoist Qin can fully cooperate with Fang in hunting that beast, after it's done, I can give you an extra one, forging a good relationship."</p><p>This man looks incredibly wealthy!</p><p>Qin Sang readily accepted his invitation, mentally calculating how to cultivate this relationship.  One bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; she could trade with him again for a high-quality spirit stone—that would be enough to refine the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The two of them set off towards the mountaintop.</p><p>Arriving at a cave in the back mountain, Qin Sang felt a chill emanating from within. The cultivator's aura she had sensed earlier was inside. She glanced at the young man in surprise.</p><p>"This Ice Cave is a discovery of mine," said the young man surnamed Fang, leading her downwards. "The frigid air from the cold pool inside allowed me to refine the Heavenly Cold Gale Formation…"</p><p>They quickly entered the ice cave, the cold air becoming increasingly intense, with white mist swirling around them.</p><p>After several turns, a spacious cavern opened before them, with a pool of water at its center radiating intense cold, yet remaining unfrozen.</p><p>Four people were seated around the edge of the pool, each holding a crystal tablet.</p><p>The four tablets were identical in appearance and their auras were interconnected.  The four cultivators channeled their spiritual energy into the tablets, which released a dense cold aura, forming swirling miniature cold currents between them.  </p><p>They were practicing a formation, but the array required five people to be complete; with one missing, its power was greatly diminished.</p><p>The two newcomers remained silent, watching them finish the final sequence.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell on a burly man with a beard, her expression changing.</p><p>"Daoist Qiu?"</p><p>The four people put away their tablets. The burly man immediately stood up, laughing as he approached. "I didn't expect the final helper to be Daoist Qin! With you here, Daoist Qiu can rest easy. Those minor demons will be easily dealt with."</p><p>"You two know each other? It seems I don't need to introduce you…"</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang smiled, his expression betraying nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, subtly avoiding the man's bear hug and bowing to him.</p><p>This man, Qiu, was a cultivator from Mount Baogu, skilled in Golden Path techniques, his cultivation at the late-stage bottleneck. Qin Sang had met him while cultivating on Mount Baogu.</p><p>Their friendship wasn't particularly deep.  He was just the type who seemed friendly to everyone.  Besides the man surnamed Qiu, there was another somewhat familiar face; Qin Sang had seen him before, but they'd never spoken.</p><p>"Fang wasn't lying; they are all cultivators recruited by Tianxing City."</p><p>Qin Sang silently agreed.</p>
