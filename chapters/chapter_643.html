<h1>Chapter 635: Entry</h1><p>Chapter 635: Entry</p><p>The Yi Hui stronghold's cave dwelling was quite good, and the cultivation resources left behind by the priests were plentiful.  Qin Sang found them unimpressive, but they would greatly benefit Ya Gu.</p><p>However, staying at the Yi Hui stronghold had drawbacks. First, there was a lack of fellow practitioners for exchange and guidance from masters, limiting future prospects. Second, it was easy to be seduced by worldly desires; those with insufficient cultivation and weak resolve were easily lost.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Ya Gu to so decisively abandon the readily available power, cutting ties so cleanly.</p><p>He wasn't obtuse; he could guess Ya Gu's thoughts to some extent.</p><p>However, their paths were destined to diverge.</p><p>Ya Gu's talent was among the lowest in the cultivation world.  Even with the advantage of the life-bound insect Gu in Nanjiang, the chances of her establishing a foundation and forming a golden core were still slim.</p><p>And Qin Sang couldn't abandon his cultivation path to indulge in romance.</p><p>He had too much to do, and he would inevitably leave West Xinjiang, never staying in one place for long.  Taking Ya Gu with him during his travels would be impractical.</p><p>To help Ya Gu grow, he took drastic measures, driven by time constraints.</p><p>This journey was solely for repayment of a debt; he wouldn't involve himself further.</p><p>Hearing Ya Gu's decision, Qin Sang felt a touch of relief.</p><p>He thought back to his own journey in pursuit of immortality, mirroring Ya Gu's resolute abandonment of easily obtained wealth and power.  Though their motivations differed, their paths converged.</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "You've decided? I can arrange for the Five Insects Sect to take you in. But cultivation is not carefree; it involves much solitude and hardship.  You might regret it in old age. Wouldn't a life of luxury be better?"</p><p>Ya Gu shook her head. "I won't regret going to the Five Insects Sect!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>With Ya Gu's decision made, Qin Sang said no more. He gave her all the remaining possessions of the Yi Hui stronghold priests. "Before you leave, would you like to return to Qianhu Village?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't asked what happened to Ya Gu in Qianhu Village on the day the Sacred Maiden was chosen.</p><p>She now possessed power; if she harbored unresolved feelings, she could handle them herself.</p><p>Ya Gu hesitated. "May I see Grand Elder Wu Yi?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, summoned his cloud steed, and took Ya Gu away from the Yi Hui stronghold.</p><p>...</p><p>Qianhu Village.</p><p>The stars were few.</p><p>Because it was the eve of the Wu Shen Festival, some villagers had gone to the Yi Hui stronghold for the Wu ritual, others to nearby villages for singing contests. Few remained in the village, mostly the elderly.</p><p>News of the incident at the Wu ritual hadn't reached them yet; Qianhu Village was peaceful.</p><p>The old Wu Yi was fast asleep.</p><p>Two figures stood by the window.</p><p>By the moonlight, Ya Gu gazed at the old Wu Yi, her lips pursed, her eyes red-rimmed, filled with reluctance.</p><p>Finally, Ya Gu produced a vial of pills that strengthened qi and blood, prolonging life, and placed it on the old Wu Yi's bedside. Then, she knelt outside the window and kowtowed several times.</p><p>Rising, Ya Gu wiped her eyes and whispered, "Broken Arm Brother, let's go."</p><p>She had only come to see Grand Elder Wu Yi one last time.</p><p>...</p><p>The Five Insects Sect.</p><p>The hegemon of the Xiong Mountain region.</p><p>Once, the Five Insects Sect not only dominated Xiong Mountain, but surrounding regions also submitted to it, all due to a cultivator among them who had achieved the Golden Core stage.</p><p>This was exceptionally rare in the barren West Xinjiang.</p><p>Unfortunately, this Golden Core cultivator's ambition didn't lie in West Xinjiang; he had no desire to expand the Five Insects Sect or rule the region, and left on travels soon after his breakthrough.</p><p>However, his prestige remained, and the Five Insects Sect benefited considerably.</p><p>But as time passed – nearly a century now – the Golden Core cultivator vanished without a trace. Many suspected he had perished.</p><p>Coupled with a lack of successors, the Five Insects Sect gradually declined.</p><p>Now, external forces were covetous, and even the priests of the large villages in the Xiong Mountain region harbored ulterior motives. The sect faced internal and external strife.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's location was unique. From above, the peaks of its mountain range resembled a blooming lotus flower.</p><p>Even in West Xinjiang, such a spiritually auspicious place was rare.</p><p>Qin Sang sped along on his sword, arriving at the Five Insects Sect before dawn, to retrieve some items as agreed.</p><p>"After you enter, remember not to let anyone know about the Cold Gold Sword and the Devouring Yuan Cone…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide his presence, bringing Ya Gu to the foot of the Five Insects Sect mountain.  As he was instructing her, a green light shot from the mountain – Cui Xuanzi, the Sect Master.</p><p>"Junior greets Senior Qin!"</p><p>His voice preceded him.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi landed before Qin Sang, his demeanor respectful. "Please, Senior, come with me. I've prepared fine tea."</p><p>“Let me in, or are you afraid I’ll cause trouble in your Five Insects Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang smirked.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi’s face froze, his expression uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Cui Xuanzi, then walked towards the gate with Ya Gu, saying indifferently, “I have no interest in your Five Insects Sect. I’m here for our previous agreement. How are the things I asked you to gather, and the items I wanted to buy?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi forced a smile. “Senior’s instructions, I have done my best, and indeed have made some progress these past few days…”</p><p>As they spoke, they soon entered the Five Insects Sect and arrived at the Grandmaster's Hall.</p><p>“Nice place.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, but only in a cursory way.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect boasted beautiful scenery and abundant spiritual energy, a rare treasure in the Western Frontier.  However, for a Golden Core cultivator, it was still somewhat lacking.</p><p>“Please have some tea, Senior.”</p><p>The three sat facing each other. Cui Xuanzi personally poured tea, offering a cup to Ya Gu as well, curiously asking, “Who is this young lady?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied in a cold tone, “I didn't like the Winged Viper Tribe's witch doctor, so I conveniently killed all their priests. She’s one of their priestesses.  For now, I’ll let her cultivate here in the Five Insects Sect.”</p><p>“The Winged Viper Tribe?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was startled.</p><p>Didn’t like them, so conveniently killed them?</p><p>Cold sweat trickled down Cui Xuanzi's back, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's last sentence, Cui Xuanzi's mind stirred. He readily agreed, exclaiming, “I have heard rumors, the Winged Viper Tribe uses human lives to refine medicine and raise insects.  Truly vicious! Senior has rid the world of evil, well done! If the young lady wishes to cultivate in our sect, I would be honored. We have many excellent cultivation caves, she can choose whichever she likes.”</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Ya Gu, “Stay here to cultivate for a while. If you think it's suitable, you can even become an apprentice to Sect Master Cui Xuanzi. I'm sure he won't refuse.”</p><p>For over a month in the Winged Viper Tribe’s area, Qin Sang guided Ya Gu while wandering the Xiong Mountain region searching for an ancient teleportation array. During this time, he encountered several high-ranking priests and learned that the Five Insects Sect had a good reputation.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately avoided explaining his relationship with Ya Gu.</p><p>After his departure, the Five Insects Sect wouldn’t dare mistreat Ya Gu for a short period.</p><p>By the time the Five Insects Sect realized what had happened, Ya Gu's cultivation would have improved, and with weapons like the Cold Gold Sword and the Devouring Origin Cone, she could decide whether to stay or leave as she pleased.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>A bit of writer’s block, the next chapter will be a little late.</p>
