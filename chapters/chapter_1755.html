<h1>Chapter 1746: The Chaos of Heaven and Earth</h1><p>*Boom...*</p><p>The spiritual energy in the forest suddenly surged toward a mountain, only to abruptly scatter moments later. The violent waves of spiritual energy formed a fierce gale, instantly causing the trees and plants in the forest to snap and wither, with dead leaves swirling wildly in the air.</p><p>The ever-changing celestial phenomena in the sea were something the island's spirits and creatures had grown accustomed to. However, sensing the overwhelming pressure emanating from the wind, their hearts trembled with fear.</p><p>Aside from the beasts and demonic creatures, many of the plants and trees in the forest had also gained sentience. Most of these plant spirits were not highly cultivated, and the majority had not yet developed the ability to move their true forms. They could only retreat their consciousness back into their bodies, shivering in fear.</p><p>A few ancient trees and spiritual herbs, however, were different. Some extended their roots, transforming them into countless legs, allowing them to sprint wildly through the forest. Others turned into a ball of green light, shooting outward. Within the green light, one could faintly see a vibrant spiritual herb.</p><p>Yet, after the celestial phenomenon passed, the mountain remained eerily silent for a long time.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have returned to normal, sitting cross-legged, though his brows were tightly furrowed.</p><p>His foundation had been damaged, and his injuries had not yet healed. The recent disturbance had nearly caused all his previous efforts to go to waste.</p><p>"The spiritual energy here seems... different from the Storm Realm," Qin Sang murmured, lowering his head slightly to gaze at a wisp of ethereal energy in his palm.</p><p>He referred to the previous small world he had been in as the Storm Realm.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was far denser than in the Storm Realm, but there was something peculiar about it. When he first entered this world, he had already sensed it, but at the time, he was severely injured and desperate to escape. He had assumed it was due to his injuries and hadn't given it much thought.</p><p>Now, he took out a demon core and a piece of demon bone with his other hand—remnants from the Thunder Tortoise he had slain in the Storm Realm.</p><p>After a brief examination, he confirmed that there was indeed a sense of chaotic energy within them, as if the Thunder Tortoise had originated from this world. It had cultivated by absorbing the spiritual energy of this realm, and over time, its own essence had been affected.</p><p>His eyes flickered with realization.</p><p>Previously, he had thought the Thunder Tortoise had been influenced by the Heavenly Dao's demonic resonance. But now, it seemed things were not so simple!</p><p>For a moment, he hesitated, unsure whether he had truly left the Storm Realm. Could he have fallen into the Abyss?</p><p>From the outside, the Abyss was a place of utter chaos and extreme danger, far from the tranquility he now experienced. Yet, the cultivators of the Storm Realm knew little about the Abyss, and no one was certain what lay in its depths.</p><p>Recalling the various texts he had read, he remembered that even before the Heavenly Dao's demonic resonance, the beasts of the Abyss had been ferocious and cruel, incapable of normal communication.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder: Could it be that cultivating in this chaotic energy had affected their souls, causing their violent nature?</p><p>At this thought, his expression darkened.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha protecting him, he wasn't worried about his nature being influenced by the outside world. But who knew what other effects long-term exposure to this chaotic energy might have?</p><p>At the very least, Qin Sang had already confirmed that directly absorbing this chaotic energy would disrupt his once-stable true essence, causing turmoil in his dantian and potentially even shaking his foundation.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang released his divine sense.</p><p>The forest gradually returned to normal. A tree spirit that had been sprinting to the edge of the forest suddenly stopped. Green light flickered on its trunk, gathering toward its crown. Then, its branches began to sway, embracing the green light like an eye, peering back.</p><p>At that moment, a transparent hand materialized above the tree spirit, grabbing it. The ground trembled slightly as the tree spirit was uprooted and vanished in an instant.</p><p>A moment later, an ancient tree appeared in front of Qin Sang's cave dwelling.</p><p>Before Qin Sang floated a ball of green light—the spirit of the tree.</p><p>The tree spirit had not yet gained full sentience and was naturally fearful of Qin Sang. The green light trembled incessantly.</p><p>Though Qin Sang still had some Emperor's Elixir, he didn't want to waste it on such a creature. Instead, he extended a strand of divine sense, probing into the green light.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, sighing inwardly.</p><p>As expected, the tree spirit's cultivation, by the standards of the Storm Realm, was only at the early stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm, equivalent to a human Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, even spirits that hadn't gained full sentience possessed considerable intelligence. This tree spirit, however, was far less intelligent than normal, and its nature carried a hint of ferocity and agitation.</p><p>No wonder he had felt a sinister aura upon entering the island, as if this place was far from benevolent.</p><p>Normally, plant spirits born in the wilderness, without consuming blood, were mostly pure in nature.</p><p>But this island, though seemingly peaceful, experienced brutal battles at regular intervals, all due to that inherent ferocity. Once the urge to kill was triggered, it would incite the violent nature of all the spirits on the island, dragging them into the fray.</p><p>He then summoned a newly born flower spirit, which was noticeably gentler than the tree spirit, but the underlying ferocity was still deeply rooted.</p><p>"Are all living beings in this world destined to become savage beasts?" Qin Sang wondered silently before entering meditation once more.</p><p>He meticulously refined and absorbed the spiritual energy, separating the five elemental energies. He found it possible, but the process took several times longer than it would have in the Storm Realm.</p><p>If he were to cultivate in this world, it would take who knew how long to reach the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Despite this, Qin Sang patiently continued to refine the energy, slowly absorbing it into his body.</p><p>For now, there was no better option. He could only endure and wait until he regained his strength before venturing out to find other cultivators in this world and see how they practiced.</p><p>"Surely this world isn't entirely populated by spirits and demons?" Qin Sang muttered to himself. He had plenty of time, and there were no powerful demonic beasts lurking nearby.</p><p>If he used the elixirs and spirit stones from his Thousand Jun Ring, his recovery would be much faster. However, he had brought only a limited number of spirit stones with him.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, as the world's foremost cultivator, he no longer relied on spirit stones for combat and had little use for them. Thus, he had left most of his spirit stones with his sect.</p><p>Activating the summoning platform had also consumed his only top-grade spirit stone.</p><p>If the rest of this world was like this, it was likely that the spirit stones formed in this chaotic energy were also abnormal.</p><p>The remaining elixirs and spirit stones he had might be his only lifeline in future battles, so he couldn't afford to use them carelessly.</p><p>Time passed unnoticed in the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang's injuries and cultivation slowly recovered. A few days later, he suddenly emerged from meditation, standing up abruptly and looking down at himself, his expression shifting between light and shadow.</p><p>During this time, he had painstakingly refined the spiritual energy and absorbed it into his body. At first, he hadn't noticed anything amiss, but today he suddenly felt that his true essence was showing signs of chaos again.</p><p>The signs were still faint, and his efforts had clearly been effective, but they couldn't completely eliminate the problem. The supposedly purified spiritual energy seemed to contain some hidden chaotic force that had infiltrated his body.</p><p>Moreover, the way the chaos manifested after the signs appeared made Qin Sang increasingly uneasy.</p><p>The chaos wasn't entirely internal. His true essence was being influenced by the chaotic energy outside, and he no longer felt the same absolute control over his own power.</p><p>At this point, his true essence had only recovered to the early Golden Core stage.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang tried to isolate the internal and external energies, and the situation immediately improved. However, his mood did not lighten.</p><p>He had a few guesses about what was happening.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down again, this time not wasting any more time. He took a bottle of elixirs and held a top-grade spirit stone in each hand, quickly restoring his strength.</p><p>A month later, he had recovered to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His true essence was stable, but now he had to use his divine sense to maintain its stability, sealing off his energy and isolating himself from the outside world to prevent the chaotic energy from affecting him.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had a rough idea of what was going on.</p><p>Cultivators could not exist in isolation from the world. In fact, the higher their cultivation, the more they sought harmony between heaven and man. The internal and external energies were not completely separate; they constantly interacted, making it impossible to avoid external influences. Even the true essence refined from elixirs and spirit stones would, over time, be influenced and invaded by the chaotic energy of the world.</p><p>His divine sense was strong, and he could suppress the effects unconsciously. Since he had only recently entered this world, the influence was still shallow, and he didn't need to actively use his divine sense to stabilize his cultivation. But as his cultivation gradually recovered, the connection between his internal and external energies deepened, and he had to constantly maintain control.</p><p>Moreover, he had to dedicate part of his divine sense to suppress the Kirin Origin Seed. If things continued this way, he estimated that recovering to the late Nascent Soul stage would be his limit.</p><p>But this was not a sustainable solution. Being tied down by his own divine sense was one thing, but how could he continue to cultivate in the future?</p><p>Would he have to abandon the path of Qi cultivation entirely?</p><p>Perhaps after refining the Kirin Origin Seed and significantly enhancing his divine sense, there might be a way forward.</p><p>But his core cultivation method was the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture." No matter how strong his body and divine sense became, they couldn't help him break through to higher realms. They were only temporary measures.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes opened slightly, his gaze sharp as if it could pierce through the cave and into the vast heavens beyond.</p><p>He wondered if there were any cultivators in this world. If there were, he refused to believe that all of them possessed divine sense as powerful as his. There must be a solution!</p><p>"For now, I must quickly make contact with the cultivators of this world!" Qin Sang resolved, stopping his cultivation and maintaining his strength at the early Nascent Soul stage. He then turned his thoughts to other matters.</p><p>Now that his blood and qi had stabilized, there were no major obstacles to his body cultivation.</p><p>"What effect would the chaos of heaven and earth have on body cultivation?" Qin Sang wondered, immediately deciding to test the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement" technique.</p><p>Without a Star Platform, Qin Sang could only directly draw upon the power of the stars.</p><p>He stepped out of the cave and sat on a flat rock in the valley, looking up at the sky.</p><p>It happened to be a full moon night.</p><p>The bright moon hung high in the sky, surrounded by countless stars.</p><p>The moonlight bathed the mountain, making it as bright as day.</p><p>Staring directly at the moon, Qin Sang felt a slight sting in his eyes.</p><p>The stars in this world looked no different from those in the Storm Realm, but the moon was far brighter, its halo noticeably larger.</p><p>The light emanating from the moon had varying intensities, with the center being the brightest, as if a silver disk had been embedded within it.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, faintly seeing another circle within the moon, as if two moons overlapped, illuminating this world together.</p><p>This celestial phenomenon hinted that this world was different from the Storm Realm.</p><p>Focusing his mind, Qin Sang activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation technique, calming the last traces of restlessness in his blood and qi. He then began practicing the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement."</p><p>During his decades in the Storm Realm, he had never ceased his body cultivation. Combined with the treasures and opportunities he had gathered from various regions, he was not far from reaching the late stage of the fourth layer.</p><p>He still had some spiritual liquid from the Dragon Transformation Pool within him, so he expected his cultivation to proceed smoothly.</p><p>As the starlight entered his body, the star煞 was filtered out by the Jade Buddha, and the sensation was not much different from his experience in the Storm Realm.</p><p>But after only an incense stick's worth of time, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, a look of surprise on his face. He then quickly resumed his cultivation.</p><p>Three hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, slowly ending his cultivation. A strange light flickered in his eyes as he muttered, "Who would have thought that the chaos of heaven and earth could have such benefits? Is this a case of losing the east but gaining the west?"</p><p>During his body refinement, Qin Sang discovered that the chaotic energy impacted his blood and qi, unexpectedly enhancing his physical cultivation and significantly speeding up his progress.</p><p>"No wonder there are so many spirits here. Could this be a demon world?" Qin Sang glanced at the endless forest below.</p><p>With the chaotic energy of heaven and earth, it was far easier for demons to cultivate here than in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that if there were humans in this world, they would likely take advantage of this unique condition, and there would be no shortage of body cultivators.</p><p>The so-called Great Dao that cultivators pursued, at least before the Nascent Soul stage, could be likened to the Heavenly Dao. Thus, cultivation should follow the principles of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Only those with immense power could dare to defy the heavens.</p><p>Without understanding the Heavenly Dao, how could one defy it?</p><p>For body cultivators, this place was a treasure trove!</p><p>But when Qin Sang thought of the savage beasts of the Abyss, he realized that whether this was a blessing or a curse remained to be seen.</p><p>If this hidden danger couldn't be resolved, the cultivators of this world—whether human, demon, or ghost—would surely not be content, possessing great power at the cost of their sanity.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>When the two spirit insects began cultivating, they also showed signs of unease.</p><p>The spirit insects cultivated their innate abilities and wouldn't lose control of their true essence like Qin Sang. But absorbing the chaotic energy would undoubtedly affect them, especially their intelligence.</p><p>They had not yet gained full sentience, and if the ferocious nature took root, the consequences would be dire. Qin Sang dared not let them continue cultivating for now.</p><p>"I thought the dense spiritual energy here would give you a good chance of breaking through without the Frost Elixir, but it seems we'll have to wait a bit longer..." Qin Sang gently comforted the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly slowly flapped its wings, conveying a sense of closeness and showing no urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a newborn, slowly exploring this world.</p><p>He had discovered the benefits of the chaotic energy but did not recklessly use it to refine his body, as he wasn't sure if there were hidden risks.</p><p>The power of the stars and the Dragon Transformation Pool were enough to support his cultivation, and his progress wouldn't be too slow.</p><p>Twelve years later.</p><p>A figure emerged from the mist-shrouded valley.</p><p>Qin Sang's aura was significantly stronger than it had been twelve years ago, thanks to his progress in body cultivation.</p><p>Eager to explore the outside world, Qin Sang had spared no effort in refining and absorbing the spiritual liquid from the Dragon Transformation Pool over the past twelve years. Combined with the foundation he had built in places like the Golden Sword Cave, he had successfully broken through to the late stage of the fourth layer of the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement"!</p><p>Looking up at the sky, Qin Sang mused that a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would be considered formidable anywhere. With his physical strength alone, he could handle most situations.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly would make up for any shortcomings in perception.</p><p>If he encountered real danger, he could forcefully use his true essence to activate his treasures and abilities. The chaos in his true essence wouldn't manifest instantly, but he would have to escape before his true essence was depleted.</p><p>With a step, Qin Sang flashed into the center of the island. When he reappeared in the air, he held a spirit stone in his hand.</p><p>He had obtained it from a beast's lair, and as expected, the spiritual energy within the stone was also chaotic.</p><p>Through the spirits on the island, he had learned that there were no shape-shifting demons on the nearby islands, and they had never ventured further.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that while drifting at sea, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had spotted a distant landmass, which seemed vast—perhaps not a continent, but far larger than this island.</p><p>With a leap, he flew in the direction of his memory.</p><p>---</p><p>**Recommendation:** A friend's book, for those interested, please check it out and show your support.</p><p>*"Hold On!
