<h1>Chapter 1528:  Return to the East Sea Abyss (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1528:  Return to the East Sea Abyss (4k)</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>After listening to his story,  Liuli unexpectedly reciprocated, sharing her own story with her master.  Perhaps because she had suppressed her emotions for too long, and the impact of the civilization's tomb, Liuli felt a desire to confide in someone for the first time, and Qin Sang was the only one there.  </p><p>But perhaps Qin Sang was the most suitable person.  Too much had happened between them that shouldn't have.  From another perspective, Qin Sang understood her better than anyone, even better than her master, Bing Yao.  Since Bing Yao was trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, almost every major turning point in Liuli's life had involved Qin Sang deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly.  When Liuli spoke of her master, her eyes softened unusually, her arms around her knees, a girlish expression on her face.</p><p>The story was quite typical. A girl from a fallen family, homeless and destitute. Her beauty became a burden, and she learned to smear mud on her face from a young age.  In despair, she finally met a benefactor, Bing Yao, who was like a god descending, taking her hand and pulling her from the mire, bringing her into a strange and wondrous world. This person showed her what happiness truly was.  She learned that even winter nights could be gentle.</p><p>From then on, Bing Yao became the most important person in her life, like a master and a mother.  But the good times didn't last. She was, after all, ill-fated. When Bing Yao was imprisoned, Liuli, then only at the Qi Condensation stage, shouldered the responsibility of saving her master.  Living under the care of others was not easy.  At that time, Dongyang Bo hadn't yet revealed his true nature, but Liuli, having already experienced the cold realities of human nature, knew that Dongyang Bo had ulterior motives, yet she had no choice.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew what happened next.</p><p>After listening quietly, Qin Sang was about to speak when she saw Liuli straighten her back, the gentleness gone from her expression. It seemed to have been an illusion.  Qin Sang understood. Liuli didn't need comfort.</p><p>…</p><p>Afterwards.</p><p>Remembering this place, where a civilization of cultivators was buried, Qin Sang often sighed. As time passed, the turmoil in her heart gradually subsided, but the feeling of that moment when the civilization vanished was deeply etched in their minds.  She couldn't help but wonder how many similar civilizations had silently perished in the boundless storm belt, and how many were still struggling on the brink of extinction.</p><p>Fortunately.</p><p>Only this one place on the entire sea chart was an exception; the others were normal shelters.</p><p>After another thirteen years of journey.</p><p>They were finally approaching Central State!</p><p>The last shelter was successfully found.  It was a reef hidden deep beneath the sea, its surface riddled with holes.  The turbulent currents couldn't penetrate these holes, making it a suitable refuge.</p><p>The divine shuttle entered the largest hole.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged, her expression filled with joy.  All in all, they had been in the storm belt for thirty-seven years. Even subtracting the five years spent healing as incarnations, it was still thirty-two years.  At the start of their journey, neither of them could have imagined it would take so long just to travel.</p><p>“Let's rest and prepare, then head to Central State!”</p><p>Qin Sang patted the sea chart in her hand, her spirit high.  The mysterious Central State was finally about to reveal its secrets!</p><p>A look of anticipation appeared in Liuli's eyes as she nodded slightly.  Suddenly remembering something, she summoned the four-horned snake seal and said, “I've comprehended the lower half of the *Tongbao Scripture*. I should return the spiritual seal to you.”</p><p>In the storm belt, they couldn't focus on cultivation.  Qin Sang concentrated on cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, while Liuli cultivated the new Ice Soul Divine Light and refined the spiritual treasure. The four-horned snake seal was naturally attuned to Liuli, and she quickly gained its recognition, becoming its master. After years of continuous refinement, once she truly mastered the seal, the complete *Tongbao Scripture* appeared in her mind.</p><p>“No hurry!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head, stopping Liuli. “We're almost at Central State.  Who knows what obstacles we'll encounter when searching for the Buddha Bone Relic? Cultivating the *Tongbao Scripture* isn't something that can be done overnight.  It's best if the spiritual seal remains in your possession, allowing you to use its full power to deal with any unexpected situations.”</p><p>Liuli considered it and put the seal away. “Alright! I'll return the seal after we find the Buddha Bone Relic.”</p><p>She showed no greed whatsoever.  This precious spiritual treasure was like a hot potato, something she didn’t want to hold for a moment longer.</p><p>Central State was ahead.  Both of them were eager to get there, having restored their true essence and vitality. They decided to set off immediately.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The divine shuttle broke through the surface of the sea.</p><p>Liuli and her incarnation continued to take turns piloting.</p><p>Initially, everything went smoothly.</p><p>But after covering half the distance, Qin Sang felt something was amiss.</p><p>The storm was intensifying, distant thunder rumbling closer, carried on the wind.  Storms and thunder have always been intertwined.  Within the storm belt, lightning frequently appeared.  They had even encountered a thunderous swamp, a spectacle rivaling a heavenly tribulation, with lightning relentlessly striking the same area, transforming a vast expanse of sea into a shimmering white expanse of thunder and lightning.  Even the hurricane couldn't penetrate the thunder swamp, marked by Xiao Xiangzi as extremely dangerous.  With no shelter nearby, they dared not approach, merely stopping their divine shuttle to observe from afar before leaving.</p><p>But the thunder here was peculiar.  From such a distance, they felt an oppressive presence. It… didn't sound like ordinary thunder; the continuous roars resembled a creature's shriek.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.  They had traversed the storm belt for years, encountering only one ferocious beast. They believed such creatures were rare here, yet this unforeseen incident occurred near Zhongzhou.</p><p>How could there be a ferocious beast near Zhongzhou?  There was no precedent of such attacks on the North Sea, leading Qin Sang to believe the barrier not only repelled storms but also deterred ferocious beasts.  Was he about to be proven wrong?</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li exchanged a look of astonishment and uncertainty.</p><p>As they hesitated, the thunder grew clearer, that familiar sense of frenzy returning after years.</p><p>“Ferocious beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang practically spat the words, his doubt gone.</p><p>The thunder intensified, each roar clearer and closer!</p><p>“It’s found us!” Liu Li’s expression turned serious.  They couldn’t afford to be complacent, thinking it was a passing beast like before.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly composed himself, his mind racing.  He swiftly instructed, “As planned, we split up! If we get too far apart, meet at Jiuga Mountain in Zhongzhou!  Bai Lian Pure Land is the secondary rendezvous point.”</p><p>He grabbed the Moonlit Rhinoceros Horn, retracted his external body, and fled the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle.</p><p>Their knowledge of Zhongzhou was limited to Xiao Xiangzi’s brief accounts, leaving them uncertain of their destination.  Since the location of the Buddha Bone Relic was difficult to find, Qin Sang could only choose two well-known places from the jade slip.</p><p>Jiuga Mountain.</p><p>Not a sect or faction.  In Xiao Xiangzi’s records, it was one of Zhongzhou's Buddhist sacred sites; a few words described its grandeur.  Even if destroyed, such a sacred place would have many legends.  With careful investigation, its location could be found.</p><p>If Jiuga Mountain was truly gone, Bai Lian Pure Land was the backup.  As a top Buddhist faction, it would certainly have its legends.</p><p>‘Boom…’</p><p>A hurricane slammed into them.  Qin Sang nimbly dodged, glanced back at the shuttle, nodded farewell, and used his lightning wings to break through the air, heading in the opposite direction of the beast.</p><p>Liu Li watched Qin Sang disappear, offering no objections or hesitation. This was their pre-agreed plan for a ferocious beast encounter.  She was not skilled in escape techniques; following Qin Sang would be a burden.  He would lure and evade the beast while she escaped to wait ahead.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang vanish into the darkness, Liu Li suppressed the shuttle's energy signature and left the danger zone.  Soon, she judged from the ‘thunder’ that the beast was moving away, successfully lured by Qin Sang.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang created a spectacle, using his lightning escape technique to ensure the beast focused on him, ignoring Liu Li.  He observed the storm's shifts, searching for something to aid his escape—like the wind walls or thunder swamps he encountered before.  He didn't need equal power; a sufficiently strong hurricane to mask his presence would suffice.  All signs pointed to the beast being powerful but impulsive and instinctual—leaving vulnerabilities to exploit.</p><p>The storm belt was unpredictable. Such places were rare, but patience would reveal one.  Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the storm belt, able to read its signs.</p><p>If all else failed, there was another option—testing if the immortal world's barrier could repel the beast.  And why hadn't the Zhongzhou forces detected or prepared for a ferocious beast near their realm?</p><p>Unless desperate, Qin Sang preferred not to resort to this. If the barrier failed, unleashing a beast into the immortal world would be catastrophic.</p><p>The roar was like thunder.  The hurricane carried the sound, causing Qin Sang to feel a strange stagnation in his blood.</p><p>This is due to the disparity in cultivation levels!</p><p>"Could it be a Nascent Soul stage cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>During their last fleeting encounter, the wind wall had blocked their view, preventing them from directly experiencing the beasts' power; they didn't know which of the two beasts was stronger.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>Sensing the alluring blood, the beasts roared urgently.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to stop, pushing his escape technique to its limit.</p><p>Judging by their roars, although this beast was fast, it wasn't overwhelmingly so. This was undoubtedly good news for Qin Sang.</p><p>He remained calm and collected, his gaze swiftly scanning the seemingly chaotic storm; yet, he perceived a pattern within it.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang detected something unusual in the beast's roars.</p><p>Within the beast's frantic roars, there seemed to be a hint of hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang realized something.</p><p>His current trajectory was still forcing him closer to Central State.</p><p>Could it be as he suspected, that the barrier of the cultivation world could repel the beasts, causing them fear or aversion?</p><p>The beast was slower than anticipated because it was unwilling to approach the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had an idea, and immediately changed direction, heading straight for Central State!</p><p>…</p><p>In an unknown location within the storm zone.</p><p>There was a small island.</p><p>The island was isolated, surrounded on all sides by raging hurricanes.  Runes flickered intermittently above the island, forming a strong barrier, a very mysterious sight.</p><p>The island was brightly lit; several figures, all dressed in Daoist robes and possessing an air of transcendence, were seated in meditation.</p><p>Everyone sat around a square cauldron.</p><p>Inside the cauldron was a dark, fist-sized object that occasionally emitted red sparks. A strange fragrance wafted out with the swirling smoke.</p><p>The smoke dissipated upon entering the storm zone, making the fragrance almost imperceptible; however, it spread into the depths of the storm zone.  Any being with exceptionally keen senses would be drawn to it.</p><p>"With the addition of the Buddhist Vajra Subduing Demon Formation, we shouldn't suffer a defeat as devastating as last time, should we?"</p><p>A Daoist priest, wearing a carefree head巾 and with a long beard reaching his knees, stared at the cauldron, toying with an ancient bronze coin with a square hole, suddenly sighed.</p><p>His words evoked unpleasant memories in others; the expressions on their faces varied, subtly revealing their fear.</p><p>Someone beside him sighed, "Regardless of the time wasted waiting for the beast to take the bait, the beast is so ferocious that with just a few of us, no matter what methods we use, we can't subdue it; it's only a matter of how quickly we're defeated. I truly don't understand why the Grand Elder would assign us to this thankless task."</p><p>"Yes! Either the Grand Elder should personally intervene, or the Daoist sect should issue a declaration and unite all factions, only then would there be a slight chance of success. But the Grand Elder…"</p><p>Someone echoed.</p><p>When mentioning the Grand Elder, their tone was extremely respectful, yet there was a hint of complaint.</p><p>"Silence!"</p><p>Among the crowd, the only elder in purple robes opened his eyes, his pupils flashing with purple lightning, his authority unquestionable.</p><p>The man's expression startled, and he immediately fell silent.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist wasn't afraid of the elder in purple robes; he smirked, and said to everyone, "It is said that the beast originally resided in the legendary East Sea's Abyss, but now it has left its lair and roams freely. This has never happened before."</p><p>After a pause, he sighed, "To the east, for untold millions of miles, there is a great abyss, a truly bottomless valley, its depths unfathomable, called the Abyss. The waters of the eight wildernesses and the Milky Way all flow into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases.  It is filled yet not full, and emptied yet not empty... my fellow disciples, are you not curious about what cataclysmic event has occurred in the East Sea Abyss?"</p><p>"Who among us has ever been to the Abyss? The East Sea Abyss, the beast's lair... there are many theories, and no consensus.  My only wish is that this cataclysm doesn't affect Central State."</p><p>A female cultivator sighed, her expression filled with worry.  "First, there's the beast, and then what other monstrous beings? How dangerous! How dangerous!"</p><p>"At least, the barrier remains strong, capable of repelling the beast, preventing it from approaching. If the barrier truly collapses and the day comes when Central State is destroyed, we will likely have already ascended to immortality."</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist remained optimistic. "Capturing the beast might bring legends into reality; it could be a stroke of good fortune! The Grand Elder ordered us to hunt the beast, there's a deeper meaning, and once the time is right, the Grand Elder will definitely act."</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A rapid bell sound suddenly came from the purple-robed elder's waist.</p><p>‘Dong dong dong…’</p><p>The bell sounded like drums, interrupting their argument.</p><p>Everyone's gaze instantly shifted, their expressions turning extremely serious.</p><p>The purple-robed elder removed the bell.</p><p>The bell was entirely black, engraved with cloud and lightning patterns. With each vibration, faint clouds would surge from its surface, then merge back into the bell, repeating endlessly.</p><p>This treasure served as a warning.</p><p>"The beast is approaching!"</p><p>The purple-robed elder stood up straight, shouting, "Form the array!"</p>
