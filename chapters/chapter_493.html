<h1>Chapter 486: Sky Fiend</h1><p>The refining of a Sky Fiend from a living corpse can be roughly divided into four steps: Demonic Core Implantation, Core Fusion, Earthly煞 Infusion, and Corpse Core Formation.  The most dangerous steps are Demonic Core Implantation and Earthly Sha Infusion.</p><p>During Demonic Core Implantation, the corpse might be unable to withstand the power of the Demonic Core, leading to Qi deviation, bodily collapse, and explosive death.</p><p>Even if this step is successfully navigated, there's no room for complacency. Core Fusion places even higher demands on the refiner. In this step, Qin Sang must execute countless complex hand seals to help the corpse merge with the Demonic Core.</p><p>There can be no pause.</p><p>The key lies in spiritual sense. Insufficient spiritual power can be replenished with pills. However, if the spiritual sense is exhausted midway, one can only helplessly await failure.  Fortunately, tempered by the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," Qin Sang's spiritual sense is superior to that of cultivators at the same realm, making this step the least of his worries.</p><p>Earthly Sha Infusion leads to Sha Core formation. One misstep could trigger a violent conflict between the Earthly Sha and the Demonic Core, causing the latter to self-destruct.  Qin Sang's proximity would inevitably result in him being caught in the blast, costing him his life or at least half of it.</p><p>After the Sha Core forms, the most dangerous stage is over. Once the Sha Core evolves into the corpse's own Corpse Sha Core, the Sky Fiend is complete.</p><p>Besides these, there’s a hidden danger after the Sky Fiend is refined—backlash!</p><p>The corpse's sudden ascension to Sky Fiend status makes it difficult to control, even for cultivators at the Pseudo Core Formation stage.  The risk of backlash is extremely high.</p><p>Disciples of the Heavenly Corpse Sect must make thorough preparations before refining a Sky Fiend.  The moment the corpse bares its fangs, they must suppress it, continuously reinforce their soul imprint, and rely on this imprint to gradually subdue the corpse and regain control.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't need this. The Jade Buddha also strengthens his soul imprint. If the power disparity between him and the corpse were too great, it wouldn't work, but now there's no need to worry. Even if the corpse ascends to Sky Fiend status, it can't break free.</p><p>This saves Qin Sang a lot of time.</p><p>The jade box opened. Qin Sang tapped his fingers, disabling the restrictions within.</p><p>A powerful demonic aura, carrying a chilling coldness, surged out.</p><p>According to Steward Bao, this Demonic Core was taken from a nascent-core stage Ice Lizard.  The core's icy chill is distinctly different from the Yin coldness of the Earthly Sha.</p><p>The combined effect of the two made even Qin Sang feel as though he was about to freeze.</p><p>Putting Yu Hua aside for the moment, Qin Sang drew the Demonic Core before him, his right hand cupping it virtually as he focused his mind upon it.</p><p>The beauty of a Demonic Core represents immense power, a breathtaking transformation through the Dao, difficult to describe with words, captivating and mesmerizing.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, composing himself, and cautiously extended his spiritual sense, probing the core's aura.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang became very familiar with the Demonic Core.  Suddenly, he beckoned Yu Hua with a crooked finger. In that instant, a "thread" seemed to fly out from Yu Hua's body, pulled by Qin Sang towards the Demonic Core.</p><p>This step marked the beginning of the Sky Fiend refinement秘法.  The "thread" was actually a manifestation of the corpse control restrictions on Yu Hua. Qin Sang intended to use the restrictions to allow the Demonic Core and the corpse to become "acquainted."</p><p>Following Qin Sang's movements, the "threads" on the surface of the Demonic Core gradually formed a "net."  The core initially resisted strongly, but over time, it seemed to begin to accept it.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang gently pushed the Demonic Core forward.</p><p>The core floated towards Yu Hua, landing precisely at his dantian.</p><p>At this moment, Sha Qi churned within Yu Hua's dantian, as if a black hole had appeared.</p><p>As the Demonic Core was about to enter the dantian, Qin Sang's mind suddenly tensed, his eyes fixed on the core.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Demonic Core slowly sank into the Sha Qi.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's expression changed abruptly. He noticed that, stimulated by the Demonic Core, the Sha Qi and spiritual power within Yu Hua's Qi sea began to violently fluctuate.</p><p>The originally harmonious coexistence of the two forces was disrupted by the introduction of the demonic aura, showing signs of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately withdrew the Demonic Core!</p><p>While calming both forces, Qin Sang carefully recalled every detail, then tried again.</p><p>Failure followed failure, but subtle changes were occurring.</p><p>Gradually, the Earthly Sha and Yu Hua's spiritual power became less resistant to the Demonic Core, instead coalescing to resist the pressure together.</p><p>This was good news. Only through their seamless cooperation could they withstand the Demonic Core's might.</p><p>The Demonic Core sank inch by inch into Yu Hua's body.</p><p>Storms brewed time and again, and were quelled each time by Qin Sang, until the Demonic Core fully entered Yu Hua's dantian.</p><p>Within the Qi sea, in the ocean formed by spiritual power and Sha Qi, the Demonic Core floated, finally settling at the center. Suddenly, demonic aura erupted, radiating brilliantly.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Hua's features twisted grotesquely, emitting a strange, ghostly howl filled with terrible pain, contained within the cave by restrictions Qin Sang had set up beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was tense. His spiritual sense instantly swept over Yu Hua's entire body, fearing any oversight, then he spared no effort in channeling his spiritual power, frantically pouring it into Yu Hua to help suppress the Demonic Core!</p><p>Yu Hua's Qi sea was in chaos, the power within incredibly disordered.</p><p>He was now like a bottomless pit. Qin Sang's spiritual power was quickly drained. He immediately consumed a spirit pill, then a second, a third…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot as he stared intently at Yu Hua.</p><p>Finally, the chaos in Yu Hua's Qi sea subsided. The turbulent spiritual power and Earthly Sha gradually calmed, returning to their respective places. The Demonic Core also restrained its edge, floating quietly at the center of the Qi sea.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, slowly withdrawing his spiritual power. After checking Yu Hua, he immediately entered meditative practice.</p><p>After recovering to his peak state, he proceeded with the second step, completing it smoothly.</p><p>Now, Yu Hua and the Demonic Core appeared to be intimately connected, but this was only an illusion.  Only after the Demonic Core transformed into a Corpse Sha Core would they truly become one.</p><p>The next step was Earthly Sha Infusion, also the most dangerous!</p><p>Qin Sang emptied his mind, resting for a long time before daring to begin.</p><p>Yu Hua's Qi sea transformed into a furnace. The Earthly Sha and spiritual power within were like flames, scorching the Demonic Core. Under the relentless assault, a crack finally appeared in the demonic power on the core's surface!</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang immediately commanded Yu Hua to propel a wisp of Earthly Sha towards the Demonic Core. However, before succeeding, it was repelled by the re-converging demonic power.</p><p>Failure was normal, as long as things remained under control.  There was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang had found the solution through repeated failures, so he wasn't anxious.</p><p>Within Yu Hua's Qi sea, a tug-of-war unfolded.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Persistence paid off. Finally, the first wisp of Earthly Sha successfully broke through the demonic power, making contact with the Demonic Core and resolutely surging inside!</p><p>It was immediately met with a fierce counterattack from the demonic power, and was forced to retreat.</p><p>But this was only the beginning.</p>
