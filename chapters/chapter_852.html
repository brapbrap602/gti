<h1>Chapter 844: Immortal Yue</h1><p>Qin Sang noticed Elder Zou mentioned the Seven Kills Hall would reopen in forty years. The time was finally set, and it was even sooner than expected!  It would still be led by the Wu Clan.  Within a century, the Seven Kills Hall would open twice.  Conventionally, the first two automatic openings of the Seven Kills Hall were less than three hundred years apart. Didn't that mean, before the next opening, he could enter multiple times?  What was the Wu Clan searching for that they would pay such a high price to repeatedly open the Seven Kills Hall?  Last time, the Grand Witch Doctor obtained a treasure in the Celestial Pagoda and was pursued by the Demon Lord, nearly causing a war between the two factions. Could it be that this treasure wasn't what they were looking for?</p><p>Regardless of the Wu Clan's schemes, it had nothing to do with Qin Sang. The more times he could enter the Seven Kills Hall, the better.  He hoped to uncover all the secrets and find the ancient teleportation formation before the next opening.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang readily agreed to Elder Zou's request.</p><p>“Hairy Mountain Vine, Azure Root… Scorpion Venom Grass…”</p><p>Elder Zou pondered for a long time. “Brother, I truly haven't seen these two herbs before. Allow me to go back and inquire. Many cultivators are trapped in the Demon Sea, and treasures frequently appear on Great Desolation Island, so there's a good chance. The order to defend Great Desolation Island came from both the righteous and demonic paths, and the three major trading alliances are also strictly adhering to it.  Brother, please remain on this island and be patient.  The demon race probably wouldn't be crazy enough to actually attack Great Desolation Island. The turmoil will eventually subside. Although this island is on the periphery, you don't need to worry about your safety for now. I will slowly think of a way.”</p><p>Qin Sang had his eye on the Hairy Mountain Vine, but couldn't state it directly, so he could only subtly hint and ask Elder Zou to help investigate.</p><p>As for leaving the Demon Sea, that would be difficult to achieve in the short term.</p><p>After seeing Elder Zou off, Qin Sang sat in meditation outside his cave, holding a bone flute, drawing upon the power of the stars to cultivate. When it was his turn, he would lead a team to patrol the island.</p><p>While waiting for news, Qin Sang didn't give up on his own efforts, contacting old acquaintances and searching for a way out.</p><p>As the days passed, the situation on Great Desolation Island grew increasingly tense.  Demonic activity became frequent in the surrounding waters. Contrary to expectations, the demon race seemed to have gone mad after their defeat at Celestial Witch Island, still intent on targeting Great Desolation Island. More and more demonic beasts gathered.  Qin Sang even sensed a terrifying aura during a patrol, suspected to be a transformed demon, and immediately led his team to flee.</p><p>A storm was brewing.</p><p>If this continued, Great Desolation Island would soon be surrounded by a tide of beasts, and a great war would be imminent.  Currently, almost no cultivator could break through the demonic beast blockade and return.</p><p>Those trapped in the depths of the Demon Sea faced an uncertain fate.</p><p>After a long wait, Qin Sang finally received news from Elder Zou.  After finishing his patrol that day, he eagerly flew towards the island where Elder Zou was located.</p><p>“Brother, you're here!”</p><p>Elder Zou greeted him warmly.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had been very accommodating to Elder Zou. Without revealing his own secrets, he drew maps of the Seven Kills Hall for Elder Zou and helped him discern various pieces of information.  Their relationship had become quite close.</p><p>“Brother, I've found the Hairy Mountain Vine you wanted.  Our alliance has it!”</p><p>Elder Zou said in a low voice, his expression mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang had long known the Eastern Extremity Alliance possessed the Hairy Mountain Vine, but still feigned surprise and eagerly asked, "Where is it now?"</p><p>“Don't be hasty, Brother.”</p><p>Elder Zou kept silent, leading Qin Sang into his cave. He closed the cave door and set up several layers of soundproof barriers.</p><p>This behavior made Qin Sang feel surprised, but he patiently waited.</p><p>Elder Zou sat in front of Qin Sang, no longer keeping him in suspense.  He lowered his voice and said, "Although we've found the Hairy Mountain Vine, it won't be easy to obtain. It's highly valued by the alliance, and you can't buy it with spirit stones. There's only one way now…"</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward.</p><p>“A senior in the alliance is gathering people to rescue someone from the depths of the Demon Sea. If you can join this senior and bring that person back, the Hairy Mountain Vine will be part of the reward. Moreover, this senior is very capable and has promised to send those involved back to the Azure Wave Sea after the mission, allowing them to avoid the calamity.”</p><p>Elder Zou paused, then said gravely, "While searching for the Hairy Mountain Vine, I was approached by this senior and invited to join. I haven't refused yet. If Brother agrees to these conditions, I can take you to meet her. There's no need for me to remind you how dangerous it is to enter the depths of the Demon Sea now.  You must consider this carefully."</p><p>A trip to the depths of the Demon Sea, not only to obtain the Hairy Mountain Vine but also to leave the Demon Sea, immediately piqued Qin Sang's interest. He possessed the Celestial Demon Transformation, so he wasn't afraid of being stranded in the Demon Sea. It was worth a try.</p><p>However, someone even Elder Zou addressed as "Senior," could it be a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor?</p><p>After carefully inquiring about the details, Qin Sang relaxed.  The person was known as Immortal Yue, a highly respected senior, not a Nascent Soul cultivator, but trapped at the bottleneck before Nascent Soul formation. Immortal Yue was quite prestigious, and Elder Zou, having received her favor, addressed her as "Senior."</p><p>If it were a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor, this trip might not be as simple as rescuing someone, and Qin Sang would have to consider it more carefully.  As long as it didn't involve Nascent Soul conflicts, Qin Sang was confident in his ability to handle it, so he didn't hesitate for too long and asked Elder Zou to take him to meet Immortal Yue.</p><p>Since it was Qin Sang's own decision, Elder Zou didn't try to persuade him further and took him to meet the person.</p><p>Immortal Yue was currently on an island neighboring Great Desolation Island.  When the two paid a visit, they found Immortal Yue was meeting with guests, two of them, both late-stage Core Formation experts!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zou, have you changed your mind and agreed to go with me?"</p><p>Immortal Yue was a white-haired old woman. Dense wrinkles were clearly visible on her face, and she appeared extremely aged, with an air of decline. Such an appearance on a peak Core Formation expert indicated that she was facing declining essence and dwindling lifespan.  Seeing Elder Zou, Immortal Yue's eyes brightened with anticipation.</p><p>Elder Zou shook his head and pointed to Qin Sang. "Senior Yue, I'm not here for myself this time. My brother here, Daoist Qing Feng, has extraordinary abilities and may be able to lend you a hand."</p><p>The smile on Immortal Yue's face faded as she glanced at Qin Sang, her tone displeased.  "Fellow Daoist Zou, the person I want to save is very important to me. This is not a child's game!"</p><p>The other two had an air of watching a good show.</p><p>“Senior, please calm down."</p><p>Elder Zou said unhurriedly,  "I dare to recommend this brother because I have my reasons. Cultivation level is merely a superficial indicator. There are many fellow Daoists who can challenge beyond their level.  My brother has been to the Seven Kills Hall and returned safely. Isn't that enough to demonstrate his strength?  Senior has been unable to find a suitable candidate, so why not let my brother try?"</p><p>Immortal Yue let out a soft gasp and put away her dismissive attitude. "You've been to the Seven Kills Hall?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Following Elder Zou's reminder, he flicked his finger, and the Ebony Sword flew out from his palm, splitting into several sword beams, showcasing his sharp swordsmanship.  In an instant, the room was filled with a green light, countless sword shadows flickering in and out of existence, as if it had become a sword domain.</p><p>"Sword Beam Splitting!"</p><p>Immortal Yue slowly exhaled.</p><p>The other two also became serious, sitting up straight.</p><p>---</p><p>I've taken such a long leave; there's so much work piled up at the company.  I'll definitely make up for yesterday's chapter later.</p>
