<h1>Chapter 713: Thief</h1><p>Qin Sang pondered, increasingly convinced of this possibility.</p><p>"A blessing in disguise. After all that has happened, I didn't expect the solution to be here. Whether my guess is right or wrong, it's worth the risk to infiltrate their nest and try."</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately left his cave, determined his bearings, and flew swiftly towards the snow-capped mountain.</p><p>……</p><p>Snow-covered and towering, the mountain stood tall.</p><p>From the outside, the Fire Sparrows' nest appeared as usual, but Qin Sang waited for a long time, yet no Fire Sparrows emerged to hunt for food.</p><p>Such unusual behavior surely indicated something was amiss!</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated briefly, then his figure silently melted into the void, approaching the island where the mountain was located without a sound. Reaching the foot of the mountain, he stealthily began his ascent.</p><p>His speed was considerable, and he soon neared the summit, still undetected.</p><p>The mountaintop was round, resembling a volcanic crater, its depths seemingly bottomless.  Strangely, the area around the crater was covered in white snow, with a constant stream of cold air rising from below, like an icy cavern.</p><p>Because of this, the inner walls of the crater were covered in a thick layer of ice, forming an ice wall. The deeper one went, the wider the space became, with countless sharp icicles hanging down, presenting a dangerous sight.</p><p>And on the ice wall, there were numerous small holes, about the size of a human head. Within these holes resided the Fire Sparrows!</p><p>Qin Sang lay prone at the crater's edge, gazing at the honeycomb-like nest below. Having reached this point undetected, his confidence grew.</p><p>Thousands of Fire Sparrows inhabited the crater, yet the interior was eerily quiet. Only at the very top of the crater did a few larger Fire Sparrows circle, keeping watch, the sound of their beating wings echoing.</p><p>Apart from these sentries, the other Fire Sparrows remained obediently within their nests. Their defenses were tight, layered and well-organized.</p><p>Qin Sang observed silently for a moment, then reached for his Corpse Puppet Bag. Two Flying Nightmares stealthily moved to either side of the crater's edge.</p><p>Once they were in position, at Qin Sang's command, they attacked simultaneously.</p><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Both Flying Nightmares appeared, their fists radiating corpse energy as they struck into the crater.</p><p>The Fire Sparrows on guard duty were instantly obliterated, and the corpse energy continued to spread, affecting other Fire Sparrows.</p><p>Suddenly, the crater erupted in chaos. Accompanied by shrieks, blue shadows swarmed out of the crater, gradually coalescing into a massive flock in midair.</p><p>Though appearing chaotic, the flock moved with a certain order.</p><p>They shrieked at the rampaging Flying Nightmares as two orbs of cold air rapidly condensed within the flock, the intense chill almost solidifying into ice crystals.</p><p>"Their king is indeed absent!  Fortunately so. The power of these ice crystals is definitely formidable. If their king were here, it would be disastrous."</p><p>Qin Sang lay quietly in the snow, sensing the aura of the ice crystals. His expression grew grave, and he quickly ordered the Flying Nightmares to flee down the mountain, engaging the flock in a distracting skirmish.</p><p>Then, taking advantage of the confusion, he leaped into the crater.</p><p>Only a few Fire Sparrows remained on guard duty within the crater. As for those huddled in their nests, they were even less likely to detect his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang successfully evaded their notice, swiftly descending.</p><p>The cold intensified as he went lower. Beneath the crater lay a layer of ice of unknown thickness. Qin Sang searched around, finally locating a crevice.</p><p>Passing through the winding crevice, he found a large open space at the bottom. Seeing the scene within, he paused.</p><p>Deep within this space, an exceptionally pure mass of cold air swirled slowly, holding its form.</p><p>At the center of this cold air, he could faintly discern a palm-sized jade tree!</p><p>"The Eternal Camphor Tree!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He had finally found it!</p><p>But he did not become complacent. Carefully surveying his surroundings, he saw three Fire Sparrows guarding the cold air, all at the peak of the Spirit Severing stage. Apart from them, no other Fire Sparrows were present.</p><p>"It seems their king has truly been conscripted. These three guards are not a threat.  The cold air, however, is troublesome. It must have been left by their king to protect the Eternal Camphor Tree, likely condensed from the power of the entire flock. It's definitely going to be tricky. Fortunately, these creatures aren't skilled in formations like cultivators.  The method used to create this cold air is crude, and there might be a way to exploit it."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang quietly summoned the Ten Yama Banners. With a gesture, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire split into three streams, shooting towards the three Fire Sparrows.</p><p>Caught completely off guard by Qin Sang's sneak attack, the three Fire Sparrows offered little resistance.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Three crisp sounds echoed as the demonic fire pierced their vital points, and they collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the edge of the cold air.  After observing it for a moment, he pondered briefly, then gathered all the Nine Nether Demonic Fire into a single stream, shaping it into a black sword.  He thrust the sword into the swirling cold air.</p><p>A strange sound rang out, and the rotating cold air suddenly slowed, wobbling unsteadily.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was indeed the Fire Sparrows' bane.  A smile touched Qin Sang's lips. He channeled more spiritual energy into the banners.</p><p>The cold air fluctuated more violently, then with a boom, a gap finally opened.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang darted inside, instantly feeling a wave of coolness wash over him.</p><p>The cold air, naturally resisting the demonic fire, began to close. There was no time to lose. Qin Sang took out a golden knife and crouched down, examining the jade tree.</p><p>Only palm-sized, the jade tree had roots that burrowed deep into the icy ground.  It had a rough trunk and lush leaves, just like a normal tree. The jade material shimmered with a rich green, exuding a sense of vitality.</p><p>If one didn't know better, they would never guess it was simply a rare type of jade, devoid of life.</p><p>Eternal Camphor Wood feared metal.</p><p>Holding a jade box in one hand and the golden knife in the other, Qin Sang carefully slid the blade along the base of the Eternal Camphor Tree, effortlessly severing it. He placed the tree into the jade box.</p><p>As long as the roots remained, the Eternal Camphor Tree would slowly regrow. Qin Sang wouldn't do something as short-sighted as destroying it completely.</p><p>Having obtained the Eternal Camphor Tree, Qin Sang immediately retreated, withdrawing the Ten Yama Banners and leaving without a backward glance.</p><p>The crater's edge was in complete chaos. The Flying Nightmares, following Qin Sang's orders, had drawn the Fire Sparrows' attention, enduring countless blasts of cold air, and were now fleeing in disarray.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared, retrieved the Flying Nightmares, and activated his teleportation talisman, swiftly departing.</p><p>The Fire Sparrows pursued for a while, but Qin Sang quickly outdistanced them, leaving them to return empty-handed.</p><p>His mission finally accomplished, Qin Sang was in high spirits. He set his course southward.</p><p>He flew to the very edge of this sea region, the border of uncharted territory.  There, he found an island with a spiritual vein, carved out a cave, and prepared to settle down for a while.</p><p>After attending to other matters, Qin Sang took out the Yin Ring of the Concentric Rings of Primordial Harmony, the Eternal Camphor Tree, and several other spiritual materials, ready to begin refining his magical treasure!</p>
