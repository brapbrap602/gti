<h1>Chapter 2069: The Holy Statue</h1><p>The Bottomless Demonic Abyss was now encircled by towering mountains, artificially raised by the cultivators of the Storm Realm using grand formations to pile earth and stone. They had diverted nearby spirit veins, harnessing the wind and gathering water, creating a landscape brimming with spiritual energy, entirely rejuvenated.</p><p>Now, this was arguably the most important place for the Storm Realm cultivators. Not only was it protected by a magnificent guardian spirit formation, but countless guards were also stationed here.</p><p>Sufficiently safe, rich in Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, and the crucial junction between the two realms, an Immortal City had spontaneously formed here.  As more and more cultivators settled here, the city expanded again and again, becoming one of the most prosperous places in the entire Northern Sea Four Realms.</p><p>Shen Chen emerged from the Teleportation Hall, clouds forming beneath his feet. The Commander of the guards recognized him and hastily bowed, "Farewell, Alliance Leader Shen!"</p><p>The other guards also wore expressions of respect.</p><p>Shen Chen nodded with the air of a transcendent expert, rising into the air and vanishing into a small dot on the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>One guard exclaimed excitedly, "Alliance Leader Shen's visit to the Northern Sea, could it be that he has refined some powerful artifact and personally delivered it?"</p><p>"It's possible. I heard those monkeys are getting restless again, constantly encroaching on our borders," another guard sighed. "Hopefully, there won't be any major upheavals this time. It's our turn to go to sea next month."</p><p>The expressions of the guards all darkened.</p><p>Guarding the Teleportation Formation was undoubtedly a desirable assignment, but it also meant countless people, including disciples of major sects, were vying for the position.</p><p>With external threats, no one in the Storm Realm could remain aloof. Everyone had to contribute, and the disciples of major sects, with the patronage of their elders, had an easier time securing less dangerous duties.</p><p>To ensure fairness, rotations had become customary.</p><p>"What's the use of worrying so much? If we really go to the battlefield, can we be deserters? Killing a couple of monkeys will make it worthwhile!"</p><p>The Commander barked, silencing the guards.</p><p>Unaware of the guards' discussion, Shen Chen was calculating what spirit materials he needed to collect from the various sects.</p><p>He didn't have to do this himself, but since he was going to visit the Xuan Tian Palace, he came personally.</p><p>He moved unimpeded through the Immortal City, quickly flying beyond its walls. He saw cities scattered like stars on the earth and flickering spiritual lights among the mountains and forests, the radiance of formations and restrictions.</p><p>After this place rose to prominence, many rogue cultivators and smaller sects relocated their mountain gates here, some bringing their affiliated cultivation families and mortals, taking root in the wilderness, creating the prosperity of today.</p><p>Shen Chen, having lived through the old era, still remembered what the Storm Realm used to look like. Seeing the current scene, he couldn't help but sigh, "It would be perfect without the Changyou Clan…"</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, Shen Chen suddenly felt his vision blur, two figures appearing out of thin air in the distance ahead.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Shen Chen was startled. Even with his early Nascent Soul cultivation, he hadn't detected anything before these two appeared.</p><p>No, there were three!</p><p>One of them had a small person sitting on their shoulder, tilting their small head and looking at him.</p><p>Over the years of fighting the Changyou Clan, the Storm Realm had been trapped in this area, but they weren't entirely ignorant of the outside world.</p><p>It was said that the Otherfolk had tribes of all shapes and sizes. Could these be helpers invited by the Changyou Clan, specifically to intercept him?</p><p>But his decision to come was impromptu. How could they know he would be here at this time? Could there be a traitor in the alliance or Luye, leaking his whereabouts?</p><p>It must be said that Shen Chen had a vivid imagination, countless thoughts flashing through his mind in an instant. His reaction was equally swift, immediately activating his spirit armor and retreating backward.</p><p>The next moment, Shen Chen froze, his gaze fixed on an even more unexpected person.</p><p>Looking at the all-too-familiar face, Shen Chen's eyes widened.</p><p>"What, after just a few hundred years, you no longer recognize your master?" Qin Sang revealed a slight smile, his hands clasped behind his back as he looked at his disciple.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Shen Chen's whole body trembled, the words escaping his lips.</p><p>If he had any doubts before that it might be an impersonator, now he was absolutely certain. This was his master!</p><p>His master wasn't dead, he had returned!</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't help but call out again, suppressing his excitement, flying towards Qin Sang and kowtowing in the clouds, "Disciple greets Master!"</p><p>Seeing his disciple, Qin Sang also felt a stir of emotion.</p><p>To him, the Storm Realm, though not his birthplace, was more like home than anywhere else. Returning here, he felt an unprecedented tranquility in his mind and spirit.</p><p>Since ascending to the Rune Realm, he had felt like a drifting duckweed. Perhaps it was this feeling that drove him, unwilling to casually establish a Daoist compound, nor wishing to stay in Moonripple Bay.</p><p>Returning here, he seemed to have found his roots. In the vast and boundless Grand Myriad World, he finally had a place of his own. Many old friends might have long passed away, but there were also some he could reunite with.</p><p>Those increasingly distant memories now had a foundation, no longer ethereal, suddenly pulled closer, their colors becoming vivid once more.</p><p>He vaguely remembered that he hadn't placed much importance on this disciple when he first took him in, though later he fulfilled his responsibilities as a master.</p><p>When he left, Shen Chen had already broken through to the Nascent Soul realm, and now he was at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Rise."</p><p>A spark of spiritual light lifted Shen Chen up.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his now mature disciple and nodded, "Not bad."</p><p>Shen Chen didn't yet know Qin Sang's cultivation level, but the moment he confirmed his master's return, for some reason, all the pressure and burdens on his shoulders seemed to lift, as if he had returned to the carefree days in Luye.</p><p>Receiving his master's praise, Shen Chen's face showed no pride. "Disciple has been distracted by refining and neglected cultivation. Please punish me, Master."</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Those guards called you Alliance Leader?"</p><p>"Yes! With the continuous war against the Changyou Clan, to face the external enemy, the refining experts of various sects gathered together and formed an alliance called Heavenly Craft, jointly refining the artifacts and magical treasures needed on the battlefield."</p><p>Speaking of this, Shen Chen said somewhat ashamedly, "The position of Alliance Leader should have gone to the瓊影門 (Qiong Ying Sect), but their Sect Master claimed that sect affairs were too demanding and pushed the position onto me."</p><p>Seeing his expression, Qin Sang feigned displeasure, "The various sects jointly recommended you as the Alliance Leader of Heavenly Craft, indicating that your abilities have convinced them.  As my disciple, you should have the courage to take on responsibility!"</p><p>He knew his disciple's talent. On his journey back, he had considered that if Shen Chen could cross the Nascent Soul tribulation, he would inherit his mantle of refining.</p><p>Shen Chen took a deep breath, no longer hesitant in his heart, "Disciple will heed Master's teachings!"</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about Shen Chen's intentions, learning that he was going to Xuan Tian Palace. Qin Sang asked, "Where is Liu Li now?"</p><p>"Reporting to Master, Fairy Liu Li is currently in secluded cultivation at Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't help but steal a glance at Qin Sang.</p><p>Over the years, rumors about his Master and Fairy Liu Li had been flying around. As Qin Sang's disciple, he knew some of them weren't just rumors and had pieced together the history of his Master and Fairy Liu Li's relationship.</p><p>He had always considered Fairy Liu Li as his master's wife.</p><p>Shen Chen had personally witnessed Fairy Liu Li's lonely figure standing before Master's holy statue, and he couldn't help but feel happy for her. "Knowing Master has returned, how overjoyed Fairy Liu Li will be!"</p><p>Learning that Liu Li was safe and sound, Qin Sang was naturally delighted. "How long has Liu Li been in seclusion?"</p><p>Shen Chen thought for a moment, "It should have been several decades. It's said that Fairy Liu Li is attempting to break through a certain bottleneck this time."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Liu Li was in a critical stage of her breakthrough and shouldn't be disturbed.  Since he had returned, they could meet anytime after Liu Li emerged from seclusion. There was no need to rush.</p><p>"You said the Jade Axe brought you across?"</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, "On my way here, I paid a visit to our mountain gate. Senior Brother then activated Luye to send me here. It shouldn't have gone too far yet."</p><p>After the discovery of this Teleportation Formation, connecting the Middle Continent and the Northern Sea, the two branches of the Green Ram Temple finally made contact.</p><p>Shen Chen remembered Qin Sang's teachings when the sect was founded, and he wasn't keen on power or adept at developing the sect. He willingly integrated the Middle Continent Green Ram Temple into the Northern Sea Green Ram Temple, acknowledging Li Yufu as the Temple Master.</p><p>Later, for convenience, at Liu Li's suggestion, it was decided to make Luye the Green Ram Temple's main location, moving the sect's valuable possessions there, with Li Yufu permanently stationed there.</p><p>Of course, the Northern Sea Green Ram Temple wasn't abandoned; many disciples still cultivated there.</p><p>"Let's go to Luye first," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Shen Chen acknowledged the order and led the way.</p><p>"Don't reveal our identities," Qin Sang circulated his True Essence, changing his appearance and turning to Si Lu and Ji Hong.  "Please also disguise yourselves, fellow Daoists."</p><p>Si Lu nodded, a wisp of grayish-white air flying out from between his eyebrows, circling his body before dissipating, his appearance drastically changing.</p><p>He transformed into a female human cultivator, while Ji Hong transformed into a small monkey, resembling Si Lu's spirit beast.</p><p>Ji Hong looked at himself, not feeling offended in the slightest, but rather quite intrigued. He pulled out a golden fruit and, squatting on Si Lu's shoulder, began to eat with gusto.</p><p>The corner of Shen Chen's eye twitched.  Ever since the feud with the Changyou Clan began, the monkey demons of the Storm Realm had also been implicated, becoming unwelcome.</p><p>...</p><p>"Alliance Leader Shen, you're back?"</p><p>Seeing Shen Chen return so quickly, the Commander was inwardly surprised. He glanced at the two unfamiliar cultivators behind Shen Chen.</p><p>However, with Shen Chen's status, he naturally didn't need to be inspected.</p><p>Shen Chen nodded and took out spirit stones, "Activate the Grand Teleportation Formation, we'll return to the Middle Continent now."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Commander didn't dare to hesitate, immediately following the order.</p><p>"Personally escorted by Alliance Leader Shen, could it be that these two are accomplished Daoist friends in the way of refining, joining the Heavenly Craft Alliance?"</p><p>The Commander speculated silently, feeling a tinge of envy.</p><p>The Teleportation Formation was located at the very bottom of the Demonic Abyss. Now, the abyss no longer held any trace of its sinister aura, having been transformed into a vast space, its walls inlaid with luminous pearls, brightly lit.</p><p>Everyone stepped onto the Teleportation Formation. With a flash of spiritual light, they arrived in the Middle Continent.</p><p>Across from them was another bustling Immortal City. Qin Sang's mind stirred, sensing a colossal being in the distance – it was Luye!</p><p>"After the storm dissipated, a vast expanse of land appeared between the Middle Continent and the Western Lands, now collectively called the Middle Continent. Nourished by Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi, the formerly desolate realm of flowing magma is now covered in cultivation sacred grounds. Some fortunate Daoist friends have even found ancient secluded mansions here, reaping great rewards.</p><p>"The Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea were breached by the Changyou Clan, and those Daoist friends were forced to migrate and were settled here. Of course, many sects and rogue cultivators also found better blessed lands here, establishing their mountain gates.</p><p>"Now we only have the Northern Sea and this continent left, with most of the various races gathered in these two places.  However, the Middle Continent is vast enough, with abundant Yuan Qi, and it doesn't feel crowded at all."</p><p>Shen Chen walked beside Qin Sang, describing the changes of these years.</p><p>As they spoke, they approached Luye.</p><p>Nowadays, Luye could wander the entire Middle Continent, previously only limited by the storm.</p><p>Luye was no longer constantly hidden, appearing every so often for the world to see.  This served both to allow people to admire Qin Sang's holy statue and to boost morale.</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Luye's main body was still as large as ever, but the edges had been built up with layers of Daoist halls and pavilions, able to accommodate more cultivators. The formation had also been modified, its power even greater.</p><p>Naturally, the spiritual energy here was even richer.  The interior of Luye had also changed greatly, but the area around his cave remained the same, becoming a forbidden zone.</p><p>His gaze swept across every area, finally landing on the entrance.</p><p>The canyon had been widened, the 'Luye' stele moved aside, and a tall jade statue erected in the square.</p><p>Shen Chen activated his token, and everyone passed through the formation, entering Luye.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in front of the jade statue, looking up at this holy statue with a face identical to his own.</p><p>The statue was carved from a single piece of spirit jade, facing outwards, slightly bowing its head, gazing at the beings on earth with compassionate eyes.  Its expression held a trace of worry, but more of resoluteness, as if worried about the future of all beings and determined to find a way out.</p><p>The holy statue extended its right hand, a drop of sweet dew dripping from its fingertips. Below it was a raging fire, the flames engulfing its waist, symbolizing his willingness to sacrifice himself to bring hope to the world.</p><p>This jade statue was imbued with profound spiritual meaning, its implications resonating deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know when he had such a compassionate appearance. But at the moment his eyes met the statue's, Qin Sang's mind suddenly trembled.</p><p>At this moment, he had a strange feeling, as if countless scenes were flashing before his eyes.</p><p>Some people devoutly kowtowed before the holy statue, thanking the sage for protecting all beings.</p><p>Some offered tributes, beseeching the sage to fulfill their wishes.</p><p>Some made vows, using the sage as inspiration.</p><p>Some cursed him because of the Changyou Clan.</p><p>Some simply came to sightsee, some were disdainful, some gossiped about his romantic affairs with relish…</p><p>And there was one person, standing there alone, gazing at the statue for a long time, a figure of utter loneliness.</p><p>…</p><p>The figures of these people were very blurry, impossible to recognize, quickly shattering like illusions.</p><p>Countless hazy fragments surged forth.  Qin Sang knew this wasn't an illusion, it was likely something that had truly happened.  Those who had worshipped the statue left behind a trace of divine intent, intertwined with the statue. Over time, this had developed into this power, previously attached to the statue, and now returning to its source.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly closed his eyes.</p><p>Si Lu and Ji Hong were surprised to find that Qin Sang's aura was changing.</p><p>After leaving the Fengju Jade Gate, Qin Sang hadn't attempted to break through to the mid-stage Soul Refinement realm. His cultivation was, after all, obtained from the Witch Clan's blessings and chants, requiring a period of consolidation.</p><p>There was another important reason. He had a vague feeling that there was an invisible barrier in his cultivation, which would be the biggest obstacle to his breakthrough.</p><p>At this moment, the barrier had vanished!</p>
