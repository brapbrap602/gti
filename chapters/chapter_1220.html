<h1>Chapter 1212: The Divine Light Reappears</h1><p>Qin Sang had never crossed blades with the Demon Lord Ye before, but judging from the Snake King's expression, the man before them was undoubtedly the real deal. Emerging from the blood lake, Demon Lord Ye exuded an aura even more formidable than the Snake King's, his cultivation undeniably at the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage. To Qin Sang, Demon Lord Ye felt more dangerous than the three alliance leaders he had encountered in the inner hall of the Seven Slaughter Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't tell whether this was the Demon Lord Ye from the frontlines secretly returning or if there truly were two Demon Lord Ye's. "A doppelganger? A second primordial spirit? Or some other similar secret technique?" His thoughts raced. If Demon Lord Ye possessed an avatar of equal strength, then he was undoubtedly the true number one expert of the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang had intervened to seize the treasure only after confirming his safety, but he hadn't expected to encounter such a formidable enemy just as he was about to make his escape, blocking his path. Demon Lord Ye had been hiding in the blood lake for reasons unknown, and even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had failed to detect the anomaly within. Qin Sang could only be grateful that he hadn't hesitated before acting, striking with the force of thunder.</p><p>Demon Lord Ye, too, likely hadn't anticipated the sudden appearance of an uninvited guest disrupting their plans. Otherwise, had Demon Lord Ye been prepared and set a trap, Qin Sang's situation would have been far more perilous than it was now.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang and the Snake King could only watch as the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Frost Lizard were swallowed by the blood. The source of the blood wasn't the lake itself but seemed to surge from the void, forming a crimson river in an instant, completely cutting off their retreat. The sight of the raging waves filled Qin Sang and the Snake King with dread, a sense of foreboding gripping their hearts.</p><p>After the Frost Lizard and the cultivator surnamed Lu were engulfed, there was no reaction, no sign of resistance. It was unclear what had become of them. Could Demon Lord Ye truly possess such terrifying power, capable of instantly killing a transformed demon king and a mid-Nascent Soul expert?</p><p>Compared to the Snake King, Qin Sang felt even greater pressure. Behind him, a malevolent wind closed in, the evil spirit nearly upon him. After revealing himself, Demon Lord Ye first unleashed a river of blood, then turned his gaze to Qin Sang, his eyes cold and calculating. Clearly, Qin Sang had caught his attention as well. It was no wonder—Qin Sang's earlier performance had been too dazzling, snatching a treasure from within the evil spirit right under everyone's noses and escaping unscathed. The fear he inspired in the Sin Abyss cultivators surpassed even that of the Snake King.</p><p>If things continued this way, Qin Sang would soon be caught in a pincer attack, facing enemies stronger than himself. How could he possibly escape from such a dire situation?</p><p>As Demon Lord Ye appeared, Jiang Chenzi and the other two spread out with practiced coordination, surrounding Qin Sang and the Snake King. They began to unleash a series of hand seals, fully activating the treasure banners. The three banners, planted in the air, resonated with each other, their energy connecting with the blood below. The power of the banner array transformed into a blood mist, continuously surging toward the blood river and the surroundings, draping the void in a crimson veil.</p><p>Their ambitions were vast—not only did they intend to assist Demon Lord Ye in completely suppressing the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Frost Lizard, sealing off the exit, but they also sought to lock down the entire space, preventing Qin Sang and the Snake King from escaping in any direction.</p><p>The situation was changing rapidly. Struggling to evade the evil spirit's pursuit, Qin Sang realized that once the enemy's spirit array was fully formed, both he and the Snake King would be trapped, their chances of survival slim. Within the blood river, the Frost Lizard and the cultivator surnamed Lu remained motionless, their condition unknown. This path was clearly no longer viable.</p><p>The sight of the blood river sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine. Without knowing the true nature of the river, he had no intention of recklessly charging into it to test Demon Lord Ye's strength with his own life. Qin Sang had always been decisive. Without hesitation, he merged his body with his sword, changing direction and lunging toward Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang charge straight at him, Jiang Chenzi showed no trace of panic. Instead, a cold smile crept onto his lips as he quickly communicated with his two companions through divine sense. The three treasure banners shifted, their power converging toward Qin Sang.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The Blackwood Sword blazed with unparalleled brilliance as it struck again. Its sword light pierced through the blood mist, aiming directly at Jiang Chenzi. Jiang Chenzi's expression tightened. Only when facing this sword head-on did he realize how extraordinary it was—even among top-tier magic treasures, it stood out. Sheltered behind the treasure banners, outside the array, he still felt a faint stinging sensation as the sword locked onto him.</p><p>Thick blood mist surged forward, attempting to suppress the Blackwood Sword. The sword light was forced to contract, and the Blackwood Sword seemed on the verge of being restrained. But at that moment, the Blackwood Sword vanished into thin air, and the Seven Souls Slaughter Array reappeared!</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back. The Blackwood Sword, empowered by the sword array, tore through the blood mist and advanced with ferocious speed. However, they were facing three Nascent Soul experts. The Blackwood Sword alone couldn't bear the burden, and Qin Sang, having only recently formed his Nascent Soul, had limits to how much power he could unleash through the Seven Souls Slaughter Array.</p><p>At this moment, the Twelve Demon Banners continued to hover around Qin Sang, while the Nine Nether Demon Fire spread out behind him, making him appear as if he had emerged from a sea of black flames, his back enveloped in a dark inferno. Additionally, a tortoise shell floated behind him, occasionally emitting a soft "dong-dong" sound and radiating a gentle, profound water energy, like a massive shield.</p><p>This was a desperate move. Qin Sang had to rely on the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Nine Lives Mystic Tortoise Shell to barely protect himself from the evil spirit's attacks. Both treasures were indispensable, and neither could be spared.</p><p>Seeing the Blackwood Sword hindered, Qin Sang was about to unleash the *Thunder Commanding Art* and all his other techniques when a dazzling blade light suddenly slashed out from his side!</p><p>"The Snake King has finally made his move!" Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Earlier, while making his decision, Qin Sang had secretly sent a message to the Snake King, explaining that this path was no longer viable and that he knew of another escape route. However, Qin Sang wasn't sure what choice the Snake King would make. After all, the Snake King had come treasure hunting alongside the cultivator surnamed Lu, and their trust in each other was likely stronger. Moreover, the exit was right below them—if they could break through the blood river's blockade, they could escape.</p><p>Fortunately, the Snake King ultimately chose to trust Qin Sang.</p><p>The black blade followed closely behind the Blackwood Sword, slashing toward Jiang Chenzi. The blade's momentum was no less imposing than the Blackwood Sword's, its hundred-zhang blade light resembling a spatial rift. The ease on Jiang Chenzi's face vanished, replaced by a look of grave seriousness.</p><p>The three treasure banners intertwined with divine patterns, and endless blood surged forth, forming layer upon layer of barriers. The Blackwood Sword and the black blade advanced side by side, jointly shattering the barriers. But as they did so, their own power rapidly diminished. Just as they were about to break through the blockade and strike Jiang Chenzi, their strength was nearly exhausted.</p><p>A smile returned to Jiang Chenzi's face as he prepared to activate the spirit array and force them back. But then, his expression froze.</p><p>The dimmed Blackwood Sword flickered, and in an instant, a streak of bloody light splashed forth.</p><p>They were all too familiar with this light.</p><p>The Blood Filth Divine Light!</p><p>Demon Lord Ye, in his quest to achieve victory in one fell swoop, had gone to great lengths to gather enough Blood Filth Mulberry to complete the Filth Blood Array. His efforts had not been in vain—within the Purple Micro Palace, he had instantly rendered most of the cultivators' treasures useless. Unfortunately, news of his plan had somehow leaked, and despite destroying so many precious spirit woods, the surprise attack had only achieved mediocre results. The war that followed had dragged on for over a century.</p><p>"Returning the favor in kind…" Jiang Chenzi suddenly thought to himself.</p>
