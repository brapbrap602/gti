<h1>Chapter 1647: The Stain of Demonic Influence</h1><p>Chapter 1647: The Stain of Demonic Influence</p><p>The thousand-year-old Bodhi tree still stands,</p><p>now tall and imposing like a canopy.</p><p>A serene, secluded courtyard, a small meditation hall.</p><p>A nun from the Yan Yue Temple stands before the courtyard, solemn and still, seemingly contemplating the feelings of the temple’s founder.</p><p>This was once the place where the Yan Yue Temple’s founder practiced.</p><p>Years ago, her Dao companion ascended to immortality after traveling east across the sea. Unable to bear the pain of separation, the founder began studying Buddhism before becoming a nun. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect specially created this pure land for her within their sect.</p><p>Even after she established the Yan Yue Temple, this meditation hall remained.</p><p>The teleportation array leading to the old Yan Yue Temple site is not far from the courtyard.</p><p>They found the old temple site, but unexpectedly, the Yan Yue Temple had been severely damaged in that great war.  After so much time, it took considerable effort to locate it.</p><p>Fortunately, the teleportation array remained intact, allowing all the nuns to enter.</p><p>The senior nun, behaving with utmost respect, apologized before entering. Inside, the furnishings were extremely simple, only a meditation cushion, with no relics of the founder.</p><p>After paying their respects to the founder, the senior nun led the other nuns back out. Their main purpose was to seek opportunities within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>"What a magnificent immortal estate!"</p><p>A young nun exclaimed.</p><p>Others, gazing at the towering peaks and heavily guarded ruins of the estate, shared her awe.</p><p>"Master, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is so vast. Where should we go first?"</p><p>The young nun asked the senior nun.</p><p>Leading her companions up a nearby peak to survey the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's terrain, the senior nun pondered,  "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect is centered around five main sects, with the Emperor-Bestowed Mountain shared by them, and the Ancient Immortal Palace—all locations of great opportunity. Our founder practiced the Water Sect lineage; her Dao companion was the master of the Gold Sect.  Our Yan Yue Temple’s techniques are derived from these two sects."</p><p>"Is the *Grand Beginning Golden Gang Sword Scripture* a true Gold Sect transmission? Our temple lacks the final three stages. Can we find them here?" The young nun's face lit up with excitement.</p><p>"Indeed, the Gold Sect specializes in slaughter and swordsmanship. The immortal mountain where the Gold Sect Palace once stood was known as the Central Plains' sacred ground for sword cultivators. Due to a vow, the founder only passed down the first six stages of the scripture to the Yan Yue Temple. The final three stages are the Gold Sect Palace's closely guarded secrets."</p><p>The senior nun recounted the history of their techniques with familiarity.</p><p>The young nun, who cultivated this sword scripture, was overjoyed and advocated for going to the Gold Sect Palace first.</p><p>However, some of their companions cultivated Water Sect techniques.</p><p>Of course, most, including Liuli, hoped to find the entrance to the Ancient Immortal Palace first.</p><p>She pondered a rumor the senior nun had mentioned earlier: the Wuxiang Immortal Sect once controlled an Ancient Immortal Palace!</p><p>"The Central Plains Immortal Palace… is it connected to the Ziwei Palace that took Master away?"</p><p>A rare ripple stirred within Liuli's thoughts.</p><p>An image also flashed in her mind. Qin Sang had mentioned a purpose for coming to the Central Plains: to search for the Immortal Palace and obtain a crucial technique.</p><p>Their paths converged.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn’t know the Palace's location.</p><p>Since parting in the Western Desert years ago, she hadn’t seen him, and the sudden events prevented her from contacting him.</p><p>Liuli furrowed her brow.</p><p>Unable to reach a consensus, someone suggested splitting up, but the senior nun rejected the idea.  "We spent too long searching for our temple. Those at the entrance should soon find a way through the cloud barrier.  And we don't know how many powerful cultivators have already entered, many of uncertain origins. Splitting up is too dangerous!"</p><p>Finally, they decided to head towards the prominent Emperor-Bestowed Mountain first, observing the situation of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect before deciding their next move.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the immortal estate.</p><p>More and more cultivators gathered.</p><p>News of the immortal estate's appearance swept through the two Southern Barbarian prefectures, quickly spreading throughout the entire Central Plains.</p><p>Cultivators converged from all directions.</p><p>Mount Taiyue was teeming with people.</p><p>Most cultivators, lacking sufficient cultivation, were blocked by the turbulent currents outside, gazing up at the vortex in the sky.</p><p>As time passed, the power of the turbulent currents in the passage weakened, allowing Golden Core stage cultivators to withstand the impact and enter the storm.</p><p>However, upon entering, they found that the leading Nascent Soul masters were blocked by a cloud barrier, unable to proceed.  They sighed, resigned to waiting for the barrier to dissipate.</p><p>Gradually, the cloud barrier became thicker and more imposing.</p><p>The clouds were like a sea, filling the entire passage, incredibly violent.</p><p>After some investigation and attempts, the Nascent Soul cultivators finally found some patterns, and except for a few independent cultivators, they began entering the clouds in groups.</p><p>Inside the cloud sea.</p><p>Suddenly, a green rainbow pierced through the clouds, and several figures followed the rainbow, flying out of the cloud sea.</p><p>Hua Chenzi, the Grand Elder of Taiyue Sect, led the charge, followed closely by other Taiyue and Daoist masters.</p><p>"We're finally in!"</p><p>An Eight-Scene Yuan Ying cultivator exclaimed, gazing at the scene from the entrance's peak.  The depth of Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's legacy was astonishing.</p><p>"Quickly find the Sect Master and Yue Zongzhu's secret marks!"</p><p>The cultivators from the two sects exchanged a brief word and immediately began their search.</p><p>Shortly after their arrival, Wu Xiang Immortal Sect descendants also fought their way through the clouds, followed by a growing number of Yuan Ying cultivators. The sect grounds were quickly bustling!</p><p>...</p><p>Emperor Bestowed Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang chose a stone path on the southwest side of Emperor Bestowed Mountain, taking a different route from Zhu Wu Dao and the others. He had set out early and was already nearing the mountain's halfway point.</p><p>The Soul-Searching Weeping Spirit Cave Master learned of their agreement with Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>To save his life, Zhu Wu Dao swore an oath on his heart demon.  </p><p>If Zhu Wu Dao escaped the Daoist pursuit and survived, they agreed to meet at the foot of Emperor Bestowed Mountain. Zhu Wu Dao swore he would lead them to a Nascent Divinity cultivation opportunity.</p><p>However, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xing Dao were shrewd negotiators; they pressured Zhu Wu Dao into revealing crucial information about the wordless jade tablet and the Five-Phase Tokens.</p><p>Even if Zhu Wu Dao were captured and killed, they could still use the Five-Phase Tokens to enter Emperor Bestowed Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had no connection with Zhu Wu Dao and his group, so he didn't bother joining them.  </p><p>Conveniently, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had been killed by him and could not participate in the rendezvous.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to use the time it would take Zhu Wu Dao and his company to arrive, to test the Five-Phase Token himself. If Zhu Wu Dao was lying, he could always track them down later.</p><p>Looking towards Emperor Bestowed Mountain, the most prominent feature was the silhouette of an ancient temple nestled in the mountain.</p><p>Only after entering did Qin Sang realize that the mountain had surprisingly few structures.</p><p>The path wound its way through the serene landscape.  Qin Sang climbed swiftly along the stone steps, the scenery untouched by human hands, except for the path itself. Not even a single wooden pavilion was visible.</p><p>Passing through a thicket, the path opened into a clearing.</p><p>A jade gate, ornately carved with dragons and phoenixes, suddenly appeared before him.</p><p>The towering jade gate bore four ancient characters, "Cloud Mountain Realm," radiating a timeless elegance.</p><p>Beyond the gate was a straight path of white jade that ascended into the clouds.  Mist, thick as a sea, veiled the path in an ethereal beauty, concealing its destination.</p><p>Each set of steps on Emperor Bestowed Mountain led to similar gates, each with different characters, each leading to a different area, all significant and restricted sections of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the location of "Cloud Mountain Realm."</p><p>However, Zhu Wu Dao claimed the wordless jade tablet was located at the summit of Emperor Bestowed Mountain, accessible from any path.  He didn’t need to worry about the route.</p><p>Arriving at the gate, Qin Sang paused, his left hand holding the Wood-Phase Token, examining the gate and the scene beyond.</p><p>After a moment, a strange glint flashed in his eyes. He paused, then summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly from his dantian.</p><p>The butterfly's shadow fluttered, landing on his shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, activating a Wu tribe secret technique to enhance the butterfly's abilities.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly spread its wings, remaining still. The markings on its eyes glowed with a soft light, resembling two actual divine eyes, brilliantly radiant.</p><p>He gazed intently beyond the gate for a long time.</p><p>Doubt began to creep into Qin Sang's expression. "An illusion?"</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly's power was known to dispel illusions.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang's tone lacked conviction.</p><p>The scene beyond the gate seemed both illusionary and real, creating a confusing and unsettling experience.</p><p>Qin Sang clutched the Wood-Phase Token and took his first step through the gate.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The surroundings remained unchanged.</p><p>As Qin Sang passed through the gate, the light dimmed, and the mist above suddenly collapsed, cascading downward like a raging torrent, carrying an overwhelming force.</p><p>Qin Sang's breath caught in his throat.</p><p>He looked up sharply, only to find the jade gate had vanished.</p><p>In a blink, the mist was upon him, its power terrifying.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to be engulfed, the mist suddenly parted to his sides.</p><p>A brilliant light shone as a protective aura formed around Qin Sang. He activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, but it failed to protect him. It was the Wood-Phase Token in his hand that deflected the mist!</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his left hand.</p><p>The token emitted a faint green light.  It was very subtle.</p><p>He hadn’t infused it with any spiritual energy.  In fact, on his way, Qin Sang had tried several times, but no energy or incantation elicited any response.</p><p>But after stepping through the gate, the token had changed.</p><p>The faint green light effortlessly parted the mist, and Qin Sang felt no impact whatsoever.</p><p>After a moment, the green light persisted.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the straight white jade steps leading upwards had shifted to the right.  A faint green glow emanated from the stone surface, a clear indication of the Wood Phase Token's influence.</p><p>Her celestial eye pierced the mist, but the end remained unseen.  Only this path lay before her.</p><p>Qin Sang began her ascent.  The jade steps were solid, not an illusion.</p><p>As she climbed, Qin Sang kept an eye on the Wood Phase Token.  The green glow pulsed rhythmically, but otherwise showed no change.  She quickened her pace.</p><p>The length of the jade steps was unreasonable!  Qin Sang estimated she'd already ascended far enough to reach the summit of Di Shou Mountain, yet the steps continued. A formation was clearly at work.</p><p>After an indeterminate distance,  Qin Sang paused.  Emerging from the mist, she saw something different: an exquisitely crafted three-story jade pavilion!</p><p>...</p><p>At the foot of Di Shou Mountain, the mountain wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>Beneath an ancient tree, two figures materialized—two Daoists. One was a female Daoist. Though dressed in Daoist robes, her features and demeanor were not typical of the Daoist order. The other, a male Daoist, wore a Daoist crown and white robes, holding a crimson sword. His bearing suggested a true cultivator.</p><p>Both were Yuan Ying stage cultivators!</p><p>Gazing at the mountain and the surrounding celestial phenomena, the female Daoist's excitement grew.  Then, remembering something, she pouted, "Senior Brother, you kept this from me!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist smiled gently. "The Daoist and Buddhist sects kept a close watch. If our Yu Tai sect's lineage as descendants of the Wu Xiang sect were revealed, what hope would we have? I followed ancestral teachings. Since our ancestors, the sect has remained hidden. Only the sect leader knew this secret.  I thought the Wu Xiang sect would never see the light of day again.  Who knew it would resurface!"</p><p>The female Daoist's pout was feigned; her smile was uncontainable.  She giggled, "So the sect recorded another way into the Wu Xiang sect's domain!  It seems our Yu Tai sect is more than just descendants!  Let those others wait outside. The treasures of the sacred mountain belong to our Yu Tai sect!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist was less optimistic. His tone turned serious. "Have you forgotten the rumors? Before the Cloud Wall erupted, several great cultivators entered the celestial palace.  Junior Sister, do not be careless!"</p><p>"What's to fear? Aren't they all vying for the celestial palace's treasures?"</p><p>Though she said this, the female Daoist's smile faded. She asked, "Senior Brother, you've kept this from me until now! What incredible treasures are here? Why didn't you go to the celestial palace, or to the Five Phases, but here?"</p><p>"Di Shou Mountain is the ancestral grounds of the Wu Xiang sect's founder.  You understand its importance.  However, I seek not the founder's legacy, but a Nascent Soul cultivator's relic!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist looked towards the summit with anticipation.</p><p>"A Nascent Soul relic?"</p><p>The female Daoist was both delighted and startled, and mostly confused. "Didn't you say the Wu Xiang sect was betrayed and destroyed by the Daoist and Buddhist sects? That their peak cultivators were all killed? How could there be a Nascent Soul relic here?"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist observed for a moment, then dashed towards the nearby steps, gesturing for the female Daoist to follow. He explained, "According to sect records, the destruction of the Wu Xiang sect wasn't solely due to betrayal. The greatest factor was that the sect was severely weakened during the Demon Calamity.  Their peak cultivators suffered heavy casualties. Even the survivors were affected by demonic corruption, giving their enemies an opening."</p><p>"Demonic corruption?" The female Daoist looked puzzled, as if hearing a foreign language. She'd never heard of these secrets before.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist pondered before continuing, "The specifics of demonic corruption aren't detailed in the records, and I can't fully explain it.  It's said the Wu Xiang sect accidentally released a powerful demon in the celestial palace, triggering the Demon Calamity. The most terrifying aspect wasn't the demon's power, but its strange method, referred to in the records as demonic corruption. Those afflicted lose themselves and become demons.  The Wu Xiang sect's negligence allowed the corruption to spread, rapidly becoming a calamity that almost destroyed the entire cultivation world!"</p><p>The female Daoist was increasingly shocked.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist was also disturbed. He paused, looking towards the summit. "When the Demon Calamity swept through the cultivation world, the Wu Xiang sect was at its peak. It paid an unimaginable price to end the calamity and subdue the powerful demon.  But after the calamity, the surviving cultivators discovered they were subtly affected by the demonic corruption.  So, the remaining Wu Xiang sect masters, gravely wounded, sealed themselves within Di Shou Mountain, intending to use formations and their profound cultivation to dispel the corruption, awakening later.  Unfortunately... they never awoke."</p><p>He produced a token, identical to the Wood Phase Token, bearing the character 'Fire'.</p>
