<h1>Chapter 1257: Deathly Silence</h1><p>Jing Yu smiled wryly, “Friends, there’s no need to spare my blushes.  Years ago, I was inadvertently drawn into the Blood Lake and encountered a powerful enemy, narrowly escaping death. Today, I owe my freedom to Fellow Daoist Mingyue…”</p><p>Qin Sang watched the ongoing battle ahead and asked, “Did you encounter attacks from the flesh puppets?”</p><p>Lord Tongyou sighed helplessly, “We hunted them proactively, intending to capture one. We had previously exhausted all means to search for Elder Ye's whereabouts, wandering aimlessly like headless flies.  We also tried to find the core of the array. But although the Black Tower Array is severely damaged, it remains extremely vast and complex.  With our abilities, it would take considerable time to decipher its patterns. The flesh puppets seem to have been nurtured by the Black Tower Array and have an intricate connection with it, so we tried to start with them.”</p><p>Qing Jun continued, “The previous tremor in the Black Tower Array was likely due to Elder Ye breaking some sort of restriction. He used a deceptive strategy to hold us at the Blood Gate for a while, preventing us from tracing him. Now, they've gone completely silent. If we don't break the Black Tower Array soon, we’ll likely be unable to stop them.”</p><p>Saying this, Qing Jun glanced at Jing Yu.</p><p>Lord Tongyou also showed an expectant look.</p><p>Jing Yu understood, “Friends, please have everyone halt. While the flesh puppets are indeed born from the Black Tower Array, they lack intelligence and are hardly alive. Capturing them wouldn't yield any answers. I know the location of the array's core; that's where I had my ordeal.  Zu Yuan painstakingly opened the Blood Lake, most likely targeting that very location.”</p><p>Then, Jing Yu briefly recounted her past encounter, omitting the existence of the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p><p>Upon escaping the flesh puppets and hearing Jing Yu’s account, everyone was astonished.</p><p>“No wonder Zu Yuan launched such a massive operation, even neglecting the battlefield!  An ancient cultivator sealed here, and yet still alive?!”</p><p>“The identity of this ancient cultivator is unknown. To want to capture Fellow Daoist Jing Yu as sustenance… certainly not a benevolent person! Does Elder Ye know what the consequences of releasing him are?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mingyue's guess is plausible.  Elder Ye probably knows the ancient cultivator is nearing the end of their life and, being wildly ambitious, wants to imprison them and extract ancient secrets!”</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd buzzed with discussion, instantly captivated by Jing Yu’s words.</p><p>They were all Nascent Soul cultivators, the most elite figures of their time, yet facing the prospect of a severed path.</p><p>No treasure was more important than their cultivation path.</p><p>While not everyone present might break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, the chance to glimpse ancient secrets from an ancient cultivator was an irresistible temptation.</p><p>Furthermore, if Zu Yuan succeeded in interrogating the ancient cultivator and obtaining ancient techniques, their power would increase significantly.  Given Elder Ye’s ambition, the two realms would know no peace again.</p><p>Securing the ancient cultivator would benefit everyone.</p><p>After learning the truth, everyone acted without hesitation, immediately deciding to follow Jing Yu to the array's core to either seize the ancient cultivator or prevent Elder Ye from breaking the seal.</p><p>Jing Yu led the way, and the others followed closely.</p><p>The array was indeed exceptionally complex.  If not for Jing Yu guiding them, Elder Ye would have likely already taken the ancient cultivator by the time they found the array's core.</p><p>Countless deadly traps shifted within the array, confusing the eyes. As they continued to fly, the shadows of the black towers began to appear more frequently, indicating their proximity to the core.</p><p>After flying for some time and circling several black towers, Jing Yu suddenly stopped.</p><p>Everyone stopped with her, seeing two black towers standing side by side in front of them.</p><p>These two black towers were almost identical to others; the unusual feature was that two more black towers stood behind them.  The four towers formed a square, enclosing a rectangular space within.</p><p>This space lacked the deadly traps they had previously encountered; only a thick, swirling blood mist surrounded a particularly large black tower, unable to escape the confines of the four towers.</p><p>This black tower was larger and taller than any they had seen before.</p><p>Everyone's gaze shifted to that black tower, but seeing no one there, they asked, “Is the ancient cultivator sealed inside this black tower?”</p><p>Jing Yu sneered and shook her head, “Have none of you noticed? This tower is merely an illusion created by the array, a deceptive tactic.  However, it's true that the person is sealed between the four towers. The Black Tower Array creates incredibly lifelike illusions; one must dispel the illusion to find the passage.”</p><p>Everyone was astonished; no one had realized it was an illusion, only marveling at the array's complexity.</p><p>Only Qin Sang had noticed a subtle anomaly beforehand.</p><p>However, he hadn't expected the entire black tower to be an illusion.  Jingyu's warning prompted him to focus his attention.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun frowned, "Forcibly breaking the illusion will expose our presence prematurely.  Do you have a better plan?"</p><p>Jingyu shook his head. "I only know brute force."</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. They had planned a stealth approach, but that was no longer feasible; they didn't have time to search for a solution.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while, but couldn't think of a better way.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to act!</p><p>Jingyu, Tongyou Mojun, and the Chongyi Daozhang and his two disciples, all possessing methods to dispel illusions, took the lead.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun produced a black gourd. With a flick of his finger, the gourd soared, spewing out head-sized black thunderbolts.  These bolts hovered around him, dormant.</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang and his disciples sat cross-legged, each swallowing a green pill. Then, the Daozhang summoned a vibrant, verdant herb, looking freshly plucked, its leaves straight like thin swords, rotating before him.  These leaves displayed a kaleidoscope of colors, unlike any naturally occurring plant; it was a magical treasure.</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang grasped the treasure and swept his arm, unleashing streams of light imbued with the five elemental forces.  His disciples remained motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the power of the light increasing exponentially, surpassing the Daozhang's normal capabilities. The three were jointly activating the treasure, but he couldn't understand how.</p><p>"Could it be because of the pills?"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered to his senior sister.</p><p>It turned out that the Taiyi Danzong's true teachings comprised a single cultivation technique, but with varying interpretations and manifestations depending on the cultivator. The pills allowed for temporary alteration of the technique's characteristics, harmonizing intent and spiritual energy. This not only amplified their power, but also enabled feats beyond individual capabilities, such as wielding exceptionally powerful artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed.</p><p>At that moment, Jingyu transformed into his beast form.  He opened his mouth, and a silver ray of light shot into the blood mist, striking towards the illusory tower.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun unleashed all his thunderbolts.</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang’s arm continued to move, the radiant light cascading forth in a powerful wave, following close behind.</p>
