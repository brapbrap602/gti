<h1>Chapter 153: Gathering of All Parties</h1><p>Facing Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang felt a subtle pressure he hadn't experienced before.</p><p>This puzzled Qin Sang.</p><p>He was confident in his strength, never having felt such pressure except when facing Nascent Soul ancestors. Not even Blood Bat or Daoist Xiaoyun had given him this feeling.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, after the trial, Ning Wu Hui suddenly changed like this. Could it be that he encountered some incredible opportunity within the trial realm?</p><p>That would explain it.</p><p>No wonder he didn't compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid!</p><p>It seems that the trial realm still holds many unknown secrets, a legacy left by human ancestors for future generations.</p><p>"It's good to see you safe, Fellow Daoist Ning. I waited for a long time and worried you were trapped by the Thousand Mountain Formation or encountered some accident. I didn't know what to do."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with relief.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui quickly explained, "I didn't expect my sect to require all disciples to travel together. I didn't have a chance to tell you, Fellow Daoist. I participated in this trial for a spiritual herb that grows within the trial realm. I didn't expect it would take so long..."</p><p>"Did you find it?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked with concern.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded, his tone relaxed. "Although I encountered many twists and turns, I finally harvested the mature spiritual herb. Then I spent time refining it, which is why I came out late."</p><p>Judging from Ning Wu Hui's tone, this spiritual herb seemed even more precious than the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>The change in him was likely related to the spiritual herb.</p><p>Qin Sang felt curious but saw that Ning Wu Hui was reluctant to explain further, so he didn't press the matter.</p><p>"It's getting late. If you have no other pressing matters, Fellow Daoist Qin, let's set off," Ning Wu Hui said, glancing toward the inner depths of the hall, without asking Qin Sang whether he had obtained any Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. His only goal was to meet Senior Qing Zhu and find the ancient teleportation formation. He cared about nothing else.</p><p>After a brief rest, the two flew down the mountain and continued deeper into the inner hall.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, his expression gradually becoming serious.</p><p>At first, he didn't notice it, but as they continued deeper, the space within the inner hall became increasingly unstable. Not long after entering, they saw a spatial rift.</p><p>According to Ning Wu Hui, there were also mobile and invisible spatial rifts within.</p><p>Remnants of ancient immortal restrictions also appeared more frequently.</p><p>Many were unexplored, not because they didn't want to, but because they couldn't.  Just looking at those restrictions from afar, Qin Sang could sense the danger they posed.</p><p>Their predecessors had charted paths that allowed deeper penetration into the inner hall, but these were only relatively safe.  Those who entered needed to adapt to the circumstances, never letting their guard down, and certainly not daring to wander randomly.</p><p>Those with insufficient strength would only find death here.</p><p>These paths led to different destinations. Ning Wu Hui chose one that required a large detour.</p><p>They were currently traveling on foot. Although spatial rifts were uncommon here, they didn't dare to fly.</p><p>"Chirp... Chirp..."</p><p>Strange sounds came from a nearby mountain.</p><p>'Rustle... Rustle...'</p><p>A shadow suddenly rose from the mountaintop. Upon closer inspection, they were oddly shaped birds taking flight. They circled their territory, scouting for enemies.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui hid in the shadow of a giant boulder, holding their breath.</p><p>Only after the birds flew past did they hurriedly leave and continue forward.</p><p>This wasn't their first such encounter.</p><p>It wasn't that they couldn't defeat the birds, but they feared that being surrounded by beasts in the inner hall would trigger a chain reaction, attracting even stronger beasts.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul ancestors adopted the same approach.</p><p>"Chirp!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sound and saw a strange bird.  Somehow, it hadn't flown with its companions and hadn't been visible before. Now it suddenly appeared, having discovered their presence.</p><p>Warned by their companion, the flock of birds became agitated.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt countless fierce gazes lock onto him. He knew this was bad. Without hesitation, he summoned the Ebony Sword and simultaneously, light flashed behind him. He even activated his Demonic Transformation.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's reaction was equally swift.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A crimson-gold spirit sword and the Ebony Sword shot towards the strange bird. The bird flapped its wings to dodge but to no avail.  It was ultimately slain by a sword beam split from Qin Sang's attack.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence, flinging the bird's corpse far away.  Then, with a flash of light, he and Ning Wu Hui fled.</p><p>The flock of birds lost their target, screeching in anger, but were ultimately drawn by the scent of blood, devouring their companion's corpse.</p><p>After shaking off the birds, they immediately withdrew their escape light and landed.</p><p>"Every step in the inner hall is fraught with danger."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  They were still a long way from Ning Wu Hui's destination.</p><p>He decided to maintain the Demonic Transformation and keep his phoenix wings extended in case of emergencies.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ning Wu Hui beside him.</p><p>He had only activated the Demonic Transformation, but his speed was already unmatched by cultivators of the same rank. Ning Wu Hui was effortlessly keeping pace with him.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui was also secretly examining Qin Sang's wings. The phoenix wings were too eye-catching, exceptionally magnificent.  Closer inspection revealed their illusory nature.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist not only excels in swordsmanship but also masters such profound escape techniques!"</p><p>Ning Wu Hui exclaimed in admiration, mistaking the phoenix wings for the manifestation of some top-tier escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang countered, "Fellow Daoist is the unfathomable one, handling everything with ease."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui smiled faintly and admitted, "Before today, I was indeed inferior to you."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was astonished. Ning Wu Hui had definitely obtained a great opportunity within the trial realm.</p><p>They continued on as they spoke.</p><p>Needless to say, the journey was perilous. The terrain wasn't all mountains. They even encountered a complex of golden halls, but they were sealed by formations, impossible to enter.</p><p>"We've been walking for so long, why haven't we seen any Nascent Soul ancestors?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>The Nascent Soul ancestors had entered before them, yet they hadn't seen a single trace along the way.</p><p>"The Gloomy Valley is the deepest location currently explorable. Many paths lead to it. The one I chose is the most circuitous.  The decipherable restrictions along this route have mostly been plundered. It's considered a dead end. Nascent Soul ancestors don't need to be as cautious as us, so they rarely choose this path..."</p><p>After a pause, Ning Wu Hui added, "Forcing lower-level cultivators to test the power of ancient restrictions is common in the cultivation world, especially among those demonic ancestors. They wouldn't mind having a couple more puppets. To avoid the Nascent Soul cultivators, I carefully selected this route."</p><p>Their destination was indeed the Gloomy Valley!</p><p>As they spoke, they suddenly stopped.</p><p>Ahead, the flat terrain disappeared, replaced by a dark forest.</p><p>Ancient trees towered within the forest, some reaching thousands of feet high, their crowns intertwined, their foliage blocking out the sun. Yet, no sign of life could be felt within.</p><p>The forest was long dead, all the plants fossilized. This forest had been perfectly preserved, enduring countless years, transformed into a gloomy stone forest. </p>
