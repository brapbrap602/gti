<h1>Chapter 368: The Crimson Orb</h1><p>Everyone was startled by the crimson orb.</p><p>This orb looked too much like a demon core!</p><p>Only a great demon at the Demon Core stage could cultivate a demon core, equivalent to the golden core of a human cultivator at the Core Formation stage. For Kong Xin to use a demon core to ward off the blood miasma seemed incredibly wasteful and audacious.</p><p>However, they soon realized something was amiss. The crimson orb didn't possess the imposing aura of a legendary demon core; it was all for show.</p><p>"Haha, so it's the inner core of a Skyfire Jiao..."</p><p>Among those present, only Yun Youzi recognized the true origin of the crimson orb.  As curious gazes turned towards him, he explained, "The Skyfire Jiao isn't a true Jiao, but a unique beast that resembles one."</p><p>"This beast has wings growing from its ribs, somewhat similar to the legendary divine beast Yinglong. However, it lacks Jiao dragon bloodline, possessing only the Jiao form.</p><p>"The most distinctive feature of the Skyfire Jiao is its ability to cultivate an inner core even before reaching the Demon Core stage.</p><p>"Of course, the Skyfire Jiao's inner core is not the same as a demon core.</p><p>"The inner core contains all the fire energy the Skyfire Jiao absorbs from the outside world, condensed into an orb. This fire energy transforms within the inner core, aiding the Skyfire Jiao's cultivation.</p><p>"When the Skyfire Jiao reaches the Demon Core stage and breaks through, the inner core is replaced by the demon core and discarded along with its shed skin.</p><p>"Only then does the fire energy within stabilize and exist independently of the Skyfire Jiao.</p><p>"A Skyfire Jiao's inner core is quite rare. Although most of the fire energy within is absorbed by the demon core during the breakthrough, a peculiar demonic fire is born from the transformation, similar in effect to the demonic fire of a Demon Core stage Skyfire Jiao.</p><p>"The inner core happens to be effective against the blood miasma. Fellow Daoist Kong using the Skyfire Jiao's inner core here is truly fitting."</p><p>Everyone suddenly understood.</p><p>Kong Xin wore an expression of admiration and bowed to Yun Youzi.</p><p>"After obtaining this crimson orb, I spent considerable effort researching its origins.  I never expected you to discern it with a single glance.</p><p>"Your knowledge is vast, I am truly impressed!</p><p>"However, there's one thing you haven't mentioned. Due to the unique nature of the Skyfire Jiao's demonic fire, the demonic fire within this crimson orb barely maintains its form. Any disturbance will cause the demonic fire to become unstable and self-immolate, rendering it useless for refining.</p><p>"Aside from providing warmth, the crimson orb serves no other purpose. Yet, it happens to be incredibly useful in the frigid Abyssal Valley, and it's my reliance for entering and exiting this place."</p><p>As he spoke, Kong Xin channeled a trace of spiritual energy, gently touching the crimson orb.</p><p>The orb flared brightly, emitting a chaotic aura. Its surface, now glowing intensely red, resembled flowing glaze, as if it were about to melt.</p><p>Everyone was astonished.</p><p>Kong Xin hastily withdrew his spiritual energy and checked the orb.  Relieved to see it unharmed, he put it down.</p><p>Yun Youzi was also surprised. "I've heard rumors about this, but never witnessed a Skyfire Jiao's inner core firsthand, so I didn't dare to speak about its properties.  Hearing Fellow Daoist Kong's explanation, I now know it's true."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  It was a larger version of a Warming Pearl.</p><p>Within the blood miasma, the Warming Pearl's effect was negligible.</p><p>As expected of the demonic fire from a Demon Core stage Skyfire Jiao, Qin Sang sensed the fiery aura emanating from the crimson orb was far more potent than a Warming Pearl.</p><p>"Follow me closely, everyone."</p><p>Kong Xin held the crimson orb aloft and entered the blood miasma first, the others following close behind.</p><p>Once fully immersed in the miasma, the dense, poisonous fog pressed in, the pressure instantly increasing tenfold.  The Azure Sun Devil Fire enveloping Qin Sang dimmed considerably, threatening to extinguish.  Qin Sang quickly channeled more spiritual energy into the jade pendant, stabilizing the devil fire.</p><p>The chill was partially blocked by the Azure Sun Devil Fire, making it bearable.</p><p>In the brief moment when the devil fire barrier almost collapsed, Qin Sang sensed the blood miasma not only carried a potent poison but also a ferocious intent capable of disturbing a cultivator's mind.</p><p>Protected by the Jade Buddha, he was unaffected by the miasma's influence, but he observed the others carefully guarding their minds, as if facing a formidable foe.</p><p>Everyone followed closely behind Kong Xin, silently flying forward.</p><p>The terrain within the blood miasma was treacherous, with undulating mountains.  Sometimes, even determining direction was difficult.  Kong Xin, however, was very familiar with the area.  He changed directions repeatedly, appearing confident.</p><p>After some time in the miasma, under Kong Xin's guidance, their journey had been remarkably safe, without incident.  Everyone's trust in him grew.</p><p>Before long, a chilling roar echoed from afar.  The roar was filled with madness, clearly not from an ordinary beast!</p><p>The sudden, terrifying roar caused everyone's expressions to change.</p><p>Qin Sang strained his eyes, but the dense miasma limited his vision.  He thought to himself that these must be the blood devils spawned from the ferocious, bloodyç…ženergy within the Abyssal Valley.</p><p>Kong Xin, leading the way, abruptly stopped.  His tone was grave.  "From here on, the devils will become more numerous.  Those on the outer perimeter aren't as powerful, but it's best to avoid them if possible. Some areas are teeming with thousands of these creatures. To be safe, everyone must follow my instructions and not act independently!"</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>Kong Xin nodded in satisfaction.  With a flash of light, he flew towards the front left, opting for a detour.</p><p>As they ventured deeper, they occasionally heard the eerie roars.</p><p>Kong Xin truly lived up to his reputation. He led them through twists and turns, expertly avoiding any encounters with the devils, always anticipating potential dangers.</p><p>Unknowingly, they had journeyed for several hours within the Abyssal Valley. Then, Kong Xin made a disconcerting move.</p><p>Despite the continuous roars ahead, he led them straight towards the source, showing no intention of detouring even as they approached.</p><p>The others exchanged glances, filled with apprehension.</p><p>Yun Youzi inquired, "Fellow Daoist Kong, the devils are just ahead. Why aren't we detouring?"</p><p>Kong Xin turned back. "You're unaware, Fellow Daoist, but I've found a small path within the valley ahead. Passing through there will allow us to avoid the devils and save at least three hours compared to a detour."</p><p>The woman in red was skeptical. "We're so close to the devils. Can you guarantee our safety?"</p><p>Kong Xin thumped his chest.  "I wouldn't lead you down this path if I wasn't confident.  As long as you follow my instructions, we won't be discovered.  Besides, I'm right here with you. If anything happens, I'll meet the same fate. I bear no grudges against any of you.  What benefit would I gain from sacrificing my own life to harm you?"</p><p>He then turned to the old man and his apprentice. "The spirit herbs you seek grow just beyond the devils' nest ahead.  I discovered this by chance. As agreed, my task is complete once I bring you there.  Harvesting the herbs is your responsibility."</p><p>The apprentice's face lit up with joy.</p><p>The old man's voice was also tinged with excitement. "Thank you, Fellow Daoist Kong!"</p>
