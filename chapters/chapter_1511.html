<h1>Chapter 1502: Four Words of Truth </h1><p>The "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" likely wasn't created by Yin Changsheng, but was a legacy recorded within the Profound Sky Command. Yin Changsheng monopolized the secret art, not passing it down to Tong Lingyu and the others.  Grasping the Numinous Treasure Four-Coil Serpent Seal and the pseudo-Numinous Treasure Suspended Sword Pavilion, Yin Changsheng was able to easily capture them and refine them into blood servants.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" was extremely complex and profound, aligning with the Great Dao. It didn't seem like the work of a contemporary cultivator.</p><p>Between a magical treasure and a Numinous Treasure, the difference in power was as vast as the chasm between heaven and earth.</p><p>This secret art was used to fill in that gap, to supplement a link in cultivation.</p><p>Thinking about it from this angle, he suddenly felt a sense of majestic grandeur. He wondered which great being had created it.</p><p>Perhaps, in the ancient era, the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" wasn't so mysterious.</p><p>Or perhaps, there were other secret arts similar to the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" that didn't necessarily require a natal magical treasure, and could use ordinary magical treasures to refine pseudo-Numinous Treasures.</p><p>What a splendid world that must have been!</p><p>The things unearthed from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in the North Barrens Realm were merely the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, his heart filled with longing.</p><p>He silently memorized the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" and handed the Profound Sky Command to Liuli.</p><p>Whether this technique could accelerate the nurturing of the Cloudwanderer Sword's sentience, Qin Sang wasn't sure. He would have to try it to find out. The difficulty of cultivating the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" was too great. His divine sense met the requirements, but his cultivation was still too weak.</p><p>Liuli had also been awakened by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Her expression had already calmed, returning to her previous aloof appearance. But no one knew how great an impact this accident had on her.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning poured down from the tribulation clouds like an azure waterfall.</p><p>Just the scattered aftershocks of the tribulation lightning caused the edges of the Heavenly Pit to continuously collapse.</p><p>The terrifying scene of the heavens collapsing and the earth splitting was truly displayed before them.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's figure had completely disappeared.</p><p>With such terrifying tribulation lightning, there was no way he could have survived.</p><p>The tribulation clouds showed signs of dissipating without continuing to gather, which also confirmed this point. Yin Changsheng, who had once shaken the North Sea with his might, had completely fallen!</p><p>Even in this final curtain call, it was still so shocking.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was in a daze.</p><p>Her feelings towards Yin Changsheng were extremely complex, containing respect, hatred, and also pity.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Tong Lingyu suddenly remembered something, turning her head to ask Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist Qin, do you still remember the eight-word maxim that Senior Xiaoxiang Zi left behind?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had always remembered this matter.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Tong Lingyu turned her head, staring straight at the place where Yin Changsheng had disappeared, her tone ethereal.</p><p>"That maxim was: After Soul Transformation, one will know their destined return!"</p><p>Soul Transformation!</p><p>After Soul Transformation, one will know their destined return!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled, immediately setting off huge waves, accompanied by countless doubts.</p><p>What was the destined return?</p><p>Did it refer to ascension, or beyond the storm belt, or perhaps just the mysterious Central Continent?</p><p>Qin Sang had personally witnessed the scene of 'ascension', so he couldn't help but think in that direction.</p><p>Why would one automatically know after Soul Transformation?</p><p>Could it be that the advancement in realm would lead to a mysterious transformation, that Soul Transformation cultivators' comprehension of the Heavenly Dao would deepen, entering a higher level and understanding the rules of the Heavenly Dao?</p><p>Knowing the destined return, how would one reach it?</p><p>Could it be that the storm belt was not endless, and that Soul Transformation cultivators could freely travel through the storms, easily leaving?</p><p>Or did it mean that Soul Transformation cultivators didn't need an ascension platform and could ascend directly?</p><p>If that were the case, the Jade Bone Demon's previous cultivation must have been unimaginable, and it must have been much easier for him to recover to the Soul Transformation stage than for the current cultivators. Why did he have to rush to the Purple Micro Palace's ascension platform at the time of ascension?</p><p>Why didn't the Ghost Mother lie low and cultivate to restore her strength, instead of traveling around, searching for the bloodline of the Wu Clan?</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that things wouldn't be so simple.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, don't look at me," Tong Lingyu said with a wry smile. "Senior Xiaoxiang Zi left behind only a maxim, without any explanation, leaving endless speculation for future generations."</p><p>At this time, there was indeed no need for Tong Lingyu to hide anything.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in thought.</p><p>Being able to say such words, Xiaoxiang Zi was undoubtedly a Soul Transformation cultivator. The eight-word maxim spoke of his own insights.</p><p>If that was the case, other Soul Transformation cultivators should be no exception.</p><p>The other Soul Transformation cultivators Qin Sang knew of were from the Four Sages Palace in the Boundless Sea. The Four Sages Palace had a complete inheritance, and he had formed a good relationship with them. They shouldn't be stingy.</p><p>Unfortunately, that path was already cut off.</p><p>"Have there been any other Soul Transformation Seniors in the North Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Tong Lingyu said: "After Senior Xiaoxiang Zi, there were none, but we cannot exclude the possibility that some Seniors were of a reclusive temperament and never showed their saintly powers in front of others. If a 'destined return' exists, they must have already left silently. Before that, it's even more ancient legends, when the structure of the North Sea was vastly different from now. It's impossible to investigate."</p><p>Living on the wind and dew, untouched by the mortal world, achieving success in the Immortal Dao and then drifting away, ascending as an immortal—this was the true immortal in the eyes of mortals.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the various sects in the North Barrens Realm.</p><p>The North Barrens Realm was small in area, but conflicts were constant, and the intensity was no less than that of the North Sea. Cultivation sects rose and fell, and as far as he knew, the one with the longest inheritance was the Upper Clarity Tranquility Palace.</p><p>The new Palace Master of the Upper Clarity Tranquility Palace chose to depend on the Green Ram Monastery. Qin Sang had once looked through the precious scriptures treasured in the palace and had not seen any records of Soul Transformation cultivators.</p><p>In any case, this was good news.</p><p>This meant that there might be a path after the Soul Transformation stage!</p><p>At least, there was a glimmer of hope of escaping this cage.</p><p>Xiaoxiang Zi did not give too much explanation, meaning these explanations are meaningless to cultivators below the Soul Transformation stage. One must first break through to the Soul Transformation stage before having the qualification to compete in the Great Dao!</p><p>When Qin Sang understood this, his spirit suddenly soared!</p><p>The higher the realm of contemporary cultivators, the more confused they felt.</p><p>When ascension to immortality became a legend, when they were imprisoned by endless storms, with the path ahead cut off, even the highest cultivation was useless. Longevity became a mirage, an illusion. What was the point of bitter cultivation?</p><p>Qin Sang had also had such doubts, but he forced himself not to think about it, firm in his current path, taking one step at a time towards his goal!</p><p>The ascension platform.</p><p>Soul Transformation.</p><p>Now, he knew of two paths!</p><p>Qin Sang's fighting spirit surged, and he suddenly raised his head, just in time to see the tribulation clouds dissipate, revealing a clear sky.</p><p>The Heavenly Pit was filled with a dazzling azure light, like vast, misty waves. The power of the tribulation lightning had not yet subsided, and countless strands of lightning roamed within the Heavenly Pit.</p><p>With the help of the Heavenly Eye divine ability, Qin Sang could vaguely see the scene inside the Heavenly Pit.</p><p>The Heavenly Pit was unrecognizable. Yin Changsheng's bones were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang saw a reflection at the edge of the Heavenly Pit, made a soft sound of surprise, and leaped down. He activated the Ruyi Pearl罡cover and charged into the lightning.</p><p>It was a broken coffin.</p><p>It was the ice coffin Yin Changsheng had been lying in.</p><p>The ice coffin was severely damaged, split in two, with many fragments. It hadn't completely annihilated within the tribulation lightning.</p><p>"Yin Changsheng had been lying in this ice coffin all along. This thing must also be a rare treasure. It's so damaged, I wonder if it can be restored."</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his chin,毫不hesitated to put away the broken coffin, and carefully picked up all the fragments.</p><p>It was freezing cold to the touch.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't examine it closely, gathering everything together. He searched the underground cave again, but found nothing.</p><p>The tribulation lightning was too ruthless!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a sigh and flew out of the Heavenly Pit. He saw that Tong Lingyu's face had a bit more color, her external injuries completely healed. Most of the restrictions in her body had been removed, and she had taken healing pills to forcibly suppress her injuries. Her strength had recovered by fifty to sixty percent.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, Hall Master Jiang and the others are still fighting bitterly with Shang Lu and the others outside the mist. Let us quickly recover our strength. I hope Fellow Daoist can lend me a hand again to clean up our sect!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu's face was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Yin Changsheng left behind the Profound Sky Command. Considering his last actions, perhaps Yin's descendants could be spared, but Shang Lu, Hall Master Yin, and the others had to be eliminated.</p><p>It wasn't just because these people sided with Yin Changsheng and attacked her.</p><p>What made Tong Lingyu determined to kill them was the Blood Slaughter Pool.</p><p>The blood in the pool came mostly from fellow sect members.</p><p>Over the years, they had followed Yin Changsheng's orders and harmed countless fellow disciples.</p><p>As the masters of a hall and the main lineage, they could do too many things. If they hadn't aided and abetted Yin Changsheng, he wouldn't have been able to avoid revealing any flaws.</p><p>Whether they acted on their own volition or were bewitched by Yin Changsheng, their crimes were unforgivable.</p><p>No sect could tolerate such people.</p><p>After a pause, Tong Lingyu glanced at Liuli and said to Qin Sang, "I will tell them that Yin Changsheng attempted to break through to Soul Transformation and failed during the tribulation, and the Four-Coil Serpent Seal was destroyed by the heavenly tribulation! When we return, I may need Fellow Daoist Qin's help again."</p><p>She was now extremely wary of Qin Sang, and hadn't asked about the whereabouts of the Four-Coil Serpent Seal from beginning to end.</p><p>She was lucky to have escaped with her life, and didn't dare to hope to reclaim the Numinous Treasure.</p><p>Moreover, with the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique", as long as the Profound Sky Palace had Great Cultivators, they wouldn't lack pseudo-Numinous Treasures, which could replace the status of Numinous Treasures.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had fallen, and at the last moment, he only had time to send out the Profound Sky Command. The lower part of the "Treasure Control Technique" was lost, and its power would never reach its peak.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang handed the Numinous Treasure to Liuli and let it acknowledge her as its master.</p><p>Wouldn't that just return it to the Profound Sky Palace?</p><p>Tong Lingyu's calculations were well-made.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and nodded. "Good!"</p><p>Helping Tong Lingyu with the aftermath was something he had already decided.</p><p>After leaving the sacred ground, cleansing the remnants of the Profound Sky Palace wouldn't be too dangerous, and it was a great opportunity to gather treasures. Qin Sang was naturally happy to participate.</p><p>Tong Lingyu breathed a sigh of relief and immediately closed her eyes to meditate, breaking the last few restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang and his incarnation shared the remaining霏Snow Pills.</p><p>It was different from when he had first arrived in the North Sea. At that time, he had nowhere to regulate his breath in the storm belt and could only continuously absorb the spiritual power from spirit stones. He had consumed too many pills, and impurities had accumulated in his body, which had to be refined first.</p><p>Now he had only taken a few pills, so the impact was minimal.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang's true essence had recovered seventy to eighty percent, Tong Lingyu also stood up.</p><p>"Aren't you going to unseal Fellow Daoist Luoyun?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Tong Lingyu shook her head, stared at the ice sculpture for a while, and said softly, "Senior Brother Luo has been sealed by Yin Changsheng's evil technique for too long and was severely injured in the blood pool. He needs to be sent to the Unfreezing Spring in the Profound Sky Palace to recuperate for a period of time. Otherwise, even if we can revive him now, it will damage his foundation and cause his realm to fall."</p><p>Leaving Luoyun here, the three of them walked into the ancient restriction, passing through the black mist.</p><p>Qin Sang fell back a step, returned the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's molt to Liuli, and asked via voice transmission, "Can you still use the Ice Soul Divine Light now?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Liuli took it and answered affirmatively, her tone without any discernible fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang was thoughtful and didn't ask any further questions.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't look back either, seemingly unaware of their little movements.</p><p>The ancient restrictions in the black mist were extremely complex, but Yin Changsheng was dead, and no one was controlling them. Moreover, Tong Lingyu had been captured by him and knew the path. With Qin Sang's help, the three quickly found their way out.</p><p>At this time, the fighting outside had stopped.</p><p>Everyone had different expressions, watching the depths of the black mist.</p><p>The tribulation clouds had just dissipated, which seemed a bit abnormal.</p><p>But firstly, the ancient restrictions blocked their view, making it hard to see clearly. Secondly, none of them had ever seen a Soul Transformation tribulation, so no one dared to make a judgment. They were stuck in a strange stalemate.</p><p>Seeing the figures outside the ancient restriction, the three of them stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a person, his eyes revealing a strange expression, and asked, "Are we killing the one surnamed Yue too?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue didn't have the Corpse Flower Blood Amber or the Nascent Soul Puppet, yet he broke through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage in just over a hundred years of bitter cultivation. He was a true genius.</p><p>Yin Changsheng needed Qin Sang to come into contact with the cicada molt to achieve his goal.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue appeared in the Body Cleansing Pond. Unless it was an act, he was likely not the mastermind.</p><p>However, he was personally nurtured by Shang Lu, and the two were like teacher and friend. Later, he also participated in the siege of Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Killing Shang Lu and leaving this person behind would be leaving a potential great enemy for themselves.</p><p>He could only blame himself for choosing the wrong side.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took a deep breath and said decisively, "Even though orchids may block the road, I must remove them!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Outside the black mist.</p><p>"There's still no news from the Palace Master, could it be..."</p><p>Shang Lu and Hall Master Yin exchanged glances, feeling inexplicably uneasy.</p><p>However, they had all experienced breakthroughs and knew that after a breakthrough, one must cultivate in seclusion to stabilize their cultivation.</p><p>And whether the Palace Master succeeded or failed, Tong Lingyu was certain to die, with no possibility of turning the tables. So they suppressed their anxious feelings and waited for the result.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>They didn't notice that a trace of joy flashed in Hall Master Jiang's eyes. He suddenly attacked.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang's magical treasure was an ice jade cauldron.</p><p>The ice jade cauldron transformed into the size of a palm, hanging upside down above Hall Master Jiang and the others. The mouth of the cauldron spilled out a faint, cold light, forming a solid barrier, which had always been used for defense.</p><p>At this moment, the ice jade cauldron suddenly flipped over, instantly transforming into a giant cauldron, smashing fiercely towards Shang Lu.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The giant cauldron was imposing.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang's cultivation was also at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. With his full-powered attack, he immediately created a terrifying pressure.</p><p>At the same time, Elder Mei stomped her foot heavily, and the path of profound ice spread rapidly in a fan shape, targeting Shang Lu and the others, who had the highest cultivation.</p><p>The others also attacked.</p><p>They all held nothing back, as if they were going to make a desperate gamble.</p><p>Seeing this, Shang Lu was furious. "Old fool, you're still stubbornly resisting!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Shang Lu summoned his magical treasure, a jade ruler, and attacked with all his might.</p><p>The surface of the jade immediately transformed into the shape of a mountain, weighing a thousand jun, with a momentum no less than that of the giant cauldron. This treasure was inherently extremely hard and did not fear collisions.</p><p>However, Shang Lu was clearly focused on protecting himself, not wanting to truly fight them to the death.</p><p>If Hall Master Jiang and the others wanted to escape, let them escape.</p><p>Where could they escape to in the vast North Sea?</p><p>Once the Palace Master emerged from the sacred ground, the situation would be completely under control. That would be the death date of these traitors!</p><p>To risk his life against these desperate people, if he was careless and something unexpected happened, he would regret it too late.</p><p>Hall Master Yin and the others had similar thoughts. They attacked to resist while dodging, leaving the escape route open for them.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Hall Master Jiang and the others had no intention of escaping at all, attacking frantically.</p><p>Seeing their strange behavior, Shang Lu suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><p>The next moment, Shang Lu suddenly felt a chill on the back of his head, and his eyes revealed a deep look of horror.</p>
