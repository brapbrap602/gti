<h1>Chapter 668: An Attempt</h1><p>Chapter 668: An Attempt</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's determination, Ran Luo didn't press further, though her attitude became noticeably friendlier.  It seemed that, like Xiaohan Region, skilled artificers and alchemists were scarce in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>"Come to Pingbo Port a month from now, Daoist. Please be punctual.  Also, a few things need clarifying. First, you are not yet a guest of the Chamber of Commerce, so we will need to collect some spirit stones for your journey.  The cost of transportation to Mount Wushan will be your responsibility…"</p><p>Ran Luo's reminders were entirely appropriate.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed to everything, setting a meeting with Ran Luo in a month. After inquiring at the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce and finding no soul-calling grass, he took his leave.</p><p>With plenty of time, Qin Sang didn't rush. He visited several more chambers of commerce, but still couldn't find what he needed.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang left the city, retrieved the black coffin containing Du Han, and flew south towards the Black Gold Mountain Range.</p><p>His map meticulously detailed the sects near the Black Gold Mountain Range. To avoid them, Qin Sang spent nine days reaching the range.</p><p>From afar, a colossal black shadow loomed on the horizon, resembling a colossal, ancient beast of black gold.</p><p>In the eyes of the local Wu tribe, the Black Gold Mountain Range was a symbol of evil and danger.  Legends spoke of lurking heretical cultivators; even local cultivators with insufficient cultivation dared not venture into its depths.</p><p>Qin Sang's map indicated a general location; the canyon wasn't deep within the range.  Nevertheless, he cautiously summoned the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Man and corpse stealthily infiltrated the mountain range, traversing valleys and peaks until they reached the canyon.</p><p>Before finding the earth-sunder aura, Qin Sang saw a familiar sight: withered vegetation, absent wildlife—the desolation growing progressively worse until it became a barren wasteland, the ground stained a grotesque black by some unknown force, exuding a heavy deathly aura.</p><p>It was almost identical to the area around the Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened. He ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to accelerate towards the front. Soon enough, wisps of black energy rose into the air, the atmosphere growing increasingly frigid.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, sensing the presence of living beings ahead, their auras weak, the strongest no more than Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang instructed the Flying Night Rakshasa to hide the coffin and conceal their presence.  Approaching stealthily, he discovered a cave dwelling at the canyon's edge, inhabited by three cultivators—likely disciples from a nearby sect, monitoring the changes in the canyon's miasma.</p><p>Warning formations surrounded the canyon, but they were no match for Qin Sang.</p><p>As Qin Sang only needed the miasma to refine corpses, and didn't want to engage with the local powers, he and the Flying Night Rakshasa bypassed the formations. The three in the cave, diligently cultivating, remained oblivious to their presence as they entered the canyon's depths.</p><p>The canyon was small; the amount of earth-sunder aura was far less than in the Earth-Sinking Cave, but sufficient for his purpose.</p><p>Finding a protruding rock, Qin Sang looked down at the churning, supremely yin aura, curious about its formation and what lay beneath.</p><p>Despite his enhanced cultivation, he still dared not recklessly enter it.</p><p>After setting up a protective spirit formation, Qin Sang opened the black coffin, retrieving Du Han, and summoned Du Xian from his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>He planned to first apply the restrictions of the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique to Du Han; if that failed, he would use Du Han's Golden Core and Du Xian's body to create a new Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Du Han, his cultivation suppressed by Qin Sang, was powerless to resist.</p><p>Looking at Du Han, Qin Sang fell into deep thought, remaining motionless for a long time.</p><p>He had immersed himself in the corpse path for years and had his own insights into corpse refinement. But to create his own corpse refinement technique? That was far beyond his capabilities.</p><p>Only those with exceptional talent could create their own cultivation techniques and divine abilities.</p><p>He could only make minor modifications based on the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique.  His hopes were slim, but he had to try before giving up.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully reviewed the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique in his mind, then, without further hesitation, channeled his true energy, launching the first corpse refinement restriction at Du Han.</p><p>Initially, it went smoothly. But as the restrictions integrated and attempted to penetrate Du Han's body, Qin Sang felt an unprecedented resistance.</p><p>Then, the true energy within Du Han suddenly surged. Before Qin Sang could react, the corpse refinement restrictions were shattered, and Du Han awoke with a jolt of agonizing pain.</p><p>Ignoring Du Han's venomous glare…</p><p>Qin Sang tried several times, finally accepting that the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*’s living corpse restriction wouldn't work on a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't giving up.  He took out a Heavenly Corpse Talisman and, under Du Han's terrified gaze, pressed it into his Purple Mansion, testing if it could seal the Golden Core cultivator's soul.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the talisman touched Du Han's soul, before Qin Sang could complete the restriction, it exploded.</p><p>Du Han, bound by Qin Sang, suffered an undefended soul attack from the talisman's explosion. He screamed, his life force rapidly fading, his soul on the verge of shattering.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. He acted quickly, using the last moments to perform a soul-searching technique on Du Han’s remaining soul. Within mere moments, Du Han was dead.</p><p>“It seems without the second half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, my path of necromancy is at an end,” Qin Sang sighed, holding Du Han's Golden Core.  He muttered, “Other necromantic techniques take too long. I need to focus on my own cultivation and not waste time on these.  And cultivating my own life-sustaining insects will also take up a significant portion of my energy; I need to discard what is unnecessary.”</p><p>He could use another sect's corpse refinement techniques to make Du Han into a corpse soldier, but it would be weak, and it risked exposing his connection to the Li Wu Palace. It wasn't worth the risk.</p><p>Qin Sang kicked Du Han's body into the abyss, where the earth-slaying energy quickly consumed it, ensuring perfect disposal.</p><p>Then Qin Sang skillfully turned Du Xian into a living corpse.</p><p>Du Xian's body.</p><p>Du Han's Golden Core.</p><p>Without a doubt, another Flying Night Yaksha would be created.  Having already refined himself into a Flying Night Yaksha, Qin Sang was extremely familiar with the technique.  However, he wasn't careless. He only had one Heavenly Corpse Talisman left, and he couldn’t afford to squander it.</p><p>A spirit array concealed all fluctuations from the fissure; the three in the cave knew nothing of what happened below.</p><p>Three days later, two dark figures stood on either side of Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Two Flying Night Yashas punched each other simultaneously.</p><p>Yu Hua only trembled slightly, while Du Xian flew back several meters before managing to regain his footing.</p><p>“Though newly created, it’s clear that Du Xian is significantly weaker than Yu Hua, but he's still strong enough for combat,” Qin Sang murmured, storing the two Flying Night Yashas in his corpse puppet bag to allow them to gradually strengthen.</p>
