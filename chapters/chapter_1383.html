<h1></h1><p>A ray of escaping light  dissipated, and a Core Formation stage armored youth landed before the hall.</p><p>The armored youth hurried into the main hall, paying respects to the three people within one by one.</p><p>"Have you found any trace of that person?"</p><p>Before the armored youth could report, the blue-robed old man took the initiative to ask.</p><p>"Reporting to Master, upon receiving the order, this disciple immediately personally led people to patrol between the various islands, searching for five days, traversing almost all the islands, but found nothing unusual."</p><p>The armored youth cupped his fist and said.</p><p>The blue-robed old man nodded slightly, not feeling surprised.</p><p>From that person's actions, it could be seen that he was very suspicious and would certainly not leave any traces.</p><p>What the blue-robed old man cared about was not this, "Has the news been released?"</p><p>The armored youth nodded, "Messages have been sent to all the islands, to all cultivators, and people have been ordered to return to Wind Sun Mountain. Fourth Junior Brother must have already started acting..."</p><p>"Good! You may withdraw for now, don't make any further moves, lest you overreach yourselves ."</p><p>The blue-robed old man dismissed the youth, looking toward the two Nascent Souls, "That person is hiding somewhere to heal his injuries, as long as he comes out of seclusion and comes into contact with cultivators, he will receive the news. Unless, he has already left Wind Sun Mountain."</p><p>One of the Nascent Souls was a female cultivator, wearing a phoenix coronet and a ceremonial gown, with extraordinary beauty, looking at the armored youth's retreating figure, "Daoist Feng is planning to invite that person to deal with the Bifang together?"</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>The blue-robed old man nodded, "Fighting three demon kings alone, especially when one of them is the Bifang, even I, Feng, dare not guarantee that I can retreat unscathed. Such an expert suddenly appearing, and already having formed a feud with the Bifang, is a godsend opportunity for us, so naturally we must do our best to win him over!"</p><p>The other Nascent Soul cultivator was a male cultivator.</p><p>He had handsome features and an elegant demeanor, wearing a black robe and a long sword at his waist, like a knight-errant walking in the mortal world.</p><p>The black-robed knight-errant smiled faintly, "To be so valued by Daoist Feng, it seems this person is indeed quite skilled. However, for such an expert to intrude into this sea area at this time for no reason, could there be a trap? Daoist Feng, have you investigated this person's background?"</p><p>The blue-robed old man shook his head, "At the time, I only saw that person's escaping light  from afar, only knowing that this person is skilled in thunder escape techniques. Shen Daoist and I thought about it, but couldn't think of such a person. However, after that person left, Shen Daoist and I searched along the direction the Bifang pursued, and found a destroyed dragon ship, I wonder if it is related to this person."</p><p>"A dragon ship, could this person have come from the Star Sand Archipelago?"</p><p>The female cultivator said in surprise.</p><p>"It's not clear yet, but as long as this person is not a demon, everything will be fine. No matter what plans he has, could he possibly deceive our eyes?"</p><p>The blue-robed old man said indifferently.</p><p>"Daoist Feng is right, this person may have escaped by relying on thunder escape techniques, his true strength may not be that strong," the black-robed knight-errant also looked relaxed.</p><p>...</p><p>String Moon Realm.</p><p>An unnamed mountain.</p><p>Heavy fog.</p><p>From time to time, rays of escaping light  enter and exit the mist.</p><p>It turned out that this was where nearby cultivators held trade fairs. Of course, those who attended the trade fairs were only some insignificant low-level cultivators.</p><p>The mist fluctuated for a moment.</p><p>A figure floated out of it, it was Qin Sang, who had already entered String Moon Island.</p><p>To get away from the disturbance, Qin Sang took great pains, going around in a big circle, and finally arrived at String Moon Island, only then did his tense mind ease, and he began to inquire about the situation nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the mist, his figure swayed, and disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Immediately afterward, another person came out, rubbed his eyes vigorously, muttered to himself, and left in a hurry.</p><p>"Wind Sun Mountain..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountaintop, looking toward the direction of Moon Tip.</p><p>According to the information he had found, Wind Sun Mountain was a Nascent Soul's Daoist temple.</p><p>This person was respectfully referred to as Wind Supreme Master, and his cultivation was actually in the middle stage of Nascent Soul.</p><p>In the territory near Moon Tip, all the large and small forces respectfully treated Wind Supreme Master, honoring him as their master.</p><p>This person was a well-deserved overlord, the number one expert nearby, and the scope of his influence was not only Wind Sun Mountain, other Nascent Soul forces also dared not disrespect Wind Supreme Master.</p><p>Fortunately, Wind Supreme Master's temperament was not perverse, and Wind Sun Mountain had a good reputation in the cultivation world, and could be considered righteous.</p><p>"I wonder if Wind Supreme Master was among the two people who scared away the Bifang."</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, looking around.</p><p>The surrounding mountains stretched endlessly, as far as the eye could see.</p><p>He had detoured too far.</p><p>This place could no longer be considered Wind Sun Mountain's sphere of influence, but rather the border area between Wind Sun Mountain and another sect, the Shadow Moon Sect, full of dangerous mountains and evil waters, which high-level cultivators looked down upon.</p><p>The cultivators who attended the trade fair were not highly cultivated, but there was no shortage of well-informed people, and these news were not secrets either.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that several months ago, all the large and small forces near Wind Sun Mountain had received orders to gather at Wind Sun Mountain.</p><p>"The largest cultivator market is at Wind Sun Mountain, if I want to inquire about the entire North Sea Three Realms, I must go to Wind Sun Mountain, before that, I must first restore my strength."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered to himself.</p><p>In fact, he was not afraid of being drawn into the disturbance.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he only feared late stage Nascent Soul grand cultivators.</p><p>If he sensed something was wrong, he could leave at any time, even Wind Supreme Master could not stop him.</p><p>As an overlord, Wind Supreme Master certainly knew many secrets, if he could take this opportunity to befriend Wind Supreme Master, it would be much easier to act in the future.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang was also curious whether Chen Yan, the Ghost Mother, and Earl Dongyang had crossed the storm and come to the North Sea Three Realms.</p><p>If they had appeared here, Wind Supreme Master should know something about it.</p><p>Having decided in his heart.</p><p>Qin Sang identified a direction, flew for a while, and came to a seemingly inconspicuous mountain range, his eyes flashed, summoned the Golden Sink Sword, and fiercely slashed at the mountain range.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The mountains shook.</p><p>Suddenly, a layer of light barrier burst out in the mountain, blocking the sword energy.</p><p>The scenery under the light barrier changed drastically, with clear springs flowing and lush greenery, like a fairyland. Some pavilions and towers were hidden among them, and figures flew out from inside, looking flustered, looking into the air.</p><p>This place was a small sect called Ten Thousand Swords Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang did not use his full strength, he stood with his sword after striking out with one sword, leisurely watching the Ten Thousand Swords Sect.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Qin Sang was respectfully invited to the main hall of the Ten Thousand Swords Sect.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, all the disciples of the Ten Thousand Swords Sect are here. We obtained permission from Yin Senior, the Sect Master of Shadow Moon Sect, to move the Ten Thousand Swords Sect to this place, I wonder where we have offended Senior, please Senior be merciful, this junior will lead the disciples away."</p><p>The sect master of the Ten Thousand Swords Sect only had Core Formation stage cultivation, and was not in the mountain at this time, a Foundation Establishment stage female cultivator received Qin Sang, her whole body trembling, and she struggled to say these words completely.</p><p>The people of the Ten Thousand Swords Sect were panicking.</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, "What do I want your sect for? This old man needs to find a place to heal his injuries, seeing that the spiritual veins here are good, I'll borrow it for a while. You all cultivate in the main hall, without my permission, you are not allowed to leave even half a step."</p><p>Saying that, Qin Sang secretly released the Celestial Eye Butterfly, and walked into the sect master's cave without looking back.</p>
