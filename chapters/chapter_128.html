<h1>Chapter 121: Jade Slip</h1><p>Chapter 121: Jade Slip</p><p>A gust of cold wind suddenly blew.</p><p>The Ten Yama Kings Banners rustled in the wind, bringing forth continuous streams of dark clouds. They densely covered the narrow passage, shrouding the cavern in darkness. Ghostly cries and wails filled the air, making the cavern seem like a ghost realm.</p><p>After obtaining Sun De’s Ten Yama Kings Banners, Qin Sang had refined them to make them his, but he had not enhanced their quality for the time being.</p><p>To improve the banners to a supreme-grade spiritual artifact would require countless souls and blood sacrifices, which would result in the deaths of many mortals. If he did that, he would be no different from a practitioner of demonic cultivation.</p><p>Nonetheless, even in their current state, the Ten Yama Kings Banners were formidable.</p><p>Once the formation was set, the six Yama Kings banners worked together in perfect harmony. Their combined power was more than just a simple multiplication, which was why Qin Sang had intentionally dragged out his conversation with Gu Tiannan, all to prepare for the Ten Yama Kings Formation.</p><p>The banners fluttered in the wind, and whirlpools appeared amidst the black aura on their surfaces. The whirlpools grew larger and larger, transforming into black holes from which even more black aura surged forth. The interior of the cave became bone-chillingly cold.</p><p>紧接着， waves of ghostly wails rang out as the Ten Yama Kings Banners’ main spirits rushed out from within them.</p><p>The six evil spirits surrounded Gu Tiannan in the center, their waists slightly bent and their bodies lowered. Their features were distorted, appearing neither human nor monster. Their consciousnesses had been assimilated by the demonic banners, leaving behind only their murderous instincts. They glared at Gu Tiannan with eyes filled with greed and bloodlust.</p><p>‘Huala!’</p><p>A gale blew, and the ghost mist condensed into blades, spears, and glaives that landed in the hands of the evil spirits. Qin Sang’s mind stirred, and the main spirits suddenly raised their weapons, rushing towards Gu Tiannan with reckless abandon.</p><p>“What demonic artifact is this!”</p><p>Gu Tiannan was filled with shock and anger. When he saw the three evil spirits charging at him, his figure moved with lightning speed. He waved his hands abruptly, his sharp claws gleaming with a cold light. He seemed to have transformed into a whirlwind of blades himself.</p><p>Confronted with this sight, the evil spirits neither dodged nor retreated, remaining fearless in the face of death.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as Gu Tiannan’s attacks struck the evil spirits, dispersing their bodies into clouds of black smoke.</p><p>At first, Gu Tiannan was taken aback, but then he laughed out loud. “So, it’s just a paper tiger…”</p><p>However, before his laughter could fully escape his lips, the clouds of black smoke twisted and reformed into the shapes of the evil spirits, who once again charged at him with renewed ferocity. At the same time, the black smoke transformed into numerous black threads that wrapped themselves around Gu Tiannan.</p><p>Gu Tiannan’s laughter abruptly stopped, and a hint of gravity appeared on his face.</p><p>‘Hong!’</p><p>The black smoke churned and surged. No matter how many times Gu Tiannan dispersed the evil spirits, they would always revive themselves.</p><p>Gu Tiannan finally realized how formidable these evil spirits were. They could immediately recover from being dispersed, and the continuous stream of black smoke from the Ten Yama Kings Formation acted as their nourishment. As long as the black smoke continued to flow, the evil spirits would seemingly never die.</p><p>Furthermore, the endless black threads continued to entwine themselves around him, emitting a bone-chilling aura of陰氣that could not be ignored.</p><p>Gu Tiannan knew that he would eventually be whittled down to death if this continued, so he roared with fury, “Break for me!”</p><p>The Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword flew out from his mustard seed pouch, its body transforming into a stream of light that stirred the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, stabbing directly towards the body of the Ten Yama Kings Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword possessed astonishing formation-breaking abilities, so he had been on guard against this. When he saw Gu Tiannan summon the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword, he immediately urged the Ebonywood Sword to charge into the formation without waiting for Gu Tiannan to complete his incantation, intercepting the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword.</p><p>The Ebonywood Sword’s sword qi was extraordinary, allowing it to fight one against five.</p><p>Several sword beams intertwined in the air like coiling dragons, producing a series of clanging sounds. The quality of the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword was clearly inferior to the Ebonywood Sword, and it was gradually suppressed, with one of its blades even being struck by the Ebonywood Sword, causing a fine crack to appear on its surface.</p><p>Seeing that the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword was unable to break him free, Gu Tiannan grew even more anxious. Qin Sang noticed keenly that the sanity in Gu Tiannan’s eyes was gradually being replaced by madness, and his body began to undergo strange changes. It seemed as if countless insects were squirming beneath his flesh, and his skin began to bulge and swell, making his appearance nauseating.</p><p>The rationality in his eyes diminished further, leaving only an endless aura of murderous intent.</p><p>When the transformation was complete, Gu Tiannan’s speed had skyrocketed and his attacks became even more ferocious. The saber-like light of his claws poured down like a waterfall, smashing the evil spirits the moment they were reborn and making it difficult for the black threads to get close to him.</p><p>Sensing the changes, Qin Sang did not dare to slack off. He activated his internal spiritual force and poured it recklessly into the Banner of the Ten Yama Kings.</p><p>This action drained Qin Sang terribly, resulting in a pale complexion. He retrieved a restorative pill from his mustard bag and swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>After being replenished by Qin Sang’s spiritual force, the six rods of the Banner of the Ten Yama Kings quivered and emitted dark light. Countless wisps of black mist surged from within and entered the evil spirits’ bodies, making their figures more solid and violent. However, they did not attack Gu Tiannan directly. Instead, they charged towards each other and eventually merged into a single entity!</p><p>This evil spirit’s figure grew to be no weaker than Gu Tiannan’s. When he saw Gu Tiannan bearing down on him, he immediately charged forward ferociously and engaged him in close combat.</p><p>The ground shook violently beneath the collision of the two ferocious beasts. Gu Tiannan’s strength actually surpassed the evil spirit’s. With a single claw, he inflicted shocking injuries upon the evil spirit. If not for the endless supply of black mist, the evil spirit would have already been scattered by Gu Tiannan.</p><p>Qin Sang had not expected Gu Tiannan’s true strength to be so terrifying. He was likely among the very best of Body Refinement cultivators at the thirteens stage of Qi Refining. Fortunately, after his transformation, he would lose his mind and was unable to use magic treasures. Otherwise, the Formation of the Ten Yama Kings might not have been able to contain him.</p><p>Qin Sang did not dare to wait any longer. He retrieved another pill and swallowed it. After his internal spiritual force was replenished, he immediately activated the Art of the Mysterious Sword.</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>The spiritual force of the Ebonywood Sword erupted and joined the evil spirit in a pincer attack against Gu Tiannan.</p><p>Although it was only a fragment of a magic treasure, Gu Tiannan’s powerful physical body could not completely resist the Ebonywood Sword. He suffered one sword wound after another and blood flowed freely, weakening his aura as the evil spirit began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>The evil spirit let out a roar and suddenly seized the opportunity to flip Gu Tiannan over. With a leap, he pressed Gu Tiannan firmly upon the ground. Qin Sang’s eyes lit up and he took the chance to activate the Ebonywood Sword with all his might.</p><p>A dazzling beam of sword light descended from heavens and impaled Gu Tiannan’s heart.</p><p>Blood gushed forth.</p><p>Gu Tiannan, who had been struggling fiercely, suddenly froze. The madness in his eyes gradually faded and his body deflated like a punctured balloon, returning to his original form.</p><p>Gu Tiannan’s eyes were wide open in death, filled with unwillingness. He was then devoured by the evil spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Banner of Yama Kings and the Ebonywood Sword. When he saw the mustard bag by Gu Tiannan’s waist, he gathered it into his hands with a wave. Extending his spiritual sense inside, he quickly found a jade slip.</p><p>After reading the contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang’s brow furrowed. After a moment of consideration, he set off towards the depths of the cave. Looks like Gu Yuan still hadn’t gotten rid of the white cat. Capturing an enemy alive would be preferable.</p>
