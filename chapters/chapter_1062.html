<h1>Chapter 1554: Heretical Nascent Soul</h1><p>Two figures stood before the stone forest.</p><p>“This is the place!  Not far past the stone forest lies the secluded valley.”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai observed for a moment, then entered the stone forest, gesturing for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>A chilling wind swept through the forest, unable to stir the petrified trees, yet it produced a grating, discordant sound as they passed—sometimes shrill, sometimes a mournful wail.</p><p>“凶兽 (fierce beasts) dwell within the stone forest, Qin Daoyou, be careful. The trees are too dense; escape techniques will be limited.”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai transmitted a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, silently alerting his Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>They slowed their pace, moving silently through the trees. Fortunately, they encountered no danger until they reached the heart of the stone forest.</p><p>Gradually, the stone forest thinned.</p><p>After traveling a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly heard a mournful wail, as if someone were weeping ahead.</p><p>Initially, the sound was faint. After spending so long in the stone forest, they had become accustomed to such sounds, assuming it was merely the wind whistling through the petrified branches.</p><p>However, the weeping didn’t fade; instead, it grew louder. In this place, it sounded exactly like ghostly cries, making their hair stand on end.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, realizing something was amiss. A chilling dread washed over them.</p><p>The cries emanated from directly ahead. The stone forest blocked the light, creating a shadowy gloom, making it impossible to see, and they dared not recklessly probe with their spiritual senses.</p><p>“Could there be a Ghost King-level specter in the inner chamber?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a knot of anxiety tighten in his chest.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai shook her head. “I’ve never heard such a rumor. Numerous Nascent Soul cultivators have fallen within the inner chamber, yet none have survived as specters. The only living creatures within the inner chamber are various ferocious beasts. At most, when certain hidden realms are opened, one might encounter guardian puppets…Let’s take another route!”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai made a decisive decision, unwilling to risk it, choosing to detour.</p><p>However, at that very moment, the ghostly cries grew louder, seemingly approaching them.</p><p>Their faces changed drastically. They immediately moved in another direction, fleeing the unseen entity.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A sudden landslide echoed ahead. The creature had discovered them and accelerated, relentlessly smashing through the petrified trees, charging towards them.</p><p>Petrified trees collapsed in a chaotic cascade.</p><p>Simultaneously, they finally sensed the creature’s aura.</p><p>“A top-tier凶兽 (fierce beast)!”</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly’s vision pierced through the dust and smoke, revealing a dark shadow—a huge, owl-like beast, its aura terrifying.</p><p>The owl-like beast fixed its fierce eyes on them, its gaze filled with bloodthirsty cruelty.</p><p>“This kind of beast should inhabit the depths of the secluded valley. Why is it here?!”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly had noticed something unusual about the owl-like beast. “Look at its wounds! This owl-like beast was probably severely injured and fled here!”</p><p>The owl-like beast appeared outwardly normal, but a small patch of feathers was broken on its chest, revealing a sword wound that pierced it clean through.</p><p>“A sword that can pierce the body of a top-tier凶兽 (fierce beast), forcing it to flee here… the person who inflicted the wound is no ordinary Nascent Soul master!”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai’s expression turned serious. “I wonder what happened in the secluded valley. Qin Daoyou, go first. I’ll lure it away. We’ll meet up after I get out of the stone forest.”</p><p>The owl-like beast relentlessly smashed through countless petrified trees, swiftly closing in on them.</p><p>The ghostly cries became even more piercing, seeming to burrow into their minds, disrupting their spirits.</p><p>The situation was critical. Ning Wuhuai quickly made her decision, prepared to lure the owl-like beast away herself, allowing Qin Sang to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly astonished. Even injured, the owl-like beast was a Nascent Soul level creature.  Fighting it would be incredibly dangerous even if they teamed up. What advantage did Ning Wuhuai possess?</p><p>They were so close to the end, and he didn't want Ning Wuhuai to perish here.</p><p>The  ‘Control Lightning Technique’ could threaten a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Additionally, to be safe, he had given the Star Conch to Bai beforehand.</p><p>Bai didn't have any decent defensive treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the Demon Banner, the Sword Wheel, and the Control Lightning Technique. Each was incredibly powerful, but also extremely draining. It would be hard to use them all against a strong opponent; lending the Star Conch to Bai was a precaution.</p><p>Bai’s cultivation was higher, so she could wield the Star Conch more effectively than Qin Sang.</p><p>The combined power of the ‘Control Lightning Technique’ and the Star Conch would be significant, his ultimate trump card for this mission.</p><p>However, the Star Conch could only be used once, and Bai was tasked with acquiring the Soul-Washing Liquid, so she hadn’t used it in the Maze Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui gestured towards the top of her head. A figure, about the size of a fist, leaped out – a miniature version of herself, with the same facial features but a lively expression.</p><p>“A Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Qin Sang froze, incredulous.</p><p>No wonder he felt such pressure from Ning Wu Hui.  He found it unbelievable.  Ning Wu Hui had actually broken through to the Nascent Soul stage within the Trial Realm!</p><p>The difficulty of Nascent Soul formation is well-known; it also involves facing the terrifying Nascent Soul Tribulation.  Even with the protection of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang had taken great care to prepare thoroughly.  Yet, Ning Wu Hui had casually formed her Nascent Soul after a simple trip through the Trial Realm, finding a helpful herb. There was no sign of the life-threatening tribulation everyone feared, let alone any lingering weakness from the process. He didn't even have time to consolidate his cultivation, yet showed no signs of exhaustion.</p><p>When did forming a Nascent Soul become so easy?</p><p>Even stranger, why did Ning Wu Hui choose the highly taboo technique of separating her Nascent Soul? Her body still clearly possessed the aura of a late-stage Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui’s Nascent Soul was cute and delicate, yet its expression was as serious as its original, radiating an impressive aura as it faced the Night Owl.</p><p>The Night Owl fixed its gaze on the Nascent Soul, its fierce eyes filled with greed.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Qin, leave quickly! This is an external Nascent Soul I created using a secret technique; it has significant limitations.  Escaping myself isn’t difficult, but I can't protect you during battle.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Ning Wu Hui.  This person actually possessed such a secret technique. Even an external Nascent Soul is still a Nascent Soul, explaining Ning Wu Hui's daring solo confrontation with the Night Owl.</p><p>Though full of questions, Qin Sang knew this was no time to investigate. A major battle could attract more beasts. He’d best obey and avoid hindering Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>“Be careful, Daoist Friend! Don't prolong the fight!”</p><p>Qin Sang promptly activated his escape technique, a flash of light propelling him towards another direction. He vanished into the depths of the stone forest in an instant.</p><p>The Night Owl was completely captivated by Ning Wu Hui and made no attempt to pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>In the final moment, Qin Sang glanced back to witness Ning Wu Hui's attack.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui’s Nascent Soul opened its tiny mouth and spat out a miniature, crimson-gold sword – the same sword that had slain the monstrous bird earlier.</p><p>The same sword, the same master, yet the aura emanating from it was utterly different.</p><p>The crimson-gold sword expanded in the wind, its brilliance illuminating the stone forest, its speed like a shooting star.</p><p>The next moment, a sharp, ear-piercing shriek echoed, laced with pain and fury.</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>The stone forest collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly shifted his position, putting distance between himself and the battlefield.</p>
