Chapter 1312: The Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation

As they spoke, the group entered the Abyssal Ruins and arrived at the Mist Sea where the Immortal Sect was located. Deep within the Mist Sea, several Nascent Soul cultivators from the Sin Abyss were stationed here. Around the vortex, the fluctuations of the mist were faint, and between the layers of mist, thin gray threads crisscrossed, appearing and disappearing intermittently. This was the Heaven Net Locking Essence Formation, personally set up by Fairy Qiuzhi.

The Heaven Net Locking Essence Formation blocked the vortex above, preventing the return of the Old Demon Ye. However, the coverage and power of the formation were limited. This time, they had gathered all the top experts from the North Star Realm to set up a grand formation, aiming to completely seal off this space. Once the formation was in place, if the Old Demon Ye dared to leave the Sin God Palace, they would surely trap him.

Before that, they also wanted to test whether they could activate the Immortal Sect like the Old Demon Ye had. Qin Sang flashed to the edge of the vortex, activating his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability to peer into the depths of the vortex. The mist was so dense that even with his divine ability pushed to its limit, all he could see was a chaotic void.

Next, Qin Sang and the others took turns attempting to activate the Immortal Sect. After many attempts and exhausting all their methods, the Immortal Sect remained unresponsive, and they had no choice but to give up.

"Let's set up the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation! Once the formation is complete, we will take turns guarding this place until the Purple Palace emerges. We must not give the Old Demon Ye any opportunity to slip through..." Daoist Zhenyi spoke up.

No one objected. The purpose of setting up the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation to seal the Immortal Sect was to trap the Old Demon Ye inside, like catching a turtle in a jar. Before the Purple Palace closed, the Old Demon Ye would be unable to pass through the Purple Palace's immortal formation to escape. Additionally, if the situation changed, they could use the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation to buy time.

Daoist Zhenyi took out various formation tools, all of which had been urgently crafted over the past month. Then, Daoist Zhenyi, King Yu, Canghong Zhenren, Tongyou Mojun, Qingjun, the Lu family cultivator, and Fairy Qiuzhi each took out a jade vial. The vials were of different colors, containing seven types of rare spiritual waters. It had taken the combined efforts of the five major powers to gather these seven spiritual waters for the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation.

Although Qin Sang was powerful, his cultivation was not yet at the level of an ordinary early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, so he could not control the spiritual waters and instead stood guard on the side. Most of the formation tools had been crafted by Qingjun, who would lead the formation.

Qingjun flew into the air above the vortex, her jade fingers flicking as various formation tools flew in all directions, seemingly chaotic, but each one disappeared into the mist.

"Junior Brother, remove the Heaven Net Locking Essence Formation."

Hearing the voice transmission, Qin Sang and the others from the Shan family quickly dismantled the formation and flew out.

'Whoosh!'

The Eighteen Demon Banners were taken out by Qin Sang, transforming into giant banners three zhang tall. Fierce demonic flames condensed into a black dragon before Qin Sang, coiling and ready for battle.

Qin Sang turned to watch Qingjun and the others at work. After the Battle of Yu City, Qingjun had left alone to handle some matters and returned a few days later, appearing normal and unharmed.

Daoist Zhenyi and the others flew to Qingjun's side. After a series of movements, the seven of them simultaneously opened their jade vials and poured out the spiritual waters. These spiritual waters had different properties. Some emitted a bone-chilling cold, surpassing even profound ice. Others were as hot as magma. Some were brimming with vitality...

Qingjun and the others quickly infused the spiritual waters with complex runes. Soon, there was a series of popping sounds as the spiritual waters exploded into mist, then completely disappeared, merging with the surrounding fog.

From the outside, everything appeared normal. Qingjun and the others flew away from the vortex, glanced back, and silently formed a hand seal.

In an instant, the Mist Sea underwent a dramatic change. The dense mist surged, and the entire vortex vanished before their eyes. Everyone could feel that the mist here was different from elsewhere. The essence of the mist was transformed from the spiritual waters, and its power was astonishing. If they were to mistakenly enter the formation without understanding the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation, even if the formation was unmanned, it would likely take them considerable effort to escape.

"The formation is complete!"

Qingjun nodded slightly and handed out tokens to control the formation.

"Lu has recently needed a quiet place to help Fellow Daoist Hanxi recover from his injuries. This place is suitable, so Lu will guard it for the next two years. I ask the Zhenren to keep an eye on this place. If the Old Demon Ye breaks out, Lu fears he may not be able to stop him."

Lu Boyuan stepped forward and spoke.

Canghong Zhenren was more than willing, nodding repeatedly, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist Lu. I will keep people stationed in the Abyssal Ruins to assist you."

After some discussion, the others agreed on a rotation schedule. Then, they all dispersed. Some stayed in the Abyssal Ruins, as the Sin Abyss had finally opened to them, and they naturally wanted to explore it thoroughly.

Qin Sang also wanted to visit the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters, thinking he might find something he had overlooked. Just as he flew out of the Mist Sea, someone called out to him.

"Fellow Daoist Qin, please wait!"

A figure flew over from a distance.

Qin Sang recognized the person and smiled, "So it's you, Fellow Daoist. Last time in the formation, we missed each other, and I was quite regretful. Now I finally get to meet you in person. Have you come to demand an explanation?"

The person was none other than the Judge.

The Judge's face showed a bitter expression, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you jest. I was blind and overconfident, and I fell into your hands on the battlefield. I am truly convinced. This time, I wanted to see your demeanor and also to make a presumptuous request."

Seeing the Judge's frankness, Qin Sang refrained from further sarcasm and took out the Death Jade, "Are you here for this?"

The Judge's eyes lit up, and he nodded repeatedly, "You see right through me, Fellow Daoist Qin. This Death Jade is extremely important to me. I need it to control the Corpse Formation. Although I could refine a new one, it would take a great deal of effort and time. Now that the two realms have reached a truce, and the Death Jade is of no use to you, I wanted to ask for its return. Of course, if you have any requests, I will do my best to fulfill them."

The Judge's words were sincere. His second main soul had been destroyed, greatly reducing his strength. He had also used up many of his treasures as compensation. Refining a new main soul had already strained him, and refining another Death Jade would likely leave him with no hope of surviving the next heavenly tribulation. Thus, he had no choice but to swallow his pride and come begging.

Qin Sang pondered silently. The Death Jade was indeed of little use to him. This person was from the Sin Abyss and was skilled in the Corpse Dao, making him potentially very useful.

"It's not difficult for you to get the Death Jade back. I am currently searching for fire-attribute spiritual materials to refine a treasure. If you can find a few of these, I will return the Death Jade to you..."

The Judge looked at the list Qin Sang handed him, his mouth twitching in bitterness. These spiritual materials were all extremely rare, and the time it would take to find them might not be much less than refining a new Death Jade.

Qin Sang observed his expression and added, "If it's too difficult for you, you can help me with a few tasks, and I can be more lenient with the conditions."

The Judge's face lit up with joy, and he quickly said, "Please, tell me!"

"I need to find a Golden Core cultivator skilled in the Corpse Dao, but this person's corpse refinement technique is different from others. He has inherited the Heavenly Corpse Sect's legacy, so it's best to start from the Heavenly Corpse Sect."

Qin Sang led the Judge toward the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters.

"The Heavenly Corpse Sect?"

The Judge's face showed surprise.

Qin Sang's heart stirred. This person clearly knew something.
