<h1>Chapter 295: Luo Xingnan</h1><p>Yu Kong heard his account and immediately understood. The two of them had failed to coordinate. Wu Chen had tried to save Yan Wu and had nearly been killed himself.</p><p>Wu Chen’s injuries were more serious than Shangguan Lifeng’s, but he just needed to swallow a medicinal pill and he would soon recover. However, time was against them, they could not wait.</p><p>Yu Kong realized they had both entered the wrong directions. The real exit was in a different direction. He had no choice but to let Wu Chen and Yan Wu stay to heal, and let Qin Sang and Yan Wu carry on exploring.</p><p>“Taoist Qingfeng...”</p><p>Yan Wu bowed to Qin Sang, looking rather awkward.</p><p>Earlier, Yu Kong had given Yan Wu a severe warning. Yan Wu no longer dared to harbor any ulterior motives, otherwise, Yu Kong would not hesitate to teach him a lesson.</p><p>Yan Wu’s tone lacked any hint of resentment. Qin Sang had to wonder, was it an illusion that he felt Yan Wu stabbing him in the back?</p><p>Qin Sang squinted at Yan Wu, hesitated, then suggested that they explore in turns, he would go first followed by Yan Wu.</p><p>He would rather face the dangers of the sea of flames on his own than carry a ticking time bomb with him.</p><p>Yan Wu had no objections and quickly agreed.</p><p>After the previous incident, the risks of exploring were greatly reduced. However, Qin Sang still did not trust Yan Wu. He remained vigilant.</p><p>Qin Sang went up to the sea of flames and was about to enter.</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly felt an abnormal fluctuation in the sea of flames. He instinctively paused.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could figure out what this ripple meant, he suddenly heard an extremely angry roar from behind him, and a groan.</p><p>He recognized both voices.</p><p>The roar came from Yu Kong, and the voice that groaned was Shangguan Lifeng!</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. He suddenly turned around.</p><p>He saw Shangguan Lifeng being struck in the chest by a palm attack from Yu Kong. There was a ghastly hollow in his chest. Shangguan Lifeng spat out blood and flew backwards.</p><p>His blood splattered into the sky and was instantly evaporated by the fierce fire.</p><p>This palm strike was a blow from a furious Yu Kong. Shangguan Lifeng failed to dodge. He took it head-on and his injuries were severe. If he had not turned his body sideways at the last moment, avoiding the vital organ, his heart, he might have died on the spot.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng could barely stand now. His face was as pale as paper, and his breathing was weak. However, there was a smug smile on his lips.</p><p>For the price of his life, Shangguan Lifeng had wrapped a long yellow rope tightly around Yu Kong’s body.</p><p>This yellow rope was evidently a top-grade magic weapon. It not only bound Yu Kong’s body but also restrained the spiritual energy in his body.</p><p>At this point, five figures suddenly appeared around Yu Kong. They surrounded Yu Kong and Wu Chen, who was completely shocked and bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen these people before.</p><p>The man facing Yu Kong turned out to be Luo Xingnan!</p><p>Beside Luo Xingnan were four other people. The old man Gong, who was working as a spy beside Sheng Yuanzi, a white-clothed scholar, a middle-aged man with an eagle-nosed nose, and Yunyouzi!</p><p>“Luo Xingnan, you are not dead!”</p><p>Yu Kong was even more shocked than Qin Sang.</p><p>Yu Kong was puzzled as to why Luo Xingnan had not been killed by the Sky-Reaching Serpent. After all, his plan was flawless. How could it have failed? But that did not matter now.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Kong realized his situation and immediately made the right decision.</p><p>Run!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The yellow rope was broken.</p><p>Yu Kong’s face was flushed. He recklessly squeezed his dantian to condense spiritual energy, and finally self-destructed the magic weapon, breaking free from the yellow rope.</p><p>Although he had forcibly freed himself, he had also injured himself.</p><p>Yu Kong did not have time to worry about this. He suppressed his injuries brutally and sped up. He charged towards the white-clothed scholar, the weakest of the five.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan and the others had planned this and would not let him escape.</p><p>The five of them formed a formation. The white-clothed scholar seemed to be a breakthrough, but in fact, it was a trap, a giant net waiting for its prey.</p><p>Before he reached the white-clothed scholar, an ancient seal appeared silently, carrying an immense force, and descended from the sky.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ancient seal slammed into Yu Kong, injuring him further. He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>"Old Dog Yu, you're not dead yet, so how can I bear to die?"</p><p>Luo Xingnan laughed out loud and pointed a finger. Two sword beams, one blue and one red, flew out from his palm. The spirit swords complemented each other, their sword qi crisscrossing as they attacked like a storm, denying Yu any chance to catch his breath and not even giving him time to beg for mercy.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan still let Yu die a well-informed ghost.</p><p>"I never thought Shao Chunhui would have such a promising disciple."</p><p>Yu's eyes went round and he understood everything.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's concubine, Crescent Moon Immortal, was just a pawn, a decoy to distract his attention.</p><p>Perhaps Luo Xingnan had even leaked Crescent Moon Immortal's identity to him on purpose.</p><p>To someone like Luo Xingnan, what did a woman matter?</p><p>The true hidden blade was Shangguan Lifeng, Shao Chunhui's disciple whom Luo Xingnan had found from somewhere!</p><p>Yu's eyes glazed over as he recalled a phrase he had never believed in.</p><p>Cause and effect...</p><p>When they saw their main target had been completely suppressed by Luo Xingnan and had no chance of turning the tables, with his death sooner or later a foregone conclusion, the other four withdrew from the battle one after another.</p><p>The White-robed Scholar landed beside Wu Chen and pressed a palm on his shoulder. Wu Chen's wounds still hadn't healed and his eyes darted around nervously, not daring to move. The other three leaped towards Qin Sang and Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Cloud Wanderer exchanged glances mid-air before separating abruptly after a brief exchange. Then they charged into the sea of flames without hesitation.</p><p>Yan Wu was a beat slower, but he also fled hastily in the end.</p><p>These people hadn't fought Wu Chen to the death, and it seemed like they only wanted to kill Yu, but he wasn't like Wu Chen and didn't dare bet his life. Even if he were to be captured alive, he would be used as a scout and wouldn't have a good end.</p><p>Although the sea of flames was extremely dangerous, there was a glimmer of hope within it.</p><p>As long as Luo Xingnan and the others still had their eyes on the spirit herbs on the mountain, they wouldn't waste time here searching for them.</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer and his two companions followed closely behind.</p><p>"Split up and chase them!"</p><p>The Cloud Wanderer shouted and summoned his spirit bamboo flying shuttle, his speed skyrocketing instantly. He disappeared into the depths of the sea of flames as he chased after the direction Qin Sang had fled.</p><p>The other two looked at each other and shook their heads helplessly. Their speed couldn't compare to the Cloud Wanderer's, so they could only chase after Yan Wu together.</p><p>...</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang entered the sea of flames, he activated the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman. The cracks on the talisman still hadn't completely healed, but it was enough to increase Qin Sang's speed to a level comparable to the mid Core Formation stage.</p><p>With the dragons swirling around him, Qin Sang easily shook off Yan Wu and flew out a certain distance before stopping.</p>
