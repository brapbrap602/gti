<h1>Chapter 1131: The Ancient Treasure</h1><p>Chapter 1131: The Ancient Treasure</p><p>Since obtaining the Star Platform,</p><p>Qin Sang, with the Star Platform's assistance, had successively cultivated the "Thunder Control Technique" and "Heavenly Demon Transformation".  Living with the Star Platform day and night, Qin Sang attempted to explore its secrets, but to no avail.</p><p>It seemed to be merely an object capable of connecting with the stars and assisting in the cultivation of the "Thunder Control Technique".</p><p>But Qin Sang felt it couldn't be that simple.</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch coveted the Star Platform, scheming and sending his disciples to steal the treasure from the Lan Dou Gate, indicating that the Star Platform might be related to some kind of hidden Wu tribe secret.</p><p>While in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang had secretly inquired several times, but found no news related to the Star Platform.  Because most of his energy was focused on cultivation and the Seven Killing Hall, he couldn't spare the time to investigate further.</p><p>At the Sky Point Peak, the Star Platform underwent unprecedented changes.</p><p>"Could it be because there wasn't enough concentrated stellar energy before?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Star Platform, pondering silently.</p><p>This was the first time he had brought the Star Platform to a place like Sky Point Peak.</p><p>During the time he focused on his breakthrough, the Star Platform absorbed an unknown amount of stellar energy. Originally an ordinary stone, it was now somewhat transparent.</p><p>Starlight passed through the Star Platform; its material was transforming into jade.</p><p>Previously, the Star Platform was pitted and scarred.</p><p>Now, these scars seemed to have transformed into mysterious runes, imbuing the Star Platform with a strange charm.</p><p>After Qin Sang dispersed his cultivation energy, the Star Platform became the core.</p><p>Stellar energy was continuously drawn towards the Star Platform; it seemed like a bottomless pit, not only showing no sign of stopping, but absorbing at an increasingly rapid pace.</p><p>Gradually, the spectacle became even grander than when Qin Sang was cultivating.</p><p>The stellar energy on Sky Point Peak was extremely concentrated. The area of open ground he had chosen was quite large, yet the stellar energy in this area was almost completely absorbed by the Star Stone.</p><p>"Will this affect the ancient prohibitions and the stability of the space?"</p><p>Qin Sang retreated to the side, somewhat worried.</p><p>If Sky Point Peak were destroyed by the Star Stone, he wouldn't only offend a few people, but all the cultivators of the Xiaohan Domain and the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>The stellar energy formed a vortex, its scale alarming; the Star Platform was at the center of the vortex.</p><p>Qin Sang could only continue retreating.</p><p>He closely observed the fairy prohibitions around the open ground and found that the light clusters intertwined with the fairy prohibitions, about to condense into stellar stones, were stable and unaffected by the anomaly.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression eased slightly.</p><p>His gaze returned to the Star Platform.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. The Star Platform absorbed an immense amount of stellar energy. This mountain slope had accumulated an unknown amount of stellar energy over countless years, almost all of which was absorbed by the Star Stone. It was hard to imagine what level of ancient treasure it was.</p><p>Finally, a buzzing sound suddenly came from within the stellar energy vortex.</p><p>In an instant, the stellar energy dissipated, revealing the gleaming Star Platform.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the next moment, the Star Platform suddenly retracted its light, returning to its previous simple, unassuming appearance.</p><p>After the disturbance caused by the Star Stone subsided,</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached, discovering that despite absorbing so much stellar energy, it showed no obvious changes. He raised his hand, taking the Star Stone into his palm, and channeled his true energy into it.</p><p>It was exactly the same as before.</p><p>It was certain that the Star Stone must have undergone some unknown change.</p><p>"Could it be that my cultivation is too low, and I cannot currently control the Star Stone? Or is it because it's a Wu tribe treasure, requiring Wu tribe bloodline?  Ya Gu is unconscious, and there are no Wu tribe descendants in Xiaohan Domain. I'm afraid I'll have to return to the Canglang Sea to find out…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, and decided to put the Star Stone away for now.</p><p>He roughly estimated that he had been here for quite some time; the Yuan Ying stage cultivators outside must be waiting impatiently.</p><p>He calmed his breath, erased his tracks, continued collecting enough stellar stones, returned to the transmission array, and sent all the treasures back to the immortal mansion on the other side.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A figure broke through the waves.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of Sky Point Peak and saw the three Yuan Ying Patriarchs waiting for him.</p><p>"I report to the three seniors, this junior has completed the cultivation of the secret technique."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Jiu Gu and the demonic cultivator Yuan Ying stared at Qin Sang for a moment, confirming that the seal they had left hadn't been tampered with. Their expressions softened slightly, and they released the seal.</p><p>Afterwards, the three used talismans to reseal Sky Point Peak.</p><p>"Sect Leader Leng, your request has been fulfilled. This junior takes his leave! The signs of the Abyss of Sin's unrest are becoming increasingly obvious. The major strongholds cannot afford any losses. I hope you two won't delay too long."</p><p>Jiu Gu headed south, returning to Cang Heng Island. The demonic cultivator Yuan Ying flew towards Tian Duan Mountain to the northeast, the lair of the demonic sect.</p><p>Qing Jun then took Qin Sang back to the Yuan Shen Gate.</p><p>After moving away from the other two, they changed direction, flew for a while, and arrived at a patch of reefs. Qing Jun took out a treasure seal. After infusing it with true energy, the seal shot a sword-like beam of green light into the sky.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the void fluctuated, and the gate of the immortal mansion appeared out of thin air, accompanied by various strange phenomena.</p><p>The immortal mansion opened with a loud boom.</p><p>Two cultivators suppressed their cultivation base and entered the immortal mansion.</p><p>The place resembled a real dwelling, its interior like a garden, though far more damaged than the previous location.  They had to maintain their cultivation at the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>Upon reaching the inner sanctum, they found the teleportation array surrounded by ancient, shimmering prohibitions, mirroring the previous site.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered what Senior Sister Qing Jun had mentioned: this immortal mansion was the source of Qing Zhu's tragedy.</p><p>Qing Zhu's senior sister, also Qing Jun's aunt, obtained a treasure seal from the mansion upon its emergence. Leng Yuntian discovered the teleportation array, and in an attempt to seize the mansion, murdered Qing Zhu’s senior sister, creating a deep-seated feud.</p><p>Ironically, the Yuan Shen Sect gained little, ultimately destroyed because of this mansion, its entire sect falling under Qing Jun's control.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved his star platform and other treasures.</p><p>Qing Jun counted the star essence stones, nodding with satisfaction. “Good, enough! How's that body refinement technique coming along? I see little change; did you fail to break through?”</p><p>“Senior sister is perceptive,”</p><p>Qin Sang said dejectedly, “I suspected the Qingluan puppet's essence wasn't sufficient for me to comprehend the Celestial Demon Dharma Image, but my physical body has indeed improved. Hopefully, it will aid my nascent soul stage advancement.”</p><p>“Contemplating a Celestial Demon for body refinement…what an odd technique…”</p><p>Qing Jun shook her head repeatedly, having never heard of such a thing.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't reveal it was a demonic cultivation technique.</p><p>As they spoke, the two left the mansion, flying towards the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>“Senior Sister, think carefully. What do you remember about the mysterious stone tablet and the Opportunity Demon King?  It seems that only the tablet holds the key to truly understanding Celestial Demons in the cultivation world.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained persistent.</p><p>The "Celestial Demon Body Refining" technique was of extraordinary origin.  Even more precious, the Jade Buddha blocked the star煞, greatly accelerating his cultivation.</p><p>His current talent allowed him to cultivate both techniques simultaneously, refining both body and spirit.</p><p>He suspected the South Bright 離 fire might contain a Vermilion Bird feather, but the Ziwei Palace's opening was uncertain, and obtaining the South Bright 離 fire was even less likely. Even if there was a Vermilion Bird feather, who knew if it was merely a fragment, or if it even retained any Vermilion Bird essence?</p><p>If the opportunity to approach the mysterious stone tablet arose, he would strive to seize it.</p>
