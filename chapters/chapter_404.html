Chapter 397: Preparing for the Rainy Day


Yu Hua's position in the Kuiyin Sect was higher than Qin Sang had imagined; he knew many secrets.  He not only knew the complete secret method of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu, but also the whereabouts of the Kuiyin Sect remnants.

The surviving Golden Core cultivator of the Kuiyin Sect, Daoist Jiupao, was Yi Tiannie's nephew and Kuiyin Ancestor's great-grandson.  With the Kuiyin Sect's dwindling numbers, Daoist Jiupao was the only surviving Golden Core cultivator among the third generation disciples.  The other two Golden Core cultivators, Yi Tiannie and his junior brother, were both old men nearing the end of their lifespans.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, after Yi Tiannie and his brother's deaths, Daoist Jiupao would succeed as the sect leader of the Kuiyin Sect, taking control of the demonic sect.  He should have had a bright future, but he was implicated by Yi Tiannie.

Now, with his physical body destroyed and his Golden Core severely injured, he could only gather the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect, eking out a living near Qingyang City, secretly sending out his minions disguised as a small sect called "Demon Flame" to search for medicinal herbs.

Qin Sang recalled the information he had learned from Yu Hua, a thoughtful expression on his face.  He wasn't thinking about how to remove the Heart-Eating Insect Gu; he was contemplating the possibility of using the insect as bait to hunt the Kuiyin Sect remnants, even the Golden Core cultivator!

Qin Sang never forgot his own talent—five spiritual roots.  For a five-spiritual-root cultivator, reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was already incredibly lucky, and Golden Core was absolutely beyond expectation. But Qin Sang wasn't satisfied. He wasn't willing to stop there!

Among False Core cultivators, only a small fraction successfully achieve Golden Core.  Those who even reach the False Core stage are already among the elite cultivators, each with far greater talent than him.  This shows just how difficult the immortal path is.

Senior Brother Qi Yuanshou, whose talent was among the best at Mount Shao Hua, was already a False Core cultivator when Qin Sang first arrived at the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, yet he remained stuck there, unable to achieve Golden Core.

Every cultivator struggles.  What about those with Heaven Spiritual Roots? While they easily transcend Foundation Establishment and Golden Core, they still get stuck at the Nascent Soul stage.

Fairy Chenyan was a Heaven Spiritual Root cultivator, a favored child of Heaven, yet she was still forced to choose a cultivation technique to break through?

Upon his return to his sect, Qin Sang hadn't heard any news of Fairy Chenyan's successful Nascent Soul breakthrough.  She was probably still in seclusion, and even if she had resorted to demonic methods, her chances of success remained slim. Accidents during seclusion were also common.

Even if she succeeded in reaching Nascent Soul, there's still the tribulation of transforming into a god. In Xiaohan Territory, while Nascent Soul cultivators were rare, they still existed. Yet, it had been a very long time since anyone achieved the Transformation stage.

Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang wouldn't take this path fraught with peril, a path no one had successfully traversed.  But preparations must be made, lest he regret it later.

The existence of the Jade Buddha meant Qin Sang didn't need to worry about the most dangerous aspect of this secret method.  This was something Wu Shang and others lacked – it was his greatest advantage!

Wu Shang's created "Condensing煞 Refining罡 Golden Core" secret method required two extremely difficult-to-obtain items.

One was Qiantian Gang Qi (Celestial Yang Qi).  This qi is nurtured high in the heavens, deep within the gale winds, inaccessible even to Nascent Soul cultivators. To obtain it, one must search for Qiantian Gang Ying (Celestial Yang Essence), which has fallen from the heavens, remained in the world, and finally evolved.

Qiantian Gang Ying is extremely rare, even harder to find than the Earthly Demonic Yin Veins.  Qin Sang currently only knew of the existence of Qingyang Gang Ying in the Qingyang Demon Sect, but as it's related to the Qingyang Demon Fire, the foundation of the sect, he obviously couldn't enter and collect it freely.


The second is a "fresh" Golden Core or Demon Core from an early Golden Core or Demon Core stage cultivator, ideally harvested within the last ten years, and the shorter the storage time, the better.

The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* requires a Golden Core or Demon Core for creating the Flying Night Rakshasa, but the requirements for the core itself are not high, as long as it's intact.  Wu Shang's "Condensing煞 Refining罡" secret method is different.

The secret method requires that at the moment the pill is absorbed and transforms into a Flying Night Rakshasa, both the Earthly Demonic Yin and Celestial Yang Qi are refined into the body simultaneously. This allows the Celestial Yang Qi to neutralize the Earthly Demonic Yin Qi as soon as it enters, preventing the corpse pill from being completely corrupted and damaging the body and spirit.

Although Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the Earthly Demonic Yin Qi harming his spirit, he didn't want his physical body to be destroyed by it, turning him into a mere corpse, a fate from which there would be no return.  Therefore, if it came to that, he must meet Wu Shang's requirements precisely. The subsequent recovery would then be much easier.


The simultaneous introduction of the Celestial Yang Qi and Earthly Demonic Yin Qi would inevitably cause a collision, creating a powerful impact on the Golden Core or Demon Core.


Stored for too long, Golden Core pills or Demon Core pills, even with protective seals, while retaining their power, become inert and unable to withstand impact.

The secret technique is intricately linked to Core Formation; even the slightest difference can have immeasurable consequences.

The result? Pill destruction and the death of the cultivator!

Golden Core and Demon Core pills have countless uses in medicine and alchemy, making them incredibly precious.

Qin Sang, confident in her strength and resources, believed that spending everything she had on a Golden Core or Demon Core pill might offer a sliver of hope. However, the technique's requirements were too stringent, forcing her to seek another path.

Upon learning of the state of the Daoist Jiupao, Qin Sang set her sights on him.

A Core Formation cultivator—Qin Sang wouldn't dare provoke one even if she had a hundred lives.

But a severely injured cultivator, whose physical body was destroyed, was a different matter.

Qin Sang had been terribly wronged by the Kuiyin Sect.  She harbored no goodwill towards anyone within the sect, not even Tan Hao and Shi Hong. Killing him and taking his pill would cause her no qualms.

Of course, any such action would have to wait until she broke through to the False Core stage and refined Yu Hua into a Flying Night Rakshasa.

Even if she didn't kill Daoist Jiupao, the Flying Night Rakshasa was a necessity.

With a Flying Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang could dominate Foundation Establishment cultivators, making any task significantly easier.

The Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Flying Night Rakshasa would give her two ways to combat Core Formation cultivators.

In the time before her breakthrough to False Core, if she could find a few more options, success wasn't impossible!

She only hoped Daoist Jiupao's injuries wouldn't heal too quickly.

For some reason, Daoist Jiupao didn't dare show himself, instead sending his minions to search for medicine.

From Yu Hua's account, these individuals were complex and included Yi Tiannie and another Golden Core cultivator's disciple.

Each was cunning and arrogant, only temporarily serving under Daoist Jiupao due to the disparity in cultivation and the pressure from the Yuanzhao Sect's pursuit.

Insincere obedience was commonplace.

Whether they would faithfully carry out Daoist Jiupao's orders was highly questionable.

Qin Sang could perhaps do something herself…

Her eyes glinted.

Eliminating Daoist Jiupao's inner circle might delay his recovery.  With this in mind, Qin Sang questioned Yu Hua thoroughly about the identities of the Kuiyin Sect remnants.

This was only a rough plan; the specific actions required careful planning. She absolutely couldn't let the Kuiyin Sect remnants or Daoist Jiupao discover her existence.
