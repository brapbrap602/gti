<h1>Chapter 814: The Steward</h1><p>Qu Heng Island.</p><p>After Qin Sang entered the city, he disguised his identity and inquired about secrets. It didn't take long to pinpoint a person of interest.</p><p>Even on a large island like Qu Heng Island, cultivators at the late Nascent Soul stage are few and far between. Unless they completely avoid the world, it's impossible for news of them not to spread.</p><p>This person, Luo Daotong, wasn't cultivating on Qu Heng Island but was the island master of an island named Liangqiu Island, matching the description of the island master Luo given by the leader of the Hanhai Sect.</p><p>Strangely, Qin Sang couldn't find any information about his background; he seemed to be just a casual cultivator.</p><p>This person was clearly not a casual cultivator; he simply hadn't revealed his lineage.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also learned that Qu Heng Island didn't have just one island master, but two—one from the righteous path and one from the demonic path. Both were powerful Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Both the righteous and demonic paths recognized Qu Heng Island as the main island of the Liefeng Archipelago, using it as a base to govern the archipelago. This arrangement created a balance between the two island masters, preventing major unrest or conflict.</p><p>After all, the Liefeng Archipelago was far from stable or ready for the division of spoils, especially the southernmost region, which remained chaotic. Neither the righteous nor demonic paths could extend their influence there.</p><p>With such threats looming, the two island masters had to cooperate.</p><p>Otherwise, not only would they gain nothing, but they might also cause recently pacified areas to erupt into chaos again, rendering all their efforts useless.  The alliance leader wouldn't let them off lightly either.</p><p>Qin Sang, despite considerable effort, couldn't determine which island master Luo Daotong was affiliated with.</p><p>He wasn't a newbie in the cultivation world anymore. He understood that the lines between righteous and demonic paths were blurry, both equally ambitious; whoever wins is deemed righteous. It's best to treat them as two separate forces and not assume that the ambush and killing of Elder Qingzhu was solely the work of the demonic path.</p><p>He certainly dared not cause trouble for the island masters of Qu Heng Island.</p><p>To uncover the truth, he still had to start with Luo Daotong.</p><p>Luo Daotong's cave abode was on Liangqiu Island, openly visible.</p><p>A direct confrontation wouldn't work.</p><p>Qin Sang believed that with his Star Conch, Blood-Soiled Divine Light, and Double-Headed… (the original text contained a character that doesn't translate well and is likely a unique weapon or technique), a surprise attack would likely succeed in capturing the man.</p><p>But taking action within the opponent's territory was too risky.</p><p>Furthermore, the opponent's background was mysterious, and he undoubtedly possessed many treasures. If Qin Sang failed or got bogged down, giving the opponent a chance to call for help, things would become troublesome.</p><p>The distance between Liangqiu Island and Qu Heng Island wasn't great; a Yuan Ying master could arrive quickly.  In that case, Qin Sang wouldn't only fail to capture the man but might also lose his own life.</p><p>It was best to choose a moment when he left the island.</p><p>Even if the first attack failed, a quick escape would be possible.</p><p>Such an opportunity wasn't easy to come by.  Qin Sang sat in a tavern, pondering for a long time.  He decided to find a cave abode to settle in and proceed slowly.</p><p>Leaving the tavern, Qin Sang used his movement technique and flew towards the mountain.</p><p>The best cave abodes on Qu Heng Island were located on the mountaintop.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at the place where cave abodes were rented. Midway up the mountain, several luxurious pavilions stood, their exteriors shimmering with protective formations; cultivators were constantly entering and exiting, with streaks of light rising and falling.</p><p>This served as a boundary; ordinary people weren't allowed beyond this point; beyond here lay numerous cultivators' cave abodes.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the area, observing the nameplates on the pavilions, before finally selecting one and entering.</p><p>Inside the large hall, over a dozen sand tables sat, each containing identical miniature peaks – the exact shape of Qu Heng Island's main peak.</p><p>The peaks were covered in densely packed light points of various colors. Qin Sang understood immediately that these points represented the various cave abodes.</p><p>Several cultivators were gathered around some of the sand tables.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you here to rent a cave abode?”</p><p>A young cultivator approached. Qin Sang looked closely and was surprised to find that the person was merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>“Yes,” Qin Sang replied calmly, nodding.  “I'm newly arrived and want to find a place to stay. I wonder what the significance of these light points is? How can I rent a suitable cave abode?”</p><p>The young cultivator sized Qin Sang up. “Forgive my boldness, Fellow Daoist, but where did you cultivate before? Do you have a jade token?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  “What?  Renting a cave abode requires a jade token? I'm not a cultivator from near Qu Heng Island; I came from the south.”</p><p>The matter was serious; he didn't want to reveal his identity, activating the *Dunling Jue* to conceal his cultivation. To outsiders, he appeared to be only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment; only those stronger than him could see through the disguise.</p><p>The jade token was a unique identification token of Qu Heng Island.</p><p>The young cultivator looked relieved. “Fellow Daoist, you misunderstood. I had no such intention. Since you came from the south, you must admire King Hua. With your cultivation, to brave the dangers and travel across the sea, it's truly remarkable.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened slightly. He sighed, “That's right, I simply want to find a place to live, to cultivate peacefully; even risking my life is worth it.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist speaks the truth. We little people only desire stability.”</p><p>A young cultivator, deeply understanding Qin Sang's predicament, pulled her outside the pavilion and whispered, "Forgive my frankness, fellow cultivator, but I've had a similar experience.  Being new here, you might not know. Renting a cave dwelling on the main island is incredibly expensive and offers little income. I learned this the hard way – I quickly depleted my savings and almost ended up homeless. If you plan to stay, let me offer some advice: don't just focus on the main island. I can point you in a better direction."</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood and had a good idea what was coming.</p><p>The young cultivator, affecting an air of mystery, seeing Qin Sang's silence, continued, "With your cultivation level, you could easily become a steward on a nearby smaller island.  You'd have a cave dwelling and earn spirit stones. What's not to like? The only cost is your time, and assisting in defense against storms and sea beast attacks, protecting the islanders. The spiritual energy on those islands is thinner, but sufficient for cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  Her plan to infiltrate Luo Daotong couldn't be accomplished overnight.  Securing a legitimate position near Liangqiu Island was a sound strategy.</p><p>"How can I become a steward? I'd be most grateful for your guidance."</p><p>"You could apply on the larger islands, but that means waiting for openings and competing with others – a lot of uncertainty."</p><p>The young cultivator lowered his voice, "I happen to know a senior cultivator with some influence.  He can help you secure a position on any but the most important islands.  Of course, he won't do this for free…"</p><p>He rubbed his fingers together suggestively.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly; a small sum of spirit stones was nothing to him, as long as the matter was settled.  He wasn't worried about being cheated, so he produced a small pouch of spirit stones and handed it to the young cultivator, who immediately beamed.</p>
