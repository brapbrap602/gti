<h1>Chapter 643: Terror of the Insects</h1><p>Chapter 643: Terror of the Insects</p><p>Having done this, Qin Sang concealed himself in the shadows and left the stone platform.  He sensed the positions of the several Bloodwing Devil Bee larvae and manipulated them to scout outwards, allowing the aura of Crimson Fire Gilded to spread further.</p><p>Silently and invisibly, the aura of Crimson Fire Gilded dispersed throughout the cavern.  Qin Sang and the Flying Night Rakshasa lay in wait, patiently anticipating the appearance of the nocturnal stink bug.</p><p>The cavern fell silent.</p><p>A long time passed without any movement.</p><p>Qin Sang remained patient, still as a tree, unmoving. He held the Ten Directions Yama Banner, prepared to use the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to aid in capturing the nocturnal stink bug.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had continued his cultivation without interruption, comprehending the Ten Directions Yama Formation and sword light differentiation with considerable success. He could now barely use them in battle.</p><p>The dark river flowed gently.</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for almost an hour, yet there was still no movement, causing him to grow increasingly suspicious.  In this amount of time, the aura of Crimson Fire Gilded had spread far and wide.</p><p>The perception of such a strange thing should be very acute for spiritual insects, unless they were sleeping or hibernating.</p><p>The temptation of transformation was something no spiritual insect could resist.</p><p>Could it be that the nocturnal stink bug had truly migrated?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, his gaze suddenly sharpened. In his perception, contact with one of the Devil Bee larvae was severed.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned his head, his gaze like lightning, fixing on a rock crevice across the riverbank.</p><p>Deep within the crevice was a patch of darkness, filled with Yin energy.</p><p>The Bloodwing Devil Bee larva had vanished without a sound; he hadn’t sensed anything at all?</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>In an instant, all three Bloodwing Devil Bee larvae along that line disappeared.</p><p>Something moved silently and incredibly fast through the darkness, approaching him and devouring all the Bloodwing Devil Bee larvae coated in Crimson Fire Gilded.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>To allow the Crimson Fire Gilded aura to spread as far as possible, he had deliberately controlled the distance between each Bloodwing Devil Bee larva.</p><p>The terrain deep within the cavern was complex and winding.</p><p>Even if he used his Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability to fly on his sword, it would be absolutely impossible to cross the distance between the three larvae so quickly in this place and kill them instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed after using Sword Qi Thunder Sound could rival that of a mid-stage Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>A two-stage nocturnal stink bug would definitely not possess such terrifying abilities to easily evade his senses.</p><p>This was a three-stage nocturnal stink bug!</p><p>Had the person who discovered the nocturnal stink bug made a mistake, or had the nocturnal stink bug undergone a transformation in recent years?</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed Qin Sang’s mind, he abruptly turned towards the stone platform.</p><p>In an instant, he seemed to catch a glimpse of a dark shadow, fleeting and gone. When he looked at the stone platform, nothing was there.</p><p>And the Bloodwing Devil Bee larva used as bait had vanished!</p><p>Qin Sang almost instinctively wanted to activate the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and pounce on the stone platform to capture the nocturnal stink bug. But at that moment, an extremely dangerous feeling suddenly arose, causing a great alarm in Qin Sang’s heart.</p><p>This feeling came from the Flying Night Rakshasa lurking at the bottom of the river!</p><p>He and the Flying Night Rakshasa were connected in mind, able to keenly perceive its changes; this dangerous feeling was exceptionally clear.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, and without hesitation abandoned the idea of capturing the nocturnal stink bug.  He pushed off the ground, his figure flashing towards the cavern exit above.</p><p>The ebony sword flew from his brow, its light circling his body, the sound of thunder vibrating the cavern.</p><p>Simultaneously, the dark river water splashed as the Flying Night Rakshasa soared into the air.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Without looking at the stone platform, the Flying Night Rakshasa also fled towards the cavern exit at top speed.</p><p>Speed was the Flying Night Rakshasa’s forte, but facing the nocturnal stink bug in the darkness, it seemed to have no advantage.</p><p>An unusually sharp aura locked onto it from the darkness, easily pursuing it. Before the water droplets in the cavern had even fallen, a dark shadow appeared, shattering countless droplets, instantly closing in on the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back in alarm, just catching sight of this scene.  Startled, he hurriedly commanded the Flying Night Rakshasa to dodge.</p><p>At the same time, he hastily opened his corpse puppet bag and threw out several corpses to buy the Flying Night Rakshasa time.</p><p>However, these corpses were instantly cut to pieces the moment they reached the Flying Night Rakshasa, proving completely ineffective.  At this time, one could vaguely see that what had sliced them was a long, slender, black sword shaped like a shuttle, forged from Yin energy.</p><p>The nocturnal stink bug’s true form was hidden within the black sword.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Two cross-shaped sword slashes blossomed across Flying Night Rakshasa’s chest, leaving two identical wounds, deep to the bone!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa’s body was incredibly strong, honed by earth-sha spirit energy, surpassing even pre-Golden Core body-cultivation experts.  After reaching the Golden Core stage, spells become far more powerful than foundational spells, and are called Dao techniques. Qin Sang had tested it – the Flying Night Rakshasa could withstand his Dao techniques with its physical strength.</p><p>Even against low-grade magical treasures, the Flying Night Rakshasa could use its corpse energy to withstand the attack.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had concentrated all the corpse energy on its chest, yet the creature, the Ming Chun, easily broke through the defenses, leaving those horrifying wounds.  If Qin Sang hadn’t reacted swiftly, the Flying Night Rakshasa would have been cut in two.</p><p>Legend says higher-order Ming Chun have the ability to break through spells, and this one apparently did.  It was definitely not newly molted.</p><p>Qin Sang felt immense relief that he hadn’t used the Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to trap it.  If things had gone wrong, he would have fled immediately.  The Ming Chun was too agile and capable of breaking spells; there was almost no chance of containing it, and Qin Sang wasn’t going to risk his life for a single insect.</p><p>Qin Sang was temporarily safe, but the Flying Night Rakshasa was in critical condition.  If pursued further, it would be ruined!</p><p>He couldn’t let the Flying Night Rakshasa be destroyed here. This corpse, having received a fortuitous encounter, was comparable to a real Flying Night Rakshasa, a powerful asset.  Even if he refined another one later, it wouldn't be possible to replicate it.</p><p>“Hurry! Hurry!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded.  He used his full spiritual sense to probe the depths of the cave, finally sensing two Blood-winged Ghost Bee larvae.</p><p>He split off tiny strands of his spiritual sense, concealing them within the larvae. But because they were sent out so far, he could only vaguely sense their location, not control them at will.  The moment he realized something was amiss, Qin Sang immediately focused on sensing the spiritual sense within those larvae.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Deep within the cave, the two larvae exploded successively, their fiery gold aura extinguishing.  At that moment, Qin Sang felt a silent change around the Flying Night Rakshasa.  Though he couldn’t see it, he was certain the Ming Chun was gone.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath.  He didn’t dare stay in the cave, quickly retrieved the Flying Night Rakshasa, and flew away on his sword, only stopping after leaving the wasteland behind.</p>
