<h1>Chapter 909: The Rotwing Hawks</h1><p>Chapter 909: The Rotwing Hawks</p><p>Passing Qu Heng Island, Qin Sang flew straight towards the more chaotic southern region of the Riftwind Archipelago, bypassing the island.</p><p>The impact of the capture of Elder Yin's Nascent Soul several years ago seemed to have subsided, as Qin Sang arrived smoothly near the former dojo of Elder Qingzhu, on Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that Elder Yin's incident might be connected to Elder Qingzhu.  If the Demon Lord were investigating, he would certainly have people watching the cultivators on the surrounding islands.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang bypassed Ba Men Island and continued south.</p><p>Along the way, he frequently used aliases, inquiring about the situation in the Riftwind Archipelago. He discovered that while chaotic, the archipelago had its own set of rules, with large and small factions, including some with Nascent Soul-level cultivators.</p><p>He didn't want to get involved in any more disputes.</p><p>However, unless he sought refuge with those factions, finding a safe cave for quiet cultivation wasn't easy.</p><p>Months later.</p><p>In a rather desolate area of the Riftwind Archipelago, a figure flitted across several barren islands. After several hours of flight, it stopped before a small island.</p><p>The island was only a dozen or so miles in diameter, with several low hills.</p><p>Colorful smoke filled the island, rising from its center and swirling among the vegetation on the hills.</p><p>Any cultivator would instantly recognize the smoke as a poisonous miasma.</p><p>However, the greatest danger wasn't the miasma, but the nests on the hills.</p><p>"This is the Poison Island those people mentioned?"</p><p>The person who arrived was Qin Sang.</p><p>He had come to the edge of the chaotic region of the Riftwind Archipelago, using a false name, gathering information, and searching for a cave.  He’d found a few, but none were satisfactory.</p><p>A few days ago, he’d arrived in the nearby waters and learned from other cultivators about this Poison Island, occupied by a flock of Rotwing Hawks as their lair.  Intrigued, he immediately came to investigate.</p><p>Rotwing Hawks were notoriously venomous beasts. They could not only spray poisonous clouds from their mouths, but their feathers and talons were also highly toxic.  If wounded by one, the poison would quickly spread throughout the body.</p><p>Perhaps due to their constant exposure to potent poisons, the Rotwing Hawks themselves were also corroded, making them gruesome to behold.</p><p>Their bodies were black, their feathers like burnt charcoal, emitting a foul odor. Their flesh and feathers were tattered, some areas even revealing bone, like decaying corpses. Their wings were particularly terrifying, hence their name.</p><p>Ordinary people were extremely afraid of these venomous beasts, considering them embodiments of death.</p><p>Even cultivators found them troublesome. They usually appeared in large numbers, so no one dared to provoke them.  Therefore, no cultivator dared to inhabit Poison Island; the Rotwing Hawks were its sole masters.</p><p>As the Rotwing Hawks multiplied, their numbers grew, further deterring any cultivator from approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his presence, observing the island from a distance.</p><p>The miasma filled the hills, occasionally emitting strange fluctuations, accompanied by eerie hawk cries.</p><p>From the hilltops, shadowy figures would periodically emerge, entering the miasma to exhale poisonous gas.</p><p>The island's rich spiritual energy was palpable; it certainly held a spirit vein.</p><p>The miasma wasn't a major problem; some restrictions and spirit arrays could effectively isolate it, allowing for the creation of a cave.  The miasma could even serve as camouflage and a barrier against unwanted intruders.</p><p>Qin Sang was looking for peace and quiet, and the more he saw of this island, the more satisfied he became.</p><p>"As long as the island's spirit vein is sufficient for my cultivation, I'll stay here," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The surrounding environment was also good. Because of its scarce resources, high-level cultivators rarely visited, which suited him perfectly. The only problem was the island's original inhabitants – the Rotwing Hawks, who had occupied it for many years and likely had a Core Formation hawk king.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, a rustling sound came from the insect basket at his waist.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm was hungry again.</p><p>Two days ago, Fatty Silkworm had awakened, demanding purple crystals, but Qin Sang had refused.  To deal with the Rotwing Hawks, he needed the silkworm's help in creating a poison-repelling armor.</p><p>Otherwise, facing the intense poison of a Core Formation Rotwing Hawk, Qin Sang would be hesitant.</p><p>The creature was difficult to wake once it fell asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang withheld their rations for two days, causing Fei Can to become very unhappy.  Fei Can incessantly grumbled and tossed about in their container.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Fei Can was cursing them, and would have retaliated if Fei Can weren't so weak.</p><p>"Help me deal with these Corrupted Winged Hawks, and I'll give you a purple crystal."</p><p>Qin Sang picked up Fei Can and removed them from their container.</p><p>Fei Can wiggled, hissed twice to vent their frustration, then spat out a seven-colored aura.  The aura enveloped Qin Sang and Shuangtou, protecting them both.  Fei Can then perched on Qin Sang's shoulders to watch the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by Shuangtou, dashed into the island.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang took out the Shifang Yanluo Banner and then summoned their ebony sword.</p><p>The island indeed held a large number of Corrupted Winged Hawks.  Upon entering, Qin Sang immediately encountered a flock that shrieked upon seeing the intruder and unleashed a torrent of poisonous clouds.</p><p>These were merely ordinary demonic-stage hawks, but the combined poison cloud from the flock far exceeded the sum of their individual powers.</p><p>However, thanks to Fei Can's poison-resistant armor, the cloud posed no threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>The attack alerted the other hawks.</p><p>The Poison Island erupted into chaos; the incessant cries were jarring and irritating. The poisonous miasma around Qin Sang was instantly scattered by the mass of hawks, leaving a dark, foul-smelling cloud before them.</p><p>Ignoring the poison clouds, Qin Sang unleashed their ebony sword, slaughtering the hawks.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly joined in, occasionally flapping its wings to unleash thunderbolts, clearing swaths of hawks at a time, then showing off for Fei Can.</p><p>Fei Can, watching Tianmu Butterfly's prowess, rolled their eyes enviously. Fei Can secretly wished to remove the poison-resistant armor, to see how long Tianmu Butterfly would remain so confident, but feared Qin Sang’s wrath, feeling very wronged.</p><p>Of course, Tianmu Butterfly's greatest contribution was scouting for Qin Sang.</p><p>As flock after flock of Corrupted Winged Hawks fell, they finally began to fear their attackers.  At that moment, an angry cry echoed from the center of the island, accompanied by a powerful energy surge.</p><p>"The Hawk King is here… there are two of them…"</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly reported the Hawk King's approach. Qin Sang's face darkened, and with a sweep of their arm, a jet of Nine Netherworld flames shot out, tearing a hole through the hawk flock and striking a massive dark silhouette.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>A shriek pierced the air as one Hawk King had its wing pierced, tumbling backward. Before it could recover, Qin Sang and Shuangtou attacked.</p><p>Shuangtou unleashed wind blades, more powerful than before, working in tandem with the Nine Netherworld flames to overwhelm the Hawk King.</p><p>The Hawk King unleashed a cloud of multicolored poison, only to find their opponent completely unaffected.  The Hawk King offered no meaningful resistance before being slain.</p>
