Chapter 1877: Late-Stage Nascent Soul


“Many thanks, Realman Yuan.”
Qin Sang had just learned that the old Daoist's true name was Yuan Yanchu.
The contents of these jade slips were all inheritances of the Profound Profundity Temple, the most important of which was the *Profound Profundity Manual*.

Qin Sang immersed his divine sense into the *Profound Profundity Manual*, focusing his mind, while Realman Yuan's voice occasionally reached his ears.
Realman Yuan was 'elucidating the Dao' for him.
The *Profound Profundity Manual* was not written in ordinary text but composed of extremely complex talisman diagrams.
The runes within these diagrams encompassed all things; cultivators with even slightly lesser talisman mastery might not even recognize all the runes.
For the sake of his cultivation method, Qin Sang had vigorously supplemented his knowledge of talismanry, but there were still many ambiguities.  Only after Realman Yuan's guidance did he understand.

After reading the entire *Profound Profundity Manual*, Qin Sang understood why Realman Yuan had chosen this inheritance for him.
The Daoist sect emphasized talismans, and their refining path was also inextricably linked to talismanry, perhaps even evolving from it.
Qin Sang had observed Master Gu refining; her most crucial step was applying talismans.  Before opening the furnace, she would refine various spirit talismans in advance, the preparation taking longer than the actual refining.
The various talismans were dazzling, and the timing and combinations of their application were meticulously studied.
The *Profound Profundity Manual* was different. It focused more on the spirit materials themselves, seeking extraordinary power through the accumulation of high-rank spirit materials and harmonizing their properties.  In Qin Sang’s view, it was rather crude.

Of course, the *Profound Profundity Manual* also had corresponding talismans, but it wasn't as intricate as the orthodox Daoist refining techniques.  It wouldn't be too difficult for Qin Sang to learn.
This inheritance had one requirement: the refiner must be able to precisely grasp the characteristics of the spirit materials; otherwise, it would merely be ineffective piling, and might even cause conflicts. Qin Sang had some talent in this area, and Master Gu had praised his keen spiritual sense.

Qin Sang's greatest concern was the spirit nurturing technique for refining spiritual treasures.  The *Profound Profundity Manual* contained one, surprisingly a blood sacrifice technique.
Blood sacrifice refining seemed like a sinister art, but it was actually a type of orthodox refining technique.
However, the *Profound Profundity Manual* appeared more unrestrained.
By ‘feeding’ the nascent spirit through blood sacrifice, one would greatly deplete their own vital essence.
Qin Sang suspected that Profound Profundity Temple disciples must have cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Cauldron, otherwise they would likely become withered after a few uses.

Compared to Master Gu, the Profound Profundity Temple left Qin Sang with the impression of a group of brawny men, Daoist robes tied around their waists, bare-chested, muscles rippling, constantly swinging hammers and forging metal.
Qin Sang had to admit, Realman Yuan had a keen eye. This inheritance was indeed very suitable for him.
This was it!

Qin Sang put away the jade slips and thanked him again. “Are there any living inheritors of the Profound Profundity Temple?”
Realman Yuan stroked his beard.  “The Profound Profundity Temple’s lineage is broken.  From now on, you are the sole inheritor. But don't be constrained by this. If you wish, you can take on a few disciples to carry on the tradition. Consider it your destiny with the Profound Profundity Temple.”
As he spoke, Realman Yuan's tone remained calm.

Since the decline of the Daoist sect, even the Dao Court had fallen to this state, let alone the countless Daoist sects whose lineages had been severed. Many of their scriptures were lost, leaving only a cold record in the history books.
Qin Sang suddenly felt the jade slips in his hand grow heavy.

"Master Gu mentioned that she held this war drum for many years and later recorded her insights on comprehending it, entrusting everything to you. Over these years, have you gained any understanding, and when do you plan to begin refining?" Realman Yuan asked.
Qin Sang understood the implication and replied without hesitation, "This junior's cultivation is shallow. Seeing the *Profound Profundity Manual* has made me realize my shortcomings. I wish to refine it after I make further progress. I cannot be distracted during this time, and it’s inconvenient to carry the war drum with me. Please, Realman Yuan, safeguard it for me."
Seeing Qin Sang's tact, Realman Yuan smiled and nodded slightly. "Rest assured, Realman Xun has given his word. When the time comes to restore the war drum, he will certainly wait for you to personally undertake the task. For now, the situation will continue to drag on. This old Daoist also needs time to comprehend it further. There’s no need to rush…"

After a moment of thought, Realman Yuan added, "This old Daoist needs to reinforce the grand formation and regulate the earth vein’s flames every seven years. You can come then.  Now, I will explain the essence of the *Profound Profundity Manual* to you!"
Qin Sang immediately straightened his robes and sat upright before Realman Yuan.


A short while later, Qin Sang left the Healing Platform alone. He stayed at Master Gu's residence for several days before embarking on his return journey.
Sword Heart Island.
Returning to his cave dwelling, Qin Sang couldn’t wait to enter meditative seclusion, recreating True Man Sword-Bearing's sword light in his mind.

What a dazzling and profound sword strike!
Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel. He felt that by observing this sword strike, his own sword path had been touched, faintly sensing a breakthrough.
However, he couldn't completely immerse himself in the sword path, and soon resumed his usual cultivation.

In the following period, Qin Sang focused his energy on cultivating the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, but he didn't remain in seclusion the entire time.
He occasionally went out, partly to use Master Qi’s fire chamber to comprehend the *Profound Profundity Manual*, and partly to exchange the pills obtained from King Spirit Nether for what he needed for his own cultivation.
Among these pills, Qin Sang kept those he could use, mostly body-tempering spirit pills.
The rest were only useful to demon cultivators. Although Qin Sang had demon marquis under him, he naturally prioritized improving himself.

Within the Daoist sect, Realmen who cultivated the Soldier and Horse Cauldron were either Dao Court immortals or core disciples of sects, all with considerable wealth, and there was no shortage of buyers for the pills.
…
Unknowingly, another twenty-five years passed on Sword Heart Island.

On this day, Qin Sang instructed Sword Slave not to disturb him and sealed the restrictions of his cave dwelling.
More than ten days passed.
Sword Slave sat cross-legged on a rock at the summit. He sensed the unusual nature of Qin Sang's instructions and remained guarding outside.

Suddenly, the meditating Sword Slave opened his eyes, his gaze sharp as he looked towards Qin Sang's cave dwelling.
A faint pressure emanated from the cave, and the surrounding heaven and earth spiritual qi exhibited unusual phenomena, gradually spreading to the entire Sword Heart Island, and even the waters beyond.
“Could it be…”
Sword Slave realized something, his face showing astonishment, both joyful and envious. He immediately flew into the air.

True Man Sword-Bearing was not on the island. Only he and the two demon marquis were guarding Qin Sang.
The situation was unstable, and Sword Slave dared not be careless. A brilliant light flashed in his palm as he summoned a token, activating the island-protecting grand formation.
‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’
Sword Heart Island trembled slightly, and beams of light shot out from all four sides of the island.

The four beams of light were not particularly large, only a hundred zhang high. Then, supported by the beams, a semi-circular light shield appeared, enveloping the entire island.
Lightning crackled on the surface of the light shield, poised to strike, giving off an incredibly dangerous aura.
Activating the grand formation, Sword Slave’s expression eased slightly.


The grand formation couldn't conceal the unusual phenomena. The heaven and earth spiritual qi above Sword Heart Island was turbulent and restless, already showing signs of a storm, and the sky became chaotic.
Dark clouds formed out of thin air, condensing in the sky.

The phenomena intensified, and Sword Slave anxiously scanned the surroundings of the island.
Now, the inner lake was densely populated, and high-level cultivators might pass by at any moment, attracted by the unusual phenomena.
The celestial phenomena changed rapidly.
A hundred-mile radius around Sword Heart Island became dark, and strong winds arose.  As expected, cultivators were alerted, and Sword Slave sensed approaching auras, nervously gripping the token in his hand.
‘Rumble…'
Dark clouds churned, and the heavens roared.


Sword Slave’s face showed shock. He knew this wasn’t a heavenly tribulation, merely the celestial phenomena caused by a breakthrough, yet it seemed to carry heavenly might.
‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’
Above Qin Sang’s cave dwelling, the heaven and earth spiritual qi formed a visible spiritual tide, surging and turbulent.

At this time, two streaks of escaping light approached, and a voice inquired, “Fellow Daoist Sword Slave, has your island encountered some danger?”
“Fellow Daoists, halt!”
Sword Slave shouted.  The token in his hand flickered, and a light sword appeared on one of the light beams, pointing towards the newcomers as a warning.
The newcomers stopped their escaping light and exchanged glances. They had some guesses based on the celestial phenomena, and now, seeing Sword Slave’s reaction, their suspicions were confirmed.


“True Man Sword-Bearing broke through to mid-stage Profound Void less than a hundred years ago, right? Unexpectedly, another breakthrough.  Could he achieve Grand Realman status one day? It’s a pity that True Man Sword-Bearing is reclusive and dislikes associating with others. We’ve visited several times but haven't had the chance to meet him. Otherwise, it would be good to form a positive connection."
“The one breaking through might not be him…”

Above Sword Heart Island, a clap of thunder exploded, interrupting their conversation.
The spiritual qi storm seemed to have found an outlet, madly surging towards Sword Heart Island.
The two trembled slightly, their faces filled with shock, murmuring, “He succeeded?”
Before they finished speaking, an overwhelmingly powerful aura erupted from Sword Heart Island, but it instantly retracted.
The dark clouds dissipated.
The heavens gradually returned to normal.

“This…did he fail or succeed?”
The two were bewildered but didn’t dare to ask, fearing they would be reprimanded.


Inside the cave dwelling.
Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, sensing the surging true essence within his body, and a smile appeared on his face.
Finally, he had stepped into late-stage Nascent Soul!
He wasn't particularly surprised because it was within his expectations.

Qin Sang had been extremely confident in this breakthrough, so he hadn't specifically chosen a location, directly attempting it on Sword Heart Island.
The insights into the Killing Dao gained from his fierce battle with Marquis Dingxiang and slaying King Spirit Nether, the pills exchanged for King Spirit Nether’s possessions, along with the *Poison God Canon* and the poisonous fruit nectar, all these favorable conditions allowed him to achieve such astonishing results in a short time.
If he hadn’t devoted a significant amount of energy to comprehending the *Profound Profundity Manual*, he would have been even faster!

Qin Sang glanced sideways, seeing the jade bottle floating beside him, and picked it up, shaking it.
The jade bottle contained the poisonous fruit nectar, now only a thin layer remained. If Hua Ling still couldn’t produce flower dew, he would soon run out of medicine.
‘Swish!’
Lightning illuminated the cave dwelling as the Lightning Platform appeared!

Qin Sang gazed at the Lightning Platform, sensing the Azure Phoenix True Lightning within.  The Thunder Turtle demon core’s power had been exhausted, and he would need to use Azure Phoenix True Lightning to forge the platform from now on.
After these few times, Qin Sang had become more proficient; it wouldn't become an obstacle on his cultivation path.
The Azure Phoenix True Lightning within the phoenix wings was more than enough to support him to the peak of late-stage Nascent Soul.  As for how long it would last after Void Refinement, he couldn't speculate.

Sensing the Guardian Deity residing within the Lightning Platform, Qin Sang couldn't help but frown.
He had always had a lingering worry.  His Guardian Deity was a True Self conjured through contemplation, not a Thunder God.
He could still explain it with unwavering willpower for now, but when he began to strive for Void Refinement, if he still couldn’t name which deity it was, and couldn’t find a suitable excuse, it would certainly arouse suspicion.

“I can only hope that there will be a turning point in the Illusionary Windstorm, or that the Jade Buddha will continue to protect me…”
Qin Sang couldn’t think of any solution for the moment, so he could only take one step at a time.  He didn't want to change his cultivation method unless absolutely necessary.
Although he hadn’t integrated enough Azure Phoenix True Lightning yet, Qin Sang already felt the changes it brought.  In the future, it might bring him a great surprise!

What kind of power would it possess if he used the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal, condensed from Azure Phoenix True Lightning, to cast lightning techniques?
Qin Sang put away the Lightning Platform and then circulated the *Celestial Demon Body Refining Art*, summoning his Azure Phoenix Manifestation.
He hadn’t cultivated this technique in recent years, but consuming King Spirit Nether's pills had also brought about significant improvement.

Qin Sang closed his eyes again, his mind connecting with his vital essence, experiencing his inner world.
A moment later, the Azure Phoenix Manifestation’s head suddenly moved, looking down at Qin Sang.  Its previously stiff expression gained a hint of liveliness.
Ever since True Man Zuo had pointed him towards the path of Inner Scenery and Outer Scenery, Qin Sang had a deeper understanding of manifestations.

At this moment, he was using his inner world to sense the Azure Phoenix Manifestation.  One day, perhaps he could, like the demon kings who had self-severed their cultivation, utilize the power of his manifestation, greatly increasing his strength!
It was easier said than done; even the other demon marquis found it extremely difficult to comprehend their manifestations.
Qin Sang first had the Azure Phoenix Manifestation and then comprehended it, which was smoother than he anticipated, but it quickly exhausted his mental energy, and he couldn't hide his fatigue when he stopped cultivating.

Next, comprehending the manifestation and regulating the Five Elements were essential.  However, with the poisonous fruit nectar nearly depleted, and the flower dew production stalled, it wouldn't be as smooth as before.
After regulating his breath, Qin Sang opened his cave dwelling and saw Sword Slave guarding outside.
"Congratulations, Realman, on getting one step closer to the Great Dao!"

Qin Sang smiled and expressed his gratitude, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for guarding me… Have you collected all the spirit materials I asked you to gather?"
Sword Slave replied, “Most of them have leads.  Nearly fifty percent are already in hand."
Qin Sang nodded and gave Sword Slave a jade slip, which recorded the refining methods for Heavenly Exquisite Jade and High-Grade Spirit Calming Incense.

"This…"
Sword Slave was both surprised and delighted, "This old slave is unworthy of such a generous gift from Realman!"
Qin Sang reassured him, "Isn't Fellow Daoist guarding me enough? I also want Fellow Daoist to help me with something. The spirit materials listed above, you keep a portion for your own needs, and for the rest, I want as much as you can get. Whatever you need, just come to me."

These spirit materials were rare and hard to find in the Storm Realm, but occasionally appeared in this realm. He himself was also keeping an eye out for them.
"This old slave obeys!"
Sword Slave carefully put away the jade slip.
Qin Sang looked Sword Slave up and down, asking the question in his mind, “In this humble Daoist’s opinion, Fellow Daoist has long possessed the ability to attempt Profound Void, and the chances of success should not be low.  Why not try it sooner?”

Sword Slave respectfully replied, “Master instructed this old slave to continue honing my sword intent. Presumably, my accumulation is still insufficient.”
“I see.  Accumulate greatly for an explosive breakthrough. Once Fellow Daoist steps into Profound Void, you will surely advance rapidly!”
Qin Sang understood. After exchanging a few pleasantries, he flew towards Pot Island on his escaping light.

Over the past years, Qin Sang had visited the Healing Platform several times to consult with Realman Yuan, but he hadn't started refining the war drum.
The Dao Court wasn’t pressing him, and he was happy to delay. Higher cultivation was also beneficial for refining.
“It’s time to start refining. Before that, let's re-refine the Bright Mountain Armor…”
Qin Sang pondered as he entered the Qi Residence and instructed Master Qi’s disciples to open the fire chamber.

The next part will officially enter the final stage of this volume.
Taking a day off to organize the plot. (End of Chapter)
