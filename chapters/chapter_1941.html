<h1>Chapter 1932: Justice</h1><p>A large stone struck the ground, rebounded, and tumbled down the hillside, crossing the mountain path before finally plunging into a ravine.  Grass flew, a tremendous roar echoing through the mountains.</p><p>The boy, using every ounce of his will, scrambled frantically outwards, narrowly escaping being crushed by the very trap he had set.  He'd almost died by his own hand.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>He gasped for breath, turning to look upwards.  A poisoned spear was embedded in a tree trunk, a weasel-like creature hanging lifelessly from it. Its head, tail, and limbs dangled limply;  bright red blood, mixed with dark-green venom, dripped down the spear.</p><p>The creature remained motionless, seemingly dead. But the boy dared not relax.  Ignoring the intense pain, he propped himself up and reloaded his crossbow.</p><p>‘*Thwack!*’</p><p>The bolt found its mark. The creature didn't react, but its body shuddered violently as it hung from the spear, spraying blood.</p><p>Certain the creature was dead, the boy collapsed, his strength completely spent. There was no triumphant feeling of a mortal slaying a beast; instead, lying among the grass, he stared blankly at the sky, muttering,  "Master, I have finally avenged you!"</p><p>Tears streamed down his face.  Memories flooded back – how warm and happy it once was, now replaced by such profound sorrow.</p><p>His mother had been frail and died when he was young. His father, a hunter, had perished in the mountains when he was eight.  At eight years old, he had to fend for himself.  Relatives and friends were kind, but all poor;  they couldn’t take him in, but offered what little help they could.</p><p>He knew he was a burden, so he tried not to trouble anyone, supporting himself as best he could.</p><p>Then his master arrived, teaching him to read and write, instilling in him a sense of morality. His master encouraged him to study, accepting no payment, and his master’s wife showed him an unexpected kindness, a warmth he'd longed for.</p><p>But happiness was short-lived.</p><p>One day, his master went to town to buy supplies for his students.  He didn't return that night.  The whole village searched, only to find a body.</p><p>The master's death was gruesome; his chest was ripped open, his organs missing, his body drained of blood, left as a desiccated corpse.</p><p>The boy clearly remembered the crushing blow of confirming it was his master. The master was the first victim of the creature, and more followed; the village organized hunts, but to no avail, losing several more lives in the process.</p><p>No one dared mention hunting the creature again. The boy couldn't find help, but his desire for revenge never faded. He knew the creature was powerful, that any mistake could cost him his life.  But he had to avenge his master; it was his duty as a student.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Pain interrupted his thoughts.  He raised his left arm, but the pain was too much; he could only lift it halfway. He removed a piece of metal from his arm, revealing a horrific wound.  His insides must be hurt too; it felt like a giant hand had squeezed his organs.</p><p>He stuffed a cloth into his mouth, biting down hard, while he tended to the wound.  Breathing deeply, he struggled to his feet, moved to the tree, and pulled at the spear.  It was deeply embedded; he had little strength left and couldn't budge it.</p><p>He removed the creature from the spear, using it as a makeshift crutch, and started his journey back.</p><p>The village was surrounded by earthworks, with added fortifications and patrols since the creature appeared.</p><p>Reaching the village, utterly exhausted, he raised the creature high, shouting, "I killed the monster!" then collapsed.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiao Wu and Zhu Que, having watched a month-long drama, felt it ended too soon.</p><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to the outside world, focused on repairing the Thunder Altar.  His skill increased steadily; it was almost completely restored.</p><p>Within a month, the restoration was complete.  After a short rest, Qin Sang activated the altar.  As expected, it resonated faintly with the other two.</p><p>He focused his mind on the connection, triggering another transformation in the altar.  Simultaneously, the location and relationship of the three altars appeared in his mind.</p><p>‘*Crackle!*’</p><p>Thunder and lightning erupted above the altar.  Qin Sang stood amidst the storm, unharmed; each lightning strike was unique, signifying a new change.</p><p>Through these changes, aided by comparison with the other two altars, Qin Sang's analysis became clearer, finally pointing towards a specific direction.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.  Though he still couldn't sense the main altar, knowing its location made the search much easier, unless it had been completely destroyed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The lightning vanished into the altar, which fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the thunder altar with a formation and prepared to immediately search for the main altar.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge from the rocks, Xiao Wu and Zhuque looked over.</p><p>“Repaired?” Zhuque asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  “I've located the main altar…  Wait, Taiyi brought someone, waiting in the distance.  Perhaps they have a discovery.”</p><p>He sent a signal, summoning Taiyi.</p><p>Shortly after, a white cloud drifted in from afar, bearing Taiyi and an elderly Daoist.</p><p>“Master, this is Jing Chun, the head of the Xinhuo Temple.”</p><p>Following Luo Hou’s example, Taiyi addressed Qin Sang as “Master” in front of others, and introduced the Daoist, “This is my master, dharma name Qingfeng.”</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qingfeng.”</p><p>Jing Chun, having debated with Taiyi for days, held him in high regard.  He showed even greater respect to Qin Sang, whom Taiyi addressed as “Master.”</p><p>Through Taiyi’s account, Qin Sang learned that Xinhuo Temple was the largest sect in the vicinity, possessing a lineage of thunder Dao techniques.</p><p>Taiyi had mostly investigated this lineage.  While connected to the Heavenly Court's Thunder Department, it was unremarkable.  Worried he’d overlooked something, he brought Jing Chun for Qin Sang’s assessment.</p><p>Jing Chun, owing some favor to Taiyi, answered Qin Sang’s questions thoroughly.  Unfortunately, the Xinhuo Temple’s legacy offered little of note.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to leave when Zhuque stopped him, acting spoiled.</p><p>“There’s a good show we haven’t finished watching yet! A few more days won’t hurt, wait a bit longer!”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, upon hearing the full story, Jing Chun shouted angrily.</p><p>“A beast wreaking havoc?  Such a thing! Our temple has an agreement with the deities; no Earth God temples are established nearby.  We oversee the area.  This incident is our oversight; please excuse us.”</p><p>Jing Chun was filled with righteous indignation, but if he acted in accordance with his words, the young man wouldn't have needed to fight, and the monster would have been slain immediately after harming people.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, glanced at Xiao Wu, and said, “Since you’re interested, waiting a few more days won’t be a problem.”</p><p>They sat down on the ground.</p><p>Jing Chun was apprehensive, but relaxed once he saw Qin Sang wasn't blaming Xinhuo Temple.</p><p>With nothing to do, Qin Sang asked Jing Chun about any ancient legends of the area.</p><p>Jing Chun recounted various legendary tales; most were absurd, some interesting, but none verifiable.</p><p>Sixth day.</p><p>A rainbow light appeared in the distance, heading straight for them.</p><p>“The main players are here.”</p><p>Zhuque chuckled, glancing at Jing Chun, clearly anticipating another spectacle.</p><p>Everyone stood up, concealed their forms, and vanished from the mountaintop.</p><p>The rainbow light was a遁光 (swift movement technique), encasing a flying shuttle with a man and a woman inside.</p><p>Both were young, with noble bearing and attire, like the children of royalty.</p><p>The man comforted the woman. “Sister, don’t worry, the aura is getting stronger, the Jade Dragon Sable is nearby. That little fellow managed to escape my manor, it’s quite clever.  It won’t provoke strong enemies, at most it’ll eat a few mortals, it’ll be fine.”</p><p>“You still say that!”</p><p>The woman was distraught.  “It’s all your fault! You swore your people would take care of it, you said I could entrust it to your manor, and now it’s gone! If anything happens to my Jade Dragon Sable, I’ll go to Master and hold you accountable!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, hold me accountable.  If the Jade Dragon Sable dies, I’ll replace it with a new one, and kill those maids to vent your anger, alright?”</p><p>The man nervously tried to appease her.</p><p>“I don’t want a new one, I want my Jade Dragon Sable!”</p><p>The woman’s lips pouted, then her face lit up.  She cried out joyfully, “I found it!”</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The rainbow light descended, landing above a village.</p><p>The two materialized above the village, their gaze fixed on the north, where a small Earth God temple stood.</p><p>Seeing the scene inside the temple, the woman’s face went pale, and the man’s turned ashen.</p><p>Since the young man had brought back the sable’s corpse, he had become the village hero. No one dared to eat the demonic corpse; it was offered to the Earth God.</p><p>“Who! Who dared to kill my sister’s Jade Dragon Sable!”</p><p>The man roared in fury.</p><p>Upon seeing the wounds on the Jade Dragon Sable, the woman wept, while the man was stunned.</p><p>These wounds…”</p><p>The man felt no trace of magic or magical artifacts.  There was no earth god in the earth temple.  He said incredulously, “Could it have been killed by ordinary people?”</p><p>Even the weakest Jade Dragon Weasel was a spirit beast. How could ordinary people withstand its magic?</p><p>The man’s roar startled the entire village.  Villagers, young and old, poured out of their homes, following the shout to the earth shrine, where they saw the couple.</p><p>“They’re gods!”</p><p>Someone noticed the couple were levitating, and exclaimed, causing an immediate commotion.</p><p>“Real gods!”</p><p>“The gods have appeared! They’ve come to slay the demon!”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers chattered excitedly.  Never imagining the beast was owned by gods, they believed the gods had come to vanquish evil.  Their eyes shone with fervent belief.</p><p>“Who killed my junior sister’s Jade Dragon Weasel? Step forward!”</p><p>The man’s eyes were like knives, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>The woman, without looking back, hugged the weasel’s corpse and wept.</p><p>The villagers finally realized something was amiss. They looked at each other, silent as death, dodging the man’s intense gaze.</p><p>“I killed it!”</p><p>A strong, resonant voice rose from the crowd.  The village elder stepped forward.</p><p>“Village Head…”</p><p>Someone started to speak, but the Village Head stopped them with a wave of his hand.</p><p>The Village Head stood out, his spine straight as an arrow before the gods.  “This demon slaughtered more than a dozen people in our village, disemboweling them and draining their blood, leaving behind nothing but mutilated corpses. I killed it to avenge my people! If you immortals wish to avenge this beast, kill me instead. Don't punish others. My old bones are ready to rest.”</p><p>These words were not only addressed to the two immortals but also to the villagers behind him.</p><p>The villagers understood the Village Head’s intention: he was old, the youth was young.  He was a hero for slaying the demon, willing to die in his place.</p><p>The Village Head’s family could only weep softly.</p><p>Several strong men surrounded the youth, holding him back forcefully.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The man sneered, “You mortals dare deceive this immortal! Your crime is compounded! Come forward!”</p><p>A furious shout almost shattered the villagers’ souls.</p><p>The youth felt his body tense as a tremendous force lifted him into the air, throwing him to the ground.</p><p>The men who tried to stop him were thrown back, spitting blood, unable to get up.</p><p>The Village Head’s attempt to take the blame couldn’t escape the man’s discerning eyes.  A faint resentment clung to the youth, confirming him as the culprit.</p><p>But the man didn’t believe the youth could have killed the Jade Dragon Weasel alone. He sneered, “Who else? Did the entire village participate?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The Village Head’s face turned ashen. The man was going to slaughter the whole village!</p><p>“Are demons allowed to eat people, but we can't fight back? What kind of justice is that!” the youth cried out in grief and anger.</p><p>“Hmph! What are you? A bunch of ignorant peasants daring to reason with this immortal!”</p><p>The man kept an eye on his junior sister; this display was meant to appease her.  “No one’s stepping forward, is that it? Fine!”</p><p>Seeing his junior sister remained unresponsive, the man raised his hand, palm forward, his fingers like swords, shooting five beams of sword energy directly at the villagers.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A roar echoed from above.</p><p>Seeing his intent to slaughter the villagers, Daoist Jingchun couldn’t help but reveal himself, dispersing the five beams of sword energy with his shout.  Qin Sang and the others landed beside him.</p><p>“Senior Jingchun!”</p><p>The man was shocked to see Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>The woman trembled, dropping the weasel’s corpse, her face pale.</p><p>Their sect possessed some strength, but facing the head of Xin Huo Temple, even their master would bow.</p><p>“Damn it! You raised a spirit beast that went down the mountain to harm people, then indiscriminately slaughtered an entire village! Two fine disciples of Yin Xiao Sect, indeed!”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun’s sharp words were like thunder to the couple, who knelt trembling on the ground.</p><p>“Senior, how should we deal with these wicked disciples?” Daoist Jingchun's actions frightened them even more.</p><p>“Since your sect has issued its rules, just follow them,” Qin Sang turned to Xiao Wu and Zhuque, “Had enough of a show?”</p><p>“Boring! Too weak. A Nascent Soul cultivator would be much more entertaining,” Zhuque shook its head and tail, its arrogant tone startling even Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>“Don’t push your luck.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head; attracting a Nascent Soul cultivator would be unfavorable to his current form.</p><p>“This matter is settled. We take our leave.”</p><p>Everyone bowed to Daoist Jingchun to bid farewell.</p><p>The villagers, having experienced such a drastic shift in fortune, were dazed, only now realizing these immortals were good, that they had come to save them. They knelt to thank them.</p><p>“Mingyue, the immortals saved us, hurry and thank them for their life-saving grace!”</p><p>Seeing the youth still in a daze, the Village Head hurried forward and pulled him, kneeling with him.</p><p>Qin Sang, already turning to leave, suddenly stopped and looked back at the youth. “Your name is Mingyue?”</p>
