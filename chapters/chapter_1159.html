<h1>Chapter 1151: The Azure Phoenix Manifestation</h1><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Bai's speculation might be correct. The Yin-Yang Armor on his primordial spirit couldn't have shattered without reason. When the Azure Phoenix phantom entered his body, the vision he saw of the Azure Phoenix soaring through the void and thunderous marshes might not have been a mere illusion.</p><p>With only a Golden Core cultivation level, he was able to withstand the impact of the Azure Phoenix's essence blood. This indicated that its power had significantly diminished; otherwise, he would have exploded and died on the spot.</p><p>Correspondingly, even if remnants of the Azure Phoenix's consciousness remained, it was likely on the verge of dissipating. Bai, hiding within the Soul-Nurturing Wood, was now reduced to a wisp of a remnant soul, with nearly all memories lost.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix's consciousness, blocked by the Jade Buddha, had most likely been scattered.</p><p>He meticulously searched every inch of his body, including the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Bai, not overthinking it, admired the Heavenly Eye Butterfly for a while before recalling something and asking, "With both your physical body and spirit insect breaking through, you should have a decent chance of forming your Nascent Soul, right? When do you plan to attempt the breakthrough?"</p><p>"The sooner, the better! After settling the spirits of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, I will go into seclusion to sort out my past, adjust my state, and then head to the Yun Cang Marsh to find a place to undergo my tribulation," Qin Sang replied solemnly.</p><p>The situation was becoming increasingly tense, and the cultivation world was in turmoil.</p><p>Although he now possessed strength close to that of a Nascent Soul cultivator, it still wasn't enough.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's threat was one concern.</p><p>He had stolen treasures from the Ten Thousand Serpent Abyss. Although he had temporarily concealed his identity, the Azure Phoenix Wings were too unique. If the Serpent King were to investigate thoroughly, there was a significant chance his origins would be uncovered.</p><p>Only after forming his Nascent Soul would he truly qualify to be a player in the game.</p><p>Bai nodded, "I, too, am at a critical juncture. After you undergo your tribulation, I will continue my seclusion. This time, it will likely take a long time..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly asked, "After this seclusion, Brother Bai should be able to refine the Corpse Soul Pearl and advance to a Corpse King, right? Have you figured out a way to remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Bai hesitated, "I can't say for certain, but I have some confidence. As for the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I won't know until I fully refine the Corpse Soul Pearl. The outcome is still uncertain. Didn't you have an old acquaintance who found clues about the Heavenly Corpse Sect? We shouldn't abandon that lead. It would be best to locate the Heavenly Corpse Sect, even if it's just ruins."</p><p>"You mean Tan Hao?" Qin Sang nodded. "After forming my Nascent Soul, I will have a proper discussion with Tan Yien and seek out Tan Hao's old friends. We might uncover some clues. Judging from the tone of Tan Hao's letter, he seemed quite confident. It's somewhat surprising that the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters is within the Sin Abyss. In the future, whether as a human or a demon, I will definitely go to the battlefield and find a way to infiltrate the Sin Abyss for investigation."</p><p>...</p><p>The two chatted for a while.</p><p>Neither the Heavenly Eye Butterfly nor the Fat Chicken showed any signs of awakening.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to his dantian and, carrying the Fat Chicken, flew toward the agreed meeting point.</p><p>In a cave in the wilderness.</p><p>Upon receiving Qin Sang's signal, the group of demons dismantled the formation and withdrew from their ambush positions, returning to the cave to hide and await Qin Sang.</p><p>They had been lurking at a distance, only sensing the thunderous tribulation from afar, unaware of what had actually happened or whether Qin Sang had escaped the pursuit of the demon king.</p><p>They had been on edge all night.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang returned!</p><p>"Meow! Young Master Qin is back!" The white cat leaped out.</p><p>The demons were overjoyed and gathered around.</p><p>Under their expectant gazes, Qin Sang smiled and said, "Mission accomplished! The gains were even greater than expected. Let's discuss it after we return."</p><p>The demons, filled with joy, returned to the Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the Fat Chicken to the Willow Spirit, instructing them to guard the formation and not disturb him unless something major occurred. He then sealed his cave.</p><p>For several months, Qin Sang did not leave.</p><p>His first priority was to consolidate the fourth layer of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix's essence blood was an external force. Although Qin Sang had visualized the Azure Phoenix during his cultivation, he still felt somewhat disconnected from the phoenix wings. He calmed his mind, comprehending the fourth layer of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* while refining the phoenix wings, aiming for a seamless integration.</p><p>At this stage, the technique was fully stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang also gained some insights into the subsequent layers of the fourth stage.</p><p>"Manifestation! Appear!"</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, softly chanting. A flash of azure light enveloped him, and a gust of wind rose behind him as the Azure Phoenix Manifestation materialized.</p><p>Though called a manifestation, it was extremely illusory, barely even a phantom.</p><p>Like a reflection in water, it could dissipate at the slightest touch.</p><p>Such a manifestation naturally couldn't be expected to achieve much.</p><p>"The Heavenly Demon Manifestation requires continuous refinement to gradually reveal its power. It's a gradual process," Qin Sang mused, recalling the technique's description. "At my current level, the Heavenly Demon Manifestation enhances my strength when I activate the Heavenly Demon Transformation. The effect isn't significant now, but as the manifestation solidifies, the benefits will grow. Additionally, the fourth layer mentions that after comprehending the Heavenly Demon Manifestation, there's a chance to gain some of the Heavenly Demon's divine abilities. But the Azure Phoenix Manifestation doesn't seem to have anything special..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, "If a demon were to cultivate this technique, the divine abilities they comprehended would likely come from their ancestors, inherited through their bloodline. As an outsider cultivating an incomplete technique, have I missed out?"</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted. "Could it be the Thunder Escape technique? Fusing with the Thunder Phoenix's essence blood and inheriting Thunder Escape is highly possible!"</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, mastering the Thunder Escape technique was more valuable than other divine abilities.</p><p>Having been stranded overseas and entering the Seven Slaughter Palace three times, he had faced countless dangers. Many times, it was his superior escape techniques that saved him.</p><p>Advance to attack, retreat to defend!</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman would become less useful. Thunder Escape was far superior to mere talismans.</p><p>"The fourth layer, like the previous three, only requires drawing upon the power of the celestial stars to temper the body step by step. However, the Bone Flute still hasn't revealed the fifth layer. I've already imprinted the Azure Phoenix's divine essence. Will I be able to break through to the fifth layer the next time I use star energy to temper my body? That would grant power comparable to a Deity Transformation cultivator!"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Bone Flute and probed it with his divine sense. The later chapters were still shrouded in mist.</p><p>After some contemplation, Qin Sang put away the manifestation and the Bone Flute, then summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>During his seclusion, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had also gained control over its newfound power. It had grown larger but still preferred to shrink to its previous size, perching on Qin Sang's shoulder and gently nuzzling his cheek.</p><p>"I wonder how the Heavenly Eye ability will improve after the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's advancement," Qin Sang mused, glancing at the spirit insect. He suspected whether it could still be considered part of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly species, as its Heavenly Eye ability and Thunder Control ability had fused, completely diverging from its original path.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and entered a meditative state, merging his consciousness with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to comprehend the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>*Creak!*</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the door open and saw the white cat guarding the outer hall.</p><p>"Young Master Qin..." The white cat stood up.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Go call Willow Daoist and the others. I have an announcement to make."</p><p>******</p>
