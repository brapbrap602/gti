<h1>Chapter 1190: The Demon-Sealing Pillar</h1><p>"Though it may be a bit late, I still must offer my congratulations. Congratulations, Junior Brother Qin, for taking another step forward on the Great Dao and becoming one of us," Qing Jun said with a slight smile, her lips curving upward as she offered her felicitations.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled lightly, "I am merely following in your footsteps, Senior Sister."</p><p>"Ha, I don't possess such great abilities as you do. To slay a cultivator of the same realm right after forming your Nascent Soulâ€”truly remarkable," Qing Jun shook her head slightly, her tone laced with both admiration and a hint of jest.</p><p>"I was also quite wary of Chanling Daoist. Yet, you managed to slay Old Demon Pei right under his nose. I knew your dual cultivation of body and spirit would make you extraordinary after forming your Nascent Soul, but I never expected you to rise to such fame so quickly!" Qing Jun's eyes sparkled with a mix of surprise and curiosity.</p><p>When she first heard the news, she and Elder Zhenyi had thought it was a mere rumor.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively, "Brother Jinglin's report was somewhat exaggerated. In a one-on-one battle, even if I could defeat Old Demon Pei, it would have been nearly impossible for me to destroy his Nascent Soul."</p><p>"That's true. Nascent Soul cultivators have countless means to escape with their lives," Qing Jun's eyes gleamed with a knowing light. "But don't sell yourself short. Even under the same conditions, few others could have achieved what you did. It's fortunate that you used the identity of a demon king as a cover. Otherwise, with such a figure appearing out of nowhere, both regions would have launched thorough investigations, and your secret wouldn't have remained hidden for long."</p><p>Qin Sang shrugged indifferently, "Even if my identity were exposed, it wouldn't matter. My actions weren't out of fear of Dongyang Bo, but because I currently lack the strength to face him directly. If he knew it was me, he would be on guard, making it even harder to find an opportunity."</p><p>Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo's enmity was no secret to Qing Jun, and she knew there was no chance of reconciliation. She didn't offer any unnecessary advice.</p><p>Changing the subject, she asked, "So, what important matter brings you here in person this time?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the side hall and waved his hand, setting up several layers of barriers to block any prying eyes. Seeing Qin Sang's caution, Qing Jun's expression turned serious.</p><p>"There are two matters. The first concerns the Shadow Crystal Tower. Senior Sister, do you remember the strange divine ability the ancient demon from the Seven Slaughter Palace used?" Qin Sang's voice grew low as he recounted his findings to Qing Jun in detail.</p><p>Behind the Sin Abyss, the shadow of a demon loomed faintly. He needed to discuss with Qing Jun how to deal with this threat in the future.</p><p>"The Shadow Crystal Tower is connected to the ancient demon?" Qing Jun's eyes narrowed. "How certain are you?"</p><p>"It's intuition. The effects and fluctuations of the Soul-Severing Spike bear similarities to the ancient demon's divine abilities, but in terms of power and manifestation, they are worlds apart..." Qin Sang struggled to articulate his thoughts. "Precisely because there's no concrete evidence, it would be difficult to convince others. They would likely dismiss it as alarmist talk."</p><p>Qin Jun didn't doubt his judgment. After a long moment of contemplation, she looked up and said, "During the years I was away, I was actually traveling through the Sin Abyss."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. At that time, the Sin Abyss had shown no signs of mobilizing for war, and the Nascent Soul Ancestors were all secluded in their caves. If Qing Jun's identity had been exposed, she would have faced relentless pursuit and attacks.</p><p>The Sin Abyss was akin to a dragon's den or a tiger's lair, yet she had traveled there for so many years. Qin Sang quickly realized that Qing Jun's ability to disguise herself as Leng Yuntian for so long was proof enough of her exceptional skills in concealment.</p><p>Qin Jun continued, "After receiving your warning, I wanted to search for evidence linking the Sin Abyss to the ancient demon. Over the years, I've explored almost every part of the Sin Abyss, except for the top sects and a few key secret locations. Aside from their militaristic tendencies, I found nothing overtly unusual..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, "What are you implying, Senior Sister?"</p><p>"Based on your findings, it only suggests that the Shadow Crystal Tower is connected to the ancient demon. Perhaps the Shadow Crystal Tower is a treasure created by the ancient demon, and the Sin Abyss somehow obtained the method to forge it..." Qing Jun voiced her speculation, which aligned with Qin Sang's earlier thoughts.</p><p>It was highly likely that the Sin Abyss had inherited some form of ancient demon legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said with concern, "Senior Sister, you should still be cautious in the future. I've already instructed my juniors to prepare an escape route. If things take a turn for the worse, it would be best to lay low for a while."</p><p>Qin Jun nodded appreciatively, "Thank you for the reminder, Junior Brother. I'll be careful. If there truly is such a powerful ancient demon, I won't be reckless. I'm a lone wolf, after all, and can retreat at any time."</p><p>She had no attachment to the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang trusted that Qing Jun would make her own judgments and didn't press further. Instead, he brought up another matter, "A while ago, I went to the Yuan Zhao Sect to demand the Ten Directions Yama Banners of Patriarch Kuiyin. I heard that you were also searching for them?"</p><p>Qin Jun was momentarily stunned, then realization dawned on her. "The fire banners you used against Old Demon Pei were the Ten Directions Yama Banners, weren't they? I heard you unleashed twelve of them, two more than Patriarch Kuiyin himself. I didn't dare to make the connection. So, Patriarch Kuiyin's legacy fell into your hands. No wonder I couldn't find any leads after searching for so long."</p><p>As she spoke, Qing Jun raised her hand, and seven demon banners materialized in her palm. She handed them directly to Qin Sang.</p><p>"They're useless in my hands. Take them all. Once you repair all these Ten Directions Yama Banners, you'll be able to dominate the Nascent Soul stage."</p><p>One of the banners was intact, while the other six were severely damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept over them, noticing that the Netherworld Demon Fire within the six damaged banners had dissipated, but the banner poles themselves were still intact.</p><p>With this, the Mystic Iron Pillars were complete.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no Netherworld Demon Fire here, so he couldn't repair the damaged banners. At most, he would have nineteen banners in the future.</p><p>"Why were you interested in Patriarch Kuiyin's demonic artifacts?" Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Qin Jun smiled mysteriously and picked up a bare banner pole. "With so many Ten Directions Yama Banners in your possession and having witnessed the ancient demon firsthand, don't you know the origin of these artifacts?"</p><p>She paused, not intending to keep him in suspense, and under Qin Sang's astonished gaze, she revealed, "The restrictions within these banner poles originate from an ancient treasure known as the Demon-Sealing Pillar. It's said to be a treasure specifically designed to suppress ancient demons! I discovered these while exploring an ancient restricted area in the Purple Micro Palace. Thinking of the demonic shadows during the Sin Abyss's sneak attack, I grew concerned. When I saw the banner poles in the Wuji Sect and learned they were Patriarch Kuiyin's Ten Directions Yama Banners, I considered repairing the Demon-Sealing Pillar. However, I later realized it was impossible. Even if I gathered all the pieces, I wouldn't know how to set up the spirit formation..."</p><p>As Qing Jun explained, Qin Sang grew increasingly astonished. "The Demon-Sealing Pillar! The Demon-Binding Rope! They truly are treasures of the same kind!"</p><p>"You know of the Demon-Binding Rope?" Qing Jun was surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded repeatedly and, with a sweep of his divine sense, retrieved the Demon-Binding Rope he had obtained from an ancient cultivator's ruins. "Senior Sister, take a look. Is this it?"</p><p>Qin Jun recognized it immediately, her eyes lighting up with delight. "It is indeed the Demon-Binding Rope! Where did you obtain it?"</p><p>"I found it in an abandoned ruin within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield..." Qin Sang briefly explained the rope's origin. "Unfortunately, the Demon-Binding Rope also requires a specific spirit formation to be effective. Otherwise, wielding such an ancient treasure against the ancient demon would give us more confidence."</p><p>He and Bai had copied the spirit formation from the ancient cultivator's ruins. He had hoped that once Bai advanced to a Corpse King and regained some memories, they might be able to reconstruct the formation.</p>
