<h1>Chapter 1800: Broken Drum</h1><p>As soon as the talisman appeared, Qin Sang felt a suction force.  Releasing his control, the talisman was drawn into the clouds.</p><p>After a short while, the clouds behind the gate parted, and two golden-armored guards emerged.  "Greetings, Qingfeng Zhenren. The talisman is authentic.  May we ask whom you wish to see and which immortal official you are visiting?"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in return, saying, "The Merit Office."</p><p>Within the two courts of the Daoist Court, the Tianshu Yuan and the Bei Ji Exorcism Yuan have similar structures, like secular government offices, each governing various regions, with temples, pavilions, and offices at lower levels, regulating affairs and managing various matters.</p><p>Cultivators outside the Daoist Court most often interact with the Merit Office. As its name suggests, the Daoist Court's summons originate from this office, which is where merits are recorded and discussed.</p><p>The golden-armored guards exchanged glances. Without any visible incantations, the clouds parted again, revealing a path of clouds, seemingly leading to a celestial palace.</p><p>"This way, Zhenren!"</p><p>The golden-armored guards led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely.</p><p>This was the heart of the Daoist Court. To avoid any accidental offense to a high-ranking immortal and unnecessary trouble, Qin Sang did not awaken the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to observe.</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled.</p><p>Entering the clouds, the cloud density was initially high, but vastly different from the auspicious clouds of the Jushan administrative office.</p><p>Here, everything was stable, lacking the chaotic energy fluctuations. The celestial palace ahead seemed increasingly ethereal, creating a sense of inexplicable tranquility.</p><p>Perhaps, the Jushan administrative office once looked like this.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed the presence of a formation, though inactive, yet it still caused a sense of apprehension, preventing him from acting rashly.</p><p>As they passed through the mist, the scene ahead gradually cleared.  Qin Sang saw that the two golden-armored guards were leading him towards a golden hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with this type of golden hall; it resembled those in the Jushan administrative office, though most of those were ruined and exuded an ancient, weathered atmosphere.</p><p>Reaching the end of the cloud path, he stepped onto solid ground, with a courtyard before him, bearing a plaque that read: Merit Office.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, seeing the celestial palace still ahead, though clearer now.  Amidst the sea of clouds were numerous celestial mountains and layers of golden halls, reaching the highest heavens, inspiring a longing in his heart.</p><p>After escorting Qin Sang, the two golden-armored guards bowed and withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, seeing no other immortal officials. While he was pondering this, he saw a Daoist approach from within the courtyard.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang followed him towards the main hall, where a person stood before the entrance.</p><p>This person wore a Liuyi Jiao Tai crown and a rhinoceros hairpin.  His robes were in shades of green, teal, and light yellow, featuring clouds, mountains, and seven stars. He wore a jade pendant and red shoes.</p><p>His eyebrows were sharp, his eyes bright, making him stand out from the crowd.</p><p>"Mid-Transformation Stage cultivation.  Rank 4, Nine Heavens Interview Envoy!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred; this person should be the Merit Office's chief recorder, the head official.</p><p>Ordinary individuals would never meet the chief recorder; only because Qin Sang was also a Dongxuan Zhenren could he receive a personal audience.</p><p>"This humble one, Qingfeng, greets the Nine Heavens Interview Envoy." Qin Sang bowed deeply.</p><p>The Daoist did not display any arrogance due to his status, nor the demeanor of a Daoist Court official; he returned the bow with a smile.  "Greetings, Qingfeng Zhenren. My Daoist name is Ning Luo.  Wan Zhenren recently sent a message to the Merit Office; we are well aware of your accomplishments. Your solo slaying of Li Hou filled us with admiration.  It is an honor to finally meet you in person."</p><p>Qin Sang remained humble, attributing it to luck.</p><p>After a few more words, they moved to the main topic.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren returned to his desk and retrieved a jade slip, holding it in his hand.</p><p>"For slaying the demonic marquis, the Merit Office has its procedures. However, Wan Zhenren took the demonic corpse; its value is difficult to determine and needs to be discussed with you personally.  Would you prefer merit points, or an exchange for other treasures?"</p><p>Many factors influenced the corpse's value.</p><p>Qin Sang had already taken the most valuable items like the demonic core, but the remaining bones, scales, tendons, and blood were still of considerable value.</p><p>The easiest option was to exchange it for a similar demonic corpse.</p><p>The jade slip in Ning Luo Zhenren's hand listed various exchangeable treasures, varying in value, but generally within a specific range.</p><p>Qin Sang was not interested in this; he asked directly: "For slaying Li Hou, can I exchange it for eligibility to receive a third-tier Daoist technique?"</p><p>"What Daoist technique are you cultivating, Zhenren?" Ning Luo Zhenren asked.</p><p>"High Upper Divine Thunder Technique!"</p><p>…</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren pondered:  "The third-tier technique of the High Upper Divine Thunder Technique is the Five Thunders Secret Technique, which can be granted by the Exorcism Yuan; exchanging only Li Hou's body would be more than sufficient. However, though the Exorcism Yuan has the corresponding Wan Shen Lei Si Immortal Guide, we aren't sure which immortal would be available…"</p><p>Zhan Gui Zhenren had already warned Qin Sang about this.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately expressed his desire to receive the Five Thunders Secret Technique.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren nodded, immediately sent a message to the Investiture Office, saying, "According to procedure, preparing for a single individual's investiture ceremony requires three days.  After three days, you may proceed directly to the Investiture Office."</p><p>Finally, it was settled!</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved. Looking at the jade slip in Ning Luo Zhenren's hand, she didn't reach for it, but said, "I wish to exchange my remaining merits for the notes on altar construction left by a senior cultivator of the Five Thunder Secret Technique. Is that possible?"</p><p>Unlike the first two stages of the technique, previously Qin Sang could rely on her cultivation to quickly comprehend it.  Now she would need to cultivate and understand the talisman forms simultaneously, gradually constructing the altar.</p><p>Having a senior's experience would save her a lot of time and effort.</p><p>This request actually involved the most profound secrets of the High God's Xuanxiao School, and Qin Sang was a little apprehensive about whether the court would agree.</p><p>Since Ruoli Hou was only at the early stage of the Nascent Soul realm, her hopes were not high.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren didn't seem surprised by Qin Sang's request.  Putting down the jade slip, she mused, "In the Northern Polar Extermination Office, there are indeed some relevant texts.  Moreover, both offices share resources, and I can obtain relevant texts from both offices for you to study…"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed; she hadn't expected it to be so smooth. However, she then heard Ning Luo Zhenren's tone shift.</p><p>"However, I have a request.  If you successfully cultivate the Five Thunder Secret Technique and summon a Thunder God from the Ten Thousand God Thunder Office's celestial summons, you must immediately report to the court and record your insights without reservation."</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren smiled, "If you can achieve this feat, it will greatly benefit future generations! I can then attempt to mediate and obtain some texts from the Left and Right Thunder Palaces. With your simultaneous cultivation of the physical and spiritual bodies, your talent is exceptional and rare; I believe the two Palace Masters would gladly approve."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>She had initially suspected that the court deliberately withheld guidance on summoning gods to limit external forces and maintain its supreme position in the Daoist world.</p><p>Judging from Ning Luo Zhenren's tone, it seemed that the Thunder Gods were indeed difficult to summon.</p><p>Could even the Left and Right Thunder Palaces not summon the Gods?</p><p>Qin Sang had a thought.</p><p>It was well-known that the protective deities formed through contemplating the inner truth provided less protection for the primordial spirit than the Gods themselves.</p><p>According to Zhan Gui Zhenren, under normal circumstances, this protection should at least last until one breaks through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>When the inner truth reaches its limit and can no longer protect oneself, one would inevitably have to request further investiture from the court.</p><p>In the future, if her cultivation exceeded the limit, and she couldn't summon a Thunder God, nor seek further investiture from the court, it would certainly arouse suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated slightly.</p><p>She didn't know when she could find a path to ascension, and she wasn't sure how long she would stay in this world.</p><p>On second thought, she was still far from the late Nascent Soul stage. She could make excuses then.</p><p>The texts from the court and the Left and Right Thunder Palaces could greatly benefit her, clearly outweighing the risks.</p><p>If, one day, she was truly forced by the court, to prevent the Jade Buddha from being exposed, she could always feign primordial spirit confusion and request further investiture.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang immediately agreed and made an oath as a pledge.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren's face lit up with joy, "Negotiating with the Heavenly Pivot Academy and the Left and Right Thunder Palaces will take time.  We can only determine the value once the texts are gathered. Please stay at the altar for a few more days..."</p><p>Qin Sang found Ning Luo Zhenren’s offer surprisingly generous; she could continue to exchange remaining merits for other treasures, or even receive credit if her merits were insufficient.</p><p>She sensed the goodwill from the other party, but she didn’t know whether it was Ning Luo Zhenren acting on her own initiative or if the court valued her.</p><p>“It’s necessary to show a certain level of strength at the right time,”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to herself, thanking Ning Luo Zhenren.</p><p>Ning Luo Zhenren gave Qin Sang a token, granting her free lodging in a cave mansion near the altar while she awaited news.</p><p>Having achieved her goal, Qin Sang didn't stay long and left the Northern Polar Extermination Office.</p><p>On her way, Qin Sang pondered her next steps, planning to go directly to the cave mansion to cultivate in seclusion and await her investiture ceremony three days later.</p><p>The cave mansion was located next to the Northern Polar Extermination Office. It was normally rented out to outsiders and was court property.</p><p>On the immortal peak, there were caves, halls, and secluded courtyards hidden in the misty mountains and forests, all cave mansions, with varying levels of quality.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the token, and a Daoist priest led her towards the area where the high-quality cave mansions were located.</p><p>Looking at the high-quality cave mansions, hidden among the mountains and forests and sealed by formations, Qin Sang seemed to remember something. She suddenly stopped and said to the priest beside her, "Tell me the location of the cave mansion, then you can leave."</p><p>The priest bowed in response, not daring to ask the reason.  He told Qin Sang the incantation to open the cave mansion, then turned and went down the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at her cave mansion, pondered for a moment, then walked in another direction.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived at a courtyard.</p><p>A secluded and humble courtyard, unlike others, its outer wall a somewhat haphazard fence, hid behind two wooden doors.  Beyond the fence lay a vast expanse of cultivated land, a thriving medicinal herb garden, clear evidence of a resident caretaker.</p><p>Several square, black stone houses stood raised within the courtyard, forming a peculiar circle.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing a strong fiery elemental energy, smiled slightly, activated a warding seal, and said, "I am Qingfeng, here to visit Master Gu."</p><p>Before the words left his mouth, a delicately-featured young acolyte emerged from the stone houses.</p><p>The acolyte swiftly approached the gate and declared formally,  "My master has decreed no further refinement for ten years.  If you seek to craft artifacts, please consult another master."</p><p>This Master Gu, whom Qin Sang wished to visit, was a renowned artifact refiner with some acquaintance with Master Lingxu. Qin Sang had learned of Master Gu's residence from Lingxu, originally intending to have the master examine some damaged treasures.</p><p>"Please inform your master. I do not seek refinement. I have a treasure of unknown origin and wish for Master Gu's appraisal."</p><p>The acolyte immediately returned to the stone houses, soon reappearing to invite Qin Sang inside.</p><p>The interior of the stone house held a surprise—elegant furnishings and a magnificent bronze Boshan incense burner.  The high, pointed, openwork lid was shaped like layered mountains, intricately carved with clouds, figures, and animals—a breathtaking work of art.</p><p>Incense burned within, the smoke swirling around the burner, creating a hazy, ethereal scene, resembling misty mountains and mythical creatures.  The room filled with a fragrant aroma.</p><p>A refined female cultivator sat on a meditation cushion: Master Gu, a stark contrast to the unkempt Master Qi.</p><p>"Please sit, Realperson Qingfeng.  I don't believe we've met." Master Gu's voice was cool.</p><p>"I've been cultivating in Mount Ju, recently ascending to the Dongxuan realm and currently preparing for my ascension ceremony," Qin Sang explained.</p><p>Master Gu nodded understandingly; she had heard similar stories before—a cultivator obtaining a treasure of unknown use at a lower level, fearing the consequences until their cultivation allowed them to seek identification.</p><p>A treasure even Dongxuan realm cultivators couldn't identify…</p><p>Anticipation flickered in her eyes.  "What treasure does Realperson Qingfeng wish to have appraised?"</p><p>"A damaged drum…" Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Two of the three damaged treasures obtained from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remained of unknown origin.</p><p>Considering the proximity to the North Pole Exorcism Academy, and the obvious large hole in the damaged drum—even if it was a rare treasure, a mere fragment would not cause a significant stir.  The Chengying Sword, however, appeared undamaged, and best presented to another master refiner.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang produced the damaged drum, placing it on the table.  A clear hole marred the drum's surface, lacking the peculiar characteristics of typical damaged treasure fragments.</p><p>Yet, the moment Master Gu saw the drum, her gaze was captivated, lingering for a long time.</p><p>Noticing her expression, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  He thought, "The Wuxiang Immortal Sect plundered so many good treasures from the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>Master Gu took a deep breath, glanced at Qin Sang, who nodded subtly in understanding.</p><p>Master Gu gently picked up the drum, handling it with utmost care, as if admiring a priceless artifact.</p><p>Then, with a delicate flick of her finger, the incense smoke from the Boshan burner was drawn to the drum, swirling around it.  The smoke seeped through the hole in the drum's surface, transforming into countless birds and beasts, continually attacking the drum before dissipating.</p><p>"It is indeed an artifact of the refining path," Qin Sang observed the Boshan burner, a realization dawning on him.</p><p>He sensed the subtle techniques; Master Gu was using secret arts to comprehend the artifact, her skill far exceeding that of Master Qi.  A true Daoist artifact refiner indeed.</p><p>The room quickly filled with swirling smoke.</p><p>Master Gu paid no mind, continuously applying various secret techniques, yet her anticipation and excitement gradually faded, replaced by disappointment.</p><p>Qin Sang, intently observing her, grew concerned.</p><p>Slowly ceasing her techniques, Master Gu set down the drum, and looked at Qin Sang.  "This is a damaged innate spiritual treasure!"</p><p>An innate spiritual treasure!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted.  So it was.</p><p>Assisting Master Qi in refinement had rapidly advanced Qin Sang's own skills; he had already suspected it was a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The challenge lay in its repair.  Numerous attempts yielded no response from the damaged drum, rendering it useless.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang heard Master Gu sigh softly, her expression full of regret.  "Alas, its spirit has perished."</p>
