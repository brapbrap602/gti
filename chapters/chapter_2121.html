<h1>Chapter 2111: Pseudo-Domain</h1><p>The Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles, confining heaven and earth!</p><p>Qin Sang was trapped within.</p><p>He couldn't help but recall the otherworldly expert he encountered years ago when rescuing Si Lu.</p><p>That person possessed the cultivation of the second stage of the Void Realm's later phase, a mere step away from Sainthood, the Integration Stage.  His true body was far beyond the horizon, yet he was still able to project his will across vast distances through some unknown method, carrying with it the crushing weight of heaven and earth, vividly demonstrating the disparity between Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang still remembered the feeling of being crushed by the heavens themselves.  He had to summon both his Dharma Body and Dharma Idol, exerting his full strength with the Sun Wheel Seal, to break through the pressure and escape the perilous situation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang experienced that feeling again, even more acutely and terrifyingly than before.</p><p>The golden shackles hung high, scattering golden light everywhere.</p><p>Wherever the golden light touched, it seemed to transform into the domain of the golden shackles, imprisoning even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. When Qin Sang attempted to manipulate the surrounding spiritual energy, he found it several times more difficult than before. Even the spiritual energy he had already mastered showed signs of being confined.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators battling each other could be compared to two powerful warriors in a tug-of-war, with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth being the rope between them.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang's opponent was like an unyielding wall. Not only could he not wrest control, but the opponent's power was encroaching upon him, stripping away his ability to command the spiritual energy, even threatening to imprison his true body within!</p><p>The white-robed man revealed a cold smile.</p><p>After a cultivator stepped into the Void Realm, the improvement in their cultivation primarily manifested in their ability to control the power of heaven and earth.  The first stage of the Void Realm allowed one to invoke the might of heaven and earth, and subsequently control its spiritual energy. Legend had it that after breaking through to Sainthood, one's body could transform into a part of heaven and earth, undergoing another tremendous metamorphosis!</p><p>Among all the races of the Great Thousand World, regardless of the specific name for this realm, there was a universally recognized term for this supernatural power—Domain.</p><p>Within one's Domain, the cultivator was the absolute master, able to manipulate everything at will.</p><p>Heaven and earth were them, and they were heaven and earth!</p><p>The Saint's Domain was profoundly mystical.  Even powerful figures like the Grand Offering only knew of its existence, not its inner workings.</p><p>It was said that after reaching the second stage of the Void Realm's later phase, some individuals, either through defying destiny or possessing exceptional talent, could grasp a sliver of the Domain's mysteries in advance, greatly benefiting their future breakthroughs.</p><p>Although what they comprehended was merely superficial, if they could grasp the essence of its application, their combat prowess would receive a tremendous boost. However, since it was not a true Domain, it could only be called a Pseudo-Domain.</p><p>Those who could grasp the Pseudo-Domain were all peak experts.</p><p>Before his departure, when the Grand Offering entrusted the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles to him, he had mentioned that this treasure could simulate a portion of the Pseudo-Domain's power. Its might was self-evident.</p><p>In his hands, its power would be significantly reduced, not comparable to the Grand Offering wielding it personally. However, if he faced someone like Eunuch Xia head-on, he could rely on this treasure to contend with them, ensuring his escape.</p><p>Using it against a mere early Void Refinement demon cultivator was more than enough!</p><p>Watching Qin Sang enveloped by the golden light, unable to move, the golden sun above his head losing its brilliance and gradually dimming, the white-robed man revealed a satisfied smile.  He casually formed a hand seal and directed it towards the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles.</p><p>The sky and sea merged into one, a dazzling expanse of gold, transforming into a golden domain of light.</p><p>Everything within this domain came to a standstill. The wind stopped, and the waves froze mid-air, neither rising nor falling, their surfaces seemingly coated in gold leaf.</p><p>A reef at the edge of the golden domain, fortunate enough to avoid the aftershocks of the battle, now became deathly silent, even the insects and beasts muted.</p><p>Qin Sang, at the very center of the golden domain, deeply experienced the formidable power of the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles.</p><p>The surrounding spiritual energy was receding from him. If this continued, he might ultimately have only himself to rely on. But how could a single person contend against heaven and earth?  Struggling would be futile; the outcome seemed predetermined.</p><p>For anyone else, the wisest course of action would be to break free from the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles at all costs before considering anything else.</p><p>At such a critical juncture, however, Qin Sang appeared somewhat distracted, his mind focused on the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity with the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles was because, after breaking through to the Void Refinement stage, he had been fortunate enough to come into contact with a true Domain through the *Purple Star Sword Canon* and Heavenly Crossing Senior.</p><p>The Domain was profoundly esoteric, and Qin Sang found it extremely difficult to comprehend, making little progress. However, it had greatly broadened his horizons. Thus, when the white-robed man unleashed the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles, Qin Sang immediately recognized the treasure's power.</p><p>If his Dharma Idol and Dharma Body were both present, combined with the Five Elements Crown, he wouldn't fear this treasure.  Unfortunately, only his Dharma Idol was here. Nevertheless, Qin Sang remained unfazed.  Connecting his mind with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, he commanded it to activate its new supernatural power—the Illusory Profound Divine Light.</p><p>A faint radiance emanated from his body, his figure appearing both real and illusory.  With a slight movement, resembling a swimming fish, he unexpectedly began to move within the golden domain, flickering to the edge in a single instant.</p><p>So this was the true wonder of the Illusory Profound Divine Light!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart surged with joy.  Just now, a sudden inspiration struck him, leading him to attempt this bold maneuver, and he had effortlessly escaped the golden domain.</p><p>This meant that, with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's assistance, late Void Refinement cultivators would no longer be able to suppress him with their realm.</p><p>Of course, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's cultivation was still too low. If it faced a true Domain, it would likely be ineffective.</p><p>But it was foreseeable that, as their cultivation continued to improve, one day, they might not be entirely helpless even against Integration Stage experts!</p><p>The Illusory Profound Divine Light brought Qin Sang joy, while the white-robed man felt shock and astonishment.</p><p>He couldn't understand how Qin Sang had accomplished this.  Logically, unless Qin Sang had already broken through to the late Void Refinement stage, he wouldn't have the ability to resist the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles.</p><p>To move so effortlessly, coming and going as he pleased, perhaps only an expert who had comprehended the Pseudo-Domain could achieve this.  For an early Void Refinement cultivator to grasp the Pseudo-Domain was simply too shocking; no one would believe it!</p><p>The white-robed man preferred to believe that Qin Sang had been forced to reveal his ultimate life-saving technique, one that couldn't be replicated.</p><p>But he wouldn't gamble his own life on this assumption, probing further.  The longer the delay, the more unfavorable the situation became for him.  The failure of the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles meant the white-robed man had lost his final opportunity. It was no longer possible for him to achieve his goal of slaying Qin Sang and retreating calmly.</p><p>Since that was the case, there was no benefit in staying.</p><p>The white-robed man was decisive. Seeing Qin Sang 'swim' out of the golden domain, he didn't bother investigating how it was done.  His hand seals instantly changed, his figure and the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles simultaneously turning illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and five-colored brilliance shimmered around him.</p><p>He had kept the Five Elements Crown on his person, which was why he dared to pursue so boldly.  The crown manifested, and a beam of Inverse Five Elements Divine Light shot out, striking the white-robed man squarely in the chest.</p><p>The Inverse Five Elements Divine Light was primarily for killing.  The white-robed man instantly annihilated, not even a trace of flesh and blood remaining.</p><p>The golden light receded like a tide, and the Heaven-Confining Golden Shackles vanished without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the spot where the white-robed man had disappeared, knowing that he had still managed to escape.</p><p>The white-robed man had only revealed three companion beasts in this battle.  The last one must have been lurking in the distance, allowing his true body to instantly shift and escape.</p><p>Among all the tribes of the otherworldly race, the Si You tribe could be considered one of the most difficult to kill. Back then, when Eunuch Xia and Si Lu were both seriously injured, the Quan Feng tribe gathered several experts to pursue them relentlessly.  They were besieged several times, yet managed to escape each time. In the end, it took Elder Quan to corner them, and even then, Qin Sang had exploited the opportunity.</p><p>Though his enemy had escaped, Qin Sang wasn't angered, nor did he give chase. He slowly closed his eyes, replaying the scene in his mind.</p><p>A moment later, ripples appeared on the sea surface, and a fierce wind arose. A shadow materialized in mid-air, coalescing into a human form—Qin Sang's Dharma Body.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sensed the anomaly at the same time his Dharma Body in the Green Ram Temple had mobilized.  His Dharma Body could utilize the Shifting Formation, its speed not much slower than his true body. However, Qin Sang hadn't chosen to have his Dharma Body and true body join forces to attack the white-robed man.</p><p>Si You tribe experts were incredibly difficult to kill. Although Qin Sang possessed the Sword from the Heart Sea technique, allowing him to lock onto an opponent and follow any thread to find their true body and kill them from afar, this technique was primarily used for finishing blows.  The white-robed man was so vigilant that if he sensed danger and chose not to engage Qin Sang, instantly shifting with his companion beast, the Sword from the Heart Sea could only wound him, not kill him.</p><p>Therefore, after arriving, the Dharma Body didn't join the battle, but instead searched the surroundings for the white-robed man's fourth companion beast. Unfortunately, it found nothing.</p><p>The Dharma Body returned empty-handed and, together with the true body, returned to the Western Lands.</p><p>Next, the Dharma Body returned to the Green Ram Temple alone, guarding the main altar, while Qin Sang's true body hurried to the Boundless Sea to meet Si Lu.</p><p>In case it was a diversionary tactic, Qin Sang had only sent a message to Si Lu to be on guard, not to come to his aid.</p><p>Boundless Sea.</p><p>Si Lu sat at the core formation altar. Sensing Qin Sang's arrival, he opened the restrictions, and Qin Sang entered the spiritual island, recounting the previous events to Si Lu.</p><p>After listening, Si Lu said with a grave expression, "This person should be Lu Qian, the foremost general under Lord Lu.  He possesses profound cultivation and exceptional courage, serving as Lord Lu's right-hand man. He is also highly regarded by the Lu family's Grand Offering."</p><p>Si Lu's current mood was complex.</p><p>Lu Qian personally acting as a spy indicated the Lu family's absolute confidence and determination.  He could finally be tied to Qin Sang's cause.</p><p>However, the enemy had come too quickly. The situation had suddenly become incredibly urgent, and he wasn't sure how confident Qin Sang was.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "This person is indeed audacious.  His identity exposed, instead of fleeing immediately, he actually attempted to kill this poor Daoist."</p><p>"Was Brother Qin injured?" Si Lu asked with concern.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang's strength was no less than Lu Qian's, but only his true body and Dharma Idol were stationed in the Western Lands.</p><p>"I wasn't injured, but I couldn't keep him either. He only managed to access information from a few branch altars before this poor Daoist discovered him.  I don't know how much else he managed to pry into. However, the Lu family surely won't let us build our formation altars smoothly. They should be sending troops to attack soon."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was grave as he mentally calculated the time, pondering if there were any other delaying tactics.</p><p>"If the Lu family attacks, we must discuss it with the Zhu Yan tribe. Otherwise, if the Zhu Yan tribe perceives it as an act of aggression, it won't be something that can be resolved with mere material gains. The Lu family definitely wouldn't dare provoke the Zhu Yan tribe.  When we visited Fellow Daoist Yuan Miao before, there wasn't a whisper of this, meaning they likely only recently made contact.  We still have time," Si Lu said, though his expression grew even more serious.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then shifted the topic, asking, "How is the refinement of your treasure progressing?"</p><p>The Lu family's army would likely be the first wave of enemies after the Thunder Altar was completed.</p><p>Every Si You tribe expert was proficient in life-saving techniques.</p><p>The opportunity to eliminate the Lu family's Grand Offering would only come once, during the first activation of the Thunder Altar. Qin Sang didn't want it to be in vain. Ideally, he would deter the lesser figures while also seizing significant benefits.</p><p>As it stood, the best outcome would be to eradicate the Lu family, helping Si Lu return to the Si You tribe and reclaim the throne!</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to prevent the Lu family's Grand Offering from escaping at the moment the Thunder Oath was unleashed.</p><p>The one who understood the Si You tribe's techniques best was none other than a member of the Si You tribe.  Si Lu had previously mentioned that King Yan and Eunuch Xia had left him a treasure capable of countering the Shifting technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, this treasure was extremely difficult to refine.  Even in King Yan's hands, after expending countless rare and precious materials, it remained incomplete.  Since stabilizing his foundation, Si Lu had been diligently refining this treasure, and it was now nearing completion.</p><p>"It's almost fully refined.  With the demon soldiers' assistance, the construction of the formation altars is on track. I'll devote myself entirely to refining this treasure from now on.  Once it's complete, I'll immediately send it to the Green Ram Temple," Si Lu said, understanding the importance of this treasure and not daring to slack off.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  This treasure held another significance for him. He wanted to use it to explore the mysteries of the Shifting technique and attempt to integrate the Sword from the Heart Sea technique into the Thunder Altar to see if it could break the Shifting technique.</p><p>If everything went smoothly, eliminating the Lu family's experts would become much easier.</p><p>After a brief exchange, Qin Sang bid farewell to Si Lu and returned to the Western Lands.</p><p>…</p><p>The Deep Sea.</p><p>Inside a cave within a submarine mountain peak lay a monstrous creature.</p><p>This monster was entirely white, its body soft as a cloud, sprawled on the ground, its features indiscernible.</p><p>No aura emanated from the monster's body. Only its occasional twitching revealed it to be a living being.</p><p>The cave was silent.</p><p>In the darkness, the monster suddenly rose from the ground, a large mouth and several round, bulging eyes appearing on its belly.</p><p>In the next moment, the monster's body stiffened, its form gradually shifting into a human silhouette—the white-robed man.</p><p>"Cough… cough…"</p><p>Violent coughs echoed through the cave.  The white-robed man clutched his chest, coughing up blood that instantly vaporized.</p><p>"How formidable!"</p><p>The white-robed man muttered darkly.</p><p>Just now, he had been focused on escaping and hadn't had time to discern what kind of supernatural power it was.  He hadn't expected to be nearly gravely injured by a mere graze from that divine light.</p><p>He had been too careless, underestimating this demon.</p><p>The white-robed man sighed inwardly. He didn't know where Si Lu had found such a helper, someone who clearly couldn't be viewed as an ordinary expert.</p><p>This investigation had ended abruptly, forced to retreat after only briefly exploring the Western Lands. He still didn't know what they were plotting there, or how many helpers they had.</p><p>However, knowing that Si Lu had such an expert by his side was enough to report back.</p><p>Calming his breath, the white-robed man carefully sensed the area outside the cave, ensuring there were no anomalies.  He left the cave, cautiously speeding away until he was certain there were no pursuers, before turning back towards the Sacred沐 Plain.</p><p>The Chang You Tribe's Sacred Lake.</p><p>Min Zhuo wasn't currently in the sacred hall, but was seated in meditation on a mountaintop by the Sacred Lake, seemingly awaiting someone.</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed something, opened his eyes, and gazed north.  A flash of light later, the white-robed man materialized.</p><p>Seeing the white-robed man, Min Zhuo's pupils contracted sharply.  He exclaimed in shock, "Your Excellency is injured?"</p><p>"It's nothing serious!"</p><p>The white-robed man waved his hand dismissively. "They do have a powerful expert.  Your previous defeat was not unjust.  But rest assured, Clan Leader Min, we will uphold our promise and help you reclaim your territory and seek justice!"</p>
