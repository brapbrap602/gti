<h1>Chapter 2008: Guest Elder</h1><p>The Yunlou buildings were arrayed, the foremost gatehouse displaying a plain wooden sign reading "Five Elements League." The sign was made of the most common type of spirit wood, avoiding any sense of oppression that might deter visitors.  This was in stark contrast to the Tongtian Pavilion, which Qin Sang had passed earlier.</p><p>All the way up to the twentieth heaven, the Five Elements League's entrance was constantly bustling with visitors, a testament to its popularity.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped into the Five Elements League, immediately greeted by a smiling attendant.</p><p>Before the attendant could speak, a young man hurried over, clearing his throat.  "You may leave. I will attend to this senior."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't made any effort to conceal his aura.  Even in the Jade Capital, cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage weren't commonplace; those at the Unity or Mahayana stages were extremely rare.</p><p>"Yes!"  The attendant responded promptly, bowing slightly and gracefully stepping aside, her smile unwavering as she moved to greet another guest.</p><p>"Senior, please."</p><p>The young man led Qin Sang to a quiet room, instructing servants to bring fragrant tea and spirit fruits.  His attentiveness was impeccable.</p><p>"May I ask your Daoist name, Senior?" the young man asked, bowing slightly.</p><p>"My surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Despite intending to use the Five Elements League to avoid notice, Qin Sang decided to use his real name. If his identity was revealed during his quest for the sword and he was forced to flee, the significance of using a real name or an alias would become irrelevant.  Using "Qin Sang" would allow his name to spread and be known to those he knew.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qin," the young man bowed again.  "What are your needs, Senior? The Five Elements League will do its utmost to fulfill them. Even if this branch is unable to, our headquarters are on the thirtieth heaven, and I can immediately seek assistance from the elders there."</p><p>The Five Elements League not only dealt in refining but also had branches throughout the eight great heavens, collecting spirit materials from across the land.  If you couldn't buy a refining material from them, you were unlikely to find it anywhere else.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately reveal his true intentions, producing a jade slip.  "Do you have these spirit materials?"</p><p>The young man took the slip, scanned it with his spiritual sense, and nodded. "We have all of them.  How much does Senior Qin require?  Also, several materials listed here are not normally sold to the public.  Please understand."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  "Normally? Which ones exactly?"</p><p>The jade slip listed materials he truly needed, mixed with others added to mislead, including some needed for constructing his Daoist altar.</p><p>The young man pointed them out, and among them was the Azure Trace Essence, causing Qin Sang to feel relieved about his large acquisition in the Azure Sky Cave.</p><p>"If you have these materials, why won't you sell them to me? Are you worried I can't afford them?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned displeasure, coldly snorting.</p><p>"Senior, please calm yourself," the young man bowed deeply, neither servile nor arrogant. "This is a rule established by our League Elders. I am a lowly employee with no authority to change it. If Senior Qin urgently needs these materials, I shall immediately request Elder Qi's assistance, who might be able to make an exception."</p><p>Qin Sang simply hummed. "Go ahead."</p><p>"I take my leave!"</p><p>The young man quickly left. Shortly after, the restrictions outside the room were activated.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and said solemnly, "Enter."</p><p>An elderly man with a radiant complexion and a genial expression entered the room.</p><p>"Qi Mu greets Daoist Qin.  If the younger ones were remiss in their duties, please forgive them, Daoist Qin."</p><p>In Leagues like the Five Elements League, refining skills were valued, but cultivation level was also a major factor.  This Elder Qi's cultivation was similar to his own, indicating that Nascent Soul cultivators could become elders in the League.  He wondered about the exact status of an "Elder."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, then returned the greeting, standing up. "Elder Qi is too kind.  Due to his limited authority, Attendant Zhao couldn't fulfill my request, so I had to trouble Elder Qi."</p><p>"I already know the situation and am here to explain," Elder Qi gestured for Qin Sang to sit, then sat opposite him.  "It's not a deliberate targeting of you.  The League does have this rule.  You surely understand the value of those materials. First, they are incredibly rare, and it's difficult for the League to collect them. Second, their quantity is limited. We must first supply the League's refining masters and satisfy some guests we can't offend before considering others.  Because of the League's reputation, we can't directly say we don't have them, and even if we did, nobody would believe us. So we have to be more tactful."</p><p>Elder Qi smiled wryly, his explanation frank and open.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, but he didn't believe the League truly wouldn't sell them.  After all, they were in business; it was simply a matter of the price not being high enough.</p><p>This level of transaction would undoubtedly require bartering. If Qin Sang offered materials of greater value, he doubted the League wouldn't be tempted.</p><p>However, such significantly over-priced transactions were unsustainable given Qin Sang's resources.  It wasn’t a long-term solution.</p><p>Tap…tap…</p><p>Qin Sang tapped her fingers lightly on the desk.  “Elder Qi means that as long as I become one of you, everything is negotiable?”</p><p>Elder Qi paused slightly, carefully observing Qin Sang. He spoke solemnly, “If you join the Five Elements League, you will naturally enjoy many benefits. However…”</p><p>“However, what? Does your esteemed League only recruit master artificers?” Qin Sang asked with a smile.</p><p>“Certainly not. Someone of your cultivation is highly sought after by our League. However, firstly, enjoying the benefits comes with working for the League. Can you accept that? Secondly, the art of refinement is the foundation of our League’s existence, so we naturally place more importance on master artificers within the League. This must be stated upfront to avoid resentment later,” Elder Qi explained frankly.</p><p>Cultivators at the Void Refinement stage are rare among independent cultivators, but not unheard of. But would such a rebellious person truly settle down within an organization?</p><p>Furthermore, in Baiyu City, there are far better options than the Five Elements League.</p><p>Elder Qi believed that Qin Sang was unlikely to join the Five Elements League for a few spiritual items.</p><p>Seeing Elder Qi’s attitude, Qin Sang guessed his thoughts and stopped probing. She replied truthfully, “To be frank, I’ve also immersed myself in the art of refinement for many years and personally crafted several spiritual treasures.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Elder Qi’s expression immediately changed.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, you truly are unassuming. I was blinded by my own poor judgment,” Elder Qi’s gaze was noticeably warmer than before.</p><p>“Forgive my presumption, but have you ever joined any other organization related to the art of refinement, such as the Celestial Tower?” Elder Qi first investigated Qin Sang’s background.  Worried about a misunderstanding, he quickly added, “Our League is an alliance, so most of our members hold multiple positions, including many sect leaders. However, disputes inevitably arise between different factions. Therefore, we need to clarify this beforehand so we can help you avoid any conflicts of interest, saving you from difficult situations.”</p><p>“I prefer to be independent. I heard your League has few restrictions, which is why I came to visit. I haven't been to the Celestial Tower yet,” Qin Sang shook her head.</p><p>Elder Qi’s eyes shone brighter and brighter.</p><p>A Void Refinement stage master artificer who is also independent – truly rare.  Recommending such a person to the League would be a great achievement.</p><p>Could she have just ascended from a smaller world? That would be fantastic! Such individuals are like blank slates in the Great World, and invariably possess exceptional talent and limitless potential; they must be secured!</p><p>He wasn’t worried that Qin Sang was a spy from another faction, plotting something.  Time reveals truth; the Five Elements League, due to its loose structure, has had countless ‘spies’ and has ample experience dealing with them.</p><p>Elder Qi said seriously, “Daoist Qin, you’ve come to the right place.  Throughout the entire Great Zhou, there’s no faction more suitable for you than our League. Joining us will not only grant you the benefits within the League, but also advantages outside.”</p><p>“Oh? What kind of advantages?” Qin Sang became interested.</p><p>“For example, the nine great teleportation arrays between the various heavenly states and Baiyu City each cost a considerable amount to use. As a member of our League, you will not only receive a discount but can also bring two disciples with you each time…”  Elder Qi’s example seemed a little mercenary, but it was a tangible benefit.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but reflect on her previous speculation about who controlled the nine great teleportation arrays.</p><p>The nine great teleportation arrays were akin to the lifeblood of humanity. Even the Zhou King couldn't control his own lifespan; no faction would tolerate him controlling the arrays.</p><p>It seemed that the human race's sects, families, and top powers all had a hand in them and could profit from them.</p><p>The existence of Great Zhou indicated that internal stability amongst humanity was generally maintained. Under such circumstances, different parties would check and balance each other while seeking allies and mutual benefit.  Leaning on a powerful faction provided additional conveniences, making the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.</p><p>“These are all benefits enjoyed by guest elders?” Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>“Correct! If Daoist Qin truly becomes a member of the Five Elements League, our League would be overjoyed,” Elder Qi said enthusiastically.</p><p>The Five Elements League initially was merely an alliance, but after years of development, its structure had changed. The League cultivates its own power, and its core members are mostly those raised within the League from a young age.</p><p>Others wishing to join must undergo stricter trials.</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied. “Enjoying so many benefits must come with responsibilities, right?”</p><p>“Indeed. Our League’s branches are spread across the eight heavenly states, and we have a constant stream of clients who request our refinement services.  Some commissions can only be reliably completed by master artificers.  Our League understands that you prioritize cultivation, but you must complete one commission every so often to fulfill your obligations to the League,” Elder Qi avoided explicitly stating what truly joining the League entailed.</p><p>Both understood that greater constraints would undoubtedly be imposed.  This was something Qin Sang couldn’t accept, at least not in the short term.  Being a guest elder would suffice for now.</p><p>Time is on our side; let's take our time.  Elder Qi didn't rush to recruit Qin Sang, nodding and saying, "Friend Qin, would you be willing to demonstrate your skills in artifact refinement? This will help me report to my superiors."</p><p>"How do I prove it?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Any method will do. I just need initial confirmation so the alliance can formulate a plan," Elder Qi replied.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then a thought struck him.</p><p>A chill filled the quiet room, suddenly illuminated by a flash of sword light.  A sword, cold as autumn frost, appeared between them—the Grey Warbler Sword!</p><p>"This sword is a replica of my soul-bound sword, connected to my spirit. I ask Elder Qi to assess it."</p><p>Qin Sang presented the sword.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword hummed, seeming to respond to its owner's words, yet also seeming reluctant to be judged.  Its resonant hum was filled with pride and spiritual vitality.</p><p>"Excellent sword!"</p><p>Elder Qi exclaimed, his years of experience allowing him to instantly recognize that the sword was undoubtedly crafted by Qin Sang.  It possessed a distinct difference from other spirit treasures.</p><p>"This spirit sword is sufficient proof of Friend Qin's abilities," Elder Qi said, rising to his feet. He formally returned the Grey Warbler Sword to Qin Sang.  "Please wait a moment, Friend Qin. I shall report this to the alliance."</p><p>"Please do," Qin Sang replied, seeing Elder Qi off and considering his next steps.</p><p>Planning ahead, Qin Sang needed to consider his future path, perhaps relying on the Daoist altar to further cultivate the Great Completion Killing Dao.  Once his identity was revealed, he would have no chance to gather spirit materials while fleeing, so he had to act now.</p><p>Unfortunately, the spirit materials required for the Daoist altar were vast. Even with the Five Elements Alliance's assistance, it would be difficult to gather them all. He would likely need his sword servants' help later.</p><p>While pondering this, Elder Qi returned.</p><p>While waiting for the Five Elements Alliance's response, Qin Sang and Elder Qi engaged in casual conversation.</p><p>Lacking knowledge of the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang feared revealing his ignorance, so he focused on discussing artifact refinement with Elder Qi.</p><p>Baiyu City was the center of the Great Thousand human race, a place where information about various Daoist traditions circulated. Even if Elder Qi hadn't seen everything firsthand, his knowledge surpassed Qin Sang's.</p><p>After their exchange, Qin Sang could only marvel at the vastness and depth of artifact refinement in the Great Thousand World.  He encountered many techniques and methods he'd never heard of, their mysteries profound.</p><p>"I've heard of an artifact technique where a soul is placed within an artifact, transforming into a spirit being and achieving rebirth. Is that true?" Qin Sang asked casually.</p><p>"Legend speaks of such a technique, but those who claim to possess it are all charlatans, preying on the desperate. Their behavior is despicable," Elder Qi scoffed. "Even if such a miraculous technique exists, only unparalleled masters would be capable of wielding it."</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if the Five Elements Alliance possessed such a master.</p><p>He didn't ask the question. Even if such a master existed, Qin Sang couldn't afford to enlist their aid, and the Cloud Wanderer Sword involved too much risk to reveal.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang learned from Elder Qi that, besides crafting artifacts for clients, there were other ways to contribute to the Five Elements Alliance.  Greater contributions brought greater rewards, such as voluntarily offering treasures.</p><p>This was no secret; Elder Qi directly gave Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Upon inspecting the jade slip, Qin Sang was overwhelmed by a dazzling array of names.</p><p>Too many heaven-grade spirit materials Qin Sang had never heard of—some only existed in legends or were briefly mentioned in ancient texts, then vanished without a trace. Even the Five Elements Alliance wasn't certain of their existence.</p><p>Ten Divine Trees were listed, and Qin Sang made a curious discovery.</p><p>Among them, the Interdimensional Blood Sandalwood was ranked first, even above the Soul-Nurturing Wood.</p><p>"Legend says the Blood-Defiling Radiance of the Interdimensional Blood Sandalwood can defile magical artifacts, weakening spirit treasures.  Why is it so highly valued?" Qin Sang asked, pointing to the Interdimensional Blood Sandalwood.</p><p>This question further convinced Elder Qi that Qin Sang didn't hail from a major artifact refinement sect.  "Friend Qin, you don't know. Legend says that through a special secret technique, the Blood-Defiling Radiance can obscure the spirituality of a spirit treasure, making it easier to subdue through daily refinement. It also has a certain effect on the artifact spirit.  It can be said to be the most convenient secret technique in the world for taming artifact spirits."</p>
