<h1>Chapter 1240: The Legacy of the Dao</h1><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>Gong Liangyu was well aware of his unique status. Unlike other Golden Core cultivators, he was more likely to be targeted, so he deliberately delayed his departure by half an hour to avoid prying eyes. Yet, he was still being followed.</p><p>The pursuer no longer concealed their aura, revealing themselves to be a Nascent Soul Ancestor. Only a Nascent Soul cultivator could have tailed him for so long without him noticing.</p><p>Gong Liangyu was shocked. He no longer cared about the Blood Spirit Herb and hastily summoned his Nascent Soul puppet to protect himself. The Blood Spirit Herb was an illusion, and a Nascent Soul cultivator was following him... These strange occurrences sent chills down his spine. Unknowingly, he might have already fallen into a trap.</p><p>At that moment, the Nascent Soul cultivator charged forward without any attempt to hide their presence.</p><p>A radiant treasure light, resembling a celebratory cloud, hovered above Dongyang Bo's head. The Diamond Ring emitted circular ripples, repelling the blood shadows.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo!"</p><p>Gong Liangyu's pupils dilated as he exclaimed in shock.</p><p>In an instant, various Nascent Soul figures flashed through his mind—demonic cultivators from the Cold Domain, members of the Heavenly Alliance, and spies from the Sin Abyss. He had never expected Dongyang Bo to be the one behind this.</p><p>When his senior brother, Iron Crown Master, was in charge of the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace, they had already formed an alliance with Mount Shaohua, collectively known as the Eight Righteous Sects. Although there were occasional frictions between the disciples of the two factions, it never affected the overall situation.</p><p>After Iron Crown Master perished in the Purple Palace, Gong Liangyu succeeded him. Although he harbored some wariness toward Dongyang Bo, he had no intention of disrupting the relationship.</p><p>The saying goes, "A man may not intend to harm a tiger, but the tiger may still harbor ill will." Dongyang Bo had actually targeted him!</p><p>Gong Liangyu was not naive enough to believe that Dongyang Bo's appearance here was a mere coincidence. But he had too many questions in his mind.</p><p>At that moment, Dongyang Bo unleashed the full power of his Diamond Ring, charging straight at Gong Liangyu. He rampaged through the blood shadows, the Diamond Ring releasing waves of ring-shaped energy that repelled the blood shadows, preventing them from getting close. His movements were far more graceful than those of the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Dongyang Bo made no attempt to hide his intentions. Ignoring Gong Liangyu's look of confusion and fury, he stared intently at the Nascent Soul puppet that Gong Liangyu had summoned for protection, repeatedly praising it. "No wonder the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace has flourished for so long, its legacy unbroken! Truly, the famed Nascent Soul puppet lives up to its reputation. With this puppet, the legacy of the Dao can be preserved for generations. When I descend to the underworld and meet my master, I will have something to show for my efforts!"</p><p>Hearing this, Gong Liangyu suddenly understood. The old man's target was not something else—it was the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace's treasured Nascent Soul puppet!</p><p>This realization filled Gong Liangyu with even greater dread.</p><p>When he first saw Dongyang Bo, his immediate thought was that the old man had somehow learned of the Blood Spirit Herb and had come to compete with him for it. Although Dongyang Bo himself had no use for the Blood Spirit Herb, he had countless disciples, none of whom had reached the Nascent Soul stage. It was not surprising that he coveted the herb.</p><p>As for the Nascent Soul puppet capturing the illusion of the Blood Spirit Herb, it was likely a natural defense mechanism of the herb after it matured. The true herb might be nearby.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao values life, and there are countless rare flowers and herbs in the world, many of which possess similar abilities. It was normal that little was known about the Blood Spirit Herb, and there were no records of it.</p><p>Thus, although Gong Liangyu was alarmed, he believed that with the Nascent Soul puppet and the various life-preserving techniques passed down by his sect, even if he couldn't defeat Dongyang Bo, he could still escape.</p><p>At worst, he could retreat to his mountain and seal it off, finding another path to break through. The wheel of fate would turn, and there would come a day when he could seek revenge.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, as a senior, had taken the initiative to seize treasures. In such a situation, would he dare to lead an army to attack the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace?</p><p>What Gong Liangyu hadn't anticipated was that Dongyang Bo's target was not the Blood Spirit Herb but the Nascent Soul puppet. It seemed as though Dongyang Bo had long anticipated that Gong Liangyu would bring the puppet out!</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet was no secret among people like Dongyang Bo. In fact, there were rumors that the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace had deliberately spread the idea that the puppet could not leave the mountain, to prevent others from coveting it.</p><p>Did this not mean that every step Gong Liangyu had taken since deciding to come to the Blood Lake had been part of Dongyang Bo's plan?</p><p>The news of the Blood Spirit Herb...</p><p>The true flaw of the Nascent Soul puppet...</p><p>And the fact that Gong Liangyu possessed the Spirit-Calming Jade, which could resist the puppet's backlash and allow him to control it to search for treasures—Dongyang Bo knew all of this, which was why he had set up this trap.</p><p>Gong Liangyu felt as though he had been plunged into an icy abyss, his entire body chilled to the bone.</p><p>His mind buzzed, a tangled mess of thoughts. He began to doubt himself, wondering how many times Dongyang Bo had schemed against him, both openly and covertly, since he took over the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace.</p><p>Perhaps it had started even earlier!</p><p>His senior brother, Iron Crown Master, had the potential to reach the Nascent Soul stage, but the sect had suddenly faced a calamity, forcing him to use the Nascent Soul puppet and cutting off his path to advancement. Was Dongyang Bo behind this? Was his death in the Purple Palace truly a natural one?</p><p>Not long after Gong Liangyu formed his Golden Core, he had encountered an accident that left him with a lingering injury, causing him to fail repeatedly in his attempts to reach the Nascent Soul stage. It was only in recent years that he had found a spiritual herb to heal his wounds.</p><p>Was that attack truly an accident?</p><p>At this moment, Gong Liangyu was filled with fear toward Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Dongyang Bo turned his gaze to Gong Liangyu and said indifferently, "My disciples are mediocre, and none are fit to carry on the legacy. I had no choice but to resort to this. I must trouble you, fellow Daoist."</p><p>Gong Liangyu gritted his teeth, still wanting to confirm some things. "That jade scroll, and the Spirit-Calming Jade..."</p><p>"Indeed, it was me," Dongyang Bo nodded slightly. "The jade scroll is genuine, but the senior who discovered it found the Blood-Boiling Evil Flower, which I have already harvested. I merely changed its name. As for the Spirit-Calming Jade, I originally intended to leave it for my incompetent disciples to help them overcome their inner demons. Unfortunately, none of them were worthy, so I arranged for you to 'stumble upon' it..."</p><p>As he spoke of his schemes, Dongyang Bo's face showed little joy, for this was indeed a last resort.</p><p>His plans ran deep. He had long begun laying the groundwork against the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace, uncovering the secrets of the Nascent Soul puppet and painstakingly acquiring the Spirit-Calming Jade.</p><p>However, unless absolutely necessary, he did not wish to forcibly seize the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Firstly, he was well aware of the puppet's flaws. Not only was the cost of controlling it immense, but as the number of soul shadows within it increased, it would eventually lose control and devour its master. If no one could suppress it at that time, it would bring disaster to the sect.</p><p>Secondly, after years of effort, the Upper Yuan Tranquil Palace had become increasingly dependent on Mount Shaohua, and it could still serve as a valuable ally in the future.</p><p>The prerequisite, however, was that Mount Shaohua could produce another Nascent Soul cultivator to inherit the legacy.</p><p>Otherwise, with decline imminent, what future was there to speak of?</p><p>What embarrassed Dongyang Bo was that despite his years of careful planning, none of his disciples had managed to form a Nascent Soul. While he could assist them in forming Golden Cores, forming a Nascent Soul was the greatest hurdle for cultivators, and even he was powerless to help. He could only sigh in secret.</p><p>The jade scroll Gong Liangyu mentioned was a relic left by a senior who had once entered the Blood Lake. It contained the senior's observations and experiences within the lake.</p><p>The Blood Lake had been sealed for many years and had only recently reopened. Gong Liangyu would not have been overly cautious, and the records in the scroll were genuine, impossible for outsiders to forge.</p><p>After obtaining the scroll, Dongyang Bo changed the name of the spiritual herb and arranged for Gong Liangyu to receive it.</p><p>Nine parts truth, one part deception—it was enough to deceive Gong Liangyu.</p>
