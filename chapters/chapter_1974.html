<h1>Chapter 1965: A Joke</h1><p>Guanyang Mountain, home of the Baili Clan.</p><p>A renowned immortal cultivation family in the Yan region.</p><p>For centuries, the family's power grew steadily, even producing two Yuan Ying cultivators within two hundred years—a remarkable feat.</p><p>Three Yuan Ying ancestors held sway, though all were only at the early Yuan Ying stage.  Even so, among immortal cultivation families, they were a unique force.</p><p>Yet, this powerful hegemon was attacked, its mountain gate besieged.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu stopped in the distance, gazing at Guanyang Mountain.  A turbulent scene unfolded before him; the fluctuations of spiritual energy were clearly visible.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Sha Jia Yu felt the violent tremors emanating from Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>Varied colored lights burst from the mountain, reflecting against the dark clouds, creating a spectacle of colored clouds.</p><p>This was the phenomenon produced by the collision of spells and magical artifacts.</p><p>Most striking among these displays were eight pillars of crimson fire, forming the Baili Clan’s protective mountain formation.</p><p>These fire pillars, nearly a hundred meters tall, stood at eight points around Guanyang Mountain. A fire dragon coiled around each pillar.</p><p>The fire dragons were fiercely powerful, clawing and gnashing, moving like living creatures within the flames. Every so often, they would spew a torrent of fire into the sky.</p><p>The flames spread in the air, coalescing into a sea of fire that enveloped Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>But, under the fierce external assault, layers of the fire sea were instantly dispelled.</p><p>The flame barrier was weakening at a visible rate.</p><p>Once the fire sea was broken, the Baili Clan's protective formation would collapse, exposing their mountain gate and the entire clan to the enemy!</p><p>“The Locking煞 Blade of the Qisha Sect!”</p><p>“The Lion's Roar Sword of Dongjian Mountain!”</p><p>“The Yin Luo Nine Spirit Banner of the Kuang Family…”</p><p>“Elder Qi's Di Yuan Thunder Drum!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sha Jia Yu watched, increasingly shocked.</p><p>The Qisha Sect, Dongjian Mountain, the Kuang Family…</p><p>These were all prominent clans and sects near Yan, some rivaling the Baili Clan at its height.</p><p>Elder Qi and others were well-known powerful independent cultivators.</p><p>What heinous act had the Baili Clan committed to provoke a joint attack by immortal cultivation sects, families, and powerful independent cultivators?</p><p>The Baili Clan, facing so many powerful enemies, was hopelessly outnumbered. Even if Bai Li Qingkong hadn't died at his hands, the outcome wouldn't change.</p><p>The area around Guanyang Mountain was completely sealed off. Some had even deployed a larger formation to prevent anyone from escaping—a clear intent to annihilate the Baili Clan.</p><p>The Baili Clan's situation was even more desperate than the Sha family’s had been.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu couldn't imagine how the Baili Clan could possibly escape.</p><p>Seeing his enemy's imminent destruction, Sha Jia Yu felt no joy, only complexity in his eyes.</p><p>At that moment, a deafening roar erupted from Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>A beam of azure light pierced the clouds.</p><p>Cultivators floating above Guanyang Mountain scrambled to evade it.</p><p>The azure light descended from the heavens.</p><p>Instantly, the mountains were bathed in a brilliant green light.</p><p>The light, like a sword, fell with the speed of thunder, striking the main peak of Guanyang Mountain, the heart of the eight fire pillars.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A fiery storm raged.</p><p>Flames soared a thousand meters high, turning the sky crimson.</p><p>The timing of this azure light was incredibly precise, arriving just before the fire dragons spewed their fire, at the fire sea's weakest point.</p><p>With this astonishing display, Guanyang Mountain's protective formation became utterly fragile.</p><p>In this crisis, figures flew out from beneath the fire pillars, encircling them and frantically pouring their spiritual energy into the formation.</p><p>Their expressions varied—some were numb, some desperate, some filled with rage, but their efforts were in vain.</p><p>“Bai Li Yuan Ying, come out! Are you going to cower until you die? Today is the day of your clan's annihilation! Hahaha…”</p><p>Someone laughed cruelly, his laughter filled with malicious glee, clearly bearing a grudge against the Baili Clan.</p><p>Bai Li Yuan Ying was the current head of the Baili Clan, a man of great talent and ambition. He skillfully navigated the world of immortal cultivation, playing a major role in the clan's rise to prominence. The destruction of the Sha family was his handiwork.</p><p>Most merely watched Guanyang Mountain in silence, offering no taunts. Some showed pity in their eyes, but could only sigh inwardly, their hearts unmoved by the merciless slaughter.</p><p>The cruel laughter finally provoked Bai Li Yuan Ying’s appearance.</p><p>From the main peak of Guanyang Mountain, a white jade hall opened its doors, revealing an elderly man.</p><p>His hair was silver, but his face showed no signs of age.</p><p>Faced with this situation, he remained calm, standing straight, looking up at the sky, and said slowly, "Wherein has my百里 clan offended you, esteemed colleagues? If our crime warrants annihilation, I, an old man, will die without complaint! Otherwise, shouldn't you give me an explanation?"</p><p>Hearing this, the man who had been laughing added more mockery and amusement to his laughter.</p><p>"Old Ghost百里, you are cunning and deceitful. Don't you understand the will of the people? Think about all the evil deeds your百里 clan has done!"</p><p>百里 Yuanying disdained to respond to him. Seeing the others remain silent, he turned to a familiar face.</p><p>"Sect Master Gu, 156 years ago, a true disciple of the Qisha Sect fought with a junior member of my clan. If I remember correctly, my junior was ambushed, resulting in one death and one injury. I only made the culprit cripple himself and the accomplice bow three times before the grave, then dropped the matter to save face for both of us. Sect Master Gu, have you harbored resentment all this time?"</p><p>On the west side of Guanyang Mountain, a burly man with a stern face stood atop the mountain.</p><p>Upon hearing this, his expression stiffened slightly, avoiding百里 Yuanying's gaze, and he offered no reply.</p><p>Seeing this,百里 Yuanying turned to a woman.</p><p>"Daoist Kuang, years ago, my third brother wronged you. I confined him to solitary confinement for a hundred years, forever barring him from entering a thousand-li radius of the Kuang family. I wrote off the clan members you killed or injured in your rage. Since then, my百里 clan has actively avoided you. My third brother failed in his attempt to reach the Yuan Ying stage and has long since perished. Daoist Kuang, can you still not let go?"</p><p>The woman, elegant and graceful, looked only about forty, yet was a contemporary of百里 Yuanying.</p><p>She sneered coldly, "Don't mention those past grievances. A little youthful indiscretion; I wouldn't hold a grudge for so long!"</p><p>"Then there must be another reason."</p><p>百里 Yuanying's eyes flashed. "Though I have been in seclusion for many years, I am well-informed about important clan matters. Which unworthy child offended the Kuang family and dared to hide it from me!"</p><p>Murderous intent filled his eyes as he scanned all his clansmen.</p><p>The cultivators outside the mountain felt a chill run down their spines upon meeting his gaze.</p><p>No one doubted that if百里 Yuanying found the culprit, he would be executed on the spot.</p><p>Still, there was no response.</p><p>百里 Yuanying then looked towards a thundercloud outside the mountain.  Drums echoed from within the cloud, and a large drum was vaguely visible, with an old man seated upon it.</p><p>百里 Yuanying said in a deep voice, "Elder Qi…"</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>Elder Qi sighed, "Brother百里, even as a solitary cultivator, I understand the difficulties of managing a family, and I respect your dedication to the百里 clan. But Brother百里, don't you understand? This world is no longer a time for balancing acts! The cultivation world has changed, and Brother百里, you’ve been rather slow to realize it…"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>百里 Yuanying's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>For the past three years, the百里 clan has been relentlessly investigating the truth behind百里 Qingkong's death. Had they overlooked something?</p><p>"My master and your ancestor were once adversaries, then friends. I know how the百里 clan rose to prominence step by step.</p><p>"You skillfully took advantage of every upheaval in the cultivation world. Publicly, you remained neutral, while secretly you reaped the rewards and accumulated strength.</p><p>"Each such opportunity brought a leap in the clan's power.  Coupled with the emergence of numerous outstanding talents within the clan, you enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity.</p><p>"Even when others investigated and discovered clues, the百里 clan's strength prevented them from retaliating, forcing them to endure.</p><p>"With Brother百里’s sharp mind, you must have already sensed the undercurrents and the impending chaos in the cultivation world.</p><p>"This time, the百里 clan, like always, aimed to remain neutral, observing the situation and preparing to act at the opportune moment.</p><p>"However, Brother百里, did you not consider that everyone has long been wary of the百里 clan, and no longer willing to tolerate you?</p><p>"More importantly, someone does not allow neutrality!"</p><p>Elder Qi, out of some concern, transmitted the last few sentences using a secret technique, not daring to speak them aloud.</p><p>At least, it let百里 Yuanying know how they died.</p><p>Undeniably, the successive heads of the百里 clan were all outstanding figures, masters of strategy and political maneuvering.</p><p>Another opportunity, a Yuan Ying cultivator of the mid or late stage, and the百里 clan would become a top-tier family.</p><p>Now, that opportunity had arrived.</p><p>百里 Yuanying had acted accordingly. If not for the sudden death of百里 Qingkong, the entire clan would have already been making their moves.</p><p>The百里 clan was already a powerful force, capable of balancing multiple factions.</p><p>Logically, no one wanted to offend the百里 clan, pushing them into the enemy camp. Instead, they would strive to win them over.</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons, even knowing the百里 clan's intentions, they would choose to tolerate them.</p><p>But no one could have anticipated that this time was unlike any previous upheaval in the cultivation world.</p><p>Neither the百里 clan nor any other cultivation sects, families, or solitary cultivators were anything more than grains of sand before the mighty current.</p><p>In the face of such a powerful force, no one could be the fisherman.  Self-preservation was the only hope.</p><p>Either be swept along, or be crushed!</p><p>Bai Li Yuan Ying didn't realize this, bringing ruin upon himself and his family.  A target was needed to make an example, and the Bai Li clan was chosen, with surprising unanimity. No one can always be the winner.  Ups and downs are common in the cultivation world; the Bai Li clan was simply unlucky. Two hundred years of prosperity, like a raging fire, a glorious bloom. One miscalculation, and it's all over!</p><p>These words struck Bai Li Yuan Ying's mind like lightning. Suddenly, he understood.  Bai Li Yuan Ying, shrewd and decisive, immediately bowed deeply and shouted, "I will lead the Bai Li clan to fight for our benefactor!  We will die to the last man, woman, and child!  I beg you, Elder Qi, to intercede for our family!"</p><p>"Heh heh…" The man who had been laughing loudly, scoffed again.</p><p>After a moment, Bai Li Yuan Ying received only a sigh.  "Too late."  No further response.</p><p>Dark clouds blotted out the sun, pressing ever lower. The mountain protection array faced a more ferocious attack.  Thunder and fire, rain, snow, wind, and frost… Outside Guan Yang Mountain, the sky was filled with terrifying omens, intermingled with flashing swords, and the power of magical artifacts.  A storm that began in Luo Hun Abyss and Yun Du Mountain was sweeping across the cultivation world, reaching Guan Yang Mountain.  The once renowned Guan Yang Mountain seemed so small, so weak.</p><p>*Boom!* A deafening thunderclap shook the heavens. A large hole was finally blasted through the sea of fire, and the flames surged outwards. Even with Bai Li Yuan Ying leading his people in desperate resistance, they couldn’t contain the flames, unable to repair the breach. In an instant, dozens of attacks poured through the opening. Screams erupted from Guan Yang Mountain; over a dozen clan members fell dead. Eight fire dragons detached from their pillars, sacrificing themselves to fill the gap, but it only bought them a short delay.</p><p>*Crack!* The fire pillar in the south suddenly broke. The fire dragon let out a mournful cry and dissipated. This was a devastating blow to the mountain protection array; even with the Bai Li clan's full efforts, repair was impossible.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!* Thunder, fire, and lightning rained down on the south slopes of Guan Yang Mountain.  The once beautiful mountain palaces and scenery were instantly destroyed, and the Bai Li clan members there perished.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!* One fiery dragon pillar after another shattered. The Bai Li clan's annihilation was inevitable, beyond redemption!</p><p>"Aaah!" Bai Li Yuan Ying roared to the heavens, his hair standing on end, like a madman.  He was unwilling to accept it.  Generations of ancestors had poured their hearts and souls into building the Bai Li clan, only to have it destroyed under his watch. From now on, the Bai Li clan would cease to exist in this part of the cultivation world! How could he face his ancestors and his people in the afterlife?  He still didn't even know who had ordered the extermination of his entire clan!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Guan Yang Mountain, Sha Jia Yu stood motionless, watching the Bai Li clan's destruction.</p><p>"Haha…" "Hahahahaha!" "HAHAHAHAHAHA!"  Sha Jia Yu suddenly burst into laughter, laughing so hard he cried. He laughed at the destruction of his enemy, at Bai Li Yuan Ying's cunning that ultimately led to his downfall. He laughed at himself, burdened by revenge for two hundred years, focused solely on retribution.  He had reunited with his old love, only to use her for revenge, self-mutilating and sacrificing his lifespan to cultivate a demonic art, finally seeing hope for revenge, only to have his enemy destroyed in such a ridiculous way.  No matter what he did, the Bai Li clan was going to be destroyed. What was the point of his two hundred years of hatred? Was his life just a joke?</p><p>"HAHAHAHA!" Sha Jia Yu laughed wildly, then slumped to the ground, beating his fists against the earth, unable to stop.  His laughter became increasingly mournful. Finally, he stopped, staring blankly at Guan Yang Mountain, now reduced to rubble.</p><p>After destroying the Bai Li clan, the cultivators began to retreat. Sha Jia Yu's eyes flickered, noticing that they weren't retreating together, but in two distinct groups.  He suddenly remembered that during the attack on Guan Yang Mountain, these people hadn't been united, but rather wary of each other.</p><p>"Why did they level Guan Yang Mountain?" Sha Jia Yu wondered.</p><p>Regaining his composure, he watched the two groups depart, then vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Months later, Sha Jia Yu, having traveled throughout the various kingdoms, returned to Yan Kingdom.  Weathered and unkempt, no one would have guessed he was a Yuan Ying cultivator.  He was much more apathetic than before.  Unknowingly, he reached the capital city. A flicker of expression crossed his face, his eyes regaining some light.  He entered the city and went to Qing Yang Tea House by Jade Waist Lake.</p>
