<h1>Chapter 1096: Confrontation</h1><p>"With such diluted bloodline, it's impossible to awaken the divine abilities of the Vermilion Bird Clan. In ancient times, you wouldn't even be recognized as a descendant of the Vermilion Bird," Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>During his conversation with Yuan Zhu, he had learned some of the rules and customs of the demon race. Without the bloodline of the Vermilion Bird, it would be extremely difficult to obtain the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird through normal means. The Demon Banner could suppress the Nine Nether Demon Fire, but the Southern Brightness Fire had yet to be subdued by him. Using the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique to draw the Southern Brightness Fire into his body and refine the lotus seed would be akin to setting himself ablaze. Moreover, back at Yitian Peak, he had been forced by circumstances to hastily refine the lotus seed with demon fire. He hadn't yet fully comprehended the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique and dared not act recklessly.</p><p>"The Black Iron Pillar suppresses the Nine Nether Demon Fire. The Ancestor of Kuiyin used the Black Iron Pillar as a foundation to forge the Demon Banner and capture the demon fire. The Green Copper Block can also suppress the Southern Brightness Fire, and it should still be with Yunyouzi. Could I use a similar method to forcibly seize the Southern Brightness Fire and the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird?" Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but he felt that his knowledge of artifact forging was too shallow, leaving him with no clear direction for now.</p><p>After staying briefly at the Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang retraced his steps back to the foot of the mountain. It wasn't yet time for the Purple Palace to close. However, back when Qin Sang's cultivation was still weak, he hadn't been able to uncover the secrets of the Purple Palace and thus didn't know much about it. The remaining time wasn't enough for him to explore it thoroughly. Realizing that staying here would yield little gain, Qin Sang decided to leave the Purple Palace now.</p><p>The journey back wouldn't be peaceful. Some areas of the outer palace were even more dangerous than the inner palace. Like the Seven Slaughter Palace, the Purple Palace was divided into inner and outer sections, connected only by the Path of Heart Refinement. The last time, when Elder Dongyang led them into the inner palace, they had taken this very path.</p><p>At the end of the Path of Heart Refinement, there had originally been a stone pagoda. However, the latter half of the path had been damaged, preventing anyone from reaching the pagoda. The moment they entered the inner palace, they were scattered by the chaotic forces within the sea of clouds, landing in random locations within the inner palace.</p><p>The way out, however, was simple. Find the stone pagoda, enter it, and you would be teleported back to the entrance of the Path of Heart Refinement, in front of the Eight Trigrams Jade Wall.</p><p>Qin Sang had already donned his mask and swiftly made his way toward the edge of the inner palace. Bai accompanied him. As they passed the immortal city that had been obliterated by a palm strike and various other immortal realms, Bai's gaze was deeply captivated, and he remained silent for a long time.</p><p>Before long, they reached the edge and saw countless fragments of land outside. Qin Sang continued to fly outward, leaping over one land fragment after another. As he approached the sea of clouds, an unexpected sight came into view, causing his expression to change.</p><p>The last time he was here, the entire inner palace of the Purple Palace had been shrouded in the sea of clouds. But now, the scene was different. Directly ahead of Qin Sang, where the stone pagoda was located—the place closest to the immortal restrictions of the Purple Palace's inner palace—the sea of clouds had been torn apart! Within the vast sea of clouds, clear fissures were visible. The clouds couldn't gather there, and as they continuously flowed in, they dissipated through the fissures.</p><p>The only explanation for the fissures in the sea of clouds was that the immortal restrictions of the Purple Palace's inner palace had been compromised!</p><p>"Is it because the power of the immortal restrictions is waning, unable to maintain the integrity of the sea of clouds, or has something happened to the Purple Palace, causing the immortal restrictions to be damaged?" Qin Sang stood on a land fragment, gazing at the immortal restrictions, frowning in deep thought.</p><p>After he had teleported away, something must have happened to the Purple Palace, resulting in this state. He had just arrived and knew nothing. After pondering for a moment, he instructed Bai to retreat into the Corpse Puppet Bag while he concealed his presence and cautiously approached the sea of clouds.</p><p>With the immortal restrictions compromised, the fissures served as passages between the inner and outer areas. However, to be safe, it was still best to leave via the stone platform. The stone pagoda, located within the sea of clouds, was protected by powerful ancient restrictions, its surface flickering with runes.</p><p>Qin Sang found the stone pagoda without much effort. However, he then noticed something at the end of one of the fissures that made him freeze in place.</p><p>The thin clouds within the fissure couldn't hide the sinister aura at its end. With the help of his Heavenly Eye ability, he could make out the outline of half a massive cave. Qin Sang remembered that in front of the Eight Trigrams Jade Wall at the entrance of the Path of Heart Refinement, there had been a massive demonic cave over a hundred zhang in diameter and bottomless. The cave was filled with a chilling demonic aura, as if it connected to the underworld. Once, a Nascent Soul expert had risked their life to jump into the cave, but even by the time the Purple Palace closed, they hadn't been able to discover what lay at its end.</p><p>If Qin Sang wasn't mistaken, the cave at the end of the sea of clouds was that very demonic cave! At this moment, at the edge of the cave, stood several zhang-high banners, forming a grand formation. Black mist churned, covering nearly half of the cave. Within the mist, shadowy figures seemed to appear.</p><p>He was certain that the last time he was here, there had been no such formation around the demonic cave!</p><p>"What are these people doing, setting up a formation at the edge of the demonic cave instead of entering the inner palace?" Qin Sang stared at the cave, his thoughts racing. Seeing the formation and the figures within, he felt an overwhelming sense of danger. If he were to teleport over now, he would likely be caught by them, and the consequences would be dire.</p><p>"Look at the fissure next to it," Bai's voice transmitted into his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to another fissure and was surprised to find another formation there, seemingly not far from the demonic cave. Two groups of cultivators were facing off against each other!</p><p>"Has the Cold Domain and the Heavenly Alliance split again? Or..." Qin Sang recalled the time they had been ambushed by the Sin Abyss, "Could this be related to the Sin Abyss?"</p><p>"We can't take the stone pagoda. We'll have to leave through another route!" Qin Sang made up his mind. He had to risk passing through one of the fissures in the sea of clouds. Whoever these people were, he didn't want to get involved. He would rather take the risk and find another way out.</p><p>Fortunately, there were many fissures in the sea of clouds. Qin Sang cautiously retreated and flew around the sea of clouds for a while, finding a fissure far from the stone pagoda. The end of this fissure was a great distance from the demonic cave.</p><p>After observing for some time and testing the area a few times, Qin Sang confirmed that the other side of this fissure was safe. He activated his Heavenly Demon Transformation, summoned the Ebony Sword and other treasures, and then swiftly entered the fissure.</p><p>Although the sea of clouds had been torn apart, remnants of the immortal restrictions' power still lingered within the fissures, creating chaos. Fortunately, it wasn't beyond what Qin Sang could handle. Enduring the residual waves of the immortal restrictions, he fully activated his protective treasures and safely passed through the restrictions, landing on the ground.</p><p>From here, he could vaguely see the rolling black mist in the direction of the demonic cave. Qin Sang didn't dare to stay. He immediately hid in the shadows and moved away from the area. After ensuring that no one was following him, he stopped on a black stone mountain.</p><p>He glanced back at the demonic cave and then swiftly headed toward the exit of the outer palace. Whatever was about to happen, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>As he walked the path back, familiar scenes stirred up memories. The last time, when Elder Dongyang had led them, he hadn't noticed, but now, traveling alone through the outer palace, he realized just how dangerous it truly was. Even with his strength, he had to remain vigilant.</p><p>After passing through several perilous areas, Qin Sang saw a bloody aura in the distance, along with the outline of an altar within it. He didn't stop and continued flying forward. Ahead, ghostly mist filled the air—it was the Immortal Tomb!</p>
