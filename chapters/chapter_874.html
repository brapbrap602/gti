<h1>Chapter 866: Enmity</h1><p>Chapter 866: Enmity</p><p>The aftershocks alone were enough to turn everyone's faces pale.  They were ready to abandon the crystal stele and flee without hesitation.  But the situation was far worse than they had imagined.</p><p>A wave of frigid air surged back, meeting the lightning. The two forces collided with a tremendous roar and a hissing sound, like water vapor being evaporated. For a moment, the cold air seemed to hold back the lightning, but anyone present at the point of impact would have seen the chilling air being consumed at an alarming rate.</p><p>High above, those who witnessed the lightning's onslaught erupted in joyous laughter, venting their anger. But upon seeing the Heavenly Cold Gale Array resisting the spell, their anger surged again. At the middle-aged man's command, they unleashed their secret techniques once more, gathering even more lightning.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The lightning coalesced into a thick bolt, descending from the heavens with the might of annihilation. They were clearly not unscathed either. The weaker cultivators swayed unsteadily, even the strongest among them, the middle-aged man, was pale.</p><p>Compared to them, Qin Sang and the others fared far worse. They had thought the Heavenly Cold Gale Array would buy them time to escape, but the reality was far crueler. The cold air merely weakened the lightning's power, but failed to stop it, being pierced right through.</p><p>A large hole was forcibly ripped open in the Heavenly Cold Gale Array. The crystal stele shook violently, cracks appearing at its base and rapidly spreading upwards.</p><p>"The Heavenly Cold Gale Array is going to collapse!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and terrified. The lightning's power was terrifying. Even after destroying the array, its momentum remained ferocious, sending shivers down their spines. The terrifying power usually possessed only by Nascent Soul masters was being wielded by these Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Their vision was swallowed by the lightning; they could see nothing. But Qin Sang could clearly sense the supremely yang and forceful energy descending from above, carrying immense destructive power, obliterating any resistance.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The crystal stele shattered.  The cold mist dissipated in all directions. Qin Sang trembled; the Heavenly Cold Gale Array was destroyed!</p><p>Although Qin Sang had been on guard since those people appeared, he hadn't anticipated such a swift turn of events.  The opponents were still so far away, yet their attack was so swift and decisive.  Not only Qin Sang, but everyone else felt the same.  It was unheard of; no one could have imagined these people possessing such formidable abilities.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had been focused on the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman. Sword light and the image of a Jiao flashed from his body as he sprinted towards the island's edge, escaping the range of the lightning.</p><p>The others followed suit, reacting in their own ways.  Due to the crystal stele's position, the five of them were scattered, forced to flee in different directions.</p><p>Only Chu Heng remained motionless, his eyes filled with despair. Although his cultivation was high, his expertise lay in formations and restrictions; his escape techniques and combat skills were inadequate. In this situation, he had no room to maneuver.  He couldn't escape, so he could only resist with all his might, hoping for a glimmer of survival.</p><p>Ma De Bao stood out. This cunning man, like Qin Sang, had been wary since the others appeared. Sensing danger, he immediately summoned his treasured weapon, the Impassable Five Absolutes Whip.  A rapid series of 'crack' sounds echoed as the whip's shadow vibrated, creating a strange wave, propelling Ma De Bao away.</p><p>Qiu Ji and Luo Kun somehow managed to coordinate, planning to resist together.</p><p>Of the five, Qin Sang possessed the fastest escape technique, but still couldn't outrun the lightning's onslaught.  His figure flickered, then abruptly stopped. The lightning was almost upon him. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes, and a golden light suddenly erupted from his body.</p><p>At the heart of the golden light was a suit of golden armor – the Golden Radiance Armor. This treasure had protected him many times since he obtained it. Because of its exceptionally durable materials, even as a low-grade treasure, it remained surprisingly strong.  It had been damaged at the Seven Kills Hall but later repaired by Qin Sang.  Using his understanding of the art of refining, he incorporated new materials during the repair, enhancing its defensive capabilities.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning descended from the heavens.  The Golden Radiance Armor's power completely enveloped Qin Sang. He felt an immense force slam into him, groaning as he was sent flying.  He heard a series of sharp cracking sounds and was horrified to discover that the armor itself was fractured.</p><p>This treasure, repaired only a few years ago, was damaged again.</p><p>No!</p><p>It was more than just damage.</p><p>In a flash, countless cracks filled his treasured armor.  The armor, his companion for decades, a loyal servant in countless battles, was about to be destroyed!</p><p>The sacrifice of the Golden Armor wasn't in vain. Qin Sang clearly felt that most of the lightning's power had been deflected, the most dangerous moment had passed!</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could breathe a sigh of relief, the remaining power seeped through the cracks in the Golden Armor.</p><p>Lightning struck him, penetrating his body. A numbing sensation instantly spread throughout his being.</p><p>Qin Sang froze, his heart pounding. This level of lightning was easily dispelled, causing no major damage, but it hampered his movement and reaction time.</p><p>But then he felt a sense of relief, the numbness disappearing. He discovered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly dancing gracefully within his dantian, utilizing its lightning-controlling ability, voraciously consuming the invading lightning.</p><p>Compared to the lightning from the sky, the lightning on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's wings seemed so weak.</p><p>However, the lightning had already been significantly weakened by the Heavenly Cold Fierce Wind Formation, then blocked by the Golden Armor, and further dissipated by Qin Sang's protective true energy before entering his body. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly easily devoured the remnants.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced, silently praising his spirit insect. He then immediately used his escape technique, fleeing without looking back. He sensed a familiar, intensely violent aura behind him – Kui Long!</p><p>Kui Long hadn't died. It had been released from the spirit formation at the last moment, and it was completely unafraid of the lightning summoning technique. It was coming for revenge!</p><p>Chu Heng fought desperately for survival under the lightning's onslaught, surviving the most intense wave, unaware of the approaching danger.  He was then bisected by Kui Long without resistance.</p><p>Qiu Ji and Luo Kun, fighting together, fared better than Chu Heng. They sensed Kui Long's attack, but were horrified to discover their movements were paralyzed by the lightning, their true energy stagnant, their reactions slower than before.</p><p>They fought back desperately, but Kui Long was enraged, ignoring its own wounds, swallowing both of them one after another.</p><p>Ma De Bao's escape distance was second only to Qin Sang's. He also noticed Kui Long's rampage. Though in far worse condition than Qin Sang, he desperately activated his Sky-Bridging Five Extremes Whip, fighting for his life.</p><p>Kui Long was severely injured, but still extremely dangerous.  Companions were dead or wounded, the strongest of their group, the young man surnamed Fang, was unaccounted for.</p><p>In the distance, mysterious figures watched intently.</p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to look back, rushing headlong off the island.</p><p>At that moment, an angry roar came from ahead, "Golden Armor! You killed my junior brother!"</p>
