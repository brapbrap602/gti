<h1>Chapter 2182: Ancient Cloud Patterns</h1><p>Another cultivator from the Gou tribe was summoned. Seeing their clan leader subdued, they could only silently comply.</p><p>Qin Sang now had two more assistants. As for Xie Tianjiao, Qin Sang didn't kill him immediately, planning to use him as a scout.</p><p>Although they had help this time, the highest-cultivation among them, the Fu clan leader, was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  Lacking a late-Nascent Soul expert, Qin Sang wasn't certain of successfully conquering the Thunder Palace.</p><p>The Bi Xie Ancient Palace collided with the mountain peak, creating a deep crater. The main hall was almost entirely embedded in the mountain. They stood at the mountain's edge, the interior clearly visible. Sadly, the impact destroyed the mountain's beauty, leaving few structures intact.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze settled on the nearest wooden building, constructed from an unknown type of spirit wood.  It had survived the collision, unlike the surrounding stone halls which had crumbled, standing stubbornly alone.</p><p>Liuli and the others followed, navigating the debris until they reached the wooden building.</p><p>The building was only three stories high, lacking carvings but exhibiting exquisite craftsmanship.</p><p>Though seemingly intact, it was actually precarious. The protective formation was mostly destroyed in the collision, allowing Qin Sang to effortlessly open the main door.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The door opened slowly, emitting a chilling aura.  Its age was unknown, yet it was devoid of dust.</p><p>The interior was small, with several rows of shelves occupying most of the first floor.  Qin Sang crossed the threshold, his gaze suddenly fixed on a pattern on a shelf.</p><p>Liuli followed, also noticing the pattern, her expression one of surprise.  "These are ancient Daoist cloud patterns?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Some previous speculations were finally confirmed.</p><p>Legend says these cloud patterns were created in ancient times, inspired by observations of celestial phenomena and cloud formations, embodying the principles of nature. Other patterns included thunder patterns, gluttonous patterns, dragon and phoenix patterns, and so on.</p><p>The origin of cloud patterns is untraceable. They were later popularized by the Daoist school and were once considered the creation of high-ranking Daoist masters.  Within the Daoist school, both the talisman and alchemy schools excelled in talismanic arts, with many talismans derived from these cloud patterns, known as Cloud Seal Texts.</p><p>Today, talismanic arts are widespread across the world.  Human, demon, witch, and other races all possess unique traditions, resulting in diverse cloud pattern developments.</p><p>Different sects have distinct cloud patterns; identifying these differences reveals their origin.</p><p>The patterns before them were those prevalent during the ancient Daoist school's heyday, before the clear division between talisman and alchemy schools.  The Daoist lineages were strictly guarded, and these patterns were not accessible to everyone, only passed down to legitimate successors.</p><p>While in the talisman world, Qin Sang had encountered these patterns in the Daoist court's archives. Liuli likely learned of them from Master Ning; both recognized them instantly.</p><p>The ancient cloud patterns carved on the shelves possessed no magical power, but served as characters, meaning 'Pill Formulas'!</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the adjacent shelf, which also bore an ancient cloud pattern, this one meaning 'Inferior Daoist Techniques'.</p><p>Clearly, this was a storage place for cultivation techniques belonging to a cultivator or a group, originating from the orthodox Daoist school!</p><p>As Qin Sang suspected, this mountain was most likely a Daoist cultivation ground.</p><p>Considering Master Ning's comments on the five immortal mountains, and recent findings, Qin Sang had an inkling, sharing it with Liuli.  Liuli, knowing the secrets of the Sacred Land, shared similar suspicions.</p><p>Perhaps the Yuan Qiao Immortal Mountain was once controlled by the ancient Daoist school.</p><p>Later, for unknown reasons, Yuan Qiao Immortal Mountain fell into the Nether River, obtained by the Yi people, who used it to establish their Sacred Land.</p><p>The Sacred Land's secret realms and palaces were mostly left behind by the Yi people's ancestors, with few other traces.</p><p>Could it be that the places they'd previously visited weren't the true Yuan Qiao Immortal Mountain?  Perhaps the Sacred Land wasn't built directly atop the mountain, as commonly believed, but instead created a new world using the mountain's power, while the mountain itself remained hidden, serving as a pillar for the Sacred Land?</p><p>Mahayana cultivators could create small thousand worlds. The Yi people's dominance over the East Sea, with the Misty Sea spanning the Xun and Kan states, situated between the human and aquatic races, wouldn't be possible without Mahayana-level experts.</p><p>The sacred land is being destroyed by a radiant light, revealing the true Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain, hence the ancient Daoist sect's remnants.  This means the light has pierced the outer sacred land, exposing a secluded space that is likely the true location of the Immortal Mountain!</p><p>The question is, why is the sacred land collapsing, exposing Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain? Did something happen to Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain or the Yi Ren ancestors?</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of the cause, suppressed his doubts, regained his composure, and continued examining the contents of the building.</p><p>The wooden building has three floors, each with wooden racks, decreasing in number with each level; the top floor has only one.</p><p>All the racks are empty, perhaps emptied by the Yi Ren ancestors, or perhaps taken by the building's previous occupant.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and his companions investigated the other surviving structures.  While finding no treasures, they further confirmed that this was indeed a Daoist sect's site.</p><p>Without spending too much time, they returned to the point of impact, discovering that while the mountain appeared mostly submerged in the lake, a portion was hidden from view. It seemed as if an invisible barrier had been pierced, connecting two distinct spaces, with the mountain wedged between them.</p><p>The poisonous mist in the secluded space likely seeped through these gaps.</p><p>Exercising caution, they confirmed the absence of danger before proceeding. Following the flow of the mist, they navigated the turbulent currents and finally saw the other section of the mountain.</p><p>Seeing the scene on the other side, the Fu Clan leader looked surprised. He expected to find a landmass similar to the sacred land, but instead found emptiness; a void, where the poisonous mist permeated, slowly dissipating in all directions.</p><p>The mountain itself was less a mountain and more a giant rock, floating in the void, unsupported, seemingly having drifted there and colliding with the falling Bi Xie Ancient Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang, having been here before, wasn't surprised, but remained curious about the true nature of Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain. Even as one of the Five Great Immortal Mountains, it couldn't be compared to his Daiyu Immortal Mountain. This single rock was several times larger than Daiyu, yet lacked the mountain's spiritual essence.</p><p>They searched the rock thoroughly, finding nothing more. Qin Sang gently stroked the mark on his palm, and led everyone towards the Thunder Palace.</p><p>Based on previous experience, they could gauge distance by the strength of the mark's pull. Their flight would take a good half-day of non-stop travel, but it was still much closer than going around the outside.</p><p>During their flight, they sensed frequent tremors in the void, but couldn't locate the source.  The only explanation was that the radiant light from the sacred land was affecting this area.</p><p>Sure enough, they soon saw a beam of light illuminating the darkness.</p><p>Everyone immediately accelerated, reaching the light's origin to find a multicolored opening. Through it, they could see several mountain peaks ravaged by the light.</p><p>These few peaks offered no indication of their location within the sacred land.  The light outside had formed a lake of light that wouldn't dissipate; the light was like a needle, piercing the barrier.</p><p>"The barrier between the sacred land and this space will eventually be completely destroyed..." the Fu Clan leader murmured.</p><p>"Since your ancestors left this guidance, they must have foreseen this event.  Were there any related legends?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Fu Clan leader shook his head. "I know nothing of it.  That there's another space behind the sacred land was unheard of."</p><p>Unsure of the Yi Ren ancestors' intentions, Qin Sang could only trust that they wouldn't harm their descendants.</p><p>After several more hours of flight, Qin Sang calculated that they were near where he'd agreed to meet Ji Xia.  Slightly altering their course, they found nothing.</p><p>His calculations should have been correct.  Either the rift had moved or closed up. Qin Sang left Ji Xia a message talisman and continued on, finally reaching the vicinity of the Thunder Palace.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Four figures landed on the ground, breaking through the thunderclouds.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, noting the unchanged thunder and the presence of his mark, indicating no one else had been there.</p><p>"Is this the hall the Daoist spoke of?" The Fu Clan leader asked, his eyes narrowed, assessing the thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "How is your injury, Clan Leader?"</p><p>The Fu Clan leader's damaged wing had regrown, and his complexion had improved significantly.</p><p>This rapid recovery wasn't due to any elixir, but rather a potent poison obtained in the Bi Xie Ancient Palace, refined using a secret Fu Clan technique into the incredibly valuable healing medicine, Shen Qiong Yu Jin.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first trade with the Fu Clan.  In return, after leaving the sacred land, the Fu Clan would help Qin Sang obtain several spiritual objects.</p><p>The Fufu clan leader, Shenxin, felt a surge of energy and exclaimed, "Truly worthy of the legendary Shenqiongyu Jin! My injuries are already seventy percent healed.  Give me another day, and I'll be over ninety percent recovered!"</p><p>A pang of regret struck him. If he'd had the Shenqiongyu Jin earlier, he wouldn't have been in such a sorry state.  Ninety percent recovery meant he was practically as good as new.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in satisfaction. "A day's wait is manageable.  Clan Leader, please tend to your wounds. We'll scout the Thunder Hall."</p><p>The Fufu clan leader agreed and found a quiet corner to meditate and recover.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to the Thunder Hall.  Using his mark, he traveled to the island and discovered it had been ravaged. One half was completely destroyed; the huts were clearly next.  He wasn't sure if the Thunder Hall would be affected, but he pushed aside his worries and focused on his plan to challenge the hall again.  He had already slain the first Thunder General.</p><p>Returning to the Thunder Hall entrance, Qin Sang was relieved to see the Thunder General hadn't reappeared. Days had passed, and it hadn't resurrected. It seemed there was no time limit.  They could simply focus on clearing each level one by one.</p><p>He pushed open the vermilion doors.</p><p>Four figures stood before him: Qin Sang, Liuli, the corpse cultivator Min Zhuo, and the Fugu tribe cultivator, Fu Jiang.</p><p>"We'll likely face three Thunder Generals simultaneously.  Prioritize self-preservation; don't be reckless…"</p><p>Qin Sang explained the Thunder Generals' strength to Liuli and Fu Jiang. Both looked serious.</p><p>The Thunder Generals possessed power comparable to a late-stage Transcending Void cultivator.  Unless Liuli unleashed the Celestial Emperor's Command Talisman, even Fu Jiang and Liuli working together against a single General would need to be extremely cautious.  A single mistake could lead to injury.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need them to kill the Generals; he just wanted them to hold one off while he fought the other two. He had a good chance of slaying them if he could do this.</p><p>The only real danger was the plaza's spirit array. Qin Sang had prepared countermeasures. He stepped forward into the square.</p><p>*Rumble…Crack!*</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Thunderclouds churned, and three bolts of lightning descended, striking before each of the three large halls, transforming into three towering Thunder Generals.</p><p>Their appearance, attire, weapons, and aura were identical to the first one.  They brandished thunder spears, glared menacingly at Qin Sang, and roared, "Intruders, die!"</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The three Thunder Generals unleashed overwhelming power.  Liuli and Fu Jiang visibly flinched at the intensity.</p><p>Ignoring the warning, Qin Sang mentally instructed Liuli and Fu Jiang to join him, while closely monitoring the spirit array.</p><p>They passed through the vermilion doors, standing behind Qin Sang.</p><p>With two more uninvited guests, the Thunder Generals' rage intensified.  A roar echoed, and three streaks of lightning hurtled towards them at incredible speed.</p><p>With the Thunder Generals' power and speed, they were no match for early-stage Transcending Void cultivators. Even if the Generals were essentially inanimate constructs, Liuli and Fu Jiang together wouldn't have much of a chance.</p><p>As the Generals attacked, the spirit array activated.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The vermilion doors slammed shut.</p><p>Instantly, countless tiny bolts of lightning danced around them, quickly coalescing into a thick silver mist that enveloped the plaza.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately noticed his spiritual sense and perception were restricted, but the Thunder Generals remained unaffected. The array's purpose was clear.</p><p>Since the array didn't enhance the Generals' strength, Qin Sang felt relieved. He instructed Liuli and Fu Jiang to stay put while he confronted the Generals.</p><p>He quickly confirmed their abilities and powers were identical to the first Thunder General, and they lacked any coordinated attacks. Using tactics, he lured one towards Liuli, while he and Min Zhuo fought the other two.</p><p>Having slain one before, this encounter, while challenging, was within his control.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, Qin Sang had Liuli, Fu Jiang, and Min Zhuo temporarily hold off two Generals, allowing him to swiftly kill the other. Dealing with the remaining two was easier.  Eventually, all three were vanquished, dissolving into lightning that returned to the thunderclouds, and the silver mist on the plaza dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his palm. After the Generals disappeared, three more thunder crystals merged into his mark, though there was no significant change.</p><p>Glancing at the three halls, Qin Sang approached the leftmost one.  Finding no restrictions on the door, he gently opened it to see a ball of lightning floating within.</p><p>The lightning encircled an object, shimmering silver.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved it.  It seemed to be part of armor, a leg guard, but only fist-sized.</p><p>He then opened the other two halls, obtaining another leg guard and a pair of greaves!</p>
