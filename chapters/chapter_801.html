<h1>Chapter 793: A Proposal for Cooperation</h1><p>Chapter 793: A Proposal for Cooperation</p><p>Cui Ji's meager possessions didn't match his supposed status and power.</p><p>Picking up the flying dagger, a magic weapon, Qin Sang showed a satisfied expression.  No wonder it was so sharp. Like Jin Yao's lock, it was a mid-grade magic weapon.  Cui Ji must have spent a fortune to obtain it.</p><p>Qin Sang, having had a breakthrough in swordsmanship thanks to a fortunate encounter, intended to continue her pursuit of the Way of the Sword.  She erased Cui Ji's mark from the magic weapon and put it away temporarily.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist, for your help in killing a foe for me."</p><p>Lady Liu, having calmed down after her outburst, wiped the blood from her face with a delicate finger, smoothed her hair, and thanked Qin Sang. Her eyes were unusually calm, like still water.  She showed no trace of weakness, having been tempered by the recent events.</p><p>"Lady Liu need not thank me. I acted for my own sake as well,"</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Lady Liu. "From what you say, it seems you have more than one enemy. Was Cui Ji in league with others to kill your husband, Daoist Liu?"</p><p>Lady Liu nodded, saying slowly, "There was Xiang Yi and someone surnamed An.  But the one surnamed An is already dead."</p><p>So it was them.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. After asking a few questions, she learned that as they were leaving the forbidden zone, they had encountered a terrifyingly powerful beast.  Though the couple had a chance to escape, they were ambushed by Xiang Yi and his companions. The man surnamed An, a rather large man, was unlucky and lost his life to the beast.</p><p>Daoist Liu, fighting desperately, saved his wife, but perished himself. The young man with the sword remains unaccounted for.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang was greatly surprised. There were such fearsome beasts even in the outer regions of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. From Lady Liu's description, it was as strong as the beast leader guarding the purple crystal. Fortunately, the young man and the Netherworld fire had delayed the beast, otherwise, Qin Sang might have encountered it as well.</p><p>"Next time I go to the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone to collect the Netherworld fire, I must be more careful…"</p><p>Qin Sang asked about the beast's location, bowed to Lady Liu, and said, "Lady Liu, the Seven Kills Temple is about to close. I must leave now. Until we meet again."</p><p>As she turned to leave, she was stopped by Lady Liu.</p><p>"Daoist, please wait!"</p><p>Lady Liu called out, "Daoist, we have both been harmed by these villains. Why not join forces to take revenge? Xiang Yi’s cultivation is extremely high. He mentioned that if this trip was successful, once he left the Seven Kills Temple, he would reach the peak of late-stage cultivation, only a step away from the Yuan Ying stage. His strength far surpasses Cui Ji’s. If we fight alone, we may never have a chance. Only by working together do we have a chance for revenge."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, saying calmly, "My enemy is dead. There’s no need for such extra effort."</p><p>Lady Liu became anxious, and said repeatedly:</p><p>"I don't know what you encountered at the time, but if you think only Cui Ji wanted to kill you, you are greatly mistaken.</p><p>"When you disappeared, my husband asked everyone to go back and look for you.  If they couldn’t find you, they would have to give up. Then my husband became suspicious and kept an eye on Cui Ji.</p><p>"However, the three of them had secretly colluded. Cui Ji surely didn’t act alone in trying to murder you. If you had reappeared outside while Cui Ji was missing, Xiang Yi would certainly have guessed something. With his ruthlessness, he wouldn’t let it go.</p><p>"If you don't want to live in hiding and constantly look over your shoulder, the wisest choice is to strike first and eliminate Xiang Yi.</p><p>"If you agree, I, though not very capable, will be responsible for tracking them down. You won’t need to worry about that, you just need to kill them as you did today.  And I have obtained spiritual medicine that will cure my illness and greatly improve my cultivation. I won't be a burden to you.</p><p>"As long as you agree, after revenge, all the spoils will belong to you. I only want their lives!"</p><p>Lady Liu said resolutely.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, seeming hesitant.</p><p>In fact, she had already decided to kill Xiang Yi and his accomplice. This was simply a test of Lady Liu's determination.</p><p>A late-stage cultivator at the peak and one who had just broken through to the late stage were worlds apart.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang could kill the young man was largely due to favorable terrain.</p><p>Outside the poisonous land, even with her improved swordsmanship, without using the fire pearl, she would be somewhat weak against Xiang Yi and would need careful planning.</p><p>Xiang Yi had a powerful background and was very vigilant.  Finding an opportunity to ambush him while he was alone wouldn't be easy. If Lady Liu was truly determined on revenge, she would be an excellent collaborator.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the identity of Daoist Qingfeng for decades and had close ties with the Qiongyu Trading Company; this identity was very useful.</p><p>Xiang Yi was backed by the leader of the East Pole League, a very influential figure.  Qin Sang didn't want to be targeted by him.</p><p>As Madam Liu said, eliminating Xiang Yi is the only way for him to continue using this identity.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s hesitation waver, Madam Liu, mistaking it for agreement, brightened. She handed Qin Sang a strangely shaped bronze bell.  "Daoist Master," she said, "If you agree, take this bell to Tianxing Island and give it to..."</p><p>Madam Liu then explained how to contact the recipient.</p><p>Qin Sang took the bell, considered it for a moment, and said gravely, "Daoist Liu, let me remind you not to let vengeance cloud your judgment.  If your eagerness for revenge alerts Xiang Yi, and he sets a trap, I can escape with my evasion techniques, but you might never have another chance for retribution."</p><p>Madam Liu's expression grew serious, and she nodded in agreement.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they exchanged vows and parted ways.</p><p>Qin Sang sought a secluded spot, removed his cloak, and revealed his true appearance.</p><p>Thanks to Cui Ji's interference, Huaxian Lake is out of the question. Even the seemingly safe outer perimeter of the Purple Mist Wasteland is rife with dangerous beasts; Huaxian Lake must be even more perilous.</p><p>Qin Sang decided against Huaxian Lake and instead chose to wait in the wasteland. If that proved fruitless, he would explore the three islands beyond the storm, though he was unsure if he would find the bone flute there.</p><p>He determined his direction and flew towards the wasteland.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang reviewed his journey's gains.</p><p>The various magical artifacts were significant, but the most important was the jade slip, which not only completed his Killing Talisman but also contained a technique for creating an external avatar.</p><p>The sooner he created the external avatar, the better, so he could increase its cultivation before his next visit to the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>Low-level cultivator corpses were easy to find; killing was commonplace in the cultivation world.</p><p>The origin of the spiritual fruits was unclear, so he could seek the assessment of a grand alchemist on Tianxing Island.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s greatest desire remained the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire—it was crucial for refining a top-tier magical artifact, and he was determined to acquire it.</p><p>Transforming the Xuan Iron Pillar into a banner pole required many preparations.</p><p>Tianxing Island was the ideal location to gather the necessary materials.  Moreover, it housed the largest human city, making it easiest to gather information.  For the sake of Linggui Island and Elder Qingzhu, a visit was essential.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang unknowingly reached the edge of the wasteland.</p><p>He concealed himself in a mountain, overlooking the vast expanse.</p><p>On his return to the wasteland, Qin Sang failed to find any trace of the two Nascent Soul cultivators, leading him to suspect they had already left the Seven Killing Palace after obtaining what they sought.</p>
