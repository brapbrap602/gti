<h1>Chapter 518: A Straw to Grasp</h1><p>The woman's name was Shi Ying. Although she looked young, her true age was not as it appeared.  Years ago, when Qin Sang was active in Sunny Market, he had often heard of Shi Ying from the disciples there.</p><p>Cultivators, before the decline of spiritual energy, possessed robust vitality, unlike mortals who aged easily. Moreover, some specialized cultivation techniques had remarkable effects on maintaining one's appearance.  In addition, Shi Ying was a rare ascetic cultivator, having dedicated herself to arduous cultivation in her cave dwelling day and night since childhood, untouched by worldly affairs.  Therefore, it wasn't surprising that she appeared as an innocent young woman. Her reputation stemmed from this.</p><p>Few young people, regardless of gender, possess the resilience to withstand loneliness and boredom, undisturbed by external temptations, and diligently cultivate upon entering the path of immortality.  Even those powerful cultivators with great achievements usually undergo a heart-refining process, later awakened by a certain epiphany, before clarifying their Dao Heart and dedicating themselves to the Dao.  Most cultivators may never comprehend or achieve this in their lifetime.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't lived two lives and experienced life and death, he probably wouldn't have been able to resist the allure of worldly power and beauty back then.  Shi Ying, however, was different. When she joined the Sunny Devil Sect as a youth, she displayed astonishing willpower, seemingly focused only on cultivation.  Her beauty and endearing demeanor attracted the admiration of many fellow disciples. Yet, Shi Ying remained aloof to everyone, confining herself to her cave dwelling except for completing mandatory sect chores.  Regardless of the season or time of day, she persisted year after year.  Among her peers who joined the sect at the same time, she was truly unique.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned of Shi Ying from her admirers, and although he had never met her in person, he had seen her portrait from a Sunny Devil Sect disciple. He had no interest in inquiring about a Qi Refining stage female cultivator, so his knowledge of Shi Ying was limited to this.</p><p>"It's actually her?" Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Shi Ying rarely descended the mountain. Even when she left the Sunny Devil Sect, it was usually to train at the Boundless Valley, located east of the sect. This time, however, she came from the south.  She appeared to have just wept bitterly. What could have caused such grief in a cultivator with such unwavering determination?</p><p>Shi Ying's personality was the complete opposite of Yu Batian's, representing two extremes.  Qin Sang had carefully chosen Yu Batian as his target. Now, suddenly switching to Shi Ying, he wasn't sure if it was for better or worse. He could only wait and see what Shi Ying would choose.</p><p>The coffin opened.</p><p>Shi Ying tightly gripped her defensive talisman, her eyes wide as she stared at the corpse inside, fearing a backlash.  The corpse remained still, showing no signs of reanimation.</p><p>After waiting for a while, with no changes occurring, Shi Ying pursed her lips and was about to step towards the coffin when she suddenly remembered something.  She hurriedly immersed her consciousness back into the jade slip.</p><p>A moment later, Shi Ying attempted to form a hand seal, sending a soul mark towards the corpse.</p><p>The soul mark entered the corpse's head without any resistance.</p><p>Within Qin Sang's soul space, he completely opened his soul, allowing Shi Ying's soul mark to enter its depths, essentially surrendering himself to the woman before him. He dared to do this only because, relying on the Jade Buddha, he could expel the soul mark at any time.</p><p>Other powerful cultivators wouldn't dare to be as audacious as Qin Sang, allowing someone to plant a soul mark deep within their soul. Even if they could rely on their powerful cultivation to break free from the soul mark's control, it would be difficult to completely erase it without any lingering effects. Even the slightest trace of the soul mark could become a breach for heart demons in the future, a source of calamity.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't need to worry. The Jade Buddha could even expel the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, let alone the soul mark of a mere Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p>Once the soul mark entered, Qin Sang calmed his mind and completely relinquished control of his physical body.</p><p>Seeing her soul mark successfully control the corpse, Shi Ying's expression finally relaxed. She flashed to the side of the coffin, her eyes slightly narrowed as she examined the corpse's condition.</p><p>A moment later, with a thought, the corpse stood up straight, obeying her commands as if an extension of her own body.</p><p>She learned from the jade slip that this corpse refinement was incomplete, lacking the final step: the罡煞 Infusion. Before this, she couldn't manipulate the corpse in combat, or it would self-destruct before even making a move, unable to suppress the Golden Core in its dantian.  This was precisely why the Devil Dao cultivator who specialized in corpses had died, while the corpse remained intact.</p><p>"He came here for our sect's Sunny罡 Essence, right? But I wonder which powerful enemy he provoked. He didn't obtain the Sunny罡 Essence, but instead lost his life..." Shi Ying murmured.</p><p>Cultivating Sunny Devilfire, she naturally knew how rare True Yang罡 Essence was in the world.</p><p>The evidence was before her eyes. The body, storage pouch, refined corpse, Golden Core, Earthly Yin energy… Everything was real, and her soul mark hadn't encountered any resistance, eliminating any remaining doubts.</p><p>"There actually exists such a corpse refinement method in this world..."</p><p>With a thought, Shi Ying opened the storage pouch again and retrieved a small pile of Lesser Yin magnetic bottles. Opening them, she discovered they were filled with Earthly Yin energy.</p><p>"As long as I use the Sunny罡 Essence to complete the final step of corpse refinement, I can obtain a refined corpse comparable to a pseudo Core Formation expert!"  Shi Ying's eyes widened, her grip tightening on the Lesser Yin magnetic bottles, her voice trembling with excitement.</p><p>Suddenly, Shi Ying's eyes reddened, tears streaming down her face as she sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p>"Father, Mother, your daughter can finally avenge you..."</p><p>His inner mind guarded, Qin Sang could still hear the sounds outside. Hearing these words, he was secretly surprised. This woman seemed to bear a deep-seated hatred.</p><p>No wonder… Such a personality wasn't formed without reason.  With such a nature, how could she, as a young girl during her innocent and carefree years, withstand worldly temptations?</p><p>What he heard next shocked him even more.</p><p>Shi Ying suddenly knelt on the ground, kowtowing nine times towards the south, her voice filled with hatred as she said, "Father, Mother, you must bless your daughter to personally slay that villain Wen Yanjie and avenge you!"</p><p>The enemy who killed her parents was actually Wen Yanjie, her fellow sect uncle-master.  Having sold a refined corpse to Wen Yanjie a few days ago, Qin Sang had discovered this man's duplicitous nature. It wouldn't be surprising if he had committed such an act.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the details of this love-hate entanglement.</p><p>Learning of Shi Ying's hatred, he immediately realized that she was a more suitable candidate than Yu Batian!  Shi Ying had decent talent, but Wen Yanjie was even more gifted. By the time she reached Foundation Establishment, Wen Yanjie might already be at Core Formation.  Even if Wen Yanjie failed to form his Core and remained at the pseudo Core Formation stage, Shi Ying would still need to cultivate diligently for decades to reach his level.  More likely, she would never catch up to Wen Yanjie in her lifetime, losing her chance for revenge.</p><p>His "refined corpse" was her only straw to grasp!</p>
