<h1>Chapter 1642:  Tian Linglong</h1><p>The medicinal garden is a story for another time.</p><p>The deceased's belongings are the real prize this time.</p><p>At a glance, Qin Sang discovered many items that piqued his interest.</p><p>Qin Sang took out some spirit stones to replenish his energy, sharing them with his avatar. While recovering, he took out the deceased’s pouch and carefully examined its contents.</p><p>There weren't many artifacts, elixirs, talismans, or other external items inside; in fact, there were very few, inconsistent with his cultivation level.</p><p>For many years, the deceased focused on cultivating the Gu King, refining his poisonous arts, and managing the virulent poison within his body.  Later, with the Gu King's maturation and acquisition of the Chi Xuan Ancient Tree, he dedicated himself to cultivating the Houtian Wooden Man Stele, preparing to open the  Unseen Immortal Gate's hidden vault, leaving little time for anything else.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang's spiritual sense activated the pouch, releasing several beams of light.</p><p>He caught one of the wooden boxes.</p><p>Opening the box revealed a mass of blue light.  His spiritual sense swept over it, and the refining method for the Tian Linglong appeared in his mind. This secret technique, never revealed by the Mu Xiang Hall, was finally his.</p><p>The refining method was exceptionally complete, including insights from past Mu Xiang Hall masters.</p><p>Seeing it firsthand, he understood that refining the Tian Linglong wasn't as easy as the deceased had claimed.</p><p>The refiner must first possess profound skills in the art of artifact refinement and a cultivation base no lower than late-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>This treasure aids in the breakthrough to the Transcendence stage; its value is self-evident.</p><p>However, even if someone were to refine a Tian Linglong and offer it for trade, they would still have to weigh the gains and losses. This shows just how difficult it is to refine this treasure.</p><p>Refining the Tian Linglong is not a matter of days or months, and the necessary materials are all rare and extraordinary treasures. Even Qin Sang, considered a master refiner, didn’t recognize several of the ingredients.</p><p>The other beams of light contained jade slips, some of which held the Mu Xiang Hall's refining legacy.</p><p>During the Unseen Immortal Gate’s heyday, the Mu Xiang Hall was renowned for its artifact refinement. This legacy would undoubtedly greatly aid Qin Sang, allowing for significant advancements in his refining skills once he had time to devote to it—a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he had obtained the Unseen Immortal Gate's alchemy and artifact refinement legacies.</p><p>Using the jade slips, Qin Sang found records of the unfamiliar ingredients. He could possibly locate some of them with time and effort, while others would depend on luck.</p><p>One ingredient in particular, a substance called Moon Laurel Celestial Dew, was especially rare, originating from the Celestial 桂秘境 (Gui Secret Realm) of the Tian Tong Hall, accessible only once every few hundred years.</p><p>The deceased failed to find the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew in the Mu Xiang Hall.</p><p>With the Celestial Halls now ascended, the Celestial 桂秘境 is inaccessible. Where could he possibly find it?</p><p>The Tian Linglong refining method omitted this information, deliberately concealed by the deceased, otherwise the weeping spirit cave master wouldn't have been so optimistic.</p><p>There were exceptions, however. A Yuan Ying cultivator from the Unseen Immortal Gate, while exploring the outer reaches of the Storm Belt, stumbled upon an ancient cultivator's vault and found a small vial.</p><p>Such things might exist in this world, hidden in some unknown ancient cultivator’s vault.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed five elemental spiritual roots, rendering the Tian Linglong useless to him. Yet, upon seeing it, he still felt a pang of disappointment. Without the necessary materials, the value of this secret technique would be greatly reduced. He needed to consider how to maximize its profit.</p><p>The deceased had not only withheld this information from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to the last beam of light and gently beckoned.</p><p>The light settled in his hand, revealing a crystal-clear jade sphere. About the size of a baby's fist, it emitted a pure green light, bright and radiant, like a night pearl.</p><p>This was the Tian Linglong!</p><p>However, this Tian Linglong was merely an unfinished spirit embryo.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently, his gaze piercing the green light, revealing flaws in the jade.</p><p>The surface of the sphere was not smooth, containing countless tiny voids. These voids were extremely small, almost undetectable without careful perception.</p><p>Each void was inscribed with countless restrictions, of a complexity Qin Sang had never seen before.  Few treasures in this world could compare, and this was only the first layer.</p><p>The Tian Linglong could be seen as five nested jade spheres.</p><p>All five spheres were of comparable intricacy.</p><p>Upon completion, the five spheres must be fused as one, their energies balanced, preventing conflict.</p><p>Further observation revealed that the Tian Linglong was not entirely solid, existing in a state between reality and illusion, capable of merging with any type of innate treasure.</p><p>Years ago, a Mu Xiang Hall master crafted the spirit embryo, placing it in the artifact chamber, nurtured by the Hall's unique refining spirit array. Then the great war broke out, the master fell, and the treasure remained in the Mu Xiang Hall, forgotten and unknown.</p><p>Upon discovering it, the deceased was overjoyed. Although the embryo was far from complete, at least he no longer needed to worry about the Moon Laurel Celestial Dew.</p><p>Even if he had found more than one, he wouldn't readily give them away to the  Crypt Spirit Master.</p><p>Just the wood-attribute hall's refining techniques and the Sky Linglong Spirit Embryo were worth consuming a Boiling Snow Pill, let alone that Qin Sang had hardly paid any price.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly claimed it was good luck, carefully storing the treasures one by one. He activated his spatial pouch, and three more beams of light flew out.</p><p>A token, a wooden armor, and a piece of dead tree.</p><p>The token was the Wood Phase Token.</p><p>After soul-searching the Crypt Spirit Master, Qin Sang learned that the Five Phase Tokens seemed to have a significant role on Emperor Grant Mountain.  Uncertain of their purpose, he temporarily put it away to observe later.</p><p>The wooden armor was frozen by the Ice Soul Divine Light. After the grotesque-faced man's demise, it fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>This treasure was undoubtedly a powerful defensive artifact, but it needed to have the grotesque-faced man's aura removed and be carefully refined before use.  He put it aside with the piece of dead tree.</p><p>The dead tree was a remnant of the Red Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>When the grotesque-faced man self-destructed his spirit wood body, the spirit tree disintegrated. While its essence remained, a part survived. However, the spirit tree had been refined by the grotesque-faced man for many years using secret techniques, tainted with his aura, and could only be used for refining items now.</p><p>Qin Sang was more interested in the grotesque-faced man's abilities: his spirit wood body and poison needles.</p><p>Continuing his search, he finally found a short piece of dead wood in the spatial pouch.</p><p>Less than a foot long and wrist-thick, it was completely black and clearly a completely rotten piece of wood.  His divine sense detected nothing unusual.</p><p>In any other place, Qin Sang wouldn't have given it a second glance.</p><p>However, upon carefully searching with his divine sense and touching a barely perceptible point of light at the wood's core, he realized it held a secret!</p><p>The dead wood contained several cultivation techniques from the Wood Phase Hall, likely left by one of its descendants.</p><p>The techniques included the grotesque-faced man's fundamental cultivation method, "Wood Emperor Strategy," and its associated abilities, as well as the "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" that Qin Sang had been searching for!</p><p>To cultivate the abilities, one needed to find spirit wood and forge a spirit wood body to become as strong as the grotesque-faced man, comparable to a physical cultivator.</p><p>In a forest rich with wood spirit energy, one could become like a divine stele, rooting themselves, connecting their energy with all the trees, absorbing wood spirit energy, leading to comprehensive improvements, greatly enhancing both strength and recovery ability.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought, no wonder the grotesque-faced man was so difficult to deal with after his transformation.</p><p>And the grotesque-faced man had only achieved minor success in his cultivation.  Greater accomplishments would unlock many more incredible abilities, but it would be very difficult for a Nascent Soul stage cultivator to reach that level.</p><p>Furthermore, the improvements from the Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele were also related to the quality of the spirit wood.</p><p>After reading, Qin Sang subconsciously looked at his external avatar.</p><p>Back then, the Performance Dao Tree could make Bai lose composure. Were there any spirit trees of higher rank?</p><p>However, to refine the Performance Dao Tree into a spirit wood body and integrate it into himself, he would have to restore the Performance Dao Tree to its original form, abandoning his external avatar—a difficult choice.</p><p>The "Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele" had great potential, improving his own body, but the external avatar had the ability to die and be reborn, and he had already invested a great deal of energy and resources in it.</p><p>Refining a spirit wood body was not a simple matter either.</p><p>His external avatar was about to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage; its potential might not be inferior to a spirit wood body, and its ability to die and be reborn was a divine ability that could not be abandoned.</p><p>Even with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, Qin Sang dared not claim invincibility.</p><p>With a sigh, he decided to put off these troubling matters for now.  He put away the dead wood and took out a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the complete "Gu Scripture" from the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain.</p><p>The latter half of the Gu Scripture didn't record the method of cultivating Gu Kings, but based on its description, it was clear that Gu Kings and the Gu Scripture were of the same lineage.</p><p>Gu Kings must be the core secret of Ten Thousand Poison Mountain.  It was unknown how the grotesque-faced man obtained it, completely sweeping up parts of Ten Thousand Poison Mountain's inheritance.</p><p>No wonder Ten Thousand Poison Mountain held such a deep grudge.</p><p>The latter part of the "Gu Scripture" recorded several poison-based abilities, with the "Heavenly Extinction Soul-Slaying Needle" being the strongest.</p><p>Its name implied that once the poison needle was released, it would destroy all living beings and ghosts in the world, a grand aspiration and a power befitting the name.</p><p>Cultivating this ability required a potent poison, but when refining the poison, one must be careful not to rush, lest the poison invade the internal organs, causing one's death before the cultivation is complete.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man undoubtedly used the Gu King to cultivate this ability.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze from the Gu Scripture to the demonic fire floating in the cave, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>After the Gu King devoured its host, its blood-red color gradually faded, almost returning to its original jade-white color, but its ferocious temperament hadn't lessened; instead, it was becoming even more intense.</p><p>He didn't know how to subdue the Gu King and had been using the demonic fire as a prison to confine it. After reading the "Gu Scripture" and the grotesque-faced man's collection, he still hadn't found a way to subdue the Gu King.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>Wan Du Shan dared to reveal this information, confident that even if he killed the Strange-Faced Man, he couldn't subdue the Gu King and would have to trade with Wan Du Shan.</p><p>The Gu King's poison is extraordinary, its inherent power is extremely high, and its value is immeasurable.</p><p>"What will Wan Du Shan offer in exchange?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but didn't hold out much hope.</p><p>If possible, he would rather subdue the Gu King himself and control this powerful weapon.  At least he should consult the Ghost Mother before considering a trade.</p><p>But going to Di Shou Mountain is not a long-term solution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Gu King for a while, his mind stirred.</p><p>The fat silkworm's poison pearl can counteract the Heaven-Severing Soul-Destroying Needle, so could it suppress the Gu King's ferocity?  For the time being at Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, making it behave is enough.</p><p>Thinking it through, he acted.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind on his dantian, activating the poison pearl.</p><p>Seven-colored rays burst from his dantian, and the poison pearl slowly flew out towards the Gu King.</p><p>Sensing the pearl's aura,</p><p>the Gu King's wingbeats suddenly stopped. It turned, its blood-red eyes fixed on the pearl, as if facing a great enemy, then emitted a more urgent and sharper buzzing sound.</p><p>"Good, it's reacting…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. After a moment's thought, he directly sent the poison pearl through the demonic fire, appearing before the Gu King.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Immediately, a stream of poison shot out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare be too reckless, controlling the poison pearl to evade, allowing only the edge of the poison to touch it.</p><p>Suddenly, the poison pearl dissipated into mist, the poison stream passing right through it.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the poison pearl reformed, unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang checked it over, relieved, and guided the poison pearl towards the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King's wings vibrated wildly, spraying poison, but it couldn't hit Qin Sang or destroy the poison pearl. Instead, the demonic fire gradually compressed its space, forcing the poison pearl closer.</p><p>Soon, the poison pearl floated above the Gu King's head.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The poison pearl transformed into a stream of anti-poison light, ready to swallow the Gu King.</p><p>The next moment, the Gu King was enveloped in the light, its faint outline still visible within the light.</p><p>However, the light only approached the Gu King a certain distance before it couldn't advance any further. The Gu King spread its wings, its body emitting a faint bloody light, forming a protective layer of poison, and it escaped the light.</p><p>The attempt failed, but Qin Sang's face wasn't downcast, but surprised, as if he had discovered something unexpected.</p><p>He continued to control the poison pearl, repeating the process.</p><p>He tried dozens of times, all ending in failure.</p><p>Yet, the strange look in Qin Sang's eyes intensified, as he made an astonishing discovery.</p><p>Each time the poison pearl enveloped the Gu King, Qin Sang had a sensation that the poison pearl's power seemed to yearn for the Gu King, intent on devouring it!</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang was certain this feeling wasn't a delusion.</p><p>He remembered that the fat silkworm, after its fourth transformation, could directly devour Gu insects. He had even cultivated some, letting it feast. The Gu King's cultivation method was similar to those Gu insects.</p><p>The poison pearl extracted from it also inherited the ability to devour!</p><p>"Could the poison pearl's power continue to increase if it devours the Gu King?"</p><p>The thought sparked Qin Sang's interest.</p><p>The anti-poison ability had a narrow range of effects, but once used, it produced remarkable results.</p><p>Qin Sang always adhered to the principle that external objects were inferior to oneself. The poison pearl was closely connected to him, a part of himself. If the poison pearl continually devoured poisons, what kind of transformation would it undergo in the future?</p><p>The Gu King's intelligence was low; in terms of potential, it was clearly inferior to the poison pearl.</p><p>The problem was that the poison pearl couldn't suppress the Gu King. How could he make the Gu King willingly be devoured?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, recalling various scriptures, and studying the "Gu Scripture" again, until his True Essence was almost restored and it was time to leave, yet he still hadn't found a solution.</p><p>Suddenly, he had a flash of insight and clapped his hands.</p><p>Since the art of Gu control wouldn't work, why not start with its master?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what methods the Strange-Faced Man used to suppress the Gu King. But he knew that the Strange-Faced Man's fundamental cultivation technique was the "Wood Emperor Strategy," which harmonized with the Wood Dao.</p><p>The Gu King was always by the Strange-Faced Man's side, perhaps it feared this aura.</p><p>However, before letting his incarnation try, Qin Sang withdrew his spirit from his Purple Mansion, returning to his primordial spirit.</p><p>Since merging with Yun Youzi's  Jiao Mu True Spirit, the Yun You Sword, which had never been used, made its first appearance!</p><p>A flash from his brow.</p><p>The Azure Void sword light instantly illuminated the cave!</p><p>"Old friend, it's your turn…"</p><p>Qin Sang was full of emotion, yet also a little sentimental, pointing a finger at the Gu King.</p><p>The Yun You Sword, having merged with the ten great divine trees, was considered a treasure of the Wood Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't using the Yun You Sword to kill the Gu King; he didn't have to worry about damaging the True Spirit. Instead, he was using the sword intent, the purest essence of the Wood Dao treasure, to awe the Gu King.</p><p>If successful, he would retract the poison pearl, the Gu King, and the Yun You Sword into his body. This state could be maintained until the poison pearl devoured the Gu King!</p>
