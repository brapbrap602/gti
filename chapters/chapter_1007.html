<h1>Chapter 999: Reunion</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, have you found any clues on how to break through to the Corpse King realm?” Qin Sang asked with a hint of excitement.</p><p>Bai shook his head. “If the issue of fundamental life force isn't resolved, I wouldn't even dare to attempt a breakthrough, let alone have any clues.  It's also difficult for me to find anything useful from other Corpse Dao secret techniques.”</p><p>……</p><p>The two discussed in the cave dwelling for a long time, then secretly left the market and flew towards the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>Amidst a landscape of bluish-green and reddish-brown, a faint white path snaked upwards.</p><p>This inconspicuous mountain path led directly to the Heavenly Dao Sect's gate.</p><p>At this moment, a figure was walking along the mountain path.</p><p>Qin Sang had come alone.</p><p>His pace appeared slow but was actually swift. Each light step covered several dozen meters, and he quickly reached the summit, where he saw an ancient stele inscribed with the words 'Heavenly Dao'.</p><p>This seemed to be the gate of the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>It felt rather austere.</p><p>But the ancient Heavenly Dao stele exuded a profound Daoist aura, signifying its extraordinary nature.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back down the mountain and took a step forward.</p><p>The scenery suddenly shifted.  Two young cultivators, a man and a woman, both at the Foundation Establishment stage, appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>“Junior Zhang Yi and Junior Xia You, by order, guard the mountain gate. May we ask for Senior's Daoist name and the purpose of your visit?”</p><p>The two bowed to Qin Sang with respectful attitudes.  Qin Sang hadn't deliberately concealed his cultivation, so they naturally didn't dare to show any disrespect.</p><p>“This humble Daoist's surname is Qin. I'm here today to visit an old friend.” Qin Sang said amiably.</p><p>Since he was making a formal visit, Qin Sang decided not to be secretive and presented his true appearance. In this identity, he had offended the Black Serpent Mountain, a force of the Wu Clan.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang had investigated thoroughly. The Lan Dou Sect hadn't launched a widespread manhunt for him, indicating that the incident hadn't implicated him. He didn't need to worry within human territories.</p><p>Hearing this, the two relaxed. The woman named Xia You said, “May I ask which senior is your friend? This junior will send a message for you.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. “I don't know much about this friend. We met by chance many years ago and haven't been in contact since.  I happened to be passing by the Heavenly Dao Sect and remembered this old friend, so I came to visit. I only know that their surname is Ning, and they claimed to be from the Sword Cultivator lineage…”</p><p>He provided vague information.</p><p>The two looked troubled. “May we ask what is your friend's cultivation level?”</p><p>“That's hard to say. Many years ago, they were already at the Core Formation stage.  Given their talent, reaching Nascent Soul would be highly likely…” Qin Sang pondered for a moment.</p><p>The two became respectful, not daring to neglect him. After a brief whispered discussion, Xia You said respectfully, “This junior isn't certain of your friend's identity. If Senior has no urgent matters, please come with me to Welcome Peak and wait a while. This junior will report to the elders and help you find your friend.”</p><p>“Very well…”</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed and followed Xia You towards the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>Towering peaks and crisscrossing rivers.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Sect was indeed the leading righteous sect of the Canglang Sea.  What Qin Sang saw now was just the tip of the iceberg, but its magnificent scenery was already comparable to Mount Shaohua.</p><p>It was understandable.</p><p>Mount Shaohua only had one Nascent Soul ancestor, Lord Dongyang. In the Canglang Sea, there were many similar sects.</p><p>Compared to the Canglang Sea, the Xiao Han Region appeared even smaller, not even as large as the Wu God Continent, let alone the entire vast sea region.</p><p>They soon arrived at Welcome Peak. Xia You settled Qin Sang in a refined pavilion, ordered tea and spiritual fruits to be served, then excused herself.</p><p>Qin Sang had no interest in tea. Gazing at the scenery outside, his mind wandered.</p><p>Comparing the Pure Yang Sect to the Heavenly Dao Sect shouldn't be wrong.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu instructed him to come here to find someone, surely with a deeper meaning. Perhaps arrangements had already been made, but he didn't know the person's identity.</p><p>After a while, there was a sudden rush of footsteps downstairs.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head.</p><p>Xia You had returned, following behind a young man.</p><p>Seeing the young man, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  This person's cultivation was unfathomable, seemingly no weaker than his own.</p><p>“Elder, this is the senior who is looking for a friend with the surname Ning.”</p><p>Xia You introduced them. “Senior Qin, this is Elder Pei…”</p><p>Elder Pei spoke in a low voice, “You may leave. I'll personally attend to Fellow Daoist Qin.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xia You bowed and withdrew.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's gaze, Elder Pei calmly sat opposite him and personally poured tea. “Xia You was vague earlier. Could Fellow Daoist describe your friend's characteristics in detail?”</p><p>He presented the jade cup with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the jade cup. The tea mist rose, transforming into myriad shapes, carrying a subtle sharpness. A faint tea fragrance wafted out, refreshing the heart and mind.</p><p>At this moment, the natal spirit sword within his body stirred.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.  He reached out to take the cup. The moment his fingers touched it, they trembled silently.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang's fingers seemed to transform into a spirit sword, sword Qi erupting.</p><p>The sword Qi was formless.</p><p>The tea mist transformed even more rapidly, initially into flowers, birds, fish, and insects, then into lotuses, divine beasts, and other imagery, finally into awe-inspiring scenes of starlight and thunder.</p><p>Within the confines of the cup.</p><p>Sword intent erupted, swift in its arrival and even swifter in its departure.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, the tea mist dispersed without a trace.</p><p>Within the small room, everything was ordinary. Aside from the clear tea, nothing else was affected.</p><p>The jade cup remained intact.</p><p>Qin Sang drank it all in one gulp. The tea was warm, leaving a lingering fragrance.</p><p>‘Clink!’</p><p>Qin Sang set down the cup and gazed at the young man. “Should I call you Fellow Daoist Pei, or Fellow Daoist Ning?”</p><p>The brief exchange was limited to the tea mist.</p><p>Victory or defeat wasn't important.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense that the young man’s swordsmanship was very familiar, identical to Senior Qingzhu’s teachings.</p><p>“The ‘Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter,’ Fellow Daoist has actually cultivated this technique to such a realm!”</p><p>The young man exclaimed repeatedly, cupping his hands in a salute. “Pei is fine, Ning is fine. When we’re alone, Fellow Daoist can call me Ning. I am Ning Wu Hui!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. This person even knew the ‘Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter’, he must have a close relationship with Senior Qingzhu. He had finally found the right person.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to be so easy.</p><p>This person was actually at Welcome Peak, responsible for this matter. It seemed everything had been arranged beforehand, no wonder Senior Qingzhu was so certain.</p><p>“This place is crowded. Fellow Daoist, please come with me to my cave dwelling…”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui stood up.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally had no objections. He immediately rose and followed Ning Wu Hui out of the pavilion.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's cave dwelling was located behind Welcome Peak.</p><p>They entered a bamboo forest.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui transmitted his voice, “Fellow Daoist being able to cultivate this technique to the late Core Formation stage shouldn’t be a problem. However, I have never met Fellow Daoist Qin before.”</p><p>“I don’t know what agreement Senior Qingzhu had with Fellow Daoist Ning. I hadn’t met Senior Qingzhu before, but we met by chance. After receiving his guidance, I came specifically to visit Fellow Daoist Ning.”</p><p>Qin Sang answered carefully.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Rushed to get this out!</p>
