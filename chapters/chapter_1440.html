<h1>Chapter 1432: The Value of the Recipe</h1><p>Chapter 1432: The Value of the Recipe</p><p>Blue Star Island.</p><p>Qin Sang, masked, found the Dan Ding Society and openly revealed his Yuan Ying cultivator aura.</p><p>A Dan Ding Society manager respectfully invited him into a quiet room, and after clarifying his purpose, hurried away.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>A Daoist elder in green robes, a late Golden Core cultivator, entered.  He first bowed to Qin Sang, respectfully saying, "Senior, you wish to refine Yinxiang Pill.  Only the Grand Elder has the skill to ensure success. Unfortunately, he recently returned to Dan Ding Mountain for closed cultivation, sensing a breakthrough opportunity. He won't return to the Boundless Sea for at least half a year. If you urgently require the pill, you can request the assistance of other seniors."</p><p>He dared not conceal anything from a Yuan Ying master, revealing the relationship between the Dan Ding Society and Dan Ding Mountain completely.</p><p>Closed cultivation for a breakthrough?</p><p>The Dan Ding Mountain sect master is a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator; he wouldn't likely deign to personally manage the Dan Ding Society's affairs.</p><p>It's likely a cultivator at the early stage of Yuan Ying from Dan Ding Mountain preparing to advance to the mid-stage.</p><p>"Dan Ding Mountain is quite powerful!"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Cultivators from sects specializing in alchemy tend to find cultivation and breakthroughs easier.</p><p>Taiyi Alchemy Sect was lacking during Grandmaster Chong Yi’s generation, but immediately afterward, two Yuan Ying cultivators emerged, and now the sect is flourishing.</p><p>"Among Dan Ding Mountain, who has the deepest understanding of alchemy?"</p><p>Qin Sang softly coughed and asked.  The Dan Ding Society's Grand Elder was Yinquan Zhenren.</p><p>"It is Grand Elder Yinquan," the elder replied with reverence. "The Grand Elder spearheaded the creation of the Dan Ding Society."</p><p>Half a year…</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, deciding to wait six months. He only had one Lingzhan Flower; it was best to be safe.</p><p>He nodded. "Arrange a secluded residence for me on the island. I will wait here for Daoist Yinquan. Also, help me collect these herbs."</p><p>He produced a jade slip and a pouch of spirit stones, giving them to the elder.</p><p>The jade slip listed the auxiliary herbs needed for the Yinxiang Pill.</p><p>The Lingzhan Flower was the sole main ingredient, and the most difficult to find. The other ingredients were far less valuable than the Lingzhan Flower; only two were somewhat troublesome, but he believed the Dan Ding Society could obtain them.</p><p>For a Yuan Ying cultivator, problems solvable with spirit stones were not problems at all.</p><p>Of course, in the cultivation world, high-grade spirit stones were rare, and even Yuan Ying cultivators wouldn't have many.</p><p>Top-grade spirit stones were even rarer; Qin Sang, as the sect master, didn't possess a single one.  Even the compensation received after the Crime Abyss surrendered didn't include top-grade spirit stones.</p><p>He would discuss the compensation for commissioning Daoist Yinquan to refine the pill when they met.</p><p>The elder, after reviewing the jade slip's contents, showed slight surprise but refrained from asking further questions. He counted the spirit stones in front of Qin Sang and replied, "Senior, these spirit stones are more than enough. I will immediately instruct someone to prepare the residence."</p><p>An incense stick later.</p><p>The elder led Qin Sang to the best residence on the island.</p><p>Thereafter, Qin Sang remained in the residence.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang devoted most of his energy to refining the Nine Nether Demon Fire, striving to improve his Fire Seed Golden Lotus to maximize the efficacy of the Yinxiang Pill.</p><p>After waiting seven months on Blue Star Island, Qin Sang finally met the Dan Ding Society's Grand Elder.</p><p>Daoist Yinquan, dressed in Daoist robes, was somewhat slender, with exceptionally bright, piercing eyes. His aura was still unsteady, and Qin Sang immediately recognized that he had just broken through to the mid-stage Yuan Ying.</p><p>"Congratulations, Daoist friend, on your further advancement in the Dao," Qin Sang offered his congratulations.</p><p>Daoist Yinquan, unable to conceal his joy, repeatedly said he didn't deserve the compliment. "I only just left closed cultivation and received a message informing me that Daoist friend Qin needs to refine the Yinxiang Pill. I didn't dare keep you waiting and rushed here after stabilizing my cultivation."</p><p>The alias Mingyue was unsafe, so Qin Sang used his real name.</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren had certainly never heard of this person before. A mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator couldn't be unknown.  He glanced at the mask on Qin Sang's face and discreetly refrained from asking questions.</p><p>Qin Sang got straight to the point. "Daoist Yinquan, what are your terms for refining the pill?"</p><p>Daoist Yinquan smiled, unexpectedly saying,  "Daoist Qin, you may not know, but Dan Ding Mountain also possesses a Yinxiang Pill recipe, though it's incomplete, with a success rate of less than 10%. I was initially skeptical, but seeing the herbs you sought, I'm certain you possess a more complete ancient recipe.  Would you be willing to tell me where you obtained the recipe? Do you have other ancient recipes? I won't charge you for this, and if you ever need anything in the future, I will gladly refine it for you!"</p><p>The Ancient Immortal Battlefield is truly a treasure trove!</p><p>This was the only thought that crossed Qin Sang's mind after hearing this.</p><p>Before embarking on his travels, Qin Sang traded some of the array scriptures from the Yuan Shen Gate for some useful alchemic formulas from the Taiyi Dan Sect's Jing Lin.  The Yinxiang Pill formula was among them.</p><p>This was to avoid encountering spirit herbs without knowing an alchemist.</p><p>It seems his foresight was correct.</p><p>Jing Lin agreed to the trade because the main ingredients of these ancient formulas were extremely rare in the current era, so their dissemination posed little threat.</p><p>Finding the Lingzhan flower at the Jing Hai Sect was an unexpected bonus.</p><p>Bringing it to the North Sea drastically increased the formulas' value.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't reveal its origin.  Although contact between the two regions had been severed for a long time, the fact that two great cultivators from the Bei Chen region had ascended made him uneasy.</p><p>"I unexpectedly acquired two formulas," Qin Sang said vaguely, selecting a more complex one—almost impossible to gather all the ingredients for—and giving it to Master Yinquan. "This is another one. If you are interested, should I acquire similar ancient formulas in the future, I will have someone send them to the Dan Ding Society for your appraisal."</p><p>This was the real payment; the Yinxiang Pill formula was a necessity.</p><p>He wasn't worried about Master Yinquan suspecting he possessed more; this would highlight his value and ensure Master Yinquan took him seriously.</p><p>He planned to discuss the other formulas at his leisure.</p><p>Master Yinquan put away the formula, looked deeply at Qin Sang, and said, "Then I will await good news from you!"</p><p>Next,</p><p>After waiting another month for the final auxiliary herb, Master Yinquan started refining the pill.</p><p>As Qin Sang finished a pot of spirit tea in his quiet room,</p><p>Master Yinquan entered, smiled at Qin Sang who stood up, and said, "I have succeeded!"</p><p>He then produced a jade bottle and gave it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Inside the jade bottle was a dark yellow spirit pill.  Its medicinal power formed a thin mist on its surface, occasionally revealing a faint image of a Lingzhan flower.</p><p>Opening the lid, Qin Sang smelled the familiar scent of the Lingzhan flower, felt his mind clear, and was overjoyed.</p><p>After receiving the Yinxiang Pill, Qin Sang intended to leave and immediately refine the pill, but Master Yinquan stopped him.</p><p>"I've just reviewed recent reports from the trading house.  I didn't expect so much to happen in the boundless sea while I was away. You've been on Blue Star Island, so you probably haven't heard."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *It's just the Jing Hai Sect reappearing, you don't know the Lingzhan flower was dug up from the Jing Hai Sect, do you?*</p><p>He casually asked what happened, only to hear Master Yinquan say,  "The biggest event is that the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly will be held in six months!"</p>
