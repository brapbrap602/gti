<h1>Chapter 497: Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit</h1><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously, “What good news?”</p><p>Yun Youzi teased him, “Brother, let me ask you first, has your foundation recovered?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said in a deep voice, “The Harmonizing Elixir that Senior sent with Yu Fu has significantly weakened in potency. My foundation is still a bit away from being fully healed. I can feel that elixirs like the Harmonizing Elixir no longer have any effect on me. This is what worries me the most. I'm afraid the damage to my foundation will affect my Core Formation.”</p><p>Recently, Qin Sang had been hesitant about whether to refine the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>Having smoothly cultivated to the Pseudo Core Formation stage, Qin Sang couldn't help but hold onto a sliver of hope that the damage to his foundation might not affect his breakthrough.</p><p>But he wasn't sure.</p><p>If his foundation remained unhealed and he couldn't form his core, refining these two spiritual herbs now would be a waste.</p><p>Yun Youzi said, “During my retreat at my sect, I found an opportunity to consult a senior uncle about your problem.</p><p>This senior uncle is particularly skilled in alchemy, his mastery second to none within the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, even surpassing the Sect Master. If anyone can resolve your doubts, it's him.</p><p>My senior uncle said that cases like yours, where someone cultivates to the Pseudo Core Formation stage despite a damaged foundation, are rare, but not unheard of.</p><p>According to him, this kind of damage won't have a decisive impact on Core Formation. There have been precedents of successful Core Formation in the cultivation world. Brother Qin, you can proceed with confidence.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>The Taiyi Alchemy Sect was the leading authority on alchemy in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>Someone considered the best in the Taiyi Alchemy Sect must be extraordinary. If Qin Sang couldn't trust his words, he didn't know who he could trust.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Yun Youzi's tone suddenly changed, making Qin Sang's heart sink.</p><p>“Brother Qin, you can't just ignore it. Especially after breaking through to the Core Formation stage, this hidden danger will have a more significant impact on your strength. As your power increases, the gap between you and cultivators of the same rank will be infinitely magnified. In battles between high-level cultivators, a tiny difference can determine life and death…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, humming in agreement, knowing that Yun Youzi's warning was not unfounded.</p><p>The reason he was able to outshine his peers at the Foundation Establishment stage, without feeling the impact of his damaged foundation, and repeatedly defeat opponents of higher realms, was mainly due to external forces.</p><p>In the early stages, he had the Ten Yama King Formation, more powerful than talismans, and the elusive Ebony Sword. Later, he possessed two magical treasures, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, and other divine objects.</p><p>He also had the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" technique throughout the Foundation Establishment stage, as well as his corpse refinement skills.</p><p>Once he broke through to the Core Formation stage, these advantages would be diminished.</p><p>Other Core Formation experts also had magical treasures.</p><p>Without the latter half of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture", he couldn't refine corpses beyond the Flying Celestial Yaksha. His current Flying Celestial Yaksha still lagged behind true Core Formation experts.</p><p>Only the techniques granted by the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter", the current Sword Qi Thunder Sound, and the Sword Light Splitting after Core Formation, were Qin Sang's greatest reliance in the future.</p><p>But this technique was incomplete. Whether he could obtain Senior Green Bamboo's self-created technique remained uncertain.</p><p>At that time, what would he use to bridge the gap?</p><p>As Yun Youzi said, the gap would widen in the future, and he would gradually fall behind.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang frowning in silence, Yun Youzi asked, “Brother Qin, do you still remember the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit?”</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly raised his head.</p><p>Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>How could he not remember?</p><p>When his foundation was first damaged, he searched through the ancient texts of Shaohua Mountain and found two heavenly treasures that could restore it: one called the Dao Scripture Grass, and the other was the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>“Do you still remember what I said at Yin Mountain Pass? The most likely place for heavenly treasures is the Violet Palace. The heavenly treasure I tracked down recently is the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. Now it's confirmed, a Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit does exist within the Violet Palace!”</p><p>Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang and said in a deep voice.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. “Senior, have you disappeared for so many years to search for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit for me? Then your hidden injuries…”</p><p>Yun Youzi hummed in affirmation.</p><p>“These kinds of heavenly treasures are incredibly rare. I wasn't sure at first, and time was of the essence, so I had to go alone. Fortunately, I didn't disappoint you and found definite information.</p><p>As for my hidden injuries, ordinary spiritual herbs outside are ineffective.</p><p>I only know of one method. There’s a unique realm within the Violet Palace that might help me. However, it's not easy to enter, and I need your help.</p><p>Since returning, I've been searching for the Violet Palace Secret Map. I had a lead on one.</p><p>Unexpectedly, you produced two at once, saving me a lot of effort. I can use this time to properly instruct Yu Fu. This journey… I don't know if I'll return.”</p><p>Yun Youzi glanced at Li Yu Fu, who was keeping watch outside the island.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang worriedly asked, “Senior, are your chances low?”</p><p>Yun Youzi hummed, saying calmly, “Using this method is like breaking and then rebuilding. As the saying goes, 'Without breaking, there can be no rebuilding,' but who can be certain of the 'rebuilding'? I have at most a 10% chance of success. However, I don't want to remain at the Pseudo Core Formation stage for the rest of my life. I must make this trip.”</p><p>Yun Youzi spoke resolutely.</p><p>Only a 10% chance!</p><p>Yun Youzi must have already accepted the possibility of sacrificing himself.</p><p>His eyes were calm, and Qin Sang knew that Yun Youzi's pursuit of the Dao was unwavering. He couldn't persuade him to give up. As a friend, all he could do was offer his full support.</p><p>“Senior, is the unique realm you mentioned in the inner or outer palace?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Brother Qin, you seem quite knowledgeable about the Violet Palace!”</p><p>Yun Youzi said, “It's in the inner palace, including the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. With our cultivation levels, we can't even take a step in the outer palace. I wouldn't dare set my sights on it. Time is running out. I still need to prepare some auxiliary items to help us reach the entrance of the inner palace.”</p><p>The inner palace was good.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. If it were the outer palace, it would conflict with his agreement with Granny Jing.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang said, “Senior, just prepare your own. I have a way to reach the entrance of the inner palace. We'll meet inside.”</p><p>“Is that true?”</p><p>Yun Youzi didn't pry into Qin Sang's secrets, but exclaimed joyfully, “That saves me so much time! Brother Qin, you truly are a lucky star. I only hope this trip goes as smoothly as the previous ones!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and eagerly asked, “Senior, please tell me more about the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit…”</p><p>Yun Youzi then remembered, put away his smile, and said seriously, “It’s true that the Violet Palace has the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, but I must warn you! If you fail to form your core, consider this trip as advance scouting. Don't force it.  Wait until you break through to the Core Formation stage, and then participate in the competition for it the next time the Violet Palace opens. Because those competing with you for this fruit will be Demon Core Realm Great Demons from the Heavenly Demon Mound, perhaps more than one!”</p>
