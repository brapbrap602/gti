<h1>Chapter 534: An Example</h1><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily.</p><p>He had sensed something earlier, and after a bold test, his suspicion was confirmed.</p><p>Perhaps his True Essence, imbued with Azure Yang Divineç½¡, shared the same origin as the Azure Yang Demonic Fire. It was surprisingly unaffected by the demonic flames, easily shaking them off upon contact.</p><p>The most feared tactic of Azure Yang Devil Sect cultivators was useless against him.</p><p>To Qin Sang, the Azure Yang Demonic Fire was no different from ordinary spiritual fire.</p><p>This not only allowed him to break through the formation unscathed but also meant that he wouldn't be restrained in his upcoming battle with Wu Youdao, significantly increasing his chances of escape.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the True Essence within his Corpse Pill. Although his fight with Wu Youdao hadn't lasted long, his True Essence was depleting rapidly. He couldn't recover mid-battle and needed to escape before it ran out.</p><p>Before then, he absolutely couldn't show any weakness or let Wu Youdao notice anything amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang burst forth from the flames.</p><p>Everyone, including Wu Youdao, was shocked by this scene.</p><p>The Azure Fire Banner Formation, one of the strongest techniques Azure Yang Devil Sect cultivators could deploy using the Azure Yang Demonic Fire, was supposed to at least hinder Qin Sang, buying time for Wu Youdao to catch up.  Yet, it hadn't had any effect.</p><p>They attributed this to some treasure that protected Qin Sang from fire, unaware of the unique properties of his True Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around.</p><p>Suddenly, he flicked his finger, and the Ebony Wood Sword's energy surged. The sword transformed into a streak of light, slashing out.</p><p>They immediately realized that Qin Sang was trying to destroy the three Azure Banners.</p><p>"Condense!"</p><p>The three cultivators manipulating the banners remained calm in the face of danger.</p><p>The three banners swiftly converged, flames rising from their surfaces to form a fiery barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang attacking the banners instead of fleeing suited their intentions perfectly.</p><p>Although the condensed Azure Yang Demonic Fire from the Azure Fire Banner Formation couldn't burn Qin Sang's True Essence after the initial contact, its inherent power remained, making it difficult to destroy.</p><p>They only needed to hold on for a moment until Elder Wu arrived.</p><p>However, the Ebony Wood Sword ignored the banners completely.  It flashed past the banner formation, blinking successively as it hurtled towards the flying ship above them.</p><p>"No! The ship!"</p><p>Li, the cultivator, reacted instantly and cried out in alarm.</p><p>They had just arrived and immediately received Wu Youdao's order to deploy the Azure Fire Banner Formation.  In their haste, they hadn't had time to retrieve the ship.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword's light blazed like a rainbow piercing the sun, striking the center of the flying ship.</p><p>A deafening explosion echoed as the ship was forced back dozens of meters.  Its spiritual light dimmed dramatically, and a horrifying crack appeared on its port side, almost splitting the entire artifact in two.</p><p>Then, the ship tilted and plummeted from the sky!</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang had decided to target the ship first.</p><p>Destroying the three banners wouldn't solve the problem.  Who knew how many other Azure Yang Devil Sect members possessed such banners?</p><p>But this type of flying ship, which could be controlled by multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators and yet possess a speed rivaling a Core Formation cultivator, was a unique and rare artifact.  The materials required to craft it were as precious as those used for magical treasures.</p><p>Even Shaohua Mountain didn't possess such an artifact, and the Azure Yang Devil Sect likely wouldn't have a second one.</p><p>Destroying the ship would prevent the Foundation Establishment disciples from catching up. He could then create distance and only have to deal with Wu Youdao, instead of facing endless reinforcements.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword struck its target successfully.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare linger, as Wu Youdao was still hot on his heels.</p><p>Wu Youdao had been fooled once and wouldn't fall for the feigned retreat again unless Qin Sang was willing to detonate the Void Thunder.  In such an open area, the Void Thunder would likely only scorch Wu Youdao's clothes.</p><p>Maintaining his speed, Qin Sang suddenly swooped towards the ground, intending to force his way through the Azure Yang Devil Sect disciples' formation to retrieve his storage pouch.</p><p>His target was easy to choose, as he spotted a familiar face.</p><p>Wen Yanjie!</p><p>The coffin on his back made him too conspicuous.</p><p>Almost without hesitation, Qin Sang locked onto Wen Yanjie. His figure flashed repeatedly, bringing him face to face with Wen Yanjie in an instant.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's current appearance was too gruesome for Wen Yanjie to recognize him.</p><p>Wen Yanjie's cultivation ranked among the top five of his fellow disciples, but he was very low-key.</p><p>They were facing a Core Formation expert who could go toe-to-toe with Wu Youdao. If not for Wu Youdao's orders, they would have scattered long ago.</p><p>The more one stood out, the faster one died.</p><p>Wen Yanjie understood this principle well.</p><p>He had initially thought Elder Wu would easily defeat their opponent.</p><p>Never did he expect the situation to change so quickly.  In the blink of an eye, the opponent had easily shaken off Wu Youdao and charged straight at them, leaving them no chance to escape.</p><p>Moreover, the opponent had chosen him out of all the people present!</p><p>At this moment, Wen Yanjie realized how vulnerable he truly was.</p><p>Terror filled Wen Yanjie's face.  The black coffin behind him burst open with a boom, and a dark figure shot out in front of him.</p><p>Seeing Wen Yanjie attempting to block him with the Corpse Refinement he had sold him, Qin Sang sneered inwardly. His right hand transformed into a claw, reaching towards the Corpse Refinement's abdomen at an even faster speed.  He plunged his hand straight into its dantian, his True Essence surging out and instantly destroying its Qi Sea.</p><p>In a split second, they passed each other, and the Corpse Refinement exploded into pieces.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang effortlessly deflected Wen Yanjie's magical weapon, grabbed his neck, and swept his cold gaze across the surrounding cultivators. He suddenly raised his other hand and struck Wen Yanjie's forehead with a chop.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Wen Yanjie's head exploded like a watermelon.  He didn't even have time to groan before dying on the spot.</p><p>White and red splattered everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang casually tossed aside the mangled corpse and said coldly, "Anyone else who dares to block me will end up like him!"</p><p>The faces of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, including Li at the Core Formation stage, changed drastically.  They gasped, instinctively taking a step back.</p><p>The Azure Fire Banner Formation had given them the illusion that they could interfere in a fight between Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>This moment made them realize that with only three banners, they were at best qualified to observe from the sidelines. If Wu Youdao couldn't suppress their opponent, and the opponent went on a rampage, the Azure Fire Banner Formation wouldn't save their lives.</p><p>No one dared to block Qin Sang again.  He smoothly rushed into the forest below, striking the ground with his palm to create a trench. Then, his True Essence wrapped around his storage pouch and other treasures, pulling them out from the earth.</p><p>Scooping the items into his hand, Qin Sang's expression relaxed. He glanced back before continuing to fly forward.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators remained frozen in place, exchanging glances and not daring to pursue.</p><p>Wu Youdao hadn't given up.  Transforming into a streak of light, he continued to pursue Qin Sang relentlessly. The two streaks of light, one after the other, quickly vanished from everyone's sight.</p><p>He knew that these disciples wouldn't be of much help in the short term, so he left behind a single instruction.</p><p>"Li Qing, return to the mountain and check the core forbidden area to see what exactly this person stole! Repair the flying ship as quickly as possible and summon all disciples with Azure Banners to assist me."</p>
