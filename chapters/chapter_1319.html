<h1>Chapter 1311: A Thousand-Year Pact</h1><p>Chapter 1311: A Thousand-Year Pact</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>In the Sky Scar.</p><p>Over a dozen figures sped through the air.</p><p>Their escape techniques were exquisite, rendering the Sky Scar's restrictions meaningless.  The creatures within the Sky Scar, sensing the immense pressure emanating from them, trembled in terror, hiding in their lairs.</p><p>Anyone witnessing these individuals would be astonished, for they were all renowned figures in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Master Cang Hong of the Abyss.</p><p>Master Zhen Yi, the leader of the Sky Walk League.</p><p>The Shadow Demon Lord and Qin Sang of the Small Cold Region.</p><p>Yu Wang, the top expert among the Demons.</p><p>A Lu surname cultivator from the Desert.</p><p>…</p><p>Their destination: the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Experts from various regions traveling together, the atmosphere was surprisingly devoid of tension.</p><p>Following the news of Elder Tian Zheng's death, morale in the Abyss plummeted further. After several rounds of negotiations, they agreed to the harsh terms imposed by the two-region alliance.</p><p>A month ago, the Small Cold Region, the Sky Walk League, and the Abyss swore an oath before Yu City, establishing a thousand-year pact, signaling the official end to a nearly two-hundred-year war.</p><p>The Sky Demon Ridge and the Desert forces also attended the ceremony.</p><p>The Northern Star Realm finally ushered in a hard-won peace!</p><p>With people's minds at ease, after two hundred years of war that almost engulfed the entire Northern Star Realm, the moment the monument bearing the pact was erected, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>But no one dared to relax.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo, having slaughtered a Nascent Soul cultivator and escaped into the God of Sin Palace, had become a common enemy to all factions. This joint venture into the Abyss was precisely for that reason.</p><p>The God of Sin Palace and the Purple Micro Palace held too many secrets. Ye Lao Mo's ambition was immense. After discussion, Master Zhen Yi and the others felt that Ye Lao Mo would undoubtedly be wary of a three-region alliance, making it uncertain whether they could eliminate him. To be safe, they decided to invite the Sky Demon Ridge and Desert cultivators to join them in their next raid on the God of Sin Palace to hunt down Ye Lao Mo!</p><p>Everyone understood that they were no match for Ye Lao Mo individually, and no one could claim sole ownership of the spoils. No matter how important the secrets were, if he couldn't be killed, everything else was moot.</p><p>Later, each faction would share the secrets, and the extent of their achievements would depend on their individual abilities.</p><p>Another reason: it was hard to exclude them.</p><p>The Small Cold Region and the Sky Demon Ridge had an ancient pact regarding the Purple Micro Palace. This time, their unconventional entry through the God of Sin Palace's gate necessitated an explanation to the Sky Demon Ridge.</p><p>The Sky Demon Ridge had consistently provided assistance throughout the war, and it wouldn't be prudent to turn on them now that the situation had improved.</p><p>Moreover, the God of Sin Palace had promised access to the Abyssal Ruins and the God of Sin Palace to the Desert forces during their previous negotiations; hence their easy acceptance.</p><p>For the sake of Ye Lao Mo, the entire Northern Star Realm united as never before.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally advocated for cooperation; he didn't want another Demon Lord to appear in the Northern Star Realm. The Canglang Sea had already suffered from a transformative deity's scheme and the loss of many top experts, barely managing to seal the Demon Lord.</p><p>The Small Cold Region lacked the power to seal a Demon Lord and could only prevent Ye Lao Mo from acting before he could strike.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang ordered Fatty Chicken and the others to continue searching for suitable caves overseas. Furthermore, he postponed the establishment of the Green Sheep Temple again.</p><p>He would make further plans after returning from the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Although the spoils of war allocated to Qin Sang were more than enough to support the development of a sect.</p><p>This time, the Abyss's hidden strengths were exposed, forcing them to repeatedly concede to the aggressive two-region alliance, paying a tremendous price—a significant hemorrhage.</p><p>The Abyss offered the share belonging to Ye Lao Mo and the deceased Nascent Soul cultivators to compensate the two-region alliance for previous losses, but the Nascent Soul cultivators' appetites were far from easily satisfied.</p><p>Qu Huan, for instance, had long coveted the Star Constant Sect's treasure, the Yellow Luo Teng.</p><p>Consequently, Master Cang Hong and the others had to reluctantly offer various treasured items from their collection. Although not crippling, it pushed them close to their limit; they would have to tighten their belts for a while.</p><p>They could only hope that the spoils obtained after eliminating Ye Lao Mo would compensate for their losses.</p><p>Qin Sang's achievements were outstanding among the top experts, granting him the privilege of selecting spoils of war.</p><p>These treasures were exceptionally rare, dazzling and numerous; they included uniquely effective magic tools, ancient treasures passed down from antiquity, and various precious spiritual materials and elixirs.</p><p>Qin Sang treasured each item, deliberating for a long time before deciding to proceed with his plan. His gaze shifted from the ancient treasures to the spiritual materials.</p><p>Ultimately, he selected rare spiritual materials such as the Burning Kui and Winged Fire Liquid.</p><p>All of them, without exception, were fire-attribute spiritual materials.</p><p>Their value, having been treasured by Nascent Soul cultivators, was self-evident.</p><p>They were extremely difficult to find.</p><p>Those old fellows would never easily part with them.</p><p>Qin Sang was preparing to refine a magical artifact to contain the South Ming Li Fire, but he was short of precious materials.  This recent acquisition was a pleasant surprise, making his efforts worthwhile. He planned to visit the Xuling Sect to improve his refining skills before beginning the process.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, what are you pondering?"</p><p>Qin Sang, lost in thought, was startled. Turning, he saw a cultivator surnamed Lu. He knew the man's name was Lu Boyuan.</p><p>After the Yuanxu battle, Lu Boyuan had been severely injured when the Han Lizard self-destructed. Qin Sang hadn't seen him since.</p><p>"Daoist Lu."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "Nothing much, just thinking about Old Devil Ye. Next time the Ziwei Palace appears, it's best not to let low-level cultivators participate."</p><p>If another ancient demon is released, cultivators below the Yuan Ying stage would be of no help; merely easy prey.</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>"Makes sense. Daoist Qin is thoughtful."</p><p>…</p><p>The others agreed with Qin Sang's suggestion, and the matter was settled with a few words.</p><p>"I haven't had a chance to ask, how is Daoist Han Lizard recovering?"</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace to walk alongside Lu Boyuan.</p><p>Lu Boyuan sighed softly, a wry smile playing on his lips.  "Daoist Han Lizard's injuries are extremely severe. Recovery will be difficult. I can only explore other avenues…"</p><p>Before he finished, his sleeve fluttered, and a palm-sized blue ice lizard crawled out. It looked up at Qin Sang and spoke, "Daoist Qin, long time no see.  To hear of your rise to a human Yuan Ying cultivator, it left both me and Daoist Lu quite speechless."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised.</p><p>The ice lizard's aura was subtle, and he couldn't tell how much of its power had been restored.  It seemed to have possessed another ice lizard's body.</p><p>Hearing the Han Lizard's good-natured teasing, Qin Sang glanced at two figures in the distance – the Feather King and the Serpent King.</p><p>The Three Realms War ended so quickly, and due to Old Devil Ye, the human cultivators of the Northern Star Region formed an unprecedented alliance. This was unexpected for the Feather King.</p><p>For the Ten Thousand Demon Mound, internal human unity was not good news, but they had no effective solution.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously disguised himself as a demon king, entering the Wan Yao City to attend the demon king's meeting. When the other demon kings discovered Qin Sang's true identity, they were shocked and enraged.</p><p>The Feather King rarely showed Qin Sang a pleasant expression. Even the Serpent King, who shared a life-or-death bond with Qin Sang, was now extremely cold.</p><p>Fortunately, Jingyu mediated between them, otherwise the Qianshan Bamboo Sea lineage might not be able to survive in the Ten Thousand Demon Mound. As long as Jingyu successfully transcends the tribulation, with the passage of time, the rift should slowly heal.</p>
