<h1>Chapter 493: Desperate Gambit</h1><p>Watching the eerie blood-red sword, a sense of foreboding washed over Priest Jiupao.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword was now inches away from the Ten Yama King Banner.</p><p>A wave of Blood-Corroding Divine Light flashed.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Banner was a large target, and the divine light struck it dead center.</p><p>The demonic flames on the banner's surface suddenly faltered, revealing the artifact's true form. The black banner's luster quickly dimmed, its spiritual essence significantly weakened.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously tested the Blood-Corroding Divine Light's power using the Ten Yama King Banner. Any artifact, regardless of its rank, couldn't avoid its effects.</p><p>However, higher-ranked artifacts were affected for a shorter duration and to a lesser degree.</p><p>Against top-tier artifacts, the Blood-Corroding Divine Light would likely have minimal effect unless Qin Sang refined the Ebony Sword to the same rank.</p><p>But in a battle between experts, even a moment could turn the tide, especially now.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>With the Sword Qi Thunder Sound still active, the Ebony Sword seized the moment the Ten Yama King Banner faltered, forcibly piercing the Nine Nether Demonic Flames. Under Priest Jiupao's horrified gaze, it closed the distance in an instant.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Flying Yaksha followed closely behind.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Banner alone was only a low-grade artifact.</p><p>With its spiritual essence damaged, its power was inferior to the Ebony Sword, becoming less effective. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames, now significantly weakened, no longer deterred the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>Caught off guard, Priest Jiupao struggled to react. However, as a seasoned Gold Core cultivator, he managed a response amidst this life-or-death situation.</p><p>He abruptly swung the Ten Yama King Banner, throwing the artifact itself towards the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>His eyes fixated on the Ebony Sword, spiritual power surging within him. He twisted his body, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow at the last moment.</p><p>A muffled groan.</p><p>The Ebony Sword pierced Priest Jiupao's left chest, drawing a spray of blood.</p><p>The sword qi left within him was mostly forced out by Priest Jiupao before it could fully erupt. The remainder didn't inflict a fatal wound and was quickly suppressed.</p><p>Meanwhile, under the Flying Yaksha's relentless assault, the already damaged artifact suffered further, eventually being knocked away. The banner was torn, rendering it almost useless.</p><p>Priest Jiupao's breath was ragged, his face pale, but the wound wasn't fatal.</p><p>“Blood-Corroding Divine Light!”</p><p>Recognizing the Ebony Sword's unique ability, Priest Jiupao's eyes burned with resentment and envy.</p><p>He couldn't fathom how a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator possessed such treasures. Not only a Flying Yaksha but also an artifact refined from the Eternal Blood-Corroding Mulberry, forcing him into such a desperate situation.</p><p>Even early-stage Gold Core cultivators rarely possessed such wealth.</p><p>At this point, he abandoned any thoughts of counterattack, focused solely on escape.</p><p>But Qin Sang, having finally created this opportunity, wouldn't let him get away.</p><p>He pressed his advantage, directing the Ebony Sword to continue the assault, coordinating with the Flying Yaksha in a pincer attack.</p><p>Quickly sensing Priest Jiupao's intent to retreat, Qin Sang disregarded all caution, commanding the Flying Yaksha to attack relentlessly, even at the cost of enduring the Nine Nether Demonic Flames.</p><p>The onslaught was relentless.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha, fearless of death, clung to Priest Jiupao, leaving no room to breathe.  Now disadvantaged, injured, and without his artifact, Priest Jiupao struggled to cope.</p><p>Demonic qi and death qi clashed and intertwined, creating a destructive aura that ravaged the valley.</p><p>The valley was transformed.</p><p>The peach orchard was destroyed, its beauty obliterated.</p><p>Qin Sang maneuvered the Ebony Sword, supporting the Flying Yaksha in trapping Priest Jiupao. But as the battle intensified, he felt increasingly strained against the Gold Core cultivator.</p><p>He sensed Priest Jiupao's desperation.</p><p>A true Gold Core cultivator, fighting with his back against the wall, his power was terrifying.</p><p>The tide of battle shifted constantly, the Ebony Sword reduced to a supporting role, unable to find an opening for attack.</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently at Priest Jiupao, then suddenly recalled the Ebony Sword. His focus returned to the Ten Yama King Formation, retrieving the Ten Yama King Banner from his storage bag.</p><p>He forced out a mouthful of blood essence, his skin paling.</p><p>The ten primary wraiths materialized, vying for the blood essence.</p><p>Their auras surged as they combined their strength to raise the Ten Yama King Banner.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Flames erupted again, this time under Qin Sang's control!</p><p>He couldn't wield the artifact with the same finesse as Priest Jiupao, but he unleashed the greatest power he could muster, driving a wave of Nine Nether Demonic Flames into the fray.</p><p>“The Ten Yama King Banner!”</p><p>Amidst the chaotic demonic qi came Priest Jiupao's incredulous cry.</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>…</p><p>Priest Jiupao's cries echoed, filled with rage and disbelief, but received no answer.</p><p>Within the depths of the demonic qi, three tornadoes suddenly formed, dispersing the Nine Nether Demonic Flames and pushing back the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>Qin Sang could only vaguely sense Priest Jiupao's state, knowing he was making a final stand. Escape was not an option.</p><p>Disregarding the potential destruction of the Flying Yaksha, he issued a single command: attack!</p><p>The valley shook violently.</p><p>Even Hanshan City, several mountains away, trembled as if a dragon stirred beneath the earth, the river below churning with monstrous waves.</p><p>The city's inhabitants, unaware of the cause, panicked, their hearts filled with unease.</p><p>Atop the City Lord's palace, several figures gazed towards the valley. The most powerful among them, an elderly man with white hair, was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, and his age showed.</p><p>They exchanged glances, faces etched with shock.</p><p>A young man couldn't help but ask, "Patriarch, it's the forbidden area. What's in there? Why is it suddenly…"</p><p>The white-haired elder gripped his staff tightly, veins bulging on his arms. He remained silent, his clouded eyes filled with worry and fear.</p><p>Back in the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was consumed by the fight.</p><p>He reached for his belt, releasing his last three Foundation Establishment late-stage corpse puppets.  They flew directly into the heart of the battle.</p><p>Soon, the connection to the first puppet was severed.</p><p>Then the second!</p><p>And the third!</p><p>All three puppets were destroyed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang felt no regret. His eyes, bloodshot and crazed, remained fixed on the center of the battle.</p><p>He felt himself nearing his limit.  His blood essence depleted, his body weakened, he could barely control the Ten Yama King Banner.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha was repeatedly forced back, only to turn and charge back into the demonic qi each time.</p><p>It too was fighting desperately, its body covered in deep wounds.</p>
