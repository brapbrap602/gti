<h1>Chapter 961: The Azure Pigeon Demon King</h1><p>Yuan Zhu opened his mouth to speak, then suddenly looked towards the edge of the forest, saying, "Look, they're here."</p><p>Qin Sang turned her head and saw several figures flashing from the forest, speeding towards them.</p><p>A quick count revealed six of them!</p><p>A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they arrived.</p><p>Upon seeing them, Qin Sang was shocked.  They were all transformed demons, without exception, and their auras were all suppressed to the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Even the dullest person would realize something was amiss.</p><p>Including Yuan Zhu, there were seven transformed demons in the Seven Killing Hall at once.</p><p>It is said that Yuan Ying stage cultivators need a more powerful type of jade talisman—and in limited numbers—to enter the Seven Killing Hall.  The appearance of so many demons couldn't have gone unnoticed by the chief shaman and Lingzhuzi who controlled the great array.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, carefully observing these transformed beasts.</p><p>Their appearances were indistinguishable from humans, and while they carried demonic energy, it wasn't uncommon in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Of the six figures, two landed first, revealing a man and a woman, both strikingly handsome.</p><p>The woman possessed an elegant air, with a pretty face, a phoenix crown atop her head, and clothing adorned with phoenix-feather-like patterns that were incredibly realistic and beautiful.</p><p>The man was far more simply dressed in a dark robe, a sword at his waist, and a stern expression.</p><p>Seeing them, Yuan Zhu stepped forward, pointing at Qin Sang and introducing her,  "This is Daoist Mingyue from the Azure Pigeon Clan."</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue, this is Daoist Gu Heng from the Jiao Dragon King's clan. And this is Fairy Caiyi, a descendant of the Xuanfeng."</p><p>Yuan Zhu introduced them.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually regained her composure, greeting them calmly.  Hearing their origins, she was secretly shocked.</p><p>Aside from Yuan Zhu and Gu Heng, everyone else was from a different demon clan.</p><p>The transformed demons' behavior and manners were no different from humans.</p><p>The demons clearly followed Gu Heng's lead. He waved his hand, interrupting Yuan Zhu, glancing at Qin Sang, and frowning, "I don't believe I've met Daoist Mingyue before?"</p><p>Yuan Zhu smiled slightly, saying, "There are many Daoists from various clans sent to the Demon Sea, each with their own mission. Not having met is perfectly normal. Daoist Gu, rest assured. We can sense Daoist Mingyue's Xuanjia Talisman, and his demonic aura is sufficient proof of his identity…"</p><p>The demons nodded. Such pure demonic energy couldn't be faked.</p><p>Fairy Caiyi curiously asked, "Since Daoist Mingyue successfully infiltrated, why are you so late?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly concocted a reason, "I inadvertently wandered into an ancient restriction and it took considerable effort to escape."</p><p>"The Seven Killing Hall is filled with ancient restrictions, and many are unfamiliar human restrictions. Accidents happen. Fortunately, there's still plenty of time."</p><p>Yuan Zhu smoothed things over, "As for the other Daoists, I expect their chances are slim. Obtaining the jade talismans isn't easy. And we're in cultivator territory, facing constant danger. With Daoist Mingyue's arrival, we now have eight, enough to complete the task given by the Jiao King. We needn't wait any longer. Daoist Gu Heng, what exactly is the mission? We need to know.  I feel terrible. I don't want to stay another day in cultivator territory. I just want to complete the task and return to break the secret art and regain my true form."</p><p>A burly man behind them grumbled, "Daoist Yuan is right!  In the Demon Sea, we could kill cultivators at will. Since becoming like this, we've had to cower, swallow our anger, and endure this humiliation!"</p><p>…</p><p>The demons echoed his sentiments, voicing their complaints.</p><p>Gu Heng sighed.</p><p>"I feel the same, Gu Heng said.  Thankfully, once this mission is complete, we'll be free.  Our respective Kings have promised to restore us to our true forms and personally help those who have made great contributions to transform.</p><p>"The mission is simple.</p><p>"After the Daoists returned to their clans last time, the reports were carefully reviewed by the Kings, and three locations were selected. We are to place a spirit array in one of them.</p><p>"To ensure success, Fairy Caiyi and I each carry one set of the necessary materials. Since we are both here, we shouldn't encounter any problems."</p><p>After Gu Heng finished, the demons exchanged glances. One of them asked, "What kind of spirit array?  I heard that humanity is flourishing, and the Seven Killing Hall is connected to this. Does King Jiao intend to destroy this human holy land?"</p><p>"We don't know the spirit array's function. It's an ancient and mysterious array, and we only know how to set it up. But the Seven Killing Hall is full of countless immortal restrictions. A mere spirit array, placed in the outer hall, shouldn't be able to destroy this place, should it?"</p><p>Fairy Caiyi said hesitantly.</p><p>"Why bother with the purpose of the spirit array? We are weak, not qualified to participate in the Yao Wang's plot. We just need to follow orders."</p><p>Yuan Zhu impatiently asked, "Friend Gu, where will the array be set up?"</p><p>Gu Heng glanced at the nearby Flower Fairy Lake.  "The Jiao Wang wants us to set up the spirit array in a hidden location with ancient restrictions that can block the fluctuations during the setup.  There are some other requirements too. Only three places barely meet all the conditions.  There's a reason why you've all been called here; one of these locations is in Flower Fairy Lake."</p><p>"Flower Fairy Lake?"</p><p>The demons looked at the toxic land with varying expressions.</p><p>Yuan Zhu suddenly said to Qin Sang, "Friend Mingyue, did you report this location? You're from the Bi Jiu clan; you must be able to move freely in and around Flower Fairy Lake."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>After hearing all this, he had figured it out.</p><p>These demons weren't transformed late-stage demons; they had used some unknown secret technique to transform into human forms, exploiting a loophole in the Sha Yao Dan, and had infiltrated the Cang Lang Sea, plotting against the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>He secretly regretted his earlier self-doubt and missed opportunity.</p><p>The hook-nosed man who died by the Dong Ming Cold Flame Fire Pearl was most likely a Bi Jiu.  He was also a spy sent into the Cang Lang Sea, which explains his extremely strong physique, ability to spit poison mist, and lack of magical treasures beyond the Xuan Jia Talisman, bone flute, and star conch.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't understand.</p><p>The Bi Jiu had clearly died at his hands; why were these demons completely unaware?</p><p>He didn't know that the Bi Jiu Yao Wang, to avoid trouble, had secretly concealed the Bi Jiu's death. What he had reported to the Jiao Wang were several fabricated stories based on unreliable rumors gathered from human cultivators.</p><p>Even knowing these demons weren't transformed late-stage demons, Qin Sang still dared not act rashly.</p><p>Yuan Zhu and the others, even the weakest, were at least in the late Yao Dan stage.</p><p>What worried Qin Sang even more was the escape technique that Gu Heng and the Cai Yi Fairy had just displayed; it was no less impressive than his own.</p>
