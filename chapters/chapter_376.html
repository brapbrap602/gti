Chapter 369: Hunting Ghosts


The sounds of monstrous roars and screams were close at hand.


Everyone moved silently through the valley, occasionally glancing upwards.  A chilling wind howled from the mountain, and ghostly figures flickered in the shadows. They suppressed the fluctuations of their protective talismans, unable to use escape techniques and forced to proceed on foot.


A river of blood flowed from the mountain's depths. The gentle current was tainted by a bloody miasma, crimson as blood.


The river undoubtedly contained toxins far more potent than the miasma.  Everyone walked cautiously along the riverbank, picking their way across the uneven stones, fearful of alarming any ghosts, proceeding with painstaking care and difficulty.


"There's a hidden passage leading into the mountain; its exit is opposite the ghost nest.  There are stray ghosts inside the passage, mostly solitary and not very powerful. When we encounter them, we attack together, quickly and decisively; don't give them a chance to summon reinforcements.”


Kong Xin stood before the entrance to the mountain, observing for a moment before transmitting his instructions to everyone.  With a sweeping gesture, he was the first to enter.


The others quickly followed.


Inside the mountain, the blood miasma was only slightly less dense. Fortunately, none of them were ordinary people; they could still make out the path ahead.


The deeper they went, the narrower the passage became, the walls jagged and offering few places to set a foot.  Without Kong Xin's command, they dared not use their movement techniques, making progress even more arduous.


Just as everyone began to feel impatient, a fork appeared ahead.


"This way!"


Kong Xin, clearly familiar with the area, changed direction without hesitation.


They proceeded in single file. Upon seeing what lay ahead, they breathed a sigh of relief. This passage lacked an underground river. Although winding and uneven, it was far easier to navigate than the outside.


Kong Xin led the way, the master and disciple walked in the middle, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi brought up the rear.


This was their own decision. Firstly, they worked together most effectively.  Secondly, if danger appeared, they would provide a buffer.


Initially, everyone feared a surprise attack by ghosts and proceeded slowly, bracing themselves.


As time passed, and as Kong Xin had predicted, they were nearing the middle of the passage and had only encountered a few weak ghost soldiers, quickly dispatched.


Gradually, their courage grew, and they quickened their pace.


Kong Xin transmitted a message:  "We're almost at the deepest part of the mountain; there's a cavern, very vast – at least I couldn't determine its full extent. Many ghosts are probably lurking inside. Fortunately, we just need to follow the edge of the cavern, and we'll soon reach another passage and exit from there."


Before Kong Xin finished speaking, the path suddenly disappeared.  Upon closer inspection, they saw that the passage ended at a low cliff.


The cliff face was shrouded in blood miasma, its bottom unseen.  It was indeed, as Kong Xin had said, a cavern.


"Follow me!"


Kong Xin stepped onto a protruding rock on the cliff and gracefully descended.  The others followed suit without hesitation.


Soon, they were on solid ground.  After ensuring the area was clear, they walked along the cliff wall.


"Careful!"


Sun Xin suddenly stopped, shouting softly, gripping his talisman, and pointing forward with the other hand. A nine-tiered pagoda-shaped artifact shot forward as a beam of light.


Then, the blood miasma churned. The originally palm-sized nine-tiered pagoda expanded to human height, floating steadily in mid-air.  A clear light shone down from the pagoda, firmly trapping a ferocious ghost below.


This ghost had two horns on its head and a fearsome appearance.


Despite being subdued by the pagoda, the ghost struggled violently, roaring in rage.  Fortunately, the pagoda blocked its sound, preventing it from alarming more ghosts.


Even Kong Xin's artifact couldn't easily subdue it. This ghost's power was only slightly weaker than a Foundation Establishment cultivator; the strongest opponent they had encountered in Wuyaya Valley.


'Whoosh!'


A flash of white light.


The source of the light was a needle-like artifact, thin as a hair.


Surprisingly, this seemingly insignificant artifact pierced the ghost, and combined with Kong Xin's nine-tiered pagoda, killed it.  Then, it spun, returning to the red-clothed woman's hand.


After the ghost's death, it turned into a puff of blood energy, merging into the blood miasma.


Kong Xin retracted his nine-tiered pagoda and bowed slightly to the red-clothed woman. "Thank you for your timely assistance, Daoist friend."


The red-clothed woman responded casually, "Without me, Daoist Kong would have easily captured this fiend. I simply didn't want to waste too much time.  The existence of such a powerful ghost shows the passage isn't as safe as you said.  Lead the way quickly to avoid further incidents."


The woman in red sneered, clearly displeased by Kong Xin's earlier concealment.

Kong Xin remained impassive.  "Don't worry, friend.  The strongest demons I've encountered on my previous visits were nothing more than this. There won't be..."

As if challenging Sun, before he could finish, Yun Youzi, who had been at the rear, suddenly paled, spun around, and hissed, "More!"

Qin Sang reacted instantly. Trusting Yun Youzi's instincts, he immediately swung his right palm, launching a golden beam of light into the blood miasma.

*Swish!*

The Spirit Binding Cord ensnared a demon.

This demon was roughly as strong as the previous one.  Qin Sang, concealing his cultivation, hadn't used his full power, so the cord couldn't completely subdue it.

Fortunately, Yun Youzi had already attacked, killing the demon with his flying sword.

Without looking at the slain demon, Qin Sang unleashed another dark projectile from his palm – a square, black stone – which smashed into another area with thunderous force.

Only after the Black Dragon Stone struck did they see a surge of blood energy rise from beneath it, merging with the miasma. That demon had been killed by the stone before even fully materializing.

Upon entering the Wuyagu Valley, Qin Sang had already prepared Liang Yan's Black Dragon Stone and Spirit Binding Cord.  The valley's demonic creatures resisted poisons, rendering the Heavenly Poison Gauze ineffective, and the Yin-Yang Compass lacked killing power. Liang Yan's artifacts, however, proved quite handy.

Seeing Qin Sang produce two powerful artifacts, one after another, the others' expressions changed, revealing a hint of apprehension.

Suddenly, the blood miasma churned, and several shadowy figures lunged towards them.

More demons had been roused by the fighting.

There were over a dozen, varying in strength, but none stronger than the previous three, remaining within the group's capabilities.

Everyone fought back, slaying demons one after another, but remained vigilant.  They couldn't stay long; a prolonged fight risked attracting even more.

Sun quickly accelerated their pace, and they fought their way back, finally spotting a narrow passage in the stone wall ahead.
