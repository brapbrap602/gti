<h1>Chapter 659: Capture</h1><p>Chapter 659: Capture</p><p>Seeing the bone claw strike forcefully at the ebony sword, a strange light emanating from the sword, Qin Sang swiftly made a decision.  With a quick incantation, the ebony sword shimmered and instantly transformed into two identical sword lights.</p><p>Both sword lights appeared real, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>"Sword Light Divergence!"</p><p>Du Han's scalp tingled.</p><p>He never imagined that a technique so diligently sought after by sword cultivators would be used by someone before him, and this person was clearly a newly-formed Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>The two sword lights raced alongside each other, evading the bone claw.</p><p>Even with his keen eyesight, he couldn't discern the true sword from the illusion.</p><p>Without hesitation, Du Han gambled, sending the bone claw towards one of the lights while quickly retrieving a round mirror from his storage pouch.</p><p>The mirror's material was unknown, completely black.  Both the mirror's surface and frame shone with an obsidian-like luster, seamlessly integrated.</p><p>This was a treasure bestowed upon him by the Li Witch Palace after his Golden Core breakthrough – the Black Water Mirror.</p><p>Originally a high-quality lower-grade magical artifact, Du Han had later incorporated a top-grade ore into it. While it hadn't advanced to a mid-grade artifact, its power was among the best of lower-grade artifacts.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The bone claw successfully grasped one sword light.</p><p>But that light struggled briefly before shattering – the illusion.</p><p>The other was the true sword.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ebony sword was mere inches from Du Han.</p><p>His bone claw couldn't react in time. Luckily, Du Han was prepared.  Ignoring the claw, he frantically activated the Black Water Mirror, blocking the sword.</p><p>Black liquid seemed to flow on the mirror's surface, undulating before forming a black streak that shot out, wrapping around the ebony sword.</p><p>Suddenly, Du Han cried out, stamping his foot and darting away.</p><p>The next moment, a black ghost claw passed through his chest.</p><p>Behind him, the Flying Night Rakshasa, taking advantage of the chaos, finally found an opportunity to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang had positioned the Flying Night Rakshasa in hiding, initially intending to kill Du Han's life-bound insect. Upon discovering Du Han lacked such an insect, the plan changed to a direct attack.</p><p>The strike appeared successful.</p><p>But the Flying Night Rakshasa's hand was clean, and Du Han's body began to fade, revealing a small figure woven from some kind of straw.</p><p>The figure, only palm-sized, was a perfect miniature of Du Han.</p><p>Pain contorted the figure's face before it shattered into dust.</p><p>Du Han reappeared a short distance away, his chest rising and falling, unharmed.  His expression was shocked, clearly frightened by the attack, his body drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>“Some kind of substitute puppet technique?”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  This man was truly difficult, employing countless bizarre methods, constantly finding ways out of seemingly lethal situations.</p><p>Despite the failed attack, Qin Sang felt no frustration.  She lightly tapped the ebony sword.</p><p>The sword’s blade quickly turned crimson, and a bloody light shot towards the Black Water Mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang had saved the Blood-秽 Divine Light for this very moment, targeting the Black Water Mirror.</p><p>Though the ghost claw was Du Han's life-bound treasure, its quality was inferior to the Black Water Mirror.  The mirror was Du Han's strongest artifact and Qin Sang's biggest threat.</p><p>She had waited to disable it.</p><p>Without the Black Water Mirror, Du Han would lose his greatest support.  Regardless of his cultivation, he wouldn't escape Qin Sang’s grasp.</p><p>Du Han, his mind wavering, could only watch helplessly as the mirror was engulfed in the strange bloody light, instantly feeling a disruption in his connection with it.</p><p>The Black Water Mirror's light dimmed considerably, its power greatly diminished, swaying precariously in the air.</p><p>Du Han, greatly alarmed, tried to retrieve the mirror, when he caught sight of a bloody shadow.  The Flying Night Rakshasa, after its unsuccessful attack, swiftly killed Du Han's disciple, throwing the body at Du Han before closing in.</p><p>Knowing the Rakshasa’s ferocity, Du Han painfully relinquished the Black Water Mirror, swiftly retracting his bone claw to strike at the Rakshasa.</p><p>Having lost his invaluable substitute straw puppet and the Black Water Mirror, Du Han's fighting spirit vanished.  He no longer had the will to kill Qin Sang, only the desire to escape.</p><p>The array of treasures Qin Sang displayed gave Du Han the feeling of facing an ancient monster; even seasoned Golden Core cultivators rarely possessed such terrifying abilities.</p><p>Is this truly someone who only recently achieved Golden Core?</p><p>No wonder this person doesn't have a soul-linked insect Gu; they clearly possess a soul-linked treasure!</p><p>Du Han felt immense regret, desperately trying to escape while cursing his disciples for their incompetence.</p><p>But Qin Sang, having prepared for so long, wouldn't let him get away.</p><p>After destroying the Black Water Mirror, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  She immediately retracted her ebony sword, flicked her wrist, and three small banners spun out from her palm, deploying in mid-air.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banners swelled to several meters high. The surrounding temperature plummeted; even in the bright sunlight, a chilling aura filled the air.</p><p>Qin Sang poured all her power into activating the Ten Directions Yama Array. Since achieving Golden Core, she had diligently practiced her sword beam splitting technique and familiarized herself with the Ten Directions Yama Banners.  The sword beam splitting technique was already showing results, at least it was effective in confusing her opponent.</p><p>However, the Ten Directions Yama Array still required some preparation time.</p><p>"What kind of evil artifact is this?"</p><p>The appearance of the Ten Directions Yama Banners once again shattered Du Han's understanding.</p><p>He was proficient in formations and immediately recognized that it was a powerful array formed by three artifacts; its power was undoubtedly formidable.</p><p>Du Han's fear intensified. He felt death approaching and used every trick he knew to escape the Flying Night Rakshasa, even deciding to abandon his own soul-linked treasure.</p><p>Talismans and Daoist techniques flew together.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa, with its thick hide, ignored the attacks, clinging tightly to Du Han. With its physical strength, it could withstand the bone claw attacks, buying Qin Sang the time she needed to prepare the banner array.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang rapidly changed hand seals, finally completing the array!</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A violent wind arose.</p><p>Instantly, an icy wind swept through, and the surroundings darkened.  </p><p>On the surface of the three ghost banners, it was as if there were black holes; extremely frigid black flames surged out from within, converging in the center into an even deeper, darker mass.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at Du Han, her eyes icy.</p><p>She had saved the Ten Directions Yama Banners for last to ensure the capture of her opponent.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire transformed into a fiery dragon, lunging at Du Han.  Du Han frantically controlled his bone claw to fight off the combined assault of the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa, desperately trying to survive.</p><p>Finally, with a loud cracking sound, the bone claw shattered, consumed by the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Du Han fell into despair.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't even give him a chance to commit suicide.</p><p>After being engulfed by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, Du Han's consciousness blurred. When he regained awareness, he found himself with a hand gripping his throat.</p>
