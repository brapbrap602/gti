<h1>Chapter 1154: Nascent Soul Formation (Part 2)</h1><p>Chapter 1154: Nascent Soul Formation (Part 2)</p><p>Within the Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor had long been torn apart by the tribulation wind.  The jade Buddha shone with golden light, firmly blocking the wind, protecting Qin Sang's primordial spirit. He could let the tribulation wind in, as before, to refine his primordial spirit and gain benefits.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't do that.</p><p>Firstly, after forming his Nascent Soul, he should be able to cultivate the Fire Seed Golden Lotus, and wouldn't lack opportunities for refinement.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang had a bad feeling; the tribulation might change!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was extremely serious. Regardless of how rampant the tribulation wind was, he opened his eyes and looked up at the heavens.</p><p>Yun Youzi was a fusion of demonic and human souls.</p><p>But Qin Sang wasn't; his situation was closer to body snatching.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that Yun Youzi had said that he must pass this tribulation to gain Heavenly Dao's acknowledgment.</p><p>Could it be that those who seize bodies are despised by the Heavenly Dao, are unacceptable to Heaven and Earth, considered to be acting against Heaven?  During their first tribulation, would the power increase dramatically, making this a must-pass hurdle?</p><p>Fail, and perish.</p><p>Succeed, and it's like a rebirth, gaining the Heavenly Dao's recognition.</p><p>Or, is it only those like him and Yun Youzi, these anomalies, who will experience this?</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he quickly suppressed them.  Thinking wouldn't help now; he had to do his best to meet the tribulation head-on!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The tribulation wind's power grew stronger and stronger, but it was still unable to shake the jade Buddha. Finally, after a period of sustained peak intensity, it dissipated.</p><p>Outside, everyone noticed the abnormality.</p><p>Li Yu'fu recalled the similar scene during Yun Youzi's tribulation, and a bad feeling rose in his heart. He hurriedly flew to Bai's side, his face full of panic.</p><p>“Senior…”</p><p>Bai shook his head, staring at the tribulation clouds without speaking.</p><p>Finally, the tribulation wind dissipated.</p><p>The tribulation clouds gathered; the dark clouds transformed into tribulation clouds.  Arcs of lightning, like dragons, traveled through the clouds. Countless lightning bolts converged, and the tribulation clouds grew at a visible speed.</p><p>Gradually, the thunder in the tribulation clouds turned green; the tribulation thunder appeared!</p><p>Bai and Li Yu'fu stared intently at the center of the tribulation clouds, afraid that a tragedy would repeat itself, that golden light or other colored lightning would appear. Fortunately, until the green tribulation thunder filled and the tribulation clouds formed, nothing unusual happened.</p><p>Li Yu'fu's heart was in his throat.</p><p>He couldn't help but suspect that Qin Sang might have a similar origin to Yun Youzi, otherwise, why was their relationship so good? Such friendship wasn't common in the cultivation world.</p><p>“Phew, phew…”</p><p>Li Yu'fu saw only single-colored tribulation clouds, and his nervousness eased slightly.</p><p>Bai said in a deep voice: “Everyone's tribulation is not exactly the same. Your master uncle may have done something to cause the tribulation wind to change. However, how powerful this tribulation thunder will be is still hard to say…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the tribulation clouds, instantly brewing a bolt of tribulation thunder.  The moment it appeared, it pierced the void like a sword and struck downwards!</p><p>On the small island.</p><p>The protective formation created a curtain of light.</p><p>The tribulation thunder struck the spiritual array violently. The light curtain violently shook, dissipating some of the tribulation thunder's power, before finally being torn apart.</p><p>Qin Sang had unknowingly summoned the ebony sword. Seeing this, he moved his mind, and the ebony sword split into dozens of sword lights, swirling upwards, annihilating the remaining tribulation thunder power.</p><p>The light curtain swayed a few times before reforming.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the power of the Heavenly Tribulation during Yun Youzi's tribulation, and silently compared it.  He felt his tribulation thunder's power was less than the two-colored thunder; perhaps he was overthinking.</p><p>The tribulation clouds continued relentlessly; tribulation thunder fell like rain.</p><p>The ebony sword moved restlessly, actively attacking, dispersing the lightning that pierced the spiritual array.</p><p>The Heaven-Eye Butterfly also flew out from his Qi Sea and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu tortoise shell covered Qin Sang's body as a last resort, blocking the scattered strands of lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang tried releasing the Heaven-Eye Butterfly, letting it absorb the lightning strands to improve its abilities; the tribulation thunder didn't change because of this.</p><p>The great inheritance of the Witch Clan truly had its merits.  His life-bound insect and he were one; it wasn't considered an outside helper by the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang nodded secretly, then focused on dealing with the tribulation.</p><p>‘Rumble… boom…’</p><p>The thunder rumbled incessantly; Qin Sang could hear no other sounds. His vision was filled with dazzling green lightning.</p><p>Wave after wave of tribulation thunder struck, its power increasing with each strike, causing the spiritual array's light shield to tremble and falter.</p><p>Initially, the ebony sword's transformed sword light could barely cope. Now, Qin Sang had already taken pills to restore his true energy, and was forced to use his sword array to deal with the tribulation thunder.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Another tribulation thunder.</p><p>The tribulation clouds remained thick, with no end in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He manipulated his sword, and the sword formation erupted in a column of light, surging upwards to meet the tribulation thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Finally, the protective formation reached its limit and collapsed, the enchanted artifacts turning to ash.  The tribulation thunder broke through the sword array, carrying its destructive force towards Qin Sang's head.  He snorted coldly, instantly activating his Heavenly Demon Transformation, wings vibrating as he countered the attack with a powerful upward punch.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of fist shadows appeared.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>With a roar, the tribulation thunder dissipated.  The sky lit up like day, a figure bathed in lightning appearing in mid-air.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze. Qin Sang's fists glowed, having shattered the tribulation thunder!</p><p>However, the tribulation clouds showed no mercy, and more thunderbolts followed.</p><p>Using his powerful body and the sword array, Qin Sang repeatedly dispersed the thunderbolts.  Like a demon god, he was repeatedly struck down, yet relentlessly charged towards the tribulation clouds, battling the heavenly tribulation, never yielding.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang sensed something was wrong. His tribulation, while not a two-colored one, had far more thunderbolts than Yun Youzi's, and it still wasn't over.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave. Taking advantage of a lull, he swallowed a pill and persevered.  The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also used its abilities to aid its master in overcoming the tribulation.</p><p>One thunderbolt after another, each stronger than the last, was shattered by Qin Sang.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The thunder in the tribulation clouds roared like an angry god, enraged by this tenacious little insect.</p><p>At that moment, the tribulation clouds suddenly stopped rotating.  An intense green light erupted, all the thunder energy coalescing into a single thunderbolt, a final roar unleashed.</p><p>"The last one!"</p><p>Seeing the massive lightning bolt approaching, Qin Sang's heart tightened.  For safety, he took a Mist Encompassing Pill, flicking his fingers, and twelve demonic banners sprang from the ground, instantly forming an array.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire burned fiercely, blocking above Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, the tribulation thunder collided with the demon flames!</p><p>A sizzling sound filled the air.</p><p>The two forces clashed and cancelled each other out. The demon flames couldn't hold, torn apart by the tribulation thunder.</p><p>The remaining power was still formidable. Qin Sang roared, pushing his Heavenly Demon Transformation to its limit, his veins bulging, bones cracking as he struck the tribulation thunder.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed, a layer of the mountain peak was sheared away, and Qin Sang, blackened all over, rose to his feet.</p><p>The heart demon tribulation still awaited.  Ignoring his injuries, he quickly sat cross-legged to calm his mind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no heart demon appeared.</p><p>Everything seemed normal.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sensed Li Yu Fu and the others rushing towards him, leaving him somewhat confused.</p><p>***</p>
