<h1>Chapter 1742: The Dragon Transformation Pool</h1><p>If he could refine the Kirin Origin Seed, it would bring him endless benefits. Even without Vermilion Bird's reminder, Qin Sang was well aware that the primordial essence of an ancient powerhouse was not something easily seized—there must be protective measures in place. Even if he could locate it using the Kirin Origin Seed, it was beyond the capabilities of a mere Nascent Soul cultivator like him. If he were to be blinded by greed, death would not be far off.</p><p>The only thing Qin Sang was curious about now was where the Kirin's primordial essence was hidden. He hoped it was in this realm, just like the Kirin Origin Seed. Since there were no cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage in this realm, he wouldn't have to worry about someone else claiming it first, no matter how long the Kirin's essence had been dormant. Once his cultivation reached a sufficient level, he might even gain the ability to break through realms and retrieve the treasure.</p><p>But such thoughts were premature. Qin Sang cleared his mind and, following Vermilion Bird's guidance, focused on sensing the Kirin Origin Seed. In his eyes, it was nothing more than an unremarkable transparent lotus seed. No matter how many times he scanned it with his divine sense, he couldn't detect anything extraordinary.</p><p>Following Vermilion Bird's method, Qin Sang stirred his divine sense and noticed something different within the seed. Vermilion Bird had made it sound simple, but perhaps due to their differing races, Qin Sang found the process extremely difficult. He dared not relax for even a moment, carefully peeling back layer after layer like unraveling a cocoon, slowly infiltrating the Kirin Origin Seed until he sensed a strange power within its core.</p><p>According to Vermilion Bird, this power was the essence within the Kirin Origin Seed, but Qin Sang still couldn't detect any spiritual fluctuations. This was the profound mystery of the ancient divine beast's methods. When the Kirin Origin Seed was dormant, it was as if it were truly dead. Even someone cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique wouldn't notice it until the seed began to awaken within their body.</p><p>Qin Sang could only vaguely sense it, unable to manipulate the essence within the seed. He guessed that there must be restrictions left by the Kirin during its lifetime. Vermilion Bird, at its peak, might have been able to easily seize it, but now it couldn't directly absorb the essence either.</p><p>Vermilion Bird's method was simple in theory: use the Kirin's own methods against it. Qin Sang would need to use the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique to absorb the Kirin Origin Seed into his body, suppress the Kirin's true spirit, and then extract the essence while it was still dormant.</p><p>However, executing this was far from easy. Qin Sang pondered for several days, consulting Vermilion Bird frequently, before he dared to act.</p><p>A fire lotus emerged from between his brows and hovered before him. At the same time, a strand of divine sense guided the Kirin Origin Seed, slowly floating toward the fire lotus and stopping about three inches above it. Although he hadn't yet perfected the second layer of the technique, the petals at the center of the fire lotus were tightly closed. Yet, a thin thread of flame rose from the lotus, coiling around the surface of the Kirin Origin Seed. Black flames spread out, enveloping the seed.</p><p>The Sun Divine Tree stood beside Qin Sang, its branches adorned with nine divine birds that gazed upward with envy and resentment.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were fixed on the Kirin Origin Seed as his thoughts raced, his hand seals changing fluidly like flowing water. The flames on the seed surged and twisted, and fiery runes emerged, flashing before sinking into the seed. Finally, the Kirin Origin Seed trembled, as if pulled downward by the thread of flame. It continued to descend, passing through the lotus bud without resistance and sinking into the lotus heart!</p><p>Up to this point, Qin Sang had been using the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique to reintegrate the Kirin Origin Seed into the fire lotus. The next step was the most critical.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as his divine sense surged from between his brows, filling the cabin with an invisible wave of power. A vast, majestic force gathered in the air, swirling before converging into the fire lotus.</p><p>The flames blazed brighter!</p><p>The fire lotus trembled slightly, its petals quivering. On the surface, it appeared calm.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense poured into the fire lotus like a tide, transforming into countless invisible spiritual seals that merged into the Kirin Origin Seed. Before long, beads of sweat appeared on Qin Sang's temples, a clear sign that this was no easy task.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang finally let out a long breath. The fire lotus trembled and returned to normal.</p><p>The Sun Divine Birds pouted in unison. Vermilion Bird had been hoping Qin Sang would fail and need its help, allowing it to demand some benefits. Unfortunately, things hadn't gone as it wished.</p><p>The fire lotus floated into Qin Sang's palm. He didn't rush to rest and recover, instead focusing intently on the lotus heart. He sensed something new within it, but it was seamlessly integrated with the fire lotus, showing no abnormalities.</p><p>Absorbing the essence of the seed was not something that could be done overnight, but the smooth completion of this step gave Qin Sang great confidence. The only drawback was that he had to constantly maintain his divine sense to keep the technique active.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang stored the fire lotus and turned his gaze to the Sun Divine Tree. "How do I hand over the Heavenly Phoenix Feather to you?" he asked.</p><p>With the Kirin Origin Seed now within him, Qin Sang couldn't continue refining spiritual fire or cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" during this period. However, once this was done, he would make significant progress, far faster than if he followed the usual cultivation path.</p><p>In the meantime, he decided to fulfill his promise and give the Heavenly Phoenix Feather to Vermilion Bird, allowing it to study it thoroughly. When the time came, it could directly provide him with Phoenix True Fire.</p><p>Vermilion Bird, which had been feeling down, perked up at the question. "It's simple," it said eagerly. "Just insert it into the tree, where I reside. I'll handle the rest."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, glancing at the divine birds perched on the branches. "Won't this affect the Sun Divine Tree?"</p><p>So far, the Sun Divine Tree remained his most powerful tool, and he couldn't afford any mistakes.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Feather was stored beneath the tree, suppressed by a green copper block and a turtle shell. It wasn't a spatial treasure, and the confined space was filled with the violent Southern Brightness Fire, barely maintaining a delicate balance. If the Heavenly Phoenix Feather were to be inserted, and the two true fires clashed, destroying the Sun Divine Tree, it would be a devastating loss.</p><p>"Don't worry," Vermilion Bird said confidently, though its tone was tinged with impatience. "Although I can't control the true fire, I've learned to restrain it over the years. The feather is severely damaged, and its true fire has been dormant for a long time. As long as we don't provoke it too much, nothing will go wrong. If I can't suppress it, you can always take it out."</p><p>Vermilion Bird was very confident, and Qin Sang had promised to share some of the Phoenix True Fire with it.</p><p>Qin Sang remained skeptical. The young spirit's words and actions were hard to trust. He pressed for more details until he was satisfied that Vermilion Bird had a clear plan. Nodding slightly, he summoned the Sun Divine Tree and retrieved the Heavenly Phoenix Feather.</p><p>With Vermilion Bird's assistance, Qin Sang could sense the interior of the Sun Divine Tree, which had changed significantly since its creation. Qin Sang could hardly find any traces of his own craftsmanship. The tree had been tempered by the Southern Brightness Fire for so long that it was almost unrecognizable.</p><p>Apart from the green copper block, which seemed unchanged, the mysterious white copper, the Nine-Life Mystic Turtle's shell, and other auxiliary materials had all been fused together, making it impossible to distinguish their original forms.</p><p>The power of the Southern Brightness Fire constantly circulated within the Sun Divine Tree. In the future, when Vermilion Bird regained its strength and no longer needed the tree to suppress the true fire, this artifact would become a rare treasure, if not a supreme one.</p><p>"Qin Sang, I'm here," a clear, childlike voice echoed in Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>Though its strength was lacking, Vermilion Bird retained the pride of its kind. It didn't see itself as a dependent but as an equal partner in their alliance, hence it addressed Qin Sang by name without any deference.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind this, as long as it was useful to him.</p><p>At this moment, he vaguely sensed a feather within the Southern Brightness Fire, with the faint outline of a fiery bird appearing on it—though it was unclear. This was the young spirit of Vermilion Bird, barely able to manifest itself.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, then instructed Vermilion Bird to follow his directions. Vermilion Bird complied without hesitation.</p><p>The cabin's light flickered as the flames danced.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang nodded and pressed the Heavenly Phoenix Feather into the space beneath the green copper block where the Vermilion Bird Feather resided.</p><p>The Southern Brightness Fire calmed slightly.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather didn't sink into the flames but clung tightly to the green copper block. A subtle fluctuation indicated that Vermilion Bird had extended its power to the feather.</p><p>Seeing that the Sun Divine Tree remained stable, Qin Sang felt somewhat relieved.</p><p>...</p><p>The dharma boat remained near the Dragon Ancestral Land for a full month.</p><p>During this time, all the major demon tribes with the authority to make decisions received summons from the Dragon King to gather for discussions.</p><p>The demon kings, intimidated by Qin Sang's power, dared not approach the Dragon Ancestral Land. Instead, they were arranged by the Dragon King to meet in an underwater palace.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar sat cross-legged at the bow of the boat, cultivating in silence, while his true self remained in the cabin, not urging anyone.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>The two demon kings leading the Dragon King's guards suddenly exchanged glances, as if receiving some command. Their voices boomed like thunder, directed toward the dharma boat.</p><p>"Reporting to the True Monarch, our king has a matter to discuss."</p><p>The avatar opened its eyes. "Speak."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang's true self didn't emerge from the cabin, the two demon kings didn't dare to comment. They conjured a water mirror, revealing the Dragon King and the Phoenix King standing beside him.</p><p>The Dragon King, already aware of the avatar's identity, didn't waste words. "Is the True Monarch willing to swear an oath first?"</p><p>The avatar smiled. "It seems you've reached a decision. Swearing an oath is no trouble. Set up the Karmic Altar."</p><p>"The altar is already prepared!"</p><p>The Dragon King silently issued a command.</p><p>Soon, waves surged before the dharma boat as several dragons emerged, carrying a golden platform a hundred feet long and wide.</p><p>The avatar examined it briefly, then nodded slightly and awakened the true self.</p><p>Qin Sang's true self emerged from meditation and gracefully ascended the altar. Seeing the meticulously prepared oath inscribed on it, he smiled faintly, unconcerned, and swore the karmic oath in full view of everyone.</p><p>The Dragon King and Phoenix King watched through the water mirror, their expressions easing only after Qin Sang completed the oath.</p><p>True to his role as the ruler of a tribe, the Dragon King then left the Ancestral Land and boarded the dharma boat.</p><p>Seeing this king, whose presence surpassed that of the previous Dragon King, Qin Sang couldn't help but praise, "Your courage is commendable."</p><p>The Dragon King clasped his fists and said in a deep voice, "Since the True Monarch cannot ascend, we cannot remain confined to the Ancestral Land forever. I trust the True Monarch wouldn't deceive me and break the karmic oath. From now on, our tribes will spare no effort in searching for the Ascension Platform. If we discover anything else, we will not hide it from the True Monarch."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction. "I am pleased to see you resolve your conflicts and work together to find a way forward for the cultivators of this realm. Next, I will visit the Witch God Mountain. The Witch Tribe, like the Human Tribe, will restrain their actions."</p><p>The two discussed the details further.</p><p>Although only the Dragon King had appeared, the other demon kings were watching from afar. Qin Sang was effectively negotiating with the entire demon sea.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't make excessive demands, and the discussions proceeded smoothly.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang smiled and said, "The Dragon Tribe's physical strength far surpasses that of other tribes. I've heard rumors of a secret place in your Ancestral Land that has miraculous effects on tempering the body. Is this true?"</p><p>The Dragon King's expression changed, his gaze turning deep. "What does the True Monarch mean by this?"</p><p>"Don't worry," Qin Sang said, standing with his hands behind his back, exuding confidence. "Since I've sworn an oath, I won't go back on my word. You must have sensed the vitality within me, knowing that I also cultivate body refinement. If this secret place is beneficial to me, I'm willing to make a trade with you, one that won't disappoint."</p><p>The Dragon King was intrigued. Qin Sang was a Nascent Soul cultivator from another realm, and he surely possessed rare treasures.</p><p>Although the demon tribes had their ancestral legacies and unique bloodlines, their resources were scarce, and most had to rely on themselves. While demons could cultivate their bloodlines, they couldn't completely do without external aids. Over time, their bloodlines had become diluted.</p><p>Seeing the Dragon King's expression, Qin Sang knew he had a chance. He took out a dozen jade boxes containing sacred items produced by the major holy lands of the Central Continent's demon tribes.</p><p>Although he hadn't used force, the demon tribes, upon learning that he was the Nascent Soul cultivator behind the Dragon Whale Tribe and possibly the only Nascent Soul in this realm, didn't dare to take everything for themselves. They voluntarily offered tributes, though most were only useful to demons.</p><p>"These treasures should be more than enough. As for the rest, as long as you can provide something useful to me, we can trade. If you're interested, please prepare quickly."</p><p>The jade boxes opened one after another, releasing dazzling rays of light.</p><p>The sacred treasures of the Central Continent's demon tribes, which had produced Nascent Soul cultivators, were no ordinary items. Even the Dragon King, with his strong will, couldn't help but be captivated, his breathing growing heavier.</p><p>"Our tribe does indeed have a secret place called the Dragon Transformation Pool," he said. "It can cleanse meridians, temper the body, and circulate blood and qi, with remarkable effects. However, no outsider has ever entered it. How much you gain will depend on your own abilities."</p><p>He secretly thought that although Qin Sang was a Nascent Soul cultivator, his body refinement wasn't particularly advanced, and he was human. He likely wouldn't last long and wouldn't consume much of the pool's spiritual liquid.</p><p>...</p><p>After some bargaining and another oath from Qin Sang, the Dragon King overruled objections and invited Qin Sang into the underwater palace.</p><p>Although the Dragon Ancestral Land was underwater, it was remarkably dry inside, adorned with luminous pearls and rare treasures. It was as magnificent as the legendary Dragon Palace.</p><p>Unlike his time with the Phoenix Tribe, Qin Sang behaved with decorum, following the Dragon King through several palaces until they reached a cluster of coral.</p><p>The Dragon King performed a hand seal and took out a golden token, waving it before the coral. The coral parted, revealing a path.</p><p>"True Monarch, this way!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed for a short while before arriving at a square stone pool. The pool was small, only large enough to accommodate a young dragon. It was half-filled with water, emitting a light mist that swirled with profound mysteries.</p><p>"This is the Dragon Transformation Pool," the Dragon King said, pointing to the stone pool. He tapped the air a few times, and the mist thickened, with faint dragon shapes appearing and disappearing within it.</p><p>Though he knew it was an illusion, Qin Sang felt a genuine, awe-inspiring pressure, surprising him.</p><p>After examining it carefully and confirming there were no anomalies, Qin Sang suppressed his true essence and leaped into the pool, landing in a cross-legged position. The spiritual liquid reached up to his waist.</p><p>As the liquid soaked into him, Qin Sang first felt a refreshing coolness that penetrated his skin, flesh, meridians, and even his bone marrow.</p><p>Before he could fully appreciate the sensation, a thunderous roar erupted within his body as the coolness turned into searing pain—the familiar agony of cleansing and tempering.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
