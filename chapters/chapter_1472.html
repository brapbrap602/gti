<h1></h1><p>Tong Lingyu walked in front of the portrait, gazed at it for a long time, and then said, "Legend says that Senior Xiaoxiangzi was a Deity Transformation stage cultivator!"</p><p>Deity Transformation stage!</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, and he stared directly at the portrait, observing it even more closely.</p><p>After learning the cultivation level of the person in the painting, his feelings were different from before.</p><p>Xiaoxiangzi in the painting possessed an ethereal temperament, like an immortal banished to the mortal realm.</p><p>He was the second human Deity Transformation cultivator Qin Sang had learned of after the founding ancestor of the Four Sacred Palaces, but he had only seen their statues and heard legends about them.</p><p>"Senior Xiaoxiangzi was the founding ancestor of the Profound Sky Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected that the Profound Sky Palace was able to unify the Hidden Sun Realm, suppress other sects, and incorporate them all into the Profound Sky Palace because there must be an unparalleled figure behind it.</p><p>The environment of the Hidden Sun Realm was harsh, and the population sparse, but it was still a realm after all, and there must have been many sects, large and small. Perhaps only a Deity Transformation cultivator could suppress the masses.</p><p>Whether it was the status of a Deity Transformation cultivator, or the accomplishment of unifying the Hidden Sun Realm and founding the Profound Sky Palace, either one alone would be enough to shock the entire cultivation world.</p><p>But what surprised Qin Sang was that Xiaoxiangzi's name had not spread to the outside world.</p><p>He had been careful to collect all kinds of legends from the North Sea, and before he learned the name Xiaoxiangzi from Tong Lingyu, he had never heard of it even once.</p><p>Unless Xiaoxiangzi used a pseudonym when traveling outside.</p><p>Qin Sang, putting himself in his shoes, made a deduction.</p><p>Thinking of this, a thought struck Qin Sang, and he realized something strange. In the North Sea cultivation world, there were very few legends related to the founding ancestor of the Profound Sky Palace, and they were basically baseless rumors.</p><p>The identity and origins of the founding ancestor of the Profound Sky Palace had always been a mystery, and it was unknown whether it was deliberately hidden. This was a bit like the Pure Sea Sect, but the Pure Sea Sect was even more thorough, an entirely reclusive sect, little known to the world.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect enshrined a statue of Xiaoxiangzi in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace hung a portrait of Xiaoxiangzi in the treasure vault.</p><p>It was unknown what relationship these two major sects, one Buddhist and one Daoist, had with each other.</p><p>"When the Profound Sky Palace was first founded, Senior Xiaoxiangzi may have played an important role," Tong Lingyu deliberately emphasized the word 'may'.</p><p>"May?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at her in confusion. Could it be that the Grand Elder of the Profound Sky Palace didn't even know the history of her own sect and founding ancestor?</p><p>That would be too absurd.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw what Qin Sang was thinking and smiled indifferently. "Does Fellow Daoist Qin know how many main lineages the Profound Sky Palace had at the beginning of its founding?"</p><p>Without waiting for Qin Sang to speak, she took the initiative to answer, "Twelve main lineages in total!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed when he heard this, and his gaze turned back to the portrait, vaguely guessing something.</p><p>"Now, the Profound Sky Palace only has four main lineages left."</p><p>Tong Lingyu sighed softly. "To outsiders, the Profound Sky Palace's domination of a realm is so glorious, but only we ourselves know the internal difficulties. When Fellow Daoist becomes a Guest Elder of Listening Snow Tower, with your wisdom, it won't be long before you can see some clues, so there's no need to hide anything from you."</p><p>Her gaze also returned to the portrait, and she said quietly, "For countless years, the Profound Sky Palace has been plagued by hidden dangers. For various reasons, internal strife has erupted several times, with each lineage vying against each other, quickly spreading to the entire Profound Sky Palace, and rivers of blood flowing. The most tragic time, they almost shattered the Soaring Sky Peak, leading to the extinction of the Fountain of Immortality. It wasn't until each lineage realized that it was impossible to occupy the holy land alone, and that continuing to fight would only lead to mutual destruction and benefit the enemy. Only then did they gather again on the Soaring Sky Peak and establish the current relatively stable situation."</p><p>Qin Sang listened to Tong Lingyu's story, thinking about himself.</p><p>Even the Dao lineage left by a Deity Transformation cultivator was so unstable.</p><p>After he was gone, would the future Azure Sheep Temple re-enact the story of the Profound Sky Palace?</p><p>However, this was not something Qin Sang could decide.</p><p>Qin Sang's original intention in founding the Azure Sheep Temple was to carry on Yun Youzi's legacy, and everything that followed was out of the responsibility of a sect founder, doing what he could.</p><p>At most, he could only refer to the lessons of the Profound Sky Palace and make some improvements when he returned. No sect could be prosperous forever, and the Profound Sky Palace was now facing internal and external troubles.</p><p>If the Immortal Dao was severed, Qin Sang would eventually perish.</p><p>If he was lucky enough to find a way out, it would be difficult for the Azure Sheep Temple to keep up with his pace, and sooner or later he would have to let go.</p><p>Only by being present forever.</p><p>Only by proving the eternity of the Immortal Dao!</p><p>Tong Lingyu couldn't guess that Qin Sang was thinking so much in such a short time. Her tone was a little low, and she continued, "The Profound Sky Palace is finally stable, but the pain left by the repeated internal strife cannot be erased for a long time. Among them, the eight main lineages have either been cut off, declined, or been merged, leaving only four lineages. The seventy-two springs were originally the most beautiful scenery in the North Sea, but they were also severely damaged in this process and have not yet fully recovered their vitality. The sect's scriptures were scattered and disordered, and very little of what was left was left, and they had long been unrecognizable. Fortunately, this portrait was preserved, otherwise what Senior Xiaoxiangzi left behind would only be a vague imprint."</p><p>She said these words with emotion, not entirely to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was regret for the infighting among the predecessors of the sect, as if she was repenting before Xiaoxiangzi on behalf of her unworthy descendants.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent until Tong Lingyu's expression calmed down.</p><p>He looked at the treasure vault behind him, "Didn't the Senior leave anything behind?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu raised an eyebrow and laughed, "What do you think the twelve main lineages were fighting for? The sect's treasure vault was the first to be looted back then. If it had been divided up by the lineages, that would have been fine, but most of the easily damaged items were destroyed in the great war, and even many cultivation techniques and secret arts were lost because of this. During the internal strife, it was also plundered by demons and devils. After the baptism of catastrophes, even if there were relevant records, they would have been destroyed long ago. Otherwise, how could this Palace Master not even understand Senior Xiaoxiangzi?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked around at the treasures and said expectantly, "In that case, there may be relics of Deity Transformation cultivators among these?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu chuckled, "Then it depends on Fellow Daoist's discernment to see if you can choose the real treasure."</p><p>"Besides the portrait, didn't Senior really leave anything behind?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt that Tong Lingyu must have been withholding something, so he couldn't help but ask again.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect had disappeared, and it was unknown whether the treasures those people snatched out at the last moment included any relics of Senior Xiaoxiangzi. It was a pity that it was difficult to accurately find out who was present at the time and what they had snatched.</p><p>Tong Lingyu thought for a while, her expression slightly moved, "There is a sentence! Hmm, more like a proverb. Although it cannot be verified, it should not be a false rumor."</p><p>"What proverb?"</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly encouraged and asked repeatedly.</p><p>The corners of Tong Lingyu's mouth curled up, looking at Qin Sang meaningfully, and asked, "What is Fellow Daoist willing to exchange for it? Or, just use the remaining two opportunities?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The value of a Deity Transformation cultivator's proverb was immeasurable.</p><p>"Is it related to cultivation or bottlenecks?"</p><p>If it was the guidance of a predecessor on the cultivation of a junior, it would be worth its weight in gold, and Qin Sang would really be tempted.</p><p>"Unrelated."</p><p>Tong Lingyu affirmed, revealing a little information, "Only eight words."</p><p>Qin Sang looked suspicious, looking at Tong Lingyu, suspecting that she was bluffing and trying to deceive him. Two opportunities, possibly in exchange for a useless truth.</p><p>He had already taken a fancy to the seven-storied pagoda and would definitely take it away using this opportunity. As for the treasures on him, he was reluctant to use them for exchange.</p><p>Informing Tong Lingyu about the Pure Sea Sect might work.</p><p>However, he would do so after he had investigated the secret of the seven-storied pagoda.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang hesitate, Tong Lingyu stopped playing charades and said leisurely, "Fellow Daoist doesn't need to worry. Only Nascent Soul Late Stage cultivators may be able to benefit from this proverb. When the time comes, as long as Fellow Daoist is not an enemy of the Profound Sky Palace, this Palace Master will give it to you for free."</p><p>"It seems that Qin must be a good Guest Elder."</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed his brows and stopped thinking about it.</p><p>If it was unrelated to cultivation, then it was not an urgent matter. Qin Sang didn't know how long it would take for him to break through to the Nascent Soul Late Stage, so he would see what tricks Tong Lingyu was playing.</p><p>With that said, Qin Sang turned around and continued to examine the treasures, seeming to have forgotten about this matter.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw that he was so unrestrained and a look of surprise flashed in her eyes. She stopped talking and continued to follow behind.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang checked the remaining treasures. He deliberately showed that he was more curious about the origins and functions of those few items, including the seven-storied pagoda, seemingly really looking for Deity Transformation relics.</p><p>He didn't show it too much, otherwise it would be easier to arouse suspicion.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang confirmed his targets, the Primal Yin Water and the seven-storied pagoda.</p><p>Qin Sang first used Tong Lingyu's token to take away the Primal Yin Water, and then walked to the vicinity of the seven-storied pagoda. He turned his gaze between those few treasures, and reached out to grab the pagoda.</p><p>At the moment when he took the seven-storied pagoda into his palm, Qin Sang keenly noticed Tong Lingyu's strange gaze.</p><p>He knew that this disguise could not dispel Tong Lingyu's doubts, but there would be no better opportunity or smaller disturbance to obtain the seven-storied pagoda than now.</p><p>This treasure was hidden in the treasure vault, located in the heart of the Profound Sky Palace.</p><p>On the surface, there was only one Nascent Soul Middle Stage cultivator, but Qin Sang could sense that from the moment they entered the seventy-two springs, there was a murderous aura hidden in the dark, guarding them heavily.</p><p>It was impossible to rob or steal it.</p><p>It was best if he could take it away like this. If Tong Lingyu had concealed something before and suddenly regretted it at this time, Qin Sang was not afraid.</p><p>Another seven-storied pagoda was in his hands. No matter what the Profound Sky Palace did, it was impossible to get rid of him. In any case, he had to have a share of the pie.</p><p>The Profound Sky Palace had vast resources. Cooperation would benefit both parties, and it was not necessary to swallow it alone.</p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist's choices are always so unexpected."</p><p>Tong Lingyu walked forward, looking at the Primal Yin Water and the seven-storied pagoda.</p><p>She originally thought that Qin Sang would choose those spiritual herbs or strange magic treasures, but she never expected that it would be these two things that had been stored in the treasure vault for an unknown amount of time and that no one had ever asked about.</p><p>"Out of curiosity, this Palace Master has tried using the magical powers of each lineage in turn, but this small pagoda has no reaction at all. Does Fellow Daoist know its secret?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Unknown means more possibilities. I feel that it is more like a Deity Transformation relic than those," Qin Sang said lightly, playing with the seven-storied pagoda in his hand, and secretly preparing himself.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took a deep look at Qin Sang, hesitated for a moment, and did not break her promise. "It seems that the value of the treasures in the treasure vault is not high enough to catch Fellow Daoist's eye. Then this Palace Master wishes Fellow Daoist all the best and hopes that Fellow Daoist can really discover something and unravel more secrets of Senior Xiaoxiangzi."</p><p>Qin Sang put away the two items. Seeing that Tong Lingyu was staring at him intently, he secretly smiled, took out the sacred object, and handed it over.</p><p>The sacred object had finally returned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took the ice box. Without avoiding Qin Sang, she held it with one hand and covered the top of the ice box with the other. Spiritual light surged in her palm, and countless runes flickered.</p><p>In a short while, the seal on the ice box loosened, but it was not opened directly. Qin Sang still could not see the Ice Demon Crystal.</p><p>After a moment, Tong Lingyu's brows suddenly furrowed, and she looked up at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that she had discovered the loss of power from the Ice Demon Crystal. He met Tong Lingyu's gaze calmly, looking innocent and unconcerned.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression quickly returned to normal. She put away the sacred object and led Qin Sang out of the treasure vault, flew out of the Azure White Spring, and turned south. "I have already ordered someone to prepare a quiet room by the Coral Spring. You have been traveling long distances before, please take a few days to rest first."</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in salute. "I plan to leave the Profound Sky Palace tomorrow morning and go to Ditung Island to meet up with Liuli. Their speed is not as fast as ours, and they should be arriving at Ditung Island soon."</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang had asked about Liuli's itinerary, knowing that they were going to Ditung Island to ask for Ditung Fruits.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was no longer polite. "That's fine too. Fellow Daoist will soon become a Guest Elder of Listening Snow Tower, and there will be plenty of time in the future."</p><p>Before long, the two arrived at the Coral Spring.</p><p>The water in this spring was red, and when it flowed, countless coral-like scenes appeared inside, hence the name.</p><p>After sending Qin Sang to the quiet room, Tong Lingyu left in a hurry to return the sacred object to the Unfrozen Spring.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed everyone and rested in the quiet room for one night. He did not take out the seven-storied pagoda that night, only holding the seven-storied pagoda and playing with it over and over again.</p><p>Early the next morning.</p><p>Qin Sang did not wait for Tong Lingyu, left a letter, and left gracefully.</p><p>With the token given by Tong Lingyu, no one stopped him along the way, and he left the Profound Sky Palace smoothly.</p><p>Qin Sang's vigilance relaxed slightly. He immediately activated his Thunder Wings until he was far away from the Profound Sky Palace and arrived at an unnamed snow mountain. He pressed down his escape light and entered the forest.</p><p>He casually opened a cave, set up a restriction, and took out the two small pagodas.</p><p>The two pagodas were placed together. Apart from the color, there was almost no difference. Even the small gourds carved on the top of the pagodas were exactly the same.</p><p>The pagoda bodies were both transparent and could be seen through at a glance. There were no impurities inside and they were equally pure.</p><p>When held in the hand, one felt warm and the other felt cool.</p><p>Qin Sang first observed them with his naked eyes for a while, and then picked up the seven-storied pagoda and tried to activate his true essence and divine sense to enter the pagoda.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang suddenly shifted his gaze and looked at the seven-storied pagoda next to him in surprise.</p><p>At the same time as he touched the seven-storied pagoda, the light on the seven-storied pagoda changed for the first time, becoming more gorgeous and dazzling than before, illuminating the cave.</p><p>If it were placed outside, people who saw the light would definitely think that a strange treasure had been born.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang quickly continued to pour in his true essence, but the change in the seven-storied pagoda stopped there.</p><p>After thinking about it, Qin Sang switched to the seven-storied pagoda and found that when he activated this treasure, the seven-storied pagoda also showed a similar phenomenon, flashing a dark blue light.</p><p>Qin Sang tried everything, no matter what he did, the two pagodas did not show any extraordinary power, only this one change.</p><p>Leaving the Celestial Eye Butterfly to watch, Qin Sang took one of the small pagodas far away, but the reaction was still the same. The distance of induction between the two pagodas should be very far.</p><p>He returned to the cave, holding the two small pagodas, and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, a frustrating thought came to him.</p><p>"This... could it just be two communication magic treasures?"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thank you to the lord of Qi Zhi You Zou  for another reward.</p><p>I haven't caught up with the last bonus yet. Thank you for your love, I am very ashamed!</p>
