<h1>Chapter 448: On Corpse Refinement</h1><p>Qin Sang hadn't lied to Fatty.</p><p>The three Soul-Guiding Herbs had been refined into seven Heavenly Corpse Talismans.</p><p>Before entering the Cloudmire Wetlands, Qin Sang had used five of them.</p><p>One was used on Yu Daiyue, but the attempt to create a living corpse failed. Another was used on Liang Yan, successfully creating a living corpse, but it was destroyed by Yu Hua in Boundless Valley.</p><p>One talisman was given to Tan Jie to preserve his soul, and Qin Sang used one himself for protection.</p><p>The last one was meant to seal Yu Hua's Primordial Spirit.  However, Qin Sang lacked confidence, so he hesitated to refine Yu Hua into a corpse, keeping him within the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Soul-Guiding Herbs were rare. To be safe, Qin Sang had to keep one for himself. Therefore, in the past three years, he had only refined that one living corpse, which he then sold.</p><p>Manager Bao didn't believe Qin Sang's story. He continued, "Fellow Daoist's corpse refinement technique is unique. These refined corpses are powerful. If you have higher quality corpses to sell, our shop will offer you a satisfactory price. However, though my knowledge is limited, after so many years as a manager, I can discern a few things.  Fellow Daoist, your living corpse is clearly superior to these other refined corpses. No, they're not even comparable! The higher the cultivation, the greater the difference!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, glancing at the nine Malignant Corpses, who remained oblivious to their denigration.</p><p>"In Fellow Daoist's eyes, are my Malignant Corpses so worthless?"</p><p>Manager Bao shook his head repeatedly.  "Fellow Daoist, please don't jest. I'm not speaking without basis. You'll understand what I mean…"</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for him to continue.</p><p>"Then I'll be blunt.  Please don't take offense."</p><p>Manager Bao glanced at the Malignant Corpses.</p><p>"I heard you call these nine refined corpses 'Malignant Corpses'.</p><p>Malignant Corpses are powerful, exceeding the strength of those refined by other techniques, yet they have two major flaws.</p><p>First, Malignant Corpses cannot improve!</p><p>Other corpse refinement techniques can enhance a corpse's realm through methods like corpse nurturing or other secret arts. Some ghost cultivators even nurture their refined corpses into Life-Bound Corpses that grow alongside them, possessing unlimited potential.</p><p>To be honest, the last time I saw your Malignant Corpses, I was intrigued and kept one for research. Only then did I realize how unique your technique is.</p><p>It seems that the moment they are refined, Malignant Corpses are fixed.</p><p>I tried several corpse refinement techniques on it, but its power didn't increase at all.  Even nurturing it wouldn't have any effect.</p><p>Initially, I thought it was due to Earthly Yin energy. After much effort, I obtained some, but still couldn't improve it.</p><p>A cultivator's strength will gradually increase, but the Malignant Corpses remain stagnant.  They will soon fall behind their master, becoming useless. Isn't that the biggest flaw?"</p><p>Manager Bao stared intently, his expression full of confidence, questioning Qin Sang.</p><p>Beneath his black robe, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  He was surprised by Manager Bao's words.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this man was also a master of corpse refinement, and his guesses were correct.</p><p>The "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual" indeed stated that Malignant Corpses were limited by their strength before death.  Upon refinement, they reach their peak and cannot improve until destroyed.</p><p>The same applied to living corpses. Qin Sang only learned the secret art to enhance a living corpse into a Flying Night Fiend from Wu Shang's writings.</p><p>However, the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual" excelled in speed.  It didn't require lengthy nurturing.</p><p>Of course, the Heavenly Corpse Sect also had normal nurturing methods.</p><p>Their zombie refinement technique, like other sects', allowed corpses to grow with the cultivator and absorb Earthly Yin energy to temper their bodies, still surpassing other techniques.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't stay in a place of Yin energy indefinitely, tending to a corpse. He also had no intention of spending his energy on a Life-Bound Corpse, viewing refined corpses merely as tools for combat and protection.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's silence, Manager Bao continued.  "I did discover something. The dantian of a Malignant Corpse is different from other refined corpses, likely refined by your secret art.</p><p>The dantian is what I consider the second flaw!</p><p>Besides sharing the weaknesses of other refined corpses, Malignant Corpses have a dantian, their greatest vulnerability!</p><p>I don't know what secret art you used to strengthen their dantians to withstand Earthly Yin energy.</p><p>But Earthly Yin energy isn't easily contained.  If the dantian is damaged, the Yin energy will surge, causing the corpse to collapse beyond recovery.</p><p>Malignant Corpses possess minimal sentience, only a killing instinct.  In the ever-changing battlefield, if their master is distracted, an opponent can exploit this weakness and destroy the corpse.</p><p>At lower realms, this might be overlooked.</p><p>But the higher the opponent's cultivation, the sharper their eye.  Against a seasoned veteran, it wouldn't be surprising if they saw through the weakness instantly.</p><p>Living corpses are different!</p><p>The owner of that living corpse came and went quickly, so I couldn't examine it closely. I'm unsure if it can be improved through nurturing or has other abilities. But I'm certain of one thing: living corpses are highly sentient, instinctively knowing how to protect their vital points.  In high-level combat, they can still play a powerful role!"</p><p>Manager Bao finished in one breath, draining his tea and smacking his lips. "Fellow Daoist, are there any errors in my assessment?"</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed.  "Manager Bao's insight is remarkable.  You've nearly seen through me just from one Malignant Corpse.  I'm truly impressed! However, I haven't deceived you. Though living corpses are strong, refining them is incredibly difficult and demanding. I'm willing but unable. If you have no other matters, please appraise these for me. I must return to my cultivation and won't disturb you further."</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's sincerity, Manager Bao was disappointed, but he persisted.  "Don't rush, Fellow Daoist!  Not having a living corpse now doesn't mean you won't in the future. I'll ask you one question: given enough time, is it possible to refine a living corpse comparable to a Foundation Establishment expert?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Manager Bao, hesitated, then said, "Not comparable to Foundation Establishment… a late-stage Qi Refining living corpse might be possible.  However, don't compare other refined corpses to living corpses.  Their abilities are beyond your imagination."</p><p>Manager Bao was overjoyed.  "How can I acquire a living corpse from you? Even if I can't afford it myself, I can help find a buyer."</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. "If you can find a buyer, I only require three things: first, a spirit item that aids Core Formation; second, a heavenly treasure that can mend foundations; third, a demon core extracted within the last ten years or…"</p><p>Qin Sang trailed off mid-sentence.</p><p>Manager Bao's face turned grim.</p>
