<h1>Chapter 1808: Flower Field</h1><p>Passing through the auspicious clouds, they entered the golden palace region.</p><p>The three didn't pause, following Qingdan Yuanjun as they flew towards one of the golden palaces and swiftly vanished from sight.</p><p>Not long after, the three reappeared in another golden palace, gazing back at the place where they had just disappeared.</p><p>It remained peaceful, with no other figures in sight.</p><p>“No one is following us. Neither the Dao Court nor the Ghostfang Kingdom has their attention here right now.”</p><p>Boxian Shanzhu said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He had already confirmed the absence of pursuit through his Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>After advancing to the fifth transformation, unless it was a Soul Formation realm Demon King, or a Demon Marquis with special powers, it was very difficult to escape the Skyeye Butterfly's gaze.</p><p>“Let's wait a bit longer,” Qingdan Yuanjun said cautiously. The illusionary formations here were meticulously arranged by her.</p><p>They waited for another hour. After confirming there was no danger, the three set off, quietly arriving before the Nine-Bend Star River and crossing it.</p><p>Without the rampant golden light, the space deep within the Ritual Altar was stable.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun led the two through the cloud paths. Soon, they reached a point where the paths ended, and they had to forcibly pass through some illusions.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist cultivates physical power. In some places ahead, we may have to rely on Fellow Daoist…”</p><p>Before an illusion, Qingdan Yuanjun stopped and spoke to Qin Sang.</p><p>Within certain illusions, physical cultivators had a much easier time than spellcasters, and Qin Sang could save them a lot of energy.</p><p>“In that case, let this humble Daoist lead the way,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Casting the Auspicious Seal and the Vajra Body Seal, Qin Sang's Qi and blood surged, his skin taking on a faint golden hue.</p><p>Simultaneously, his hands erupted with a blue-red light, revealing a pair of gauntlets he now wore.</p><p>The gauntlets were mostly composed of fine blue scales, with three bone spurs extending from the knuckles of each fist.</p><p>The blood-red bone spurs were razor-sharp, exuding a sinister glow that seemed to sting the eyes.</p><p>Both Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanzhu's pupils contracted, secretly surprised. They knew this must be a top-tier凶器 (fierce weapon).</p><p>Over the past ten years, Qin Sang had finally refined the gauntlets with Master Qi's help.</p><p>If Master Gu were to judge them, the refining technique might appear somewhat crude, but the quality of the spiritual materials was exceptional. Most importantly, they incorporated the bone spurs from the Li Marquis's transverse bone, painstakingly refined for many years. Upon completion, the gauntlets possessed the might of a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>The process of refining the gauntlets was also a process of Qin Sang integrating his knowledge and experience. Coupled with his study of the refining manuals gifted by Master Gu, his skills in the Dao of Refining had advanced rapidly.</p><p>In the future, when he had the time, Qin Sang would continue to refine the Returning Wind Armor and the gauntlets. These two treasures not only served as a testament to his refining skills, but also as a witness to his continuous progress.</p><p>Qin Sang took the lead, while Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanzhu each summoned their own magical treasures, following behind him on either side, poised for action.</p><p>Maintaining this formation, the three passed through one illusion after another.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>There was no sky above, no earth below.</p><p>A bone-chilling, soul-stirring black wind howled, omnipresent.</p><p>Three figures flew with difficulty through the wind.</p><p>This was a peculiar spiritual wind, capable of dispersing True Essence. Even protective magical treasures were significantly weakened here, struggling to withstand the spiritual wind.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his robust physical body, seemed unaffected. Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanzhu could only focus all their efforts on resisting the spiritual wind.</p><p>After traveling through the endless black wind for an unknown period, a light finally appeared ahead. The three immediately increased their speed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Finally escaping the spiritual wind, Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanzhu both revealed expressions of relief.</p><p>Qin Sang observed their surroundings, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>Due to the different route, the illusions they experienced this time were completely different from the last. He saw familiar sights for the first time.</p><p>At the edge of his vision, among countless bizarre scenes, was a sliver of blue, much like the blue sea of light he had seen before.</p><p>It was evident that the blue sea of light was very far from them, but they could use it to determine their direction.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked Qingdan Yuanjun with some doubt, “Can we reach the Poison Domain from here?”</p><p>Judging by the blue sea of light, their current direction deviated significantly from where they had previously appeared, which was hard not to question.</p><p>“This is an old path discovered by the ancestors of my Mole Cricket Mountain. Although it has many difficulties, as long as we're careful, there's generally no risk to our lives.” Qingdan Yuanjun raised a jade-like finger, pointing to the right. “After discovering the Poison Domain, I found a shortcut, but…”</p><p>Boxian Shanzhu sighed. “That shortcut passes through the area being contested by the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom.  It's better to take a longer route and avoid it.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. The chaos of the golden light had clearly not yet been resolved.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun carefully examined the area, her expression relaxing slightly. “There are no changes ahead. Fellow Daoist can rest for a while.  We two are enough to handle the next two illusions.”</p><p>As she spoke, they moved in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Taking turns like this, the three passed through one illusion after another.</p><p>The deeper they went into the Ritual Altar, the more dangerous the illusions became, forcing them to slow down, stopping and starting.</p><p>Finally, a green lake appeared in their view.</p><p>“Is this lake the Poison Domain you mentioned, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the lakeshore, gazing at the water with a curious glint in his eyes.</p><p>The lake's surface was quite vast, yet compared to the other illusions, it seemed rather small, nestled between two illusions that stretched for hundreds of miles. It even appeared somewhat cramped, like a sudden courtyard well.</p><p>The surface of the lake was a perfectly regular circle, and surprisingly, it was tilted at a steep angle. Their position was the lowest point, as if facing a slanted mirror.</p><p>The green lake water did not bring a sense of vitality.</p><p>The lake was extremely deep, the water a dark green, almost black, giving off a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>“It's quite a good passage. Passing through the poison lake should lead to a much deeper area…”</p><p>Qin Sang observed the surrounding scenery, thinking to himself.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun stared at the poison lake, explaining, “This is the place. According to our sect's records, the water here used to be transparent, normal water without any toxins.  The sudden transformation of the lake water into poison is not unusual within the Ritual Altar.  This place is constantly changing. If that golden light erupted a few more times, the entire Ritual Altar might have been completely transformed…”</p><p>As she spoke, a crimson light appeared between Qingdan Yuanjun's eyebrows, projecting a divine rune with an extremely complex form.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun had clearly thoroughly comprehended this rune. As soon as the divine rune appeared, it shone with a dazzling red light.</p><p>In an instant, the divine rune transformed into a crimson palace robe, flying towards Qingdan Yuanjun.</p><p>The robe's design was exquisite, intricately depicting two unknown divine birds, as if they were attendant spirit beasts.</p><p>Worn by Qingdan Yuanjun, it added a touch of elegance to her presence.</p><p>Boxian Shanzhu took out a piece of jade and held it in his mouth. He said to Qin Sang, “Don't underestimate the surface poison. Fellow Daoist, be careful. Once through the poisonous water, the danger will actually lessen. The interior of the poison lake is quite peculiar, difficult to describe in words. I'll explain as we go.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Seven-colored light emanated from his body, merging with the faint gold of his skin to form a radiant armor, shimmering brilliantly.</p><p>Both Boxian Shanzhu and Qingdan Yuanjun couldn't discern what kind of divine ability or magical treasure Qin Sang was using. They were secretly amazed, but also knew that this must be Qin Sang's secret and didn't inquire further.</p><p>Stepping into the poison lake.</p><p>Qin Sang heard the splashing sound of water and felt the swift current flowing past him.</p><p>However, sensing through the Poison Bead, the seemingly strange poisonous water, in fact, had no potent toxicity and couldn't be absorbed by the Poison Bead.</p><p>Just as he was puzzled, he noticed ripples suddenly appearing in the lake water ahead. There was clearly no whirlpool, but the ripples appeared out of nowhere within the lake water, surging towards him.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>As Boxian Shanzhu warned, the first ripple touched Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A stream of water slapped against Qin Sang's body, the force relatively gentle, not pushing him back.</p><p>The instant he touched the ripple, Qin Sang's vision was suddenly filled with a rich green, and immediately afterward, he felt something strange.</p><p>He abruptly raised his arms and found that, almost instantly, his body was covered in dense, green spots.</p><p>As the water ripples continued to surge, the spots gradually grew larger, bulging like blisters before bursting.</p><p>‘Pop, pop, pop…’</p><p>The sound of bursting continued as green poisonous plants sprouted from the ruptured spots. The plants were tiny, covering Qin Sang's body like a thick carpet, as if he had been immersed in water for a long time, covered in aquatic plants.</p><p>Soon, flower buds grew from the aquatic plants.</p><p>One after another, green poisonous flowers bloomed. Qin Sang had practically transformed into a flower field.</p><p>“The poisonous water itself is non-toxic. There must be some unknown special formation or restriction that uses the poisonous water to cultivate these poisonous flowers. The flowers aren't real, they're very strange…”</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanzhu seemed accustomed to this, ignoring the poisonous flowers on their bodies as they continued forward.</p><p>As they walked, green flowers drifted from their bodies, leaving a trail of petals, a strangely beautiful sight.</p><p>They didn't mention what would happen if the poisonous flowers bloomed inside their bodies. Qin Sang didn't want to find out either, using his Poison Repelling Armor to block the flowers from his skin as he followed closely behind.</p><p>The poisonous flowers grew faster than they shed.</p><p>As they progressed, the three were enveloped by layers of poisonous flowers, as if transformed into three light flower balls floating on the water.</p><p>“We'll be through the poisonous water area soon. How are you feeling, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun asked with concern.</p><p>“Tolerable,” Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>The poisonous flowers were far from reaching the Poison Repelling Armor's limit. If he couldn't even handle the outer layer of poisonous water, he might as well turn back.</p><p>Soon, the flower ball at the front began to rapidly wither and shed, revealing Qingdan Yuanjun's figure.</p><p>Boxian Shanzhu and Qin Sang also reappeared.</p><p>Before their eyes was an endless green fog.</p><p>The fog was like clouds, drifting in the void.  There was no wind here, and the fog's movement followed no pattern.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw the poisonous water forming a green dome above them. The surrounding fog seemed thin, but it could block spiritual sense probes.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly could see a little farther than they could, but it still couldn't see the end, as if it were boundless.</p><p>The space within the poison lake far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“The fog is the same color as the outer poisonous water, but we haven't found any threat from the poisonous fog itself yet. The danger comes from other sources. Fellow Daoist, remember not to spread your spiritual sense too far…”</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun explained through voice transmission, identified their direction, and flew forward.</p><p>They moved through the fog as if riding on clouds.</p><p>The danger that Qingdan Yuanjun mentioned never appeared.  Everything seemed peaceful.</p><p>With the Skyeye Butterfly's ability, Qin Sang carefully observed the surroundings, but found nothing unusual. Compared to the illusions created by other divine abilities, this place was remarkably calm.</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>A clump of fog suddenly appeared in the Skyeye Butterfly's vision.</p><p>This clump of poisonous fog was very dense, drifting among the other fog, slowly approaching them.</p><p>Shortly after the Skyeye Butterfly discovered the clump of fog, the others also noticed it.</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun's expression turned serious. She immediately made way for the clump of fog, hovering in place, and sternly warned, “Do not leak your aura!”</p><p>Qin Sang followed suit, standing behind Qingdan Yuanjun, watching the direction the clump of fog was coming from, curious about what was inside it. It had caused the two Real Masters to become so wary even before it approached.</p><p>As the clump of fog drew closer.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly finally saw what was inside.</p><p>Strangely, there was a bubble inside the clump of fog, with the poisonous fog swirling around it.</p><p>The bubble was transparent, and inside it was a piece of land!</p><p>To be precise, it was a flower field.</p><p>The flower field was filled with spiritual flowers, a sea of blossoms swaying in vibrant colors, incredibly vivid.</p><p>Even through the bubble, the sight of the flower sea was refreshing, as if one could smell the invigorating fragrance.</p><p>The spiritual flowers in the flower field didn't belong to any species they recognized, as if created from thin air.</p><p>The clump of fog passed by them.</p><p>The beautiful scenery of the flower field remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qingdan Yuanjun with some confusion, and heard her voice transmission, “Follow it!”</p><p>They followed the clump of fog, slowly flying towards the depths of the mist.</p><p>After following for a while, the flower field finally changed.  Qingdan Yuanjun softly said, "Here it comes."</p><p>There was a trace of fear in her voice.</p><p>The spiritual flowers in the flower field suddenly began swaying faster, the entire sea of blossoms as if driven mad.</p><p>All the spiritual flowers' pistils sprayed out filaments, which intertwined in the air, while a pollen-like smoke filled the space.</p><p>In an instant, flower cocoons floated above the flower field.</p><p>The next moment, the cocoons split open.</p><p>Seeing what was inside the cocoons, a flash of surprise crossed Qin Sang's eyes.  They were humanoid flower spirits.</p><p>The flower spirits were male and female, all exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>All the flower spirits moved in unison, embracing their knees and gazing at the sky.</p><p>Then, they stood up from the openings of the cocoons, stepping on the filaments and walking towards the ground. Beautiful flowers, graceful flower spirits - the scene, however, felt incredibly eerie.</p><p>The flower spirits' eyes were empty and deep, their faces expressionless, as if controlled by an invisible force. Once on the ground, they began to pair up and dance in the flower field.</p><p>There was no music, and the flower spirits' gazes towards their partners remained empty.</p><p>Watching the graceful dance steps, the three felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>“The first time I came in, I extended a sliver of my spiritual sense, wanting to see what else was in the flower field, whether the flower spirits were real or not.  But the moment my aura leaked, all the flower spirits stopped, and stared directly at me…”</p><p>Qingdan Yuanjun recounted her experience, still feeling a lingering fear.</p><p>The instant she was gazed upon by the flower spirits, she sensed danger. Fortunately, she hadn't gone too deep that time and immediately fled the poison lake. The flower spirits didn't pursue her.</p><p>The flower spirits danced for the time it took to burn an incense stick, then returned to their respective cocoons.</p><p>The cocoons closed, retracting their filaments, as if the flower spirits had fallen into slumber.</p><p>Everything happened silently and without a trace.</p><p>They quietly followed behind the clump of fog and encountered another one, also a flower field, just of a different size.</p><p>Then, Qingdan Yuanjun stopped following and changed direction.</p><p>After flying for a while longer, a different scene finally appeared in the fog ahead – an ancient palace complex.</p><p>“The object I seek is within the palace,” Qingdan Yuanjun breathed a sigh of relief.  As agreed, she took out a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang. “This contains half of a cultivation technique. Once I obtain the treasure, I'll give you the other half.”</p>
