<h1>Chapter 1942: The Drunken Fragrance Feast</h1><p>“This humble Daoist is Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, his eyes assessing the storyteller.</p><p>He had only detected an unusual fluctuation the moment the young woman stepped into the teahouse, captivated by the storyteller’s words, realizing then that the storyteller was no ordinary person.</p><p>Before this, the storyteller had already been performing in the teahouse.</p><p>It was impossible for Qin Sang to constantly extend his divine sense, locking onto a county town hundreds of miles away, but for the storyteller to elude his spiritual perception spoke volumes about the latter’s cultivation.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang assumed there was some connection between the storyteller and the young woman, but later he realized something was amiss.</p><p>The storyteller had likely revealed himself intentionally, targeting him specifically.</p><p>The opponent had known about him all along, while he only discovered the storyteller’s presence when the latter made a move; the difference in their abilities was stark.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the storyteller must have sensed the eruption at the main altar, drawn by the thunder and the energy fluctuations.</p><p>He had initially thought, regardless of whether the storyteller was an expert from Cloud Metropolis Heaven or the Soulfall Abyss, this encounter would likely be difficult to resolve peacefully.</p><p>However, the opponent’s attitude was intriguing.</p><p>The storyteller actively revealed himself, stirring up trouble in Jin County, drawing the young woman and the local ghosts and gods into his story, making it clear to Qin Sang that he was here, yet not directly confronting him.</p><p>To a certain extent, it seemed like a gesture of goodwill?</p><p>Just as the storyteller had said, Qin Sang couldn’t move the main altar, nor could he allow the storyteller to gather all the ghosts and gods, drawing the attention of the entire world to this place.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang decided to have his avatar pay a visit, determined to see what this person was truly up to.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng,” the storyteller, Qingyuan, savored the name, “Presumably an alias?”</p><p>His words seemed to carry a deeper meaning.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered.  He said indifferently, “Likewise.”</p><p>Qingyuan laughed.  “This one is merely a storyteller. True names and aliases hold no significance.”</p><p>A storyteller?</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the teahouse behind Qingyuan.</p><p>Inside the teahouse, the young woman and the ghosts and gods had all emerged from the story, but some of the ghosts and gods still wore expressions of bewilderment, unsure of what had just transpired.</p><p>The County God Yu, the two Magistrates, and the young woman, who were the first to regain their senses, now wore various expressions.</p><p>The young woman appeared somewhat resentful.</p><p>County God Yu and the two Magistrates looked grave.</p><p>Without exception, they all held deep apprehension towards the storyteller.</p><p>The storyteller stood with his back to them, yet he seemed like an insurmountable mountain, and no one dared to take half a step out of the teahouse.</p><p>A deathly silence pervaded the teahouse, the atmosphere eerie.</p><p>“This one, like the Daoist, enjoys observing the mortal world and savoring the myriad flavors of human life. The proprietor of Drunken Fragrance Restaurant’s skills are truly exceptional; the Drunken Fragrance Feast is a culinary masterpiece.  Might I invite the Daoist to join me?”</p><p>Qingyuan gestured with his folding fan towards the City God Temple.</p><p>Not far from the temple stood a three-story wooden building, every detail meticulously crafted, yet without appearing ostentatious, exuding a restrained elegance, possessing a unique charm.</p><p>Even in the capital of Yan Country, the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant wouldn't be out of place; in the small Jin County, it stood head and shoulders above the rest.</p><p>Qin Sang had only heard about the Drunken Fragrance Feast from County God Yu and Magistrate Yi the day before.  “I’ve heard that the proprietor of Drunken Fragrance Restaurant is a man of character, and that the feast is a rare treat.”</p><p>His voice carried into the teahouse.</p><p>County God Yu and Magistrate Yi exchanged odd looks.  *Are you two ordinary people? A single breath from either of you could level this restaurant.*</p><p>“I’m not boasting, but though my acquaintance with the proprietor is short, we connected instantly. I guarantee the Daoist will enjoy the Drunken Fragrance Feast today,” Qingyuan said proudly, extending a hand in invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and walked side by side with Qingyuan.</p><p>Yu Lang sensed something unusual and silently followed behind.</p><p>…</p><p>“My Lord, what should we do?”</p><p>Magistrate Wu asked in a low voice.</p><p>County God Yu pondered for a moment.  “Wait!”</p><p>With that, County God Yu sat back down.  The other ghosts and gods looked at each other, and could only do the same.</p><p>The young woman had been gritting her teeth, not daring to act rashly.  Seeing Qin Sang and Qingyuan enter the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant, she stamped her foot and rushed out of the teahouse, her destination unknown.</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to the exterior, the interior of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant was even more elegant, and a faint sandalwood fragrance permeated the air.</p><p>There weren't many diners in the main hall.</p><p>The waiter was familiar with Qingyuan and spoke casually, “Sir, you’re finished early today? Please go to the third floor; I'll inform the proprietor immediately.”</p><p>“Tell the proprietor I have a distinguished guest and wish to order the full Drunken Fragrance Feast today,” Qingyuan instructed.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The waiter looked at Qin Sang in surprise.  “Yes!  Understood…”</p><p>“Yu Lang!”</p><p>A sudden shout, jarringly loud in the tranquil restaurant, caused the diners to frown.</p><p>They turned to look, seeing a young boy, and could only shake their heads in resignation.</p><p>“Boisterous?”</p><p>Yu Lang frowned as well.</p><p>The nickname was indeed fitting; it was Tao Teng, whom he had just parted ways with yesterday.</p><p>“Are you here for a meal too?”</p><p>Tao Teng had just emerged from a private room.  Seeing his friend, his face lit up with delight as he rushed over.</p><p>Yu Lang’s attempt to stop him was too late.</p><p>He knew Tao Teng’s family was well-off, but he hadn’t expected to encounter him here.  While seeing his friend was certainly a cause for joy, the timing couldn't be worse!</p><p>Yu Lang opened his mouth, about to speak, when he saw Tao Teng’s expression darken, the joy replaced by sorrow, and he let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Alas, this might be the last time we see each other!”</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Yu Lang asked with concern.</p><p>“My father received a letter last night.  My second uncle has prospered in the capital and has established a large business.  He needs people to help manage it, so my father is preparing to move the entire family to the capital.  We’re leaving this afternoon.  Luckily, I ran into you here; otherwise, I would have only been able to leave a letter for you and Master, without even a chance to say goodbye,” Tao Teng sniffed, his voice growing increasingly somber.</p><p>For mortals, Yan Country was vast enough.</p><p>This parting might very well be their last.</p><p>“So suddenly?”</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang felt a pang of sadness.  He truly considered Tao Teng a genuine friend.</p><p>“Indeed! My second uncle is urging us to hurry, even skipping the New Year celebrations! It's a pity you won’t be going to the capital for the imperial examinations; otherwise, we could reunite soon, and I would definitely treat you well,” Tao Teng knew his friend’s aspirations lay in cultivating the Dao, not in fame and fortune.</p><p>“I’ll be traveling with my Master in the future, and we might pass through the capital.  I’ll definitely visit your family then,” Yu Lang said.</p><p>“It’s a promise then! My father and the others will be finishing their meal soon.  Let’s have a good chat.”</p><p>Tao Teng’s sorrow turned to joy.</p><p>As they talked, the two unknowingly followed the others up to the third floor, arriving at the best private room.</p><p>Seeing his Master and the storyteller enter, Yu Lang suddenly remembered that bringing Tao Teng along was inappropriate.  He hesitated, then heard his Master’s voice.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Yu Lang felt instantly relieved and pulled Tao Teng to the seats by the door.</p><p>Qin Sang was offered the seat of honor.</p><p>He appeared relaxed, but in truth, facing the mysterious Qingyuan, he didn't let his guard down for a moment, carefully considering every word.</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly as he looked out the window, a playful smile on his lips.  “Trouble has arrived.”</p><p>The terrain within Jin County was uneven, and the area near the City God Temple was relatively high, allowing a view of the mountains beyond the city from the third floor.</p><p>Just then, a streak of azure light flew across the sky, heading straight towards Jin County.</p><p>Qingyuan said, “This one didn’t harm that young lady in the slightest.  She entered the teahouse of her own accord.  The Daoist can vouch for me.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly.  “This humble Daoist has been here for less than half a year, interacting only with mortals. I don’t know a single cultivator. No one would believe me, so I’m afraid I can’t help you.”</p><p>He leaned back slightly, watching the door of the private room, assuming a posture of a spectator, and cast a spell to isolate Yu Lang and Tao Teng.</p><p>The two youngsters were huddled together, whispering, completely unaware of what was happening.</p><p>A moment later, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>Qingyuan coughed lightly.  “Enter.”</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>A withered hand pushed the wooden door open.</p><p>The newcomer was an elderly man in black robes, his face as gaunt as his hand, accentuating his piercing eyes.</p><p>After glancing at Qin Sang and Qingyuan, the old man clasped his hands and spoke in a resonant voice, “This old man is Lin Baoshan, retainer of the Yin family of Silver Screen Mountain.  Greetings to the two fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Qin Sang was determined not to get involved.</p><p>Qingyuan expressed surprise. “Fellow Daoist Lin, with such cultivation, you condescend to be a retainer? It seems the Yin family must be a prestigious clan.”</p><p>Lin Baoshan was at the late Gold Core realm. Despite his advanced age, his chances of breaking through to Nascent Soul were slim, but he was still considered a master within the various countries.</p><p>“Does Fellow Daoist not know of the Yin family? This old man owes his entire cultivation to the Family Head, a debt of gratitude I can never repay.”</p><p>Lin Baoshan’s brow furrowed almost imperceptibly, and he bowed again. “My young mistress has a somewhat capricious nature.  She descended the mountain to amuse herself, and if she inadvertently offended Fellow Daoist, this old man apologizes on her behalf.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Lin, you are too kind. Your young mistress didn't offend me. I merely played a small jest on her,” Qingyuan shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Lin Baoshan nodded and said gravely, “Is that so?  Then, please, Fellow Daoist, lift the restriction on my young mistress’s mind!”</p><p>“Restriction?”</p><p>Qingyuan paused, then suddenly chuckled.  “Don’t worry, it’s for her benefit.  In just three days, she’ll understand.”</p><p>The young woman's mind and body had been immersed in Qingyuan's story, experiencing another life firsthand. Though she had awakened, the story's influence hadn't dissipated, and she felt increasingly uneasy.</p><p>Having one's mind controlled would undoubtedly hinder cultivation significantly, making it impossible for them not to be cautious.</p><p>As expected, Lin Baoshan didn’t believe Qingyuan’s words.  He said solemnly, “In that case, this old man dares to invite Fellow Daoist to Silver Screen Mountain as a guest.  We shall see the results in three days.”</p><p>“And if I refuse? Will you attack me?” Qingyuan asked.</p><p>Lin Baoshan stepped across the threshold, his voice hardening.  “It is an invitation!”</p><p>“You can't defeat me.  Don’t invite trouble upon yourself,” Qingyuan advised, seemingly concerned for the other man.</p><p>Anyone else would likely have been enraged by Qingyuan’s provocation.</p><p>However, Lin Baoshan’s expression remained unchanged, and he didn't retreat.  His body trembled slightly, and his gaunt frame erupted with a ferocious, bestial aura.</p><p>“As a retainer, I failed to protect my young mistress, a crime punishable by death.  If I am no match for Fellow Daoist and die by your hand, I will have died fulfilling my duty!”</p><p>Lin Baoshan's voice boomed like a great bell, his aura escalating with each word, reaching its peak as he uttered the last syllable.</p><p>His aura coalesced, pressing down on Qingyuan like a towering mountain.</p><p>Having heard the young mistress describe her experience in the teahouse, he knew this storyteller was no ordinary person.</p><p>However, the Yin family's young mistress had been manipulated for nearly two days, a restriction placed upon her mind.  If word of this spread, it would be a great humiliation, something the Yin family could not tolerate.</p><p>Lin Baoshan had already sent a message to the Yin family and ordered his subordinates to escort the young mistress back to the mountain.</p><p>Coming here alone was a gamble, risking his life to test Qingyuan's abilities.</p><p>This way, the Yin family could formulate an appropriate response.</p><p>If Qingyuan truly was a top-tier expert, the Yin family would only lose a single retainer, not an irreconcilable blood feud.</p><p>It wouldn't provoke a powerful enemy, leading to the Yin family’s crippling or even annihilation.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Qingyuan could see through Lin Baoshan’s intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang sat up slightly straighter.</p><p>Qingyuan stopped speaking and said seriously, “Fellow Daoist Lin, please make your move.”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A fierce wind suddenly swept through the private room.</p><p>Lin Baoshan raised his hands, his palms surging with azure light, his skin turning as rough as bark, like wood.</p><p>Within the dense azure light, his arms and fingers, like withered branches, rapidly regained their vitality.</p><p>Above his palms, streaks of azure light intertwined like pythons, forming an apparition that quickly transformed into a wooden stake.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The wooden stake trembled, as if shaking the very void, yet it unexpectedly faded and vanished.</p><p>Simultaneously, a rune woven from what appeared to be vines materialized above Qingyuan’s head.</p><p>Without any warning, the wooden stake reappeared through the rune.</p><p>This move was truly unexpected.</p><p>The next moment, Lin Baoshan froze in astonishment.</p><p>The wooden stake, having materialized above Qingyuan, should have slammed down on him, but instead, it floated down like a leaf into Qingyuan’s hand, and Lin Baoshan completely lost control over it.</p><p>“An interesting Daoist technique.  Did you create it yourself? To achieve this level with your cultivation is quite remarkable,” Qingyuan held the wooden stake, rotating his wrist, an approving look on his face. “According to your intention, if this Daoist technique were perfected, it should be able to manifest a true spiritual tree, right?  Like this?”</p><p>The wooden stake suddenly sprouted branches and roots, reaching the ceiling of the private room in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Everyone was enveloped in its shade, leaving Lin Baoshan dumbfounded.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at Qingyuan’s hand, his mind reeling.</p><p>Facing Lin Baoshan’s attack, Qin Sang had countless ways to neutralize it, but even his true body couldn’t replicate this.</p><p>Qingyuan hadn’t simply confined the wooden stake, nor had he merely severed Lin Baoshan’s control over it.  He had directly claimed it as his own.</p><p>The True Essence, divine sense, and everything contained within the Daoist technique now belonged to Qingyuan, having nothing to do with Lin Baoshan anymore.</p><p>It was as if Qingyuan himself had cast the technique, yet throughout the entire process, not a single ripple of True Essence emanated from him.</p><p>Moreover, the wooden stake remained unchanged throughout.</p><p>Before Qingyuan stimulated its life force, there wasn’t the slightest fluctuation within or around the stake.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body could have dispersed the stake, or confined it with a powerful divine ability, preserving its form, or even replicated the Daoist technique.</p><p>But he absolutely couldn’t have, upon seeing it for the first time, so effortlessly claimed it as his own.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qingyuan flicked his finger, dispersing the small tree, and looked at Lin Baoshan with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior, for your mercy.  This junior will take his leave.”</p><p>Lin Baoshan couldn't comprehend the intricacies, but he knew Qingyuan was immensely powerful, powerful beyond imagination.  He bowed deeply and respectfully retreated.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of death, but the disparity in their strength was too vast; a desperate fight would be meaningless.</p><p>Lin Baoshan came and went quickly.</p><p>He had barely left when another knock came at the door.  This time, it was the proprietor of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant, an elderly man with a head full of silver hair but a vigorous spirit.</p><p>“The three variations of the Drunken Fragrance Feast, the Seven-Course Feast, the Eight-Jade Feast, and the Nine-Treasure Feast, have all had their main ingredients delivered from the provincial capital.  Which one would you like to order, Sir?” The proprietor presented several wooden plaques with the dishes written on them.</p><p>Qingyuan gestured. “The Daoist is our honored guest.”</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the plaques. From the names alone, elegant as they were, he couldn't discern much.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang asked a question that left both Qingyuan and the proprietor stunned.  “Which one has steamed buns?” (End of Chapter)</p>
