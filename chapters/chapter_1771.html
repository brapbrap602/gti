<h1>Chapter 1762: Poison Curse</h1><p>After inquiring about Qin Sang's purpose, the Roaming Emissary left Qin Sang where he was and turned to enter the rear hall.</p><p>A stick of incense later.</p><p>The Roaming Emissary returned, "Agreed! The Sect Master of the璇玑 Sect and that senior are close friends. If fellow Daoist can present a token and visit, the senior will write a letter inviting the Sect Master of the璇玑 Sect to emerge from seclusion."</p><p>It just so happened that he encountered a close friend of the璇玑 Sect Master, but Qin Sang wasn't surprised. Most Alchemy Grandmasters had extensive social connections.</p><p>This way, he could settle this matter once and for all, and focus on secluded cultivation for his breakthrough after completing the Dharma Decree.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, cupping his hands, "This humble Daoist is willing to accept this Dharma Decree."</p><p>He still didn't know the specific content of the Dharma Decree.</p><p>The Roaming Emissary would only issue the decree after confirming the candidate.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Roaming Emissary didn't directly bestow the decree, but said indifferently, "Fellow Daoist, when you visited, another fellow Daoist also chose this Dharma Decree. According to convention, one person must be chosen from the two of you. Of course, the two fellow Daoists can also negotiate and accept the decree together."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang frowned deeply.</p><p>Completing the Dharma Decree together might be easier, but it also meant splitting the reward, which wasn't what he wanted.</p><p>Moreover, joining forces with a stranger of unknown origin might not be agreeable.</p><p>Qin Sang still had more faith in himself, and said in a deep voice, "I wonder how the Roaming Emissary plans to choose?"</p><p>Depending on the task in the Dharma Decree, the Dao Court had corresponding methods to select suitable candidates.</p><p>The Roaming Emissary nodded, "Seeing that fellow Daoist is not prepared to join forces with that other Daoist, it seems your thoughts align. This time, you may face powerful enemies, so let's decide the victor based on strength…"</p><p>Saying this, the Roaming Emissary gestured with his hand and led the way towards the rear hall.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Roaming Emissary through the main hall.  The scene before him blurred, and a sea of fog appeared ahead.</p><p>Entering the sea of fog, his vision was obstructed, and at the same time, Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure.</p><p>After a few breaths, the fog parted ahead, revealing a large open area, forming a fog platform. A tall and thin Daoist priest was waiting there.</p><p>Seeing the two, the Daoist priest quickly stepped forward, first bowed to the Roaming Emissary, and said, "My thanks for your trouble," then looked at Qin Sang, "This humble Daoist is Yun Wei of Lougu Mountain. This fellow Daoist looks unfamiliar. May I ask for your Daoist title?"</p><p>"Qing Feng."</p><p>Qin Sang's words were concise and comprehensive as he calmly assessed Yun Wei.</p><p>Judging by his aura, although it wasn't as profound and unfathomable as the Ninth Heaven Roaming Emissary beside him, he also possessed the cultivation of late Nascent Soul.</p><p>Yun Wei was slightly taken aback, but then his expression returned to normal. He said, "The one contending with this humble Daoist for the Dharma Decree must be you, fellow Daoist. I have a small request. Could fellow Daoist yield this opportunity to me? I will not let you leave empty-handed and am willing to offer a bottle of spirit pills."</p><p>While Qin Sang was observing him, he was also observing Qin Sang. He only felt that Qin Sang's aura seemed erratic, but with a sense of mystery that he couldn't see through.</p><p>Yun Wei's thoughts raced. If his strength was inferior, he would directly take action and send him away; this type of person was the most troublesome.</p><p>If he could persuade him to retreat with a bottle of spirit pills, it would be a happy outcome for everyone.</p><p>Yun Wei took out a porcelain bottle, his tone sincere, "This opportunity to request Master Ling Xu to refine pills is of utmost importance to me. If fellow Daoist can part with it, I would be eternally grateful."</p><p>Unfortunately, even with Yun Wei's eloquent persuasion, Qin Sang remained unmoved, not even bothering to check what pills were inside the porcelain bottle.  "Apologies, but this humble Daoist also has compelling reasons."</p><p>Yun Wei put away the spirit pills with a disappointed look. "It seems we can only settle this with our own hands."</p><p>…</p><p>The Roaming Emissary explained the rules to the two and retreated to the side, leaving them in the arena.</p><p>The duel had almost no rules, with no restrictions on their methods.  If someone was forced out of the fog platform or voluntarily surrendered, they were deemed the loser. In principle, the fight should end when a clear victor emerged, but if both sides became truly enraged or the fight became too intense to hold back, deaths and injuries weren't unheard of.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the center of the fog platform and stood still, quietly watching his opponent, making no other movements.</p><p>Yun Wei opposite him didn't summon any troops, but raised a finger and tapped in front of him. A profound yellow talisman materialized, and then a Bagua Profound Shield appeared beside him, slowly rotating around Yun Wei.</p><p>"It seems this person cultivates the Golden Seal School…"</p><p>Seeing that Yun Wei hadn't deployed a formation, Qin Sang inwardly relaxed.</p><p>He hadn't had the chance to fight against a Daoist cultivator of the Troop Command School, but judging from various information, Troop Command School Daoist cultivators were the most troublesome.</p><p>A Nascent Soul level Troop Command School Daoist cultivator would definitely have a Transformation stage Great Yao by their side, and countless Yao soldiers under their command. The divine abilities unleashed by the combined power of the Yao soldiers were extraordinary.</p><p>He hesitated to move, wanting to see which school Yun Wei belonged to before considering how to respond.</p><p>He intended to keep using the identity of Daoist Priest Qing Feng, and had spent a great deal of effort cultivating it over the years.</p><p>What he displayed in front of the Ninth Heaven Roaming Emissary now, he would have to maintain in the future, preferably without any inconsistencies.</p><p>Feigning a Dragon Tiger School Daoist cultivator, relying solely on physical strength techniques, was the easiest.</p><p>However, neither the *Heavenly Yao Refining Form* nor the two physical strength divine abilities had been cultivated to their peak. Against a Troop Command School Daoist cultivator, he wasn't entirely confident.</p><p>Seeing Yun Wei condense three Profound Shields in succession and prepare to cast a spell, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. His figure flickered, and he lunged straight towards his opponent.</p><p>As a battlefield, this fog platform was ultimately a bit cramped.</p><p>If all went well, Qin Sang could reach Yun Wei in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's aggressive momentum, Yun Wei remained calm in the face of danger. With a flick of his wrist, a blue light streaked through the air.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>A splashing sound. The blue light shattered in front of Qin Sang, and then a gigantic figure leaped out of the void.</p><p>The giant was three zhang tall, immensely powerful, and clad in armor. The blue armor resembled a lake.</p><p>"Seize him!"</p><p>Yun Wei pointed at Qin Sang and shouted coldly.</p><p>The giant looked down at Qin Sang as if he were an ant. Upon receiving the order, it raised its arms, and its massive, fan-like palms suddenly clapped together.</p><p>Qin Sang happened to be between the palms. He only felt the wind buffeting his face, an astonishing pressure everywhere.</p><p>He formed the Lotus Heart Seal. His figure flickered erratically, vanishing from between the giant's palms as if he were never there.</p><p>Yun Wei's eyes flashed with a dark light, swiftly scanning the area around the giant. He immediately spotted Qin Sang's trace, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>At the same time, the giant roared, clenching its fists and smashing them towards its own forehead.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang appeared directly in front of the giant, forming the Demon Subduing Seal with one hand and lightly pressing it against the giant's forehead.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>The giant fell backward with a crash, its body instantly shattering into pieces, annihilated by Qin Sang's single strike.</p><p>Yun Wei hadn't expected the giant to be so vulnerable. Fortunately, he wasn't incompetent and didn't panic. A mass of Yuan Qi flew out from the top of his head, transforming into a vortex in mid-air.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the fog surrounding the platform was drawn towards the vortex, surging in layers.  Midway, it coalesced into masses, then transformed into grotesque fog beasts. With a roll on the ground, sparks of intelligence flickered in their eyes.</p><p>In an instant, a legion of fog beasts appeared out of thin air before Yun Wei.</p><p>The fog beasts surrounded Qin Sang. Judging by their behavior, they didn't seem like stiff puppets, but rather living beings.</p><p>"Spirit Imbuing Deployment!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned slightly serious.</p><p>Spirit Imbuing Deployment was also a renowned divine ability of the Daoist sects in this world. He had long heard of this divine ability.</p><p>By using this technique, one could conjure troops out of thin air, known as Dharma Soldiers, which were similar to another type of Daoist Talisman Soldiers.</p><p>Even without cultivating the Troop Command School, one could possess troops by relying on Spirit Imbuing Deployment or Talisman Soldiers.</p><p>Daoist Talisman Soldiers relied on talismans; one less talisman meant one less soldier. Dharma Soldiers, on the other hand, consumed the caster's True Yuan. As long as True Yuan was sufficient, they could be created endlessly.</p><p>Legend had it that if one cultivated the Spirit Imbuing Deployment divine ability to its peak, one could directly control humans, Yaos, ghosts, and monsters for their own use.  Yun Wei clearly hadn't reached this level.</p><p>These Dharma Soldiers were ultimately inanimate objects, lacking the intelligence of true troops.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He activated the Lotus Heart Seal, moving like a phantom, constantly shifting among the fog beast Dharma Soldiers.</p><p>Wherever he passed, the fog beast Dharma Soldiers crumbled and vanished in swathes. However, more fog beast Dharma Soldiers continuously replenished their ranks.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang was surrounded.  The fog beast Dharma Soldiers were individually fragile, but combined, they possessed an intangible momentum. Once the formation was established, no matter how many Qin Sang dispersed, they could regenerate on the spot, possessing a kind of immortality.</p><p>Yun Wei smiled. This divine ability of his was specifically designed to exhaust Yao cultivators and physical cultivators, and it had never failed him.</p><p>He chanted incantations, preparing to manipulate the Dharma Soldiers to trap Qin Sang. His brow furrowed imperceptibly as he stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>He felt that Qin Sang seemed to have undergone some kind of change, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, surrounded by Dharma Soldiers, appeared unhurried, a faint smile playing on his lips as he walked towards Yun Wei as if strolling through a courtyard.</p><p>With each step Qin Sang took, the formation in that area inexplicably ceased to exist. The fog beast Dharma Soldiers, originally capable of infinite regeneration, completely vanished after dispersing, leaving large gaps in the formation.</p><p>This was the first time Yun Wei had encountered a physical cultivator who could so easily break this formation, and he was inwardly shocked.</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Roaming Emissary, who was observing the fight, also had a glint in his eyes as he re-evaluated Qin Sang.</p><p>"Great Freedom Seal, so that's it!" Qin Sang exclaimed inwardly.</p><p>Finally, today, he had grasped some of the profound mysteries of the Vajra Great Freedom Seal.</p><p>If Qin Sang were to describe this seal with one word, it would be instinct.</p><p>The moment he used this seal, he seemed to enter a peculiar state. Everything on the battlefield couldn't escape his perception; his opponent's weaknesses were instantly apparent.</p><p>His perception had reached its peak. This perception wasn't the spiritual awareness gained from powerful divine sense, but pure instinct.</p><p>Fighting was his instinct!</p><p>If Yun Wei had personally entered the fray, there might not have been many flaws to exploit. However, these fog beast Dharma Soldiers weren't Yun Wei himself. Even if Yun Wei could control them with his will, there was still a layer of separation.</p><p>The seemingly seamless formation, in Qin Sang's eyes, was riddled with flaws. A single finger, a single palm, could sever the formation.</p><p>"This seal technique…"</p><p>Immersed in this wondrous state, Qin Sang marveled inwardly, his appraisal of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seals* rising another level.</p><p>He had initially thought the seventh seal was like the previous six, enhancing a particular aspect.  He had underestimated it. This seal brought about a comprehensive transformation, elevating this seal technique to a whole new level.</p><p>With this seal, Qin Sang, who was inexperienced in close combat, now had the confidence to face even the most formidable experts in this field!</p><p>"If I were to use the Vajra Great Freedom Seal with the Spirit Wood Body…"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he was eager to try.</p><p>Although there was no flourishing forest within the Immortal City, and the Acquired Wood Figure Stele was restricted, the Spirit Wood Body itself could greatly enhance his physical body.</p><p>At this time, Yun Wei repeatedly cast spells, controlling the Dharma Soldiers to change formations.  But no matter what formation he used, it couldn't stop Qin Sang's advance. His expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang rapidly closing in, Yun Wei finally made up his mind.  Light flickered between his eyebrows, reflecting into the void.</p><p>As if an invisible brush were at work in the void, an incredibly complex rune was drawn, completed in a single stroke. The fog beast Dharma Soldiers below seamlessly integrated with the rune's Qi. Each fog beast Dharma Soldier became an aperture, their Qi interconnected, instantly forming a massive talisman!</p><p>"Suppress!"</p><p>Yun Wei roared.</p><p>Suddenly, all the Dharma Soldiers shattered, transforming into streams of pure profound Qi that merged into the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang felt something strange above him.  Looking up, he saw a blue, ruler-shaped talisman descending, a terrifying pressure bearing down from the heavens.</p><p>At this moment, both figures on the fog platform vanished.  The vortex above Yun Wei's head expanded countless times, enveloping the entire platform.</p><p>Qin Sang was undoubtedly at the center of the vortex.</p><p>While casting the talisman, Yun Wei quickly retrieved a copper whistle and placed it to his lips.  Just as he was about to blow it, he suddenly felt the void tremble violently.</p><p>The source of the tremor was his own talisman.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The tremor intensified, followed by a tearing sound.</p><p>A withered arm pierced through the vortex like a sharp sword, its palm morphing into a blade. With a downward swipe, it split the vortex in two.</p><p>Streams of water gushed from the collapsing vortex, revealing a tall, imposing tree-man, standing there like a mountain.</p><p>Yun Wei stared at the tree-man, stunned, and instinctively blew the whistle.</p><p>A whistle sounded.</p><p>True Yuan poured from Yun Wei's body into the copper whistle, then erupted as a purple rainbow.  The purple rainbow touched the water flow in the void and instantly vanished.</p><p>Following this, the seemingly harmless water flow underwent a bizarre transformation.</p><p>Countless tadpole-like, writhing runes swam within the water, omnipresent.  As the runes twisted, grotesque, ghost-like faces constantly flashed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The water flow, carrying countless evil ghosts, surged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before reaching Qin Sang, the water flow abruptly dispersed, the evil ghosts vanishing.</p><p>At the same time, a gray, ghostly shadow suddenly appeared on Qin Sang's chest, like a tattoo, flashing and then disappearing, as if it had invaded his body.</p><p>A smile spread across Yun Wei's face.</p><p>From the beginning of the duel, he had laid his traps layer by layer, and finally succeeded!</p><p>These water flows, seemingly harmless remnants of the talisman, had been secretly imbued with a spell. Once he activated the copper whistle, the two powers would fuse, instantly transforming into a rare and potent poison.  Combined with his poison curse, it was unexpected, and his opponent wouldn't have time to react before being poisoned, their combat strength greatly diminished.</p><p>The next moment, Yun Wei's smile froze.</p><p>He saw Qin Sang flying towards him like a bolt of lightning, showing no signs of being poisoned.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The astonishing momentum that rushed towards him shook Yun Wei's mind. He hurriedly placed the three Bagua Profound Shields in front of him.</p><p>With a few bangs, Qin Sang smashed through the shields with punches and kicks. The shields shattered and flew, unable to offer any resistance.</p><p>Yun Wei's expression changed uncertainly, as if he was hesitating about something. Finally, he let out a long sigh and gritted his teeth, shouting, "I concede!"</p><p>He still had unused methods, but most were related to poison curses.  Judging by his opponent's current performance, it was hard to say how effective they would be.</p><p>There were other alchemists in the world besides Master Ling Xu. Why risk his life here and expose all his trump cards?</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Demon Subduing Seal arrived with the force of wind and thunder, stopping just short of Yun Wei's face.</p><p>Qin Sang's body swayed as he took half a step back, withdrawing his Spirit Wood Body, and cupping his hands, he said, "You have my respect!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
