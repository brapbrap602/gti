Chapter 439: The Light Band


The Deputy Island Master Xiao's figure flickered, and he swiftly departed.
At this time, streaks of escaping light flew over their heads, following Deputy Island Master Xiao southward.
Qin Sang keenly sensed that some gazes held a sympathetic meaning, indicating that a considerable number had been forcibly conscripted by Deputy Island Master Xiao.
"Greetings, Senior Brother Mu!"
Someone flew out of the formation on their sword, landing before them.
"Junior Brother Zhan!"
Mu Yifeng recognized him and introduced both parties.
It turned out to be fellow disciples.
"Junior Brother Qin, this is Junior Brother Zhan Yi, a direct disciple of Master Uncle Che, highly valued by Master Uncle Che, and works on Stargazing Island.  This is Junior Brother Qin Sang, Junior Brother Jie, and Junior Brother Mao… Junior Brother Zhan, is Master Uncle Che not here?"
Zhan Yi shook his head.  "Master is to the east, also gathering personnel, like Senior Xiao.  The incident happened suddenly, there's a manpower shortage on the island, so we have to conscript disciples traveling from various sects."
Qin Sang sighed inwardly, it seemed there was no escape; no matter which direction they went, they couldn't avoid it.
Mu Yifeng hesitated. "Junior Brother Qin is under the orders of Master Uncle Qi Yuanshou to oversee the sect's medicinal garden, he has a task, and urgently needs to return to the sect to report. I wonder if there's any flexibility?"
Zhan Yi apologetically glanced at Qin Sang and sighed softly. "I'm afraid not. The conscription order was issued by the Island Master himself; no one can disobey. Even if Master Uncle Qi himself were here, he would likely be stopped and unable to leave. Senior Brother Mu just returned from the battlefield, with unhealed wounds, so he can be excused and return to Stargazing Island to heal.  Senior Brother Qin and the others must go…"
"This…"
"Forget it!"
Qin Sang shook his head, preventing Mu Yifeng from further pleading. "Don't trouble Junior Brother Zhan. We'll go, we'll entrust the other junior brothers to Senior Brother Mu."
Mu Yifeng was at his wit's end and could only say, "The battlefield is chaotic, it's not an ordinary magical battle. Junior Brother Qin, don't be careless; communicate with Junior Brother Zhan whenever you encounter problems."
Zhan Yi bowed. "Both senior brothers, rest assured.  I will certainly help in any way I can. Furthermore, the main purpose of this trip is to rescue Senior Fang and the others, it may not necessarily involve a major battle.  The Island Master has personally gone there; Master and the others are just being cautious. Don't worry too much."
Mu Yifeng took the Qi Condensation disciples back to Stargazing Island. Qin Sang and the other two could only obey and follow Deputy Island Master Xiao south.
On the way, Qin Sang learned more about Deputy Island Master Xiao's identity from Zhan Yi.
This person was not from any of the major sects, but the disciple of the City Lord of Yinshan Pass, with surprisingly high cultivation, at the astonishing Golden Core late stage. His status on Stargazing Island was very high, second only to the Island Master!
Qin Sang secretly thought, no wonder. He couldn't even think of resisting Deputy Island Master Xiao; the pressure emanating from him was more terrifying than any Golden Core cultivator he had ever encountered.
Earlier, Deputy Island Master Xiao had casually formed a water dragon and easily broke through the Ghost Luo Cloud, imprisoning everyone.
Completely helpless!
If every Golden Core cultivator was this terrifying, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to have any thoughts about the Golden Core cultivator from the Kuiyin Sect.

It was a late Golden Core expert.
Thankfully! Thankfully!
Qin Sang was immensely relieved, then turned to Zhan Yi to inquire about the changing situation.
Unfortunately, Zhan Yi knew very little.
They sped along, and more and more people were conscripted.  All Foundation Establishment cultivators were taken without exception.
The team gradually grew larger, and they encountered two more fellow disciples from Shao Hua Mountain.
Under such circumstances, the bond between fellow disciples worked; they gathered together, and joined forces with those from Taiyi Danzong and Shangyuan Qingjing Palace.
The others were similar to Qin Sang and his group, looking for help, supporting each other.
They went in a large circle, and returned to the Chaotic Island waters.
Qin Sang secretly chuckled wryly.
At this time, the Chaotic Island waters were no longer desolate, having gathered over a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators, clustered in groups of three or five, occupying small islands, unable to settle down for cultivation.
As they arrived, dozens of escaping lights flew in from the east.
When both sides met, Qin Sang saw the person leading the group wearing a Red Dust Gourd around his waist—it was the long-lost Master Uncle Che Yutao.
After many years, Che Yutao still gave Qin Sang the same profound feeling.
Their cultivation was a whole realm apart; such a huge gap meant that unless Che Yutao actively revealed it, Qin Sang couldn't perceive his true cultivation level.
"Wait here for orders!"
Deputy Island Master Cai's voice rang out, and Qin Sang found that Deputy Island Master Cai had disappeared. Turning to look at Che Yutao, he had also vanished at some point.
Knowing that they had rushed to the front lines, Qin Sang prayed that the Sky-Walking Alliance would be sensible and stop when they reached their limits.


Gathering on a small island with fellow disciples, Qin Sang, unfamiliar with most due to infrequent visits to the sect, was introduced to them by Zhan Yi. After introductions, they began planning their strategy for the upcoming battle.

Over a dozen disciples from Shao Hua Mountain were involved, including Teng Zhao Gang, a formidable expert at the False Core stage.  His presence immediately calmed the anxious group, including Jie Ying.

Qin Sang, happy to have a leader, readily pledged allegiance to Teng Zhao Gang, agreeing to follow his commands.  Secretly, however, he was devising his own escape plan.

If the Tianxing League faltered, he planned to use his stealthy Ebony Sword to ambush enemies, aiming for a significant contribution.  He would strike swiftly and retreat.  Should the situation turn unfavorable, he would prioritize his escape.

With his extensive experience, he trusted his judgment and vowed not to overextend himself, thus minimizing risk to his life.  His biggest fear was getting caught in the crossfire of Core Formation cultivators. If that happened, escape would be his only option.

Unable to see the battlefield from their location in the chaotic island waters, they anxiously awaited the outcome of the Core Formation cultivators' battle, its eventual conclusion uncertain.  Amidst this tension, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, meditating to prepare himself for the coming chaos.

As night fell, a crescent moon hung high, the stars brilliant.  The only sound was the restless waves, their glittering surface mirroring the disciples' anxious hearts.

Then, a sharp, piercing sound tore through the night, approaching from afar.  The island waters erupted in chaos.

“They’re here!”
“Form the array!”  someone shouted.

From numerous islands, figures soared into the air, their lights illuminating the night.  Qin Sang opened his eyes, gripping his Cold Gold Sword and Yin-Yang Compass.  He took his position beside Teng Zhao Gang, flanking him with Zhan Yi, as planned. Disciples from Taiyi Danzong and Shangyuan Qingjinggong also joined their ranks.

Tension gripped everyone.  Above the desolate islands, a luminous band of light, rivaling the starlight, appeared.
