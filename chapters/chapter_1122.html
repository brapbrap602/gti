<h1>Chapter 1114: The Mysterious Tablet</h1><p>“The forces of the Abyss have recently been quiet, connected to the Purple Micro Palace.  The Abyss and the Purple Micro Palace share a common origin in their formations; cultivators from the Abyss can use a magic portal in the inner palace to directly enter the Purple Micro Palace…”</p><p>Qin Sang learned more secrets from Qing Jun.</p><p>This explained the standoff of spirit formations at the edge of the magic portal.</p><p>Abyss cultivators could actually enter the Purple Micro Palace through the portal. This treasure hunt resulted in mutual vigilance and intense rivalry between the two factions, even leading to several battles on the Celestial Mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful for his alertness, otherwise he would have fallen directly into the Abyss's trap.</p><p>Qing Jun’s tone shifted, she sneered coldly: “It’s laughable that some people think the Abyss is weakening and that they're safe, secretly causing trouble. The internal strife within the Pure Yang Sect is their doing.  Seeing that the new sect leader is unstable, they're trying to split the sect.  However, I've always felt something was off about the Abyss. While it seemed like a back-and-forth battle, the Abyss may not have been attacking with full force. When they will return is still unknown. You needn't worry for now, you can focus on your cultivation in Peach Blossom Valley. Of course, once the war resumes, you can't remain hidden. You cultivate the Killing Path Sword Scripture, you excel at killing and will thrive on the battlefield…”</p><p>“I am also a cultivator from the Xiaohan Region, I will do my part if needed!”</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, not shirking his responsibility.</p><p>He calculated inwardly. When the Abyss amasses its forces to attack, at the very least, he will have recovered to the late Core Formation stage. With his abilities, as long as he doesn’t face a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss alone, he'll have few opponents.</p><p>Disguised as a Yuan Shen Gate elder, with his senior sister covering for him, he wouldn't worry about being exposed by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The cultivation world rarely experiences such peace. He must seize this time to cultivate.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>If the Abyss’s actions were a bit slower, he might have already formed his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something he'd been pondering, and asked: “Senior Sister, is the Azure Bird puppet still with you? May I take a look?”</p><p>He also cultivated his physical body. Now his "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique has reached the late third-layer stage. Reaching the peak of the third layer was only a matter of time.</p><p>From Senior Qingzhu, he learned that strengthening the body and spirit might help with Nascent Soul formation, so Qin Sang had this idea. If possible, before forming his Nascent Soul, he wanted to breakthrough to the fourth layer of "Heavenly Demon Transformation."</p><p>However, there was a hidden worry.</p><p>The technique Qin Sang cultivated used the Azure Bird puppet Qing Jun had crafted as a visualization object; its aura couldn't compare to that of a real Azure Bird. Although he could cultivate using it, the foundation was unstable, and Qin Sang wasn’t sure how far he could go.</p><p>According to the cultivation technique, the Heavenly Demon Dharma Image was crucial to breaking through to the fourth layer.</p><p>He wasn't sure if he could comprehend the Azure Bird Dharma Image just by visualizing the puppet.</p><p>Qing Jun had once said that she had seen a real Azure Bird, felt its aura, that's why the puppet was so realistic, imbued with the true aura of the Azure Bird.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang finished speaking, the tea mist in front of Qing Jun fluctuated, and where the mist condensed, an Azure Bird spread its wings and flew out.</p><p>Its cry was clear and melodious.</p><p>The space in the wooden house was limited, so the puppet didn't show its true size.</p><p>Even so, its posture was extremely beautiful. Its phoenix wings scattered divine light, flying around the two of them, its voice carrying a hint of joy, like a living creature.</p><p>“It should still remember you…”</p><p>Qing Jun looked at the Azure Bird with more gentleness in her eyes, and spoke softly.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a weight on his shoulder. The Azure Bird landed on him, very comfortable, preening its feathers, like greeting an old friend, not at all unfamiliar.</p><p>From the Azure Bird, Qin Sang felt a hint of danger.</p><p>It was evident that the Azure Bird puppet was more than just beautiful.  With its owner's improved cultivation, its strength had also increased.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the Azure Bird carefully.</p><p>Disappointingly, the transformed Azure Bird puppet’s aura wasn't much different from before.</p><p>“I was fortunate enough to see the true form of the Azure Bird, but it wasn’t the real divine beast, only a residual image, and only a fleeting glimpse. Although the Azure Bird left a deep impression on me, in that hurry, the image I could remember is far inferior to the aura of the true divine beast. When carving the Azure Bird puppet, I added a lot of imagination…”</p><p>Qing Jun recalled the Azure Bird puppet, expressing her helplessness.</p><p>“Senior Sister, where did you see that residual image? Is it still there?”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was urgent, asking Qing Jun for guidance.</p><p>Qing Jun recalled: “The Azure Bird phantom came from a mysterious tablet, discovered in a secret realm.”</p><p>When the stone tablet appeared, I wasn't alone.  My cultivation was weak then, I wasn't qualified to compete for it.  It ultimately ended up in the hands of a demon king.”</p><p>“A demon king?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected this connection to a demon king.  “A demon king from the Demon Realm?”</p><p>“Correct.  The stone tablet sealing the Qingluan phantom is considered a priceless treasure among the demon beasts.  Only that demon king knows what’s truly within it…”</p><p>Qing Jun nodded in agreement.</p><p>They chatted for a while longer, but Qing Jun was ready to see Qin Sang off.  She mentioned that she would be traveling soon and wasn't sure when she'd return, entrusting Qin Sang with the care of the peach orchard.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't ask any more questions, leaving the hut and returning to her cave dwelling.</p><p>“That mysterious stone tablet is in the hands of a Demon Realm demon king. This is tricky…”</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, troubled.</p><p>Although the demon race and the human race have made a pact and the demons contributed to the recent battle against the Abyss of Sin, there remains distrust and even hostility towards humans.</p><p>During the bi-realm alliance meetings, the demon king rarely appears.</p><p>Most of the time, communication between the two realms is handled through the Imperial Spirit Sect.</p><p>Such an important artifact; how could the demon king easily lend it to the human race for examination?</p><p>“Under these circumstances, Senior Sister wouldn’t offend the demon king.  Elder Youyouzi frequently travels to the Demon Realm; he must have connections with some demons and might understand that demon king’s temperament…”</p><p>Qin Sang considered the possibilities.</p><p>“There's no rush.  There’s an excellent place for the Star Yuan Infusion—the Zhitain Peak.  Breaking through to the fourth level might not require examining the stone tablet. For now, I should focus on cultivating the *Sky Demon Refining Form* to its third-level peak.”</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision.</p><p>Becoming a Yuan Shen Gate elder, there's no need to rush into subduing the Mo Yan Gate.  From now on, I'll just focus on cultivation. Before seclusion, I'll commission various trading houses and factions to procure the necessary items.</p><p>As many cultivation-enhancing pills as possible.</p><p>Then there are the powerful blood fruits, green mist roots, and scorpion venom herbs, and other demon fruits that aid in the *Sky Demon Refining Form*.</p><p>Qin Sang learned of these demon fruits’ effects from the demon race’s classics from the Demon Sea.</p><p>The demon race in the Xiao Han domain is isolated; their heritage is surely not as complete as those in the Demon Sea. They might not know the effects of those demon fruits, maybe there are some overlooked ones.</p><p>In addition, there are spirit herbs needed to feed the Sky Eye Butterflies and Fire Jade Centipedes, which shouldn't be difficult to obtain in the Xiao Han domain.</p><p>…</p><p>When all is said and done, he needs quite a lot, and each item is quite expensive.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang brought back many demon cores and bones from the Canglang Sea; selling them will cover the expenses.</p>
