<h1>Chapter 1972: The Jitian Assembly</h1><p>Yu Lang held the decree; the characters on it glowed brightly.</p><p>"It's Master!"</p><p>Tao Teng, monitoring the situation, sent a voice transmission, his tone a mixture of joy and worry.</p><p>He and Yu Lang had suspected his master was behind it all, and now it was confirmed.</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master, mentioned by the Kuang family, was Tao Teng's master, a cultivator from Yun Du.</p><p>Lines of characters floated before him.</p><p>Yu Lang read them word by word, finally understanding.</p><p>From the Yun Du Mountain faction, more cultivators than just he and Tao Teng had been sent down, including Zhao Du and many others.</p><p>But why not let these people join forces, unite the armies of the various countries, and become a single, cooperative force to defeat the enemy faster?</p><p>It turned out this was a kind of selection process.</p><p>Under his rule, Yan had flourished.</p><p>With its wise governance and strong military, Yan stood out, and Yu Lang became the chosen one.</p><p>Subsequently, Yan and the surrounding countries, all under Yun Du's influence, were placed under his command – he was essentially the supreme commander.</p><p>His mission: to help Yan unify the land!</p><p>However, Yu Lang noticed that the so-called "land," the countries mentioned on the decree, included only ten or so nations near Yan, Qi, and Liang.</p><p>This was only a part of the human world.</p><p>In other words, similar events were likely happening elsewhere.</p><p>The human world was divided into regions, each a chessboard where the pieces battled, their outcome affecting the entire game.</p><p>Perhaps he was only temporarily chosen.</p><p>The winners of each chessboard would compete again until a "Heaven-Mandated One" was selected!</p><p>"What does Yun Du intend to do?"</p><p>Yu Lang stroked the decree, questioning.</p><p>"Do they want to unify the human world, leaving only one nation, ending the chaos?</p><p>"But the human world is so vast, its territory far beyond human comprehension; its governance is beyond the capabilities of mortals.</p><p>"How to control the regions? How to ensure that orders are followed?</p><p>"To say nothing of the imperial examinations; by the time border citizens travel to the capital, years would have passed.</p><p>"The human world isn't lacking ambitious rulers, nor the ambition to unify the land; it's not a matter of unwillingness but inability.</p><p>"Unless…"</p><p>Yu Lang had a sudden realization.</p><p>Unless cultivators ceased their seclusion, entered the government, and governed with magic, solving all problems.</p><p>Yu Lang looked at the seven Kuang brothers, seemingly understanding.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Yan's capital.</p><p>Cloud Immortal Master's cave.</p><p>Today, the stone gate was open, and an uninvited guest arrived.</p><p>In the deep autumn, a chill was already in the air; yet, inside the cave, it was warm as spring.</p><p>A stone table stood in the cave, with one person seated on each side.</p><p>One was an old man with youthful features, wearing a Yun Du robe; Tao Teng's master, the Cloud Immortal Master.</p><p>The other wore a hooded cloak, obscuring their face completely; compared to the Cloud Immortal Master, they exuded a chilling aura.</p><p>Immortal tea was on the table, but the hooded figure didn't take any, saying coldly, "Yun Shan, are you breaking the agreement by allowing immortals and mortals to mix?"</p><p>"What agreement? Back then, that demonic Mirror Hidden dared to ascend our sect's mountain gate.  If the sect leader hadn't ordered us not to kill messengers, that demon would have been killed on the spot!  No matter what that demon said, the sect leader made no promises!" the Cloud Immortal Master sneered.</p><p>The hooded figure snorted, "Shameless old man, you force me to state it outright? If Old Cloud Hermit and your master hadn't tacitly agreed, how could this have happened!"</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master scoffed.</p><p>"Times change. We only thought you truly wanted to use the human world as a chessboard, to minimize casualties between our sects and prevent others from taking advantage.</p><p>"As expected, your demonic nature remains!</p><p>"Your wicked ambitions cannot be hidden from us; we knew you had ulterior motives.</p><p>"According to your methods, a victor cannot be determined; only more chaos will result, ultimately turning the human world into a hellish land of corpses and demons!</p><p>"We righteous cultivators cannot stand idly by!"</p><p>"How righteous!" The hooded figure cackled sarcastically.</p><p>"Without your indulgence, who could stir up trouble in the human world?</p><p>"First, we used the Falling Soul Abyss to suppress the divine path, preventing the Tai Zhen Sect from interfering and shifting their pressure onto us.  Once chaos arrives, we'll raise the banner of righteousness, using the suppression of demons as an excuse to completely control the human world.</p><p>"From then on, only one nation will remain, all cultivators and gods will be registered in the immortal records, unassailable.</p><p>"Yun Du will have no worries and can wholeheartedly prepare for the Jitian Ceremony.</p><p>"Turning the tide with a flick of the wrist! What righteous actions, what a brilliant scheme!"</p><p>The Cloud Immortal Master remained impassive.</p><p>The hooded figure continued to sneer, "It seems a fight is unavoidable? As far as I know, although we have unearthed many ancient formations in the Fire Domain, if we don't cooperate, we won't meet the Jitian Sect's requirements."</p><p>The reward offered by the Ji Tian Sect is unprecedented!  It should be mutually beneficial. If you miss this opportunity, let's see if Gu Yun Sou will sit idly by!"</p><p>Yun Xian Shi slowly rose, walked to the door, gazed at the rolling mountains, and said softly, "You win on the battlefield, unify the land, and we will naturally keep our distance. The Ji Tian Sect will also follow the orders of Luo Hun Yuan. Isn't this your original intention?"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The cloaked figure slammed the table, vanished in a flash, and disappeared from the cave.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi watched the cloaked figure leave, motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>In Da Liang.</p><p>Along the Du River.</p><p>The battle between two Yuan Ying cultivators was earth-shattering.</p><p>The brilliance of the whisk and the blade clashed in the sky, emitting thunderous booms that darkened the heavens.</p><p>The river surface froze and shattered alternately. Both armies retreated ten miles, and no one dared to approach the riverbank.</p><p>Tao Teng and others did their best to reassure the army, achieving some success.</p><p>Everyone watched the powerful cultivators battle in the sky.</p><p>For a time, the ancestor of the Kuang family and Yu Lao Mo fought evenly.</p><p>A thick fog enveloped the river, and the two figures appeared and disappeared intermittently.</p><p>Realizing they couldn't quickly determine a victor, Yu Lao Mo lost interest in continuing the fight with the Kuang family ancestor.  He fiercely flung his whisk.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>The light shot towards the Kuang family ancestor's face like a blade.</p><p>With a clang, the Kuang family ancestor intercepted it with his sword. Then Yu Lao Mo transformed into a streak of light and shot upstream along the Du River.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>The Kuang family ancestor roared, giving chase.</p><p>Before leaving, he moved his lips, whispering something. The seven sons of the Kuang family bowed to the river, shouting their assent.</p><p>As the two Yuan Ying cultivators fought and retreated, the fog on the river surface immediately dissipated, revealing the two army camps.</p><p>Both sides' soldiers were still captivated by the previous battle, their minds in a daze, unable to react immediately.</p><p>At this moment, more figures flew out from the east bank camp, revealing over a dozen figures confronting Yu Lang and the others across the river.</p><p>"General Qin! These are all demonic henchmen under Yu Lao Mo, blood-soaked killers! We request permission to leave camp and exterminate them!"</p><p>The eldest of the seven Kuang sons bowed and shouted.</p><p>"Haha!"</p><p>A burst of laughter came from the opposite bank.  "Kuang Shou Yi, on the battlefield, what's the point of talking about righteousness and evil!  Former defeated foe, quickly come and die!"</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't fully adjusted to his new position.</p><p>After inquiring, he learned that among the seven Kuang sons, only the sixth and seventh sons had comparable cultivation to his. The remaining five were stronger, with the eldest and second sons being False Core cultivators.</p><p>Yet, they were now taking orders from him, requesting to fight.</p><p>"Phew!"</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but sigh, calming himself, and said in a deep voice, "Immortal Cultivator Kuang, I now appoint you as the vanguard general. Quickly go to the front and take the enemy general's head to boost our morale!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Kuang Shou Yi responded loudly, summoned a spiritual sword, and charged.</p><p>Simultaneously, five more of the seven Kuang sons followed Kuang Shou Yi towards the enemy formation.</p><p>The seventh Kuang son remained behind, patted his pouch, and took out dozens of triangular apricot-yellow flags, presenting them with both hands.</p><p>"Reporting to General Qin, these are the Blood Origin Flags personally refined by the ancestor at the behest of Yun Xian Shi."</p><p>Yu Lang took the Blood Origin Flags, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>As Qin Sang's disciple, Qin Sang sometimes let him study alchemical texts.</p><p>These Blood Origin Flags were unlike any other magical artifacts he had seen, suggesting they had a special function.</p><p>"With the army arrayed, the blood energy soars, and ghosts are dispersed upon approach.  By harnessing the blood energy, one can transcend the ordinary. The Blood Origin Flags have this effect. General Qin, distribute these flags to the three armies, use them as the foundation, and practice the formations. Led by cultivators, wherever the blade points, blood energy flows like a dragon, and enemy cultivators will not dare to enter the battlefield to slaughter at will."</p><p>The seventh Kuang son quickly explained.</p><p>Hearing this, Yu Lang's eyes lit up.  Ordinary people were not powerless.</p><p>The blood energy of commoners could also shine brilliantly on the battlefield.</p><p>Although this power was not strong, it could still influence the battle to some degree after high-level cultivators were held back!</p><p>"Where is Tao Teng!"</p><p>Yu Lang turned to the rear.</p><p>"This subordinate is here!"</p><p>Tao Teng no longer concealed his cultivation, flying into the air.</p><p>Yu Lang threw the Blood Origin Flags to Tao Teng, explained their use, and ordered, "Quickly distribute these flags to the generals, practice the formations, and cross the river to attack in a month!"</p><p>Due to the battle between the two Yuan Ying cultivators, the pontoon bridges and warships on the river were severely damaged.</p><p>Both sides would need at least a month to prepare for a river crossing battle.</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>Tao Teng accepted the order and left.</p><p>Yu Lang turned around and saw that six members of the Kuang family were already engaged in battle with the enemy.  Although they weren't as powerful as the two Yuan Ying cultivators, they were making a considerable impact.</p><p>Yu Lang glanced towards the enemy camp and noticed an unusual aura within their ranks – clearly, they also possessed a technique similar to the Blood Yuan Banner.</p><p>At this moment, Sha Jia Yu, who had been observing from the sidelines, sent a voice transmission: "Brother, should I lend a hand?"</p><p>There were no other Yuan Ying cultivators nearby after the Kuang family ancestor and Yu Lao Mo departed. Sha Jia Yu could easily eliminate those lesser demons.</p><p>"No! Though few in number, the Kuang family members coordinate well. As long as they don't lose, we shouldn't interfere unnecessarily.  Don't intervene, Brother Sha, unless absolutely necessary,"</p><p>Yu Lang said in a low voice.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu nodded, remaining as an observer.</p><p>Tao Teng returned after making arrangements.</p><p>Yu Lang handed him a token: "Master Yun has instructed that this token is to be considered his presence.  Take this token, accompany Brother Sha, and quickly visit the major righteous sects to invite assistance. A fierce battle is likely in a month. Also, return to the Daoist temple and inform my master of this matter."</p><p>"What about you?" Tao Teng was concerned. Yu Lang was a significant target; previously, there had been attempts on his life.</p><p>"Senior Kuang has returned. With him present, there's no need to worry about my safety," Yu Lang had learned the outcome of the upstream battle through Sha Jia Yu.  They had fought to a standstill; Yu Lao Mo had suffered a secret setback and retreated on his own initiative.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a streak of green light shot from upstream, landing directly in the command tent without further words.</p><p>"Take care of yourself!"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu and Tao Teng changed into civilian clothes and left secretly.</p><p>Yu Lang watched the Blood Yuan Banner formation drills below, while also observing the battle on the river. Seeing the six Kuang family members gradually falling behind, he immediately ordered a retreat.</p><p>Both sides withdrew, and the situation temporarily stabilized.</p><p>Yu Lang returned to the command tent and saw the Kuang family ancestor meditating cross-legged, so he quietly withdrew without disturbing him.</p><p>The sun set, and the moon rose high.  The day ended. For both armies, however, the world had undergone a dramatic change.</p><p>The next day at noon.</p><p>After a night of rest, the seven Kuang family members proactively challenged the enemy.</p><p>While the battle raged, Sha Jia Yu returned hurriedly, bringing Yu Lang something.</p><p>"After leaving camp, we went to Qingyang Temple. The Taoist priest instructed me to give these to you."</p><p>Sha Jia Yu opened his palm, revealing three smooth bamboo slips, blank and uninscribed.</p><p>"The Taoist priest said that if you encounter danger, light one of these, and he will arrive instantly!" Sha Jia Yu exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>Yu Lang was overjoyed.  Initially somewhat anxious about the heavy burden he had suddenly shouldered, he immediately felt reassured. He took the slips, examined them carefully for a while, and then put them away securely.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu then left.</p><p>…</p><p>Over the next month, more cultivators, mostly Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement stage, gradually arrived at the camp, some with playful intentions, others with arrogant and unruly natures.  However, knowing that the Kuang family ancestor was present, none dared to act recklessly.</p><p>Yu Lang worked methodically, sending out challenges while integrating these cultivators into the army, training them with the Blood Yuan Banner.  In just one month, the army underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>The weather was fine, the river calm. Dozens of figures flew from both banks, engaging in a fierce aerial battle. The armies advanced, deploying warships and pontoon bridges to the east bank.</p><p>A bloody battle ensued on the shore, a chaotic and ferocious clash. Eventually, the Liang Kingdom cultivators were defeated, their army routed and shattered by the Yan Kingdom forces.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom army pressed forward relentlessly, conquering the Liang capital.  Then, countless letters arrived like snowflakes.</p><p>Yu Lang studied a sand table displaying the positions of various kingdoms, including Yan, marked with black and white flags. The current situation was clear at a glance.  As the commander-in-chief, he would lead the armies until a decisive victory or defeat against the forces of the Falling Soul Abyss was achieved.</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Following Liang, Qi was also destroyed by Yan. The Yan army rested, but warfare continued elsewhere, and the situation in the Yun Du Tian region was steadily improving.</p><p>Five years passed.  During this time, Yu Lang spent his days on the battlefield.</p><p>One day, the final battle finally arrived.  The siege had prolonged, and Yu Lang lit one of the bamboo slips for the first time.</p>
