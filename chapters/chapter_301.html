<h1>Chapter 294: Both Wounded</h1><p>Qin Sang led the way, followed by Shangguan Lifeng.  They agreed to switch places after a certain distance, or when Qin Sang's spiritual power was depleted to a certain level.</p><p>A blue light flew out from Qin Sang's storage pouch.  It revealed itself to be a small, ice-blue pearl, the size of a longan fruit.</p><p>Inside the small pearl was a scene of a blizzard, with goose feather-like snowflakes clearly visible, incredibly lifelike.</p><p>Qin Sang's magical tools had been destroyed in the volcanic crater. Before their departure, he had replenished his supply with some practical tools, and this Frost Pearl was one of them. Although only a high-grade tool, it was perfectly suited for this environment.</p><p>The Frost Pearl automatically flew to a position above Qin Sang's head. Snowflakes drifted down from the pearl, forming a curtain of snow around him, constantly swirling.</p><p>When the flames touched the snow curtain, the ice and snow melted, and the flames were extinguished simultaneously, neutralizing each other.</p><p>The snowflakes within the Frost Pearl seemed inexhaustible, continuously falling and replenishing the consumed snow.</p><p>With the help of the magical tool, Qin Sang no longer needed to constantly focus on maintaining his spiritual energy shield. He nodded to Shangguan Lifeng and flew into the sea of fire.</p><p>His vision was filled with swirling flames.</p><p>Initially, the flames weren't very powerful, similar to the stream of flames they had encountered outside.</p><p>The Frost Pearl alone was enough to easily withstand them.</p><p>The swirling snowflakes repelled wave after wave of approaching flames. Qin Sang signaled to Shangguan Lifeng, then increased his speed.</p><p>The color of the flames deepened, and their power increased several times over.</p><p>Layers of flames lashed out, and the snow curtain surrounding Qin Sang became extremely thin, on the verge of being burned through. The Frost Pearl alone was no longer sufficient to withstand the scorching heat; he had to continuously channel spiritual power into it.</p><p>However, these weren't major problems, just normal changes. The true power of the barrier hadn't yet manifested.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained the magical tool while remaining vigilant of his surroundings.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang noticed unusual ripples in the flames ahead. Without hesitation, he summoned his Ebony Sword. Sword energy erupted, slashing forward.</p><p>The sea of fire was instantly split in two by the sword energy.</p><p>Layers of flames parted before his eyes, and the sword energy finally collided with a stream of flames, only to be easily scattered.</p><p>This stream of flames was different from the surrounding fire. It was a pure azure, flying swiftly from the depths of the sea of fire, directly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The violet flames seemed to fear this azure fire, parting to make way for it.</p><p>The moment he saw the azure flame stream, Qin Sang felt a surge of alarm. He immediately sent a warning to Shangguan Lifeng behind him, while simultaneously shifting his body to the left.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The azure flame stream was not only incredibly long but also extremely fast. Even with Qin Sang's best efforts to evade, it was still a struggle. He was almost grazed by the tail end of the stream.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A powerful force, carrying terrifying heat, lightly brushed past, easily shattering the snow curtain.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, placing his Ebony Sword in front of him, taking the brunt of the flame stream's impact. This bought him a brief moment, allowing him to dodge the full force of the attack at the last second.</p><p>The Ebony Sword hummed as it flew back. Qin Sang carefully examined it, confirming that the sword was unharmed.</p><p>The azure flame stream didn't turn back to continue its attack. Instead, it dissipated after flying a certain distance.</p><p>*So this is the barrier's attack method,* Qin Sang realized.</p><p>If it were only this, it wouldn't be difficult to deal with. But things certainly wouldn't remain this simple; this azure flame stream was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Qin Sang's guess was correct. Continuing forward, not long after, another flame stream appeared, this time two at once. Qin Sang was prepared. His figure flickered repeatedly, working in tandem with his Ebony Sword to dodge the flame streams' impact. But then he sensed something strange below him and quickly shifted several meters. A pillar of fire erupted from where he had just been standing, shooting towards the sky.</p><p>From this moment on, the changes within the barrier intensified dramatically. Streams of flames, combined with unpredictable fire pillars, attacked relentlessly, giving Qin Sang no chance to breathe.</p><p>With Qin Sang scouting ahead, Shangguan Lifeng didn't need to be constantly vigilant against the flame streams, making his journey somewhat easier.</p><p>After some distance, Shangguan Lifeng took the lead, allowing Qin Sang to recover.</p><p>As time went on, the changes in the barrier became more complex and frequent, and both of them found it increasingly difficult to cope.</p><p>"Almost there," Qin Sang gasped, estimating they were well past the center of the sea of fire.  He sent a mental message, "Hold here for thirty seconds.  That should be enough."</p><p>Dodging a fire pillar, Shangguan Lifeng frowned. "I still have some strength left. Let's go a bit further to be safe. Please, Daoist Qin, protect me."</p><p>Seeing Shangguan Lifeng's insistence, Qin Sang readily agreed, following closely behind him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after flying only a short distance, a cry of anger came from Shangguan Lifeng, mixed with pain.</p><p>Then, Shangguan Lifeng's figure retreated in a dishevelled state.</p><p>Half of his magical robe was burned, and a long gash ran across his chest and abdomen, clearly the result of a flame stream hitting him when he hadn't been able to dodge in time.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't suspect that Shangguan Lifeng had intentionally injured himself. His injury wasn't minor, but it wasn't critical either. With healing pills and some rest, he would recover.</p><p>As long as he hadn't lost his fighting ability, he couldn't avoid the scouting task.  There was no point in doing so.</p><p>Sure enough, right behind Shangguan Lifeng, dozens of azure flame streams attacked simultaneously, forming a tight net of fire, leaving no gaps.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly understood why.  He'd found it difficult enough facing a dozen or so streams before.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword flew through the air, instantly passing Shangguan Lifeng. The sword array unfolded, and then, with an indomitable force, it collided with the flame streams.</p><p>Sword energy shattered, and the Ebony Sword flew back even faster. Although it was no match for the flames, it momentarily blocked the streams.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng seized the opportunity, channeling his spiritual energy, transforming into a blade of light, and finally escaping the danger.</p><p>"My recklessness has made a fool of me before you, Daoist Qin," Shangguan Lifeng said with a wry smile, clutching his wound, his expression somewhat ashamed.</p><p>He had already taken a healing pill, but the fire poison had entered his body, and expelling it would take some effort.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "With so many flame streams attacking at once, Daoist Shangguan only suffered this minor injury. Your cultivation is truly remarkable. This place is not suitable for a long stay. We should heal after we leave!"</p><p>This time, Shangguan Lifeng didn't object. Together with Qin Sang, they quickly flew towards the edge of the sea of fire.</p><p>Finally, they flew out of the sea of fire. Shangguan Lifeng went to Yu Kong's side, briefly explained the situation, and immediately sat down in meditation to expel the fire poison.</p><p>"Recover quickly!" Yu Kong, knowing this was unavoidable, frowned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he finished speaking, Yan Wu appeared, supporting Wu Chen.</p><p>Yan Wu's face was sheepish.</p><p>Wu Chen's face was ashen, his injuries far more severe than Shangguan Lifeng's.</p>
