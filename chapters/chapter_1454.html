<h1>第一千四百四十六章 Miscalculation</h1><p>What secrets does the Jade Sword hold?</p><p>Is it related to the Pure Sea Sect?</p><p>…</p><p>Although the Jade Sword was obtained in the Buddha Hall, it was held in the hands of a corpse, and may not be a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Jade Sword, these questions flashing quickly through his mind. Remembering the seven-story pagoda of unknown use in his own possession, he wondered if there might be a connection between these two magical artifacts.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no intention of exchanging for the Jade Sword, and instead began to speculate on the other party's intentions.</p><p>There was a fifty percent chance that the old fiend Hunmo was in the bamboo building. He shouldn't lack usable magical artifacts and should place more importance on these kinds of secret-laden treasures, right?</p><p>Could it be that he wants to lure out someone who truly understands the secret?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang leaned leisurely against the back of the chair. Whether the old fiend Hunmo wanted to fish for him or others, he wouldn't recklessly get involved.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the surrounding discussions had clearly quieted down a lot. The Jade Sword really seemed to be unusual.</p><p>But not enough to make them pay the price of a top-grade magical artifact.</p><p>Some people tried bidding a few times, but seeing that the Jade Sword's owner was stubborn and adhered to their opinion (or held firm), they all lost interest.</p><p>In the end, the transaction failed, and Venerable Chongtai shifted the next bamboo building over.</p><p>Inside the bamboo building.</p><p>The old fiend Hunmo reached out and recalled the Jade Sword, holding the Jade Sword in one hand and the Spirit Mushroom Scepter (or Spirit Fungus Scepter) in the other, his expression somewhat puzzled.</p><p>True Essence surged in.</p><p>A faint white light ball appeared inside the Jade Sword.</p><p>The Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara) on the Spirit Mushroom Scepter also lit up, its tightly closed eyes seeming as if they would open at any moment.</p><p>If someone entered the bamboo building at this time, they would discover that the fluctuations emitted by these two magical artifacts were very similar. The Jade Sword's fluctuations were slightly thinner, merely having the appearance of being similar (or merely superficial).</p><p>However, unless the two magical artifacts were placed together, or they had been seen in advance, ordinary people wouldn't realize the difference.</p><p>"The Jade Sword's forging technique is similar to the Spirit Mushroom Scepter. I spent two years carefully refining it. The fluctuations can be faked to be somewhat similar. The Profound Heaven Palace should buy it to investigate. In this way, that news can be verified, and it won't stir up suspicion. Why didn't they make a move? Could it be that I guessed wrong?"</p><p>The old fiend Hunmo muttered to himself.</p><p>Seeming like something hadn't been verified, the old fiend Hunmo looked back and forth at the Spirit Mushroom Scepter in his hand, his eyes not as confident anymore.</p><p>He somewhat regretted that he hadn't bothered to develop his own forces in the past because he didn't want to be disturbed by worldly affairs, otherwise things would be much easier.</p><p>The Myriad Fiend Assembly's background is a joint effort by the strongest forces in the Boundless Sea, mutually restraining each other. He can only promote some unimportant things and cannot control anything.</p><p>After thinking for a long time, the old fiend Hunmo re-hung the Jade Sword up.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the old fiend Hunmo's intentions when he saw the jade token in his hand light up. Triggering the restriction on the spirit token, he was moved to Venerable Chongtai's side.</p><p>The *Seven Teacher Buddha Imprint* and the spirit materials for refining the Gold Submergence Sword had all been obtained. He only used one Nether Thorn and was much more comfortable afterwards.</p><p>"Yuan Yin Water, Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, Yin Nether Soil…"</p><p>Qin Sang unreservedly began to seek these spiritual objects.</p><p>According to the information he had investigated before, Qin Sang believed that Valley Master Mu had most likely not fallen.</p><p>It would be better if Valley Master Mu was here, so he could take the opportunity to restore contact.</p><p>Even if Valley Master Mu died at the hands of the old fiend Hunmo, there was no need to worry. When the old fiend Hunmo entered the Pure Sea Sect, he didn't go straight to the medicine garden, indicating that he hadn't searched the soul, or that the soul search had failed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang received a response.</p><p>The other party had two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits, but was not interested in the three kinds of spiritual medicine in Qin Sang's possession.</p><p>Until the final free exchange, after several rounds of trading, Qin Sang paid two kinds of spiritual medicine and finally exchanged for two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits as he wished, and also obtained the second drop of Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid.</p><p>Each spirit upgrade requires a complete Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, so he can only prioritize satisfying the Fire Jade Centipede and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>As for Yuan Yin Water and Yin Nether Soil, they didn't appear at the trade fair from beginning to end.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his strategy and asked if anyone knew the news of these two kinds of spirits, but still didn't gain anything. It seemed that he had to go to Hundred Flowers Valley again.</p><p>The trade fair was nearing its end.</p><p>Qin Sang gently exhaled a breath, only feeling a sense of exhaustion. Contending with these old guys, testing each other's bottom line, the energy consumed was comparable to a great battle.</p><p>His gaze shifted and fell on the Jade Sword that hadn't been bought yet.</p><p>During the trade fair, he had been paying attention to that bamboo building. The owner of the Jade Sword was stubborn and adhered to their opinion (or held firm), and would never lower the conditions even if no one inquired about it.</p><p>"If it's the old fiend Hunmo, why sell the Jade Sword separately?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered in his heart, unable to guess the other party's intentions.</p><p>Not long after, Venerable Chongtai announced the end of the trade fair. The formation on the lake island changed rapidly. The bamboo buildings shifted position and were completely disrupted. In the end, all the bamboo buildings were hidden in the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang got up and walked out of the room, handed the jade token and spirit stones to the puppet maid, and boarded the light bridge to leave the lake island.</p><p>Before long, escape lights frequently appeared in the sky above Myriad Fiend City, heading in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't go south directly, and changed directions several times to see if he was being followed.</p><p>…</p><p>On the lake island.</p><p>The old fiend Hunmo put away the unsold Jade Sword, his expression extremely gloomy.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes suddenly sharpened, as if he realized something, he hurriedly left the bamboo building, then his figure swayed, and he disappeared out of thin air.</p><p>A corner of Myriad Fiend City, a low and ordinary courtyard.</p><p>The furnishings inside the room were very simple, like an ordinary family among mortals, but at this time there were only two mysterious people wearing black robes, sitting cross-legged in the room, appearing out of place.</p><p>These two people hadn't moved for a long time, and there wasn't a trace of fluctuation on their bodies, like two dead people.</p><p>A black magic eye floated between them. The eye opened and closed, extending several strands of thread that were indistinguishable to the naked eye, extending outside the courtyard, not knowing where they ultimately connected to.</p><p>Suddenly, the two people opened their eyes and looked outside the door at the same time.</p><p>A figure appeared at the door at some unknown time, it was the old fiend Hunmo.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The two hurriedly got up and saluted in unison.</p><p>"The trade fair has ended, and the Profound Heaven Palace hasn't made a move yet?" the old fiend Hunmo asked in a gloomy tone.</p><p>"The trade fair has ended?"</p><p>The two were shocked when they heard this, and immediately realized that something was wrong. They replied anxiously, "The news from the juniors is all normal. The three elders of the Profound Heaven Palace should be waiting for news, and there is no movement yet..."</p><p>Before they could finish speaking, the old fiend Hunmo cursed them as fools, no longer concealing himself, and transformed into a stream of light and rushed towards a distant courtyard.</p><p>The two looked embarrassed and hurriedly followed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The small courtyard had hidden restrictions, and several streams of dark white chilling energy rushed towards the intruder.</p><p>The old fiend Hunmo snorted coldly, heavily pointed out with his Black Bamboo Staff, directly dispersing the chilling energy, then rushed into the main hall. After taking a glance, he flashed into the back hall.</p><p>What he saw were only three ice sculptures with auras identical to the real people!</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The old fiend Hunmo laughed in anger, smashing the ice sculptures with a single blow and glaring fiercely at the two disciples.</p><p>The two were dumbfounded. After receiving the order, they locked onto the residence of the Profound Heaven Palace elders, and had been monitoring them in secret using secret techniques without alarming them.</p>
