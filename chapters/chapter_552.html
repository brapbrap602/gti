<h1>Chapter 545: A Deviant Path</h1><p>Chapter 545: A Deviant Path</p><p>Compared to the immense gains, this minor aftereffect is entirely acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, its light swirling around him, and flew away.</p><p>…</p><p>The Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously concealed himself, penetrating deep into the Earth-Sinking Cave.  He extended his spiritual sense, sensing that the living corpses remained docile in their original positions, and silently breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He waved his hand, releasing the sealing restriction he’d left behind before departing.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Earth-煞 energy surged restlessly.</p><p>A demonic figure slowly emerged from the abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang intently examined the Flying Night Rakshasa; outwardly, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>After many days, a faint sense of unfamiliarity lingered, but the soul imprint remained exceptionally strong. Qin Sang ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to fly before him, and probed its dantian with his spiritual sense.</p><p>The corpse pellet was crisscrossed with cracks and remained extremely dry, yet it was in better condition than when he’d left it, indicating that nurturing within the Earth-Sinking Cave was indeed effective.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, sat cross-legged, and ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to also sit cross-legged before him. Then, he fully extended his spiritual sense, enveloping the corpse pellet, and carefully sensed it.</p><p>At the edge of the煞 energy, darkness shrouded them.</p><p>One person and one corpse sat opposite each other.  The Flying Night Rakshasa's eyes were pitch black, its gaze vacant.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang retracted his spiritual sense and fell into contemplation.</p><p>He was recalling every minute detail of the process of refining the corpse pellet, as well as his understanding of it during his confrontation with Wu You Dao while manipulating it.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang began to grasp some clues.</p><p>He couldn't directly heal the Flying Night Rakshasa. Even unsealing the corpse pellet wouldn't yield better results. However, he could guide the Flying Night Rakshasa to identify the root cause, accelerating its absorption of the Earth-煞 energy, thereby speeding up its recovery.</p><p>Action followed swiftly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, setting up a circle of restrictions with a wave of his hand.  Then, he activated the soul imprint within the Flying Night Rakshasa, forcefully seizing control.</p><p>Within the dantian, the corpse pellet rotated extremely slowly, almost stagnating.</p><p>Countless strands of Earth-煞 energy surrounded the corpse pellet, but only seeped into its fissures at an exceedingly slow rate; the recovery speed was evident.</p><p>At this moment, under Qin Sang’s will, he risked shattering the corpse pellet to forcibly drive it to slowly rotate.</p><p>A ripple effect ensued, causing the煞 energy in the dantian to violently shake.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was grave, even more serious than when he treated himself, fearing a moment of carelessness leading to the destruction of the pellet and the death of the Rakshasa.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the healing process proceeded far more smoothly than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully guided a wisp of Earth-煞 energy, slowly introducing it. Perhaps due to years of nurturing, the corpse pellet remained remarkably stable during this process.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, his eyes showing a hint of fatigue.</p><p>Although it was only auxiliary support, his spiritual sense consumption was considerable. Fortunately, the results were good.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Flying Night Rakshasa turned and leaped into the Earth-煞 energy.  He only needed to visit every few days to assist the Rakshasa with adjustments; there was no need to remain there constantly.</p><p>“At this rate, the injuries should be mostly healed in about three months.  Then, I’ll fill the Shao Yin magnetic bottle with Earth-煞 energy and go to Xuanlu Pass to completely cure it.  A little over a year, before the Ziwei Palace opens… I wonder if there will be any unforeseen changes. It’s best to use the ancient teleportation array to get there early…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, standing up and quietly leaving the Earth-Sinking Cave.</p><p>On his way back to Shao Hua Mountain, Qin Sang also took a tour of the market towns around the mountain gate, investigating recent changes in the situation.</p><p>The Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing League, though they haven't withdrawn their troops from the Turbulent Island waters, haven't engaged in large-scale battles for over two months. The atmosphere in Xiao Han Domain is considerably relaxed, almost returning to what it was before the great war.</p><p>Major market towns have resumed normal operations, and cultivators who had been hiding away can finally move freely, creating a scene of prosperity.</p><p>Qin Sang visited several trading houses and made extensive purchases.</p><p>Though Jiu Pao Dao Ren was now a fugitive, a lean camel is still larger than a horse. After releasing the restrictions on the iron finger ring, Qin Sang obtained Jiu Pao Dao Ren's belongings, leaving him quite wealthy. Besides abundant healing pills, he bought various medicinal herbs and magical artifacts for diverse situations.</p><p>Of course, the four high-grade spirit stones remained untouched.</p><p>The iron finger ring's space was large enough, so there was no fear of it filling up.</p><p>After spending a whole day and placing several down payments, Qin Sang flew contentedly towards Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>The Jianmen Pass stood wide open.</p><p>Peach blossoms bloomed in profusion, painting the hillsides in vibrant hues. Many young female disciples frolicked amongst the flowers, a scene that reminded Qin Sang of her own arrival at the sect all those years ago.</p><p>The scenery remained unchanged, but many familiar faces were gone.</p><p>Senior Brother Wen, his hopes of forming a Golden Core dashed, was nearing the end of his life and had returned to his hometown to spend his remaining years.</p><p>Zhuang Yan was busy cultivating with his partner.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou was in secluded cultivation and unavailable.</p><p>The other old friends were likely absent from the sect as well.</p><p>Qin Sang, after considering her options, found no one she wished to see.  She shook her head and flew towards the cave dwelling that Zhuang Yan had lent her.</p><p>There was a custom at Shao Hua Mountain: once a disciple formed their Golden Core, they could revise their jade registry, much like they did after establishing their Foundation. The improved status, spiritual stones, and other benefits were self-evident.</p><p>Even more appealing was the sect's offer to host a Golden Core Ceremony and fund the construction of a lavish cave dwelling—anywhere the disciple chose, within or outside the sect's grounds.</p><p>Of course, increased responsibility came with the privilege.</p><p>Qin Sang cared little for fame or the ceremony itself, but the cave dwelling was very tempting.  Her current cave, though rich in spiritual energy, paled in comparison to a true Golden Core dwelling.</p><p>However, she wasn't sure if her current, external Golden Core would be accepted by the sect.</p><p>She decided to wait. There was no rush.  She would inform the sect after returning from Ziwei Palace and forming a true Golden Core.  It was best to keep her possession of an external Golden Core at this stage a secret.  She decided to remain inconspicuous.</p><p>Once settled in the cave, Qin Sang, free from the pressure of cultivation and the urgency of forming a Golden Core, was finally able to focus on other pursuits.</p><p>She explored various skills of the immortal arts, ultimately focusing on two main areas.</p><p>The first was the Way of Spirit Arrays and Restrictions.  These were closely related, and Qin Sang already possessed considerable skill in Restrictions. She also had obtained a copy of "The Tai Xuan Array Fragments" from a disciple of the Yuan Shen Gate, which she used to further her understanding.</p><p>The second was the Way of Beast Taming.  She had acquired a Golden Core cultivation manual on beast taming from the remains of the Old Man of Di Que, and while she had often consulted it while raising her Blood-winged Ghost Head Bees, she had never truly delved into it.  Now, she could finally explore it thoroughly.</p><p>After forming her Golden Core, her cultivation speed was no longer a hindrance, making it practical to learn additional skills and enhance her overall strength.</p><p>Following this decision, Qin Sang lived a very regular life. Every few days, she would visit the Di Chen Cave, otherwise remaining secluded in her own cave dwelling, minimizing contact with others.</p>
