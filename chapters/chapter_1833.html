<h1>Chapter 1824: The Sun and Moon Divine Deer</h1><p>The palace was vast.</p><p>Inside, the hall was empty, containing nothing else.</p><p>Deep within the palace, there was only a hexagonal stone platform, resembling a well platform.  Its previous use was unknown. The Five Elements Crown floated above it.</p><p>Anyone familiar with the Five Elements Crown would instantly recognize the intense radiance as the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light!</p><p>At that moment, the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light struck like an arrow, instantly targeting its victim.</p><p>The Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light:  "Banishing" in its proper order, "Annihilating" in reverse.</p><p>The reversed Five Elements Divine Light targeted Xia Hou.</p><p>Xia Hou, still unsteady on his feet, felt his vision filled with multicolored light, an overwhelming sense of danger assaulting his senses.</p><p>He had intentionally lagged behind the Azure Fox Saint King, ensuring the palace interior was safe before entering. Unexpectedly, the reversed Five Elements Divine Light bypassed the Saint King, striking him directly.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King claimed this treasure was not a naturally formed spiritual treasure.  She didn't understand why it had developed a spirit, possibly due to the unique environment of the sacrificial altar, resulting in an incomplete, flawed spirit, unable to fully evolve.</p><p>Earlier, Xia Hou had indeed sensed a consciousness within the crown, but it was extremely chaotic, matching the Saint King's description. This chaotic state was impossible to fake.</p><p>Even when the reversed Five Elements Divine Light arrived, that consciousness remained chaotic; the Five Elements Crown's attack came without warning.</p><p>Xia Hou's expression changed drastically.  He instinctively retreated, but it was too late.  Black and white energy surged from the top of his head, a black and white vortex forming instantly, only to suddenly freeze.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King, beside him, was holding a silver circlet, her palm open, facing Xia Hou.</p><p>The silver circlet was the light ring that had recently proven its effectiveness in battle.</p><p>A silver ray shot towards Xia Hou, conjuring a massive light ring out of thin air, perfectly encasing the black and white vortex the moment it formed.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's timing was impeccable!</p><p>The light ring retracted, confining the vortex in place. The distinct black and white within the vortex visibly weakened.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Xia Hou might not have feared it, but facing an immediate life-threatening crisis, he had no time to fight back.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A golden light shot from Xia Hou's chest.</p><p>The golden light was dazzling, revealing a shield-like bone armor within.</p><p>The bone armor was entirely golden, shaped like a turtle shell but far thinner, almost translucent; one could see through it.</p><p>Xia Hou had never used this treasure when fighting Hong Yuzi, secretly keeping it in reserve. He hadn't anticipated such a sudden attack, so deploying it now felt rushed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The bone armor expanded like a large umbrella, only to be struck by the reversed Five Elements Divine Light. Multicolored light instantly engulfed the golden light.</p><p>A series of cracking sounds echoed as the bone armor vibrated, spiderweb cracks appearing across its surface.</p><p>Multicolored light pierced through the cracks, converging into a single beam which, to Xia Hou's horror, hurtled towards him.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King calmly watched Xia Hou. Witnessing the terrifying power of the reversed Five Elements Divine Light, her eyes widened slightly.</p><p>When she initially discovered the Five Elements Crown here, she had almost triggered the attack.</p><p>Recalling it, the Azure Fox Saint King still felt a chill down her spine.  If she hadn't manipulated the Five Elements Crown in the Netherworld for many years, gaining intimate familiarity and forewarning, she would have perished then and there.</p><p>Having been out of their control for decades, their restrictions placed upon the Five Elements Crown had long since expired.</p><p>Aware of the danger, she hadn't dared to approach, retreating instead, leading to today's plan.</p><p>Using her understanding of the Five Elements Crown, she subtly concealed her energy fluctuations. Xia Hou, however, lacked this knowledge and, upon entering the palace, triggered the reversed Five Elements Divine Light, becoming the Azure Fox Saint King's unwitting pawn.</p><p>Her gaze drifted to the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Using Xia Hou to test the Five Elements Crown confirmed some of her suspicions.</p><p>This divine light wasn't controlled by the spirit, or rather, it wasn't a conscious attack by the spirit.</p><p>After arriving in this realm, there were no Heavenly Dao demonic sounds, but demonic thoughts had already taken root, difficult to eliminate. The spirit hadn't yet emerged from its madness and chaos, only instinctively continuing to devour demonic souls.</p><p>For a hundred years, the spirit had gradually devoured demonic souls, and with each devoured soul, its power increased exponentially.</p><p>This reversed Five Elements Divine Light was far stronger than when they had controlled it.</p><p>If the spirit had absorbed the demonic soul and regained consciousness, the Qinghu Saint King believed she couldn't subdue it, let alone forcefully seize it.  She might even have to change her plan and first cooperate with Xia Hou to suppress the spirit.</p><p>It now seems the spirit hadn't awakened. Perhaps a spark of instinctual awareness remained, leaving behind this protective light to attack anyone who approached.  Years of accumulating power had made it incredibly potent.</p><p>Xia Hou triggered the Reverse Five Elements Light, restoring the Five Elements Crown to normal. The spirit remained inert, seemingly only attacking if provoked.</p><p>However, from the Qinghu Saint King's understanding of the spirit, anyone attempting to control this treasure would first face a backlash. Even taking the Five Elements Crown wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Of course, there was something else to do before taking the crown.</p><p>She brought Xia Hou in, for more than just a pawn.</p><p>Xia Hou was her carefully chosen target!</p><p>…</p><p>‘噗!’</p><p>妖 blood gushed forth.</p><p>Xia Hou shuddered violently, as if struck by a heavy blow, flying backward.  A gaping wound was visible on his chest.</p><p>The Reverse Five Elements Light pierced his bone armor, slamming into him.</p><p>Xia Hou was flung outside the hall, spitting blood.  A destructive force spread through his body from the wound.</p><p>To make matters worse, two black dragons burst from the palace gates, spewing black flames that engulfed him.</p><p>Simultaneously, Xia Hou sensed a malicious wind from the side.  He glimpsed the murderous intent in the Qinghu Saint King’s eyes.</p><p>“Bitch! You truly had ulterior motives!”</p><p>Xia Hou roared in furious rage.</p><p>A sneer played on the Qinghu Saint King's lips.  Her fox tail swished, and three tails detached, transforming into three beams of light that shot toward Xia Hou.</p><p>First, the sealing array trapped Hong Yuzi, forcing out his lifeblood.</p><p>Then, he fought two black dragons outside the hall, depleting his strength.</p><p>Finally, he was critically wounded by the Reverse Five Elements Light.</p><p>It was all part of her plan.  Xia Hou’s strength had been systematically weakened, creating a golden opportunity!</p><p>With a roar, Xia Hou’s eyes filled with blood, unleashing immense killing intent.  His blood surged like thunder, his body suddenly swelling as he revealed his true form.</p><p>Xia Hou was a cultivated deer spirit. His true form was vastly different from the previously seen black and white deer shadow; his body was pure white, majestic and imposing, his fur without a single blemish, except for the blood staining his chest wound.</p><p>Seeing this, the Qinghu Saint King's brow furrowed slightly.  She felt a strange sense of foreboding, but there was no turning back!</p><p>Three fox-tail manifestations, along with her true form, surrounded Xia Hou.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King’s cultivation had improved drastically, and she had planned this for a long time.  Her full-powered use of this technique was far beyond what it had been in the past.</p><p>Summoning her manifestations, she spat out a green jade bead, which shattered into a cloud of green mist.</p><p>The mist spread, enveloping the three manifestations and Xia Hou.</p><p>The mist twisted, strange lines and runes appearing within, connecting her to the three manifestations.</p><p>A tremendous pressure erupted from the mist, slamming into Xia Hou.</p><p>The two black dragons remained focused on Xia Hou, acting as the Qinghu Saint King's accomplices.</p><p>Dragon flames raged.</p><p>Xia Hou quickly became battered and bruised, his fur singed, his wounds grievous. His counterattacks weakened, his roars growing weaker and more desperate.</p><p>Suddenly, the Qinghu Saint King's eyes shone with a strange light.  The moment their eyes met, she unleashed a sudden attack.</p><p>Xia Hou was caught off guard, his body stiffening, his gaze unfocused as he fell into a boundless illusion, forgetting even to resist.</p><p>A rare look of excitement flashed in the Qinghu Saint King's eyes.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's self-destruction was inconsequential!</p><p>Controlling Xia Hou and making him a subservient spirit would greatly increase her power and facilitate future actions, freeing her from relying on any demon king.</p><p>She, too, had been a king, and would never willingly submit to anyone!</p><p>In fact, she enjoyed this world, where demons and humans clashed; it offered her great opportunities.</p><p>However, even if she eventually joined the Gui Fang nation, it would only be after she reached the Transcendence stage.</p><p>The situation seemed to be going perfectly.</p><p>Then Xia Hou suddenly twisted his stiff neck, his eyes clearing from their vacant state.</p><p>His anger was gone, replaced by mocking laughter.  “Bitch! Do you know why our clan is called the Sun and Moon Divine Deer?”</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's breath hitched, a flush rising on her alluring face. Her mesmerizing eyes intensified, but it was to no avail.</p><p>Xiahou's deer body began to change from white fur to black, starting from one side.</p><p>The Sun and Moon Sacred Deer is gifted, possessing two forms from birth.  This is different from having two souls within one body. Both forms are the original entity, with equal power and abilities, and a single spirit; there is no internal conflict or division.</p><p>As a young deer, it was white during the day and black at night; besides the change in appearance, there was nothing special.</p><p>Cultivating this ability is extremely difficult, but upon mastery, the deer can switch between forms at will.  Furthermore, during the transformation, not only is expended energy restored, but injuries sustained in the other form are also suppressed, and most detrimental status effects are dispelled.  The Green Fox Saint King's enchantment falls into this category!</p><p>In essence, the Sun and Moon Sacred Deer possesses nearly double the strength!</p><p>Although the two forms cannot appear simultaneously, and strength cannot be stacked, how many could withstand the successive attacks of two late-stage Nascent Soul demon marquises?  Imagine facing an imminent death, only to have your enemy's power suddenly restored – what a disheartening feeling.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King's expression changed drastically.  She stared intently at Xiahou.  "Worthy of being the second demon marquis under the Demon King's command, I underestimated you! No wonder you dared to come alone."</p><p>"Had I not come alone, would you have dared to bring me to your treasure vault?" Xiahou sneered, killing intent filling the air.</p><p>The white deer gradually transformed into a black deer!  During the transformation, the wounds healed visibly, Xiahou's aura surged, and his weakened state vanished, his power fully restored.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King took a deep breath.  She was always decisive, and seeing the situation was turning unfavorable, she immediately stopped the enchantment and made a swift hand gesture.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Three spirit bodies shattered, their fragments merging with the green mist, thickening it to the point of solidity.  A dense fog enveloped Xiahou and the two black dragons, and a massive green ring appeared at the fog's edge.</p><p>Xiahou's strength was recovering, but suppressing the two black dragons and breaking the seal could not be done instantly.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King lightly tapped her foot and retreated, but instead of fleeing, she returned to the main hall.</p><p>Xiahou, noticing this, let out a disdainful snort.  Since this demon fox was so greedy and hadn't fled, she wouldn't mind dealing with her as well. As for the crown, she would have it.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Xiahou roared, its white fur almost entirely gone.  The black fur gleamed, appearing even more majestic than its white form.  Its dark antlers pierced upward, and dense black energy split into two streams, charging towards the entangled black dragons.</p><p>Upon contact, the two streams exploded, causing the black dragons to recoil and collide.  The black energy, however, coalesced into a long rope, tightly binding the dragons.</p><p>The black dragons thrashed, causing the black energy rope to loosen with cracking sounds.</p><p>Xiahou, ignoring this, leaped, its antler tip like a sharp sword, stabbing towards one of the spirit bodies.</p><p>At that moment, Xiahou saw the scene inside the hall and his pupils constricted.</p><p>Within the palace, the void rippled.  Faint green light flickered, and where the ripples spread, numerous shadowy figures appeared.</p><p>The figures soon solidified – mostly demonic beasts, with a few humanoids.  Although these beasts were no match for Hong Yuzi's elite soldiers, they were well-organized, obviously trained.</p><p>These demon soldiers surrounded an altar, led by a woman in a green dress with a delicate appearance.  This woman's cultivation was clearly at the early Cave Xuan stage – a demon marquis!</p><p>"The Army Altar!"</p><p>The relaxed expression on Xiahou's face vanished.  This demon fox had destroyed the altar and stolen the soldiers – a rebel!  An altar capable of containing early Cave Xuan stage demon soldiers; the one who destroyed it must be a Cave Xuan cultivator.</p><p>The woman in green led her troops, forming an array within the palace facing the Five Elements Crown.  She waved a magic banner repeatedly, and the demon soldiers' formation shifted with precision, various talisman images flashing above their heads.  Streams of light shot from the array toward the well platform.  As they neared the Five Elements Crown, the light softened, weaving a fine net to carefully encase the crown, preventing backlash from its spirit.</p><p>The net was almost complete.  The demon soldiers were clearly not newly summoned.  While attacking Xiahou, the Green Fox Saint King had already summoned the altar and concealed the demon soldiers' presence to quietly take the treasure.  Taking the treasure without triggering the Five Elements Crown's spirit was crucial, or it would reveal their intentions.</p><p>This was not easy.  Sweat beaded on the green-clad woman's forehead.  With a sharp cry, the demon army's momentum surged, quickly closing the final gap in the net, pulling it back to retrieve the crown.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King retreated towards the array, her eyes showing regret.  This plan was supposed to achieve three goals at once:  capture the puppet, subdue Xiahou, and obtain the Five Elements Crown.  Unfortunately, she had miscalculated Mo Xingdao and Xiahou, leading to two failures.</p><p>However, the Green Fox Saint King never forgot her true goal, never getting carried away, even when things were going well.  As long as she got the Five Elements Crown, her previous failures meant nothing. With her intelligence, she would eventually succeed.  Unfortunately, she had miscalculated one more person – someone she thought she would never see again!</p><p>A gale suddenly swept into the palace. Four venomous snakes lunged at the woman in green.  Within the freezing wind, a black line of fire appeared. (End)</p>
