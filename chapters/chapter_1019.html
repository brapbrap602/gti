<h1>Chapter 1111: The Three Great Merchant Alliances</h1><p>After waiting a while longer, Ning Wu Hui finally arrived.</p><p>He entered the Jade Plaza with several Heavenly Dao Sect disciples. Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, he glanced at him impassively and walked towards where the righteous cultivators were gathered.</p><p>Seeing Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang's expression relaxed.</p><p>He strained his ears, listening to the discussions of the cultivators around him. The cultivators in the plaza were all top experts, and Qin Sang did indeed hear quite a few secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that not all cultivators wanted to enter the inner hall.</p><p>There were many who remained in the outer hall, exploring its hidden realms.</p><p>However, staying in the outer hall at this time was not a good idea.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed upon arrival that due to the instability of the immortal formations and the chaotic spiritual energy, the entire outer hall was in disarray. The beasts had gone berserk, and the restrictions and ancient formations were affected, making it far more dangerous than before.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was silently observing the situation, the corpse puppet pouch at his waist suddenly vibrated slightly. Qin Sang's expression shifted subtly as his divine sense probed into the pouch.</p><p>"Be careful, Mou Lao Mo is here!"</p><p>Bai warned.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "He's in the plaza too?"</p><p>"Yes! I just tried to probe secretly with the Fire Curse Seed, and Mou Lao Mo's location is very close. He must be among these people," Bai said gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, his gaze sweeping quickly over all the cultivators in the plaza, focusing on the Nascent Soul Patriarchs.</p><p>In order to understand his opponent, he had specifically investigated Mou Lao Mo's background.</p><p>Among these people, none of them looked like Mou Lao Mo.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo, being hunted by everyone, would definitely disguise himself, but he dared to enter the plaza openly under the noses of the Demon Lord and Ling Zhu Zi. This was simply too audacious.</p><p>"Can you find the real person?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, a cold glint flashing within them.</p><p>"Not easy."</p><p>Bai hesitated for a moment. "There are too many Nascent Soul cultivators here, I dare not act rashly. Moreover, the approximate location of Mou Lao Mo that I sensed just now is quite intriguing..."</p><p>Following Bai's guidance, Qin Sang's gaze landed on the area where the demonic cultivators were gathered, near the Demon Lord.</p><p>"You're saying the Demon Lord might be harboring Mou Lao Mo..."</p><p>Bai hummed in agreement. "During the siege of Skywind Island, only Grand Cultivators Demon Lord and Ling Zhu Zi were present. The Demon Lord only needed to make a slight maneuver to create an opportunity for Mou Lao Mo to escape. With Mou Lao Mo's strength, it would also be worth the Demon Lord's risk to recruit him.  It's just unknown whether Ling Zhu Zi noticed anything at the time."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, not surprised by this at all.</p><p>With no news of Mou Lao Mo's death, Qin Sang had his suspicions.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo had subdued the Winter Nether Cold Flame, and his strength surpassed that of cultivators at the same level. If the Demon Lord could recruit him as a powerful aide, he would definitely agree readily.</p><p>Compared to this, what were the lives of a few Core Formation cultivators?</p><p>"Perhaps he knew, perhaps he didn't!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, "Ling Zhu Zi's actions were meant to warn other Nascent Soul cultivators not to act recklessly in the Seven Kills Palace. With Skywind Island destroyed and Mou Lao Mo forced into hiding, his goal has been achieved. Unless Ling Zhu Zi intends to directly confront the Demon Lord, even if he did notice something, he would turn a blind eye. After all, the main conflict in the current cultivation world is not the divide between righteous and demonic, but the war between races."</p><p>Externally, there were the Sea Demons, the Witch Tribe, and the strength of the righteous and demonic paths were comparable. Those great powers certainly didn't want internal strife within the human race.</p><p>Back in the Small Cold Realm, Red Hair Ancestor and Gloomy Devil Monarch also advanced and retreated together.</p><p>Bai said with relief, "It's good that you understand.  Borrowing a knife to kill is unlikely to work, we cannot act rashly. If you want revenge, you can only rely on yourself."</p><p>"I don't know how long I'll have to wait. It seems I can only swallow this resentment."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and put aside his distracting thoughts.</p><p>Right now, the most important thing was to find the ancient teleportation formation, return to the Small Cold Realm to cultivate the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, and strive for Nascent Soul. He couldn't lose his reason due to hatred.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang and Bai were communicating secretly, he suddenly smelled a floral fragrance.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, stunned.</p><p>A woman had appeared at the edge of the plaza, as if walking out of a sea of flowers. Her figure was graceful, her appearance extremely beautiful, and every movement exuded a breathtaking charm.</p><p>As soon as this woman appeared, she attracted the attention of all the cultivators, causing bursts of amazement.</p><p>Even Ling Zhu Zi and the Demon Lord were startled and looked over.</p><p>"So it's Fellow Daoist Qing Yun. Fellow Daoists Ji and Bai Li should be arriving soon as well, right?"</p><p>Ling Zhu Zi's eyes flickered as he asked.</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the plaza erupted in an uproar.</p><p>Qin Sang also revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>The leader of one of the three great merchant alliances, the Westernå¹½Alliance, was known as Qing Yun.  Rumor had it she was a stunningly beautiful female cultivator, and seeing her today confirmed that the rumors were true.</p><p>The other two people mentioned by Ling Zhu Zi were the leaders of the Northern Star Alliance and the Eastern Apex Alliance.</p><p>More and more human experts were arriving.</p><p>The leaders of the righteous and demonic paths, and the leaders of the three great merchant alliances, almost represented the largest factions of the human race, and they were now gathered in the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>Alliance Leader Qing Yun walked gracefully.</p><p>Her destination was neither the righteous nor the demonic side, but the neutral faction.</p><p>Core Formation cultivators along the way moved aside, while Nascent Soul Patriarchs greeted her with smiles. The three great merchant alliances were loose confederations, not sects, but they had intricate connections with various powers.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully observed the expressions of Ling Zhu Zi and the Demon Lord, but he couldn't discern anything.</p><p>"I came alone. I'm not sure when Fellow Daoists Ji and Bai Li will arrive."</p><p>Qing Yun's expression remained calm as she walked to the front of the Seven Kills Palace and stopped.</p><p>Ling Zhu Zi chuckled, clearly disbelieving her.</p><p>The Demon Lord sneered. "Everyone knows that the three great merchant alliances are closely connected. The three of you rarely leave your caves and enter secret realms alone. Those who don't know better might think someone means you harm."</p><p>The Demon Lord's tone was somewhat hostile.</p><p>Qing Yun's expression remained unchanged, and she replied neither humbly nor arrogantly, "The three of us have low cultivation and bear the heavy responsibilities of the merchant alliances, so naturally, we must be extremely cautious in our actions. We established the merchant alliances to better support cultivation, yet some people project imagined conspiracies onto us. I have to be on guard; if I lose my life, what meaning would anything else have?"</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of something breaking through the air came from the distance. Everyone felt it and looked up. They saw two streaks of light approaching rapidly, revealing two figures.</p><p>One was a dignified red-faced elder, the other resembled a refined scholar.</p><p>The two landed in the plaza and swept their gazes across the crowd.</p><p>The red-faced elder laughed heartily and strode forward, his voice booming like a bell.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists have all arrived. Ji and Fellow Daoist Bai Li are a step late. I hope we haven't missed anything important!"</p><p>The refined scholar followed, greeting Ling Zhu Zi and the Demon Lord.  When he looked at Qing Yun, he saw her expressionless face and that she didn't acknowledge him.  He couldn't help but frown slightly and sigh inwardly.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji! Fellow Daoist Bai Li!"</p><p>Ling Zhu Zi cupped his hands in return. "The Seven Kills Palace trial realm has not yet opened.  You two have arrived just in time."</p>
