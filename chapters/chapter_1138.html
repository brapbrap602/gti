<h1>Chapter 1130: Star Platform</h1><p>As Qin Sang approached the beam of light, Qing Jun called him forward. "You've been to the Heaven-Pointing Peak before, so you should know what lies within. Once inside, focus on cultivating the secret techniques. Do not act recklessly..."</p><p>Qing Jun's hands moved swiftly, forming a series of seals as he implanted layers of restrictions into Qin Sang's body. Qin Sang offered no resistance. As the restrictions took hold, he felt his cultivation being suppressed to the Foundation Establishment level.</p><p>Once the restrictions were in place, Qing Jun paused. Jiu Gu and the demonic cultivator, still uneasy, also took action, adding layer upon layer of seals to Qin Sang's body. Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression shifted. His storage pouch, spirit beast pouch, and the Thousand Jun Ring—all his treasures—had been sealed by Jiu Gu and the demonic cultivator.</p><p>"Not a single Star Essence Stone is to leave the Heaven-Pointing Peak! Once you return, I will personally remove these seals," Jiu Gu warned, his voice heavy with authority. His eyes, hardened by years of battle, seemed to radiate a bloodthirsty aura.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his senior sister. It was clear that this was a precaution against the Yuan Shen Sect and Qing Jun. The Yuan Shen Sect was renowned for its mastery of formations, and its treasures had fallen into Qing Jun's hands. There was no doubt that Qing Jun intended to use the Star Essence Stones to activate ancient formations. Otherwise, Leng Yuntian wouldn't have gone to such lengths to seize the Immortal Mansion and send people to steal the stones from the Heaven-Pointing Peak.</p><p>If Qing Jun offered the ancient formations to the Two Realms Alliance to resist the Sin Abyss, they would welcome it. But if Qing Jun hoarded the Star Essence Stones for himself, it would not sit well with the other factions.</p><p>"Go," Qing Jun said indifferently.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently and turned toward the entrance. A vortex and storm appeared on the water's surface. Without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged into the vortex. The storm at the entrance of the Heaven-Pointing Peak, which would have been a challenge for most, posed no threat to Qin Sang's formidable physique. He broke free of the suction force with ease.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang entered the Heaven-Pointing Peak. The scenery within was as breathtaking as ever. The ancient restrictions had formed radiant auras that merged with the Star Essence Stones, filling the space with abundant Star Essence energy. The energy was especially dense at the peak of the mountain.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang did not head for the peak. Instead, he descended toward the base. Before heading to Cangheng Island, Qin Sang and Qing Jun had anticipated this and visited the Immortal Mansion in advance. Qin Sang had left a Star Spirit Net and the Star Platform there.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net was used to capture Star Essence Stones. Qing Jun had helped Qin Sang, but he also had his own agenda—to secretly acquire the stones.</p><p>The Star Platform was a crescent-shaped stone platform Qin Sang had seized from a Wu Clan cultivator in the Lan Dou Sect. It had been instrumental in helping him break through to the third layer of the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique by channeling Star Essence into his body. This treasure could gather Star Essence and might still be of use to him.</p><p>With his powerful physique, Qin Sang didn't need to expend any true essence. He moved unimpeded to the location of the teleportation formation, which Qing Jun had tampered with to conceal it. Qin Sang easily activated the formation, suppressed his cultivation to the Qi Refining level, and teleported to the Immortal Mansion to retrieve his treasures.</p><p>Then, while collecting Star Essence Stones in large quantities, he made his way toward the peak.</p><p>"The Star Essence energy here is incredibly dense!" Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. At this rate, he wouldn't even need to reach the peak to meet the requirements for Star Essence infusion.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang stopped and assessed his surroundings. "This spot will do," he murmured.</p><p>After circling the Heaven-Pointing Peak, he found a clearing free of restrictions. He took out the Star Platform, sat down cross-legged, and began reciting the incantations of his cultivation technique. As he activated the secret art, the ambient Star Essence energy was drawn toward him, converging around his body.</p><p>Ethereal and profound energy flowed into him, mingled with an inscrutable, dark Star Malice. As he had anticipated, the Star Essence energy within the Heaven-Pointing Peak also contained this sinister Star Malice, no different from the outside world. It could be used for Star Essence infusion.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionless as the Star Essence energy flowed into him like a river, aided by the Star Platform. Once inside his body, however, it surged like a raging tide, crashing violently against his meridians and organs. Thunderous roars echoed within him with each impact.</p><p>His skin and flesh trembled slightly as they were tempered by the Star Essence. Having undergone Star Essence infusion before, Qin Sang was prepared for the pain. He endured it with sheer willpower.</p><p>The Star Essence energy around him grew denser, bathing him in a radiant glow. The rate at which the energy gathered accelerated until it finally met the requirements of his technique.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he abruptly changed his hand seals.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A torrent of Star Essence energy surged into his body, wreaking havoc like a storm. His flesh tore, and his bones felt as though they were being ground to dust by the overwhelming force. Qin Sang grunted, his face flushed red, his teeth clenched.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, he continued to drive the technique. Blood seeped from his pores as new impurities were expelled. The Star Essence baptism brought excruciating pain but also profound transformation.</p><p>His bones felt as though they had been shattered, his marrow cleansed by the Star Essence. His flesh seemed to have been replaced multiple times over. Qin Sang wondered if all body-refining cultivators endured such agony or if it was unique to his demonic technique.</p><p>Despite the waves of pain, Qin Sang's resolve never wavered. His body was destroyed and rebuilt repeatedly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Star Essence continued to pour in. Qin Sang's body trembled violently.</p><p>"Why haven't I broken through yet?" he screamed inwardly. The amount of Star Essence he had drawn far exceeded the limit described in the technique. He was nearing his limit, yet there was no sign of a breakthrough.</p><p>He ignored the pain and visualized the Azure Phoenix, but he couldn't grasp the most crucial element—the Heavenly Demon Manifestation!</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel that his body had grown stronger, reaching the peak of the third layer and inching closer to the fourth. Yet, the fourth layer seemed like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>With a roar, the Star Essence scattered.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Qin Sang's hand slammed onto the Star Platform as blood oozed from the cracks in his skin. His hair was disheveled, his body covered in wounds, but he paid no attention to his injuries.</p><p>The breakthrough had failed!</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed. Although he had gained some benefits from the Star Essence infusion, he still couldn't manifest the Heavenly Demon Manifestation and break through to the fourth layer.</p><p>"Was it because I only visualized the puppet? Was the Azure Phoenix's true essence insufficient?" Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>He had harbored this concern since the beginning of his cultivation, and now it had become a stumbling block. After resting, he tried several more times, but the bottleneck remained unyielding.</p><p>"After all, this is a foreign technique," Qin Sang sighed. "For a cultivator to form a Nascent Soul is a great transformation that requires enduring tribulations. The fourth layer of the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* is surely more than just a difference in physical strength—it involves the Heavenly Demon Manifestation. I can't force it. If visualizing the puppet isn't enough, would seeing the true Azure Phoenix's phantom suffice?"</p><p>Qin Sang was worried. If this path led nowhere, he might not be able to continue cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Sang was about to get up and put away the Star Platform when he noticed something unexpected. The Star Platform beneath him had undergone a surprising change while he was focused on his breakthrough—it was now absorbing Star Essence energy on its own!</p>
