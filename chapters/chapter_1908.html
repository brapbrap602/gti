Chapter 1899: A Finger Cracks the Heavens, Bearing a Realm into the Grand Firmament!


The azure-robed child reverted to its true form, its sword body shattered.
Qin Sang caught the fragments, his arm trembling slightly.
The power of the Inner Lion Seal was fading, and he, struggling to maintain it, grew increasingly weak.
The fragments couldn't reassemble themselves as before, and he couldn't sense the sword spirit's aura.  Qin Sang couldn't help but feel alarmed.
The sword spirit's condition was clearly even worse.
“Can the Thunder Ancestor conceal the aura of the Earth-Slaying Sword?”
Qin Sang contemplated his own Altar, lost in thought.
Within the Altar, the Thunder Ancestor remained a mere phantom, seemingly without much divine power.
Just then, golden light bathed the sky, washing away the torrential blood rain, restoring the realm to a clear and bright state.
Celestial Master Zhang returned in his Imperial Chariot, his gaze falling upon Qin Sang, his eyes filled with majesty.
Qin Sang's heart trembled with awe, and he was about to bow in respect.
Celestial Master Zhang’s deep voice echoed.
“Disciple Zhang Haichan, holding the Dao Canon Master Seal, hereby conveys the Celestial Master's decree, issued from the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace… In recognition of your reopening of the Divine Court, your resistance against demonic hordes, your virtuous conduct, and your merits that will last for millennia!  You are hereby conferred the title of Third Rank Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Ascendant Immortal, Divine Firmament Jade Pivot Envoy, and bestowed with the Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court!”
The Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court was the seal of the Five Thunders Court Lord.
Unlike the Heavenly Hub Court and the North Star Demon-Quelling Court, the Five Thunders Court was one of the inner courts of the Thunder Jade Palace, one of the Thunder Departments.
Currently, the chief officials of the Heavenly Hub Court and the North Star Demon-Quelling Court were mostly held by Fourth Rank True Persons, due to the decline of the Daoist sect, with only two True Monarchs at the highest cultivation level, and the rest inferior.
The Five Thunders Court Lord, during the Daoist sect's golden age, held immense power and prestige. Yet, this title was now conferred upon Qin Sang, an outsider.
Moreover, Qin Sang, with his early Void Refining cultivation, was granted the title of a Third Rank Celestial Official, in charge of the Five Thunders Court!
However, Qin Sang's authority was nominal.
The Thunder Jade Palace wouldn't obey his commands, and the Dao Court, still in ruins, wouldn't allocate him a single soldier.
Despite being just a title, with this decree, Qin Sang could act under the guise of a Dao Court Celestial Official while traversing the Grand Firmament, and no one would dare question his identity.
As Celestial Master Zhang spoke, fiery red script materialized, characters a zhang square, eight-cornered and radiating light, covering the heavens, shimmering with golden radiance, illuminating the vast expanse.
The golden light swirled, and the golden decree transformed into a scroll, flying towards Qin Sang.
Along with the golden decree came a square seal.
Qin Sang, sensing something, summoned his Altar.
‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’
A golden light and a lightning bolt arrived simultaneously, both plunging into the Altar, manifesting the golden decree and the Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court.
“Another fragmented seal…”
Qin Sang grumbled inwardly.  Most of the Daoist treasures he had encountered over the years were incomplete, including the Heavenly Patrolling Chariot.
The Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court, its inscription written in thunder runes, was wreathed in electric light.  Unfortunately, the seal itself was crisscrossed with cracks, and its knob was incomplete.
However, it was better than the Heavenly Patrolling Chariot; the fragmented seal still held power.
Just then, a clap of thunder erupted within the Altar. The Thunder Ancestor's divine intent shot forth lightning, causing the Altar to tremble violently.
Qin Sang realized with a start that the Thunder Ancestor's divine intent was faintly manifesting as a phantom of a deity wreathed in lightning. He was about to gain an extraordinary Altar Guardian, but this guardian was clearly exceeding the Altar's limits, showing signs of losing control!
He now understood that someone had previously placed a barrier between him and the Thunder Ancestor, preventing the Thunder Ancestor from suddenly becoming an Altar Guardian. Its power was too strong; he couldn't adapt, causing the Altar to destabilize.  Worse, it could cause the Altar to explode.
Now, he had to stabilize the Altar himself and accommodate the Thunder Ancestor for it to truly become his Altar Guardian, to conceal the aura of the Earth-Slaying Sword!
This would likely not be accomplished overnight.
During this period, there was still a chance of being discovered. It was a critical moment for the Daoist sect's return to the Grand Firmament, bound to attract immense attention.  The Daoist sect didn't want to be further entangled in this karmic cause and effect, creating further complications.  Therefore, they wanted to send Qin Sang away.
His Altar was in chaos again, which was undoubtedly adding insult to injury for Qin Sang at this moment.
His face paled as he struggled to stabilize the Altar. He then noticed the Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court flashing with lightning, as if something unusual was happening.  Subconsciously, he poured his divine sense into the seal, too preoccupied to comprehend the seal’s power. He suddenly felt much more at ease.
The Seal of the Five Thunders Envoy Court and the Thunder Ancestor's divine intent were clearly deeply connected. It was a Thunder Department divine seal, capable of helping him stabilize the Altar.  But this was only temporary.  Qin Sang had to take advantage of this time to quickly find a secluded cave to hide.
Just then, Qin Sang caught a glimpse from the corner of his eye. A streak of light shot out from the surrounding sea of clouds and was drawn into Celestial Master Zhang’s sleeve.
“The Heavenly Patrolling Chariot has been taken away…”
The thought had barely crossed his mind when he saw Celestial Master Zhang press his palm towards him in a downward motion.
Qin Sang felt himself enveloped by a gentle force.
“No good!”
Qin Sang cried out inwardly, his eyes darting around.
In the nick of time, with quick eyes and hands, Qin Sang mustered his remaining strength and drew in the charred corpse of the black demonic roc.
Immediately, he felt his body become as heavy as a thousand jun, plummeting downwards uncontrollably.
There was no boundary to the Divine Court, no ground.
Below was a seemingly endless abyss, a void.
…
Having sent Qin Sang away,
Celestial Master Zhang looked towards the depths of space.
The blood-red thunder hadn't completely dissipated.
A tiny speck of golden light, traversing the void storm, gradually formed a golden vortex in the deep void, followed by a golden thread descending.
As the golden thread extended from the vortex, it seemed to sense something and abruptly stopped, its tip swaying gently, as if hesitating.
Celestial Master Zhang snorted coldly, raising the Dao Canon Master Seal. The seal flashed with golden inscriptions, crashing towards the vortex with a resounding boom.
‘Boom!’
The vortex shattered.
The golden thread broke apart, section by section.
Simultaneously, Celestial Master Zhang pointed his finger towards the sky, drawing a stroke that pierced the celestial vault.
This single finger actually tore open the celestial wall!
Centered around the finger mark, a void storm erupted, wind and clouds churning, thunder rolling, dark clouds surging towards both sides of the mark.
It was as if a Heavenly Gate had been opened.
Beyond the Heavenly Gate lay endless darkness, filled with a terrifying storm.
This storm wasn't merely a void storm. Beyond the storm lay an unending darkness, emanating an aura similar to the Abyss of Corruption and the Sea of Corruption, yet even more chaotic and terrifying.
That was the River of Corruption, the Grand Firmament!
The Divine Court was exposed, with no way to conceal it. Rather than delaying, it was better to directly open the Heavenly Gate and enter the Grand Firmament!
Celestial Master Zhang flew to the Heavenly Gate in his Imperial Chariot, seated upon the Imperial Throne, with the Divine Court beneath him.
As the Divine Court appeared, starlight and golden light intertwined, radiating a divine aura, illuminating all directions.
Within the Abyss of Corruption and the Sea of Corruption, the Great Calamities cowered in their lairs, trembling in fear.
The Daoist cultivators stared blankly at the heavens, watching the crack in the sky.  Those with higher cultivation could see the Imperial Chariot within the crack, and the majestic figure seated upon the Imperial Throne!
The heavens cracked, the earth shook, mountains and seas churned, as if the end of the world had come.
It was as if Celestial Master Zhang was piloting the Divine Court, leveraging the earth, carrying all beings within this realm, ascending with the entire realm!
‘Rumble… rumble… rumble…’
Beyond the Heavenly Gate, a golden light quickly vanished – it was the golden thread.
‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’
The golden thread couldn't withstand the Dao Canon Master Seal, but it didn't fully retreat.  The last segment remained, lingering in the distance, seemingly observing.
Just then,
A ten-thousand-zhang glow of rosy clouds suddenly appeared within the storm.
Wherever the rosy clouds passed, all darkness was swept away, and the storm seemed to be suppressed, creating a sense of tranquility and peace.
Within the depths of the rosy clouds, an Eighth Grade Lotus Platform slowly rotated, flying towards the Heavenly Gate.
After the Eighth Grade Lotus Platform appeared, the golden thread stirred again.
Seeing the lotus platform, Celestial Master Zhang frowned, his face grave.  He gripped the Dao Canon Master Seal, ready to strike.
Suddenly, a cyan light appeared in the distance, heading straight for the Eighth Grade Lotus Platform. It transformed into a jade ruyi, striking the platform.
‘Bang!’
The rosy clouds dispersed.
The Eighth Grade Lotus Platform trembled slightly, hesitated for a moment, then retracted its radiant light, retreating back into the depths of the darkness.
The golden thread spun faster, seemingly indecisive.
Within the depths of the darkness, there was a faint stirring.
Celestial Master Zhang's eyes flashed with surprise. He looked towards the direction from which the cyan light had come. He then saw an elderly man appear, riding a cloud towards them.
The elderly man had white hair and beard, clad in a cyan Daoist robe, exuding an immortal air, serene and natural.
The old Daoist retrieved the jade ruyi, smiling at Celestial Master Zhang.
Celestial Master Zhang gripped the armrest of the Imperial Throne, gazing at the old Daoist. He bowed slightly and asked in a deep voice, “Are you a fellow Daoist from the Dan Ding Sect?”
The elderly man nodded slightly, returning a bow.  "Alas, since the Divine Court's decline, the talismans have lost their efficacy. Now, with the opening of the Heavenly Gate and the Divine Court's return, it is truly fortunate.  This humble Daoist, Dao Xuan, is here to greet the Celestial Master!"
With that, the elderly man straightened up and sang aloud.
"The auspicious winds of the heavens blow, our Dao will prosper!"
“Rumble… rumble… rumble…”
It was like the resonance of the Great Dao!
Celestial Master Zhang’s eyes shone brightly. He stood up solemnly, returning the gesture with a formal bow, singing in response, "The auspicious winds of the heavens blow, our Dao will prosper!"
The sound reached within the realm, heard by all.
The Daoist cultivators felt their hearts surge with emotion. They planted their swords in the ground, knelt on one knee, their expressions fervent, singing in unison.
"The auspicious winds of the heavens blow, our Dao will prosper!"
"The auspicious winds of the heavens blow, our Dao will prosper!"
…
Jade-like voices resonated, shaking heaven and earth!
…
‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’
The wind howled in his ears.
Qin Sang continued to plummet, as if there was no end below.
He seemed to have fallen into a black fog, enveloped by black mist in all directions, stretching endlessly.
The black qi wasn't calm, filled with turbulent currents.
“Is this the River of Corruption?”
Just as Qin Sang felt lost, he suddenly saw a point of light in the distance, a human figure. Focusing his gaze, he realized it was Ascended Master Tian Yue.
Ascended Master Tian Yue, his back bearing a divine sword, his robes stained with blood, cupped his hands towards Qin Sang from afar.
Before Qin Sang could respond, Ascended Master Tian Yue turned and left, disappearing into the depths of the mist.
Qin Sang struggled to call out to Ascended Master Tian Yue, but he instantly lost sight of him.
The descent continued.
Qin Sang recalled certain legends, feeling like an immortal banished to the Nine Netherworld, a sinner cast into the underworld. Even the legendary underworld couldn’t be any more desolate.
The power of the Inner Lion Seal was rapidly fading, his condition worsening.
To make matters worse, the protective force surrounding him was also dissipating.
If he were swept into the River of Corruption, relying on himself alone, could he truly survive until someone came to rescue him?
The surrounding black fog grew denser, devoid of any other objects, a deathly silence, utterly despairing.
Just as Qin Sang felt extremely apprehensive,
‘Splash!’
A faint sound came from behind him. Qin Sang turned his head and saw a faint light approaching.
A small, flat-bottomed boat emerged from the black fog, its hull light, floating on the mist. A mast stood at the bow, with a paper lantern hanging from it.
The light emanated from the paper lantern, its pale, ghastly glow appearing particularly eerie within the black fog.
Beneath the lantern sat a figure, wearing a wide-brimmed hat that concealed almost their entire body.
Qin Sang felt the plummeting sensation cease abruptly, realizing he had landed on the boat.
“Thank you, Senior, for saving me.”
Qin Sang steadied himself, enduring the pain, and bowed respectfully towards the figure at the bow.
There was no response.
Qin Sang waited for a moment, then raised his head. He saw the figure sitting cross-legged at the bow, motionless, the small boat speeding through the black fog.
Beneath the wide-brimmed hat, there seemed to be nothingness, or perhaps a floating black veil, like a solitary ghost. In any case, it didn't resemble a living person.
Qin Sang remembered the First Sword Attendant mentioning that this mysterious person had existed for a very long time. A normal person couldn't survive in the River of Corruption for so long. They might not be a living being.
He didn't dare to act rashly, remaining respectfully in place. Only then did he have the opportunity to observe his surroundings.
The small boat traveled smoothly on the River of Corruption, illuminated only by the faint glow of the paper lantern, its light dimly illuminating the path ahead.
Unable to describe its speed, Qin Sang didn't know how far they had traveled.  The small boat carried him, sailing on an endless black river.
Gradually, Qin Sang noticed a different sight.
In the depths of the black fog, Qin Sang saw a beam of blue light. Just as he focused his gaze to observe, the light vanished from his sight, fleeting.
Despite the brief moment, Qin Sang managed to capture the source of the light. It seemed to be a vast azure sea, with massive icebergs floating upon it, emitting a bluish glow.
Then, Qin Sang saw many more scenes that contrasted sharply with the black fog.
A vibrant world teeming with life, with humans, demons, and all sorts of strange creatures.
A desolate, gray world devoid of life.
A world covered in lava, with countless fire spirits leaping and playing within the molten rock.
There were also similar worlds of water spirits, wind spirits…
Some were densely packed, others sparse, and some were even connected.
Some were nascent, others were declining.
Countless orbs floated along the edges of the River of Corruption, giving birth to numerous small realms, most of which were chaotic or desolate, especially those closer to the river.
Seeing these strange sights, Qin Sang understood. These were small realms, unexpectedly nurtured within the River of Corruption!
Qin Sang recalled the long, dark shadows he had seen within the Returning Ruins in the Storm Realm. Could that have been a manifestation of the River of Corruption?
Just as Qin Sang was engrossed in observation, he suddenly felt darkness before his eyes, realizing that the figure at the bow was now standing before him.  His heart skipped a beat, and the hairs on his body stood on end.
The First Sword Attendant hadn’t mentioned this.
Black veil hung from the edges of the wide-brimmed hat, completely obscuring the figure’s body.
The hat-wearing figure stood before Qin Sang, seemingly gazing at him through the hat, without uttering a word.
The more it remained this way, the more eerie Qin Sang felt, a chill creeping into his heart.
Then, Qin Sang noticed that with his head lowered, he was facing his right hand. The hat-wearing figure didn't seem to be staring at him, but at his right hand.
Immediately, Qin Sang sensed a stir within his Thousand Jun Ring.
“It’s Zhuo Yu and the white Go stone!”
Qin Sang immediately opened the Thousand Jun Ring.
‘Swish!’
With a flash of light, two objects flew out.
A pale hand, devoid of blood, like the hand of a ghost, extended from beneath the hat, gently catching them.
‘Crack!’
Zhuo Yu shattered.
Qin Sang’s heart jolted, but he didn't dare to interfere. He held his breath, his current weakened state offering no resistance. He could only hope that after taking the treasures, this person would safely send him to the Grand Firmament.
A black light shot out from Zhuo Yu – it was a black Go stone!
As the black stone appeared, the white stone immediately reacted, the two stones attracting each other, revolving around one another.
The trajectory of the two stones formed a Taiji symbol, yin and yang distinct.
The hat-wearing figure seemed to be gazing at the two stones. After a moment, they turned and drifted back to the bow, sitting down as before.
Seeing the stones about to fall, Qin Sang quickly reached out and caught them, looking towards the cloaked figure.
“Senior…”
Qin Sang hesitated, then felt a blur before his eyes, his vision filled with light.
The River of Corruption, the small boat, and the mysterious figure were all gone.
Vast blue waves stretched before him.
Peaceful and serene.

1. Volume Seven, "The Chronicles," coming soon.
2. I've had a cold for the past few days, and it hasn't gotten better. Because it's the end of the volume, it wasn't easy to take a break, so I forced myself to update.
Right now, I just feel tired, very tired.
I need to sleep well for a few days and adjust. I'll tentatively take a five-day break. (End of Chapter)
