Chapter 188: Follow-up Cultivation Method

Qin Sang felt that Yue Rou's emotions had slowly recovered, and she nodded at Yue Xing, saying, "Don't worry, your sister directly touched the sword mark with her divine consciousness, and was impacted by the killing intent remaining in the sword mark. It will be difficult for her to get rid of it for a while, but fortunately, she was not injured. She will be fine after a night's sleep."

Hearing Qin Sang say this, Yue Xing reluctantly suppressed the worry in her heart, hugged Yue Rou, who was still trembling slightly tightly, and looked at the sword mark with some horror.

Whose sword mark was this? It was so dangerous that it could not be touched with divine consciousness?

She carefully guarded her divine consciousness with her primordial spirit space, not daring to reveal anything.

Qin Sang turned and lifted her head, as she expected, there was also an indiscernible slit on the top of the cave.

It was imaginable that someone was holding a sword above the cave, or even standing on the water surface, and with a gentle swing, released a sword qi through the lake water. Ignoring the illusion formation and the restriction, it pierced through the cave and left a sword mark on the stone bed, which was just the right spot.

It was estimated that Immortal Cang Li was not in the cave at that time, so he was lucky not to have been cut in half with a single sword, but he was eventually caught and could not escape his doom.

Now, Qin Sang could be sure that the person who left this sword mark was definitely Senior Qing Zhu!

Only someone who had cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" would be able to feel how special the sword qi remaining on the sword mark was, the intent to kill in the sword qi, and the killing talisman in the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" originated from the same source!

In Shaohua Mountain, as far as Qin Sang knew, only Senior Qing Zhu had truly cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter", and had not been eroded by the intent to kill and lost his mind, and successfully cultivated it, and broken through the Golden Core.

This was the sword mark of an Immortal in the Golden Core realm!

If it were not for the fact that the sword mark had been there for a long time, and the sword qi and killing intent on the sword mark had dissipated by more than ninety percent, with Yue Rou's cultivation level, the moment her divine consciousness touched the sword mark, her soul would be completely shattered by the killing intent, and her primordial spirit would wither and die.

However, what surprised and astonished Qin Sang was not this, but that the killing intent in this sword mark was too pure, even purer and more extreme than the fifth killing talisman!

Qin Sang had originally thought that Senior Qing Zhu had changed to another cultivation method, but now it seemed that he had continued on the path of killing. Could it be that he had found the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" after the fifth level?

Why was it not collected in the Treasure Pagoda Peak?

Qin Sang sat cross-legged in front of the stone bed, and sent out her divine consciousness to touch the sword mark.

She was a cultivator in the Foundation realm, and she would not be unable to resist a sword mark from hundreds of years ago, and she also cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter", so she had nothing to fear.

Qin Sang was like a dead tree, motionless.

Yue Xing didn't dare to disturb Qin Sang, and she was worried about Yue Rou's condition and worried that the cave that they had好不容易 found had been destroyed by this sword mark, and whether it could still be used.

"Hmm..."

After a while, Yue Rou suddenly moved and woke up slowly, Yue Xing's face was full of joy, and she asked in a soft and anxious voice, "How do you feel now? Are you hurt anywhere?"

"My head hurts so much..."

Yue Rou held her head, her eyes were a little dazed, and she hadn't figured out the situation yet. When she saw the stone bed, a thick look of terror suddenly appeared in her eyes, and she suddenly shrank into Yue Xing's arms, trembling Said: "That crack...it's so scary inside..."

"What did you see?" Yue Xing asked curiously.

"I...I seem to have fallen into a sea of ​​corpses and blood..."

……

"Phew..."

After several hours, Qin Sang opened her eyes. After careful understanding, she confirmed Qin Sang's previous conjecture. Senior Qing Zhu had reached a higher level in the way of killing. Even if he had not found the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing" after the fifth level, he must have obtained a new secret method of killing.

After thinking for a while, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, visualized the killing talisman, and released a sword qi, which landed on the sword mark without any deviation.

He saw a faint sword light flickering, the sword qi remaining on the sword mark was offset.

"I have wiped away the sword qi remaining on the sword mark. You don't need to be afraid in the future."

Qin Sang retracted the Ebony Sword, and without waiting for the two Yue sisters to show joy, she said in a condensed voice, "Should the two fellow daoists fulfill their promise?"

Yue Xing suppressed her excitement, "We will follow Senior to Wenyue Market and give you the spiritual spring object."

The restriction was broken, but the naturally formed illusion formation was not damaged. As long as the Yue sisters were cautious enough, they would not have to worry about someone seizing the cave.

The three quickly returned to Wenyue Market, and after the Yue sisters confirmed it, they obtained the tree root from Granny Jing, and Granny Jing, as a witness, only needed Qin Sang and the Yue sisters to buy a carving in her shop as payment.

Qin Sang picked a peach wood sword and quickly bid farewell to Granny Jing, and went straight to Tianhen Building.

After reviewing the case materials in Tianhen Tower, Qin Sang returned to Mount Shaohua to consult with familiar fellow disciples, including Senior Brother Wen. He also thoroughly searched all the documents in Pagoda Peak.

Qin Sang contemplated the information he collected over the past few days in seclusion. He could almost be sure that Senior Qingzhu was indeed the Sword Demon.

Although more than ten years passed between Senior Qingzhu’s departure from Mount Shaohua and the Sword Demon attacking Mystic Nether Sect, the so-called case was only fully understood after bodies were successively discovered following the Sword Demon attacking Mystic Nether Sect, confirming that they were all from the Immortal’s Abode.

Due to the time difference, there were speculations that the Sword Demon was Senior Qingzhu but no confirmation.

During that time, Senior Qingzhu secretly investigated and killed his enemies one by one.

Some of the fellow disciples had indeed heard of it, but Mount Shaohua had erased Senior Qingzhu’s records. The two major sects seemed to have deliberately suppressed the incident. As time passed, no one was willing to waste time thoroughly investigating the outside world, viewing it as a legend or gossip.

The Sword Demon disappeared completely after attacking Mystic Nether Sect. Some said that he was killed by the Mystic Nether Sect, and others said that he left the Small Cold Region.

There were various speculations.

There was news of Senior Qingzhu. It was said that a disciple of Mount Shaohua had encountered Senior Qingzhu on the ancient battlefield of immortals and was rescued. However, that was all. The disciple was long gone.

It was unknown if Senior Qingzhu was still alive. If he had not broken through to the Nascent Soul realm, his lifespan would be over.

Qin Sang was so concerned about Senior Qingzhu because of the “Soul Manifestation Sword Nurturing Chapter.” Pagoda Peak only had fragments of the “Soul Manifestation Sword Nurturing Chapter,” and Senior Qingzhu might have found the remaining techniques.

If possible, Qin Sang did not want to switch to other techniques. It was one of the most suitable ones for him. It could not only help him raise his cultivation speed but also allow him to have an extra natal magic treasure after breaking through to the Golden Core realm, giving him an advantage during combat.

Of course, the prerequisite was that Qin Sang could establish his Golden Core.

To him, it was still too early to talk about it, and there was no need to rush.

He could slowly investigate after entering the immortal battlefield. Even if Senior Qingzhu had fallen in the immortal battlefield, he could still search for his remains or relics.
