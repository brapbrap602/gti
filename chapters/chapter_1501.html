<h1>Chapter 1492: The Stele (4k)</h1><p>Deep within the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>Darkness hung heavy and impenetrable.  There were no floating islands here; the void was filled with terrifying, invisible turbulence. A single misstep could lead to being swept away and pulverized.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators had to move with extreme caution.</p><p>Several figures navigated the chaotic currents. Leading the group were the Hunmo Elder and the Tianpeng Sage.</p><p>“Are you certain a stele could survive in a place like this?”</p><p>Tianpeng Sage’s eyes were sharp as he scanned the darkness, his tone laced with doubt.  This place was too chaotic. The destructive power of the currents was far beyond anything outside; it was the source of the chaos itself.  It was conceivable that even the floating islands from the outside, if they somehow drifted in, would be shattered by the currents in moments, reduced to dust. Perhaps floating islands had existed here before, only to be annihilated.</p><p>They had searched everywhere, but hadn't found a single solid object. Yet, the Hunmo Elder was having them search for a stele here.</p><p>“The information I received confirmed the existence of a stele, a kind of marker.  Something like that wouldn’t be destroyed by mere currents,”</p><p>Hunmo Elder scanned his surroundings, replying with conviction.</p><p>“Since you know the stele exists, you don’t know what’s on it?” Tianpeng Sage eyed Hunmo Elder skeptically, questioning his previous statement.</p><p>Hunmo Elder chuckled, “I originally intended to act secretly, entering the Sacred Grounds alone to investigate and verify the information before planning for the next opening of the Sacred Grounds by the Xuan Tian Palace. However, an accidental discovery gave me a 60% certainty, and now, it's risen to 100%!”</p><p>“An accidental discovery? The Reishi Ruyi?”</p><p>Tianpeng Sage was even more suspicious, sensing that Hunmo Elder was hiding something.  After entering the Sacred Grounds, Hunmo Elder had immediately put the treasure away—clearly something was amiss.</p><p>“If this treasure originates from the Sacred Grounds, its purpose can't be just to indicate the location, can it?”</p><p>“You have sharp eyes, Sage.”</p><p>Hunmo Elder glanced at Tianpeng Sage, his expression calm.  He turned to look behind him, finding no pursuers. After a moment’s hesitation, he cast a silencing barrier and cautiously took out an item.</p><p>It was the Reishi Ruyi.</p><p>The Reishi Ruyi was now enveloped by a small sphere of condensed demonic energy.  Without any action from Hunmo Elder, the Reishi Ruyi trembled repeatedly, its intense glow nearly piercing the demonic energy and dispelling the darkness.  Without the demonic energy’s containment, the Reishi Ruyi would have shone brightly like the moon in the night.</p><p>Seeing this, Tianpeng Sage's eyes flickered,  intuitively understanding something.</p><p>“Why hasn’t the Xuan Tian Palace pursued us?” Hunmo Elder looked at Tianpeng Sage before quickly putting away the Reishi Ruyi, then asked the question himself.</p><p>Before Tianpeng Sage could answer, Hunmo Elder answered his own question, “The Xuan Tian Palace has occupied the Sacred Grounds for ages. Their experts must have explored countless times and concluded that we wouldn’t find anything of value, so they are calmly waiting outside to watch us fail. If I released the Reishi Ruyi now, and the Xuan Tian Palace witnessed the phenomenon…”</p><p>Hunmo Elder paused, leaving the rest unsaid.  But everyone present understood what would happen.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace tolerated their presence because they believed them to be ignorant of the Sacred Grounds and destined to return empty-handed.  However, if they discovered a treasure connected to the Sacred Grounds, they would undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to claim it!</p><p>A direct confrontation with the Xuan Tian Palace was undesirable.  Hunmo Elder chose to seal the Reishi Ruyi, patiently searching for the stele before releasing the treasure to see what would happen. Even if the Xuan Tian Palace detected it then, they would be a step behind.  It was a shrewd move.</p><p>Tianpeng Sage nodded slightly, saying no more and accepting the explanation.</p><p>Hunmo Elder said meaningfully, “Sage, you seem very wary of Yin Changsheng.  Your initiating the war between the two realms—was it a test of Yin Changsheng?”</p><p>Tianpeng Sage snorted but didn’t deny it.</p><p>Hunmo Elder showed curiosity,  “When I reached the peak of my cultivation, Yin Changsheng had already become reclusive and rarely appeared. I don't know much about him. I heard that the Nine-Headed Sage became famous even earlier than Yin Changsheng; you must have interacted with him, right?”</p><p>“The Nine-Headed Sage also once attempted to lead our race out of the Demon Realm.”</p><p>Tianpeng Sage spoke with evident displeasure.</p><p>The statement was essentially admitting a weakness, boosting the reputation of others while diminishing his own.</p><p>The others exchanged glances, surprised. The Nine-Headed Sage, known throughout the Northern Sea for his detached nature, had been forced into it!</p><p>Their curiosity soared to its peak.  What had happened then that forced the Nine-Headed Sage into such prolonged forbearance?</p><p>Tianpeng Sage looked annoyed and didn't want to explain.  The others didn't press him, suppressing their curiosity.</p><p>It seems I underestimated the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace.  Luckily, I invited the Great Sage along.”</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder noticed the change in expression on the others’ faces and chuckled. “Fellow Daoists, there’s no need for excessive worry.  The sacred site’s been breached, yet Yin Changsheng has remained hidden in his palanquin like a coward. There must be a reason. The Great Sage and I suspected that Yin Changsheng is in some kind of predicament, unable to act.”</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder looked around.</p><p>Gui General, Huang Mei Yao Wang, Yu Yi Yuan Jun, Bi Fang…</p><p>All the famed Northern Sea demons were present.</p><p>“Since Xuan Tian Palace hasn’t pursued us, let’s split up and search. Find the stele as quickly as possible.  Everyone, be vigilant. Beware of Xuan Tian Palace experts lurking in the shadows.”</p><p>Tian Peng Great Sage followed closely behind the Hun Mo Elder, still wary.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder remained unconcerned.</p><p>The group split up, searching in pairs through the endless chaotic currents of darkness.</p><p>…</p><p>The Cleansing Pool.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang’s tightly closed eyes slowly opened, bloodshot and rimmed with red.  However, his gaze held a look of relief.</p><p>Finally, the intense pain in his body began to subside.</p><p>“I’ve finally made it through.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy.</p><p>He found himself still in the empty void. The flickering lights around him were unchanged from before, but the strange power had completely vanished, not a trace remaining.</p><p>It seemed to have been completely absorbed by him.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, moved slightly, his brows furrowing unconsciously.</p><p>He focused his attention inward.</p><p>His cultivation hadn't improved noticeably, for the Cleansing Pool’s true function wasn't that.</p><p>When he examined his Nascent Soul, he felt it had become lighter, as if it had shed a heavy burden, undergoing a transformation amidst the pain, yet emerging more stable.</p><p>Could the Cleansing Pool refer to the Nascent Soul itself?</p><p>“I wonder how much my cultivation speed will improve?”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly considered this, but didn’t rush to leave the Cleansing Pool to test it.</p><p>He turned his body and looked down.</p><p>He had promised Liuli that he would retrieve the treasure for her; he couldn't break his word.</p><p>As far as he could see, the void was incredibly deep, filled with multicolored lights. Even with his divine eye ability, he couldn't see through to the depths of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his condition. His meridians showed no significant injuries, his Nascent Soul was normal, only the true energy in his dantian hadn't yet calmed. The previous pain hadn't caused him serious harm.</p><p>Qin Sang took a pill, paused for a moment, and recovered completely, slowly sinking to the bottom of the pool.</p><p>The seemingly narrow Cleansing Pool was unexpectedly deep.</p><p>The multicolored lights shifted around Qin Sang; he felt like he'd fallen into a kaleidoscopic, multicolored world, unable to distinguish between reality and illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly descended, suddenly stopping after a short time, looking down.</p><p>The multicolored lights remained, but there was a more dangerous aura. Qin Sang's gaze swept across the beams of light, finally settling on where they converged.</p><p>“Ancient Restrictions.”</p><p>Qin Sang discerned the clue, realizing he’d found the right place.</p><p>Liuli’s master, Bing Yao, had passed through here and discovered the treasure at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't cultivated Ice Soul Divine Light, so he could only search slowly.</p><p>He summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly, using his ability to its full extent, gazing downwards.</p><p>His vision pierced through the multicolored lights, revealing only layers upon layers of ancient restrictions.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang summoned the Jin Chen Sword, releasing a sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy descended slowly.</p><p>This was only a test; Qin Sang was still inside the Cleansing Pool and didn’t dare act recklessly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ancient restrictions easily absorbed the sword energy without any reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his strength, releasing three more sword strikes in succession.</p><p>This also served another purpose: attempting to contact Liuli.</p><p>Liuli was waiting at the Taotie Lake. If the restrictions in both locations were connected, she should be able to sense the disturbance here and send a signal back, making the treasure hunt much easier later.</p><p>Unfortunately, this didn't work. Qin Sang received no response from Liuli and had to descend alone.</p><p>The ancient restrictions became denser the deeper he went.</p><p>The multicolored lights here were extremely dazzling, each beam containing countless restrictions, intricately connected.</p><p>Bing Yao had exerted all her strength, only managing to break through a portion before reluctantly returning.</p><p>With enough time and the Sky Eye Butterfly’s assistance, Qin Sang might be able to break through the layers of restrictions and reach the deepest part.</p><p>Now, however, he had to occasionally use force to break through the restrictions.</p><p>The counterattack from the restrictions became increasingly fierce.</p><p>Qin Sang acted cautiously, activating the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, creating a protective罡罩 (energy shield), still feeling uneasy. He summoned demonic fire, forming a fire armor around himself.</p><p>…</p><p>The bottom of Taotie Lake.</p><p>Around Liuli, layers of light walls formed a cage-like structure.</p><p>She waited patiently without making any rash moves.</p><p>Just then…</p><p>Liuli seemed to sense something, her expression shifting slightly as she turned to a luminous wall.  She sensed a subtle fluctuation emanating from behind it.  The fluctuation was faint, completely unlike the suction force, and most likely caused by Qin Sang breaking the ancient seals.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool and the Gluttonous Lake were indeed connected!</p><p>A幽蓝 glow flashed in Liuli's eyes as she activated her Ice Soul Radiance, eroding the luminous wall and moving towards the source of the fluctuation.</p><p>The Gluttonous Lake was similarly unfathomable.  The ancient seals here were not as intricate as those in the Cleansing Pool. Liuli, without much difficulty, found herself at the edge of the Gluttonous Lake.</p><p>She furrowed her brow slightly, observing carefully before discovering an extremely hidden opening in the stone wall, just large enough for one person to enter. Fortunately, there was no suction force inside.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment before darting into the passage. Inside, she found a network of twisting tunnels, incredibly complex.  A suction force was present deeper within the cave system.</p><p>Following the fluctuations of the seals, and carefully avoiding the suction, Liuli navigated countless branching paths. Finally, she felt a strange resonance, emanating from her Ice Soul Radiance.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Liuli immediately sat cross-legged, attempting to use the Ice Soul Radiance to attract the treasure, as taught by her master.  Bing Yao had discovered that activating the Ice Soul Radiance in a specific pattern could cause resonance with the treasure, a connection that could be used as a guide.</p><p>Bing Yao's plan was to continue breaking the seals, advancing until they could influence the Cleansing Pool, coordinating an internal and external attack to help those inside retrieve the treasure.  However, Qin Sang was capable of retrieving the treasure alone. Liuli could conserve her energy and simply guide him.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang had already ventured deep within, struggling to advance while still failing to locate the target. The ancient seals were in disarray thanks to his efforts, making it difficult to determine direction. Without guidance, finding the treasure here was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>His earlier fears had been realized; Qin Sang suspected the treasure had moved. Fortunately, he possessed ample magical artifacts and formidable strength, and had not yet encountered any life-threatening situations.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was patiently searching the Cleansing Pool, a faint anomaly appeared to his lower left, not far away.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he immediately moved towards it. The fluctuation followed a clear pattern, its location constantly shifting.  It was likely caused by Liuli, as he had expected.</p><p>He was relieved to have prepared a backup plan; otherwise, the search would have taken far longer!  Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and, as agreed, attacked the seal three times at ten-breath intervals to signal Liuli that her approach was working.</p><p>He then locked onto the fluctuation and moved towards it at maximum speed.</p><p>With a whoosh, magical flames shot out, landing on a surface of green light and quickly spreading. Qin Sang followed closely, pausing briefly before carefully controlling the magical flames to gently break the ancient seal within the green light. The fluctuation was behind that green light!</p><p>The green light gradually thinned.  Soon, a crack appeared within it.  Qin Sang finally saw the treasure.</p><p>It was a cicada!</p><p>"An Eight-Winged Heart Cicada!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes showed a hint of surprise as he instantly recognized it! The Eight-Winged Heart Cicada had a unique appearance, with eight ice-like wings arranged in parallel on its back, its body translucent and crystalline, like sculpted ice, its eyes like two snowflakes—exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>Qin Sang never imagined that the treasure Liuli and her master sought was a spirit insect.  In the rankings of the Imperial Spirit Sect, the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada was undoubtedly among the extraordinary insects.</p><p>However, neither the Extraordinary Insect List nor the Witch Insect List contained detailed accounts of the Eight-Winged Heart Cicada's abilities, as this type of spirit cicada had disappeared years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely, making a new discovery.</p><p>"This isn't an Eight-Winged Heart Cicada, but a molt!  Liuli and her master went to great lengths for just a mere molt. What good is an Eight-Winged Heart Cicada molt to the Ice Soul Radiance?"</p><p>Qin Sang was perplexed. He knew little about this spirit insect and couldn't determine which instar this molt belonged to.</p><p>This Eight-Winged Heart Cicada had slumbered at the bottom of the Cleansing Pool for countless years, completing its metamorphosis, leaving behind its molt, and departing.</p><p>Unable to figure out the reason, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, taking out a spirit talisman and directing the Ice Soul Radiance sealed within it at the molt, preparing to retrieve it.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance touched the molt and effortlessly merged into it.  However, Qin Sang inexplicably felt a strange sensation. This molt…</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful suction force erupted without warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically. Caught off guard, he could only activate his protective artifacts before being sucked in with a dizzying swirl.</p>
