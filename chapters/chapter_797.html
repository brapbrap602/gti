<h1>Chapter 789 Breakthrough</h1><p>Qinsang had never had a true master. </p><p>His most frequent mentor was the wandering cultivator Yunyouzi, a friend as much as a teacher. However, after Qinsang was transported to the Canglang Sea, they were separated by vast distances and hadn't seen each other for decades.</p><p>Especially in the way of the sword, Qinsang had always explored alone.  When had he ever encountered such a dedicated teacher?</p><p>Each time, the swordsmen pinpointed his weaknesses.</p><p>Thanks to his cultivation technique, Qinsang had independently grasped the Sword Qi Resonance. But without guidance, the process was long, and his comprehension of Sword Light Splitting had been slow.</p><p>However, the lengthy process wasn't without its benefits. Without this experience, his current progress wouldn't be so rapid.</p><p>Now, having encountered a renowned teacher, it could be said that his accumulated efforts were finally bearing fruit.</p><p>Qinsang entered the passage again, not yet fully recovered.</p><p>Swords are unforgiving. Those swordsmen wouldn't kill him, but injuries were unavoidable.  Especially in the last few battles, Qinsang had sustained several sword wounds.</p><p>He swallowed a medicinal pill, suppressing his injuries, and walked in without looking back.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity, and time was limited. He had to comprehend as much as possible before the Seven Kills Hall closed.</p><p>Stepping back into the passage, the familiar cyan light descended, and the swordsman appeared.</p><p>This time, Qinsang was experienced. He didn't rush to defeat the swordsman, but instead cleared his mind of all distractions, forgetting everything, and focused on comprehending the sword during the battle.</p><p>Defeated again and again, he returned to the passage again and again.</p><p>Qinsang's wounds increased, but he ignored them, wiping away the blood, swallowing medicinal pills, and rushing back into the passage, absorbing everything like a sponge.</p><p>His swordsmanship was rapidly improving.</p><p>Now, his swordsmanship was no longer limited to specific techniques. He could wield his sword freely, using the most appropriate moves as his heart dictated.  He had finally entered the true realm of swordsmanship.</p><p>If he was willing to dedicate himself to research, he had the opportunity to create his own sword techniques.</p><p>In the past, he could only use Sword Qi Resonance as a surprise attack, lacking versatility. Now, having reached a higher level, his flying sword was unpredictable, making his opponents exhausted.</p><p>These weren't the most exciting developments for Qinsang.</p><p>He could clearly feel himself getting closer and closer to Sword Light Splitting!</p><p>…</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>Sudden, unrestrained laughter echoed through the passage.</p><p>Qinsang stood tall at the entrance, his Ebony Sword floating before him.</p><p>As his mind willed it, the Ebony Sword trembled slightly, splitting off a beam of sword light. But then, another illusory sword shadow slowly emerged!</p><p>This flickering sword shadow was the nascent form of Sword Light Splitting!</p><p>“As long as I don't compare myself to a monster like Senior Qingzhu, my talent isn't too bad! Even among Core Formation cultivators, only a few grasp Sword Light Splitting, right…?”</p><p>A slight smile played on Qinsang's lips.</p><p>He hadn't expected that after countless battles, a flash of inspiration would allow him to grasp Sword Light Splitting on the spot.</p><p>However, he knew clearly that while the swordsmen deserved credit for his great progress, the "Nurturing the Sword with the Primordial Spirit" also played a vital role.</p><p>Although it was only the nascent form of a sword shadow, the first step was always the hardest. Qinsang believed that it wouldn't be long before he could split off a true sword light. With just his sword in hand, he might be able to fight opponents of higher cultivation!</p><p>Legend had it that top swordsmen could fight against thousands.</p><p>Qinsang didn't have such grand ambitions. As long as his strength increased, he would be satisfied.</p><p>Qinsang retracted his Ebony Sword and looked confidently towards the depths of the passage.</p><p>He could now easily defeat his former self when he first entered.</p><p>Within the passage, he could definitely go further.</p><p>This time, he didn't rush. He sat cross-legged, circulating his cultivation technique, focusing on healing and adjusting his breath to reach peak condition. His gaze deepened as he entered the passage once more.</p><p>Opponents he previously found difficult were no longer a major problem.</p><p>Qinsang smoothly reached the point of his previous furthest advance, effortlessly defeating the swordsman.  He glanced at the spot where he was previously defeated and strode forward.</p><p>But soon Qinsang encountered trouble.</p><p>The swordsmen were also growing, becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p>Later on, every battle was a fierce struggle.</p><p>Qinsang's gaze was firm as he stared at the end of the passage, pushing forward step by step, putting all his effort into facing the swordsmen.</p><p>Finally… he saw what lay at the end of the passage.</p><p>There was no stone gate, nor an altar. Instead, there was a stone staircase leading upwards. The light was dim, revealing only four steps, polished to an extraordinary smoothness.</p><p>Qinsang gave up resisting and was transported to the entrance of the passage. He stared into the darkness, lost in thought.</p><p>He was curious about where the stairs led. No matter what was inside, he had to go. Even if there was no teleportation formation, it must be related to the "Nurturing the Sword with the Primordial Spirit."</p><p>Then he looked at the place where Senior Qingzhu had left the jade slip.</p><p>“If the stairs lead to an ancient teleportation formation, could Senior Qingzhu have already returned to the Small Cold Realm?”</p><p>Qinsang muttered to himself, uncertain.</p><p>Since he didn't know Qingzhu's life story, everything was just speculation. If he could learn about Senior Qingzhu's experiences through Spirit Turtle Island, it might be helpful.</p><p>It was clearly impossible to break through at this time.</p><p>Qinsang had only reached halfway despite his best efforts. He calculated that the final guardian swordsman should have a cultivation comparable to a peak Late Core Formation cultivator, and possessed top-tier swordsmanship, making him extremely powerful.</p><p>He would need to face two top experts at once.</p><p>This posed a problem for Qinsang. He understood the strength of the swordsmen. Even if he broke through to the peak of Late Core Formation by the next time he entered, his chances of winning weren't high.</p><p>Moreover, he still didn't know how to solve the problem with the Ebony Sword, and his cultivation could stagnate at any moment.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Suddenly, Qinsang remembered something and hurriedly took out a jade slip, the one left by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>He looked at the demonic art, "Planting the Demonic Fetus," a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Could there be a deeper meaning behind Senior Qingzhu leaving only this particular secret technique?</p><p>The demonic seed for the external avatar was refined from sword souls, and the passage restrictions didn't seal the Ebony Sword. Could it be because of the sword soul that an external avatar could enter?</p><p>If he brought a Late Core Formation external avatar, he might have a good chance of winning.</p><p>With this thought, Qinsang immediately made a decision.</p><p>Regardless of the odds, it was worth a gamble. Refining an external avatar wouldn't harm him. Even if his guess was wrong, he would gain a powerful combat asset.</p><p>He lingered in the passage for a while longer, finally bowing towards it as a gesture of gratitude to the swordsmen for their guidance.</p><p>"A single sword path has given me such a great opportunity, allowing me to comprehend Sword Light Splitting… Ancient cultivators, Seven Kills Hall…"</p><p>Qinsang walked out, gazing at the stone wall with boundless longing.</p><p>Looking around, he was momentarily unsure where to go.</p><p>His gains from this trip were considerable. Although he hadn't found the teleportation formation, he had discovered the clues left by Senior Qingzhu and found this passage that might lead to the formation.  This was enough to be exhilarating.</p><p>Qinsang took out his jade token and checked it. He realized that he had spent too much time comprehending swordsmanship in the passage, and it was almost time to leave.</p><p>In such a short time, it was almost impossible to make any discoveries within the Celestial Tower.</p>
