<h1>Chapter 1562:  The Prison of Withering Life</h1><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>…</p><p>The earth shattered into countless fragments.  Qin Sang, like a wild bull, charged forward relentlessly. After this battle, this area will likely collapse completely.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man and Qin Sang chased and fled. The grey-robed man trailed behind, several times attempting to use his poison techniques, but failing to harm Qin Sang. He could only focus on controlling the five-colored poisonous spider, pursuing relentlessly to help the grotesque-faced man track Qin Sang.</p><p>Wherever Qin Sang passed, sword energy raged, and wind and snow poured down.  Palm-sized snowflakes danced around him, vines surging from all directions.  The seemingly light snowflakes effortlessly severed countless vines.</p><p>But this only temporarily relieved the pressure; his situation didn't improve.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the grotesque-faced man only pursued relentlessly, not deploying more powerful magical treasures to hinder or kill him.  This man’s mastery of wood-elemental techniques was exceptionally profound, unparalleled in Qin Sang's experience.  Even with such simple attacks as the wooden beads, Qin Sang had to exert all his strength to cope.</p><p>However, the power of the wooden beads still had limitations; the pressure it exerted on Qin Sang was far less than that of Yin Changsheng's Hanging Sword Tower.  Throughout this chase, the grotesque-faced man didn't use any pseudo-spiritual treasures.</p><p>However, the grotesque-faced man's jade insect instantly disabled Lu Zhang. Once fully cultivated, it would likely be more terrifying than ordinary pseudo-spiritual treasures.</p><p>I wonder if cultivators in Central State all cultivate secret techniques similar to the *Sacrifice Yuan Technique*.</p><p>Refining one's own treasure into a pseudo-spiritual treasure, and gradually increasing its power, requires cultivators to spend time and energy, achieving slow results.  This process inevitably encroaches upon the time spent on cultivation and learning other magical abilities.</p><p>Especially for grand cultivators who have only recently broken through to the late Yuan Ying stage, there are many things they could do, and they might not be willing to spend their time on this.</p><p>Perhaps, the grotesque-faced man gave up other pursuits to cultivate the jade insect.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he analyzed his opponent based on what he'd observed.  Since the grotesque-faced man wasn't pressing the attack, Qin Sang didn't mind engaging him, waiting for Lu Zhang to recover.</p><p>During his escape, Qin Sang tried various methods, using all his life's learnings and magical abilities, mostly from the ice elemental path.  Behind Qin Sang, ice explosions, ice walls, and ice mirrors created a dazzling array of obstacles.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang constantly changed direction and created ice illusions, attempting to confuse his opponent.</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly discovered his efforts were in vain. No matter what he did, the grotesque-faced man always accurately captured his movements, yet Qin Sang felt no sense of being locked onto by divine sense.</p><p>This detail made Qin Sang realize that before they found the stone toad, the opponent had certainly been tracking them for a long time, yet he and Lu Zhang were completely unaware.</p><p>All signs indicated the opponent had a way to monitor them from afar, possessing acutely sensitive perception even within the miasma.</p><p>If so, trying to use the miasma to escape would likely backfire!</p><p>'BOOM!'</p><p>The ice wall collapsed.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man, riding a wave of vines, appeared behind him. Whether intentional or not, he always maintained a certain distance from Qin Sang, unhurried, as if toying with his prey, enjoying the despair on the hunted's face as it approached its end.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm and collected, secretly observing the grotesque-faced man, but could discern nothing unusual.  A layer of green light enveloped the grotesque-faced man, blocking the poisonous miasma. This suggested that although he had cultivated a king-level insect, he might not be proficient in poison techniques himself.</p><p>"Could it be another person?"</p><p>Qin Sang had a sudden inspiration, thinking of the grey-robed man.  During the struggle for the stone toad, he had fought the grey-robed man, whose performance was more like a cultivator specializing in poison techniques. Qin Sang also recalled that when the light of the treasure bell shone on the grey-robed man, it seemed to reveal a five-colored poisonous spider.</p><p>Like the jade insect, this poisonous spider was also outside his knowledge, most likely artificially cultivated.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Qin Sang diverted a fraction of his attention to observe the grey-robed man behind the vine wave.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly saw the grotesque-faced man make a strange movement.  He closed his eyes slightly, green light erupted from his palm, and the wooden beads gradually turned transparent, until they became a mass of deep green light, then shattered into countless light points, scattering.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart leaped, a warning flaring up.</p><p>These green light points rained down, easily penetrating and disappearing into the earth and stones upon contact.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The surroundings seemed to receive some kind of response; the entire earth began to shake violently.  Qin Sang found himself at the epicenter of the tremor.</p><p>Immediately, cracking sounds came from all directions, countless sounds converging together, surging into Qin Sang's ears like a tide.</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed, with her own eyes, vines bursting through the stone wall, tearing it to shreds.  They weren't merely vines; they were thick as pythons, resembling the roots of an ancient tree, dense and countless.  Wall after wall collapsed before her, revealing a shocking sight.  The ground was hollowed out, inexplicably overgrown with countless vines that completely surrounded Qin Sang, leaving no gaps whatsoever, making her and the Snow-piercing Blade seem incredibly fragile.</p><p>The strange-faced man had been laying his trap, only now unleashing it.  His throat moved, and he emitted a low, guttural voice: "Sen Luo Ku Yu!"</p><p>The moment the sound left his lips, the vines instantly stopped growing.  Even those about to ensnare Qin Sang froze in place, their luster rapidly fading, becoming dry and withered.  All the vines lost their vitality at once.  While the previous scene had been terrifying, it had been full of life. Now, death permeated the air.  The transition between life and death was utterly chilling.</p><p>With the utterance of "Yu," the vines vanished like a dream, perhaps never having truly existed.  All that remained were wisps of black energy, reeking of decay.</p><p>Greyish-white energy mingled, forming a black vortex above Qin Sang, spinning faster and faster, descending rapidly.  Upon contact with this energy, even Qin Sang's protective blade energy turned black.  The snowflakes blackened and silently melted, wilting like the vines.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. She wielded the Snow-piercing Blade, unleashing a powerful blade energy.  The energy cleaved through the air, piercing the vortex, but it was eroded as it penetrated deeper, ultimately succumbing to the dark energy and vanishing completely.</p><p>The vortex of dark energy pulsed and continued to approach.  Qin Sang swept her hand upward, her Xuan Qi forming a gigantic hand that grasped the vortex.  She squeezed with all her might, but with a resounding "bang," her Xuan Qi was dispersed.</p><p>The strange-faced man appeared above, the vines gone.  He stood in mid-air, looking down condescendingly.  Only the black vortex was visible; Qin Sang's figure was obscured, seemingly at her wit's end.</p><p>The grey-robed man descended, a smirk on his face, flattering his master, "Master, with Sen Luo Ku Yu unleashed, this person is surely dead!"</p><p>The strange-faced man's brow suddenly furrowed.</p><p>Then, a non-human roar erupted from below the vortex.  The dark vortex shuddered, becoming stagnant, a fissure appearing in its center. A supremely pure blue, cold light pierced through the crack.  A gigantic creature was vaguely revealed below: a huge serpent.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The serpent raised its head, opening its bloody maw. A ball of icy flame formed in its throat and erupted in a roar.</p><p>The strange-faced man's expression finally changed. He hastily reached out his deformed right hand, grasping at the vortex.  Green points of light faintly appeared at the vortex's center, about to coalesce into a sphere, when the icy flame slammed into it.</p><p>The fissure not only failed to close but expanded violently, more cracks spreading until it became a sea of intertwining blue and black light. The icy flame, unstoppable, shattered Sen Luo Ku Yu, its momentum undiminished.</p><p>Waves surged in the heart of the light sea, shooting out a blue pillar of fire. The serpent burst forth, its fangs and claws bared, lunging at its enemy.  The extreme cold far surpassed that of the Snow-piercing Blade.</p><p>For a moment, both the strange-faced man and his disciple felt their blood freeze.</p><p>The strange-faced man, caught in the brunt of the attack, lacked the time to re-form the wooden sphere. He abruptly retracted his right arm, a rough piece of wood, like bark, flying from his chest.</p><p>The wood vanished in a flash.  Simultaneously, subtle ripples appeared in the surrounding void, faintly green, followed by the phantom of a towering ancient tree.  The strange-faced man was perfectly shielded in the tree's center.</p><p>As the tree materialized, the serpent attacked, its long tail whipping out, laced with icy flames, striking the tree with tremendous force.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>The strange-faced man trembled violently, flying back.  The tree’s phantom swayed violently, the piece of wood flickering.  The wood was clearly a magical artifact; the seemingly fragile tree phantom possessed formidable defensive power, collapsing but not breaking.</p><p>Below, four serpent seals floated before Qin Sang, one serpent missing from the seal's clasp. Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>He was forced to counterattack with his spiritual treasure, a surprise move, but not the optimal timing.  Knowing this strike wouldn't severely injure the masked man, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and his hand seals changed.</p><p>The giant snake roared, abandoning its pursuit of the masked man and turning towards the grey-robed man.</p><p>The grey-robed man, meeting the giant snake's bell-like eyes, felt a chill run down his spine, his face paling with fright.</p><p>Fortunately, his master blocked the first blow. The grey-robed man whipped his poisonous whip, circling his body, and poured all his energy into his poison technique, forming a five-colored barrier just as the snake arrived.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The barrier shattered.</p><p>The grey-robed man fared even worse, groaning as he and his treasure were sent flying, spitting blood, his complexion pale and weak.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, fixed on a point in the void.</p><p>The disturbances from the battle had finally revealed the presence of the five-colored poisonous spider hidden in the miasma.</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision. The giant snake changed direction again, charging straight towards the spider.</p><p>Seeing this, the grey-robed man was about to breathe a sigh of relief when his face was contorted with horror once more.</p><p>The five-colored poisonous spider was a venomous beast cultivated with his lifelong efforts. His cultivation was forcibly enhanced by his master using a secret technique, and afterward, he focused on assisting his master in refining the Venom King, with little time for other abilities or treasures.  Against ordinary Yuan Ying cultivators it was fine, but against Qin Sang, who could counter his poison technique, he was helpless, possessing only superficial power.</p><p>If the five-colored poisonous spider were killed, he would be effectively crippled.</p><p>Qin Sang, based on the grey-robed man's actions, recognized this weakness, and judging the opponent was using the spider to track him, he decisively switched his target.</p><p>In his terror, the grey-robed man hastily bit his tongue, spitting out a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>The blood mist mingled with the miasma.  Within the miasma, countless transparent threads appeared, each connecting to the five-colored spider at one end, the other stretching towards an unknown distance.  Before appearing, these threads were intangible, extensions of the spider's power, forming an invisible net; it was with them that it monitored Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as the giant snake was about to devour the spider, the spider embraced itself with its eight legs, its body glowing with a glazed luster, transforming into a ball of venom which instantly melted into the threads.</p><p>The next instant, a thread vibrated; the venom coalesced at the other end, and the five-colored spider reformed there.  The giant snake lunged at the spot where the spider had been, missing completely.</p><p>The grey-robed man breathed a sigh of relief, about to rush over to seize it, when a puff of white energy appeared before him – a large ethereal hand grasping the five-colored spider first.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as the ethereal hand was about to retract, a strong wind struck.  The masked man, having retrieved his wooden bead at some point, launched a direct attack.</p><p>This was an enraged strike from the masked man. It lacked the imposing scale of the *Sen Luo Ku Yu*, but the wooden bead's inherent power was almost as strong. The ethereal hand trembled, showing signs of disintegration.</p><p>Fortunately, the giant snake arrived in time, leaping between the ethereal hand and the wooden bead, directly receiving the blow.</p><p>With a ‘bang’, the giant snake was knocked down, but outwardly showed no injuries, circling Qin Sang, lively and active.  The five-colored poisonous spider was firmly in Qin Sang's hand, sealed within ice.</p><p>Qin Sang played with the ice, looking up at his opponents, his face calm.  One stood tall, the other low; they faced each other across the distance.</p><p>“Spiritual treasure!”</p><p>The masked man took a deep breath, restraining his anxious disciple, repeatedly exclaiming,  “Truly, the age of chaos is upon us, with even spiritual treasures emerging! I must see how long your true energy can last!”</p><p>Qin Sang smirked, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. “Why should I bother to fight you?”</p><p>Before his words finished, Qin Sang suddenly set down the *Zuo Nian Zhong*.</p><p>A resounding bell toll emanated from the bell, seeming to pass through countless mountains, distant and desolate.  Then, a green light erupted, transforming into a colossal green bell, enveloping Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing this, the masked man cried out inwardly.  The wooden bead and the wooden armor combined; the ancient tree phantom, along with countless vines, attempted to crush the green bell, only to be blocked by the giant snake once again.</p><p>In moments, amidst the chaos, the giant snake and the green bell disappeared into thin air.</p><p>The grey-robed man was frantic. Not only had he failed to obtain the Stone Toad, but he'd lost his venomous beast. He rushed down, only to find the masked man motionless.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>The grey-robed man cried out, but saw his master silent, merely looking down at his left hand.</p><p>He paused, then looked, gasping in shock.</p><p>No wonder his master's left hand had remained clenched, unused even with the jade insect armor.</p><p>In his left palm was a gaping wound; the jade insect was voraciously devouring flesh, bones already visible.  As if sensing the gaze, the insect raised its tiny head, its eyes gleaming with bloodlust.</p><p>A green glow covered the jade insect; the masked man was desperately suppressing it, but to little effect.</p><p>“Indeed, it's an evil thing. Before reaching its peak, it's prone to backfire. I never expected that even I would almost be unable to contain it. In my excitement, using this to kill my enemy, I was rather reckless.”</p><p>The masked man sighed.</p>
