<h1>Chapter 1194: The Corpse Ghost Immortal</h1><p>Chapter 1194: The Corpse Ghost Immortal</p><p>Hearing about the earth-sha spirit energy, Qin Sang knew Tan Hao had found the right person. He had seen many corpse refinement techniques, but the use of earth-sha spirit energy for corpse refinement, as seen in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, was unique and the most obvious characteristic.</p><p>“Since he’s a cultivator outside the established sects, it seems the Sky Corpse Sect’s legacy in the Abyss of Sin is probably broken. That person likely discovered a Sky Corpse Sect ruin somewhere, just like me, and obtained the secret technique…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. This wasn’t unexpected.  He had used the Two Realms Alliance's channels to gather information on sects in the Abyss of Sin, but hadn’t found any connected to the Sky Corpse Sect. Tan Hao was lucky to encounter this.</p><p>“What else did you find out?” Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>“The captured individuals knew little about him, only that his name was Corpse Ghost Immortal, and that he was already a Golden Core cultivator when he appeared near Near Scar Mountain. As for his origins, nobody knew,”</p><p>Tong Jinshan recalled the scene, “Corpse Ghost Immortal's belongings were taken by Daoist Tan. He certainly investigated further afterward, but never mentioned it to us. I don't know what else he found.”</p><p>Corpse Ghost Immortal.  A mere Golden Core cultivator with such a grandiose title.</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed inwardly, “After Tan Hao left, did he ever send any news?”</p><p>“No.” Tong Jinshan sighed, “When he bid farewell to me, I guessed he might be going to the Abyss of Sin, and I tried hard to dissuade him. But he insisted on going, and has been lost to us ever since…”</p><p>Tan Yi'en's expression was gloomy. He knew his father had only recently reached the Golden Core stage. Although considered a great cultivator in the cultivation world, the Abyss of Sin was the enemy's lair.  With no news for so long, he feared the worst.</p><p>After asking a few more questions and finding they knew little more, Qin Sang rewarded them and had Tan Yi'en see Tong Jinshan off.</p><p>“Uncle Master…” Tan Yi'en returned, hesitant to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, “I will find a way about your father.  Your priority now is preparing for your Golden Core breakthrough. Even with the煞妖丹 (Sha Yao Dan), there's no guarantee of success. Stay in Sandie Pass for now. The experience of war will also temper you.”</p><p>He dismissed Pang Ji and Tan Yi'en.  Qin Sang returned to his quiet room and pondered the matter.</p><p>“Corpse Ghost Immortal, Near Scar Mountain… the information is still too scarce! A Golden Core cultivator outside established sects should have some reputation, but he’s been dead for so long. How many people remember a Golden Core cultivator from a hundred years ago? To find out this person’s identity, or to find Tan Hao, is like searching for a needle in a haystack.”</p><p>Sending junior disciples to the Abyss of Sin was tantamount to sending them to their deaths. Only Qin Sang could personally investigate, but there was no guarantee of success. The Abyss of Sin was a place where everyone was a soldier, with strange methods like the幽晶塔 (Youjing Tower). If he encountered a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss, he could likely ensure his own safety with his various abilities.  However, once his presence was revealed, it would be difficult to infiltrate again.</p><p>Qin Sang had little hope of finding Tan Hao. The lack of contact for so long basically confirmed the outcome.</p><p>The Tan brothers, Tan Jie and Tan Hao.  One willingly became a test subject for demonic arts to secure a lifeline for his brother.  The other, carrying his undead brother, searched tirelessly, his life’s purpose to awaken his brother.</p><p>Their brotherhood, dying for each other, was a fitting end. Even in the cruel world of cultivation, true affection shines brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, and decided to consult his senior sister, Qing Jun.</p><p>A few days later.</p><p>After discussing with Senior Sister Qing Jun, Qin Sang received a topographical map she had personally drawn during her travels in the Abyss of Sin, recording her routes and observations.</p><p>Qing Jun reminded him that the Abyss of Sin hadn’t yet gone to war at that time, so the situation was completely different from now. Most of the information she had collected was outdated.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang didn’t have Qing Jun's abilities. Her disguise technique came from her insights into puppetry, and could only be used on herself.  She couldn't help Qin Sang with that.</p><p>“Most of the Abyss of Sin's strong cultivators are concentrated here. Leaving now to infiltrate would minimize the chance of being discovered. However, the Ebony Sword will devour its fill within a few months. Waiting a little longer wouldn't hurt. Then, with the Ebony Sword and the Seven Souls Killing Formation, if I encounter a Nascent Soul cultivator, I might even be able to kill them and prevent the news from leaking…”</p><p>Qin Sang had decided to personally investigate the Abyss of Sin.  The Sky Corpse Sect’s corpse refinement techniques were unique and fast, something Qin Sang had benefited from before.  Finding their legacy might allow him to further his knowledge in the corpse path.</p><p>His advancement to the next level was still far off. Even if he could gain insights from the Corpse Soul Pearl, there was no guarantee he could use them on Ya Gu.</p><p>As for Qin Sang’s agreement with the Two Realms Alliance, killing a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss of Sin would be enough repayment for the Golden Sinking Wood.  Leaving them now wouldn't cause any problems.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang spent his time studying the Seven Souls Killing Formation in preparation for his upcoming journey, while simultaneously gathering as much information about the Abyss of Sin as possible.  Two months passed unnoticed.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was cultivating in his secluded chamber, a streak of light suddenly flew in.  He caught the light and, upon examining its contents, was somewhat surprised.</p><p>"A visit from the Serpent King?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment before personally going outside to greet him.</p><p>"Long time no see, my esteemed friend.  How have you been?"</p><p>The Serpent King smiled and bowed slightly, his tone laced with a hint of teasing.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled in response.  A month prior, Bai He and Yue'er had held their wedding ceremony in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.  Although Qin Sang hadn't been able to attend, he had maintained contact with the Serpent King, even sending a gift with Fat Chicken.  According to Fat Chicken, Yue'er was now inseparable from Bai He, and Bai He had become incredibly docile.</p><p>"A perfect match!" Qin Sang exclaimed, welcoming his guest warmly.</p><p>Back in the secluded chamber, seated opposite each other, the Serpent King surveyed the rather sparse furnishings, remarking, "It's this simple life, this dedication to cultivation, that has allowed you to achieve such greatness, isn't it?  Qian Ji still hasn't accepted defeat, but it's clear now that you showed mercy.  He used all his abilities, yet you only summoned nine of your Twelve Demon Banners; you didn't even use your ultimate technique…"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he couldn't hide the Demon Banners or the *Yi Lei* technique.  They clearly misunderstood, mistaking the *Yi Lei* technique for his ultimate ability. He simply acknowledged their words with a few humble remarks, then asked about the Serpent King's reason for visiting.</p><p>The Serpent King turned serious.  "I won't beat around the bush.  Qian Ji and I have been insistent on obtaining your spirit insects because we suspect they are Sky-Eyed Butterflies, and we want to use them to break an ancient seal and explore a cave suspected to be the lair of an ancient great demon.  Qian Ji lost the bet, so we won't mention the insects any further.  Would you have the time to accompany us on this journey a few months from now?"</p><p>The Serpent King stated his purpose clearly and concisely.</p><p>"An ancient great demon's lair?" Qin Sang was taken aback.  "I wonder where this cave is located?"</p><p>He suddenly realized that the Sky-Eyed Butterflies, having advanced in power, had stronger seal-breaking abilities than before.  That explained the Serpent King's persistence.</p><p>"The Abyss of Sin."</p><p>"The Abyss of Sin's territory is no smaller than the Sky-Walk Highlands…"</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head slightly and said in a low voice, "It's not just anywhere.  It's the very source of the name, the chasm that runs through most of the Abyss of Sin. The cave is deep within the Abyss!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Last night I tidied up the storage area in my apartment building. Things are back to normal now, and I finally have my freedom back.</p><p>I wrote this chapter early this morning. I'll catch up on yesterday's later today.</p><p>I'll try my best to catch up on the overdue chapters in the next few days.</p>
