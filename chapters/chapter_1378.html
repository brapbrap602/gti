<h1></h1><p>"Her nascent soul seems to be merging with the light; this should not be a bad thing…"</p><p>Qin Sang's face revealed a hopeful expression.</p><p>Since he issued a reward in the Northern Chen Alliance, he had received many leads over the past three years. Li Yufu and other disciples traveled everywhere to investigate, and Qin Sang had even emerged from seclusion once for this purpose.</p><p>But the results were not what he was looking for.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang took out other items from the Thousand Jun Ring and sifted through them, considering what preparations he still needed to make before his departure.</p><p>After thinking for a while, he took out the Jin Chen Sword again.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword was still a top-grade magical artifact.</p><p>He had exhausted most of his savings in order to refine the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>The last time he promised Master Cang Hong, he obtained several precious spiritual objects. Some had already been refined into other items, and a portion of them were reserved for the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had long had a plan in mind. He went to the fire chamber and began to reforge the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of it, his expression as usual.</p><p>"It's a pity, it still lacks some refinement! Extreme-grade magical artifacts are indeed not so easy to refine. I have the Eighteen Demon Banners on hand, so there's no rush. It's enough to be able to cast the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. It won't hurt to travel around and collect spiritual objects later…"</p><p>Although he did not succeed, Qin Sang was not discouraged.</p><p>With all preparations complete, he was not going to delay any longer. He shot a streak of light outwards.</p><p>The White Cat received the order, turned around, and left the valley to transmit the message back to the Qingyang Temple and the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Li Yufu happened to be in the sect, while Shangguan Lifeng and others were all traveling outside.</p><p>Before long, Li Yufu and Tan Yi'en arrived at Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang gave them a few instructions.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had already discussed it carefully with Jing Yu, and there was no need to wait for her any longer.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang floated out of the valley.</p><p>Li Yufu, Tan Yi'en, and the White Cat stood respectfully in front of Peach Blossom Valley, waiting until Qin Sang's figure had disappeared for a long time before straightening up, all with faces full of reluctance.</p><p>The White Cat guarded Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Li Yufu and Tan Yi'en returned to Qingyang Temple to make arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled alone on this trip, without even bringing the Little Demon, and had only the nascent soul talisman puppet by his side.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left.</p><p>Ambiguous news spread throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>Some said that Qin Sang continued to cultivate in seclusion in Peach Blossom Valley, preparing to break through to the late stage of the nascent soul in one fell swoop and shock the world; others said that Qin Sang had gone out to travel, searching hard for the guidance platform (summoning altar) in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield…</p><p>Having shone brightly in the Three Realms War and breaking through to the mid-stage of the nascent soul at a shocking speed, Qin Sang had become a legendary figure in the Northern Chen Domain.</p><p>His legend was widely circulated in various domains and was talked about with relish.</p><p>In the minds of these people, Qin Sang's attainment of the Great Cultivator stage was a certainty, only a matter of time. Some were even bored enough to bet on whether Qin Sang could break through to the legendary God Transformation stage.</p><p>However, even if that day really came, the people participating in the betting would have turned to dust, and the bets could not be redeemed.</p><p>Other nascent souls were wary of Qin Sang's strength.</p><p>What's more, there was Jing Yu in the mid-stage of Transformation watching over him.</p><p>Therefore, even if Qin Sang had not appeared for a long time, no forces dared to provoke the Qingyang Temple. The Qingyang Temple dominated the northern shore of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, and became increasingly prosperous.</p><p>…</p><p>The southern sea area of the Northern Chen Domain.</p><p>The sea breeze was gentle, and the water surface was calm.</p><p>Qin Sang casually cast a concealment spell, traveled by sword, and did not deliberately speed up.</p><p>After flying for a while.</p><p>Without knowing how far he had flown, he clearly felt that the wind and waves had become stronger here.</p><p>The further he flew, the fiercer the wind and waves became.</p><p>'Rumbling...'</p><p>The sea waves towered into the sky, never stopping for a moment.</p><p>The strong wind howled, and thunder rumbled.</p><p>Having spent more than a hundred years in the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang was very familiar with this kind of scene. Such a big wind and wave must be affected by the storm belt, indicating that he was close to the storm belt.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>In less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the storm belt came into view.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure stopped, his sight shifted, looking at the sky-covering, sun-shading, iron-curtain-like storm belt in front. As expected, the scene here was no different from the storm belt around the Canglang Sea.</p><p>After entering the storm belt, going straight south will allow one to pass through the storm belt and enter the Northern Sea Three Realms.</p><p>But that is easier said than done.</p><p>The storm belt is full of dangers, and it is impossible to let you fly smoothly. Once you are careless and lose your way, you will never be able to get out of the storm belt.</p><p>And this kind of thing is very likely to happen.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn in advance.</p><p>He remembered that Yuan Zhu said that the demon race experts in the Demon Sea had once entered the storm belt with the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, trying to find the Canglang Sea and change the situation of only being able to be beaten.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's cultivation was not enough, and he was not sure whether the effect of the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn would weaken or become blurred if he entered the storm belt too deep, so he just reminded Qin Sang to be careful.</p><p>Thinking about it, the distance between the Northern Sea Three Realms and the Northern Chen Domain should not be too far, and the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn should not fail.</p><p>The storm belt is boundless, without a definite safe road. It is the same no matter where you enter.</p><p>On this road, unless one is lucky enough to encounter an ancient cultivator's residence that has not been destroyed, there is no place for him to adjust his breath and recover. He must rush out in one breath.</p><p>Especially in the second half of the journey, the true essence is consumed severely, and there is no way back. He can only rush forward, and the pressure is extremely high.</p><p>These are the main two reasons why even nascent soul cultivators dare not cross the storm belt at will.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of Chen Yan.</p><p>When she left the Northern Chen Domain, her cultivation was only in the early stage of nascent soul.</p><p>Thinking about it, either she had some kind of auxiliary treasure, or she knew a secret path that no one else knew. Her master was a Great Cultivator, and may have left her something.</p><p>True essence was poured in.</p><p>The Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn emitted a soft light, and a mysterious sense guided Qin Sang's direction.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn tightly, casually found a place, and rushed into the storm!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A gray hurricane struck.</p><p>When he was in the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang had gone deep into the storm belt to avoid the old demon Mou. It is even more difficult to stop him now.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure fluttered, calmly dodged, and shot forward.</p><p>The storm is boundless.</p><p>There are no living things here, no stars and no end in sight, which is extremely depressing.</p><p>A lonely figure, without turning his head, bravely moved forward in the storm.</p><p>…</p><p>Northern Sea Three Realms.</p><p>A vast sea area.</p><p>The sea surface is not calm.</p><p>However, there are no clouds for tens of thousands of miles here, and it doesn't look like there will be a storm.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap came from the distance.</p><p>The thunder was earth-shattering.</p><p>A cyan light flew from the north, like a cyan rainbow, its speed as fast as lightning, speeding through the air, turning into a speck of light in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After the cyan light flew past, there were two escape lights, one red and one black, chasing closely after the cyan light, their aura as powerful as the cyan light.</p><p>Demon Qi was shocking!</p><p>The ones chasing the cyan light were actually both Transformation stage Great Demons, and they had already revealed their demon bodies!</p><p>The main body of the red escape light was a one-legged divine bird, with a head like a sarcoma, ugly and unbearable. From the outside, it was impossible to tell what bloodline it was, but its whole body exuded a red blood energy, with a fishy and foul smell.</p><p>The feathers of the one-legged divine bird seemed to have not originally been red, but were stained red by the blood energy.</p><p>The one-legged divine bird was slender, with its wings spread out, reaching a hundred zhang long, like a bloody cloud. Its aura was not inferior to the escape light in front!</p><p>In its triangular demon eyes, a bloodthirsty and excited look was revealed, firmly locking onto the direction in which the cyan light was fleeing!</p>
