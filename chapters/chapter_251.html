**Chapter 244**

With a dark red body, its seemingly small stature belies an explosive power.

The Infernal Centipede trembled in Qin Sang’s palm, clearly sensing the fearsome aura of the flying monkeys.

The flying monkeys that lurked here were not only colored differently but also far more powerful than those found in the trial grounds. The two were not in the same league.

Qin Sang suspected that even a Nascent Soul cultivator venturing into the Magma Lake would have a difficult time.

Luckily, these creatures seemed to be bound by some unknown force, remaining confined to the lake without attempting to escape.

In Qin Sang’s view, the lake before him was like a potential bomb. If the infernal flying monkeys were allowed to charge out and unleash their carnage, half of those who had entered the ancient cultivator’s estate would perish.

Qin Sang concealed his aura with all his might, afraid that the flying monkeys would detect even the slightest trace of his presence. He cautiously observed the vines at the lake’s heart.

He had never seen these vines before. Among the ancient texts he had read at the Pagoda Peak, there were several similar Firebathed Immortal Vines, but none seemed to match their description.

The most peculiar aspect was the vine’s golden fruit, shaped like a Bodhi Seed, with a glimmering, translucent surface that hinted at its strange nature. The liquid within did not resemble any kind of fruit pulp.

It emitted no fragrant aroma or mind-clearing medicinal effects.

Qin Sang found it difficult to discern whether it was a spirit fruit at all.

After much contemplation, Qin Sang failed to recall anything like it from his memories. However, considering its location within the hidden courtyard, it was certainly not ordinary.

Unfortunately, Qin Sang lacked the strength to claim the golden fruit while under the watchful eyes of the flying monkeys.

He would have to wait until he advanced to the late Foundation Establishment stage to attempt it. If that proved insufficient, only the Nascent Soul stage would suffice.

However, there might be a way to bypass the flying monkeys’ senses and pilfer the fruit. But such a plan would require careful preparation, which was out of the question for now.

With a sigh, Qin Sang chose to leave the fruit behind for now.

He decided against taking any further action to conceal the courtyard. The ancient immortal estate was now under the control of Xuanluan Pass. There would be waves of cultivators coming to explore and search for treasures. Any unusual actions would only draw suspicion and reveal the courtyard’s secrets. It was better to let the dilapidated courtyard remain exposed for all eyes to see.

As for informing his sect and asking Martial Uncle Che to intervene?

After some thought, Qin Sang shook his head. He glanced at the golden fruit, committing its shape to memory. He would investigate its origins and uses once he returned to the sect.

With no one having discovered the ancient well’s existence, there was no need to worry about someone uncovering the courtyard’s secrets.

The Infernal Centipede’s ability to detect spirit objects allowed it to ignore the illusion formation and find a path through it. Such a rare creature was unlikely to be encountered a second time.

With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang retracted his neck and slowly made his way back to the stone steps.

As he turned to leave, a wave of unease surged through him. He frowned at the Magma Lake, the flying monkeys appearing undisturbed…

A moment later, Qin Sang’s expression drastically changed. He spun around, staring fixedly at a certain point on the stone steps behind him.

Someone was there!

Their strength was terrifying, completely evading his senses!

They did not know how long they had been following him, as Qin Sang detected no changes. But now that he had noticed them, it was likely by their design.

His hand swiftly reached for his mustard seed bag, but before he could retrieve the Profound Yin Thunderclap, he found himself unable to move.

Starting from his hand, his arms, upper body, legs…

Without revealing themselves, his entire body was frozen like a statue. Only his head remained mobile. Though his physical body was imprisoned, his primordial spirit remained free, and the Ebonywood Sword was not affected. But Qin Sang chose not to expose it.

Qin Sang’s heart sank.

The air was abnormally hot, but he felt a chill throughout his body!

Suddenly, a figure slowly emerged in Qin Sang’s line of sight. Seeing the person’s missing leg, Qin Sang felt a profound bitterness in his mouth.

No wonder they could effortlessly evade his senses.

No wonder he could not resist.

It's him!

This man is one of the five Congenital Warriors that entered the Ruins of Ancient Cultivators, Elder Dique!

"Qin Sang greets Sir…"

Qin Sang's lips twitched as he spoke with a raspy voice, "Sorry, Senior. Due to my body's condition, I can't bow. Please, don't blame me…"

Qin Sang never thought Elder Dique would not explore the four Heavenly Peaks but instead appear here.

This was a blessing in disguise compared to the unknown powers in the Ruins.

However, Qin Sang was uneasy because he didn't know why Elder Dique was following him or since when he had been on his tail.

Qin Sang had only met Elder Dique outside the Ruins of Ancient Cultivators. He had seldom left the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm in the last 20 years, except for some missions. So it would be very unlikely to have offended Elder Dique.

Moreover, he did not kill any of Elder Dique's disciples.

Qin Sang racked his brain, but to no avail.

Unexpectedly, Elder Dique ignored Qin Sang and looked at something on Qin Sang's other hand. He then reached out and made a gentle gesture with his hand, causing the Fire Jade Centipede to break free from Qin Sang's restraints and fly into Elder Dique's palm.

Elder Dique also had a centipede in his hand, which was blood-red in color but had a thin, dark-gold line on its back. This centipede was also larger than Qin Sang's Fire Jade Centipede, making it look much more imposing.

The two centipedes reunited and immediately began to intertwine. The gold-backed centipede easily subdued Qin Sang's Fire Jade Centipede.

Qin Sang's eyes widened. He realized why Elder Dique had found him.

He had previously read that the Fire Jade Centipede had distinct male and female genders and that the differences in their appearance were significant. One of the most noticeable differences would be on their backs. The female Fire Jade Centipede would have a thin, dark-gold line on its back.

Qin Sang's centipede was male, while the one in Elder Dique's hand was female.

Just as the Fire Jade Centipede could detect spiritual objects, it could also sense each other when they were of opposite genders. However, Qin Sang did not find anything unusual about his Fire Jade Centipede. It was likely that Elder Dique had intercepted their connection.

How could this be a coincidence?

Were both centipedes his?

Just as Qin Sang's mind raced as he tried to find a way to escape, Elder Dique lovingly stroked the two centipedes, looked up, and said to Qin Sang with a smile, "Thank you for your help, young man. I have finally found this little fellow. Before now, I thought the little guy had been killed by a cruel cloud beast. It pained me every time I thought about it."

"My apologies, Sir," Qin Sang said in a hoarse voice. "I picked up this centipede by accident. I didn't know Sir had dropped it in the cave…"
