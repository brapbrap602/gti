<h1>Chapter 689: The Command Thunder Talisman</h1><p>A spirit insect clamped down on the ebony sword, its fangs gnawing at the blade.  Whirlpool-like, strange energy surged from its mouth.  With a series of grating *screech* sounds, the sword light shattered, the fragments seemingly absorbed by the insect's fangs.</p><p>The ebony sword struggled free, its body unharmed.</p><p>"Third-stage insect Gu?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished and suspicious.  This young man was a member of the Witch Clan.</p><p>There were Witch Clan cultivators on Duyan Island, but far fewer than human cultivators; after all, the island lord was a human Yuan Ying stage cultivator. These Witch Clan cultivators were always low-key, maintaining amicable relations with the human cultivators. When did they become so brazen?</p><p>This spirit insect was a Devouring Yuan Insect, ranking among the top hundred on the Witch Insect List. This person not only had inner armor but also such a high-ranking life-bound insect Gu!</p><p>The ebony sword had difficulty suppressing a third-stage life-bound insect Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang decisively withdrew his spirit sword, taking out the Black Water Mirror from his storage ring. He raised his hand, and the mirror spun out, its surface facing the black-robed youth.</p><p>Within the dark mirror's surface, an extremely deep space seemed to exist. Amidst the deafening roar of the waves, the spirit water sealed within the artifact gushed out, coalescing into a ferocious black dragon that lunged towards the black-robed youth.</p><p>But at that moment, Qin Sang noticed a change in the young man's expression. His gaze sharpened, fixated on the black-robed youth's right hand where a silver light flickered—a talisman!</p><p>The instant he saw the silver light, Qin Sang felt a sudden, ominous premonition.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang had discovered his action, the black-robed youth no longer concealed his move. He swung his palm at Qin Sang, sneering, "Die!"</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A glittering silver talisman shattered before Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, every hair on Qin Sang's body stood on end; he felt an overwhelming sense of impending doom.</p><p>Above his head, in a sky that had been clear moments before, a dark cloud appeared.  It was this cloud that instilled such a terrifying feeling in him.</p><p>Terrified, Qin Sang didn't even dare to lift his head. His actions were faster than his thoughts; he tossed the Black Water Mirror, originally aimed at the black-robed youth, upwards, then plunged his mind into his Dantian, unhesitatingly activating the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>*"Roar!"*</p><p>A small, exquisite image of a dragon appeared above Qin Sang's head before diving down and merging into his body.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson light shield appeared around Qin Sang, the dragon soul circling within, majestic and imposing. He transformed into a streak of light, a mix of silver and red, instantly shifting several meters.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang escaped, an extremely thin bolt of lightning descended from the heavens, striking the Black Water Mirror, destroying the artifact and continuing downwards, piercing Qin Sang's afterimage as it whizzed past.</p><p>The lightning missed Qin Sang and struck the sea.</p><p>With a deafening *boom*, the terrifying power of the lightning exploded, blasting a deep pit nearly ten meters in diameter in the ocean.  Silver light scattered like fish.</p><p>Only after the power dissipated did the seawater slowly close.</p><p>Qin Sang broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>If it weren't for the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and the sword-energy thunder sound, if the Black Water Mirror hadn't provided a moment's respite...</p><p>Even a fraction of a second slower, and he would have been struck by the lightning—certain death!  Qin Sang estimated that even a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator struck by such lightning would be severely injured at the very least.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grim, his gaze fixed on the black-robed youth, filled with intense killing intent.</p><p>The power of this thunder talisman was terrifying; in a battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators, it could be decisive.</p><p>If he hadn't had so many escape techniques, if he hadn't been so alert, if he had underestimated the black-robed youth even slightly... he would have been defeated.</p><p>"The Command Thunder Talisman couldn't kill you?"</p><p>The black-robed youth was astonished, clearly surprised by Qin Sang's incredible speed, that he had dodged such a fatal blow.</p><p>Then, the black-robed youth saw Qin Sang summon three demonic banners—clearly powerful artifacts—and finally displayed a look of panic.</p><p>Qin Sang was shaken, but the black-robed youth was even more dejected.</p><p>This Command Thunder Talisman was a life-saving talisman given to him by his master.  Used unexpectedly, it could even kill late-stage Foundation Establishment experts, yet it had been dodged.  Furthermore, the artifacts Qin Sang produced sent shivers down his spine. This person's cultivation was not high, but his treasures were astonishingly numerous. The black-robed youth regretted provoking such a formidable opponent.</p><p>He frantically urged his spirit insect to attack Qin Sang, then reached for his pouch, seemingly intending to retrieve something.  Suddenly, however, he felt a fierce gust of wind from behind.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner was merely a diversion.</p><p>The flying night raksha, having submerged in the deep sea, seized its opportunity as the young man in black robes was distracted by the talisman and Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man in black robes only glimpsed a dark shadow before being struck in the back by the night raksha's claw.  </p><p>Despite his protective armor, the immense force pierced his body, instantly inflicting grievous wounds.  He cried out in agony, flung backward by the impact.</p><p>Sensing its master's danger, his spirit insect wailed and flew back to his aid.  But Qin Sang was faster, and he and the night raksha attacked the young man from both sides.</p><p>Just then, a red streak appeared in the distance, a figure rapidly approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. This was likely an accomplice, and although only one person, the power of their magical flight suggested at least mid-stage Core Formation cultivation—a formidable opponent given his depleted Blood-Soiled Divine Light.</p><p>Furthermore, the young man in black robes possessed several valuable treasures, indicating high standing within the Witch Clan; he was unlikely to be alone.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had originally planned to capture the young man alive and interrogate him through soul-searching, changed his mind, ordering the night raksha to kill him.</p><p>The severely wounded man was virtually defenseless.  He barely dodged one strike before a ghostly claw pierced his skull, killing him instantly.</p><p>His spirit insect, bound to his life force, perished the moment its master died.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was cold and resolute.  He retracted the night raksha, calmly retrieving the young man's pouch and the almost-destroyed armor. Then, using talismans, sword energy, and thunder, he fled the scene.  </p><p>Before leaving, he even had time to incinerate the body.</p><p>He chose not to return to Duyan Island, but instead fled in the opposite direction.  Something had occurred at Duyan Island, and he preferred not to become involved until he understood what.  Other directions might hold more of the young man's accomplices; returning to the Fuhu Sea was the safest option.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang had killed the young man, his accomplice arrived.</p><p>Witnessing his companion's incineration, the man's eyes blazed with fury; he pursued Qin Sang relentlessly.  His escape techniques were far inferior, however, and the distance between them rapidly widened.</p><p>Soon, he lost sight of Qin Sang completely.</p><p>On the vast ocean, Qin Sang vanished without a trace.</p>
