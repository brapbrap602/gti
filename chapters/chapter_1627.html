<h1>Chapter 1618: The Yin Demon Nail</h1><p>Chapter 1618: The Yin Demon Nail</p><p>Outside the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>Numerous cultivators displayed their various abilities, navigating the passage. Qin Sang, accompanied by his avatar, initially had to be wary of his rear, guarding against any pursuers.  Once he was sure no one was following, he focused on overcoming the obstacles ahead.</p><p>Whether it was individual restrictive formations or energy turbulence, with Qin Sang's current cultivation, he had ways to deal with them.  However, these adverse conditions were intertwined here in extreme chaos, requiring significant effort from Qin Sang.  A cultivator with slightly weaker cultivation would have been overwhelmed; the combined efforts of Old Ghost Chou and the others were to be expected.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A gust of wind struck him head-on.</p><p>Qin Sang only caught a glimpse of a crimson sword shadow in his peripheral vision.</p><p>The sword energy was sharp; Qin Sang felt a dull ache in his brow.  However, before the sword approached, the Sky Eye Butterfly had already detected it and given warning.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly saw clearly that the sword wasn't real, but a sword energy illusion, a fabricated phantom. Yet its destructive power was no different from that of a genuine treasure sword.</p><p>Strangely, although it was a phantom image, the sword was broken, only half its length remained.</p><p>Could a phantom sword break?</p><p>Only one explanation: the spirit or restriction array that created the phantom sword was damaged.  No wonder Qin Sang encountered such disorder upon entering.</p><p>“Back then, not only were the two southern barbarian states ravaged, but the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate's mountain gate surely didn't escape unscathed.  But I wonder, was the mountain gate damaged by the demonic chaos itself, or by the conflict among human cultivators after the chaos ended…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this as the sword approached, calmly wielding his sword to strike left and forward.</p><p>In front of him to the left, a vibrant green light shone, representing life. Within the green light was a dense forest, ancient trees and lush green leaves, a captivating sight.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was only a dozen or so ancient trees; the rest were their branches.</p><p>In a place rich with spiritual energy, vegetation thrives. These ancient trees were not uncommon; using them to set up hidden traps is often highly effective.</p><p>But in this environment, they were too conspicuous. Ordinary trees could never have survived to this day.  It was obviously a remnant array.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword pierced towards the thickest tree.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, before the Jin Chen Sword could strike the trunk, just as it approached within a hundred meters of the ancient tree, the tree suddenly changed, coming alive!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Blinding green light erupted as countless vines shot out from the tree, like its hair wildly thrashing about, clawing and snapping at the Jin Chen Sword, instantly wrapping it up.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang didn't withdraw his sword. His external avatar sheathed its blade and retreated behind his main body.</p><p>‘Creak! Creak!’</p><p>The vines possessed tremendous strength, fiercely tearing at the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but worry that if he didn't quickly retrieve the Jin Chen Sword, the magic weapon might be torn to shreds.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't need to confront the tree directly.</p><p>The instant the ancient tree trapped the Jin Chen Sword, the phantom sword arrived, striking the vines precisely, exactly as Qin Sang had calculated!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Within the green light emanating from the vines, a point of crimson light suddenly exploded. The power of the phantom sword was like a surging inferno, engulfing countless vines and rolling forward.</p><p>The crimson light, like fire, incinerated the vines with devastating speed.</p><p>The vines were an extension of the ancient tree's power.  Feeling the attack, the tree immediately retaliated, its body swaying; the entire forest began to wildly grow.</p><p>All the tree trunks extended, twisting to an extreme degree, their original shapes unrecognizable.  A green tide surged, as if determined to extinguish the sword's flames.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't wait to see the outcome of the clash between the two forces.  He took advantage of the chaos to retrieve the Jin Chen Sword, then flashed through a gap.</p><p>The clash between the phantom sword and the ancient tree's restriction didn't affect Qin Sang's approach.</p><p>Qin Sang easily overcame this obstacle.</p><p>By using early warnings and his ability to quickly analyze restrictions, Qin Sang frequently employed this method of borrowing strength to achieve leverage; a small force moving a large one.</p><p>Throughout his journey, the Sky Eye Butterfly provided immense assistance.</p><p>Although not as fast as Zhu Wu Dao and others who relied on their altar, or the speed of Zi Lei Zhenren and others who combined their efforts to form an array, his speed was still quite fast.</p><p>Despite this, after entering the passage, Qin Sang hadn't encountered anyone who had gone in before him.  He wondered if others possessed treasure or abilities that allowed them to travel faster, or if the area was too vast and he had inadvertently missed them.</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed that the passage's spatial dimensions defied common sense, clearly the result of formations and restrictions. Unexpected events could occur, leading one astray unknowingly.  Furthermore, the passage was ever-changing; even following the same route, each person's experience differed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tianmu Die exerted themselves fully, striving not to become lost.  Otherwise, even escaping, they would fall far behind, missing exploration opportunities.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Having just passed beyond the influence of the ancient tree's restriction, Qin Sang sensed something unusual and abruptly stopped. He looked around.</p><p>He found himself suspended in the void, surrounded by endless darkness, with chaotic currents streaking through like meteors.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense and Tianmu's vision together, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then suddenly realized, "It's an illusionary array!"</p><p>This was the kind of array he feared least, especially since the formations and restrictions in the passage were incomplete.</p><p>Uniting his mind with Tianmu Die's, focusing his vision, Qin Sang easily located the array's flaw. Using his Golden Sinking Sword and Snow-Stepping Blade in coordination, he carved a path through the illusion.  The world instantly brightened, transitioning from darkness to daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, for he had entered an unknown sea of mist. The white fog stretched endlessly, with chaotic currents as the only constant feature.</p><p>The scene reminded Qin Sang of the common practice among cultivation sects—using white mist to seal off their mountains, isolating them from the mundane world.</p><p>"If it's a sealing mountain mist, we may be nearing the entrance to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect…"</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted, his speed increased. He skillfully handled various unexpected situations, proceeding without major incident.</p><p>However, after a time, he suddenly slowed, gazing ahead in astonishment.  An unusual outline appeared in the depths of the mist.</p><p>A long, white shadow stretched before him, extending to either side, its end unseen.  The shadow remained motionless, its nature unclear.</p><p>Qin Sang approached cautiously, using his Tianmu abilities to ascertain its identity.  The shadow turned out to be a dragon sculpted from cloud mist!</p><p>The cloud mist, utilized as a material, formed a solid cloud dragon, its scales and claws vividly lifelike.  It lay majestically before him like a celestial dragon.</p><p>There weren't one, but two cloud dragons. Their heads faced each other, their bodies winding to either side, their tails out of sight.</p><p>Between their heads was a cloud-formed plaza, where numerous stone pillars stood.  These thick pillars could accommodate over a hundred people, resembling fighting platforms.</p><p>Their original purpose was unknown, but now they were damaged and uneven, some reduced to mere bases. Only one remained relatively intact.</p><p>"People!"</p><p>Seeing the scene around the pillars, Qin Sang's expression tightened. He had finally caught up!</p><p>Figures flickered around the pillars.  These individuals stood or sat. The area between the dragon heads had significantly fewer chaotic currents, a rare calm spot within the passage.</p><p>Most were hurrying to recover their strength, but several were attacking the best-preserved pillar, emitting strange lights.</p><p>It appeared that the space between the two cloud dragons was the entrance to the sect.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the dragons, detecting no barriers on their bodies.  However, he wouldn't risk testing this; it was best to enter through the cloud plaza between their heads.</p><p>Focusing on the space between the dragon heads, he observed the people's attire.</p><p>"They seem to be from Bajinguan and Tayue Gate.  The Wuxiang Immortal Sect remnants have already gone inside.  Zilei Zhenren and Yue Liting aren't here; only these people are resting…"</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the distance, noting the absence of grand cultivators among them. Approaching further, he saw that the people were attacking a pillar where a spirit herb grew.</p><p>The herb grew in the pillar's cracks, looking twisted and unassuming; one might mistake it for a weed.</p><p>"Blue Cloud Grass!" Qin Sang was slightly stunned.</p><p>The herb was flowerless and fruitless, with bluish-green leaves slightly curled, bearing complex veins.  It was a rare herb from his memory, highly beneficial to cultivators of certain unique abilities!</p><p>The purplish-red base of the Blue Cloud Grass indicated its maturity—a top-tier specimen, three times more potent than others.</p><p>Its location suggested it hadn't been planted.  It had sprung up naturally during the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's period of dormancy, due to the abundant spiritual energy, finding protection within the pillar's restriction.</p><p>Zuwudao and Zilei Zhenren had noticed the Blue Cloud Grass, but didn't spend time collecting it.  These cultivators planned to obtain the herb during their rest.</p><p>Discovering such a treasure before even entering was unexpected.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect was truly an unexplored treasure trove. Even without considering the South Sea Immortal Palace behind it, the journey was worthwhile!</p><p>Lan Yuncao wasn't particularly useful to Qin Sang, so he withdrew his gaze, lost in thought, pondering how to get past the group of cultivators.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something. When the passage opened, a shadowy figure had entered before him. Where had that person gone?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He ordered his Sky-Eye Butterfly to carefully search the Cloud Vapor Plaza.  It found nothing nearby, but as Qin Sang subtly expanded the search area, a discovery was made!</p><p>In the clouds beyond the Cloud Vapor Plaza, a wisp of black smoke was visible.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to focus his vision to discern the smoke's true nature, he sensed something amiss.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the figure within the smoke was Fan Laomo.</p><p>Fan Laomo had tracked Qin Sang here but hadn't rushed in. He'd been searching for Lan Yuncao for years, as it aided his cultivation.</p><p>Two fists are no match for four hands. Even without Zi Lei Zhenren present, Fan Laomo dared not confront the two sects' experts alone.  He hid, planning to snatch the herb from the jaws of the lion.</p><p>To this end, Fan Laomo had secretly set up traps in the area.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before his elaborate preparations could be triggered, Qin Sang stumbled upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang's discovery was mutual.</p><p>The stone pillar restriction was about to break.</p><p>Fan Laomo was a decisive man.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Rather than meticulously plotting for the treasures inside, he'd secure the Lan Yuncao first.</p><p>Sensing another's arrival, he changed his plan without hesitation, launching a surprise attack to force Qin Sang's reveal. He intended to exploit the distraction while the cultivators were focused on Qin Sang, then rush into the Cloud Vapor Plaza, seize the herb, and escape!</p><p>Qin Sang's main body and external avatar were connected in mind.  </p><p>Sensing the anomaly, his external avatar instantly activated his power. His pupils turned icy white, and a visible beam of chilling light, radiating intense cold aura, shot downwards.</p><p>The newly refined Ice Soul Radiance was used against an enemy for the first time.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Before the light even arrived, the extreme cold began to spread.</p><p>Space distorted, revealing three dark points of light that darted towards Qin Sang's main body and avatar.</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance, though slower to launch, arrived first, instantly freezing that section of space.</p><p>Several cracking sounds echoed.  Inside the Ice Soul Radiance, several black, strange nails appeared.</p><p>The nails were thin, only about an inch long, and moved silently, making them incredibly hard to detect.</p><p>Now enveloped by the Ice Soul Radiance, the tips of the three nails trembled for a moment, before frost spread, completely freezing them.</p><p>Cracks appeared on the nails' surfaces; they shattered on the spot.</p><p>Fan Laomo was astonished.  He never expected this outcome.</p><p>These black nails were called Yin Demon Nails, each carrying a Yin Demon.  Once they pierced their target, they would inflict excruciating pain.  A famed treasure of Tian Hao Tower, they were feared by all.</p><p>He had used three, yet they were destroyed instantly!</p><p>Even more shocking to Fan Laomo was how quickly his position was revealed!</p><p>Qin Sang instantly guessed his opponent's intentions and was not polite. He ordered his avatar to block the nails while his main body flicked his sleeve, sending forth streams of black flames—Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire.</p><p>He didn't use his full power; this was more than enough.</p><p>The flames didn't directly attack Fan Laomo but targeted other locations.</p><p>They were still within the Unseen Immortal Sect's passage, as chaotic as the outside. Only the Cloud Vapor Plaza was relatively calm.</p><p>Qin Sang aimed at the restrictions and fragments of spirit arrays surrounding Fan Laomo's hiding spot.</p><p>A cracked stone tablet.</p><p>A river of crimson magma.</p><p>...</p><p>Various fragments of restrictions formed strange phenomena, the most noticeable being...</p><p>Seeing this, Fan Laomo knew he was in trouble. He hastily took out a yellow copper bowl.  With a *ding*, the bowl emitted waves of yellow light, enveloping him.</p><p>Fan Laomo dashed towards the exit.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire activated ancient restrictions.</p><p>For a moment, colorful lights flashed around Fan Laomo, quite a spectacle.</p><p>But this wasn't the biggest problem.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang had a better grasp of the situation, anticipating the trajectory of the chaotic currents and the path of several flying swords. He'd precisely calculated the order in which each restriction would be triggered.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Explosions echoed as Fan Laomo and his copper bowl were engulfed.  Furious, he cursed, "Damn it!"</p><p>The commotion attracted the attention of the cultivators in the Cloud Vapor Plaza.</p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p>The cultivators of the two sects shouted, stopping their cultivation and rushing to investigate.</p><p>Then, they heard the urgent sound of something breaking through the air behind them. Before they could react, a bolt of lightning tore through the clouds, crossed the Cloud Vapor Plaza, and charged into the Unseen Immortal Sect!</p>
