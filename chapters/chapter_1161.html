<h1>Chapter 1153: Forming the Nascent Soul </h1><p>Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his past, recalling the trials he had endured. Compared to his previous breakthroughs, forming his Nascent Soul this time seemed less arduous, almost as if it had come naturally. Yet, as he revisited each segment of his journey—the efforts he had made, the dangers he had faced—he realized that none of it had been simple.</p><p>The Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid.</p><p>This was a treasure Qin Sang had stolen from the Yuanzhao Sect during his Qi Refinement stage, when he was under the control of the Golden Core cultivator Yi Tiannie of the Ghost Yin Sect, who had used insect gu techniques to manipulate him. At the time, the orchid was still over five hundred years away from maturity, and Qin Sang had thought he would never live to see it bear fruit. However, Yi Tiannie had not truly perished. For decades, he had lain dormant within a corpse puppet, waiting for the moment Qin Sang unleashed the Void Heaven Thunder to strike. At that time, Qin Sang was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, but thanks to the corpse core he had refined within his body, he managed to turn the tables, killing Yi Tiannie and obtaining the precious Three Radiance Jade Nectar.</p><p>Later, he spent over a century adrift in the Canglang Sea, entering the Seven Slaughter Palace three times before finally locating a teleportation array. Returning to the Little Cold Domain, he used the Three Radiance Jade Nectar to accelerate the orchid's growth and sought the wandering alchemist Yunyouzi to refine the Tribulation Transcendence Pill for him.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>When the Seven Slaughter Palace emerged prematurely, the amount of spiritual liquid available was far less than usual, and the Nascent Soul cultivator Ye Zunzhe of the Eastern Pole Alliance was lurking nearby. Qin Sang, only at the mid-Golden Core stage, collaborated with Mingwei and struck a deal with Sunü, narrowly escaping with the Soul Cleansing Liquid under the watchful eyes of many. At Yitian Peak, he encountered a sudden anomaly and fled into a poisonous pool, nearly losing the liquid to the mute girl.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The life-bound insect gu was a secret technique of the Witch Clan. As a human, Qin Sang lacked the innate talent of the Witch Clan and had to sacrifice a life-bound magical treasure. If not for the Jade Buddha protecting him from the gu's potential backlash and the rare Crimson Fire Flowing Gold he possessed, Qin Sang would never have chosen this path, let alone dared to select the Heavenly Eye Butterfly as his life-bound insect gu. The process of obtaining the Crimson Fire Flowing Gold was fraught with peril—as a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, he had been used as a pawn by the crippled elder Di Que and nearly fell victim to the soul-seizing attempt of Daoist Xuan Yu. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly underwent a mutation, gaining the ability to control lightning, and only after devouring the essence blood of a Green Luan did it break through to its fourth transformation.</p><p>Body Refinement.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement," a demonic cultivation technique! The method was sealed within a bone flute, split into three parts and scattered across three immortal realms, all of which Qin Sang eventually gathered. Once again, it was the Jade Buddha that made it possible for him to cultivate this technique. He visualized the Green Luan, forcibly refining his body, and went to great lengths to seek breakthroughs. In the Canglang Sea, he infiltrated the Lantou Sect, and upon returning, he snuck into the treasure vault of a demon king at the Golden Core stage, stealing treasures right under the nose of a shape-shifting demon king.</p><p>Of course, the most crucial factor was the "Divine Sword Nurturing Chapter." The hardships of cultivating it need not be elaborated upon.</p><p>Having endured all of this, Qin Sang had finally reached this height! As he reflected on his journey, reliving the emotions of each moment, he immersed himself in the memories. Every obstacle, every narrow escape, every moment of triumph—his expression shifted from furrowed brows to clarity, then to joy, until finally, his emotions settled into a tranquil state, and boundless confidence welled up within him.</p><p>After overcoming countless trials, who else but him could form a Nascent Soul?</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The jade bottle opened on its own, and the Tribulation Transcendence Pill leaped out. A mist of spiritual energy enveloped Qin Sang, and he closed his eyes, swallowing the pill. A cool sensation exploded within him, and his true essence seemed to boil.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he focused on refining the pill's power and comprehending the Great Dao.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the island, Li Yufu and the others had been waiting for half a month. The island remained eerily calm. Knowing that haste was futile, they diligently guarded Qin Sang, patrolling the area at regular intervals to prevent any mishaps.</p><p>Several more days passed. After completing their patrol, they returned to Bai's side, their eyes filled with concern. Qin Sang had not sent any messages or shown himself, and they wondered if the time was not yet ripe.</p><p>"Senior..." Li Yufu began to ask, but Bai suddenly raised his head, staring intently toward the island.</p><p>In the next moment, Li Yufu and the three demons sensed the anomaly. A fierce wind arose, and towering waves surged. The once-calm lake surface was instantly thrown into chaos. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth grew restless, fluctuating violently before converging madly toward the island where Qin Sang was. The scene was identical to when Yunyouzi had undergone his tribulation.</p><p>"The Nascent Soul formation has begun!" Bai exclaimed with joy, quickly issuing orders. Li Yufu and the three demons scattered.</p><p>*Boom...*</p><p>The spiritual energy converged, becoming so dense that it formed a visible tide, swirling at the center of the storm and emitting low rumbles of thunder. As the spiritual energy underwent this transformation, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Though it was daytime, the heavens rapidly darkened, and true lightning began to flicker within the clouds.</p><p>As time passed, the phenomenon grew increasingly astonishing. The spiritual energy of the world was swept up, converging toward the storm's center, growing denser and denser until the light it emitted became blinding. Above the island, it seemed as though a sea of light had appeared.</p><p>Bai stared intently at the sea of light, his expression tense. He knew that the next step would be critical. Qin Sang must have already consumed the Tribulation Transcendence Pill. Success would mean the formation of the Nascent Soul; failure would mean waiting who knew how long for another opportunity.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>The sea of light swirled rapidly, its momentum growing, yet it refused to descend. Seeing this, Bai's expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>Suddenly, the sea of light underwent a drastic change. All the radiant light converged madly toward the center, compressing the spiritual energy to its limit. With a resonant hum, it shot straight down into the island!</p><p>In an instant, the sea of light dissipated, replaced by a multicolored glow. A rainbow of clouds appeared, stunningly beautiful—a sign that the Nascent Soul formation had succeeded!</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, rejoicing for Qin Sang, though their expressions also held a hint of envy and longing, hoping that they too might one day reach such heights.</p><p>However, the formation of the Nascent Soul was only the beginning. The phenomenon did not dissipate but instead intensified.</p><p>At the peak of the island, Qin Sang sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, his body trembling slightly. In the void around him, invisible yin flames appeared. The moment his Nascent Soul formed, the heavenly tribulation arrived. Yin flames ignited within his body, burning through his organs and limbs, enveloping him entirely. It felt as though his entire body was being reduced to ash.</p><p>This tribulation was not particularly difficult. Qin Sang, well-versed in body refinement, had no need to worry. Though his body trembled, he endured the burning in silence, his physical strength resisting the yin flames. The pain of the Green Luan's essence blood tearing through him had been no less intense, and Qin Sang had long grown accustomed to such suffering. In fact, he even used the opportunity to further refine his body, gaining significant benefits and advancing another layer in the "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement."</p><p>By the time the yin flame tribulation ended, Qin Sang had already consumed healing pills, and his condition quickly recovered. He even felt a sense of lingering satisfaction.</p><p>As the yin flames vanished, the yin winds appeared! Qin Sang's surroundings darkened abruptly, and gray yin winds gathered around him, growing denser by the moment. The same ordeal that Yunyouzi had faced was now repeating itself, and Qin Sang's heart sank.</p>
