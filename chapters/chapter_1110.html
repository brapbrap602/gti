<h1>Chapter 1102: Reunion</h1><p>The ancient cultivator's ruins were the closest to the Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>After a long journey, Qin Sang arrived near the ancient ruins and found the entrance.</p><p>A cracked stone stele stood amidst a ring of shattered rocks.</p><p>Despite enduring countless spiritual tides and celestial phenomena, the entrance to the ancient ruins had not been destroyed and had persisted until now.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that various sects had left protective restrictions here to safeguard the entrance. However, after some investigation, he confirmed that there were no cultivators stationed in the secret realm, and the surroundings were completely deserted.</p><p>Back when the cultivators of the Hanging Skull Pass had discovered the ancient ruins, they had found that the place had already been visited by demonic sects.</p><p>The remaining treasures had been scavenged by Che Yutao and others, and after a series of upheavals, they had been controlled by various major sects for who knows how many years, leaving almost nothing behind.</p><p>Moreover, unlike other secret realms, the ancient ruins were not peaceful. They were filled with dangerous fire spirits, and after the upheaval, the place had almost turned into a ruin, with extremely unstable space, making it unsuitable as a stronghold.</p><p>It was no surprise that the place had been abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly slipped into the ancient ruins.</p><p>His cultivation level was no longer what it used to be, and the restrictions he encountered were also different from before, likely due to the upheaval that had occurred. Qin Sang entered the ancient ruins without much effort.</p><p>A wave of scorching heat greeted him.</p><p>Lava surged, and everything before his eyes was a sea of crimson.</p><p>Apart from a few isolated mountain peaks resembling islands, the entire secret realm had turned into a sea of lava!</p><p>Looking deep into the secret realm, Qin Sang saw the shadow of the Heavenly Peak, completely surrounded by lava.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, the space there was extremely unstable, with dense spatial cracks around the Heavenly Peak, far more numerous than when they had fled years ago.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin桑 headed straight west, flying through the air toward the Heavenly Peak.</p><p>Below, lava surged, occasionally erupting from the ground. Fire spirits could often be seen leaping and playing in the lava, and upon spotting Qin Sang, they would bare their claws and pounce.</p><p>Perhaps they had been cleared out, as the number of fire spirits was not as large as expected. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have had a harder time navigating through here.</p><p>Before long, he arrived near the Heavenly Peak, where the space had once been sealed by flame runes.</p><p>Now, the ancient restrictions were long gone. The once scattered peaks had mostly been submerged by lava, and those still exposed had turned into lava islands, no longer as pristine as before.</p><p>Even if there had been treasures, they would have been destroyed by the repeated lava surges.</p><p>The most dangerous aspect was not these, but the numerous spatial cracks and the ancient restrictions interspersed among them.</p><p>Compared to the past, the area was not as chaotic as it had been at the start of the upheaval. After observing for a while, Qin Sang did not see any new spatial cracks forming.</p><p>But that did not mean he could rest easy.</p><p>Looking at the dense spatial cracks ahead, Qin Sang felt a pang of fear.</p><p>The lava was also unsafe, as the main body of the secret realm's ancient restrictions lay within it. Now, it was highly sensitive. If he triggered the restrictions, the backlash would be the least of his worries. If it caused a spatial disturbance and he was caught in a crack, there would be no escape.</p><p>The distance between him and the Heavenly Peak was not far, but it felt like an insurmountable chasm!</p><p>"After forming my Nascent Soul, with the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, entering shouldn't be difficult. But what would be the point of finding the Inner Landscape Primordial Rune then? I can only try. If I really can't get in, I can't force it..."</p><p>Qin桑 shook his head, summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and had her perch on his shoulder, fully activating her Heavenly Eye ability.</p><p>He circled the area, going back and forth countless times.</p><p>After much deliberation, he finally chose a direction and cautiously entered.</p><p>But before he had gone far, Qin桑 encountered an ancient restriction blocking his path and was forced to retreat.</p><p>He did not give up, choosing another direction and continuing to probe.</p><p>Time and again, his attempts ended in failure.</p><p>Each time required his utmost concentration, and even with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin桑 felt exhausted. Knowing he couldn't rush, he found a lava island and decided to stay there for a few more days.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>No other cultivators appeared.</p><p>Qin桑 relaxed and continued his exploration bit by bit, finally making some progress. He could now cover about half the distance.</p><p>On the third day, Qin桑 entered the spatial crack zone, searching for a path to get closer to the Heavenly Peak, when he suddenly sensed something and immediately looked down, staring intently at the lava ahead.</p><p>The lava surged violently, showing no signs of abnormality.</p><p>But just then, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had detected a faint shadow in the lava, which had flashed and disappeared into the depths.</p><p>The shadow was extremely subtle, and if not for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's warning, Qin桑 would have surely missed it.</p><p>"Besides the fire spirits, could there be other living beings here? And they can move freely in such a place?"</p><p>Qin桑 was astonished, then suddenly remembered something.</p><p>"Could it be? Is it them?"</p><p>Qin桑's gaze sharpened slightly. After a moment of thought, he quietly retreated from the spatial crack zone, landed on the island, and took out a jade bottle from his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>The jade bottle contained only a thin layer of spiritual liquid, the remaining Crimson Fire Flowing Gold that he had used to feed the Fat Silkworm and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Neither of the two spirit insects had reached the fourth transformation, and he had no other spirit insects worth cultivating with the Crimson Fire Flowing Gold, so he had kept it until now.</p><p>The remaining Crimson Fire Flowing Gold was too little to be of much use to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Earlier, Qin桑 had taken out a bit, hoping to tempt the Fat Silkworm into waking up, but he had failed.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had been sleeping inside Ya Gu's body.</p><p>Now, several months had passed, and there was still no sign of it waking up.</p><p>He didn't know when this pair of human and insect would awaken.</p><p>Qin桑 cleared the surrounding fire spirits, then placed a jade plate on the island and dripped a trace of Crimson Fire Flowing Gold onto it. His figure then flashed and disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>At first, there was no sign of anything unusual.</p><p>The lava waves crashed against the island, quickly cooling and solidifying into layers of black rock.</p><p>Before long, a small figure suddenly appeared in the lava.</p><p>It swam freely within, completely unafraid of the lava.</p><p>Clearly, it had sensed the Crimson Fire Flowing Gold and was drawn to it, but it was cautious and did not come ashore directly. Instead, it swam around the island several times, observing for any threats.</p><p>"It really is a Fire Jade Centipede!"</p><p>Qin桑, hiding in the shadows, felt a surge of excitement.</p><p>He finally saw the creature's full form—it was indeed a Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>And it was a Fire Jade Centipede at the peak of the second transformation!</p><p>The difference between male and female Fire Jade Centipedes was significant, making them easy to distinguish.</p><p>"A male! Could it be the one that Earth Deficiency Old Man took from me?"</p><p>Qin桑 wondered.</p><p>Back when he had obtained the Fire Jade Centipede, it had only been at the peak of the first transformation. Even after raising it for over twenty years, he had not been able to make it transform. The Fire Jade Centipede had not acknowledged him as its master, so Qin桑 wasn't sure if this was the same one he had lost or a descendant of that pair of centipedes.</p><p>"All the spirit insects were in Earth Deficiency Old Man's spirit beast bag, which was destroyed by Daoist Xuan Yu. I never expected the Fire Jade Centipede to survive. If I had known, I would have come back to retrieve them earlier... Why isn't the female centipede here?"</p><p>Qin桑 used his Heavenly Eye ability to carefully inspect the area.</p><p>In the end, he confirmed that there was only this one centipede nearby.</p>
