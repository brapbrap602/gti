<h1>Chapter 1516: Soul-Seizing Incantation </h1><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his Treasure Pouch, releasing the Nascent Soul of Palace Master Yin.</p><p>Before entering the stone stele's space, Palace Master Yin had been released to take a look, then sealed again.</p><p>Regaining consciousness, Palace Master Yin glared at Qin Sang with intense fury and resentment, disappointment flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He could guess that the anomalies in the Sacred Ground were inseparable from the actions of Primordial Demon and Heavenly Peng, and he had hoped to see Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu die at the hands of the demons, taking them with him to the grave.</p><p>Unfortunately, things did not go as he wished.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed into Palace Master Yin's eyes. "I have no interest in torturing others for pleasure. I simply wish to ask you a few questions, Fellow Daoist. If you answer truthfully, I will grant you a swift end. Do not think of using these conditions to threaten me; I will not allow a tiger to return to the mountains."</p><p>Palace Master Yin's eyes widened, emitting a terrifying killing intent, enraged by Qin Sang's words.</p><p>"The victor is king, and the loser is a bandit. With Fellow Daoist Yin's intelligence, you should understand this principle. There's no need to put on such an act," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The killing intent on Palace Master Yin's face remained intense, but his eyes regained some composure as he coldly stared at Qin Sang.</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Late at night, heavy snow fell.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain lineage was shrouded in an atmosphere of sorrow and gloom.</p><p>The main peak of Heavenly Mountain, once a vital area of the lineage, bustling with activity, was now guarded only by sentries, giving it a desolate appearance.</p><p>The palace lanterns hanging on the mountain emitted a pale light, hazy and filled with a sense of loneliness.</p><p>The snow fell heavier and heavier. In the short span of a single incense stick's burning time, another thick layer had accumulated on the existing snow, indicating that tonight, Heavenly Mountain would not be peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, a phantom emerged from the darkness, surveyed the surroundings briefly, and silently swept towards the back of the mountain.</p><p>His body was light and swift, emitting a faint, eerie glow.</p><p>The snowflakes he encountered along the way seemed to twist the space momentarily upon contact with the glow. The snowflakes continued to fall from their original direction, so even if someone were nearby, they would not notice any abnormalities in this area.</p><p>This person was clearly skilled in a highly sophisticated evasion technique.</p><p>He crossed a flat area, relieved that he had not been discovered. His figure flashed repeatedly, traversing the cliffs and precipices, fleeing as if his life depended on it.</p><p>He was extremely familiar with this place and easily avoided other cultivators.</p><p>Just as he was about to successfully escape this place of trouble, a voice suddenly rang in his ear, "Where is Fellow Daoist You going?"</p><p>The person froze, rooted to the spot, revealing an aged face beneath his hood.</p><p>The old man struggled to turn his head and saw a figure standing on a nearby rock, hands behind his back, looking down at him.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Seeing the person's face clearly, the old man's expression changed drastically.</p><p>Over the past few days, he had heard this person's name countless times, to the point where his ears were almost calloused.</p><p>Daoist Master Qingfeng's original name was Qin Sang. This person had suppressed countless top-tier demons in the Sacred Ground, and even Primordial Demon and Heavenly Peng had fallen into his hands!</p><p>When Tong Lingyu brought back this news, everyone's first reaction was that it was absurd!</p><p>However, good news travels slowly, but bad news spreads fast. After the Sacred Ground was closed, some of the surviving demons knew what had happened, and the news spread like a hurricane!</p><p>Gradually, Profound Sky Palace gathered some information from the outside world, corroborating the events, leaving them no choice but to believe.</p><p>Elder You, seeing that it was Qin Sang himself who had come after him, was already intimidated before any battle, his heart filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang stood lightly on the boulder, the cold snow unable to approach him. He looked down at Elder You and sighed, "The Grand Elder is benevolent. Shang Lu and the others aided the wicked, committing such cruel acts, yet only the ringleaders were executed, while the rest were merely punished. Why must Fellow Daoist You do this? I can only send the Elder to the Repentance Spring."</p><p>Now, he no longer needed to hide his identity and used his real name.</p><p>After teleporting back from the nameless island, he, Tong Lingyu, and the others had approached the Profound Sky lineage, revealing the life-or-death status of Luo Yun.</p><p>The Yin family, having lost two top-tier experts, was like a dragon without a head and had no way to defend themselves.</p><p>The plan proceeded very smoothly.</p><p>The lineage of Yin Changsheng was demoted from the main branch, and the authority of the Profound Sky lineage was reclaimed.</p><p>The Profound Sky lineage understood that they had angered the masses. With Yin Changsheng committing such acts, if it were put to a general discussion among all lineages, maintaining the status of the main branch would likely be a luxury. In the end, they chose to submit to Tong Lingyu and acquiesced.</p><p>Even with some stubborn individuals and remnants of Yin Changsheng's faction, Qin Sang and Liuli did not expend much effort in cleaning them up.</p><p>Qin Sang's gains were abundant, the most important being a cultivation method and a secret technique.</p><p>The cultivation method was called the *Record of Subtle Clarity*, one of the fundamental inheritances of Profound Sky Palace. It was a profound and mystical technique, and Qin Sang intended to have his external body cultivation switch to this method, but he still needed to carefully consider it.</p><p>The secret technique was precisely the divine sense attack technique Qin Sang had been longing for, called the *Soul-Seizing Incantation*.</p><p>Palace Master Yin had used this very technique before.</p><p>Qin Sang had already obtained the *Soul-Seizing Incantation* from him, but to be safe, he found the original texts of the cultivation method and secret technique within the Profound Sky lineage before feeling at ease.</p><p>If Qin Sang's guess was correct, the secret technique mastered by Yin Changsheng was likely a modified version developed through comprehending the *Soul-Seizing Incantation*. Unfortunately, it was not passed down to others and was lost along with Yin Changsheng's fall.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang obtained some elixirs similar to the Fleeting Snow Elixir for restoring true essence, as well as other treasures, in preparation for his journey to the Central Province.</p><p>Having obtained what he wanted, Qin Sang granted Palace Master Yin a swift death.</p><p>After dealing with the Profound Sky lineage, Tong Lingyu immediately moved against the Heavenly Mountain lineage.</p><p>The previously established plan to split the Heavenly Mountain and demote them to a branch lineage had met with far more resistance from the Heavenly Mountain lineage than from the Profound Sky lineage.</p><p>However, the evil deeds of Shang Lu and the others were irrefutable facts.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang's battle against the numerous demons in the stone stele's space, where he nearly took Primordial Demon's head amidst ten thousand troops, and other legends spread throughout the outside world, told with vivid detail, causing all who heard them to be shocked and terrified.</p><p>These various factors prevented the Heavenly Mountain lineage from making a desperate, scorched-earth decision in the first instance.</p><p>Tong Lingyu naturally wouldn't give them the opportunity to form alliances and counterattacks. With swift and decisive action, a series of suppressive and divisive tactics were employed, both carrot and stick. The Heavenly Mountain lineage was already incapable of resisting.</p><p>Tonight was the purging of the remaining poison within Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Tong Lingyu and the others were busy elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang resolved his opponent first and arrived at the main peak of Heavenly Mountain. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly saw through the old man's form and discovered that he had secretly infiltrated the main peak, stealing something unknown.</p><p>Although this person's cultivation was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, he was neither an Elder nor a Palace Master, similar to the old man surnamed Lu who guarded the Profound Sky Palace's treasure vault, cultivating in solitude.</p><p>He was not originally on the list to be purged, so it was unknown why he had committed such an act.</p><p>The old man sneered, "Who is guilty and who is innocent? Isn't it all up to you to decide? You speak so loftily, but Tong Lingyu simply wants to eliminate dissidents! Tong Lingyu, a hen ruling the roost, colluded with you, a fellow of unknown origin, inviting a wolf into the house. With the two of you usurping control of Profound Sky Palace, engaging in wanton acts, its destruction is only a matter of time! I don't want to be buried along with Profound Sky Palace!"</p><p>"So, Fellow Daoist You intends to steal treasures and flee, betray your sect, and start anew?"</p><p>Qin Sang was unmoved. The words of the old man surnamed You were just as lofty, but in the end, it was merely greed that had arisen.</p><p>"In that case, I can only take Fellow Daoist to see the Grand Elder and ask her to deal with you!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang waved his sleeve, and a Demonic Flame Dragon charged out, circling above his head, locking onto the old man.</p><p>"You arrogant junior!"</p><p>The old man was furious. He brought his fingers together like a knife and slashed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>A layer of ice crystals instantly covered his hand-blade, transforming it, along with his arm, into a Profound Ice Blade.</p><p>'Shua!'</p><p>The blade energy left his body, and the snowflakes in the void instantly solidified, frozen in place.</p><p>Qin Sang only saw a stream of dark blue energy rushing towards him. He was about to activate the Demonic Flame to resist when he suddenly sensed something. His heart stirred, and the Demonic Flame Dragon dispersed, surrounding him completely.</p><p>At the instant the Demonic Flame dispersed, the blade energy in front of him suddenly and rapidly weakened. The blue stream of energy vanished at a speed visible to the naked eye. In the end, only a gentle breeze remained, blowing past Qin Sang without being able to touch the Demonic Flame in the slightest.</p><p>At the same time, anomalies arose in nine directions around Qin Sang.</p><p>The blade energy had somehow split into nine, and each one was as powerful as the original. They hung in the void, all aimed at Qin Sang, their energy connected, sealing off all escape routes.</p><p>"Slash!"</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>The nine blade energies slashed through the air, their speed like lightning, reaching the extreme.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm in the face of danger. He sneered, and with a thought, the Demonic Flame split into nine, transforming into nine smaller Flame Dragons. At the same time, he silently activated the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl, creating a protective barrier.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The blade energies pierced into the Demonic Flame, extremely sharp, leaving holes within the Demonic Flame, giving the impression that they would pierce through it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was ultimately more skilled.</p><p>The Demonic Flame was formless, and the blade energies could not harm it. Instead, they gradually weakened under the erosion of the flames until they were completely consumed.</p><p>Even if there were any residual waves, they were firmly blocked by the barrier, unable to harm Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>The old man clearly hadn't expected to kill Qin Sang with this method.</p><p>Without even looking ahead, he took out a black brush, dipped it in no ink, and drew in the void with swift, fluid strokes, completing the drawing in one go.</p><p>In an instant, a pattern appeared in the void. It depicted a person, remarkably similar to the old man.</p><p>The old man put away the black brush, his figure flashed, approaching the figure in the pattern, and pierced through it.</p><p>An astonishing scene occurred. The old man entered the pattern but did not emerge from the other side. He vanished into thin air!</p><p>Before leaving, the old man glanced at Qin Sang, his expression filled with mockery.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with a brilliant light, and the Phoenix Wings on his back spread wide. His figure shot upwards at extreme speed.</p><p>The old man's secret technique was peculiar and seemed to have been prepared in advance.</p><p>Qin Sang could not instantly determine the old man's movement location, but he was clear on one point: the old man should not be able to move too far, otherwise, he would have left directly after succeeding.</p><p>In addition, when the old man disappeared, there was an undeniable fluctuation, indicating that this secret technique was not without flaws.</p><p>He reacted extremely quickly, soaring into the sky, where the surrounding terrain was fully visible.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew out of his Qi Sea and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder. Its wings spread open, taking in everything below. It immediately spotted an anomaly in a distant mountain stream, a faint glimmer flashing and disappearing.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't acted so quickly, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's eyesight wasn't so excellent, the old man might have escaped.</p><p>On the rock wall of the mountain stream, there were some seemingly natural patterns, outlining a blurry human figure.</p><p>Suddenly, the rock wall lit up slightly.</p><p>The old man's figure appeared out of thin air, stepping down from it. At the same time, his Daoist robe shook, quickly suppressing the fluctuations caused by the secret technique.</p><p>Then, he transformed, his body shattering with a 'peng' sound, turning into a flurry of snowflakes.</p><p>Just as he was about to completely merge into the blizzard and escape, a sharp sound of rushing air suddenly came from above. A bolt of lightning arrived in an instant, blocking the exit of the mountain stream.</p><p>The old man froze, turning to go in another direction, only to see a blur before his eyes. Another figure appeared in front of him, none other than Qin Sang's external body cultivation.</p><p>"If Fellow Daoist You remains obstinate, I can only resort to lethal measures..."</p><p>Qin Sang's faint voice sounded from behind.</p><p>Along with it came a terrifying aura that sent shivers down the old man's spine.</p><p>The old man turned around abruptly, his eyes fixed, staring straight at the Sun God Tree floating in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The Sun God Bird was poised to strike.</p><p>The spirit treasure, rumored to be miraculous in the outside world, was finally revealed before the old man.</p><p>Feeling it up close, the old man finally understood that the rumors were not exaggerated.</p><p>His expression was uncertain. Finally, he snorted coldly, reached out to grab the Treasure Pouch at his waist, and tossed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it and saw that it was filled to the brim with various treasures, enough to support the flourishing development of a sect.</p><p>The old man had the same idea as him, taking advantage of the Boundless Sea's emptiness to betray Profound Sky Palace, establish his own sect, and become a founding ancestor.</p><p>"Excuse me!"</p><p>Qin Sang and his external body cultivation escorted the old man back to the main peak of Heavenly Mountain, heading straight for the Dragon-Taming Pond.</p><p>Though named the Dragon-Taming Pond, it actually housed Snow Pythons.</p><p>This spirit beast, combined with the Python Banner, could display considerable combat power, and it didn't require its master to be distracted by controlling it, making it a truly excellent helper.</p><p>Qin Sang was not polite, sweeping away most of the Snow Pythons, leaving only the lowest-ranked ones.</p><p>Before long, Tong Lingyu had also finished the concluding work and arrived with her people.</p><p>The Heavenly Mountain lineage had completely become history!</p><p>What followed was a feast of division.</p><p>With different inheritances, there were few treasures from the Heavenly Mountain lineage that caught Qin Sang's eye. He selected a bottle of elixirs that aided cultivation and a few special magical treasures and techniques.</p><p>He did, however, unexpectedly discover a spirit herb needed for the Soul-Calming Incense, which was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>More abundant were various cultivation resources, allowing the Green Goat Temple to enjoy a period of prosperity.</p><p>According to the agreement, high-grade spirit stones and elixirs for restoring true essence all went to Qin Sang. The Listening Snow Tower didn't understand why Qin Sang had such a strange request, but they also proactively sent a portion.</p><p>Not only that, but Qin Sang also planned to make extensive purchases to ensure everything was foolproof.</p><p>Heavenly Mountain was destroyed.</p><p>Profound Sky relinquished its authority.</p><p>Tong Lingyu and Palace Master Jiang took the positions of Palace Master and Grand Elder, respectively.</p><p>The internal power structure of Profound Sky Palace shifted, and the aftershocks continued, but they had little to do with Qin Sang.</p><p>He had Profound Sky Palace send him information on the Boundless Sea, selecting a suitable location for his sect's base.</p><p>Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Numerous jade slips and records were laid out before Qin Sang. After browsing through them, he selected three locations he favored and was preparing to bid farewell to Liuli.</p><p>A streak of light rushed from the direction of Soaring Cloud Peak and entered the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>The person who arrived was a confidant of Tong Lingyu. He was very respectful towards Qin Sang and presented a stone box with both hands. "A mysterious person left this item at the Seventy-Two Springs, claiming to be an old acquaintance of yours, and came specifically to present a great gift."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He didn't have many old acquaintances in the North Sea.</p><p>Rising to his feet, Qin Sang received the stone box. He checked it, opened the restriction on the box, and found only a teardrop-shaped object.</p><p>Inside, a figure was sealed, extremely dissipated, as if it had undergone countless tortures, no longer resembling a human.</p><p>After looking carefully for a long time, Qin Sang finally confirmed that it was Primordial Demon Elder!</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>A big thank you to Su Zhimu for the two Alliance Master rewards!</p>
