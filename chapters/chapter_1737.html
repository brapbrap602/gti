<h1>Chapter 1728: Thunder Turtle</h1><p>The storm belt was perpetually dark.</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward alone, unable to communicate with anyone.</p><p>It felt as if he were the only person in the world. The howling wind and eerie demonic sounds of the heavens surrounded him, like being trapped in an inescapable hell, enveloped by endless loneliness, with no end in sight.</p><p>Dashing through the storm, Qin Sang's figure seemed small and fragile, a negligible speck in the gray curtain, vulnerable to being swallowed by any gust of wind, carried to an unknown fate.</p><p>His figure flickered in and out of view, seemingly engulfed by the hurricane, yet always reappearing ahead the moment the wind passed. He hadn't been swept away, but had skillfully evaded the gale, his movements incredibly refined.</p><p>Back then, even when he and Liuli used the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle, they hadn't dared to be so reckless. Only Transcending Tribulation cultivators could move with such ease and confidence.</p><p>He had repeated this countless times, it had become second nature.</p><p>He focused less on dodging the wind.</p><p>His right arm rose, positioned across his chest. A dagger-sized spiritual sword danced on his fingertips—the Gray Warbler Sword.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword was as elusive as its master. When the sword's shadow disappeared, a small area in Qin Sang's palm suddenly turned chaotic and indistinct, with twinkling lights, as if he had captured a small piece of the starry sky in his hand.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang was comprehending the Seven Constellations Division Sword Formation.</p><p>The starry sky in his palm was merely a phenomenon arising from his comprehension process, but it was evident that it was more refined than when he had trapped and killed the Great Saint of the Yao race, now possessing a profound and boundless aura.</p><p>For twenty years, aside from rest and recovery, he hadn't wasted a single moment, diligently studying various secret arts and techniques, making progress in each.</p><p>However, his physical body was not yet strong enough. The Seven Masters Buddha Seal and the Inner Lion Seal did not significantly enhance his combat power, not as effectively as the Seven Constellations Division Sword Formation. Therefore, Qin Sang prioritized comprehending the sword formation.</p><p>A sword shadow flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang experienced the birth and death of stars, sensing the mysteries of the sword formation's changes, almost losing himself in it.  Suddenly, his heart throbbed, jolting him awake.</p><p>His expression changed slightly, his eyes flashed with brilliance, and he abruptly looked up.</p><p>The surroundings were unremarkable—gray hurricanes everywhere, encircling him completely.</p><p>In the vast expanse of heaven and earth, the distant void was dark and deep. The huge waves whipped up by the hurricane were the only tangible things he could see.</p><p>No human figures, birds, fish, or beasts, not even an island, were visible.</p><p>What caused the tremor?</p><p>Qin Sang stared ahead for a long time, sensing something, his expression gradually turning serious. But he didn't stop, only restraining his breath.</p><p>Soon, a thunderous roar was faintly audible amidst the deafening wind.</p><p>Thunder wasn't uncommon here.</p><p>Since ancient times, wind and thunder have been associated.  Qin Sang had often seen dragon-like thunderbolts racing through the storms over the years, but this thunder was different from heavenly thunder!</p><p>The moment he heard it, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, a chill running down his spine.  His instincts sensed a threat!</p><p>"Could it be a ferocious beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.</p><p>This was his twenty-fourth year in the storm belt, and it was the first time he had detected the presence of a ferocious beast, perhaps because he was getting closer to the Return to Void.</p><p>Back then, two Transcending Tribulation cultivators led the hunt, killing the beasts and searching their souls.</p><p>The beasts, having lost their intelligence and driven to madness by the demonic sounds of the heavens, yielded no useful information.  It proved that provoking ferocious beasts was unprofitable.</p><p>But Qin Sang always believed in what he saw. If possible, he wanted to hunt a ferocious beast himself, preferably capturing one alive.</p><p>Hunting in the storm belt was extremely disadvantageous to cultivators.  This place was far from the cultivation world, with no nearby shelters.  One couldn’t use full power when fighting.</p><p>Especially now, with the changes in the heavens, ferocious beasts roamed everywhere. One had to reserve strength to deal with unexpected situations.</p><p>Qin Sang had one advantage over Hui Guang Saint and Qinghu Saint King: the Jade Buddha protected him from the demonic sounds of the heavens, removing a significant worry.</p><p>He suddenly stopped, pondered for a moment, and summoned his second Nascent Soul, restoring his external avatar.</p><p>Not to assist in battle.</p><p>Although he hadn't seen the beast yet, Qin Sang could sense a powerful threat, at least a Transcending Tribulation-level one. His external avatar hadn't fully recovered its strength, so it was best to have it scout the perimeter, ensuring there weren't other beasts nearby, before making a move.</p><p>The external avatar nodded to its original body, summoned the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, and held a demon banner in the other hand, flying off in another direction.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately headed towards the source of the thunder.</p><p>The thunder grew louder.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood.  That wasn't thunder; it was the roar of a monstrous beast. But as he approached, he saw the lightning.</p><p>In the dark storm, a bright flash of lightning was particularly conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his celestial vision and finally saw the beast at the heart of the lightning.</p><p>This beast's innate power was clearly related to lightning; it was constantly surrounded by electricity.  Its shape was roughly turtle-like, round, but far larger than any demonic turtle Qin Sang had ever seen.  It had a long, snake-like neck, no legs, and only a short, pointed tail.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized it didn't have a shell, but rather a silvery lightning net, forming a suit of thunder armor.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered a similar beast described in ancient texts. While not a demonic turtle, its appearance led his ancestors to name it the Thunder Turtle.  Unfortunately, the texts lacked detail on its powers, merely stating that it could summon thunder with a breath, moved with lightning speed, possessed unmatched power, and was invincible.</p><p>However, this Thunder Turtle was different.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a large chunk missing from its round body.  Only flickering lightning filled the gap—a raw, gaping wound, as if it had been bitten.  </p><p>It was a potentially fatal injury, yet the Thunder Turtle was still very much alive and active; an old wound, it seemed.</p><p>Thankfully, it was old. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have considered retreating immediately. Even wounded, the beast's power was immense, and he dared not relax.</p><p>Whatever beast had inflicted such a wound must be incredibly powerful.</p><p>Truly, Gui Xu was a den of vipers!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, hesitated no longer, and charged towards the Thunder Turtle!</p><p>It was difficult to remain completely hidden in the storm. Qin Sang's approach was quickly detected.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sudden clap of thunder.</p><p>This was the Thunder Turtle's roar. Its slender head snapped around, its bloodshot eyes blazing with madness and killing intent.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang was enveloped in blinding white light, his vision overwhelmed.  A sense of immediate danger washed over him.  He reacted instantly, black flames erupting from his body as he unleashed the Fire Lotus and activated the Mani Jewel's protective fire shield.</p><p>Qin Sang vanished, leaving behind only a black fireball.</p><p>The fire shield and the lightning, black and white, formed a stark contrast.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A lightning bolt struck the fire shield.</p><p>The shield shuddered violently; small flames were scattered, but demonic fire immediately replenished them, holding the lightning at bay!</p><p>Hidden within the fire shield, Qin Sang instantly retreated a thousand meters, unscathed, but the crisis wasn't over.</p><p>Before the lightning dissipated, a black shadow shot from the storm. The Thunder Turtle, almost simultaneously with the lightning, lunged at Qin Sang. Its terrifying physique, combined with the raging thunder, suggested it could crush anything in its path.</p><p>Worse, as the Thunder Turtle charged, the very world seemed to compress.  Despite the bright lightning, it illuminated only the area around the beast. Its body, a colossal grindstone of thunder, was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>The storm’s howling was completely drowned out by the earth-shattering thunder, like a collapsing mountain, terrifying anyone within earshot. Qin Sang felt like an ant at the foot of that mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He didn't choose to fight the Thunder Turtle head-on.</p><p>The firelight dimmed, then another flash of lightning appeared, this time propelled in the opposite direction at a speed no less impressive – Qin Sang's lightning escape technique.</p><p>His improved cultivation and physical body allowed him to withstand the backlash of the Qingluan lightning, making his escape technique unparalleled among those of his rank.</p><p>The lightning bolt instantly vanished into the depths of the storm.</p><p>Yet, even this incredibly fast escape technique wasn't enough to shake off the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Driven mad, the beast, once it fixed on prey, would not let go. Its massive body transformed into a column of lightning several times larger than Qin Sang, relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  This Thunder Turtle, a creature born of thunder, despite its injuries, possessed incredible strength. Unless he could instill primal fear, escape seemed impossible.</p><p>Still, he had anticipated this, daring to confront the beast. Its madness, its loss of reason, was its greatest weakness.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang summoned the Huiying Sword and silently invoked the sword techniques.</p><p>Two streaks of lightning chased each other in the dark storm.</p><p>Suddenly, the thin lightning bolt in front vanished without a trace.  The surrounding space was then shrouded in shadow, darker and more silent than before, even obscuring the remaining streak of lightning behind it.</p><p>The Seven Mansions Sword Formation!</p><p>However, Qin Sang only deployed the formation, not unleashing its full power; there wasn't a single starlight present.</p><p>Any cultivator of the same level would have been immediately alerted and would never have allowed the formation to envelop them, let alone charge into it.  Yet, the Thunder Turtle, consumed by madness and murderous intent,  unhesitatingly plunged into the formation, much like the manta ray that was lured into the Five Elements Array years ago.</p><p>The moment it entered, the scene around the Thunder Turtle drastically changed.</p><p>The ubiquitous storm disappeared, the prey vanished, and countless sword stars rose around it.</p><p>Within the formation, Qin Sang had divided his spirit into seven sword spirits, stationed at the seven mansions. His true body remained hidden, silently observing the Thunder Turtle, manipulating the formation.  Point by point, the stars gathered into rivers, the entire starry sky revolving around the beast.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A sword star quivered, transforming into a sharp sword, imbued with piercing intent, stabbing towards the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Thunder Turtle roared.  It had no patience to slowly search for weaknesses in the formation; it continued its reckless charge, unleashing a thunderball that flew straight towards the sword star.</p><p>The thunderball and the sword star collided in mid-air, their light and thunder exploding in a brilliant flash, like a great sun ignited in the night sky.</p><p>Following a furious roar, the immensely powerful Thunder Turtle reappeared at the explosion site, charging directly through the remaining energy wave.  Only its thunder armor trembled; no injuries were visible.</p><p>Within the formation,</p><p>Qin Sang, standing on a sword star, witnessed this scene, secretly marveling at the Thunder Turtle's ferocity.  He moved his sleeve, about to continue using the sword stars to attack, when his expression changed. He swiftly shifted to a different sword technique, his figure vanishing instantly.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle rampaged through the starry river, like a meteor made of lightning. Wherever it passed, sword stars shifted, the starry sky trembled, demonstrating the power of brute force.</p><p>Just now, the Thunder Turtle had suddenly changed direction, charging directly towards Qin Sang's true body!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. The Thunder Turtle was acting purely on instinct, not fooled by his sword spirit clones, and had quickly sensed his true body's location within the formation.</p><p>This was partly due to his limited time spent studying the formation, his lack of mastery, and a careless slip-up during his attack; controlling a single-person formation required attention to many details.</p><p>However, it also highlighted the Thunder Turtle's exceptionally keen senses. Before its injury, it was at least in the mid-stage of the Divine Transformation realm!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword star where Qin Sang had been standing was engulfed by a silver-white pillar of light, shattering into pieces. The Thunder Turtle emerged, its long head swivelling, searching for prey.</p><p>It didn't notice that the stars had shifted the moment it destroyed the sword star.</p><p>Qin Sang, having invested considerable effort in understanding the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, certainly possessed more than this one ability; many aspects remained unused.  This was a different stage of the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body moved constantly among the seven sword spirits, not only for concealment.</p><p>Different enemies required different strategies. The auras of the seven sword spirits appeared in the seven mansions, each seemingly real.</p><p>So many prey?</p><p>Confusion flashed in the Thunder Turtle's eyes; its head spun, but its madness prevented rational thought. It immediately lunged towards the closest aura.</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang had anticipated. As his thoughts shifted, the stars rearranged, the formation changing drastically. The Thunder Turtle charged towards the Kui mansion; Kui remained stationary, while the other six mansions were repositioned by Qin Sang, completely surrounding Kui.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle fell into the heart of the starry river. The stars above it spun, suddenly blazing brightly.  The dazzling starlight converged, forming an invisible light sword above the Thunder Turtle, striking downwards!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>As expected, the sword star holding the targeted sword spirit clone was smashed to pieces, but the formation's power was already evident in the light sword.</p><p>The sword intent was earth-shattering, its sharpness unparalleled.</p><p>As the light sword descended, the Thunder Turtle roared, its thunderous light flashing, its thunder armor instantly expanding.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The resulting shockwave swept outward, shaking the sword stars of the entire Kui mansion, seemingly on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Another enemy might have used this opportunity to find a weakness in the formation and escape.</p><p>But this was a maddened Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Before the shockwave dissipated, another of Qin Sang's auras appeared in the formation, instantly distracting the Thunder Turtle. It roared, turning to charge toward another mansion.</p><p>In the starry sky, light swords formed one after another.</p><p>This strategy aimed not only to gradually weaken the Thunder Turtle's strength.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated the poison beads.  Simultaneously with the light sword attacks, poison light had already separated, merging with the light swords, and during the impact, seeping into the cracks in the thunder armor, silently invading the Thunder Turtle's wounds.</p><p>(End)</p>
