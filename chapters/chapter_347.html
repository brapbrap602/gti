<h1>Chapter 340: The Heavenly Corpse Talisman</h1><p>Two more Soul-Guiding Grass leaves were resealed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang channeled a stream of spiritual energy to envelop the leaves, simultaneously activating a secret technique from the Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture.</p><p>Streams of spiritual energy surged like rushing rivers, converging before Qin Sang, forming countless mysterious runes. The luminescence of the energy illuminated the cave dwelling brilliantly.</p><p>Ultimately, these runes merged into one, and at the heart of the spiritual energy, a point of dark light suddenly appeared.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a tiny flame.</p><p>The flame gradually grew, expanding into a fist-sized ball of fire, burning fiercely.  The runes seemed to transform into a furnace, with Qin Sang's spiritual energy serving as fuel.</p><p>The flame remained a dark black, burning before Qin Sang, yet he felt no heat; instead, a chilling aura emanated from it.</p><p>This was a Yin Fire cultivated using a secret technique from the Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture, specifically designed for refining Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>Using the Yin Fire consumed spiritual energy rapidly, but Qin Sang, being at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, felt little pressure and didn’t worry about depleting his energy mid-refinement.</p><p>He glanced at the Yin Fire, then at the Soul-Guiding Grass, pondering for a moment.  He didn’t rush to add the grass, but instead focused on manipulating the Yin Fire.</p><p>Under Qin Sang’s control, the circular flame began to change, sometimes elongating, sometimes compressing.</p><p>Initially, the changes were slow, causing Qin Sang to slightly frown in concentration. Gradually, the changes became faster, transforming into vivid birds and beasts, and Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly relaxed.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, sending the Soul-Guiding Grass into the Yin Fire.</p><p>The Yin Fire suddenly expanded, completely enveloping the grass. Tiny flames began to scorch the Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an hour passed. The Soul-Guiding Grass still lay quietly in the Yin Fire.  Except for its surface luster dimming slightly, it appeared unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed no anxiety.</p><p>At this moment, he sat cross-legged on the wooden bed with his eyes closed, his entire being focused on the flame before him, his mind undisturbed.</p><p>As time passed, the first crack finally appeared on the Soul-Guiding Grass. Then more cracks emerged, densely packed, as if a gentle touch would shatter it.</p><p>In fact, without any external touch, the Soul-Guiding Grass disintegrated on its own.</p><p>To be more precise, it melted, becoming a pool of black spiritual liquid.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Grass was finally refined by the Yin Fire!</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, but remained vigilant. Refining the Soul-Guiding Grass was only the beginning; next came the purification of impurities, leaving only the essence!</p><p>Under the burning of the Yin Fire, the liquid’s volume gradually decreased. Initially the size of a baby’s fist, it was now reduced to a single drop, its color becoming increasingly profound.</p><p>Like ink.</p><p>From start to finish, this process took three full days to complete!</p><p>The impurities of the Soul-Guiding Grass were completely refined, yet its texture remained intact. This was crucial for the subsequent refinement of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman. This step demanded extremely high skill from the refiner, requiring not only sufficient patience, but also extremely precise control; one oversight could ruin everything.</p><p>Withdrawing the Yin Fire, Qin Sang opened his eyes, looking at the drop of liquid.  His eyes showed weariness, but more so, excitement.  He hadn't expected to succeed in the most difficult step of his first attempt at refining the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>After a short rest to recover his spiritual energy, Qin Sang immediately continued the refinement.</p><p>The liquid hovered before Qin Sang. His expression was serious, as he cleared his mind, raised his hands, forming various hand seals. His fingers danced, their speed increasing, leaving behind blurred afterimages.</p><p>As his hand seals changed, countless mysterious runes appeared, then were immediately infused into the liquid.</p><p>The liquid seemed to come alive, constantly writhing. It began to lose its black color, becoming lighter, and its shape became more regular…</p><p>Finally, a rectangular Heavenly Corpse Talisman was almost complete!</p><p>However, it wasn't over yet.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his movements, multitasking by splitting a strand of his soul from his primordial spirit, rapidly condensing it into a soul imprint, and embedding it into the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Done!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, his face pale.  His spiritual energy was more than half depleted, demonstrating the difficulty of refining the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Talisman was no longer black, but a translucent gray.</p><p>As thin as a piece of paper, like gray jade, only the size of a thumb, it exuded a mysterious aura, with a mysterious glow flowing according to a certain pattern.</p><p>Like the stars in the night sky, faintly visible, mesmerizing.</p><p>Qin Sang held the feather-light Heavenly Corpse Talisman in his palm, examining it carefully.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Talisman looked beautiful, but it was actually a highly sinister item used to create living corpses!  This contrast made Qin Sang sigh inwardly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to create a living corpse. Instead, he took out a jade box and sealed the first Heavenly Corpse Talisman, preparing to continue refining more.</p><p>“It seems not too difficult…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, trying to relax.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he could gloat for long, he received a lesson—his second attempt at refining a Heavenly Corpse Talisman failed.  The failure wasn't due to complacency or negligence on Qin Sang's part.  Failure was normal; refining Heavenly Corpse Talismans was incredibly difficult.  His first success was simply good luck.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang extinguished the remnants of the Soul-Guiding Grass, analyzed his mistake, and continued refining a third talisman.</p><p>Three days later, another Heavenly Corpse Talisman was completed!  Two talismans from one Soul-Guiding Grass—Qin Sang was quite satisfied.  After these three attempts, he had gained sufficient experience and believed his future success rate would be higher.</p><p>Just refining the talismans took eight days.  Calculating the time, Yun Youzi would likely arrive soon. Qin Sang stopped refining talismans and took out the prepared living corpse embryos from his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>According to the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, the requirements for creating living corpses differed greatly from those for creating煞尸 (sha corpses).  The Heavenly Corpse Talisman was only one requirement.</p><p>Because a living corpse's energy sea is intact and not depleted, building its five elemental foundations requires a significantly larger quantity of five elemental yin objects and earth煞气 (earth sha qi).  The exact amount varies depending on the situation, but it’s at least several times more than what's needed for a sha corpse.</p><p>Five elemental yin objects, while expensive, were not difficult to acquire, and Qin Sang had prepared plenty. However, he had little earth sha qi left.</p><p>Earth sha qi is an extremely yin substance. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators fear it, and it's rarely used in refining tools, except for some very rare, ancient artifacts.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had encountered several locations with concentrated yin煞气 in the Ancient Immortal battlefield, but none were like the Shao Hua Mountain's submerged cave. Therefore, his earth sha qi had been steadily dwindling without replenishment.  Unsuccessful sha corpse creations further exacerbated the shortage, leaving him with only three bottles.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the three small yin magnetic bottles, thinking to himself: If the earth sha qi runs out, it’s time for a trip back to Shao Hua Mountain.</p>
