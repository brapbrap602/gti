Chapter 113: The Sect Master's Sword

Inside the wooden hall on Daomen Peak.

After Qin Sang finished asking Elder Wen for guidance on refining Foundation Establishment Pills, he didn't leave immediately. Instead, he took out two mid-grade spirit stones and offered them to Elder Wen with both hands.

Elder Wen glanced at Qin Sang, his expression unchanged. He said indifferently, "What is the meaning of this, Nephew Qin?"

"As the saying goes, knowledge isn't given freely. I have benefited greatly from Elder Wen's guidance and am deeply grateful. I don't know how to repay your kindness. Considering my current situation, these worldly possessions are all I can offer. Please don't disdain them, Elder Wen," Qin Sang said sincerely.

Inwardly, he felt a pang of pain. He only had eight mid-grade spirit stones, and one had been partially depleted when he killed Sun De.

Earlier, he had refused Elder Ye's offer to purchase the Foundation Establishment Pill. Although Elder Ye had been polite, Qin Sang keenly sensed the sudden coldness in his eyes.

With the Foundation Establishment Pill in hand, if there hadn't been an issue with the Yama Banner, Qin Sang would only need to focus on his cultivation, ignoring everyone else, living a carefree life. Once he reached the Foundation Establishment stage, they would be equals, and he wouldn't fear anyone.

Now, however, things were different. He needed to find more support for himself.

Of course, the reason he offered spirit stones to Elder Wen wasn't solely because of Elder Ye.

Befriending a Foundation Establishment cultivator had been Qin Sang's intention for a while. Now that he had lost the Soul Pill's support, it was even more urgent.

The mysterious orchid was still in his storage pouch. He still didn't know what kind of spiritual herb it was, what kind of pill it could refine, or what its effects were.

Originally, Qin Sang planned to investigate slowly after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Now, it seemed he might not have that much time. If he couldn't break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he planned to offer the orchid in exchange for future prospects.

If he couldn't reach the Foundation Establishment stage, what use was the mysterious orchid, no matter how powerful it was?

Unless it was a herb that could grant instant ascension, even if the orchid could help a Golden Core cultivator reach the Nascent Soul stage, it would be a castle in the air, meaningless to him.

There was a fact he was reluctant to admit: without the Soul Pill's support, what were his chances of reaching the Nascent Soul stage? How far could he go in the future? Qin Sang didn't even dare to think deeply about it, fearing despair.

Of course, he needed to sell it for a good price. If a single petal could be exchanged for something valuable, offering the entire herb would be a great loss.

It was said that the second floor of the Pagoda Peak housed many ancient texts of the cultivation world, including ancient pill recipes and ancient secrets. Qin Sang planned to cultivate a good relationship with Elder Wen and, when the time was right, borrow his token to access Pagoda Peak and examine the materials.

Qin Sang's reasons for currying favor with Elder Wen were twofold: firstly, Elder Wen was the Foundation Establishment cultivator he was most familiar with. Secondly, from Elder Wen's words and actions when he first joined the sect, Qin Sang could tell that he wasn't a heartless person and probably wouldn't turn his back on him after accepting the gifts.

He just worried that two mid-grade spirit stones wouldn't be enough. He wondered if his meager possessions would suffice.

Qin Sang held out his hands, his thoughts racing. Then he felt his palms lighten and inwardly let out a sigh of relief.

Elder Wen nodded, quite satisfied with Qin Sang's respectful attitude. He took the two mid-grade spirit stones into his storage pouch and said, "Nephew Qin, do you have any other questions? Feel free to ask."

Money makes the world go round, truly a wise saying.

Seeing how quickly the two spirit stones took effect, Qin Sang sighed inwardly and seized the opportunity to ask, "Elder Wen, I'd like to ask if there are any cultivation techniques or secret methods that can rapidly increase one's cultivation level. It doesn't matter if the resulting strength is weaker than others at the same level. I just want to quickly reach the thirteenth level of Qi Refining and break through to the Foundation Establishment stage."

"Nephew Qin, your cultivation speed isn't slow. Are you already impatient?"

Elder Wen frowned slightly, looking at Qin Sang with displeasure, his tone carrying a hint of warning. "As far as I know, there are no such techniques or secret methods in the Qi Refining stage that can rapidly increase cultivation. Even if there were, they would be the methods of demonic cultivators, and Shaohua Mountain would never collect them. Nephew Qin, you should be patient and cultivate steadily. Don't stray from the righteous path."

Qin Sang adopted a receptive posture, but he didn't want to give up easily. "Elder Wen, I've heard several senior brothers speak of the legend of Senior Qingzhu. It's said that Senior Qingzhu's talent wasn't exceptional, but he reached the Golden Core stage in just forty years, a cultivation speed unmatched in the sect. I wonder what Senior Qingzhu's cultivation method was. Could I cultivate it?"

This was information Qin Sang had gathered after numerous inquiries, but those fellow disciples didn't know much. Elder Wen should know more.


"It's no secret that Elder Green Bamboo's cultivation method is incomplete..."
At this point, Uncle Wen paused, and Qin Sang noticed a flicker of fear in his eyes.

Uncle Wen shook his head abruptly and said decisively, "It carries significant risks, and it's not suitable for everyone. Elder Green Bamboo's current state is a direct result of cultivating this method.  Furthermore, it requires a Foundation Establishment cultivator to practice.  You shouldn't..."

Suddenly, a deafening sword cry echoed from outside. Uncle Wen's expression changed drastically, and he vanished from the spot, reappearing outside the wooden hall in the blink of an eye.

Such incredible speed!

Qin Sang was awestruck.  He hadn't even seen Uncle Wen move; one moment he was there, the next he was gone.  This was the difference between major cultivation realms!

"Uncle Wen, what happened?"

Qin Sang rushed to Uncle Wen's side and followed his gaze towards the depths of Mount Shaohua.  Among the layered clouds and peaks, the majestic outline of the mountain was faintly visible.  At its summit, a colossal white sword energy pierced the sky, its aura breathtaking. The lingering echo of the sword cry resonated throughout the entire sect.

Even more astonishing, upon hearing the sword cry, the Ebony Sword within Qin Sang's Qi sea trembled, as if expressing fear and submission!

Immediately afterward, beams of sword light erupted from the various peaks, streaking like meteors toward Mount Shaohua, a truly magnificent sight.

"The Sect Master's flying sword summons us.  Disciple Qin, please excuse me."

With these words, Uncle Wen transformed into a streak of sword light and hurried away.

There were still so many questions unanswered.

With a sigh of resignation, Qin Sang activated his Flying Shuttle and headed towards the mountain gate, pondering Uncle Wen's words. The cultivation method required Foundation Establishment, so it was beyond his reach for now.

Uncle Wen had mentioned significant risks. He wondered what those might be.  If they pertained to the spirit, perhaps the Jade Buddha could mitigate them.  Once he reached Foundation Establishment, it might be worth investigating.

Ultimately, reaching Foundation Establishment was the key to his future.

Qin Sang sighed softly. Arriving at the Earth Sink Cave, he descended, sealed the entrance, and cultivated diligently for a while. Sensing only a negligible improvement in his cultivation, a wave of frustration washed over him, breaking his meditative state.

Gazing up at the dark dome of the cave, after a long while, Qin Sang retrieved the three Foundation Establishment Pills from his storage pouch.
