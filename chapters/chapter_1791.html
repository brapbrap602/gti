<h1>Chapter 1782: Jade Mansion of Thunder</h1><p>Spiritual armor clad his body.</p><p>Qin Sang chanted, activating the spiritual armor and raising his left arm. Simultaneously, his right hand silently formed the Demon Subduing Seal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The instant the Demon Subduing Seal struck the arm armor, the armor's intricate patterns vanished, transforming into shimmering ripples like water.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wasn't actually trying to injure himself, nor did he activate his Spiritwood Body, but he did use five or six-tenths of his power.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor brought him great surprise.</p><p>The shimmering ripples resembled a bottomless abyss.  The might of the Demon Subduing Seal was almost entirely blocked and absorbed by the True Treasure fragment, leaving his left arm completely unharmed.</p><p>"How is it? This Daoist said that when the True Treasure was intact, it was likely a supreme defensive treasure!"</p><p>Master Qi stroked his tangled beard, revealing a self-satisfied smile, then sighed. "I wonder what realm of expert could shatter such a supreme treasure!"</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor wasn't entirely a success, falling short of their expectations.</p><p>Yet, Master Qi, who had once refined a Pseudo-Spiritual Treasure, still considered this his proudest work!</p><p>Most importantly, he had achieved enlightenment at the final moment.</p><p>Once he digested the gains from this experience, he would surely advance to a higher realm in the Dao of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor hadn't reached its limit just now, but Qin Sang wasn't planning on further testing it in front of Master Qi.</p><p>He was certain that this armor could protect him during a battle with a Soul Formation expert. The only drawback was the limited area protected by the True Treasure fragment.</p><p>If he encountered a world-destroying divine ability, the True Treasure fragment might remain unscathed, but the spiritual armor itself might not be able to withstand it.</p><p>Seeing the reluctance in Master Qi's eyes, Qin Sang smiled and returned the Returning Wind Armor, staying behind at Master Qi's residence.</p><p>Observing Master Qi's artifact refinement had also yielded significant gains for him, and he urgently needed to enter seclusion to comprehend them.</p><p>Every improvement Qin Sang made in the Dao of Artifact Refinement benefited the Cloudsoar Sword's spirit embryo nurturing.</p><p>……</p><p>Above the water, not far from Swordheart Island, Qin Sang flew slowly, his fingers entwined with threads of fire.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see it was a centipede crawling on his hand.</p><p>After the Altar's completion, Qin Sang continued to cultivate Inner Truth. Now that his Protective Altar Inner Truth could barely shield the Fire Jade Centipede, he awakened it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was still at the Fourth Transformation Mid-Stage.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense its aura stirring restlessly.  If not for the influence of the Six Heavens Resentful Qi, it would likely have already broken through.</p><p>Fourth Transformation Late-Stage spirit insects weren't weak, each possessing life-saving divine abilities, though their overall capabilities were inferior to human cultivators.</p><p>In the future, when encountering opportunities, he could confidently let the Fire Jade Centipede search for treasures in most places.</p><p>There was still some Fire Spirit remaining from the Flowing Fire Illusionary True Pool of the Formless Immortal Sect, and there were also quite a few spirit pills left over from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  Supplemented by the Insect Control Secret Art imparted by Ghost Mother, it wouldn't be difficult to push the Fire Jade Centipede to the peak of the Fourth Transformation.</p><p>According to Ghost Mother, the Fire Jade Centipede's potential could support it to the peak of the Fourth Transformation.  Breaking through to the Fifth Transformation would be its limit, even if by a stroke of luck.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede coiled into a ball in his palm, carefree.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet found a way to cause the Fire Jade Centipede to undergo a transformation, so he could only think of ways to help it break through for now.</p><p>"Azure Frost Pill…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of this medicine. Unfortunately, he had searched the Star Island Immortal Lake for a long time without finding any trace of the Hundred-Jointed Earth Bamboo.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu had promised to help him keep an eye out for it.  He would write a letter when he had time.</p><p>With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Swordheart Island came into view. Qin Sang withdrew the Fire Jade Centipede and released his aura.</p><p>The island's restrictions immediately flickered, and True Person Swordbearer flew to meet him. "Fellow Daoist, are you ready?"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. "I'll trouble Fellow Daoist to accompany me to visit True Person Zhan Gui."</p><p>"I've been waiting for your news." True Person Swordbearer smiled faintly, said "Wait a moment," and flew back to Swordheart Island.  A moment later, he returned to the sky, flying north alongside Qin Sang.</p><p>They first arrived at a spirit island with a teleportation formation, which transported them to the northern part of the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>The islands in the northern part of the Immortal Lake were as numerous as in other areas, but as they continued to fly north, Qin Sang noticed the aura of cultivators becoming increasingly sparse. Later, he even saw large swathes of deserted spirit islands.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the northern shore of the Star Island Immortal Lake was the edge of Ju Shan's domain.</p><p>Continuing north would lead them deep into the infamous Wasteland of Sin.</p><p>Ferocious beasts roamed the depths of the Wasteland of Sin, far more savage than the demons and devils of the Ghost Fang Kingdom. They were bloodthirsty and crazed.</p><p>Near the dual domains of the Dao Court, there would be Immortal Guards and Earth Envoys stationed by the Dao Court to patrol and eliminate threats, but Ju Shan's domain was fragmented and couldn't organize such a force.</p><p>The sects of the Star Island Immortal Lake had joined forces, but they only dispatched some personnel to patrol the vicinity, guarding against ferocious beasts from invading the heartland of the Immortal Lake.</p><p>Incidents of ferocious beasts breaking into the Immortal Lake were common, so the closer one got to the northern shore, the more dangerous it became. Few cultivators dared to establish their caves there.</p><p>This was only the apparent danger.</p><p>It was said that the deeper one went into the Wasteland of Sin, the denser the Six Heavens Resentful Qi became. Even the Protective Altar couldn't shield cultivators indefinitely.  Many cultivators had become lost within, having ventured too deep or stayed too long.</p><p>When cultivators from Ju Shan's domain went out to hunt ferocious beasts, they would first set a range and a date.  Once the time came, regardless of whether they had any gains, they had to return.</p><p>"We've arrived."</p><p>True Person Swordbearer pointed ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, seeing only a towering cliff face.  The cliff wasn't wide and formed a spirit island.</p><p>Just over a hundred miles further north was the northern shore of the Star Island Immortal Lake.  No other cultivators were visible nearby, making it truly secluded.</p><p>The two soared into the sky and soon landed atop the cliff, greeted by a lush scene.</p><p>Beneath a light mist, tree shadows danced, and spiritual plants flourished.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced casually, then his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>At that moment, a calm voice emerged from the forest, "Welcome, honored guests. Please come in."</p><p>As the voice faded, the ancient trees before them suddenly swayed and uprooted themselves.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>One ancient tree after another shifted its roots, moving to the sides and opening a path through the forest.</p><p>"The trees and plants in the forest are all True Person Zhan Gui's subordinates."</p><p>True Person Swordbearer explained via voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and walked into the forest alongside True Person Swordbearer.  He saw several ancient wooden halls.</p><p>A Daoist in a tall crown stood before the hall.  It was True Person Zhan Gui, smiling at them and bowing.  "It's been many years. True Person Swordbearer, your demeanor remains as elegant as ever. I apologize for not welcoming you personally.  Please don't take offense…  And this Fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>"Greetings, True Person."  True Person Swordbearer returned the greeting and introduced the two of them.</p><p>As they spoke, they entered the hall and took their seats according to their status.</p><p>Learning that Qin Sang had come seeking ascension, True Person Zhan Gui sized him up and nodded approvingly. "True Person Swordbearer's friends are truly dragons among men!"</p><p>Qin Sang modestly demurred, about to speak, when True Person Swordbearer suddenly rose and said, "I am merely a guide.  It's best for me to excuse myself while you two discuss important matters."</p><p>With that, True Person Swordbearer stepped out of the hall, leaving only the two of them.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui got straight to the point, "May I ask what Dharma True Person Qingfeng cultivates?"</p><p>"The High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal it, nor could he.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui appeared surprised. "True Person is not a direct disciple of the Thunder Mansion?"</p><p>Among cultivators, it was customary to refer to both the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder collectively as the Thunder Mansion.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I am an outer sect disciple, fortunate enough to be granted the High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma."</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui suddenly understood.</p><p>The Thunder Mansion held great renown in the Star Island Immortal Lake and had ties to the Dao Court.</p><p>If Qin Sang had come from the Thunder Mansion, he should have heard of him long ago.  There would have been no need for Qin Sang to come personally; he could have contacted the Dao Court through his sect master.</p><p>"The third stage Dharma of the High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma is the Five Thunders Secret Art. Both courtyards of the Dao Court can bestow this Dharma…"</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui had encyclopedic knowledge of various Dharmas.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. The greatest fear when cultivating a Dharma was encountering an incomplete one and being forced to switch midway, leading to an unstable Altar foundation.</p><p>"However," True Person Zhan Gui's tone suddenly shifted, "the Dao Court can bestow the Dharma upon you, but it's uncertain which Thunder Department deity from the Myriad Deities Thunder Authority Immortal Guide you should contemplate, and whether you can succeed.  That will require you to explore on your own."</p><p>The Protective Altar Deity was the most crucial aspect of the Dharma.</p><p>Without guidance from predecessors, cultivators could only try one deity after another according to the Myriad Deities Thunder Authority Immortal Guide.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "What if I can't contemplate a Protective Altar Deity?"</p><p>"True Person can choose to ascend to another Dharma. To my knowledge, the Nine Lights of Spiritual Flight Dharma can replace the Five Thunders Secret Art. Of course, if True Person doesn't wish to change Dharmas, you can first contemplate Inner Truth as a temporary measure while gradually attempting to contemplate Thunder Department deities."</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui paused. "If, by chance, you still haven't succeeded in contemplating a deity by the time your Nascent Soul shows signs of unrest, you can then come to the Dao Court to add the Nine Lights of Spiritual Flight Dharma."</p><p>"How long can Inner Truth last? And what are the conditions for adding a Dharma?" Qin Sang seemed very concerned about this, asking everything clearly.</p><p>"Before breaking through to the late stage of the Profound Clarity Dharma Position, you don't need to worry too much.  As for adding a Dharma, although the Dao Court won't give it away for free, they won't make things difficult for you either," True Person Zhan Gui said casually.</p><p>According to True Person Zhan Gui, with Inner Truth as the Protective Altar, one could only persist up to the late stage of Soul Formation. No wonder cultivators in this world all chose to contemplate deities.</p><p>Demons and devils contemplated Inner Truth, yet they could rival the Dao Court. This was likely due to the strengthening effect of their demonic bloodline.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then said, "The Thunder Mansion should have related scriptures, right?"</p><p>The cultivators of the Thunder Mansion all cultivated the High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma, and there were no lack of Soul Formation experts among them. They must have experience.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui shook his head. "True Person might as well go and inquire with the Thunder Mansion yourself."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang didn't inquire further.</p><p>In truth, whether he could contemplate a deity didn't affect him much.  At least until he knew the deities' true nature, he didn't intend to invite a deity into his body.</p><p>Asking these questions was just for show, lest True Person Zhan Gui become suspicious.</p><p>"I choose the Five Thunders Secret Art!" Qin Sang declared resolutely.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui nodded and mused, "Since you are close acquaintances, True Person Swordbearer should have explained the rules to you…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, indicating his understanding.</p><p>"What choice will True Person make then?" True Person Zhan Gui gazed intently at Qin Sang, his voice deep.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and said solemnly, "I wish to request a Dao Court Dharma Decree!"</p><p>Requesting a Dharma Decree, but not offering service to the Dao Court.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui's eyes showed a hint of regret.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't concealed his aura, and he had already discerned Qin Sang's cultivation level.  Those who broke through before ascension were all extraordinarily talented, and the Dao Court also wished to recruit geniuses.  Unfortunately, such individuals were invariably proud and aloof; who would willingly be controlled by others?</p><p>Since high-level Dharmas were controlled by the Dao Court, why not use this to force them into submission instead of specifically leaving them a loophole?</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui had once asked his master and received the answer: the Ghost Fang Kingdom could also bestow certain high-level Daoist Dharmas!</p><p>When he first learned of this secret, True Person Zhan Gui had been shocked for a long time, gaining a deeper understanding of the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Knowing that this type of person possessed unwavering resolve and couldn't be easily swayed, True Person Zhan Gui didn't waste any more words. He rose and said "Wait a moment," then turned and went to the back hall.</p><p>A short while later, True Person Zhan Gui returned, holding two jade slips. "True Person can choose one of these two Dharma Decrees."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and first thanked True Person Zhan Gui.</p><p>Coming here, there was generally no room for bargaining.  The fact that he was allowed to choose was likely due to True Person Swordbearer's influence.</p><p>His divine sense probed into one of the jade slips.  After reading it, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before examining the other one.</p><p>As expected, both Dharma Decrees were related to the Ghost Fang Kingdom and required infiltration into its heartland. They were sufficiently dangerous yet didn't involve true secrets.</p><p>As for the degree of difficulty, that required consideration of Qin Sang's divine abilities and magical treasures.</p><p>"I choose this one."</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang picked up the second jade slip and then made a heart oath as required.</p><p>Only then did True Person Zhan Gui unlock the restrictions on the jade slip, allowing him to learn the full details of the Dharma Decree, while also handing Qin Sang a porcelain bottle.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the bottle and saw a snow-white pill inside, emitting a faint, elegant fragrance. It was the True Stabilizing Pill.</p><p>"True Person, remember, you must escape the danger before the pill's power expires.  Don't be arrogant.  I await good news from True Person…" True Person Zhan Gui advised.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the two items and didn't linger, cupping his hands in farewell.</p><p>He had accepted the Dharma Decree, but he wasn't necessarily obligated to carry it out.</p><p>Not all predecessors could complete them. Failure meant starting over, but the True Stabilizing Pill was a one-time item.</p><p>True Person Swordbearer should have more information.  He would weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.</p><p>……</p><p>After seeing Qin Sang and True Person Swordbearer off, True Person Zhan Gui stood for a moment before walking towards the back hall.</p><p>An old Daoist was sitting in the back hall, with a half-played chess game set out before him.</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui sat opposite the chessboard, picking up a piece and pondering where to place it.</p><p>The old Daoist watched the chessboard and said, "Another expert has emerged from Ju Shan's domain?"</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui hummed in agreement. "This person took a Dharma Decree and cultivates the High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>The old Daoist looked up in surprise. "Not a disciple of the Thunder Mansion?"</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui nodded.</p><p>"Interesting." The old Daoist clicked his tongue and shook his head repeatedly. "Cultivating only Dharma, not scriptures, yet able to enter Profound Clarity, this is no ordinary individual!  Such a pity, such a pity…"</p><p>‘Clack!’</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui placed his piece, considering it a brilliant move.  He picked up his jade cup and took a sip.  "Are you so certain that this person cannot succeed?  Could it be that the Right Mansion's Sect Master also failed to contemplate a deity?"</p><p>The old Daoist pointed at True Person Zhan Gui.  "After all these years, your insight remains as sharp as ever. You can't hide even the slightest clue from me.  Indeed, the Right Mansion's Sect Master gave up.  Generations of disciples from the Thunder Mansion have tried one after another, all in vain…  Hmm, perhaps this person has profound fortune and can succeed. Wouldn't that herald a turning point?"</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui sighed softly. "How tragic! How lamentable!  In ancient times, the Jade Mansion of Thunder was on par with our Heavenly Hub Institute and the North Pole Exorcism Institute, perhaps even surpassing them. The Thunder Authority Commander was so majestic, hailed as the foremost expert in Thunder Dharma, invoking the Thunder Ancestor and commanding all thunder! Just reading the records in the scriptures makes my blood boil. To think it has fallen to this!"</p><p>"It's all in the past!"</p><p>The old Daoist shook his head.  "The Thunder Department deities are dormant, with only a few remaining. The magnificent High Divine Xiaoxiao Dharma, its third-stage Dharma has no deity to invoke, and even the lower stages have few responders.  Isn't its decline inevitable?"</p><p>As he spoke, the old Daoist suddenly picked up a piece and slapped it onto the board, laughing heartily.  "With you so distracted, it seems I am destined to win this game today!"</p><p>True Person Zhan Gui was startled and hurriedly looked at the chessboard.</p>
