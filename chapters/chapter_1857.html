<h1>Chapter 1848: Entanglement</h1><p>A stone pavilion stood alone, perfectly positioned at the convergence of three illusory landscapes, surrounded by constantly shifting strange phenomena.</p><p>The golden light intensified the changes, making them even more bizarre and unpredictable.</p><p>However, the fluctuations from the three illusory landscapes couldn't penetrate the pavilion's interior; it seemed protected by an invisible barrier.</p><p>Regardless of the external chaos, the pavilion remained serene—a rare sight within the entire ritual grounds.</p><p>Several demon cultivators, some standing, some seated, were taking refuge inside.</p><p>Some were sensing the changes in the Yuan Tai Formation's spiritual energy, while others were fixated on the Diamond Bodhi Tree, licking their lips, greed flashing in their eyes.</p><p>But upon catching sight of the black-robed young man meditating in the center of the pavilion, they quickly suppressed their avarice, not daring to act rashly.</p><p>"Your Highness, the formation is complete.  The area is locked; there should be no mistake…"</p><p>The long-bearded elder, always standing respectfully beside the black-robed youth, bowed slightly and spoke respectfully.</p><p>The black-robed youth was a demon king, known as Ling You Wang.</p><p>The other demon lords turned their gazes to Ling You Wang, awaiting his orders.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Ling You Wang opened his eyes, revealing unsettling black eyes devoid of whites, as if capable of absorbing all light.</p><p>Even though the demon lords were prepared, the sight of Ling You Wang's eyes still sent a shiver down their spines, making them even more deferential.</p><p>Only the long-bearded elder remained calm, pointing towards where the Yuan Tai Formation's spiritual energy converged.</p><p>"Hehehe, it's time to act…"</p><p>Ling You Wang's laughter was as strange as his eyes.  The demon lords felt an inexplicable chill upon hearing it.</p><p>Before his words fully faded, Ling You Wang stood up, casually glanced at the direction the long-bearded elder indicated, and vanished from the pavilion.</p><p>A black cloth instantly appeared beneath his feet. Its surface was pitch-black, with only a few thin, crisscrossing golden lines dividing it into squares, as if a piece had been cut from a chessboard.</p><p>The black cloth rotated and expanded.  The chaotic phenomena around it calmed down.</p><p>Ling You Wang walked through the air with his hands behind his back. With each step, the black cloth moved a considerable distance forward, and the strange phenomena along the way subsided, creating a clear path.</p><p>The demon lords quickly followed, but soon noticed something amiss.</p><p>Ling You Wang was heading towards the Diamond Bodhi Tree.</p><p>"Your Highness intends to retrieve the Diamond Fruit first?"</p><p>The long-bearded elder asked hesitantly.</p><p>Ling You Wang said indifferently, "Heaven offers a gift; to refuse it is to invite misfortune."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>The long-bearded elder hesitated. They weren't close to the Diamond Bodhi Tree. Taking a detour to obtain the fruit might jeopardize the main objective.</p><p>Among these demon lords, only he dared to question Ling You Wang's decision.</p><p>Ling You Wang didn't get angry; he let out an ambiguous chuckle.  "With so many experts, one more or one less makes no difference. I won't compete for the merit; they might even be grateful to me."</p><p>The demon lords were all stunned.  They looked at each other, unsure of how to react.</p><p>Earlier, Ling You Wang had ordered them to stay in the pavilion, which they interpreted as a strategic move to conserve their energy and wait for the opportune moment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ling You Wang didn't intend to participate at all; he was going to pick the fruit at a crucial moment.</p><p>Several demon kings had reduced their cultivation to enter the ritual grounds, showing the importance of the object of contention.</p><p>If he didn't want to participate, why did Ling You Wang reduce his cultivation? Wasn't he afraid of jeopardizing the mission, incurring the Great Sage's wrath, and becoming a fugitive in Gui Fang Country?</p><p>The demon lords were baffled. They looked towards the distance.  Was there some hidden mechanism in the Yuan Tai Formation that guaranteed success, allowing Ling You Wang to be so confident?</p><p>"Well, anyone eager to earn merit can go ahead. Don't blame me later; I won't stop you," Ling You Wang suddenly turned, scanned everyone, and said calmly.</p><p>Upon meeting his black eyes, the demon lords felt a chill down their spines and quickly shook their heads.</p><p>Merit was nothing compared to their lives!</p><p>This battle would be extremely fierce. They were already anxious, fearing they wouldn't survive.</p><p>Ling You Wang's action gave them a reason to stay away from the storm, which suited them perfectly.</p><p>Compared to their safety, the Diamond Fruit was secondary.</p><p>Even if something went wrong, Ling You Wang would be the one to take the blame.</p><p>…</p><p>Green flames floated in the void.</p><p>Each green flame resembled a ghost fire, seemingly light and flitting around.</p><p>However, the green flames were extremely dense, forming a sea of fire.  As they moved, they collided, merging and splitting.</p><p>Each merging and splitting process emitted a peculiar wave, seemingly gentle to the naked eye, like a soft breeze swaying the green flames. It posed no immediate danger.</p><p>Then, a white light suddenly shot out from the edge of the fire sea.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Runes flickered within the white light; it was a talismanic sword. Its energy, like a rainbow, cleaved the fire sea.</p><p>A distinct fissure formed at the edge of the fire sea, but the powerful sword light was rapidly dimming, fading away at an alarming rate.</p><p>The wave, harmless by-product of the green flames' collision, was 'consuming' the talismanic sword.</p><p>Clearly, appearances were deceptive; the fire sea concealed danger.</p><p>As the sword light vanished, a pure blue light emanated from the fissure.  The blue light possessed a strange, calming energy, yet it was itself restless, surging towards the fissure's opening.</p><p>At the moment the fissure began to close, the blue light burst from the fire sea, revealing six figures, somewhat disheveled.</p><p>Dressed in Daoist robes, some scorched, they emerged with expressions of relief.  The blue light gradually coalesced.</p><p>They stopped at the fire sea's edge, gazing back with apprehension.  Their experience had left them shaken. They hadn't even reached the deepest part of the Altar yet, and had already encountered such a perilous illusion, narrowly escaping a fatal setback.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>A white-haired Daoist, in the center of the group, clutched his chest and coughed violently.  The blue light finally retreated into a jade orb held in his other hand – the very object they had used to defend against the green flames.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Senior Left!”</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing the white-haired Daoist’s ashen face and poor condition, the others were startled. They all knew his true identity.</p><p>He was once a Grand Daoist, holding the high rank of From Third Rank, Upper Minister of the Nine Heavens Golden Que, Deputy Envoy of the Heavenly Pivot Academy, and concurrently a judge in the Academy.</p><p>However, years ago, he had resigned from his position, withdrawing from the world.  Thus, they addressed him as Senior.</p><p>His absence led to much speculation: some thought he had failed a tribulation or was in seclusion; others believed that his exceptional talent had earned him permission from the Daoist Court to cultivate in seclusion, possibly reaching the mid or late stage of the Five Talismans rank.</p><p>Therefore, the news of his self-reduction of cultivation level had been quite shocking.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>The Daoist, Senior Left, put away the orb and waved his hand.</p><p>But their concern remained evident.  Given his strength, the illusion's dangers shouldn't have injured him so severely.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they had first encountered a demon unexpectedly, and were ambushed. Senior Left, to protect everyone, had taken a blow from the demon king, sustaining an injury.  Barely escaping, they were then caught in a surge of golden light that destabilized the illusion, causing the normally mild green flames to intensify suddenly. They were overwhelmed before they could react.  Senior Left, acting swiftly, shielded them from the initial onslaught, but worsened his own injuries.</p><p>“How serious is Senior's injury?”</p><p>a Daoist anxiously asked.</p><p>Their cultivation bases were strong, and they could handle the illusion's dangers with caution, but Senior Left's injury was a concern. If they encountered the demon king, the situation would be dire. Even with the demon king’s self-reduction in power, they did not consider themselves a match for him.</p><p>Senior Left suppressed his turbulent breath, looked towards where the energy of the Yuantai Grand Array converged, took out a jade talisman and sensed it for a moment, then said: “My Daoist foundation is damaged, and I need to suppress my injuries immediately, otherwise I'll become a burden. But this matter is crucial, and one more person means more strength. You go ahead, rendezvous with Daoist Qi, you should still have time…”</p><p>He pointed south, giving detailed instructions.</p><p>Understanding the urgency, the others immediately obeyed, leaving one behind. “The Altar is unstable, and Senior is injured; Daoist Liu will protect Senior.”</p><p>They had just learned that Senior Left cultivated the Golden Seal Altar and didn't command demon soldiers.</p><p>Senior Left’s injuries were worsening; his face was pale, he nodded with closed eyes, moved away from the green flames, found a safe spot, and took medicine to treat his wounds.</p><p>Daoist Liu stayed beside him, vigilant, yet his gaze kept being drawn to the Vajra Bodhi tree. They could no longer see it when they escaped, only a fading golden light. They hadn't had the chance to examine it carefully; none of them, including the departed Daoists, had noticed the Vajra Bodhi.</p><p>A radiant light lay between them and their target.  Knowing that Left True Person might pass that way after his recovery, and uncertain of the phenomenon's meaning, Right True Person couldn't help but stare.</p><p>…</p><p>As teams of cultivators and demon cultivators advanced toward their objectives, Qin Sang was also in motion.</p><p>He emerged from the flower field space, wings sprouting from his back, transforming into a streak of lightning that tore through the air.</p><p>The ritual grounds were in chaos, fraught with peril.  Many illusions, once familiar to Qin Sang from his numerous journeys, were now completely altered, rendering his escape techniques ineffective.</p><p>However, relying on his understanding of the grounds and aided by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, he constantly changed direction, weaving and avoiding, always managing to escape danger without significantly slowing his pace.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on the Diamond Bodhi tree.</p><p>As time passed, the tree's shadow receded faster and faster.  Qin Sang could only try to discern every detail, to infer the tree's location and his distance from it.</p><p>"It seems not too far…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The speed at which the shadow was disappearing was too rapid. He knew, at this rate, he couldn't reach it before the shadow vanished completely.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang had committed every detail of the area surrounding the shadow to memory.</p><p>His only hope now was that no one else would beat him to it.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A cold gust of wind suddenly assaulted him from below.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze remained fixed on the shadow, yet his reaction was instantaneous. He powerfully flapped his phoenix wings.</p><p>With a thunderous roar, his speed increased by fifty percent.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang had put distance between himself and the attack did the gust of wind arrive – a strange, silver tentacle.</p><p>The tentacle missed its target, writhing impotently in the air, its suckers greedily sucking, as if alive.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, however, had clearly seen the tentacle, and discovered it wasn't alone. The silver mist below churned, revealing thousands upon thousands of tentacles emerging from it, their tips all pointed at Qin Sang.</p><p>Hearing the 'whoosh, whoosh' of them tearing through the air, Qin Sang's scalp prickled.  He used his escape techniques to the fullest, narrowly avoiding the onslaught of countless tentacles.</p><p>Bursting free of the attack range, Qin Sang couldn't help but glance back. He remembered this place; before, this silver mist had been perfectly calm.  He never suspected it concealed such bizarre creatures.</p><p>Compared to the tentacles behind him, the surroundings seemed relatively calm and safe.</p><p>Ahead lay a field of shattered ruins.</p><p>This place must once have been a magnificent palace, but now nothing remained intact.  Not a single wall stood taller than a man; the collapsed sections were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Despite being ruins, there was something extraordinary about them.</p><p>Qin Sang had tried before and discovered the ruins were incredibly strong; he couldn't even chip off a single brick. Now, the ruins seemed to shimmer with a jade-like luster, truly remarkable.</p><p>He intentionally slowed his speed, observing carefully, confirming the ruins posed no immediate threat, when he suddenly froze, disappearing in a flash.</p><p>A short time later.</p><p>A flash of light flickered from the right side of the ruins, and several figures sped inside, their expressions wary as they surveyed the area.</p><p>These were Daoist True Persons.</p><p>Pressed for time, they couldn't conduct a thorough search.  Following their pre-determined strategy, two were sent to scout ahead while the others remained vigilant.</p><p>The two scouts reached the center of the ruins unharmed, indicating no danger.  The others then accelerated their pace.</p><p>The group swept through the ruins.</p><p>After their departure, a figure emerged from the edge of the ruins – Qin Sang, having hidden himself after spotting the unexpected visitors.</p><p>"Another top-tier expert!"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Daoists depart.</p><p>To avoid complications, Qin Sang only observed from a distance, but he sensed a threat emanating from one of the True Persons.</p><p>This person's strength was probably comparable to the old Daoist beside Wan True Person.</p><p>Besides the obvious officials, there were so many hidden experts; the depth of the Daoist Court's resources was beyond imagination.</p><p>If the other party hadn't been in such a hurry, they might have noticed him the moment he discovered them.</p><p>"There are countless masters in the ritual grounds! However, their target is definitely not the Diamond Bodhi…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased slightly.</p><p>As he had suspected, these individuals were rushing to the place where the array's spiritual energy converged; that was the battlefield between the Daoist Court and Gui Fang, the Diamond Bodhi tree merely an unexpected encounter.</p><p>Judging by their urgency, the object of their pursuit must be incredibly important.</p><p>Therefore, his opponents shouldn't be too strong.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang felt relieved, a smile gracing his lips as he transformed into a streak of lightning, streaking across the ruined area.</p><p>The golden light was receding.</p><p>Qin Sang navigated through familiar yet unfamiliar illusions, his eyes fixed on the ancient tree.</p><p>However, he could no longer see the shadow clearly; only a hazy golden flame, slowly fading.</p><p>Finally, even the flame extinguished, showing no signs of having been taken.</p><p>"I should be close, somewhere in this illusion. I wonder if anyone is already searching…"</p><p>Qin Sang folded his wings, his presence and form simultaneously disappearing, melting into the shadows.</p>
