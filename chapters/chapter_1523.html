<h1>Chapter 1514: The Heavens Change (4k)</h1><p>Deep within the Sacred Ground.</p><p>The darkness receded.</p><p>Rainbow light pierced the void.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda descended.</p><p>At the final moment, the shrill cries of fiend-devils could still be heard from the base of the pagoda. As the Exquisite Pagoda settled, the cries abruptly ceased.</p><p>The place where the Exquisite Pagoda landed was precisely where the stone stele had been.</p><p>The stone stele had vanished, replaced by a colossal pagoda radiating a seven-colored halo, its entrance already sealed.</p><p>The void trembled, and the aftershocks continued to surge. The mist surrounding the pagoda was shaken outwards, and the rainbow light penetrated the mist, spreading out in a hazy glow.</p><p>Even on the floating mountain outside, one could clearly see the rosy clouds filling the sky deep within the Sacred Ground, lingering for a long time.</p><p>Many cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace, including Tong Lingyu, looked up at the Exquisite Pagoda, dumbfounded.</p><p>When the anomaly occurred, they had a premonition that staying in the space of the stone stele might not end well. They hadn't expected the power of the Exquisite Pagoda to far exceed their imagination, suppressing all the fiend-devils inside!</p><p>Tong Lingyu and the others were shocked by the scene before them, finding it hard to believe.</p><p>The space of the stone stele had inexplicably opened, and a pagoda had appeared deep within the Sacred Ground. They didn't know what kind of impact this would bring.</p><p>At least for now, it wasn't bad. The ones suffering were their enemies.</p><p>At the moment the Exquisite Pagoda descended, the rainbow light was at its most brilliant, then gradually weakened.</p><p>Deep within the rainbow light, the Exquisite Pagoda rapidly shrank, returning to its normal size, shimmering brilliantly.</p><p>However, as time passed, the rainbow light faded until it vanished. The Exquisite Pagoda also lost all its luster, becoming an ordinary gray-white stone pagoda.</p><p>Its texture was very similar to the previous stone stele.</p><p>"Grand Elder..."</p><p>Elder Mei, confirming that the Mixed-Devil Elder was suppressed at the base of the pagoda, breathed a sigh of relief. She flashed over to Tong Lingyu's side and whispered a few words.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced sideways at Hall Master Jiang, then flew to the stone pagoda. She circled it, but couldn't find an entrance.</p><p>The stone pagoda, replacing the previous stone stele, stood alone there.</p><p>Everyone had the same question in their minds: Where were the Liuli Couple?</p><p>Was the seal of the stone pagoda related to them?</p><p>At the final moment, fiend-devils had appeared in unison, but only the Liuli Couple were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Could they have encountered danger inside, even been surrounded by fiend-devils, only managing to send out a warning?</p><p>Just then, the cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace became agitated. Affected by the stone pagoda, the nearby spatial乱流s were intensifying. If this continued, the level of danger would soon approach that of the deepest part of the Sacred Ground.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's delicate brows furrowed. She glanced around and said, "Hall Master Jiang and I will stay. Elder Mei, you lead the others to pursue those fiend-devil remnants. It's best to capture one alive to find out what exactly happened inside."</p><p>With major threats like the Mixed-Devil Elder and Heavenly Roc suppressed at the base of the pagoda, the remaining fiend-devils couldn't stir up much trouble. There was no need for her to act personally.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Elder Mei accepted the order and left.</p><p>After discussing with Hall Master Jiang, Tong Lingyu tried various methods, but couldn't even touch the stone pagoda, let alone open it.</p><p>The spatial乱流s grew more intense, and Hall Master Jiang was also forced to retreat. Tong Lingyu never saw Qin Sang and Liuli emerge from within.</p><p>If it came to the closing time of the Sacred Ground, she wouldn't be able to stop it and could only lead her people to leave first.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu always felt that Qin Sang couldn't be suppressed so easily. The more she looked at the Exquisite Pagoda, the more familiar it seemed. She couldn't help but think of the seven-story pagoda Qin Sang had taken from the Profound Heaven Palace's treasury.</p><p>Was there any connection between the two pagodas?</p><p>Yin Changsheng had essentially died by his hand. How could such a person be simple?</p><p>Even with the Mixed-Devil Elder and the Great Sage Heavenly Roc joining forces, they might not have been able to hold him!</p><p>Unknowingly, it was almost time for the Sacred Ground to close. Tong Lingyu received a signal and flew back, seeing the astonished expression on Elder Mei's face.</p><p>Elder Mei reported the information she had gathered in detail. The more she spoke, the more shocked she became, unable to believe that Qin Sang's strength had reached such a terrifying level.</p><p>Elder Mei finally understood why the Mixed-Devil Elder's counterattack had not been very fierce. The couple had nearly taken the Mixed-Devil Elder's life in front of everyone!</p><p>"They entered the Exquisite Pagoda of their own accord, holding a small pagoda. The anomaly was likely orchestrated by them. There might be other mysteries within the pagoda!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't believe that Qin Sang would willingly perish together with the fiend-devils. However, the information she had was too scarce. She didn't even know the origin of the small pagoda in her sect's treasury, making it impossible to analyze.</p><p>At this time, only the members of the Profound Heaven Palace remained in the Sacred Ground. All the other fiend-devils had already fled.</p><p>Tong Lingyu led her people to guard the entrance of the Sacred Ground, waiting until the last moment. Still, there was no sign of Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang was also helpless, watching as the Sacred Ground closed.</p><p>The Bright-Feathered Bird, pulling the treasure carriage, prostrated itself at Tong Lingyu's feet.</p><p>This spirit bird was highly intelligent. Seeing that its master hadn't appeared, it had a realization and chose to submit to the strongest person present, completely unlike its previous arrogant demeanor. Another reason was that it sensed the aura of the Profound Heaven Token on Tong Lingyu.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>The hurricane howled in their ears.</p><p>The entrance to the Sacred Ground rapidly shrank, finally becoming a black line before completely disappearing.</p><p>Tong Lingyu looked around.</p><p>This trip to the Sacred Ground had been unprecedentedly chaotic. The Profound Heaven Palace had suffered heavy losses, with most of the casualties caused by internal strife.</p><p>She had thought that they would have to lie low for a while after returning. Unexpectedly, there had been a dramatic turnaround. The fate of the fiend-devils was even more tragic, almost completely wiped out.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace remained a top power in the Northern Sea!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin is truly bold. When this news spreads, the Northern Sea will surely be shaken. The infamy of this couple will be pushed to an unprecedented level. It's just unknown where they are now..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Tong Lingyu's mind. She summoned her spirit boat and led her disciples back to the nameless island.</p><p>Using the Profound Heaven Token and her own token, she opened the spirit formation and left her disciples on the island. Then, she left the island with Hall Master Jiang and the others, planning to search the nearby sea area for a while longer.</p><p>The cultivators on the island sensed the heavy atmosphere. After discovering that the Palace Master and the merchant leader were missing, the disciples of the two lineages were even more uneasy. However, without the Grand Elder's permission, no one could activate the teleportation formation.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli had already been transported out of the Sacred Ground by the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>At the last moment, they only felt their bodies bound by a tremendous force. Their vision blurred, and then they heard the whistling wind, realizing they had been thrown into the storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang had nearly been drained dry by the pagoda and immediately stuffed several pills into his mouth.</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>The location of the transportation seemed to be random. There were no teleportation formations nearby.</p><p>The hurricane was relentless, and the scenery around them was monotonous. They didn't have any Ice Demon Crystals, so they couldn't sense the location of the Sacred Ground.</p><p>"The Exquisite Pagoda shouldn't have transported us too far. We must still be in the Southern Region. As long as we head north, we can return to the Northern Sea..."</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head and said to Liuli.</p><p>Liuli nodded, flicking her jade-like finger. A wisp of green light flew from her fingertip. The green light circled her finger once and transformed into a green flying shuttle.</p><p>The shuttle was slender, with pointed ends. A wisp of green energy surrounded the shuttle, flowing continuously, like a green silk ribbon, making it appear extremely light and full of spiritual energy.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Liuli said, "This is Master's Ten-Direction Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle. Its speed is only mediocre, but it can save us some energy."</p><p>In the past, Bing Yao had relied on the Ten-Direction Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle to travel around with Liuli, who was in the Qi Refining stage, and pass through the storm belt.</p><p>This was one of the few treasures Bing Yao had left for Liuli.</p><p>Both of them, including Qin Sang's incarnation, had consumed a great deal of their true essence.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Liuli into the divine shuttle, discovering that the space inside was not large, but it didn't feel stuffy.</p><p>Inside the divine shuttle, the surrounding scenery was clearly visible, allowing them to react to any situation at any time.</p><p>The divine shuttle seemed to have a built-in defense, and they couldn't feel any turbulence inside.</p><p>Liuli silently urged her true essence, and the divine shuttle transformed into a streak of green light, piercing through the air. It was like a wisp of clear wind dancing between the hurricanes, shuttling through them, light and agile.</p><p>Qin Sang then remembered to take out the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, drawing in the moonlight to confirm that their direction was correct.</p><p>...</p><p>Tong Lingyu led her people to search for a long time without success. She herself went to the entrance of the Sacred Ground several times to check.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang and Liuli had long since left the storm belt and found an island to recuperate.</p><p>Their injuries weren't serious, mostly sustained from their clash with Yin Changsheng. They had consumed only a few pills to recover their true essence, all of which were top-grade spirit medicines. The medicinal power accumulated in their bodies wasn't a burden.</p><p>Circulating their profound techniques, they quickly recovered by seventy to eighty percent. They then flew towards the nameless island together, coincidentally encountering Hall Master Jiang along the way.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and Liuli, Hall Master Jiang was overjoyed. He had almost given up.</p><p>"Good! Good! Good! It's good that you're back!"</p><p>Hall Master Jiang was greatly relieved. He sent back a message, and the three of them flew unhurriedly.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that Hall Master Jiang's attitude towards him had changed. There was a clear reverence, and even towards Liuli, he no longer had the casualness he had previously shown towards a junior.</p><p>With a turn of his mind, Qin Sang guessed that the events of the battle in the stone stele space might have spread. He smiled inwardly, not paying it any mind.</p><p>From Hall Master Jiang, he learned of the fate of the Mixed-Devil Elder, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, and the other fiend-devils. Qin Sang's expression eased slightly.</p><p>This time, he and the fiend-devils had become sworn enemies.</p><p>If the Mixed-Devil Elder and Heavenly Roc had escaped, although he wasn't afraid, he wouldn't be comfortable being constantly targeted by major enemies, like a thorn in his back.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected that Tong Lingyu wouldn't let the fiend-devils escape, but unforeseen events could always occur.</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't disappointed.</p><p>Not long after, the three of them landed on the nameless island.</p><p>The cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace had received the news long ago. At this moment, they all walked out of their cave dwellings, as if welcoming distinguished guests.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, everyone couldn't help but reveal expressions of reverence, along with a trace of fear.</p><p>For no other reason than that he had suppressed so many fiend-devils in one fell swoop, it was too shocking. Even Yin Changsheng, who had been regarded as a god by the Profound Heaven Palace, had never achieved such an astonishing feat.</p><p>Although there was some trickery involved, using an ancient formation and ancient treasures, the battle before entering the Exquisite Pagoda was real.</p><p>After the death of the Palace Master, this person was probably the number one expert in the Northern Sea!</p><p>Tong Lingyu, Elder Mei, and the others personally came to greet them. One after another, obscure gazes, either scrutinizing or wary, converged on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, cupped his hands in greeting, causing everyone to hastily return the gesture.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang became somewhat impatient listening to the praise.</p><p>Tong Lingyu saw this and dismissed the others, leaving only Qin Sang, sitting opposite her.</p><p>"With this battle, Fellow Daoist Qin will become famous throughout the world! You will achieve instant fame!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu said with a sigh, not envious. The Profound Heaven Palace had also gained substantial benefits.</p><p>She paused, then asked about the process, adding at the end, "If there's anything inconvenient for Fellow Daoist Qin to disclose, just consider my question presumptuous..."</p><p>"There's nothing that can't be said. Thanks to the legacy of Senior Xiaoxiangzi, I unexpectedly gathered two small pagodas, merging them into one, to manipulate the ancient formation. Now, the Futu Pagoda has been left inside the Exquisite Pagoda..."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained the relationship between Xiaoxiangzi, the Profound Heaven Palace, and the Pure Sea Sect, the origin of the small pagodas, and the reasons behind it all.</p><p>He also wanted the Profound Heaven Palace to help investigate Xiaoxiangzi, so he held almost nothing back.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't mention anything about the treasures inside the pagoda.</p><p>Tong Lingyu finally understood the ins and outs, realizing everything. She sighed, "Senior Xiaoxiangzi's dedication is admirable. We, the later generations, are ashamed! Fortunately, the seniors of the Pure Sea Sect lived up to his expectations and didn't cause a great disaster. After returning, I will order my disciples to spread the glorious deeds of Senior Xiaoxiangzi and the Pure Sea Sect, erecting steles and writing biographies. We can't let their sacrifices be in vain..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, indicating that he would also do his utmost to assist.</p><p>The two discussed for a while, finalized the plan, and then exchanged some information about this trip to the Sacred Ground.</p><p>At the end of the conversation, Tong Lingyu smiled and asked, "I want to recommend Fellow Daoist to take over the position of Grand Elder. What does Fellow Daoist think?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang said with a slight surprise, "I'm still an outsider. Can I still be the Grand Elder?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded, saying confidently, "Fellow Daoist Qin and Liuli are Dao companions, and you've made great contributions. No one in the sect will object. Why not? If not for the fact that the position of Palace Master must be passed down through the direct line of the Profound Heaven lineage, even if Fellow Daoist were to become the Palace Master, no one would dare to question it!"</p><p>"If I become the Grand Elder, what about you, Fellow Daoist Tong? A gentleman doesn't take what others desire. I'm wholeheartedly devoted to the Dao and don't have the energy to handle the sect's affairs," Qin Sang said without hesitation, shaking his head in refusal.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's eyes flashed, and she looked troubled. "To be honest, I need to help Senior Brother Luo heal his injuries and focus on my breakthrough. I don't know how much time it will take. Currently, there's no Palace Master, and I can't be distracted. If Fellow Daoist is unwilling to come forward, the Profound Heaven Palace will be like a dragon without a head, and chaos may arise..."</p><p>"How about letting Hall Master Jiang take over the position of Grand Elder?"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to see through Tong Lingyu's thoughts. He chuckled softly, not bothering to probe, and simply spoke directly, giving her a push.</p><p>"Both are main lineages. Why must the position of Palace Master belong to the Profound Heaven lineage? Yin Changsheng is dead, and Fellow Daoist Luo is in a deep sleep, his future uncertain. No one in the Profound Heaven lineage is capable of taking on the great responsibility. Should the position be left vacant? Such an unreasonable rule should be changed. I think, regardless of cultivation or talent, no one is more suitable than Fellow Daoist Tong. Fellow Daoist Tong perceived Yin Changsheng's treacherous intentions and didn't run away, risking your life to contend with him. Who can match this courage and dedication to protecting the sect?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu stared at Qin Sang for a long time. "Fellow Daoist Qin is joking. This matter is of great importance. Let's just treat it as a joke in private. Don't..."</p><p>"Which lineage are you worried about objecting?"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted Tong Lingyu. "The Heavenly Mountain lineage or the Profound Heaven lineage? Yin Changsheng and Shang Lu made a huge mistake, almost placing the Profound Heaven Palace in a state of eternal damnation. Could it be that there were only a few masterminds, and no one aided the wicked?"</p><p>With his personality, he generally wouldn't get involved in such matters. However, the cultivation resources of the Profound Heaven Palace were too abundant. Even just dividing a main lineage would be enough to feed the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang himself could also take advantage of the chaos to seek benefits.</p><p>Following the trend, he wouldn't refuse.</p><p>He didn't believe that Tong Lingyu had no such thoughts. He was just speaking for her.</p><p>It was time for the heavens of the Profound Heaven Palace to change!</p>
