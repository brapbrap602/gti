<h1>Chapter 1607: A Glimpse of a Back</h1><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Jiang You into the back hall of the residence and saw a wooden frame, two men tall, placed on the ground. A bronze gong hung from the frame’s crossbeam.</p><p>This kind of gong had three faces.</p><p>Without anyone touching it, the gong swayed on its own, emitting a faint yellow halo.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, sensing the presence of a spirit array nearby, part of which converged on the gong.</p><p>“This treasure is called the Seven-Tone Gong. It's a special Buddhist artifact. The Hall Master acquired it at a high price after the incident at the last Exchange Meet.”</p><p>Jiang You drew a ‘�d’ character in the air and flicked it toward the gong.  It vanished into the yellow light with a flash. The gong hummed, suddenly becoming still, its light receding, but its connection to the spirit array became more subtle.</p><p>“Set up corresponding formations in the vicinity. This treasure is extremely sensitive to spiritual fluctuations.  It prevents anyone from harboring ill intentions at the auction and the Exchange Meet, especially sensitive to demonic energy.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, inwardly amused that the Six Continents Hall was once bitten by a snake and now feared well ropes for ten years.</p><p>The last time demonic beings infiltrated the Exchange Meet, the Six Continents Hall lost face and became a laughingstock. If it happened again, they would truly become a joke.</p><p>The mundane affairs of the hall were not Qin Sang's responsibility. He only needed to make an appearance at the auction and the Exchange Meet.</p><p>After seeing Jiang You off, Qin Sang stayed in his cave dwelling for a while before leaving the Six Continents Hall branch and wandering aimlessly through Rainbow City.</p><p>The first Grand Auction would be held on the morning of the day after tomorrow, divided into Golden Core and Nascent Soul sessions. The auctions specifically for low-level cultivators had already opened in the south city several days ago, with unlimited sessions.</p><p>All Nascent Soul cultivators entering Rainbow City received invitations, and Qin Sang was no exception.</p><p>So far, no treasure list had been leaked, but the grand pronouncements of the Golden Jade Gate made everyone anticipate it greatly.</p><p>Rainbow City was overflowing with people.</p><p>Qin Sang unknowingly walked to the main peak.</p><p>Nascent Soul Grandmasters, rarely seen in the past, Qin Sang encountered several shortly after ascending the main peak. There were also a few with obscure auras, suspected to be cultivators above mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Rainbow City was a place where dragons and tigers were hidden.  Rashly using divine sense to probe could easily cause misunderstandings.</p><p>Qin Sang simply treated it as sightseeing, avoiding contact with others, and slowly ascended to the peak of the main peak, leaning on the railing to gaze out.</p><p>The main peak was the center of all peaks north of the river.  Westward, one could see myriad mountains; eastward, a vast ocean; all other peaks appeared small.</p><p>A nine-story building stood atop the main peak, built of gold and jade, standing out from the crowd, the epitome of luxury, called the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Golden Jade Tower was a property of the Golden Jade Gate.  The Grand Auction the day after tomorrow would be held here.</p><p>Qin Sang had little contact with the Golden Jade Gate, but from past rumors and the impression he gained from seeing it now, it didn't feel like an Immortal Sect, even more ostentatious than the Six Continents Hall, a merchant guild.</p><p>Perhaps the Golden Jade Gate had a unique heritage.</p><p>Cultivation methods could change a cultivator's temperament, thereby influencing the atmosphere of a sect.</p><p>Qin Sang passed by the Golden Jade Tower, glancing at it without any intention of entering. Just as he was about to head in another direction, his eyebrows furrowed almost imperceptibly.</p><p>Just now, it seemed a probing gaze had fallen upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense had greatly improved, and his spiritual perception was acute. He knew it was definitely not an illusion. This gaze was different from others. The other party was very interested in him!</p><p>He quickly took in the surroundings of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>To the right of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>A female Nascent Soul cultivator was arm in arm with a handsome young man, walking towards him.</p><p>The young man was only at the mid-Golden Core stage and seemed unaware of the female cultivator's true cultivation. His behavior was frivolous and casual, and the female cultivator played along, charming and lovely, looking at the young man with admiring eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang could see the profound indifference in the depths of the female Nascent Soul cultivator's eyes.  Recalling some rumors about the Demonic Sect's  伏天谷 , if the young man didn't wake up in time, his fate probably wouldn't be good.</p><p>A Daoist emerged from the Golden Jade Tower. Judging by his attire, he was an expert from the Silent Zen Mountain Manor.  He glanced at the female cultivator but didn't interfere, his movements uncanny as he blended into the crowd and disappeared.</p><p>Two levels of stairs down, there was a Nascent Soul Daoist couple, whispering sweet nothings to each other.</p><p>…</p><p>The images of each cultivator flashed through Qin Sang's mind, eliminated one by one.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly was also silently using its divine ability.</p><p>Everything was normal, nothing unusual!</p><p>“An illusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe his spiritual sense was wrong, but that person had indeed disappeared, or their disguise technique was so sophisticated that even he couldn't see through it.</p><p>He maintained his pace, walking past the Golden Jade Tower without revealing anything. After strolling around the other peaks, he finally returned to the Six Continents Hall residence. It was already nightfall, and that feeling had not reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it and organized his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Only one Soul Calming Incense remained, and the two crocodile demon skeletons should fetch a good price. The Soul Calming Incense formula could also be sold, but good steel should be used on the blade.</p><p>From his observations, even in the prosperous Middle Continent, gathering all the spiritual ingredients for the Soul Calming Incense was extremely difficult.</p><p>Those who could afford it and had the ability to refine the Soul Calming Incense were few and far between.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to wait until he had the energy to first gather the rarest spiritual ingredients before considering selling the formula.</p><p>Moonlight was like a veil.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the quiet courtyard outside the window, pondering to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, a gong sound broke the silence!</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The three faces of the gong sounded simultaneously.</p><p>The gong’s sound was crisp and clear, audible throughout the entire compound.</p><p>The Seven-Tone Gong!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He abruptly stood up and appeared above the courtyard in the next moment.</p><p>At the same time, figures rushed out from various locations.  The Six Continents Hall experts were all awakened, and everyone's gaze focused on the back hall of the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>That was where the Six Continents Hall treasury was located, personally guarded by Vice Hall Master Jiang You!</p><p>Yellow light soared from the back hall, the gong's sound urgent.</p><p>A white figure silently appeared within the yellow light, as graceful as a swan, like a phantom.</p><p>A thunderous roar suddenly came from the back hall, Vice Hall Master Jiang You’s voice: “Stop him!”</p><p>At the same time, panicked shouts erupted from within.</p><p>“Not good! The Heaven Vault has been opened!”</p><p>“The restrictions have been broken…”</p><p>…</p><p>The Heaven Vault, the Six Continents Hall’s number one treasury, had been infiltrated silently. Only when the Seven-Tone Gong sounded the alarm did they discover the thief.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The white figure's movement technique was exceptionally profound, flashing out of the mountain into the void.</p><p>Only then did Jiang You rush out of the back hall, covered in transparent threads, his Daoist robe torn in many places, his figure disheveled, clearly having been delayed by the opponent's divine ability.</p><p>Jiang You was enraged. Seeing the white figure escaping, he hurriedly looked towards Qin Sang's cave dwelling. Seeing it empty, he felt relieved and quickly said, “Quickly pursue! Go assist Elder Qin!”</p><p>Leaving Jiang Mu and most of the remaining personnel to guard the treasury, Jiang You led the others in hot pursuit.</p><p>The commotion here alerted the cultivators on the nearby peaks. Some curious individuals secretly followed.</p><p>The Golden Jade Gate's patrolling cultivators also noticed the anomaly here and quickly activated their jade talismans to contact the sect's experts, urging their spiritual beasts towards this location.</p><p>At the forefront.</p><p>Although the white figure's escape technique was refined, trying to shake off Qin Sang was like a fool’s errand. Not long after rushing out of Rainbow City, they were caught up by Qin Sang.</p><p>“Where do you think you're going!”</p><p>Qin Sang bellowed.</p><p>A sword arc leaped out of the Thousand Jun Ring. The Golden Sink Sword, swift as a meteor, suddenly erupted with a thousand-zhang sword light. A river of sword energy tore through the air, descending directly.</p><p>The white figure seemed to glance back at Qin Sang. Facing the sword light above, they flicked their sleeve.  Without seeing the person use any magical treasure, a fierce wind erupted in the void.  Streaks of visible grey wind energy gathered, instantly transforming into a dark, murky gale that filled the sky.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The river of sword energy pierced into the gale without hesitation, like a red-hot iron, unstoppable.  A brilliant sword light shone within the gale. The gale churned, and streaks of grey wind energy frantically lunged at the sword light, transforming into tangible shackles, winding around it layer upon layer.</p><p>“Late Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, finally determining the opponent's cultivation.</p><p>Although the Six Continents Hall's treasury held many treasures, supreme treasures that would tempt a Grandmaster would not be stored here.</p><p>A Grandmaster lowering themselves to personally steal these minor treasures and getting caught red-handed seemed somewhat absurd.</p><p>“The treasures that this hall brought to Rainbow City were meant for auction. If fellow Daoist has any need, you only need to ask, and we would gladly gift them to you for free.  Why go through all this trouble!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted loudly.</p><p>A few mere treasures in exchange for befriending a Grandmaster, he believed Hall Master Mu had the魄力  to do so.</p><p>“The things I want, I always take directly!”</p><p>The white figure scoffed.</p><p>The last part of their laugh was somewhat distorted, because seeing that the sword light couldn't stop the white figure, Qin Sang changed his sword诀 .  The Golden Sink Sword vanished into thin air, and the void grew dim, engulfing the gale.</p><p>As the Seven Souls Killing Formation was deployed, the gale lost its target, swirling around within the sword formation like a headless fly, disintegrating under the onslaught of the sword threads.</p><p>The sword threads flashed brightly, instantly shredding the last of the gale.  Before the white figure could escape, the formation enveloped the space, narrowly trapping them inside.</p><p>Qin Sang stole a glance behind him.</p><p>This commotion had become quite large.</p><p>In addition to Jiang You and the others, many streaks of light were flying towards them, illuminating the night sky outside Rainbow City, far behind the two of them.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed several golden streaks of light among them, moving at a good speed.  It was the Golden Jade Gate's unique escape technique. He nodded inwardly. This was what he was waiting for.</p><p>Someone was causing trouble in Rainbow City, and the Golden Jade Gate was responsible.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were merely fulfilling his duties as a guest elder. He didn't want to fight to the death with a Grandmaster for the sake of the Six Continents Hall. Delaying the opponent and waiting for reinforcements to arrive was already the utmost he could do.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang recalled the feeling of being watched earlier that day.</p><p>That very night, a Grandmaster infiltrated the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Was it a coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Celestial Eye Butterfly to secretly monitor the surroundings. He hadn’t detected anything unusual yet.</p><p>“Not a bad sword formation, but you use it poorly! Your swordsmanship is still amateurish!”</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, the white figure showed no panic, instead letting out a sneer and mocking Qin Sang.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh’ sounds of something cutting through the air echoed within the sword formation.  Transparent threads shot out from the white figure, identical to the ones on Jiang You.</p><p>The white figure had clearly not used their full strength against Jiang You.</p><p>The threads wove a bizarre sight around the white figure. Countless threads intertwined, unexpectedly forming a lake suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The lake water was clear, just like a real lake.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The water surface bulged, and a giant formed of water climbed out of the lake. Its empty eyes stared at the myriad sword threads, letting out a furious roar. It raised its arm, its body twisting abruptly, and smashed a heavy fist into the sword formation!</p><p>The force of the punch was like thunder.</p><p>In an instant, the sword formation trembled, chaos erupting.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was grave.  He quickly made hand seals, the sword threads frantically contracting inwards, compressing the power of the sword formation to mend the breach created by the punch.</p><p>The white figure, however, had already seized the opportunity, suddenly appearing atop the water giant. They charged upwards, facing the incoming sword threads without panic, pointing a finger towards another part of the sword formation, and calmly said: “This formation should be mine to use!”</p><p>That was precisely the spot struck by the water giant where the sword formation's power had not yet recovered, the sword threads in disarray.</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to discover that the sword threads had completely slipped from his control. The connection was severed. Although it wasn’t the entire formation, just that area, it was a fatal flaw.</p><p>Even more shockingly, with a hook of the white figure's finger, those sword threads were controlled by them instead, turning against their ‘companions.’</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation fractured internally, the sword threads battling amongst themselves.</p><p>The white figure remained calm and composed.</p><p>“Full of flaws!”</p><p>The white figure's sneer reached Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, unable to retort.</p><p>After the sword formation had reached completion, enemies trapped within it usually only had the ability to defend. This was the first time it had been broken using such a bizarre method.</p><p>The water giant was still understandable, but Qin Sang couldn't comprehend what kind of divine ability the white figure had used in the end.</p><p>Unheard of!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The white figure rushed out of the sword formation, completely unharmed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they didn't choose to continue fleeing, but turned around, standing in the void and staring at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled at first, sensing something amiss, his heart sinking.  He flapped the phoenix wings on his back, transforming into a bolt of lightning, instantly shifting a thousand zhang away.</p><p>The moment he moved, the white figure appeared in his former position.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this scene once when fighting the Greenfurred Rat Demon, but the white figure's movements were more concealed and effortless, making them difficult to guard against.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The water giant roared.</p><p>Punch after punch smashed through the sword threads, its power astonishing.</p><p>The white figure could only control the sword threads briefly.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully regained control of the sword formation, trapping the water giant, and then focused on dealing with the white figure. The black lotus on his forehead flashed, and the Demonic Fire Dragon reappeared, charging straight towards the void to Qin Sang's left.</p><p>A resounding ‘boom’.</p><p>Ripples appeared in the void, and the white figure's shadow emerged.  Struck by the demonic fire, their entire body shattered like a mirror, then was completely engulfed and annihilated by the demonic fire.</p><p>The white figure used the same trick again, only to be exploited by Qin Sang.</p><p>However, there was no joy on Qin Sang's face. The white figure’s divine abilities were bizarre; they couldn’t be killed so easily.</p><p>His face was full of vigilance as he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>In the next moment, the small mountain below trembled violently.  A giant footprint appeared out of thin air, and the white figure materialized above it, their body swaying slightly as they drifted back more than ten zhang before steadily landing, their robes fluttering.</p><p>They had somehow neutralized the impact of the demonic fire with some kind of divine ability.</p><p>The small mountain suffered. The stones at its peak were crushed by the footprint, and the entire mountaintop cracked, centered on the footprint, the fissure reaching down to the bottom, spring water gushing forth.</p><p>The two exchanged blows twice, all within a split second.</p><p>It seemed neither could overcome the other. Qin Sang knew the opponent's terrifying strength. He was forced to use the demonic fire, yet could only maintain a defensive posture. He couldn't help but consider retreating.</p><p>The white figure steadied themselves, glancing back.</p><p>The pursuers were approaching.</p><p>They seemed unwilling to continue entanglement with Qin Sang.  They ceased their attack, raised a hand, and formed a hand seal. The water giant, which was struggling against the sword formation, stiffened, melting into a pool of water.</p><p>Then, the white figure's face shimmered, their features gradually becoming clear, revealing a beautiful woman in palace attire.</p><p>The beautiful woman looked Qin Sang up and down, her eyes fixed on the jade pendant at his waist.</p><p>“Somewhat capable, no wonder you were able to cross the storm and come from the North Sea.”</p>
