<h1>Chapter 1745: Blood Rainbow Pierces the Heavens, Crimson Star Falls Afar</h1><p>North Sea.</p><p>Qingyang Island.</p><p>Li Yu Fu sat calmly meditating on his jade couch, seemingly sensing something. He opened his eyes slightly, without any apparent movement.  He heard the resonant chime of a golden bell outside the hall, and a middle-aged Daoist priest quickly entered.</p><p>His bearing spoke of high status.</p><p>This person was the current head of the Qingyang Temple, whose dharma name was Zhi Zhen.</p><p>Entering the hall, Zhi Zhen showed respectful deference, quickly stepping forward to bow his head.  “Master, I’ve just received a message from the young master of Xuan Tian Palace.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu uttered an "Oh," aware of the recent unrest at sea.  “Has the Demon Island made another move?  Since the nine-headed serpent perished in its tribulation, has another great sage unified the island?”</p><p>While pondering, he drew on his true energy. A beam of light flew from Zhi Zhen's hand into his palm.  He examined it, his brow furrowing slightly.  “Go and summon Chi Lei…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Li Yu Fu’s expression changed drastically. He vanished in a flash.</p><p>Zhi Zhen, waiting for further instructions, rushed out of the hall. He saw Li Yu Fu standing in midair, hands behind his back, looking up.</p><p>He looked up as well, and his face paled in shock.</p><p>…</p><p>Central Plains.</p><p>Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>“Junior Sister, have you made your decision?”</p><p>Yun Xin Shi Tai stood before the statue of their founder, gently asking the kneeling Lili, who sat with her hands clasped together.</p><p>Lili nodded.  Her resolve was firm; once she made a decision, she never hesitated.</p><p>A look of relief flashed in Yun Xin Shi Tai's eyes. She smiled softly.  “Junior Sister, you haven’t taken your vows. Removing your nun’s hat is equivalent to returning to lay life.”</p><p>She thought to herself that she had been prescient in preventing Lili from taking vows, knowing that Lili's worldly attachments were not yet severed. Today, it proved true.</p><p>She gently lifted her hand and removed Lili's hat.</p><p>A cascade of black hair flowed down!</p><p>Yun Xin Shi Tai gently helped Lili up.  Together they bowed before the statue of their founder, murmuring.</p><p>“Our founder established Yan Yue Temple and entered the monastic life because she had experienced the bitterness of love and didn't want others to suffer the same.  Junior Sister is exceptionally gifted, and Qin Zhenjun is deeply devoted, certainly able to protect you through this ordeal. One day, you will ascend together and explore the universe!  Our ancestor's spirit in the afterlife will know her wish is fulfilled…”</p><p>Before she finished, both sensed something and looked at each other.  They left the hall together and looked up.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Whether in the North Sea, the Demon Sea, the Central Plains, or the West, anyone outdoors looking up at the sky could see a strange sight.</p><p>It was bright daylight, yet stars shone.</p><p>Thousands of stars filled the void, seemingly beyond the nine heavens, ethereal and illusory, like starlight shining from another world.</p><p>Soon, the starlight converged and fell from the sky.</p><p>Some people, thinking it was divine objects descending from the heavens, cried out in awe. But before the starlight landed, a blood-red rainbow suddenly appeared from somewhere, seemingly counteracting the starlight, and both vanished.</p><p>In an instant, the spectacle dissipated, the stars disappeared.</p><p>The whole event lasted only a few breaths. Heaven and earth returned to normal.</p><p>Yun Xin Shi Tai found it odd. With her cultivation, she could tell that the starlight and the blood rainbow were far away in the highest heavens, their location difficult to discern, possibly not even in the Central Plains.  She could only see extremely faint starlight and the rainbow, fleeting and ephemeral.</p><p>She couldn't see anything else, and had no idea where the anomaly came from or what it portended.</p><p>She subconsciously glanced at Lili beside her.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Lili's long hair swayed slightly.</p><p>Lili felt inexplicably uneasy, her brows furrowed, remaining motionless for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Waves crashed against each other.</p><p>Despite the lack of strong winds, the waves were unusually high. While cultivators were unfazed, ordinary people sailing would be at risk of capsizing.</p><p>The sunlight wasn't very bright, and the sea was almost inky black, making the daylight seem even dimmer.</p><p>This sea area stretched endlessly, flat and featureless, with no birds in sight. Only the sound of waves filled the heavens and earth, unchanging for ages.</p><p>Suddenly, a crack appeared in the sky.</p><p>A blazing red light poured out from the crack, like a crimson star falling from beyond the heavens, plummeting downwards, its final destination unknown.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A loud rumbling sound echoed from a nearby sea area.  Huge waves surged, and a gaping hole appeared in the sea. A sizzling sound could be heard, water vapor rising and instantly spreading for several miles.</p><p>In the sea pit.</p><p>A ball of fire continued to sink into the deep sea. Two shadowy figures were faintly visible inside, their breaths weak, exuding a strong smell of blood.</p><p>The next moment, one of them trembled, their eyes flashing with light, sensing their terrible injuries, their expression darkening.</p><p>However, to their perception, this seemed to be a vast ocean, with nothing nearby that threatened them.  They let out a relieved sigh.</p><p>"It seems it didn't follow me. Was it swept away by the spatial storm?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his face suddenly changing. He hurriedly looked at his avatar beside him.</p><p>At this moment, the avatar was completely disfigured, burning with black flames, and covered with dense black markings, like countless black runes, twisting like snakes, strangely ominous.</p><p>Within the avatar's body, the black markings had spread throughout, even invading its spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar shared a single consciousness; he sensed that these markings possessed no killing power, yet were strangely unusual. The avatar was helpless against them, unable to think of any way to resist.</p><p>Even more alarming was Qin Sang's feeling that the black markings could spread from the avatar to his main body!</p><p>If the markings were targeting the spirit, Qin Sang wouldn't have been afraid, but that clearly wasn't the case.</p><p>Furthermore, he didn't know how to remove the markings.  While uncertain of their purpose, given past experiences, he couldn't afford to ignore them.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned as cold as ice.  He made his decision, his fingertip touching the avatar's forehead. The light in the avatar's eyes instantly faded.</p><p>Immediately, the avatar's form drastically changed, shrinking into a palm-sized puppet.</p><p>He had voluntarily dismissed his second spirit body.  This external avatar, which had been with him for many years, ceased to exist, returning to the original form of the Dao Tree.</p><p>The moment the second spirit body dispersed, the invasive black markings abruptly stopped, seemingly sensing the host's death, faltered, then dissipated.</p><p>Confirming the disappearance of the disturbances, Qin Sang remained cautious.  Avoiding direct contact, he stored them in his storage ring.  With a tremor of his body, he leaped from the water, bursting through the white mist.  A vast ocean stretched before him, devoid of any sign of life.</p><p>Looking up at the sky, Qin Sang shook his sleeve, and the Sun God Tree fell into his palm.</p><p>"Zhuque?"</p><p>He called out, but received no answer.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the events.</p><p>He had activated the gateway, but at the moment of breaking through, he sensed a fatal threat, as if some monstrous being was pursuing him closely.</p><p>He instinctively prepared to summon the Sun God Bird to intercept the enemy, only to hear Zhuque scream— "I'm dead!"</p><p>Then, the true energy he was using to control the Sun God Bird was diverted to the roots of the Sun God Tree, surging towards the Celestial Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, immediately guessing Zhuque's intention. In this critical moment, he could only choose to trust it, pouring his true energy without reservation, like a bursting dam, instantly draining his powerful true energy almost completely.</p><p>Zhuque hadn't possessed the Celestial Phoenix Feather for long, but with the aid of Qin Sang's true energy, it actually managed to activate the feather, forcibly breaking free from the restraints, pressure, and spatial storm. Qin Sang was carried forward by the force of the Celestial Phoenix Feather, unsure of where he was being taken.</p><p>Under the threat of the monstrous being, he had no time to sense the starlight and didn't know if he had been brought to the upper realm by the guiding starlight.</p><p>At the last moment, a beam of blood light broke through the spatial storm, heading towards Qin Sang. With his true energy depleted, he had no choice but to send out his avatar to shield his main body. The avatar could only manage to summon its wooden armor and unleash a beam of ice soul light.</p><p>The wooden armor shattered instantly, its fragments scattering, leaving not a trace behind.</p><p>The remaining force of the blood light severely injured both Qin Sang and the avatar. The avatar, having taken the brunt of the attack, bore the full force. Even though Qin Sang's physical body was comparable to a transformed demon king, he felt pain throughout his body as if riddled with holes; his blood surged, his injuries critical.</p><p>He held the Sun God Tree, sensing the Zhuque Feather. Due to their oath, there was a faint connection between him and Zhuque. At this moment, he could perceive Zhuque's young spirit still fluctuating, likely in a deep sleep.</p><p>Probably due to the excessive consumption of forcibly using the Celestial Phoenix Feather.</p><p>"The young spirit hasn't dissipated…that's good…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart eased slightly, choosing not to disturb Zhuque.</p><p>This was fortunate in misfortune; although he had lost his external avatar, at least he hadn't been captured by that monstrous being.</p><p>"Is this the Great Thousand World?"</p><p>Besides water, he found nothing, but Qin Sang could ascertain one thing: he could no longer sense the Dao Mark Gate!</p><p>And the Heavenly Demon's voice was gone!</p><p>He had definitely left that realm. Whether this was the Great Thousand World still needed verification.</p><p>Putting away the Sun God Tree, Qin Sang formed a hand seal.  His blood instantly calmed, and the wounds on his body began to scab and fall off.</p><p>He was using the Inner Lion Seal he learned from Master Huai Yin.</p><p>This seal was truly extraordinary. Qin Sang felt his injuries completely healed, his body restored to its peak. With a heavy step, he chose a direction at random, his body shooting out like an arrow.</p><p>He couldn't stay here long!</p><p>That monstrous being might have been swept away by the spatial storm, but the commotion he made while breaking through wouldn't go unnoticed.  If there were powerful beings nearby, they might have sensed it.</p><p>Qin Sang spared no effort in using the Inner Lion Seal, maximizing the distance he could cover while the seal’s effect lasted.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the sea area quickly returned to normal.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>A violent storm suddenly erupted on the sea, a hurricane howling, the sky darkening, and the surging energy in the high atmosphere visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Clouds gathered from somewhere, swirling above, revealing a shadowy, ethereal form within the storm’s fury.</p><p>The hurricane didn't last long.</p><p>In a flash, the wind and clouds dissipated, returning to clear skies.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving that sea area, Qin Sang set a course and sped away, only then finding time to reflect on recent events.</p><p>This sudden incident had disrupted everything.</p><p>His physical body hadn't yet broken through, the Kirin Primordial Seed hadn't been refined, his promises to Liuli and other forces remained unfulfilled, and many mysteries remained unsolved. He had hastily ascended, uncertain if he had even entered the Greater Thousand Worlds.</p><p>“Will there be another chance to see them again?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought of his old friends, pondering silently.</p><p>If that beast was the source of the Heavenly Demon Sound, its removal would restore cultivation progress in his previous world, offering at least a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  These thoughts were pointless now.</p><p>The priority was finding shelter.  Once the Inner Lion Seal’s effects wore off, his injuries would worsen; he needed to heal and recover his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance, Qin Sang felt his blood qi growing agitated, realizing the Inner Lion Seal was fading.</p><p>He paused slightly, gazing into the distance, but still saw no land. The islands he'd encountered along the way were sparse, and in his weakened state, he dared not approach them, unaware of the cultivation methods used in this region.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he wasn't far enough away, not safe enough.  He glanced at the sea, sensing a powerful current beneath him.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he retrieved an object from the Qianjun Ring: a luminous orb, the Taiyi Star Chart.</p><p>Since obtaining this treasure, he had studied it for a long time. Though unrepaired and unable to use it for flight, he could hide within it for now.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this, then summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly remained perched on his shoulder, its Heaven's Eye ability ever vigilant.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, after its fourth transformation, had developed a strong, armored body.</p><p>With these two creatures protecting him, he could likely handle most situations.</p><p>As if sensing his thoughts, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly gently touched Qin Sang's cheek with its soft wings, seeming to reassure him to rest and heal.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, the gloom in his heart lifting slightly. He stroked the butterfly's wings and murmured, "At least you're with me… Once I recover, I'll help you break through!"</p><p>With that, he took out several small vials and swallowed the pills within.  He then tapped the Taiyi Star Chart, a beam of azure light erupting from it as he entered.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chart's light dimmed, becoming an inconspicuous jade orb, incredibly light, sinking beneath the surface of the ocean and carried by the Fire Jade Centipede, drifting further and further away with the current.</p><p>…</p><p>A year later.</p><p>On a rocky beach.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chart came to a stop here, its light flaring as Qin Sang emerged, gazing at the island before him.</p><p>After a year adrift at sea, he was far from his crash site.</p><p>This wasn't land, but an island, yet Qin Sang saw from afar that it was vast, its spiritual energy flourishing—a good place to recuperate.</p><p>After a brief inspection, Qin Sang frowned. The island was lush with vegetation, yet lacked a vibrant, thriving feeling. The trees were twisted and gnarled, oddly shaped, giving off a gloomy atmosphere even in broad daylight.  And…</p><p>"Why are there so many spirit creatures on this island?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Plants could become sentient and gain intelligence, but it was a difficult process.  In the small forest before him, there were over a hundred, though their cultivation was not high, the strongest only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The plant spirits frolicked and played, completely oblivious to the uninvited guest.</p><p>Unsure if larger demons resided on the island, Qin Sang concealed his presence, entering the forest without disturbing any of the spirits. He wasn't in a hurry to reach the island's center, finding a cave to enter meditation.</p><p>"The spiritual energy of this world is truly dense. Even if it's not the Greater Thousand Worlds, it's far stronger than the previous one!"</p><p>Qin Sang meditated for another month.</p><p>He focused on refining and healing pills, regulating his blood qi. His physical body improved, the injuries to his dantian and meridians gradually healing. Worried about absorbing spiritual energy and causing fluctuations that might attract unwanted attention, he initially relied on spirit stones and pills to recover.</p><p>Once he confirmed no large demons were present, he started practicing his cultivation techniques.</p><p>Instantly, a celestial phenomenon occurred; the surrounding spiritual energy converged towards him.</p><p>Suddenly, the spiritual energy dispersed violently.</p><p>A muffled groan echoed from the cave. Qin Sang clutched his dantian, his face grave.</p><p>Just now, as he absorbed the spiritual energy, he felt his true essence become unstable, almost causing recently healed meridians to be injured again.</p><p>It wasn't incompatibility with the spiritual energy!</p><p>It seemed as if the spiritual energy of this world was disordered!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly recalled something: the thunder tortoise's remains and its demon core, the energy they contained was strikingly similar to this feeling!</p><p>(End)</p>
