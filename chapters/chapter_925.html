<h1>Chapter 917: Subjugation</h1><p>Looking at the mangled remains of the Demon Cave Master, Qin Sang's face was pensive. Runes surged in his palm, drawing the Demon Cave Master's blood essence into his hand.  The runes shimmered like flames, refining the essence, leaving only the purest vital energy.</p><p>Finally, only a dragon-eye-sized crimson pearl remained in Qin Sang's hand. With a slight tremor of his arm, he reduced the Demon Cave Master's desiccated corpse to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang was using a secret technique from the "Demonic Fetus Seed Scripture". By refining blood essence and having his avatar consume and refine it, he could rapidly increase the avatar's cultivation. This was a method of accelerated growth.</p><p>Using this method, however, would make the avatar more bloodthirsty and harder to control, planting the seeds of backlash. Even with the Jade Buddha's aid, suppression would be difficult.  The avatar's master would bear the brunt of this.</p><p>Therefore, as long as the avatar could cultivate to the peak of the Core Formation stage on its own, Qin Sang would avoid using this method.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he put away the blood pearl.</p><p>The avatar flew out of Poison Island and appeared beside Qin Sang in a flash.</p><p>He had finished interrogating the Demon Cave Master's subordinates and informed Qin Sang of the situation. Qin Sang nodded and ordered the avatar to stay and guard the island. He then took the Two-Headed Vulture with him to clean up the loose ends.</p><p>In a sea region dotted with islands and reefs, the weather changed abruptly.</p><p>A thunderclap out of the blue startled the birds and beasts on the surrounding desolate islands.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>Countless birds took flight from the forests.</p><p>Two figures materialized on a small reef. They looked at a blackened area and several charred corpses on the island.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped from the Two-Headed Vulture's back and landed near the charred corpses, identifying the Demon Cave Master's Core Formation subordinate.</p><p>This was the helper the Demon Cave Master had contacted. Qin Sang had left a Skyeye Butterfly to track him to this location.</p><p>This subordinate was second only to the Demon Cave Master in the Demon Cave. His cultivation was also considerable, and he had another early Core Formation cultivator with him.</p><p>Qin Sang tested the power of his "Lightning Manipulation Technique" on them. The result was evident. Including the Xun subordinate, everyone perished under the thunder with almost no resistance.</p><p>After killing them, Qin Sang's face was pale, his true essence reduced to a tenth of its original level. However, his physical body was far stronger than any Bullfighting Peak disciple. Not only did he easily withstand the backlash of the "Lightning Manipulation Technique," but he also retained some fighting strength.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Qin Sang held spirit stones to recover his true essence, nodding in satisfaction.</p><p>Even without activating his Demonic Transformation, this technique, when used by him, could severely injure or even kill a late Core Formation cultivator. Even experts like Fang and Elder Lu would suffer greatly if caught off guard.</p><p>No wonder the Falling Star Sect was willing to spend so many resources on the "Lightning Manipulation Technique" despite its drawbacks.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture landed beside Qin Sang, its eyes wide with shock at the charred corpses. It was also awestruck by the power of the "Lightning Manipulation Technique." Over the past decade, it had often seen Qin Sang recklessly rush into the sky to battle heavenly lightning whenever a storm came.</p><p>It had no idea he was cultivating such a terrifying technique.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, conjuring spiritual fire to erase all traces of the battle. He looked into the distance and said calmly, “Let's go. The Demon Cave no longer needs to exist.”</p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang returned, covered in blood.</p><p>After confirming that the Demon Cave had no powerful backing, he uprooted the entire organization. It wasn't until several days after Qin Sang left that the nearby forces noticed anything amiss. To their astonishment, despite thorough investigations, they couldn't find a single clue.</p><p>They could only hope that a passing expert, disgusted by the Demon Cave's actions, had wiped them out.</p><p>For a time, the nearby cultivators were in a state of panic.</p><p>Various forces restrained their subordinates, and their actions became much more cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang was neither aware of nor concerned about the impact he had caused. He returned directly to Poison Island to continue his arduous cultivation.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter, the scholar and his companions hurriedly bowed.</p><p>The avatar had thrown them into a quiet room and went to cultivate on his own.  During this time, they had been anxious, unsure of their fate.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's travel-worn appearance, the scholar and the beautiful middle-aged woman exchanged a look of apprehension.</p><p>On the day they fled into Poison Island, they were trapped in an illusion formation and didn't see the battle outside. However, since the Demon Cave Master never reappeared, they had their suspicions.</p><p>“Senior, the Demon Cave Master…”</p><p>The scholar asked cautiously.</p><p>Qin Sang replied with an "Oh" and said indifferently, “That old devil is dead. I went out for a few days and dealt with his close associates to prevent any future trouble.  I forgot to ask, what are your names?”</p><p>His tone was casual, but the content shocked and delighted the scholar.</p><p>He was delighted that the devil who coveted his daughter was dead.</p><p>He was shocked by the unfathomable power of the man before him, who spoke of wiping out the Demon Cave as if it were child's play.  Being trapped on the island with his family, he didn't know whether to be happy or worried.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, the scholar respectfully replied, “Disciples of White Flame Valley all take Bai as their surname. My name is Bai Zhongqiu, my wife is Bai Hong, and you can call my daughter Ying'er, Senior.”</p><p>Seeing her father's signal, Ying'er stepped forward obediently and curtsied. “Greetings, Senior. I am Ying'er.”</p><p>“Senior, you have saved our family. We are eternally grateful…”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu knelt with his wife and daughter.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop them. He walked inside, sat down, and looked at them indifferently.  “I killed that old devil because I value peace and quiet and don't want to be disturbed during my cultivation. He only has himself to blame…”</p><p>Hearing this, Bai Zhongqiu's heart sank, and he instinctively shielded his wife and daughter.</p><p>Pausing slightly, Qin Sang continued in a serious tone, “The reason I spared your lives is that I believe you two might be of some use to me.”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu understood and immediately knelt. “Please command, Senior. I will go through fire and water for you.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. “It won't be that serious, but there will be some danger. Your cultivation is decent.  From now on, you two will gather spirit materials and information for me outside. I need to focus on my cultivation and will leave these trivial matters to you.  As for your daughter, she possesses a Water Jade Body, making her a prime target for cultivators who practice dual cultivation techniques.  It's too dangerous for her to be outside. She will stay on the island to cultivate.”</p><p>Hearing the first part, the couple felt relieved, but when they learned that Qin Sang intended to keep Ying'er on the island, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“What? Are you unwilling?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu shuddered, his face changing several times. “We will obey your command, Senior. It is Ying'er's fortune to stay by your side and receive your guidance.”</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman opened her mouth but didn't dare to say anything, holding her daughter tightly.</p>
