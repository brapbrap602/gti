<h1>Chapter 2095: Massacre</h1><p>Min Zhuo sensed a fluctuation, turned his gaze, and saw a blurry figure appear on the cliff.  The figure cupped their hands towards them from afar, silent, then soared into the clouds.</p><p>His heart chilled. Before this person appeared, he hadn't detected their aura at all.</p><p>Zai Zhen had casually dispatched a Void Realm Second Stage expert. He must have more helpers, which also proved the terrifying strength of the person behind them!</p><p>He, a mere pebble tossed to test the waters, had no ability to resist.  It was best to honestly follow their orders.</p><p>However, with such formidable power, why were they acting so surreptitiously, hiding in the shadows and manipulating him through Zai Zhen? Did it mean their opponent also had a significant background, making them apprehensive and forcing them to resort to such underhanded methods?</p><p>This deduction seemed reasonable. Min Zhuo felt like he was caught between two colossal beings, and a single misstep would crush him, even implicating his entire clan.</p><p>He dared not defy the figure behind the scenes, but if he forged a deadly feud with the powerful Yao, would he be safe?  Probably not. The worst outcome would be him becoming the sole scapegoat!</p><p>Min Zhuo couldn't figure out how to survive this predicament.  He could only take one step at a time.</p><p>His thoughts raced, but his expression remained unchanged. He cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, Brother Zai, for your consideration of my tribe. I appreciate that fellow Daoist's protection. I wonder when we should depart?"</p><p>"There's no time to lose. If Brother Min has no urgent matters, let's set off now!"</p><p>Zai Zhen walked out of the stone pavilion. "We'll follow closely behind Brother Min. As long as Brother Min uses that Dharma Art, a connection will be established between us instantly."</p><p>After saying this, Zai Zhen's figure drifted into the forest, vanishing in a flash.</p><p>After a moment, Min Zhuo focused his senses.  Even Zai Zhen's aura had disappeared without a trace.  He didn't know how many experts were hidden within the lush forest.</p><p>He silently circulated the Dharma Art, vaguely sensing Zai Zhen to his northwest.</p><p>"Brother Min?" Zai Zhen's inquiring thoughts arrived.</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>Min Zhuo withdrew the Dharma Art. Zai Zhen's cautious behavior further reinforced his previous judgment.</p><p>He returned to the Sacred Lake and summoned his third son, Min Shu, and the remaining clan elders.</p><p>"I'm going out for a while.  After I leave, immediately seal the Sacred Lake. With the ancient covenant in place, if anyone dares to openly attack our Sacred Lake, ask the Zhuyan Clan for help. They certainly won't stand idly by. If anything happens to me outside, Min Shu will take over. I hope all the elders will wholeheartedly assist him!"</p><p>Min Shu and the elders were greatly shocked. The Clan Leader had just broken through to the Void Realm Second Stage. He should be leading the clan to prosperity, so why did he sound like he was giving his last words?</p><p>Min Shu was terrified. He fell to his knees with a thud and cried out, "Father, where are you going? Why…"</p><p>Min Zhuo waved his hand to interrupt him, his voice deep, "I'm just preparing for the worst. Don't panic! Just remember to guard the Sacred Lake!"</p><p>With that, a cloud of mist formed beneath his feet, carrying him eastward.</p><p>Min Zhuo rushed towards the Canglang Sea alone, unburdened by his clansmen, allowing him to fully utilize his escape technique, his speed astonishingly fast. He crossed the Sacred Bathing Plains, entered the sea, and islands rapidly receded beneath him.</p><p>Having broken through to the Void Realm Second Stage, his escape speed had undergone a transformation.</p><p>This feeling was too wonderful. Min Zhuo was almost intoxicated.  This was the realm he had dreamed of, and he had finally reached it.  It would be a pity if he couldn't enjoy it for long before meeting his demise!</p><p>Now, the Canglang Sea was engulfed in the flames of war.</p><p>The Yao army had invaded the Canglang Sea, their previous victories boosting their morale.</p><p>On the other hand, the Changyou Clan, due to constant defeats and loss of territory, had their morale plummet to its lowest point. Even when encountering Yao forces of equal or even lesser strength, their first thought was to flee, often breaking into a rout soon after engaging.</p><p>After entering the Canglang Sea, the Flood Dragon King discovered that the Changyou Clan was still retreating and ordered the Yao army to split into three forces, aiming to eliminate as many enemies as possible.</p><p>Just as the three armies were sweeping across the region, Min Zhuo finally arrived at the Canglang Sea, and upon arrival, he immediately encountered one of the Yao armies.</p><p>It was also the Golden Toad King's misfortune that this particular army was under his command, currently conquering the southern part of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Starlight illuminated the earth, and the sea surface shimmered.  However, demonic Qi surged from the horizon.</p><p>A group of Changyou clansmen was fleeing in panic.  Suddenly, a golden light shot from behind them. Ripples appeared within the golden light. When it touched a Changyou clansman, the person instantly froze, their armor falling off first, followed by their skin and flesh, layer by layer, a gruesome death.</p><p>This person was a Nascent Realm Fourth Stage expert, equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator in the Human Realm, yet they were powerless to resist.</p><p>Seeing this, Min Zhuo snorted coldly and hooked his finger slightly.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The seawater beneath the Changyou clansmen surged, forming a wall of water that perfectly blocked the golden light.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The golden light shattered, but the water wall remained unmoved.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>The Golden Toad King within the Yao army was surprised and uncertain.</p><p>The divine ability it had used was not easily countered, even by experts of the same level. Who was this newcomer?</p><p>The Golden Toad King's eyes glowed with golden light as it looked out.  Suddenly, it saw a figure standing atop the water wall.  It hadn't even seen how the person had appeared!</p><p>Recognizing the person's appearance, the Golden Toad King's heart skipped a beat.  "Min Zhuo!"</p><p>They had calculated that if Min Zhuo was in the North Sea or the Sacred Bathing Plains, he wouldn't arrive so quickly, which is why they dared to be so reckless.</p><p>Immediately after, the Golden Toad King noticed another anomaly. Min Zhuo was right in front of it, yet in its perception, he remained incredibly blurry.</p><p>"Could it be…"</p><p>The Golden Toad King's eyes widened, suddenly realizing a terrifying possibility. Its face was filled with horror.</p><p>"Golden Toad King!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's voice was icy. They were old rivals and had clashed several times before.</p><p>Among his most dreaded opponents, the Yao's Saint Kings were second only to Fairy Liu Li, especially the Flood Dragon King and that Dragon Whale.  He had tried to set traps to ambush them, but they were cunning and adept at self-preservation, escaping every time.</p><p>The Golden Toad King and the other Yao must be the confidantes of the powerful Yao. Min Zhuo had originally planned to avoid them, leaving some leeway. But now that he had encountered them face-to-face, he couldn't ignore them, especially with Zai Zhen watching from behind.</p><p>Min Zhuo extended his right hand and lifted it gently.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The world's Yuan Qi went into chaos, the sea surface trembled violently, and under the horrified gazes of the Yao, the water on both sides bulged upwards, rapidly forming two gigantic mountains of seawater.</p><p>The towering water mountains, their peaks unseen, trapped them in a deep valley, with smooth, towering cliffs on both sides, creating an intense sense of oppression and unease.</p><p>Before the Yao could understand what was happening, the Golden Toad King had already revealed its true form, letting out a sharp roar.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The Yao used their various divine abilities, flying backwards, but the canyon seemed endless.</p><p>The Golden Toad King's true form was a massive golden toad, its body like cast gold. Its throat pulsed, emitting a loud toad croak that echoed through the deep valley, momentarily drowning out the roaring water.</p><p>At the same time, the Yao stiffened slightly, a phantom of a golden toad appearing behind their heads. Golden light enveloped their bodies, and their auras changed drastically, as if they had become clones of the Golden Toad King.</p><p>Gathering the power of all the Yao cultivators around it, the Golden Toad King lunged, attempting to escape underwater.</p><p>In the next moment, the Golden Toad King felt as though it had crashed against a solid wall, a terrifying pressure squeezing it from all directions.</p><p>Heavenly Might!</p><p>No, it wasn't just Heavenly Might, it was far beyond the Heavenly Might of a late Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>This feeling, it was as if this entire world was under someone else's control, and it was merely a trapped beast in their palm!</p><p>"Is this the power of a Soul Formation expert?"</p><p>This was likely the Golden Toad King's last thought.</p><p>A cold, cruel smile appeared on the corner of Min Zhuo's mouth. He abruptly flipped his palm.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two towering water mountains collided with a deafening roar. The deep valley and the Yao cultivators within were crushed in the middle.</p><p>The impact was terrifying.  Layer upon layer of monstrous waves erupted from the center of the collision, each wave higher than the last, as if they would knock the stars from the sky and merge with the Milky Way. All that could be seen was the churning white water.</p><p>The seawater engulfed everything, completely obscuring the Yao cultivators.  Only by activating spiritual vision could one occasionally see bursts of blood blossoms, quickly swept away by the waves.</p><p>Each blood blossom represented a life extinguished.</p><p>As the waves began to recede, not a single Yao cultivator emerged.  Only a sphere of water flew out, containing a golden toad within.</p><p>The water sphere acted as a cage, firmly imprisoning the heavily injured Golden Toad King.</p><p>The other Yao cultivators had all perished. Only the Golden Toad King survived, motionless, carried by the water sphere to Min Zhuo.</p><p>If the main Yao army had been with the Golden Toad King, they might have been able to put up some resistance by forming a formation. Unfortunately, in order to wipe out the Changyou Clan, it had only kept an elite force by its side.  Facing an expert comparable to the Soul Formation stage, they were captured without a chance to fight back.</p><p>The Golden Toad King was undoubtedly doomed. Min Zhuo didn't bother interrogating it. He pointed a finger at its forehead, and an illusory shadow shot out from his fingertip.</p><p>This was a secret technique similar to a soul-searching technique. As the shadow entered its body, the Golden Toad King trembled like a sieve, its injuries rapidly worsening until it finally lost all signs of life.</p><p>Only then did the surviving Changyou clansmen recover from their shock. They prostrated themselves, their faces filled with excitement and fervor.</p><p>"We pay our respects to the Clan Leader!"</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression was somewhat gloomy, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He had just searched the Golden Toad King's soul, intending to investigate the powerful Yao, but unexpectedly, this Yao knew nothing about it.</p><p>Among the Yao, only the Flood Dragon King and the Great Sage Dragon Whale should be able to easily suppress the Golden Toad King.  Within the Yao Sea, the Golden Toad King's status was second only to the Flood Dragon King, yet it had never been summoned.</p><p>"Could it be that only the Flood Dragon King knows?"</p><p>Min Zhuo discovered that the Flood Dragon King had already broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, which was likely related to that powerful Yao.</p><p>If that powerful Yao only intended to remain behind the scenes, supporting a single Yao cultivator or clan, it would explain everything.</p><p>If he spared the Flood Dragon King, there might still be a chance for reconciliation. Min Zhuo pondered, deciding not to share this discovery with Zai Zhen.</p><p>From the soul search, he learned that the Flood Dragon King had divided his forces into three, and the Golden Toad King had further dispersed his troops into several smaller groups, along with another force led by the Phoenix King.</p><p>Openly letting the Flood Dragon King go was impossible, but he could stall for time.  Zai Zhen had instructed him to unleash carnage, but hadn't specified that he must slaughter all the powerful Yao.</p><p>Min Zhuo turned and flew towards another group of Yao soldiers.</p><p>Wherever he went, he was unstoppable, the sea stained with blood, countless corpses piling up, the Yao suffering heavy casualties.</p><p>…</p><p>On a certain spiritual island in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Two Yao Marquises and Great Sage Black Lion were on the island, along with Si Lu.</p><p>They had come here to choose a location to build an altar, discovering that the most suitable place was not the Flood Dragon Clan's territory, nor Tianxing City, but this nameless spiritual island.</p><p>This saved them the trouble of infiltrating. The three Yao had begun preparations many years ago.  Later, Si Lu emerged from seclusion and, at Qin Sang's request, came here to assist them in constructing the altar.</p><p>The three core branch altars had already completed the first two levels, and the third level was nearing completion. The timing of the Yao rebellion was perfect. Next, they would wait for Qin Sang to eliminate his dissenters before starting the construction of the remaining altars.</p><p>Ordinary branch altars were much simpler and didn't require Si Lu's personal involvement. They would be allocated to various clans and sects, and the altars would quickly spread throughout the various regions, forming a vast altar formation.</p><p>At this moment, Si Lu was sitting alone on the altar.  The three Yao couldn't help, Great Sage Black Lion was out patrolling, and the two Yao Marquises were guarding the altar.</p><p>They were also somewhat aware of the situation outside.</p><p>"The Flood Dragon King can be considered a formidable leader, but unfortunately, he encountered the Grand Patriarch," commented Marquis Gui.</p><p>Marquis Luo nodded in agreement. The Flood Dragon King's schemes were precise and ruthless. His talent and temperament were also top-notch. If he were born in the Great Thousand World, he might have become a powerful overlord.</p><p>"Some of the tribes from the Yao Sea seem to have rather extraordinary bloodlines."</p><p>The Flood Dragon King's rapid breakthrough to the late Nascent Soul stage was partly due to the Azure Spirit Qi and partly due to his bloodline.</p><p>"Indeed," Marquis Gui nodded. "Although the bloodline power within them has become extremely thin, tracing its origins, it should be quite impressive.  But I wonder how so many tribes gathered in a small thousand world. Moreover, the peculiarities of the Storm Realm are not limited to this…"</p><p>Marquis Gui had traveled extensively in the Central Continent, and many of his experiences indicated that the Storm Realm was unusual.</p><p>Upon learning that the Storm Realm also once had a Ziwei Palace, Marquis Gui was even more shocked, secretly thinking that it was no wonder the Grand Patriarch had traveled billions of miles to return.</p><p>Just as they were discussing, Si Lu on the altar suddenly awoke, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.  His figure flickered, and he flew into the air, gazing towards the west.</p><p>"Senior Si Lu, what happened?" The two Yao Marquises hurriedly followed.</p><p>Si Lu stared for a moment, then said in surprise, "A Void Realm Second Stage expert is taking action, seemingly using the Changyou Clan's divine abilities…"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"A Void Realm Second Stage expert?  Could it be the Changyou Clan Leader who broke through?"</p><p>The two Yao Marquises were startled, quickly thinking of a possibility.</p><p>"Perhaps…"</p><p>Si Lu paused, and a round mirror flew out from his sleeve. The mirror reflected, and its light enveloped them and the island, concealing their auras.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Si Lu said, "I'll use a spell to contact Brother Qin. Don't go out."</p><p>It must be the Yao invasion that had enraged the Changyou Clan Leader, who was now unleashing carnage.</p><p>Although those being slaughtered were all Yao from the Yao Sea, Si Lu knew that Qin Sang intended to eliminate the ringleaders as a warning to others, then demote the remaining Yao cultivators to Yao soldiers, using them as a force to protect the Dao Field in the future.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader was essentially slaughtering Qin Sang's Yao soldiers!</p><p>However, the Changyou Clan Leader's breakthrough at this time was undoubtedly a significant variable.</p><p>Si Lu's eyes flickered, knowing that Qin Sang had been deliberately avoiding taking action. Whether the Changyou Clan Leader could be killed, and how to kill him, required careful consideration.</p><p>Returning to the altar, Si Lu sat cross-legged, taking out a talisman. (End of Chapter)</p>
