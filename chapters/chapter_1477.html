<h1>Chapter 1469: A Private Meeting (4k)</h1><p>The Deer King patted the restless Black Shark, chuckling, “I am the Great Deer Immortal! You don't even recognize me?  Newly transformed, are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The Great Deer Immortal assumed Qin Sang was intimidated.  For a newly ascended妖王, such hesitant behavior in front of a veteran was perfectly normal.</p><p>For妖修, innate talent is even more important than for human cultivators. Before transformation, unless blessed by a 妖王 with帝流浆, most have undeveloped intellects, existing in a hazy state, cultivating instinctively.  Unlike human cultivators, most妖修 can't meticulously plan for opportunities.</p><p>Correspondingly, many妖族 benefit from bloodline mutations or consuming heavenly treasures. They don’t need to join sects, scheming for cultivation techniques. They simply hide in secluded lairs, absorbing spiritual energy, the essence of sun and moon, comprehending their bloodline power, and cultivating their innate abilities, until they transform.</p><p>Such suddenly appearing, nameless 妖Kings aren't uncommon in the妖 Realm.</p><p>“Friend Yuan, meeting me is your lucky day. I serve under the Great Saint Tianpeng.  A word from me to the Great Saint, and you’ll soar to heights of prosperity – excellent lairs, rare treasures, and your own妖兵, all at your disposal!”</p><p>The Great Deer Immortal decided to recruit him. This self-transformed 妖王 clearly had exceptional talent, and even more valuable, he seemingly belonged to no faction.</p><p>Whether the other party was lying didn't worry the Great Deer Immortal. If there were any problems, it wouldn't escape the Great Saint's notice. A meeting with the Great Saint would reveal the truth.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the other party suddenly flapped its wings, retreating a thousand meters in the blink of an eye, its face filled with alertness.</p><p>The Great Deer Immortal’s mind raced, guessing the other's thoughts. The妖族 follow the law of the jungle, preying on the weak.  This one, newly intelligent and acting on instinct, feared the Great Saint Tianpeng might devour him.</p><p>The Great Deer Immortal laughed, “The Great Saint Tianpeng is a figure of such stature, why would he covet your mere flesh? The Great Saint is the supreme ruler of our妖族, with a benevolent heart and countless experts under him. Don't judge him by your own petty standards!”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then said, “I heard you’re going to war with humans. It’s too dangerous, I don’t want to be involved.”</p><p>“Coward!”</p><p>The Deer King’s eyes narrowed. “For years, we've been confined to the妖 Realm. Humans have slaughtered countless of our kin, accumulating countless debts of blood! Now, the Great Saint Tianpeng has called for action, giving us a chance for revenge.  And you want to shrink back?! To consume their flesh, drink their blood, devour their souls, seize their lairs, and enslave their descendants – isn't that glorious?!”</p><p>Seeing the other remain unmoved, the Great Deer Immortal changed his tone, “You don’t necessarily have to go to the battlefield. Even from the rear, you can assist the Great Saint. That’s what I’m doing now. If you’re worried about your safety, follow me for a while and see for yourself.”</p><p>“Yuan has no interest in this. Farewell!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, turned, and flew away, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>The Great Deer Immortal didn’t pursue him, stroking his chin thoughtfully. “I actively invited him, gave him a chance to access classified information, and he still didn’t show any interest.  The likelihood of him being a spy is low. Hmph, my eyes are everywhere nearby. Let's see where you can run to.  I'll have those old妖Kings keep an eye on him too.  We’ll observe further. Those wings of his are peculiar; I wonder what bloodline that is.”</p><p>Human cultivators like to keep spirit beasts. Xuan Tian Palace likely has transformed spirit beasts.</p><p>These beasts are tamed and act as traitors, something the妖族 have learned to beware of. Faced with a 妖King of unknown origin, suspicion is natural.</p><p>Meanwhile, confirming that the Deer妖 hadn’t followed, Qin Sang slowed his pace, flying leisurely. His actions were calculated; he didn't want to be suspected of being a traitor and attract undue scrutiny.</p><p>By intentionally interacting with nearby 妖Kings several times, he would become familiar, gradually building relationships.  With these 妖Kings as witnesses, his fabricated stories would become truths, making his actions in the妖 Realm far easier.</p><p>Henceforth, Qin Sang occasionally ventured out, meticulously portraying himself as a timid, cautious, newly ascended 妖King traveling and broadening his horizons, befriending several other 妖Kings. He also met the Deer King twice more.</p><p>He followed his own principles, maintaining a low profile, concealing the electric power in his wings, making them less conspicuous, and claiming to be of the Azure Bird bloodline.</p><p>Through repeated interactions, he gradually eased the 妖Kings’ suspicions.</p><p>For over half a year, Qin Sang operated on the periphery, patiently laying the groundwork, simultaneously searching for fragments of the Killing Sword and gathering intelligence on the distribution of power within the Demon Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>A vibrant island, lush with jungle and teeming with birdsong.</p><p>A small yellow spirit bird, its eyes bright and intelligent, far surpassing the ordinary birds of the island, flew in from the horizon.  Circling, it confirmed the area was clear, then suddenly dived.</p><p>Guided by some unseen force, it landed precisely at an ancient tree.  It brushed its wing against the bark, and a faint light burst forth, implanting new information into its mind.</p><p>Raised in Xuantian Palace, the bird was gifted with speech. Its ancestors had all served the Palace, not as slaves, but as cherished companions. It considered itself a member of the Palace and willingly infiltrated the Demon tribe as a spy.</p><p>Recently, a mark within it had been activated, leading it here.</p><p>This information was planted by Qin Sang. He hadn't actively sought out state secrets; rather, he'd pieced together clues from various observations.  The extent of its usefulness to Xuantian Palace was beyond his concern.</p><p>Qin Sang had already entered the Demon Realm.  He'd told the Deer Immortal that he wished to avoid the war and had sought refuge with the Nine-Headed Great Sage, much to the Deer Immortal's disappointment.</p><p>…</p><p>Southern Demon Realm.</p><p>A region of towering mountains, treacherous terrain, miasma, and hordes of demonic beasts. At the heart of the mountains lay a large lake, eerily silent.</p><p>The lake water was grey, its surface undisturbed, a seeming zone of death, radiating a palpable aura of mortality. The surrounding beasts dared not approach.</p><p>Suddenly, with a splash, a figure burst from the dead lake, unharmed.  Scanning its surroundings, it chose a direction and, with a flap of its wings, soared away.</p><p>This was Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon entering the Demon Realm, his goal was clear: the legendary Demon Realm sanctuary and the Demon King's lair.  He journeyed tirelessly for nearly two years, traversing much of the realm, yet finding nothing.</p><p>This dead lake yielded no surprises either.  Confirming the absence of Killing Sword fragments, Qin Sang left without hesitation, though he sensed a deeper mystery hidden within the lakebed.</p><p>Looking south, Qin Sang murmured, "Further south lies the Sky鹏 Great Sage's lair, Sky鹏 Mountain. I hear that Bi Fang, that scoundrel, was terrified by Tong Lingyu and is now recuperating under the Sky鹏 Great Sage's protection.  It's risky to storm Sky鹏 Mountain; I'll wait outside and ambush him when he emerges."</p><p>Qin Sang planned his next moves.  His primary targets were the two Great Sages' lairs; other locations were unlikely to hold fragments.</p><p>"Right! First, I'll visit the Nine-Headed Great Sage's Myriad Demon Cave to the north, then Sky鹏 Mountain.  I'll kill Bi Fang and leave the Demon Realm. I'm close to mastering the fourth seal of the Seven Master Buddha Imprint; I can consolidate the first four seals while I wait outside Sky鹏 Mountain. Also, the Solar God Tree has formed the outline of a divine bird; it should be complete soon, faster than I anticipated…"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned north.</p><p>As he approached the Great Sages' lairs, Qin Sang grew increasingly cautious.</p><p>The Nine-Headed Great Sage's lair was easily identified: a cold pool outside the Myriad Demon Cave, where immortal vines cascaded down, orchids flourished, and mists curled, creating a scene of ethereal beauty.  The cave's entrance was at the pool's bottom.  A chilling stillness pervaded the area.</p><p>The Nine-Headed Great Sage was aloof, rarely intervening, more akin to a reclusive master. The forces under his command couldn't compare to the Sky鹏 Great Sage's.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed himself, carefully approaching the pool.  He saw no need to force entry into the Myriad Demon Cave.  Finding no reaction from the sword spirit, he left disappointed.</p><p>After searching the remaining locations, Qin Sang finally reached Sky鹏 Mountain.</p><p>Unlike the tranquil Myriad Demon Cave, Sky鹏 Mountain pulsed with demonic energy; demonic cries echoed constantly.  Even with most of its forces deployed in the war, Sky鹏 Mountain retained a formidable presence.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly reached a smaller mountain near Sky鹏 Mountain and, standing beneath a tree, gazed at the towering peak, where thick demonic energy coalesced into a cloud that blotted out the sun.</p><p>The sword spirit remained silent.  Neither of the Great Sages' lairs contained any Killing Sword fragments.</p><p>Assessing the strength of Tianpeng Mountain, Qin Sang concluded that it was impossible to infiltrate and assassinate Bifang without alarming any demonic beasts.  Tianpeng Mountain wouldn't lack Demon Kings; a forceful entry wasn't wise.</p><p>He looked around, retreated a short distance as a precaution, chose a mountain, and carved out a hidden cave. He monitored Tianpeng Mountain while cultivating the Seven Master Buddha Seals.  He understood the odds of passively waiting for Bifang were slim.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that Bifang, being favored by the Great Sage of Tianpeng, would certainly receive medicinal herbs.  Calculating the time, his injuries were almost healed. The Great Sage of Tianpeng wouldn't keep an idle person; the front-line battles were fierce, and Bifang would be summoned once his fighting strength returned.  Bifang, having been so cruelly hunted by Tong Lingyu, would surely want revenge against the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>He waited for half a year.  During that time, numerous Demon Kings came and went, but Bifang was nowhere to be seen, nor was Wa Yu.</p><p>"The faster a divine bird approaches its complete form, the faster it solidifies. At this rate, it will be complete in a few months. I had planned to test the power of the Solar God Tree on Bifang!  Unfortunately, that turtle Bifang keeps hiding; I can't waste time here forever..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the cave entrance, gazing at Tianpeng Mountain. After some thought, he decided to wait another two months; if Bifang didn't appear, he'd choose a different target.</p><p>More than twenty days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang, engrossed in cultivating the Seven Master Buddha Seals, seamlessly integrating the first four seals, was suddenly jolted awake. His expression changed, he abruptly stood, and looked towards Tianpeng Mountain.</p><p>At that moment, his aura was suppressed to an extremely faint level; he felt like he was facing a formidable enemy!</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A thunderous, deafening sound of something breaking the air echoed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw a cloud appear in the east, speeding towards them at an incredible velocity.  Figures continuously flew out from Tianpeng Mountain, assuming a welcoming posture.  Using his Celestial Eye ability, Qin Sang saw Bifang for the first time.</p><p>However, Qin Sang showed no joy; he immediately had the Celestial Eye Butterfly retract its ability, remaining secretly vigilant.</p><p>The Great Sage of Tianpeng had inexplicably returned to Tianpeng Mountain.</p><p>In an instant, the cloud reached the peak of Tianpeng Mountain and dissipated, revealing a proud and unrestrained figure – one of the two great sages of the demon race, the Great Sage of Tianpeng!</p><p>Bifang and other Demon Kings bowed respectfully.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after addressing the demons briefly, the Great Sage of Tianpeng ordered them to withdraw. He remained suspended in mid-air, motionless for a long time.</p><p>Seeing the Great Sage of Tianpeng’s behavior, Qin Sang felt a strange sense of unease, thankful that he was far enough away to avoid exposure.</p><p>He couldn't see the Great Sage of Tianpeng's expression, but Qin Sang could vaguely see that he was facing south, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Soon, a dark light appeared on the horizon, fast as a shooting star.</p><p>Upon seeing the dark light, the Great Sage of Tianpeng abruptly opened his demonic eyes, shooting out two almost tangible beams of light, exuding an intimidating aura. The dark light paused slightly, showing no fear, and continued to fly towards Tianpeng Mountain.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang, hidden in the shadows, narrowed his eyes, his expression shifting.</p><p>Although the newcomer had concealed his aura, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity, as they had clashed many times before.</p><p>It was the Hun Mo Elder, who had hunted him several times!</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder had entered the Demon Realm alone to meet secretly with the Great Sage of Tianpeng.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected that while waiting for Bifang, he would witness such a scene.</p><p>"What does this old devil want?  Is he representing the forces of the Boundless Sea? Are the demons plotting a secret alliance with the demons to divide the spoils of the Xuan Tian Palace?"</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he found it unlikely.</p><p>The Palace Master of the Xuan Tian Palace was still alive, as was a Grand Elder with late-stage power; it was teeming with experts. They couldn't be easily slaughtered, unless those demonic fiends were willing to fight to the death.</p><p>Furthermore, if they truly intended to collude with the demons, the Hun Mo Elder would have disguised himself more thoroughly when secretly meeting the Great Sage of Tianpeng.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure out the reason and dared not move rashly. He held his breath and watched silently.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder flew before the Great Sage of Tianpeng, landing, his body shrouded in dark energy, his face hidden.  He smiled and bowed, "Great Sage, long time no see."</p><p>It was completely unlike their confrontation at the Great Demon Assembly.</p><p>The Great Sage of Tianpeng let out a thunderous hum, but his voice didn't carry.  "Old devil, what are your intentions? You seek me out, yet refuse to meet at sea. If you cannot give a reasonable explanation and delay the war effort, I'll ensure you don't leave Tianpeng Mountain!"</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder was not afraid of his threat, replying calmly, "If I appeared on the battlefield to meet the Great Sage, this matter would spread like wildfire. I don't want to become the Great Sage's pawn, suppressing the morale of the Xuan Tian Palace and causing misunderstandings. Since I dared to seek you out, it is, of course, excellent news. I should have told you at the Great Demon Assembly, but there were unforeseen events that disrupted my plans; I only recently confirmed certain matters."</p><p>Then, the Hun Mo Elder surveyed the surroundings, "Is this how the Great Sage treats his guests?"</p><p>"If you dare, then come in!"</p><p>The Great Sage of Tianpeng coldly snorted, flashing into Tianpeng Mountain. The Hun Mo Elder, fearless, followed slowly.</p>
