<h1>Chapter 1352: The Wandering Sword</h1><p>Chapter 1352: The Wandering Sword</p><p>Ten years later.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was in secluded cultivation in her cave dwelling, the protective barrier activated.  Peach blossoms were in full bloom, their fragrance filling the valley, creating a peaceful atmosphere.</p><p>At the entrance of Peach Blossom Valley, a simple cave dwelling carved into the mountain rock housed a flat, large stone where a white cat lay lazily.  A scene of tranquil beauty.</p><p>The white cat, with refined features and fur as smooth as silk, maintained a languid pose, seemingly napping.  After Qing Jun left, Qin Sang transferred the white cat to Peach Blossom Valley for its training.  The cat was naturally delighted.</p><p>Fatty Chicken, a second-generation demon, was well-trained by its mother and had a Corpse Flower Amber waiting for its breakthrough, giving it the best chance of transformation.</p><p>Bai He, despite humble beginnings, found a good mate. After Qin Sang and the Snake King reconciled, the avian couple frequently traveled between Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea and Mount Transforming Dragon to pay their respects, earning the Snake King's favor.</p><p>Only the white cat was dedicated to intense cultivation, practicing the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Scripture*, taking advantage of proximity to Qin Sang for guidance. The effects of the top-tier cultivation method were immediate. Its aura was far superior to the past, on the verge of breaking through to the mid-stage of the demon core.</p><p>Although seemingly asleep, it remained alert, its back occasionally arching as if a small snake were moving within its meridians. It inhaled spiritual energy, diligently cultivating.  Its choice to remain outside the cave was due to the extraordinary importance of the day; the cat feared losing focus on its training and missing a crucial event.</p><p>After a full cycle of spiritual energy.</p><p>The white cat's tail twitched.  It suddenly opened its eyes, sprang to its feet, and vigilantly looked towards the valley entrance.  Then, assuming a respectful posture, it opened the protective barrier.</p><p>"Greetings, senior."</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A silver flash, Jing Yu landed before the cat, glancing inside.  "Tomorrow is the grand opening ceremony of the Green Sheep Temple. Guests will be arriving from all directions. Your master is quite composed, still not out of seclusion?"</p><p>"Reporting to senior, master is refining a sect-protecting treasure. He said he will finish at the latest tonight," the white cat responded respectfully.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Jing Yu showed curiosity. "Years ago, he used the captured cloud beast soul to refine the Beast King Banner, a rather formidable artifact that protects the Green Sheep Temple’s lineage and could be considered a sect treasure. What new idea does he have?"</p><p>The white cat professed ignorance.</p><p>Jing Yu didn't stand on ceremony, flashing into the pavilion in the peach orchard to wait for Qin Sang, calling the white cat down to give it some pointers.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion.</p><p>A dark wood sword hovered before her, while she held the charred wood containing the true spirit of Yunyouzi.  Having obtained the South Ming Fiery Fire on Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang had gained new insights into the art of refining, ensuring a flawless process before starting.</p><p>The dark wood sword was now refining Yunyouzi’s true spirit; it was uncertain how long it would take to stabilize, but she didn't hesitate.</p><p>*Hum hum…*</p><p>The dark wood sword vibrated, the amplitude increasing.</p><p>Gradually, the sword became almost a ball of light.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang lifted her hand, gently tossing the charred wood towards the glowing sword, instantly absorbed. Throughout the process, the light remained stable.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the light, hesitated slightly, then black flames emerged from her brow, and a fire lotus seed flew out, emitting a strand of demonic fire that slowly approached the light.</p><p>Refining the charred wood’s true spirit into the dark wood sword didn't require external force; indeed, it risked failure.  However, the fire lotus's demonic fire had been refined by Qin Sang and was intimately connected with her, and combined with several secret techniques she had mastered, it increased the chance of success. This was the result of Qin Sang's careful planning and research.</p><p>Inside the light.</p><p>The dark wood sword hung upside down, pointing directly at the charred wood.  Sword light poured down like strands of silk, dancing in the breeze, appearing extremely gentle, gradually enveloping the wood. The demonic fire transformed into runes, blending into the sword light, barely perceptible as demonic fire’s usual turbulence.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious, not daring to be careless, as extremely complex seals poured out towards the light like a tide, creating a dazzling display.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>The dark wood sword began to gradually ‘melt.’ The charred wood, originally a Clear Fortune Righteous Bamboo, was almost destroyed by the tribulation, stripped of layers of ‘impurities’ by the sword light and demonic fire, ultimately fusing Yunyouzi’s true spirit into the dark wood sword.</p><p>"Whew…"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief; the tension in her heart eased slightly.</p><p>This was Yun Youzi's only hope for revival, and it couldn't fail. Thankfully, his preparations were thorough, the refinement process went smoothly, and the mission was a success!</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>The sword light subsided, leaving a sword embryo suspended in mid-air, as pure as a precious jade.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense Yun Youzi's spirit within the embryo, still extremely fragile.</p><p>The embryo was like an embryo, nurturing the spirit.</p><p>He reached out and gently touched the embryo, afraid to use too much force. His expression was complex, a mixture of reminiscence and hope, before finally whispering,</p><p>"This sword... shall be named Yun You!"</p><p>After gazing at it for a long time, Qin Sang placed the embryo within his primordial spirit to nurture.  Fragments of his time with Yun Youzi flashed through his mind.</p><p>Then, he remembered Bai and Qing Jun, whose fates were unknown.</p><p>He recalled the events of the ascension of the Zi Wei Palace ten years ago.</p><p>The celestial palace ascended, with Qing Jun, Bai, and Ye Laomo entering the Heavenly Hole.</p><p>The remaining Yuan Ying cultivators saw the outer hall begin to crumble.  Powerless to stop it, they could only watch helplessly as the Ascension Platform turned to ruins before fleeing frantically.</p><p>Qin Sang waited until after Qing Jun disappeared before leaving, yet he was among the first to escape.</p><p>After escaping the outer hall, everyone, shaken, looked back.</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed.</p><p>The Ascension Platform, the Celestial Tombs, the stone mountains, and even the outermost golden palaces—all reduced to ashes, leaving not a trace behind.</p><p>The Zi Wei Palace Secret Realm vanished from the world!</p><p>The aftershocks of the celestial palace's ascension only began to weaken after a day and a night.</p><p>The location of the Zi Wei Palace was a huge vortex of wind and clouds.</p><p>The space here was originally very stable, but now it was more dangerous than anywhere else in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The spatial storm gradually dissipated, but its lingering power continued to affect the area.</p><p>As the vortex dissipated, howling winds tore through the shattered space, with spatial rifts everywhere.</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators waited a long time, especially watching the heavens.</p><p>The Heavenly Hole sealed shut.</p><p>Only after confirming that there would be no further changes did they decide to leave.</p><p>After the battle...</p><p>The major threat to the Bei Chen Realm, Ye Laomo, 'ascended'.</p><p>Few died at the hands of Ye Laomo and Yu Gu, but many perished within the celestial palace due to excessive greed.  Even more were injured, with the Feather King suffering the most severe wounds, his human form unable to fully hide his weakness.</p><p>Besides, the Tian Xing Alliance and Qin Sang suffered the greatest losses.</p><p>The fate of Zhen Daochang was unknown, leaving the Tian Xing Alliance leaderless. Only the Twin Battle Generals could succeed Zhen Daochang.</p><p>Qin Sang lost his senior sister and Bai, two valuable mentors and friends, and a Corpse King-level corpse puppet. Luckily, the Demon Fire and the Yuan Ying spirit puppet remained; otherwise, his status would have plummeted.</p><p>What Qin Sang couldn't accept was that the Sword Path Hall and the ancient teleportation array also 'ascended' with the celestial palace, cutting off the path to the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>His previous plans concerning the Cang Lang Sea were now useless.</p>
