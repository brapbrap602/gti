<h1>Chapter 1768:  Shi Bai 治</h1><p>Northern Polar Exorcism Academy.</p><p>The same Nine Heavens Inspector who had greeted Qin Sang before was there again.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you completed the decree so quickly?”</p><p>The Inspector looked at Qin Sang, who was unharmed, a hint of surprise in his expression.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a strange unease. This decree seemed extremely dangerous, requiring infiltration of the demon lord's territory, yet compared to those decrees involving intelligence gathering or assassinating demon generals, the difficulty was incomparable.  If it weren’t for the turmoil caused by  Zhenren Zhijian, it should have been far smoother.</p><p>“Mission accomplished,”</p><p>Qin Sang presented the Four Seasons Dream Flower.</p><p>The Inspector took it, examining it carefully. A strange look flickered in his eyes before he produced a thumb-sized jade amulet, handing it to Qin Sang.  “This is Senior Lingxu’s token. It bears a special mark left by Senior Lingxu.  With this, you can go to Senior Lingxu's residence in Shi Bai 治 and meet him.”</p><p>The location of Master Lingxu’s residence wasn’t a secret; Qin Sang had already found out.</p><p>Carefully receiving the amulet, Qin Sang bowed.  “Inspector, if you have no further instructions, I shall take my leave.”</p><p>“Go ahead, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Inspector saw Qin Sang out of the hall.  Standing before the hall, he pondered for a long time, suddenly realizing something, and hurried away.</p><p>…</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei entered the Northern Polar Exorcism Academy. Guards, upon seeing the Nine Heavens Censor, bowed respectfully.</p><p>Those more perceptive noticed Zhenren Cuiwei’s gloomy expression, secretly alarmed, and behaved even more deferentially, fearing his displeasure.</p><p>Entering his official residence, Zhenren Cuiwei had barely settled when the Nine Heavens Inspector swiftly entered.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”</p><p>The Inspector performed a formal bow. Seeing his master's expression, he understood.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had received a report that his master’s plan had failed, and he had fled the Gui Fang Kingdom in disgrace. He wasn’t privy to the details, however.</p><p>The Inspector cautiously observed his master’s face, saying, “That demon, Marquis Liu…”</p><p>“I overestimated myself!”</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei sighed. There was no need to hide anything from his disciple, so he explained the reason for his exposure. Then, he chuckled self-deprecatingly.  “As the saying goes, misfortune hides the seeds of fortune. Unexpectedly, Marquis Liu was very vigilant, having already hired experts to guard his territory. If I hadn't revealed myself beforehand, and Marquis Liu had acted hastily and without sufficient preparation, the losses might have been far greater.”</p><p>The Inspector looked enlightened.  “So that’s how it was!  When Zhenren Qingfeng brought the Four Seasons Dream Flower, I thought…”</p><p>“Zhenren Qingfeng?”</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei raised his eyes. “The one who completed the decree… he’s back?”</p><p>“He returned ten days ago, looking completely fine. I hadn't received the report at the time, so I didn't ask much,” the Inspector replied.</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei leaned back, letting out a low chuckle.  “This person, able to avoid Marquis Liu’s notice and return safely, possesses considerable skill.  It was simply his good fortune.”</p><p>The token of a Dan Dao Grandmaster was incredibly valuable.</p><p>Ordinarily, a decree to gather herbs would hardly yield such a reward, unless the herb was urgently needed by that Grandmaster.</p><p>The Inspector whispered, “Initially unaware of the situation, seeing this person’s unexpected return, I investigated further.  I can confirm that ‘Qingfeng’ is an alias; his identity is entirely fabricated.”</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei wasn't surprised.</p><p>In Ju Shan 治, this was commonplace.</p><p>Besides those wanted by the Daoist Court, many cultivators outside the Daoist sects liked to disguise their identities.</p><p>It was a survival strategy in the gap between two behemoths. Should they offend the Daoist Court or Gui Fang Kingdom, they could instantly discard this identity and emerge as someone entirely different.</p><p>Zhenren Cuiwei hummed, his tone unwavering.</p><p>In fact, this decree was part of a plan to lure the enemy out, with the Four Seasons Dream Flower being genuine.  Master Lingxu’s issuing of the decree was orchestrated by Zhenren Cuiwei.</p><p>Once the plan was activated, the one who completed the decree would undoubtedly face almost certain death.</p><p>Since the herb gatherer couldn’t be too strong or too weak, and in the Daoist world, those with such cultivation were either pillars of some sect or high-ranking officials in the Daoist Court, the loss of one would be a significant blow, and their colleagues would never stand idly by. Therefore, the candidate could only be found outside the Daoist sects.</p><p>When Qin Sang completed the decree, his information was already on Zhenren Cuiwei’s desk.</p><p>Learning that this Zhenren Qingfeng was the one who had uncovered the conspiracy behind the demon god and slain Marquis Liu's demon general, Zhenren Cuiwei was overjoyed.</p><p>The decree allowed for the dispatch of expendable personnel without a trace, but it also limited the selection process.  If it turned out that the person had a powerful background, should they be used or not?</p><p>It could be said that the incident originated from Zhenren Qingfeng, who was certainly not a spy from Gui Fang Kingdom, making him the ideal candidate.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Noticing his disciple’s unusual expression, Zhenren Cuiwei suddenly had a flash of insight.</p><p>Before, he hadn’t suspected anything.</p><p>Numerous reports of demonic gods wreaking havoc across the land have finally prompted authorities to take notice.  This is not an isolated incident; these disturbances are widespread.</p><p>What if Liu Hou is deliberately acting against expectations, and is actually an inside agent?</p><p>To sacrifice a demonic general, setting a trap in his own territory to lure me in…</p><p>Master Cuiwei’s mind raced.  Reason told him this was unlikely.</p><p>Whether or not to infiltrate Gui Fang, the decision rests with me.</p><p>My colleagues in the Daoist Court all opposed this plan. I chose to take the risk to obtain more accurate intelligence and gain merit with the governing body.</p><p>Liu Hou is making a big fuss over something so vague; it seems hardly worthwhile.</p><p>“Have you discovered his true identity?”  Master Cuiwei pressed.</p><p>Inspector You replied with shame, “Not yet!  However, this person has been to this location and carried the token of the Sword-Bearing Master.  They must have a close relationship…”</p><p>Inspector You then channeled his energy, conjuring an image of a section of the celestial city, pointing to a courtyard within.</p><p>Master Cuiwei’s eyes narrowed. “The Sword-Bearing Master who recently pacified Lingdu Mountain?”</p><p>Inspector You nodded.</p><p>Master Cuiwei closed his eyes, leaning back on his couch. After a moment’s reflection, he said, “No need to investigate further.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang, within his cave dwelling, remained oblivious to these events.</p><p>After receiving the token, Qin Sang did not immediately visit Master Lingxu at Baishi, instead returning to his cave to continue his rigorous training.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique was not yet perfected. Qin Sang planned to wait until he was close to a breakthrough before setting out.</p><p>Mount Heming provided a rare environment for peaceful cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Eighteen years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>For eighteen years, Qin Sang dedicated himself to cultivation, rarely venturing out. He only left when he needed pills, exchanging merit points with the Daoist Court for them.</p><p>In fact, with the Dragon Pond spirit liquid and the exceptional environment of this world, Qin Sang's need for external resources was minimal. He bought large quantities of pills to accelerate his cultivation to the peak and create a buffer period.</p><p>His hard work paid off. After eighteen years, Qin Sang finally reached the peak of the fourth level of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*!</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood, bursting out of the cave like a wild beast.</p><p>The wolf demon, resting outside, jolted awake, its fur standing on end.</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from Qin Sang, the wolf demon’s pupils dilated, revealing deep fear.</p><p>“Congratulations on your mastery, Immortal!”</p><p>The wolf demon prostrated itself.</p><p>Because its altar had been confiscated, and it hadn't obtained any demonic essence, fearing further cultivation would lead to mental instability, it hadn't made much progress in these years and acted as Qin Sang’s gatekeeper.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the abundant power within him and smiled slightly.  “In a few more years, I will send you to the Demon Kingdom.”</p><p>With his breakthrough, he had regained his Nascent Soul strength, making him a formidable figure in this world.</p><p>The secrets the wolf demon knew were merely its own speculations, unconvincing to others and inconsequential.</p><p>Dismissing the wolf demon, Qin Sang produced a bone flute.</p><p>The flute was smooth, white, and emitted a soft glow, exuding a warm feeling.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique originated from this treasure.</p><p>However, from the time Qin Sang began cultivating this technique until now, the flute only displayed the first four levels, the rest obscured by mist.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang was on the verge of a breakthrough, the flute remained unchanged.</p><p>“Will the subsequent techniques only appear after a breakthrough?”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness, lost in thought.</p><p>…</p><p>Baishi.</p><p>Xu Yi Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang, dressed in a crane-feather robe, appeared before a bamboo grove.</p><p>The bamboo grove was lush and serene, a small path winding its way to the depths.</p><p>Sensing the rare tranquility, Qin Sang silently admired the place, the heart of Master Xu Yi Jing’s altar city.</p><p>Cultivating such a vast bamboo grove in this precious land – truly a master of concealment.</p><p>Standing before the path, Qin Sang bowed to the empty grove ahead.  “This humble cultivator, Qingfeng, greets Master Lingxu.”</p><p>Shortly after, a young boy emerged from the bamboo forest, formally returning Qin Sang’s bow and after checking the token crisply said,  "The Master requests your presence."</p><p>Only a few huts lay deep within the bamboo grove.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, he easily met Master Lingxu.</p><p>Master Lingxu was an ageless elder, holding an ebony dragon staff, his eyes particularly bright and piercing.</p><p>He didn't conceal his cultivation; only at the initial stage of Nascent Soul. Yet, his reputation far surpassed that of his peers.</p><p>“I greet Master Lingxu.”</p><p>Qin Sang paid his respects deeply.</p><p>Master Lingxu chuckled, stroking his beard.  "Master Qingfeng, I remember you.  Thanks to you bringing back the complete Four Seasons Dream Flower last time, its medicinal properties were exceptional. I successfully refined a superior batch of elixirs. I've been wanting to see you, but it's been eighteen years."</p><p>"I've been cultivating in Crane Song Mountain for eighteen years, I didn't want to keep you waiting, Master," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"You've come to use this token?"</p><p>Master Lingxu glanced at the jade talisman in the attendant's hand. "I recall the Daoist Court inquiring. You wish to exchange the token for my assistance in requesting the Xuanji Sect Master's intervention?"</p><p>"Exactly!" Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"Hehe…" Master Lingxu shook his head slightly.  "Those who seek me out always ask for my alchemy. You're the first to forgo that opportunity and seek something else."</p><p>Master Lingxu stood, lightly tapping the ground with his dragon staff, and started walking out. "I've been planning a visit to an old friend at Xuanji Sect; we can do both at once."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised, then overjoyed, quickly following.  Having Master Lingxu himself intervene was far more reliable than a letter.</p><p>They first went to the teleportation array in Xu Yi Jing. With Master Lingxu present, they passed without any checks.</p><p>Emerging from the teleportation hall, Qin Sang beheld a sight far grander than Xu Yi Jing. This celestial city seemed built in the heavens.  Below, boundless clouds swirled, supporting the immense city.</p><p>As the sun set, Qin Sang's view was directed westward.  At the city's edge, a breathtaking display of sunset colors filled the sky.  Deep within, seemingly endless peaks and golden palaces rose towards the heavens, a vision like a celestial palace.</p><p>"Even the legendary Nine Heavens Golden Que wouldn't surpass this," Qin Sang murmured, captivated.</p><p>This was Bai Shi Zhi – the city itself, the location of the Bai Shi Zhi altar!  It was said that the Grand Masters of the North Pole Exorcism Academy,  high-ranking officials such as the Third Rank Nine Heavens Golden Que Upper Minister, the Nine Heavens Inspector, and even those of higher rank, resided within those cloud palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang had long admired this place, and wouldn't have dared to come alone without Master Lingxu's company.</p><p>Master Lingxu, unaware of Qin Sang's awe, pointed beyond the city walls. "Xuanji Sect is still five days' journey. Let's not delay, let's leave the city quickly."</p><p>Leaving the city, Master Lingxu wished to enjoy the scenery and refused a beast carriage or palanquin. Qin Sang was happy to oblige, seizing the opportunity to cultivate a good relationship.  They traveled at a leisurely pace, flying at low altitude.</p><p>The area near the altar was a center of cultivation and held the Daoist's most powerful forces.  They passed several sects' gates without delay.</p><p>Master Lingxu was far less aloof than rumored, proving quite talkative. Qin Sang engaged him readily, creating a pleasant atmosphere.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, Qin Sang inquired about the Qingshuang Pill.</p><p>"Hmm? This elixir seems different from what I've learned… may I see the formula?"  Master Lingxu showed keen interest after Qin Sang's description.</p><p>Qin Sang readily presented the formula.  However, upon seeing it, Master Lingxu became engrossed, remaining silent for a whole day and night. Qin Sang patiently guarded him.</p><p>"Ah!  What an exquisite formula!  The Dao of Alchemy is truly vast; my knowledge is but a drop in the ocean!" Master Lingxu sighed with wonder, his gaze intense. "Where did you obtain this… ah, my apologies!"</p><p>The Qingshuang Pill was a legacy of the Wu tribe.  The Wu and Human tribes had significant differences in alchemy, something Qin Sang had realized during his training as an incarnation.</p><p>"Master, if you're interested, I'll search further upon my return. If I find similar formulas, I'll send them to your estate immediately," Qin Sang replied cautiously.</p><p>The *Panhu True Scripture*, a secret manual of insect control passed down by the Ghost Mother, contained formulas even more valuable than the Qingshuang Pill, but Qin Sang didn't intend to reveal them yet.</p><p>"I thank you in advance!" Master Lingxu, suppressing his excitement, fell into thought. "The last ingredient you lack, the Heavenly Centipede Root, if I'm not mistaken, is now known as the Hundred-Knot Earth Bamboo. Unfortunately, I don't know its whereabouts.  Should you gather the complete formula in the future, I'll refine a batch for you free of charge."</p>
