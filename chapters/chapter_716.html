<h1>Chapter 708: Cold Flame</h1><p>Something seemed to have exploded.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded, his chest felt tight.  His escape light flickered before stabilizing.  He stared behind him in shock.</p><p>Such a massive disturbance! Even a late-stage妖丹 demon beast couldn't have caused it!</p><p>Moreover, following the explosion, a demon beast's furious roar echoed, filled with intense pain.</p><p>The sun was setting, leaving a faint blush in the sky, already darkening.</p><p>On the eastern sea, a bright, crystalline blue light appeared at the horizon, remarkably conspicuous.</p><p>The blue light intensified and expanded, then suddenly erupted.</p><p>In an instant, the dazzling blue light illuminated the sea area like daytime. Qin Sang was forced to squint, but he remained transfixed on the light.</p><p>A slender blue beam shot from the light cluster, piercing the sky!</p><p>Moonlight shone above; the beam seemed to be heading straight for it.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt the surrounding area grow even darker.  His mouth hung open, unable to close for a long time.</p><p>Huge waves surged, the entire sea surface trembling.</p><p>Soon, the beam weakened, slowly descending.  Remaining sparks fell like starlight, dissipating in the wind, like ephemeral fireworks—stunningly beautiful.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw that the source of the blue light was a type of blue spiritual flame; those sparks were individual flames.</p><p>"Could it be the spiritual flame hidden deep within the cave? It was fine in the cave's depths, without any signs of activity. Why did it suddenly erupt?  Either a demon beast accidentally triggered a restriction in the cave, or those cultivators deliberately released the flame.  Leaving beforehand was a wise decision; the cave is definitely more than just a Yuan Ying cultivator's tomb…"</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed, secretly startled but also relieved.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the spiritual flame.  After the eruption, a blue glow still lingered over the eastern night sky and sea.  The flame had retracted to its original size, but it was still violently shaking, expanding and contracting erratically. It was clearly extremely volatile, not as benign as it appeared.</p><p>Then Qin Sang noticed that a layer of ice had formed on the sea surface around the flame.  He saw waves freeze the instant they rose, turning into ice chunks.</p><p>The sea breeze from that direction had also become a biting cold wind.</p><p>"It can even freeze the sea, affecting a vast area—what terrifying power!  So my earlier guess was correct.  The flame must be a type of cold flame. The cold mist is related to the flame, carrying its aura, so the Nine Nether Demon Fire reacted."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, comparing the cold flame to the Zu Sheng Fire of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Of the spiritual flames he had seen, the Nine Nether Demon Fire was sealed in a treasure, and the Southern Ming Li Fire was only a small portion of the demon fire's power, its main body supposedly small, and he hadn't seen it in person.</p><p>Only the Zu Sheng Fire, raging wildly on Shen Gang Peak, had he seen clearly.</p><p>Due to the distance, he couldn't accurately sense the cold flame's aura, but judging by its eruption's power, it was probably comparable to the Zu Sheng Fire.</p><p>This suggests that the cold flame possesses at least Yuan Ying-level power!</p><p>"Did Elder Dong Ming build his tomb here to subdue the cold flame?  His sudden disappearance, leaving behind treasures, means he might have had an accident subduing the flame, suffering backlash and dying inside?"</p><p>Knowing so little, he could only guess wildly.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, gazing at the cold flame.</p><p>"Besides that scream, the demon beast hasn't made any more sounds, and I haven't seen any cultivators.  Could they all have died in the instant the flame erupted?"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, unsure if the cold flame had truly calmed down. If he approached and another explosion occurred, he'd be in grave danger.</p><p>But the cold flame was tempting.</p><p>Years ago, Ancestor Kui Yin subdued the Nine Nether Demon Fire, refining the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, which shook the Xiaohan region.</p><p>After learning the origin of the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, Qin Sang was envious, always hoping to emulate Ancestor Kui Yin and subdue a spiritual flame.</p><p>If he could control the cold flame, his strength would immediately increase by countless levels.</p><p>Qin Sang's own strength is low, he is not sure that relying on the Cold Flame can contend with the Yuan Ying, but he will be the number one under Yuan Ying, without any doubt.</p><p>Could a mere Nascent Soul cultivator like himself control such terrifying cold flames?</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea.  The method used by Old Ancestor Kuiyin to subdue the demonic fire was impossible to replicate.  The ancestor had happened upon a treasure that could suppress the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and even with his cultivation, it had taken him over a hundred years to fully understand its use.  This was a shortcut, a clever solution.</p><p>Forget about finding a treasure that could subdue these cold flames—even if he found one, Qin Sang had no confidence in refining a magic treasure comparable to the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>"Just a quick look, to broaden my horizons, that should be fine.  Even if I can't subdue it now, I might find a way later.  The spiritual fire is hidden here; the chances of other cultivators discovering it are slim…"</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought, his figure flashing as he retreated along his path.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after taking flight, before he even neared the cold flames, Qin Sang's expression changed, and he abruptly stopped.</p><p>His eyes, sharp as lightning, swept across the ice before fixing on a single spot.</p><p>A faint 'crack, crack' sound emanated from there, growing increasingly louder. Then, the entire ice surface exploded, sending ice shards flying as a colossal figure broke free.</p><p>The great demon wasn't dead!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  He was about to retreat, but strangely noticed that the demon’s body was much smaller than before.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, nearly half of the great demon's body was gone, a wound roughly equivalent to being severed at the waist for a human. Even its remaining upper body was severely injured, its flesh torn and mangled.</p><p>Bloody ice shards erupted from the wounds, falling onto the sea's surface and spreading in bloody patches.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>After breaking free, the great demon roared.</p><p>Despite its grievous injuries, it was still alive, though its aura was significantly weaker.  It glanced fearfully at the cold flames, then, its upper body swaying, fled without hesitation toward the distance, returning to its lair.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered at this sight.</p><p>Besides the great demon, everyone else was gone. But judging by the demon's pitiful state, the power of the cold flames' eruption was evident, leaving the chances of others surviving practically nonexistent.</p><p>Unable to subdue the cold flames, obtaining a late-stage妖丹 (yao dan, demon core) was still a remarkable gain.</p><p>Although the great demon appeared severely injured, its strength was still formidable. Qin Sang quickly assessed his own capabilities and decided to give it a try.</p><p>With this in mind, he changed direction without hesitation and pursued the great demon.</p><p>The Blood-Soiled Divine Light divine ability was ineffective against beasts, so Qin Sang didn't summon the ebony sword.  Instead, he opened his palm, and three Ten Directions Yama Banners silently slid into his grasp.</p><p>Simultaneously, two flying night rakshas stood ready.</p><p>Fighting a beast in the sea allowed no room for carelessness.</p>
