<h1>Chapter 1004: Trial by Fire</h1><p>The situation in the Demon Sea was ever-changing.</p><p>Qin Sang studied the situation for a long time before deciding on his target.</p><p>He had initially wanted to ask Yuan Zhu about the distribution of demon factions within the Demon Sea.</p><p>The areas explored by cultivators were limited, confined to the area between Sky Witch Island and Great Wilderness Island, and the surrounding waters.  Yuan Zhu, being of the Jiao Dragon clan, would certainly have extensive knowledge of the demon races.</p><p>However, Qin Sang reconsidered.  This question was too sensitive.</p><p>He and Yuan Zhu were of different races, brought together by chance and circumstance, developing a fragile friendship.  Only the Jiao Dragon King and other demon kings had betrayed Yuan Zhu, not the entire demon race. Qin Sang's purpose was to slay demons for training, something Yuan Zhu couldn't and wouldn't stop him from doing.  However, Yuan Zhu couldn't be expected to stand idly by and watch his own kind be slaughtered.</p><p>Qin Sang decided not to mention it, lest it cause friction between them.</p><p>He didn't board a ship.  Leaving Great Wilderness Island, he summoned the Jiao Soul Chariot and flew alone towards the depths of the Demon Sea.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang pondered the secret technique Yuan Zhu had given him.  The greatest dangers in the Demon Sea were beast tides and transformed demons.  With the secret technique, combined with the "Celestial Demon Transformation," he believed that as long as he wasn't too reckless, he could navigate the Demon Sea freely.</p><p>At first, he occasionally encountered other cultivators.</p><p>As Qin Sang ventured deeper, cultivators became increasingly scarce, and the sea gradually became the domain of demon beasts.</p><p>Several years later.</p><p>On a desolate island.</p><p>The vegetation was withered, presenting a bleak scene.</p><p>Apart from the occasional chirping of insects from the depths of the jungle, the vast island was silent, devoid of the sounds of birds or beasts.</p><p>The withered grass rustled, and a figure slowly emerged – it was Qin Sang.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its eye-like patterns wide open.</p><p>After surveying the island for a moment, Qin Sang flicked his wrist. A ring flew out, shimmering as it released the demon beast trapped within the Mixed-Element Concentric Ring: a giant golden-scaled python.</p><p>Although Qin Sang's strength was far greater than before, capturing another spirit beast with the intelligence, talent, and power comparable to the Two-Headed Serpent was a significant challenge.</p><p>Over the past few years, he had journeyed through the Demon Sea, searching for a suitable spirit beast, finally capturing this golden-scaled python.</p><p>This python was quite powerful among mid-stage Core Formation demon beasts, but its intelligence was far inferior to the Two-Headed Serpent. It couldn't act independently. Its greatest use was as bait.</p><p>The golden-scaled python was ferocious and difficult to tame.  Freshly released from the Mixed-Element Concentric Ring, it reared its upper body, its vertical pupils fixed on Qin Sang with a cold, piercing gaze.</p><p>It was easy to imagine that if Qin Sang's power ever waned and he lost control, the python would毫不犹豫噬主毫不犹豫地 turn on him.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed forward, his voice booming like thunder, intimidating the python.</p><p>Fierce light flickered in the python's eyes. It was reluctant, but bound by the magical ring, it could only submit, slithering silently towards the depths of the island.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>A tiger's roar suddenly echoed from ahead, loud as a clap of thunder.</p><p>The small island trembled, dead leaves fluttered down, and the withered grass flattened under the force of the sound wave.</p><p>Simultaneously, the hiss of the golden-scaled python rang out.</p><p>Qin Sang, having stealthily followed, stood on an ancient tree.  He saw a cloud of dust and debris ahead where the two beasts were locked in combat.</p><p>The golden-scaled python was clearly at a disadvantage. Its opponent was a tiger demon.</p><p>"Late-stage Core Formation!"</p><p>A satisfied smile spread across Qin Sang's face. "This tiger demon should be the dominant force around here!"</p><p>Deep within the Demon Sea, without a map to guide him, Qin Sang had to search for demon beasts himself. He had spent a long time in this area, finally discovering clues that led him to the tiger demon's lair.</p><p>The golden-scaled python gradually weakened, showing signs of defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  His figure flashed, and he rushed into the fray. He pointed two fingers at the tiger demon, his true essence surging as the Ebony Sword materialized.</p><p>The sword hummed, and a dazzling sword beam transformed into a giant sword, slashing down towards the tiger demon!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The tiger demon realized that Qin Sang was the greater threat.  It swatted the python away with its paw.</p><p>Its jaws opened wide, and a cloud of demonic mist erupted.</p><p>Within the swirling chaos, the tiger demon's form flickered, seemingly attempting to evade the sword strike. It tensed its body, radiating a violent aura, as if preparing to pounce on Qin Sang.</p><p>不愧是一方霸主，果然强势不愧是一方霸主，果然强势.</p><p>A pungent, bloody stench filled the air.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained completely calm, easily tracking the tiger demon's movements. With a composed expression, he gestured with the Ebony Sword, summoning the Sword Wheel.</p><p>The Sword Wheel was now more solid and radiant.</p><p>While training, Qin Sang had been reflecting on his understanding of the Sword Path.  Although he hadn't grasped the profound mysteries of Sword Momentum yet, he felt he was on the right track, continuing to refine the Sword Wheel.</p><p>With both his spirit sword and the Sword Wheel enhanced, the power of the Sword Wheel was far greater than before.</p><p>Like a blazing sun, it illuminated the desolate island, whirling towards the tiger demon.</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>Even late-stage Core Formation cultivators would find such a powerful demon troublesome and avoid provoking it.  Yet, the tiger demon's robust body was injured by the Sword Wheel, its claws dripping with blood.  Had it not been alert, they might have been severed on the spot.</p><p>The intense pain drove the tiger demon into a frenzy.</p><p>Its roar became distorted.</p><p>Roaring furiously, its aura surged, and a massive shadow suddenly appeared behind it, resembling a gigantic tiger several meters tall, glaring down at Qin Sang with immense pressure.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was not frightened but delighted, secretly thrilled.  The stronger the tiger demon, the greater the pressure, the better the training effect.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Sword Wheel exploded, colliding with the tiger's shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang fought the tiger demon solely with sword techniques, completely immersed in the battle.</p><p>The fight was intense, ranging from the island to the sea. To Qin Sang's disappointment, apart from the giant shadow, the tiger demon displayed no other powerful techniques.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The shadow shattered under the Sword Wheel.</p><p>The tiger demon whimpered and turned to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to pursue it with his sword when he seemed to sense something. He abruptly turned his head towards the north, a sense of unease rising within him. He immediately recalled his spirit sword and unleashed the Star Conch.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The tiger demon died instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang swept up the demon's corpse, a tri-colored light enveloping him as he fled without hesitation.</p><p>He had barely left when a fierce wind swept in. From the waves, a figure shimmered into existence, landing on the island. Seeing the chaotic scene, it let out a cold snort.</p><p>The newcomer had a human form but a beast's tail – it was a transformed demon!</p><p>"Such swift escape techniques, no wonder it dares to cause trouble everywhere! Hmm? This aura! Could the intelligence be wrong? Is it not a cultivator, but some shameless old geezer bullying the young?"</p><p>The demon sniffed the air, gazing in the direction Qin Sang had fled, appearing uncertain. Surprisingly, it did not pursue him.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had changed direction multiple times, escaping far away.</p><p>Over the past few days, Qin Sang had sensed something amiss. He suspected that his recent actions had been too high-profile and that he had stayed in this area for too long, attracting the attention of the demon race.</p><p>"A transformed demon was personally dispatched. I've been discovered. I can't stay here. It's best to move to a more distant area..." Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>It would be dangerous if he were cornered by a transformed demon.</p><p>He found a place, quickly butchered the demon corpse, and continued south.</p>
