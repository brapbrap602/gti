<h1>Chapter 955: Pure Yang Sect</h1><p>Chapter 955: Pure Yang Sect</p><p>“Unexpectedly, there’s a junior disciple in my sect who has cultivated this technique to such a realm. You obtained the jade slip I left behind. If you can truly continue your cultivation with these two talismans and successfully form your Nascent Soul, I will have a successor.  It’s just… I never imagined we’d meet like this, here and now. Fate is truly a cruel mistress,”</p><p>Qingzhu sighed deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to speak when Qingzhu interrupted him with a wave of his hand. “I know what you want to ask.  The thing you seek isn’t here; it’s in the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall. You can only reach it when it emerges on its own.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and confused.</p><p>He had been teleported to the Seven Killing Hall, yet inexplicably found himself in the western borderlands of the Witch God Continent. He later learned he’d fallen from the top of the Heavenly Tower and was mistaken for a ten-thousand-year-old corpse.</p><p>Did Qingzhu mean the ancient teleportation array wasn’t in the Heavenly Tower?</p><p>“Please, senior, enlighten me,” Qin Sang quickly pressed.</p><p>“This involves many secrets. I can’t speak of them; I must avoid even thinking about them. I can’t answer your questions.  Right now, I’ve sealed my memories, and he can’t get to me for the time being. If he catches even a glimpse of my thoughts, if he learns those secrets, it will ruin everything, and lead to utter disaster.”</p><p>Qingzhu pointed to his body and sighed softly.  “I shouldn’t have appeared today, but I couldn’t resist seeing Jing’er’s carving. I forcibly broke through his suppression.  I also have to thank you, little friend, for bringing this news. It’s settled a matter weighing heavily on my heart, and now I can fight back with everything I have. But because of this, I’ve created a weakness, giving him an opportunity. What the outcome will be… it’s hard to say.”</p><p>Qingzhu's words were obscure.</p><p>Qin Sang understood roughly. The ‘him’ Qingzhu referred to was another consciousness within him, most likely a demonic soul, a manifestation of his external self, attempting to devour his original spirit and take control.</p><p>Qingzhu was suffering from a backlash, sealing his memories and defending his mind against the demonic soul.</p><p>“Senior, do you have a way to resolve this problem? Although my cultivation is low, perhaps I can still help…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said solemnly.</p><p>In fact, after entering the eighth level, Qin Sang's heart sank. Something felt terribly wrong.</p><p>This place was completely different from what he had imagined—a desolate wasteland, filled with deathly stillness. There were no ancient halls, no traces of ancient restrictions, making the existence of an ancient teleportation array extremely unlikely.</p><p>He suspected that the eighth level was not the top of the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>If Qingzhu meant the ancient teleportation array was in the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall, he would have to wait until the Seven Killing Hall emerged on its own before he could enter the inner hall and search.</p><p>The location of the ancient teleportation array must be extremely secret, otherwise, it would have been discovered long ago, revealing the Purple Micro Palace and the Little Cold Region.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall only emerged once every few hundred years. He only had one chance, and the hope of finding the ancient teleportation array alone was extremely slim.</p><p>Whether Qingzhu’s words were true or false, he could only side with Qingzhu.</p><p>“It’s rare for someone at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment to have your strength. Once you reach the peak of Foundation Establishment, even if I encounter you before I form my Nascent Soul, I would have to concede defeat. However, you can’t help me.  Only I can fight for a chance of survival.”</p><p>Qingzhu shook his head. “To be honest, your current predicament is somewhat related to me. I won’t deliberately hide things from you, nor will I use this to coerce you…”</p><p>Qingzhu paused, then suddenly changed the subject. “Do you know of the Pure Yang Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, but he didn’t dare to speak rashly, merely nodding.</p><p>“After you leave, go to the Pure Yang Sect and find a sword cultivator surnamed Ning. He will come to see you and tell you the whole story. At that time, please help me deliver this to him…”</p><p>Qingzhu's divine sense vibrated, countless runes appeared, condensing into a crystal bead before him.  Just as he was about to send it to Qin Sang, another aura suddenly turned violently aggressive.  A series of roars came from within him, and a black light shot out from his chest, striking the crystal bead.</p><p>Qingzhu groaned, his divine sense collapsing, and the crystal bead shattered.</p><p>Several attempts ended the same way. Qingzhu’s vitality was waning, and he could no longer even form a crystal bead.</p><p>“Forget it! Go!”</p><p>Qingzhu sighed softly, giving up, his voice urgent. “Great changes are coming to this place. This isn’t a place to stay long. I’m about to lose control. Let me give you one last piece of advice: The celestial restrictions have changed. The intervals between the Seven Killing Hall’s appearances may become shorter and shorter. Be prepared.”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qingzhu’s aura was in chaos, bloodshot red filled his pupils, and he hurriedly sat cross-legged, his body trembling.</p><p>Qin Sang still had many questions, but seeing this scene, he dared not linger. He silently bowed to Qingzhu and hurried towards the Sword Path.</p><p>Mountain peak.</p><p>Qingzhu sat motionless.</p><p>A cackling laughter echoed from within him.</p><p>"That Ning is your lifeline?"</p><p>"Let's see how long you can resist!  The Yuan Shen Gate, the Pure Yang Sect… I will hunt them all down!"</p><p>"I didn't know we even had a daughter.  After I completely absorb you, I will fully enjoy everything you've created for me—cultivation, family… I'll guide our disciples and daughter! After all, I am you, and you are me, haha…"</p><p>Qingzhu remained unmoved, his face contorted.</p><p>One eye was bloodshot, radiating evil and madness; the other held an incredibly gentle gaze,痴痴凝望着, fixed on the wooden sword resting across his knees.</p><p>Half sword immortal, half demon!</p><p>…</p><p>Sword Path.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his escape technique,  returned to the entrance of the Sword Path without stopping.</p><p>His expression was grave, lost in thought.</p><p>"This Qingzhu is not simple!"</p><p>Bai, who had been tense, finally relaxed and spoke, "He's not only cultivated to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, but his external manifestation's cultivation is no weaker than his own body, possibly even stronger. I don't know what happened to him to cause his external manifestation to backfire and end up like this. Otherwise, he seemed to treat you well, and we might have gained a powerful backer, making things much easier in the future."</p><p>"Daoist Bai, what do you think are the odds of Senior Qingzhu subduing the demonic spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed as he whispered.</p><p>After a moment's silence, Bai hesitated, "If I could recover my memory, perhaps I could see something. Since he said he can only rely on himself, it's probably not false; it's hard for outsiders to guess."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, a look of admiration on his face.  "Did you notice that Senior Qingzhu is different from others, Daoist Bai? Perhaps because I am a sword cultivator myself, I feel it more clearly. The most frightening thing isn't Senior Qingzhu's cultivation, but the sword intent that accompanies his every move, as if he himself is a divine sword.  Ancient texts say that Yuan Ying stage cultivators can achieve this, and those who do are destined to become unparalleled sword cultivators. This is extremely rare in the present day. Senior Qingzhu, in this impoverished era, has reached a level that even ancient sword cultivators aspired to. If nothing unexpected happens, he will definitely stand at the peak of the cultivation world in the future. I have great faith in him."</p>
