<h1>Chapter 806: Demonic Transformation</h1><p>Returning to Tianxing Island, Qin Sang visited the Xiang'an Auction House but didn't find Alchemist Yi.</p><p>An attendant explained that Alchemist Yi, along with other alchemists and artificers, had been urgently summoned and transported through a portal to the Demonic Sea due to a matter concerning the auction house.  A large group of experts from the three major trading alliances had also departed.  The details were confidential, and the attendant couldn't elaborate.</p><p>Qin Sang, engrossed in cultivating and comprehending his techniques, hadn't noticed such a significant mobilization by the trading alliances. Having lost contact with the Qiongyu Trading Company, he now lacked channels for gathering information.</p><p>His years with Qiongyu Trading Company had given him insights into how highly the three major alliances valued the Demonic Sea. It was understandable. The Canglang Sea was dominated by the righteous and demonic sects, with the Wu Tribe also lurking, making it a complex web of power.  The Demonic Sea provided the alliances with an ideal opportunity to rise amidst this struggle.</p><p>Such a large-scale mobilization suggested a significant event in the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Unperturbed, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling to continue his cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Unknowingly, a year passed in a flash.</p><p>Qin Sang remained on Tianxing Island, rarely venturing out.  He spent his days cultivating the "Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter" and his nights tempering his body with the power of the constellations.  Every few days, he would mingle with other cultivators, inquiring about Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>Another six months went by. Late one night, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state in the courtyard.</p><p>"Just over a year, and I've reached the peak of the first level! This rapid progress is thanks to my previous foundation. As my cultivation advances and the foundation evens out, the pace of cultivation will gradually slow. However, with the Star Spirit Net and the Jade Buddha, it shouldn't be too slow."</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists, eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Even at the first level, he could sense the remarkable changes. He felt a surge of power within him, possessing a degree of combat prowess even without utilizing his true essence.</p><p>This feeling of physical strength was vastly different from his time as a spellcaster. Even if their magical treasures were destroyed or their true essence restricted, top-tier body cultivators still possessed formidable power.</p><p>"But body cultivation is truly challenging. The pain I endure now is significantly greater than a year ago, while the sense of comfort is diminishing.  Reaching the second and third levels, the Star Essence tempering will likely bring bone-deep agony.  The technique is too overbearing.  The demon race, naturally born with strong bodies, can endure it, but for humans, it's quite difficult. Without immense willpower, it's hard to persevere. Perhaps in the future, I can supplement it with spirit herbs that strengthen the body..."</p><p>Qin Sang, confident in his willpower, showed no fear.</p><p>Moreover, the changes in the Ebony Sword over the past year had reinforced his resolve to continue on this path, regardless of the difficulties.</p><p>He hadn't neglected the cultivation of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter," and his progress had been rapid due to the life-and-death battles in the Seven Kills Hall.  However, as his cultivation improved, the Ebony Sword began showing signs of being unable to withstand the Killing Talismans.</p><p>He had initially anticipated that the sword could endure until the inscription of the sixth Killing Talisman. Unfortunately, the technique wasn't the original version, putting immense strain on the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Once the sword reached its breaking point, even if Qin Sang comprehended the essence of the sixth Killing Talisman, he wouldn't be able to inscribe it, hindering his cultivation progress.</p><p>That day wasn't far off.</p><p>Having spent so long on Tianxing Island, Qin Sang had abandoned hope of finding the Ten Sacred Trees.  There weren't even similar legends in the Canglang Sea, as if the Ten Sacred Trees had never appeared there, unlike the small region of Xiaohan.</p><p>Cultivating the "Demonic Refinement," a dual cultivation of magic and body, forcibly raising his strength to the peak of the late stage, was the only viable path he could see.</p><p>At least until the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall, Qin Sang had to prioritize the "Demonic Refinement" as his primary cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and looked up at the sky. "It's still early. I'll accumulate Star Essence now and attempt Star Essence Infusion tonight to break through to the second level!"</p><p>Bao Gu Mountain, rich in spiritual energy, was the ideal location for a breakthrough.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net rippled slightly, enveloping the space around Qin Sang.</p><p>He activated the technique, drawing the power of the constellations into his body, not for tempering, but to expel it, restraining it with the Star Spirit Net and gradually accumulating it.</p><p>Qin Sang spent the entire night preparing for the Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>Dawn approached.</p><p>The courtyard of the cave dwelling was bathed in brilliant light as Qin Sang's body radiated with dazzling starlight, illuminating the entire area. If not for the restrictive formations, other cultivators would surely have been alerted by this phenomenon.</p><p>"It's time!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he silently recited the incantations, his finger pointing at the Star Spirit Net.</p><p>A vortex appeared amidst the power of the constellations, suddenly swirling inwards and, with overwhelming force, surged into Qin Sang's body.  Spiritual energy also rushed in, draining the courtyard almost completely.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, as if struck by a heavy hammer, his face paling.</p><p>The Star Essence and spiritual energy rampaged within him, wreaking havoc. The pain was far more intense than during his previous cultivation.</p><p>His body tensed as he maintained his seated posture, enduring the agony, suppressing all distractions, and fully circulating the technique, guiding these forces to seek the opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p>The east gradually brightened, turning fiery red.</p><p>Until the sun rose, Qin Sang remained seated.</p><p>Suddenly, he let out a long howl and abruptly stood up.  His bones cracked as a layer of skin shed, carrying impurities that had been forced out.</p><p>After shedding his skin, his flesh became crystal clear, radiating strength with a gentle clench of his fist.</p><p>"Success! The second level of 'Demonic Refinement'!  With my physical body alone, I can now fight a Foundation Establishment cultivator without being at a disadvantage!"</p><p>After assessing his physical strength, Qin Sang returned to his spot, retrieved the bone flute, and began studying the cultivation method for Demonic Transformation.</p><p>Mastering Demonic Transformation would further enhance his combat power, but the scripture offered only a brief description, suggesting a close link between Demonic Transformation and visualizing a demon.</p><p>Unclear about the details, Qin Sang decided to proceed directly with the cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the process went surprisingly smoothly.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and began acting strangely, looking down at his body and then raising his hands for examination.</p><p>During cultivation, he had sensed a peculiar and potent power emerge within him. A realization dawned upon him: Demonic Transformation could significantly enhance his entire body or specific parts.</p><p>"Should I focus on my arms or refine my entire bodyâ€¦ I wonder if it's possible to sprout wings?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts drifted to the hooked-nosed man.</p><p>The man had wings on his back and a speed surpassing even his own, the fastest Core Formation cultivator he had ever encountered.</p><p>The Azure Roc happened to be a celestial bird.</p><p>If he could also sprout wings, combined with his talismans and Sword Qi Thunder Sound, he might surpass the Core Formation stage and attain a speed rivaling Nascent Soul patriarchs.</p><p>That would be the ultimate life-saving technique. Even if he provoked a Nascent Soul enemy in the future, he wouldn't be completely helpless.  Compared to that, enhancing his physical defense or strengthening his hands seemed far less crucial.</p>
