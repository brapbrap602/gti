Beyond that, she left no further restrictions.  Returning the island to its unremarkable appearance might allow it to remain hidden longer.</p><p>Leaving the island, Qin Sang moved more cautiously. Fortunately, the medicinal garden's location wasn't too deep within the Yun Cang Marsh.  Along the way, she only encountered a few small patrol squads from the Little Cold Region, and avoided any cultivators from the Sky Action League.  However, from her interactions with these patrols, she sensed the rising tension.</p><p>In an open expanse of water, a figure slowly emerged. Qin Sang looked around cautiously, finding no enemies, and then lowered her gaze to the calm surface of the water. The lake water was clear, and fish were clearly visible. Everything seemed normal; the surrounding spiritual energy showed no anomalies, and there were no signs of restrictions or spirit arrays.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then formed a strange hand seal and struck it into the water.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The spray was instantly smoothed over by Qin Sang. As the hand seal entered the water, the leisurely swimming fish suddenly disappeared, as if they were illusions. In their place, a huge dark shadow appeared in Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>The shadow was long and narrow, like a giant whale, swimming deep beneath the surface.</p><p>"Looks like I found the right place," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Before she could act, a change occurred within the shadow.  At its center, a point of white light suddenly flared.  Immediately, the entire shadow was violently agitated; countless points of white light appeared on the shadow, quickly converging towards the center, merging into one. In the blink of an eye, the white light at the shadow's center transformed into the rudimentary shape of a spirit sword.</p><p>The sword-shaped white light fluctuated, subtly shifting to point directly at Qin Sang.  Feeling the sharp aura emanating from the light, Qin Sang felt a chill run down her spine.  Her fellow disciples, without a word, had activated the restriction.</p><p>Considering the tense situation, Qin Sang understood. She quickly produced her own token and Qi Yuan Shou's orders, sending them into the shadow.</p><p>The order and token worked. After a moment, the white light in the shadow silently dissipated, and Qin Sang heard several voice transmissions asking questions. After answering them, several figures flew out of the shadow.</p><p>The leader was a cultivator at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, appearing to be about fifty years old.  Recalling the contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang remembered this person as the only mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding the medicinal garden, Jie Ying.</p><p>Before the upheaval, a mid-Foundation Establishment disciple, along with some Qi Condensation disciples, along with the medicinal garden's inherent spirit array, were sufficient to defend the place.</p><p>Jie Ying and his companions flew out of the water, arriving before Qin Sang.  His tone was slightly apologetic as he bowed, "Senior Brother Qin, we didn't know it was you. We offended you; it was our impoliteness, please forgive us!"</p><p>Jie Ying had broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage a few years after Qin Sang, so he should address her as Senior Sister.  And since Qin Sang was at the late-Foundation Establishment stage, outranking him in cultivation, Jie Ying was worried she might hold a grudge.</p><p>"Junior Brother Jie," Qin Sang returned the bow, unfazed.  "The situation is critical; Junior Brother's vigilance is understandable. There's no need for apologies. This isn't the place for idle chat; let's go inside."</p><p>Reassured by Qin Sang's words, Jie Ying quickly invited her into the medicinal garden. Along the way, Jie Ying introduced the other disciples, and Qin Sang greeted them all.</p><p>Besides Jie Ying, there was a cultivator at the early-Foundation Establishment stage named Mao Ji, and ten Qi Condensation disciples. This was dictated by the properties of the medicinal garden's spirit array.  One mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, supported by ten Qi Condensation disciples, could unleash the full power of the spirit array to repel enemies. Any additional Foundation Establishment cultivators could secretly leave to summon reinforcements if the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>The medicinal garden was built on an underwater island, which explained why it was invisible from the outside. The island was ten zhang below the surface, long and narrow, with the best location used to cultivate spirit herbs. Besides the garden itself, there were some caves created by cultivators, with tolerable spiritual energy.  The rest was wasteland, overgrown with aquatic plants, teeming with fish and shrimp.</p><p>“…Senior Brother Qin, this is the entire layout of the medicinal garden. What are Elder Qi's instructions? Please give us your orders, Senior Brother Qin. We will follow your lead from now on."</p><p>Jie took Qin Sang on a tour of the island before inquiring about her purpose. He readily relinquished his authority, his gaze filled with anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood Jie’s intentions.</p><p>Guarding the medicinal garden was a lucrative post.  Cultivators could steadily improve their skills, and upon harvesting and delivering the mature herbs to the sect, they received substantial rewards. This was just the official compensation.</p><p>However, under the current circumstances, remaining in the Yun Cang Marsh to guard the garden, forbidden to leave without the sect's orders under penalty of severe punishment, was a potentially deadly assignment!</p><p>Jie eagerly desired Qin Sang to replace him so he could escape and return to the sect.</p><p>“How long until the medicinal herbs in the garden are mature?” Qin Sang asked, avoiding Jie’s previous statement.</p><p>Jie, inwardly frantic, patiently replied, “Reporting to Senior Brother Qin, the herbs in the garden are of varying maturity. Due to recent events, the sect hasn't sent anyone to collect the herbs for a long time. Most are ready for harvest, but several auxiliary herbs for the Kanli Golden Elixir have a longer maturation period.  The longest-maturing one needs at least another ten years…”</p><p>This was the source of Jie’s anxiety. The situation in the Yun Cang Marsh was becoming increasingly tense.</p><p>Lately, he’d been restless, unable to focus on cultivation. He hid within the protective barrier, constantly monitoring the surroundings, frequently witnessing cultivators flying overhead, their movements hurried and anxious.  No one knew when this precarious situation would collapse.</p><p>“Ten years…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. This was a considerable time, but Qi Yuan Shou’s orders weren’t strict; taking most of the herbs would suffice.</p><p>He stopped beating around the bush and relayed Qi Yuan Shou’s secret instructions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jie was overjoyed upon hearing the message, his face etched with disbelief. He excitedly asked,  “Senior Brother Qin, is this true? Did Master Uncle Qi truly say that we don't need to worry about these herbs and can leave at any time if we encounter danger?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned at Jie, surprised by the man’s impulsive reaction considering his high cultivation level.  He said disapprovingly, “Master Uncle Qi’s words to me are not to be doubted. What orders did you receive previously?”</p><p>Jie’s excitement was uncontainable; he didn't notice Qin Sang’s displeasure. He lamented loudly, “Senior Brother Qin, you don’t know. We previously reported to the sect and received orders to remain on the island and await further instructions.  Regarding the island's herbs, particularly a herb called Seven-Leaf Moonflower, any shortage would result in a death sentence! I didn’t dare tell Mao and the others the truth…”</p>
