<h1>Chapter 1402: Heir of the Buddhist Lineage</h1><p>Chapter 1402: Heir of the Buddhist Lineage</p><p>As long as there's no backlash, a cultivator's bond with their life-bound insect is far closer than with other spirit insects.  </p><p>It's comparable to a cultivator's connection with their natal treasure – an intimate bond.</p><p>The closer and more trusting the spirit insect is to its master, the higher the success rate of the Ascending Spirit Ritual.</p><p>It can be said that the Ascending Spirit Ritual is tailor-made for life-bound insects, and it undoubtedly originated from the Wu tribe.</p><p>Does the Wu tribe in the Canglang Sea know about the Ascending Spirit Ritual?</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought.</p><p>He knew very little about Wu tribe traditions, but he could see that the Ascending Spirit Ritual was incredibly complex, far from an ordinary secret technique.</p><p>Obtaining the Ascending Spirit Ritual.</p><p>Whether or not he enters the Jinghai Sect, this trip would be worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang felt reassured and turned his attention to the Three Spirits Pan Wang Array.</p><p>The Three Spirits Pan Wang Array isn't complicated; three spirit insects simply need to be arranged in a Sancai formation, requiring precise control from the array master.</p><p>Of course, there's another requirement: the three spirit insects cannot violently resist during the activation of the array, so Qin Sang needs to pacify the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Additionally, an altar is needed.</p><p>The altar can be prepared in advance and set up during the array deployment.</p><p>However, the altar can only be used once.</p><p>The previous altar was already used on the Jade-biting Bee.</p><p>Over the past three days, the Qi cultivator went out on a trip, brought back the necessary materials, and Master Mu refined a small portion. It will still take another ten days to fully refine them.</p><p>Qin Sang spent some time understanding it and then went to help.</p><p>…</p><p>While they were busy.</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Under the vast expanse of water, a figure quietly lurked.</p><p>This was also in the Kongling Sea, but this person was extremely cautious, hiding far away, at a distance from Qin Sang and the others, so even the Sky-eye Butterfly didn't detect them.</p><p>Dressed in a black robe, he wore a yellow jade ring on his right thumb, engraved with two square characters — Nine Precepts!</p><p>This person was none other than the current island master of Nine Precepts Island — Master Zhijie!</p><p>This 'Nine Precepts' ring was passed down from Master Zhijie's master, the True Person Nine Precepts.</p><p>The master and disciple's monastic names are somewhat unusual. Some speculate that the name Zhijie (meaning 'observe precepts') might stem from his possession of the Nine Precepts ring.</p><p>But no one dared to question a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>At this moment, Master Zhijie had his aura completely suppressed, hidden underwater, sitting cross-legged and motionless, his hands clasped on his knees, holding a yellow orb.</p><p>Inside the orb was a scene of rippling water.</p><p>Deep within the water, the figures of Qin Sang and the others were faintly reflected.</p><p>However, the image was very blurry and distant, clearly indicating that Master Zhijie was afraid of being discovered and didn't dare to openly spy.</p><p>But it was enough.</p><p>Master Zhijie stared intently at the orb, his eyes showing a hint of anxiety.</p><p>"Could it be that they really have a way?"</p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the new face — Qin Sang.</p><p>Then, Master Zhijie let out an almost imperceptible sigh and silently retreated.</p><p>Shortly after, Master Zhijie flew out of the sea and sped north.</p><p>After flying out of the Kongling Sea and ensuring there was no risk, Master Zhijie slowed his flight, took out a jet-black token, his eyes revealing a struggle.</p><p>The token had no extra decorations, only two words: 'Mixed Demon'!</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Master Zhijie forcefully channeled his true energy into the token.</p><p>A black light blazed!</p><p>The token violently vibrated, suddenly releasing a thick demonic aura. The two characters 'Mixed Demon' twisted, gradually forming a demonic vortex, and then a chilling wave emanated from it.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Master Zhijie's expression changed slightly, and he threw the token away.</p><p>The token shattered into a puff of demonic energy, dissipating into thin air, and the surroundings returned to normal.</p><p>Then, Master Zhijie looked silently to the north, remaining where he was, as if waiting for something.</p><p>Several days later, a black light streaked across the sky, demonic energy billowing, heading straight for Master Zhijie.</p><p>Master Zhijie awoke from his meditation, flew into the air, and upon seeing the earth-shattering light, his face lit up, hurriedly adjusted his robes, and respectfully bowed towards the approaching figure, "Zhijie greets senior."</p><p>The arrival was none other than the master of Mixed Demon Island, the Mixed Demon Elder!</p><p>Although both were Yuan Ying cultivators, Zhijie treated him with the respect of a junior.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening roar split the air.</p><p>Without concealing his presence, the Mixed Demon Elder arrived before Master Zhijie in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Immediately, a cold voice echoed from the escaping light, "Chijie, that 混魔令 was a gift from me to your master.  Do you know the consequences of using my 混魔令?"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren's eyelids twitched, but his tone remained unusually calm. "I understand, senior.  Unless bestowed by the senior himself, anyone else using the 混魔令 must pay the price!"</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Before the words were finished, a figure landed near Chijie Zhenren. It was an old man, dressed in grey, with white hair and a kind face.</p><p>It was hard to believe that the 混魔 Old Man, who held sway over the boundless sea, and even the entire North Sea, looked like this.</p><p>His back was slightly bent, and he held a black bamboo staff.</p><p>The moment he retracted his escaping light, his aura also subsided, without the slightest powerful presence.</p><p>He looked like an ordinary, elderly man.</p><p>But upon seeing the 混魔 Old Man, even the strong Chijie Zhenren's heart tightened, and his movements became more cautious.</p><p>The 混魔 Old Man's eyes seemed somewhat cloudy. Looking at Chijie Zhenren, he said softly, "Considering you are the sole successor of Jiu Jie, if you give me a satisfactory reason, I will let this go."</p><p>"Thank you, senior!"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren didn't show any joy.  His expression turned serious. "I discovered the ruins of an ancient sect.  There's something very important to me inside, but others have also found the ruins. They are far more numerous, so I dared to ask for your help, senior."</p><p>"A mere ancient sect's ruins?"</p><p>The 混魔 Old Man snorted coldly.</p><p>Seeing the 混魔 Old Man's displeasure, Chijie Zhenren's heart pounded. He quickly said, "This sect's origin is extraordinary. It's a rare Buddhist sect in the cultivation world, called the Jinghai Sect!"</p><p>Upon hearing "Jinghai Sect," the 混魔 Old Man's eyes flashed, but he remained silent.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren didn't dare to be coy. He continued, "Many years ago, my master was fortunate enough to obtain part of the Jinghai Sect's heritage, and he considered himself a successor of the Jinghai Sect. Later, he occupied Jiu Jie Island to search for the Jinghai Sect ruins. Master only knew that the Jinghai Sect was in the Kongling Sea. He spent countless years without finding a single clue and died with regret.  I thought the Jinghai Sect had completely disappeared, but then an anomaly suddenly appeared. I was about to investigate, but someone got there first..."</p><p>"Jiu Jie! Chijie! So that's it!"</p><p>The 混魔 Old Man looked towards the Kongling Sea and chuckled, "In the entire boundless sea, fewer than ten people know about the Jinghai Sect, and besides myself, I thought no one else knew it was located in the Kongling Sea. So you and your master are Buddhist disciples.  I didn't discover that back then. Jiu Jie kept it very well hidden."</p><p>He seemed quite knowledgeable about the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren also showed surprise in his eyes.</p>
