<h1>Chapter 779: Sword Intent</h1><p>Chapter 779: Sword Intent</p><p>Within the Heavenly Tower, each level contains a teleportation hall.</p><p>The teleportation halls have arrays that allow one to leave the current level.</p><p>The scenery on each level differs.</p><p>"Besides the teleportation hall, these ruined buildings may also release puppets at any time.  Fellow cultivators, perhaps you could briefly mention your most effective abilities to better handle any surprise attacks,"</p><p>A man surnamed Di looked around at everyone and spoke.</p><p>The five cultivators were all at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, with varying strengths. The man surnamed Di and the old woman were the strongest, only a step away from the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The old woman rarely spoke first, and the group naturally centered around the man surnamed Di.</p><p>"This old woman possesses a Bagua mirror with decent defensive capabilities. With proper handling, it can even withstand attacks from late-stage cultivators," the old woman stated without reservation.</p><p>Everyone looked at her in surprise. Seeing the old woman produce a superior Bagua mirror compared to the others, they all praised her: "Daoist Su, you're too modest.  A mirror that can withstand attacks from late-stage cultivators shouldn't be described as merely 'decent'!"</p><p>Qin Sang said, "With Daoist Su's Bagua mirror, we needn't worry about our safety. Although Qin's cultivation is low, I have some skill in the way of the sword, having attained Sword Qi Thunder Sound and Sword Light Division, though I can only split off one sword light."</p><p>The man surnamed Di clapped his hands in delight: "Unexpectedly, Daoist Qin is also a sword master! Having comprehended Sword Qi Thunder Sound, your swordsmanship must be superb and your ability to seize opportunities exceptional. You would be perfect for delivering the killing blow to the puppets! These puppets are difficult to deal with, they can self-repair, and their weaknesses are very hidden, meaning opportunities are fleeting, but this should pose no problem for Daoist Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded: "Since Daoist Di says so, Qin will do my best.  However, I know very little about puppets and have had very little contact with them, so I am worried about encountering unfamiliar ones and missing opportunities…"</p><p>A female cultivator surnamed Yin suddenly interjected: "Daoist Qin, don't worry. After learning about the Heavenly Tower, Yin spent several years studying puppet techniques. I can warn you when necessary.  Furthermore, I have a secret technique that can sense the fluctuations of puppets, allowing me to detect even the most stealthy ones at close range. However, I need everyone to protect me so I can concentrate on maintaining the technique."</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was even more delighted.</p><p>In the lower levels of the Heavenly Tower, besides the ancient restrictions, the biggest obstacle is the various kinds of mechanical puppet beasts.</p><p>It's unknown how these puppets were created, but they are endless.  Cultivators have repeatedly entered the Heavenly Tower, yet their numbers never seem to decrease.</p><p>The female cultivator's skill perfectly counters the puppet beasts, bringing great convenience to the group.</p><p>Next, the other two also revealed their abilities.</p><p>The five immediately changed formations, with the other four protecting the female cultivator surnamed Yin at the center.</p><p>The puppets on the first three levels of the Heavenly Tower are not strong, equivalent to Foundation Establishment cultivators.  This was a practice run to prepare them for higher levels.</p><p>As soon as their formation was complete, a careless puppet charged at them.</p><p>They were passing a ruined wall at the time. A faint blue light flickered on the wall, and three dark shadows leaped out.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The man surnamed Di casually struck out with a palm, sending all three puppets flying.  Their chests were deeply dented.</p><p>These puppets resembled tigers, but they lacked fur and were instead composed of what seemed like pieces of bluish-grey stone.</p><p>After being struck by the man surnamed Di, two of the puppets made cracking sounds, then exploded with a 'boom'.</p><p>The puppet fragments scattered everywhere, only to disintegrate into dust before their very eyes, vanishing into darkness without a trace.  It was incredibly strange.</p><p>One puppet still retained its combat capabilities. Its long tail whipped out, transforming into a dark streak toward the man surnamed Di's face.</p><p>Sharp claws emerged from the darkness, shining coldly, dangerously close to his forehead.</p><p>The others made no move.</p><p>The man surnamed Di remained calm, shifting his hands. He easily stopped the tiger claw with one hand, a thoughtful expression on his face, while the other hand struck the puppet again, shattering it.</p><p>"Roughly the level of an early Foundation Establishment cultivator," the man surnamed Di turned to the others, describing his findings.  "It's said that the puppets get stronger on each level, following a pattern, roughly corresponding to the cultivator's realm.  Don't you think it's like a trial ground prepared by ancient cultivators for their descendants?"</p><p>"Not necessarily."</p><p>The old woman shook her head. "Isn't it said that there are special levels in the Heavenly Tower? The scenery there is completely different from the other levels, and those are the locations of various wonders."</p><p>The Celestial Tower holds countless secrets; only the ancient cultivators who lived here know its original purpose.”</p><p>The group moved towards the deeper darkness, their conversation continuing.  They encountered several attacks by puppet beasts along the way.  These creatures were similar in strength to those encountered earlier and were easily dealt with.</p><p>After traveling a considerable distance, they stopped, gazing at a vast expanse before them.</p><p>“Fellow cultivators, you all know what the Teleportation Hall looks like, right?  It’s somewhere in this area. Let’s split up and search.”</p><p>A man surnamed Di spoke, then flew off in a chosen direction.  The others dispersed, searching the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang flew towards the right.</p><p>He spotted a dilapidated hall and approached it.</p><p>He was actually quite interested in puppetry. From the Foundation Establishment to the Golden Core stage, his ability to consistently defeat cultivators of the same realm was inseparable from the use of corpse refinement and spirit beasts—external forces that had helped him overcome many powerful enemies and escape numerous crises.  The Celestial Tower’s puppets seemed to be able to revive after death. If he could unravel their secrets and create powerful puppet automatons, it would greatly enhance his strength.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the ruined hall, a swarm of tiger-shaped puppets attacked, some spewing mystic light and others slashing with their claws.</p><p>With a light flick of his Blackwood Sword, he easily killed most of the puppets.  Qin Sang kept two, capturing them to study as he continued searching for the Teleportation Hall.</p><p>Ultimately, he discovered with disappointment that these puppet beasts were likely connected to the Celestial Tower’s ancient prohibitions. Their ability to revive was impossible to replicate.  Even the materials of their bodies vanished after death; they disappeared inexplicably, even when stored in a Qianjun Ring.</p><p>With five people searching together, their efficiency increased considerably.</p><p>Qin Sang’s search yielded nothing, but he soon received a signal and immediately turned back.  Shortly afterwards, the five of them stood before a hall.</p><p>The hall floated in the darkness, not fixed in place, but drifting slowly. This hall was the best-preserved structure on the first level; even the roof tiles were undamaged. The ancient teleportation array was inside.</p><p>The hall was ancient, grand, and uniquely designed, its towering top resembling a sharp sword, emanating a powerful sword intent.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the hall, his mind tensed! This feeling was indescribable to others; only those who had cultivated the "Chapter on Cultivating the Soul Sword" would understand how extraordinary this sword intent was!</p>
