<h1>Chapter 351: The Ten Yama Banners (Bonus Chapter for Patron "Cape Horn Wind"!)</h1><p>Black Dragon Stone, Binding Spirit Rope.</p><p>Both of these talismans were of excellent quality, each with its own unique and profound function.  They felt quite comfortable to use. Qin Sang played with them for a while, refining and claiming them for his own.</p><p>Besides these two top-grade talismans, the other talismans in Liang Yan's storage pouch were of mediocre quality. Qin Sang only picked out one more, leaving the rest for Shi Hong for self-defense.</p><p>After refining the talismans, a black cloud of energy flew out of the storage pouch. As the black energy dispersed, ten black ghost banners materialized in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Liang Yan happened to possess four Yama Banners, three of which were given to him by Yue Wu.</p><p>It was likely Yue Wu's diligent service to the sect leader of the Yi Sect that earned him these three Yama Banners.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivator ambushed by Liang Yan held a much lower position than Yue Wu and only had a single Yama Banner, much to Liang Yan's frustration.</p><p>Over the years, Liang Yan tried every means to enhance all four Yama Banners to their peak strength.</p><p>However, he was afraid of being discovered by the Yuan Zhao Sect and didn't dare contact any remnants of the Kui Yin Sect. For decades, he lived in hiding, cautiously avoiding any actions that might draw attention.</p><p>Furthermore, crafting Yama Banners was extremely difficult.  Even with deception and their control over the Yin Sha Abyss, the Kui Yin Sect’s success rate remained extremely low. They couldn't even equip their Foundation Establishment disciples with the full set of six banners, let alone Liang Yan on his own.</p><p>Therefore, he was never able to acquire the complete set of six Yama Banners.</p><p>It was fortunate for Shi Hong that Liang Yan had four banners instead of five, otherwise, he wouldn't have been so patient and tolerated her delays until now.</p><p>These four Yama Banners were Qin Sang's greatest prize. With ten perfected ghost banners, he could deploy the complete Ten Yama Grand Formation.</p><p>The power of this formation was certainly far inferior to a true magical treasure.</p><p>It's important to note that even Talisman Treasures could only seal at most one-tenth of a magical treasure's power. The Ten Yama Formation's power could, at most, reach two or three times that of a Talisman Treasure.</p><p>But for Foundation Establishment cultivators, it was an absolute treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but reveal a look of delight. With this treasure, as long as he had the opportunity to set up the formation in advance, he wouldn't fear any cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Even when facing a pseudo-Core Formation cultivator, he would have a fighting chance!</p><p>It was a pity there was no opponent here for him to test the full power of the complete Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head regretfully.</p><p>The useful information obtained from Liang Yan wasn't much.  Regarding the antidote for the Heart-Devouring蛊, which Qin Sang desired most, Liang Yan knew nothing, only how to control the蛊 and threaten others.</p><p>"In the future, if I encounter another unfortunate soul poisoned by the same蛊, I could act the villain," Qin Sang thought with a self-deprecating smile.  Fortunately, he possessed the Void Spirit Seal, which could suppress the Heart-Devouring蛊's fluctuations to a very low level, so he wasn't too anxious.</p><p>However, one piece of information caught Qin Sang's attention and gave him hope for an antidote.</p><p>Liang Yan was well aware of the power of the Yama Banners and understood that with his own strength alone, it would be impossible to gather a complete set.  Therefore, while hiding in the Demonic Lands, he had been intentionally and unintentionally gathering information about the remnants of the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>Once he identified their whereabouts, he planned to confront them when his cultivation base was sufficient.</p><p>He actually managed to uncover some vague information.</p><p>This information corroborated what Qin Sang had heard from Old Di Que, lending it a certain degree of credibility.</p><p>According to Liang Yan's findings, the last Golden Core cultivator of the Kui Yin Sect was relentlessly pursued by the Yuan Zhao Sect. He was nearly cornered outside the Tian You Pass, escaped heavily injured, and entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, where he vanished without a trace, dead or alive.</p><p>To this day, the Yuan Zhao Sect hadn't publicly declared the death of this cultivator, suggesting that he might still be clinging to life.</p><p>Several Foundation Establishment cultivators also escaped with him.  These individuals were core members of the Kui Yin Sect, some even direct disciples of the three Golden Core masters.  They would certainly know the antidote for the Heart-Devouring蛊.</p><p>These remnants of the Kui Yin Sect lived in constant fear, having nowhere to go but to gather under the command of their injured Golden Core master.</p><p>Based on Liang Yan's understanding of the Kui Yin Sect and the clues he had gathered, he speculated that these remnants might be hiding in plain sight, operating near Qing Yang City.</p><p>But finding them would be difficult.</p><p>The Yuan Zhao Sect was relentless in eradicating evil, backed by the Wu Ji Sect.  Although the situation had calmed down, these cultivators were likely terrified.</p><p>Even within the heartland of Demonic sects, they wouldn't dare reveal their identities. After all, the Yuan Zhao Sect wasn't the only one looking to finish them off. There was no sense of honor among Demonic sects.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered deeply.</p><p>Once his cultivation base improved, he could visit Qing Yang City and, like this time, use the Heart-Devouring蛊 as bait to lure out the remnants of the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>If successful, not only could he obtain the antidote, but there might also be unexpected gains.</p><p>However, this was a risky endeavor.</p><p>One risk was attracting several cultivators at once, leading to a siege.</p><p>The worst-case scenario was the surviving Golden Core master also being nearby, turning the tables on him.</p><p>Careful planning was essential.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang unknowingly crossed numerous snowy mountains.  His eyes met with endless white snow, a desolate landscape devoid of human presence, with even birds and beasts being rare.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang descended from the sky, landing on a snowy mountain peak. After scanning the surroundings with his divine sense and confirming that no one was nearby, he chose a spot with the richest spiritual energy within the mountain range, cleaved open a cave with his sword, and set up several layers of protective formations.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Qin Sang retrieved Liang Yan from the Corpse Puppet Pouch.  After capturing him alive, Qin Sang hadn't yet had the time to refine him into a corpse puppet. He planned to complete this here before continuing his journey.</p><p>Back in the Kui Yin Sect, Liang Yan had attempted to offer Qin Sang to Yue Wu as a sacrifice for the Yama Banners.</p><p>Facing Liang Yan, Qin Sang naturally felt no pity.</p><p>The first two Heavenly Corpse Talismans he refined had already been used. However, while surveilling Liang Yan in Feng Cang City, Qin Sang found time to refine two more Heavenly Corpse Talismans using another Soul-Attracting Grass, which he would now use on Liang Yan.</p><p>Although he failed once again, Qin Sang was becoming increasingly proficient in refining Heavenly Corpse Talismans, now able to create one in less than two days.</p><p>Qin Sang paused to consider. He had quite a few pressing matters on his hands.</p><p>He set Liang Yan aside for the moment, retrieved a piece of spiritual wood, and fed it to his Ebony Sword.</p><p>Then, he took out the last Soul-Attracting Grass and began refining Heavenly Corpse Talismans.</p><p>To Qin Sang's delight, this time he succeeded without a single failure. By the seventh day, all three Heavenly Corpse Talismans were complete!</p><p>Now, he had five Heavenly Corpse Talismans at his disposal!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to Liang Yan.  He then prepared the five Yin elements and the Heavenly Corpse Talismans, methodically carrying out the process, erasing Liang Yan's consciousness.</p><p>Everything proceeded smoothly, leaving only the final step of fusing Earthly Yin energy.  Then he would have another living corpse.</p><p>However, this final step was also the most prone to accidents. Whether these two living corpses could be truly refined remained uncertain.</p><p>Chapter 351: Ten Yama Banners (Additional Chapter for Patron Cape Wind!)</p><p>Black Dragon Stone, Soul Binding Rope.</p><p>Both talismans were of excellent quality, each with its own unique function.
