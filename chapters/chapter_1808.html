<h1>Chapter 1799: The Venomous Domain</h1><p>Refined Void cultivators were as elusive as dragons, rarely seen.</p><p>The group set off, still reeling from the battle.</p><p>The jeweled palanquin led the way, leaving a fiery trail in the void, like a long comet's tail.</p><p>Mindful of Qin Sang and the others, Wan Zhenren didn't push their speed to the limit.</p><p>They sped for over a thousand li.</p><p>Finally, they observed the celestial phenomena again.</p><p>In the distant east, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled amidst a torrential downpour, accompanied by a shower of wondrous flowers and golden lotuses springing from the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was a celestial phenomenon triggered by a Refined Void cultivator, most likely where their true body resided. But the distance was too vast to discern whether it was Da Zhenren or the black roc.</p><p>The phenomenon drifted eastward, growing further away from them, soon vanishing from their sight.</p><p>The battle between Da Zhenren and the Demon King was beyond their intervention. They dared not linger to observe, so they could only regretfully turn south and return.</p><p>The return journey was remarkably smooth.</p><p>With the Demon King occupied by Da Zhenren, the Ghost Fang Kingdom’s army was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>As they neared Ju Mountain Prefecture, the jeweled palanquin ahead halted. Wan Zhenren stepped out and landed before them, bowing slightly. "There should be no demons blocking the path ahead, fellow Daoists. It is time for us to part ways.  I will report your contributions to the Prefecture Altar in full detail."</p><p>“Many thanks, Wan Zhenren!”</p><p>The other True Cultivators returned the courtesy.</p><p>Wan Zhenren nodded, returned to the palanquin, and with a surge of speed, transformed into a rainbow of fire, streaking across the sky.</p><p>Watching the fiery arc disappear into the horizon, the group continued south, returning directly to Ju Mountain Prefecture and entering the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, cupping his hands towards Zhi Jian Zhenren and the others. "Fellow Daoists, I must go to the Dao Court. I shall take my leave now. Until we meet again."</p><p>Having earned his merit, he could proceed directly to the Dao Court for his promotion.</p><p>Since he hadn't earned this qualification by completing a Dharma Decree, there was no need to visit Zhan Gui Zhenren.</p><p>The True Cultivators all knew Qin Sang hadn’t yet been promoted to the third rank. They understood his urgency.</p><p>Having their True Essence suppressed at the Nascent Soul stage for so long, they wouldn’t be able to bear it either, longing for the day they could unleash their full power.</p><p>It was ironically Qin Sang, who had been hampered the most, that had contributed the most. Everyone couldn't help but lament the unpredictability of life.</p><p>Qin Sang single-handedly slaying a mid-stage Soul Manifestation Demon Marquis was more than enough to earn him the promotion.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>The True Cultivators returned the greeting.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren smiled. "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, after your promotion, if you haven't found a place to settle, my Sword Heart Island is rather spacious. I shall always keep a cave dwelling reserved for you."</p><p>Seeing Zhi Jian Zhenren's intention to recruit Qin Sang, the others weren't surprised at all. Some even regretted not speaking up sooner.</p><p>Through their recent experiences, they had learned that Qin Sang wasn't a sect disciple but a true rogue cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, he was a rare cultivator of both Dharma and body refinement. After his promotion, his True Essence would recover, and his strength would be unparalleled.</p><p>Being able to recruit such an expert without worrying about conflicts of interest was tempting for anyone.</p><p>"I thank Zhi Jian Zhenren in advance!"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, accepting the offer immediately, leaving no opportunity for others to speak.</p><p>He had received Zhi Jian Zhenren's help many times throughout this endeavor, and Qin Sang naturally remembered this favor.</p><p>Zhi Jian Zhenren had no ties to major power struggles and was also a sword cultivator, allowing for future discussions on swordsmanship.</p><p>And their temperaments were compatible.</p><p>These reasons were enough for Qin Sang to make his choice.</p><p>Zhen Ru Venerable stood beside Zhang Zhenren, seemingly wanting to speak but stopping himself. In the end, he pressed his palms together and only offered a farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Zhen Ru Venerable seemed to have something to say but was hindered by the presence of others.</p><p>He guessed it might be related to the Seven Masters' Buddha Seal. With the Daoist sects reigning supreme in this world, Buddhist esoteric arts were certainly rare.</p><p>If the other party wanted to trade, it wasn't entirely out of the question. It depended on what treasures Mirror Terrace Temple was willing to offer in exchange.</p><p>Soon to be back on track, Qin Sang needed to gather treasures for cultivation.</p><p>Since Zhen Ru Venerable didn't speak, Qin Sang wouldn't inquire. He bowed in all directions, bidding farewell to everyone.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun, Bo Xian Shanren, and the Yun Wei siblings also hadn't left.</p><p>After Qin Sang had bid farewell to everyone, Qing Dan Yuanjun stepped forward. "Zhenren is heading to the Dao Court. We are also returning to our sect. We might as well travel together for mutual support. What are your thoughts, Zhenren?"</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>The group split into two.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others turned west, arriving at the Right Belt Pass of Star Island Immortal Lake. They boarded the Minor Teleportation Formation, transferring multiple times, and after several days of flight, entered White Stone Prefecture.</p><p>Northeast of White Stone Prefecture.</p><p>Dong Hua Garrison.</p><p>The group barely rested along the way, arriving at the Garrison Altar dusty and weary.</p><p>Entering the immortal city and observing the bustling crowds, Qin Sang stopped, bowing slightly. "I must go to the White Stone Prefecture Altar. What are your plans, fellow Daoists?"</p><p>They had become quite familiar during their journey, sharing pleasant conversations.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to undergo his promotion at the North Pole Exorcism Court and visit Master Ling Xu.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and the others were returning to Mole Cricket Mountain, located in Zhong Mao Prefecture, a different direction from his. It was time to part ways.</p><p>"Zhenren, why the rush? We have traveled thousands of li without a moment's rest. Why don't we take a break and wash away the dust of our journey?"</p><p>With that, Qing Dan Yuanjun instructed Yun Wei and his sister, "Quickly go to the best restaurant in this garrison and arrange the finest spiritual feast."</p><p>"Disciples obey!"</p><p>Yun Wei and his sister immediately took their leave.</p><p>Unable to refuse such hospitality, Qin Sang didn't decline.</p><p>His eyes flickered, realizing Qing Dan Yuanjun had another motive for the invitation.</p><p>The best restaurant in the city, called the Summoning Immortals Pavilion, was located in the city center. It was said to be a Dao Court property, its business exceptionally booming, frequented by extraordinary individuals.</p><p>The finest spiritual feast was set in the clouds, amidst rosy clouds and ethereal music, as if one were truly in a celestial realm.</p><p>Having something to discuss, Qing Dan Yuanjun requested a private room. Once the feast was served, she dismissed the attendants.</p><p>Yun Wei and his sister, dignified Nascent Soul cultivators, stood guard outside.</p><p>Looking at the table laden with delicacies and immortal wine, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel his appetite stirred, marveling at the extravagant cost of the feast.</p><p>The fine wine was comparable to spiritual liquid, the plates filled with spiritual fruits, and the dishes made with the essence of demon beast flesh.</p><p>Each bite was not only a delightful sensation for the palate but also replenished vital energy and enhanced True Essence, truly luxurious.</p><p>Of course, for Deity Transformation cultivators, these were only minor supplements.</p><p>Three rounds of drinks and five courses later.</p><p>"These past few days, has Zhenren gained any new insights into the strange poison within my disciple?"</p><p>Hearing Qing Dan Yuanjun's question, Qin Sang's spirit perked up.  They had finally reached the main topic.</p><p>He shook his head, replying, "I can confirm that I have never encountered this poison before, nor have I heard of such properties."</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun nodded disappointedly, then changed the subject. "Zhenren must be curious about the origin of this poison. I thought Zhenren would ask…"</p><p>Qin Sang adopted a posture of eager listening, not denying his curiosity.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren exchanged glances, then began their story.  "This matter dates back some time. Years ago, I entered the Ju Mountain Prefecture Altar, hoping to broaden my knowledge.  I inadvertently stumbled upon a Venomous Domain. This domain wasn't recorded in our sect's scriptures, and I'm unsure if I was the first to discover it. After all, while the interior of the Prefecture Altar is stable, it is also constantly changing..."</p><p>Pausing, Qing Dan Yuanjun glanced at Qin Sang, seeing no change in his expression, and continued, "That Venomous Domain was very peculiar.  I consider myself quite skilled in poison arts, rarely surpassed by others, yet I couldn't comprehend it. This piqued my curiosity, and I decided to explore it personally."</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang asked, "What did Yuanjun discover? Was it a grand poison technique left behind by an ancient mighty figure, or a peculiar illusion formed by the collision of various strange forces?"</p><p>"I suspect it's the former."</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun admitted frankly, "I did make some gains, but they were either incomplete or damaged, at best capable of slightly improving the strength and understanding of my disciples, which was still beneficial to the sect. But my own strength was insufficient, and I only explored the outer perimeter of the Venomous Domain.  So, I invited Fellow Daoist Bo Xian to assist, and instructed the core disciples to practice a special formation, preparing to delve deeper into the domain. Unexpectedly, it harmed them..."</p><p>Speaking of this, Qing Dan Yuanjun looked towards her disciples at the door, her expression turning somber.</p><p>"Fate is unpredictable.  It cannot be blamed on Yuanjun, only on the demons stirring up trouble," Bo Xian Shanren consoled.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood the story, realizing the truth.</p><p>He pondered, "Yuanjun risked so much.  Could it be that the depths of the Venomous Domain conceal some great treasure, holding significant importance to Yuanjun and your esteemed sect?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun quickly regained her composure, gently shaking her head. "Whether or not there are treasures is merely my speculation.  We can only confirm after entering the Venomous Domain and seeing for ourselves. I wonder if Zhenren is interested in this Venomous Domain?"</p><p>During their journey, she had deliberated for a long time and ultimately decided to reveal the truth to Qin Sang and invite his assistance.</p><p>Firstly, Mole Cricket Mountain had suffered heavy losses this time, and setting up that peculiar formation required their core disciples.  They lacked the manpower to reconstruct the formation.</p><p>They had to rely on external help.</p><p>Secondly, she didn't want to alert other sects specializing in poison cultivation, so she could only seek help from outside the Daoist sects.</p><p>And cultivators proficient in this path were uncommon, and those with high cultivation even rarer.</p><p>Most importantly, the poison-neutralizing techniques Qin Sang had demonstrated were extraordinary.</p><p>That strange poison, which even she could only suppress temporarily, had led to the tragic deaths of several disciples, yet Qin Sang had neutralized it.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, his words laden with meaning. "Yuanjun has invested countless efforts into this Venomous Domain. Are you willing to share it with an outsider?"</p><p>To this, Qing Dan Yuanjun answered frankly, "I am inferior to Zhenren in the art of neutralizing poisons. But in my opinion, Zhenren's Dao Foundation lies elsewhere. Some treasures would be of no use to you."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned upon hearing this. "That strange poison must be hidden within the depths of the Venomous Domain, right? The Venomous Domain is so dangerous, and there's no guarantee I'll find what I need.  Why should I risk it?"</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun had already prepared her response.  "I only require one item. Besides that, the other treasures will be chosen by the three of us in turn. As long as you help me obtain this item, I have another reward… a superior poison path body refinement esoteric art. How about that?"</p><p>Her tone was full of confidence.  Since Qin Sang was a body refinement cultivator and also proficient in poison techniques, he couldn't possibly be unmoved.</p><p>"Body refinement esoteric art?"</p><p>Qin Sang indeed showed interest.</p><p>He still didn't know how long it would take to refine the Qilin Source Seed. With his divine sense restricted, strengthening his physical body was another crucial way to increase his strength.</p><p>More importantly, this art was a poison path esoteric art, which seemed to involve tempering the body with potent poisons.</p><p>With the Poison Bead in hand, this art might greatly benefit him.</p><p>In truth, when Qing Dan Yuanjun mentioned the Venomous Domain, Qin Sang was already interested. He had long sought potent poisons for the Poison Bead to devour. His subsequent objections were merely a ploy to extract more benefits.</p><p>It had indeed yielded results.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired further. Qing Dan Yuanjun didn't reveal the esoteric art but did explain some key aspects.</p><p>She dared to call it a superior esoteric art, so she naturally wasn't exaggerating. But this esoteric art had a major drawback: using poison to temper the body first harmed oneself. If one couldn't neutralize the poison in time, as toxins accumulated within the body, it became extremely dangerous.</p><p>It could be described as a perilous esoteric art of courting death to achieve life.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang was proficient in neutralizing poisons, she offered this art.  Others would surely refuse.</p><p>"Alright, for the next expedition, I will accompany the two of you!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate for long, agreeing to the proposal.</p><p>However, he had some concerns he couldn't ignore.</p><p>"The Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom just clashed at the Ju Mountain Prefecture Altar. I'm afraid it won't be peaceful there in the future," Qin Sang worried.</p><p>Having witnessed a Refined Void cultivator's power firsthand, Qin Sang was even more determined to avoid being drawn into the battlefield between the two major forces.</p><p>"Rest assured, Zhenren. After this incident, for at least the next decade or two, the Ghost Fang Kingdom and the Dao Court shouldn't engage in conflict again. We'll return to prepare and strive to depart as soon as possible," Qing Dan Yuanjun explained.</p><p>Seeing Qing Dan Yuanjun's confident expression, Qin Sang thought they must have discovered something that he had missed by deliberately avoiding the conflict.</p><p>He didn't press further, nodding in agreement. "In that case, I'll strive to be promoted quickly and consolidate my cultivation. Before you depart, Fellow Daoists can send a message to Pot Within City."</p><p>They exchanged contact methods and finalized the matter.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun's tone became lighter as she reminded him, "We will prepare the necessary supplies for entering the Venomous Domain. Zhenren should also make some preparations."</p><p>Everyone was satisfied.</p><p>The group didn't linger, leaving the Summoning Immortals Pavilion and heading to the Teleportation Hall where the Minor Teleportation Formation was located.</p><p>Each activation of the Minor Teleportation Formation required a certain number of people.</p><p>Qing Dan Yuanjun and the others went first. Qin Sang waited in the Teleportation Hall, pondering the Venomous Domain.</p><p>Since it was only a preliminary agreement, Qin Sang wasn't yet clear about the exact location of the Venomous Domain, only knowing the general vicinity.</p><p>He agreed to the invitation not only because he coveted the treasures and esoteric art within the Venomous Domain but also for a reason he couldn't reveal to others.</p><p>This Venomous Domain was located deep within the Prefecture Altar. Perhaps by traversing it, he could open another path, helping him search for the path of ascension.</p><p>Before long, enough people gathered, and the Minor Teleportation Formation activated.</p><p>After several transfers, Qin Sang returned to the White Stone Prefecture Altar.</p><p>Stepping out of the Teleportation Hall, Qin Sang didn't rush to visit Master Ling Xu. Instead, he walked towards the magnificent immortal palaces in the depths of the Prefecture Altar.</p><p>He had been awestruck by the sights here when he first arrived at the Prefecture Altar.</p><p>Now, he saw that these were merely superficial, with more wondrous sights hidden, unknown to most.</p><p>What was revealed was at most comparable to the golden halls outside the Ju Mountain Prefecture Altar.</p><p>He walked briskly towards the immortal palaces.</p><p>A white jade archway came into view, inscribed with the five characters "White Stone Prefecture Altar."</p><p>And also the words "North Pole Exorcism Court."</p><p>This was the heart of the North Pole Exorcism Court, where the Dao Court True Monarchs and Grand True Cultivators resided.</p><p>Promotion to the third rank had to be conducted at the Prefecture Altar. Otherwise, Qin Sang couldn't approach these powerful Daoist figures so closely.</p><p>He calmed his mind, restrained his aura, and stepped towards the archway. As he approached, a voice called out from above, "Who goes there!"</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the talisman Wan Zhenren had given him, flashed it towards the sky, and declared in a deep voice, "I am Qing Feng!"</p>
