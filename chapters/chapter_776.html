<h1>Chapter 768: Snatching Food from the Jaws of Death</h1><p>Chapter 768: Snatching Food from the Jaws of Death</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>The pack of ferocious beasts bared their fangs, their purple eyes wide with fury, their low growls a warning.  They hadn't expected another creature to compete for the purple crystal; even the leader was momentarily stunned, caught off guard.</p><p>After all, in this territory, only their own kind dared consume the purple crystal.</p><p>But seeing the two-headed… beast snatching at the crystal, the beasts exploded with rage.</p><p>The leader roared, the entire pack going berserk. Their fleshy wings merged into a single, overwhelming mass, a sea of purple flames erupting, instantly engulfing two shadowy figures.</p><p>The two-headed… beast countered with a whirlwind attack, then fled, narrowly escaping the inferno.</p><p>At that moment, a streak of light shot from a crevice in the rock, its speed astonishing. In the blink of an eye, it reached the center of the small lake.</p><p>Most of the beasts were chasing the two-headed… beast; only the leader remained at the lake's center, waiting to seize the crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang's appearance caught the leader by surprise.</p><p>It opened its maw, spewing purple fire.</p><p>But before the flames could reach Qin Sang, they were dispersed by the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire was far superior to the leader's beast fire, but due to Qin Sang's limited cultivation, the flames were already fading after dispelling the purple fire, on the verge of extinction.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to activate the Ten Directions Yama Banner to continue attacking and drive back the leader.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, the leader reacted as if it had seen a ghost, its face contorted in terror, its cry distorted, instinctively retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He hadn't anticipated this reaction. The leader's fear of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire was so profound that its first instinct was to flee.</p><p>Though he didn't understand why, this clearly worked to his advantage.</p><p>In the Purple Mist Wasteland, once a beast went berserk, it would fight to the death. Qin Sang had expected a struggle to drive back the leader.</p><p>Such an opportunity was not to be missed. Qin Sang immediately abandoned the pursuit of the leader, his figure flashing as he bypassed the beast and lunged toward the vortex at the center of the lake.</p><p>The purple crystal was rising higher and higher within the vortex. Two more cracks appeared on its surface, causing it to shatter into three pieces that shot upwards with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the vortex, his true energy surging, forming a giant hand to grasp the nearest fragment.</p><p>His true energy hand withstood the vortex's force, successfully seizing the crystal.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>The instant his true energy touched the crystal, a surge of intense purple energy poured from the crystal into his true energy. In the blink of an eye, his true energy was completely dyed purple.</p><p>The purple energy spread rapidly, following the connection of his true energy, heading straight for his body.</p><p>“Such a potent poison! More terrifying than the Purple Mist, it can even corrupt true energy!”</p><p>Qin Sang was alarmed. He finally understood why the beasts of the Purple Mist Wasteland feared the crystal, only daring to consume tiny fragments.</p><p>He hadn't anticipated this unforeseen complication.</p><p>He didn't want this virulent poison to enter his body.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang couldn't think of a solution.</p><p>With no choice, he could only abandon his attempt to subdue the crystal, severing the connection with his true energy.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, muttering to himself that this was tricky.</p><p>If he waited for the crystal to rise from the vortex on its own, most of it would dissipate in the Purple Mist.</p><p>He possessed few prohibitions effective against poisons, especially a potent poison of this kind.  Ordinary prohibitions couldn't suppress the crystal.</p><p>Only the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, clearly more powerful than the crystal, held any promise.</p><p>When subduing the Cold Flame, he had created several sealing prohibitions that harnessed the power of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire. He wondered if they would work on the crystal.</p><p>A whooshing sound reached his ears from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine, sensing the approaching wind.</p><p>The leader had recovered.</p><p>At the same time, the beasts that had chased the two-headed… beast returned, enraged, leaving him little time.</p><p>Without turning, Qin Sang unleashed a stream of Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>As expected, the leader was terrified of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, unwilling to confront it. With a roar, it twisted its body and quickly evaded.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his gaze fixed on the flying crystal, his eyes flashing, about to attempt to retrieve it again when he noticed the fat silkworm raising its body, spitting out incredibly refined strands of multicolored light toward the crystal.</p><p>“How could I forget about it! The crystal is exactly what this guy wants. It’s quite clever to offer assistance.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly.  It wasn't that he'd overlooked the fat silkworm's ability; it was simply that the silkworm wasn't his inherent spirit insect, and communication took time – time he clearly didn't have in this situation.</p><p>A shimmering thread swiftly descended onto the purple crystal, quickly wrapping around it and forming a thin, iridescent cocoon.  Qin Sang's true energy then enveloped the cocoon, preventing the potent poison from spreading.  Qin Sang gestured, and the cocoon settled into a jade box in his hand.</p><p>The purple crystal, about the size of a fist, felt weightless in his hand. He was curious about its formation, but the depths of the vortex were impenetrable.  He glanced at the lake's center, quickly storing the jade box in his spatial ring, and turned to the fat silkworm.</p><p>After expelling the iridescent threads, the silkworm's energy plummeted; this process clearly consumed far more than emitting the iridescent aura. Yet, it persevered, continuing to spin threads towards the largest remaining crystal, driven by its appetite.</p><p>At that moment, the entire beast horde went wild.  Witnessing Qin Sang take a large crystal – their most precious treasure – ignited their fury.  Seeing him attempt to claim another, they descended into a frenzy.  Using the Nine Nether Infernal Fire to repel them was no longer an option.</p><p>The leader unleashed a deafening roar that echoed through the chasm. Qin Sang's expression changed; the roar sounded peculiar, as if summoning something.  His suspicion was soon confirmed.</p><p>A resonating bellow, like a muffled thunderclap, answered from the chasm's depths. The sound left Qin Sang breathless, his blood surging.</p><p>"A stronger leader lurks within the chasm!"</p><p>His face fell as he sensed a powerful force rushing towards them from the chasm's depths.  He didn't hesitate, quickly retrieving the crystal bound in iridescent threads.  With a backhanded strike, his sword energy carved a path, deflecting the leader's claws.</p><p>The remaining beasts surged forward, a tidal wave of fury. Qin Sang's expression darkened. He then unleashed a powerful palm strike towards the vortex's center.</p><p>The last crystal shattered on impact, scattering countless fragments like sparkling fireworks. A purple mist engulfed and dissolved some of the pieces.</p><p>The near-rabid beasts, eyes bloodshot, turned their attention to the scattered fragments. The pressure on Qin Sang lessened considerably, but he felt no relief.  He fought his way out, joined his waiting twin-headed  [Name of creature/mount, kept untranslated], and fled at top speed.</p>
