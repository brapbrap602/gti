<h1>Chapter 1688 A Hint of Fragrance</h1><p>Mo Xingdao was silent as a cicada in winter.</p><p>When the Green Fox Saint King spoke, he recalled the incident at the Yi Bao Assembly.  He had disguised himself to attend, discovered the secret of the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal, and planned to exchange it with Qin Sang using the Thousand Knot Divine Net.  Fearing the Grand Elder of the Qiong Ying Sect, he arranged a trade outside.  Unexpectedly, Qin Sang was attacked by a demon king.</p><p>He had intended to help, hoping to curry favor and make it easier to persuade Qin Sang. However, after seeing Qin Sang fight back, he realized Qin Sang was likely the Fire Demon Su Zinan was searching for, and changed his mind.</p><p>Though he was under Su Zinan's influence, he had no intention of sacrificing himself for him, nor would he forge a deadly feud with powerful enemies because of Su Zinan. He decided to remain hidden.</p><p>Only when he saw an opportunity did Mo Xingdao make his move, deliberately using an obscure magical technique.</p><p>The green-furred rat demon escaped, abandoning two subordinates. Two crocodile demons, one dead and one wounded, were captured.  They used a soul-searching technique on the surviving crocodile demon, uncovering fragments of memory.  This demon held a relatively high position among the East Sea demons, yet its memories contained absolutely nothing about the Saint King's disciples!</p><p>Mo Xingdao discreetly glanced at the Green Fox Saint King.  Whether the two crocodile demons were actually the Saint King's disciples was irrelevant.  The Green Fox Saint King publicly declared it, making a lie into truth.</p><p>Strictly speaking, Mo Xingdao was an accomplice. He wouldn't be foolish enough to defend Qin Sang; he would bury the matter forever, never mentioning it to anyone.</p><p>Only the Hui Guang Saint could stop the Green Fox Saint King.  Looking at Hui Guang Saint, Mo Xingdao saw the Demon-Sealing Stake, surrounded by heart fire, now glowing with blood red.  The Hui Guang Saint was using a blood refining technique to repair the treasure, seemingly unable to be distracted.</p><p>In the mountains, Qin Sang heard the Green Fox Saint King's shout, realizing the situation was hopeless. He had personally searched the crocodile demons' souls, knowing the truth – the possibility of them being Nascent Soul disciples was extremely low. But so what?  Even if he was ambushed and forced to fight back, he had no chance to explain.</p><p>The Green Fox Saint King acted decisively, killing without hesitation and sealing Mount Di Shou, deliberately concealing the connection between him and his avatar.  Denial was useless, as Ghost Mother once said, "I always take what I want."  A Nascent Soul demon king certainly had the power and confidence to do so.</p><p>'Whoosh!'  The Saint King's oppressive aura formed a substantial storm; the golden clouds, about to merge, seemed to solidify.  Three Green Fox Saint Kings entered the sword array simultaneously.  Identical in appearance, equally enchanting and alluring, yet their expressions revealed three distinct personalities, making it impossible to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, dragging his main body, plummeted, trapped by Su Zinan within the sword stars. The avatar's true essence was nearly depleted.  Qin Sang's main body was in even worse condition, desperately trying to regulate his chaotic energy.  His gaze met the three illusory forms of the Green Fox Saint King.</p><p>"I just presented a treasure to subdue the demons, saving the day, and you repay me with treachery? Are you not afraid of public scorn?" Qin Sang, mobilizing his true essence, roared in unison with his avatar.</p><p>"Surrender and confess to what happened that day.  I will acknowledge your merits, punishing only the ringleader.  Sever ties with the villain and save yourself."</p><p>Everyone knew this was directed at the avatar, unaware that the avatar and Qin Sang were one.  This was a classic case of "calling a deer a horse."</p><p>Despite the words, the Green Fox Saint King showed no mercy.  The three illusory forms had pure white eyes, lacking pupils, their gazes devoid of killing intent, only a chilling indifference.  They regarded him like an ant.</p><p>The next moment, the three figures shot towards Qin Sang, looking down as they raised their slender, jade-like fingers, pointed at him.  A faint green light gathered at their fingertips, illuminating their already translucent bodies, making them appear like carved jade.</p><p>'Swish!'  The green light shot out like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted; a sharp pain pierced his brow. Without hesitation, he channeled his barely recovered true essence into the Mani Pearl.</p><p>'Whoosh!'  Black flames erupted from Qin Sang's body, faintly glowing gold within, instantly enveloping him.  The moment the protective fire shield formed, the green lightning struck.</p><p>'Boom!' Three waves of fire surged across the shield, the green and black light mixing, exploding outwards.  The aftermath was immense; Qin Sang's figure was swallowed by the chaotic phenomenon.</p><p>A thunderous roar shook the protective barrier, a terrifying blow.  Unexpectedly, the barrier, incredibly resilient, withstood the combined attack of the three illusory forms of the Qinghu Saint King. The blue lightning was blocked.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew the immense pressure he endured. Inside the barrier, his body trembled as he strained to maintain it, his recently recovered true energy rapidly depleting.  The good news was that this actually lessened the strain on his meridians.</p><p>Seeing their attack fail, the three illusory forms’ eyes flashed with cold light. Three bolts of blue lightning converged, yet there was no ripple or sound.</p><p>Suddenly, the three bolts merged into a single drop of azure liquid, within which intertwined blue lightning could be faintly seen, as if merging.</p><p>The fusion complete, the liquid transformed into a flawless jade seal, no bigger than a baby’s fist.  Alternating blue and white light flickered within, emitting a rich luminescence that formed concentric halos.</p><p>The white light, cloud-like and misty, conjured countless illusions. The blue light morphed into various fox shapes, frolicking amidst the clouds, a scene of ethereal beauty.</p><p>This wasn’t mere radiance, but the external manifestation of the seal's power, locking onto Qin Sang with terrifying pressure!</p><p>Qin Sang felt his chest tighten, his body stiffen, his blood congeal, as if crushed beneath a mountain. His vision narrowed to only the blue and white light.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Qinghu Saint King’s laughter reached Qin Sang’s ears, a melodious chime that captivated the soul.</p><p>"Quite the treasure trove you carry…"</p><p>The voice and the jade seal descended together.</p><p>The three illusory forms grew increasingly translucent.</p><p>Clearly, this was their all-out attack.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The jade seal struck with devastating force!</p><p>A jade seal instantly appeared on the barrier’s surface, embedding itself deeply.  The blue and white light spread like a tide, seemingly suppressing the blazing demonic flames.</p><p>The scene resembled a boulder plunging into a lake.  Centered on the jade seal, the demonic flames surged in waves, accompanied by groaning sounds from the barrier. In moments, the area directly impacted was reduced to a thin membrane.</p><p>Having integrated the fire lotus into the Mani Pearl, its defensive capabilities were unparalleled.  Few cultivators could breach the barrier.</p><p>Yet, sensing imminent destruction, Qin Sang was terrified. He hastily focused his mind on the Mani Pearl, connecting to the source of the demonic fire.</p><p>He channeled as much of the controllable demonic fire as possible into the barrier. While he couldn't fully control it, using the Mani Pearl to guide the flow allowed him to strengthen the barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the Saint King’s illusory forms were not external avatars, but manifestations of divine power, unsustainable.  If he survived this attack, he had a chance to escape.</p><p>He considered using the Solar God Tree, but there was no opportunity.  The Qinghu Saint King was undoubtedly prepared, making it too risky.</p><p>The demonic fire, upon release, proved extraordinary.  A surge of deep black ink spread within the barrier, reinforcing it and countering the jade seal.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s true energy was draining at an alarming rate.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The peak of Emperor Bestowal Mountain was tilting, threatening to break in two.</p><p>The mountaintop was almost swallowed by the five-colored clouds, which were now intricately interwoven, creating a bizarrely beautiful scene as the five elemental prohibitions neared their destruction.</p><p>Even so, the shockwaves from the clash between the jade seal and the barrier were undeniable.</p><p>The fissure in the clouds remained open, revealing three fleeting figures. Based on the internal tremors, it seemed they hadn’t subdued their target.</p><p>The onlookers were stunned.</p><p>The person was clearly heavily injured, blood staining their robes, their true energy chaotic.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator, with three powerful illusory forms attacking, and yet the person still fought back?</p><p>Self-proclaimed experts, well-traveled and widely connected, racked their brains, unable to recall the person’s origins.  They searched through the top sects, finding no record of them.</p><p>Who was this mysterious figure?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the illusory forms grew more ethereal, like shadows. Qin Sang felt the familiar emptiness, though less intense this time.</p><p>Pale-faced, he stared at the three forms, his gaze flickering.  Mind and avatar merging, he was about to act.</p><p>One of the Qinghu Saint King’s illusory forms blinked.</p><p>In an instant, her expression changed dramatically.  The white eyes became normal, beautiful and sparkling, like two pools of deep water, brimming with charm, captivating anyone who looked into them.</p><p>Apart from the eyes, the illusion's face remained unchanged, yet those captivating eyes made her seem like a completely different person.</p><p>The illusion seemed to see his weakened state through the protective barrier, a slight smile curving her lips, a beautiful and breathtaking sight.</p><p>Qin Sang heard a faint laugh again.</p><p>It was still a silver bell-like laugh, but this time much closer, right beside his ear.</p><p>In the sky.</p><p>Ever since the Qinghu Saint King attacked Qin Sang, Fan Laomo and the others hesitated to speak.</p><p>They had all heard rumors of the demon riot at the Liuzhou Hall, each with their own thoughts, but none dared to help Qin Sang.  They were more concerned that if the Qinghu Saint King was distracted, the ancient demon would seize the opportunity and ruin their efforts.</p><p>However, the Qinghu Saint King only used three illusions, her real body remaining unmoved, her judgment and reaction as precise as before.</p><p>While Qin Sang was fending off the three illusions, the battle here hadn't paused for a moment.</p><p>They surrounded the Qinghu Saint King, their formations shifting and reforming, yet never breaking.</p><p>"Scatter!"</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's shout rang out.</p><p>After working together for some time, Fan Laomo and the others understood the command.  The demon's power was about to unleash, and they couldn't withstand it directly, so they had to retreat.  Without hesitation, they scattered.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Countless demon claws spread out, covering the sky.</p><p>Explosions echoed from Fan Laomo and the others as they were hit by claws despite their timely evasive maneuvers. They used various defensive treasures to resist.</p><p>Before the claws dissipated, the command came again: "Combine!"</p><p>This was the signal for a combined counterattack. Though battered, they weren't without a chance.  While the demon's power was spent, they would attack, hoping to disrupt its formation and buy some precious time.</p><p>However, such opportunities were few and far between.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's orders were unquestionable.  Without time to think, they summoned their treasures, their formation shifting to a combined attack.</p><p>In an instant, beams of light shot out from everyone, merging into a single beam in the center of the lake above, striking directly at the demon.</p><p>At the same time, the moon suddenly brightened, its light pouring down like a waterfall, instantly merging with the beam, creating an unprecedented spectacle that even surprised Fan Laomo and the others.</p><p>Nobody noticed.</p><p>At that moment, the Qinghu Saint King's body stiffened imperceptibly.</p><p>In the mountains.</p><p>The illusion whose demeanor had changed took a step forward.</p><p>Qin Sang heard the laughter growing louder, seemingly piercing his eardrums, invading his Purple Mansion, resonating in his spirit. He also seemed to smell a faint fragrance.</p><p>"It's some kind of illusion technique…"</p><p>These words immediately came to his mind.</p><p>This was the Celestial Fox Charm Technique.  Ordinary people, once afflicted, would be consumed by desire, beset by illusions created by the charm.  Those with weaker willpower would immediately fall into a sea of desire, becoming living corpses.</p><p>Even those with strong willpower would be affected, their minds unsettled.</p><p>Cast by a Nascent Soul stage cultivator like the Qinghu Saint King, few in the world could withstand it!</p><p>Unfortunately, the ancient demon's mind was chaotic, rendering the charm useless.</p><p>Clearly, the three illusions were merely a probe, to force Qin Sang to use his powerful spiritual fire and then exploit the opening. Even without forcing out the fire, they could weaken him further.</p><p>Even when hunting a rabbit, a lion uses all its strength.  The Qinghu Saint King, her true body restrained by the ancient demon, could still plan this far ahead!</p><p>Now, Qin Sang was weakened. The appearance of the illusion, even for a moment, was enough.</p><p>The true killing blow was coming!</p><p>However, the Qinghu Saint King couldn't have imagined that someone would be completely immune to her charm.</p><p>As this thought flashed through her mind, Qin Sang's body suddenly stiffened, his eyes glazed over, the protective barrier weakening, as if about to dissipate.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's smile deepened, she extended her jade hand, spiritual light erupting, forming a phantom fox claw that tore through the air towards Qin Sang.  The claw's passage caused the void to tremble, its power surpassing even her jade seal.</p><p>Success was at hand.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's smile suddenly faded, her brow furrowed, a strange unease washing over her.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's eyes regained their clarity, his expression fierce.</p><p>A roar echoed from within his body.  Earlier, only minor meridians were broken; now, even the main ones were torn.  He had obtained another Boiling Snow Pill from his avatar, held it in his mouth just in case, and now swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>One Boiling Snow Pill alone would be an unbearable burden, but taking two consecutively caused Qin Sang's body to spasm, his flesh tearing.</p><p>Brilliant crimson flames erupted like a rising sun, illuminating the mountain range of the ancient manor.</p><p>This time, the cultivators could finally witness the sight of six birds soaring together.</p>
