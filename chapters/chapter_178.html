<h1>**Chapter 171: Corpse Yin Incantation**</h1><p>**Chapter 171: Corpse Yin Incantation**</p><p>Wu Yuesheng’s ‘corpse’ moved slightly and silently raised its head. Blood remained on his face, and his skin was deathly pale due to blood loss. However, he was not weak. Apparently, his injuries were not as severe as they looked.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng revealed a smug smile when he saw that Qin Sang remained on the ground, seemingly unaware that he was about to die.</p><p>However, his expression hardened when his gaze shifted from Qin Sang to the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>“Such a powerful flag formation…”</p><p>Wu Yuesheng muttered, his eyes burning. He was about to rise when an enormous force suddenly slammed him into the ground. He felt searing pain in his back and chest.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng looked down in astonishment and saw a vibrant green spirit sword pierce his heart and sink into the ground.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Wu Yuesheng suddenly understood what had happened. He did not need to see it; he knew his attack had failed. He laughed mockingly, and the light in his eyes faded as his life force waned.</p><p>The Crimson Yan Sword stabbed into the void and lost power because there was no one controlling it. It clattered against the wall, and the red light on its body slowly dimmed, seemingly mourning its master.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Blackwood Sword moved again, piercing Wu Yuesheng’s head. Qin Sang’s figure slowly appeared beside Wu Yuesheng, his breath ragged.</p><p>In such a short time, he had dealt with two treacherous companions, controlled several magic tools in succession, and could not reveal any weaknesses. Even though his divine sense was relatively strong and he managed it well, it was still a lot for him to handle.</p><p>Qin Sang could not be sure if Wu Yuesheng was dead, but he had witnessed Wu Yuesheng’s ability to conceal his aura. It was not difficult for him to pretend to be a corpse. Additionally, Qin Sang had been wary of Wu Yuesheng ever since he had been tracked by him, and he did not trust him at all. Therefore, he had taken precautions and never revealed the Blackwood Sword.</p><p>He even suspected that Wu Yuesheng’s injuries were not serious and that he might have intentionally pretended to fall for the trap. Wu Yuesheng’s careful actions when he had been tracking him were still fresh in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang did not test Wu Yuesheng.</p><p>If Wu Yuesheng was faking, he must have had evil intentions because he did not wake up after Qin Sang killed the White Cloud Mountain Man. If Qin Sang tested him rashly, he would have to confront Wu Yuesheng directly.</p><p>Qin Sang’s foundation was damaged, and his cultivation was inferior to Wu Yuesheng’s. Even if he could defeat him with his magic tools, it would take some time, and the two of them would be devoured by the baleful qi. Unless he used the Profound Yin Thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Soul-Devouring Cone to kill the White Cloud Mountain Man. The Profound Yin Thunder was his only trump card. They had not yet reached the core of the Corpse Sect’s branch, and there were already such strong evil corpses. There was no telling what they would encounter later, and he had to consider his next move.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to use himself as bait.</p><p>He used the Soul-Devouring Cone to kill the White Cloud Mountain Man, hoping to end the battle quickly and prevent Wu Yuesheng from taking advantage. Then, he pretended to be anxious and used the癸水阴雷咒 with all his might, exposing his undefended back to Wu Yuesheng, which lured him into the trap.</p><p>Man and sword united, their movements obscured. This divine ability was perfect for sneak attacks and assassinations.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng was delighted by Qin Sang’s weakness. He focused on concealing the Crimson Yan Sword’s fluctuations and plotted to attack Qin Sang. However, he never would have guessed that an invisible spirit sword was approaching him like a venomous snake in the shadows, ready to deliver a fatal bite.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of relief when he confirmed that Wu Yuesheng was dead, but he was also exhausted. He sighed softly.</p><p>He swallowed a spirit-restoring pill, controlled the Blackwood Sword to fight the evil corpses, and quickly entered the palace where the skeleton was.</p><p>The White Cloud Mountain Man had scattered the items, so after Qin Sang checked the skeleton, he found nothing unusual. He picked up the three items.</p><p>To his surprise, both the black cloth bag and the cracked iron stake were magic tools but did not have any remarkable features. The cracked iron stake, in particular, had not been originally damaged. These cracks had been caused by external force.</p><p>The iron stake seemed unusual, but the cracks were too severe. Qin Sang did not dare to test it with too much spirit force for fear of destroying it.</p><p>That only left the silver token.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the token, but it did not react when he touched it with spirit force. He frowned, but then something occurred to him, and he quickly scanned it with his divine sense.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A section of writing emerged in Qin Sang’s mind!</p><p>This truly was similar to a jade slip, a repository for information.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced thoughtfully at Baiyun Shaman's body. Had he taken such risks merely for the sake of this text? Since it had been sealed within  the Heavenly Corpse Token, could it be the inheritance of the Heavenly Corpse Sect?</p><p>The Corpse Fiend was being torn apart by the Ten Directions Yama Formation and the Ebony Wood Sword, unable to make much of a fight. It was only a matter of time before it would be eliminated.</p><p>Qin Sang had a hunch that what lay within the Heavenly Corpse Token might very well be related to corpse refinement. It might even contain a way to deal with the Corpse Fiend with ease. He began browsing through it carefully.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from the Heavenly Corpse Token, his expression somewhat strange.</p><p>The Token didn't contain any cultivation methods, but instead the inheritance of the Heavenly Corpse Sect's Corpse Refining techniques. It was called the ‘Heavenly Corpse Scripture,’ and it included complete techniques for refining Zombie Corpse Puppets and Corpse Fiend Corpse Puppets.</p><p>Zombie Corpse Puppets didn't differ much from other corpse refining techniques that Qin Sang had heard of before. They primarily relied on Yin and baleful energy, but the Heavenly Corpse Sect's Corpse refining art could draw on a trace of Earth Baleful Qi to temper the Corpse Puppet's flesh. As a result, the Zombie Corpse Puppets refined with these techniques would be somewhat stronger than ordinary Zombies.</p><p>The techniques for refining Corpse Fiend Corpse Puppets, however, were completely different. It was refined using Earth Baleful Qi alone, and it required the corpse of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. The process was also very complicated.</p><p>In addition to all that, the ‘Heavenly Corpse Scripture’ contained a technique for refining Living Corpse Puppets!</p><p>His face turned pale upon reading the technique for refining Living Corpses. He felt a chill run down his spine and sucked in a cold breath.</p><p>Living Corpses were made by using a secret technique called the Heavenly Corpse Sigil to forcibly refine the Nascent Soul of a living Foundation Establishment cultivator, turning them into a ‘living’ Corpse Puppet.</p><p>After a cultivator was turned into a living Corpse Puppet, their intelligence would far surpass other Corpse Fiends. Not only would they be extremely obedient, but they would also be much stronger and almost as strong as they had been in life. Furthermore, they could cast magic spells and were practically perfect puppets.</p><p>Could it be that this Corpse Fiend had been refined into a Living Corpse?</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and silently observed the Corpse Fiend within the Ten Directions Yama Formation, a sense of understanding washing over him. It was no wonder that it was so intelligent and could use the ‘Mystical Yellow Armor’ and that secret遁术.</p><p>And that wasn't all that the ‘Heavenly Corpse Scripture’ contained.</p><p>The general outline described techniques for refining Corpse Puppets that were even stronger than Corpse Fiends. It even contained a secret technique that could power up Living Corpses to give them strength comparable to that of Flying Night Rakshasas.</p><p>Unfortunately, this Heavenly Corpse Token did not record this technique.</p>
