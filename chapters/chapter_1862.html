<h1>Chapter 1853: Traces of the Spirit Tree</h1><p>Illusion or Reality?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a moment of disorientation.  Along the way, he’d burst over twenty bubbles, many more shattered by the waves of light.  All signs pointed to the scenes within the bubbles being illusions, not real.  Yet, he’d managed to retrieve a red tile from one of them.</p><p>Holding it up, he examined it closely, confirming its reality.  Cool to the touch, its surface gleamed, seemingly still bearing traces of dew.  The tile appeared forged from a special type of spirit rock, capable of bearing inscribed restriction runes.  Whether because it was outside the bubble, or because the restrictions of the Octagon Pavilion had been eroded by time, the runes had lost all power; their origin was indistinguishable.</p><p>This indicated that the Octagon Pavilion was the work of a cultivator; these were no mere illusions.</p><p>“Are the bubbles passages to some sort of hidden paradise, or fragments of a shattered paradise, existing in a strange state between reality and illusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained puzzled but not discouraged; he was used to it.  Over the years at the Altar, he’d witnessed many things defying rational explanation.  The reason? His cultivation was insufficient, his perspective too limited.</p><p>Putting away the tile, Qin Sang continued his descent.  Soon, he saw another bubble, approached it, and reached out.  His hand passed through without resistance.  As before, the bubble burst, the scene vanished, his hand empty.</p><p>He didn’t give up, continuing until the fourth bubble, from which he finally retrieved something.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, at the giant stone in his palm, speechless.  Nearly a hundred meters tall, shaped like a goose egg, the stone itself was unremarkable – just an ordinary rock. The scene inside the bubble had been a cliff face, with this stone perched precariously near the edge, about to fall. He'd seen a cave in the cliff face, clearly a hermit's abode, and intended to retrieve something from within.  It turned out what one could retrieve – treasure or ordinary object – was purely a matter of luck.</p><p>He released his True Qi, reducing the stone to dust.</p><p>Based on his experiences, Qin Sang judged that the Diamond Bodhi tree likely grew within one of these bubbles, but even if he found the right bubble, he wasn't guaranteed to retrieve the tree itself.</p><p>“Since this chaos was caused by the appearance of the Diamond Bodhi tree, this tree should be different…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, continuing to cut through the waves. From then on, he probed every nearby bubble, retrieving a bizarre assortment of items, none of much value.</p><p>Gradually, he noticed a pattern. The deeper into the valley he went, the higher the chance of retrieving something. The process of the bubbles leaving the valley seemed to be a transition from reality to illusion, until they completely vanished.</p><p>A later discovery confirmed this pattern.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>When Qin Sang reached for a bubble, a faint blue light suddenly appeared on its surface, blocking his finger.  His eyes flickered; he examined the bubble closely. Inside, there was a clearly man-made platform, surrounded by four bare stone pillars of unknown purpose.</p><p>He applied slight pressure. With a ‘pop,’ the blue light dissipated, and the bubble shattered.  Instantly, the platform and pillars appeared before Qin Sang.  The four pillars were intact, a thousand meters high, exuding an aura of age and decay.</p><p>Slightly surprised, Qin Sang hesitated, then watched as a wave of light struck, reducing the platform and pillars to dust.  It was after discovering these pillars that Qin Sang felt he'd crossed the boundary between reality and illusion.</p><p>Further down, he encountered bubbles with residual blue light at regular intervals. Protected by the blue light, the scenes within hadn't begun their transformation into illusion; they were real.  Qin Sang suspected the blue light was a special type of restrictive power.</p><p>As more bubbles burst, revealing real objects, Qin Sang felt like he was traveling through a shattered world, though he hadn't yet found the ancient cultivator's abode. This wasn't important. Here, Qin Sang sensed the presence of wandering wood spirit energy!</p><p>It was a faint trace, but it invigorated him. He immediately followed the energy.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang found its source.  It was another bubble. Inside, lush greenery filled his vision; he could only see thick tree crowns and dense foliage, perhaps dozens of ancient trees.</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively reached out, his worries completely gone. The blue light barrier protected the bubbles from dissipating, but it didn't completely isolate the inside and outside; some wood spirit energy still seeped out.</p><p>It was also possible that the blue light barrier itself had developed flaws due to the tremors in the light sea. However, Qin Sang didn't fully understand the barrier, so he couldn't identify the flaws.</p><p>This was undoubtedly good news. Qin Sang exerted all his effort to activate his Wood Spirit Body, sensing the wood spirit energy in the valley.</p><p>While all wood spirit energy was similar, different plants emitted slightly different auras. Superior spirit wood had a purer, richer aura. The Wood Spirit Body possessed a keen perception capable of discerning these subtle differences, providing a way to find the Vajra Bodhi tree.</p><p>Wood Spirit Body, Celestial Eye Divine Ability.</p><p>Except for having fewer people than the likes of King Lingyou, Qin Sang’s methods were no worse, perhaps even better. What followed was a silent struggle.</p><p>As they continued to descend, the bubbles gradually became denser.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang encountered bubbles that seemed to contain hidden secrets. He would break them open, hoping to find something.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang stopped doing this frequently. The blue light barrier on the bubbles' surfaces became increasingly stronger, making it impossible to casually break them.</p><p>He kept his goal in mind. Even if these bubbles contained treasures, missing the Vajra Bodhi fruit would be a grave mistake.</p><p>After some time, the wood spirit energy in the void visibly increased, surging from all directions, swept by the light waves and constantly spreading.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the purest and richest stream of wood spirit energy he sensed, moving constantly.</p><p>After a search, he had a considerable harvest; several spirit herbs were added to his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The time the altar existed was also the time for the herbs to grow; it couldn’t be measured in years and months. The herbs were fully mature, their medicinal properties at their peak; they were simply unpicked, hidden treasures gathering dust.</p><p>Unfortunately, he still hadn't found the Vajra Bodhi tree.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's expression shifted. The faint green light on his body suddenly brightened.</p><p>The green light enveloped a large area, then locked onto a direction. After a slight sense, he was overjoyed.</p><p>He sensed a new wood spirit energy, far purer and richer than those herbs. Even if it wasn't the Vajra Bodhi tree, it would be extremely precious.</p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately changed direction, following the source of this wood spirit energy.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>In a certain part of the valley.</p><p>Lord Dingxiang and another demon lord in white armor were looking at a bubble before them, their faces filled with joy.</p><p>Inside the bubble, a golden light shone dazzlingly, and within the light stood a spirit tree.</p><p>Due to the angle, they could only see the crown, but it was enough.</p><p>Among the leaves of the crown was a spirit fruit – the Vajra Bodhi fruit!</p><p>"We found it first!"</p><p>The demon lord in white armor rubbed his palms, his face filled with excitement, his eyes glued to the Vajra Bodhi fruit.</p><p>After entering the valley, seeing its vastness and constant tremors, and with competitors nearby, to find the Vajra Bodhi tree quickly, they decided to split up.</p><p>King Lingyou went alone.</p><p>To guard against Qin Sang, Lord Dingxiang and the demon lord in white armor stayed together. The other three demon lords traveled together for mutual support.</p><p>Dividing their forces proved highly efficient.</p><p>"My lord, how do you… "</p><p>The demon lord in white armor looked at Lord Dingxiang, a hint of greed in his eyes. No one knew how many Vajra Bodhi fruits a single tree could bear.</p><p>They could break the blue light barrier on the bubble's surface, secretly keep a small portion, and present the majority to King Lingyou. It was entirely feasible.</p><p>He only got halfway through his sentence before Lord Dingxiang interrupted with a cold humph.  "Yuan, be careful! Don’t let the treasure cloud your judgment. We found the divine tree first; the King will surely reward us handsomely. There’s no need for such actions. Quickly report to the King and break the barrier; time is of the essence!”</p><p>The valley was constantly shaking, and the spiritual energy was chaotic. Their communication talismans and abilities were greatly restricted, preventing direct contact with King Lingyou.</p><p>"Yes, yes…"</p><p>Yuan hurriedly nodded, not daring to mention it again. He and Lord Dingxiang enveloped the bubble with their blood energy and flew towards King Lingyou’s location.</p><p>They had tested it; the blue light barrier on this bubble’s surface was very strong and difficult to break in a short time.</p><p>Breaking this barrier would undoubtedly cause a great commotion, and a mysterious expert was still somewhere nearby. Naturally, they had to be cautious.</p><p>Unfortunately, these bubbles couldn't be put into storage devices, otherwise it wouldn't be so troublesome.</p><p>Lord Dingxiang partially focused on vigilance, while Yuan focused on the bubble.</p><p>"Be careful," Lord Dingxiang reminded.</p><p>The shimmering bubbles weren't consistent; in the same area, some were fading, others solid.  Their previous experience couldn't predict where the next bubble would dissipate; other factors were clearly at play, not just location.</p><p>Therefore, they didn't dare to rush towards the valley exit with the bubbles.  They feared crossing some threshold, causing the blue light barrier to suddenly vanish, leaving them unprepared and unable to prevent the  solid energy from becoming nothingness—a deeply regrettable outcome.  After all, they knew too little about this blue light barrier.</p><p>As they flew, Dingxiang Hou suddenly frowned, sensing something, and sharply turned.  Deep blue light surged like ocean waves, the crests brightest, forming lines of blue that outlined the wave’s form.  Wave after wave crashed in, the bubbles within like fish in the sea, strikingly beautiful.</p><p>But amidst these light waves, a sharp bolt of lightning pierced the scene, its edge evident, heading directly for them.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Dingxiang Hou recognized Qin Sang's lightning escape technique instantly, remembering it well, and felt a surge of dread.  The other party seemed to know about the spiritual tree they'd found, pursuing them with terrifying speed—even seeing it again, Dingxiang Hou was still shocked.</p><p>"What do we do?"</p><p>Yuan Hou was equally terrified; witnessing this lightning escape firsthand confirmed Ping Hou's description hadn't been exaggerated at all. This person, who could subdue Ping Hou and Gui Hou before the Prince, was someone Yuan Hou knew he couldn't defeat. Even with Dingxiang Hou, he felt uneasy.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou knew they couldn't outrun him. Stopping, his expression shifting, he made a swift decision.  "Yuan Hou, quickly go and summon the Prince. I'll hold him off!"</p><p>Yuan Hou was even more alarmed. Did Dingxiang Hou lack confidence in defeating this person even with two against one?</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's thinking went deeper. The other's escape technique was extraordinary; they’d have difficulty injuring him, while he could engage in hit-and-run tactics, looking for their weaknesses and seizing opportunities.  If they were attacked individually, with Yuan Hou falling first, Dingxiang Hou would be alone, unable to escape or inform the Lingyou Prince, leaving him in far greater danger.</p><p>The Lingyou Prince’s vigilance made Dingxiang Hou wary. However, he considered himself among the top demon lords in Guifang, and even if he couldn't win, he could hold his own for a time.</p><p>"Be careful, Daoist friend!"</p><p>Understanding the stakes, Yuan Hou obeyed, immediately transforming into his demon form, launching his escape technique, and fleeing at full speed.  He left the bubbles behind; otherwise, being targeted by this person would leave them with no chance of survival.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou lightly shook his robe, storing the bubbles within his sleeve, watching the approaching lightning escape.</p><p>The enemy seemed to guess Yuan Hou's intentions; the lightning escape veered, attempting to intercept him.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou coldly snorted, turning into white smoke, swiftly passing through dozens of light waves, positioning himself between the enemy and Yuan Hou.</p><p>"He's gone to summon the Lingyou Prince..."</p><p>Witnessing their actions, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  They were understaffed and had been beaten to the punch, but at least they had been guided and tracked their target.</p><p>Seeing Yuan Hou disappear, Qin Sang knew there was no chance of intercepting him.  He shifted his gaze to Dingxiang Hou, killing intent flashing in his eyes.  So be it; he’d seize the spiritual tree before the Lingyou Prince arrived!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Four gazes met across the light waves, both man and demon feeling a tremor of the spirit, their expressions grave.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Amidst the thunder, Qin Sang burst through the waves, his figure revealed in the lightning.  He looked at Dingxiang Hou's sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his lips, a strange smile appearing—to others it seemed more like a sinister grin.</p><p>"Daoist friend, are you trying to share the divine tree? I'm not greedy. Let's work together to break the bubbles.  Considering your need to offer tribute to the Demon King upon your return, I'll only take 30%, how does that sound?"</p><p>Dingxiang Hou appeared thoughtful, truly considering this suggestion, finally sighing regretfully.  "I dare not decide without the Prince.  Let's discuss it with you when he arrives.  If we can achieve peaceful resolution, it would be ideal."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected much, and dared not gamble on the Demon King's temperament. He sighed softly, and pointed, his sword light streaking towards Dingxiang Hou.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou was prepared. He said nothing about "first come, first served." Even if they were strangers, the age-old rule in the face of treasure remains: the virtuous shall possess it!  He already had conflict with them.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>His long beard fluttered in the wind; countless wisps of white energy wove into a net.  Dingxiang Hou summoned his elephant trunk, spraying two streams of white energy, combining with the net to create a sturdy barrier before him.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou’s eyes, peering through the net, watched the flying sword, his pupils contracting slightly.</p><p>"This sword truly is extraordinary! No wonder its power made Ping Hou so flustered…"</p><p>This thought crossing his mind, Dingxiang Hou vanished into white smoke, retreating.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
