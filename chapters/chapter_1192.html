<h1>Chapter 1184:  Right into His Hands</h1><p>Chapter 1184:  Right into His Hands</p><p>Two Yuan Ying cultivators confronted each other.</p><p>Upon contact, they attacked mercilessly, aiming for each other’s death.</p><p>Having fought multiple times, they knew their opponents well.</p><p>Their cultivation levels were similar, and neither possessed an instantly lethal technique. In a one-on-one fight, defeating the opponent quickly was nearly impossible.</p><p>Unless something unexpected happened, the battle would simply replicate previous encounters:  a stalemate with neither side gaining a significant advantage, ending with both sides withdrawing disgruntled after an exhausting fight.</p><p>However, the battle between the two Yuan Ying cultivators wasn't without purpose.</p><p>Within their respective camps, they were the source of confidence for all the lower-level cultivators.</p><p>On the battlefield, they were the core, the focus of everyone's attention.</p><p>Their actions, even the smallest movements, influenced their side's morale and could even turn the tide of battle.  Therefore, even knowing they couldn't kill each other, they wouldn't hold back.</p><p>Tan Laomo shook his arm, releasing the fiery rope.  It shot off his arm, one end remaining in his grasp, the other rising like a fiery serpent, its tip pointed at Si Di.</p><p>It extended and retracted with extraordinary agility.</p><p>Only then could the true nature of the treasure be seen.</p><p>The rope was over a zhang long but extremely thin. Though composed of interlocking links, it looked more like a thread.</p><p>Its surface blazed with intense flames, radiating scorching heat.</p><p>Aiming at Si Di, the fiery rope sprung forward, a torrent of flames erupting. With a hiss, a massive fireball detached from the rope, hurtling towards its target with great force.</p><p>The fireball appeared somewhat illusory, but its power was real.  The surrounding snowflakes melted instantly, unaffected by the cold wind, the void dyed crimson.</p><p>Si Di was not to be outdone. He formed a hand seal, and the Yue Jin Jian abruptly stopped in front of him before spinning rapidly.</p><p>Only now was it clear that the golden lumps on the Yue Jin Jian were not merely decorative.</p><p>Beams of golden light shot out from the lumps, like the sword beams of a sword cultivator, incredibly sharp, piercing the fireball from all sides.</p><p>Flames raged, golden blossoms blooming within, transforming into thick golden pythons, savagely devouring the fire tongues within the fireball.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The fireball, spent, exploded, the golden blossoms and pythons vanishing with it.</p><p>It seemed a draw.</p><p>Si Di scoffed, "Tan, it seems you haven't improved much lately!"</p><p>"Likewise!  Likewise!"</p><p>Tan Laomo sneered, "Let's see how capable you really are now!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Tan Laomo suddenly threw the fiery rope, his hands crossing in front of his chest as he rapidly formed intricate hand seals aimed at the rope.</p><p>The rope twisted, instantly forming into the shape of a lotus flower.</p><p>The flames on the rope intensified, the entire treasure resembling a fiery lotus blooming in the void.</p><p>The fiery lotus drifted towards Si Di, seemingly slow but deceptively fast.</p><p>Simultaneously, the lotus's color changed from crimson to deep red, its heart emitting a faint blue glow, its temperature and aura rapidly increasing, inspiring fear.</p><p>Si Di's expression grew serious. Without hesitation, he tossed the Yue Jin Jian high into the air.</p><p>The Yue Jin Jian flipped over, its mirror surface facing the fiery lotus.  With a hum, a white beam of light shot from its center, faster than the lotus.</p><p>The white light was frigid, possessing a tangible quality like metal.</p><p>Wherever the beam passed, the fiery lotus's flames were instantly extinguished. Then, the beam plunged directly into the fiery lotus.</p><p>Instead of shattering it, the white light formed a white ring, firmly locking the fiery lotus within, sealing even its fiery power.</p><p>Any treasure or spell caught would be potentially locked by the Yue Jin Jian. A weaker opponent, caught off guard, might even lose their treasure to Si Di.</p><p>'Crackle…crackle…'</p><p>The ring contracted, compressing the fiery lotus, causing it to deform slightly.</p><p>However, Tan Laomo, intimately familiar with Si Di and the Yue Jin Jian, remained calm.  He calmly pointed a finger, causing the fiery lotus's power to contract before suddenly exploding!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The fiery lotus exploded, the violent flames instantly shattering the ring. The shockwave transformed into countless fire pythons that surged outwards. Amidst the chaos, the fiery rope sprung up, lashing towards Si Di.</p><p>The rope was extremely thin, concealed within the chaotic flames—a treacherous attack.</p><p>Si Di's face paled slightly, but as if anticipating this, he didn't hesitate, summoning the Yue Jin Jian. The Yue Jin Jian flew back, intercepting the fiery rope. At the same time, golden light flowed from the golden lumps, forming a golden membrane.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The moment the golden membrane formed, the fiery whip lashed out.</p><p>Yue Jinjian trembled, sending out ripples.  Two magical artifacts flew back to their owners; neither was harmed.</p><p>But others weren't so lucky.</p><p>Though they tried to avoid the clash of the Yuan Ying cultivators,  in the crowded battlefield, it was difficult to evade the attacks, and many were caught in the crossfire, their lives extinguished by the residual energy.</p><p>Si Di glanced down, extinguishing the lingering energy surging towards his side, then his gaze swept across the battlefield.  His figure flickered as he flew towards the outer edges.</p><p>Seeing Si Di's action, Tan Lao Mo understood he was seeking a different location to fight, to avoid unnecessary casualties. Their confrontation was affecting both sides.</p><p>However, a strange look flashed in Tan Lao Mo's eyes.</p><p>Si Di's chosen direction was precisely where Chan Ling was hiding!</p><p>Their plan was to wear Si Di down, allowing Pei Lao Mo to stabilize the situation with the Youjing Tower before luring Si Di towards Chan Ling for a combined assault.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Si Di was walking right into their trap.</p><p>"Nowhere to run! Since you seek your own demise, don't blame me!"</p><p>Tan Lao Mo sneered inwardly; Si Di's choice was perfectly played into their hands.</p><p>Without hesitation, he secretly sent a signal and pursued.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin, hidden in the shadows, had been waiting.  Seeing this, they knew the moment had arrived. They circled around to the rear, silently approaching the Youjing Tower.</p><p>"Get back here!"</p><p>Tan Lao Mo feigned an attack, wielding the fiery whip.</p><p>Simultaneously, he summoned another artifact—a small blue triangular flag.  The flag was intricately woven, appearing to ripple with waves.</p><p>The next moment, the triangular flag soared.</p><p>Streams of water flowed from its surface, instantly transforming the surrounding void into a watery expanse.</p><p>The two artifacts, one of fire and one of water, normally opposing forces, achieved a strange synergy—a harmonious blend of water and fire!</p><p>A fiery serpent writhed across the waves.</p><p>Waves crashed, each more ferocious than the last, bolstering the fiery whip, its power intensifying.</p><p>Si Di turned to face the oncoming attack, his body flying backward.  His expression remained calm; his lips moved silently as he cast an incantation.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Yue Jinjian suddenly soared high into the air, hanging motionless, radiating a brilliant light, like a golden sun. The golden light was as sharp as a sword, impossible to look directly at;  only a searing pain could be felt.</p><p>The fiery whip and the triangular flag were both enveloped in the golden light!</p>
