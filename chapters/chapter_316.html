<h1>Chapter 309 Comprehending the Path of Slaughter</h1><p>Yun Youzi received the Smoke Herb, examined it, then gathered his scarce remaining spiritual power. Using his palm as a furnace and his spiritual power as fire, he refined the herb.  The emerald green spiritual herb transformed into a drop of green liquid at a speed visible to the naked eye. A rich aroma immediately filled the entire cave.</p><p>Seeing Yun Youzi steadily refine the herb without any loss of potency in his weakened state, Qin Sang was secretly impressed. He decided to have Yun Youzi refine the Profound Vein Harmony Pill after he recovered, eliminating the need to involve a Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>When Qin Sang mentioned this to Shangguan Lifeng, the latter insisted his contribution was insignificant and refused to accept the spiritual herb. He only took two of Ge Yuan's magical artifacts, neither of which was particularly valuable.</p><p>Hesitantly, Shangguan Lifeng said, "Daoist, I have a small request. When we killed Luo Xingnan, I saw you use your spirit sword. The killing intent within the sword's energy was exceptionally pure, and combined with the formation, it even momentarily stunned Luo Xingnan. This killing intent is unique, unlike anything I've ever encountered. I wonder if you could offer me some guidance?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by Shangguan Lifeng's unexpected request.  Shangguan Lifeng's observation was accurate.  Luo Xingnan's nascent soul had been injured by the Soul-Burning Threads, throwing his divine sense into chaos. Coupled with the killing intent unleashed by the Slaughter Talisman, Luo Xingnan had indeed been momentarily stunned.  They had seized that precise opportunity to kill him.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was interested in the killing intent of the Slaughter Talisman. Could it be that his path was also the Path of Slaughter?  Qin Sang recalled his first encounter with Shangguan Lifeng in West Desert Town. Shangguan Lifeng had struck him as a skilled bladesman, both the man and his blade radiating a sharp edge.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's inquiry, Shangguan Lifeng didn't hide anything. He frankly stated, "After my master was murdered, I was consumed by hatred and killing intent.  Unexpectedly, this misfortune turned into a blessing. It allowed me to sense an opportunity to break through the Foundation Establishment bottleneck. I’ve continued down this path ever since, collecting numerous related scriptures and cultivation methods, integrating killing intent into my blade techniques with some success. I've decided to dedicate myself to this path. The killing intent within your sword energy is the purest I've ever witnessed. If you could offer me some guidance, it would be more valuable than a thousand-year-old spiritual herb. I'm willing to offer you the Spirit Jade Tree as well."</p><p>So that was it. Qin Sang slowly shook his head.  He didn't want Shangguan Lifeng's Spirit Jade Tree.  With a slightly embarrassed expression, he said, "To be honest, Fellow Daoist Shangguan, my talent is mediocre. The killing intent you perceived in my sword energy is inherent to the cultivation method itself. Although I've cultivated diligently, I've only grasped the surface. I'm afraid I can't offer any meaningful insights."</p><p>The killing intent came from the Slaughter Talisman of the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter. Qin Sang wasn't lying. Although he treated the cultivation method as a tool to increase his cultivation, he had indeed studied it diligently. Whether due to limited talent or his chosen path, he hadn't gained much personal insight, remaining within the confines of the cultivation method.</p><p>Qin Sang's original ambition to comprehend the incomplete latter half of the Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter after reaching Core Formation had been ruthlessly shattered by reality.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng lowered his head in disappointment.</p><p>"However..." Qin Sang's tone shifted. "If you trust me, Fellow Daoist, there might be another way."</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng abruptly looked up, his eyes brightening, his voice urgent, "Please tell me, Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated slightly, "I can activate my sword energy and let you experience the killing intent yourself. However, it requires you to touch the sword energy with your divine sense and focus completely. By doing so..."</p><p>By doing so, Shangguan Lifeng would be completely defenseless against Qin Sang. If Qin Sang had any malicious intent, he could easily take Shangguan Lifeng's life.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shangguan Lifeng agreed without hesitation, "Thank you, Daoist, for granting me this opportunity!"</p><p>"Have you considered the risks?" Qin Sang asked again with a serious expression, receiving Shangguan Lifeng's confirmation.</p><p>The two stood up, facing each other, about ten feet apart.  Shangguan Lifeng laid down his saber, withdrawing all his spiritual power into his sea of Qi, standing there defenselessly. He extended his divine sense, softly saying, "Daoist, please begin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. With a flash from his brow, the Ebony Sword flew out, reaching Shangguan Lifeng in the blink of an eye. The Slaughter Talisman on the sword was abruptly activated, releasing boundless killing intent.</p><p>Allowing Shangguan Lifeng to comprehend the killing intent released by the Slaughter Talisman was a simple task for Qin Sang, incurring no loss to himself.</p><p>The sword energy contacted Shangguan Lifeng's divine sense. Under Qin Sang's control, the sword energy didn't harm him. However, directly contacting the Slaughter Talisman with one's divine sense was a dangerous act. Shangguan Lifeng's face immediately paled, sweat dripping down his face, but he gritted his teeth and persisted.</p><p>Seeing Shangguan Lifeng nearing his limit, Qin Sang withdrew the Ebony Sword. Continuing further could inflict irreversible damage.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng bowed his hands and immediately sat down cross-legged to meditate. After recovering, he repeated the process several times.</p><p>By the time Shangguan Lifeng finished his comprehension, Yun Youzi had swallowed and partially refined the Smoke Herb's liquid, awakening from his meditative state.  The thousand-year-old spiritual herb was indeed extraordinary. In this short time, Yun Youzi's complexion had improved considerably, and his sea of Qi had partially recovered, at least enough for him to travel alone.</p><p>"I've refined about thirty percent of the medicinal power. The effect is even better than I anticipated. The medicinal power of a thousand-year-old spiritual herb is potent. There's no rush. The remaining power can be refined later. This place isn't safe. We should return to a secure location quickly," Yun Youzi said, exhaling deeply and standing up.</p><p>The three made a wide detour, avoiding West Desert Town, and returned to the outer region.  Shangguan Lifeng bid them farewell, deciding to return to his cave to cultivate.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi watched him depart.</p><p>"This young man possesses good talent, and what's more valuable is his excellent character. He's grateful and repays kindness. If you kept him, Qin Laodi, he would be a valuable asset," Yun Youzi said softly.</p><p>Qin Sang offered no comment.  Some matters are best kept secret. He had too many secrets.  He had only revealed the Ten Yama Ensigns to Shangguan Lifeng because he was using the false identity of Daoist Qing Feng. It was better for them to part ways and forget each other.</p><p>"Let's go, Senior," Qin Sang turned and left, walking alongside Yun Youzi, treading the vast desert sands, returning to Skull Gorge.</p><p>The Taiyi Pill Sect had its own caves. Yun Youzi chose one not far from Qin Sang's. He would begin refining the Profound Vein Harmony Pill once he fully recovered.  In the meantime, Yun Youzi instructed the Taiyi Pill Sect's steward to gather the supplementary herbs. These herbs were much less valuable than the main ingredient and easy to find. Qin Sang only needed to pay spirit stones and wouldn't need to worry about it.</p><p>Their遁光 landed in front of Qin Sang's cave. He checked the restrictions, confirming they were untouched, and pushed the door open.</p>
