<h1>On the way back home, more to come tomorrow.</h1><p>A soul contract, a binding agreement of souls, unbreakable unless released by the contracting party.  Even with unimaginable power, it cannot be undone.  Even the Immortal Emperor Xiao Huangji, once merely a God King, couldn't break it despite his status as an Emperor.  To prevent betrayal and backlash, the Masters Continent established that even if one were to transcend the Celestial Book, the soul contract would remain unbreakable.</p><p>“A soul contract cannot be severed from the sea of consciousness, but I’ve integrated a unique energy capable of dissolving even celestial laws.  Breaking it is not difficult…with sufficient power, a concentrated assault on the contract will suffice!”  the ruthless cultivator declared.</p><p>Soul contracts are based on the laws of Heaven.  This special energy can dissolve even the Heavenly Laws of the God Realm.  Dissolving a soul contract, with the proper approach, is therefore hardly a challenge.</p><p>“I see…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>“Consider this my gratitude for bringing me to the God Realm!”</p><p>Having explained, the ruthless cultivator said no more.  Their aura grew increasingly ancient and profound; the black hole behind them expanded, clearly absorbing more power, strengthening themselves.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he becomes…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, noticing the anomaly, urgently transmitted a message.</p><p>“Prepare for battle!” With his doubts dispelled, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raising his sword.  “Then let’s settle this with our blades!”</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The most powerful sword intent unleashed once more.</p><p>To live again, to return; to die, to yearn eternally.</p><p>Life and death hold no fear; what obstacle can remain?</p><p>Though not at the level of an Emperor's understanding, this sword technique contained all his resolve, pushing the Tian Ruo Youqing technique to its limits.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>With one strike, he bisected the ruthless cultivator’s attack.</p><p>Simultaneously, Luo Ruoxi attacked, her movements as graceful as falling snow.  Her swordsmanship resembled that of the young man from Sword God Heaven, possessing an indomitable spirit and the effortless elegance of the Dao.</p><p>“Impressive techniques, but still lacking compared to mine…”</p><p>With a light smile, the ruthless cultivator lunged again.</p><p>In an instant, the attack blotted out the sun and moon, engulfing heaven and earth. Space shattered, and stars seemed to fall from the sky.</p><p>*Pfft!* *Pfft!*</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were flung back, blood spraying from their mouths.</p><p>Even with their power, they couldn't withstand the attack!</p><p>What level of cultivation had this person reached?</p><p>“Audacious!”  The avatar stepped forward, each step blooming a lotus flower, the sound of flowing water echoing through the void.</p><p>From afar, it looked incredibly imposing.</p><p>Having refined the Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no less than Zhang Xuan's.</p><p>He unleashed a punch, its force soaring to the heavens.</p><p>Colliding with the ruthless cultivator, he too was sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan clutched his forehead.</p><p>Even as an Emperor, his avatar still couldn't resist showing off…</p><p>Such flamboyant displays were less effective than concentrating his power for a more devastating attack!</p><p>“Attack together, or we all die!”</p><p>Xiao Huangji roared, his crimson flames burning, igniting the very sky.</p><p>The remaining six Emperors unleashed their respective abilities.</p><p>Seven Emperors united, their power capable of destroying the world.  Even the heavens couldn’t withstand their combined attack.  But their opponent, fueled by that extraordinary energy, simply allowed the black hole to expand, swallowing the attack in the blink of an eye, before launching a counterattack.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Emperors combined, yet they couldn’t even withstand a single blow!</p><p>How could this person be so powerful?</p><p>“You may all die now…”</p><p>Having defeated them all with a single attack, the ruthless cultivator stepped forward, hand raised to strike again.</p><p>“You dare, you vermin!”</p><p>With a roar, the elder from Sword God Heaven appeared, blocking the attack with his long sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Emperor? He’s also an Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.</p><p>This elder, previously seen as a mere follower of the young man, at most a titled God King, now revealed himself to be an Emperor-level expert!</p><p>If he was an Emperor, what was the young man?</p><p>“He is an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…”  Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth, struggling to stand.</p><p>“Then…the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan could no longer contain himself.</p><p>“He is…” Luo Ruoxi started to answer, but space twisted, revealing the Sword God Heaven Emperor sent flying, crashing into a huge crater.</p><p>Even Zhang Xuan, with his superior power and swordsmanship, could not stand against him.  The elder, despite his considerable cultivation and skill, was no match.</p><p>"Haha! Your Majesty, they're nothing but a pack of weaklings! Today, I will destroy the Nine Heavens, destroy this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The Emperor of Jian Shen Tian was defeated, and the ruthless one laughed wildly. The surrounding space continuously collapsed, making him seem demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their full power, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her strongest technique, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow…</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm can stop him?</p><p>Are we just going to let him destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return the flawed Heavenly Dao fragment to its whole, allowing the Heavenly Dao to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its whole?" Zhang Xuan understood her meaning.</p><p>The library in his mind is part of the Heavenly Dao. Once it returns, the Heavenly Dao will be complete, perhaps fixing the flaw and expelling the ruthless one.</p><p>It's like a human immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a broken one cannot resist viral invasion, and even the strongest person will die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful. Even if the Heavenly Dao is restored, it won't be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… what about a tiger?</p><p>Even the strongest immune system is helpless against that.</p><p>This person is just an ordinary God King, even a titled one.  The Heavenly Dao could easily kill them, yet he is stronger than the Emperor… beyond the Heavenly Dao's control.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of despair on her fair face. "Yes… we can't suppress him, but with the Heavenly Dao whole, he can awaken, and killing this one will be easy!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, he's in Zi Zai Tian…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth, turning and flying forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The ruthless one sneered, striking downwards.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent brilliant.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again.</p><p>"You go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find a way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, standing in front. Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jing Kong Pearl form.</p><p>The surrounding space solidified.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone selflessly standing behind him, fearless of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened. But he knew this wasn't the time to talk, he pulled Luo Ruoxi, his body flickering, tearing through space, and the next moment they were within the boundaries of Zi Zai Tian.</p><p>Zi Zai Tian was no longer peaceful. The divine realm was collapsing, chaos reigned everywhere.</p><p>"Where is the person you mentioned?"</p><p>He had no time to observe the common people's lives; Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If this person could truly save the divine realm, what did his own sacrifice matter?</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his beast-pet…" Luo Ruoxi took a breath, explaining.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's but different.  It was her father's.</p><p>This also explained why the remnant thought of the Immortal Emperor immediately recognized him as its master after seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Is your father also an Emperor? Or possesses power surpassing an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The library's chaos was resolved by the blood in the pendant, restoring his clarity.  Could it be that not only is she the daughter of an Emperor, but her father is as well, and even more powerful?</p><p>If that's the case, why is he unconscious?</p><p>Why does he need a flawed Heavenly Dao to awaken?</p><p>"He isn't an Emperor, but… the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao? Your father… is the Heavenly Dao?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that great hand, falling into a coma. The Heavenly Dao scattered into three parts: the Ordered Heavenly Dao and the Flawed Heavenly Dao, entering spatial currents. I took over the Natural Heavenly Dao, maintaining the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, I must gather the scattered parts… That's why I'm so determined, I cannot fail!  That's why I specifically went to the Master's Continent, studied the Spring and Autumn Annals, and tried to defeat Kong Shi! When I fought Kong Shi, I also asked him for help with this."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>He had only recently met her on the Master's Continent, and she'd already told him her story, that she had to save a loved one.  He hadn't understood then, but now it all clicked.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heavenly Dao of the divine realm!</p><p>Could the Heavenly Dao really take human form and have children?</p><p>"You took over the Natural Heavenly Dao… you don't have a Heavenly Dao fragment within you?" Suddenly realizing the inconsistency in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Being controlled and merging with it are two different concepts.</p><p>“I merely control it; I'm not part of the Heavenly Dao…” Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the Heavenly Dao flaw; he didn't need her to die.</p><p>Though he didn't want to accept this fate, he didn't want the girl before him to be harmed.</p><p>“If I remove the Heavenly Dao flaw within me, your father will live, and we can even defeat the Ruthless One, right?” Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>“That… I'm not sure…”</p><p>Looking up at the collapsed Divine Realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.</p><p>The Divine Realm was her father's foundation.  Even if he awoke, could he really defeat such a powerful foe with their foundation in ruins?</p><p>It was hard to say!</p><p>“It seems you're not certain either.  If so, we'll rely on ourselves… We'll have to find our own way!” Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth.  “You, me, my clone, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we cooperate with Master Kong, we might have a chance!”</p><p>“Master Kong? He…” Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>“Master Kong is dead, you say?  He isn't truly dead. If I'm not mistaken, his death at your hands was just a way to separate himself from the Heavenly Dao…  He's likely like Wei Changfeng, a ‘Primordial Soul Body’!”</p><p>Zhang Xuan explained.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng had given him the answer. Master Kong’s preservation of his intellect was, like Wei Changfeng's, thanks to his Primordial Soul Body.  He could remain clear-minded even in the womb.</p><p>Plus, with pre-planned measures, resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn't expected this.</p><p>“Let's go check. If my guess is right, he should have recovered already. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea…” Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Master Kong’s students, including Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and others, were all incredibly powerful. Even without the Emperor's help, they would certainly find a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none of them were seen.</p><p>There must have been something more important they were doing, something they wanted to accomplish while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!</p><p>That something, clearly, was Master Kong's recovery.</p><p>“This…” Luo Ruoxi's heart trembled, suddenly understanding.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Without further explanation, with a wave of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared where Master Kong lived, and indeed saw an elderly man levitating cross-legged in the air.  Seeing them, he smiled slightly:  “You’ve come.”</p><p>If it wasn't Master Kong, who else could it be!</p><p>This master of all ages hadn’t disappointed him!</p><p>Just as he'd guessed, while everyone was focused on the Tidal Sea, he had resurrected.</p><p>“You…” Luo Ruoxi’s body trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected, and the Immortal Emperor had also come back to life, but… she hadn't expected it to be so fast!</p><p>“I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao, and made preparations beforehand. The nameless giant in the Ghostly Soul Pool was my plan. When you killed him, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao’s shackles and reconstitute my physical body.  I've only just fully recovered.”</p><p>Master Kong smiled faintly.</p><p>He was skilled in manipulating time. It seemed only a day or two had passed in the Divine Realm, but he’d actually spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength.</p><p>Decades, perhaps.</p><p>“The three of us are strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won’t be easy…”</p><p>Seeing Master Kong's true recovery, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.</p><p>It wasn't about diminishing their own spirit, it was the reality.</p><p>Even with so many people working together, they hadn’t been able to stop the opponent.  Even with Master Kong added, what difference would it make?</p><p>It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>“Individually, or even together, we're no match for him, but… what if we combined everyone's power into one person?”</p><p>Master Kong looked at them, smiling.</p><p>“Combine it into one person?”</p><p>This time, not only did Luo Ruoxi frown, but Zhang Xuan was also full of doubt.</p><p>“That hand that tore apart the Divine Realm and shattered the Heavenly Dao—its power was undeniable.  The Ruthless One absorbed all that power and consumed fifty years' worth of the Divine Realm's spiritual energy.  Individually, even among the dozen or so Emperors, none of us are a match…”</p><p>Master Kong said, “But if we combine our strength into a single person… it might be different!”</p><p>“How do we combine it?”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked at him.</p><p>It was easy to say, but difficult to do.</p><p>The Emperors were already at the peak of the Divine Realm.  If absorbing others' power were so easy, she wouldn't have remained stagnant for so many years.</p><p>“It’s simple… We'll concentrate our power into Zhang Xuan. Once he breaks through the Emperor's shackles, he can save the Divine Realm!”</p><p>Master Kong said.</p><p>"Me?" Zhang Xuan was startled. "Why me?"</p><p>"Lingxi Di Zun's cultivation is about freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven, and with loved ones, he can never truly transcend! If I'm not mistaken, during our battle, you also gave up and intended to be killed by me!"</p><p>Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered this, so their initial engagement resembled sparring rather than a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>"Inability to transcend naturally means one cannot unleash their full power. Even with more true energy, one cannot reach the highest realm! As for me..."</p><p>Kong Shi nodded.  "I cherish all beings and wish to save the world, yet I don't want others to sacrifice for me.  Too much compassion is also a weakness! If I had been ruthless and annihilated the Yiling, we wouldn't be in this situation..."</p><p>If the Yiling had been completely exterminated, the ruthless one wouldn't have been resurrected, and this situation wouldn't exist.</p><p>"Therefore, I'm not suitable either! But Zhang Xuan, his cultivation method suits him perfectly, without flaws. He emphasizes living authentically; even facing death, as long as he lives without regret, his heart is at peace. Such a person possesses greater tolerance and potential for growth. Only this way can he ascend higher and further!"</p><p>Kong Shi continued.</p><p>To live is to return, to die is to yearn for each other forever!</p><p>Someone who doesn't fear death won't be hindered by other things.</p><p>"This..." Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi's intense gaze. "Don't refuse. Even if we had time to train others, I doubt anyone could do better than you! While Lingxi Di Zun doesn't possess a Heaven fragment, he's controlled Heaven for years and has his own understanding of it; I control the orderly Heaven. If we infuse our power into you, you'll possess the complete power of Heaven! Combined with your clone's Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, you can completely stabilize the Nine Heavens, control the universe, battle in the Nine Skies, and destroy all things!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Seeing the decision was made, Zhang Xuan nodded; further explanations were pointless.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan stiffened, instantly transforming into Heaven, soaring above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were instantly cleansed, growing stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>"You want to stop me? Fine, I'll kill you, then go kill Zhang Xuan…"</p><p>After knocking Luo Qiqi and his clone away, the ruthless one sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and numerous emperors was indeed strong, but still weaker than him.</p><p>The Tide Sea had consumed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the God Realm.  This power now fueled him; his every move carried the ability to destroy the world.  These emperors and god-kings, though representing the pinnacle of the God Realm, were insignificant.</p><p>The ruthless one now seemed to embody the entire God Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>"The God Realm is destroyed; our lives are meaningless. I, Yun Chi, will perish with you…"</p><p>Yun Chi the Great transformed into his true form, a massive five-clawed golden dragon, lunging at him.</p><p>"You? Not worthy!"</p><p>The ruthless one crushed the golden dragon in his palm; it struggled in vain.</p><p>"Old friend, wait for me!"</p><p>Fu Meng the Great roared, transforming into his white tiger form and soaring forward.</p><p>The Immortal Emperor, his Immortal Fire Phoenix true form blazing across the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming the Great, his true form a giant turtle, seemed to support the heavens.</p><p>The four divine beasts, guarding the four corners of the God Realm, simultaneously transformed. The collapsing God Realm slowed down.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the ruthless one suppressed the four beasts, a fierce killing intent flashing in his eyes: "Since you seek death, I'll grant it…"</p><p>Roaring, about to kill them all, he felt his raised arm stiffen, stopping mid-air.</p><p>"Want to kill them? Ask me first…"</p><p>Then, to the shocked gazes of everyone, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man now radiated immense power, ten times stronger than before, descending from the heavens like a world unto himself.</p><p>"Quite the improvement…"</p><p>The ruthless one paused, his gaze serious.</p><p>He couldn't understand how the opponent's strength had increased so dramatically in mere minutes.</p><p>"But what does it matter? Even the God Realm at its peak couldn't withstand me. I don't believe you can stop me…"</p><p>With a cold snort, the ruthless one attacked again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met the attack.</p><p>As they clashed, space tore, and air currents raged.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, at Kong Shi's base, watched with worry.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the God King level; their former glory was gone.  However, their level remained, and with sufficient power, they could eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, to win against... it's very difficult! Unless... he can comprehend power beyond the Emperor's realm!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even with over a dozen Emperors combined, they couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even transferring all their power, victory wouldn't be easy. They did this because... only by concentrating power in one person could they possibly reach the peak, truly surpass their limits, and break through!</p><p>"Power beyond the Emperor's realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi's gaze drifted off. Her father, while still alive, had spoken of the same thing, but... she couldn't do it. Could her beloved man?</p><p>"He can... He has an indomitable spirit! And a proud defiance of this world."  Kong Shi smiled, sensing her doubt.</p><p>...</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several blows, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, and a huge, horrifying wound appeared on his chest. As Kong Shi had said, even with their combined power, forming a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were formidable, but you're nothing!" the Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>"I'm no match for you anyway; I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die under your strongest attack…" Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, stopping his attack and looking at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine, I'll grant you that. I'll give you my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then coldly snorted, raising a hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of green light appeared in their palm, smashing down.</p><p>It was indeed their strongest attack. The entire divine realm rumbled, as if it couldn't bear the impact, and another massive crater appeared.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, eyes closed, didn't dodge.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…" Everyone's faces went pale at this sight.</p><p>Luo Qiqie went wild.</p><p>Yun Chi the Great and the others also stared wide-eyed, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was for him to break through his limitations and reach a realm beyond the Emperors, but why didn't he resist? Why did he willingly die?  Wasn't that a betrayal of their good intentions?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortality technique…"</p><p>Kong Shi suddenly spoke, breaking the silence.</p><p>Everyone then saw that Zhang Xuan, whose head had exploded and whose soul had shattered, had the pendant on his chest suddenly burst. A drop of blood floated up, ignited, forming a blazing inferno.  From the flames, a completely unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power, and the blood in the pendant, to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi's pupils contracted.</p><p>The reborn Zhang Xuan no longer possessed the Heavenly Dao Library; he was free from the Heavenly Dao's interference!</p><p>"How did he do that?"</p><p>Kong Shi was equally incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and the soul were fused, inseparable. To break free, he had to shatter his soul and use the Ghost Pool to reform it.  This one, after a single blow, completely escaped.  What method did he use?</p><p>"I understand… He used the Ruthless One's method of breaking free from the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>Soul contracts bind master and servant; unless the master releases it, the servant remains bound… The Heavenly Dao Library was the same, a kind of enhanced contract. Bound to the soul, death wouldn't break it.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One had used a special power to break the soul contract. Zhang Xuan had inquired about the specific method earlier; he must have had his plan then.</p><p>Therefore, he deliberately fought to the death, provoking the strongest attack.  Using this power, he was reborn, and it was a great success!</p><p>"So that's it. That's the method to surpass the Emperor's realm…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, smiled faintly, as if understanding something.  He gestured, and his separated clone instantly transformed into a lotus flower, flying towards him.</p><p>In an instant, it perfectly merged with him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He lightly tapped his foot on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens instantly stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, born at the creation of the Nine Heavens, stabilized the realm.  With its integration, Zhang Xuan achieved perfect oneness with his self-created aspect, effectively mastering its power.</p><p>This fusion, combined with his already peak cultivation, caused a shift, hinting at an imminent breakthrough.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, familial love, romantic love…  merging them all, this is the entirety of the world, this is what it means to be human!”</p><p>A smile played on his lips as Zhang Xuan murmured to himself.  The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Do people perceive the world, creating it, or does the world exist first, then the people? Is it the wind that moves, or the heart?  This question, age-old and timeless, has plagued countless souls.</p><p>But now… none of that matters!  Without life, without emotion, what meaning does a world have, even if it exists?</p><p>Therefore, after mastering romantic love, came universal love!  The interwoven emotions of the world.  All things possess emotion; emotion creates the world, emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.  Hate is emotion.  Joy is emotion.  Pain is emotion.  Parting is emotion. Reunion is emotion!</p><p>“A thousand emotions, all at my command…”</p><p>With a low cry, the barrier to his cultivation within Zhang Xuan shattered.  The Emperor's shackles were broken!</p><p>In an instant, he touched a new world, a new gateway; his soul was swiftly nourished. Countless chaotic energies surged towards him, his physical body rapidly strengthening.</p><p>Before, he only improved by absorbing spiritual energy. Now, spatial turbulence, chaotic energy, even the opponent's green light—all became his, undivided.</p><p>“You…” Hen Ren, never expecting that her all-out attack not only failed to kill him but instead propelled his advancement, raged, "Wah wah!"  She roared, launching another attack.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the high and mighty Emperors who didn't save you in the spatial turbulence is emotion; your feelings of inferiority and anger as my former servant are emotion; your desire to destroy the Divine Realm, to vent your rage, is emotion; even your desire to become stronger…is emotion. Emotion controls you. How can you possibly overcome me, how can you not be controlled by me?”</p><p>A faint smile graced Zhang Xuan's lips; his voice grew faster, louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand,  the previously invincible Hen Ren was bound by countless threads of emotion, immobilized, helpless.  Any emotion would be used by him, controlled by him!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren's eyes.  “Master Zhang, I was your servant, please don’t kill me… I offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It’s too late for that now…” Zhang Xuan smiled faintly, shaking his head.  Controlling the emotions of the world rendered concepts like servitude meaningless. After killing so many divine beings, hurting his girlfriend, Luo Qiqi, and so many friends, forgiveness was impossible today.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils constricted. Before she could finish speaking, a searing pain struck her.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In a flash, she exploded, transforming into countless strands of spiritual energy that flooded the Divine Realm.  The power previously absorbed by the Tidal Sea was returned, revitalizing the desolate wasteland.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“She’s… dead?”</p><p>Yun Chi the Great Emperor, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared in disbelief. They had fought Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power. Such a formidable being, so easily eradicated…what level of power had Zhang Xuan reached?  Could there truly be realms beyond the Emperor?</p><p>“He succeeded…”</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao; I shall return it now…”</p><p>Seeing the “Imperfect Heavenly Dao,” separated from his body, still suspended in mid-air, Zhang Xuan smiled lightly and flicked his finger.</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The library, his companion since rebirth, slammed into the heavens of the Divine Realm.</p><p>A bell-like resonance echoed. The crumbling Divine Realm visibly began to heal; chaotic currents coalesced.  The collapse of the Divine Realm ceased; depleted spiritual energy slowly revived with Hen Ren's demise.</p><p>“It seems the Divine Realm is about to enter a new era of spiritual resurgence…” Zhang Xuan chuckled.  The hole in the Tidal Sea, with the Heavenly Dao restored, would also heal in time, and the Divine Realm's former glory would be restored.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, over here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind. Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step.  The distance was immeasurable; he found himself before a young man, the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan stared, surprised.</p><p>I sensed his unfathomable power before, but only now do I realize he's just a hair's breadth away from my own level, having reached the very peak of the Emperor's realm.  He surpasses Luo Ruoxi by a vast margin.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I'm...Nie Tong!"  The young man, radiating an indomitable sword intent, said calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>He'd never heard that name before.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll take you to see my brother!"  The young man, Nie Tong, chuckled and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind, flying for an indeterminate distance before stopping before a mountain peak.</p><p>Then he saw another young man.</p><p>Their appearance differed only slightly; his raised eyebrows gave him a profound and unreadable air.</p><p>"His strength..." Zhang Xuan trembled.</p><p>This young man's power surpassed even his own! He too had broken through the Emperor's shackles, his cultivation even deeper and more profound!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man smiled lightly, looking over. "And...I am Nie Lingxi's father, the father you know as Luo Ruoxi's father."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan was shocked. "You...are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi had mentioned that her father was the Heavenly Dao. He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I transformed into three beings from one essence; a part of my soul became the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't entirely wrong!" Nie Yun chuckled.</p><p>Zhang Xuan was incredulous.</p><p>This man created the God Realm?</p><p>How powerful must he be then?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow the villains to run rampant without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan questioned.</p><p>If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have completely collapsed. Why did this man remain indifferent?</p><p>Did he even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering, Nie Yun looked at him calmly: "Do you think...there are even more powerful beings above the God Realm?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan hesitated. "Probably..."</p><p>He'd never seen one, but if this man could reach this level, perhaps others could too, even stronger ones.</p><p>Like this one before him.</p><p>"I once suspected that there were more powerful beings above the God Realm, so I used all my strength to peer into the heavens, ultimately attracting the backlash of a higher world...a hand descended from the void!"</p><p>Nie Yun continued, "If I had dodged, the entire God Realm would likely have been wiped out, not a single life remaining...So I blocked that attack, but because of that, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was split off."</p><p>"Restoring myself is simply a matter of thought, but...I understand that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore where that hand came from and what lies beyond the God Realm...it's difficult to do alone. Therefore, I wanted to see if any beings could break through the Emperor's shackles and reach my level!"</p><p>"So, I sent the scattered fragments of the Heavenly Dao to the lowest world... bestowing them upon souls originally from this world, and one soul not of this world. And you, you did not disappoint me!"</p><p>Nie Yun laughed.</p><p>"A soul not from this world?  So my transmigration was because of you?"  Zhang Xuan was shaken.</p><p>No wonder he could transmigrate; it was all orchestrated by this man.</p><p>"Heh!" Nie Yun chuckled lightly. "Those who are inherently of this world have a natural reverence for it, making it much harder to break through its constraints. It was just a whim, I never expected you to actually succeed..."</p><p>"I..." Zhang Xuan blushed. "Without Kong Shi, I would never have reached this level..."</p><p>Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, he could never have attained his current state.</p><p>"I gave him the opportunity, but he didn't seize it. His battle with Lingxi was the perfect chance for him to break through, but he chose to retreat. He thought he had a backup plan and could escape unscathed, but he actually lost his drive to improve. When facing those who transcend us, if one lacks this spirit, how can they ever contend?"</p><p>Nie Yun said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan was silent.</p><p>He had witnessed their battle; Kong Shi indeed lacked decisiveness.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.</p><p>Unfortunately, that single thought cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died..." After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked over, his brows furrowed.</p><p>Did this man not even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled calmly. "Your strength is almost on par with mine now. Do you think, in a life-or-death situation, saving someone would be possible for those two?"</p><p>"That..." Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he truly wished to intervene, he could have easily saved the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>"Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter.  Therefore, her assumed surname is Luo... To make her believe it and avoid emotional outbursts, she's been under the impression I'm still comatose..."</p><p>Nie Yun chuckled wryly: "I guess I've played the ruthless father role pretty well...  Let you explain this to her.  After all, her affections are now focused on you. I, her old father, am probably a distant memory...  Haha, I'll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll raise hell..."</p><p>Seeing such an unreliable father, Zhang Xuan's face twitched.  He could only agree: "Alright..."</p><p>He had no choice. After all, he had taken the man's daughter.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, both my foundation and my constraint. Your ability to overcome this constraint demonstrates your skill and potential. Your future is limitless. As her father, I'm relieved she's with you."</p><p>(To be continued...)</p>
