<h1>Chapter 755:  A Calculated Gamble</h1><p>However, trying to kill him with poison mist was pure wishful thinking.</p><p>Fei Can, clinging to the Golden Sun Armor, trembled, diligently fulfilling its protective duty for Qin Sang.  The poison mist entering Qin Sang's wound was immediately sealed by the detoxifying armor.</p><p>But Cui Ji couldn't see any of this.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed a hand to his wound, rolled to his feet, and sheathed the badly damaged Flying Night Rakshasa.  The Rakshasa had several large, transparent holes and lay motionless. Qin Sang had no time to check its condition; he stowed it away for now.</p><p>The purple light struck again.</p><p>Qin Sang, clutching his wound, could only use the Ebony Sword to barely defend himself.  He showed no desire to fight, his exhaustion and dishevelment evident.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was already slightly inferior to the Purple Nether Orb, making Qin Sang's defense exceptionally difficult.  He was dodging blows clumsily.  His shoulder wound bled profusely, staining his clothes. The lingering blade energy damaged his body, and Qin Sang could only suppress it with his true essence, a process that would take time to complete.</p><p>Cui Ji remained cautious, keeping a safe distance from Qin Sang, never exposing the Bone Lotus or the Purple Nether Orb, and sparingly using his throwing knives.  He planned to wear Qin Sang down.</p><p>If the Blood Profane Radiance could disable the Bone Lotus, the situation would immediately reverse.</p><p>But observing Cui Ji's actions, Qin Sang knew this strategy wouldn't work; his condition was deteriorating. He prepared to retreat, luring his enemy.</p><p>Just then, both Qin Sang and Cui Ji felt a pang of foreboding and looked in the same direction.</p><p>The next moment, the earth shook violently.</p><p>A deafening roar echoed.</p><p>The frenzied Purple Star Eagles shrieked in terror, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang finally saw a blue column of light shoot into the sky in the distance, dispersing the nearby poison mist.  Only after the column dissipated did the purple mist slowly recombine.</p><p>"What exploded?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. The explosion must have occurred near the stone hall.  The sheer scale of the blast indicated its devastating power.  None of the eight people present could have caused this.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Qin Sang was uneasy.  He glanced at Cui Ji, noticing a slight frown and worry in his eyes. His expression suggested he knew something.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly made several deductions. The Bone Lotus changing hands, Cui Ji's relentless attack, and the explosion, combined with Cui Ji's expression, made him realize that this mission was likely more complex than it seemed.</p><p>It wasn't simply about retrieving a treasure for the Merchant Alliance!</p><p>Something unexpected had occurred.</p><p>The beast attack wasn't necessarily a natural disaster!</p><p>The Purple Star Eagles and the subterranean beasts were likely deliberately summoned.</p><p>He recalled the identities of the eight individuals.  Except for Xiang Yi, whose background was unclear and seemed to have close ties to the Alliance Leader, the others were all members of various merchant guilds. This included himself; he was formerly a guest retainer of the Qiongyu Merchant Guild, having been asked to join by Elder Zou when he purchased his qualification.</p><p>The Merchant Alliance, unlike a sect, was a collection of guilds bound by profit.  While outwardly united, they were secretly vying for advantage, constantly undermining each other.</p><p>The Liu couple, the Pan cultivator, the young man with the sword…</p><p>These faces flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Everyone had acted normally since their meeting, showing no signs of deception.</p><p>He couldn't trust anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank. He abandoned the idea of rejoining the group, focused on a single goal: killing Cui Ji and fleeing, avoiding being swept up in the undercurrents of the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>It was best to stay far away from the Alliance Leader and the various merchant guilds.</p><p>Qin Sang defended against the purple light while sending a sword beam behind him to clear a path through the Purple Star Eagles, facing a difficult double attack.</p><p>His breathing grew rapid and shallow, the effects of his injuries increasingly apparent. Even his spiritual sword dimmed; his condition was dire.</p><p>Cui Ji looked at Qin Sang, then at the site of the explosion, his face hesitant.</p><p>Finally, he poured all his true essence into the Purple Nether Orb, unleashing another attack as powerful as the first.</p><p>Facing the ferocious purple light, Qin Sang struggled to defend, his body taking repeated blows. His shoulder wound burst open, blood gushing forth.</p><p>The Golden Sun Armor was even more battered, riddled with dents and cracks.  While not completely destroyed, its repair wouldn't be easy.</p><p>The worst was Qin Sang's condition. To withstand the purple light, he consumed true essence rapidly.  If it weren't for Fei Can's detoxifying armor, he wouldn't have been able to suppress the poison mist. He likely would have been poisoned and barely alive.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated swiftly, disappearing into the flock of purple star eagles.  Cui Ji glanced at Qin Sang, then unexpectedly, instead of pursuing him, he changed direction and rushed towards the site of the recent explosion.</p><p>In his estimation, Qin Sang, gravely wounded, with depleted energy and suffering from both blade wounds and poison, his protective armor nearly destroyed, had no chance of survival amongst the eagles.  Without the protection of the bone lotus, he would have to constantly use his energy for protection, making his energy fluctuations highly visible to the beasts, making escape impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's death was a certainty.  Letting him savor his final despair wasn’t a bad thing either.</p><p>A sly smile played on Cui Ji's lips. Although he longed to kill his enemy with his own hands, he hesitated, fearing contamination of his magical artifact.  He couldn't quickly kill Qin Sang and the matter at the stone hall was more urgent.</p><p>Cui Ji withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his expression shifting. Cui Ji's choice surprised him.  This confirmed his suspicions that the explosion was connected to Cui Ji. He wondered which of the other six individuals was in cahoots with him, and who the victim was; something he hadn't been able to discern earlier.</p><p>Cui Ji's actions had disrupted Qin Sang's plans. He intended to feign poisoning, lure Cui Ji closer, and then unleash his two-headed beast for a surprise attack.  Killing Cui Ji with the beast was highly likely.  Then he would leave this troubled place, avenging the ambush.</p><p>Now that Cui Ji had left, pursuing him was out of the question.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He had to kill Cui Ji! Even if Cui Ji hadn't injured him, the feeling of being targeted was unpleasant. Eliminating the danger was the wise choice. He’d had no opportunities so far, and Cui Ji had seized the advantage.</p><p>Unfortunately, killing Cui Ji here was practically impossible under these circumstances; he would have to find another chance later.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the spot where Cui Ji disappeared.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer; he had to leave immediately. He summoned his two-headed beast, mounted it, and had the fat silkworm enhance his anti-venom armor, shielding the beast’s neck.</p><p>“Lead the way. I need to expel the blade energy from my wound…”</p><p>Qin Sang instructed his beast in a low voice, calming his mind, and focusing internally, diligently circulating his energy. He focused his energy on his wound, gradually expelling the remaining blade energy.</p><p>A hint of color returned to Qin Sang's face. He swallowed a healing pill.</p>
