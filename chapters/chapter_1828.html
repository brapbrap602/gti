Chapter 1819: Qing Fei


The mountain cave appeared to be the lair of the black skeleton.
Suddenly, the sound of cracking bone echoed from within.
The sound was muffled.
Qin Sang's fingers rubbed black powder, having just crushed one of the black skeleton's bones.
Virulent poison had seeped into the marrow, completely decaying the bones, leaving not a trace of white.
Bone dust簌簌fell from his fingertips.
Qin Sang gazed at the White Jade Elder for a long time, his eyes flickering, lines of scripture from the *Poison God Canon* flashing through his mind.
This sacred text of the Poison Dao was incredibly strange.  An ordinary person would certainly avoid it like a tiger, but Qin Sang gained some inspiration from it, even entertaining the thought of experimenting with it himself.
At some point, he sat down cross-legged before the altar, eyes slightly closed, deep in thought.  As his understanding of the *Poison God Canon* deepened, so did his resolve to experiment.
The *Poison God Canon* was a complete inheritance, encompassing fundamental cultivation techniques, corresponding divine abilities, numerous poison control techniques, a catalog of myriad poisons, some poison formulas, and most importantly, the secret art of Body Refinement through Poison Infusion.
The cultivation method could take one to the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage, breaking through the five Talisman Ranks, which is to say, to the threshold of the Soul Formation stage.
It wasn't a cultivation method that led directly to the Great Dao.  The *Poison God Canon* didn't have divisions into volumes or chapters. Perhaps the creator of the cultivation method stopped here, unable to deduce further.
It was understandable. After all, this kind of cultivation method was too extreme, courting death to achieve life.
The *Chapter of the Spirit Sword Nurtured by Slaughter* pursued enlightenment through killing, but with increasing cultivation, the killing intent could be gradually suppressed. The *Poison God Canon*, however, never changed its original intention; its creator seemed incredibly stubborn.
The creators of these kinds of cultivation methods were all exceptionally brilliant individuals, but they also faced unimaginable dangers; one wrong step meant utter destruction.
Grand Patriarchs mostly came from orthodox sects.  Qin Sang had befriended many cultivators in Jusan Zhi. From their conversations, he could only confirm that the Yin Tian Palace in Jusan Zhi had a Grand Patriarch.
The creator of the *Poison God Canon* had reached the Soul Formation stage and left behind such a complete inheritance; it was truly remarkable, worthy of the title Poison God.
Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at the White Jade Elder.  Could the elder carved upon it be the creator?
If the black skeleton were a descendant of the elder, it would be normal for them to devoutly worship before the statue of their ancestor.
His mind returned to the *Poison God Canon*.
He would certainly try the secret art of Body Refinement through Poison Infusion.  Part of the reason he had agreed to Qing Dan Yuanjun's request was this secret art.  Now, Qin Sang was considering how to utilize the fundamental cultivation method of the *Poison God Canon*.
According to the description in the *Poison God Canon*, refining poison into Yuan Qi, given a sufficient supply of high-grade poison, could greatly increase the speed of cultivation. This was what tempted Qin Sang the most.
Changing his cultivation method was absolutely impossible. Losing the seven Slaughter Talismans of the *Chapter of the Spirit Sword Nurtured by Slaughter* would immediately drastically reduce his cultivation speed.
If the *Poison God Canon* were an orthodox cultivation method leading directly to the Great Dao, it would be another matter. Forcibly walking the Poison Dao, even if it brought temporary benefits, held an uncertain future.  A simple assessment revealed the disadvantages outweighed the advantages.
So, could he learn from the subtleties of the *Poison God Canon* and adapt it for his own use?
The core principle of the *Poison God Canon* was to devour virulent poison and transform it into Poison Yuan, thereby achieving the goal of rapidly increasing cultivation.
Through comprehending the cultivation method, Qin Sang discovered that the foundation of this cultivation method revolved around refining poison into Yuan Qi, which essentially used external substances for cultivation.
Qin Sang's idea was to extract only the part about refining poison into Yuan Qi and integrate it into his own cultivation method, using it selectively.
Qin Sang had done this kind of thing before. The *Celestial Demon Body Tempering* cultivation method was an example, where he discarded the parts related to demonic bloodlines and cultivated it forcibly.
Without cultivating the complete method, he couldn't use the corresponding Poison Dao divine abilities, but that didn't matter.  As long as it could aid his cultivation, it was enough.
Furthermore, the cultivation method of the *Poison God Canon* was undoubtedly meticulously designed for Poison Yuan, perfectly suited for it. Without cultivating this method, there would inevitably be inconsistencies.  He feared the Poison Yuan wouldn't be under his complete control, becoming a hidden danger, perhaps even disrupting his True Yuan and shaking his foundation.
The *Chapter of the Spirit Sword Nurtured by Slaughter* had one unique aspect compared to other cultivation methods: originating from the Slaughter Dao, the method was formless yet all-encompassing.  This was why Qin Sang had this idea. Even if the method couldn't fully restrain Poison Yuan, he could still suppress it with the power of the Poison Pearl.
The reasons Qin Sang dared to entertain this notion, despite the risks of the *Poison God Canon*, were twofold.
Firstly, he saw a definite possibility of success, and the prospects were very alluring.
Secondly, he was confident in minimizing the risks.
The Poison Pearl could suppress the toxins for him, delaying the onset of poisoning.
When devouring the sacred object of Myriad Poison Mountain and restoring the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit, Qin Sang had confirmed that the more high-grade poison he devoured, the more the Poison Pearl would grow. At least, it hadn't reached its limit yet.
This also demonstrated how unfathomable the Fat Silkworm's talent was; even a single Poison Pearl separated from it was so extraordinary.
With Stellar Body Tempering and Poison Infusion Body Refinement, his physical body would receive double the tempering. The speed of improvement would be astonishing.
Even if his cultivation couldn't reach the Soul Formation stage in time, as long as his physical body broke through, he could avert danger.  The *Poison God Canon* clearly stated that a breakthrough in either the physical body or True Yuan could resolve the crisis.
As long as he made sufficient contributions to the orthodox sects, he could request a Grand Patriarch to perform the Star Yuan Infusion ritual.  He didn't need to worry about that.
Furthermore, if the Poison Infusion Body Refinement was as miraculous as described in the secret art, the requirements for Star Yuan might be even lower.
The biggest limitation of the *Poison God Canon* was the difficulty in finding enough high-grade poison, and this was precisely what Qin Sang had in abundance.
The vast flower field outside contained an unknown amount of accumulated flower nectar. It would be a pity not to utilize it properly.
Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he rose to leave the cave.
‘Creak…’
The stone door opened, and Qin Sang stepped out.
The unfamiliar aura immediately alerted the Flower Spirits, and flower cocoons emerged from the blossoms.
At this moment, Qin Sang formed a strange hand seal with a single palm and pressed it against his chest, instantly changing his aura.
In an instant, the flower field returned to tranquility.  The gently trembling cocoons ceased opening and slowly sank back into the blossoms, the Flower Spirits continuing their slumber.
He had used a secret art from the *Poison God Canon* to alter his aura, deceiving the Flower Spirits' perception, making them see him as one of their own. Cultivating these poisonous flowers required knowledge of this secret art.
Seeing the secret art take effect, Qin Sang nodded inwardly and quietly flew to a mountain peak. Then, he flew along the edge of the space, examining the spirit array, without disturbing any Flower Spirits along the way.
The flower fields varied in grade, the two deepest ones being top-grade.
Qin Sang arrived behind the two top-grade flower fields and gazed towards the mountain peak that had startled him earlier.
According to the *Poison God Canon*, this could be considered an aperture of the flower fields, serving a special purpose.
There was a hidden danger in cultivating these poisonous flowers in large quantities.
If the flower nectar wasn't collected in time, it would fuse with resentful energy and give birth to Flower Fairies within the Flower Spirits.
The Flower Fairy was the evil spirit Qin Sang had slain.
The secret art of the *Poison God Canon* could only deceive Flower Spirits, not Flower Fairies.
Flower Fairies were innately imbued with deep resentful energy that couldn't be dispelled.  They were inherently cruel, relentlessly killing any living being they encountered, posing a danger to the owner of the flower field.
To prevent powerful Flower Fairies from being born in the flower field and usurping control, special arrangements had been made. If the flower nectar wasn't collected for a long time, it would flow towards the aperture.
The black skeleton had been dead for an unknown period.  The continuously flowing nectar made it difficult to imagine how much had accumulated in the aperture.
Dense poison emanated from the aperture, enveloping the mountain peak. Qin Sang sensed great danger from afar and dared not approach.
The aperture wouldn't birth Flower Fairies and wouldn't affect the flower fields for now.  Qin Sang didn't plan to deal with it yet, intending to explore it later when he had the ability.
He took out the round pearl and toyed with it in his hand.
The pearl appeared pure, but it contained an astonishing amount of resentful energy, unsuitable for cultivation.
Refining the pearl would indeed yield a large amount of Poison Yuan, but it would also affect his mind with resentful energy, causing a drastic change in temperament.
Therefore, there was a particular time for collecting flower nectar. It had to be the purest nectar.
As long as he consistently used pure flower nectar, he wouldn't be affected by resentful energy.
“Poison Flowers, Flower Spirits, Flower Fairies…”
Qin Sang murmured these words.
Would pure flower nectar truly not cause a change in temperament?
Qin Sang turned to look at the flower field.
The flowers swayed, so vibrant and beautiful.
The *Poison God Canon* recorded that the name of this flower was Flower Spirit. This Flower Spirit wasn't the same as the other Flower Spirits; it referred to the main body of the spirit flower, without sentience.
But this poisonous flower was too strange.  It could give birth to Flower Fairies, indicating the possibility of spiritual awareness. Qin Sang didn't dare to completely trust the record.
Was the flower nectar nourished by resentful energy truly pure? Were there other unknown dangers hidden within the cultivation method?
For instance, perhaps the White Jade Elder wasn't the creator but a statue of an evil god.
Cultivating the *Poison God Canon* would eventually lead to being entangled by resentful energy, turning oneself into a believer and sacrifice of the evil god.
Qin Sang sneered. Resentful energy inevitably acted upon the Primordial Spirit. If the *Poison God Canon* were a trap set by an evil god, it had chosen the wrong target.
Of course, Qin Sang hadn't found any signs related to an evil god yet. It was just speculation.
The Jade Buddha gave Qin Sang the confidence to try, but he wouldn't be reckless.
Qin Sang formed a rough plan.
He would first try to refine the poison of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit, confirming his ability to cultivate Poison Yuan. Then, he would refine this round pearl, ensuring the Jade Buddha could dispel the resentful energy. Only then could he cultivate with peace of mind.
Qin Sang surveyed the entire space. If everything went according to plan, this place would become the foundation of his rise. Relying on these flower fields, he could reach unimaginable heights in a very short time.
Compared to cultivators of the same level, he was still young and didn't seem to need to rush, but to find the path to ascension before the orthodox sects, he had to increase his strength quickly.
Moreover, since he had obtained this opportunity, after weighing the gains and losses and the risks, there was no reason to miss it.
He could never have too much time.  Breaking through one day earlier meant one more chance of achieving the Great Dao in the future.
As for the pain that refining poison into Yuan Qi and Poison Infusion Body Refinement would bring, Qin Sang didn't care. What pain could compare to being turned into a refined corpse?
Thinking of this, Qin Sang was eager to return to the cave, but he had to do one thing first.
His figure flickered, flying to a mountain peak in the center of the space, and sat down cross-legged, his divine sense spreading out, sensing the entire grand array.
Moments later, the mountains trembled, and rumbling sounds echoed among the peaks.
Above the sky, in all directions of the space, the distorting force manifested by the spirit array vibrated intensely, forming a storm that spiraled upwards.
To the naked eye, it appeared as if someone was painting in the sky with ink.
Qin Sang was extremely busy, his ten fingers flicking, True Yuan pouring out, transforming into streams of talisman restrictions that flew in all directions.
He was repairing the spirit array.
With the passage of time, the spirit array had deformed, exposing the flower field.  Now, Qin Sang was resealing the space, preventing others from intruding, and claiming the flower field as his own.
The phenomena outside were more violent than inside the space.
Where the palace once stood, howling winds spread outwards, and the fog banks disintegrated, giving birth to new whirlwinds that swept across the land.
This wasn't ordinary wind; it was infused with poisonous mist. Within the raging wind, large swaths of azure flowers bloomed, then shattered just as quickly, a cycle of life and death, signifying that the void seemed on the verge of collapse.
At this moment, outside the Poison Lake, Qing Dan Yuanjun and Bo Xian Shanren sat and stood, respectively.  They had just consumed medicinal pills and were taking turns healing their injuries and detoxifying.
They keenly sensed the changes within the Poison Lake.  Qing Dan Yuanjun abruptly stood up, exchanged a glance with Bo Xian Shanren, and immediately returned to the Poison Lake.
Passing through the outer layer of poisonous water, they immediately saw a massive fog bank.  Within the fog bank, chaotic forces surged, interspersed with flashes of poisonous restrictions, rapidly spreading outwards.
The two True Monarchs' expressions were incredibly grave.
Before the changes, Qin Sang might have had a sliver of hope. Now, with the collapse of the Poison Lake's interior and Qin Sang at the center of the collapse, he was almost certainly dead.
Unless a miracle occurred.
Even if they risked their lives and entered the fog bank, they might not even find his body.
After a long silence, Bo Xian Shanren sighed, "Fortunately, fellow Daoist obtained that spirit tree. It's a pity about Qing Feng Daoshi…"
Qing Dan Yuanjun also sighed, "No body to be found, alive or dead. How am I to explain this to Zhi Jian Zhenren?"
As far as they knew, Qing Feng Daoshi was a solitary cultivator without a sect or disciples, but Zhi Jian Zhenren valued him greatly, even establishing a cave dwelling for him within his own daoist compound.
Inside the flower field.
Qin Sang looked up at the sky.  Through the spirit array, he saw the two True Monarchs retreat from the Poison Lake and then sent several restrictions into the array.
Withdrawing his gaze and sweeping it across the flower field, Qin Sang noticed that some flower nectar had ripened; it was time to collect it.
He retrieved a jade bottle from his Qian Jun Ring, descended into a flower field, and hovered above a spirit flower.
The spirit flower was enormous.
The center of the blossom was like a silver basin.
The Flower Spirit was slumbering within the blossom.  Qin Sang extended his right hand, True Yuan swirling in his palm, transforming into a transparent, long needle.
He gently inserted the needle tip.
As if in pain, the spirit flower's blossom contracted abruptly, its petals trembling.  A moment later, it slowly unfurled again.
Qin Sang withdrew the needle and then flew to the next flower.
As he collected from more and more spirit flowers, a crystal drop gradually condensed at the tip of the needle.  This was pure flower nectar, pure flower poison!
Once a drop formed, he collected it into the jade bottle.
Like a bee collecting pollen, Qin Sang busied himself in the flower field, finally arriving at the two top-grade flower fields.
The quality of the flower nectar produced by different fields wasn't significantly different, but the top-grade fields required fewer spirit flowers to condense a single drop.
His movements became increasingly proficient, and he quickly collected all the flower nectar, waving his hand to suspend the jade bottles before him.
Qin Sang smiled faintly, storing them in his sleeve, and returned to the cave.
He immersed his divine sense into the White Jade Elder again, reading the *Poison God Canon* several times, memorizing it by heart, then sat motionless.
Within the Poison Lake, time was unknown.
Undisturbed, Qin Sang remained in meditative trance for an unknown duration, finally beginning to move.
The Poison Pearl flew out of his dantian, and the poison-repelling light shimmered, drawing out a wisp of virulent poison.
Qin Sang took a deep breath and drew it into his body!
