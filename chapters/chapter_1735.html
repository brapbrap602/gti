<h1>Chapter 1726: The Radiant Gold Sword Grotto</h1><p>The western lands are surrounded on all sides by fiery storms, making the environment similar to the western desert almost everywhere.  On the edges of the western lands, oases and life are scarce.  Only closer to the center does the moisture gradually increase, but it's far from abundant. Compared to other realms, the entire western land is arid and desolate.</p><p>Cultivators, like ordinary people, live near water sources.  Of the major realms Qin Sang has traveled, the North Sea and the Canglang Sea are mostly ocean, yet they offer far more habitable areas than the western lands.  The western lands are the most sparsely populated, and life is the hardest here for ordinary people.</p><p>On the way to the Great Compassion Temple, Qin Sang intentionally slowed his speed to experience the local customs and traditions, discovering that Buddhism is deeply prevalent here.  The Buddhist schools in the western lands are slightly different from those in the Central Plains.</p><p>Passing through one oasis after another, Qin Sang frequently saw Buddhist disciples. These disciples traveled the world, drawing in moisture and nourishing the land, preventing the people of the western lands from suffering displacement due to disappearing oases.</p><p>Speaking with Master Zhitang and others, Qin Sang learned that within the Buddhist schools of the western lands, some monks dedicate their lives to saving all beings, acting on their beliefs. Some achieve enlightenment through their actions, becoming true holy monks; others, with exceptional talent, may inadvertently hinder their own cultivation in the process.</p><p>Of course, the western lands are not solely the domain of Buddhism; other schools of thought exist, but they are less powerful.</p><p>While traveling, Qin Sang exchanged insights on body refinement techniques with Master Huaiyin.  Qin Sang had intended to seek instruction from Master Huaiyin, so his initiative was most welcome.</p><p>Qin Sang has cultivated the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* to the mid-fourth stage.  In terms of realm, he is only slightly inferior to Master Huaiyin, and therefore has the qualifications to exchange insights, not just to receive instruction.  Furthermore, one cultivates Buddhist practices and the other demonic arts—two completely different lineages. By comparing notes, both gain insights.</p><p>The two conversed happily, neglecting the others.</p><p>Master Huaiyin revealed that body refinement techniques have long existed at the Great Compassion Temple, but limited by the cultivation environment of this world, purely physical cultivators like him are extremely rare.</p><p>“Master, your dedication to the way of body refinement has yielded such great achievements. I am truly impressed,” Qin Sang praised.</p><p>Master Huaiyin showed no pride. Looking at Qin Sang, he said meaningfully, “The reason our temple has been able to maintain the Protector Vajra lineage is not only due to the relatively complete teachings but also another reason…”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the unusual tone and his eyes flashed.  “I would be grateful to hear it.”</p><p>He glanced at Master Zhitang beside him.  He could guess that this was a secret of the Great Compassion Temple, something normally never revealed to an outsider. Master Huaiyin's initiative clearly meant to elicit the question.</p><p>Master Zhitang smiled and remained silent, showing no intention of stopping Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin clasped his hands and said, “Our temple possesses a hidden location called the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto, possibly an ancient site where sword cultivators sparred or fought. Over time, the sword intent within the grotto vanished, but somehow the sword energy mutated, transforming into radiant gold sword energy that persists to this day.  Actually, it can no longer be called sword energy. Sword cultivators cannot comprehend the supreme sword arts of the ancient sword cultivators from it, but for us body cultivators, it is an invaluable place. Absorbing radiant gold sword energy into the body to refine the physique is incredibly efficient! Without the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto, I fear I would have faced many more obstacles to reach my current cultivation level.”</p><p>Qin Sang had not expected Master Huaiyin to reveal the origin and function of the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto so completely.</p><p>Wasn't this a tempting invitation to visit the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto?</p><p>Improving his *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* was Qin Sang's top priority.  Encountering such a treasure trove was an opportunity he couldn't miss.</p><p>He was also acutely aware that the other party's disclosure of the Radiant Gold Sword Grotto must have ulterior motives.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing at the peak of this world, did not fear the other party's motives. He immediately said, “I cannot hide it from Master’s keen eyes. I am indeed seeking such an opportunity.  How can I gain access to the grotto?”</p><p>“With the True Monarch's command, our temple will naturally provide convenient access! After meeting with the various temple abbots, I will immediately take the True Monarch to the grotto.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin declared decisively, then changed his tone.  “However…”</p><p>“Huaiyin,” Master Zhitang interrupted, then addressed Qin Sang.  “Let me explain my matter to the True Monarch myself. I would like to ask the True Monarch to protect me!”</p><p>“Protect you?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, suddenly understanding, his face showing surprise.  “Master, are you planning to break through to the Divine Transformation stage now?”</p><p>Given the Great Compassion Temple's strength, there was nothing else in this world that would require external protection. Qin Sang could only think of this possibility.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Master Zhitang nodded.</p><p>“This… Master, why the urgency?”</p><p>Qin Sang truly did not expect someone to attempt a breakthrough knowing about the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>Unless his lifespan ends naturally, or a catastrophic event is imminent and unavoidable, the news of the Ascension Platform brought by Qin Sang has given this world new hope.  A delay wouldn't hurt.</p><p>"This monk has long been preparing for the breakthrough to the Transcendence Realm, accumulating strength for a full calamity cycle.  The three-year period will be complete in three years, and I should seize the opportunity to break through. As the saying goes, the full moon wanes; the time is right, and delay is futile. Success will allow me to join hands with True Monarch Qin Sang to overcome this world's great calamity; even in failure, it will serve as a warning to those who come after, that the Heavenly Devilish Sound is not to be underestimated. We must fully assist the True Monarch for even a sliver of hope," Master Zhitang said, hands clasped, his expression calm.</p><p>Masters Huaiyin and others showed worry in their eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had sensed this before. After he had Master Xingji inform the Poison King and others about the Heavenly Devilish Sound, they hadn't fully believed it; some probably considered it alarmist.</p><p>If it weren't for the lure of the Ascension Platform, those people might not have tried their best.</p><p>Ultimately, it was because of Qin Sang's unique status.</p><p>Having cultivated to this level, who would believe themselves inferior, their resolve weak?</p><p>Since Qin Sang could succeed, why couldn't they? There are more treasures in the world than just the Spirit-Subduing Incense; with sufficient preparation, success is possible.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang couldn't explain the reason.</p><p>"Master, do you have Spirit-Subduing Incense?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Master Zhitang nodded. "I obtained the formula from the Holy Venerable Huiguang years ago and refined one stick. Unfortunately, the rare herbs needed for superior Spirit-Subduing Incense are extremely rare; even after searching throughout the Western Lands, our temple couldn't gather them all.  Furthermore, our temple possesses a Buddhist treasure that can protect my primordial spirit and mitigate the harm from the tribulation's winds, allowing me to face the heart demon tribulation in optimal condition. However, this treasure requires another to wield it, protecting me remotely.  The higher the cultivator's cultivation, the greater the effect.  I implore the True Monarch to handle it.  Rest assured, True Monarch, this is a tribulation-passing treasure; it won't cause the tribulation to affect you, only greatly consuming your true essence."</p><p>Master Zhitang explained in detail.</p><p>So such a treasure existed in the world.</p><p>Cultivators find it difficult to borrow power during heavenly tribulations; external interference not only causes the tribulation to mutate and intensify, but also affects the intervener.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang immediately thought of Liuli and quickly inquired, but his hopes were dashed.</p><p>This treasure, the Mingwang Diagram, depicts the Immovable Mingwang and is a treasured heirloom of the Great Compassion Temple. Only those who have cultivated the temple's fundamental techniques can receive its protection, not even Master Huaiyin, from the same lineage.</p><p>Legend says there were originally three tribulation diagrams, each corresponding to a tribulation; the other two are incomplete.  The Western Lands Buddhist sects are focused on refining their hearts, actually wanting the other two; unexpectedly, the Mingwang Diagram is now the most important.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly but didn't hesitate, readily agreeing. "Master, rest assured, I will assist you!"</p><p>The monks rejoiced at this.</p><p>"Since both Masters have brought this up, I will no longer conceal anything.  My purpose in coming here was to ask Master Huaiyin for a secret technique—the one he used at Emperor's Mandate Mountain to reverse injuries. I am preparing for the future; should I have to cross the Eastern Sea to Guihu, this technique might give me a chance of survival."</p><p>Qin Sang said earnestly, "Master, rest assured, I won't take advantage of the situation.  My request for the technique is separate from these matters; regardless, I will do my utmost to help you through the tribulation."</p><p>Master Zhitang nodded. "I trust the True Monarch, but this technique is a secret transmission of Huaiyin's lineage; it depends on Huaiyin's decision."</p><p>"Upon returning to the temple, I will pass on the *Inner Lion Seal* to the True Monarch," Master Huaiyin responded without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened slightly. "Master, do you have any requests?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "If the Ascension Platform is found, I only ask the True Monarch to leave a place for me beside you; I ask for nothing else."</p><p>As they spoke, the Great Compassion Temple came into view.</p><p>The Great Compassion Temple was built by a lake.</p><p>This lake was the largest in the Western Lands; standing on the shore, the opposite bank was invisible, appearing like an ocean to the uninitiated.</p><p>Upon arrival, the abbots of various temples had been waiting at the Great Compassion Temple for some time.</p><p>It was ostensibly a water and land ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the ceremony, repeating what he had done in Zhongzhou.</p><p>After the ceremony, Master Zhitang went into seclusion to prepare for his breakthrough in three years, and Master Huaiyin took Qin Sang to the meditation hall to impart the technique.</p><p>In the meditation hall.</p><p>The two sat face to face on meditation cushions.</p><p>Master Huaiyin transmitted the technique mentally, his fingers lightly touching Qin Sang's forehead, a golden light shot out. Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes, and a profound secret technique appeared in his mind.</p><p>"The Inner Lion Seal…"</p><p>Qin Sang felt the secret technique while hearing Master Huaiyin's faint voice.</p><p>"The Inner Lion Seal is one of the nine ancient Bright Seals.  Legend says the nine Bright Seals have some connection to Daoism, but their origins are unknown. Each seal has a different function, all with mysterious powers. Our temple only possesses the Inner Lion Seal, and even then, only half…"</p><p>"Even half a seal is incredibly powerful.  With your current physical realm, True Lord, you should be able to use it."</p><p>"True Lord, you can think of this seal as a way to restore yourself.  Even if you suffer severe injuries, even fundamental damage, as long as you have time to form the seal, you can quickly recover, turn defeat into victory, even reverse life and death, just as the poor monk did…"</p><p>"But because it's only half a seal, the technique is incomplete."</p><p>"The poor monk does not know the full power of the complete Inner Lion Seal. The half-seal has many limitations that cannot be ignored."</p><p>"First, the seal can only be used once per injury.  Repeated use can lead to backlash, potentially causing your body to collapse."</p><p>"Second, after using the seal, it's best to leave the dangerous area quickly, because this is not true restoration. After the seal's effects wear off, the injuries will worsen, even more severely than before."</p><p>…</p><p>With Master Huainyin's guidance, Qin Sang quickly understood the Inner Lion Seal, marveling at its mysterious power. He wondered how powerful the complete seal would be.</p><p>As Master Huaiyin said, this technique couldn't truly heal injuries, but it could be life-saving in crucial moments.</p><p>"Thank you, Master, for passing on this technique," Qin Sang said, bowing.</p><p>He didn't start practicing the Inner Lion Seal immediately; he had plenty of time during his journey through the storm.</p><p>Incidentally, this was his second Buddhist seal.  He previously received the Seven Teacher Seal from the Jing Hai Sect. While not as profound as the Inner Lion Seal, it was a killing technique.</p><p>Qin Sang already mastered the Auspicious Seal, Lotus Seal, Wheel Platform Seal, and Demon-Crushing Seal. After his breakthrough, he could cultivate the fifth and sixth seals: the Vajra Great Wisdom Seal and the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>Master Huaiyin also stood up and said, "The poor monk will now open the Radiant Gold Sword Cave.  True Lord, you can cultivate there for three years."</p><p>Then, Master Huaiyin took Qin Sang away from the Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Radiant Gold Sword Cave was located in the lake in front of the temple.</p><p>The two didn't need to use their true energy to protect themselves as they dove down.  Qin Sang estimated they were nearing the lake bottom when Master Huaiyin made a hand gesture.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Buddhist restriction fluctuate, and then saw a faint Buddha light appearing on the dark lakebed, below which was a mountain!  They were far from the lake bottom; the real bottom was below this mountain.</p><p>"The world changes!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, following Master Huaiyin through the restriction and into a cave.</p><p>The moisture was blocked out; the cave was dry.</p><p>Standing at the entrance, Qin Sang already felt an extremely sharp energy within the cave.  Before even seeing the so-called Radiant Gold Sword Qi, he felt like he was being pierced by countless swords!</p><p>When he saw the Radiant Gold Sword Cave, he stood gazing for a long time.</p><p>The cave was blindingly bright with gold.  Streams of Radiant Gold Sword Qi, like real golden swords, moved about within the cave.</p><p>Master Huaiyin surprisingly told him not to resist the sword energy, to let the Radiant Gold Sword Qi pierce his body—almost self-torture, letting the sword energy destroy his flesh!</p><p>"It not only has the effect of purifying the meridians and rebuilding from destruction, but the strange energy in the sword qi, which the poor monk calls Radiant Gold Qi, can also be integrated into oneself, strengthening the body. True Lord, you already have the Divine Transformation cultivation. As long as you can endure the pain, using your true energy to protect your body, absorbing more Radiant Gold Sword Qi, the effect should far surpass what the poor monk achieved back then…"</p><p>Master Huaiyin stepped into the cave, letting the sword energy penetrate him; golden light burst from his body, yet his expression remained calm.</p><p>He referred to "back then" because Master Huaiyin had already refined the Xin Gold Source Crystal; he was different now, absorbing the wandering Geng Gold Qi from the void, this Radiant Gold Sword Cave was no longer meaningful to him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, entered the cave, and immediately a Radiant Gold Sword Qi pierced him. He suppressed his true energy, letting the Radiant Gold Sword Qi penetrate his flesh, tearing pain assaulting him.</p><p>He focused on experiencing it. After the intense pain, a strange energy seemed to merge into his body.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instructed Qin Sang on how to absorb the Radiant Gold Sword Qi, then took his leave.</p><p>Time passed without notice in the cave.  Three years had gone by.</p><p>(End)</p>
