<h1>Chapter 842: Return</h1><p>Chapter 842: Return</p><p>After many days of travel, Qin Sang finally encountered other cultivators.  He learned shocking news that left him deeply stunned.</p><p>A drastic change had occurred in the Demon Sea, completely unexpected by all.</p><p>The Wu tribe's main base, Tianwu Island, in the Demon Sea, was suddenly attacked by the demon race, nearly falling into their hands.</p><p>A large, unknown number of transformed demons, hidden within a monstrous tide of beasts, suddenly appeared near Tianwu Island, like a divine army descending from the heavens.  By the time the Wu cultivators noticed, it was too late.</p><p>The demon race, having long planned this attack, launched a full-scale assault on Tianwu Island, breaking through its protective barrier.</p><p>Countless Tianwu Island cultivators were killed or injured; the Wu tribe suffered heavy losses.  Even worse, the transformed demons had a clear objective: after breaking the barrier, they headed straight for the teleportation array.</p><p>The environments of the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea are similar; both are like tranquil harbors in endless storms, completely isolated from each other by the storms, with no connecting passage.</p><p>Only the teleportation arrays controlled by cultivators allow travel between the two.</p><p>To this day, cultivators are uncertain whether the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea exist within the same sea area, how far apart they are, or whether they are only separated by a storm belt.</p><p>Or perhaps they are vastly distant, only connected due to the accidental discovery of the teleportation array.</p><p>But cultivators in the Canglang Sea, whether righteous or demonic, human or Wu, share a consensus: the teleportation array must be destroyed rather than fall into the hands of the demon race. Otherwise, it would not be cultivators opening up the Demon Sea, but the demon race invading the Canglang Sea.</p><p>With Tianwu Island lost and the demon race controlling the teleportation array, an invasion of the Canglang Sea is imminent, with the Wu tribe being the first to suffer, and humanity not far behind.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and the other cultivators landed on a deserted island and listened to their account.</p><p>These individuals also knew little about the events on Tianwu Island that day; much of what they knew was hearsay.</p><p>It was a life-or-death battle between Nascent Soul masters and transformed demons.  Even the fragments of information they had revealed the battle's brutality and terror.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that when he first came to the Demon Sea and passed through Tianwu Island, Elder Zou had mentioned that a considerable number of human Nascent Soul cultivators were stationed there.</p><p>They could not have remained uninvolved during the battle and were drawn into the conflict. Many Nascent Soul masters had their physical bodies destroyed, only their Nascent Souls escaping.</p><p>The Wu tribe's losses were undoubtedly even more devastating.</p><p>It is said that the demon race once broke into the teleportation hall, but fortunately, the situation did not reach its worst; the demons ultimately failed, and the teleportation array remained under cultivator control.</p><p>Those transformed demons lingered outside Tianwu Island for a long time, and seeing no opportunity, finally dispersed.</p><p>However, once news of Tianwu Island's fall spread, it caused a great stir among the cultivators.</p><p>Everyone was living in fear, including the Nascent Soul masters who ruled their own islands.</p><p>In the Demon Sea, aside from the Human Great Desolate Island, no place had defenses comparable to Tianwu Island.  The near fall of Tianwu Island meant that aside from the Great Desolate Island, there was nowhere safer.</p><p>If another great battle between cultivators and the demon race were to occur, they would be the first to be wiped out.</p><p>Adding to their anxiety was the constant harassment from the monstrous beast tides.  They had been living in fear for a long time, and upon hearing the news, they abandoned their territories and fled back to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The cultivators Qin Sang encountered had been accidentally separated, but they dared not stay in the Demon Sea and, risking their lives, were moving towards the Great Desolate Island, relying solely on their luck.</p><p>Everyone was filled with worry.</p><p>From the bits and pieces of information he gathered, Qin Sang understood why Yu Heng Island received no aid when it was besieged by the monstrous beast tide.</p><p>At that time, monstrous beast tides were lurking around other major islands as well, cutting them off and leaving them to fend for themselves. Later, they learned of the incident at Tianwu Island, and in their shock, they had no time for anyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent too long resting and collecting star snails after breaking out, missing the great exodus.  The islands he saw along the way were not overrun by beast tides, but abandoned by their cultivators.</p><p>“The demon race actually chose Tianwu Island as its target.  Even if it's the relatively weaker Wu tribe, could they really be aiming to attack the Canglang Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and taken aback.</p><p>The teleportation array between the two places is a closely guarded secret.</p><p>From Qin Sang's perspective, it didn't seem to be exactly the same as the ancient teleportation array he had used, but in today's cultivation world, cultivators couldn't possibly create such a large and complex teleportation array.</p><p>Such a teleportation array clearly couldn't be built just anywhere. Otherwise, with so many years passed, there wouldn't be only the Great Desolate Island and Tianwu Island.</p><p>The Wu tribe must have suffered countless casualties of experts in defending Tianwu Island.</p><p>The Yaozu raid on Tianwu Island failed.  Human forces are on high alert. Will they target Dahuang Island next?  Regardless of whether the Yaozu return, cultivators dare not relax; the sea will remain turbulent for some time.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the situation, subtly observing the others.  Their gazes were fixed on Dahuang Island, reflecting their deep apprehension about the uncertain future.</p><p>"Under the cover of the Great Demon Transformation, I'm less afraid of the beast tide, and being trapped in the Demon Sea isn't a major concern. But to reach my external avatar, I must return to Canglang Sea quickly; I can't stay here," Qin Sang thought. "I wonder what's happening on Dahuang Island. If they've forbidden departures to Canglang Sea to keep people guarding the island, that would be a problem!"</p><p>Having learned the situation, Qin Sang didn't delay. He immediately took his leave and sped towards Dahuang Island.</p><p>As he drew closer, he encountered more cultivators and gathered more detailed information, along with numerous harrowing tales.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang arrived near Dahuang Island.</p><p>Many islands surrounded Dahuang Island. Those with spirit veins had been developed as outposts, forming the first line of defense.</p><p>In the past, these outposts seemed ordinary, only patrolled by guards. But today, upon seeing one outpost from afar, Qin Sang sensed something amiss. The island's protective formation was active, and patrol units were constantly on guard, leaving no blind spots; the atmosphere was tense.</p><p>Qin Sang, cloaked, was spotted by a patrol immediately upon arrival.</p><p>Recognizing him as a cultivator, the guards relaxed slightly.  Their leader, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, addressed Qin Sang respectfully but firmly: "Senior, where do you come from? Do you intend to land on the island?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, saying: "I am headed to Dahuang Island to use the transmission array to return to Canglang Sea. I would appreciate your assistance."</p><p>The cultivator shook his head. "Senior, I cannot authorize your passage to Dahuang Island. Please come with me to the island; someone will arrange for you."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  Seeing no unusual reactions from the others, he nodded and followed them towards the outpost.</p><p>—</p><p>I'm back!</p><p>Still on my way back.</p><p>Just this chapter tonight; I'll try to catch up tomorrow.</p><p>Ten days have passed, it feels like a lifetime.  I have so many thoughts, I don't know where to begin.</p><p>The world is unpredictable, and human life is fragile. That much is obvious.</p><p>My biggest realization is that the more people you have in your family, the better. A larger family means more problems, but in times of crisis, they provide the greatest support.  Thanks to their help, many things were resolved smoothly.</p><p>I need to have more children.</p><p>Also, I must distinguish between fiction and reality.  Family love in reality is a truly precious bond.</p><p>Thank you to my readers for your patience during this long break. I'm back now.</p>
