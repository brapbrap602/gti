<h1>Chapter 173: Poisoned by a Corpse</h1><p>Chapter 173: Poisoned by a Corpse</p><p>In Baiyunshanren’s cosmosack, Qin Sang found an unexpected item, half the body of a tiger at the mid-Demon Spirit stage!</p><p>Before entering the underground cave, they had split into two groups. Senior Martial Sister Qingting led Baiyunshanren and the others in one direction, and they encountered a black tiger at the Demon Spirit stage, which they joined forces to kill. They did not expect that this Demon Spirit stage black tiger was actually at the mid-stage.</p><p>No wonder it had taken them so long.</p><p>In addition, there were also a variety of other miscellaneous items, which he put away.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had almost figured out the restriction on the heavy iron door. He sacrificed the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword to break the restriction and pushed open the heavy iron door with force.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there was only a stone path behind the heavy iron door, and it was unlike the previous winding path, but rather went straight down at an angle. There was a bend in front, but the end could not be seen.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the stone path was even denser than outside, only slightly weaker than Qin Sang’s cave.</p><p>It should be known that his cave was only a small stone chamber.</p><p>He didn’t know how much deeper he would have to go before he reached the core location of the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s branch, but such a large area was the same, and the spiritual energy at the core would definitely be even more astonishing. It was definitely a rare and precious cave, and there might even be a spiritual spring.</p><p>The stone path was deep, but Qin Sang’s speed was not slow. After mastering the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, he was no longer afraid of living corpses. There were a few bends along the way, and Qin Sang only found one stone chamber, which was also empty.</p><p>After traveling some distance like this, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and looked in front of him with a slightly dignified expression, listening attentively. Faintly, there were sounds of shock and growls coming from ahead.</p><p>Someone was fighting a vicious corpse!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately increased his speed. The further he went, the clearer the sounds became. The growls were indeed from a vicious corpse. It sounded like the battle was quite intense, but he couldn’t be sure how many people were there because he couldn’t hear any voices.</p><p>After walking for a while, Qin Sang suddenly stopped. His figure emerged from the shadows, and he frowned as he looked at the closed stone door in front of him.</p><p>No wonder the sound was so faint just now.</p><p>He had originally intended to sneak past and check the situation, but he had not expected the stone door to block his way. From the sound of it, the battle was taking place behind the stone door. Once he opened the stone door, he would be exposed as well.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not hesitate for long. He directly urged the Five Elements Law-Breaking Sword to blast open the stone door, and he saw that behind the stone door was indeed another hall, even more magnificent than the previous one, but the furnishings were largely the same.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the hall with his gaze and landed on the two sides that were engaged in a fierce battle. As expected, one of them was indeed a vicious corpse, and it was a living corpse. However, there was only Senior Martial Sister Qingting on the other side.</p><p>At this moment, Senior Martial Sister Qingting was sitting on the ground. Her expression was solemn as she controlled a green jade Ruyi. The jade Ruyi dragged a green light behind it as it flew out, forming a series of afterimages that attacked the living corpse repeatedly. To Qin Sang’s astonishment, the jade Ruyi was actually a talisman treasure.</p><p>And behind Senior Martial Sister Qingting, there was a corpse that had been corroded by corpse poison. It could be seen that it was Liu Jiang from the Liu brothers, which shocked Qin Sang greatly.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly appeared and blasted open the stone door, startling Qingting.</p><p>Seeing that it was Qin Sang who had come in, Qingting’s expression became anxious. Her voice was extremely weak as she repeatedly said, “Junior Martial Brother Qin, the vicious corpse is ferocious. I can’t hold on for much longer. You quickly break the restriction and leave!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang looked closely and saw the state that Senior Martial Sister Qingting was in. His heart sank.</p><p>Her chest and abdomen were completely stained with blood, and there were many claw marks left by a ghost. There were also a few crisscrossing knife wounds on her body, so deep that he could see her internal organs. He could even see that her internal organs had also been injured by the ghost claws, and her entire internal organs were in a mess.</p><p>The flesh at the wounds was wriggling. It was obvious that Qingting had already taken a healing pill, but it had no effect because there was a lingering Earth Fiend aura and corpse poison on the wound, preventing her injuries from healing. Furthermore, the corpse poison was like a maggot attached to a bone, constantly eroding her body.</p><p>Severely injured, Qingting’s aura was already extremely weak. She could only use all her strength to control the talisman treasure to resist the vicious corpse. She was powerless to suppress the corpse poison on her body, and her internal organs had already been stained a dark green by the corpse poison, making them horrifying to look at.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang did not hesitate to activate the Ebonywood Sword. The Ebonywood Sword roared out with sword qi and stabbed fiercely at the vicious corpse, helping Qingting share most of the pressure.</p><p>“Senior Martial Sister, quickly suppress the corpse poison and heal your injuries,” Qin Sang shouted. Then, he attacked the vicious corpse with all his might. The vicious corpse was attracted by Qin Sang and immediately turned to charge at him.</p><p>At this moment, the jade Ruyi transformed from the talisman treasure suddenly emitted a brilliant green light, trapping the vicious corpse firmly in place.</p><p>Qingting’s complexion turned even paler. She coughed violently and spat out several mouthfuls of blood. She urged in a bitter tone, “Junior Martial Brother Qin, don’t worry about me. The corpse poison has already invaded my heart meridian. There’s no saving me.</p><p>While I’m still able to motivate the Talisman to block the Evil Corpse, Junior Brother Qin, go and crack the prohibition on the door and escape! I will help you reseal the iron gate prohibition. This Evil Corpse not only has formidable strength comparable to a Mid Stage Foundation Establishment Period cultivator, he can also use magic spells. It will be difficult for Junior Brother Qin to resist alone. Hurry and go!</p><p>After a brief encounter, Qin Sang has figured out the details of the Evil Corpse’s origins; its strength was even stronger than what they had encountered before, and it can also use magic spells—but not the Profound Yellow Armor, but rather a magic spell that condenses True Qi into a knife. The other spell, however, was the same Evasion Art and very erratic and impossible to defend against. No wonder the injuries on Qing Ting are so serious.</p><p>Due to the Evil Corpse’s unique refining method, it can retain a single magic spell that the living corpse was most proficient in before becoming a corpse. At the same time, the refiner can also use the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to inject a magic spell he has mastered into the Evil Corpse.</p><p>So it’s likely that this strange Evasion Art is a secret technique passed down from the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>However, in Qin Sang’s eyes, this Evil Corpse is easier to deal with than the previous one.</p><p>The previous Evil Corpse carried the Profound Yellow Armor, like a turtle shell. After being besieged by the three of them for a long time, most of the Profound Yellow Armor on its body was broken, and only then could Qin Sang so easily eliminate it.</p><p>Without seeing the Heavenly Yin Corpse Formula personally and without being clear about the true function of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Bai Yunshan also didn’t dare to face the Evil Corpse at its peak alone, otherwise he wouldn’t have been acting the entire time and waited until the end to make a move.</p><p>This Evil Corpse’s offensive ability was stronger, but its defensive ability was much weaker. As long as it doesn’t get the chance to get close, killing it won’t be difficult. Qing Ting was probably suddenly sneak attacked by the Evil Corpse and wasn’t able to respond in time, so she was seriously injured, to the point that the entire situation couldn’t be turned around.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t choose to go and open the Black Iron heavy gate, as the Evil Corpse wasn’t a threat to him. This Qing Ting isn’t a person who harbors ulterior motives, so it would be best to save her.</p><p>“Senior Sister, don’t think too much. First, let’s kill this brute!” Qin Sang shouted softly.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword released powerful Sword Qi and, together with the Jade Ruyi, charged towards the Evil Corpse. At the same time, Qin Sang silently stimulated the Heavenly Corpse Talisman secret technique to affect the Evil Corpse, and sure enough, the Evil Corpse’s body movements became sluggish, and it took several sword strikes in a row, causing the Evil Qi on its body to become unstable.</p><p>When Qing Ting saw this, she took a deep breath and her spirits were greatly lifted. She said solemnly, “Good! To be able to avenge myself before I die, Senior Sister can die with peace of mind. Thank you, Junior Brother Qin, for your help!”</p>
