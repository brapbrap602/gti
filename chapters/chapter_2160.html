<h1>Chapter 2150: The Tai Xu Gold Script</h1><p>“When the True Man manifested his Dharma Body back then, the Thunder Seal technique he employed, I wonder if it can be activated through the Thunder Altar?”</p><p>Shaoshi inquired.</p><p>During the great battle against Lu Wang, the thunder talismans Qin Sang employed were mostly suited for large-scale army confrontations. Even among the Imperial Clan, the number of cultivators qualified to enter the Sacred Ground could be counted on one hand, leaving little room for these thunder talismans to be utilized.</p><p>Even if they managed to subdue a group of ferocious beasts within the Sacred Ground, it would be difficult to train them into a disciplined army within a short period.</p><p>“There are ferocious beasts within the Sacred Ground?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, unable to help but wonder if the Otherfolk’s Sacred Ground was a place similar to the Sea of Calamity in the Myriad Demons Realm.</p><p>Shaoshi chuckled softly, “Although I don’t know the exact location of the Sacred Ground, it only opens when the River of Misfortune recedes. There must be a myriad of connections. They should be beasts deliberately captured from the River of Misfortune by our predecessors and kept within the Sacred Ground.  Bear in mind, there are not only ferocious beasts, but also Great Beasts comparable to the Saint Realm! True Man Qin must be cautious upon entering the Sacred Ground. If you discover anything unusual, it's best to avoid it from afar.”</p><p>Spirit Severing stage ferocious beasts!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart chilled. Not only did he have to be wary of fellow cultivators of the same realm entering the Sacred Ground, but he also had to evade ferocious beasts. He wondered if the environment within the Sacred Ground was any different from the River of Misfortune, hoping that those beasts didn't know how to conceal their auras so that he could detect danger in advance.</p><p>Shaoshi had his eye on the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman. This talisman contained the secrets of the Five Thunders, but it was first and foremost a thunder talisman, and one of the most complex and profound third-order thunder talismans.  Qin Sang was not only capable of utilizing this talisman but also had complete control over it, and should be able to seal it within the Pearl of Lightning.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang activated the altar once more, utilizing the Thunder Altar to deploy the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman.</p><p>A Thunder Seal appeared in the sky.</p><p>The manifestation of the Thunder Seal was less imposing than the Oath of Thunder, but its power was undeniable.  At least among the third-order offensive thunder talismans recorded within the Five Thunders Court’s seal, none could surpass its power.</p><p>The surface of the Thunder Seal was enveloped by lightning, its might concealed yet palpable, as it slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang preemptively activated the Pearl of Lightning, transforming it into a silver sphere.</p><p>With the previous experience, Qin Sang handled this with ease.  The Thunder Seal merged into the sphere, and the resulting ripples were quickly controlled, ultimately settling firmly in place.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his divine sense into the Pearl of Lightning, focusing his perception. Because he had previously noticed a pulsating rhythm, he consciously searched for it this time. Finally, in the instant the Thunder Seal was about to be successfully sealed, he detected the fleeting pulse again, confirming that his previous perception wasn't an illusion.</p><p>The clouds dissipated, and the thunder subsided.</p><p>Qingyang Temple returned to tranquility.</p><p>The silver sphere contracted to its limit and reverted to the Pearl of Lightning, slowly falling into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The pearl's form remained unchanged, but the spiritual light it emitted was even more dazzling. Through that layer of spiritual light, one could see a miniature Thunder Seal amidst the densely packed lightning within the pearl – the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal.</p><p>The Thunder Seal was suspended in the center of the pearl, stable and ready to be unleashed with a mere thought from Qin Sang.</p><p>Shaoshi expressed his approval. Although they failed to seal the Oath of Thunder, sealing the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman was considered a success. He took out a sheet of gold paper and said, "True Man Qin, if you have no further requests, you can inscribe your Dharma Name on this and establish the pact with an oath."</p><p>"This is?"</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, seeing wisps of white light hovering on the surface of the gold paper, twisting and turning like mist within a sea of fog, transforming into all sorts of bizarre runes. Touching a rune with his divine sense would imprint words into his mind.</p><p>The content of these words was precisely the terms of the agreement he and Shaoshi had previously discussed, imposing constraints on the actions of both himself and the Si Huang's faction, terms that had been mutually agreed upon.</p><p>On one side of the gold paper was a crimson seal bearing the name of Si Huang.</p><p>Shaoshi explained, "This is the Tai Xu Gold Script. It is itself a rare treasure that various clans would fight over, its value immeasurable. The Imperial Clan has only collected three of these over the years. Once both parties inscribe their Dharma Names, the Gold Script will self-immolate, and the oath will be established. Thereafter, any party violating the oath will be punished, the effects of which will automatically dissipate after the matter is concluded."</p><p>"What kind of punishment is it?" Qin Sang scrutinized the words on the Gold Script but found no mention of the specific punishment.</p><p>"Those who betray their oaths will encounter misfortune. It is said to vary from person to person, unpredictable and unavoidable. The power of the Tai Xu Gold Script has been verified countless times. Moreover, this treasure originates from the Sacred Ground. If anyone intends to betray their allies, they must think thrice before acting. Compared to Karmic Oaths, the major tribes place more trust in the Tai Xu Gold Script at crucial moments."</p><p>Shaoshi spoke meaningfully, "No one can tamper with the Tai Xu Gold Script. True Man Qin, if you are concerned, you can send a message to the Zhu Yan Clan to inquire, but do not reveal our agreement."</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of trouble. He asked Shaoshi to stay for a few more days, sent out a talisman message, and quickly received a reply. The description of the Tai Xu Gold Script matched Shaoshi's words.</p><p>The Tai Xu Gold Script originated from the Sacred Ground, implying that the one who refined this treasure was at least a Spirit Severing stage expert. Qin Sang had no desire to test it personally.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Name could be fabricated. His real name, True Man Qin, or even Five Thunders Court Lord would suffice. The key was the wisp of aura imprinted into the Gold Script.</p><p>Qin Sang personally wrote the three characters 'True Man Qin.' As the last stroke fell, the Gold Script spontaneously ignited with golden flames, burning fiercely, leaving not a trace of ash behind.</p><p>Gazing at the golden flames, Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly. He faintly sensed an inexplicable qi entering his body, yet when he carefully searched for it, it was nowhere to be found.</p><p>With their names on the Tai Xu Gold Script, the two parties became allies, and Shaoshi's demeanor became even more cordial. "That Mirage Conch…"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately produced the Lu Clan's Mirage Conch.</p><p>Shaoshi pocketed it, delightedly saying, "I shall return to the clan and report this good news to Lord Si Huang. When the time comes, would True Man Qin like to join us at the Yuan Qiao Sea Market?"</p><p>"I've already agreed to go with Clan Leader Yuan Xiang. It's not too late to visit Lord Si Huang at the Yuan Qiao Sea Market," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Shaoshi nodded, "Very well! I shall take my leave then. True Man Qin, until we meet again!"</p><p>With that, Shaoshi departed Qingyang Temple, transforming into a rainbow and soaring away.</p><p>After Shaoshi left, Si Lu quietly arrived at the main hall.</p><p>"For this journey to the Sacred Ground, do you have anyone in mind?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Initially, Si Lu wanted to use helping Qin Sang enter the Sacred Ground as a bargaining chip to ask Qin Sang to avenge him.  In reality, he didn't understand that rule, and even now, as the Yan King, he couldn't accomplish it.</p><p>Qin Sang could also accompany Si Lu, effectively giving the Lu Clan's Mirage Conch entirely to Si Huang, who would undoubtedly offer more lenient terms.</p><p>However, as he gained some understanding of the Sacred Ground and with Ning Zhenren's entrustment, Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless, believing that the more allies, the better. Thus, he didn't occupy the Si Clan's slot, allowing Si Lu to bring an additional helper.</p><p>The price was that he had to do one thing for Si Huang. After weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang believed it was worthwhile; the Pearl of Lightning was an unexpected boon.</p><p>Unfortunately, it couldn't be someone from another clan, only someone from the Si You Clan, and Si Lu was precisely lacking top-tier experts.</p><p>"Shi Mu and the others are not yet trustworthy, and my aunt is not skilled in combat. Among my father's retainers, Grand Marshal has the highest cultivation and cultivates a powerful life-risking secret technique. Once fully unleashed, even mid-stage cultivators would have to retreat," Si Lu said.</p><p>The image of the frail old man flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The old man was already at the peak of the early stage, simply hindered by a bottleneck, unable to break through.</p><p>Among the previous Yan King's subordinates, aside from Xia Changshi, there might have been those whose cultivation surpassed the Grand Marshal, but the Grand Marshal's status was always second only to Xia Changshi. After the previous Yan King's fall and with Si Lu and Xia Changshi's whereabouts unknown, it was the Grand Marshal who rallied the Yan King's former subordinates, navigating the precarious situation between the Imperial Clan and the Lu Clan, steadfastly holding onto their foundation. His wisdom and strength were both proven.</p><p>"Good, it's him! After entering the Sacred Ground, I need to meet with Si Huang first, which might take some time. You can go about your own business first, and we'll agree on a meeting place later," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Si Lu said joyfully, "My father left guidance within the Mirage Conch. With Grand Marshal's assistance, I have hope of obtaining that opportunity!"</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally happy to see Si Lu obtain opportunities within the Sacred Ground and increase his strength. The stronger his allies were, the more stable Qingyang Temple's position in the Sea of Mists would be.</p><p>The two discussed the details, and Si Lu also bid farewell to Qin Sang.</p><p>After seeing both of them off, Qin Sang carefully reviewed everything once more, feeling that there were no oversights.  Next was to wait for the River of Misfortune to recede.</p><p>Taking out the Pearl of Lightning, Qin Sang toyed with it for a while before putting it away, rising and flying towards the fire chamber.</p><p>Within the fire chamber, the golden light was slightly dimmed.</p><p>The golden liquid within the eight golden figures was almost depleted. Qin Sang silently channeled the secret technique to replenish it, his divine sense sweeping over the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock. The Heaven Trapping Golden Lock's nascent spirit seemed increasingly dormant, reacting more gently to Qin Sang's probes than before.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged nearby, continuing to comprehend the sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Thirty years passed in a blink.</p><p>After decades of recuperation and development, Qingyang Temple was no longer shrouded in gloom.  The scars of war were almost erased by time, leaving only the wounds etched in people's hearts from the loss of loved ones, occasionally stinging with pain.</p><p>The Five Thunders Court was on the right track, with peace and stability prevailing. Stability brought prosperity, and all clans, sects, and rogue cultivators displayed signs of flourishing.</p><p>Cultivators within the Four Tranquil Regions had begun to leave Qingyang Temple, exploring the depths of the Stormy Sea. Some established branch estates for their sects, while others, carrying decrees from the Five Thunders Court, expanded the court's territory in exchange for merit.</p><p>At this time, Qingyang Temple had become a sacred ground in the eyes of all cultivators in Qingyang Temple, holding a transcendent status.</p><p>The small Daoist temple founded by Silent Heart Daoist had grown into a colossal entity, 'dominating a realm,' its territory even vaster than the several major regions of the original Stormy Realm. Qin Sang had not failed to live up to Cloud Wanderer's expectations!</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The rear mountain of the main peak had become another forbidden area of Qingyang Temple due to Qin Sang's cultivation there.</p><p>Ordinarily, only Li Yufu and a few others occasionally came to visit, mostly to inquire about cultivation matters. With internal and external troubles within Qingyang Temple quelled, trivial matters were handled by disciples, requiring no intervention from Qin Sang.</p><p>Warm sunlight spilled into the forest. Amidst the floating mist, Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath a tree.  A ball of golden light hovered before him – the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock!</p><p>Not long ago, the eight golden figures had exhausted their power and shattered completely, finally enabling Qin Sang to refine this treasure!</p><p>The spirit of the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock had submitted to Qin Sang, acknowledging him as its master. However, when Qin Sang wielded this treasure, he noticed a slight sluggishness.</p><p>This was a hidden flaw left by the secret technique, causing some damage to the spiritual treasure. This was unavoidable, and Qin Sang had anticipated it.</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionless, seemingly pondering something. After a while, his expression shifted slightly, and he struck out a hand seal.</p><p>The Heaven Trapping Golden Lock rose into the air, its golden light dispelling the mist, as if half of the main peak was draped in a glittering golden coat.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A crisp sound rang out.</p><p>The spiritual light on the surface of the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock flickered, and a peculiar wave spread out, subtly altering the surrounding golden light.</p><p>Bathed in the golden light, Qin Sang focused his senses, pondering silently.</p><p>After a long while, a look of realization dawned on his face. He opened his eyes and raised a hand, golden light flowing between his fingers like water.</p><p>"So this is the power of the Pseudo-Domain…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Perhaps even Grand Offering couldn't match Qin Sang's understanding of the Dharma Domain.</p><p>In his view, the Pseudo-Domain had a somewhat 'all that glitters is not gold' quality, imitating the Dharma Domain but possessing only its superficial form.</p><p>However, even so, it was a power many Soul Formation cultivators couldn't attain in their lifetime.</p><p>When Cloud Wanderer ascended during his tribulation, the sword strike Qin Sang unleashed could, to a certain extent, be considered a Pseudo-Domain Sword. However, that was created by Qin Sang integrating his own understanding.  What he had grasped was still very superficial and one-sided. Compared to the Pseudo-Domain comprehended by peak Soul Formation experts, his Pseudo-Domain Sword still had many shortcomings, such as only being applicable to sword techniques.</p><p>Those peak experts not only possessed an understanding of the Dharma Domain no less than Qin Sang but had also cultivated for many years, possessing unique methods of utilizing the Pseudo-Domain power. Qin Sang had just made some progress; what he lacked was time.</p><p>By comprehending the Pseudo-Domain power of the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock, Qin Sang gained some insights.  If he could integrate them thoroughly, his application of the Pseudo-Domain Sword would undoubtedly reach a higher level, enabling him to utilize it through the Gray Warbler Sword, though its power would certainly be inferior to the Cloud Wanderer Sword.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was very satisfied with the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock. This treasure's power lay in its 'trapping' ability, complementing his sword formation, allowing him to advance and retreat freely when facing formidable foes, adding another layer of assurance to his journey to the Sacred Ground.</p><p>After continuing his comprehension for a while, Qin Sang changed his hand seals, deploying the blood refinement secret technique from the *Chong Xuan Manual*.</p><p>Forcing a drop of blood essence out of his body, Qin Sang's ten fingers moved like a wheel, consecutively striking out complex hand seals. The drop of blood essence trembled slightly, separating into thin threads, forming a spiderweb-like blood net floating before him.</p><p>The blood threads forming the net were extremely fine, making one worry that a gentle breeze could break them.  Qin Sang continued without pause. Under the reinforcement of the hand seals, the blood threads became strikingly crimson, finally being guided by Qin Sang towards the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock.</p><p>The Heaven Trapping Golden Lock was completely enveloped by the blood net. The blood threads wriggled on its surface, slowly seeping into the lock's interior, a hint of eerie crimson flashing within the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a connection, as if a bloodline now linked him to the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock. The sluggishness he felt when wielding the treasure hadn't significantly changed, but as long as he persisted in using this secret technique, the hidden flaw would be minimized.</p><p>Putting away the Heaven Trapping Golden Lock, Qin Sang looked up towards the edge of the forest.  "Yufu, come in."</p><p>At the edge of the forest.</p><p>Li Yufu was waiting respectfully.  He had been there for a while, sensing that Qin Sang was cultivating and not wanting to disturb him.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yufu flashed into the forest, arriving before Qin Sang and presenting a talisman message.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior Uncle, this just arrived from the Zhu Yan Clan.  They request that Senior Uncle open it personally."</p>
