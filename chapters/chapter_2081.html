<h1>Chapter 2072: Remembrance</h1><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu returned to the main hall. Si Lu and Ji Hong looked up, and Shen Chen rose to greet them.  Earlier, Shen Chen, following Qin Sang's instructions, had revealed some information to Si Lu and Ji Hong. However, some things were difficult to conceal, and they would eventually figure it out.</p><p>“Now that we’re here, our agreement is fulfilled.  What are your plans, Daoist Si Lu?” Qin Sang sat opposite them.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Si Lu’s intentions, but he wouldn’t turn him away. This was Zhu Yan territory; even if Si Lu's identity were exposed, Si You wouldn't dare launch a large-scale attack.</p><p>The Yi Ren tribes co-exist in the Mist Sea, inevitably competing with each other, with the leading clans constantly wary of one another.</p><p>He still couldn't fully understand the Zhu Yan's intentions. Keeping Si Lu around might prove useful.</p><p>“You wouldn’t feel at ease if we just left, would you, Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Si Lu chuckled slyly, gazing out at the hall, his eyes distant.</p><p>Legend speaks of countless smaller worlds within the vast cosmos, constantly being created and destroyed.  A gateway could be anywhere – on your bedside table, amongst the blossoms of a tree – existing unnoticed until the world’s end, its inhabitants wiped out without a ripple.</p><p>They hadn't yet seen the full truth, failing to grasp that the Storm World had integrated into the greater cosmos. They only saw it as a single cultivator achieving transcendence, nourishing their world and leading others into the greater cosmos for cultivation in a broader realm – a common occurrence.</p><p>Alternatively, these people might have come from a collapsing smaller world, finding a gateway to escape before the end.</p><p>Regardless, humans couldn’t simply appear in the Mist Sea, and these individuals certainly have nothing to do with the Si You.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle…’</p><p>The disciples of the Green Goat Temple remained quietly in their chambers. The wind blew through a clump of purple bamboo outside the hall, and a few birds chirped; otherwise, it was silent, highlighting the temple's serene remoteness.</p><p>“This is such a peaceful place; I’d like to stay a while longer, if I may.”</p><p>“I would be honored,” Qin Sang glanced at Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Li Yu Fu understood, bowing. “A subsidiary temple, nestled deep in the mountains, abundant in spiritual energy, is located nearby. It’s used to host distinguished guests and is guarded by only a few disciples. It’s exceptionally quiet.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  “Later, at a suitable time, I’ll ask you to make a trip to bring Su Nu and the others back.”</p><p>Frequent short trips would arouse suspicion.</p><p>Si Lu readily agreed.</p><p>“And Daoist Ji Hong?” Qin Sang turned to Ji Hong.</p><p>“I need to help Daoist Si Lu avenge himself!”</p><p>Ji Hong tilted their small face upwards, then eagerly asked, “You surely have some unique and rare species here.  Perhaps some with potential to cultivate into superior spiritual plants? May I explore?”</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.  “As long as you share the cultivated spiritual plants with us, as per the agreement with the Jiao Jiao tribe and other clans, you’re free to come and go as you please. However, I won’t reveal your presence to others for now. No one has ever seen your kind before, so you should disguise yourself as a human cultivator.”</p><p>It wasn't concern for Ji Hong's safety; almost no one in the Storm World could defeat Ji Hong. Qin Sang was afraid that Ji Hong would cause upheaval and disrupt his plans.</p><p>Ji Hong's small face lit up, nodding repeatedly. “Daoist Qin, don't worry! I’ll be very careful!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Yu Fu had activated the Lu Ye Formation, quickly reaching the subsidiary temple.</p><p>After settling Si Lu and Ji Hong, Li Yu Fu left the Lu Ye Formation there and went out with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to visit Xiao Han Domain first; it was the ancestral seat of the Green Goat Temple and where he had started.  They then traveled to Xuan Yue Realm, Qin Sang summoning a gust of spiritual wind to carry them north.</p><p>The storm between Xiao Han Domain and the three northern seas had subsided, no longer isolating it.  In fact, the two areas were barely considered separate before Tian Yue Shang Ren erected his sword in the Northern Sea. There had been contact between top experts.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at a leisurely pace at high altitude, deliberately choosing a route closer to the outer sea, seeing how the Storm World's defenses extended to Xiao Han Domain, with all four northern seas facing the threat of the Chang You.</p><p>“The Storm World is like a wedge embedded in Chang You territory, surrounded on all sides except for the polluted land to the east. Fortunately, Chang You's forces are concentrated in the richer south, with the north being relatively weaker. Therefore, the initial attacks focused on the Central Plains, Cang Lang Sea, and Yao Sea. Otherwise, the four northern seas might have been lost,”</p><p>Li Yu Fu sighed, pointing to the outer sea. “The Chang You are continuously reinforcing the northern sea, attempting to repeat their past success.”</p><p>However, thanks to the teleportation array, reinforcements from the Central State could reach the North Sea at any time, preventing them from succeeding!”</p><p>Currently, the Storm Realm only consists of two major territories: the North Sea and the Central State.</p><p>After the storm subsided, cultivators in the Storm Realm discovered several suspected shelters, similar to the one Qin Sang passed by when leaving the North Sea.  These areas were small and insignificant compared to the major realms. Some had become uninhabitable wastelands; others housed only ordinary people and low-level cultivators, like scattered fragments.</p><p>These places are now abandoned.  Cultivators only hold onto the Central State and the North Sea, traveling between them via teleportation arrays.  This is because Changyou Tribe experts patrol between the two areas, making aerial travel even for Nascent Soul cultivators dangerous.</p><p>The defenses are well-organized. Unless the Changyou Tribe leader breaks through to the second stage of the Void Realm, it's impossible to defeat the Storm Realm cultivators in a short time. Qin Sang needn't reveal himself immediately; he has ample time for preparations.</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the edge of the Beichen territory.</p><p>The former Beichen Great Desert had vanished, replaced by lush forests and grasslands.  Moist, fresh air carried the scent of countless living creatures thriving in this fertile land.</p><p>Spiritual energy has recovered, causing drastic changes to the terrain and climate in many places.</p><p>Li Yu Fu spoke to Qin Sang about some old friends.</p><p>“Senior Lu unfortunately passed away, bequeathing all his possessions to Daoist Han Xi.  After Han Xi reached the Nascent Soul stage, he relocated his dojo to the Demon Realm.</p><p>“However, the current Demon Realm master is King Yu, the previous master having perished in a Heavenly Tribulation.  Legend says King Yu unearthed a divine herb during his ascension in the Ziwei Palace, aiding him in successfully overcoming the tribulation.  After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, King Yu took control of the Demon Realm and unified the North Sea demon tribes.</p><p>“Many demon tribes from the Xiaohan region followed King Yu, migrating to the Demon Realm. Those areas became unclaimed lands, so Senior Yu Nu connected the Qianshan Bamboo Sea and the Qingyang Temple.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, after Lu Boyuan's death, his spirit beast, Han Xi, achieved the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He hadn't interacted much with King Yu, unsure if the demon's temperament had changed.  If the demon remained unruly, it wouldn't be a problem; he could simply entrust the North Sea demon tribes to Yu Nu or Han Xi.  Besides, he still had two Demon Marquis in his possession.</p><p>As for the human race in the North Sea, the Xuantian Palace dominates and has deep ties with him. As long as the Xuantian Palace cooperates, the rest is insignificant.</p><p>The Central State requires closer attention.  The intricate relationships between various races and sects need careful consideration.</p><p>Li Yu Fu pointed towards the Eastern Abyss, “Immortaless Qiu Zhi is exceptionally talented.  Even without the Azure Spirit Qi, she was one of the most promising candidates to break through to the Nascent Soul stage.”</p><p>As they spoke, they reached the Tianxing Plateau.</p><p>“Sadly, True Daoist's two disciples, both possessing exceptional talent and temperament, were hindered by flaws in their dual cultivation technique. They reached the late Nascent Soul stage but couldn't progress further, ultimately dying in despair. The Tianxing Alliance, with its internal conflicts, soon disintegrated…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu continued his narrative, unknowingly reaching the Qianshan Bamboo Sea. He produced the Abbot's decree, flashed it, and traversed the formation with Qin Sang, unnoticed by the guarding demon soldiers.</p><p>Entering the Qianshan Bamboo Sea, they heard a languid voice, “Why is the Abbot back? Is the Changyou Tribe planning something big? Uh…”</p><p>The voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>The next moment, a pretty figure appeared before Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu.  Dressed in a simple white dress, without makeup, she had a round face, round eyes, and a round little mouth, her only sharp feature being her pointed ears.  Her mouth hung open in surprise as she stared at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Daoist Yu Nu, long time no see,” Qin Sang greeted with a smile and a bow.</p><p>“Qin…”</p><p>Yu Nu, surprised and delighted, stammered, gasped, and then performed a respectful curtsy, "Yu Nu greets Master Qin."</p><p>…</p><p>The three strolled in the clouds, flying slowly eastward.</p><p>Separated for a thousand years, reminiscing about the past and their missing friends, Qin Sang and Yu Nu both sighed, the mood turning somber.</p><p>The Qianshan Bamboo Sea, the Qingyang Temple, and the surrounding areas are now considered Yu Nu’s domain. Qingyang Temple disciples and the demon cultivators of Qianshan Bamboo Sea, upon reaching a certain level of cultivation, can choose a scenic place to establish their own cave dwellings without fear of disturbance.</p><p>The Qingyang Temple ancestral temple, Cui Ping Mountain, and the former Great Sui Kingdom, are located here.</p><p>They headed straight for Cui Ping Mountain. Disciples who contributed to the Qingyang Temple are buried in the mountains behind the temple and are venerated by future generations, including the tombs of Tan Hao and others.</p><p>Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang offered three sticks of incense, gazing at the memorial tablets above. Among them were Jixin Daoist, Mingyue, Yunyouzi, and his own.</p><p>The disciples of Qingyang Temple believed that he was gone, and that Yunyouzi had no hope of returning.  More than a thousand years later, Qin Sang still remembered those days at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>After paying his respects, Yu Nu asked, “Will Senior Bamboo Demon return?”</p><p>Li Yufu looked nervous; he’d wanted to ask but hadn't dared.</p><p>“He will!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded emphatically.</p><p>Yu Nu and Li Yufu had unwavering faith in Qin Sang, and both broke into happy smiles.</p><p>Then Li Yufu remembered something else.  “There’s something else I must report to Master Uncle. In recent years, strange things have been happening in various places.  In city god temples and other shrines, clay and wooden statues used in worship have suddenly come to life, giving birth to deities.  Inquiries revealed that these are the spirits of the deceased who have returned, becoming gods in a confused state. Because of the Changyou tribe, we haven't decided how to handle them. Since these deities are deeply connected to the mortal world and don't currently threaten the cultivation world’s order, and since they help maintain order among the mortals, we’ve let them be for now.”</p><p>He left one thing unsaid: since the frequent appearance of these deities, some worried that the sacred images, enjoying the offerings of a world, might become possessed by something and give birth to something extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang had sensed the presence of several deities on his journey.  The Storm World had no gods before; after its return to the Greater Thousand Worlds, deities have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain.  Something is clearly amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t explain it, attributing it to the Storm World’s unique nature. He had a theory: could it be that the lower world's Heavenly Dao is incomplete, and the Storm World is missing the divine path?</p><p>Li Yufu paused, seeing Qin Sang silent, and continued, “People once built a family shrine to commemorate Master and Grandmaster, and it has been continuously venerated. Is it possible that Grandmaster and Master…”</p><p>His voice held a tremor of excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang understood his hopes, but believed Jixin Dao Ren and Mingyue’s return was unlikely. If the divine path existed, given Jixin Dao Ren and Mingyue’s merits, they would certainly have been accepted into it.  But they have been dead for over a thousand years; their souls should have dissipated.</p><p>If they could return, it would prove that everyone possesses a unique mark in this world, one that isn't erased after death.  Reincarnation might not just be a legend!</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang heard that the divine path was most prosperous in Zhenzhou, in the southeast of the Eight Great Heavenly States, while it was suppressed elsewhere.  Having traveled through three states, he had never seen a well-established divine path cultivator. If it weren't for the news from the Storm World, he might have gone himself.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang went to the tombs of Tan Hao and others to pay his respects, then left Cui Ping Mountain alone.</p><p>Looking down from the sky, the old Three Witches City had undergone several cycles of rise and fall, no longer resembling its former self. The great river had swollen, and the new city was far from the old site. The old bun shop was gone; he wondered if the family had left descendants.</p><p>He continued north, finally arriving atop a mountain peak.</p><p>Mount Chao Sheng!</p><p>Carefully preserved by Qingyang Temple, Mount Chao Sheng remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, a flask of wine in hand.  He followed a path for some time, until a stele, unmarked, appeared before him.</p><p>Even with the best preservation, the stone stele, weathered by a thousand years, bore the marks of time.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, silently observing for a moment before reaching the tomb, placing the flask down, and murmuring, "I'm late this time…"</p><p>He carefully brushed away the dust, sat before the tomb, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Unknowingly, over a thousand years had passed. At that time, he never imagined that after making that choice, he would endure so many hardships and experiences.</p><p>The sky was dusky, seemingly no different from then, yet it was not the same sky. Remembering the oaths of that time, he had broken through the heavens, reaching the “sky”, yet he hadn’t seen any immortals.  The road ahead is long and arduous.</p><p>Fortunately, the East Yang County Princess is with him under the same sky, and will continue to witness him fulfill those vows.</p><p>After sitting for a long time, Qin Sang stood, raised a toast to the East Yang County Princess, and poured the fine spirit wine before the tomb.</p><p>There were no words of remembrance, no grand pronouncements.  He simply said, “I’m going now!”</p><p>Then he waved casually, as if bidding farewell to an old friend.</p><p>His back was swallowed by the night.</p><p>The moon was hazy, the shadows of trees danced on the stele.
