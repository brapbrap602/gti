<h1></h1><p>Shouchen Island.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet was in control of the communication treasure.</p><p>During this period, Master Feng occasionally sent messages, informing Qin Sang of the recent changes in the situation. Apart from this, nothing major had happened.</p><p>The demon unrest had not yet spread here.</p><p>The cultivators on Shouchen Island did not dare to disturb him.</p><p>Therefore, the Nascent Soul Puppet's identity had not been exposed yet.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating on another island reef, completely oblivious to events outside the island.</p><p>The communication treasure vibrated.</p><p>This time, the content was different from usual.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet stood up straight, and escaped Shouchen Island. Qin Sang had already sensed it in advance, waiting outside the island.</p><p>"The demon kings are appearing in the western sea, there's something strange?"</p><p>Qin Sang saw the vague content in the message, and was completely bewildered.</p><p>"Could it be that Bifang doesn't want to attack the human race, but has other intentions?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The message told him to rush over to rendezvous alone, and not to mobilize the defensive line, lest the demon race was feinting to the east while attacking in the west. .</p><p>According to his agreement with Master Feng, he couldn't refuse this.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Nascent Soul Puppet standing quietly beside him, hesitated for a moment, then kept it away. He immediately transformed into a bolt of lightning, and headed northwest.</p><p>Lightning flashed across the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use his full strength, trying to maintain his best condition.</p><p>He had already made up his mind.</p><p>If he encountered a demon king and was caught in a melee, if he had the opportunity to face Bifang alone, he could entangle him for a while, but if he was besieged, he would never act rashly.</p><p>Master Feng sent messages frequently.</p><p>Just as he was about to rendezvous, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and released the Nascent Soul Puppet again.</p><p>With the divine soul imprint remotely sensing it, he didn't need to worry about the Nascent Soul Puppet getting lost.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet jumped into the sea, lurking beneath the surface, motionless.</p><p>After Qin Sang left and his escaping light disappeared into the sky, the Nascent Soul Puppet silently followed, trailing far behind.</p><p>Killing demons was not the primary purpose of this trip, so Qin Sang used the same trick again, releasing the Nascent Soul Puppet in advance as a backup, to prevent any unexpected changes.</p><p>After continuing to fly for a while, Qin Sang saw a treasure ship that looked like a flying shuttle in the distance, speeding across the sea at an extremely fast pace.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, quickly get on board!"</p><p>Master Feng's voice came.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, then reined in his escaping light and jumped onto the treasure ship, seeing that Master Feng and the other three Nascent Souls were already there.</p><p>The treasure ship could barely accommodate four people, but after Qin Sang boarded, it grew a bit larger.</p><p>Qin Sang landed.</p><p>The ship's momentum remained stable, and its speed didn't decrease at all.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the treasure ship, and a look of wonder flashed in his eyes. He praised, "What a treasure!"</p><p>Master Feng said with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Shen's Ocean-Riding Boat is a treasure passed down through generations. Although its speed isn't as fast as your Lightning Escape technique, it can not only carry people, but also consumes less energy. As far as I know, in the entire Crescent Moon Realm, there's no similar treasure that can compare to the Ocean-Riding Boat. I estimate that only behemoths like the Profound Heaven Palace might have better treasures in their collection."</p><p>Island Master Shen controlled the boat while humbly saying, "Fellow Daoist Feng is exaggerating. The North Sea is vast and boundless, with countless strange people and treasures. Shen's meager possessions are not worth mentioning."</p><p>Master Feng laughed heartily, then said seriously, "Fellow Daoists quickly adjust your breathing and recover. There may be a fierce battle ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the calm sea around him and frowned slightly, "Is it a decisive battle already? Why don't I see the armies of the two races?"</p><p>Master Feng explained, "Those demon kings are acting mysteriously, and may be plotting some kind of conspiracy. I've already ordered the nearby armies to move out, and they'll arrive soon."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and sat down cross-legged casually.</p><p>He seemed to be recovering his true essence, but in reality he was sensing the location of the Nascent Soul Puppet.</p><p>Master Feng and the others exchanged glances, thinking they had succeeded in their plan, but none of them noticed that there was a Nascent Soul-level puppet trailing far behind.</p><p>The Ocean-Riding Boat cut through the waves, speeding towards the northwest.</p><p>The area ahead became increasingly desolate, and island reefs became more and more rare.</p><p>Looking at the direction the Ocean-Riding Boat was heading, it was getting closer and closer to the storm zone.</p><p>He didn't know how far they had traveled.</p><p>Master Feng, who was sitting quietly on the Ocean-Riding Boat, suddenly woke up, flew into the air, and looked north with an extremely solemn expression.</p><p>It was the middle of the night.</p><p>The moon was bright and the stars were sparse.</p><p>Within his field of vision, there were only slight ripples and the sea was unusually calm.</p><p>With the naked eye, he couldn't see anything unusual in the north.</p><p>But Nascent Soul cultivators could clearly sense that there were several powerful auras flying in the northern sky, seemingly heading in the same direction as them.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others also noticed those auras, and flew to Master Feng's side, with different expressions on their faces.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson light suddenly appeared on the horizon.</p><p>The Eagle Demon and the Frog-Fish then appeared.</p><p>Obviously, Bifang and the other demons had also noticed their movements.</p><p>"Ocean-Riding Boat! Why did Feng Laogui find us so quickly?"</p><p>Bifang turned his head and stared at the Rainbow Rat on the Eagle Demon's back, questioning him in a cold voice.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat was exasperated and cursed, "He dared to steal my master's essence blood! We'll stop them. The Profound Heaven Palace traitor is hiding in front! Hurry!"</p><p>Bifang snorted, withdrew his gaze, and flapped his wings with force, his speed soaring, like a streak of scarlet lightning.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>When Master Feng saw this scene, he realized that the worst-case scenario he had imagined had still happened. The two sides had encountered each other halfway.</p><p>Fortunately, he had called Fellow Daoist Mingyue along, otherwise they might not have been Bifang's match.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, leave that Bifang to you! We'll deal with the other demon kings!"</p><p>Without waiting for Qin Sang to say anything, Master Feng's body flashed with green light, and he transformed into green smoke and left.</p><p>Madam Yue and the others also used their own means. For a time, various escaping lights reflected each other, completely tearing apart the tranquility of this sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate for too long either, and broke through the air with Lightning Escape.</p><p>As he flew, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. These guys' actions were a bit strange. He didn't know what was ahead, but it made the powerhouses of both races fight over it like hungry tigers.</p><p>He had been right to release the Nascent Soul Puppet in advance.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He already had a plan in mind. He snorted coldly, didn't openly violate his agreement with Master Feng, pretended not to know, and went straight to chase Bifang, shouting loudly, "Fellow Daoist, please wait! Old friends are reunited, why not stop and chat?"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Bifang recognized the Lightning Escape and was greatly shocked and angry.</p><p>He had known long ago that letting this person go would definitely become a hidden danger, but he didn't expect it to come true so quickly, and at such a critical moment!</p><p>In a weakened state, he was able to escape from the three of them. It was difficult to estimate this person's strength at his peak.</p><p>Feng Laogui was already difficult to deal with, and now they had another strong helper.</p><p>Bifang felt a sense of unease.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Thunder rumbled through the sky.</p><p>A thick bolt of lightning descended from the sky, taking the lead in igniting the flames of war, and unceremoniously struck Bifang.</p><p>Without saying a word, Qin Sang extended his fingers and pointed, directly using the *Art of Commanding Lightning* to clear the way.</p><p>Bifang was shrouded in terrifying pressure, and only felt a violent force descending. The fleshy tumor on his head was about to explode.</p><p>They had experienced the power of the *Art of Commanding Lightning* before. Cunning Fox had almost been struck to death by a bolt of lightning. How could Bifang dare to be negligent? He hurriedly flapped his wings, and his figure suddenly tilted, spitting out a mouthful of blood light to block the lightning for a moment, narrowly avoiding it.</p>
