<h1>Chapter 1242: The Final Encounter</h1><p>In the Northern Star Realm, Buddhism was not flourishing, with only a few minor sects scattered across the deserts. However, ancient Buddhist relics had been unearthed in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman from the Upper Pure Palace and the "Stone Bridge Zen" scripture that Dongyang Bo had once produced were both obtained from such discoveries.</p><p>When the Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman was shattered, Gongliang Yu realized that this old fox had already thoroughly understood his trump cards, calculating every move in advance. Being schemed against to such an extent by a venerable Nascent Soul Patriarch, Gongliang Yu suddenly felt a bizarre sense of honor.</p><p>The Thousand Bodies and Myriad Shadows Talisman was his strongest means of escape. With the talisman rendered useless, Gongliang Yu knew that he was doomed today. As expected, unwilling to accept death, he attempted to use other methods, but before he could even activate them, Dongyang Bo had already prepared countermeasures. He didn’t even have time to deploy them.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A defensive treasure was effortlessly knocked away by Dongyang Bo. Gongliang Yu, now at his wit's end, watched in despair as the Diamond Ring descended upon him from above. He felt a binding force tightly wrap around him, his bones cracking under the pressure, excruciating pain coursing through his body. His physical form and the Golden Core within were both firmly trapped, leaving him unable to even self-destruct.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Diamond Ring erupted with a blinding white light, transforming into endless flames that completely enveloped Gongliang Yu. In an instant, his protective spiritual energy was shattered, and without even a scream, he was reduced to ashes. Dongyang Bo, who had meticulously planned this for years, harbored no hesitation. Once he made his move, it was swift and decisive, leaving Gongliang Yu no chance to catch his breath.</p><p>As for the method to control the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, Dongyang Bo had already obtained it, so there was no need to keep Gongliang Yu alive. Moreover, when he had taken the Blood-Boiling Evil Flower earlier, he had noticed that this place was fraught with hidden dangers. It was best not to cause too much commotion. Gongliang Yu’s death in the Blood Lake would leave no trace for anyone to follow.</p><p>With the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet in his possession, the Upper Pure Palace would inevitably become even more reliant on Mount Shaohua. This was a double victory. Though the process seemed lengthy, from Dongyang Bo’s appearance to trapping the puppet and killing Gongliang Yu, it all happened in the blink of an eye, swiftly ending Gongliang Yu’s life.</p><p>With Gongliang Yu dead, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet lost its master and became uncontrollable. Sensing an opportunity for freedom, it began to frantically attack the formation and the jade bottle. However, without guidance, its attacks, though fierce, were largely ineffective.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, about to retract the flames and use the Diamond Ring to restrain the puppet, suddenly felt a sharp sense of danger.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A sword beam pierced through the blood mist, swift as lightning, reducing all blood shadows in its path to dust. Its momentum was terrifying as it aimed straight for Dongyang Bo’s back. The moment the spiritual sword approached, Dongyang Bo felt a stabbing pain and his expression changed drastically. There was a third person here! Moreover, the sword’s aura was extraordinary—this person was also a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Without time to think, Dongyang Bo lunged forward, hastily recalling the Diamond Ring. A crisp sound rang out as the ring trembled violently, projecting a shadow of itself with power comparable to its true form. The shadow flashed and intercepted the flying sword.</p><p>The Sin Abyss had once used the Endless Blood Mulberry Formation to ambush him. Dongyang Bo had also suffered from the Blood Filth Divine Light in the past. Learning from his mistakes, he now always left some leeway when using his life-bound treasures, no longer relying solely on brute force.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A metallic clang echoed as the ring’s shadow blocked the flying sword. The treasure’s light contracted inward, attempting to repeat its previous tactic of ensnaring the sword and seizing it. At the start of the battle, Dongyang Bo had used the Diamond Ring to forcibly take several treasures from Sin Abyss cultivators, a tactic that had never failed him.</p><p>However, this time, he miscalculated. The ring’s shadow barely managed to encase the tip of the sword before it could go no further. The shadow buzzed and cracked, showing signs of shattering. Dongyang Bo was inwardly shocked. The Diamond Ring had been meticulously refined by him over the years, and even the life-bound treasures of the Nether Demon Lord might not surpass it. Yet, his opponent’s flying sword seemed to outmatch the Diamond Ring—it was a top-tier supreme treasure.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The blood mist howled as a figure followed closely behind the sword beam, rushing forward with cold, gleaming eyes behind a mask. It was Qin Sang. His face was grim.</p><p>Fearing detection by Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang had deliberately kept his distance. He had assumed that Gongliang Yu, as the leader of a sect, would surely have numerous escape methods, and with the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet by his side, he could at least hold out for a few moves against Dongyang Bo, giving Qin Sang enough time to intervene.</p><p>Who could have expected that Gongliang Yu would fall in a single move, becoming a victim of the Diamond Ring in the blink of an eye? Qin Sang also hadn’t anticipated that Dongyang Bo’s true goal wasn’t the treasures in the Blood River but Gongliang Yu and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.</p><p>A mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator scheming against a mere Golden Core junior—Qin Sang hadn’t even had a chance to intervene. The Demon Banner Formation was too slow, and the Thunder Summoning Technique required incantations. Without hesitation, Qin Sang decided to reveal himself, using his fastest weapon, the Ebony Wood Sword, to strike at Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t save Gongliang Yu, he couldn’t let Dongyang Bo take the puppet. Qin Sang had hidden his identity not out of fear of Dongyang Bo but because he wanted to wait until he was strong enough, fully prepared, to strike unexpectedly and secure victory.</p><p>Now, he could no longer remain hidden. Qin Sang didn’t fully understand the puppet’s flaws, but he knew he couldn’t let such a powerful puppet fall into Dongyang Bo’s hands. Otherwise, even with allies, killing him would be impossible. Qin Sang, ever decisive, immediately attacked with his sword.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, a seasoned veteran, reacted swiftly. Not only did he block the flying sword’s sneak attack, but he also inadvertently avoided repeating past mistakes.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Dongyang Bo’s expression changed twice, each time exclaiming the same words. The first exclamation was upon seeing the phoenix wings behind Qin Sang, recognizing him as the recently famous Moonlight Demon King. After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang had always worn a mask when traveling, with the phoenix wings being his most distinctive feature.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had heard many rumors about the Moonlight Demon King: slaying Nascent Soul cultivators, battling the Old Demon Ye in the Abyss Ruins, and emerging unscathed. Even the news of this Blood Lake expedition had been brought back by him. The Two Realms Alliance was delighted to have such a powerful ally.</p><p>However, some had expressed concerns. With such a rising star among the demons, it could be a sign of their resurgence, potentially overshadowing humanity in the future. But with the Sin Abyss being the immediate threat, and the demons lacking a solid foundation, the matter had been set aside.</p><p>The second exclamation came when Dongyang Bo saw the Ebony Wood Sword. He had once studied the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," but believing the technique to be incomplete and offering little future potential, he hadn’t pursued it seriously. However, he still had a deep impression of the technique.</p><p>Over the years, only two people had achieved success with this technique. One was a former disciple who stubbornly insisted on forging a metal-attribute spiritual sword, refusing to change techniques and determined to forge his own path. Dongyang Bo had deemed him hopeless for reaching Nascent Soul.</p><p>The other was a pawn who had once escaped his schemes, having forged a wood-attribute spiritual sword and achieved Golden Core many years ago. Now, that person stood before him once more.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword was no longer what it once was, but it was enough to confirm the identity of the newcomer!</p>
