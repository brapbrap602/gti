<h1>Chapter 1485: Fellow Travelers</h1><p>The Ice Demon Crystal’s interior displayed intricate, clear patterns forming a magnified snowflake, flawlessly beautiful and without a hint of disorder.</p><p>Upon opening the ice casket, everyone immediately felt an intense chill.</p><p>Those closest to the Grand Elder instinctively recoiled, leaving a large empty space around him.</p><p>Even Yuan Ying cultivators reacted this way.</p><p>The lower-level disciples participating in the Sacred Land for the first time gazed at this sacred object with awe, hastily activating their protective True Essence for reassurance.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qin Sang's eyes.  The moment he saw the Ice Demon Crystal, he felt an inexplicable pressure, faint yet real.</p><p>The Ice Demon Crystal was clearly an inanimate object.</p><p>Removed from the Ice Demon's body for an unknown number of years, it still possessed this ability.  The Ice Demon must have been incredibly powerful in life.</p><p>Tong Lingyu closed the ice casket. True Essence surged from her palm, branching into delicate threads, weaving a miraculous pattern that she slowly imprinted onto the Ice Demon Crystal.</p><p>This pattern perfectly matched the crystal's internal纹理, seamlessly integrating with it.</p><p>Simultaneously, Tong Lingyu's lips moved silently, communicating wordlessly with the Palace Master.</p><p>The cultivators held their breath, their gazes fixed on the Ice Demon Crystal and the Grand Elder.</p><p>As Tong Lingyu worked, the Ice Demon Crystal began to shine, radiating light from within, flickering erratically, indicating unstable energy.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's movements grew faster, blurring to the eye.</p><p>Finally, the Ice Demon Crystal's original form became invisible, transforming into a dazzling star that slowly rose from Tong Lingyu's palm.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, following the Ice Demon Crystal's ascent.</p><p>He was surprised to find the Sacred Land wasn't hidden beneath the sea.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The palanquin's tassels swayed as a blue beam shot out, striking the Ice Demon Crystal directly.</p><p>A loud ‘bang’ echoed as the Ice Demon Crystal's ascent halted.  A supremely intense, deep blue light erupted in mid-air, like a firework display!</p><p>Astonishing energy surged outwards.</p><p>Even the surrounding hurricane seemed frozen in place.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly shifted his gaze from the Ice Demon Crystal to the sky above.</p><p>The moment the crystal exploded, a previously unseen, peculiar wave spread through the void.</p><p>Initially, only Yuan Ying cultivators could detect it.</p><p>Gradually, the disciples' attention was also drawn.</p><p>The anomaly arrived, eliciting gasps of astonishment.</p><p>Centered on the Ice Demon Crystal, a visible black line spread from the void.  The void then cracked along the line, like a gaping black maw swallowing the crystal!</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The hurricane raged violently.  Even the Yuan Ying cultivators struggled to protect their juniors.</p><p>Upon contact with the fissure, the terrifying winds were directly absorbed without a ripple.</p><p>The scene resembled a massive spatial rift.</p><p>However, there were no spatial currents.  The fissure was filled with thick, dark clouds, obscuring the interior.</p><p>The fissure pierced the hurricane belt; their location marked only a small section of it.</p><p>The hurricane was everywhere, obstructing visibility, concealing the fissure's extent.</p><p>The fissure grew larger, while the Ice Demon Crystal's light gradually dimmed, finally losing its power.  The Grand Elder stored it back in the ice casket, resealing it.</p><p>Now, above them, the dark clouds within the fissure thinned slightly, revealing glimpses of magnificent mountain ranges – the Sacred Land, and this was the entrance.</p><p>The sight of the Sacred Land caused a commotion; anticipation filled the faces of the crowd.</p><p>At that moment, the Chongming bird cried out and pulled the palanquin back, clearing a path.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, mentally questioning Jiang Dianzhu, “The Palace Master isn't entering the Sacred Land?”</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu nodded, explaining, “It was the same in the previous two attempts.  The Palace Master's cultivation is unparalleled; there are no treasures left in the Sacred Land to attract him.”</p><p>As they spoke, the dark clouds in the fissure shifted, thinning in the center.</p><p>Tong Lingyu seized the opportunity, leading the crowd towards the fissure.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli walked side-by-side, having already awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly to observe the Sacred Land through the clouds.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Qin Sang felt a stir in his dantian. The shard of the Killing Sword within vibrated for the first time. His eyes froze for a moment before returning to normal, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p>His heart, however, was filled with overwhelming joy.</p><p>After a long slumber, the dormant sword spirit finally reacted, transmitting a yearning thought.</p><p>The sacred grounds of Xuan Tian Palace truly contain fragments of the Killing Sword!</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his excitement, focusing his mind on his dantian. He discovered that the Killing Sword fragment vibrated only once before falling silent again.</p><p>The sword spirit's thought was simple and urgent, lacking precise information; it only indicated a general direction.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the immense effort the sword spirit exerted in transmitting this thought, revealing the slow and arduous nature of its recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang would have to explore on his own.  He wondered if the sword spirit would recover enough to offer further guidance later.</p><p>His thoughts raced.</p><p>Qin Sang drew closer to the fissure.</p><p>His expression remained calm as he silently activated his celestial vision, gazing into the depths of the dark clouds!</p><p>…</p><p>Just before the opening of the sacred grounds.</p><p>In an unknown sea area, a black dragon treasure ship lay at anchor.</p><p>This immense vessel, a rare sight in the world, was moored at the edge of a hurricane belt. Compared to the sky-obscuring hurricane curtain, the ship appeared minuscule and fragile.</p><p>Powerful auras emanated from the ship, deliberately concealed.  It was unimaginable that so many Yuan Ying-level masters were gathered on a single vessel.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Huge waves crashed against the black dragon treasure ship.</p><p>The ship remained motionless, seemingly awaiting something.</p><p>At the bow.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren stood with his hands behind his back, gazing intently at the storm belt, his eyes deep and thoughtful.</p><p>At this moment, his senior disciple approached, standing behind Hun Mo Lao Ren, bowing respectfully.  "Master, there was almost another disturbance within."</p><p>"Those demon kings again?"</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren continued to watch the storm belt, his expression serene.</p><p>His disciple nodded, indignant.  "The Great Saint Tian Peng is clearly condoning their behavior; those demon kings are becoming increasingly arrogant!"</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren chuckled. "The two races have always been at odds, bound by a bloody feud. Peaceful coexistence would be a truly remarkable event.  The Great Saint Tian Peng's willingness to cooperate with me is solely due to the Xuan Tian Palace sacred grounds."</p><p>With that, Hun Mo Lao Ren took out a jade slip and tossed it to his disciple.</p><p>"This contains information I've gathered about the numerous treasure locations within the Xuan Tian Palace sacred grounds. The time is almost upon us.  It's safe to inform Yu Yi Yuan Jun and the others now; advise them to exercise patience.  Whether they can snatch treasure from the tiger's mouth before Xuan Tian Palace remains to be seen. It's up to their own abilities."</p>
