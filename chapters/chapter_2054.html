<h1>Chapter 2045: Postnatal Spiritual Treasure</h1><p>Qin Sang stepped into the grand hall, immediately drawing the attention of several gazes.  He swept his eyes around, noting five individuals seated within.</p><p>The seat of honor remained empty. To the left of it sat a short, elderly man, his feet dangling above the ground. His soles were remarkably large. Beside him rested a purplewood staff topped with a dragon's head, carved with lifelike detail, the staff itself twice his height.</p><p>Seated below the elder were two women, a beautiful matron and a young maiden. Their features bore a striking resemblance, suggesting a blood relation, perhaps mother and daughter.</p><p>To the right of the empty seat sat a man in black robes, his eyes slightly closed as if in meditation. He opened them only to glance at Qin Sang upon his entrance, before promptly closing them again.</p><p>The last person present was rather peculiar.  A two-headed individual, with two heads resting upon their shoulders.  Their facial features were nearly identical, yet one head bore long hair, styled in a celestial bun, adorned in feminine attire, while the other sported a short beard, projecting a distinctly different aura.</p><p>This strange figure was so eye-catching that Qin Sang couldn't help but steal a second glance. Rumors spoke of the myriad bizarre appearances of the 異人族 (Yi Ren Zu, Variant Human Tribe), some bearing no demonic traits, resembling instead the birth defects of humankind, such as being small as a mouse, having unusually long limbs, or ears that stretched past the top of their heads, and so forth.</p><p>This person, however, didn't seem to be of the Variant Human Tribe.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>Meeting Qin Sang’s gaze, the male head of the strange figure let out a strange laugh.  "No matter the cultivation level of a fellow Daoist, they always express surprise upon seeing us siblings."</p><p>The female head merely cast a cold glance at Qin Sang, clearly possessing a different temperament.</p><p>Realist Luohua introduced, “These are Fellow Daoists Chiyuan and Biyuan. They, too, have been invited by our sect to lend their aid. These two Fellow Daoists were conjoined twins in the womb, sharing a single body.”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. He knew of numerous cultivation techniques and secret arts created specifically for twins.  It was said that twins shared a connection, supporting each other on the path of cultivation, achieving twice the results with half the effort.</p><p>Conjoined twin Void Refinement cultivators were truly a first for him.</p><p>Even more peculiar was that the strange figure referred to themselves as siblings, yet Qin Sang didn't sense two distinct auras. Could it be that their two consciousnesses were actually one?</p><p>This matter delved into the other party's secrets, so Qin Sang refrained from inquiring further, cupping his hands and saying, “Greetings, Fellow Daoists.”</p><p>“This is Fellow Daoist Yu…”</p><p>Realist Luohua then gestured towards the black-robed man, introducing all five individuals in the hall, starting with the strange figure.</p><p>The two women were indeed mother and daughter.  The beautiful matron, known as Lady Shuanghua, had been invited, bringing her daughter along to broaden her horizons.</p><p>The elder, whose Daoist title was Realist Tonghu, was also a Daoist Grandmaster.</p><p>Finally, Realist Luohua introduced Qin Sang to the others.  Learning that Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, even the most aloof, the surnamed Yu cultivator, rose and cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang chose a seat without regard for rank, settling down beside the strange figure.  Through brief conversation, he learned that all four present were Artifact Refinement Grandmasters.  The surnamed Yu cultivator and Realist Tonghu were also guest elders of the Five Elements Alliance, while the strange figure and Lady Shuanghua had different backgrounds.</p><p>"Sect Master, since Elder Qin has arrived, there shouldn't be any other fellow Daoists, correct? May we be informed of the task at hand?" Realist Tonghu inquired, swaying his large feet.</p><p>Realist Luohua seated himself in the seat of honor. “It seems Fellow Daoist Tonghu has grown impatient.”</p><p>“Not just Fellow Daoist Tonghu. We’ve been lingering in your esteemed sect for many days with nothing to do, making us uneasy,” Lady Shuanghua said softly.</p><p>The male head of the strange figure let out another strange laugh. “Whatever trouble the Sect Master has encountered will eventually be known to us. Since we’re here, we’re not afraid of danger. Why maintain such secrecy, only to make everyone increasingly apprehensive?”</p><p>Hearing this, Realist Luohua smiled faintly. “I imagine all of you have heard some distorted rumors, thinking that I would lead you into a perilous place.  However, I intentionally spread those rumors to mislead others.”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly thought that this commission was indeed fishy. It was likely that other elders were unwilling to accept it, and the Alliance was taking advantage of his recent arrival. They didn't necessarily need to deceive him, only to conceal some key information, downplaying the risks, enticing him with the promise of treasures. In the short term, it would be difficult for him to verify the truth.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang couldn't resent the Alliance.  Even if he had been tricked into coming, he still had the opportunity to refuse, at most wasting a trip.  If he agreed, he couldn’t blame anyone for any subsequent dangers.</p><p>Everyone in the hall, except for Lady Shuanghua's daughter, were Void Refinement cultivators, mature and composed.  Though surprised, they didn't lose their composure. Realist Tonghu asked in a deep voice, “Sect Master, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>“Firstly, to conceal our sect’s true objective. Secondly, to filter out those with powerful backgrounds,” Realist Luohua explained.</p><p>Everyone fell into contemplation, glancing at each other, gradually understanding Realist Luohua’s intention.</p><p>A commission with such generous rewards, yet shrouded in uncertainty, wouldn’t attract those from powerful sects or backgrounds. They lacked no cultivation resources, so why risk their lives?</p><p>Qin Sang had joined the Five Elements Alliance not long ago and appeared much like a rogue cultivator.  Elder Qi, who had recruited him, even suspected he was an ascendant from a lower realm.  Judging by the introductions, none of the others seemed to be disciples of major sects.</p><p>With no significant background, their cultivation achievements were entirely their own. They were more easily drawn to opportunities and also easier to manage.</p><p>Selecting these five individuals must have taken considerable effort on the part of Luohua Sect.</p><p>"Sect Master, please don't keep us in suspense. Tell us plainly, what is it that you require of us?" Realist Tonghu asked with a wry smile.</p><p>Realist Luohua's expression turned slightly serious.  He looked around at everyone.  "You all still have the chance to refuse.  Once I reveal everything, you cannot leave our sect until the matter is concluded, or don't blame me for turning hostile. I can swear an oath here and now that you will be in no danger!"</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, but none departed. Lady Shuanghua transmitted a message, instructing her daughter to withdraw.  The young maiden dared not disobey and reluctantly left the Xuanshui Hall.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, but he didn't flinch.</p><p>Realist Luohua smiled in satisfaction.  “This matter is also an opportunity for all of you. You are all Artifact Refinement Grandmasters, so you must all know of Postnatal Spiritual Treasures. Has anyone personally refined one?”</p><p>Upon hearing these words, everyone’s expressions shifted drastically.  Thinking of a certain possibility, even the aloof female head of the strange figure’s breathing grew heavy.</p><p>Realist Tonghu’s eyes flashed. “Sect Master, don’t jest.  How could just anyone refine a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure?  I consider myself somewhat capable in the art of artifact refinement, yet I wouldn’t harbor such delusions.”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The surnamed Yu cultivator nodded. “Postnatal Spiritual Treasures nurture artifact spirits.  This step requires the work of creation, as difficult as ascending to the heavens. I have no grandmaster lineage behind me, even with a cultivation level like Fellow Daoist’s, I wouldn't dare to hope for such a thing.”</p><p>Lady Shuanghua and the strange figure remained silent, but their expressions suggested similar thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts were far more complex.  It seemed that in this vast world, Postnatal Spiritual Treasures were indeed extremely rare. It was no wonder he hadn’t seen a single one despite encountering so many Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>However, he possessed two items that held the potential to become Postnatal Spiritual Treasures: Little Five and the Cloud Wanderer Sword. But these two treasures both possessed immense fortune, having been blessed by the Purple Star Child.</p><p>For ordinary artifact refiners, refining a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure was indeed as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>He wondered if it would be easier at the Body Integration stage.</p><p>Realist Luohua’s words seemed to imply that Luohua Sect wished to request their assistance in refining a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure.  Qin Sang couldn’t miss such an opportunity.  Even gleaning a few insights would be immensely beneficial for Little Five’s future transformation!</p><p>“Just as you all surmise, I wish to refine a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure and request your full assistance!”</p><p>Realist Luohua rose to his feet and bowed deeply.</p><p>Everyone was visibly excited.  Excitement flickered in Realist Tonghu’s eyes.  “How does the Sect Master wish for us to assist? Could it be that your esteemed sect possesses a supreme inheritance in artifact refinement, willing to share it with us?  If so, I am willing to forgo any reward!”</p><p>These words echoed everyone’s sentiments.</p><p>Realist Luohua nodded.  “Indeed, there is a secret art. I’m unsure if its origins lie in artifact refinement.  However, the demands of this art on the cultivator are extremely high.  Even with my cultivation, I can only barely master it.”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone’s hearts trembled, their excitement cooling.</p><p>The female head of the strange figure coldly questioned, “If you can’t cultivate it, how can we help you?”</p><p>The male head added, “Unless the Sect Master simply wants us to lend a hand with menial tasks.”</p><p>“Since I’ve invited all of you here, naturally it’s for a significant purpose, requiring your assistance until the very end. Otherwise, why would I be so cautious? Although you all cannot cultivate the secret art, I have a solution. Our sect treasures a special talisman, called the Unhindered Seal. At that time, I will cast a spell, applying the talisman to each of you, allowing me to utilize the secret art through your hands.”</p><p>Realist Luohua’s words caused an uproar.</p><p>The female head of the strange figure immediately rebuked, “Absurd! With the talisman on our bodies, our minds will be under your control. Wouldn't that leave us at your mercy?!”</p><p>The others also wore expressions of fury, as if about to slam their fists on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, remained the calmest.  With the Jade Buddha protecting him, he was least afraid of such talismans.</p><p>“Everyone, please calm down and allow me to explain in detail,” Realist Luohua soothed, elaborating on Luohua Sect’s plan.</p><p>After Realist Luohua finished speaking, everyone’s anger subsided, replaced by contemplation. The hall fell silent.  Realist Luohua didn’t urge them, patiently awaiting their answers.</p><p>It turned out that the Postnatal Spiritual Treasure Luohua Sect wished to refine, due to certain reasons, couldn't be completed by Realist Luohua alone. He required the assistance of six Artifact Refinement Grandmasters.</p><p>Luohua Sect could provide another Realist, but the remaining five positions needed to be filled from outside.</p><p>During the refinement process, the six individuals would assist with the refining on one hand, and on the other, they would cooperate with Realist Luohua to utilize the secret art through the Unhindered Seal.</p><p>However, Realist Luohua wouldn't be able to control their minds.  He would merely channel the secret art through them. When Realist Luohua’s intent was transmitted, they simply needed to maintain their true selves, following the subtle guidance.</p><p>It was no wonder Realist Luohua didn't choose individuals with powerful backgrounds.  In this type of refinement, they wouldn’t be able to participate in the entire process, only responsible for a part of it, unable to grasp the complete secret art, and still bearing the risk of being controlled.</p><p>For them, the insights gained were undoubtedly valuable, a rare opportunity.  However, it wasn't so for disciples of major sects.</p><p>It was important to note that during the refinement, Realist Luohua also required their willing cooperation. If anyone harbored ill intentions or deliberately resisted, while it wouldn't necessarily destroy the treasure on the spot, it would greatly hinder the process.</p><p>Realist Luohua's expression shifted slightly, sensing the sound transmissions among those below.  He didn't stop them, observing them openly.</p><p>Qin Sang also participated in the discussion.  They exchanged words, identifying all potential risks.</p><p>After a moment, Realist Tonghu spoke, “Sect Master, could you please bring the talisman for us to examine?”</p><p>“Of course.  Once you see the Unhindered Seal, you'll know that it doesn’t have the function of controlling minds!”</p><p>Realist Luohua was quite straightforward. He immediately sent a message, ordering someone to fetch it, adding, “With your cultivation levels, once the talisman is applied, if it hinders you in any way, your spiritual senses will surely detect it. During the treasure refinement, if I dare to harbor ill intentions, you may join forces to retaliate.”</p><p>Realist Luohua spoke sincerely.  Everyone remained noncommittal, deciding to wait until they had seen the talisman before making a decision.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the others. Lady Shuanghua was at the Mid Void Refinement stage, while the rest were at the Early Void Refinement stage. United, they represented a considerable force.  If they retaliated, even with Realist Luohua personally intervening, Luohua Sect would pay a heavy price.</p><p>Next, including Qin Sang, everyone posed their questions, which Realist Luohua answered one by one.</p><p>Before long, a powerful aura arrived from outside the hall.  A Daoist priest pushed open the door, holding a jade box in his hands.</p><p>“This is Junior Brother Quan. He will be assisting me along with all of you,”  Realist Luohua introduced. Realist Quan opened the jade box, revealing a faint, clear light within. A transparent talisman slowly rose into the air.</p><p>The talisman was a foot long and three inches wide, inscribed with profound runes as if carved onto precious jade. It hovered before everyone.</p><p>To gain their trust, Realist Luohua even revealed part of the activation method.  After carefully examining it, everyone fell into silence once more.</p><p>After a long while, Lady Shuanghua suddenly spoke, “Yanling City certainly possesses Earthfire Furnaces.  Could the location for the treasure refinement be chosen in Yanling City?”</p><p>Everyone's expressions shifted, their gazes falling on Realist Luohua.</p><p>Realist Luohua frowned, pondering for a moment. “Very well. If we fail, all is for naught.  As long as the artifact spirit is successfully formed and enters the tribulation, others won't be able to stop it, even if they try.  We shall follow Lady Shuanghua's suggestion! However, various arrangements still need to be transported from the sect, requiring a few more days.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others’ expressions relaxed, all agreeing that it was fine.</p><p>Thus, it was decided. The date for the artifact refinement was set for three months later.</p><p>Within these three months, Qin Sang and the others were not permitted to leave Luohua Sect, constantly accompanied by attendants.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind, allowing Realist Yuhong to guide him, practically exploring the entirety of Luohua Sect, visiting the Ju Fu clan several times.</p><p>…</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Yanling City.</p><p>Luohua Sect had completed all preparations. Qin Sang and the others secretly gathered in a fire chamber.</p><p>Realist Luohua had further modified the fire chamber, constructing a raised platform upon which stood a bronze furnace with beast-like ears.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation south of the furnace, while the others occupied their respective positions.  Before each of them floated numerous spiritual materials, required for the upcoming refinement.</p><p>Realist Luohua hovered in the center, seated in meditation above the furnace.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The restrictive light of the platform flickered, and the spiritual fire intensified, roaring flames erupting from the furnace’s mouth. The fire chamber instantly became scorching hot.</p><p>All of them being Void Refinement cultivators, they remained unaffected, their gazes fixed on Realist Luohua.</p><p>Realist Luohua flicked his sleeve, and a ball of spiritual light fell into the furnace.  The spiritual fire subsided momentarily before erupting once more.</p><p>Everyone vaguely saw something resembling a foot-long object within the spiritual light.</p><p>Before they could ponder further, Realist Luohua retrieved the Unhindered Seal, forming hand seals and commanding in a deep voice, “Fellow Daoists, please first restrain your true essence!”</p>
