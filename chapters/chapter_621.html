Chapter 613: Ya Gu


The terrifying buzzing and the bloodthirsty aura emanating from the Bloodwing Hornets terrified the mountain's creatures. Even the fiercest predators were frightened, and the mountains were plunged into chaos.
Strangely, the hornets seemed uninterested in the corpse on the ground. Not a single one flew down to bother him.
Then, the corpse moved.
He rolled over and fell back into the river, seemingly using all his strength. With his remaining arm, he clung to a thick log and drifted away, spared from being devoured by the swarm.
……
Evening arrived.
Mountain rain drizzled down, carried by a cool breeze.
The mountains in the distance appeared dark and hazy.
On a steep, river-encircled mountain, stilt houses stood clustered together, rising in tiers. A rough count revealed over a thousand households.
This village was known as Thousand Households Village.
Neither large nor small, Thousand Households Village, along with several other villages, controlled the surrounding hundred miles. Much of this territory was treacherous and unexplored by ordinary people.
Before nightfall, lamps were lit throughout the village, twinkling like stars in the darkening sky.
However, on the back of the mountain, a small, dilapidated hut stood isolated, surrounded by a sparse fence.
Outside the fence, several young women in bright, colorful dresses gathered, chattering and urging the girl inside to open the door.
“Ya Gu, we heard you pulled a man out of the river. Let us see!”
“Yeah! Yeah!  Hiding him? Afraid we'll steal him?”
“Didn't expect Ya Gu to get a taste of a man first. We thought no one would want her! Hee hee…”
“Ya Gu, you're not sixteen yet!  A secret engagement?  Careful, Elder Da Zhang Lao will break your legs…”
“Oh my, the jinx actually saved someone!  Get rid of him quickly!  Otherwise, in a couple of days, he'll be cursed to death. Wouldn't that be a waste?”
……
They taunted her while pushing against the fence, trying to force their way in to see the man.
The girl inside was anxious and helpless, making 'ah ah' sounds, trying to persuade them to stop, but unable to speak a word.
She was mute, and everyone in the village called her Ya Gu.
Ya Gu's clothes were a stark contrast to the other girls'. Hers were patched but very clean.  She kept her face turned to the side, her eyes filled with shyness and insecurity.
A closer look revealed a large birthmark on her left cheek, marring her face.
Just as Ya Gu's anxiety peaked, a light appeared on the mountain path.  An elderly man approached, carrying a bamboo lantern.
Seeing the commotion, the old man scolded, “Night is falling, and you're still out here making a ruckus!  Get home!”
The girls, seemingly afraid of the old man, stopped their teasing. Sticking their tongues out at Ya Gu behind the old man's back, they skipped away.
“If I see you bullying Ya Gu again, I’ll break your legs!”
The old man raised his lantern and shouted after them.
“Witch Doctor Grandpa, you always favor Ya Gu…”
One girl muttered under her breath.
Shaking his head in annoyance, the old man walked to the fence and asked, “Ya Gu, has the man woken up again? Can he walk yet?”
Ya Gu nodded and made a few hand gestures.
The old man acknowledged, "Good. When his injuries are better, have Ba Chai and the others take him away during the Spirit Festival!”
Ya Gu's face became anxious as she quickly signed.
The old man interrupted her with a cold snort.
“Ya Gu, you're too naive.
“That man had his arm cut off. He told you not to let anyone see him, hiding his face. He's obviously done something shady! Don’t be fooled by his looks and sweet talk. He’s not a good person.
“He’s taking advantage of your kindness!
“If you weren’t so stubborn, I wouldn’t have even treated him. I would have thrown him back in the river.  It’s fine if he doesn't leave during the Spirit Festival. He can leave with the next trade caravan, but he can't stay in the village.
“We've been kind enough letting him stay this long. Elder Da Zhang Lao has already inquired about him once. He can’t stay. He’ll bring disaster to our village!
“Don't worry, Ya Gu. When you turn sixteen, Witch Doctor Grandpa will find you a good husband.”
Ya Gu lowered her head, her eyes dim, and didn't argue further.
The old man handed her a pouch. “Take this.  It contains herbs.  Enough for three doses.  Let that boy heal quickly and leave.”
Ya Gu took the pouch. As the old man turned to leave, she made some sounds and ran back inside, returning with a thick straw raincoat, which she draped over the old man.
“Grandpa’s strong, you don't need this. You're frail, go back inside, don't catch a cold…”
The old man waved her away, but Ya Gu insisted.
“Sigh!”
The old man touched the birthmark on Ya Gu's face and said sadly, “Such a good girl, why such a hard life? The spirits are unfair!  Witch Doctor Grandpa will find a way to remove that birthmark! By the way, if You Ning and the others bother you again, go to the ancestral hall and report them.  Witch Doctor Grandpa will stand up for you and have them punished according to village law. They won’t dare to do it again.”
Ya Gu shook her head repeatedly, signing in protest.
“Silly girl, they’re not playing with you…”
The old man sighed and left.
After seeing the old man off, Ya Gu returned to her small courtyard, looking at the almost broken fence gate, her expression downcast. Back inside, she lit the fire pit, set up the medicine pot, and began to brew the herbs.
Her movements were practiced, clearly not her first time.
Just then, a 'thud' came from the inner room.
Ya Gu's face filled with concern. She rushed inside to see a one-armed man emerge.  His steps were weak, as if a gust of wind could knock him over, but he was walking.
“I’m fine. I'm getting better every day.”
The one-armed man sat by the fire, warming himself. He took the hot water Ya Gu offered and said, “I've caused you so much trouble.”
This man was Qin Sang!
He no longer had the aura of a Fake Core Realm cultivator. He looked as weak as a sick mortal.
He had been sleeping for days at a time.
The commotion outside had woken him from his slumber.
Sitting by the fire, he examined his inner self.
His Qi sea and meridians were sealed by strange restrictive runes, his spiritual power useless.
His divine sense was also completely depleted, although it had begun to recover slowly.  It would take two more days to recover enough to open his Qianjun Ring.
A cultivator, reduced to being a burden on mortals, facing expulsion.
Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh: A dragon stranded in shallow water, a tiger fallen in the plains.
