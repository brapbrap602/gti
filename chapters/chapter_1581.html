<h1></h1><p>Back in the snowfield.</p><p>Elder Yanshan and Qin Sang's avatar were in hot pursuit of the Snow Fox, their eyes fixed on its fleeting form while simultaneously observing their surroundings.  It was no wonder Elder Yanshan and Situ Yu had returned empty-handed multiple times.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated they were nearing the Snow Fox's lair, yet the area remained unremarkable, devoid of any discernible restrictions or spirit array fluctuations.</p><p>Furthermore, the Snow Fox's behavior felt peculiar. Even low-level Glacial Spirits possessed rudimentary emotions. Yet despite being chased relentlessly, the fox hadn't glanced back at its pursuers, nor had it uttered a single cry of alarm or anger.  It remained unhurried and unafraid, as if completely confident in its escape.</p><p>Could the Snow Fox truly believe it could evade them?</p><p>The thought had barely crossed Qin Sang's mind when the fleeing fox vanished before his very eyes. Typically, it would reappear from another direction after its spatial blink, yet this time, it was truly gone.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan reached the spot where the fox disappeared.  They were now at the very bottom of a ravine.  Landing on solid ground, they swiftly scanned the intersection of several ravines.</p><p>A biting wind howled through the gorges, tiny ice particles colliding and forming a thick fog that persisted unless the wind ceased. This terrain was commonplace on the plains.</p><p>Yet, it was precisely this ordinariness that felt amiss.  The Snow Fox, after fleeing for so long, wouldn't disappear in such a place without reason.  There had to be something hidden here!</p><p>Elder Yanshan surveyed the area, finding nothing. He turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shimmered with azure light as his mind connected with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, meticulously searching every inch of the surroundings.</p><p>Moments passed.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang motionless, Elder Yanshan spoke, “We've shattered countless stone walls; this place is no different.  Let's unleash our power and blast the terrain apart. Any secrets will be revealed.”</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Yanshan retrieved his thin cord, wrist flicking, preparing to lash at the stone wall to their right.</p><p>"Wait!" Qin Sang stopped him, suddenly looking down at his feet.</p><p>Elder Yanshan paused, then flew into the air. “The Snow Fox’s lair is underground?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, hesitant. “It doesn’t seem like a lair…”</p><p>Through the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s vision, he saw a fox-shaped pattern on the ground. The constant winds prevented loose soil from settling in the ravines, leaving behind polished stone covered in a thick layer of ice.  The pattern wasn't carved into the stone, but within the ice itself, floating on the surface.</p><p>The fox was lifelike, identical to the Snow Fox, as though frozen within the ice. Like the Snow Fox’s spatial blink, this icy pattern was incredibly faint. Without the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, even Qin Sang himself would have missed it.</p><p>“The Snow Fox is hidden within the ice?” Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>To his senses, this ice felt no different from any other, just ordinary ice that could be cracked with a little force.  Even Elder Yanshan’s divine sense found nothing unusual.</p><p>“It's more than just a lair! Since you see a fox pattern, the key lies within it.  Force will only backfire. Draw the pattern, and we’ll decipher it together," Elder Yanshan urged.</p><p>Qin Sang shared the same thought. He extended his fingers, meticulously recreating the fox pattern in the air.</p><p>Elder Yanshan stared at it, deep in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze remained fixed on the ground, tracing the fox from head to tail.  After a moment of contemplation, a flash of insight struck him.  “What if we consider it a restriction or rune? Perhaps the Snow Fox is innately proficient in such arts.”</p><p>He possessed the complete inheritance of the Yuan Mirage Sect and had studied countless texts in the Xuan Tian Palace, achieving a significant level of mastery in formations and restrictions.  Approaching the pattern from this perspective yielded new discoveries.  The Snow Fox, if it thought such a simple trick could fool him and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, underestimated them both.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shifted, focusing on the fox’s eyes.  The surface revealed nothing more; he would have to try attacking it.</p><p>“I’ll do it!” Elder Yanshan volunteered.  “You keep your eyes on it; don’t be deceived.”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped back, placing several array flags around them as a precaution, then pointed out the location of the fox’s eyes to Elder Yanshan.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The thin cord shot out, bending mid-air, its ends aimed at the fox’s eyes.</p><p>Elder Yanshan suddenly paused, a hint of embarrassment in his voice. “I hadn't anticipated your abilities. We should have discussed our terms beforehand.”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“As a friend of Sect Master Situ, and after half a year together, I have no doubts about your character. Locating the Snow Fox is your achievement. To be frank, those Glacial Crystals are of some use to me, but not essential.  Once found, we split them evenly.  If the quantity doesn’t suffice, I’ll concede a portion.  However, if there are other treasures, the Glacial Crystals are yours, and I have first pick of the remaining treasures.  We continue in turn. What do you think?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression softened. His sole purpose was the Glacial Crystals, and this arrangement suited him perfectly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s agreement, Elder Yanshan’s face brightened.  Without hesitation, the cord shot downwards, piercing both of the fox's eyes.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The cord pierced through the ice, through the fox’s eyes, and effortlessly through the stone beneath, sinking deep into the earth.</p><p>The ease with which it penetrated startled them both.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The fox’s body erupted in white light, its fur growing wildly, transforming into countless white threads that spread across the ice.  Like a demonic fox, it unleashed a strange power.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Within a radius of several miles, the stone walls and ice shattered, instantly forming a swirling tempest of rubble and ice shards.</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan’s expressions changed drastically as they retreated rapidly.</p><p>…</p><p>While the two pursued the Snow Fox, Moon Concubine left Deer Field alone, traversing thick clouds and landing at the edge of the snowfield.  She raised a jade arm, forming a hand seal to sense the Glacial Spirit and determine its location, then draped a light veil over herself, blurring her figure.</p><p>Just as she prepared to enter the snowfield, she paused, changed direction, and circled to the other side.  With a flick of her finger, she sent a streak of light into the snow before proceeding.</p><p>Guided by the Glacial Spirit, she effortlessly pinpointed their position.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his focus on the Snow Fox. However, from the moment Elder Yanshan attacked the fox’s eyes until now, it remained completely vanished. They, on the other hand, were in trouble, possibly trapped.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated some danger and kept his distance from Elder Yanshan, allowing them to support each other.  He hadn’t anticipated such a wide-reaching effect.</p><p>The tempest surged towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately activated the flag array he had set up. The banners fluttered, forming a protective barrier of dark yellow light.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The barrier shuddered under the relentless assault. This was no ordinary tempest; its power was extraordinary.  The banners trembled violently, the spirit array threatening to collapse.</p><p>Elder Yanshan quickly retreated to Qin Sang's side, sweeping his hand across his waist.  Three blue orbs flew out, intertwining in the air and revealing their true form: three bone shields, each shaped like a dragon’s skull.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan commanded. The three Dragon Skull Shields flew in different directions, spewing streams of water from their mouths that merged with the flag array, drastically reinforcing its defenses.</p><p>Though this was their first collaboration, their coordination was seamless.</p><p>Fortunately, Elder Yanshan acted swiftly.  As the shields took effect, blue light flashed within the tempest, revealing fist-sized ice spheres spinning rapidly as they hurtled towards them within the maelstrom.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The ice spheres exploded with the force of thunder, their impact shaking the banners and shields, which nevertheless held firm.</p><p>"These ice spheres… are similar to the Glacial Qi within the Glacial Crystals!" Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, then widened with excitement.  If they could find the crystals, losing the Snow Fox was a small price to pay.</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Yanshan changed tactics, maneuvering the bone shields to meet the ice spheres head-on, advancing towards the heart of the tempest.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s vision, still searching for the Snow Fox. Despite finding the familiar Glacial Qi, he hadn’t seen any crystals yet and needed to be wary of the fox lurking in the shadows. He grew increasingly suspicious.  Could the fox truly possess such intelligence to lay this trap?</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed something astonishing.  The left stone wall, clearly shattered earlier, had somehow reformed.</p><p>His expression changed. He looked to the right, and sure enough, a new wall had appeared there as well. They were now within a stone passage filled with the tempest and ice spheres.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face grew grave.  They had unknowingly entered an unknown place.</p><p>…</p><p>As the tempest erupted, Moon Concubine arrived nearby.  Hearing the rumbling and seeing the collapsing stone walls, she gritted her teeth and, without waiting to assess the situation or for reinforcements, plunged into the storm.</p><p>Outside the snowfield, Qin Sang’s true body stood perplexed.</p><p>“Two mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, pursuing a mere Snow Fox, can encounter such trouble?”</p><p>The connection between him and his avatar had suddenly weakened. His perfected avatar, wielding spirit treasures, carrying the Ruyi Pearl and Heavenly Eye Butterfly, faced few threats in this world.</p><p>Moreover, the connection was weakened, not severed, as though separated by a barrier.</p><p>His face remained calm.  With a series of flashes, he entered the snowfield.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the tempest, Elder Yanshan controlled the Dragon Skull Shields, deflecting the ice spheres.  Hearing Qin Sang’s observation, he snorted. “What tricks is that beast playing? We'll find out once we break through!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  Together, they feared no Grand Cultivator.  For now, the tempest and ice spheres posed no real threat; they could overcome them with brute force.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Snowtreading Divine Saber, hovering it above his head, directing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to focus on what lay ahead.</p><p>Soon, the tempest’s intensity diminished.</p><p>They increased their speed, charging forward and finally breaking through.</p><p>Elder Yanshan recalled the shields, while Qin Sang retrieved the flag array, his saber pointed forward.</p><p>They faced no immediate attack.</p><p>They found themselves in a glacial cave, bathed in a blue light. Icicles hung from the ceiling, and thick glacial ice radiated a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>"Is this the source of the snowfield’s Glacial Qi?" Qin Sang surveyed the ice cave, with its hanging icicles and forest of ice pillars, a world of ice. The Snow Fox was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>He then noticed an open area deep within the cave, distinctly different from its surroundings.  At its center stood a single octagonal ice pillar. Atop the pillar rested a fist-sized sphere of ice, identical in color and texture to the Glacial Crystal Situ Yu had given him.</p><p>“A Glacial Crystal!”</p><p>As his eyes fell upon the crystal, Qin Sang noticed something else amiss.  The ice surrounding the octagonal pillar was etched with a spirit array composed of countless runes.  The array was exceptionally complex, defying immediate comprehension by both Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.  They could only discern its connection to the Dao of Ice.</p><p>“This is artificially created.” Qin Sang realized with a start.  Such an array could never occur naturally!</p><p>He stared at the Glacial Crystal on the ice pillar.  The creator of this array was likely using it to gather Glacial Qi.  The Snow Fox might have been their guardian spirit beast.  They had inadvertently stumbled into someone else’s domain.</p><p>“It’s definitely not the work of anyone contemporary.” Elder Yanshan’s gaze swept across the ice pillar, searching for further clues. His tone was certain. “If I’m not mistaken, gathering Glacial Qi this way would take centuries, perhaps even millennia, to form such a large crystal. The owner of this place hasn’t been back for a long time…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.  If the ancient cultivator were still alive, they would have harvested the crystal long ago.  Its size didn’t affect its efficacy.</p><p>The world of cultivation was unpredictable.  A cultivator’s meticulous preparations might never be enjoyed by themselves.</p><p>However, obtaining the Glacial Crystal would likely be no easy feat.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the spirit array surrounding the crystal, preparing to decipher it, when the Heavenly Eye Butterfly suddenly sent a warning.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang spun around, his Snowtreading Divine Saber humming faintly.</p><p>Elder Yanshan, still unaware of the approaching danger, saw Qin Sang’s reaction and his expression changed. He quickly shifted the Dragon Skull Shields to his rear.</p><p>The next moment, a seductive woman emerged from the tempest. It was Moon Concubine.</p><p>Their six eyes met, each startled.</p><p>Moon Concubine, veiled in light gauze, raised a jade arm, unleashing a cloud of smoke that rushed towards Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept his saber concealed, intending to ascertain the newcomer’s identity before acting.  If they were the owner of this place, a negotiation might be possible.</p><p>He hadn't expected an immediate attack without a word.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>Two pink lightning bolts shot out from the smoke, targeting both Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Two resounding *bangs* followed.</p><p>One bolt struck Elder Yanshan’s Dragon Skull Shield. The other, bizarrely, pierced through Qin Sang’s flag array and reached him instantly.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted swiftly, activating the Ruyi Pearl within his body.  Its protective aura blocked the lightning.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan’s expressions darkened.</p>
