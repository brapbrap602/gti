Chapter 694: Thousand Demons Sea


“Go there now?”
Qin Sang looked towards Hutian Island, hesitation evident on his face.
Seeing this, Han Cuo said, “Fellow Daoist, if you have no urgent matters, there's no need to rush. Once you're on Hutian Island, leaving isn't so easy, and you'll miss out on many things. Our fellow human cultivators have established a market-like place outside Hutian Island where we can trade goods, exchange information, and use as a base. The Daoists who dare to remain off the island at this time are all quite powerful. Sometimes, due to misfortune, some fellow Daoists suffer unexpected calamities and are forced to sell their most treasured possessions. As a result, rare and precious treasures frequently appear in the market. Fellow Daoist, why not come with me and take a look? Perhaps you'll find something you desire. You helped us defeat a powerful enemy, and it would be our honor to entertain you at the market as a token of our gratitude…”
“Oh? It seems Fellow Daoist Han has had quite a harvest.”
Qin Sang gave Han Cuo a meaningful look.
He wouldn't even go to Duyan Island, let alone set foot on Hutian Island. He had guessed there might be a market-like place outside Hutian Island, but he didn't expect Han Cuo to bring it up. He was ready to go along with the suggestion.
Not attracted by the treasures Han Cuo mentioned, Qin Sang planned to gather the information he needed at the market and then go directly to search for the Eternal Camphor Tree.
“To be honest with Fellow Daoist Qin, my gains during this period have been comparable to the past ten years combined.”
Han Cuo smiled without modesty, then sighed, “I originally thought mid-stage Core Formation was my limit.  At this rate, I might glimpse a sliver of hope for the late stage. Given this opportunity, I have to strive for it. Otherwise, I wouldn't risk my life staying out here…”
Hearing this, another Core Formation cultivator nodded in agreement, sharing Han Cuo's sentiment.
“In that case, I will accompany you, fellow Daoists. I hope there will be something of interest.”
After some thought, Qin Sang agreed.
Overjoyed, Han Cuo and the others immediately decided to set off together.
Their flight path was the opposite of Hutian Island, clearly heading deeper into the Sea of Demons.
Han Cuo and his companions were extremely cautious. They constantly changed direction, and their formation was well-organized.  Qin Sang didn't try to stand out, following Han Cuo's commands, advancing and retreating with the group.
This further improved their impression of him.
Three days later, as they arrived at a deserted area of the sea, Qin Sang noticed Han Cuo occasionally taking out a compass-like artifact, seemingly using it to verify their direction or for communication.
Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Han Cuo explained, “Because we need to guard against both the demon and witch races, the market has no fixed location. Instead, it's held in a different spot within this area every so often.  It just so happens that the market is about to open. We were already heading there when we unfortunately encountered those witch race scoundrels, which led to the battle.”
“Are there many Daoists from both the human and witch races who choose to stay outside Hutian Island?”
Qin Sang inquired.
Han Cuo changed direction again, paused, and said gravely, “Compared to the cultivators on Hutian Island, those who stay outside are naturally a minority, but the actual number is not small.  Aside from those blessed with Heaven-grade or Dual Spiritual Roots, who can confidently claim to have a high chance of reaching Nascent Soul through diligent cultivation alone? The war between the two races is dangerous, but hunting demons is equally risky. Many Daoists share my thoughts, some even more radical.”
Qin Sang's heart stirred. "Fellow Daoist Han, do you mean that late-stage Core Formation cultivators from both sides have stepped forward to organize forces and engage in open warfare?"
“It’s even more terrifying than you imagine!”
Han Cuo shook his head, a trace of fear in his eyes.  “Without the Island Lord's constraints, rogue cultivators are even more rampant.  Many desperate individuals have joined them, occupying the Thousand Demons Sea, showing no mercy to either humans or witches. It's the most chaotic and bloody place outside Hutian Island. Initially, some unaware Daoists ventured near the Thousand Demons Sea, and none returned alive. No one knows which race the culprits belong to.  Fellow Daoist, unless you have no other path to immortality and are making a last-ditch effort, it's best to avoid the southeastern area of Hutian Island.”
“Thousand Demons Sea?” Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly.
"Oh," Han Cuo realized, "I almost forgot that Fellow Daoist Qin has just arrived at Hutian Island. The situation outside has been changing daily recently, so you're surely unfamiliar with it.  This is the cartographic chart I commonly use. It marks the latest information I've gathered and should be helpful to you."
Han Cuo handed Qin Sang a jade slip and added, “The Thousand Demons Sea was already the most dangerous place outside Hutian Island, earning its name from the countless powerful demons lurking within its depths. There's only one known safe route through the Thousand Demons Sea, and it's still fraught with peril.  Only mid to late-stage Core Formation Daoists dare to enter, and those individuals are currently occupying that very route."
After quickly reviewing the chart, Qin Sang’s last glimmer of hope vanished.
The route Han Cuo mentioned through the Thousand Demons Sea was the only path to the Nest of the Scarlet Fire Sparrow!
Now, that path was blocked by rogue cultivators!
If he hadn't been cautious and hadn't contacted local cultivators to gather information, he might have rushed in blindly and been unable to protect himself, even with the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.
A cold sweat broke out on Qin Sang’s back. He felt a surge of fear and deep worry.
With the only path blocked, how could he cross the Thousand Demons Sea and find the Scarlet Fire Sparrow? Had he wasted six months, only to return empty-handed?
He wondered if there was a second route through the Thousand Demons Sea.
Han Cuo was focused on locating the market and didn't notice Qin Sang’s reaction.
A moment later, Han Cuo exclaimed, “We're here!”
A small island reef, only a few meters wide, appeared ahead.  Just as Qin Sang was puzzled, Han Cuo pointed at his compass, and the water near the reef rippled. A cultivator emerged from the depths.
“So it's Fellow Daoist Han.”
This person seemed well-acquainted with Han Cuo and greeted him with a smile.
After a brief conversation, the cultivator handed Han Cuo an item and returned to the water. Han Cuo then instructed everyone to conceal their presence as they continued flying in another direction.
This scenario repeated three more times.
Qin Sang marveled at their caution, understanding that it was necessary given the pressure from the demon and witch races. He remained patient.
Preoccupied with how to cross the Thousand Demons Sea, he silently followed Han Cuo. Suddenly, Han Cuo exclaimed, "The market is just ahead!"
Qin Sang looked intently and saw a long, narrow island come into view.
The island was covered in wild grass and dotted with rocky hills, appearing deserted and desolate.
From afar, it seemed ordinary, but it held hidden wonders.
Han Cuo led them down to the island and walked straight to a cliff face. Qin Sang stared at the cliff for a moment, finally detecting a subtle anomaly.  It was concealed by a powerful restrictive formation.
