<h1>**272: Destruction**</h1><p>Two or three years.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. With that much time, he could weigh his decision carefully.</p><p>Most importantly, he could restore the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Amulet and increase his safety.</p><p>As he spoke, the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat sped through the underground. Suddenly, Cloud Wanderer’s eyes lit up and he pointed ahead.</p><p>“Brother Qin, look over there!”</p><p>Qin Sang followed his finger and saw a tiny crack on the circular seal in the direction Cloud Wanderer pointed. It extended into a tributary ahead.</p><p>They were still far away from the stone tablet, but it was clear that the fragile point in the circular seal wasn’t unique to the trial space. They had stumbled upon one fortunately.</p><p>As the strange noise began, the earthquake became increasingly violent, and the circular seal was impacted more and more. It was normal for a crack to first appear at its most vulnerable point.</p><p>They might not have been able to find the trial space, but having now found a fragile point, they couldn’t miss it. Without needing to be told, Qin Sang understood Cloud Wanderer’s meaning. He immediately turned the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat’s direction and followed the crack into the lava tributary.</p><p>He tracked the crack with his gaze until he finally found the end of the crack.</p><p>At the end of the tiny, thin crack was a gap the size of a thumbnail. The circular seal there was shimmering brightly and trying to fix itself, but the constant tremors made it unstable and not only prevented the seal from recovering, but also made the gap larger.</p><p>Over the gap, a crack had been torn into the ground by the quake.</p><p>Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer exchanged glances and said in unison:</p><p>“We can try!”</p><p>The Fire Spirit Beast was in pursuit, and they didn’t have time to wait for the gap to break apart by itself. When they were about to reach the gap, both of them acted at the same time.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flew out of Qin Sang’s forehead and the Sword Energy formed a circle, then quickly converged into the sword body.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer took out a bright, green pearl. It was about the size of a longan and crystal clear. The inside of the pearl had alternating wind and thunder and light and darkness. It was as if a small world was evolving inside the pearl.</p><p>When the pearl appeared, Qin Sang actually felt a strange sense of pressure. He couldn’t help but feel inwardly alarmed.</p><p>He’d only felt such pressure from Dharma treasure-class items like the Jade Octave and Eight Trigrams Saber Amulet. This pearl was surprisingly similar to them, but the pressure was much smaller; it was far from being comparable to a Dharma treasure.</p><p>However, this was more than enough to prove that the pearl was extraordinary; it was definitely the very best among supreme-grade magical artifacts. To the naked eye, it was on par with the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>It seemed that while Cloud Wanderer had been traveling for many years, he had indeed had some good fortune, even if he hadn’t cured his hidden injury.</p><p>The Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat and this pearl were both extraordinary.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer gave a low roar. The pearl dragged a green light and ferociously crashed into the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t want to be outdone, so he immediately urged the Ebony Sword to rush into the circular seal together with the pearl.</p><p>As Qin Sang had expected, the pearl’s power was indeed on par with the Ten Directions Yama Banner. It was even better than the Ebony Sword.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The seal at the gap was momentarily stunned from being attacked by the pearl and the Ebony Sword at the same time.</p><p>The time was short, but it was enough.</p><p>The Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat turned into a ray of light and passed through the gap in the blink of an eye. The Fire Spirit Beast, chasing closely behind, lost Qin Sang and the other’s aura and gradually calmed down.</p><p>The crack in the ground could let people through, so the two collected their magical artifacts and flew up.</p><p>“That’s a good treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the pearl with a strange look in his eye and complimented it.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer’s face was pale as he said with a bitter smile, “This Flawless Pearl is indeed this old Daoist’s greatest reliance, but it takes up too much energy. It’s like a beast that devours spiritual energy. Every time I use it, it can suck my Dantian dry. It’s really not as useful as Brother Qin’s Ebony Sword.”</p><p>…</p><p>They had finally escaped.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang flew out of the ground, the scene before him made him jump in fright.</p><p>They were in the southwest of the stone tablet and about equidistant from the stone tablet and Heavenly Peak. They could see the eye-catching stone tablet in the distance.</p><p>The air was filled with a pungent smell.</p><p>The sky to the west had completely changed color, turning blood red.</p><p>The ground had cracked open and lava shot out of the ground like rain, spewing into the sky before fading away.</p><p>The flame-like seal had been torn to pieces. Under the seal, countless peaks had toppled and collapsed, breaking into pieces with the ground. They were then surrounded by endless lava, becoming isolated islands.</p><p>One could clearly see countless Fire Spirit Beasts swimming around in the lava. It seemed like the ancient cultivator’s ruins were about to become the domain of the Fire Spirit Beasts.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s astonishment, the four heaven peaks began to tilt, and two of them even collided with each other, causing half of them to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the trembling sensation he had felt at the beginning. He looked towards the heaven peak that Si Kong Muyue had come from, and wondered if that was the source of the changes.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the ancient cultivator ruins’ space seemed to be collapsing. Bare eyes could see some black lines appear around the collapsed heaven peak. They extended across the void. Some of them stretched for hundreds of feet. The Fire Spirit Beasts and magma collided with the black lines and disappeared into thin air.</p><p>They were incredibly similar to the legendary space cracks!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped. Even the war waged between the Daoist of the Earthly Lack and the Daoist of Xuan Universe had not been able to shake those totem restrictions in the slightest. However, the ancient cultivator ruins, which had existed for so long, were suddenly going to be destroyed.</p><p>Had this place been on the verge of collapse to begin with, and had they become the final straw that broke the camel’s back?</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, we must leave quickly to avoid being caught in this,” said You Yunzi. His composure was much better than Qin Sang’s. He pointed at the ground in the distance and said as a reminder.</p><p>The cracks in the ground were spreading outwards at a speed visible to the naked eye. Sometimes, the ground could be seen arching high up, before being entirely lifted up. Magma and the Fire Spirit Beasts immediately rushed out from underground, and the magma submerged the land.</p><p>The vegetation that was struggling to survive met its true end.</p><p>At this time, everyone was moving towards the stone tablet at the exit.</p><p>There were several silhouettes suspended near the stone tablet. They had arrived earlier and were observing the situation.</p><p>In the west, there was a ray of light galloping as some escaped. Some were fast and others were slow, but fortunately the Fire Spirit Beasts that had rushed out from the ground were not too many yet. Even those who were at the back did not need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated and said, “Senior, please go ahead. I still have a small matter to attend to.”</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, be careful. The speed at which the restrictions are collapsing will definitely increase,” You Yunzi did not ask much and reminded Qin Sang before controlling the spirit bamboo flying boat to fly towards the stone tablet.</p><p>After seeing You Yunzi’s silhouette disappear, Qin Sang thought silently for a while before his figure flashed. However, he went against the tide and moved westwards for a while before hiding in the path that people must pass through as they escaped towards the stone tablet.</p><p>Rays of light flickered past from above, as magma and the Fire Spirit Beasts neared.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless.</p><p>Only until the final ray of light flew past did he fail to see Ren Hong.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang start moving.</p><p>Chapter 272: Destruction</p><p>Two or three years.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. This much time was enough for him to consider everything clearly.</p><p>Most importantly, he could restore the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, adding another layer of protection.</p><p>As they spoke, the Spirit Bamboo flying boat continued to travel underground. Suddenly, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up, and he pointed ahead.</p><p>"Brother Qin, look over there!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed his gaze and noticed a tiny crack in the circular barrier in the direction Yun Youzi indicated, extending into a tributary ahead.</p><p>They were still far from the stone tablet, but the circular barrier clearly had more weak points than just the trial space. They had luckily stumbled upon one.</p><p>Since the upheaval began, the underground tremors had intensified, and the impact on the circular barrier had increased. It was only natural that cracks would appear first in its weaker areas.</p><p>They might not be able to find the trial space, but now that they had encountered a weak point, they naturally couldn't miss this opportunity. Without needing a reminder, Qin Sang understood Yun Youzi's meaning and immediately changed the Spirit Bamboo flying boat's direction, charging along the crack into the magma tributary.</p><p>His gaze locked onto the crack, finally tracing it to its end.</p><p>At the end of the hairline fracture, a thumb-sized gap appeared. The light of the circular barrier was dazzling here, and the barrier's power was trying to repair itself. However, the constant tremors made the barrier unstable, not only preventing its recovery but also causing the gap to grow larger.</p><p>Above the gap, the ground had also cracked open from the tremors.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi exchanged glances and said in unison,</p><p>"We can try!"</p><p>The fire spirits were in hot pursuit, leaving them no time to wait for the gap to collapse on its own. As they approached, they both took action.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flashed from Qin Sang's forehead, forming a sword array. Then, the power of the sword array instantly converged into the blade.</p><p>Yun Youzi summoned a jade-green orb, the size of a dragon's eye, crystal clear. Inside, wind and thunder flickered, yin and yang interchanged, as if a miniature world was evolving within.</p><p>The moment the orb appeared, Qin Sang felt a faint pressure, secretly startled.</p><p>Qin Sang had only felt this kind of pressure from treasures like the Heavenly Sound Conch and the Heavenly Dipper Blade Talisman. This orb was similar, although the pressure was much weaker, far from comparable to a true magical treasure.</p><p>But this was enough to demonstrate the orb's extraordinary nature. It was definitely a top-tier magical artifact, seemingly on par with the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>It seemed that Yun Youzi's years of wandering, while failing to cure his hidden injuries, had yielded considerable rewards.</p><p>Both the Spirit Bamboo flying boat and this orb were quite remarkable.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Yun Youzi shouted, and the orb, trailing a green light, slammed into the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang was not to be outdone, immediately urging the Ebony Sword forward. The sword and orb struck the circular barrier almost simultaneously. As Qin Sang expected, the orb's power was comparable to the Ten Yama Banners, even surpassing the Ebony Sword.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Simultaneously struck by the orb and the Ebony Sword, the barrier's power at the gap wavered, momentarily stagnating.</p><p>Although brief, it was enough.</p><p>The Spirit Bamboo flying boat transformed into a streak of light, flashing through the gap in the blink of an eye. The pursuing fire spirits, having lost Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's aura, gradually calmed down.</p><p>The fissure was wide enough for them to pass through. They retrieved their artifacts and flew upwards.</p><p>"What a treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the orb, a glint of admiration in his eyes, and offered a compliment.</p><p>A pale look flashed across Yun Youzi's face as he smiled wryly, "This Flawless Pearl is indeed my greatest reliance, but its consumption is immense. It's like a monster that devours spiritual energy. Every use drains my spiritual sea. It's truly not as handy as Brother Qin's Ebony Sword."</p><p>...</p><p>Finally, they had escaped.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by the scene before him as soon as he emerged.</p><p>They were southwest of the stone tablet, roughly equidistant from both the tablet and the Sky Peak. The prominent stone tablet was easily visible in the distance.</p><p>A pungent odor filled the air.</p><p>The west had completely transformed, bathed in crimson.</p><p>Cracks crisscrossed the earth, and magma gushed from the depths, erupting into the sky and spreading outwards.</p><p>The flame-like barrier had long been torn apart. Beneath it, countless peaks had collapsed, shattered along with the earth, and then engulfed by the endless magma, becoming isolated islands.</p><p>Numerous fire spirits could be seen rising and falling within the magma. The ancient cultivator's legacy seemed to be becoming the domain of the fire spirits.</p><p>Even more shockingly, the four celestial peaks began to tilt, two of them already colliding and partially collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the initial tremor he felt and glanced at the peak from which Sikong Muyue descended, wondering if that was the source of the upheaval.</p><p>Not only that, but Qin Sang also noticed the space within the ancient cultivator's legacy seemed to be collapsing. Around the already crumbled peak, black lines were visible to the naked eye, stretching across the void. Some spanned hundreds of feet.  Fire spirits and magma that touched these lines vanished without a trace.</p><p>They looked exactly like the legendary spatial rifts!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.  Even the battle between Elder Dique and Daoist Xuanyu hadn't shaken the totem restrictions in the slightest.  He couldn't understand why this ancient cultivator's legacy, which had existed for so long, was suddenly on the verge of destruction.</p><p>Could it be that this place was already on the brink of collapse, and they were the final straw?</p><p>"Brother Qin, we should also hurry out to avoid being affected," Yun Youzi, appearing much calmer than Qin Sang, pointed to the distant ground and warned.</p><p>The cracks in the earth were spreading at a visible rate.  Occasionally, the ground would bulge upwards before a whole section was flung into the air, immediately followed by magma and fire spirits erupting from below, submerging the land.</p><p>The struggling vegetation faced its true apocalypse.</p><p>Now, everyone was converging towards the exit marked by a stone tablet.</p><p>Several figures hovered near the tablet, having arrived earlier, observing the unfolding chaos.</p><p>From the west, streaks of escaping light sped towards the tablet. Some were faster than others, but fortunately, the number of fire spirits emerging from the ground wasn't overwhelming yet, so even those lagging behind didn't need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment. "Senior, please go ahead. I have a small matter to attend to."</p><p>"Be careful, Junior Brother Qin. The rate of the restrictions' collapse will certainly accelerate," Yun Youzi didn't pry, offering Qin Sang a word of caution before piloting his Spirit Bamboo flying boat towards the stone tablet.</p><p>Watching Yun Youzi's silhouette disappear, Qin Sang pondered briefly.  Then, with a flash, he vanished, moving in the opposite direction, stealthily traveling west for some distance before concealing himself along the path those escaping to the tablet would inevitably take.</p><p>Streaks of light flew overhead as the magma and fire spirits drew closer.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless.</p><p>Even after the last streak of light passed, Ren Hong was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang move.</p>
