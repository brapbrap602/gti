<h1></h1><p>Outside Tianpeng Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently for an entire day before a black streak of light flew out from the mountain. The old demon, Hunmo, took to the skies alone and departed. Not long after, the Great Sage Tianpeng led a group of demons out of the mountain, heading east in a different direction from Hunmo, continuing their campaign. Bi Fang was conspicuously among them.</p><p>After both parties had left, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows. He gazed at the demonic clouds drifting eastward and then glanced in the direction where Hunmo had departed. For an entire day, he had no idea what the old demon and the Great Sage were plotting.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to secretly follow them if Hunmo and the Great Sage Tianpeng were to go treasure hunting or engage in some scheme. He intended to seize the opportunity to intervene and turn their own methods against them. However, upon seeing this scene, Qin Sang speculated that the most likely scenario was that the timing wasn't right, and they had agreed to meet at a later date. He couldn't possibly keep tailing these two top-tier experts indefinitely, so he had no choice but to give up.</p><p>At this point, Bi Fang had also left, and there was no longer any need to remain here. After some thought, Qin Sang secretly contacted a spy from the Profound Heaven Palace and informed them about Hunmo's private meeting with the Great Sage. He then decided to let the matter rest.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang traversed the remaining areas of the demon realm before heading northward across the sea.</p><p>...</p><p>At the Edge of Heaven.</p><p>This was a solitary stone island suspended in the sea, close to the storm belt. The island was rugged, with towering peaks and jagged rocks, riddled with holes and scars. It was a desolate, lifeless place, bearing the marks of relentless hurricanes. Fortunately, the demons had not destroyed the island after occupying it.</p><p>At the highest peak, an iron sword was thrust upside down into the summit. The sword was covered in rust, its divine aura long faded, resembling a weathered and broken blade. It was much like the person who had once planted it here, as even the legends about this individual had gradually faded with time. Yet, the story and symbolism behind this sword still inspired awe and reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended to the Edge of Heaven, arriving at the spot where the Celestial Ascendant had once planted the sword. He was fortunate enough to pay his respects to the blade, bowing three times before it. After becoming a guest elder of the Profound Heaven Palace, Qin Sang had learned more about the deeds of the Celestial Ascendant.</p><p>Back then, after the Celestial Ascendant had challenged various sects with his sword and planted it at the Edge of Heaven, the turmoil had not ended. Two elders from the Profound Heaven Palace, along with other experts from various regions—including both righteous and demonic factions, as well as demon kings from the demon realm—had ventured to the North Star Realm. From that point on, they had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Not long after, gifts began to arrive at the sects of those individuals. Their heads, perfectly preserved, were placed in jade boxes and quietly appeared in the forbidden areas of their respective sects! This included the Profound Heaven Palace. The heads of the elders were returned to the Lingxiao Peak, where the then-leader of the Profound Heaven Palace, a late-stage Nascent Soul expert, was in seclusion. Yet, he had been completely unaware of the intrusion.</p><p>From that day forward, the North Sea was struck with terror, and no one dared to cross the forbidden line. The North Star Realm remained peaceful.</p><p>In a way, Qin Sang could be said to have inherited the legacy of the Celestial Ascendant.</p><p>...</p><p>After paying his respects at the sacred site, Qin Sang entered the Star Sand Archipelago. He shifted between his human and demon forms, seamlessly navigating between the two races. The situation in the Star Sand Archipelago was grim. The human race was now confined to a small corner, with most of the archipelago having become a demonic stronghold. Fortunately, the Great Sage Tianpeng had turned his attention toward the Profound Heaven Palace, giving the humans some breathing room.</p><p>Qin Sang claimed to be a special envoy from the Profound Heaven Palace and visited the Nascent Soul experts of the Star Sand Archipelago to discuss mutual support and resistance against the demons. He wasn't deceiving them, as he had discussed this matter with Shi Xue before coming.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qin Sang learned about many secret locations in the Star Sand Archipelago. He quickly toured the area but found no fragments of the Slaughter Sword. He only managed to acquire two decent-quality spirit herbs.</p><p>The experiences of this period confirmed Qin Sang's earlier speculation. The fragments of the Slaughter Sword were not randomly scattered but had been deliberately placed in specific locations for reasons unknown. These locations were likely ancient immortal palaces like the Purple Palace or the Seven Slaughter Hall. Smaller secret realms and forbidden areas were no longer worth his time.</p><p>There was also the possibility that, like the first fragment, it had been accidentally discovered by the founder of Shaohua Mountain and brought back to the sect. However, the chances of this were slim and would require a stroke of luck.</p><p>Recalling the locations of the first two fragments, both were hidden deep within secret realms, in extremely secluded areas. The founder of Shaohua Mountain had discovered the secret passage on Tian Mountain to obtain the first fragment. The second fragment had been placed in the Nether Valley atop Yitian Peak in the Seven Slaughter Hall, with its entrance hidden in the walls of an ancient palace, inaccessible by normal means.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang's greatest hope lay in the Profound Heaven Sacred Land. If the sacred land did not contain a fragment of the Slaughter Sword, he would have no choice but to leave the North Sea and head to the Central Continent to continue his search.</p><p>After touring the Star Sand Archipelago, Qin Sang planned to complete one final task in the demon realm before returning to the Crescent Moon Realm.</p><p>...</p><p>Southwest of the Demon Realm.</p><p>This area was close to the sea, with breathtaking scenery and enchanting landscapes. Mountains, rivers, and valleys were interconnected, with underground rivers forming a complex water system that eventually flowed into the sea. Deep within the mountains, streams cascaded down, creating a lively and vibrant atmosphere.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure quietly appeared. He looked around and silently flew to a higher vantage point to survey the rivers and valleys below. Based on the information he had gathered earlier, Qin Sang deduced that the cave of the Frogfish Demon should be hidden somewhere in this area.</p><p>However, this demon was extremely low-key, with no demonic soldiers under its command. It was also very cautious, and its cave was exceptionally well-hidden, with no one knowing its exact location. When Tong Lingyu went north, she managed to uncover Bi Fang and the Cunning Fox, but the Frogfish Demon remained elusive.</p><p>This demon had not followed the Great Sage Tianpeng in attacking the Profound Heaven Palace. It was unclear whether it had been frightened by the fates of Bi Fang and the Cunning Fox, but it had been completely silent in recent years.</p><p>A gentle breeze brushed Qin Sang's cheeks. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew out, fluttering its wings gently as it circled around Qin Sang affectionately. Qin Sang stroked the butterfly's soft wings and then activated his concealment technique, diving into the river. He descended to the riverbed, moving through the aquatic plants as he began his meticulous search.</p><p>To avoid alerting the demon, Qin Sang couldn't release his divine sense and had to rely on his own efforts to search every corner, using the Heavenly Eye's power to locate the Frogfish Demon's underwater lair.</p><p>Within a radius of a thousand miles, the underground water network was dense. Qin Sang, however, was extremely patient, searching every underground river and water channel tirelessly, inch by inch.</p><p>His efforts eventually paid off.</p><p>After more than a month, Qin Sang finally discovered something unusual in a deep underground pool. The pool was hidden at the bottom of an underground river, pitch black and devoid of light. The black stones at the pool's entrance had been smoothed by the flowing water. The river's current was calm here, but it carried an additional chill.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped upstream of the underground river, observing the deep pool. After a moment, a faint smile appeared on his lips. "It looks like a human technique, quite ingenious. Did the Frogfish Demon acquire this from the Boundless Sea?"</p><p>Hidden within the deep pool was a spiritual array. The method of setting up the array was clever, and the fluctuations of the array were extremely faint, specifically designed to counter divine sense. If Qin Sang had been standing on the surface, recklessly scanning with his divine sense, not only would he have struggled to detect the deep pool, but he would have also triggered the array, alerting the demon in its lair.</p><p>He had anticipated this and relied on the Heavenly Eye's power to avoid detection. After observing for a while, Qin Sang carefully retreated, moving away from the area to search elsewhere. He soon discovered another possible entrance.</p><p>This demon clearly understood the principle of having multiple escape routes. If things went south, it could flee at any moment. Qin Sang's expression turned thoughtful. His external avatar was not yet fully formed, so he couldn't split up to block all exits. Moreover, Qin Sang suspected that the Frogfish Demon's lair had more than just these two exits, making it futile to block them.</p><p>He decided to stop searching and returned to the deep pool, planning to secretly dismantle the array and then forcefully enter the lair! This was a confident approach.</p><p>With Qin Sang's mastery of array techniques and the assistance of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, understanding the intricacies of this spiritual array was not difficult. The key was to act swiftly when breaking the array, ensuring the Frogfish Demon couldn't escape.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware that this Frogfish Demon was formidable in the water, and he couldn't let it escape into the underground river. With this in mind, Qin Sang quickened his pace, returning to the vicinity of the deep pool and lying in wait.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched obediently on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings slightly spread. The patterns on its wings resembled a pair of true heavenly eyes, gazing intently at the deep pool.</p><p>This spiritual array wasn't top-tier, focusing primarily on countering divine sense. As a result, its other defenses were likely compromised. Qin Sang spent considerable effort deciphering the array's patterns but didn't act rashly. He mentally simulated countless scenarios, contemplating the most efficient way to dismantle the array.</p><p>As Qin Sang had anticipated, the array's defensive capabilities were lackluster. The Frogfish Demon clearly hadn't intended to create an impregnable lair but rather one that could be abandoned at a moment's notice.</p><p>However, dismantling the array wasn't the hard part. The challenge was to trap the Frogfish Demon in its lair before it could react. The only way was to strike with overwhelming force and end the battle swiftly!</p><p>With a flash from his Thousand Jun Ring, the Solar Divine Tree slowly rose. Its radiant red light was concealed by Qin Sang's techniques; otherwise, the underground river would have been dyed crimson. If even a trace of its aura leaked, the river would evaporate, and the underground waterway would dry up.</p><p>At this moment, nine divine birds stood proudly on the nine buds of the Solar Divine Tree! These birds were entirely crimson, their bodies composed of pure flame. The movement of their feathers was actually the flow of the Southern Bright Flame's aura, creating the illusion of feathers.</p><p>The form of these divine birds bore some resemblance to the legendary Vermilion Bird. Yet, with nine divine birds perched on the divine tree, the scene also evoked the myths of the Golden Crow and the Fusang Divine Tree.</p><p>Qin Sang had grown accustomed to calling them Solar Divine Birds.</p><p>Not long ago, the Solar Divine Birds had fully formed, signaling the completion of the treasure Qin Sang had long awaited! After such a prolonged wait, Qin Sang had become intimately familiar with the Solar Divine Tree. Since he had personally crafted this treasure, it was as if it were an extension of himself, requiring no further refinement.</p><p>The Solar Divine Birds were small and delicate, their forms light and graceful. Yet, the energy contained within them was enough to send shivers down one's spine! Even Qin Sang, as their master, felt a tingling sensation when in close proximity to the Solar Divine Tree, causing him to handle it with utmost care.</p><p>"Now, it's your time to shine!" Qin Sang murmured, his hand hovering beneath the divine tree. His gaze shifted among the nine divine birds before settling on the three at the top.</p><p>Mysterious white copper, green copper blocks, the Nine-Life Mystic Turtle Shell, and the Vermilion Bird's True Feather... These rare treasures had been combined to create this artifact, which was now about to accompany him into battle for the first time!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Qin Sang stored the Solar Divine Tree. He then awakened the Fat Silkworm, coaxing it, "Put in your best effort. If this demon has a poison core, it might be your opportunity."</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, still groggy, immediately perked up at these words. Its small eyes sparkled with determination as it wagged its tail, emitting a multicolored halo that transformed into a poison-resistant armor.</p><p>After making these preparations, Qin Sang summoned the Demonic Flame and allowed it to drift toward the deep pool with the current.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's wings trembled slightly, transmitting every subtle change in the spiritual array to Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stealthily approached the deep pool, his fingers twitching gently. As he moved, the Demonic Flame split into thin black threads, silently infiltrating the deep pool.</p><p>With the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang guided the Demonic Flame into the spiritual array without triggering any alarms. At this moment, the Demonic Flame formed a web within the array. Qin Sang's current approach was akin to using the Demonic Flame to set up a counter-array, a level of precision that would have been impossible before his divine sense had taken form.</p><p>Seeing that the time was right, Qin Sang softly commanded, "Open!"</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the lair...</p><p>Gems lay scattered like sand, and coral formed a forest. Pearls were embedded everywhere, creating a scene of opulence and grandeur.</p><p>The Frogfish Demon had reverted to its true form, lying on a bed crafted from a giant clam shell. Its head was extended forward, eyes closed, and mouth slightly open as it exhaled a green light. With each breath, the green light grew more intense and condensed further. Once the green light was refined into a thin strand, the demon would exhale a new one, repeating the process.</p><p>Unaware of the impending disaster, the demon continued its cultivation in peace.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud explosion echoed from one of the exits.</p><p>The lair shook violently.</p><p>Gems flew in all directions, coral branches snapped, and the entire cave was thrown into chaos.</p><p>Caught off guard, the Frogfish Demon nearly tumbled off its clam-shell bed. It quickly swallowed the green light, transformed back into human form, and sat up, its face filled with anger as it glared toward the source of the disturbance.</p><p>In the next moment, the demon's expression changed drastically.</p><p>Although it didn't see anyone, it noticed the black flames rising within the spiritual array.</p><p>The Demonic Flame's assault had instantly destroyed a significant portion of the array's restrictions, its power as terrifying as the demon remembered. The Frogfish Demon had a vivid memory of these black flames. During a three-on-one battle where it had held the upper hand, it had nearly been reduced to ashes by the flames!</p><p>"It's him!" the Frogfish Demon thought in horror.</p><p>This man had come for revenge, and he had dared to enter the demon realm!</p><p>After learning that Bi Fang had been cornered by the Profound Heaven Palace's grand elder and had only escaped by abandoning the Cunning Fox, the Frogfish Demon had begun to regret its actions. The human treasures might not have been of any use to them, and they had gained nothing while making powerful enemies.</p><p>Knowing it was no match for the intruder, the Frogfish Demon had no intention of resisting. With a wave of its hand, it gathered the treasures from its lair and prepared to flee through another exit.</p><p>At that moment, an even louder explosion resounded through the lair.</p><p>The deafening blast reverberated within the cave, causing the Frogfish Demon's head to ring. The dizziness it felt wasn't due to the noise but rather the impact of an unprecedented and terrifying force!</p><p>The Frogfish Demon's face was filled with terror.</p><p>Its eyes stung as if blinded.</p><p>Within its vision, everything disappeared, leaving only a blinding white light.</p><p>"What a lair!" Qin Sang's voice echoed calmly as he stepped into the cave, the Solar Divine Tree hovering behind him. Three of the divine birds were missing from the tree.</p><p>Though he appeared composed, Qin Sang was inwardly astonished. While he had tested the Solar Divine Tree's power upon its completion, the full force of its first deployment had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>With his divine sense taking form, Qin Sang could barely control three of the divine birds. Yet, they had effortlessly cleared the deep pool's spiritual array and blasted open the lair's entrance. Qin Sang privately estimated that if Tong Lingyu hadn't been holding back, the destructive power of the three divine birds' explosion would have far surpassed the might of the Fourfold Snake Seal in her hands!</p><p>It might even have reached thirty to forty percent of its full potential!</p><p>The cost, however, was that Qin Sang's true essence had been drained by nearly half in an instant, leaving him feeling hollow inside.</p>
