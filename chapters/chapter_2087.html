<h1>Chapter 2078: The Jade Yang Divine Milk</h1><p>The clan leader's son still felt a chill recalling how the message had reached him.  The person who had manipulated him so subtly was likely a powerful cultivator of the second stage of the Void Realm!</p><p>The presence of such a strong cultivator in the Changyou Clan territory, using such methods to contact them, what could it mean?  He dared not dwell on it.</p><p>Seeing his son's anxiety, the Changyou Clan leader frowned deeply.  "What is this flustered display? How can I entrust the leadership to you if you act like this?"</p><p>The clan leader's son hung his head in shame.</p><p>The Changyou Clan leader snorted, walking towards the manor exit. His figure faded, until he vanished without disturbing anyone within.</p><p>Beyond the manor lay the Sacred Lake, vast and blue.  An ancient stone temple shimmered faintly in the center, emanating a powerful aura. The clan's elite guards stood watch.</p><p>The Changyou Clan leader gazed at the temple, seemingly hesitant. Soon he turned into a wisp of smoke, speeding towards the edge of the sacred grounds alone, sending no message to the elders, summoning no guards.</p><p>Beyond the sacred ground lay a range of rolling hills, itself a sacred training place, but untouched by the Changyou Clan to avoid encroaching on the main grounds.  Pine trees filled the landscape, birds sang sweetly.</p><p>The Changyou Clan leader traversed the hills, then abruptly halted, materializing in mid-air, his gaze fixed ahead.</p><p>Atop a peak, a figure stood.  This person stood with their back to him, their form indistinct, shrouded in a mist.  Their features were impossible to discern, making it impossible to identify their tribe.</p><p>A glint flashed in the Changyou Clan leader's eyes as he secretly activated his spiritual sight, but the mist remained impenetrable.</p><p>To the Changyou Clan leader, the person on the mountain peak seemed to be the only thing in existence, or perhaps even the embodiment of existence itself. A moment before, he had not noticed this person, as if they had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>But the Changyou Clan leader was certain this person hadn't suddenly appeared; they had been there all along.  He could only see them when the person chose to be seen.</p><p>There was no need for testing; the cultivator's power was self-evident.</p><p>The Changyou Clan leader had not brought any elders because against a second-stage Void Realm cultivator, numbers were meaningless.  If the person harbored ill intent, he had no confidence in withstanding them even if he hid in the Sacred Lake.  Yet, the message had been delivered without harming him or his son, suggesting a degree of goodwill.</p><p>His expression grave, the Changyou Clan leader approached, bowing before the mysterious figure's back. "I do not know which senior has graced our humble clan with their presence. I am Min Zhuo, and I greet you."</p><p>"You have read the letter."</p><p>The mysterious figure slowly turned.</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart pounded.  Within the mist, a pair of deep eyes seemed to fix upon him, whether in kindness or malice, he couldn’t tell.</p><p>The mysterious person didn't reveal their identity, as Min Zhuo expected. He nodded slightly.</p><p>"Hehe…"</p><p>The mysterious person chuckled ambiguously. "You seem unconvinced by its contents."</p><p>"The letter speaks of a great calamity facing our clan, yet offers no source of the threat. It smacks of alarmist exaggeration, and I find it difficult to believe.  But this concerns the fate of my entire clan, and as clan leader, I must respond."</p><p>Min Zhuo raised his head, his tone neither humble nor arrogant. "Senior, could you enlighten me?"</p><p>The mysterious person gazed towards the northeast, saying softly, "What if your enemies now possessed more than one cultivator of the second stage of the Void Realm?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Min Zhuo was shocked.</p><p>The Changyou Clan’s enemies were only those otherworldly beings from the Foul Lands. There were certainly some exceptionally talented individuals amongst them, such as the Glass Fairy, but she would not have broken through to the second stage of the Void Realm so quickly.</p><p>He had felt the barrier himself, confirming that Qingling energy barely aided breakthroughs to the second stage of the Void Realm.  The Changyou Clan still had ancient legacies; what did those otherworldly beings have?</p><p>The suggestion that the otherworldly beings possessed more than one second-stage Void Realm cultivator was ludicrous!</p><p>Before Min Zhuo could refute, the mysterious person continued calmly, "Recently, a powerful demon cultivator arrived via a translocation array.  Using their terminology, it seems they were at the Void Refinement stage. This demon's whereabouts are unknown, but it’s likely they've headed east. If they encounter their own kind, do you think these otherworldly beings would align with this demon?"</p><p>Even Min Zhuo, with his calculating mind, couldn't help but change his expression at this news.</p><p>Rumors had circulated that the conflict between the Water and Heaven Departments extended beyond the otherworldly beings themselves, and the upper echelons of the Heaven Department had deliberately cultivated ties with the Eastern Sea Demons.</p><p>However, the otherworldly beings were not inherently welcoming to other races entering the Mist Sea, even those with amicable relations like the demons; their presence was rare. The various territories of the different otherworldly being clans were isolated by the mist currents, requiring translocation arrays for travel, so only powerful demons could enter the heart of the Mist Sea.</p><p>These powerful individuals are elusive, rarely seen by smaller tribes.  Therefore, the Changyou tribe isn't worried about the Storm Realm contacting the East Sea tribes. However, the Changyou aren't unprepared; they've been hunting down Storm Realm scouts, effectively containing them.</p><p>But they can't defend against a direct attack by a powerful demon.</p><p>"They are outsiders after all, perhaps hesitant to act rashly. But once they decide to attack you… heh…"</p><p>The mysterious person chuckled, "There's an ancient pact; Zhu Yan won't stand idly by if the Changyou are annihilated, but that's all. Do you think you and the elders will be spared? You started this conflict, and you—even your entire tribe—will bear the consequences. That's the rule.  The result? Your complete destruction, the Changyou becoming slaves."</p><p>The mysterious person spoke calmly, without any attempt to manipulate, simply stating a fact.</p><p>A terrifying fact that chilled Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted constantly. This news was horrifying; if it was true, the Changyou were on the brink of extinction.</p><p>But why would this person warn him? Was it simply out of kindness?</p><p>Who was this person?!</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>Min Zhuo opened his mouth, then saw the mysterious person raise their right hand. A white light flickered in their palm, revealing a jade bottle.</p><p>The bottle contained a drop of milky-white spiritual fluid, emitting a gentle white glow. Every three breaths, a flash of dark yellow light appeared, heavy and weighty, as if it weighed a ton.</p><p>Min Zhuo was startled, finding the fluid familiar. Then he remembered something and exclaimed, "Jade Sun Divine Milk!"</p><p>Jade Sun Divine Milk is a spiritual herb from the Mist Sea, said to be controlled by a powerful tribe, extremely rare, even rarer outside their control.  Smaller tribes like theirs couldn't even dream of obtaining it.</p><p>Min Zhuo needed external aid to break through to the second stage of the Void Realm, and he had considered Jade Sun Divine Milk, but quickly dismissed the idea; he was content if he could obtain other, less potent spiritual herbs.</p><p>The Jade Sun Divine Milk's value lies in its ability to aid breakthroughs and solidify one's foundation. He also noticed that the milk in the bottle was refined, a task only a second stage Void Realm expert could accomplish, making it even more potent.</p><p>In short, consuming this drop would greatly increase his chances of breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p>A flash of greed crossed Min Zhuo's eyes; the treasure was incredibly tempting, but he didn't lose his head.</p><p>He took a deep breath to calm himself. "What is the meaning of this, senior?"</p><p>"Consume the divine milk, break through to the second stage of the Void Realm, and perhaps you can survive this ordeal."</p><p>The bottle floated from the mysterious person's hand to the space between them.</p><p>Facing the easily obtainable divine milk, Min Zhuo's eyes burned with desire, but he remained clear-headed.</p><p>"The enemy has two second-stage Void Realm experts. Even if I break through, how could I be their opponent?"</p><p>The mysterious person said meaningfully, "In time, someone will come to aid you."</p><p>Min Zhuo's eyes widened; a suffocating feeling washed over him. He seemed to have fallen into a vast conspiracy.</p><p>He sensed it already; there was no such thing as a free lunch, especially a lunch this substantial. They wanted him and the Changyou to become their pawns!</p><p>Min Zhuo was silent. Even if he understood, what could he do? Could he refuse? Could he refuse the temptation of the Jade Sun Divine Milk?</p><p>"If I accept the Jade Sun Divine Milk…"</p><p>Min Zhuo's voice was dry.  "What does the senior intend for me to do?"</p><p>"Family blood feuds must be avenged. Do what needs to be done," the mysterious person said indifferently.</p><p>They took a step towards the mountain, vanishing instantly, leaving only one sentence behind.</p><p>"The divine milk will remain here. You can take it anytime."</p><p>The mountaintop was empty.</p><p>Min Zhuo gazed at the Jade Sun Divine Milk, wrestling with his decision.</p><p>Ultimately, he didn't reach for it. He turned and flew towards the Sacred Lake, leaving the milk behind.</p><p>It was clear that the mysterious person had placed a restriction on the milk; only Min Zhuo in the entire Changyou tribe could see it, so leaving it there wouldn't risk its theft.</p><p>If a second-stage Void Realm expert were to pass by and take it, it might not be a bad thing.</p><p>He needed time to think.</p><p>His son was still waiting outside the meditation chamber.  Seeing his father return safely, his expression relaxed as he hurried over. "Father…"</p><p>But his father ignored him, entering the chamber and immediately sealing it with an array.</p><p>The son was blocked outside, his heart growing increasingly anxious.</p><p>Inside the meditation chamber…</p><p>Min Zhuo sat cross-legged, the smoke entering his pores, calming him.</p><p>He carefully recalled every word and action of the mysterious person, and the meaning behind those words.  </p><p>Did the arrival of that powerful demon happen by coincidence, or was there a hidden motive?</p><p>What was the mysterious person's identity, why did they target the demon, pitting themselves and the demon against each other, and what was their ultimate goal?</p><p>And, what did these people know...?</p><p>Time flowed quietly, the lamp oil remaining undiminished.  After an unknown amount of time, Min Zhuo's expression finally showed a ripple, as if awakening from a dream.</p><p>His eyes slowly moved, gazing east, his expression profound. After a long while, his lips moved slightly, murmuring almost inaudibly.</p><p>"Daiyu Immortal Mountain..."</p><p>...</p><p>Luyě.</p><p>Now, Luyě had been completely renovated. Most of the palaces and pavilions had been moved to lower areas, with bamboo forests rustling, returning to a tranquil atmosphere.</p><p>The disciples of the Qingyang Sect were also driven out of Luyě, each seeking out spiritual mountains and peaks to establish temporary dwellings.</p><p>Currently, the Qingyang Sect has no external defenses.  They won't be considered on solid footing until the first layer of the protective mountain formation is complete;  the entire sect is busy with the work.</p><p>Li Yufu and Shen Chen were currently in a quiet room in Luyě, working together to refine array artifacts.</p><p>Shen Chen's position as the leader of the Tian Gong League speaks to his undeniable skill in the art of artifact refinement, but some artifacts are too complex, still requiring Li Yufu's assistance.</p><p>They sat opposite each other, a water orb floating between them, emitting a faint blue glow.</p><p>Inside the orb was a spirit flag, its surface plain white and empty.</p><p>Shen Chen's expression was serious as he sent streams of hand seals towards the water orb. Li Yufu only needed to watch Shen Chen and mimic his movements, his task significantly easier.</p><p>After absorbing hundreds of hand seals, the water orb finally showed signs of activity; the surface rippled, and thin streams of water formed inside, swirling rapidly around the spirit flag.</p><p>Suddenly, one stream of water, like a whip, lashed out at the flag.  The flag's surface trembled, swallowing the water stream and displaying a blue mark.</p><p>As this continued, more and more marks appeared, forming an incredibly complex pattern, finally erupting in a dazzling blue light.</p><p>When the blue light faded, the spirit flag fell into Shen Chen's hands. Its surface was now a light blue, soft as water, surpassing the finest silks in the world.</p><p>"Finally, one is complete. Thank you for your help, senior brother!"</p><p>Shen Chen took a deep breath; he had wasted a considerable amount of materials, feeling immense pressure.</p><p>Li Yufu, observing this, offered comfort: "Junior brother, you needn't be hasty. With your abilities, simply focus on understanding, proceeding methodically, and you will surely complete them all."</p><p>Shen Chen shook his head. He considered this a test from his master and was determined to show his best.</p><p>Putting away the flag, Shen Chen arranged more materials and began to study the next type of array flag.</p><p>At that moment, Li Yufu's expression shifted as he looked outside. "Distinguished guests have arrived. I will return later, senior brother."</p><p>He flew out of Luyě and saw a crane carriage approaching from the horizon. The crane's wings were pure white, majestic and divine.  A refined Daoist sat on the carriage, gazing at the ground.  Li Yufu flew forward.</p><p>The Daoist also saw him and stopped the carriage.</p><p>"Greetings, True Monarch."</p><p>Li Yufu bowed respectfully.</p><p>The visitor was indeed Crane Ridge True Monarch, the current head of the Eight Scenic Views, a person of high status and profound cultivation.</p><p>Currently, the Ganlu Zen Monastery, the Eight Scenic Views, and the Heavenly Hao Tower formed the Three Teach Alliance, still the dominant force in the Central Plains.</p><p>Li Yufu understood that the other party must have learned of the Qingyang Sect establishing its mountain gate here and had come to test them.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect hadn't concealed their actions. Huan Hen had been recalled from the front lines, Shen Chen had taken leave from the Tian Gong League, and the remaining Qingyang Sect disciples, except those responsible for defense, had mostly been summoned here.</p><p>Only Yun Nu remained behind in the North Sea.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect's re-establishment of its mountain gate had spread throughout the Storm World, and several groups of cultivators had already visited in this period.</p><p>Crane Ridge True Monarch rose, returned the bow, his tone slightly tinged with admiration. "Sect Leader Li, I didn't expect your sect to have established such a magnificent scene in such a short time.  It seems you will soon transform this place into an immortal mountain and blessed land. I am impressed. Even without a completed protective mountain formation, its complexity is evident, and must certainly be extremely profound—is it the handiwork of the Glass Fairy?"</p><p>Everyone knew the Qingyang Sect would re-establish its mountain gate; the small Luyě was too constricted. With the battlefield currently in a stalemate and the Changyou clan's advantage dwindling, the Qingyang Sect's actions were expected.</p><p>However, the Qingyang Sect's choice to establish its mountain gate near the Central Plains made it a matter of great importance to them.</p>
