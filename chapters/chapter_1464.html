<h1>Chapter 1456: The Unfaithful Man (4k, two-in-one)</h1><p>“I’ll go and negotiate with him. We’ll make a decision after the Grand Elder returns.”</p><p>Elder Lan mused for a moment, then added,</p><p>“That person had several chances to kill Shi Xue, but he didn't. He probably guessed why we were intercepting him – to capture him alive and learn about the artifact's origins.</p><p>“Although the Hunmo Old Man startled him away, it was clearly a show of mercy.  It suggests he doesn't want to become sworn enemies with Xuantian Palace unless absolutely necessary. At least, he doesn't act recklessly like a typical member of the demonic path.</p><p>“His cultivation is only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.  Once he understands the seal can't be opened, possessing it would do him more harm than good. He might even approach us proactively, leading to a potential trade.</p><p>“Unless absolutely necessary, there's no need to cooperate with the Hunmo Old Man and provoke such a top-tier expert. We’d not only be used by him against his enemies but also invite a wolf into our house.</p><p>“Of course, we could feign an alliance with the Hunmo Old Man, creating a show of force to pressure that person. But we must prevent him from turning the tables on us. This requires careful judgment, and it's a serious matter; the Grand Elder must decide.</p><p>“This concerns the artifact. We mustn't risk ruining everything through clumsy attempts.”</p><p>Observing the battle between the Hunmo Old Man and Qin Sang, Elder Lan, seeing no clear opportunity to directly intervene, quickly assessed the situation in his mind, considering various possibilities and weighing the pros and cons.</p><p>Qin Sang's parting words were particularly influential. While seemingly a warning, Elder Lan detected a subtext.</p><p>Elder Mei nodded, agreeing with Elder Lan's assessment.</p><p>Previously, with the artifact's whereabouts unknown, their biggest fear was that a traitor would succeed, hence their risky collaboration with the Hunmo Old Man.</p><p>Now, having confirmed the artifact wasn't with the traitor, nor in the hands of the Nine-Headed Great Sage, they could afford to calmly strategize in the short term.</p><p>They remained vigilant towards the Hunmo Old Man.</p><p>Their cooperation before the Demon Assembly was already extremely risky. During the recent battle, the Hunmo Old Man was lurking nearby, remaining hidden and clearly harboring ulterior motives.</p><p>Elder Mei glanced behind, signaling the summoning of all Yuan Ying cultivators and Enforcement Hall members.</p><p>Elder Lan carefully chose his words, steadied himself, and stepped forward to meet the Hunmo Old Man.</p><p>…</p><p>Nightfall.</p><p>On the calm sea, a deserted island stood silently.</p><p>A slightly ethereal figure suddenly appeared on the shore, looked around, then darted into the forest, moving silently without disturbing any insects or animals.</p><p>Soundlessly, the figure stopped before an ancient tree, massive enough to encompass dozens of people, waving out spiritual flags that sank into the ground.  The tree and the figure vanished together.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Qin Sang entered the tree hollow, sat cross-legged, and let out a long sigh.</p><p>After shaking off the Hunmo Old Man, Qin Sang didn't go to Dan Ding Mountain but changed course, flying for a while before finding this inconspicuous island.</p><p>“I’ll go there later.  True Person Yinquan should still be here.  I’ll ask them to stay one more day.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>Then, recalling the end of the chase, he chuckled wryly, “I didn't expect the Hunmo Old Man to be driven off by the Tianpeng Great Sage. Using the Thunder Escape technique requires the Tian Yao Transformation.  It’s impossible to suppress one's demonic aura while fleeing at full speed.  The Tianpeng Great Sage was likely attracted by the demonic aura. As I expected, the more chaotic the situation, the better it is for me. But this is too chaotic.  Indeed, plans never survive contact with reality…”</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his temples in frustration, closing his eyes to recall the details of the chaotic fight.</p><p>According to the original plan, the goal was to test whether Xuantian Palace could sense the mysterious ice box and its range.</p><p>Upon discovering that Xuantian Palace's personnel were not strong enough, Qin Sang decided to capture the woman in green, which led to a series of unexpected events.</p><p>“Wait! The Hunmo Old Man and Xuantian Palace’s reactions don't seem like those of sworn enemies.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and flickering.</p><p>If, as rumored, the Hunmo Old Man had slaughtered several Yuan Ying cultivators, even Xuantian Palace, no matter how tolerant, shouldn't react this way.</p><p>Furthermore, the Xuantian Palace Yuan Ying cultivators were clearly positioned separately, surrounding Hunmo Island. Such high-profile actions, dividing their forces, were clearly inviting their own demise.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his palm, revealing the mysterious ice box.</p><p>He couldn't open the seal, but that didn't mean the traitor couldn't.</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a long time, deep in thought.  He murmured to himself, "Xuan Tian Gong fears the seal will be broken. They've joined forces with the Hun Mo Elder, manipulating the Wan Mo Conference to bring the traitors out into the open. But how can they be sure the Hun Mo Elder won't be greedy?"</p><p>*Tap tap tap…*</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his fingers on the ice box. "Unless there's a powerful figure the Hun Mo Elder fears—either the Xuan Tian Gong Master himself, or some hidden expert.  For some reason, that person hasn't appeared."</p><p>He considered this the most plausible explanation. Otherwise, if the Hun Mo Elder had malicious intent, those people wouldn't be able to restrain him.</p><p>"Xuan Tian Gong has deep roots. Besides the Master, there are other unknown experts. My plan and choices weren't wrong; the intelligence was faulty.  That's why I was forced to confront the Hun Mo Elder directly, using demonic fire to lure him into the maze formation, thus revealing my identity."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, but showed no fear.</p><p>This battle forced the Hun Mo Elder to reveal his shape-shifting ability, a significant gain. It would prevent him from being outmaneuvered by that ability in future encounters, preventing greater losses.</p><p>The current issue is the extent of the cooperation between Xuan Tian Gong and the Hun Mo Elder, and the possibility of them continuing to hunt him.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  The expressions of shock and apprehension on the faces of Xuan Tian Gong's people when the Hun Mo Elder appeared weren't feigned.</p><p>"They each have their own agendas!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled softly, his expression relaxed as he looked at the mysterious ice box.</p><p>Then, he opened his other hand, revealing the ice bead secretly given to him by Chen Yan.  In that situation, Chen Yan had proactively communicated with him, requesting a private meeting and offering the bead, which could temporarily suppress the mysterious ice box's fluctuations.</p><p>He placed the bead and the ice box together.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, suspecting Chen Yan might not have been powerless when he retreated; perhaps she let him go. Of course, if he had insisted on capturing the woman in green, Chen Yan would have definitely intervened.</p><p>He couldn't fathom Chen Yan's intentions. He didn't believe their past entanglements could explain this level of action.</p><p>"Could she be a traitor, aiming for the treasure within the mysterious ice box?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered this possibility, feeling a little sorry for Xuan Tian Gong.</p><p>On second thought, Chen Yan had cultivated on Shao Hua Mountain before reaching the Yuan Ying stage, only returning to Xuan Tian Gong afterward. She probably didn't have much loyalty to her sect.</p><p>The question was, what terms could she offer?</p><p>Qin Sang considered this. Regardless of Chen Yan's motives, he decided to wait and see, using her to find out what exactly was sealed inside.</p><p>He channeled his true energy, enveloped the ice bead, and carefully sensed it, confirming there were no problems.</p><p>Then, he set up several layers of isolating restrictions before activating the power within the bead.</p><p>The bead melted into a puff of white gas.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang felt an extremely cold aura released. In an instant, the true energy that had touched the bead seemed to freeze, surprising him greatly.</p><p>Carefully, he guided a trace of the extremely cold aura towards the mysterious ice box.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang confirmed that this aura wouldn't cause the seal to change before proceeding.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The white gas enveloped the mysterious ice box, and wisps of the aura seeped into the seal.</p><p>Throughout this process, Qin Sang closely monitored the mysterious ice box.</p><p>The white gas emitted a special fluctuation. Under its influence, the seal underwent a change Qin Sang had never witnessed before—a gradual solidification. This was something he had been unable to achieve using countless methods.</p><p>Finally, the white gas on the surface of the mysterious ice box disappeared, with no significant changes to the box itself.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses.  With the help of the white gas's impact, he vaguely perceived the seal's unique properties, confirming the bead's ability to suppress it. However, he couldn't replicate this unique treasure, nor did he know how.</p><p>The suppression wasn't complete. If anyone from Xuan Tian Gong came to the outside of the tree hollow, they could still sense the mysterious ice box, though the range was limited and the impact minimal.</p><p>Furthermore, the seal was constantly resisting. Once the bead's power was exhausted, it would recover.</p><p>He held it, examining it for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang stored the mysterious ice box in his Qian Jun Ring, took out spirit pills and spirit stones, and meditated to recover.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang flew out of the deserted island, checked his direction, and vanished into the distance.</p><p>…</p><p>Southwest of Hun Mo Island lies an archipelago.</p><p>Dozens of islands, large and small, are scattered across this sea area.</p><p>The archipelago is spiritually barren, so only ordinary people live there.  Commoners occupy several of the larger islands, with numerous cities, making them relatively prosperous.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared silently above a city, holding the Dan Ding Order. After observing for a while, he stealthily entered the city and arrived at a shop.</p><p>As he landed, the door opened soundlessly, and Yinquan Zhenren's voice came from within, "Daoist Qin, please come in!"</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly before stepping inside.</p><p>"Is this also your sect's property?  Daoist, your backup plan isn't on this island, is it?" Qin Sang looked around, his gaze falling on Yinquan Zhenren who emerged to greet him.</p><p>"The Dan Ding Sect has a weak foundation in the Boundless Sea and cannot be too conspicuous. Ordinary people are easy to conceal, sometimes more useful than cultivators.  Our real preparations are not here, to avoid harming innocent people.  Since I hadn't received any warning from Daoist Qin, we withdrew as planned," Yinquan Zhenren explained.</p><p>While speaking, Yinquan Zhenren sized up Qin Sang. "Daoist Qin, did you encounter any problems?"</p><p>Qin Sang calmly retorted, "It seems, Zhenren, you have something to say."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was completely unharmed, Yinquan Zhenren nodded silently and frankly admitted, "I just received news that a mysterious expert, somehow offended the Hun Mo Old Man, was pursued for hundreds of miles and yet managed to escape. I was wondering if that mysterious expert was Daoist Qin. Daoist Luan and the others haven't left yet, they wish to meet Daoist Qin. However, I figured if it was you, you probably wouldn't want to see anyone right now, so I arranged for them to stay elsewhere."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The Dan Ding Sect was well-informed, but they only heard about the pursuit.</p><p>His attack on Xuan Tian Palace and trapping the Hun Mo Old Man with the Maze Formation didn't take long.  Few people probably witnessed or understand the entire sequence of events.</p><p>The real sensation was the chase that followed.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether Xuan Tian Palace and the Hun Mo Old Man would spread the news.</p><p>"Even if I had the ability, I wouldn't dare to provoke that old demon. Zhenren, if you find out the identity of that expert, please don't forget to introduce me," Qin Sang laughed, shaking his head.</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren glanced at him and chuckled, "Indeed, I was overthinking."</p><p>Regardless of whether he believed him or not, Qin Sang didn't say more and took out the jade slip containing the ancient formulas.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren was surprised to see the far greater compensation than agreed upon and looked at Qin Sang in astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I still have another transaction to complete, and I would like to ask Zhenren to stay another day. As per our previous agreement, the remaining ancient formulas are the payment for this time. If I need Zhenren and Daoist Luan and the others, there will be further rewards! Rest assured, Zhenren, the person I’m dealing with is not the Hun Mo Old Man."</p><p>Yinquan Zhenren hesitated for a moment before taking the jade slip. "Very well, I was planning to play a game of Go with Daoist Luan tonight; our game was unfinished."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Yinquan Zhenren to suspect him and still agree so readily.</p><p>Could the Dan Ding Mountain sect master be nearby?</p><p>Or perhaps they were confident in their arrangements.</p><p>After exchanging a few more words with Yinquan Zhenren, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of Hun Mo Island, on an island not controlled by the Hun Mo Old Man, there was a large city inhabited by cultivators.</p><p>Liuli sat cross-legged in a quiet room, her eyes closed, still as a statue.</p><p>The room was filled with cold air, yet her face was flushed, her eyelids twitching as if she was enduring some pain.  It took quite a while before she gradually returned to normal.</p><p>At this moment, the room's restriction was triggered.  Liuli awoke from her meditative state and saw her senior sister entering.</p><p>Shi Xue saw Liuli's questioning look. Knowing her junior sister was usually taciturn, she huffed, "Several elders have decided not to split up our forces, to avoid repeating past mistakes. We will temporarily appease the Hun Mo Old Man, and wait for the Grand Elder's return before making a decision. They said that guy has been merciful, leaving room for us...but why didn’t I feel it! My Winter's Frost Talisman, my two protective treasures...by their logic, should I thank him?"</p><p>Shi Xue grew increasingly agitated, her brows furrowed.</p><p>Liuli remained silent for a moment before saying, "The sect will compensate us."</p><p>"I hope the Grand Elder will help me get revenge!"</p><p>Shi Xue lowered her head, knowing that she couldn't avenge herself, and sighed helplessly.</p><p>She looked up at Liuli, hesitated for a moment, closed the room, and sealed it with soundproofing restrictions.  "Junior Sister, is there anything you want to tell me?"</p><p>Chen Yan was startled.</p><p>Shi Xue stared into her eyes seriously. "Junior Sister, you may deceive others, but you can't deceive me. Your Ice Soul Radiance is about to reach completion; it shouldn't collapse so easily!"</p><p>Seeing Chen Yan remain silent, Shi Xue suddenly raised her voice, "I know you cultivated the Ice Soul Radiance to use the ice soul to seal your emotions, severing romantic attachments to stabilize your Dao heart! Only a severe disturbance and shaking of the Dao heart would lead to the collapse of the Ice Soul Radiance! Before I saw you, I always thought that romantic love was merely a shackle imposed on themselves by those short-sighted, ignorant people who don't understand the Dao. I never imagined that even Yuan Ying cultivators could be troubled by love!"</p><p>"He... is that the heartless man?"</p><p>Shi Xue looked at Chen Yan with pity.  Thinking of that hateful figure, she gritted her teeth, old and new grievances surging in her heart.</p>
