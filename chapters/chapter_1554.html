<h1>Chapter 1545: The Xie Family Ancestor</h1><p>Having advanced to the fourth transformation, equivalent to the Nascent Soul realm, the Fat Silkworm seemed to have not comprehended any new divine abilities, only possessing the ability to ward off poisons.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that it would at least be able to utilize poison offensively, gaining a certain degree of combat prowess.</p><p>Even something akin to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye Divine Light could play a crucial role in battles.</p><p>Yet, the Fat Silkworm could only demonstrate its usefulness in special environments like the Three Poison Lands of the Seven Kills Hall, or when encountering poison-wielding adversaries like the Frogfish.</p><p>How could such a spirit insect survive alone in the perilous world of cultivation?</p><p>Coerced by Qin Sang, the Fat Silkworm spat out several clusters of seven-colored halos, its tongue lolling out from exhaustion, its eyes glazed over, only capable of thickening its poison-resistant carapace.</p><p>Qin Sang helplessly gave up and turned to check on Ya Gu's condition.</p><p>With just a glance, Qin Sang had a feeling that Ya Gu was different.</p><p>But this change wasn't outwardly apparent.</p><p>She appeared the same as before, cheeks rosy, eyelids tightly shut, breathing evenly, still a sleeping beauty.</p><p>The change originated from her divine soul.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly perceive that Ya Gu's divine soul had become more stable.</p><p>It was evidently related to the Fat Silkworm. With the Fat Silkworm's advancement, the 'anchor' had become firmer. Even facing the raging storms in the darkness, Ya Gu could tightly grasp the lifeline connecting her to the light.</p><p>Perhaps, there were other reasons unknown to Qin Sang.</p><p>The connection between Ya Gu and the Fat Silkworm was far closer than he had imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu couldn't respond yet, her condition had significantly improved. If it weren't for the incident at the Seven Kills Hall, she would undoubtedly be in even better shape, perhaps even awake by now.</p><p>There was finally hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed the Fat Silkworm's head. If Ya Gu could be awakened, even if the Fat Silkworm didn't possess any divine abilities, raising it wouldn't have been in vain.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Finally free, the Fat Silkworm eagerly burrowed into Ya Gu's brow, falling into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in place, not hurrying to leave.</p><p>He hadn't strayed too far from the tribulation site, intending to see if any cultivators would be alerted by the heavenly tribulation and come to investigate.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's tribulation was unexpected and too hasty, making it difficult to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>A fourth transformation spirit insect was undoubtedly a rare existence in the cultivation world. Once news of it spread, it was likely to attract Nascent Soul cultivators seeking to capture it, or even draw the attention of major sects.</p><p>As Qin Sang had predicted,</p><p>After a while, two streaks of light flew from afar. They were two male cultivators, one old and one young, appearing like grandfather and grandson, but both possessing considerable cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the younger cultivator's cultivation was higher, surprisingly at the mid-Gold Core stage, while the elder was only slightly weaker.</p><p>“Two Gold Core cultivators drawn here so easily, it seems the Immortal Sects in Fudù Prefecture are quite influential…”</p><p>Qin Sang observed their movements, thinking to himself.</p><p>The two headed directly towards the tribulation site.</p><p>Although the tribulation clouds had dispersed, the Heavenly Might carried by the tribulation lightning hadn't completely vanished, and Qin Sang couldn't completely erase this Heavenly Might.</p><p>The two were experienced and, before getting close, sensed this Heavenly Might and immediately recognized it.</p><p>“Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>They exclaimed in unison, exchanging a look of astonishment.</p><p>They had been occupied with another matter earlier, unable to witness the tribulation lightning directly. Sensing the unusual fluctuations of spiritual energy here, they decided on a whim to investigate, never expecting that someone had undergone a tribulation here.</p><p>It was common knowledge that only Nascent Soul cultivators were qualified to trigger heavenly tribulations.</p><p>For a moment, both felt a chill down their spines, regretting their recklessness, and subconsciously wanting to flee.</p><p>However, they had already seen the scene at the tribulation site.</p><p>Scorched earth stretched everywhere; the mountaintop was practically leveled by the tribulation lightning. The entire mountain was in ruins, partly due to the tribulation lightning and partly due to Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>The destruction caused by the heavenly tribulation was evident, but the figure of the person who underwent the tribulation was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Recalling that the thunder had not lasted long,</p><p>Could it be that the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator had failed the tribulation?</p><p>Exchanging another glance, unable to resist the immense temptation, they boldly approached, meticulously searching the area. Failing to find any Nascent Soul relics, they couldn't help but feel greatly disappointed.</p><p>“Let’s quickly report back to Senior Martial Brother, the Sect Leader.  We don't know which Nascent Soul senior passed through and underwent a tribulation here. Let the sect report it to the Six Void Sect; perhaps they can find some clues,” the younger cultivator said.</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing, “That's the right course of action.  Regardless of that senior's origins, it has nothing to do with us.  What a pity, not even a shard remains under the heavenly tribulation!”</p><p>“That senior might not have necessarily failed the tribulation. Have either of us ever witnessed a true heavenly tribulation?”</p><p>The younger cultivator shook his head, sealed the area around the mountain peak with a formation, called out to the elder, and flew away on his flying light.</p><p>Qin Sang stood not far from them.</p><p>The two were completely unaware that their entire conversation had fallen into someone else's ears.</p><p>Confirming that the two hadn't seen the silver tribulation lightning and had been misled into believing it was a cultivator's tribulation, Qin Sang didn't intend to do anything to them, allowing them to leave.</p><p>News of a Nascent Soul tribulation would disrupt the situation in Fudù Prefecture, but it wouldn't get out of control and might not necessarily be a bad thing.</p><p>“Six Void Sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured the three words, his figure flickering and disappearing.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang returned to Fudù Prefecture and chose an elegant dwelling in the Six Prefectures Hall, awaiting Zhou Jin's arrival.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as promised.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed and bowed deeply, “Greetings, Senior Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “I didn't expect to be gone for nearly ten years.  Have you remained in Fudù Prefecture all these years? Have you discovered anything?”</p><p>Zhou Jin, worried about Ruan Yu's illness and having had no news of Qin Sang for nearly ten years, feared that the senior had met with an accident or had forgotten the matter, spending his days in anxiety, yet not daring to slack off.</p><p>Fortunately, the worst-case scenario hadn't occurred.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke rapidly, “This junior followed your instructions. After leaving Ze Prefecture, I rushed to this area to investigate news of Pú Mountain and the Xie family…”</p><p>Pú Mountain, the Xie family.</p><p>They were related to the superior cultivation sanctuary recorded by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The sanctuary was named Clear Void Illusion Realm and was located on Pú Mountain.</p><p>The Xie family once boasted two Nascent Soul cultivators, holding a prominent position even in the talent-rich Central Continent. The Clear Void Illusion Realm was extremely well-hidden, always controlled by the Xie family, unknown to outsiders.</p><p>The Clear Void Illusion Realm not only served as a cave dwelling but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie family descendants had painstakingly researched it, but they were unable to unlock the secret until one of the Xie family's Nascent Soul cultivators met Xiao Xiangzi. Seeing his unique divine abilities, they invited him into the Clear Void Illusion Realm, finally unraveling the secret.</p><p>The jade slip didn't detail what benefits the three received in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>Regrettably, just as they deciphered the secret and prepared to divide the treasures, the Xie family ancestor, blinded by greed, attempted to kill Xiao Xiangzi and seize the treasures for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi certainly hadn't reached the Deity Transformation stage at the time, otherwise the Xie family ancestor wouldn't have acted so recklessly.</p><p>Even so, both Xie family Nascent Soul cultivators were ultimately slain by Xiao Xiangzi in retaliation.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't exterminate the entire Xie family, but in his fury, he wasn't willing to let them off so easily. He personally sealed the Clear Void Illusion Realm, preventing future Xie family descendants from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal occurred constantly in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't think his actions were inappropriate.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiangzi's killing intent, nearly driving him to slaughter the entire Xie family, bringing him to the brink of demonic possession. This incident jolted him awake, making him aware of his inner demons. It was this event that prompted him to travel extensively, refine Soul Calming Incense, and address the hidden danger in time, allowing him the opportunity to advance to Deity Transformation.</p><p>However, when he later reflected on his past cultivation journey, he realized that the other Xie family Nascent Soul cultivator initially hadn't intended to betray him, but had been coerced by the Xie family ancestor, forced to comply.</p><p>Since the other cultivator had chosen to attack him, regardless of their true intentions, Xiao Xiangzi couldn't hold back.</p><p>Nevertheless, the rage stemming from the betrayal subsided considerably.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi recorded this matter, requesting that whoever obtained the jade slip travel to the Central Continent, locate the Xie family, and, if the Clear Void Illusion Realm's restrictions remained, open it and return it to the Xie family, settling this karmic debt.</p><p>Qin Sang dispatched Zhou Jin to find the Xie family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiangzi's request, and secondly, so that he could cultivate in the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>The world had changed drastically over time, with place names shifting and powers rising and falling.  Just like the destroyed cave dwelling in the Sky Rift Valley and the renamed Zhúlán Temple, even if the Xie family no longer existed and the Clear Void Illusion Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>“After arriving here, this junior traveled throughout Fudù Prefecture and the three surrounding prefectures, but couldn't find Pú Mountain. Later, this junior learned that after Zhuō Prefecture was incorporated into the Nineteen Prefectures of Yānyǔ, Mount Bùniàn had overseen a large-scale geomantic survey, dividing Zhuō Prefecture into various prefectures and changing many place names. This junior then sought out ancient texts…”</p><p>Zhou Jin's tone was light and cheerful, clearly indicating a discovery, “Three years ago, this junior finally found the words 'Pú Mountain' in an ancient text. After much verification, it was confirmed that Pú Mountain is indeed within Fudù Prefecture, now known as Luóyān Mountain! However, the owner of Luóyān Mountain is no longer the Xie family, but the Luóyān Sect.”</p><p>“Luóyān Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, “Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character 'Luó' at their waists?”</p><p>The two individuals attracted by the Fat Silkworm's tribulation bore such jade pendants.</p><p>Pú Mountain had indeed changed hands, but he didn't know if the Luóyān Sect had discovered the Clear Void Illusion Realm.</p><p>“Has Senior met disciples of the Luóyān Sect?”</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded, “The Luóyān Sect possesses numerous experts.  This junior dared not act openly, only investigating the relationship between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie family in secret.  Later, this junior discovered that Luóyān Mountain had been forcibly seized from the Xie family by the Luóyān Sect, and the Xie family was compelled to relocate from Pú Mountain, their family declining as a result.”</p><p>With the fall of their two Nascent Soul ancestors and the loss of the Clear Void Illusion Realm, the Xie family lost the foundation of their prosperity, declining from their peak.</p><p>It was incredibly difficult for them to survive until now, their bloodline unbroken, thanks to the stability of the Central Continent.</p><p>Upon learning of the Xie family's whereabouts, Zhou Jin immediately sought them out.</p><p>Now, the Xie family had been reduced to an ordinary cultivation family, their current clan leader only at the Foundation Establishment realm. Their ancestral land on Pú Mountain had been seized, its name even changed, and they dared not utter a word of protest.</p><p>"This junior deliberately approached the Xie family and learned something," Zhou Jin paused, "When the Xie family relinquished Pú Mountain, they made a deal with the Luóyān Sect. Now, the agreed upon time has long passed, and the Luóyān Sect shows no intention of returning it.  If Senior wishes to help the Xie family reclaim Pú Mountain, we can proceed from this point."</p><p>Zhou Jin now mistakenly believed Qin Sang to be a descendant of the Xie family, returning to their ancestral land to seek justice for his family.</p><p>“Is the Luóyān Sect very powerful?”</p><p>Qin Sang countered.</p><p>Judging by Zhou Jin's tone, it seemed he couldn't force the Luóyān Sect to comply and return Pú Mountain to the Xie family through sheer cultivation strength.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully replied, "The Luóyān Sect's leader is only at the late Gold Core stage. Senior could easily annihilate them. However, there's another matter to be wary of. The Luóyān Sect is backed by the Six Void Sect.  The deal between the Luóyān Sect and the Xie family was witnessed by someone sent by the Six Void Sect.  This junior has been investigating the connection between them and discovered that the Luóyān Sect leader has a close relationship with the Six Void Sect.  The Six Void Sect has three Nascent Soul elders and is a powerful force, the dominant power in the surrounding prefectures.  Even Mount Bùniàn finds it difficult to interfere, and the Prefecture Governor of Fudù Prefecture can't control matters outside the Prefecture City.”</p><p>Zhou Jin had been diligent, even investigating the difficulties Qin Sang might face.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Qin Sang was quite satisfied with Zhou Jin, praising him and keeping his promise. He took out the jade slip recording the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Overjoyed, Zhou Jin quickly reached out with both hands to receive them. Opening the jade box, he saw a spirit herb inside and looked up in astonishment.</p><p>"This Black Essence Grass is the main ingredient in the formula. I discovered it by chance in the Western Desert. This herb is precious, and it would take you at least ten years to find it yourself, which could delay the treatment."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, looking at Zhou Jin, "I'm currently short-handed. If you're willing, you can bring Ruan Yu to Pú Mountain for cultivation when you return."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Zhou Jin knelt and kowtowed, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired about the details from Zhou Jin, pondering his subsequent plans.</p><p>If it were only the Luóyān Sect, he could simply visit them and drive them down the mountain, minimizing the impact. Now that the Six Void Sect was involved, he needed to plan carefully.</p><p>Of the Six Void Sect's three Nascent Soul cultivators, only one was at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Bringing his avatar to attack them would be satisfying, but he had to consider the subsequent repercussions.</p><p>In the Central Continent, regardless of one's cultivation level, one couldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Moreover, it was unclear whether the Clear Void Illusion Realm had been exposed.  If it involved a dispute over the cultivation sanctuary, it would be even more troublesome.</p><p>After some deliberation,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie family first.</p><p>…</p><p>Driven from Pú Mountain by the Luóyān Sect, the Xie family's strength was insufficient to seize a good spiritual vein, only finding a low-grade spiritual vein to settle on.</p><p>This further accelerated the Xie family's decline, their accumulated wealth almost entirely depleted.  By now, even their esteemed clan leader hadn't broken through to the Gold Core stage, trapped at the False Core realm.</p><p>However, thanks to their previous foundation, the Xie family's protective formation was quite powerful.</p><p>"Clan Leader Xie, an old friend has come to visit."</p><p>Arriving at the Xie family's fortress, Zhou Jin channeled his true essence and called out loudly.</p><p>The sound reached the Xie family.</p><p>Before long, the mist parted to the sides, and a figure emerged, none other than the Xie family head, Xie An, who possessed a rather distinguished air.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest, what a rare guest," Xie An strode forward, extremely welcoming.  Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, and unable to discern his cultivation, his heart skipped a beat, "This Fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed and said, "This is Senior Qin."</p><p>"Senior!"</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin was a Gold Core cultivator, and the senior he spoke of, could it be…</p>
