<h1>Chapter 2236 Come!</h1><p>Chapter 2237 Come!</p><p>Where did that flicker of animation come from?</p><p>Could it be a delusion?</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the stars again.  The sky was brightening; only a few stars were visible to the naked eye, like the eyes of the heavens, and he wondered which one was watching him.</p><p>Soon, a ray of dawn touched Qin Sang's face, and the stars vanished in the sunlight.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>The morning wind stirred the banners.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly rose, dismantled the formation, and began his duty, patrolling Yue Kingdom.</p><p>Throughout his patrol, he was distracted, pondering the events of the last night.  Whenever he thought of the Qingluan apparition, the lively glint in its eyes would reappear in Qin Sang's mind, causing him a strange unease.</p><p>If all went well, at this rate, he would soon possess immense power by continuing his cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, restoring or even surpassing his previous strength and resolving his current predicament.</p><p>But at what cost?</p><p>Though it was a technique he knew intimately, Qin Sang felt apprehension. He recalled the circumstances of his encounter with Qingluan.</p><p>That stone tablet, and the Qingluan remnant soul that dissipated after colliding with the jade Buddha…</p><p>Could it be that Qingluan was about to be reborn through this?</p><p>He was clearly in an illusion!</p><p>His thoughts raced, Qin Sang puzzled over it, and without realizing it, patrolled over half of Yue Kingdom. Everything was normal; there were no signs of demonic disturbances.</p><p>Dusk approached.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to stay outside for a few more days, find a secluded cave, and concentrate on cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, but now he hesitated.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>An unusual sound of wind reached his ears. Qin Sang looked in the direction of the sound and saw a shadow in the sky; a hawk was flying towards him.</p><p>Sensing the aura within the hawk, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he extended his arm.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The hawk landed steadily on his arm, its eyes gleaming with an unusual blue light, its pupils reflecting a tiny figure, their squad leader, Deng Kui.</p><p>“Daoist Deng, has something happened?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Before their separation, they had agreed to contact each other every three days to report their situations. It was only the first day.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng,” the small figure in the hawk's pupil spoke, it was indeed Deng Kui's voice,  “Do you remember mentioning a few days ago that you wanted to find a place abundant in fire and thunder energy?”</p><p>“Yes, Daoist Deng, do you have news?” Qin Sang's face showed anticipation.</p><p>“After hearing Daoist Qingfeng mention it the other day, I sent a message to a few acquaintances I knew. One Daoist friend knew of such a place; he called it the Fire and Thunder Abyss.  Apparently, his master discovered it many years ago and sealed it with a formation. He intended to keep it for his own use, but his master's sect gradually declined, and he didn't cultivate such methods. It remained unused until now,” Deng Kui said.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately asked: “It was passed down from his master?  I wonder if that Daoist friend is willing to part with it? Though my resources are limited, I will try my best to compensate him.  I also want to thank you, Daoist Deng, I have additional rewards for your efforts!”</p><p>The Fire and Thunder Abyss was naturally for his senior brother, Qing Yan. Qin Sang remembered many Daoist thunder techniques, including fire and thunder methods, but needed a suitable reason to give it away.</p><p>This would not only strengthen the unity of their sect, but Qing Yan and the others were Qin Sang’s ‘family’ in the illusion, trustworthy allies whose cultivation levels were high enough that they might be able to help him in the future.</p><p>“Since that Daoist friend took the initiative to reveal this, he must be willing to exchange it. These are his conditions…”</p><p>Deng Kui lowered his voice, mentioning several treasures, “As for me, it was just a small effort, Daoist Qingfeng, you needn't be so polite.”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned contemplation, “These conditions are not excessive, I accept them. I can't give them to you right now, but I have treasures of equivalent value… If that Daoist friend is unwilling, I will gather the treasures when I return to the Immortal City, and then I’ll go to visit him.”</p><p>Then Qin Sang took out several spiritual objects from his storage pouch.</p><p>Seeing these spiritual objects, the hawk blinked, and Deng Kui said, “Please wait a moment, Daoist friend…”</p><p>The figure in the hawk's pupil disappeared. Qin Sang stood there, patiently waiting for a response.</p><p>The man and the hawk stared at each other.</p><p>After an hour, the figure reappeared, “That Daoist friend has agreed.  You can give the items to the hawk, and I will tell you the location and how to activate the formation.”</p><p>Their quick agreement suggested they were eager, and his offer seemed too high.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't care about the slight loss, he tossed the spiritual objects to the hawk, and immediately learned the location from Deng Kui.</p><p>This place is still far from Yue Kingdom.  If you go now, I'll have Hui brother temporarily look after Yue Kingdom.  Go quickly and return quickly!” Deng Kui, having received favors from Qin Sang, became even more friendly towards him.</p><p>“Thank you, Daoist Deng!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, immediately parted ways with the falcon, and flew off.</p><p>He traveled day and night, and did not cultivate the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* for the next few days.</p><p>Every night, Qin Sang would visualize the Azure-colored Luan bird, observing changes, but found no other abnormalities.</p><p>…</p><p>“We've arrived!”</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the sky, his gaze falling on a mountain peak ahead.</p><p>The surroundings weren't as desolate as a desert, but they were very barren. This place wasn't in the core area near Yongtu Immortal City, but with more mortals and cultivators moving to Yongtu Immortal City, habitable land was expanding outwards; this place had long been incorporated into the territory of a mortal nation.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired along the way and learned that there was a cultivator sect within this mortal nation, but there were no abnormalities on this mountain. It seemed that the sect hadn't discovered this great formation.</p><p>He rose on clouds, slowly moving forward. As he approached the mountain peak, he sensed a scorching heat, evidently the underground fire vein beneath was restless.</p><p>With a sweep of his gaze, Qin Sang targeted a cliff near the summit, flew to the cliff face, and continuously cast several hand seals. Then, he suddenly passed through the cliff and vanished into thin air.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The sounds of thunder and churning magma were deafening.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself in a mountain valley that almost pierced through the mountain, as if someone had cut the mountain in half.</p><p>The valley was filled with blinding firelight, constantly emitting streaks of crimson lightning, radiating a violent aura.</p><p>“It's indeed Fire Thunder!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, the other party hadn’t lied to him.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang explored the Fire Thunder Abyss for a while, carefully making some arrangements and leaving behind a cultivation technique, before quietly leaving.</p><p>Returning to Yue Kingdom by the same route, Qin Sang made a round of inspections before returning to where he last cultivated the *Tian Yao Lian Xing*.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to continue cultivating. At least, to reach the third level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*!</p><p>The third level was equivalent to the Golden Core stage; he was currently at this realm, so even if something unexpected happened, he would be able to control the situation.</p><p>The sun set, and the moon climbed high.</p><p>The stars were brilliant, their light showering the earth. Drawn to the light, the starlight gathered around Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang entered a meditative state, refining stellar energy. As expected, a near-frantic improvement began again.</p><p>Accompanying this frantic improvement was the excruciating pain of the body refinement process, but this was nothing to Qin Sang; he remained impassive, concentrating on experiencing the changes within his body.</p><p>Another night passed.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, discovering he had reached the mid-stage of the second level.</p><p>“Truly frantic,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, checking the Azure-colored Luan bird he was visualizing.  Its eyes seemed more lively, but it might just be his own psychological effect; the changes weren't as obvious as they were at the beginning.</p><p>The second, third day…</p><p>Qin Sang diligently cultivated without ceasing, practicing *Tian Yao Lian Xing* every night, until the fifth night, when he actually reached the peak of the second level, close to breaking through to the third.</p><p>'Croak…'</p><p>There were rustling sounds in the forest, strange noises occasionally coming from it.</p><p>The phenomenon of cultivation was concealed by the spirit array, but because of the gathering starlight, the surrounding creatures instinctively liked this place, and more and more creatures were drawn here, circling nearby.</p><p>Within the spirit array, Qin Sang bathed in starlight, his eyes closed.</p><p>Stellar energy flowed through his body, washing his marrow and refining his bones. Qin Sang felt the bottleneck becoming increasingly clear; he was preparing to make a final push and enter the third level.</p><p>At that moment, the starlight around Qin Sang seemed to fluctuate.</p><p>Like a calm lake surface, a pebble was suddenly thrown in, causing ripples on the water.</p><p>Qin Sang, within the ‘lake water’, immediately sensed this, his heart suddenly startled. He immediately awoke from his meditative state, opening his eyes to gaze at the stars in the sky, filled with doubt and surprise.</p><p>Just now, he had heard a faint call.</p><p>The call was so weak, as if from an extremely distant place, almost inaudible, making one wonder if it was an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he was awake; this was absolutely not an illusion. He had indeed heard a strange voice. The other party seemed to be saying—Come!</p><p>“…Come…come…come…come…”</p><p>Two simple syllables, yet intermittent, and seeming to echo. Even though Qin Sang had already left his meditative state, they continued to reverberate in his heart, like the whispers of a devil, stirring his mind.</p><p>The other party seemed to be summoning Qin Sang, urging him to go somewhere, to approach them.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an inexplicable dread, as if a terrifying abyss, cold and lonely, chilled him to the bone!</p><p>The night sky remained unchanged, the bright moon like a silver disc, the stars like a long river.  Yet to Qin Sang, it transformed into a den of vipers, the stars into eerie eyes, brimming with unknown horror.</p><p>Who was calling him?</p><p>Clearly in a hallucination, why was he encountering such strange things?</p><p>Cold sweat poured down Qin Sang.  He mentally visualized the Azure Bird, but saw no change.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the night sky, his expression shifting.</p><p>Unsure of the caller's intentions, he dared not continue cultivating the technique, dismantling the spirit array that gathered stellar energy.</p><p>He feared that continuing would bring a beam of starlight from the heavens, supplanting him.</p><p>Though he wasn't afraid of possession, this era had celestial demons, powerful妖族 beings at the Unity stage and beyond!</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang couldn't understand.  Abandoning the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique meant cutting off a shortcut to his advancement.</p><p>The powerful being in the hallucination…</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  If it was a powerful cultivator, did they understand the world's secrets? Could he use them?</p><p>He thought this because he sensed a hint of weakness in the voice, though it could be a ruse.</p><p>Regardless, Qin Sang dared not continue his cultivation.</p><p>“At least, I'll wait until I break through to the Nascent Soul stage, achieving some self-preservation before trying again, seeing if that mysterious being can be contacted…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, gathering the flags on the ground and erasing the traces.</p><p>Later, he frequently recalled the event, reviewing the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique dozens of times, to no avail.</p><p>His guard duty ended, Qin Sang rejoined Deng Kui and the others, returning to Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>His master and senior brother had also returned.  Qin Sang feigned delight, reporting good news to his master.</p><p>“Oh? You found a Fire and Thunder Abyss?”</p><p>Master Tong Shen was surprised, Senior Brother Qing Yan even stood up.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  “I casually mentioned it to Brother Deng and others. Unexpectedly, a fellow cultivator knew of such a place. I checked it out, but the flames and thunder were ferocious; I didn't dare venture deep.  I wondered if it would be helpful to Senior Brother.”</p><p>“Thank you, Junior Brother!”</p><p>Qing Yan beamed, clapping Qin Sang on the shoulder.  He looked at Master Tong Shen.  “Master?”</p><p>Master Tong Shen smiled. “I haven't found a suitable technique for you yet, making me seem negligent!  Well, we have nothing else to do, let’s go take a look.”</p><p>He then summoned Qing Hong and Shuang Luo. The five of them set out.</p><p>Leaving the city, they travelled north, arriving at the Fire and Thunder Abyss under Qin Sang’s guidance.</p><p>“It’s there,” Qin Sang pointed.</p><p>Master Tong Shen made a soft exclamation. “A masterful array, utilizing the terrain perfectly.  If I didn’t know, I would have overlooked it…”</p><p>Reaching the cliff, they activated the spirit array and entered the abyss.</p><p>Seeing the overwhelming red lightning, Master Tong Shen nodded repeatedly.  “Excellent! Excellent! Let me find you a technique and make some preparations. Qing Yan, cultivate here, your progress will be rapid…”</p><p>Descending further, his disciples began to struggle, but Master Tong Shen was enthusiastic. He told them to wait, and descended alone.</p><p>After a while, Master Tong Shen reappeared, smiling, tossing something to Qing Yan.  “Disciple, see what this is?”</p><p>Qing Yan caught it, a jade slip. His spiritual sense touched it, revealing the six characters: *Di Huo Tian Ji Yuan Shu* . A profound chapter flooded his mind, captivating him instantly.</p><p>Qing Yan's hands trembled, his face filled with surprise.  “This is…”</p><p>“Indeed, a technique of fire and thunder! I discovered it in a cave below, seemingly the abode of an ancient cultivator. They cultivated there, but left for unknown reasons, leaving this behind, along with some associated spells.  Unexpectedly easy!”</p><p>Master Tong Shen looked at Qin Sang. “Qingfeng, did that cultivator mention this?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “No! They only said it was passed down from their master's lineage, but their lineage has long since declined.”</p>
