<h1>## Chapter 1037: Control</h1><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Someone had disturbed the Guardian Earth Spirits.</p><p>Following a series of deafening roars, the tranquility of the cavern was shattered.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The grand formation trembled, and strange ripples appeared within the black mist.</p><p>Towering figures rose from the ground within the chaotic mist.</p><p>Exuding a violent aura, they roared loudly, charging towards the intruders in a rage.  The earth spirits were numerous, their shadowy forms seemingly omnipresent in the black mist.</p><p>The more intruders there were, the more earth spirits were drawn to them.</p><p>Blood Bat cursed under his breath, then said coldly, "You all see it. Four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid aren't enough for everyone. Forget about alliances.  Every man for himself! Attack!"</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Crimson light flashed behind Blood Bat, revealing a spectral image of a blood bat.</p><p>With a beat of his wings, a gust of wind carrying a thick, bloody stench rushed towards the earth spirits.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An earth spirit was torn apart by Blood Bat, but others immediately surrounded him.</p><p>The other demonic cultivators exchanged glances before charging into the throng of earth spirits, aiming for the protective barrier at the center.</p><p>A chaotic battle erupted within the cavern.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang and Ming Wei had also entered the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated his Ebony Sword, repelling the earth spirits in front of him while secretly communicating with Ming Wei through voice transmission. "There are only four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid. Our previous plan is unlikely to work."</p><p>Bai was also interested in the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident in competing for one bottle.</p><p>However, if the three of them tried to take three bottles, they would undoubtedly incur the wrath of everyone else.  If there were more bottles, they might have a chance to fish in troubled waters.  But now, with countless eyes on every single bottle, Qin Sang felt the situation was rather tricky.</p><p>Facing so many opponents, his only advantage was his escape technique, which far surpassed that of other cultivators at the same level.</p><p>But if he were surrounded and his escape technique was restricted, he would be in grave danger.  The cultivators here were all elites from various sects. Qin Sang wasn't certain he could escape unscathed.</p><p>"If it doesn't work, I'll give up.  I only suspected it might be helpful to me.  As long as you can find the Heavenly Corpse Sect and remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, having the Soul Cleansing Liquid won't make much difference."  Bai, sensing the danger, communicated with Qin Sang, prepared to give up.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then transmitted, "Let's see how the situation unfolds. If there's a chance, we definitely can't give up. If you can advance to Corpse King, it will be much easier for us to operate when we return to the Small Cold Realm. The shadow of an ancient demon has appeared there, and it's not peaceful.  Besides, I have enemies there."</p><p>Bai simply hummed in agreement, trusting Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>Ming Wei's expression wasn't pleasant.  She forced a smile, "Fellow Daoist Qin doesn't intend to break our agreement, act alone, and leave us to our own devices, does he?"</p><p>Although she possessed the Life Talisman, seeing this situation, she understood her hopes were slim.</p><p>Along the way, as she learned more about Qin Sang, she felt this person was increasingly unfathomable. If she cooperated with him, there might be a sliver of a chance.</p><p>She now regretted being overconfident when they made the oath, not binding Qin Sang tightly to her, thus trapping herself.</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated for a long time, also hesitant.</p><p>Ming Wei's Life Talisman could have a miraculous effect, but joining forces with her meant greater risk with every additional bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid they tried to obtain.  It was a difficult decision.</p><p>In another direction, Venerable Ye, suppressing his cultivation and displaying only a portion of his strength, approached the barrier cautiously, keeping a low profile.</p><p>Su Nü and the others stood back-to-back, following Venerable Ye at a distance, prioritizing self-preservation and waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>The three elders with long beards were extremely tense, suppressing their excitement and glancing at the Soul Cleansing Liquid from time to time, eager to claim it.</p><p>Only Su Nü wasn't as enthusiastic about the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes darted around, secretly observing the other cultivators in the cavern.</p><p>Black mist filled the air as cultivators and earth spirits clashed.</p><p>Just then, Su Nü's gaze fixed on a figure. Though she couldn't see clearly, she was certain this was the person she was looking for.</p><p>Her heart stirred.  Her attacks with her demonic blade slowed, and she was forced back by the earth spirits.  The earth spirits' assault was fierce, and Su Nü was about to be in danger.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A blade of light flew from behind Su Nü, cleaving the earth spirit.</p><p>Su Nü regained her footing and sighed in relief, "Thank you, Senior Brother, for your help."</p><p>The burly man swung his blade repeatedly, repelling the earth spirits and relieving the pressure on Su Nü.  He asked with concern, "Junior Sister, are you alright? Is your primordial spirit unstable? Don't use your true essence for now.  Come to the center and recover, lest you lose control of your mind!"</p><p>Here, the influence of the Bewildering Cavern hadn't disappeared but had intensified.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all top experts with methods to protect their primordial spirits to varying degrees, still capable of fighting the earth spirits.</p><p>Su Nü took a breath and shook her head.  "The cultivation technique I practice happens to have the effect of stabilizing the mind, so the influence isn't significant. However, we're too close together.  I have powerful escape techniques, but I can't use them effectively.  Senior Brother, let's spread out a bit.  As long as we're not too far apart, there shouldn't be any danger."</p><p>The charming woman chimed in, "Junior Sister is right. Being crammed together restricts our movements!  We can regroup and form the formation when Master is ready to make his move."</p><p>The elder with the long beard sighed, "I was worried you would be affected by the Bewildering Cavern...Since both Junior Sisters think so, we'll take up positions in a battle formation, occupying the four directions so we can support each other."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The four dispersed, each taking a position.</p><p>The situation quickly stabilized.</p><p>The elders with long beards focused on dealing with the earth spirits, not noticing Su Nü's subtle actions.</p><p>Su Nü kept her eyes locked on that figure, catching glimpses of Venerable Ye from the corner of her eye, her heart pounding with tension.  She urged her demonic wings, swinging her blade to kill earth spirits, while her other hand, hidden in her sleeve, secretly formed hand seals.</p><p>Venerable Ye's speed was fast, and he was getting closer and closer to the seal.</p><p>The distance widened.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Su Nü’s blade sliced through an earth spirit.</p><p>But before the earth spirit fell, her other hand shot out like lightning, pressing against its forehead.  She then swung her blade, sending it flying far away.</p><p>The earth spirit didn't dissolve into the ground. Instead, it staggered to its feet, now under Su Nü's control.</p><p>Its empty eyes flickered with a strange light. The earth spirit shook its head and turned to look at a figure battling earth spirits in the distance.</p><p>Then, it stomped its foot and rushed over.</p><p>The earth spirits seemed endless, and the closer they got to the seal, the stronger they became. Everyone was surrounded, submerged in the army of earth spirits, inching forward.</p><p>The strongest few were already attacking the seal.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to charge.  He was discussing the plan with Ming Wei.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist…"</p><p>Qin Sang paused mid-sentence, his sword movements suddenly changing.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, which had been cutting a swathe through the earth spirits, abruptly dimmed its light and hovered in front of one of them.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head to look.</p><p>Just now, he had sensed something amiss. This earth spirit seemed unusual.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, it's me!"</p><p>A familiar voice came from within the earth spirit.</p>
