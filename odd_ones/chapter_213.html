      The structure of Alumera changed. Xiao Jin became the leader,
                and the other factions all congratulated him. The power to make
                a lot of important decisions has been moved from the Home
                Faction to the Xiao Faction.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At night, Xiao Jin invited Han Xiao to his mansion. All the high
                ranked officials of the Xiao Faction gathered around. Xiao Hai
                and the other children were there, too. They bowed to Han Xiao
                and called him stepfather when they saw him. No matter what
                these youngsters of the Xiao Family thought in their heart, they
                had no choice but to maintain respect for Han Xiao on the
                surface.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The butler led Han Xiao to the book room and closed the door,
                leaving Xiao Jin and Han Xiao alone in the room.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin’s wish had been granted, and he had become the leader.
                Although he was still expressionless, one could tell he was
                happy and satisfied from the feeling he gave off.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He did not forget the benefits that Han Xiao had given him, and
                because Han Xiao said that he was leaving the next day, Xiao Jin
                dropped everything else and invited Han Xiao over to express his
                appreciation on the first day of becoming the leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I really appreciate your help,” Xiao Jin said sincerely.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao did not sit down. He stood in front of the bookshelf,
                played around with the small items in the drawer, and said
                casually, “Get to the point.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin took out a bottle of wine and poured two glasses. He
                then walked to Han Xiao and handed one glass over.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Our agreement remains unchanged. If there’s anything you need
                me for, I’ll provide help.” Xiao Jin smiled. His tone was more
                confident now that he was the leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The wine was amber and fragrant; its taste was smooth and soft.
                This was Xiao Jin’s very high-quality collection that he
                treasured. It would only be opened for extremely important
                guests, and it had been stored for many years before that day.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao took the wine glass but did not drink it. He just
                swirled the glass around and said coldly, “I’ve been thinking
                recently and have come up with a very interesting theory. You
                knew Su Dinghua was going to assassinate Darryl a long time ago,
                but you didn’t tell anyone and let it happen because there would
                only be a chance to become the leader after Darryl died.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Then, when everyone was suspecting me, only you insisted to
                help me because you knew who the killer was, and it was a good
                opportunity to gain my favor. Later, when other factions had
                already established a bad relationship with me, you found an
                opportunity to throw out Su Dinghua as a clue and became the one
                who found the real killer, largely increasing your prestige
                while simultaneously starting good relations with me.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You used that as a reason to gain my help to win the leader’s
                election by using my strength to overpower all the other
                factions. You’re not the real killer, but you’re an opportunist
                who acted while riding along the waves and harvesting the final
                fruit of victory.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao turned his head and looked at Xiao Jin. “What do you
                think about this theory?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin shook his head in laughter. He sipped the wine and
                said, “It’s interesting, but it’s not true.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I think it’s true.” Han Xiao’s expression resembled a smile,
                yet it was not a smile.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin’s expression changed slightly and said, “That’s just
                your speculation…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao walked toward Xiao Jin. His body was leaning forward,
                and the pressure forced Xiao Jin to step back continuously until
                he hit the table.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They stood extremely close. Xiao Jin could only look at Han Xiao
                in his eyes because he had nowhere else to look. He felt a cold
                murderous intent in Han Xiao’s eyes, and cold sweat started
                dripping.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I don’t need evidence. If I think it’s true, then it is,” Han
                Xiao sneered.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin had to tighten his facial muscles to control his
                expressions, and his heart began to sink.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Remember, whatever you borrowed from me, I can take it back
                anytime.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s fingers pressed two times on Xiao Jin’s chest
                strongly. The act was provoking.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin had been promoted with the help of Black Phantom, and
                Han Xiao could do the same thing for the others anytime. Xiao
                Jin had no doubt that the other factions would be willing to
                spend a huge sum to make Black Phantom their ally. With Black
                Phantom’s strength, he could even duplicate the assassination.
                If their relationship turned bad, there was no way Xiao Jin
                could protect himself against a legendary killer every single
                day and night.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin understood what Han Xiao meant—threaten, intimidation,
                and blackmail!
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Black Phantom was more fearsome than he had expected. This
                partnership with Black Phantom was catching a tiger by its tail.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The atmosphere became more and more intense, and when Xiao Jin
                was almost suffocating, Han Xiao took a few steps back to ease
                the atmosphere. He played around with the wine glass and said
                coldly, “What are you going to do with Raylen?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Jin sighed. He knew that this was the time for him to show
                his stance. “I will make them pay. I’ll pursue and kill all of
                their intelligence agents, attack the organizations they
                support, and destroy their bases in the wilderness.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Originally, it was not suitable to start a war right after he
                became the leader. His original plan had been to stabilize the
                internals in six months. However, Han Xiao’s threatening made
                him understand that he had no choice. He could only listen to
                Han Xiao and retaliate against Raylen immediately. Alumera’s
                damage was not in his consideration anymore; he had to listen to
                Han Xiao no matter how he much heartache he felt.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Very good.” Han Xiao gave a faint laugh then left and said,
                “Enjoy your time as the leader.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The wine glass was placed on the table. Han Xiao did not drink
                any from the start to the end.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The sounds of the youngsters yelling “Stepfather!” outside the
                door grew faint and distant. Xiao Jin only sat down after the
                sound disappeared. The happiness of becoming the leader became
                weaker because of Han Xiao’s threats.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He’s got my weakness.” Xiao Jin laughed in bitterness and
                called Xiao Hai in.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Father, Black Phantom left.” Xiao Hai could not hide his
                happiness. The position of leader finally belonged to the Xiao
                Faction.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Pass my order down. The out of town divisions will be launching
                a full attack on Raylen’s forces in the wilderness!” Xiao Jin
                was back to expressionless.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Hai’s smile froze. Waves of shock filled his heart, and he
                said in disbelief, “Father, you’ve just become the leader, and
                the structure has yet to stabilize. If we start a war at this
                time, the power of the family will be hugely damaged, and our
                position will be even more volatile. The priority right now
                should be to stabilize the internal matters! Although Raylan set
                us up this time, there’s no need to seek revenge immediately.
                There are many more days to come, and there’s no benefit to what
                you’re doing!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Stop talking, do as I said,” Xiao Jin said coldly.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Xiao Hai was stunned.

      <em class="calibre7">
       The starting relationship is ‘respect’. Seems like Xiao Jin
                  gave in.
      </em>
      Han Xiao was very satisfied.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He did not threaten Xiao Jin out of nowhere. The deduction
                earlier was made from his speculation through the pieces of
                evidence. Firstly, Xiao Jin’s actions were all very goal
                oriented and connected with each other, and these actions all
                brought him a benefit, which was very suspicious. Secondly, [The
                Real Killer] was a puzzle mission, but Xiao Jin found Su Dinghua
                straightaway. Thus, the mission had been completed too easily,
                which made him feel that Xiao Jin knew who the killer was all
                along.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If Xiao Jin knew that Su Dinghua was going to assassinate Darryl
                from the start and did not do anything about it, then the
                character that Xiao Jin played was neither the real killer nor
                the mastermind, but someone who waited for the opportunity to
                take on the position of the leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had already thought of this when Xiao Jin came to look
                for his help, and he had planned this back then when he agreed
                to help.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He acted like he did not know and let Xiao Jin use him to
                increase his rank, but at the same time, Xiao Jin had to rely on
                him to do so. Therefore, Han Xiao turned around and threatened
                Xiao Jin because, unless Xiao Jin wanted to give up his position
                as the leader, he had to listen to him and almost become his
                puppet.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      From Xiao Jin’s actions, he was an ambitious guy who knew how to
                analysis his situation. The chance of him compromising was more
                than eighty percent. He definitely could not let go of the
                leader’s position that he had worked so hard to get.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Furthermore, Raylen was the mastermind who framed him, and there
                was no way Han Xiao was going to let them have an easy time.
                Therefore, he had ordered Alumera to clash with them without
                considering the costs for them. The people of Raylen would
                definitely not expect Alumera to counter-attack so strongly; it
                went the exact opposite way that they wanted it to go, and they
                had brought fire to themselves.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This way, Han Xiao could take revenge on Raylen without getting
                blood on his blades, and he did not even have to do anything.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was easier to fight a large organization with a large
                organization.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      During what happened in Alumera, Han Xiao had been watching like
                a bystander and only showed his teeth in the end.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The fight between a sandpiper and a clam benefitted the
                fisherman in the end!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Of course, there was a possibility that his guess was wrong.
                Xiao Jin might not actually have been someone who knew all along
                and acted on the opportunities that surfaced.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, this was not important at all. It was as he had said
                before.
     </p>

      <em class="calibre7">
