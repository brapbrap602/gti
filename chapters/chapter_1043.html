<h1>Chapter 135: Bewildering Labyrinth</h1><p>Bewildering Labyrinth.  That was the ominous name given to the crater.  Everyone present was waiting for it to open.</p><p>Among them stood a Taoist priest with a sword, Xiao Yun, currently the most renowned disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect.  Another figure of considerable importance, known as Blood Bat, had shadowy connections to the Demon Lord.  These two were rising stars of the righteous and demonic factions, their presence here unsurprising.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Black mist churned within the crater, unable to escape its confines, held captive by some unseen barrier.  Suddenly, a ripple disturbed the air above the mist.  A Bagua-shaped barrier shimmered into existence.  The eyes of the assembled cultivators burned with fervent anticipation.</p><p>At that moment, a series of whooshing sounds announced the arrival of five figures who blinked into view.</p><p>“The East Zenith League!” someone murmured, recognizing their affiliation.</p><p>These five were indeed Su Nü and her companions, including Venerable Ye, who was masked and concealing his cultivation, standing inconspicuously at the rear.</p><p>At the crater's edge, Qin Sang and Ming Wei waited a short distance away.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately spotted Su Nü, feeling a pang of surprise. With Su Nü's strength, aided by her fellow cultivators from the East Zenith League, it was plausible that she passed the final trial, but to compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid within the Bewildering Labyrinth seemed a stretch. However, with so many fellow disciples protecting her, even if she failed to secure the treasure, her safety shouldn't be a concern.</p><p>Su Nü stood beside Venerable Ye, appearing demure and fragile.  She cautiously surveyed the crowd, her gaze darting away like a startled rabbit when it met Blood Bat's cold stare, maintaining an air of timidity.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang wore no mask, his back lacked wings, and his demeanor was entirely different.  Su Nü's gaze swept past him without a flicker of recognition, seemingly unaware of the benefactor who had saved her life.</p><p>Their arrival was perfectly timed. The Bewildering Labyrinth's barrier fully materialized, then opened eight entrances in various directions.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Instantly, the cultivators cast aside their various thoughts, and multi-colored streams of light intertwined as they flew towards the nearest entrances.</p><p>Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun were among the first to enter, vanishing into the black mist.  Su Nü's group followed closely behind, the five of them entering together.</p><p>One entrance was near Qin Sang.</p><p>Naturally, he wouldn't lag behind.  With a flash, he appeared beside the entrance.</p><p>At that very moment, a cultivator in gray robes arrived simultaneously.</p><p>“Get lost!” the gray-robed cultivator roared, launching a punch.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. Sword light flashed from his brow, instantly transforming into a spinning wheel of blades.  A torrential downpour of sword light descended upon the horrified cultivator.</p><p>Everyone present possessed considerable strength, and this cultivator, a direct disciple of a Nascent Soul expert, was no exception. However, he was still outmatched by Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't expected such terrifying swordsmanship from someone with an unremarkable aura.  Startled, he retreated hastily, his fist movements changing abruptly to block the whirling swords.</p><p>His heavy fist struck like thunder, obscuring the sky.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The fist's shadow vanished.</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator was sent flying backward, his right arm dripping blood, a deep gash exposing bone.  He had narrowly avoided losing his arm to a single sword strike.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, glancing coldly at the injured cultivator.  If not for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, he wouldn't have let his opponent escape so easily.</p><p>Near the entrance, several other cultivators stopped abruptly, staring at Qin Sang in astonishment. Some recognized the gray-robed cultivator but none knew Qin Sang.  The gray-robed cultivator wasn't even a match for a single blow!</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Bewildering Labyrinth, followed discreetly by Ming Wei.</p><p>Only then did the others dare to move.  The gray-robed cultivator regretted provoking such a formidable opponent, but understood the importance of the task at hand.  He hastily stanched the bleeding and entered the labyrinth.</p><p>Inside, a chilling aura permeated the air, accompanied by faint, unsettling sounds that seemed to assault the mind, affecting one's spirit.</p><p>Ming Wei walked alongside Qin Sang.</p><p>She retrieved a jade pendant and wore it on her chest.  The pendant radiated a milky white glow.</p><p>Ming Wei sighed in relief, glancing at Qin Sang, who appeared unfazed.  “Fortunately, I have this spirit pendant bestowed by my ancestor, which helps dispel distracting thoughts and calm the mind, making it much easier to navigate the Bewildering Labyrinth.  Fellow Daoist, have you cultivated some mind-calming technique that allows you to withstand the labyrinth's effects without relying on treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, offering an excuse. “I've cultivated a secret technique related to the spirit, which grants me some resistance to such attacks.”</p><p>Whether it was a barrier or the black mist, the Bewildering Labyrinth indeed seemed to affect the mind, but with the Jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang felt no impact.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist's swordsmanship is truly divine.  I've heard that top-tier sword cultivators possess unwavering minds, their sword hearts clear and focused solely on the sword.  It seems the rumors are true!” Ming Wei exclaimed.  “Before this, I had never heard of Fellow Daoist’s name. I am truly ignorant.”</p><p>“My swordsmanship is merely passable. You flatter me.” Qin Sang’s words weren't entirely self-deprecating. He hadn’t even mastered Sword Momentum, so he wouldn't dare claim divine swordsmanship.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, focus on resisting the labyrinth's power. I'll lead the way.  If my strength wanes, we can switch…” Qin Sang suggested, looking down.</p><p>They were rapidly descending, the Soul Cleansing Liquid hidden in the depths.  Unaffected by the labyrinth, he could fully concentrate on other dangers while Ming Wei had to divide her attention to maintain her mental stability.</p><p>“Then I'll have to trouble you!” Ming Wei readily agreed.</p><p>The Bewildering Labyrinth was incredibly deep. They continued their swift descent, seemingly without end.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang felt his feet land on solid ground.  He surveyed the surroundings.  As far as he could see, jagged black rocks filled the landscape, a barren wasteland mirroring the black mist.</p><p>“Let's find an entrance at the edge. Any of these caves could lead to the central chamber,” Ming Wei said.</p><p>Fine beads of sweat dotted her nose. Even with the jade pendant's protection, she couldn't entirely escape the labyrinth's influence.</p><p>They soon located a cave. The passage was narrow, barely wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way.</p><p>From the moment they entered the labyrinth until now, aside from the mind-affecting aura, they hadn’t encountered any other dangers.</p><p>But Qin Sang remained vigilant, the Ebony Wood Sword held before him.</p><p>The instant he sensed something amiss, he unleashed the sword.</p><p>*Screech!*</p><p>A sharp, piercing shriek echoed through the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, flashing forward. He saw an Earth Spirit, cleaved in two by the Ebony Wood Sword, its remains dissolving.  This Earth Spirit was much smaller than those outside, allowing it to move freely within the cramped cave.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s expression changed.  “Go!” he shouted.</p><p>He pointed at the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>The sword hummed loudly.</p><p>Rainbow-like sword energy filled the entire passage in a blink.</p><p>Ahead, a swarm of Earth Spirits, each with a unique form, emerged from the stone walls, their shrieks filling the air.</p><p>Qin Sang charged forward, Ming Wei close behind.  She occasionally struck out, eliminating any stragglers and sharing the burden with Qin Sang.</p>
