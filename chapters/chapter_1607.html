<h1>Chapter 1598: The Ascension Place</h1><p>Chapter 1598: The Ascension Place</p><p>Hegao Zhenren, a cultivator of profound skill and calm demeanor, still took a long time to compose himself.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Mirror was shattered.</p><p>This not only concerns the safety of Danyu Zhenjun, but will also have an immeasurable impact on Bajingguan and the entire cultivation world!</p><p>Rumors of a Nascent Soul cultivator's disappearance spread throughout the cultivation world.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren scoffed at this, and Bajingguan remained unaffected by such rumors.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators stand at the pinnacle of the world.</p><p>Only they know how powerful Nascent Soul cultivators truly are.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren preferred to believe that the Nascent Soul cultivators were plotting something; his current cultivation and status did not qualify him to participate in their schemes.  He would know when the time came.</p><p>Moreover, during the hunt, Zilei Zhenren produced the Zhenjun's edict.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the edict was a forgery!</p><p>"I remember Senior Brother saying that Master Uncle left with Huiguang Saint together..."</p><p>Hegao Zhenren still couldn't believe it, racking his brain to recall what his senior brother had said, trying to discern truth from falsehood!</p><p>"It's true."</p><p>Zilei Zhenren confirmed.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren immediately grasped the key point, "Could Huiguang Saint also..."</p><p>Since then, Huiguang Saint had not appeared.  His secluded mountain retreat, Xiaofangcun Mountain, was even ransacked, yet Huiguang Saint remained unseen.</p><p>This incident caused the news of the missing Nascent Soul cultivators to spread widely, triggering a series of events that have intensified to this day.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators from different sects went missing.</p><p>The sect leader and Xingji, the abbot of Ganlu Chan Monastery, must have been in agreement.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zilei Zhenren shook his head, "I don't know."</p><p>Hegao Zhenren was stunned.</p><p>What other secrets were there between the two sects?</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's tone was ambiguous, "Ganlu Chan Monastery and Xingji are too calm."</p><p>Hegao Zhenren suddenly understood his senior brother's meaning.</p><p>He meant that from an outsider's perspective, Bajingguan was the same; even he, the sect leader's junior brother, only sensed something amiss after his senior brother forcefully entered the Wuwang Hall, was injured, and then arranged for him to act before Su Zinan.</p><p>Trusting his senior brother, Hegao Zhenren meticulously followed orders without asking questions.</p><p>Now he realized that his senior brother had been silently shouldering a heavy burden, but he certainly made many arrangements unknown to others.</p><p>"Ganlu Chan Monastery…should also possess a Soul-Binding Treasure, right?" Hegao Zhenren hesitated.</p><p>Such treasures have limited range.</p><p>Ordinary Soul-Binding Lamps are only effective within Central Plains.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Mirror's range is much wider; even if Danyu Zhenjun left Central Plains and entered the heart of the storm zone, it could still indicate his fortune, which is why the two Zhenrens were so shocked.</p><p>Presumably, Ganlu Chan Monastery also possesses a similar treasure.</p><p>If Huiguang Saint's Soul-Binding Treasure was also shattered, even if Xingji Master made the same decision as the sect leader—to cover up the news—he would certainly take action secretly.</p><p>For so many years, the sect leader has been paying attention, always able to discover clues.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren silently shook his head.</p><p>It was precisely because he had not detected any unusual activity from Ganlu Chan Monastery that he could not be certain.</p><p>Cultivators have different personalities; not everyone in Bajingguan is willing to keep a Soul-Guiding Mirror or a Soul-Binding Lamp.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators leaving Central Plains and encountering opportunities during their travels, disappearing for hundreds of years, is not unprecedented.</p><p>If Huiguang Saint did not leave behind a Soul-Binding Treasure and met with an accident while traveling, Ganlu Chan Monastery wouldn't know.</p><p>If Huiguang Saint left a Soul-Binding Treasure that wasn't broken, and his life was not in danger, Ganlu Chan Monastery would be even less likely to take action!</p><p>After a moment of silence, Zilei Zhenren recalled something and said, "I've heard that someone in the East Sea spotted Huiguang Saint. This rumor appeared after Master Uncle's Soul-Guiding Mirror shattered.  He was supposedly traveling with Qinghu Saint King at the time; Master Uncle was already missing then..."</p><p>Hegao Zhenren gasped, finally understanding what the sect leader had suspected.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators traveling together, yet only Master Uncle's Soul-Guiding Mirror shattered…</p><p>Was it an accident or deliberate action?</p><p>Ganlu Chan Monastery and Bajingguan, known as the two great immortal sects, didn't want to dominate the cultivation world; they simply couldn't defeat each other.</p><p>Moreover, the relationship between the two sects is more complex than just a conflict of interest!</p><p>"Senior Brother, you deliberately acted urgently and injured yourself during the incident at Wuwang Hall?" Hegao Zhenren asked, but his tone was affirmative.</p><p>Back then, Zilei Zhenren's aggressive advance into Wuwang Hall resulted in severe injuries, causing great anxiety among the cultivators of Bajingguan.</p><p>The severity of his injuries was alarming; a slight misstep could have destroyed his cultivation base. He would need at least a hundred years to recover.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's aura was completely restored; there was no sign of injury whatsoever.  His intention was clear: a demonstration for the Ganlu Monastery, and indeed, for all the world to see!</p><p>No immediate action from the Ganlu Monastery has been detected. However, remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect are beginning to resurface.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren is still unaware of his senior brother's plan to lure the enemy out.</p><p>“The beast?  Why did Senior Brother forge the order to hunt it back then? Could the beast's rampage be connected to Master Uncle's disappearance?” Hegao Zhenren's questions poured forth, his impatience evident.</p><p>“Before Master Uncle left, he left behind three words—'The heavens have changed.'”</p><p>Before Hegao Zhenren could ponder the meaning of these words, Zi Lei Zhenren gently touched a fragment of the Soul-Attracting Mirror with his fingertip and said in a low voice, “Some secrets are now ready to be revealed, junior brother. Haven't you always wondered about ascension, and why only Metamorphosis cultivators can ascend? Because the place of ascension lies in—the Gui Xu of the East Sea!”</p><p>...</p><p>After Qin Sang and the figure in shadow struck their deal, he journeyed north overland and returned to Feiyun Ferry. He didn't rush to see Jiang Mu to claim the meteorite whip.</p><p>The Liu Zhou Hall's investigation into the whip's origins would take time; he could simply ask for the results later.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried that the Liu Zhou Hall would recognize the whip's value and keep it for themselves. The whip itself wasn't particularly valuable; the Hall could study it all they liked.  Its importance to Qin Sang stemmed from its connection to the ancient demon and the ascension platform.</p><p>If the Liu Zhou Hall made any unusual moves, it would indicate they also knew about the ascension platform, which would be excellent; it would save Qin Sang the trouble of investigating.</p><p>With sufficient cultivation, ascension was available to anyone on the platform.  A grand cultivator like himself approaching them—could he possibly be denied a place?</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling...</p><p>Qin Sang placed the Jinlong Xien and the Qianjie Divine Net before him. He set aside the Jinlong Xien first and attempted to refine the Qianjie Divine Net.</p><p>The figure in shadow had proactively erased their mark on the net, leaving Qin Sang to simply proceed with the refinement.</p><p>When not activated, the Qianjie Divine Net automatically contracted into a silver orb the size of a baby's fist.  As soon as Qin Sang's consciousness touched it, the orb emitted a brilliant light, bathing the entire cave and Qin Sang himself in a silvery sheen.  With a whoosh, the Qianjie Divine Net unfolded, transforming into a thin, large net suspended above Qin Sang.</p><p>Now ownerless, its form was different from before; individual silver threads could be clearly seen weaving the net. Qin Sang closed his eyes, sensing the artifact purely with his consciousness. The feedback was a comfortable sense of affinity; truly a divine consciousness artifact.</p><p>After a cursory examination, Qin Sang began refining it.  Within a single hour, the Qianjie Divine Net began to change. From the edges, the silver light gradually dimmed, and the silver threads appeared ethereal. This was a sign of the net merging with Qin Sang's consciousness. When the entire silver net became this way, it would signify complete refinement.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze filled with brilliance. The refinement process had been far smoother and faster than anticipated. The power of the Soul-Nurturing Wood was clearly at work, making his cultivation of consciousness techniques and refinement of consciousness artifacts significantly easier.</p><p>Having refined a corner of the Qianjie Divine Net, Qin Sang could store the artifact in his Purple Mansion, freely controlling its appearance and disappearance. He temporarily interrupted the refinement to turn his attention to the Jinlong Xien.</p><p>The silk pouch woven from the nest of the Xianzhi Fenglong prevented the Jinlong Xien's power from dissipating. Qin Sang drew the pouch into his hand; the texture was soft.</p><p>Imitating the Daoist robe-clad elder's actions, Qin Sang made the pouch transparent, gazed at its contents for a few moments, then decisively tore it open. Simultaneously, his consciousness surged forth, tightly enveloping the Jinlong Xien and bringing it before him.</p><p>The golden-yellow Jinlong Xien was exceptionally pure, emitting a unique Daoist resonance that was captivating.</p><p>“This is the essence condensed from the Five-Transformation Spirit Insect!”</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with awe.</p><p>He thanked Xiao Xiangzi; without the Town Spirit Incense, he would have missed out on this treasure.</p><p>He didn't feel any immediate impact.  The Daoist robe-clad elder hadn't explained how to refine the Jinlong Xien; Qin Sang could only experiment gradually.</p><p>With his consciousness enveloping the Jinlong Xien, he brought it into his Purple Mansion and focused his mind on the jade Buddha.  The Buddha's light rippled gently, allowing the Jinlong Xien to enter Qin Sang's primordial spirit.</p><p>Within his primordial spirit resided the Yunyou Sword.  Over the years, whenever Qin Sang had free time, he would use the  *Ji Yuan Technique* on the Yunyou Sword. While it was still far from developing sentience, Qin Sang could feel a subtle, indescribable connection between himself and the sword, a greater intimacy than before.</p><p>Yunyouzi's true spirit seemed to have stabilized slightly.  This change wasn't yet obvious, perceptible only because the Yunyou Sword was Qin Sang's natal artifact.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang focused all his attention on the Near Dragon Saliva, his spiritual sense like a blade, carefully peeling off a thin layer.  Based on past experience, he usually used a forceful method to refine it.</p><p>Suddenly, a change occurred!</p><p>The Near Dragon Saliva, originally solid, immediately melted into a golden liquid when Qin Sang attempted to refine it. The relatively stable energy within also simultaneously became turbulent.</p><p>The descendants of the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon could digest Near Dragon Saliva as easily as drinking water.</p><p>Qin Sang realized he couldn't directly absorb the Near Dragon Saliva; he had to first restrain and organize this energy. Otherwise, the energy would become increasingly chaotic, eventually exploding, rendering his efforts futile.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The silver light of the Thousand Knot Divine Net had only recently disappeared when the cave was once again bathed in gold.</p><p>Before Qin Sang, a burst of golden light erupted, like countless thin golden lightning bolts, appearing and disappearing quickly.</p><p>Unable to soothe the Near Dragon Saliva, and fearing an internal explosion, Qin Sang moved it outside his body, helplessly watching it dissipate.</p><p>The waste of such a precious treasure pained him, but his powerful spiritual sense gave him a clear understanding after this experience.</p><p>He didn't rush into a second attempt, instead entering a meditative state, recalling every change in the Near Dragon Saliva and performing deductions.</p><p>Days passed in the cave.</p><p>During this time, the Near Dragon Saliva exploded again.</p><p>By the third time, Qin Sang was able to stabilize the energy.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, he discovered the entire Near Dragon Saliva began to melt, on the verge of another outburst, the change occurring far faster than the robed elder had predicted!</p><p>Without time to curse the elder's duplicity, Qin Sang exerted all his effort, finally stabilizing the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>Finally, a drop of golden liquid appeared in his primordial spirit, shining in harmony with the Cloud Touring Sword.</p><p>But this was only the beginning; refinement was the biggest hurdle.</p><p>While attempting refinement, Qin Sang finally sensed the strange energy the robed elder had mentioned.</p><p>As soon as he tried to refine the Near Dragon Saliva, he was struck by an impact.</p><p>This energy wasn't simply force; it seemed to contain the unique Dao rhyme of the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon, highly beneficial to its descendants but dangerous to outsiders, requiring removal.</p><p>Allowing this energy to impact him would result in minor injuries to his primordial spirit at best, and the collapse of his Dao foundation at worst.</p><p>Then, a welcome sight appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade Buddha finally showed its power; his primordial spirit, as strong as a rock, remained unaffected.</p><p>However, Qin Sang next discovered that although this danger was eliminated, refining the Near Dragon Saliva wouldn't be a quick process; refinement and absorption would be a lengthy undertaking.</p><p>He estimated he could save about half the time compared to others, still requiring several decades to completely refine this piece of Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from meditation, lost in thought.</p><p>The effects of the Near Dragon Saliva were truly extraordinary; his spiritual sense had noticeably improved.</p><p>"First, subdue the Thousand Knot Divine Net. Then, absorb the Near Dragon Saliva while cultivating the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus,' striving to refine the Demon Fire Origin as soon as possible…"</p><p>Qin Sang set his plan and proceeded step by step, ignoring outside affairs.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, six months passed in seclusion, and he had become quite proficient in refining the Near Dragon Saliva.</p><p>This time was different; Qin Sang summoned the Sky-Eye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm.  He, as a human, couldn't absorb the energy containing the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon's Dao rhyme, but the spirit insects might!</p><p>This wasn't a sudden idea; he had considered this possibility for a while.</p><p>This was the true essence of the five-transformation spirit insects—wasting it would be a shame!</p><p>The Fat Silkworm possessed the ability to devour, although currently only demonstrated with poisons.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly could counter the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon's abilities.</p><p>In the world, all things could be interconnected through mutual generation and restraint.</p><p>After some hesitation, Qin Sang, without high hopes, released the Fire Jade Centipede as well.</p><p>He commanded the three spirit insects to surround him.</p><p>Qin Sang expertly peeled off a strand of Near Dragon Saliva, refining it while simultaneously observing the three insects.</p><p>When the energy appeared and was expelled by the Buddha's light, the Fire Jade Centipede remained coiled, unmoved.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm sensed the fluctuation, alertly raising its upper body, its eyes darting around. After staring at Qin Sang for a while, it lost interest and lay down.</p><p>"This guy only eats poisons?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, leaving only the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>He shared a mental connection with the Sky-Eye Butterfly, sensing that when the energy appeared, the butterfly showed a desire to try it, coupled with fear.</p><p>The fear likely stemmed from its lower cultivation; the power of the five-transformation spirit insect brought a hierarchical suppression. Qin Sang felt something similar, though less pronounced.</p><p>"There's hope!"</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced, quickly calming the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Near Dragon Saliva, after all, was an inanimate object. Sensing its master's encouragement, the Sky-Eye Butterfly quickly suppressed its instinctive fear.</p>
