<h1>Chapter 880 The Old Daoist</h1><p>Arriving here, Fang Ting was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The Incarnation's expression remained unchanged as he followed the group, step by step, towards the peak.</p><p>Soon, they emerged from the forest and arrived before a magnificent hall.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator stepped forward and announced in a clear voice, "Reporting to Master, your disciple was tasked with organizing the disciple acceptance ceremony and selecting new disciples. The selection is complete, and they have been brought here. Please review them, Master."</p><p>"Enter..."</p><p>The hall doors opened on their own, and a familiar voice came from within.</p><p>"Martial Uncle Chen?"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator hurried into the hall and discovered two people standing inside. It was indeed Martial Uncle Chen and the young woman, Fang Ting, whom he had brought in earlier. He couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Master, he..."</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen said calmly, "Sect Leader Senior Brother had a sudden inspiration regarding his cultivation techniques and has entered seclusion. He has entrusted the remaining matters to me. Do you have any objections?"</p><p>"This disciple dares not!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's expression shifted slightly. He hastily stepped forward and presented a jade slip. "Martial Uncle Chen, this jade slip contains the information of all the new disciples."</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen gave a soft "Hmm," accepted the jade slip, and surveyed the group.</p><p>Being scrutinized by a Golden Core cultivator, everyone's expressions became unnatural, and they felt apprehensive.</p><p>When they entered, Fang Ting saw the Incarnation and greeted him cheerfully.</p><p>The Incarnation inwardly groaned and fixed his gaze straight ahead.</p><p>He hadn't expected that this person would ultimately decide their fate. He could only hope that he would be impartial.</p><p>"Ripple Gate just selected a batch of disciples. It's not bad that we have so many this time. You've all fulfilled your duties," Martial Uncle Chen nodded to the four, offering praise.</p><p>The four cultivators' faces lit up with joy.</p><p>Then, Martial Uncle Chen shifted his gaze and pointed at the young man with three spiritual roots. "You! Step forward!"</p><p>The young man was startled. His face turned pale, his legs trembled, and his body shook slightly.</p><p>"Am I that frightening?"</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen frowned, displeased with the young man's demeanor. "No wonder your temperament was assessed as inferior. As you suggested, he will be sent to the Cauldron Hall for three years of refinement. We shall observe his progress afterward!"</p><p>With that, Martial Uncle Chen tossed a red token to the young man and instructed him to stand aside.</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen then continued to select several others. He questioned some and dismissed others without a word, simply tossing them a token.</p><p>His questions were unpredictable, sometimes about their origins or experiences, sometimes about their understanding of cultivation, making it impossible to prepare.</p><p>The tokens varied in color, representing the different halls within Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>As the new disciples were selected one by one, the Incarnation's heart sank further.</p><p>Finally, only two remained: himself and the oldest man.</p><p>"This old fellow wouldn't really target me, would he?"</p><p>The Incarnation muttered to himself. It would be truly ridiculous if his infiltration plan failed due to such a minor mishap.</p><p>"Your name is Zhao Songqiao? Come forward."</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen selected the old man, leaving only the Incarnation.</p><p>Fang Ting sensed something was amiss and remained silent, not daring to speak. The others weren't foolish either. They had long noticed something peculiar and began to watch the unfolding drama.</p><p>"With your cultivation level, to have tempered such a temperament is truly remarkable. It's not entirely impossible for you to build a foundation."</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen was quite amiable towards Zhao Songqiao. "Go to the Snow Shadow Hall first. The hall master is my disciple. He will guide you in switching to a suitable sect cultivation technique and see if there's an opportunity."</p><p>"This disciple obeys!"</p><p>Zhao Songqiao accepted the snow-white token, his face filled with excitement.</p><p>Finally, it was the Incarnation's turn. Martial Uncle Chen pointed at him and was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed. He abruptly looked up towards the outside of the hall.</p><p>The others, confused, looked outside but only saw the vast expanse of water.</p><p>"Why has this old fellow come?"</p><p>Martial Uncle Chen frowned, a look of surprise on his face. He muttered to himself, then snorted softly. With a flick of his sleeve, he shot a blue arrow of light outwards.</p><p>The arrow of light shot out from the peak and exploded after traveling a certain distance. Ripples appeared in the void, and two figures slowly materialized.</p><p>These two individuals wore black and white robes adorned with yin and yang patterns.</p><p>One was a thin, elderly man, holding a horsetail whisk, with an immortal demeanor and an extraordinary air. The other was short and stood slightly behind the elderly man, resembling a Dao boy.</p><p>After appearing, the two figures paused briefly before flying towards the hall.</p><p>"Brother Chen, this old Daoist has come unannounced. Please forgive my intrusion," the old Daoist bowed slightly, glancing around with a look of surprise. "Why don't I see Fellow Daoist Qi?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Huayang, if you seek Sect Leader Senior Brother, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. Sect Leader Senior Brother is attending to other matters and is not in the pavilion," Martial Uncle Chen returned the bow, his tone subtly cold. "If you have any important matters, I will inform him upon his return."</p><p>"I heard that your esteemed pavilion is holding a disciple acceptance ceremony today. Are these the newly admitted disciples? What matters could be more important than the continuation of the sect's lineage? Could it be that Fellow Daoist Qi has sensed a breakthrough opportunity and is preparing to form his Nascent Soul?"</p><p>The old Daoist seemed oblivious to the dismissal in Martial Uncle Chen's tone. He strode forward, his gaze sweeping over the new disciples, his eyes glinting strangely.</p><p>Everyone felt uneasy under his scrutiny, but seeing that even the Smokewater Pavilion Golden Core cultivator treated this person with courtesy, no one dared to speak.</p><p>The Incarnation was inwardly surprised.</p><p>Although he had never met this old Daoist, upon seeing his peculiar robes, he easily recognized his origin. This person was actually a Ripple Gate cultivator, and moreover, one who cultivated the "Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art," one of their core inheritances.</p><p>Smokewater Pavilion and Ripple Gate indeed had a close relationship.</p><p>He had just entered the sect and had already encountered a Ripple Gate core disciple.</p><p>However, he didn't know why Martial Uncle Chen was so cold towards the old Daoist.  Having just joined, the Incarnation couldn't guess the underlying reasons.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, Qin Sang's true body was standing on a hill by the lake, gazing at the mist-shrouded Smokewater Pavilion with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>He was concealed in the shadows, planning to leave temporarily after confirming the Incarnation's safety. He intended to travel around Ripple Mountain for a while, hoping to make some connections and cooperate with the Incarnation, one inside the sect and one outside.</p><p>Just now, he had suddenly sensed a fluctuation and saw a streak of light flying from afar, disappearing into the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't been able to see the old Daoist's face clearly, but this black and white streak of light was unique on Ripple Island. He suspected that it was highly likely a Ripple Gate core disciple who had arrived.</p><p>The direction from which the light had come was precisely where Ripple Gate was located.</p><p>"What is a Ripple Gate disciple doing here at this time? I'll wait and see. Perhaps I can find a way to contact him..." Qin Sang murmured, pondering for a moment before returning to his hidden position.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the Smokewater Pavilion's main hall.</p><p>Hearing the old Daoist's words, Martial Uncle Chen suppressed his displeasure and said indifferently, "Fellow Daoist Huayang, don't joke about Sect Leader Senior Brother. Senior Brother's cultivation has not yet reached its peak. He is still some distance away from forming his Nascent Soul. Moreover, forming a Nascent Soul isn't that easy. How much of an impact can one or two moments of inspiration truly have? The Nascent Soul Dao Fruit is not something that can be achieved so easily!"</p>
