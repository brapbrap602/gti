<h1>Chapter 1785: Merging the Seal</h1><p>Qin Sang's Dharma image was a Azure Bird.  This world’s humans and demons were sworn enemies, harboring deep-seated hatred.  Fearing suspicion, Qin Sang deliberately concealed her Dharma image.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma image, though unseen, seemed to sense something and was stirred. Since reaching the fifth level of the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*, the Azure Bird Dharma image had gradually solidified from a mere phantom.  For years after her breakthrough, Qin Sang had tried to explore the secrets of her Dharma image, but with little success. Controlling the Azure Bird's lightning power remained a distant goal.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Azure Bird Dharma image revealed surprising power at this moment.  Each breakthrough in cultivation for a Nascent Soul cultivator represents a higher level of attainment in their connection to the heavens. High-level cultivators can leverage a deeper understanding of the power of heaven and earth to suppress opponents of lower cultivation.  This can cause weaker cultivators to lose their composure, and severely, it can even shock their minds, leaving them unable to fight back.</p><p>The difference in cultivation can also affect divine abilities. The same spell, cast by a cultivator of higher realm, might be weakened invisibly due to heavenly suppression.  This amplifies the power disparity.</p><p>Because of this, although Qin Sang possessed several powerful abilities, her confidence in challenging those beyond her realm after reaching the Nascent Soul stage was somewhat lacking.  However, this wooden dragon was comparable to a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. Although Qin Sang was inferior, she didn't feel suppressed, even less so than the injured Thunder Turtle.</p><p>From the earlier performance of  Yuhuang Zhenren, one could see that she was extremely cautious when facing the wooden dragon alone, using various methods to evade its attacks.  While this was part of the plan, it also showed that Yuhuang Zhenren was being suppressed by the wooden dragon.</p><p>"The Azure Bird Dharma image can withstand the opponent's heavenly pressure…"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the reason, greatly surprised.  With the Dharma image's protection, she wouldn't have to worry about being hampered when facing opponents of a higher realm.  She just didn't know the limits of the Dharma image.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through her mind, but Qin Sang's movements didn't stop; instead, they became even more composed.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The spiritual spear descended from the heavens, unstoppable, shattering the white flames and striking directly at the wooden dragon's head.  The wooden dragon's fierce eyes reflected black whirlpools. The spear tip, flashing with sharp light, pierced the wooden dragon, causing its pupils to constrict suddenly.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>Such a fierce beast as the wooden dragon was incredibly unruly. It roared angrily, revealing its terrifying fangs. As it breathed, half of the white flames were swallowed into its huge mouth, then violently spewed out.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The pillar of fire formed by the white flames fiercely charged into the whirlpool.</p><p>Two powerful forces collided violently, causing the earth to shake. The black whirlpool was torn apart instantly.</p><p>The spiritual spear, its momentum undiminished, rapidly spun, breaking through layers of white flames.  Unfortunately, it showed signs of slowing down just before it could strike the wooden dragon.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to close in, silently activating the Destroyer Seal, pressing it silently against the wooden dragon's flank, then suddenly unleashing its power.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Fragments of scales flew everywhere.</p><p>The wooden dragon's body suddenly caved in, forming an arc in the sky.  A large area of scales shattered, revealing bloody flesh.</p><p>Suddenly struck hard, the wooden dragon plummeted downwards, its tail thrashing wildly, striking the mountain peaks on either side, leaving deep gouges in the cliff walls. Dust and rocks filled the air.</p><p>The wooden dragon fell into the sea of fire created by its own ability.  Just as it seemed about to crash into the valley floor, a roar echoed from the sea of fire. It abruptly stopped its descent and surged back out of the flames.</p><p>Its fierce eyes locked onto Qin Sang, filled with rage.  Its wound was bloody, yet it seemed to have little effect. The flesh beneath its scales contracted quickly, stopping the bleeding, and a bloody light flickered, as if gradually healing.</p><p>"Such a powerful physique! Such tough scales!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and the next moment, she felt a gust of fishy wind in her face, a gigantic claw appearing in her vision.</p><p>Although it was a dragon-type creature, the wooden dragon had four claws. Its sharp claws were like swords, and Qin Sang didn't want to experience being pierced by them.</p><p>She instinctively wanted to dodge, but at the last moment, she changed her mind.</p><p>The wooden dragon couldn't kill her, and she had companions nearby. Where else could she find such a good opportunity for training?</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang's figure suddenly stopped, as if paralyzed with fear.  Her blood qi vibrated, emitting a series of muffled thunderous sounds.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The dragon claw pierced her chest, but it only tore through an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang, moving like a wraith, was unscathed by the wood-蛟's claws.  Instead of retreating, he pressed forward, aiming for its underbelly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wood-蛟's battle instincts were sharper. Before Qin Sang could reach its weak point, another claw, wreathed in white flames, swiped at his head.  This fiery claw seemed to crush the very air, carrying immense pressure as the enraged creature tried to pulverize the "insect."</p><p>Most would be paralyzed under such pressure, forced to retreat. But protected by his Dharma image, Qin Sang moved freely. He leaped, dodging the claw, and launched a whirling-wheel seal with his left hand.</p><p>The fiery claw was briefly stalled by the energy vortex the seal created.  With a cold glint in his eyes, Qin Sang struck with his right palm, landing a crushing blow on the wood-蛟's joint before it could retract its claw.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Scales shattered, the claw twisted grotesquely, and blood sprayed into the air. The wood-蛟, its body tilting, crashed into the already damaged mountainside, causing a massive tremor that threatened to bring the peak down.</p><p>Enraged by the pain, the wood-蛟 lashed out with its tail, aiming for Qin Sang.  Qin Sang’s face changed; the protection of his Qingluan Dharma image had failed, leaving him immobile as the tail hurtled towards him.</p><p>This wasn't a celestial attack, but likely an innate immobilizing power of the wood-蛟.  Even with his protective treasures, Qin Sang didn't want to endure that blow.</p><p>Just as he was about to struggle free, a black lightning bolt descended from the sky—Gu Yun Zhenren had arrived.  His spirit spear, having recoiled, was now back in his hand.</p><p>With a flourish, he fearlessly charged at the creature, a stark contrast to his slender frame.  His attack was ferocious.</p><p>*Pffft!*</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren's timing was impeccable. His spear pierced the wood-蛟's tail base, a weak point in its scales, easily penetrating and embedding the creature into the mountainside.</p><p>The wood-蛟 went berserk, ignoring Qin Sang to bite at Gu Yun Zhenren. The latter, however, disengaged, withdrawing his spear.</p><p>Blood gushed forth.  Then, astonishingly, the wound in the wood-蛟's tail healed rapidly, and the stiffness caused by the injury quickly vanished.  The same happened to its other wounds.</p><p>"Remarkable regenerative ability…"</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren's eyes narrowed, but he showed no fear. If this was the wood-蛟's only trick, it wouldn't survive the day. He even had the leisure to praise Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist, your courage and skill are exceptional!"</p><p>He was commending Qin Sang's daring close-quarters combat.  The wood-蛟's every move carried overwhelming power; a misstep could have been fatal.  Even Gu Yun Zhenren, with the upper hand, wouldn't have risked it.  Only someone with extensive experience and complete faith in their abilities would dare such a tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to ignore Gu Yun Zhenren, studying his hands, lost in thought.</p><p>The wood-蛟 attacked again, and Gu Yun Zhenren met it head-on.  Qin Sang, too, rose, joining the fight, attacking from the opposite side. However, he focused on himself, specifically on two Buddhist seals—the Destroyer Seal and the Wheel Seal.</p><p>Throughout the battle, Qin Sang continued to use both seals simultaneously, a thoughtful expression on his face.  He was re-examining these seals, prompted by new insights into the Seven Master Seals gained during the fight.  He was attempting to fuse the two.</p><p>Since his breakthrough, Qin Sang had sensed this possibility, but hadn't been certain without fully understanding the seventh seal, the Great Vajra Seal.  Faced with the shifting battle against the wood-蛟, sudden enlightenment struck him: mastering the seven seals wasn’t the end of the Seven Master Seals! They could be fused.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the outcome of the fusion, but he had a good idea.</p><p>The Seven Master Seals, once mastered, transcend the limitations of specific forms. Each strike holds infinite variations, its power unpredictable.</p><p>“The potential of the Seven Master Seals is far greater than this!”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the obscure secret technique, once ignored at auction, to reveal such extraordinary capabilities.  Excited by this discovery, Qin Sang, aided by the wooden Jiao dragon, first attempted to fuse the Destroyer Seal and the Wheel Seal.  These seals, one hard and one soft, complement each other, with their power readily apparent, making them the easiest to understand.</p><p>While Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren confronted the wooden Jiao dragon, You Huang Zhenren remained hidden in the valley, biding her time. She was busy.  The white flames, recalled by the Jiao dragon, now formed protective armor.  The valley was overrun with vines, resembling giant pythons intertwined. You Huang Zhenren's form flickered as she imbued the vines' roots with talismans.  Blessed by these talismans, a faint light shimmered across the vines, strengthening them.  Her preparations complete, You Huang Zhenren looked up and contacted her companions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren exchanged a glance before simultaneously leaping above the wooden Jiao dragon.  Gu Yun Zhenren, wielding his spear like a whip, struck the Jiao dragon viciously.  Qin Sang, employing the same tactic, evaded the Jiao dragon's attack and landed a Destroyer Seal directly on its back.  The Jiao dragon was once again knocked from the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, the valley vines writhed, rising like true pythons, swaying in mid-air. As the Jiao dragon plummeted, the vines shot towards it, instantly encasing it like a cocoon. The Jiao dragon struggled wildly.  The vines snapped and broke, yet many held fast, and more continued to arrive. The Jiao dragon seemed trapped in a vast net, unable to escape.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren relentlessly pursued their attack. More vines bound the Jiao dragon.  Working in perfect coordination, Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren positioned themselves on either side of the Jiao dragon's head, their hands like clamps, seizing its neck and forcing it downwards.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Jiao dragon’s head slammed into the ground, shaking the earth.</p><p>From the sky, a sword descended like a celestial rainbow, arriving in an instant.  Qin Sang felt the Jiao dragon's struggle weaken, then saw the Sword Master's blade pierce the beast's head, ending its life.</p><p>“Excellent!” Gu Yun Zhenren laughed heartily.</p><p>You Huang Zhenren emerged, her delight evident as she gazed upon the Jiao dragon's corpse. The Sword Master returned to the valley.  He had been guarding the perimeter, preventing the battle's fluctuations from attracting unwanted attention, and prepared to deliver the final blow.  Everything went even better than planned.</p><p>“Quickly divide the corpse; we shouldn't linger here,” the Sword Master instructed before clearing away any trace of their presence.</p><p>The group quickly divided the remains, keeping what was useful and burning the rest. You Huang Zhenren received the core and blood essence. Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren shared the Jiao dragon's scales, hoping to incorporate them into their armor for further enhancement. The Sword Master received only some bones. You Huang Zhenren received the lion’s share, but would compensate them with Daoist merit.</p><p>After completing their work, the four quickly left. This battle had forged a stronger bond between them.</p><p>“This beast was a lone wanderer; that's why the fight went so smoothly.  But don't be misled. Deep within the Blightlands, if you cannot achieve swift victory when hunting, you risk attracting more…”</p><p>The Sword Master’s voice was grave, his warning mainly directed at Qin Sang. Qin Sang was preoccupied, contemplating the Seven Master Seals.</p><p>They encountered no more Nascent Soul-level beasts on their journey.</p><p>…</p><p>“We are less than a thousand miles from our objective…”</p><p>Atop a mountain peak, the Sword Master gazed north.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a tremendous roar echoed from the distance, a vast plume of dust visible on the horizon.</p><p>“Another beast tide! Something significant must be happening ahead!”</p><p>The Sword Master frowned.  “We'll need your assistance again, my friends.”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I’ll lead the way!”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang leaped down the mountain.  The Sword Master and You Huang Zhenren concealed their presence, following closely behind, with Gu Yun Zhenren bringing up the rear.  As they neared their destination, they needed to remain as inconspicuous as possible, avoiding flight to avoid detection.  However, the constant beast tides made avoiding them a time-consuming endeavor. Hence, Qin Sang and Gu Yun Zhenren would lead, their strength innate, allowing for subtle movements.</p><p>The Sword Master flicked out a veil of light, concealing their forms. Qin Sang went first, directly into the heart of the beast horde.  He rotated between the two seals, finding a balance, constantly refining and adjusting.  Countless beasts passed them, guided subtly by an unseen force, or gently pushed aside. It seemed to happen naturally, the nearest beasts oblivious, continuing their frenzied charge.  The four moved like water through the herd, silently passing through.</p><p>…</p><p>As the four rapidly approached their goal…</p><p>In the north…</p><p>Two figures stood in a mountain pass, gazing at the horizon. One stood ahead, his status clearly superior.  The man wore the robes of a Celestial Court Inspector of the Tianshu Academy, hands behind his back.  The other, a dark-skinned man, stood half a step behind.  Both stared intently at a scene beyond mortal comprehension.</p><p>“This is the place I spoke of.”</p><p>The Celestial Court Inspector seemed to recall something, a hint of sadness in his voice.</p><p>The dark-skinned man's expression was grave, his gaze unwavering.
