<h1>Chapter 2000: The Spark</h1><p>The Azure Frost Dew couldn't be directly consumed by the Sky Eye Butterfly; it required the master's assistance for refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a hand seal, and the dew exploded into a mist, enveloping the butterfly.  The mist swirled, and the Sky Eye Butterfly gently fluttered its wings, creating ripples. The dew adhered to its wings, gradually seeping in and being absorbed and refined.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the sea's surface, his eyes fixed on the butterfly.  The refinement of the Azure Frost Dew and the breakthrough were happening simultaneously.</p><p>The butterfly had begun its attempt to break through its bottleneck. Its wings trembled slightly, the tremor becoming increasingly noticeable.  Qin Sang sensed the butterfly's struggle and could only offer gentle reassurance, using secret techniques from the *Panhu Scripture* to help stabilize its foundation.</p><p>The mist gradually thinned. The butterfly's breathing grew erratic, its wings tightly wrapping around its body like a cocoon, the patterns on its wings becoming more vibrant.</p><p>“Is it going to pupate?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Normally, spirit insects would undergo pupation during a breakthrough.  During this stage, they sleep, for a varying length of time, a period when they are most vulnerable. This is usually the optimal time to subdue them.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly had pupated during its initial transformations, but during its fourth and fifth transformations, due to special circumstances, it had not followed the usual pattern of pupation, sleep, and emergence.  This time there was no external interference, but Qin Sang wasn't sure if it would pupate again.</p><p>Furthermore, a spirit insect reaching its sixth transformation, equivalent to the Void Refinement stage, would undergo a drastic change; previous experiences might not apply.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed a faint glow emanating from the butterfly, emitting a strange energy.  The glow seemed to be composed of countless minute threads of light, resembling soft fluff, gently swaying.  Under the glow, the patterns on the butterfly’s wings became even more vivid, a transparent membrane separating it from the outside world, forming a light cocoon.</p><p>“It's pupating after all. This pupation will probably last a long time…” Qin Sang thought. Pupation and sleep were part of the spirit insect's transformation process.  The moment it emerged would be the final stage of transformation, followed by a tribulation.  This seemed like a wasted trip.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, he sensed something amiss.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Without warning, the butterfly's tightly folded wings suddenly vibrated violently, causing ripples on the light cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed instantly. The situation took a turn for the worse; the butterfly’s wings trembled anxiously, as if a tremendous force was trying to pry them open, and the insect was desperately resisting.  If the wings opened, the cocoon would break, signifying the failure of the breakthrough.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a change occurred at this stage. Qin Sang's face shifted several times.  Precious elixirs and opportunities for breakthroughs were fleeting. If this attempt failed, he didn't know when the next chance would come.</p><p>There were no guarantees in the world, especially with a spirit insect's sixth transformation. Even as a Void Refinement cultivator, he couldn't ensure success. Perhaps the Sky Eye Butterfly could overcome this on its own, but if it came to the last moment and failed, Qin Sang would be too late to intervene.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer and decisively forced out his own essence blood.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Like the Azure Frost Dew before, the blood exploded into a mist, directly seeping into the butterfly’s body.  The Witch Clan cultivates their soul insects with essence blood, but such a drastic method should be avoided as much as possible. It could cause the insect to become violent and turn against its master, or damage the insect's foundation, creating numerous hidden dangers.  Each feeding requires the use of various secret techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang had always been cautious, but this was a desperate measure.  However, this would be a one-time event; with extra care later, the damage could be compensated for.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons. He disregarded his own well-being, continuously forcing out drops of his purest essence blood, which transformed into layers of blood mist, consumed by the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The eyes on its wings shone with blood-red light, filled with blood-red veins, its gaze chilling and fierce, as if it had fallen into a demonic path.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax, making the most precise adjustments based on the butterfly's changing condition.</p><p>After absorbing Qin Sang's essence, the Tianmu Butterfly underwent another transformation. Its wings ceased trembling, the light cocoon calmed, and the bloody glow in its eyes faded.</p><p>As the cocoon thickened and the butterfly stabilized, Qin Sang, exhausted, prepared to withdraw his energy.  But then, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>A fissure tore through the cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, but realized it wasn't the butterfly; it had deliberately broken free. The cocoon was complete, yet the butterfly refused slumber, actively ripping it open!</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed the butterfly's urgent desire—it needed something, something vital, and couldn't wait.</p><p>Qin Sang knew: it craved the tribulation lightning.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Another fissure appeared, a leg emerged, grasped the cocoon, and tore it apart.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>The cocoon shattered, revealing breathtakingly beautiful wings.  A graceful and elegant butterfly emerged, each marking perfect, a magnificent creature.</p><p>'Whoosh...whoosh...whoosh...'</p><p>A violent wind arose; dark clouds gathered overhead. Day turned to night.  The clouds churned, lightning danced, and celestial might descended upon the sea, unleashing a terrifying storm.</p><p>Perhaps driven by the butterfly's intense will, or perhaps due to Qin Sang's essence, mirroring its fourth transformation after consuming the Qingluan's essence, the brief pupation led directly to the final stage of metamorphosis: the heavenly tribulation!</p><p>The unexpected turn of events caught Qin Sang off guard.  Despite his weakness, he swiftly mobilized the world's energy, sealing the area to prevent energy leakage.</p><p>While the tribulation lightning brewed, the butterfly, impatient, flew towards the storm clouds.  A fragile butterfly, facing certain danger, charged forth without hesitation.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Lightning converged above the butterfly, forming a thunder dragon, its destructive aura plummeting downwards.</p><p>Undeterred, the butterfly's eyes flashed, unleashing two bolts of azure lightning, meeting the attack head-on, attempting to assimilate and absorb the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed a similar scene in the Talisman Realm.</p><p>He observed that the tribulation cloud didn't dissipate after the first lightning strike.  After reaching the Void Refinement stage, cultivators face a six-fold tribulation, and the tribulation for spirit insects also changed, no longer a single strike.</p><p>Each lightning bolt, after striking, either dissipated or was assimilated and consumed by the butterfly.  The second, third strikes followed…</p><p>Eventually, the sea was filled with lightning, countless arcs flashing, blurring the line between heavenly tribulation and the butterfly's own lightning.</p><p>Within this sea of lightning, the butterfly, flitting and elusive, dodged and defended against the attacks, simultaneously absorbing the stray energy.</p><p>Qin Sang, intrigued, was about to observe more closely when the storm clouds shifted again.  All the lightning converged, and struck with a deafening roar.</p><p>"A spirit insect's six-fold tribulation; one becomes nine," Qin Sang silently counted the strikes, the last being the ninth bolt.</p><p>The spirit insect's tribulation, while less powerful than a cultivator's, still presented a life-or-death challenge.  But the butterfly showed no such struggle.</p><p>Facing the ninth strike, the butterfly finally cowered.  Lightning accumulated on its body, a clear boundary formed as the butterfly's power fought back, but the sixth transformation's lightning was far more difficult to overcome.</p><p>The violent lightning engulfed the butterfly, seemingly imprisoning it within a thick bolt, relentlessly attacking.</p><p>After a brief standoff, a brilliant flash appeared within the lightning; a vibrant butterfly, its wings spread, darted through the bolt, breaking free and soaring into the sky.</p><p>The tribulation clouds hadn't fully dissipated when the butterfly dove into them, like a wolf among sheep, preying on the scattered lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes twitched; even if the tribulation was weaker, this was astounding.</p><p>The weakened tribulation posed no further threat. The butterfly danced and soared, merrily devouring the remaining lightning, like a playful child.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The butterfly landed on Qin Sang's chest, clinging to his robes, its bright eyes gazing up at him.</p><p>Besides the eyes on its back, the Tianmu butterfly also has eyes, bright and affectionate, shining with intelligence.</p><p>She is sentient, but still unable to truly transform into human form.</p><p>"Cultivation for spirit insects is indeed arduous. No wonder there are no heavenly tribulations in the middle.  I just wonder if it will have a limited lifespan due to innate deficiency.  Heaven should be fair..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, gently patting the Tianmu butterfly. He was about to test what divine powers she had comprehended when the butterfly swayed and fell into a deep sleep in his arms.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>After carefully examining her, Qin Sang confirmed that the Tianmu butterfly was unharmed.  The forced emergence from the cocoon, and the need to recover and absorb the power of the tribulation thunder, required this sleep. He relaxed his brow.</p><p>It was evident that the Tianmu butterfly had gained immensely this time. Before, she only absorbed and utilized the tribulation thunder; this time, it seemed to have merged with her own divine abilities, a transformation of unknown form.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious but didn't wake her, lest it leave an adverse effect.</p><p>He suddenly wondered if, after this transformation, the Tianmu butterfly's method of obtaining the Seven Transformations Void Butterfly breeding technique from the Ghost Mother would still be applicable.</p><p>...</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Returning from the sea, Qin Sang saw Taiyi and made a strange discovery. "Your cultivation hasn't improved in these years?"</p><p>"Your subordinate acted rashly. Please forgive me, Master!"</p><p>Taiyi explained his discovery and thoughts.</p><p>It turned out that after years of studying the Thunder Altar and fourth-order thunder talismans, Taiyi had a new understanding.</p><p>As a spirit talisman who attained enlightenment, he unexpectedly discovered a point of resonance between himself and the Thunder Altar and fourth-order thunder talismans.  It's hard to explain, but if he could grasp its true meaning, it would greatly benefit his cultivation, and controlling the Thunder Altar would become easier.</p><p>Inspiration is fleeting. Taiyi dared not leave his meditation and didn't report it to Qin Sang.</p><p>He dedicated these years to studying it, and now he’s seeing results.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang became interested. "Tell me more."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Taiyi carefully recalled and began to explain solemnly.</p><p>As he listened, Qin Sang nodded from time to time, finding Taiyi's idea quite reasonable.</p><p>After Taiyi finished, seeing Qin Sang silent and still standing, he quietly waited.</p><p>Qin Sang was contemplating Taiyi's breakthrough. If it proved feasible, Taiyi's chances of breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage would greatly increase. Moreover, he wouldn't have to wait until the late Nascent Soul stage to control the Thunder Altar to eliminate enemies.  The cost, however, would be high, potentially leading to Taiyi's death by spontaneous combustion.</p><p>However, if he could activate the Thunder Altar, it would be enough to deter most enemies.</p><p>There were no mortal enemies outside Qingyang Temple. At the Jitian Dharma Assembly, he had formed alliances with both righteous and demonic cultivators, making it unlikely that a powerful enemy would attack right after he left.  If Taiyi used this time to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, the stability of Qingyang Temple would be ensured.</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to wait a little longer, until the next time the Canjin City arrived, before heading to Da Zhou.</p><p>This way, there would be no worries in the rear, so there was no need to linger.</p><p>...</p><p>"Master, you called for me."</p><p>Yu Lang, who was cultivating, was awakened by Qin Sang and hurried over.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, looking at the mountains and rivers, and softly said, "In my life, I've dabbled in Spirit, Law, Body, Dao, Buddha, Demons, Corpses, Ghosts, Killing, Swordsmanship, Insects, Poisons, Thunder, Artifacts, Yin-Yang, and the Five Elements; I've explored many paths, but without seeking deep understanding in any."</p><p>Yu Lang, bewildered, knelt on the ground without daring to interrupt, shocked by his master's vast knowledge.</p><p>"You may be wondering why I haven't passed down my top-level inheritance to you," Qin Sang turned back.</p><p>"Disciple dares not speculate; Master must have a profound reason," Yu Lang respectfully said.</p><p>"Being scattered and disorganized is not a good thing. You, like me, have a strong will, but you are different from me.  You have early on determined your path, and mine is not suitable for you," Qin Sang enlightened him.</p><p>Yu Lang looked up, a flicker of understanding in his eyes.</p><p>"If you wish to pursue the Mahayana Path, I will give you this world."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed beyond the mountains and continued, "If you wish to cultivate martial arts, I can't help you much. I’ve had some thoughts, and I'll share them with you now.  Demon cultivators cultivate Dharma Images; can martial cultivators have Martial Images? Demon cultivators condense Dharma Images using bloodline powers, what about humans? What do martial cultivators have?  Indomitable spirit, unwavering devotion to martial arts, righteous courage, upholding justice, skill approaching the Dao, even using martial arts to stop war—various spirits, beliefs, and wills, though intangible, contain powerful forces.  Like sword intent, fist intent, blade intent, spear intent can all be paths. How to break through innate shackles and refine martial intent, and how to condense Martial Images. Besides martial intent, what other qualities can martial cultivators utilize to achieve Martial Images, or even transcend Martial Images? These are the questions you need to consider…"</p><p>Qin Lang saw surprise and confusion in Yu Lang's eyes, knowing that these were too early for him. Only after reaching the Nascent Soul stage could he truly touch upon the Dao.</p><p>"My words are just a catalyst. This is the inheritance I have selected for you, to aid your understanding of the Dao. It cannot be opened before reaching the Nascent Soul stage," Qin Sang produced a jade slip.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Yu Lang kowtowed repeatedly, his eyes instantly red. He sensed his master was about to leave.</p><p>"All gatherings must come to an end. I am also on the path of seeking the Dao. I hope that one day, you can walk alongside me."</p><p>In the future, if Qin Sang chooses the Mahayana Killing Dao, and Yu Lang achieves something, he can help him comprehend the Great Dao.</p><p>A disciple can be a successor or a protector.</p><p>Of course, it's too early to think about these things now; Qin Sang is only planting a seed.</p><p>Yu Lang, tears streaming down his face, suddenly saw a fiery red light.</p><p>A sword was stuck in the ground before him, ancient and dignified in form, crimson red in color, with flames burning fiercely on its body, bringing endless hope.</p><p>"The sword's name: Kindling!"</p><p>Qin Sang departed, his voice ethereal.</p><p>The Kindling Sword was forged from the body of the Sun God Tree. Qin Sang took out the green copper block from the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang also left the Earth Travel Boat to Taiyi.</p>
