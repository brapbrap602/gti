<h1>Chapter 1504: Puppet Crystal (6k, extra chapter for our Supreme Patron, Most Beloved Char Siu Bao!)</h1><p>After succeeding with his external manifestation, he immediately retreated into the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>Hidden by demonic flames and sword formations, it was difficult for outsiders to detect his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared, seizing Yin Dianzhu's Nascent Soul.  With a series of finger jabs, he placed numerous restrictions on the soul, sealing it away.</p><p>Yin Dianzhu's expression shifted from ferocious to agonizing, then to despair, finally settling into utter stillness.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>Demonic flames consumed Yin Dianzhu's body.</p><p>Several streams of light and a spatial pouch flew out, landing in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>These were the artifacts Yin Dianzhu had used, now changing hands.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense, forcefully breaking the restrictions on the spatial pouch.  After a quick scan, he located a vial of Fei Xue Pills, and taking note, removed it.  The other items were left unsorted, tossed directly into his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang put Yin Dianzhu's Nascent Soul into the Corpse Puppet Bag, intending to interrogate him later.</p><p>The battle ended.</p><p>Qin Sang extinguished the demonic flames and surveyed the surroundings.</p><p>He sensed several covert gazes.</p><p>These individuals, alerted by the Heavenly Tribulation, had been watching nearby.  Witnessing the fall of a Xuan Tian Palace Dianzhu, leaving no remains, slain single-handedly, they were utterly shocked.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over their hiding places.</p><p>These people felt as if they were targeted by a distant blade, experiencing a sudden, inexplicable pain in their minds, causing them to flee in terror.</p><p>However, the Elder Hun Mo and the Great Sage Tian Peng were not among them.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the depths of the Sacred Ground, then returned to the floating mountain.</p><p>At the edge of the black mist.</p><p>The battle neared its conclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, landing softly on the ground. He immediately saw several corpses – Shang Lu, the Yue surname cultivators, and others.</p><p>Some were still alive, surrounded by Jiang Dianzhu and the others – the tables had turned.</p><p>These individuals had been misled by the Palace Master and Shang Lu, and were not the main culprits. Although some were cultivators from the Tian Shan and Xuan Tian factions, they weren’t as close to Shang Lu as the Yue surname cultivators.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was absent.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu, Liuli, and the others surrounded them without attacking.</p><p>Having witnessed the deaths of Shang Lu and the others, these cultivators had expected their own demise.  However, seeing that Tong Lingyu didn't seem inclined to a complete reckoning, they weren't fighting desperately.</p><p>Their faces were tense; they kept looking towards the depths of the black mist, anxiously awaiting Tong Lingyu's verdict.</p><p>However, they also understood.</p><p>Even if they survived this time, their future would be far from easy.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang, Jiang Dianzhu frowned.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had insisted on pursuing Yin Dianzhu alone.  Why had he returned so quickly? Had he failed, and let Yin Dianzhu escape?</p><p>If Yin Dianzhu returned to Xuan Tian Palace first and spread false rumors, it would create considerable problems.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu was about to go and assist Qin Sang.</p><p>“Yin Dianzhu…”</p><p>“Is dead.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his reply succinct.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Hearing this, including Jiang Dianzhu, the Nascent Soul cultivators present changed color, their gazes towards Qin Sang filled with awe and shock.</p><p>No wonder the First Elder wasn't worried at all!</p><p>They knew the strength of the Palace's Dianzhus; Yin Dianzhu was among the strongest, yet he had been slain so swiftly.</p><p>Only Liuli’s expression remained unchanged; she had witnessed Qin Sang's true strength in the underground cavern.</p><p>At that moment, the black mist stirred. Tong Lingyu emerged, leading a sealed Luo Yun.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Tong Lingyu showed no surprise, merely nodding at him. Then, gently placing Luo Yun down, she sighed amidst the shocked onlookers, “Everyone should remember Senior Brother Luo.”</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Yun was the irrefutable evidence.</p><p>Seeing the supposedly deceased Luo Yun alive before them, bearing terrifying seals, these individuals could no longer deny Yin Changsheng's actions and surrendered.</p><p>The situation stabilized without a fight, leaving only the task of eliminating Yin Changsheng’s remaining influence. Yin Changsheng’s great upheaval was essentially over.</p><p>Of course, the repercussions would linger for a long time, potentially altering the landscape of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>At least the outcome wasn't entirely bad.</p><p>Luo Yun and Tong Lingyu were both alive.</p><p>If Luo Yun's injuries could be healed, and Tong Lingyu successfully broke through to a higher realm, Xuan Tian Palace would remain a formidable force, with two Grand Cultivators.</p><p>The greatest loss was perhaps the four-clawed serpent seal; the "Sacrificial Yuan Technique" could serve as compensation.</p><p>Qin Sang paid little attention to Xuan Tian Palace's internal affairs. He used this opportunity to learn from Jiang Dianzhu about the strange phenomenon in the depths of the Sacred Ground.</p><p>A flash of white light had passed.</p><p>The anomaly existed for a short time, but even through the chaotic currents of darkness, its impact was evident.  It's unclear what the demons were doing there.</p><p>The fragments of the Killing Sword are deep within the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword spirit remained unresponsive, preventing precise location confirmation.</p><p>Regardless, Qin Sang intends to go there personally.</p><p>Looking at Tong Lingyu, Qin Sang asked with a puzzled expression, "The invasion of the Sacred Grounds by Hun Mo and Tian Peng, along with their demonic forces, doesn’t seem to worry you, Daoist Tong?"</p><p>Luo Yun's fate is unknown.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was severely injured, suppressing her wounds with pills, having discarded her spiritual treasures, and significantly weakened.  </p><p>This is Xuan Tian Palace's most vulnerable moment.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was calmly directing the cleanup efforts.  Her first priority was sending people to collect the treasures within the Sacred Grounds to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.  </p><p>The Palace Master's sudden attack prevented her from doing so.</p><p>Tong Lingyu smiled and explained, "Similar incidents have occurred before, but Xuan Tian Palace always prevailed. As long as the Kan Shen Pearl and other treasures continue to flow, the Palace's foundation remains unshaken. We can recover within a century or two. What's there to fear?"</p><p>She opened her palm, revealing the Ice Demon Crystal. "Besides, with the sacred artifact secure, outsiders can't enter the Sacred Grounds. We control when it's opened."</p><p>"Aren't you worried about what Hun Mo and Tian Peng are doing deep within the Sacred Grounds?" Qin Sang countered.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned, gazing into the darkness at the heart of the Sacred Grounds. "Daoist Qin, you may not know, but for countless years, our ancestors explored the area many times. The spatial currents there are extremely dangerous.  Even Palace Masters and Elders have perished within, leaving no trace. However, nothing was ever found! We concluded the depths of the Sacred Grounds are likely a void, utterly destroyed.  Do you think Hun Mo and Tian Peng have greater insight than our ancestors?"</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed.</p><p>The sword spirit's sensing proves the Sacred Grounds' depths are not empty.  Xuan Tian Palace's ancestral judgment was wrong!</p><p>Tong Lingyu coughed lightly, a faint blush appearing on her cheeks. The effects of her pills were wearing off, and her injuries were flaring up again.</p><p>She quickened her pace.</p><p>"The only thing there is an enigmatic stele, suspended within the spatial currents, resting on a lotus pedestal. It's uninscribed, yet emits a strange energy.</p><p>"Anyone would mistake it for a treasure.</p><p>"However, despite countless attempts – including chopping, burning, and even lightning strikes – it remains undamaged and immovable, offering no reaction.</p><p>"Yin Changsheng's plan, crafted over centuries, involved this stele to lure Hun Mo.  He originally planned to set traps around it. But your and Liu Li's unexpected appearance altered his plans.”</p><p>Unpredictable events unfolded differently than any plan could account for.</p><p>Had Yin Changsheng continued with his original scheme, he might have captured Hun Mo and gained the treasure.</p><p>Instead, he fixated on Qin Sang, leaving Hun Mo unchecked and free.</p><p>Although Yin Changsheng abandoned his plan, he inadvertently revealed the Sacred Grounds' approximate location.</p><p>The Lingzhi Ruyi, obtained by Hun Mo in the Golden Summit Hall, has a significant connection to the stele. Guided by it, Hun Mo easily found the entrance to the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>The Lingzhi Ruyi emits a similar energy to the stele.</p><p>Hun Mo was initially incredulous, having found a seemingly related treasure in a Buddhist ruin.</p><p>He spent years studying it, replicating its energy to forge a modified version of the Lock Void Sword. This was disguised and auctioned at the Grand Demon Assembly to gauge Xuan Tian Palace's reaction.</p><p>If Xuan Tian Palace bought it at any cost, it would confirm the Lingzhi Ruyi's connection to the stele.</p><p>Qin Sang's interference led to Xuan Tian Palace missing the Lock Void Sword.</p><p>Hun Mo, uncertain, lacked focus on Qin Sang and spent over a decade on this. Finally, he decided to unite with the Demon Saint in a desperate gamble.</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed to where the white light appeared, speaking urgently.  "That's where the stele is located.  As a precaution, Palace Master Jiang and Elder Mei will secretly investigate. There's a healing elixir in the Sacred Grounds that can stabilize injuries and restore most of one’s strength. I will retrieve it now. If anything unexpected happens, I'll be there immediately."</p><p>If you are interested in that place, you can also go with Master Jiang and the others…"</p><p>She didn't hide anything about these matters, and was even happy to see Qin Sang take the lead. Only Qin Sang could counter the Demon Elder and the Heavenly Peng Sage.</p><p>Having said that, Tong Lingyu summoned Master Jiang and Elder Mei.</p><p>The few of them discussed for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved to Liuli's side, whispering a few words:  "...I'm worried that I might inadvertently encounter demons and be besieged by the Demon Elder and Heavenly Peng.  Would you be willing to lend me a hand, Fairy? You don't need to show yourself; just hide in the shadows and strike at the opportune moment.  You will be handsomely rewarded afterwards!"</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out four Serpent Seals and secretly passed them to Liuli.</p><p>Currently, only Liuli and Tong Lingyu could control this treasure, so Qin Sang naturally trusted Liuli more.</p><p>One attack would be enough.</p><p>Even a Grand Cultivator couldn't withstand two attacks of pseudo-spiritual treasure level.</p><p>Moreover, Liuli's Ice Soul Radiance was also a top-tier divine ability, and could help him restrain his opponents at critical moments.</p><p>Liuli, already aware of the reason, didn't refuse.  She took the four Serpent Seals and said, "Helping you is also helping the sect. You don't need to thank me."</p><p>She wanted to clearly define the relationship of mutual benefit between them, leaving no room for ambiguity.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Liuli's earnest eyes, vaguely guessing her intentions, and sighed inwardly, choosing not to argue with her.</p><p>The four secretly left the dark mist and quietly flew towards the depths of the sacred land.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He suddenly stopped his flight and said, "Two fellow Daoists, please go ahead. I have encountered an old acquaintance; I'll be back shortly."</p><p>Master Jiang and Elder Mei exchanged a glance and didn't ask further questions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli changed direction, flying not far before landing on a mountain.</p><p>This mountain was lush with vegetation, with exotic flowers blooming and immortal vines wrapping around the trees—a rare sight in the sacred land.</p><p>On a blue stone at the mountaintop stood an old man.</p><p>He stood with his hands behind his back, his breath slightly erratic. He tilted his head slightly, his cloudy eyes piercing through the darkness, constantly staring at the direction of the sinkhole, seemingly unaware of the two people who had landed before him.</p><p>"Such heavenly might... the person undergoing tribulation is Yin Changsheng, isn't it? Xuan Tian Palace is indeed facing a troubled time!"</p><p>He sighed, withdrew his gaze, looked at the couple, and let out a hoarse laugh. "The outcome of what I've done isn't bad after all. It has resulted in a fine marriage."</p><p>This person was actually Dongyang Bo!</p><p>He had faked his death in front of Qiu Mu Bai!</p><p>Facing the man who had caused her so much misery, Liuli remained cold, seemingly too lazy to speak to him, remaining silent.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "You dare appear before me alone? Are you here to die?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo's face suddenly darkened, and he shouted sharply, "Qin Sang, kill me!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>This man was truly determined to die.</p><p>Dongyang Bo no longer posed a threat; his actions only seemed strange and laughable to Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain motionless, Dongyang Bo let out a sarcastic smile and sneered, "What? I've come to you myself, and you're still afraid? If you don't kill me in this life, how can you have peace of mind!  How could you live until today being so indecisive!"</p><p>"Heh..."</p><p>Facing Dongyang Bo's provocation, Qin Sang remained unmoved, chuckled, and glanced at the exit of the sacred land. "Pretentious! Are you worried that I'll later take my anger out on Qiu Mu Bai?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo's expression froze.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation had progressed rapidly, far exceeding his expectations.</p><p>Liuli was also a gifted individual, especially with the backing of the North Sea's largest sect.</p><p>If they decided to make things difficult for Qiu Mu Bai, even if Qiu Mu Bai managed to survive by a hair's breadth, he would find it hard to move forward in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, "You underestimate me too much!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo looked deeply at Qin Sang, then suddenly laughed into the sky.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Wild laughter.</p><p>His laughter grew louder and louder, no longer sounding old, echoing through the heavens, regaining some of the demeanor of the Shao Hua Mountain Patriarch, yet tinged with desolation.</p><p>"Yes! I underestimated you. I have always underestimated you!"</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly.</p><p>"Cough..."</p><p>Dongyang Bo coughed violently, stopping his laughter, forcefully pressing his hand to his chest, gasping for breath. "Well, given your temperament, if I die at your hands, Mu Bai will be even more dangerous."</p><p>Saying this, Dongyang Bo reached into his bosom and took out a crystal.</p><p>The crystal was shaped like a small ball, easily held in the palm, entirely milky white, without any impurities, extremely pure.</p><p>"Take it!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo threw the crystal to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  His spiritual sense swiftly scanned the white orb, then cautiously channeled his true energy, forming a large hand to catch it in mid-air, preventing Dongyang Bo from playing any tricks.  He was always cautious; even with victory in hand, he wouldn't relax, especially against the treacherous Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's actions, Dongyang Bo sneered, “I call this a Puppet Crystal. I obtained it from the Purple Micro Palace.  After years of studying ancient texts, I analyzed that it’s a special treasure used to refine puppets. I intended to refine it into the Spirit-infused Puppet from the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace…”</p><p>He paused, then continued, “Originally, there was a black and a white one, perfectly representing yin and yang, a complete set. I deliberately revealed the Yin Puppet Crystal to General Gui, who bought it to refine into a puppet.  Possessing the Yang Puppet Crystal, I could sense that puppet within a certain range. I planned to secretly follow them, seeking opportunity for one last gamble, but my energy is fading too quickly to make it.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo chuckled, “You’re also very interested in the Hunmo Elder's plot, aren’t you? Today, I’ll lend you a hand. I want to see what kind of waves you’ll make in the cultivation world!  It would be even better if you died at the hands of those demons; I'd have company on the road to the underworld.”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could reply, Dongyang Bo turned to Liuli, sending a beam of light.</p><p>“The *Mysterious Mother Jade Cauldron True Scripture* also originates from the Purple Micro Palace. I later searched there, but unfortunately, I couldn't find its origins or a solution. This contains all the information about this evil technique, but the Purple Micro Palace is gone, so this is all I can do…”</p><p>Liuli caught the light, her expression complex.</p><p>*A dying man's words are often kind.*</p><p>Of course, both she and Qin Sang understood that Dongyang Bo’s actions might stem from repentance and atonement, but more likely, it was for Qiu Mu Bai.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the Puppet Crystal with his spiritual sense.  Under Qing Jun's tutelage, Qin Sang had considerable knowledge of puppetry.  As Dongyang Bo said, the Puppet Crystal was indeed a treasure of puppetry, but it was Qin Sang's first time seeing such a thing, and he couldn't immediately understand its uses.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang grabbed the crystal. Before putting it away, he laid a layer of demonic fire restriction on its surface to prevent General Gui from sensing him. Dongyang Bo couldn’t have foreseen Qin Sang's presence in the Sacred Land; the Puppet Crystal was for his own use, and he wouldn't harm himself. Since it was for Qiu Mu Bai, he wouldn't tamper with it either; otherwise, if his plan against Qin Sang failed, he would have shot himself in the foot.</p><p>Still, out of caution, Qin Sang took precautions.</p><p>“He’s dead.”</p><p>Liuli said softly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw Dongyang Bo standing on a blue stone, his gaze fixed north, like a statue.  His breath had ceased.  His energy had depleted after the self-destruction of the Vajra Wheel, leaving him extremely weak, clinging to life only by sheer willpower.</p><p>“Let's bury him.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang said.</p><p>Liuli nodded.  “Yes!”</p><p>Her feelings towards Dongyang Bo were even more complex than Qin Sang’s.  When her master was trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, Liuli was only at the Qi Refining stage; any disturbance in the cultivation world could kill her. If not for Dongyang Bo and the Shao Hua Mountain's protection, providing her a haven on Jingyue Peak, she would have faced countless hardships, and whether she would even have the chance to rescue her master was uncertain.</p><p>Yet, it was this same man’s schemes that trapped her with the mark of the evil technique, leaving her unable to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, then dashed to a cliff face, using his sword to carve out a tomb. Liuli moved Dongyang Bo's body inside, his face oriented north.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the sealed tomb.  He never imagined he would one day be burying Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The cold wind stirred the mountain flowers, releasing their fragrance.  After a moment's thought, Qin Sang used his sword to carve four words on the nearby stone wall— *Sect Leader*.</p><p>…</p><p>After burying Dongyang Bo, Qin Sang and Liuli didn’t hesitate; they immediately flew towards the depths of the Sacred Land. They knew the location of the stele, so their speed far exceeded that of the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>They passed the last floating mountain.  Qin Sang looked back.</p><p>In the distance, on the numerous floating mountains, strange lights occasionally erupted – perhaps battles, or the discovery of treasures.  Occasionally, scattered figures flew into the depths of the Sacred Land, their purpose the same as theirs – attracted by the white light, seeking their fortune.  These people were at least at the Nascent Soul stage; otherwise, they wouldn't have reached the stele alive.</p><p>Whew!</p><p>A sudden, violent gust of wind struck them.  Having just entered the deeper regions of the sacred grounds, they encountered a turbulent current far more powerful than anything they'd faced before.</p><p>Qin Sang, having been warned by the Sky Eye Butterfly, deftly maneuvered with Liuli, easily avoiding the chaotic currents.  He didn't use his lightning-based escape technique here. Firstly, he worried Liuli wouldn't be able to keep up, and secondly, he wasn't sure where the Hun Mo elder and the others were;  lightning travel was too conspicuous.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang transmitted a message: "I hope, Miss Liuli, you will never mention that tribulation thunder to anyone."</p><p>Using the tribulation thunder to draw out Yin Changsheng's heavenly tribulation had been a desperate measure.  Life and death hung in the balance; Qin Sang hadn't had time to consider the consequences.  Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun had been sealed in the blood pool at the time—their experience is unknown—but Liuli had been present. However, Liuli had been fully focused on stabilizing her mind and resisting the erosion of the evil curse, so she likely hadn't noticed the thunder originated from the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't offer a contrived explanation about magical treasures or divine abilities. That would only have aroused suspicion.  Liuli, being extremely intelligent, understood Qin Sang's unspoken meaning and immediately swore an oath on her inner demon.</p><p>As they spoke, they flew deeper. The ever-shifting currents forced them to constantly change direction. After a considerable time of flight, they still hadn't found Jiang Dianzhu and Mei Zhanglao, so they decided to meet at the stone stele.</p><p>While the spatial turbulence was dangerous, with their abilities, they weren't overly concerned. The stele was located at the very edge of the deepest part of the sacred grounds. Beyond that lay the most perilous region, even challenging for powerful cultivators.</p><p>During their flight, Qin Sang kept a sharp lookout while simultaneously focusing a portion of his attention on his energy center, repeatedly touching the fragments of the killing sword, hoping to awaken the sword spirit and receive guidance.  Unfortunately, each attempt was met with silence; the sword spirit seemed to have depleted its energy and fallen into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. They could only enter this vast and dangerous area once every three hundred years. If they had to search inch by inch, how long would it take?</p><p>His thoughts raced, but his speed remained undiminished.  As they neared the stele, Qin Sang spotted Jiang Dianzhu and Mei Zhanglao.  They were standing motionless, staring ahead with expressions of disbelief.</p><p>Before them, in the dark depths, a white mist billowed.  The mist seemed endless, rapidly spreading outwards.  Even when swallowed by the turbulent currents, it replenished itself instantly.  A strange energy emanated from the mist.</p><p>Even without using his spiritual sense, Qin Sang could perceive a mysterious space ahead. The spreading mist indicated that the space was expanding, or perhaps the space had always been a part of the sacred grounds, gradually opening up.</p><p>The stele and the lotus platform had vanished!</p>
