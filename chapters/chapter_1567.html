<h1>Chapter 1558: The Gu King</h1><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A biting wind howled, a blizzard raged.</p><p>The snowflakes were as large as mats.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, only white remained.</p><p>Centered on the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, an extremely cold region formed.  Wherever the chill reached, the sea froze rapidly, becoming a massive ice sheet.</p><p>These snowflakes were no ordinary snowflakes; they were condensed blade intent, incredibly sharp.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade tore through the air, appearing where the Sea-巡海夜叉 had vanished. Its tip pointed downward at the seabed, its blade intent pouring forth.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Countless snowflakes pierced the ice sheet.</p><p>The ice sheet was riddled with holes, but the chill was even stronger than before, rapidly spreading downwards and outwards. At this rate, a large area of the sea would be frozen.</p><p>Below the surface of the sea.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉, riding a blue shark, fled swiftly underwater, incredibly agile and unimpeded.</p><p>Sensing the change in energy above, the Sea-巡海夜叉 raised its head, seeing only a blinding white expanse, as if the sky were collapsing.  A fierce look flashed in its eyes.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉's aura merged with its mount, pushing its speed to the limit. Its legs clamped tightly around the blue shark, which showed an expression of pain, but was completely unable to control its own body.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Sea-巡海夜叉's expression stiffened slightly, then became agile again.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade hummed.</p><p>The blade trembled violently, shooting out a ten thousand-zhang-long blade aura, a white streak across the sky, like a white rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>It was midday, yet even the sunlight felt cold.</p><p>Zhou Jin and the others were fleeing on their flying artifacts. Feeling something, they all turned to see this astonishing sight, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>The divine blade descended!</p><p>The ice sheet shattered with a boom, countless ice shards swept up by the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, tearing through the sea, leaving a huge trench in its wake.</p><p>The seawater on either side couldn't close in time, instead being impacted by the storm of ice shards, forming mountain-like waves on both sides.  These waves froze at their highest point, transforming into two ice mountains.</p><p>The ice mountains wound like dragons.</p><p>Situated between the ice mountains, the trench seemed bottomless, highlighting the astonishing power of that single strike.</p><p>Within the trench, the Sea-巡海夜叉 and the blue shark were exposed.</p><p>Before the blade even arrived, the icy blade intent enveloped them, sealing the surrounding void, and ice spread across their bodies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sea-巡海夜叉 made no attempt to counterattack, allowing itself to be frozen.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an ice sculpture formed.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉's expression suddenly became rigid, then its figure disappeared into thin air—it was an illusion. Only the blue shark remained frozen.</p><p>Qin Sang hovered in the air, looking down.  His expression didn't change. He altered his hand seals, reversed the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, and swung it directly past the blue shark, towards the depths of the trench.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A roar echoed from the trench.</p><p>The roar reverberated between the ice walls, spiraling and amplifying. By the time it escaped the trench, it was earth-shattering.  Zhou Jin and the others heard it clearly, and were all terrified.</p><p>The roar originated from a blue shark.</p><p>This blue shark looked no different from the others, but its size was enormous, ten times larger than the frozen one, comparable to a whale.</p><p>The gigantic blue shark half-turned its body, looking up angrily at Qin Sang.  It lashed its tail, its scales opening and closing. Using its powerful body and brute strength, it slammed into the Snow-Treading Divine Blade.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The shockwave shattered the ice walls on either side, and seawater poured in.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Blade was initially impeded, but ultimately broke through the blue shark's scales and split its skull.</p><p>Qin Sang flickered, appearing above, glancing around, and murmured with some regret, "What a masterful illusion and water escape technique!  Too bad I didn't bring the Sky-Eye Butterfly."</p><p>Before his words faded, the blue shark's remains dissipated, turning into two pools of seawater.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉 had vanished without a trace.</p><p>The sea was its home turf.</p><p>The Sea-巡海夜叉 was extremely cautious, maintaining a distance from the battlefield.  Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, it fled immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang also had to worry about ambushes. Even if he had directly used the four-fold serpent seal, the chances of success were low.</p><p>He released his spiritual sense, but couldn't detect the Sea-巡海夜叉's aura.  He could only put away the Snow-Treading Divine Blade, flash out of the trench, and find the ice sculpture that had been flung out by the shockwave.</p><p>He had carefully controlled his strength earlier.  The blue shark was still alive, floating on the surface with its belly up. Its eyes darted around wildly as it struggled fiercely, but it couldn't break free from the ice prison.  Seeing Qin Sang approach, its expression was one of terror.</p><p>"I know you're intelligent!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the ice, "Answer my questions!"</p><p>The blue shark nodded repeatedly, its head bumping against the ice with a series of clunks.</p><p>"Are you aquatic cultivators who have been practicing here, or did you wander here from elsewhere? Where is your lair? Why are you here? How many other demon kings are nearby?" Qin Sang's gaze locked onto the blue shark's eyes.</p><p>The blue shark didn't hesitate. It opened its bloody maw, revealing a mouthful of fangs, yet its voice was thin and reedy, timid. "My lord, I and my king have been cultivating in the deep sea, and have never harmed humans.  Recently, the king suddenly led his army here to attack the treasure ship.  It was the king's order.  Please, my lord, understand. I have always been his mount and have little knowledge. I don't know the king's intentions, only that he mentioned other kings would follow…"</p><p>"My lord?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, a knowing smile playing on his lips. He ignored the blue shark’s fawning gaze and fell into thought.</p><p>He then asked a few more questions. The blue shark answered truthfully, but couldn't provide the information Qin Sang sought.</p><p>The sea-patrolling yakshas had indeed just arrived.</p><p>Demon kings were rushing to the southern island chain. Could there be a secret there, a secret even the demon race knew about?</p><p>This place was not safe to stay.</p><p>Qin Sang put a little more pressure on his foot, shattering the ice.</p><p>The blue shark regained its freedom, but dared not leave without an order, trembling, it stayed close to Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang hopped onto the blue shark's back, pointed towards the southern island chain, "Let's go!"</p><p>The blue shark didn't utter a sound, parting the water and cutting through the waves.  Before long, they caught up with Zhou Jin and the others. With Qin Sang's permission, everyone was carried back by the blue shark.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained silent, and the others dared not speak.</p><p>In this silence, they encountered no beast hordes and returned safely to the southern island chain.</p><p>"Disperse."</p><p>Stepping onto the land, Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Leng Qi and the others finally had a chance to thank him, bowing to Qin Sang before departing with various thoughts on their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and saw the blue shark by the shore, peering at him expectantly.</p><p>He casually picked up some mud, molded it into a crude bowl, conjured a bowl of water, and said to the blue shark, "Get in."</p><p>The blue shark was dumbfounded, staring blankly at the ugly bowl, highly reluctant, but dared not resist, shrinking obediently.</p><p>In the palm-sized bowl, the blue shark looked like a small fry, swimming around.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the bowl to Zhou Jin, "Take it back to the inn and keep it in the pond in the backyard."</p><p>Zhou Jin dared not be as casual as Qin Sang. The blue shark was stronger than he was, so he carefully received the bowl with both hands, terrified of spilling it, and followed closely behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled back to the inn and shut himself in.</p><p>On the day they landed, news of the great demons' appearance spread like wildfire throughout the southern island chain.  Coupled with the stormy weather, it caused widespread panic.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>A violent storm raged.</p><p>A figure appeared before the small courtyard Qin Sang rented.</p><p>The protective barrier was triggered.</p><p>Inside the house, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. He exclaimed in surprise, "Faster than expected!"</p><p>"Open the courtyard gate and welcome the honored guest!"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice message to the Zhou and Ruan couple.</p><p>They were by the pond watching the blue shark.  They exchanged a surprised look.  Their senses detected no one outside the courtyard.</p><p>They hastily deactivated the barrier, opened the gate, saw the elderly man standing outside, and respectfully said,  "Senior, please come in."</p><p>The old man was simply dressed in coarse linen, yet his demeanor was extraordinary.</p><p>He nodded slightly and followed Zhou Jin to the main hall, pausing slightly, stroking his long beard, and studying Ruan Yu, who was standing at the door.</p><p>Staring at her.</p><p>Ruan Yu's cheeks flushed, her heart filled with alarm.</p><p>Zhou Jin felt anger, but dared not express it.</p><p>"Excellent!  Exceptional aptitude.  Unfortunately, her previous injuries affected her, otherwise she would have had a great chance at Golden Core cultivation. I have a Zhao Yuan Pill here; it should benefit you."</p><p>The elder produced a jade bottle containing a pill.</p><p>The Zhou and Ruan couple were stunned.</p><p>Ruan Yu was flustered, unsure how to respond, let alone accept it.</p><p>"Ruan Yu, don't you thank the senior for his kindness?"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice came from inside the house.</p><p>Ruan Yu was delighted to hear this, took the bottle, and performed a deep curtsy. "Thank you, senior, for the pill."</p><p>"My surname is Leng."</p><p>An old man chuckled, turned, and entered the main hall.  He announced loudly, "Cold You, Left Protector of the Gu God Cult, has come uninvited. I hope I haven't disturbed Daoist Qin's cultivation?"</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his secluded chamber. "Daoist Cold, you've brought a grand gift upon arrival. I'm more than grateful."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, inviting the elder to sit.  "The Three Cold Disciples are..." he inquired curiously.</p><p>The elder nodded. "They are my three rather inept disciples.  My apologies for their earlier lack of manners.  Please don't mind them, Daoist Qin. Compared to saving their lives from the beast, a few Chao Yuan Pills are insignificant."</p><p>Qin Sang understood, smiling faintly. "So, you've come at your disciples' request? You're remarkably swift!" His tone held a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly sensed something. The elder had surely been near the Southern Red Archipelago – whether for other reasons or deliberately lurking, only time would tell.</p><p>The disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivator was significant, yet ultimately inconsequential to most factions.</p><p>Legends of ancient immortal sects' remains persisted only as stories.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators were all busy cultivating and dealing with tribulations; sending a few favored disciples to investigate the East Sea was already considered serious attention.  They would only personally intervene once they had concrete leads.</p><p>If it weren't for the two immortal palaces, Qin Sang wouldn't have been personally involved, let alone sent his physical manifestation.</p><p>The Demon King.</p><p>The hidden Yuan Ying cultivators...</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a brewing storm, himself at its epicenter – a blessing or a curse?</p><p>The elder seemed oblivious to the sarcasm in Qin Sang's tone, his smile unwavering. "Hearing Cold Qi describe your astounding abilities, I'm filled with admiration. I always considered myself well-informed, yet I was unaware of a master like you! How embarrassing!"</p><p>"Your disciple likely exaggerated."  Qin Sang remained impassive. "Besides, the world is vast and brimming with heroes; one cannot know them all.  Please don't mind me, Daoist Cold. I'd never heard of the Gu God Cult before."</p><p>Upon hearing the elder identify himself as from the Gu God Cult, Qin Sang's mind raced, recalling various factions. He'd diligently collected information to familiarize himself with the Central Plains cultivation world, but the Gu God Cult was missing.</p><p>The elder, a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, was merely a protector in the Gu God Cult, implying other protectors and a higher-ranking leader.</p><p>How could such a powerful faction remain unknown?  A hidden force that emerged only after the Nascent Soul cultivator's disappearance?</p><p>The name 'Gu God Cult' struck a sensitive chord in Qin Sang.</p><p>He recalled the Cold disciples' abilities during the beast encounter.</p><p>After the ship shattered, the three worked together, unleashing brightly colored powders and liquids from numerous pouches – potent poisons.  The colors were chaotic yet followed a distinct pattern.</p><p>They created a vibrant toxic field.  Beasts either convulsed and died or dissolved into pus; even the strongest bodies couldn't withstand it.  Their methods were ruthless.</p><p>Cold Qi was particularly skilled in poison attacks.  He opened his mouth, revealing a purple-scaled snake head that spewed poisonous smoke into the toxic field, significantly amplifying its power.</p><p>Others kept their distance, wary of the three.</p><p>"This 'Gu' is different... it's poison magic! That snake isn't a spirit insect, but a cultivated venomous beast.  Not the witch tribe's insect Gu; it seems unrelated to them…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a pretty good idea of the Three Cold Disciples' background.</p><p>What abilities did this old poisoner possess?</p><p>The fat silkworm was undoubtedly their nemesis.  His manifestation, being a spirit wood body, wasn't afraid of ordinary poisons, but many toxins could harm his soul, disrupting or even stagnating his true energy – he had to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>The elder remained unruffled, smiling. "We haven't met before; our fate was lacking."</p><p>He produced an iron token and offered it to Qin Sang.  The front displayed the words "Gu God," while the back depicted a peculiar crown. Five differently colored jade pieces adorned its edges, their meaning unclear.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"I've only given out two Gu God tokens to compatible individuals. Though we've just met, I admire your righteous character and appreciate you saving my disciples. Don't worry; the token imposes no restrictions, signifying only a distinguished status. You'll hear about my cult often; if you encounter trouble, we'll offer full assistance!" The elder was brimming with confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe such generosity existed.  Since there were no obligations, he decided to accept the token and see what the Gu God Cult was truly about.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang accept it, the elder's smile widened.</p><p>After some pleasantries, the elder finally revealed his purpose, inquiring about Qin Sang's findings while hunting the Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and didn't hide anything. He instructed Zhou Ruan to take the elder to the backyard pond to question the Blue Shark.</p>
