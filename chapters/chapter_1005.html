<h1>Chapter 997 Soul Light</h1><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids fluttered, and he slowly opened his eyes, awakening from his meditative state. With a thought, a sword light flashed from between his eyebrows.</p><p>The Ebony Sword had completed its transformation.</p><p>The sword's power was far greater than before, having advanced to a high-grade magical treasure!</p><p>This was because Qin Sang had only used a portion of the Soul Nourishing Wood in order to quickly inscribe Killing Talismans and improve his cultivation.</p><p>Outwardly, the Ebony Sword didn't look much different, but as the spirit sword's master, Qin Sang could clearly sense its improvement.</p><p>Sword shadows flickered, and streams of light danced.</p><p>Qin Sang urged the spirit sword, performing various sword techniques effortlessly and freely.</p><p>Afterwards, he withdrew the Ebony Sword, letting it hover before him.</p><p>Gazing at the spirit sword, Qin Sang wore a thoughtful expression.</p><p>After refining the Infernal Bloodwood last time, he obtained the divine ability of Bloodfiend Divine Light, which had proven invaluable. He wondered what benefits the Soul Nourishing Wood would bring.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The Bloodfiend Divine Light wasn't unique to the Ebony Sword. Any magical treasure refined using Infernal Bloodwood could acquire a similar divine ability. This was the inherent power of the divine wood itself.</p><p>However, the Soul Nourishing Wood seemed to only possess the ability to nourish the soul and didn't have any similar divine abilities. He hadn't seen any related records in ancient texts either.</p><p>After all, even in the ancient cultivation world, the Ten Divine Woods were rare treasures.</p><p>The divine wood originally emitted an uncontrollable blue soul light.</p><p>His eyes flickered.  Gazing at the sword's body, he discovered a faint layer of soul light on the Ebony Sword, giving it a gentle aura, concealing its sharpness, and making it appear less like an instrument of slaughter.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. He withdrew the Ebony Sword into his Nascent Soul and carefully examined it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang noticed something different.</p><p>Now, his Nascent Soul and his lifebound spirit sword felt perfectly harmonious. The layer of soul light was as gentle as water, as if it could soothe all wounds.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang even more was that although his realm remained unchanged, his divine sense had undergone a subtle transformation.</p><p>"The Soul Nourishing Wood can indeed strengthen divine sense! No, wait..."</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang finally discovered the source of the change. "Nourished by the soul light, my Nascent Soul seems more solid, and my divine sense feels refined, as if it has been tempered, rather than simply increasing in power..."</p><p>Although this change was subtle and wouldn't have an immediate effect, over time, these subtle improvements would accumulate, resulting in a significant enhancement.</p><p>Having confirmed this, Qin Sang put aside his doubts, a joyful expression appearing on his face. "Body refinement, True Essence, and Divine Sense... Could I now be considered a cultivator of all three aspects: essence, energy, and spirit?"</p><p>He continued to ponder and gained further insights.</p><p>"If I had a lifebound spirit sword crafted from Soul Nourishing Wood at the beginning of cultivating the 'Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter,' the pain I endured would have been much less, and I wouldn't have needed the Jade Buddha."</p><p>Qin Sang discovered another benefit of the Soul Nourishing Wood and sighed, "I wonder how those predecessors dealt with the drawbacks of the cultivation method. They couldn't have simply given everyone a piece of Soul Nourishing Wood, could they?"</p><p>He cherished the sword so much that he remained in his cave dwelling for a whole day before emerging.</p><p>Bai's cave was next door.</p><p>After entering the city, Bai had immediately gone into seclusion with spirit herbs and likely wouldn't emerge anytime soon.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang stayed in the city.</p><p>The shop was merely a front, only occasionally opening for business.  Qin Sang focused on two things: inquiring about the Heavenly Dao Sect and improving his cultivation.</p><p>Unknowingly, three years passed.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged with the last Tyrant Blood Fruit beside him.</p><p>Over the past three years, he had never stopped cultivating.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, now a high-grade magical treasure, could easily withstand the inscription of Killing Talismans.  Combined with the accumulation of the past decades, his progress was rapid, and his cultivation increased at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Qin Sang had a premonition that a breakthrough was imminent, and he should be able to reach the late stage of Core Formation within the next few years.</p><p>He planned to visit the Heavenly Dao Sect after both his cultivation and physical body had made breakthroughs, further increasing his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang initially intended to contact the Ning surname swordsman discreetly after finding him.</p><p>Although the Heavenly Dao Sect had a considerable number of Core Formation disciples, it wasn't difficult to inquire about them. He deliberately befriended some fellow Daoists and, after some investigation, discovered that there was no one with the surname Ning among those disciples.</p><p>Either the swordsman was concealing himself very well, or he wasn't a Core Formation disciple but a Nascent Soul ancestor.</p><p>For the sake of the ancient teleportation formation, he had to meet him.  If he couldn't find the person, he would have no choice but to visit the sect directly.</p><p>This made Qin Sang somewhat apprehensive.</p><p>Although he felt that Senior Qingzhu had no reason to harm him, he believed that it was best to be cautious.</p><p>After both breakthroughs, his escape techniques wouldn't be much inferior to those of a Nascent Soul ancestor. If anything unexpected happened, he would have a chance to escape.</p><p>Having realized this, Qin Sang focused his energy on cultivation.</p><p>As his cultivation improved, his physical body also benefited.</p><p>The medicinal power of the previous Tyrant Blood Fruit had been completely absorbed.  Qin Sang was prepared to refine the last one and strive for the late stage of the third level of the "Celestial Demon Body Refining Art".</p><p>Qin Sang entered a meditative state, forgetting both his body and soul, and adjusted his internal state.</p><p>He wore a single layer of clothing, but his seemingly thin body contained astonishing power.</p><p>His was a physical body comparable to a demonic beast; Qin Sang himself was like a humanoid beast.</p><p>His blood flowed like mercury, his vital essence abundant.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's muscles tightened, and his bones cracked. He reached for the jade box, took the Tyrant Blood Fruit, and without hesitation, put it into his mouth.</p><p>The spirit herb entered his stomach and transformed into a stream of heat.  The violent medicinal power instantly erupted.</p><p>Having experienced consuming Tyrant Blood Fruit twice before, Qin Sang remained calm, stabilizing himself and enduring the intense pain as he refined the spirit herb, undergoing the agony of cleansing his marrow and tendons.</p><p>His muscles trembled, his entire skin flushed crimson, and his blood seemed as if it would seep out.</p><p>Sweat poured from Qin Sang, but he remained steadily seated, focusing all his energy on refining the medicinal power.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>The ground around Qin Sang was soaked with sweat, and his skin had taken on a glazed sheen.  The effects of cleansing his marrow and tendons were still present but not as pronounced as in lower realms.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's condition gradually stabilized, and the crimson color faded from his skin.</p><p>Although he didn't immediately break through like the Two-Headed Flood Dragon after consuming the Tyrant Blood Fruit, Qin Sang had a premonition that once he refined a portion of the medicinal power, a breakthrough would be a natural progression.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang focused solely on channeling the power of the celestial stars to refine his body, without any distractions.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>A figure appeared above a stretch of sea outside the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>After circling in the air for a while and confirming that there was no one around, a flash of cyan light emanated from the figure, and a pair of magnificent phoenix wings suddenly manifested.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang, and after two months of arduous cultivation, he had successfully broken through to the late stage of the third level of the "Celestial Demon Body Refining Art".</p><p>Qin Sang examined the wings on his back. From initially being illusory, they had become more solid with each advancement, increasingly resembling real phoenix wings.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>About to enter the Seven Slaughters Hall for the third time, which is also the time when all the events of this volume will explode.</p><p>I feel it's still not quite right, and I'm currently combing through the plot of this volume from beginning to end, striving for perfection.</p><p>I haven't finished yet, so I just posted a short chapter today.  Don't wait up, everyone. I'll also take this opportunity to adjust my schedule.  I'll add more chapters as appropriate after I'm done.</p>
