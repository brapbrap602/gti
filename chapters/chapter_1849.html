Chapter 1840: The Divine Firmament Conclave


What is a God?


Upon hearing this question, Wan Zhenren fell into deep contemplation.


This was perhaps a question pondered by every Daoist cultivator. They were accustomed to the presence of Altar Guardian Deities and had heard countless legends about Celestial Deities.


If the legends were false, how could talismans summon Altar Guardian Deities? If the legends were true, why could these deities only guard altars, and why were all manner of divine arts and secret techniques for summoning spirits and deities useless beyond that?


Where were the Celestial Deities? Where did the Altar Guardian Deities come from? The Dao Court could bestow titles upon Earth Deities, so were Celestial Deities also appointed by the Dao Court?


"Talismans have no fixed form, they rely on spiritual connection. With the talisman as the vessel, a connected spirit becomes a deity," the old Daoist slowly uttered these four sentences.


Hearing these words, Wan Zhenren's expression shifted dramatically. At his level of cultivation, he could sometimes vaguely perceive this truth, yet he still found it hard to believe. "Gods are... Talisman Deities?"


The old Daoist didn't answer. His gaze reached far into the distant past, as if peering through the ages. He softly continued, "The Dao of Talismans originated with the Zhengyi Sect and culminated in the Divine Firmament Sect. At the dawn of the Dao's propagation, the sages of the Zhengyi Celestial Master Sect observed the transformations of the celestial phenomena and the profound qi flowing through the heavens, thus comprehending the Dao of Talismans. A talisman is a spark of divine light, connecting heaven and earth, a vessel for the spirit, thus forming a Talisman Deity, containing the essence of talismanic arts. Later, they created talismanic rituals, combining breathing techniques to create scriptures, and passed them down to future generations. Talismanic rituals connect with deities, inviting them into the altar. Through constant communion, later generations could grasp the Dao of the masters and further develop it. Thus, the Dao of Talismans was established."


"At the inception of the Dao of Talismans, each sect's Talisman Deities were different and independent of each other."


"In ancient times, during the rise of the Divine Firmament Sect, enlightened Grandmasters announced to all Daoist sects, inviting the True Masters of every sect to gather at the Divine Firmament Upper Palace to integrate breathing techniques, inner alchemy methods, spirit cultivation methods, talismanic arts, shamanic rituals, esoteric techniques, and so forth, to establish the Daoist code and regulations."


"The True Masters agreed and jointly established the Dao Court, built the Divine Court, and forged the Talisman Deities!"


"With the Celestial Master as the supreme authority, they opened the Nine Heavenly Golden阙 within the Divine Firmament Upper Palace. Below the Nine Heavenly Golden阙, they established the Governing, Pacifying, and Altar divisions, forming the rudimentary structure of the Dao Court. They established nine ranks of Celestial Officials and bestowed the High Divine Firmament Title. True Masters from various sects were appointed to positions within the Dao Court to govern the world. Their internal responsibilities included overseeing the four directions, while externally, they acted as emissaries of Heaven, spreading its teachings.  Whether Daoist cultivators or others, all were subject to the Dao Court's authority, known as the Divine Firmament Grand Decree."


"The responsibility of the Dao Court was to promote the prosperity of the Daoist sects, defend against external evils, transmit the Daoist lineage, and establish order from the previous state of disarray. It truly marked the beginning of our Daoist prosperity. The Celestial Masters and Grandmasters, studying the essential methods of each sect, cultivated scriptures to define the nine cultivation ranks, summoning the Talisman Deities of all sects into the Divine Court, transforming them into Celestial Deities through talismans!"


"The Divine Court is the dwelling place of the Talisman Deities. It is a talismanic formation formed by the condensed divine intent of Daoist cultivators from across the world, residing high in the Nine Heavens, invisible and unattainable."


"At that time, the cultivation world revered Thunder Arts. Thunder is the pivot of heaven and earth. The celestial pivot and earthly mechanism, Yang Thunder and Yin Lightning, pivoting yin and activating yang, governing all things. All sects possessed Thunder Arts, and there were countless Thunder Dao Talisman Deities, with the Divine Firmament Sect's Thunder Arts being the most exceptional."


"The Dao Court, based on Thunder Arts, constructed the nine-layered Divine Court according to the legends of the Nine Heavens and Nine Skies, and divided the Talisman Deities into nine levels of authority, corresponding to the cultivation ranks. The highest ninth heaven is called the Divine Firmament Jade Clarity Wondrous Scenery Great Existence Heaven, followed by the Purple Firmament Harmonious Scenery Twin阙 Transformation Body Heaven.  Enshrined in the eighth heaven is the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable, known to later generations as the Thunder Ancestor!"


"Besides Thunder Arts, other Dao, such as Yin-Yang, Five Elements, and Constellations, all had their designated places within the Divine Court, but were subordinate to the Thunder Department. Because Thunder Arts Talisman Deities were revered, the Divine Court was also known as the Thunder City, or the Heavenly Deities of the Thunder Department."


"From then on, talismanic rituals also changed, becoming the credentials for connecting with the Divine Court. Our Daoist cultivators, regardless of sect or Dao Court temple, could communicate with the Divine Court through talismanic rituals, invoking divine beings and summoning corresponding Celestial Deities to descend upon the altar. Those with profound cultivation could even summon Celestial Deities to empower their troops, greatly increasing their strength to defend against external enemies."


"The Dao Court established a Capital Merit Official within the Governing division, who held the Capital Merit Seal. The Capital Merit Seal was the manifestation and extension of the Divine Court's power in the mortal world. With each established Governing division, the strength of the Daoist sects increased.  As Daoism flourished and the divine intent of more and more cultivators converged in the Nine Heavens, the Divine Court became increasingly stable."


"One can imagine, as long as the Divine Court remains intact, even if all the Celestial Masters ascend or perish, the Talisman Deities will remain, ensuring the eternal prosperity of Daoism."


"This conclave is considered the grandest event in Daoist history, known as the Divine Firmament Conclave!"


The old Daoist spoke at a measured pace, reminiscing about the past glories of Daoism while revealing secrets that were enough to shock anyone.


The astonishment on Wan Zhenren's face deepened. Only now did he understand the profound foundation of Daoism.


As the old Daoist's voice gradually faded, Wan Zhenren returned to his senses, speechless for a long time. But he quickly realized that the Dao Court his martial uncle described seemed vastly different from the present one.


The Dao Court of that time only had the Divine Firmament Grand Decree, without the Celestial Pivot Institute or the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute.


Also, why could they only summon deities to descend upon the altar now, and not have Celestial Deities empower their troops?


He opened his mouth, about to ask his questions, but saw his martial uncle gazing towards the White Stone Governing Altar outside the hall, lost in thought. He quickly closed his mouth, not daring to disturb him.


After a while, the old Daoist withdrew his gaze and looked at Wan Zhenren. His eyes seemed to penetrate everything, seeing through his heart.


"Our Daoist nine cultivation ranks are Zhengyi, Moral Dao, Cave Deity, Ascending Profundity, Penetrating Profundity, Five Talismans, River Chart, Penetrating Truth, and Completing the Dao. Among them, the Completing the Dao rank is the most special and shouldn't be a separate rank. Legend says that Penetrating Truth has three steps, with the third step being Completing the Dao."


"The authority of Talisman Deities corresponds to these ranks. The Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable belongs to the first step of Penetrating Truth."


"Talisman Deities can transmit the Dao, and deducing Talisman Deities is also related to the Dao of Talismans. Another purpose of establishing the Divine Court was to gather the power of Daoism to collectively deduce the Grand Dao!  According to the deductions of past sages and Grandmasters, above the Thunder Ancestor, in the second step of Penetrating Truth, there should be the Southern Pole Longevity Great Emperor."


"Unfortunately, despite the divine wisdom of past Grandmasters and the combined efforts of Daoism, they couldn't manifest this Talisman Deity. After countless failures, the sages and Grandmasters, in their deep reflection, decided to reopen the Divine Firmament Upper Palace and reconvene the Divine Firmament Conclave!"


"Within the Divine Firmament Palace, the True Masters debated the Dao, reportedly arguing for a hundred years, before finally deciding to drastically change the methods, alter the Daoist system, and transform the Divine Court."


"The Nine Heavens and Nine Skies would continue to serve as the Thunder City, housing the Thunder Department Celestial Deities.  The other deities were invited to leave. Following the celestial constellations, they established a new Divine Court based on the Grand Constellation Formation, recreating the multitude of deities of the Constellation Department.  The deities of the Milky Way encompass all things; wherever the starlight reaches, above and below, there are deities."


"Within the Dao Court, the Celestial Pivot Institute was separated from the Divine Firmament Grand Decree and granted the Capital Merit Title. Thereafter, the Capital Merit Officials, Pacifying Masters, and Altar Masters of each Governing division mostly came from the Celestial Pivot Institute, primarily responsible for overseeing the four directions, governing Daoism, and answering to the Constellation Department deities."


"However..."


The old Daoist's tone suddenly shifted, and he paused.


Wan Zhenren was listening intently, realizing that his martial uncle was about to speak about the origins of the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute.  Having come from the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute, he naturally paid more attention, his expression becoming even more serious.


"However, during that Divine Firmament Conclave, some Grandmasters presented different viewpoints. They believed that Talisman Deities were all illusory deities, lacking a solid foundation and difficult to reach the Grand Dao.  They proposed the theory that cultivators merging with true deities would create true gods."


Hearing this, Wan Zhenren's expression trembled, and he murmured, "Merging with true deities, the Divine Dao..."


"Precisely," the old Daoist nodded. "This inadvertently pioneered the Divine Dao. However, the True Masters at the time didn't agree with this path.  One Celestial Master, against all opposition, willingly offered herself as a test subject, unafraid of martyrdom, finally persuading the others.  But Daoism was in the midst of reform, with countless matters to attend to, making it difficult to provide more support. Moreover, this path deviated from ancient methods. To maintain stability and establish order, they set a rule that the development of this path could not interfere with internal Daoist affairs, so as not to shake the foundation.  Thus, they separated some Celestial Officials from the Dao Court to follow this Celestial Master and established the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute."


"The Earth Deity Empress Houtu?" Wan Zhenren, from the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute, his mind racing, immediately guessed the Celestial Master's identity.


Other sects, including the Celestial Pivot Institute, worshipped Talisman Deities, while only the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute worshipped true gods!


They were deities and also Daoist sages!


"Indeed, it was her. This Celestial Master's Daoist title was Houtu.  She dedicated herself to developing the Divine Dao, deserving the title of Earth Deity Empress!"


"At the beginning of the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute, they investigated ghosts and spirits, eradicated demons and monsters, and eliminated evil. Their purpose was to gather demons and ghosts to verify the Divine Dao.  At that time, the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute was restricted both within and outside of Daoism.  Only the region of the River of Calamity, rarely visited by anyone, was rampant with demons and ghosts.  The True Masters bravely ventured into the River of Calamity to capture them."


"Celestial Master Houtu refined the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Chart, established the Six Heavenly Palaces on Mount Luo in Fengdu, internally manifesting Ghost Department Talisman Deities, and proclaimed herself the Fengdu Great Emperor, also known as the Northern Yin Great Emperor.  She also modified the Capital Merit Seal, passing it to the Exorcism Institute, adding the power to summon Ghost Department Talisman Deities, personally naming it the Northern Emperor Seal."


"The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons were established in Fengdu to imprison demons and ghosts, refining them into ghost soldiers, judging their merits and demerits.  Those willing to submit were merged with deities, bestowed the title of Ghost Deities, and entered the Six Heavenly Palaces to command ghost soldiers, not only expanding the territory for our Daoism.  Furthermore, with the connection between the Fengdu Six Heavenly Palaces and the Divine Court, Fengdu Ghost Deities, like Talisman Deities, could be summoned by talismanic rituals to assist Daoist cultivators!  This meant that the Divine Dao and the Daoist orthodoxy could coexist!"


Speaking of Celestial Master Houtu and the sages of the Exorcism Institute, the old Daoist's face showed reverence.


However, Wan Zhenren discerned a different meaning, and greater doubts arose in his heart.


What was the relationship between the River of Calamity and the Plains of Calamity?  And the origin of the Yin Heavenly Palace, what was its connection to Fengdu?


The old Daoist noticed Wan Zhenren's expression. "At the beginning of creation, yin and yang were undifferentiated, clear and turbid were unseparated, known as the Primordial Qi of the Six Heavens.  The Primordial Qi of the Six Heavens remained in the world, accumulating and sinking, transforming into the River of Calamity in the Great Thousand World, where Primordial Ghosts of the Six Heavens roamed freely, making it a forbidden zone for living beings.  Daoist cultivators, using talismans to communicate with the Divine Court, drew upon the power of the Divine Court to pacify the Primordial Qi of the Six Heavens, summoning Altar Guardian Deities to protect their primordial spirits, enabling them to enter the River of Calamity to hunt demons and ghosts. As for the origin of the Yin Heavenly Palace, it was because the first Palace Master obtained a fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Chart..."


Pausing, the old Daoist continued, ignoring Wan Zhenren's astonished expression, "With Ghost Deities established and the Divine Dao proven viable, Daoism was shaken.  Thus, there was a third Divine Firmament Conclave, and the Divine Firmament Upper Palace was opened once more!"


"This Divine Firmament Conclave solely discussed the Divine Dao."


"Daoism collectively decided to call true gods Earth Deities, to distinguish them from Celestial Deities, and divided Earth Deities into Yin Division and Yang Division, with the Fengdu Six Heavenly Palaces as the Yin Division and the implementation of the Divine Dao in each Governing division as the Yang Division."


"The Yang Division included local deities, river gods, city gods, village deities, dragon palaces, and mountain shrines.  Mountains, rivers, seas, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Four Great Rivers, cities, and nations could all have deities bestowed upon them.  Daoist disciples willing to enter the Divine Dao were often bestowed titles like City God, Mountain God, or Dragon Palace Deity, with the Eastern Mountain Mountain God being the most revered, known as the Eastern Mountain Great Emperor, holding the same authority as the Fengdu Great Emperor. However, the Fengdu Great Emperor at that time was no longer Celestial Master Houtu."


"With the Yin and Yang Divisions established, external enemies like the Primordial Ghosts of the Six Heavens went to Fengdu, while demons, ghosts, and sinful cultivators from each Governing division went to the Mountain God Temples, where their merits and demerits were judged, and their sins determined. The Ghost Deities of both the Yin and Yang Divisions were subject to the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute's summons and dared not commit crimes."


"With the world at peace, Celestial Master Houtu ascended, reaching the second step of Penetrating Truth, and was bestowed the holy name of Supporting Heaven Emulating Dharma Earth Deity Empress Houtu!"


"From then on, the Celestial Pivot Institute's duties remained unchanged, the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute was known as the place for governing all evils and summoning Ghost Deities, and the Divine Firmament Grand Decree, now consisting only of Thunder Arts cultivators, was renamed the Thunder Jade Palace, specializing in Thunder Arts and guarding the Dao Court."


"After the three Divine Firmament Conclaves, with the evolution of laws and regulations, the structure of the Dao Court, with its two institutes and one palace, the three major official institutions, was thus solidified!  This was the golden age of our Daoism."


Reaching this point, the old Daoist became unusually lost in thought, his face filled with longing, envisioning the flourishing scene of Daoism. "At that time, heroes emerged from the two institutes and one palace. Above were the Celestial Deities of the Divine Court, below were the Fengdu Ghost Prisons, and in the mortal world, Earth Deities assisted Celestial Officials in governing, Ghost Soldiers expanded territories, and the Thunder Department guarded everything. Whether within or outside the Dao Court, all obeyed.  At its peak, there were twenty-four Governing divisions alone, eight each of lower, middle, and upper divisions, along with auxiliary divisions, subordinate divisions, roaming divisions, and... the four separate divisions established by the Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute at the edge of the River of Calamity!"


Four separate divisions!


A tempest surged within Wan Zhenren's mind, as he faintly understood something.


Just now, he, like his martial uncle, was imagining the grandeur of Daoism in its prime.


Whether in heaven or on earth, inside or outside the Dao Court, within the cultivation world or the mortal realm, the Dao Court's will was ubiquitous, and its decrees were unquestioned.


But the problem lay precisely here!


Daoist cultivators could enjoy the benefits of the Dao Court, but those outside Daoism had to abide by its system, or face punishment.  As a Dao Court Celestial Official, even though Wan Zhenren was accustomed to the Dao Court, he could imagine how oppressive it must have felt for outside cultivators to be ruled by it.


Cultivators yearned for freedom and unrestrained lives.


Moreover, as the Dao Court grew stronger, incorporating more and more territories under its rule, with the Divine Dao and Talisman Dao coexisting without decline, it would surely cause panic among other forces, and even within Daoism, dissenting voices would arise.


After all, the Daoist orthodoxy wasn't limited to the Talisman Dao!


Thinking of the four separate divisions, the Yin Heavenly Palace's fragment of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Chart, the silent Thunder Jade Palace, the now virtually indistinguishable Northern Dipper Exorcism Institute and Celestial Pivot Institute, and also...


The Divine Dao, originally another major lineage of the Dao Court, was now suppressed, only to be picked up by demons.


Perhaps the Divine Dao was still incomplete when the Dao Court faced upheaval, or perhaps the current Dao Court was too weak to manage the Divine Dao.


Countless thoughts flashed through Wan Zhenren's mind, and he spoke with a strained voice, "Could the Divine Court..."


"The Divine Court has fallen."


The old Daoist sighed. These four words explained everything.


"The Thunder Jade Palace, tasked with guarding, suffered the heaviest losses, with almost all the Thunder Department Celestial Deities shattered.  However, the Divine Court wasn't completely destroyed. Otherwise, we wouldn't even have Altar Guardian Deities, unable to survive in the Plains of Calamity.  Our responsibility is to rediscover the Divine Court.  There's a prophecy that the day the Divine Court is reopened will be the day the Dao Court returns to the Great Thousand World!"


Hearing this, Wan Zhenren's low spirits were instantly lifted, and he also understood why his martial uncle had told him all this.  "Could the Divine Court be within the Jushan Governing Altar?"


The old Daoist said, "It's one of the most likely locations, but regardless, we can't let the demons get there first. Otherwise, do you know the consequences?"


"Demons usurping divine positions!"


Wan Zhenren gasped.
