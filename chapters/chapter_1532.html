<h1>Chapter 1523: The Grand Capture Hand of Xuan Tian Yi Qi (4k)</h1><p>Deep within Qingyang Island.</p><p>A Daoist temple stands tall.</p><p>All traces of Huangtian Sect have been completely erased.</p><p>The temple is hidden amongst towering mountains and dense forests, unassuming in its presence.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's intention; after his departure, Qingyang Temple must maintain a low profile.</p><p>Qin Sang built an ice pool here, where he keeps snow pythons.</p><p>He only kept a late-stage Nascent Soul-level Tian Shan snow python, a captive taken after slaying cultivators surnamed Yue in the Sacred Land. Qin Sang claimed it as his own.</p><p>The late-stage Nascent Soul Tian Shan snow python, combined with a python banner, can barely participate in battles between Nascent Soul cultivators.  It's left with his external avatar to enhance his combat abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang meticulously categorized and stored the remaining resources in two Qingyang Temples, leaving Tan Hao and Li Yu to manage them and support the sect's growth.</p><p>Qingyang Temple gradually gets back on track.</p><p>Qin Sang strives to pave the way for the sect's future.</p><p>He stands atop a mountain peak, his gaze sweeping across the landscape.</p><p>Qingyang Island is vast.</p><p>His vision transcends the towering mountains and valleys, the open fields and rivers. Through the faint morning mist, he vaguely sees the distant shoreline and the undulating waves.</p><p>Further out, the sky and sea merge into a boundless expanse of blue.</p><p>Should he one day meet with misfortune and perish, Qingyang Temple will be the mark he leaves on this world. At least, someone will remember him, the founding ancestor of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang thinks of Jixin Daoist and Mingyue.</p><p>During his travels in Xiaohan Region, he personally visited the places where this master and disciple duo left their blessings.</p><p>The shrines built by the people in the past are often dilapidated, some completely abandoned, swallowed by overgrown weeds and forgotten by time.</p><p>Rabbits enter through dog holes, pheasants fly from rooftops.</p><p>Travelers' grain grows in the courtyard, wild mallows sprout by the well.</p><p>…</p><p>But some shrines still thrive, their stories passed down through generations.  In certain places, monuments and biographies have been erected in their honor, with annual memorial services, almost elevating them to godhood.</p><p>True death is to be forgotten.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang doesn't seek this kind of ‘immortality’. His goals remain unchanged, and he pursues them tirelessly!</p><p>The rising sun disperses the morning mist.</p><p>Qin Sang retracts his gaze, descends the mountain, and returns to his cave abode.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>His external avatar is in deep meditation.</p><p>If people like Liuli were to see it, they would be surprised. The external avatar’s aura has changed; while still belonging to the Ice Dao, there's a noticeable difference.</p><p>This is because Qin Sang has made his external avatar cultivate the Xuan Tian lineage's cultivation technique, the "Qing Wei Record."</p><p>After the change of cultivation method.</p><p>The external avatar can no longer maintain its illusory Nascent Soul form and will gradually condense a real one.</p><p>In the future, the main body's control over the external avatar will decrease, increasing the likelihood of rebellion. However, the "Qing Wei Record" is significantly more profound than the previous technique, offering greater potential.</p><p>The "Qing Wei Record" contains several powerful divine abilities.</p><p>However, what most excites Qin Sang is that after cultivating the "Qing Wei Record," his external avatar can cultivate the Luo You Divine Prohibition, or the Xuan Qi Giant Hand divine ability once used by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>This divine ability is called "The Grand Capture Hand of Xuan Tian Yi Qi."</p><p>Of course, cultivating such top-tier divine abilities is extremely difficult and demanding, requiring immense mental energy. One person can hardly manage two at once. Qin Sang is still undecided, waiting for Liuli's improved Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>The main body enters the cave.</p><p>The external avatar senses it, stops cultivating, opens its eyes, and says, "You're back."</p><p>The main body nods, "My friend, you've worked hard."</p><p>"You are me, I am you."</p><p>The external avatar smiles brightly, its expression lively and indistinguishable from a normal person, "Since we seek immortality, what is hardship?"</p><p>Having said that, the external avatar opens its mouth, and a stream of light flies out—a nascent Nascent Soul, beginning to take shape. The external avatar’s expression stiffens, losing its liveliness.</p><p>The solidified Nascent Soul is equivalent to Qin Sang's second Nascent Soul.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul pauses slightly before merging into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Qin Sang uses his own essence to nurture the second Nascent Soul, striving to maintain a close connection between the external avatar and his main body, reducing the possibility of betrayal.</p><p>After putting away the second Nascent Soul and the avatar, Qin Sang cultivates for a short while when he senses a disturbance in the cave's restrictions.  He scans his divine sense outward and finds that Shi Xue has come to visit.</p><p>"Junior Sister sensed the tribulation."</p><p>Shi Xue stands at the entrance, her voice low and serious.</p><p>Qin Sang nods, rises, leaves the cave, and flies with Shi Xue towards the pre-selected tribulation site.</p><p>Their expressions are not burdened with worry, and their hearts are calm.</p><p>The chances of a Nascent Soul cultivator surviving their first tribulation are high, unless they are severely injured or encounter other special circumstances. Moreover, Liuli’s strength is unmatched by other cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Qin Sang leaves Liuli on Qingyang Island to undergo the tribulation to deter any potential troublemakers.</p><p>In a short span of time, two cultivators on Qingyang Island successfully ascended to the Yuan Ying stage, adding to the already formidable reputation of Qin Sang.  This makes Qingyang Sect a top-tier sect anywhere. Even if he remains absent for a long time, anyone considering attacking Qingyang Sect would think twice.</p><p>Before reaching the tribulation site, the two felt the immense pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation.  Looking into the distance, although it was a clear day, a dark cloud inexplicably gathered on the horizon, growing larger and larger, accompanied by continuous thunder.</p><p>The tribulation site was a secluded field; the surrounding area had been cleared of any onlookers.  Tan Hao arrived earlier.</p><p>“Brother Qin! Master Shi!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Tan Hao approached, bowing respectfully, “The island’s protective formation has been activated. I just flew around and sensed some furtive glances, but no one dares to approach Qingyang Island.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “Thank you, Brother Tan, for leading the disciples in managing the formation. Master Shi and I will go ahead to protect Fellow Daoist Liuli.”</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang and Shi Xue flew to a nearby mountain, from where they could see the lone figure in the field.</p><p>Liuli, as always, was without makeup, clad in simple white robes.  The Heavenly Tribulation approached, dark clouds gathered, and a fierce wind howled. Her black hair danced in the wind.  Liuli glanced in their direction, then raised her head, intently watching the increasingly thick tribulation clouds, awaiting the arrival of the tribulation.</p><p>A flash of sword light.</p><p>A phoenix-shaped sword appeared, transforming into a stream of light, circling Liuli.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The thunder was deafening. The tribulation clouds blotted out the sun, and the ominous clouds above Qingyang Island were visible from afar, along with a hint of the Heavenly Tribulation's might.</p><p>On an outer island of the Cui Ming Archipelago, two middle-aged men were playing Go. The black player was a Yuan Ying cultivator; the white player, though only at the Golden Core stage, showed no signs of constraint, indicating a close friendship.  Both were members of a trading guild from the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't prohibit other cultivators from entering the Cui Ming Archipelago, so the active trading guild began to consider setting up a branch there; these two were pioneers.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The black player was the first to notice something unusual.  He dropped his piece, his figure flashing as he appeared in mid-air. Moments later, the white player followed, looking in the direction of Qingyang Island along with the Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>“That’s… someone undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation?”</p><p>The white player hesitated, “Wasn't there someone who ascended to Yuan Ying on Qingyang Island a few years ago?  Has Old Demon Qin cultivated so many talented disciples?”</p><p>“It’s not a Yuan Ying tribulation,” the black player stared for a long time, shaking his head, “It’s the three-hundred-year cycle Four Nine Tribulation. Judging by the aura, it seems to be a first-time Four Nine Tribulation.”</p><p>“The Four Nine Tribulation… Could it be Old Demon Qin himself?  There are rumors in Xuan Tian Palace that Old Demon Qin's talent is extraordinary; he reached Yuan Ying in less than three hundred years and his strength now surpasses all in the cultivation world.”</p><p>The white player looked doubtful and apprehensive, his voice unconsciously tinged with fear when mentioning Qin Sang.</p><p>The black player pondered, “A month ago, I visited the island and had the honor of meeting him.  There was no sign of a Heavenly Tribulation aura about him, so it shouldn't be him…”</p><p>Before he finished, a sudden thunderclap echoed.</p><p>The entire Cui Ming Archipelago could hear it clearly; both mortals and cultivators felt a tremor in their hearts, a vague sense of unease and fear, more pronounced for those with higher cultivation.</p><p>The field was brightly lit, revealing every detail.</p><p>Lightning struck, pouring down.</p><p>The power of the tribulation lightning remained terrifying, threatening to engulf Liuli.  However, this lightning bolt was clearly less powerful than the one endured by Yin Changsheng. Qin Sang subtly sensed this, nodding slightly, confident that Liuli should easily overcome this tribulation. Besides, she had a spiritual treasure as a safety net.</p><p>The moment the tribulation lightning struck, Liuli cast sword formations.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped sword stopped rotating, standing upright, pointing towards the heavens.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>In an instant, sword energy erupted. The phoenix-shaped sword’s body was invisible to the naked eye; only a pale blue sword light could be seen, faster than lightning, leaving a blue trail in the sky.</p><p>The sword intent was restrained; the trail was thin as a hair, especially when compared to the tribulation lightning, appearing weak and fragile, giving the impression that it would be destroyed instantly.</p><p>A loud ‘boom’ echoed.</p><p>The trail was indeed engulfed by the tribulation lightning, but instead of being destroyed, it erupted with astonishing power; a mass of blue light exploded within the tribulation lightning.  If anyone could see through the tribulation lightning, they would discover that this blue light was actually composed of countless sword lights, effortlessly extinguishing the first tribulation lightning bolt.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liuli rose from the ground.</p><p>Her hair flew wildly, her clothes billowing.  Her eyes were slightly closed, she chanted silently, the phoenix-shaped sword reappeared in its true form, slashing towards the sky with one sword energy after another, its momentum piercing the heavens.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Liuli, undaunted, met the Heavenly Tribulation head-on with fierce determination, a breathtaking display of power.  The scene was truly awe-inspiring.</p><p>The tribulation clouds spun faster and faster, seemingly enraged by Liuli's defiance. The thunderbolts grew more terrifying, thick as pythons, relentlessly bombarding her.</p><p>In the final moment, countless lightning bolts intertwined, coalescing into a single, blinding mass.  In the air, all the thunder converged into a single, searing river of lightning, plunging towards the earth.</p><p>Without fear, Liuli reached for her phoenix-shaped sword, grasping it firmly. With a twist of her wrist, she unleashed a powerful strike towards the heavens.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth trembled.  The brilliant flash of her sword vanished. The thunderbolt shattered, dispersing into countless thick and thin strands of lightning that ravaged the landscape, leaving the beautiful scenery in ruins.</p><p>After a moment, the chaos subsided somewhat.  The tribulation clouds showed no sign of dissipating, brewing the next wave of lightning.  Liuli, now on the ground, had been struck and lay in a deep crater, her hair disheveled, her face pale, but thankfully unharmed.  Quickly regaining her composure, she braced herself for the next attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!…</p><p>Liuli’s magical treasures and abilities repelled wave after wave of thunderbolts.  Qin Sang and Shi Xue’s expressions grew increasingly relaxed.</p><p>Until the final, most terrifying thunderbolt descended. Liuli, who had endured so much, finally unleashed her most powerful technique – the Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>The thunderbolt, having broken through all defenses, was mere inches away.  A chilling blue light blazed in Liuli's eyes.  Without warning, the remaining lightning froze solid, encased in ice. The next instant, Liuli vanished.</p><p>BANG!</p><p>The thunderbolt shattered the ice, but it was too late to harm her.  The triumphant thunder finally met its end. The tribulation clouds ceased their rotation, losing their heavenly power, transforming into ordinary clouds that were quickly dispersed by the sea breeze.</p><p>"She did it!" Shi Xue exclaimed joyfully, about to fly towards Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly frowned, stopping Shi Xue. "Wait!"</p><p>Shi Xue paused, confused, following Qin Sang's gaze towards Liuli with puzzled curiosity.</p><p>The field was a desolate mess, scarred with blackened marks and deep craters. Liuli appeared in a clear space, ignoring the dissipated clouds above and showing no sign of triumph, instead sitting cross-legged, her expression serene.  Her actions were not those of someone recovering their breath.</p><p>Sensing the change in Liuli's aura, Shi Xue gasped in shock, “Could my junior sister be breaking through now?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered; he remained silent, intently watching Liuli. He hadn’t expected Liuli to be so reckless, attempting a breakthrough immediately after the tribulation. He considered shielding Liuli, blocking the view of others, including Shi Xue.</p><p>He anticipated Liuli would use the Tranquil Spirit Incense.  Only he and Liuli knew of its existence within the Exquisite Pagoda.  The incense was of great importance.  News of such a treasure must not leak out!</p><p>While Qin Sang planned to do just that, he unexpectedly saw Liuli take out only one thing – the shed skin of an Eight-Winged Heart Cicada.</p><p>She gently tossed the exuviae into the air. The blue light in her eyes intensified, her eyes becoming completely azure. The blue light spread, enveloping the exuviae.  The exuviae, now imbued with the same blue hue, seemed almost alive, indistinguishable from a living cicada.</p><p>Silently, the exuviae’s shadow faded, gradually dissolving.  As the exuviae dissolved, the blue light also changed, shifting from intense to pale, finally leaving only a faint trace.</p><p>Qin Sang was too far away and knew little of the Ice Soul Divine Light, unsure what benefit the exuviae would bring to it. But the benefit to Liuli was obvious.</p><p>After refining the exuviae, the blue light receded back into Liuli's eyes. The next moment, Liuli’s aura surged, once again assaulting the bottleneck to her cultivation!</p><p>The following was predictable.  Her expression shifted, her body trembled slightly, influenced again by the evil technique's mark, causing Shi Xue to grip her hands tightly, holding her breath. But Liuli remained unwavering!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang suddenly understood Liuli's intentions. She was using the impact of the Heavenly Tribulation on her spirit to counter the evil technique’s mark, while simultaneously using the transformation of the Ice Soul Divine Light to break through her cultivation bottleneck!</p><p>Liuli had two sticks of Tranquil Spirit Incense; one would have sufficed to break through to the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul realm. Yet she chose the riskier path. Her ambition… was vast.</p>
