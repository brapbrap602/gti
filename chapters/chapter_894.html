<h1>Chapter 886: Yin-Yang Armor</h1><p>“Then I wish Senior Brother Huayang success. Although I cultivate the *Wooden Puppet Scripture*, we are of the same lineage, and it pains me to see the Yin-Yang line, once a pillar of strength, decline so,”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu sighed.</p><p>“If only all had Brother’s broad-mindedness…”</p><p>The young disciple sighed softly.</p><p>As they spoke, the avatar completed the questioning, his name registered in the jade register.  He no longer needed to participate in the following matters.</p><p>“This jade token represents your identity…”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu tossed a jade token to the avatar, then took out a jade slip and beckoned to the young disciple. “Junior Brother Yang, take a look. This contains information on positions currently needing filling. You’ve been in the sect for many years; you must know which are easy.”</p><p>Before approaching, the young disciple swept the jade slip with his spiritual sense, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>The avatar secretly marveled.</p><p>Back then, his original body had joined three sects, yet never received such treatment.</p><p>For a four-spirit-root disciple to be so cared for by senior sect members was truly a great stroke of fortune.</p><p>After a moment.</p><p>The young disciple opened his eyes, slightly frowning.  “Senior Brother Lu, are the positions guarding the White Rainbow Tower all filled?”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu shook his head gently.  “Junior Brother, don't even dream of it. Those positions won't open up!  In this jade slip, the few tasks available – tending the spirit beasts, guarding Green Smoke Lake – are incredibly leisurely.  I wouldn't have easily brought them up if you hadn't asked.”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the young disciple suddenly turned to the avatar. “Do you have any particular skills?”</p><p>The avatar was startled, and after a moment of thought, replied, “Disciple has studied artifact refinement.”</p><p>The few tasks they mentioned seemed quite leisurely, rarely seen by outsiders.</p><p>This didn’t suit the avatar’s purpose. He needed to meet more people to gather information.</p><p>Magical tools and pills were necessities for every cultivator.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The young disciple’s gaze shifted to the spirit sword behind the avatar. “No wonder you, a solitary cultivator with no family tradition, possess a treasure sword comparable to a top-grade magical tool. Your artifact refinement skills must be quite good. Then go to Senior Brother Jinyan. I have some connections with Senior Brother Jinyan; he can provide some assistance.”</p><p>“Junior Brother has decided?”</p><p>Senior Brother Lu retracted the jade slip, glancing at the avatar. He lectured, “You, a mere four-spirit-root disciple, have caused Junior Brother Yang so much trouble.  Shouldn't you quickly express your gratitude?”</p><p>“Disciple thanks Uncle-Master Yang and Uncle-Master Lu.”</p><p>The avatar cleverly performed the courtesy.</p><p>The two Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged smiles. The young disciple slowly nodded, motioning for him to rise, and said softly, “I also see you have good talent in the Yin-Yang Dao; perhaps you can make a name for yourself. I will first teach you the Yin-Yang Armor refinement technique, then send you to see Senior Brother Jinyan.  Just focus on your cultivation; don't disgrace our Yin-Yang lineage.”</p><p>“Disciple obeys.”</p><p>The avatar rose and followed closely behind the young disciple into a side room.</p><p>The young disciple first tossed him a jade slip. “This is the Yin-Yang Armor refinement technique. Study it yourself; ask if you have any questions.  I won't have time to personally guide you in the future!”</p><p>The avatar was surprised and quickly took the jade slip.</p><p>Seeing the young disciple begin to meditate, he remained silent, pressing the jade slip to his forehead and examining it. He found it to be a spell called *Yin-Yang Armor*.</p><p>The spell wasn't long, and the avatar quickly finished reading it.</p><p>“No wonder it was so easily given; it's only part of a secret technique…”</p><p>The avatar muttered internally, but quickly dismissed his doubts and examined it carefully.</p><p>He found that the spell seemed superficial on the surface, easily learned by Qi Condensation disciples, yet the true meaning within required careful consideration, even with his level of understanding.</p><p>The spell's content was simple: to refine Yin and Yang energy into a suit of armor.</p><p>The armor wasn't like a magical tool; with a thought, it could be instantly donned, providing a degree of defense, very useful in combat.</p><p>The jade slip covered the introductory stage to armor formation, then abruptly stopped, likely to be continued after the Yin-Yang Armor was successfully refined.</p><p>“This secret technique has a remarkable origin!”</p><p>The avatar was secretly amazed.</p><p>“The Lan Dou Sect's true inheritance truly has something to it! This spell for refining the Yin-Yang Armor likely originates from the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*.  Its use of Yin and Yang energy is exquisite. I wonder what the main technique itself is like?”</p><p>In less than an incense stick's time, the avatar had memorized the spell and felt he could begin practicing.</p><p>His talent was fake, but based on years of experience, he could find another way to refine a Yin-Yang Armor.  However, his original body couldn't cultivate this technique.</p><p>These orthodox Xuanmen techniques all had extremely high requirements for aptitude. The avatar knew his original body did not possess such talent.</p><p>Unable to cultivate it, he could still study it to gain insight.</p><p>Furthermore, the effects of the Yin-Yang Armor piqued the avatar's curiosity, wanting to refine it and try it out as soon as possible.  This armor didn't seem to be purely defensive; it likely had other uses.</p><p>Despite this thought, the avatar endured, a full hour passing before finally exhaling and removing the jade slip from his forehead.</p><p>The Daoist boy opened his eyes and asked the avatar, "Do you have any questions?"</p><p>The avatar shook his head and then nodded.  "Disciple's mind is a tangled mess. I seem to grasp something, yet everything remains unclear."</p><p>"That's normal. You're just beginning to learn Yin-Yang techniques; you can't comprehend everything so quickly. However, given your talent in this path, you should be able to refine the Yin-Yang Armor prototype soon. I'll explain this technique to you. This is a one-time opportunity. Don't worry about understanding everything now; just write it all down, and you can ponder it later…"</p><p>The Daoist boy's expression darkened slightly, offering a warning before softening his tone.</p><p>The avatar listened attentively, not underestimating this cultivator whose cultivation was far inferior to his own.</p><p>This person practiced the authentic "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique," and his insights must surpass the avatar's.</p><p>Perhaps to prevent the avatar from bothering him again, the Daoist boy's explanation went beyond the contents of the jade slip, expanding on several points.</p><p>The avatar indeed heard some unexpected and remarkably insightful information.</p><p>But towards the end, the avatar became suspicious.</p><p>Although the final portion of the Daoist boy's lecture consisted of only a few sentences, the avatar noticed a significant difference from the preceding sections.</p><p>The latter part was quite profound, captivating even someone without cultivation experience.  However, compared to the earlier parts, it fell short.</p><p>"Is this boy's cultivation inadequate, or…"</p><p>A sudden realization struck the avatar. "Could this technique also be a patched-up, incomplete scripture?"</p><p>Complete cultivation techniques aren't rare in the immortal cultivation world.  Mount Shao Hua alone houses numerous techniques reaching the Yuan Ying stage, but their power and essence are rather ordinary.</p><p>Remarkable techniques like the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter," the "Celestial Demon Refining Form," and the Wu Clan's divine紋道 are all incomplete.</p><p>This "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique" seems similar.</p>
