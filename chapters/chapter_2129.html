<h1>Chapter 2119: Summoning of the Twelve Thunder Lords</h1><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying led their men into the Thunder Marsh, their every move within Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>Next, just as Lu Wang and the others had guessed, Qin Sang would continue to entangle with them, creating the illusion that he was trying every means to stall for time.</p><p>His gaze passed over Shi Mu and the others, towards the landmass on the sea.  Anyone could see that this landmass was extraordinary, radiating an obscure fluctuation that made Qin Sang wary.</p><p>Unfortunately, Si Lu didn't know much about the Lu family and the Imperial Clan, and was unaware of the origin of this landmass.</p><p>A peculiar magical artifact, a manifestation of divine abilities, spiritual treasures, formations, or perhaps a never-before-seen exotic treasure, were all possibilities.</p><p>What was certain was that the landmass, having descended here, had already linked with the earth's energy through the eight mountain peaks. The occasional flicker of profound yellow light gave it an extremely weighty feeling. But it also added a layer of shackles; if they wanted to move it in the future, they would have to sever this connection first.</p><p>Without understanding the opponent's details, activating the Thunder Altar and unleashing the Thunder Oath Decree now was not a wise move.</p><p>Even if the power of that mysterious landmass was weak, as long as it could withstand the Thunder Oath Decree for a moment, the Grand Offering and the others would have a sliver of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang, having gained insights from the Empty Spiritual Pagoda, was now able to integrate the Sword Heart Surge technique into the activation of the Thunder Altar. However, whether it was this technique or the Empty Spiritual Pagoda, the premise for their effectiveness was being able to strike the opponent.</p><p>Lu Wang and the others hiding within the landmass was equivalent to adding another layer of unknown barrier.  Qin Sang either had to investigate the nature of this landmass or lure them out.</p><p>Showing weakness to the enemy, gradually lowering their guard—this strategy had never failed.</p><p>Withdrawing his gaze, Qin Sang looked behind him. Cultivators and demon soldiers, led by the two Demon Marquises and other demons, were standing in formation, ready for battle.</p><p>Currently, most of the powerful figures in the Storm Realm were stationed at the branch altars, and the remaining experts were limited. Qin Sang had to plan meticulously.</p><p>“Marquis Gui! Marquis Luo!”</p><p>“Your subordinate is here!”</p><p>The two Demon Marquises stepped forward.  Upon receiving their orders, they immediately selected over a hundred men and rode the thunder away.</p><p>At the same time as their departure, at the main altar of the Green Ram Temple, Qin Sang's Dharma Body silently activated the Thunder Altar.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Green Ram Temple was enveloped by an illusory altar.  The altar hung in the air, immense and grand. The Thunder Altar at Moon Ablution Bay, when it displayed its power, could not compare to the current one.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body sat cross-legged atop the Thunder Altar, activating a Thunder Talisman inscribed within it.</p><p>A Tier Three Thunder Talisman: the Summoning of the Twelve Thunder Lords!</p><p>Daoism believed that thunder also had different types.  There were multiple classifications for thunder, one reason being that when Daoism used thunder techniques as the foundation to establish the Divine Court, it absorbed inheritances from various sects and schools.</p><p>Different sects, different inheritances, different understandings of the heavens and the Dao, all had their own reasoning.</p><p>These inheritances did not disappear. As Daoism gradually grew stronger, they each developed and gradually integrated into the Daoist thunder technique system.</p><p>One such classification divided thunder into Thirty-Six Thunders, the Thirty-Six Thunder Lords of Heaven.</p><p>Human sins were divided into Human Sins, Earth Sins, and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Punishments. The Thunder Lords oversaw the world, punishing evil and striking down sin.  Mortals who committed transgressions would attract thunderous retribution. The Great Dao had the virtue of nurturing life.  As long as one sincerely burned incense and prayed to the Big Dipper, praying with their heart, they could avoid this suffering.</p><p>This belief, tracing back to its roots, likely originated from humanity's primitive times, the most primal worship of nature and the heavens. Passed down to this day, although Daoists had a deeper understanding of the Great Dao, this inheritance was still preserved. The Thirty-Six Thunder Lords also held positions in the Divine Court, with corresponding summoning techniques.</p><p>With the Divine Court in seclusion, Qin Sang couldn't summon deities for assistance.  But Daoist talismans were numerous and diverse, such as the Summoning of the Twelve Thunder Lords.  It wasn't a deity-summoning method, and in situations where the Divine Court couldn't be sensed, it could achieve a similar effect.</p><p>The Twelve Thunder Lords here referred to the Twelve Human Thunder Lords. Above them were the more powerful Earth Thunders and Heaven Thunders, as well as the Grand Summoning of the Thirty-Six Thunder Lords. Unfortunately, Qin Sang hadn't obtained these inheritances, and he suspected that those talismans were ranked higher than Tier Three.</p><p>Rather than a summoning, it was more like a talisman formation. The caster would deploy the talisman and link its power to a certain number of people, usually a multiple of twelve. Through the Summoning of the Twelve Thunder Lords, these people were linked together, and under the empowerment of the talisman's power, they transformed into the Twelve Thunder Lords, going into battle to slay enemies.</p><p>After transforming into Thunder Lords, their strength was no longer significantly related to their own cultivation, but rather to the caster, the quality and power of the talisman.</p><p>Now, cast by Qin Sang and empowered by the Thunder Altar, it was absolutely the ultimate Summoning of the Twelve Thunder Lords!</p><p>Qin Sang chanted incantations, and a thunder light emerged from the center of the altar.  The thunder light divided, transforming into twelve points of light, rotating above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>At the same time, his will was transmitted through the altar formation to the branch altars. Si Lu and the others didn't dare to be negligent, immediately cooperating with the spellcasting.</p><p>The busiest were the altar masters below.  Chanting incantations and pacing in specific patterns, whether demon, witch, righteous, or demonic, unorthodox or otherwise, they all had the air of Daoist masters at this moment.</p><p>The Thunder Altar activated, the twelve points of light stirring restlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, pointing westward, the twelve points of light shooting towards the sky.</p><p>At the same time, far away in the Western Lands, thunder suddenly gathered above the heads of Marquis Gui, Marquis Luo, and the hundred and twenty cultivators, abruptly descending.</p><p>The cultivators, having been warned beforehand, weren't panicked, standing still in their places.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Blinding thunder light engulfed the cultivators, followed by a vast and mighty power.</p><p>This power wasn't ostentatious, not stirring up monstrous waves. After descending, it was like a deep abyss.</p><p>The next moment, the thunder light receded, and the figures of the cultivators reappeared, their auras and appearances completely transformed.</p><p>Led by Marquis Gui and Marquis Luo, the cultivators' faces turned blue, red, black, or gold.  Some wore yellow scarves and blue robes, some black robes and golden armor. Some held swords, some held shackles, some held fire pearls and water wheels. There were twelve variations in total, precisely the images of the legendary Twelve Human Thunder Lords.</p><p>Transformed into Thunder Lords, they experienced an unparalleled power, far surpassing their own cultivation.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike summoning deities, they couldn't control this power, nor did they receive any divine insights. They were merely vessels of this power, and at this moment, they had to abandon their sense of self, maintain their true hearts, and be controlled by the power.</p><p>Marquis Gui roared, and the Thunder Lords responded, their voices like collapsing mountains, continuing onward, the surrounding thunder retreating, as if encountering its master.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying, upon entering the Thunder Marsh, felt their vision filled with blinding thunder light, omnipresent. Even with their cultivation level, their spiritual senses were restricted, and they couldn't help but be cautious.</p><p>Shi Mu stopped, transmitting his voice. The Nine Trigram Division behind him stopped in unison, without making a sound, quietly awaiting orders.</p><p>After sensing for a moment, Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged a look and ordered their forces to advance deeper.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Lightning danced freely around them, occasionally with thunder serpents charging head-on, the thunder deafening.</p><p>It appeared imposing but didn't possess world-destroying power.  They could easily withstand the thunder's strikes.</p><p>Of course, Shi Mu and the others didn't dare to be careless.  Their spiritual senses were increasingly suppressed, indicating that these thunderbolts weren't simple.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh seemed endless.  After traveling an unknown distance, Shi Mu ordered another halt. Along the way, they hadn't encountered anyone, nor had they encountered fierce attacks. The clamorous Thunder Marsh gave off a deathly silent feeling.</p><p>Sensing within themselves, that thread of connection remained, not severed by the Thunder Marsh. Shi Mu was relieved and communicated secretly with Shi Ying.</p><p>Having arrived here, the two suddenly felt something unusual, but nothing seemed amiss on the surface. They had secret techniques for investigation, but they didn't want to reveal them so soon.  They decided to let the Nine Trigram Division spread out and investigate separately.</p><p>The Nine Trigram Division meticulously carried out their orders, dividing into several groups, advancing further into the Thunder Marsh in a fan shape.</p><p>Then, Shi Mu waved his hand across his waist, and with a *bang*, a cloud of white mist erupted from his palm, engulfing the two figures.</p><p>The white mist dissipated extremely quickly. After the mist vanished, Shi Mu and Shi Ying had also disappeared.</p><p>The surrounding thunder and lightning, having lost their targets, danced about like headless flies.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body, observing from the outside, narrowed his eyes slightly. The moment the two disappeared from the Thunder Marsh was likely a rather sophisticated concealment technique.</p><p>This Thunder Marsh was deliberately created by Qin Sang. Its greatest use was to suppress the opponent's spiritual senses, making them apprehensive, and to conceal his own side's movements. In other aspects, it was unremarkable.</p><p>However, before Qin Sang, Shi Mu and Shi Ying were still unable to hide.</p><p>Although their concealment technique was sophisticated, it couldn't deceive the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision!</p><p>After concealing themselves, Shi Mu and Shi Ying remained in place to observe. Seeing nothing unusual, they chose a direction and quietly followed.</p><p>At this time, the Thunder Lords had arrived!</p><p>One of the Nine Trigram Division's small teams was led by a deputy general.  This deputy general's face was completely covered by a mask, revealing only bright eyes, sharp as knives.</p><p>He led his small team through the thunder and lightning, the surrounding 'silence' unsettling.</p><p>Just then, a bolt of lightning slashed down diagonally, seemingly no different from other lightning bolts.  A cultivator on the side was about to block it as before when the deputy general's expression suddenly changed. He shouted, "Evade!"</p><p>The cultivators reacted extremely quickly, a small gap instantly appearing in their formation, but the lightning's trajectory was extremely strange.</p><p>At some point, a triangular blue flag appeared in the deputy general's hand. With a powerful shake, blue light diffused, but it was too late.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Over ten people, unable to dodge, were struck by the lightning, instantly vanishing without a trace. Among them were several at the peak of the Fourth Stage of the Yuan Realm.</p><p>The power of the lightning made the cultivators gasp.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a thunderous shout came from the source of the lightning, "Destroy the evil!"</p><p>The voice was filled with authority, shocking the cultivators.  Focusing their gaze, they saw a blue-robed Thunder Lord emerge amidst the thunder, wielding a thunder sword, glaring at them.</p><p>The Thunder Lord pointed his sword at the cultivators, the tip suddenly brightening intensely, a bolt of lightning tearing through the air.</p><p>Then, shouts came from all directions.</p><p>“Execute the villains!”</p><p>“Crimes cannot be forgiven!”</p><p>In an instant, several Thunder Lords appeared one after another, their figures flashing and disappearing.  Their appearances were different, their weapons were different, even the thunderous punishments they unleashed, the colors of the lightning were different, but the power of the thunderous punishments was equally terrifying!</p><p>It wasn't just this small team that was attacked.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Nine Trigram Division, including Shi Mu and Shi Ying, were surrounded by Thunder Lords filling the sky, as if they had all become criminals awaiting judgment.</p><p>Divine punishment descended from the heavens, world-destroying!</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying's hearts tightened.  They had divided their forces to break the stalemate and lure out the enemy, and now they had succeeded, but the incoming attack was somewhat beyond their expectations.</p><p>Fortunately, they had been prepared. Shi Mu flipped his palm, and another triangular blue flag appeared in his hand. This was the main flag, much more refined than the one in the deputy general's hand, its runes several times more complex.</p><p>The Nine Trigram Division had meticulously practiced several battle formations.  The most powerful one required this treasure flag.  The higher the quality of the flag, the higher the cultivation level of the person manipulating the main flag, the stronger the power of the battle formation.</p><p>Before entering the Thunder Marsh, Shi Mu had already taken the main flag in hand.  Now, without hesitation, he immediately activated it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The treasure flag flew into the sky on its own, a blue gale swirling around it, transforming into a blue azure dragon.  At the same time, above each small team, azure dragons soared into the sky.</p><p>This place became a nest of dragons, dragons dancing together, rising against the tide, fiercely charging towards the thunderous punishments.</p><p>However, for some reason, even though they had reacted quickly, both Shi Mu and Shi Ying felt a sense of unease.</p><p>"Return!"</p><p>Shi Mu trusted his intuition and immediately ordered the Nine Trigram Division to retreat.</p><p>Just then, Shi Ying's pupils constricted sharply.  A figure appeared out of thin air before them—it was that True Person Qin!</p><p>They had all heard of Lu Gan's encounter with him. Lu Gan, carrying the Heaven Trapping Golden Shackles, was still no match for him and fled in defeat.</p><p>“He actually made a move in the first wave.  They truly lack experts…”</p><p>This thought flashed through Shi Ying's mind. He immediately shielded Shi Mu, the aura between his eyebrows fluctuating, two companion beasts leaping out.</p><p>One was a Feathered Fiery Bird, the same as Si Lu's. The other resembled a white tiger, but with a horn on its forehead and three tails.</p><p>With furious roars, the Feathered Fiery Bird and the three-tailed tiger lunged towards Qin Sang, one with flames, the other with sharp tiger claws.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his Dharma Appearance manifested and secretly circulating the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, waved the spiritual tablet in his hand.  With two *bangs*, the two companion beasts were sent flying backward.</p><p>Then, with a flash of blue light, Qin Sang, at an unimaginable speed, passed through the two companion beasts, instantly closing in on Shi Ying.</p><p>Only now did Shi Ying understand that Lu Gan hadn't exaggerated. He still had a companion beast protecting him, but his heart was pounding wildly.</p><p>He and Shi Mu were spiritually connected. Shi Mu, sensing his companion's unease, dared not be negligent and hurriedly diverted his attention, summoning his companion beast for assistance.</p><p>At this moment, both of their attention was focused on Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the slight smile on Qin Sang's lips, Shi Mu froze, realizing something was wrong.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Thunder Lords in the sky appeared simultaneously, standing atop the thunder.</p><p>Like celestial beings descending, their divine might unparalleled.</p><p>“Die, demons!”</p><p>Divine punishment descended, ten thousand thunderbolts unleashed. The azure dragons were instantly annihilated under the divine thunder, only the azure dragon formed by the main flag barely holding on.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The first treasure flag snapped, the entire team engulfed by heavenly thunder.</p><p>Then the second, the third…</p><p>Both Shi Mu and Shi Ying were greatly shocked.  They hadn't expected the might of the Thunder Lords to be so terrifying. They themselves could still fight, but the Nine Trigram Division was likely to be annihilated here.</p><p>The Si You Clan's Mutual Transformation technique had greater limitations the lower the cultivation level. It was unlikely that many would escape.</p><p>This was only the first wave, and the Nine Trigram Division was being annihilated just after the initial clash.  How could they explain this to Lu Wang upon their return?</p><p>Shi Mu hurriedly activated the faint fluctuation within his body.</p>
