<h1>Chapter 477: Experimentation</h1><p>Chapter 477: Experimentation</p><p>Even his confidante only revealed herself after betraying her sect and completing her revenge.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the crystal, sensing its connection to the stone pillar and platform.</p><p>No mistake, the crystal is the 'key'!</p><p>Without it, this door cannot be opened, and Mount Zhantian cannot be entered!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  She darted from the platform, hurrying to the temple entrance, then abruptly stopped, her expression grave, unable to take another step.</p><p>Outside the temple, a spatial fissure stretched across the upper area.</p><p>There was only one fissure, but the surrounding void was chaotic, a murky aura with faintly unstable fluctuations.</p><p>Her cultivation was limited to the Qi Condensation stage, and she dared not trespass.</p><p>Remembering Granny Jing's warning, Qin Sang slowly retreated, her mood gradually calming.  After some thought, she chuckled to herself.</p><p>She really didn't need to overthink it.</p><p>Regardless of Granny Jing and Elder Qingzhu's relationship, it had nothing to do with her.</p><p>She only needed to know that the closer Granny Jing and Elder Qingzhu were, the more credible her information, which was good for her.</p><p>Since Granny Jing didn't want to mention it, it was best not to pry.  If she touched on Granny Jing's taboo, she might backfire and offend her.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang stopped worrying.  She glanced at the crystal, mentally calculating the time, then turned her gaze to the handsome young man.</p><p>Qin Sang removed the young man's pouch and emptied its contents.</p><p>For a moment, the temple shimmered with jewels, nearly blinding Qin Sang.</p><p>The spirit stones alone numbered over ten thousand. Qin Sang didn't count them, putting them all away, and casually tossing aside the less valuable items.</p><p>What remained were spirit pills, magical artifacts, talismans, and two very powerful sets of forbidden artifacts.</p><p>The young man had already used one talisman; his pouch still held two more. These talismans were unique, likely inherited from the Yuanshen Sect. Qin Sang dared not keep them and planned to destroy them after entering Mount Zhantian.</p><p>The same went for the artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to follow Granny Jing's advice and leave nothing behind, regardless of value.  The best pieces were destroyed in the battle; the remaining ones were not top-tier.</p><p>With the Ebony Sword and the Ten Directions Netherworld Banner, better artifacts were unnecessary.</p><p>She didn't dare keep the forbidden artifacts either; they were undoubtedly meticulously crafted by high-ranking Yuanshen Sect cultivators.</p><p>An ordinary Yuanshen Sect disciple might have kept them, but given the young man's identity and involvement with two Yuanshen Sect elders, the matter was serious, and utmost caution was necessary.</p><p>All the items together were worth less than a Xuantian Thunderclap, so Qin Sang didn't feel too bad about leaving them behind.</p><p>Qin Sang put them aside with the ‘junk,’ then turned her attention to the jade bottles, carefully examining them.</p><p>To her disappointment, these bottles contained no spirit pills that aided in Golden Core formation.</p><p>It made sense; the young man himself was at the False Core stage. If he had such pills, he would have used them himself; why would he leave them for others?</p><p>Fortunately, several bottles contained spirit pills for strengthening the foundation and nourishing the body.  One bottle's efficacy was comparable to the Li Long Pill; it was probably leftover from the young man's consumption.</p><p>Even after all this, there's this much left—what a connection he must have!</p><p>These pills could help her reach the False Core stage faster.  Qin Sang happily transferred them to new jade bottles.</p><p>The rest of the pills were mostly for healing and recovery, which Qin Sang readily consumed.</p><p>Beyond that, the most valuable item was a jade slip titled "Fragments of the Tai Xuan Formation," containing several spirit formations.  Qin Sang found them quite ingenious at a glance.</p><p>The content was highly advanced and couldn't be grasped overnight. Qin Sang could only memorize them superficially.</p><p>Having sorted everything, Qin Sang leisurely surveyed the young man. He was the second False Core expert she had captured alive, after Yu Hua.</p><p>In her eyes, this young man’s value was no less than a Xuantian Thunderclap.</p><p>Creating living corpses was difficult, with a low success rate. Qin Sang couldn't guarantee success on the first try with Yu Hua.</p><p>Although she couldn't take the young man out, he was perfect for practice.</p><p>The young man remained unconscious.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a Heavenly Corpse Talisman, and after some effort, implanted it into the young man's spiritual space to suppress his soul, then paused.</p><p>Here, her cultivation was limited to the Qi Condensation stage; her hands were tied, and there would be significant limitations to creating a living corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the platform, quietly waiting.</p><p>Finally, a quarter of an hour passed.</p><p>Qin Sang, following Jing Po Po's instructions, activated the crystal.</p><p>The stone door on the platform slowly opened, revealing a familiar scene of chaos.  Without hesitation, Qin Sang grabbed the handsome young man and leaped through the doorway.</p><p>Another dizzying swirl, and soon he felt solid ground beneath his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and quickly opened his eyes. The square was unrecognizable. The fragments of stone pillars had turned to dust, and the large stone blocks were mostly shattered into several pieces, riddled with cracks.</p><p>Fortunately, the stones weren't completely pulverized, and the square's original shape was still vaguely discernible.</p><p>The void had stabilized. The all-consuming darkness had vanished without a trace, and everything in the space was back to normal.</p><p>"What a powerful array!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled silently.  It could even suppress spatial fragmentation; its power in its intact state must have been immense.</p><p>Time was of the essence. After a quick assessment to confirm everything was safe, Qin Sang immediately began the corpse refinement process.</p><p>He had prepared ample five-element Yin materials, and the Nether煞 energy in the Shao Yin magnetic bottle was still plentiful.</p><p>Laying the handsome young man on the ground, Qin Sang lightly touched him, completing a series of restrictions. Then, he picked up a piece of blue Nethergold…</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the young man intently, meticulously completing each step and observing his changes.  This wasn't his first time refining a living corpse; his technique was very skillful. However, he quickly discovered a significant difference between refining someone at the False Pill stage and someone at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>…</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A dull sound echoed from the young man's dantian, followed by a deafening explosion.</p><p>A torrent of Nether煞 energy erupted, and the young man's flesh and blood were torn apart in an instant.  He didn't even make a sound before his life was extinguished, leaving behind no remains.</p><p>The Nether煞 energy continued to surge outward.</p><p>Qin Sang nimbly dodged the blast, his face grim.</p><p>As expected, the refinement had failed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't anticipated such a swift failure.  He had only managed to fuse one strand of Nether煞 energy into the young man before a violent conflict arose during the attempt to fuse a second.</p><p>He tried to rectify the situation, but to no avail, resulting in the explosion.</p><p>Reflecting on the process, Qin Sang concluded that his insufficient cultivation was the main cause. If he were at the False Pill stage, his control would be vastly different, and he would have been able to suppress the conflict.</p>
