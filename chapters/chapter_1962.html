<h1>Chapter 1953: The Game of Go</h1><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind takes on a shape—the shape of flame.</p><p>Blazing infernos surge and recede across a sea of lava.</p><p>Above and below, only crimson meets the eye.</p><p>Occasionally, in the lava, one catches glimpses of 'water sprays'—strange figures flashing past.</p><p>This is a pure ocean of magma.  Not a single patch of land is visible. Only fire beasts of unique lineage and fire spirits born of the flames can survive here.</p><p>They fearlessly navigate this environment, darting through the lava like fish.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery winds pause for a moment, revealing two ethereal figures.</p><p>These two are Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>A fire jade centipede coils around Gui Hou's arm, as if communicating with him. He then points downwards.</p><p>"Ling Dao you, this is the place!  Lord Zhuque mentioned it before—some Dark Magic Lilies grow beneath this lava.  I wonder if their medicinal properties meet your requirements."</p><p>"Dark Magic Lilies thrive where the power of flame is most intense and volatile, absorbing fire poison as nourishment. The environment greatly affects their quality. If I were using them myself, superior-grade Dark Magic Lilies would suffice. But this time, I need to refine a potent poison as requested by a senior, requiring the highest quality."</p><p>Ling Shi gently twitches his nostrils, sensing his surroundings with a secret technique. He nods. "This place is good. There's a chance of finding top-grade Dark Magic Lilies here. Let's go down and take a look!"</p><p>They plunge downwards, the lava parting to let them pass, then closing seamlessly.</p><p>The lava is bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou leads the way, descending steadily, transmitting his voice, "Ling Dao you, how many top-grade blooms do you think are at most in this entire field? How many are needed to refine the poison?"</p><p>"The more, the better!" Ling Shi says.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>Gui Hou furrows his brow, "In the entire Fire Domain, such places are likely few and far between. Once a certain scale is reached, they're usually claimed. The three major sects of the Fire Domain all master fire-elemental techniques, along with countless smaller factions. Even if they don't cultivate Dark Magic Lilies, they could turn such places into medicinal fields."</p><p>"Let's do our best; this isn't our only option!  Besides, our senior has vast supernatural powers and is sure to have a way.  If he wants to unify the Fire Domain, it would be effortless for him, wouldn't it?" Ling Shi says casually.</p><p>Since being brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi, initially apprehensive, now feels at ease.</p><p>Here, he only needs to focus on comprehending the Dao of poison, researching various potent poisons. Qin Sang will fully support him, no matter the demands.</p><p>This kind of treatment is usually reserved for master alchemists.</p><p>Although there’s a saying that alchemy and poison-making are inseparable, and Ling Shi does understand some alchemy, his poison cultivation isn't solely about concocting poisons, and he lacks a formal alchemy lineage. He's simply not comparable to a true master alchemist.</p><p>The price is restricted freedom, but he's already targeted by the Falling Soul Abyss, so he has no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou cannot be as carefree as Ling Shi. He shakes his head, "That may be so, but as subordinates, we must do our utmost to relieve our master's worries."</p><p>As they speak, the two descend to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature not only fails to decrease, but the intense, volatile aura of the earth's energy grows stronger.</p><p>Gradually, the lava becomes indistinguishable, turning into a pure torrent of fire flowing from all directions.</p><p>It's unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene the unleashed power would create.</p><p>"Fire Domain cultivators call such places 'Yan Pools.' The power of flame undergoes a transformation here. Even in a powerful Yan Pool, we must remain cautious. Dark Magic Lilies are intertwined with the Yan Pool's energy; when harvesting them, we must be careful to avoid triggering a Yan Pool eruption."</p><p>Gui Hou cautions.</p><p>As they speak, they descend further, deliberately slowing their pace.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changes dramatically, and even these two Nascent Soul-stage experts feel an instinctive pressure.</p><p>Without warning, the surroundings suddenly calm down.</p><p>Here, there are no turbulent currents.</p><p>The stillness is unsettling, as if immense power is pent up, poised to erupt and destroy everything.</p><p>There is fire here too, burning quietly. The flames are a faint blue, gently swaying, giving a delicate impression.</p><p>They cautiously enter this space, avoiding the flames, and soon find a patch of shadow among the blue flames.</p><p>The shadows are not entirely dark; they radiate a dark blue light.</p><p>Amidst the radiant glow, a few flowers were scattered, resembling lilies, their petals a dark blue, some deep, some lighter.</p><p>There was no soil; they floated, their roots clearly visible, countless blue tendrils reaching into the flames, drawing sustenance from the fire.</p><p>"One, two... there are five exquisite Dark Magic Lilies!"</p><p>Ling Shi's face lit up; he had expected at most two or three.</p><p>He moved to a Dark Magic Lily, extending his right hand towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers moved slightly, strange waves emanating from his fingertips, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi focused intently, his movements gentle yet decisive. He gently lifted the root ball, patiently extracting each root from the flames one by one.</p><p>Harvesting a single Dark Magic Lily took about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou watched him remove a complete plant and lent a hand.</p><p>As they diligently harvested the spiritual flowers, they sensed something, stopping their work and exchanging a glance.</p><p>"Someone's coming!" Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma region teemed with countless fire beasts and fire spirits, inherently chaotic.  Their herb gathering in the Yan Pool didn't allow them to perceive every external fluctuation.  A simple passerby wouldn't have disturbed them.</p><p>But this arrival was unusual, like someone fleeing a pursuit, rushing in headlong.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi, possessing considerable composure, refrained from acting rashly, judging the intruder's direction from the source of the disturbance.</p><p>"Not heading for us," Gui Hou's expression relaxed slightly.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, they sensed another presence, fast approaching.</p><p>Ling Shi uttered a confirming sound, then exclaimed in surprise, "Two Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were rare in the Fire Domain; encountering two at once, engaged in a chase, was astonishing.</p><p>"Probably from the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, but it's none of our concern. Let's focus," Gui Hou shook his head, but noticed Ling Shi's changed expression.</p><p>"The one behind... is a Corpse Demon from the Fallen Soul Abyss!"</p><p>Ling Shi's eyes flashed with cold light. He sneered, "Those inhuman things... I can smell their corpse stench through the magma!"</p><p>...</p><p>Upper Level.</p><p>A crimson streak of light sped through the magma.</p><p>Within the遁光 was a burly man. Qin Sang would have recognized him: Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect, the man Qin Sang's avatar had drawn to the scene when he eliminated the sand bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's massive frame was stooped, his face pale as paper; he was severely wounded.</p><p>A gaping wound marred his chest, his robes torn through.</p><p>The wound nearly pierced his back, causing inevitable severe internal injuries.</p><p>Worse than the injury itself was a layer of green flame clinging to the wound.</p><p>This green fire, like a malignant growth, adhered to the flesh, preventing healing, consuming the host's vitality, rendering even numerous healing pills useless.</p><p>'Huff! Huff! Huff!'</p><p>As he fled, Fu Xiao manipulated hand seals, spitting out a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>The spiritual fire met the green flame, but failed to extinguish it.</p><p>He unleashed several more blasts, only managing to temporarily suppress it.</p><p>Worse still, he discovered the green fire silently invading his innards.</p><p>Normally, he had multiple ways to extinguish the green flame, but now, gravely wounded and pursued, his situation was desperate, rendering all his usual methods useless.</p><p>He mentally calculated his distance from his sect, growing more anxious. At this rate, he wouldn't reach them before succumbing.</p><p>He had stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's lair, unaware of a hidden ambusher; a single misstep led to a surprise attack, his communication artifact destroyed, leaving him utterly helpless.</p><p>Behind, the chilling aura relentlessly pursued, rapidly closing the distance.</p><p>Chasing him was a green flame, highly visible in the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao, adept at his Sect's cultivation method, moved like a fish in the magma, incredibly fast.  Yet, the green flame matched his speed!</p><p>The green flame concealed a similarly large figure, even more imposing than Fu Xiao—one of the individuals Qin Sang had alerted with the bronze pillar.</p><p>The others were gone; only this man pursued Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>"Hmph! If Flying Luo hadn't gone back to report, and Rou Ji hadn't been wounded, you wouldn't have escaped!  You're mine!"</p><p>The tall man bellowed, his robe billowing as green flames erupted from his body, transforming him into a human torch.</p><p>Green fire spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green.  The green magma instantly shifted from scorching heat to icy cold.</p><p>The green fire spread incredibly fast.  Fu Xiao had barely registered something was wrong before he was surrounded by the green magma, an instinctive warning flaring up within him.</p><p>Without warning, a bone-white ghostly claw emerged from the green fire. Its five fingers, sharp as blades, lunged for his back.</p><p>If this strike landed, Fu Xiao would surely be in grave danger.</p><p>Fortunately, he was prepared. A fiery red pattern, resembling a Bagua symbol but with subtle differences, appeared on his back, formed from flames.</p><p>The moment the Bagua fire diagram appeared, a muffled thunderclap echoed.</p><p>The ghostly claw struck the diagram, causing it to violently shake and crack, but it successfully held the claw back for a moment.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to dash forward. He should have been able to distance himself from his pursuer, but then he felt a chilling wind.</p><p>The ghostly claw, appearing and disappearing at will, materialized before him, aiming for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was terrified, but amidst his panic, a fierce determination emerged. He opened his mouth, spewing not flames, but a pearl.</p><p>The pearl's luster was extraordinarily brilliant. It was called the Chi Xi Pearl, a treasure Fu Xiao valued highly. Now, to escape, he had no choice but to destroy it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl shot toward the ghostly claw. The claw immediately sensed the anomaly, its five fingers retracting as it attempted to flee into the green magma.</p><p>But the claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao, having planned meticulously, had judged the timing perfectly.</p><p>With a 'boom', the Chi Xi Pearl exploded. A fiery serpent, enveloped in fragments, emerged, its fangs bared, claws outstretched.</p><p>A roar echoed from the magma. The ghostly claw, unable to escape in time, simply stopped retracting, its five fingers suddenly spreading wide.  Embedded in its palm was a black eye, rotating left and right like a living thing, unnervingly strange.</p><p>The eye blinked, shooting a black ray from its pupil towards the fiery serpent formed from the Chi Xi Pearl.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a figure appeared vaguely behind the ghostly claw, recoiling backward.</p><p>The Chi Xi Pearl's power was immense, instantly destroying the black ray.</p><p>The tall man looked rather disheveled, but he hadn't suffered serious injuries, having dodged most of the attack.</p><p>However, the green fire infecting the magma was now faltering.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the chance to escape, flicking his sleeve, sending several beams of light towards the enemy.  Without looking back at the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered the ruins of the Liuhe Gate, dating back thousands of years.</p><p>The brief battle had sharply aggravated Fu Xiao's injuries. He knew that relying solely on his own strength, escaping was nearly impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruins still existed; it was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped gathering herbs and quietly left the Yan Pool.</p><p>They hadn't approached the battlefield too closely, but based on the fluctuations emanating from it, they could deduce the situation with reasonable certainty.</p><p>"It's the Dian Cang Art of Liuhe Gate!" Gui Hou rarely went out, but he was familiar with the surrounding forces, especially the three sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A corpse demon from the Fallen Soul Abyss is pursuing a Liuhe Gate expert here.  Doesn't this seem strange, friend?"</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to act. "The Fallen Soul Abyss is extending its influence into the Fire Domain again. There must be a grand conspiracy! We should investigate thoroughly and be prepared, to avoid disturbing the cultivation grounds and disrupting our seniors' cultivation!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi. He knew Ling Shi had a grudge against the Fallen Soul Abyss and undoubtedly wanted to take revenge.</p><p>Ling Shi’s words held a degree of truth.</p><p>But Gui Hou also had to consider the possibility that their interference might inadvertently attract the ancestor of the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>Gui Hou had followed Qin Sang from the Talisman World to the Great Thousand World and knew that Qin Sang's breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage was unconventional. Facing a true Nascent Soul cultivator, he might not stand a chance.  They should consolidate their foundation and delay contact as long as possible.</p><p>"Don't worry, friend. This guy isn't that important in the Fallen Soul Abyss. There are certainly more than just him infiltrating the Fire Domain.  The old demon has several Metamorphosis Stage late-stage demonic cultivators under him.  The loss of one corpse demon wouldn't even make him blink," Ling Shi said confidently.</p><p>Just as they were arguing, they suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, showing respectful expressions. After listening intently for a moment, they simultaneously bowed to the void.</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>Only after the voice disappeared did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed heartily. "As expected, our senior has seen through everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou remained noncommittal, looking ahead and quickly pursuing. "Friend Ling, we need to discuss our strategy.  Our master requires a capture, it must be foolproof. We can only rely on your poison techniques from now on."</p><p>"No problem! The Fallen Soul Abyss’ corpse demons have been refining corpse poison for years. Ordinary poisons are ineffective against them, but my poison arts are an exception. I'll ensure he doesn't survive!"</p><p>…</p><p>In the cultivation ground.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars.</p>
