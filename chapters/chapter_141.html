<h1>Chapter 134: Nine-Illusions Heavenly Orchid and Du厄 Pill</h1><p>Qin Sang handed Senior Brother Wen his waist token and gave the man a brief explanation.</p><p>“I would like to consult some of the sect’s treasured alchemy classics, or perhaps some ancient texts concerning spiritual herbs. Might I trouble Senior Brother Zhang to grant me some access?”</p><p>“Of course, of course…”</p><p>Senior Brother Zhang happily acquiesced, leading Qin Sang personally to the main palace behind them. The main palace was divided into side rooms, each containing a barrier of seals on the archway with words like “Weapons,” “Symbols,” “Arrays,” and “Alchemy,” respectively. Inside each room were bookshelves lining the walls, giving Qin Sang the feeling of being in a library from his previous life.</p><p>They walked to the innermost part of the palace. Zhang unsealed the Alchemy Chamber and pointed at the bookshelves inside. “Junior Brother Qin, these ancient texts are all more or less related to spiritual herbs and the Dao of Alchemy, although many of them are mostly based on myth and legend. Feel free to browse them. Some of these jade slips contain alchemy recipes, while others are collections of alchemy心得 from our sect. You may only consult part of their contents; if you’d like to see all of it, you will need to pay a small amount of Spirit Stones…”</p><p>Qin Sang walked forward and saw that most of these ancient texts were badly damaged, with a faint glow of spiritual light surrounding them to prevent them from being destroyed by time. However, there weren’t many jade slips.</p><p>With spiritual herbs being scarce and the Dao of Alchemy in decline in the cultivation world these days, only the Taiyi Danzong, a sect established on the foundation of the Dao of Alchemy, had any intention of giving it any attention; the other sects were either unwilling or unable to do so.</p><p>After Qin Sang offered Spirit Stones, Zhang nodded in satisfaction, saying, “Just take your time, Junior Brother Qin. If you need anything at all, just let me know. I shall not disturb you further.”</p><p>After Zhang left, Qin Sang walked over to the jade slips, picked them up one by one, and began to read them.</p><p>The alchemy recipes in these jade slips only provided information on the effects of the elixirs, the spiritual herbs required and their properties, and the nature of the herbs, with the details of the alchemy process sealed off. Only those who paid Spirit Stones would be able to see them, although he had no interest in investing any further effort into the Dao of Alchemy and didn’t need to see those parts.</p><p>He had two objectives in coming here:</p><p>One, to find the origins of the mysterious orchid.</p><p>The other, to see if there were any elixirs or spiritual herbs that could repair his flawed foundation and prevent him from missing out on opportunities because of his ignorance.</p><p>It didn’t take Qin Sang very long to finish browsing through the jade slips. Then he cautiously picked up the ancient texts and started reading them.</p><p>Although the ancient texts were mostly full of fantastical myths and legends, they also contained many strange things that opened Qin Sang’s eyes. It took him most of the day to finish all the ancient texts.</p><p>Putting the last of the ancient texts back in its place, Qin Sang frowned slightly, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>He had indeed learned about two spiritual herbs from the ancient texts and jade slips that could restore a damaged foundation to its original state. One of them was called Daoist Sutra Grass, and the other was called Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit. He had only read about them in the ancient texts; they were merely mentioned in passing in some legendary tale.</p><p>He had no idea what these two spiritual herbs looked like or where they could be found, or if there were any taboos to keep in mind when taking them. Qin Sang was still completely in the dark about all of that.</p><p>There was no mention of the mysterious orchid in any of these texts, either.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, committed the names of the two spiritual herbs and the connected story to memory, then turned and walked out of the Alchemy Chamber. After greeting Zhang, he was about to leave Baota Peak when something suddenly occurred to him. He stopped in his tracks, turned, and asked, “Senior Brother Zhang, are all of the sect’s alchemy classics kept in the Alchemy Chamber?”</p><p>Zhang replied, “The vast majority of them are here, although there are some rare alchemy recipes and important ancient texts kept in the inner palace. It’s just that the inner palace is a rather private place, so we generally don’t allow disciples to enter without permission…”</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that what he wanted might be inside, but the man was being evasive and hesitant, probably intending to ask for something in return.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t have the patience to engage with that kind of game and immediately replied in a solemn voice, “Senior Brother Zhang, I wonder what the requirements are for entering the inner palace. Could it be that one must have a Golden Core Senior decree to do so?”</p><p>Zhang’s expression changed, and he chuckled, saying quickly, “Junior Brother Qin, that is a bit much. I wouldn’t dare disturb Uncle Mawu over such a trivial matter. It’s just a few more Spirit Stones than before; if Junior Brother Qin is interested, I will open the inner palace for you at once.”</p><p>The inner palace contained far fewer jade slips and ancient texts than the outer one. Qin Sang finished browsing all of them before too long. When he left Baota Peak, he looked rather complicated. He had found a record related to the mysterious orchid in one of the jade slips in the inner palace.</p><p>This jade slip was the legacy of an alchemy grandmaster, containing his experiences and insights from his life’s work, most of which was related to the Dao of Alchemy.</p><p>One particular entry described a kind of orchid known as the Nine-Illusions Heavenly Orchid.</p><p>Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid, a wisp of smoke floats above its stamen, transforming into the sun and moon and stars, mountains, rivers, zephyr, and exotic grass; it seems as if a small world exists within the flower, completely matching the attribute of the orchid.</p><p>In addition, the most miraculous thing is, before the medicinal herb matures, the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid will go through nine different orchid forms, which the alchemy master called Molt.</p><p>Only the orchid going through the nine Molts will become the real Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid, and each Molt takes a period of five hundred years.</p><p>Before its first Molt, the shape of the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid was just an ordinary elixir herb;</p><p>After its first Molt, a flower will bloom, and its shape is the most ordinary gladiolus in the mortal world, looking like a gorgeous flower cluster, while in fact all of its petals are one piece.</p><p>Only after the second Molt will the second petal grow.</p><p>On its ninth Molt, the orchid has nine petals, opening in circles, looking extremely ordinary but is called the Sky Orchid.</p><p>The Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid in his hand has only seven petals, and it looks like a snow-covered ink orchid, even if it is about to start its eighth Molt, it will take another five hundred years before it matures.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang almost immediately considered selling out the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid and changing it for some things he could use.</p><p>He has just broken through the Foundation Building Period, and right now, the lifespan he has left is only more than two hundred years. Even if he is lucky enough to reach the Golden Core Stage, if he cannot find a miraculous elixir to prolong his life, he will live for five hundred years at most.</p><p>In other words, he might not be able to see the Nine Fantasy Sky Orchid maturing until his death, and it can only be left as a family heirloom.</p><p>However, something the alchemy master wrote behind made Qin Sang open his eyes wide.</p><p>“This kind of gift from heaven and earth is rarely seen in the world, and it is the primary medicine of Miracle Dan. A person who is about to reach the Nascent Soul Stage will see the probability of reaching the Nascent Soul Stage increase by 20%!”</p><p>Seeing this sentence, Qin Sang was greatly shocked.</p><p>Immortals break through hurdles, and what they fight for is that sliver of lucky chance.</p><p>The difficulty of reaching the Foundation Building Stage, he had already experienced it.</p><p>Along with the increase in cultivation, the difficulty of breaking through hurdles becomes increasingly higher. Celestial Fairy Morning Mist, this kind of heaven’s proud son with a Heavenly Spiritual Root, also failed to reach the Nascent Soul Stage and was forced to change her cultivation to the heretical technique of culling and refining.</p><p>The probability of increasing the chance of reaching the Nascent Soul Stage by 20%, what kind of concept is that?</p><p>When a Golden Core Stage cultivator reaches the Nascent Soul Stage, if they can have a one to two tenths chance, then they can consider themselves lucky; many Golden Core Stage cultivators dare not fight for that tiny chance, they wander the world to gather elixirs, and until their death, they still haven’t found one.</p><p>In the vast Cold Minor Domain, cultivators are everywhere, but there are only eight righteous sects with Nascent Soul Stage ancestors, and it is said that in the Sky Demon Mound and the Demon Gate, there are even fewer.</p>
