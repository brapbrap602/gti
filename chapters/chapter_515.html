<h1>Chapter 508: The False Sect Leader</h1><p>After interrogation, Qin Sang had a thorough understanding of the situation at the Mo Yan Sect.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator, surnamed Luo, was a disciple of Jiu Pao Dao Ren and the newly appointed Mo Yan Envoy.</p><p>Currently, he holds the highest position and possesses the strongest power within the Mo Yan Sect, controlling the sect in place of Jiu Pao Dao Ren.</p><p>Besides the three of them, there are eleven remaining Mo Yan Sect remnants. One is at the Foundation Establishment late-stage, while the others are mostly at the Foundation Establishment mid-stage.</p><p>Even in death, a centipede retains its strength, demonstrating the deep foundation of the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>Jiu Pao Dao Ren intended to sever ties with the Kui Yin Sect, so he strictly forbade any contact between the Kui Yin Sect remnants (excluding the Luo cultivator) and the newly recruited disciples of the Mo Yan Sect.</p><p>They would absorb sufficient Yin煞 energy in the cave, then return to the back mountain for cultivation, never interacting with the new disciples.</p><p>In the Kui Yin Sect, Jiu Pao Dao Ren was their master and uncle.</p><p>These individuals had been hunted by the Yuan Zhao Sect for decades, living in constant fear.  Having finally found a place to hide, they relied entirely on Jiu Pao Dao Ren, daring not to disobey his orders.</p><p>After body snatching, a period of recovery is necessary. Jiu Pao Dao Ren believed he would succeed, so before the attempt, he summoned all his disciples back to the sect.</p><p>Even those stationed in Qingyang City were recalled under various pretexts, awaiting Jiu Pao Dao Ren's return.</p><p>Therefore, the Kui Yin Sect remnants under Jiu Pao Dao Ren's command were all waiting for news within the Mo Yan Sect; Qin Sang didn't need to search elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave, retrieving Jiu Pao Dao Ren's only remaining possession, an iron finger ring.</p><p>Jiu Pao Dao Ren designated this iron ring as the Mo Yan Sect's sect leader's token, stating that whoever presented it would be recognized as the sect leader.</p><p>This information changed Qin Sang's initial plan to disperse the Mo Yan Sect disciples, giving rise to a new strategy.</p><p>After killing the three, placing them in his corpse puppet bag, Qin Sang donned a black robe, put on the iron ring, and flew towards the foot of the volcano, openly approaching the Mo Yan Sect.</p><p>The Mo Yan Sect's protective mountain array was always active.</p><p>To ordinary people, these red-leaf spirit trees appeared ordinary. Only cultivators knew their danger; each tree in the forest was a deadly trap, constantly shifting.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the protective array, he heard a shout from within.</p><p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, keeping his robe on, raising his right hand to display the iron ring.</p><p>"The Sect Leader has returned!"</p><p>A gasp came from within the array, followed by a figure emerging from the forest, bowing before Qin Sang. "Disciple Lu Xing greets the Sect Leader! Please forgive this disciple's transgression!"</p><p>"It was I who ordered you to seal the protective array. What transgression is there?"</p><p>Noticing the doubt in Lu Xing's eyes, Qin Sang remained still, his gaze sweeping across the area.  He calmly asked, "Where are Luo Xiao and Mei Gu?"</p><p>Luo Xiao was the Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator Qin Sang had captured in the cave.</p><p>The doubt vanished from Lu Xing's eyes. He immediately replied, "Reporting to the Sect Leader, Brother Luo went down the mountain last night, his destination unknown. He instructed me to guard the mountain gate.  Senior Sister Mei Gu is currently teaching in the Daoist temple, guiding junior disciples. I shall summon her immediately…"</p><p>"Forget it!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, striding into the Mo Yan Sect.</p><p>"I'll go to the back mountain first. You relay my orders to Mei Gu and the others, telling them to wait at the Daoist temple…"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang used his body technique, disappearing into the forest, leaving only an echo.</p><p>Among the newly recruited disciples of the Mo Yan Sect, besides Ji Wu, who was an exception, the others who successfully reached Foundation Establishment were only at the early stage.</p><p>Lu Xing couldn't see through Qin Sang's body technique.</p><p>Qin Sang infiltrated the area near the halls in the back mountain. Having learned about the Kui Yin Sect remnants from Luo Xiao, he prepared to eliminate them.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang first set up an isolating restriction before deploying the Ten Directions Yama Array. He then summoned his ebony sword and forcefully stormed into a hall.</p><p>The cultivator inside was meditating and was instantly killed without any resistance.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, all eleven Kui Yin Sect remnants in the Mo Yan Sect were dead.</p><p>Each of them had a Ten Directions Yama Banner, though most were destroyed during their escape. The surviving ones were collected by Jiu Pao Dao Ren and given to the four Mo Yan Envoys as a trump card for their travels.</p><p>These individuals longed for the power of the Ten Directions Yama Banners, but the Yuan Zhao Sect continued its pursuit, preventing them from acting recklessly.</p><p>The ten white flames were destroyed by Qin Sang using the Nine Netherworld Devilfire.</p><p>Ji Wu originally also had ten.</p><p>During the great battle at Hanshan City, Jiupao Daoist's magic treasure was tainted by a vile, blood-red light. Driven to a desperate situation, he used Ji Wu's Ten Directions Yama Formation to resist Qin Sang, but even that was destroyed in the fighting.</p><p>The other two Magma Flame Emissaries only had six banners each.</p><p>After killing so many Kuiyin Sect remnants, and adding the spoils from the Magma Flame Emissaries, Qin Sang only recovered fourteen complete Ten Directions Yama Banners.  Not even two full sets.</p><p>The power of the Ten Directions Yama Formation surpasses even that of a spirit treasure; it would fetch a considerable price at auction. However, Qin Sang has yet to form his golden core, and relies on the formation to wield his treasures.  It's best to keep it, just in case.</p><p>Qin Sang erased the last traces of the Kuiyin Sect from the cultivation world. This powerful demonic sect, once a terror in Xiaohan Region, striking fear into the hearts of righteous cultivators, now exists only in history.</p><p>After killing them, Qin Sang cleaned up the spoils, erased all traces of the battle, and flew towards the mountaintop Daoist temple...</p><p>The Magma Flame Sect's temple is located close to the mountaintop. From the temple, one can clearly hear the molten rock churning within the volcano; the air is extremely hot.  However, the Magma Flame Sect disciples cultivate unique techniques, rendering them unfazed by the heat.</p><p>Four individuals—three men and a woman—stood on the temple grounds. Among them were Lu Xing, and two other young men of similar age: Zhao Shanran, and one who called himself Red Leaf Scholar. The woman, a matron in elegant court robes, was Mei Gu.  She was the most powerful of the four, already sensing the threshold of mid-Foundation Establishment.</p><p>These four were the only remaining Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Magma Flame Sect. Originally independent cultivators with exceptional talent, they had been accepted into the sect and successfully formed their golden cores.</p><p>The four anxiously awaited.  An hour had passed, and still, there was no sign of their sect leader.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, is the Sect Master truly returned?  Aren’t you just teasing us?”</p><p>Zhao Shanran, impatient with the wait, questioned Lu Xing.</p><p>Lu Xing's eyes widened. “Senior Brother Zhao, don’t speak nonsense! Even if I were bold enough, I wouldn't dare to falsely convey the Sect Master’s decree!  I advise you to be careful, lest you bring trouble upon yourself…”</p><p>As his words ended, a black-robed figure appeared before them, seemingly out of thin air.  There was no warning.</p><p>The four were startled, recognizing Qin Sang's iron finger ring. They immediately prostrated themselves.</p><p>“Disciples greet the Sect Master!”</p>
