<h1>Chapter 1366: Exposure</h1><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely.</p><p>Today was the day of the Outer Disciples' Competition.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu presided over the competition.</p><p>She and her Daoist partner were a deeply loving couple, an enviable pair in Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The arena was set up on the bank of a large river, on the highest peak of the Outer Sect.  From the summit, one could see the Inner Sect, serving as an inspiration for the Outer Disciples.</p><p>Cheers occasionally rang out from the summit.</p><p>This was the final match, deciding the ultimate victor.</p><p>Outer Disciples surrounded the arena, cheering for both sides. Even some Inner Sect male disciples came to watch.</p><p>On the arena.</p><p>One contestant was a boy in yellow, unremarkable in appearance and demeanor.</p><p>The other was a beautiful girl in flowing white robes.</p><p>The girl had snow-white skin and a cool temperament.</p><p>She held a spirit sword, its body as crystalline as ice, matching her cold beauty.</p><p>Everyone loves beauty.</p><p>Clearly, most people were there to watch the girl, their cheers drowning out the river's roar. A few of the boy's companions tried to encourage him, but their voices were lost in the din, so they gave up.</p><p>"Go, Sister Lu!"</p><p>"Take him down!"</p><p>"I bet this kid can't last five moves against Sister Lu."</p><p>"Three at most…"</p><p>…</p><p>The protective barrier around the arena couldn't block the sound.</p><p>The boy was overwhelmed by the noise, alone and helpless, clutching a blackened fire poker, looking rather pitiful.</p><p>The girl didn't show any smugness. Her lips parted slightly.  "Junior Brother Zhang, I didn't expect you to be my final opponent. Please enlighten me!"</p><p>The boy seemed distracted, his eyes vacant.</p><p>He seemed overwhelmed by the spectacle.</p><p>The girl frowned.</p><p>Then, the Outer Sect attendant announced the start of the match.</p><p>As clever as she was, the girl saw that her opponent was behaving strangely, but her resolve was firm; she would give her all no matter who her opponent was!</p><p>The girl gestured with her right hand, and her spirit sword flew into the air.</p><p>The sword's energy vibrated, her robes fluttered, captivating the onlookers, and cheers echoed throughout the Outer Sect.</p><p>The boy, as if waking from a dream, hurriedly raised his blackened fire poker.</p><p>This, predictably, provoked laughter.</p><p>It was hard to imagine who would refine such an ugly magical artifact, yet the boy had used it to win every match and reach the final.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The spirit sword struck without mercy, transforming into a blue sword beam.</p><p>Provoked by the sword beam, the fire poker emitted a brilliant green light, suddenly shooting skyward.</p><p>The green and blue lights collided with a deafening crash.  Both figures blurred, and the intertwining green and blue light swept outwards, causing the protective barrier to tremble repeatedly.</p><p>The audience pressed against the barrier recoiled in alarm, then breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the barrier holding firm, their faces filled with astonishment at the power of the initial clash.</p><p>The girl was also surprised. The fire poker not only withstood her spirit sword, but it also had a strange sucking power, causing her spiritual energy to become unstable, even showing signs of boiling.</p><p>The boy's cultivation was clearly a level below hers.</p><p>This battle couldn't be lost!</p><p>The girl gritted her teeth, no longer hesitating, and immediately used a newly mastered secret technique.</p><p>"Divine Sword Thunder Technique!"</p><p>With a cry, the spirit sword let out a long hum, flashed blue, and suddenly transformed into a beam of light, striking down at the boy with terrifying power!</p><p>"What! Junior Sister Lu has already mastered the Divine Sword Thunder Technique!"</p><p>"She's a genius!"</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>The light pillar was like a thunderbolt, its momentum earth-shattering, as if it could split a mountain.</p><p>Of course, it didn't possess the true power of a thunderbolt, nor was it a sonic boom, but a treasured sword technique of Qingyang Temple. For the girl to master it at her level marked her as a swordsmanship genius.</p><p>Outside the arena, Bai Hanqiu looked at the girl with approval, while an attendant beside her watched the boy with a tense expression, his eyes hinting at expectation.</p><p>Before the boy, there was nothing but the fire poker.</p><p>His face contorted, bleeding from his orifices, he grasped the fire poker – a circular crystal on its end faintly glowed crimson – and charged toward the light pillar.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thunderous roar.</p><p>The arena shook violently.</p><p>The blue and green lights were almost indistinguishable.</p><p>The crowd fell silent, their faces tense as they watched the arena.</p><p>*BOOM… BOOM…*</p><p>Suddenly, the blue light dimmed, and the girl flew backward. Her face was pale, her breath weak, and her spiritual energy almost depleted. She barely managed to steady herself.</p><p>The boy, however, spat blood and fell from the arena like a rag doll.</p><p>"Junior Sister Lu wins!"</p><p>After a brief silence, the crowd cheered excitedly.</p><p>But the girl remained silent, standing there, staring blankly at the boy.</p><p>"Pathetic!"</p><p>The attendant, distressed and heartbroken, clearly saw that the boy had faltered at the last moment.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's expression, however, wasn't unkind.</p><p>Just as she was about to speak, she suddenly saw a refined figure in the crowd nod slightly at her. Thinking she had imagined it, she quickly focused her gaze.</p><p>After whispering a few words to the attendant, Bai Hanqiu, ignoring the stares of her fellow disciples, transformed into a streak of light and flew into the inner sect.  Seeing Qin Sang strolling among the mountains, she respectfully followed, "Disciple greets Master. Did Master also watch the disciples' competition?"</p><p>"The vigor and spirit of youth.  This allows me to reminisce about the past,"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>In truth, he had encountered numerous setbacks during his early cultivation and had no opportunity to participate in the sect's competition. Even after joining Mount Shao Hua, he avoided such events whenever possible.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't blame her, Bai Hanqiu breathed a sigh of relief and continued, "That male disciple, I don't know where he got his luck, but the artifact he wielded seems to have some history. Senior Brother Tan said it has the potential to become a high-level magic weapon…"</p><p>"It's a blood-forged evil artifact, but don't worry about it. Artifacts are neither good nor evil; it all depends on the owner's character."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded unconcernedly. He knew what Bai Hanqiu feared.  He had been in seclusion for so many years, and Bai Hanqiu's cultivation hadn't progressed much. It seemed she had abandoned the path of cultivation.  This was Bai Hanqiu's own choice, and Qin Sang wouldn't interfere.</p><p>Changing the subject, Qin Sang asked, "Has the Han family moved out of Da Sui?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded repeatedly, reporting to Qin Sang.</p><p>Da Sui was the place where the Qingyang Temple flourished. Jiang Xue acted wisely, ordering the Han Manor to relocate, ceding Da Sui and a large surrounding territory to the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, understanding Da Sui's significance to Qin Sang, stationed an attendant there, designating Mount Chao Sheng as a sacred site.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu became the current head of the Bai family.</p><p>The Bai family instantly transformed into a cultivator family.</p><p>However, the Qin family remained the imperial family of Da Sui, enjoying great wealth and power, but unfortunately, no descendants with cultivation talent had appeared.  Any offspring with spiritual roots would immediately be brought to the Qingyang Temple for cultivation.</p>
