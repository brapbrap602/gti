<h1>Chapter 1755: Journey East</h1><p>A boat sailed on the river.</p><p>The boatman glanced ahead, then hurried back to the cabin and knocked on a door.</p><p>“Honored guest, Shepherd Ghost Pass is almost here.”</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the cabin.</p><p>The boatman, with a fawning smile, chattered, “By official decree, only government ships can pass Shepherd Ghost Pass. If private vessels like ours dare to cross the line, the River God will raise storms as a warning. If we continue further, he'll capsize the boat as punishment.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but you'll have to transfer to a government ship ahead…”</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the bow and looked around. The riverbanks were out of sight. A dark silhouette appeared on the river ahead – a majestic watchtower, like a bridge spanning the waterway.</p><p>A black and gold banner fluttered in the wind, emblazoned with the characters ‘Shepherd Ghost.’  Floating bridges connected the tower to both riverbanks, and figures could be seen walking across them.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information he had gathered earlier.  Beyond Shepherd Ghost Pass, Mount Juzhi wasn't far. The area ahead was not peaceful, and there was a possibility of demonic spirits raiding along the river. The pass served as protection.</p><p>He had set out from Central Prosperity Prefecture, travelling westward.  Sometimes he journeyed swiftly, while other times he travelled like ordinary people, taking boats and staying at inns.  This not only allowed him to experience the local customs of the Dao Court's territories, but also provided opportunities for cultivation during his travels.</p><p>He was now in White Stone Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of the North Pole Exorcism Court, less than three years since his departure.</p><p>It wasn't that he travelled exceptionally fast, or that the Dao Court's territory was small, but that each prefecture within the Dao Court had a Great Teleportation Formation.  These formations were even more refined than the ancient teleportation arrays of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The Dao Court's territory was vast, making these formations essential for Daoist cultivators' travels. People came and went constantly.</p><p>Using the Great Teleportation Formation only required spirit stones, and identities were rarely scrutinized.  As long as Qin Sang didn't activate his Heavenly Demon Transformation, he could completely conceal his demonic aura.  With a little manipulation, it wasn't difficult to blend in.</p><p>White Stone Prefecture was located northeast of Central Prosperity Prefecture. Qin Sang had only travelled along the edge of White Stone Prefecture, and both prefectures felt very similar to him.</p><p>Following the great river where Shepherd Ghost Pass stood would lead directly to Mount Juzhi Prefecture, but it wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Even government ships wouldn't proceed beyond the border of White Stone Prefecture.  Those who wanted to enter Mount Juzhi Prefecture had to travel alone, facing various dangers along the way.</p><p>The safest approach was to seek out the North Pole Exorcism Court.  Any Daoist disciple wishing to hunt demonic spirits could petition the Immortal Officials of the North Pole Exorcism Court for protection.</p><p>Cultivators hunting demonic spirits in Mount Juzhi Prefecture couldn't operate independently of the two Courts of the Dao Court.</p><p>Even though Daoist disciples were devoted to eliminating demons and upholding the righteous path, they needed sufficient cultivation and suitable external resources.</p><p>Merits earned in Mount Juzhi Prefecture could be exchanged for rare treasures at the two Courts to enhance one’s cultivation, which was why so many Daoist disciples were willing to face such perils.</p><p>Upon learning this, Qin Sang knew he had come to the right place. Mount Juzhi Prefecture undoubtedly offered more opportunities.</p><p>In their fight against the Ghostfang Kingdom, the two Courts of the Dao Court couldn't enforce laws as strictly as they did within the heart of the Dao Court.</p><p>His opportunity might lie here.</p><p>His thoughts swirling, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and paid the boatman.  Changing boats at Shepherd Ghost Pass was agreed upon beforehand, so there was no need to blame the boatman.</p><p>The boatman weighed the payment in his hand, beaming, then returned to steer the boat. Soon, they arrived at the foot of the watchtower.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and climbed the tower. A guard led him towards a government ship. Just as he was about to board, he paused slightly, then stepped onto the ship as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The guard didn't notice the subtle shift in the aura of the person behind him.</p><p>The government ship lacked the refined arrangements of private vessels. The cabin was open, and all the passengers, mostly mortals, sat in the main hall.</p><p>“Brother, today is the last day. It's almost noon. Why hasn't your friend Liu arrived yet?”</p><p>In a corner of the hall, a man and a woman, both dressed in Daoist robes, sat at a round table.</p><p>The table had ten seats. With the pair seated there, the mortals, fearing disturbing the Immortal Masters, avoided them as much as possible, leaving even the two adjacent tables empty.</p><p>The few cultivators on board, sensing the pair’s far superior cultivation, also dared not approach them.</p><p>The speaker was the woman, dressed in a goose-yellow Daoist robe with a Clarity Pendant at her waist. Resting her chin on her arms, she spoke with a lazy, slightly complaining tone, her small feet swinging beneath the table.</p><p>The handsome man beside her, dressed in a plain white robe, softly consoled, “It's still an hour until noon. Don't worry, Junior Sister.  Friend Liu is a man of his word. He definitely wouldn't…”</p><p>As he spoke, the man seemed to sense something and glanced back, his gaze falling on Qin Sang, who had just entered.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Qin Sang gave a cupped-hand salute.</p><p>The man hurriedly rose and returned the gesture.  Seeing Qin Sang walk past them to sit further inside, he hesitated, then remained where he was.</p><p>The woman merely glanced at Qin Sang with almond-shaped eyes, then lost interest and looked away.</p><p>Just then, the clouds in the sky churned violently. A gust of wind blew apart the white clouds and swept across the river, causing waves to ripple across its surface.</p><p>Within the wind, a golden eagle with a wingspan of several dozen feet appeared.</p><p>Suddenly, someone screamed, "A demon!"</p><p>A dark shadow surfaced beneath the river, two eerie eyes gazing upwards, then quickly submerged again.</p><p>Panic threatened to erupt within the cabin. A Daoist spoke clearly, “It's not a demon. It’s a talisman spirit conjured by a fellow Daoist. Don't be afraid.”</p><p>The golden eagle, spotting the government ship, suddenly swooped down, triggering another wave of screams.</p><p>The man and woman had appeared above the ship.</p><p>The man raised his hand, palm up. As the golden eagle was about to land, its form shrunk abruptly, transforming into a palm-sized paper kite. It circled his palm, then turned into a talisman paper and drifted down.</p><p>The man sighed softly.</p><p>“Friend Liu’s sect has summoned him urgently. He can’t make it.”</p><p>“I told you he was glib and unreliable!” the woman pouted.</p><p>“Junior Sister, watch your words!”</p><p>The man’s tone sharpened.  “Friend Liu used his most precious Golden Eagle Talisman to send the message. He must have encountered a genuine emergency, not that he’s breaking his promise.”</p><p>The woman snorted, dissatisfied. “We've already accepted the decree and must complete it within the time limit.  That Shen fellow is waiting for us ahead.  Suddenly losing one person, where are we going to find another helper in this remote place? What are we going to do?”</p><p>Her words held merit. The man frowned. “If we ask Senior Sister Yi for help now, I don't know if she'll be able to make it in time…”</p><p>Then, as if remembering something, the man’s expression shifted slightly, and he pulled his junior sister back into the cabin.</p><p>The ship's captain hurried over to ask for instructions.</p><p>The man dismissed him casually.  Soon, the ship vibrated gently and began to move.</p><p>After observing for a while, the man suddenly rose and walked towards Qin Sang.</p><p>“Here it comes!”</p><p>Qin Sang had his back to the man, but he was fully aware of his actions.</p><p>Along his journey, Qin Sang would sometimes release his aura like this, attracting people to approach him and initiate conversations. This saved him the trouble of fabricating a background and instead made him appear enigmatic.  It had worked every time.</p><p>“Greetings, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone at his table.  The man approached and gave a cupped-hand salute.</p><p>“Greetings, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the gesture and gestured to the empty seat.</p><p>The man didn’t hesitate and sat opposite Qin Sang. “I am Shi Xuan of Nine Glories Celestial Cave. May I ask for your name, fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone remained lukewarm.  “I am Qingfeng.”</p><p>Shi Xuan paused slightly. There were countless Daoists named Qingfeng, especially among Daoist attendants whose masters favored names like Qingfeng (Clear Wind) and Mingyue (Bright Moon).</p><p>This must be an alias!</p><p>Shi Xuan thought to himself.  Considering the other party's unwillingness to reveal his origins and the region they were heading to, he believed he had figured out part of the story. This person likely intended to go to Mount Juzhi Prefecture to hunt demons and make a name for himself, unwilling to rely on his sect’s influence, or perhaps be bound by them. Thus, he was travelling to Mount Juzhi Prefecture alone.</p><p>He had once entertained similar thoughts, but after careful consideration, he had made the most rational choice.</p><p>Thinking of this, Shi Xuan couldn't help but admire, “Fellow Daoist seeks to do what others cannot.  I admire your ambition.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know what this person was thinking and didn't bother to correct him, tacitly accepting the assumption.</p><p>This further convinced Shi Xuan, but his tone changed slightly. “Fellow Daoist’s pursuit of extraordinary feats is commendable, but one must also know one’s limits.”</p><p>“Does Fellow Daoist Shi think my strength is insufficient?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Shi Xuan quickly shook his head. “Fellow Daoist’s cultivation is comparable to ours, which is sufficient for venturing into Mount Juzhi Prefecture.  But demonic spirits possess詭谲 supernatural powers, and one must be cautious.  It’s always possible to encounter situations beyond one’s capabilities alone. It's best to seek out a few like-minded fellow Daoists for mutual support.”</p><p>Currently, the aura Qin Sang emitted was similar to theirs, around the mid-Gold Core stage.</p><p>The corners of Qin Sang’s mouth curved into a faint, mocking smile. “It wasn't that I was being impolite, but your conversation with your junior sister on the boat wasn't particularly discreet, and I happened to overhear it. Fellow Daoist, are you planning something significant and lack a helper?”</p><p>Shi Xuan felt a bit embarrassed that Qin Sang’s hearing was so sharp, but this only strengthened his desire to recruit him. “Since Fellow Daoist has seen through us, I will be frank.  A few days ago, my junior sister and I accepted a decree from the North Pole Exorcism Court, requiring us to complete a task in Mount Juzhi Prefecture. We invited two helpers, but unfortunately, one couldn’t make it due to an emergency.  Time is tight.  Seeing Fellow Daoist travelling alone, seemingly without any urgent matters, I had the thought of inviting you to join us.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred at these words.</p><p>He had heard of decrees before. They mostly came from the two Courts of the Dao Court.</p><p>The decrees outlined the tasks to be completed and the rewards upon completion. Those who were confident in their abilities could accept them. These decrees were most common in Mount Juzhi Prefecture, and the rewards were often very generous.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang seemed interested, Shi Xuan continued, “As long as Fellow Daoist agrees, I will reveal the contents of the decree as soon as we enter Mount Juzhi Prefecture. Once the task is completed, we are willing to share half of the merit with you.  However, we would need the two treasures among the rewards.”</p><p>Merit was one of the rewards for hunting demons and completing decrees. It was said to be extremely useful.</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to investigate the situation in Mount Juzhi Prefecture first. He might as well take on this task while he was at it.  After a moment of contemplation, he nodded.</p><p>Overjoyed at securing a helper so easily, Shi Xuan quickly invited Qin Sang to their table and introduced the woman. “This is my junior sister, Luo Yin.”</p><p>Luo Yin had delicate features and a playful air about her. Looking at the helper her senior brother had picked up midway, she couldn’t hide the suspicion in her eyes. Wrinkling her nose, she was about to say something when a hearty laugh boomed from outside the cabin.</p><p>“Luo lass, Big Brother Shen is here!  Why aren’t you coming out to greet me?”</p><p>Luo Yin’s nose wrinkled further. “That annoying fellow is here!”</p><p>Several splashing sounds followed.</p><p>The cabin suddenly darkened as everyone instinctively looked towards the door. A towering man, built like an iron pagoda, stood blocking the entrance.</p><p>He had a broad back and powerful shoulders, nine feet tall, his body wider than the door itself, sealing it completely.</p><p>His Daoist robe stretched tautly over his frame, making everyone wonder if it would burst.</p><p>Seeing the three in the corner, the giant man laughed again and stepped into the cabin, causing the ship to rock twice.</p><p>“Luo lass, I haven’t seen you in a year. Have you missed Big Brother Shen?”</p><p>“Brother Shen, stop teasing Junior Sister.  Wasn't last time’s lesson enough?” Shi Xuan rose with a smile to greet him, leading the giant man towards Qin Sang.  “Let me introduce you two. This is my good friend Shen Huo, from the Shen Family Estate. And this is Fellow Daoist Qingfeng.”</p><p>Shen Huo looked Qin Sang up and down, somewhat puzzled. “Didn't you send a message saying you’d invited that Liu fellow? How come it’s this Fellow Daoist Qingfeng?”</p><p>“There’s been a change of plans…”</p><p>Shi Xuan pulled Shen Huo down to sit and explained the situation in detail.</p><p>Shen Huo snorted. “Luo lass was right. That Liu fellow must have run away.  I'll settle the score with him when I get back!”</p><p>He then slammed his hand on the table, turned to Qin Sang, and said, "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, I'm not one for beating around the bush. This matter is of great importance, and there’s no room for error.  If you want me to fight alongside you with peace of mind, I need to gauge your strength first.”</p><p>Shi Xuan and Luo Yin didn't stop him, instead turning their gaze towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't uttered a word since their arrival.</p><p>He had heard of Nine Glories Celestial Cave. It was a fairly renowned sect under the North Pole Exorcism Court’s jurisdiction.</p><p>He was unfamiliar with the Shen Family Estate, however.</p><p>From his observation, Shen Huo was likely a body cultivator. He also wanted to test the other party's abilities.</p><p>“How does Fellow Daoist Shen intend to test me?”</p><p>Qin Sang rose gracefully, his voice calm and unperturbed.</p><p>“A direct test will do!”</p><p>Shen Huo laughed heartily, a heavy black iron sword appearing in his hand.</p><p>The sword was taller than he was, like a door panel, yet he wielded it with ease.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>After deftly maneuvering the sword, Shen Huo’s right arm bulged with muscle, a golden light flowing through it as he brought the sword down towards Qin Sang!</p><p>Shi Xuan acted swiftly, releasing a wave of azure light that enveloped the cabin, shielding the others within.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of wind blasted forth.</p><p>The sword’s momentum was incredibly fierce; splitting the ship in two would have been child’s play.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, tilting his head slightly upward as the sword’s shadow enveloped him. He remained motionless until the black iron sword was about to cleave his skull.  Then, his right shoulder twitched.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A sound like a golden drum reverberated through the air.</p><p>The heavy sword, descending with such force, stopped abruptly mid-air. Qin Sang had somehow raised his right fist and struck the side of the blade.</p><p>Neither moved an inch.</p><p>The ship beneath them shuddered violently, and a colossal wave, hundreds of feet high, erupted outside, blotting out the sky.  It crashed down a moment later.</p><p>Shen Huo's wrist trembled slightly as he slowly lowered his sword, his eyes gleaming with a strange light. Then he burst into laughter. “Excellent! I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, who appears to be a frail scholar, to be like me, cultivating the Dragon and Tiger Forging, not the Soldier and Steed Formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his fist with a smile.</p><p>He had already learned that not all Daoist cultivators summoned soldiers and steeds. Some, like demon cultivators, condensed their qi and blood into a crucible known as the Dragon and Tiger Forging.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
