<h1>Chapter 2084: All in Motion</h1><p>Chapter 2085: All in Motion</p><p>Holy沐 Plain, Holy Lake, Clan Leader's Estate.</p><p>Min Zhuo, Clan Leader of the Changyou Clan, held a secret letter from Mount Min, lost in thought.</p><p>His third son, Min Shu, waited outside the meditation chamber for instructions.</p><p>Ever since the mysterious figure delivered the talismanic message, Min Zhuo had ordered that their strategy towards the foreign races remain unchanged, but demanded that any significant movements by the foreign races be reported to him immediately.</p><p>Yesterday, the general stationed on Mount Min sent a secret letter. Min Shu believed the contents were of utmost importance, and personally presented it to Min Zhuo for a decision.</p><p>Min Shu gazed at the wooden door of the meditation chamber, his mind restless.</p><p>After that encounter, the mysterious figure never appeared again. But since that day, Min Shu had keenly noticed a peculiar shift in his father's attitude whenever the foreign races were mentioned.</p><p>His usually decisive father displayed rare hesitation and uncertainty, as if apprehensive about something.</p><p>Although his father kept it a closely guarded secret, Min Shu could make some educated guesses.</p><p>The Changyou Clan was merely a minuscule tribe within the Zhuyan Clan's territory, insignificant in the Heavenly Division, let alone the entire Foreign Race. Throughout the entire Changyou Clan, they possessed nothing that could attract the attention of a Void Realm Second Stage expert.</p><p>The most likely explanation was that the existence of the Azure Spirit Qi had been exposed!</p><p>In the legends of the Foreign Races, the Tainted Lands were a land of death, the final destination of the deceased. People held both reverence and fear for the Tainted Lands. Yet, treasures of unparalleled rarity could also be born there, and this Azure Spirit Qi was one such unique treasure, unheard of before.</p><p>His father had confirmed that the potency of the Azure Spirit Qi diminished as cultivation increased, and it couldn't aid cultivators in breaking through to the Void Realm Second Stage. In the eyes of the top-tier clans, it might not hold much value. However, for most tribes, Void Realm First Stage cultivators were the backbone of their strength.</p><p>Min Shu couldn't fathom why the mysterious figure hadn't simply seized the Azure Spirit Qi, and what their true motives were.  A sense of unease lingered in his heart.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Min Shu sensed a subtle fluctuation. Thinking his father was about to emerge, he prepared to bow, but was surprised to find the meditation chamber sealed by a restrictive formation.</p><p>Min Shu was secretly astonished, yet he didn't dare leave without permission, so he continued to wait patiently.</p><p>Inside the meditation chamber.</p><p>Min Zhuo sealed the chamber, took out a jade pearl, and hesitated.</p><p>This jade pearl was a gift from the mysterious figure after he received the Jade Yang Divine Milk.  By channeling True Essence into it, he could directly contact the mysterious figure.</p><p>Gently rubbing the pearl a few times, Min Zhuo steeled his resolve, infused it with True Essence, and with a *bang*, the jade pearl exploded into a cloud of mist. Within the mist, a faint, blurry figure gradually materialized, flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>Min Zhuo had already positioned himself respectfully before the mist, and said deferentially, "I apologize for disturbing you, Senior. I hope you will forgive my intrusion."</p><p>The mist was hazy, yet Min Zhuo felt as if a pair of eyes were gazing upon him from across an endless void, causing his heart to tighten.</p><p>He had activated the jade pearl within the Holy Land partly as a test. He hadn't expected the figure to be unaffected by the Holy Lake's restrictions and appear instantly.</p><p>"Have you mastered that secret technique?"</p><p>The mysterious figure spoke, their voice faint.</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart stirred. He guessed that the Holy Lake was indeed affecting the mysterious figure, but relying on the Holy Lake to confront this person was definitely not a viable option.</p><p>He couldn't help but feel apprehensive, and bowed, "This junior has comprehended ninety percent, but there are a few points I haven't been able to grasp. I dare to ask for Senior's guidance."</p><p>This secret technique, combined with refining the Jade Yang Divine Milk, could achieve twice the results with half the effort. With the secret technique and the Jade Yang Divine Milk, his path to breakthrough would be smoother than ever before.</p><p>At least for now, he had benefited immensely.</p><p>The mysterious figure hummed in acknowledgement, waited for Min Zhuo's questions, and offered a few pointers.</p><p>Min Zhuo's doubts were cleared one by one, yet his vigilance increased. His face, however, was filled with gratitude. "Thank you, Senior, for enlightening me!"</p><p>"This treasure can only be maintained for a limited time. If you have anything else to say, don't hold back."</p><p>The mysterious figure seemed to have seen through Min Zhuo's thoughts, and spoke frankly.</p><p>Min Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but his expression remained unchanged. "This junior does have one more matter. I initially didn't want to bother Senior, but it concerns those foreign races. The situation is somewhat peculiar, and I cannot grasp it. I dare not act rashly."</p><p>"Tell me," the mysterious figure seemed intrigued.</p><p>"This junior previously appointed Min Shan as Supreme General, commanding our armies abroad to deter the foreign races.  Some time ago, a member of a foreign race defected to him. This individual holds a high position among the foreign races and provided some intelligence…"</p><p>Min Zhuo recounted the whole story.</p><p>It turned out that after receiving the intelligence, Min Shan, driven by curiosity, made a few tentative attempts. Unexpectedly, the intelligence proved accurate, catching the North Sea off guard.</p><p>Of course, for now, it could only be considered minor skirmishes, with no significant victories. However, it was enough to prove the defector's capabilities, and that they weren't boasting.</p><p>Regardless of the credibility of future intelligence from this individual, if they truly intended to conquer the North Sea, preparations would be necessary. They would need to secretly mobilize their army and gather them in the North Sea in advance.</p><p>This involved a change in strategy, which Min Shan, as Supreme General, couldn't decide on his own. He had to consult the Clan Leader and the Clan Elders.</p><p>"You're saying someone willingly defected, and you've succeeded a few times based on their intelligence?" The mysterious figure seemed surprised.</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded, finding it strange as well.</p><p>Having learned about the Void Refinement Stage expert backing the foreign races, he was eager to avoid conflict. If not for the mysterious figure's request to maintain the status quo so as not to arouse suspicion, he would have already ordered his army to retreat.</p><p>Min Zhuo was worried about provoking the expert, so he had only hinted to Min Shan to exercise caution. He hadn't expected Min Shan to misunderstand his intentions, let alone plan to conquer the North Sea.  Even more unexpected was his success, and the apparent lack of response from the powerful figure behind the foreign races.</p><p>It made one wonder if the so-called expert even existed.</p><p>The mysterious figure pondered for a moment, then suddenly chuckled. "It seems that being within the Sea of Mist, even that one has reservations. You mentioned earlier that the North Sea is primarily inhabited by humans?"</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded. "Indeed, Fairy Liu Li's sect is located in the North Sea."</p><p>"That explains it! That one is of demonic origin. Even if the North Sea is eliminated, the demon race won't suffer much, but it would significantly weaken the human race."</p><p>The mysterious figure sneered. They knew the capabilities of a Void Refinement Stage expert. Such incidents might happen once, but it was impossible for them to occur repeatedly under the watchful eye of a Void Refinement Stage expert, unless the expert intentionally allowed it.</p><p>"It seems that one also acts strategically.  Good, following the rules!  This old man despises reckless fools. If that one is using you to eliminate their rivals, you might as well cooperate."</p><p>Min Zhuo was slightly startled. "Senior, you mean…?"</p><p>"Remember what this old man said before?  Pretend this old man and that one don't exist. Act as you would have before," the mysterious figure stated faintly as their form gradually faded.</p><p>The mist dissipated, transforming back into the jade pearl, landing in Min Zhuo's hand.</p><p>Min Zhuo continued to ponder the mysterious figure's words.</p><p>Those who are not of our kind are inherently different. This principle holds true everywhere.</p><p>The Foreign Races were comprised of numerous tribes. If not for the ancient covenants and the later requirement for all Saint Realm experts to enter the Holy Land, they would have been embroiled in countless internal conflicts, and smaller tribes like theirs would have struggled to survive.</p><p>Those foreign races couldn't possibly be completely united. They had joined forces solely to oppose the Changyou Clan. It seemed that the demon race expert only intended to protect their own kind.</p><p>Since it wasn't a direct confrontation with the expert, Min Zhuo's worries eased somewhat.</p><p>In truth, the Changyou Clan had no choice. Before he broke through to the Void Realm Second Stage, he could only follow orders.</p><p>With that in mind, Min Zhuo wrote a talismanic message and pushed open the door of the meditation chamber.</p><p>"Father," Min Shu bowed.</p><p>Min Zhuo handed him the talisman. "Inform the Supreme General to proceed according to this. I will explain matters to the Clan Elders."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Min Shu didn't dare ask further questions and departed with the message.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Gui Hou arrived from the west, approaching Qingyang Temple undetected.  Appearing outside the mountain, he saw the dense fog created by the grand formation, obscuring the sky and sun, and remembered he had forgotten to request a token earlier.</p><p>He thought for a moment, then sent a streak of light into the formation, and waited. The fog rippled, revealing a small path.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Gui," Li Yufu's voice called from within.</p><p>"How dare I trouble Temple Master Li to personally greet me!"</p><p>Gui Hou felt honored.  This was the junior whom the Grand Patriarch relied upon, the current Temple Master of Qingyang Temple, and potentially the inheritor of the Grand Patriarch's mantle.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Gui, you are too kind. All fellow Daoists have labored tirelessly for Senior Martial Uncle, for Qingyang Temple, and for the living beings of the Storm Realm. I am deeply grateful."</p><p>Li Yufu spoke with sincerity.</p><p>Gui Hou and Luo Hou were nominally demon servants, but their cultivation was profound. Aside from Qin Sang, no one dared treat them as mere servants.</p><p>Seeing Li Yufu's respect, Gui Hou felt pleased, and returned the courtesy. "Temple Master Li oversees everything, strategizing and planning. Our efforts are only effective because of your guidance. I have come here to report something to Temple Master Li."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please come inside and speak."</p><p>Li Yufu invited Gui Hou to the main peak, and they sat down.</p><p>Gui Hou recounted the information he had gathered. "After the Dragon King made his move during the Three Clans Conference, he has been restless. Though he tried to conceal it, he couldn't hide it from my eyes.  They have been secretly mobilizing elite members of their clan, sending them in groups to the Demon Sea…"</p><p>The actions of the Demon Sea demon race indicated they were determined to reclaim the Falling Moon Valley.</p><p>Li Yufu's expression turned thoughtful. "To be honest, I've recently received some news from the North Sea.  There have been several attacks on the North Sea recently, which are rather suspicious.  I haven't investigated further for fear of alerting them."</p><p>Gui Hou's expression shifted slightly.  He and Li Yufu exchanged glances, both thinking of the same possibility.</p><p>These two events, individually, might not seem significant, but together, they were quite intriguing.</p><p>In fact, the other party's every move was extremely cautious. Because they had laid this trap first, they were constantly watching, and with the help of a top expert like Gui Hou, they noticed these anomalies. Otherwise, they would have surely been overlooked.</p><p>"Does Temple Master Li think the Dragon King might be trying to divert attention, using the North Sea to attract the Changyou Clan, drawing away their army, and then taking advantage of the Demon Sea's vulnerability to reclaim the Falling Moon Valley?"  Gui Hou mused.</p><p>"It could also be a plan to kill multiple birds with one stone!"</p><p>Li Yufu said calmly.</p><p>They might have already seen through the enemy's plan, but neither of them seemed rushed, as if they were watching a play unfold.</p><p>The deeper the enemy's schemes, the more disastrous their downfall would be!</p><p>Gui Hou sneered. "Let's see what kind of strategy this Dragon King has!  Unfortunately, they'll have to wait at least until the Dragon King or the Dragon Scale Holy King breaks through to the late stage of Nascent Soul before they dare to make any major moves. That will likely take a few more years, or even decades."</p><p>Li Yufu nodded. It was still unclear how long Senior Martial Uncle would need to complete the main altar.  They might as well let them enjoy their moment of triumph and simply observe for now.</p><p>"I've also come to request something from Temple Master Li," Gui Hou said, cupping his hands slightly.  He explained, "I've heard that Palace Master Tong of the Xuan Tian Palace and Palace Master Bao of the Four Saints Palace have been planning to build branch altars for some time, and have already chosen locations.  Only the Demon Sea hasn't been reclaimed yet, and the construction of the altar there remains a distant prospect.  I wish to share Grand Patriarch's burden and take this opportunity to infiltrate the Demon Sea, survey the terrain, and search for a suitable location to build the altar…"</p><p>After the ascension of the entire Storm Realm, the terrain and landforms had undergone drastic changes, and later occupied by the Changyou Clan, it was completely unrecognizable.</p><p>Gui Hou had obtained some ancient texts from the Demon Sea demon race and the Four Saints Palace, but they weren't applicable to the present situation. He had to personally conduct a survey.</p><p>"There are Changyou Clan experts stationed there. I'm worried that if I encounter any unexpected situations, I'll be alone and vulnerable.  Could Fellow Daoist Luo accompany me to the Demon Sea?" Gui Hou asked.</p><p>The Demon Sea, combined with the Vast Wave Sea, covered a vast area.  The most important locations were certainly guarded by Changyou Clan experts. Conducting a thorough survey would not be a quick task and would inevitably involve venturing into dangerous territory.  He needed someone to provide support.</p><p>He was most familiar with Luo Hou, and they could trust each other.</p><p>"The Demon Sea is surrounded by foreign races, and Fellow Daoist is willing to risk your life. I will certainly commend your contributions to Senior Martial Uncle when the opportunity arises!"</p><p>Li Yufu bowed deeply. "Fellow Daoist Luo is currently in closed-door cultivation. I will send someone to invite her…"</p><p>"No need. Fellow Daoist Luo and I are old friends. As long as Temple Master Li can spare someone, I will personally go and invite her," Gui Hou waved his hand.</p><p>"Everything is progressing smoothly. We can manage."</p><p>Li Yufu gestured for Gui Hou to do as he pleased.</p><p>Gui Hou bid farewell to Li Yufu and shortly arrived at Luo Hou's cave dwelling. Seeing Luo Hou, he noticed the change in her aura. "Eh? You've broken through?"</p><p>"I benefited from the Wu Clan's incantations and had been on the verge of a breakthrough. Five years ago, it finally happened naturally!"</p><p>Luo Hou said gratefully.</p><p>Her cultivation journey had been quite bumpy.  Her physical body had been shattered, leaving only her spirit. After ascending to the Greater Thousand World, it took her a long time to regain a physical body, and since then, her cultivation had lagged behind Gui Hou's.</p><p>Fortunately, following Qin Sang, they didn't lack resources for cultivation, and later she gained opportunities, finally breaking through to the late stage of Nascent Soul, just one step away from the Void Refinement Stage.</p><p>Recalling the past, Gui Hou felt a pang of emotion.  The changes they had encountered in the past few hundred years were unimaginable before, and their mindsets had shifted multiple times.</p><p>From the initial despair of being captured, to the fear of Qin Sang and their forced compliance, to the temptation of the "Celestial Demon Chain Transformation", they now completely submitted to Qin Sang.</p><p>At least, for now, the outcome wasn't bad.  They had followed a worthy master.</p><p>It was because of the "Celestial Demon Chain Transformation" that Qin Sang had imparted to them that they dared to dream of reaching the Void Refinement Stage. Their future was bright.</p><p>"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Luo, on your advancement! With your assistance, my plan will be even more foolproof," Gui Hou said joyfully.</p><p>Upon learning of Gui Hou's intentions, Luo Hou didn't hesitate and immediately agreed.</p><p>That night, the two demon lords left Qingyang Temple. Gui Hou had made all the arrangements, and they crossed the East Sea directly.</p><p>Passing by the Black Lion Holy King's domain, the two demon lords paid him a visit to inspect the results of his training.</p><p>Finally, they bid farewell to the Black Lion Holy King and headed east.</p>
