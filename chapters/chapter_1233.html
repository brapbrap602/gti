<h1>Chapter 1225: An Attempt</h1><p>Chapter 1225: An Attempt</p><p>The Ancestor Sacred Fire's true form was restless, wildly unrestrained, arrogant, and imperious.  Qin Sang was experiencing its true power for the first time up close.  His closest previous encounter was during the refinement of the Gang Jade near the mountain peak. At that time, he only saw and felt a faint green shadow, a mere emanation of the Ancestor Sacred Fire.</p><p>Seeing the true form revealed its power to be far greater. Among the spirit flames Qin Sang had encountered, the Ancestor Sacred Fire ranked only below the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Compared to the true Ancestor Sacred Fire, the Winter Submersion Cold Flame was inferior.</p><p>Perhaps when the ancestor of the Qingyang Demon Sect first sealed it on Divine Gang Peak, the Ancestor Sacred Fire was roughly comparable to the Winter Submersion Cold Flame, as the ancestor's cultivation was similar to that of the Winter Submersion Master.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect ancestor was once a top expert in the small Cold Domain's cultivation world.</p><p>The Winter Submersion Master perished after failing to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>As the Ancestor Sacred Fire continuously absorbed Qingyang Gang Qi, accumulating over time, its power naturally grew, even undergoing changes in nature.</p><p>This is why the situation became irredeemable, and the Qingyang Demon Sect was helpless, even Xiang Qing couldn’t handle it.</p><p>The Winter Submersion Master was a figure of the past; the Winter Submersion Cold Flame was confined to the Demon Sea Island.  After emerging, it was taken by Old Demon Mu and lacked the constant supply of cold flames for consumption.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the Ancestor Sacred Fire, assessing its potential for subjugation.  An ownerless flame, originally Qingyang Demon Fire, inherently inferior to the Nine Nether Demon Fire, and restrained by the Gang Jade formation – it had a good chance.</p><p>"Worth a try."</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang replied, leaving room for uncertainty.</p><p>Xiang Qing was overjoyed. Qin Sang's words exceeded his expectations.</p><p>A dignified demon king wouldn't make empty promises.</p><p>No one could guarantee complete success in subduing the Ancestor Sacred Fire.</p><p>He and Bing Han had collected various secret techniques, attempting multiple times, narrowly escaping backlash, but unable to fully suppress the Ancestor Sacred Fire. They could only confine it to this place, let alone refine it.</p><p>Having witnessed the Ancestor Sacred Fire's true form, Qin Sang still dared to try, suggesting a certain degree of confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the jade platform, summoned twelve demon banners, planted them in the ground, and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Xiang Qing watched Qin Sang's movements with wide eyes.</p><p>He held a fire seal in his hand, ready to intervene if Qin Sang angered the Ancestor Sacred Fire and caused chaos. Bing Han stood beside him, flames swirling around her jade fingers, a faint, tiny fire talisman flickering into view.</p><p>With the formation set, Qin Sang touched his forehead, summoning his fire seed.</p><p>Composed of Nine Nether Demon Fire, it resembled a lotus seed, appearing ethereal and far from fully formed.</p><p>Xiang Qing and Bing Han sensed the lotus-seed fire seed's aura, identical to the demon fire within the banners. They were very curious about Qin Sang's fire control techniques.</p><p>However, the fire seed revealed nothing significant.</p><p>Ignoring them, Qin Sang focused on the Ancestor Sacred Fire, manipulating the demon fire in the banners, his divine sense guiding the fire seed slowly towards it.</p><p>Xiang Qing adjusted the Gang Jade formation to allow entry for the fire seed, working with Bing Han to suppress the Ancestor Sacred Fire.</p><p>Compared to the Ancestor Sacred Fire, the unformed fire seed was minuscule, like a candle to the sun. Fortunately, the other Nine Nether Demon Fires provided resistance to the Ancestor Sacred Fire’s assault.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, carefully controlling the fire seed's approach.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire exerted a hierarchical suppression on the Ancestor Sacred Fire, but the effect seemed counterproductive; the Ancestor Sacred Fire swayed more violently, its aura growing more agitated.</p><p>The three felt a tightening in their chests.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly withdrew the fire seed, waiting for the Ancestor Sacred Fire to stabilize before further attempts, ordering the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to observe the subtlest changes.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>The three stood motionless like statues.</p><p>Through their close coordination, the fire seed drew closer to the Ancestor Sacred Fire.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang halted its advance, closing his eyes and fully activating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique, gently casting numerous restrictions.</p><p>Soon, Xiang Qing discovered with surprise that the deep green Ancestor Sacred Fire seemed attracted to the fire seed, developing a protrusion. A wisp of the Ancestor Sacred Fire touched the fire seed, seemingly being absorbed.</p><p>A sudden change!</p><p>The wisp vibrated violently, causing the main body to show signs of eruption, impacting the formation.</p><p>The three were startled.</p><p>Thanks to their coordination, Xiang Qing and Bing Han activated the formation, while Qin Sang quickly withdrew the fire seed, avoiding the impact.</p><p>After the Ancestral Sacred Flame calmed down, the tension on the three cultivators' faces finally eased.</p><p>"Truly, there are wonders in the world.  Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your secret technique actually can directly refine an unclaimed spiritual flame.  By weakening the Ancestral Sacred Flame bit by bit, and then Fellow Daoist Xiang suppressing it, it will surely be much easier. Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Xiang, on finally being able to resolve your sect's hidden danger!"</p><p>Bing Han first praised the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique, then congratulated Xiang Qing.</p><p>Xiang Qing was overjoyed.</p><p>Although the first attempt had failed, various signs indicated that Qin Sang's method might succeed.</p><p>"During this time, I've troubled Fellow Daoist Mingyue greatly!"</p><p>Xiang Qing bowed to Qin Sang, then took out a jade slip.  "This secret technique is used to refine the Azure Sun Demon Fire. It will help you refine the Ancestral Sacred Flame; please study it. However, it is one of the core secrets of our sect's fundamental methods, a matter of great importance. I hope you understand and will first make an oath not to pass it on to others."</p><p>"Refining the essence…is this the secret technique your sect uses to refine the fire seed?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he asked.</p><p>Xiang Qing nodded. "That's right. Our sect has passed down the fire seed for generations, not by directly absorbing it. Each cultivator's cultivated Azure Sun Demon Fire bears their unique mark; the spiritual flame and the cultivator grow together, already becoming one. The Ancestral Sacred Flame's energy is far more chaotic and mixed. If you use this secret technique to first refine the Ancestral Sacred Flame, it will lessen the flame's resistance and significantly increase your chances of success.  There's another benefit: directly absorbing another's spiritual flame allows for a rapid increase in strength, but leaves hidden dangers. Refining the spiritual flame with this secret technique leaves only the purest spiritual flame energy. Refining this into your body won't bring immediate significant benefits, but allows for gradual improvement, greatly reducing the chance of future backlash."</p><p>This matter concerns the survival of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. The greater Qin Sang's chance of success, the greater the hope of suppressing the Ancestral Sacred Flame. This not only solves the sect's hidden danger, but Xiang Qing can also increase his own strength by refining the Ancestral Sacred Flame afterward.</p><p>This was a win-win-win situation; Xiang Qing naturally wouldn't be stingy with the secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang made an oath, eagerly took the jade slip, and quickly scanned its contents with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Hearing Xiang Qing explain the technique's function, Qin Sang, while reviewing the jade slip, recalled some ideas he'd had while cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p>
