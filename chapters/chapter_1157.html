<h1>Chapter 1149: The Mountain Guardian Spirit Beast</h1><p>Having secured the treasure, Qin Sang had no desire to continue entangling with the Demon King Qianji. His priority now was to find a safe place to refine the residual power of the Azure Phoenix within his body. Additionally, Qin Sang was deeply concerned about the Celestial Eye Butterfly. He needed to observe it carefully to determine if there were any adverse effects from devouring the heavenly tribulation lightning—an unprecedented act that could potentially harm the butterfly.</p><p>After flying over several mountain ranges, Qin Sang suddenly changed direction and swiftly descended.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>A panicked scream echoed from the depths of the abyss as a figure frantically tried to flee, only to be caught by the back of its neck by Qin Sang.</p><p>It was the Falcon Demon!</p><p>The Falcon Demon was shocked and attempted to struggle, but Qin Sang slapped it on the head, rendering it docile. Before his breakthrough, Qin Sang could have easily captured the Falcon Demon without breaking a sweat, and now it was even easier.</p><p>"Stay still! You’ve got quite the nerve, following me here!" Qin Sang teased.</p><p>He had initially released the Falcon Demon, planning to deal with it later when he had more time. However, instead of fleeing, the demon had secretly followed him to observe the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s tribulation. The Falcon Demon’s stealth and disguise skills were impressive, but it was no match for the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s heightened senses. Qin Sang had already noticed the Falcon Demon’s presence and, with his newfound strength, decided to capture it and take it along.</p><p>The Falcon Demon, now subdued, hung its head in defeat, lamenting its misfortune. With the treasures left by its mother, the Falcon Demon had roamed freely, causing trouble everywhere and even hiding in the Ten Thousand Serpents Abyss for years without being caught. Yet, it had now been captured twice by Qin Sang. The Falcon Demon realized that Qin Sang must possess extraordinary methods to easily see through its disguises, and it was thoroughly convinced.</p><p>"Big brother, I was wrong! Please spare my life! I’ll never forget your mercy! I only followed because I saw you being chased by Demon King Qianji and wanted to see if I could help…" the Falcon Demon pleaded, trying to curry favor with Qin Sang.</p><p>"Hmph, you were just waiting for an opportunity to scavenge, weren’t you?" Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>This little demon, despite being at the mid-stage of demon core cultivation, was slick-tongued and lacked the dignity of a true demon. The Falcon Demon fell silent, still held by Qin Sang, and it couldn’t help but sense the alluring aura within Qin Sang’s body, its eyes darting around.</p><p>As the tribulation clouds dissipated, the stars and moon reappeared in the night sky. Two streaks of light chased each other through the air, leaving the Demon Concubine and the others far behind. Demon King Qianji pursued with all his might, but the thief’s escape technique was even more refined than his own, and the distance between them grew until he had no choice but to give up. He could only watch helplessly as the thief escaped with both the mysterious stone slab and the four-transformation spirit insect.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Demon King Qianji smashed a boulder in frustration, venting his anger.</p><p>After flying a great distance and confirming that Demon King Qianji had been shaken off, Qin Sang found a desolate mountain and carved out a temporary cave dwelling. Bai stood guard outside while Qin Sang tossed the Falcon Demon aside and prepared to continue refining the Azure Phoenix’s power.</p><p>The Falcon Demon hesitated for a long time before finally succumbing to temptation and pleading, "Master! Grandfather! You’re clearly a kind-hearted person. When you were in the demon nest, I played a part in helping you find that stone slab. For that, could you let me absorb just a little bit of the energy within it? Just a tiny bit!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes. "Absorb what?"</p><p>The Falcon Demon eagerly replied, "The mysterious aura sealed within the stone slab. I can sense it would be immensely beneficial to me, which is why I’ve been hiding in the Ten Thousand Serpents Abyss for so many years. If I can fuse with it, I might even advance to the late stage."</p><p>Qin Sang gave the Falcon Demon a curious look. "So you were also drawn to the stone slab and snuck into the Demon King’s treasury? You’re a Thunder-Swallowing Falcon, with no Azure Phoenix bloodline. Aren’t you afraid that recklessly fusing with the Azure Phoenix’s essence blood will harm your foundation?"</p><p>"Azure Phoenix’s essence blood?" The Falcon Demon was stunned and shook its head repeatedly. "I wouldn’t dare directly fuse with the essence blood. It’s the thunder power mixed within that energy. It’s incredibly unique and might help improve my innate potential."</p><p>So it coveted the thunder power within the Azure Phoenix’s essence blood. Qin Sang nodded inwardly. The Thunder-Swallowing Falcon naturally possessed thunder-controlling abilities, so its perception was likely accurate. It seemed the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s ability to devour heavenly thunder was also related to the unique thunder power within the Azure Phoenix’s true blood. He wondered about its origins.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang couldn’t fuse with it himself. He could only channel the Azure Phoenix’s essence blood into his wings to further refine his Phoenix Wings, at most gaining a thunder-escape technique. Refining the Phoenix Wings primarily relied on the Azure Phoenix’s essence blood, and much of the thunder power would dissipate. Sharing some with the Falcon Demon wouldn’t cause him any significant loss.</p><p>"This thunder power isn’t particularly useful to me. But you must hold a grudge against me. Why would I give it to you and potentially create a future enemy?" Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>The Falcon Demon forced a smile. "I’ve already submitted to you. How could I dare oppose you? I’m willing to swear a demonic oath."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, unconvinced. "I only trust those who are truly loyal to me."</p><p>The Falcon Demon chuckled awkwardly. "Loyal to you? You don’t mean…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He was in need of a mount—one that would willingly submit to him. The White Crane was intelligent but overly lustful, which could lead to trouble. Qin Sang had taken it in as a temporary measure. Its talents were far inferior to the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon’s. The Falcon Demon was a descendant of a transformed great demon, and after fusing with the Azure Phoenix’s thunder power, its potential would be limitless.</p><p>"Dream on! Never!" The Falcon Demon was furious, feeling humiliated.</p><p>It wasn’t some mindless beast. How could it willingly become someone’s mount?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised. The Two-Headed Python was a lesson from the past—convincing a spirit beast to willingly submit wasn’t easy. He said nothing more, ignoring the Falcon Demon and closing his eyes to continue refining the Azure Phoenix’s power.</p><p>The Falcon Demon was dumbfounded.</p><p>Shouldn’t they be negotiating further?</p><p>It scratched its head in frustration, its desire for the Azure Phoenix’s thunder power overwhelming. It couldn’t help but say, "How about this? For a hundred years, I’ll serve as your mountain guardian spirit beast at your cave. How’s that?"</p><p>"Your life is already in my hands. If you don’t obey, I can pluck your feathers and stew you. Why bother with such a deal?" Qin Sang replied nonchalantly.</p><p>The Falcon Demon stiffened, then suddenly grew bold, angrily retorting, "If you dare harm a single feather, my mother won’t let you off! She’s also at the transformed stage and excels in thunder-escape techniques. You may have escaped Demon King Qianji, but you won’t survive against my mother."</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone turned mocking. "I didn’t expect someone like you to be the descendant of a transformed great demon. May I ask which Demon King your esteemed mother is?"</p><p>"My mother lives in seclusion in the Boundless Valley and isn’t a Demon King. She’s left a hidden mark on me. If you don’t believe me, go ahead and try something. I’ve come and gone freely in the Demon King’s lair—do you think I have no backing?" the Falcon Demon boasted.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>From the Boundless Valley? So it was that fat bird.</p><p>The little demon wasn’t lying—it did have a transformed Thunder-Swallowing Falcon backing it. Qin Sang had once witnessed the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon’s prowess from a distance, holding its own against two Nascent Soul cultivators. Even after forming his own Nascent Soul, Qin Sang wasn’t confident he could defeat it.</p>
