<h1>Chapter 2114: Armies Converge</h1><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang spoke evasively, revealing very little information. Qin Sang couldn't speculate on what kind of power Ziyun Mountain truly possessed. However, for Patriarch Yuanxiang to be so cautious, Ziyun Mountain was at least no weaker than the Zhuyan Clan.</p><p>According to Patriarch Yuanxiang, Liuli's master was a Daoist adept, and Ziyun Mountain was most likely a Daoist sect as well.</p><p>"Could it be related to the Dao Court?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts weren't unfounded. Both the Storm Realm and the Talisman Realm had ascended from the River of Calamity to the Great Thousand World and both harbored great secrets. These similarities made it difficult not to connect them.</p><p>The Dao Court, upon ascending to the Great Thousand World, had secluded itself from the world and remained largely unknown. Could it be, like the Storm Realm, that it had also landed near the Sea of Mists?</p><p>These were merely Qin Sang's conjectures, without evidence. Judging from Patriarch Yuanxiang's tone, Liuli's master seemed more like a descendant of the Cauldron Sect.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experiences since entering the Great Thousand World, there were no rumors of a public rift between the Cauldron Sect and the Talisman Sect within the Daoist community. The discord between the two sects was mostly inferred by outsiders based on their differing cultivation philosophies.</p><p>As fellow Daoists, what was the Cauldron Sect's attitude towards the descendants of the Dao Court?</p><p>The Storm Realm was originally under the guardianship of that person, but now it had become Qin Sang's domain. He had to carefully consider what identity he would use to face Liuli's master in the future.</p><p>His most legitimate and impressive identity was undoubtedly that of a Dao Court Immortal Official, a Third Rank Lord of the Five Thunders Court!</p><p>Back then, the First Sword Attendant had arranged for True Monarch Zhang to bestow this title upon him, intending for him to use it to intimidate others in times of crisis.</p><p>Although the Dao Court's strength had greatly diminished and it had remained in seclusion, outsiders were unaware of the Dao Court's true situation. In their eyes, the Talisman Sect was still on equal footing with the Cauldron Sect, one of the most powerful forces in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>To harm a Third Rank Immortal Official, one would have to consider the Talisman Sect's reaction.</p><p>Nowadays, the Great Zhou human race and the Eight Great Celestial Continents implemented the Merit System in the Gan Continent, which was similar to the Divine Court System of the Dao Court, and in some aspects, even surpassed it.</p><p>Times had changed, and the Great Thousand World no longer held as much prejudice against the Dao Court.</p><p>Before coming to the Sea of Mists, Qin Sang had considered revealing this identity if necessary.</p><p>While he was pondering, a familiar aura approached from afar. It was Yuan Miao.</p><p>Yuan Miao descended, seeing that the atmosphere between the Patriarch and Qin Sang wasn't tense, his expression relaxed slightly. He cupped his hands and said frankly, "I received your talisman some time ago.  The Siyou Clan happened to send an envoy, so I intended to investigate the situation before replying to you."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the gesture. "Fellow Daoist Yuan, you've gone to great lengths. Patriarch Yuanxiang has already explained the situation to me. This time, it was my recklessness that caused this grave mistake. We must bear the consequences ourselves and dare not implicate innocent people, much less allow Patriarch Yuanxiang to break the rules and damage the Zhuyan Clan's reputation for our sake."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's determination to confront the Siyou Clan, Yuan Miao was taken aback and looked at Patriarch Yuanxiang.</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang narrowed his drunken eyes, scrutinized Qin Sang carefully, stroked his long beard, and said, "You are indeed responsible."</p><p>Qin Sang humbly replied, "The enemy is strong and we are weak. I am not one to act rashly. I have an impolite request, a bold plea. I wonder if Patriarch Yuanxiang, for the sake of that person, could offer some assistance."</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang took a sip of wine and said noncommittally, "Tell me about it."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly, "If the Siyou Clan hasn't sent many experts this time, we can still manage.  Also, could Patriarch Yuanxiang delay the Siyou Clan's main force for at least three months?"</p><p>"Three months? That's not difficult! As for the strength of the Siyou Clan's envoy, the ancient covenant has its stipulations. As long as they don't threaten my clan, I can't go too far."</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang stood up from the branch, his eyes flashing with a sharp light. "Are you truly confident that you don't need to avoid their edge?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and he cupped his hands. "I am willing to give it a try!"</p><p>After learning these hidden details, the significance of this battle had changed.  It was not only about driving away the enemy, but also about proving to Liuli's master that he had the strength to protect and claim the Storm Realm as his domain!</p><p>"Good! You have courage! I shall wait and see!"</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang tapped the void with his wooden staff, clouds formed beneath his feet, and he rode the clouds away.</p><p>Yuan Miao didn't leave with the Patriarch.  He said regretfully, "In this time of crisis, it's not appropriate to spar with you, lest it distract you. If you have any other needs, feel free to ask. I can't directly intervene, but I can still help with some small matters, which wouldn't be considered breaking the rules."</p><p>"Once the enemy is driven away, I will definitely have a good fight with you!"</p><p>Qin Sang appreciated the sentiment and readily promised.  Then, without hesitation, he requested some spiritual materials needed for the battle.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded repeatedly, noting down each item.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang remembered something. "Fellow Daoist Yuan, you don't need to persuade the Changyou Clan anymore. Patriarch Min Zhuo is determined to go his own way.  He must have received a promise from the Siyou Clan and won't turn back."</p><p>Perhaps it was the Changyou Clan who leaked the information and led the Siyou Clan here, but there was no point in investigating now.</p><p>Yuan Miao sighed. "The Changyou Clan and the Siyou Clan both have grievances with you, so it's natural for them to join forces.  It's not appropriate for us to intervene, both emotionally and logically. I hope you can understand."</p><p>After their conversation, Yuan Miao also bid farewell to Qin Sang.</p><p>After seeing Yuan Miao off, Qin Sang thought for a moment, then headed alone towards the North Sea. Soon after, he entered the Hidden Sun Realm and arrived at the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>The North Sea branch was overseen by Su Nu, and Tong Lingyu, the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace, was assisting her.</p><p>Qin Sang flew across half of the Hidden Sun Realm, the Listening Snow Pavilion appearing in the distance.</p><p>The terrain near the Listening Snow Pavilion hadn't changed much since the ascension. The peaks were covered in snow, and the air was frigid.</p><p>The Listening Snow Pavilion's formation emitted white mist, concealing the mountain gate, but it couldn't block Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>He hadn't stayed long at the Listening Snow Pavilion, but his memories were vivid. The scenes from the wedding ceremony were still fresh in his mind.</p><p>It was a sham marriage, yet it was the only wedding he had ever had. Now, the lines between truth and falsehood were blurred.</p><p>He revealed himself at the mountain gate, immediately alerting the cultivators of the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Listening Snow Pavilion was still Shi Xue. She was constructing an altar when she received the message and hurriedly welcomed Qin Sang into the main hall.</p><p>"Brother-in-law is here!"</p><p>Shi Xue's pretty face was beaming; she didn't treat Qin Sang as a Void Refinement expert at all.</p><p>She had heard quite a few rumors from the Hidden Moon Convent.</p><p>Grandmaster Yun Xin was mature and prudent and probably wouldn't spread rumors about her junior sister.</p><p>Perhaps these two had already turned the sham into reality, but they were both stubborn and hadn't made it public.</p><p>Feelings couldn't be faked.  Over the years, her junior sister had cared more for the Green Goat Temple than for the Xuan Tian Palace or the Hidden Moon Convent, treating Li Yufu and the others as her own.</p><p>More than once, when no one was around, she had seen her junior sister's lonely figure. Finally, the clouds had parted and the moon had appeared, and she was happy for them.</p><p>"Brother-in-law, please have a seat. This is the spiritual wine you two drank at your wedding.  Try it, does it still taste the same?" Shi Xue personally picked up the wine pot and poured Qin Sang a cup.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the cup and truly savored it, but didn't comment. He put down the jade cup and said, "According to convention, the Tainted Lands' tide should recede within the next few years."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang getting down to business, Shi Xue's smile faded.</p><p>She guessed what he really wanted to say, and said with a serious expression, "Junior sister said it herself before she left, that she would return before the tide recedes."</p><p>Qin Sang calculated that it had been more than seventy years since he returned to the Storm Realm.</p><p>The interval between each receding of the tainted qi was about a hundred years, but it could vary by a few years.</p><p>If it was earlier, the tide might recede by the end of this year. To be safe, Liuli should return this year.</p><p>Knowing that Liuli had a powerful master behind her, Qin Sang was no longer worried about her safety and was genuinely happy for her that she had obtained such an opportunity.</p><p>The Siyou Clan probably wouldn't wait for Liuli to return, and Qin Sang wanted to resolve this matter and welcome her back before she returned.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, "Did Liuli change her cultivation method after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Shi Xue shook her head. "Junior sister's Ice Soul Divine Light is already incredibly refined, and she has achieved numerous feats with it. Why does brother-in-law ask?"</p><p>"I've obtained quite a few treasures recently, some of which might be helpful to Liuli."</p><p>Qin Sang offered a casual explanation, thinking to himself that Liuli's master hadn't made her change her cultivation method.  He wondered if Liuli was unwilling to change sects, or if her master was also a powerful cultivator of the ice path.</p><p>There must be a reason why Liuli was valued by her master, although her own talent was also exceptional.</p><p>"Brother-in-law is thoughtful.  Junior sister's hard work wasn't in vain," Shi Xue said with satisfaction.</p><p>Qin Sang talked with Shi Xue for a while longer but didn't get any useful information.  He didn't expect Liuli to be so secretive. Shi Xue had been with her day and night, yet hadn't noticed anything unusual.</p><p>...Zhuyan Clan.</p><p>In front of the Teleportation Hall.</p><p>The atmosphere was heavy, filled with a chilling aura.</p><p>Countless elite Zhuyan Clan warriors, fully armored, were arrayed in formation in front of the hall, their killing intent soaring.</p><p>Countless gazes were fixed on the Teleportation Hall, the interior eerily silent.</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura appeared within everyone's perception.  This aura didn't belong to a single person but was the combined aura of an unknown number of individuals.</p><p>Achieving such seamless unity wasn't easy. They must be battle-hardened elites.</p><p>Sensing this aura, the Zhuyan Clan soldiers' eyes lit up, as if they had encountered a worthy opponent. Their fighting spirit was ignited, and without needing orders, everyone's aura erupted like a tsunami, pressing towards the Teleportation Hall.</p><p>*Boom!* Invisible shockwaves exploded in the void. Fortunately, the hall was sturdy enough and remained unmoved.</p><p>Those inside were about to step out of the hall, but abruptly halted. The number of people the formation could teleport each time was limited, and the newcomers were certainly outnumbered by the Zhuyan Clan soldiers. Their momentum faltered, like a candle in the wind, almost extinguished, but ultimately condensed into a single point, stubbornly refusing to be snuffed out.</p><p>Then, they stirred, as if preparing to counterattack.</p><p>At this moment, someone walked out of the hall. This person had white hair and a youthful face, with a Daoist air.  A single round bead rested between his eyebrows, within which wind and clouds shifted, giving him a mysterious air.  He stood at the center of the colliding auras, strolling leisurely, completely unaffected.</p><p>He stopped at the entrance of the hall, his hands clasped behind his back. His gaze swept over the Zhuyan Clan soldiers, then looked up at the sky.</p><p>His gaze was sharp as a sword, as if piercing through the clouds and seeing the heavens above. He praised loudly, "As expected of the Zhuyan Clan's elite, truly impressive!"</p><p>Although his identity was unknown, his demeanor revealed him to be a supreme expert.  Praised by this person, the Zhuyan Clan soldiers puffed out their chests.  At this moment, a streak of light descended from the sky, and Yuan Miao appeared, cupping his hands towards the man. "Are you the Grand Offering of the Hanjiang Lu Family? I am Yuan Miao."</p><p>"Indeed, I am!"</p><p>The Grand Offering didn't underestimate Yuan Miao due to his cultivation. He returned the gesture. "This time, we are here to punish the rebels. King Lu is personally leading the expedition, and the Si Emperor has also sent his Grand Tutor to assist, appointing me as the vanguard.  I apologize for disturbing your sacred grounds."</p><p>"Grand Tutor?"</p><p>Yuan Miao's heart skipped a beat.  He hadn't expected the Si Emperor to send his Grand Tutor.</p><p>The Grand Tutor was the Si Emperor's right-hand man, renowned and powerful, his cultivation no weaker than this Grand Offering.</p><p>In other words, the Siyou Clan had sent at least two late-stage experts, with an unknown number of mid and early-stage cultivators.</p><p>Worried for Qin Sang, Yuan Miao maintained a calm expression.  "Previously, my clan made an agreement with your envoy. I hope you will abide by the rules. I will personally oversee this."</p><p>"As it should be!"</p><p>The Grand Offering spoke amicably. After the negotiations, he ordered the vanguard to exit the hall.</p><p>The vanguard were the elite of the elite, but facing the watchful eyes of the Zhuyan Clan soldiers, they felt immense pressure, cautiously passing through the ranks and forming their own formation outside the mountain to wait.</p><p>Following that, the great teleportation formation was activated again, and troops continued to teleport in, wave after wave.</p><p>The area outside the mountain quickly became a sea of black, banners fluttering, gradually rivaling the Zhuyan Clan's forces.  However, the Grand Offering strictly forbade them from clashing with the Zhuyan Clan, so they could only suppress their own auras and endure the pressure from the other side.</p><p>It was impossible to count how many elites the Siyou Clan had sent. Suddenly, a palanquin emerged from the hall, its gauze curtains concealing a throne within, a shadowy figure barely visible.  Beside the throne sat another person, their aura hidden.</p><p>"Reporting to King Lu! This is Fellow Daoist Yuan Miao," the Grand Offering stepped forward, bowing and introducing Yuan Miao.</p><p>"Thank you, Envoy Yuan," King Lu's voice was gentle, not as imposing as imagined.</p><p>The palanquin flew to the front of the army and waited.</p><p>Next, more groups of Siyou Clan elites emerged from the hall, Yuan Miao's brow furrowing, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p>Just then, a golden light descended from the sky, dazzlingly bright, illuminating the darkness.</p><p>The Grand Offering's expression changed slightly, his fingers trembling faintly, but he didn't move, allowing the golden light to land before him. It was a treasured staff, blocking the entrance to the hall.</p><p>Inside the hall, a Void Realm Second Stage expert was about to step out when his face paled with shock, a chill running down his spine.</p><p>"Enough! The rest of you, please return," an ethereal voice came from the sky.</p><p>The Grand Offering's eyes flickered. He recognized the owner of the staff.  The number of troops was about to exceed the agreement, but he hadn't stopped them.  This was a test, but he hadn't expected it to truly alarm Patriarch Yuanxiang.</p><p>"You all go back. Tell the others behind you that they don't need to come anymore," the Grand Offering waved his hand.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Those inside the hall didn't dare to argue and retreated dejectedly.</p><p>On a distant mountain peak.</p><p>The scenery was picturesque and breathtaking.</p><p>Two figures were playing Go in a pavilion. One wore white robes and had golden pupils, his appearance dignified.</p><p>Opposite him was a young man, seemingly facing a difficult problem, staring at the board, deep in thought. Behind him stood another person, also lost in thought, his features nine parts similar to the young man's. They appeared to be brothers.</p><p>At this moment, the young man playing Go felt something and turned to look beyond the mountain, surprised. "Uncle was right after all. Patriarch Yuanxiang has indeed taken action!"</p>
