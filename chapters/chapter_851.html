<h1>Chapter 843: A Final Gamble</h1><p>Chapter 843: A Final Gamble</p><p>The cultivator didn't probe Qin Sang's background, instead showing interest in the depths of the Demon Sea. Qin Sang readily engaged in conversation, not acting superior despite his higher cultivation, answering all questions.</p><p>Soon, the two became acquainted.</p><p>As they spoke, they landed at a harbor on a smaller island's shore.</p><p>As soon as their flight ceased, Qin Sang felt a surge of caution.  Several divine senses swept over him – all from Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Unsure of their intentions, Qin Sang followed the cultivator into the city, but saw no one appear.</p><p>The cultivator seemed used to this, swiftly entering the city and heading towards a large hall.</p><p>Approaching the hall, the cultivator hesitated, whispering, “Friend, you should know that Da Huang Island now forbids anyone from returning to the Cang Lang Sea.  Especially someone of your cultivation; you could play a significant role in defending the island, so it's impossible to let you go easily. All cultivators must obey Da Huang Island's orders. Don't even think about returning to the Cang Lang Sea for now. Consider how you'll survive the upcoming conflict…”</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and wasn't surprised; he only blamed himself for being too late.</p><p>Guards guided Qin Sang into the hall where he saw a middle-aged man in armor, his expression stern.</p><p>The man's cultivation was at a shockingly advanced Foundation Establishment stage. Qin Sang didn't dare to be negligent, bowing respectfully, and introducing himself:  “My Daoist name is Qingfeng, I’m a steward of the Qiongyu Trading House of the East Pole Alliance. I greet you, General.”</p><p>With Xiang Yi dead and his tracks erased by the beast tide, Qin Sang had no further concerns and decided to continue acting as Daoist Qingfeng, contacting the Qiongyu Trading House.</p><p>Finding the Mao Shan vine and using the teleportation array to return to the Cang Lang Sea were impossible for a lone cultivator. Through the Qiongyu Trading House, there might be a way.</p><p>Furthermore, in this situation, everyone had to obey orders. Without backing, one might be assigned the most arduous tasks.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's explanation, the general nodded slightly.</p><p>He had already received a report and knew Qin Sang's intentions. He mused, “Daoist, as a high-cultivation expert of the East Pole Alliance, you must understand the urgency of the situation. Without orders from Da Huang Island, I dare not allow you to leave directly. Why don't you stay on this island for a while?  We happen to be short of a few patrol team leaders…”</p><p>“I shall obey your orders, General.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted calmly, then added, “However, I have urgent matters to attend to and dare not delay. Could the General possibly help me contact the Trading House? Once I've reported back, I can focus on my tasks.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's compliance, the general's expression softened, readily agreeing to his request.</p><p>The general then gave Qin Sang some instructions, summoned a guard to escort him to his quarters, and Qin Sang remained on this smaller island.</p><p>He had undertaken island defense duties many times, and was quite familiar with them, performing his duties diligently.</p><p>Over a month passed. To his surprise, the Qiongyu Trading House hadn't contacted him.</p><p>“Could something have happened to Old Man Zou?”</p><p>Qin Sang worried silently, doing his best to make connections and find a solution himself.</p><p>Finally, two months after his arrival, he saw Old Man Zou.</p><p>“Daoist, why did it take you so long to return! I thought you'd perished in the Seven Killing Hall. I grieved for a long time and regretted not stopping you from going to that dangerous place!”</p><p>Old Man Zou was overjoyed to see Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and explained, “Old Man Zou, you don't know. I truly faced great hardship in the Seven Killing Hall, nearly losing my life. I escaped with grievous injuries, not daring to burden the Trading House, and spent years seeking a place to heal.  Only recently have I recovered, and my cultivation has stagnated. After my seclusion, I planned to contact you in the Demon Sea, only to encounter this upheaval…”</p><p>After leaving the Seven Killing Hall, he focused primarily on the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* and *Seed Yuan Devil Embryo* techniques, neglecting his cultivation.  His travels and various affairs also slowed his progress.</p><p>Old Man Zou saw that Qin Sang’s cultivation had indeed progressed little, as he said, and didn't probe further.</p><p>After all, although Qin Sang had joined the Qiongyu Trading House, he was a solitary cultivator with few friends in the House; being cautious after being injured was perfectly normal.</p><p>When Old Man Zou inquired about Qin Sang's experience in the Seven Killing Hall, Qin Sang offered his prepared explanation.</p><p>“We entered a place called the Purple Mist Wasteland with Daoist Xiang Yi.  Poisonous mist filled the area. Daoist Xiang Yi possessed a treasure to counteract the poison, but it unfortunately disturbed the凶兽 within, causing everyone to scatter. I luckily escaped the beast’s pursuit and fled the wasteland, but was afflicted by a powerful poison, severely weakening my strength and leading to further troubles…”</p><p>Madam Liu had already investigated beforehand.</p><p>Xiang Yi couldn't have proactively revealed his despicable actions. After leaving the Seven Killing Hall, he had given a similar account to others; Qin Sang's story aligned perfectly.</p><p>Eight people entered the Seven Killing Hall, only Xiang Yi emerged alive. But the Seven Killing Hall was infamous for its brutality. Even if people had suspicions, they couldn't question Xiang Yi about it.</p><p>While Qin Sang recounted his experiences, Old Man Zou listened with rapt attention, showing no sign of wanting to stop.  Qin Sang, therefore, continued, weaving a tale of truth and fiction, bravely pressing on.</p><p>Old Man Zou would exclaim in wonder or sigh in contemplation. Suddenly, he bowed to Qin Sang, saying, "Purple Mist Wasteland, Sky Tower, Flower Fairy Lake… the Seven Killing Temple truly lives up to its reputation.  The places you've been, my dear brother, are all fraught with peril and fear.  I admire your ability to escape these dens of danger! I have a humble request, I wonder if you would be willing to help me?"</p><p>Qin Sang, who also had a request of Old Man Zou, said solemnly, "Please speak freely, Old Man Zou.  As long as it's within my power, I will do my utmost."</p><p>Old Man Zou's eyes lit up, and he exclaimed happily, "My brother wishes you to draw a detailed map!"</p><p>"The places I've been are only a small part of the Seven Killing Temple, Old Man Zou.  If you need it, I have no objection."</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang looked at Old Man Zou in surprise, "You want a map?  Are you planning to enter the Seven Killing Temple?"</p><p>Old Man Zou sighed and spread his hands, "My dear brother, look at my cultivation.  How many years has it been stagnant? After realizing that the immortal path was closed to me, I dedicated all my energy to the merchant guild, toiling in the Demon Sea for many years.  But this recent catastrophe destroyed all my achievements, turning them into mere illusions. I had resigned myself to fate, but upon hearing news of you, my dear brother, I've been overjoyed and my heart reignited with hope. Before my life ends, I want to make one last attempt at the Seven Killing Temple! I hear that the Witch Tribe will reopen the Seven Killing Temple in forty years. Time is running out. You've personally been inside the Seven Killing Temple, so your experience is crucial to me.  If I learn anything else, I’ll need your help in verifying it, my brother.”</p><p>I remember our first meeting on the Witch God Continent. His aura hasn't changed much.  I never expected Old Man Zou, so dedicated to commerce, to have such a change of heart and return to the Dao.</p><p>This Demon Sea catastrophe has altered the fates of many.</p>
