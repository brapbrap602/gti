<h1>Chapter 1232: The Little Figure</h1><p>The Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>The Blood Lake manifested its exterior.</p><p>Towering waves surged.</p><p>The Old Demon Ye sat cross-legged above the Blood Lake, with Jiang Chenzi and two others holding treasure banners, encircling him.</p><p>The surrounding air was thick with blood qi, and shadowy figures flickered in and out of view.</p><p>To enter the Blood Lake, nearly half of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the Sin Abyss had gathered, while the rest remained on the Celestial March Plateau to guard against any surprises. The Nascent Soul cultivators stood scattered in the void, appearing disorganized, but in truth, their positions aligned with a grand formation, aiding the Old Demon Ye in breaking the Blood Lake's seal.</p><p>Every time the Old Demon Ye changed his hand seals, Jiang Chenzi and the other two would adjust their formation accordingly. The three treasure banners swayed, sending streams of multicolored light toward the Blood Lake, targeting the weak points of the seal.</p><p>Each strike caused the seal to tremble, growing more violent with every impact, shaking the entire space.</p><p>"Old Demon Ye has gone to great lengths to finally uncover the flaws in the seal. It's a pity the Abyssal Ruins' seal remains intact. If we had entered the Blood Prison from the Boundless Valley, it would have been much easier," Jiang Chenzi remarked during a brief respite.</p><p>Behind him, a handsome young man dressed in white robes, also a Nascent Soul cultivator from the same sect, smiled faintly and said, "If we had opened a breach from the Boundless Valley to enter the Blood Prison, what if we couldn't find a way out from this end? Aren't you afraid, Uncle, that the True One Daoist might trap us inside?"</p><p>This young man was actually a junior of Jiang Chenzi, from the same sect, and also a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>In recent centuries, it had become increasingly common for major sects in the Sin Abyss to produce two or even three Nascent Soul cultivators within a single generation.</p><p>The current generation of cultivators in the Sin Abyss had been exceptionally talented, with the number of Nascent Soul cultivators far surpassing previous eras. As a result, the Sin Abyss' strength had grown significantly, enabling them to resist the alliance of the two realms and even spare resources to conquer the desert.</p><p>Before the white-robed youth could finish speaking, the Blood Lake suddenly began to tremble abnormally.</p><p>At that moment, no streams of light shot out from the treasure banners.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A massive wave surged into the sky, causing the barrier formed by the seal to bulge outward.</p><p>The Old Demon Ye abruptly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within them. He pressed his hand downward, blocking the impact, and snorted coldly, "That Moonlight Demon King has indeed leaked the news about the Blood Prison. Our plans have been exposed. It seems they want to lend us a hand and open the seal ahead of time."</p><p>"Does the True One Daoist, who can't even protect his own home, really think he can gain any advantage in front of Old Demon Ye?" Jiang Chenzi asked in surprise.</p><p>"It might not be the True One Daoist. Most likely, it's Tongyou. The Boundless Valley is nominally under the control of the Frost Domain. The True One Daoist doesn't seem like a man of leisure; he's spent his entire life working for the Celestial March Alliance. He wouldn't dare leave his post without permission, lest we use a diversion to break through the defenses of Tianxing City in one fell swoop. After the Red-Haired Old Ghost perished, the Frost Domain isn't hard to deal with. The only question is whether the Feather King will interfere," another cultivator surnamed Ma interjected, accurately guessing the plans of the two-realm alliance.</p><p>His assessment of the True One Daoist was also spot-on.</p><p>After being elected as the leader of the Celestial March Alliance, the True One Daoist had been fair in rewards and punishments, promoting the younger generation. He could truly be described as someone who "devoted himself entirely to his duty until his dying breath."</p><p>The Celestial March Alliance was a coalition of many forces. The reason it had become a united front against external threats was not only due to external pressures but also largely thanks to the True One Daoist.</p><p>Such selfless individuals were not uncommon in the cultivation world, but most of them acted out of gratitude for their nurturing sects.</p><p>"Heh, perhaps the True One Daoist is setting up a ruse, making us think they're trying to enter the Blood Prison to compete with us, while in reality, they're secretly gathering forces to launch a counterattack while our frontlines are empty. The gains we made in the past might be lost in a single day," a voice emerged from the blood mist, its tone calm despite the dire implications.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi laughed heartily, "Even if they do break through, they'll have to get past Senior Canghong, who's guarding the frontlines. If the True One Daoist does manage to break in, we'll make sure they taste the bitterness of overconfidence when we return!"</p><p>"Enough idle talk. Since the friends from the two-realm alliance are willing to lend us a hand, we must not show weakness. Fellow Daoists, assist me! If all goes well, we can break the seal today," the Old Demon Ye barked, suddenly speeding up his movements.</p><p>The others fell silent, focusing entirely on aiding the Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Boundless Valley.</p><p>The opposing sides were separated by tens of thousands of miles, yet they were working together to break the seal.</p><p>After hours of relentless bombardment, they finally opened a crack in the seal.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A surge of blood water gushed out from the crack, carrying a pungent, metallic stench.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others frowned, sealing their noses and mouths as they looked toward Tongyou Demon Lord and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"According to the records, each wave of blood connects to a sealed space. If we jump in, we'll likely be scattered across different locations. At that point, fellow Daoists should follow the incomplete map and head to the innermost marked location as quickly as possible to regroup. As long as we thwart Old Demon Ye's scheme, there will be plenty of opportunities to search for treasures later. I implore everyone to prioritize the greater good and not delay," Tongyou Demon Lord instructed via voice transmission. After exchanging a few more words with Dongyang Bo, he was the first to leap into the Blood Lake.</p><p>There was no need to compete over who went first.</p><p>Qin Sang was the last to enter. He summoned his demon banner to protect himself and stepped into the Blood Lake, facing a wave of blood.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators grew restless.</p><p>Only after the Nascent Soul ancestors had disappeared into the Blood Lake did they dare to act, each summoning their own magical treasures and jumping in.</p><p>Once they too had vanished, the area outside the Blood Lake was completely empty.</p><p>After another half-hour, a ripple suddenly appeared in the void, and a figure emerged from the shadows. Someone had arrived at this critical moment.</p><p>This person was extremely cautious, observing for a long time to ensure no one else was around before stepping out of the shadows.</p><p>If anyone had been nearby at that moment, they would have been shocked to see the newcomer's face.</p><p>The arrival was a young man, radiant and handsome, with an otherworldly aura. He was none other than Gong Liangyu, the current sect master of the Shangyuan Pure Palace!</p><p>The Shangyuan Pure Palace was among the ranks of prestigious sects, but as its sect master, Gong Liangyu was only at the peak of the Golden Core stage. He was not qualified to participate in Nascent Soul-level schemes, but given his status, it wasn't difficult for him to gather inside information.</p><p>Gong Liangyu had deliberately arrived late, yet his expression was tinged with urgency.</p><p>He flashed to a spot above the Blood Lake, about to enter, when he suddenly remembered something. From his sleeve, he retrieved an objectâ€”a three-inch-tall figurine.</p><p>The figurine appeared to be carved from wood, yet its surface had a jade-like sheen, making it hard to discern its true material.</p><p>The strangest part was the figurine's head. It was smooth as a mirror, devoid of any facial features, except for one thing that indicated its front: a small yellow talisman pasted on its forehead. The talisman was as thin as gauze, yet firmly attached. It was inscribed with cinnabar in a single, fluid stroke, forming a complex talisman.</p><p>Otherwise, the figurine was just an ordinary, faceless statue, emitting no detectable fluctuations.</p><p>Gong Liangyu gazed at the figurine in his hand with a grave expression, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and anticipation.</p><p>He gently grasped the figurine, careful not to accidentally peel off the yellow talisman on its face.</p><p>Then, with his other hand, he retrieved a piece of jade, vibrant and green, wrapped with a red cord, from his storage pouch.</p>
