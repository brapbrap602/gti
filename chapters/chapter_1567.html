<h1>Chapter 1558: The Gu King</h1><p>‘Whoo! Whoo!’</p><p>The icy wind howled, and a blizzard raged.  Snowflakes fell as large as mats.  Between the sky and the sea, only white remained.</p><p>Centered around the Snowtreading Divine Saber, a region of extreme cold formed. Wherever the chill reached, the sea surface rapidly froze, becoming a massive ice sheet.  These snowflakes were not ordinary snow, but condensed saber intent, incomparably sharp.</p><p>The Snowtreading Divine Saber tore through the air, appearing at the spot where the Sea Patrolling Yaksha had vanished. Its tip angled downwards, pointing towards the seabed, as saber intent poured forth.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Countless snowflakes pierced the ice sheet. The ice sheet became riddled with holes, but the chill intensified, spreading rapidly downwards and outwards. At this rate, a vast expanse of the sea would be frozen.</p><p>Beneath the sea surface, the Sea Patrolling Yaksha rode a Blue Jiao, fleeing with exceptional agility, unimpeded by the water.</p><p>Sensing the change in Qi above, the Sea Patrolling Yaksha raised its head, seeing only a vast expanse of white, as if the sky was falling. A fierce glint flashed in its eyes.</p><p>The Sea Patrolling Yaksha's aura merged with the Blue Jiao beneath it, pushing their speed to the limit. Its legs clamped tightly around the Blue Jiao, which showed an expression of pain, yet was completely unable to control its own body.</p><p>At the same time, the Sea Patrolling Yaksha’s expression stiffened slightly, then became animated again.</p><p>The Snowtreading Divine Saber hummed. The blade trembled violently, shooting out a myriad of saber beams. A white streak traversed the sky, like a white rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>Even the midday sun's light seemed to grow cold.</p><p>Zhou Jin and the others, driving their flying treasures far away, sensed something and turned their heads.  Seeing this astonishing scene, their faces were filled with awe.</p><p>The divine saber descended!</p><p>The ice sheet shattered with a boom. Countless ice shards were swept up by the Snowtreading Divine Saber, tearing the sea apart, leaving a gigantic trench on the surface.</p><p>The seawater on both sides couldn't close in time, instead being struck by the storm of ice shards, forming mountainous waves on either side. Reaching their peak, they froze, transforming into two icy mountains.</p><p>The ice mountains snaked like dragons.  Between them, the trench seemed bottomless, highlighting the astonishing power of that single strike.</p><p>Within the trench, the figures of the Sea Patrolling Yaksha and the Blue Jiao were exposed.</p><p>Before the divine saber arrived, the frigid saber intent had already enveloped them, sealing the surrounding void.  Ice spread across their bodies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sea Patrolling Yaksha didn't make any attempt to counterattack, allowing itself to be frozen.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an ice sculpture formed.  The Sea Patrolling Yaksha’s expression suddenly became rigid, then its figure vanished into thin air – it was an illusion. Only the Blue Jiao was frozen.</p><p>Qin Sang floated in the air, looking down. Seeing this, his expression remained unchanged. He changed his hand seal, and the Snowtreading Divine Saber reversed, passing directly over the Blue Jiao, slashing towards the depths of the trench.</p><p>Just then, a roar erupted from the trench. The roar echoed between the icy walls, spiraling and amplifying.  By the time it reached the surface, it was earth-shattering.  Zhou Jin and the others heard it clearly, and their hearts chilled.</p><p>The roar originated from a Blue Jiao.</p><p>This Blue Jiao's appearance was no different from other Blue Jiaos, but its size was immense, more than ten times larger than the one frozen in the ice, comparable to a whale.</p><p>The giant Blue Jiao half-rolled its body, glaring up at Qin Sang. Its massive tail lashed out, scales parting and closing. Relying on its powerful physique and brute force, it slammed into the Snowtreading Divine Saber.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The aftershock shattered the ice walls on both sides, and seawater poured in.</p><p>The Snowtreading Divine Saber was initially obstructed, but ultimately broke through the Blue Jiao's scales, cleaving its skull.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, appearing above.  He glanced around, murmuring with some regret, "What a clever use of illusion and water escape techniques!  Too bad I didn't bring any Skyeye Butterflies."</p><p>As his voice fell, the remains of the Blue Jiao's body lost their spiritual light, transforming into two puddles of seawater.</p><p>The Sea Patrolling Yaksha had vanished without a trace.  The sea was its domain. The Sea Patrolling Yaksha was extremely cautious, maintaining a distance from the battle and fleeing directly when the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>Qin Sang also had to consider whether there were any ambushes.  Even if he had directly used the Four-Winged Serpent Seal earlier, it likely wouldn't have yielded any results.</p><p>He extended his spiritual sense, but couldn't detect the Sea Patrolling Yaksha's Qi.  He could only withdraw the Snowtreading Divine Saber and fly out of the trench, finding the ice sculpture that had been thrown out by the aftershock.</p><p>He had deliberately controlled his strength earlier, so this Blue Jiao was still alive.  It floated on the sea surface, belly up, its eyes darting around.  It struggled violently but couldn't break free from the ice prison.  Seeing Qin Sang approach, it looked terrified.</p><p>"I know you possess sentience!"</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the ice. "I ask, you answer!"</p><p>The Blue Jiao nodded frantically, its head banging against the ice prison with loud thuds.</p><p>"Are you demon cultivators who have always cultivated here, or did you wander here from elsewhere? Where is your lair? Why did you come here? How many other Demon Kings are nearby?" Qin Sang stared into the Blue Jiao's eyes.</p><p>The Blue Jiao didn't dare hesitate, opening its maw full of fangs.  Its voice, however, was as thin as a mosquito's, timid and fearful, "Reporting to Master, this little demon has always cultivated in the deep sea with my King, never harming humans.  Not long ago, the King suddenly led an army here.  The attack on the treasure ship was the King's order.  Please, Master, understand.  This little demon has always been a mount, with little knowledge. I don't know the King's intentions. I only heard the King mention that other Kings will be coming later…"</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled with amusement, ignoring the Blue Jiao's fawning expression, and fell into deep thought.</p><p>He then asked a few more questions. The Blue Jiao answered everything it knew, but couldn't provide the information Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>The Sea Patrolling Yaksha had indeed just arrived.</p><p>Demon Kings were flocking to the Crimson South Island Chain. Could there really be some secret in the Crimson South Island Chain that even the demon race had caught wind of?</p><p>This place was not suitable for a long stay!</p><p>Qin Sang exerted a slight force under his feet, breaking the ice.</p><p>The Blue Jiao regained its freedom, but didn't dare leave without orders. It trembled, staying close to Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the Blue Jiao’s back and pointed towards the Crimson South Island Chain. "Let's go!"</p><p>The Blue Jiao didn’t dare make a sound, parting the water and breaking the waves.  It didn't take long to catch up with Zhou Jin and the others. With Qin Sang’s permission, everyone was carried back by the Blue Jiao.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained silent, and the others didn’t dare speak either.</p><p>Thus, they returned to the Crimson South Island Chain in silence, without encountering any beast hordes blocking their path.</p><p>"Disperse," Qin Sang said indifferently as he stepped onto land.</p><p>Leng Qi and the others finally had the chance to express their gratitude.  They bowed to Qin Sang and left with various thoughts in their minds.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head and saw the Blue Jiao peering at him from the shore, gazing expectantly.</p><p>He casually picked up a handful of soil from the ground, shaping it into a clay bowl, then conjured a bowl of water and said to the Blue Jiao, "Come in."</p><p>The Blue Jiao was dumbfounded, staring blankly at the ugly clay bowl.  It was very reluctant, but didn't dare show any resistance, obediently shrinking its size.</p><p>In the palm-sized clay bowl, the Blue Jiao swam like a small fry.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the clay bowl to Zhou Jin.  "Take it back to the inn and keep it in the pond in the back courtyard."</p><p>Zhou Jin didn’t dare be as casual as Qin Sang. This Blue Jiao was stronger than him. He hurriedly stretched out his hands, holding the clay bowl carefully, afraid of spilling it, following Qin Sang closely.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled back to the inn and closed the door, remaining inside.</p><p>The news of the great demon's appearance spread like a storm throughout the Crimson South Island Chain on the day they landed. Coupled with the thunder and rain, it caused widespread panic.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>The wind and rain raged.</p><p>A figure appeared in front of the small courtyard Qin Sang had rented.  The restrictive formations were triggered.</p><p>Inside the house, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, surprised.  "Faster than expected!"</p><p>"Go open the courtyard gate and welcome our esteemed guest!" Qin Sang transmitted his voice to Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu.</p><p>The couple were watching the Blue Jiao by the pond.  They exchanged glances, both somewhat surprised.  To their senses, the area outside the courtyard was clearly empty.</p><p>They hurried to deactivate the formations and opened the courtyard gate. Seeing the old man standing outside, their expressions turned solemn.  They respectfully said, "Senior, please enter."</p><p>The old man was simply dressed in coarse linen clothing, but his demeanor was extraordinary.</p><p>He nodded slightly and followed Zhou Jin to the main hall.  He paused, stroking his long beard, and looked Ruan Yu up and down, who was standing by the door.</p><p>Under the old man’s gaze, Ruan Yu blushed slightly, feeling flustered.</p><p>Zhou Jin felt a surge of anger, but didn't dare express it.</p><p>"Not bad! Excellent natural talent, but it’s a pity her vitality was damaged before. Otherwise, her chances of forming a Gold Core would be high. I have a Chaoyuan Pill here, which should be of some benefit to you, young lady." The old man took out a jade bottle containing a pill.</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu were both stunned.</p><p>Ruan Yu's face was flushed with embarrassment, unsure how to respond, let alone accept.</p><p>"Ruan Yu, thank the senior for his kindness," Qin Sang's voice came from inside.</p><p>Ruan Yu’s face lit up with joy.  She took the jade bottle and curtsied.  "Thank you, Senior, for bestowing the pill."</p><p>"This old man's surname is Leng." The old man smiled, turned, and walked into the main hall.  He said in a clear voice, "Leng You, Left Protector of the Gu God Sect, has come to visit uninvited. I hope I haven’t disturbed Fellow Daoist Qin's cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his cultivation room.  "Fellow Daoist Leng has presented such a generous gift upon arrival.  This humble Daoist is only grateful."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang gestured, inviting the old man to sit down.  He asked curiously, "Are the Leng Trio…"</p><p>Old Leng nodded. "Indeed, they are my three unworthy disciples.  The juniors were disrespectful before, I hope Fellow Daoist Qin will not take offense. Fellow Daoist Qin saved their lives from the jaws of demon beasts, and compared to the grace of saving their lives, what is a mere Chaoyuan Pill?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. He smiled and said, "So, Fellow Daoist has come in response to your disciples' plea for help?  Your speed is quite remarkable!"</p><p>His tone carried a hint of mockery.</p><p>Qin Sang had keenly noticed something.  Old Leng must have been near the Crimson South Island Chain all along.  As for whether he was engaged in other matters or intentionally lurking, only heaven knew.</p><p>The disappearance of a Soul Formation cultivator was important, yet not important to most sects.</p><p>The ruins of the ancient immortal sects were still only legends.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were all busy cultivating and preparing for their tribulations. Sending a few favored disciples to the East Sea to investigate was already showing great importance.  They would at least wait for concrete clues before personally getting involved.</p><p>If not for the search for the two immortal halls, Qin Sang wouldn’t be personally involved either, let alone sending his avatar.</p><p>The Demon King.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator hiding in the shadows…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a premonition of an impending storm. He was at the center of the vortex, unsure whether it was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Old Leng didn’t seem to notice the sarcasm in Qin Sang’s tone.  His smile didn’t fade.  "Hearing Leng Qi describe Fellow Daoist's world-shaking divine abilities, this old man feels ashamed of his own inferiority.  I am truly filled with admiration.  This old man usually prides himself on being well-informed, yet I was unaware of such a master as Fellow Daoist! Shameful! Shameful!"</p><p>"Your disciple must have exaggerated quite a bit." Qin Sang remained impassive.  "Moreover, the world is vast, and heroes are numerous. How can one know them all? Fellow Daoist, please don't mind. This humble Daoist has never heard of the Gu God Sect before."</p><p>Hearing Old Leng claim to be from the Gu God Sect, Qin Sang’s mind raced, recalling the various sects in his memory.</p><p>To familiarize himself with the cultivation world of the Central Continent, he had specifically gathered information, but the Gu God Sect was not among them.</p><p>Old Leng was a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, yet he was only a Protector in the Gu God Sect.  It sounded like there were other Protectors and an even higher-ranking Sect Master.</p><p>How could such a sect be unknown?</p><p>A mysterious sect hidden in the shadows, or one that only appeared after the disappearance of the Soul Formation cultivator?</p><p>The name ‘Gu God Sect’ further aroused Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>He recalled the divine abilities used by the Leng Trio when they encountered the beast horde.</p><p>After the treasure ship was destroyed, the three of them joined forces, opening pouches on their bodies and scattering clouds of brightly colored powders and liquids, all highly toxic substances.</p><p>The colors were chaotic, yet arranged in a specific pattern.  A multicolored toxic domain formed around them.  When demon beasts approached, some died from convulsions, others turned into puddles of pus.  No matter how strong their physical bodies were, they couldn't withstand it.  It was extremely vicious.</p><p>Leng Qi was especially skilled in poison attacks.  Opening his mouth, a purple-scaled snake head emerged from his throat, spewing toxic smoke that merged into the toxic domain, increasing its power even further.</p><p>Seeing this, the others were extremely wary of the Leng Trio and kept their distance.</p><p>"This 'Gu' is not that 'Gu'... it’s the art of Gu poison! That snake is not a spirit insect, but a type of venomous demon snake, cultivated into a Gu beast.  It's not the insect Gu of the Wu Clan, seemingly unrelated to the Wu Clan…"</p><p>Qin Sang had guessed the Leng Trio’s background with near certainty.</p><p>He wondered what kind of divine abilities this old poison master possessed.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was undoubtedly their nemesis.</p><p>His avatar had a Spiritwood body, not fearing ordinary poisons, but there were many toxins that could harm the Nascent Soul, disrupting or even stagnating True Essence.  He had to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Old Leng wasn't annoyed. He smiled and said, "Not knowing each other before is simply a lack of fate."</p><p>Saying so, Old Leng took out a token and offered it to Qin Sang.</p><p>The token was made of dark iron.  The front was engraved with the characters ‘Gu God,’ and the back depicted a uniquely shaped crown.</p><p>In the design, five jade pieces of different colors were inserted around the edge of the crown, their meaning unclear.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this, Fellow Daoist?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"This old man has only given out two Gu God Tokens, both to fellow Daoists with whom I share a kindred spirit.  Although I've only just met Fellow Daoist, I know of your chivalrous heart and am grateful for you saving my disciples.  I feel great admiration.  Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, the Gu God Token has no constraints on you.  It merely represents an esteemed status.  You will hear of our sect frequently in the future.  If you encounter any trouble, our sect will assist with all our might!" Old Leng said confidently.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly didn’t believe there were such benefits in the world.  Since there were no constraints, he decided to accept the Gu God Token and see what the Gu God Sect was all about.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang put away the token, Old Leng’s smile became even warmer.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Old Leng finally stated his purpose, asking about Qin Sang’s discoveries while pursuing the Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and didn’t conceal anything. He asked Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu to take Old Leng to the pond in the back courtyard to personally question the Blue Jiao.</p>
