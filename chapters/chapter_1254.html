<h1>Chapter 1246: Taming the Puppet</h1><p>After breaking free from the hills, Qin Sang noticed that the talisman array set up by Gong Liangyu remained intact, but there was no sign of Dongyang Bo. He wondered where the man had gone.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, pondering whether Dongyang Bo, now severely weakened with his essence blood and treasures damaged, would still participate in the conflict with the Sin Abyss.</p><p>With a flap of his wings, he flew to a distant mountain peak, keeping a watchful eye on the cave entrance from afar.</p><p>The battle with Dongyang Bo had awakened a monstrous creature slumbering at the bottom of the Blood River. Unwilling to engage in unnecessary conflict, Qin Sang had left without even glancing at the monster. He had no idea of its strength or origin, but the mere sense of threat it exuded before fully awakening suggested it was no ordinary being.</p><p>If the creature were to awaken and linger near the entrance of the Blood Lake, it could spell trouble when they tried to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the cave entrance, where billowing clouds of blood mist surged outward. Soon, a swarm of blood shadows rushed out in panic, as if fleeing from a terrifying enemy.</p><p>Outside the cave, the blood mist thinned, and without its support, the blood shadows scattered like headless flies, triggering ancient restrictions around them and disintegrating into ash.</p><p>The chaos didn’t last long, and the cave entrance quickly returned to calm.</p><p>After observing for a while and seeing no further disturbances, Qin Sang decided to leave. He flew far away, finding a secluded spot to place the talisman puppet on the ground.</p><p>The puppet roared wildly, its jade bottle cracked and barely containing it. No wonder Gong Liangyu had handled it with such caution.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the puppet, at a loss. For now, his only option was to find a way to suppress it and study how to tame it later.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the ground, sending a strand of his divine sense into the puppet’s body. What he saw shocked him.</p><p>“Good heavens! What a mess!”</p><p>Inside the Nascent Soul-level puppet, countless soul shadows stood like a forest. The moment they sensed Qin Sang’s divine sense, they all turned to stare at him, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang felt something trying to tear at his soul. The soul shadows surged toward him like a horde of demons, resembling a scene from a nightmare.</p><p>“What kind of evil puppet is this? It’s definitely a malevolent creation!”</p><p>Even with the protection of his jade Buddha, Qin Sang felt a shiver of fear. Such a chaotic puppet—what kind of dark arts had the Upper Yuan Pure Palace used to refine it?</p><p>There was no way to sort through this mess in a short time. Taking advantage of the jade bottle’s remaining power to suppress the puppet, Qin Sang rapidly applied countless sealing techniques. Finally, with the help of demonic flames, he managed to forcibly seal it.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The spiritual array shattered, its lifespan spent.</p><p>A black light flew into Qin Sang’s palm.</p><p>The puppet had been sealed into a palm-sized figure, still restless, surrounded by demonic flames that formed tadpole-like black runes etched onto its body, temporarily restraining it.</p><p>“Master, where are we going now?”</p><p>Fat Chicken, released by Qin Sang, looked anxious. They had originally set out to find its mother, but Dongyang Bo’s interference had complicated matters.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had lured and killed Gong Liangyu, and Qin Sang’s battle with him hadn’t taken long, though the earlier tracking had been time-consuming.</p><p>After meditating to recover, Qin Sang stood up and said, “We’ll quickly survey the outer area and then hurry to meet up with the others.”</p><p>Having accidentally revealed his identity, Qin Sang was even more determined to find the Thunder-Swallowing Roc Demon King. Not only would it legitimize the Thousand Bamboo Sea’s claim to a demon king, providing an explanation to the demon race, but it would also gain him a powerful ally.</p><p>From now on, it wouldn’t just be about fighting and killing.</p><p>Now that both sides were openly confronting each other, they would undoubtedly tread carefully, avoiding any opportunities for the other to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang’s foundation in the cultivation world was still shallow, unlike Dongyang Bo’s. Since he intended to establish the Green Goat Temple’s lineage, the future of both sects would be influenced by their enmity. Building alliances to deter the other side and proceeding cautiously was the right path.</p><p>Taking Fat Chicken with him, Qin Sang summoned his Ebony Sword and used sword flight to traverse the outer area.</p><p>Fat Chicken’s Thunder Bead showed no reaction. It seemed that if the Thunder-Swallowing Roc Demon King was still alive, she must be deep within the Blood Lake.</p><p>Fat Chicken looked dispirited. If the outer area was this dangerous, the depths of the Blood Lake were unimaginable. No matter how strong its mother was, the chances of survival in such a place were slim.</p><p>…</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Fat Chicken were traveling through the mountain ranges.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang stopped on a mountain peak, gazing at the towering peaks ahead. Dozens of mountain ranges rose in orderly layers, like steps ascending into the sky.</p><p>“Master, it seems to be over there!”</p><p>Fat Chicken pointed with its wing toward the foremost mountain.</p><p>The peak of that mountain was unique, as if something had sheared it flat, forming a vast platform.</p><p>This was the meeting place agreed upon by the Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, a hint of surprise in his voice. “There’s no one here. Have they already gone in?”</p><p>His figure flickered as he leaped onto the stone platform, his vision suddenly opening up.</p><p>Beyond this mountain, there were no more ranges blocking the view.</p><p>Before him stretched an exceptionally vast basin shrouded in blood mist.</p><p>The basin was filled with surging fog.</p><p>Even with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s vision, Qin Sang couldn’t penetrate the blood mist to see what lay beneath.</p><p>This place was different from the Blood River he had seen before. There were no wandering blood shadows here, but the blood mist was densely laced with ancient restrictions, far more dangerous than the Blood River.</p><p>According to the information they had gathered, the so-called depths of the Blood Lake referred to this blood mist-covered basin.</p><p>Years ago, the seal of the Blood Lake had loosened for unknown reasons, and the shadow of a Bloodless Mulberry Tree had projected from the lake, attracting attention.</p><p>Later, several seniors had worked together to break the seal and enter. When they reached this platform, they saw the true form of the Bloodless Mulberry Tree floating within the blood mist.</p><p>One of the seniors had used a great divine ability on this platform to “fish” the Bloodless Mulberry Tree out.</p><p>As for why they later turned against each other, shattered the tree, and what happened afterward, no one knew.</p><p>The fragments of the Bloodless Mulberry Tree scattered outside were incomplete, leading many to suspect that some parts might have fallen back into the basin.</p><p>Thus, their journey wasn’t solely to thwart Elder Ye’s schemes but also to search for the divine tree.</p><p>Standing there, Qin Sang gazed into the distance and noticed a black dot in the middle of the basin, visible through the blood mist. Upon closer inspection, it resembled the spire of some structure.</p><p>“Master, there’s a message here!”</p><p>Fat Chicken, standing at the edge of the platform, made a new discovery and called out loudly.</p><p>Qin Sang saw it too.</p><p>At the edge of the platform, a message formed of true essence hovered on the surface of a bloodstone, only slightly concealed.</p><p>It had been jointly reinforced by the Nether Demon Lord, Xiang Qing, Chongyi Daoist, and Qing Jun using special methods, making it impossible to fake.</p><p>Aside from Dongyang Bo, the strongest figures from the Cold Domain had all arrived.</p><p>The message explained that shortly after arriving, they had detected anomalies deep within the basin, suspecting Elder Ye’s machinations. Unable to wait for the others, they had pressed ahead.</p><p>They had marked the direction and would leave warnings of dangers along the way, urging those who followed to catch up quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around but saw no sign of the anomalies they mentioned.</p><p>―</p><p>―</p><p>Still not fully adjusted, and after consecutive nights of staying up, I’m feeling the strain. Today, I’ll only write one chapter as a break.</p><p>I’ll do my best to make up for the missed chapter in the next couple of days.</p>
