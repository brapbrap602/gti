<h1>Chapter 2021: The Cracked City</h1><p>As Qin Sang continued forward, a powerful suction tore at him, pushing him towards the ‘void.’</p><p>Nearing the edge of the black disc, Qin Sang didn't stop. He entered the disc and immediately felt the suction intensify, accompanied by a swirling force. He activated his blood Qi and, relying on his powerful physique, forcibly held his position. He felt as if he had fallen into a gigantic grinding mill, constantly being crushed.</p><p>Qin Sang experienced this for a while before retreating. He took some spirit materials from his Thousand Jun Ring, casually refined two puppets, and tossed them toward the black disc.</p><p>The moment the puppets entered the disc, they were swept up by the suction, rapidly spinning along its surface. Their speed increased exponentially, and they were almost instantly sucked into the void.</p><p>Due to their limited power, the puppets were completely helpless against the suction. They weren't crushed by the disc, and until they were swallowed by the void, their bodies remained intact, almost undamaged.</p><p>Qin Sang observed this scene but couldn't determine if the void was safe. He saw the puppets vanish the moment they touched the void. He immediately lost contact with them, unable to learn what they encountered within.</p><p>However, through this test, Qin Sang gleaned some clues. He pondered whether there was anything he could exploit and how he might explore the interior of the void.</p><p>Sending anyone or anything into the void meant preparing for a one-way trip. He also had to find a way to breach the void's blockade and send information back; otherwise, it would all be in vain.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang realized there was no other good option but to risk approaching the void himself, awaken the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and attempt to peer into the void with its divine ability.</p><p>He didn't rush to awaken the butterfly. Qin Sang decided to try other methods first. He manifested his Dharma Body, repeatedly entering the black disc to experience the power of the suction. He continuously pushed his limits, employing various secret techniques to probe its nature.</p><p>As Qin Sang persisted in his efforts, he suddenly felt a gentle breeze brush against his face.</p><p>The breeze was exceedingly soft, like a warm spring wind. An ordinary person wouldn't notice it, but its presence here was both unexpected and eerie.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly looked towards the depths of the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>Zhu Que and the other demon queens belatedly realized something was amiss. Recalling the legends of the Feng Ju Jade Gate, they cried out, “It's the Evil Wind!”</p><p>Two of the great calamities, the Evil Wind and the Treacherous Thunder, Qin Sang had finally encountered them after so long within the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>These two calamities sometimes appeared individually, sometimes wreaking havoc together, without any discernible pattern. As the cries rang out, the Evil Wind's force intensified at an alarming rate.</p><p>Surrounded by the tightly packed illusory scenes conjured by divine abilities, the Evil Wind seemed to permeate everything. It blew incessantly, whistling past their ears.</p><p>It was said that the Evil Wind's power fluctuated. When weak, its destructive power was limited. However, their current location was precarious. Situated amidst these illusory scenes, should the Evil Wind trigger the dormant power within them, anyone would be terrified.  And next to them was an even more terrifying, enigmatic black hole.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Without hesitation, he stretched out his hand, seizing Zhu Que and the other demons. His true body then carried them away, fleeing from this place, leaving his Dharma Body behind.</p><p>This was a risky move, but it presented a rare opportunity to observe the void amidst the Evil Wind.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!’</p><p>By the time Qin Sang had escaped the area of the illusory scenes, the Evil Wind's force had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>The invisible wind blew ceaselessly from the depths of the Feng Ju Jade Gate. As it passed through the void, it left behind visible trails, like bone-chilling steel blades, except the blades were cutting through the void itself.</p><p>Looking around, the Evil Wind was everywhere, pervasive, unable to be stopped by even the illusory scenes. As the wind grazed his body, even with his powerful physique, Qin Sang felt waves of chilling coldness.</p><p>Zhu Que, riding her Fire Jade Centipede, was enveloped in flames and fared relatively well. Gui Hou and Luo Hou huddled together, joining forces to resist the Evil Wind.</p><p>‘Clatter, clatter, clatter…’</p><p>The captive, with his cultivation sealed, shivered uncontrollably. His face turned pale, and a layer of frost rapidly spread across his body. Zhu Que intervened, shielding him with her power, allowing his condition to improve.</p><p>At this moment, cultivators elsewhere were also assaulted by the Evil Wind. Chaos reigned within the Feng Ju Jade Gate, and some lost their lives inexplicably.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the void through his Dharma Body. As the Evil Wind intensified, the black disc became unstable. Ripples spread across its surface, occasionally erupting in black jets.</p><p>Sensing the power of these jets, Qin Sang's Dharma Body grew solemn, retreating further and further. Finally, his Dharma Body's expression completely changed. It transformed into a bolt of lightning, frantically flying back.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang witnessed a breathtaking scene. A monstrous black tide surged forward, engulfing the illusory scene closest to the black disc.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as the illusory scene, as if squeezed by an external force, first compressed and deformed. Then, its front end protruded, pulled and elongated by the suction into a long, thin ribbon of light. It spiraled towards the void until it was completely swallowed.</p><p>These illusory scenes were manifestations of ancient mighty figures' divine abilities, almost indistinguishable from reality. Qin Sang had witnessed the destruction of illusory scenes before, but he had never seen anything capable of swallowing an illusory scene whole, especially without any resistance from the scene itself.</p><p>With the eruption of the black tide, this area became extremely dangerous. Qin Sang's Dharma Body, seemingly oblivious to the danger, stared intently at the void.</p><p>When the illusory scene was swallowed by the void, the anticipated conflict and explosion didn't occur. The illusory scene simply vanished without a trace.  Illusory scenes also contained immense power.  If the void had destroyed it, it shouldn't have been so quiet.</p><p>“Could it be that the void truly leads to another place?”</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body didn't linger.  It flew away. Reaching the edge of the area where the illusory scenes converged, he noticed a sphere of light slowly drifting from the void – a solitary illusory scene.</p><p>“Could it be that it was pulled here by the void?”</p><p>Qin Sang gradually understood. When the black disc erupted, the void would swallow the surrounding illusory scenes.  Simultaneously, the surrounding scenes would be drawn in, replenishing the consumed ones. Thus, the void remained perpetually surrounded by illusory scenes.</p><p>“What a gluttonous thing!” Qin Sang marveled inwardly. Whether it was the Feng Ju Jade Gate or the Ju Shan Altar of Healing, there were too many phenomena that defied common sense.</p><p>His Dharma Body merged with his true body. He waited for a while longer until the Evil Wind showed signs of weakening.  When the wind finally subsided, Qin Sang returned to the location and discovered that the black disc had reverted to its original form.</p><p>Even the illusory scenes couldn't reveal the void's secrets. He decided not to waste any more thought on it.  He memorized the location and departed with Zhu Que and the other demons.</p><p>The Evil Wind didn't cause much damage this time. Qin Sang continued to travel extensively as before.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, it had been seven years since they entered the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently searched for escape routes, identifying several locations and attempting to establish retreat paths.  Combined with the enigmatic void, he had three preliminary options.  However, he still felt it wasn't enough. These options were sufficient to evade Nascent Soul cultivators, but against Soul Formation or even Great Ascension stage powerhouses, their effectiveness was uncertain.</p><p>He never ceased his efforts.  After Gu Ya fully recovered, she assisted Zhu Que. Su Nu remained in seclusion, healing her injuries. The Xin family still hadn't found their target.</p><p>Notably, he had asked the Xin family to search for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine, and they had actually found several possible leads.  However, Qin Sang wasn't particularly focused on this and hadn't gone to verify them.</p><p>On this day, it was time for their scheduled meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang went to meet with the Xin family. As expected, all their teams returned empty-handed. He wondered what the Xin family was searching for, something hidden so deeply.</p><p>As they discussed whether to change their strategy, a streak of light suddenly flew towards them, seemingly coming from outside the Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>The streak of light arrived at the carriage and revealed a Nascent Soul cultivator, appearing as a young man.</p><p>“Xin Ming, why are you here? Has something major happened outside?” Steward Luo asked, stepping forward.</p><p>The Xin family hadn't brought all their forces into the Feng Ju Jade Gate; some remained outside.</p><p>Xin Ming hastily bowed towards the carriage, isolating their voices with a spell, and urgently said, “Reporting to Young Master, Steward Luo, something has happened at Jade Gate City!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Steward Luo's heart skipped a beat. Xin Ming's spell couldn't block Qin Sang and Protector Pei. They immediately shifted their attention.</p><p>Jade Gate City had stood for many years. What could possibly happen there?  Could someone dare to attack the city?</p><p>“Not long ago, mighty figures battled near Jade Gate City. The entire city was alarmed.  The collision of their divine abilities sent shockwaves throughout the heavens and earth.  Suddenly, the sky darkened, and flying sand and stones filled the air…”</p><p>Recalling the scene, Xin Ming's eyes widened in terror. He swallowed hard. “Jade Gate City activated its city-protecting grand formation, but under the impact of the aftershocks, the ground still trembled, as if it would collapse at any moment.  With a deafening thunderclap, a massive crack appeared on the western city wall, almost causing it to crumble…”</p><p>Listening to Xin Ming's description, Qin Sang and Protector Pei's expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>Jade Gate City had stood before the Feng Ju Jade Gate for countless years, serving as the western gate of Dui Prefecture. The strength of its city-protecting grand formation was beyond doubt. The partial display of its power that Qin Sang witnessed upon entering the city was enough to deter him from any thoughts of forcing his way in.</p><p>Merely the aftershocks of the battle, filtered through the grand formation, nearly destroyed the city wall.  Were those battling at the Soul Formation or Great Ascension stage? The sudden appearance of two such powerhouses near the Feng Ju Jade Gate, what did it signify?</p><p>Was it a coincidence, or had some unforeseen event occurred?</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed with unease. Could one of them be Tian Yue Shangren, entangled with an enemy?</p><p>“Who were those fighting?” Protector Pei asked the question on Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>“Unknown,” Xin Ming shook his head.  “From beginning to end, neither powerhouse revealed themselves. Those in the city could only see raging storms and dazzling radiance in the sky. Finally, the two mighty figures departed, and no one knows who won or lost.”</p><p>Departed… could they be heading towards the Feng Ju Jade Gate?</p><p>Qin Sang and Protector Pei exchanged glances.</p><p>“What is the situation in Jade Gate City now?” Qin Sang continued his questioning.</p><p>“After the battle, rumors spread like wildfire, claiming that a great war will erupt here.  The Immortal City is in a panic, fearing they'll be caught in the crossfire. Many are leaving the city, fleeing towards the heart of Dui Prefecture.  It's said that a similar situation occurred when the Sword Pavilion fragments were first discovered, but it wasn't as impactful as this battle between mighty figures, which nearly affected the entire city. Outsiders, rogue cultivators, aristocratic families, sects, and major merchant guilds are all evacuating, creating utter chaos…”</p><p>Xin Ming's words deepened the gravity of their expressions. They were inside the Feng Ju Jade Gate, even closer to the center of the storm than Jade Gate City.</p><p>“Have the Five Elements Alliance also left?”  Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xin Ming hesitated.  He knew Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, a helper invited by the Young Master.</p><p>“What are you stammering about! Speak plainly!” Young Master Xin rebuked. It was the first time he had spoken, his tone betraying little emotion.</p><p>“This junior passed by the Five Elements Alliance's gates and saw that they were closed to visitors, but I’m unsure if they have evacuated everyone.  Jade Gate City is practically deserted. Many sects that have been established in Jade Gate City for years have also sealed their mountain gates and left the city to seek refuge. The city is in complete disarray now,” Xin Ming quickly replied.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that it seemed the Five Elements Alliance had indeed withdrawn.  The Alliance was a business entity; seeking good fortune and avoiding disaster was their instinct.  With their scale, they had no need to take risks.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance was secondary.  The key issue was those two mysterious mighty figures. Why were they here? Where were they now?</p><p>Before Tian Yue Shangren’s arrival, turmoil had already begun.</p><p>The news Xin Ming brought was earth-shattering. Steward Luo expressed his worries, “Young Master, I fear the Feng Ju Jade Gate is no longer safe. Should we leave first and avoid this storm…”</p><p>Young Master Xin remained silent for a moment, then simply said, “There’s no turning back after the bow is drawn!”</p><p>Steward Luo sighed deeply.</p><p>“Let's observe for a while longer,” Young Master Xin said. “But we can't disperse our forces like before.  Merge into three groups…”</p><p>While master and servant discussed, Protector Pei's expression flickered, seemingly weighing something in his mind.</p><p>“This news is too startling. I’ll take my leave first,” Qin Sang said, cupping his hands.</p><p>Noticing Young Master Xin’s gaze, Qin Sang added, “Rest assured, Young Master Xin. Your family has helped me search for so long.  Even if there’s no merit, there’s certainly effort. Unless absolutely necessary, I won't go back on my word.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder Qin.”</p><p>Young Master Xin rose and bowed deeply.</p><p>Protector Pei’s eyes narrowed slightly, watching Qin Sang’s retreating figure, but remained silent.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Xin family, Qin Sang considered his next course of action. It seemed he needed to recall Zhu Que and the others to his side to prevent any accidents.</p><p>There was also Su Nu. He wondered how her injuries were. This was no place for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly located Zhu Que and the others.  Considering he didn't want Gu Ya and Su Nu to meet for the time being, he went to Su Nu's cave alone.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu again, her complexion had improved, though a trace of paleness lingered. She hadn't fully recovered.</p><p>"Thank you for your warning, Brother Qin. It seems I must leave first. I’ll consider my next move after my strength is restored.  Won’t Brother Qin leave with me to avoid this danger?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I still have unfinished business here.  If I sense any danger, I’ll immediately leave and meet up with you."</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu didn’t press further, only advising, "Brother Qin, please be careful!"</p><p>They agreed on a meeting place, and Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s escaping light disappeared into the distance, a man suddenly emerged from behind Su Nu.</p><p>The man’s figure flickered, his entire being enveloped in an ethereal aura, appearing profound and unfathomable.  He gazed in the direction Qin Sang had departed, as if able to see his silhouette through the void. After a moment of silence, he said, "From now on, you will stay by his side."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Su Nu bowed in acknowledgement.</p>
