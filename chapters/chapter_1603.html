<h1>Chapter 1594: The Spirit-Calming Incense and the Dragon Bee</h1><p>Chapter 1594: The Spirit-Calming Incense and the Dragon Bee</p><p>Qin Sang held the Spirit-Calming Incense, his confidence high.</p><p>“My requirements remain unchanged; I seek treasures that enhance spiritual awareness.  The value of such treasures needs no further explanation; I'm sure you all understand…”</p><p>He glanced at the Nine Refinements Returning God Pill, leaving the implication unspoken.  He could accept exchanging puppet crystals for the Nine Refinements Returning God Pill, but now, with the Spirit-Calming Incense, a single pill wouldn't suffice.</p><p>Qin Sang’s conditions brought a brief silence to the gathering around the pool.  Expressions varied; some fixed their gaze on the incense, others scrutinized Qin Sang.</p><p>This kind of treasure – regardless of Daoist, Buddhist, demonic, or human cultivation, righteous or evil, or the type of cultivation method – was desirable to all, and more was always better.  Yet, heart demons were intangible and unpredictable, making treasures that suppressed them rare and invaluable in the cultivation world.  Who wouldn't treasure such a find?</p><p>No one expected to see the legendary Spirit-Calming Incense at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>"We've only heard legends of the Spirit-Calming Incense; we've never seen it. How can we be sure this is genuine?" someone cautiously asked.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the jade box, shielding it from view. "Any cultivator who presents a treasure of equivalent value may light the incense.  The Spirit-Calming Incense suppresses heart demons primarily by stabilizing the mind. Even those without immediate heart demon concerns can experience its unique effects."</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished, a black-clad man abruptly stood, rushing to the pool's edge, his voice urgent.</p><p>Before he could state his offer, an elderly man in Daoist robes interrupted, "I haven't said no yet; there's no need for such haste, Jiang You!"</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang presented the incense, Jiang You had been fixated on the jade box.</p><p>At the elder's call, Jiang You seemed to awaken, a wry smile touching his lips.</p><p>While he couldn't deny the allure of the Spirit-Calming Incense, he had to suppress his greed.  The Six States Hall organized the Treasure Exchange. As deputy hall master, any impropriety would be devastating to their reputation, jeopardizing their standing in the cultivation world. The Spirit-Calming Incense, however valuable, wasn't worth such a gamble.</p><p>Stepping in front of the black-clad man, Jiang You said sternly, "Please return to your seat.  Calm yourself."</p><p>Feeling the gaze from the shadows, the black-clad man, visibly shaken, silently returned to his seat, appearing distraught.</p><p>But the gathering comprised powerful figures, proud and unruly, not easily controlled.  A discordant voice immediately rose, "While the host has priority, the highest bidder wins.  Anyone who can impress this cultivator with a suitable treasure may bid! I won't waste words – three Azure Abyss Sky Fruits for this incense. Can the host offer more?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the speaker.  The person wore blue armor, their entire body concealed within, completely obscuring their features.  A companion sat beside them in similar, grey-white armor.  Earlier in the exchange, the grey-armored person had challenged Jiang You, demanding the host reveal themselves, a rather impolite gesture that had caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>In a world where Daoist cultivators prevailed, even Yuan Ying cultivators rarely wore armor like this all the time, even if it was a magical treasure. Perhaps they concealed their identities at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>A murmur rippled through the gathering; many were stunned by the blue-armored cultivator's offer.  Azure Abyss Sky Fruits were precious spirit fruits that directly enhanced spiritual awareness; their rarity was comparable to the Spirit-Calming Incense.  The offer of three fruits showed their determination.</p><p>Qin Sang, having heard of the Azure Abyss Sky Fruits, was delighted. "Could you show me the fruits, friend?"</p><p>The blue-armored cultivator responded calmly, "I haven't brought them with me…I have an Azure Abyss Sky Fruit spirit root at my estate, bearing several fruits that will ripen within ten years.  You can accompany me to the East Sea to verify this. If you're hesitant, I can offer other treasures as collateral…"</p><p>The blue-armored cultivator's inability to produce the fruits, followed by his even more startling proposition, stifled any potential laughter among the audience.</p><p>A single Azure-Falling Melon Tree could support an entire sect!</p><p>“Which immortal island master from the East Sea is it?”</p><p>“Is it from the Xinmiao Sect or Nine Heavens Island?  Doesn't seem like it!”</p><p>“Judging by the armor’s style, it feels like it’s from the Seven Water Mirror Islands.”</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, everyone wildly speculated about the identity of the person in blue armor.</p><p>Three Azure-Falling Melons were a very tempting prize.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no proof.</p><p>Following this person to the East Sea to retrieve the treasure – who could guarantee there wouldn’t be a trap waiting?</p><p>Holding the treasure in one's own hands was far more reliable.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t rush to express an opinion, instead looking towards the Daoist elder.</p><p>While the person in blue armor was speaking, the Daoist elder had been silently pondering.</p><p>He seemed to have made a decision, first asking the Daoist nun beside him: “Daoist friend, would you be willing to exchange this vial of Ten-Thousand-Year Green Cloud Dew for another treasure? I have a few more items on me, you can choose whichever you prefer.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Daoist nun was very firm.  “I only want the Nine Refinement Returning God Pill!”</p><p>Under the surprised gazes of everyone present, the Daoist elder picked up the elixir and gave it to the Daoist nun. “Ten-Thousand-Year Green Cloud Dew is something this old man absolutely must have. Please accept this, Daoist friend!”</p><p>He didn’t want the Spirit-Subduing Incense?</p><p>The Daoist nun hadn’t expected it to be so easy, momentarily stunned before overflowing with joy.  Carefully opening the pill bottle, she lightly sniffed it with her delicate nose, revealing a captivated expression.  “The pill is authentic. Thank you, Daoist friend!”</p><p>The Daoist elder smiled and nodded, watching the Daoist nun leave before turning to Qin Sang. “It seems that you won’t be changing your mind either?”</p><p>“That’s correct!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noticing a certain strangeness in the elder’s expression and feeling curious about what treasure he could possibly produce.</p><p>The Daoist elder sighed lightly, reluctantly saying, “This item was originally intended for my own use; I only obtained it by chance. If it weren’t for the Daoist friend bringing out such a rare item as the Spirit-Subduing Incense, I would never have used it for trade…”</p><p>As he spoke, he took a soft silk pouch from his bag of holding.</p><p>The pouch was only the size of a thumb, exquisitely made, yet its surface appeared very rough, woven with grayish-black thread, the stitching haphazard and disorganized, not at all like something precious.</p><p>The top of the pouch was closed.</p><p>The treasure wasn’t the pouch itself, but what was inside.</p><p>The Daoist elder placed it in his palm, carefully touching the silk pouch.</p><p>Before seeing the object, a strange fragrance wafted from the pouch.</p><p>Instantly, a strong aroma filled Qin Sang’s nostrils, evoking an indescribable feeling that made him involuntarily reveal a captivated expression.</p><p>It wasn't just Qin Sang; everyone else smelled it too.</p><p>The strange fragrance permeated the area around the pool, completely overshadowing any other scents.</p><p>Numerous eyes focused on the opening of the pouch.  They noticed the Daoist elder hadn't opened it, but instead made the opening transparent, vaguely revealing a small, yellowish object inside.</p><p>About the size of a small fingernail, it resembled gold.</p><p>“This is…?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered with curiosity.</p><p>“Have you ever heard of a spiritual insect called the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon?” The Daoist elder held out his palm, questioning Qin Sang.</p><p>The Immortal Fat Bee Dragon, a wondrous insect of the world!</p><p>On the Spirit Control Sect’s ranking of strange insects, it ranked even higher than the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Coincidentally, it’s said the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon’s abilities are related to illusion magic, precisely the opposite of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  Its appearance is not like a dragon, closer to a bee, the “Dragon” in its name referring to a “Mirage Dragon.”</p><p>There are also legends that the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon has true dragon bloodline and can eventually transform into a true dragon.</p><p>The first legend seems more credible.</p><p>Qin Sang, having dedicated years to the study of insect control, could not possibly be unaware of this.</p><p>“Could this be Near Dragon Saliva?” Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>Near Dragon Saliva, as the name suggests, is similar to the legendary Dragon’s Saliva incense, possessing an unparalleled fragrance, unforgettable after a single inhalation.</p><p>Seeing it today, it truly lives up to its reputation.</p><p>Near Dragon Saliva is actually a strange substance secreted by the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon.</p><p>“Indeed, your knowledge is remarkable!”</p><p>The Daoist elder nodded lightly.  Recognizing it was good; the worst thing would have been not knowing its value.  “The Immortal Fat Bee Dragon only secretes Near Dragon Saliva when it’s nurturing its offspring, condensing its internal energy and releasing it. An Immortal Fat Bee Dragon only breeds once in its lifetime, so one can see how precious this is. Its offspring can rapidly transform after consuming it, while cultivators can strengthen their primordial spirit and enhance their spiritual awareness by refining it. More importantly…”</p><p>Pausing slightly, the elder solemnly stated, “This piece of Near Dragon Saliva comes from an Immortal Fat Bee Dragon that has undergone five transformations!”</p><p>A five-transformed spiritual insect!</p><p>At the same level as a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Another wave of commotion swept through the crowd, who exclaimed their trip hadn’t been in vain.</p><p>Spirit-Subduing Incense, Azure-Falling Melon Tree, Near Dragon Saliva…</p><p>These treasures could be considered the pinnacle of their kind, rarely seen even at this level of treasure exchange meeting!</p><p>With these items appearing, no one dared to show off their own treasures.</p><p>Nobody noticed…</p><p>On the edge of the gathering, beneath the shade of an ancient cypress.</p><p>A young Daoist sat cross-legged, never having made a bid; the Daoist elder, who had been silently observing from the sidelines, remained outwardly calm.</p><p>Until Qin Sang brought out the Spirit-Subduing Incense.</p><p>The young Daoist several times seemed on the verge of bidding, ultimately giving up in resignation.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang examined the near-ambergris in the silk pouch, sensing the lingering aura of a high-order spirit insect, and was secretly astonished.</p><p>If it were near-ambergris secreted by a four-transformation Immortal Fat Bee Dragon, he would have hesitated.  Now, there was no need for deliberation, even though this piece was small.</p><p>Near-ambergris secreted by a five-transformation spirit insect contains higher Dao principles, bringing immeasurable benefits that cannot be measured by size.</p><p>But Qin Sang wasn't blinded by the treasure. He looked up and asked the elder, "How can I refine this near-ambergris? Why have you kept it until now?"</p><p>It's 'food' prepared by the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon for its offspring.</p><p>For a being of a different species like him to refine it, it wouldn't be that simple; complete absorption would be impossible.</p><p>The Daoist elder knew that Yuan Ying cultivators were all shrewd, making deception virtually impossible, so he laid out the near-ambergris's shortcomings: "Firstly, contact with outside air accelerates its decay. This was taken from a section of the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon's nest, and must be kept sealed in this silk pouch. Once opened, it's best to refine it all at once. Secondly, the near-ambergris contains a strange energy. The offspring of the Immortal Fat Bee Dragon can consume it directly, but this energy is harmful and useless to cultivators like us. The loss of power is secondary; when subjected to this energy, one must carefully disperse and expel it.  How long this process takes, I cannot say; it could be hundreds, even several hundred years. This is why I hesitated earlier... However, if you are a spirit cultivator, it should be much faster."</p><p>In the Daoist elder's eyes, Qin Sang disregarded everything else, specifically requesting this type of treasure, suggesting a high probability of being a spirit cultivator.</p><p>In fact, others had similar suspicions.</p><p>Spirit cultivators are even rarer than body cultivators.</p><p>There are sects in Central State that produce spirit cultivators, but top-tier experts are seldom seen.</p><p>Qin Sang silently counted his advantages:</p><p>The secret technique, *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The Soul-Nurturing Wood.</p><p>...</p><p>Even true spirit cultivators don't possess this many treasures.</p><p>More importantly, the jade Buddha.</p><p>He wondered what kind of impact the near-ambergris would bring, and whether the jade Buddha could withstand it.</p><p>The elder clearly wouldn't explain in detail.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't know himself.</p><p>His mind raced.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, opened his mouth to speak, when he heard the cold voice of the man in green armor, "My Azure Falling Peach Fruit is worth no less than the near-ambergris, and can be directly refined without hindrance, with immediate results! I can add another; I urge you to reconsider!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, apologizing for the rudeness, "My vision is limited; I only see what's before me."</p><p>The man in green armor snorted angrily.</p><p>Unexpectedly, seeing he couldn't persuade Qin Sang, he changed targets, shouting at the Daoist elder, "Old Daoist, what about you? Azure Falling Peach Fruit in exchange for your dragon's incense... I can also offer you some of the treasures you want! You dare host a treasure exchange, yet you're as cowardly as this boy?"</p><p>Others were also tempted by the near-ambergris, tentatively bidding.</p><p>However, the elder's warnings scared most people off.</p><p>The elder, having revealed his cultivation as a late Yuan Ying stage cultivator, didn't dare refine the near-ambergris lightly, demonstrating the danger wasn't exaggerated.</p><p>If it took too long, even with a great increase in spiritual sense, the cost of stagnant cultivation would be too high.</p><p>Heavenly Tribulations loomed like swords.</p><p>Most cultivators couldn't afford distractions.</p><p>In comparison, everyone wanted the Spirit-Subduing Incense more.</p><p>It was just that Qin Sang and the Daoist elder both coveted the other's treasure, leaving no room for others to intervene.</p><p>Under the indifferent gaze of the man in green armor.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the jade box across.</p><p>The Daoist elder carefully unsealed the jade box, lit the Spirit-Subduing Incense, verified its authenticity, couldn't help but smile, and quickly handed the near-ambergris to Qin Sang.</p><p>Everyone was happy!</p><p>Qin Sang also carefully examined it, put it away in his storage ring, and without delay, walked down from the pool, his figure pausing almost imperceptibly.</p><p>The treasure exchange continued.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The elder placed a pouch on the stone table, his voice heavy.</p><p>"A large amount of Floating Light Silver, in exchange for treasures other than Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Cloud Dew. Floating Light Silver can be bought with spirit stones outside, but you should all know that Floating Light Silver from the same vein can be refined into Xuanji True Silver. The more you have, the more valuable it is. My Floating Light Silver all comes from the same vein, enough to refine high-purity Xuanji True Silver for crafting pseudo-spiritual treasures, a value that cannot be measured in spirit stones. Of course, if you can offer top-grade spirit stones, that's another matter..."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>If I don't post a single chapter announcement, it means my status is fine and I will try my best to update.</p>
