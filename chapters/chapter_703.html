<h1>Chapter 695: The Bone Flute Appears Again</h1><p>The market was unexpectedly located underground.</p><p>A cultivator had used Dao techniques to excavate a space, protected by powerful restrictions and formations.  The entire subterranean space was divided into two sections by a stone gate. Only cultivators of the Core Formation stage and above were allowed to enter the inner section.</p><p>Upon entering the underground space, Qin Sang saw numerous crude stone huts, clearly intended for temporary use.</p><p>The market was already bustling with cultivators moving between the stone huts.</p><p>Han Cuo and his companions offered to host Qin Sang, but he politely declined.</p><p>Han Cuo dismissed the others and turned to Qin Sang.  "I just inquired, the inner exchange meeting will commence in a few days, after all the Core Formation cultivators have arrived. Fellow Daoist, feel free to browse around outside.  Many of the stone hut owners are actually representatives of large trading companies on Tempest Island, all with excellent reputations. If you need anything, feel free to purchase from them. I have some matters to attend to, so I won't disturb you further. I'll come find you when the exchange meeting begins."</p><p>"Please, go ahead, Fellow Daoist Han."</p><p>Qin Sang watched Han Cuo enter a stone hut. After a moment of contemplation, he began to explore the market.</p><p>He eventually selected a few trading companies and negotiated deals.</p><p>By now, the demonic corpses, magical artifacts, and most of the spirit stones in his Thousand Jun Ring had been exchanged for pills, talismans, and other supplies, ensuring he wouldn't need to worry about resupply for at least a decade or two.</p><p>He attempted to acquire some cultivation-enhancing pills, but those effective for Core Formation cultivators were far more expensive than he'd anticipated, and the limited supply in the market inflated their prices further.</p><p>Qin Sang kept some magical treasures and demon cores, intending to see if he could exchange them for desirable treasures at the inner exchange meeting.</p><p>Notably, he managed to trade for three Venomous Beast cores from one trading company, enough to sustain the Fat Silkworm until the late stage of its second transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang also purchased a large quantity of the spiritual herbs favored by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Even if he couldn't immediately reach the Thousand Demons Sea, Qin Sang wasn't planning to land on Tempest Island.  Given this rare opportunity, he naturally wanted to fully stock up.</p><p>His primary concern was the situation in the Thousand Demons Sea.</p><p>After some inquiries, Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly grave. The information gathered by these trading companies corroborated Han Cuo's account, confirming the route through the Thousand Demons Sea was impassable.</p><p>He tried to purchase information about alternative routes, but none were available.</p><p>Only one trading company representative suggested he try his luck at the inner exchange meeting in a few days. Perhaps some expert had discovered a new route through the Thousand Demons Sea, but such information was usually kept secret.  If Qin Sang was willing to offer sufficient compensation, he might be able to persuade someone to share.</p><p>After multiple unsuccessful inquiries, Qin Sang entered the inner section, rented a stone hut, and waited patiently.</p><p>Core Formation cultivators began to arrive even before the exchange meeting commenced.</p><p>Two days later, Qin Sang emerged from his stone hut and was surprised to find several fellow cultivators gathered in the small plaza outside, displaying their treasures and seemingly engaging in trades.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang strode towards them.</p><p>The cultivators in the plaza noticed his approach and glanced his way. Some nodded amicably, while others coldly averted their gaze.</p><p>As Qin Sang drew closer, he was somewhat disappointed by the items displayed by the outermost cultivators. These were treasures coveted by Foundation Establishment cultivators, but rather ordinary for Core Formation experts. It seemed they were saving their best treasures for the official exchange meeting.</p><p>"A poison pill?"</p><p>Just as disappointment set in, Qin Sang spotted a poison pill.  He walked over and, after some bargaining, purchased it.</p><p>Though the number of cultivators was small, they were spaced far apart to maintain privacy.</p><p>After exchanging for a few necessary items, Qin Sang reached the last cultivator, a thin middle-aged man sitting withered on a cushion.</p><p>The man's aura was strange, almost imperceptible. His face was unusually pale and gaunt, as if he'd suffered severe injuries and depleted his vital essence.</p><p>However, this could also be the result of some peculiar cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't stare indefinitely, so he quickly glanced over the man before turning his attention to the items displayed before him.</p><p>The man had a few jade bottles containing pills and a pile of demonic corpse materials, but not a single demon core.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to pass by and return to his stone hut, he suddenly noticed a familiar object.  His gaze fixed, and his heart stirred.</p><p>It was a piece of white bone, the size of a finger joint!</p><p>The hollow bone had a jade-like luster, identical to the piece of bone flute he'd obtained from the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>Back at the Violet Firmament Palace, he and Yun Youzi had fought the Shadow Leopard for the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit.  He'd eventually driven it away with the Void Thunder.</p><p>The residual power of the Void Thunder had shattered the gold ring around the Shadow Leopard's neck, revealing a piece of a bone flute.</p><p>At the time, they'd discovered the flute was connected to celestial power. It couldn't be stored in a storage pouch but was successfully placed inside Qin Sang's Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Yun Youzi had speculated that the bone flute might be a fragment of some greater treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had kept it but hadn't given it much thought.  After all, in the vast world of cultivation, the chances of finding another piece were incredibly slim.</p><p>Yet unexpectedly, he encountered a second piece here in the Azure Waves Sea, thousands of miles away.</p><p>There was no mistake, it was the same object!</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the bone flute, he sensed the identical aura.  Like the piece he possessed, it resonated with the power of the celestial stars!</p><p>How could fragments of the same treasure end up so far apart? What had happened?</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished and secretly alarmed.</p><p>Were these two pieces the entirety of the treasure?  What would happen if they were combined?</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang maintained a calm expression and casually stopped before the man.</p><p>The stall owner opened his eyes, saw Qin Sang, and asked in a raspy voice, "What has caught your eye, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Besides the bone flute, the items on display were mediocre.  And the uniqueness of the bone flute was obvious.</p><p>There was no chance of snagging a bargain.</p><p>However, the stall owner's hoarse voice, betraying his seemingly poor health, gave Qin Sang an idea.</p><p>He went straight to the point, pointing at the bone flute. "May I ask, Fellow Daoist, what is this piece of white bone? Might I examine it?"</p><p>The stall owner paused, his gaze subtly sweeping over Qin Sang's chest and surroundings. He nodded. "I don't know its name. If you wish to see it, feel free."</p><p>Qin Sang squatted down and, under the stall owner's watchful eye, gently picked up the bone flute for examination. He confirmed it was indeed the same object!</p>
