<h1>Chapter 1295:  A Change</h1><p>Qin Sang recounted the events of the Blood Lake battle.</p><p>Bai muttered about jade bones and silken skin…</p><p>“It must be some kind of life-saving secret technique, transforming oneself into something inhuman to survive. The mysterious person in the water prison, who forged his bones into a bone formation, had the same intention.”</p><p>Bai mused, “Such techniques aren't common. If I still had my memories, I could probably identify his origin. Are you certain his soul was completely destroyed?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “Senior Sister Qing Jun’s Azure Bird spirit puppet is like a second self.  She personally touched the jade bone while fighting Ye Laomo for it and confirmed the person's death before giving up.”</p><p>“Qing Jun?”</p><p>Bai nodded lightly, paused, then turned to ask about Ye Laomo. He was intensely interested, questioning every detail meticulously.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang's two encounters with Ye Laomo involved only his avatars; she never faced his true form.</p><p>The Battle of Twin Mirrors Mountain occurred...</p><p>Ye Laomo fell into a trap and fled again, wounded. Afterward, he rarely appeared, and Qin Sang never encountered him.</p><p>“Brother Bai, what are you suspecting?” Qin Sang curiously asked, seeing Bai's relentless questioning about Ye Laomo.</p><p>Bai said matter-of-factly, “Your feeling about the Dark Crystal Tower might not be an illusion! How did the Abyss discover the relationship between the Sinful Palace and the Purple Micro Palace? Where did the Dark Crystal Tower come from? How did they learn about the ancient cultivators trapped and surviving in Blood Lake? Ye Laomo's shadow is behind every event.  This number one figure in the North Star Realm must know many untold secrets!”</p><p>Qin Sang was certainly curious as well, but Ye Laomo was not easily dealt with.  As long as Ye Laomo's actions didn't threaten him, Qin Sang preferred not to fight him to the death; he still held a deep apprehension about Ye Laomo.</p><p>He had enough secrets of his own.</p><p>The Southern Ming Earth Fire and the fragments of the Killing Sword were only the beginning.</p><p>The celestial palace atop the Seven Killing Hall awaited exploration.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace was the only Nascent Soul inheritance Qin Sang knew of, with deep foundations. He possessed a token from Bao Zhengnan, allowing him to visit the Four Saints Palace legitimately in the future.</p><p>Unraveling these secrets might lead to opportunities for advancement to late Nascent Soul or even the Transformation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had many options and didn't need to fight Ye Laomo desperately. At least, he wouldn't actively seek trouble with Ye Laomo before breaking through to mid-Nascent Soul.</p><p>With the war settled and the Qingyang Temple established, Qin Sang intended to focus on his cultivation.</p><p>“Ye Laomo is cunning and has resolutely withdrawn his troops. We’ll soon reach Yu City; the Abyss will have no choice but to make their last stand. Brother Bai should have a chance to confront Ye Laomo then. Before that, however, I need your help…”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone turned cold, a glint of icy light in his eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Only Qin Sang and Qing Jun knew of Bai's return.</p><p>The next day, Qin Sang led his troops out of the city to pursue the enemy as usual. The Abyss no longer concealed its intentions; its various armies raced against time to move what they could from the grasslands, destroying what they couldn't carry, retreating toward Yu City like a swarm of locusts or a receding tide.</p><p>In this situation, eliminating the enemy was no longer Qin Sang's primary task; seizing resources was paramount.</p><p>Due to the vast expanse of the plains, by the third day, Qin Sang and Jing Yu had to split their forces. Jing Yu pursued the retreating remnants of the Abyss toward a small city, while Qin Sang changed direction to secure a spirit mine.</p><p>In the following days, they fought separately, with little chance of meeting.  Qing Jun was doing the same, growing increasingly distant.</p><p>Bai never appeared.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang’s army entered a city. The Abyss cultivators had already fled, not forgetting to destroy the city's spirit formations before leaving, leaving behind only ruins.  In the rubble, the powerless commoners watched the invading cultivators warily, awaiting their fate.</p><p>Even in a war between cultivators, ordinary people suffered.</p><p>Most cultivators wouldn’t harm civilians, but some were cruel.  Certain cultivators who practiced demonic cultivation and needed living souls, emboldened by the lack of restraint in enemy territory, went on killing sprees, slaughtering countless people.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun could only restrain their own troops to prevent such tragedies from happening near them.</p><p>“Master Uncle, the cultivator families in the city have all left, and the treasury has been emptied. The medicinal gardens outside the city have been destroyed.”  Li Yu Fu reported.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "Pass the order: we rest in the city tonight. Tomorrow, we set out directly for Yu City!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the place in the city with the strongest spiritual energy and used a spell to create a simple stone house.</p><p>"It seems your plan failed," Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>It turned out that after discovering Bai's breakthrough and considerable strength, Qin Sang had devised a plan to lure out the enemy.  They were about to force the Zu Yuan forces into Yu City.  After that, it would be either negotiations or a long stalemate—a chaotic situation like this wouldn't happen again. Once things stabilized, there would be no opportunity.</p><p>If the Duke of Dongyang harbored ill intentions, these few days were the perfect time to act. Killing Qin Sang could be blamed on the Zu Yuan.</p><p>With his senior sister and Jing Yu nearby, the Duke of Dongyang certainly wouldn't dare act rashly. So Qin Sang subtly separated from them, intentionally revealing a weakness.</p><p>With Bai's assistance, Qin Sang was confident that even if Ye Lao Mo and Cang Hong Zhenren arrived together, they could hold out until Jing Yu and his senior sister arrived.</p><p>Of course, this was the worst-case scenario, which Qin Sang considered extremely unlikely. These two old foxes wouldn't easily believe the Duke of Dongyang's information.</p><p>The main goal was to draw out the Duke of Dongyang and his accomplices.</p><p>However, everything had been normal for ten days. Qin Sang even deliberately kept a significant distance from Jing Yu.</p><p>He wondered if the Duke of Dongyang felt that taking on Qin Sang alone wasn't guaranteed success, so he was still biding his time, or if he truly prioritized the overall situation.</p><p>"An opponent of this cultivation level, the more patient they are, the harder they are to guard against. Fortunately, Mount Shaohua is his concern; he wouldn't dare use any means necessary against me, otherwise, it would be a big problem," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>At that moment, the barrier outside the stone house was suddenly triggered. Qin Sang scanned with his spiritual sense and found that it was Li Yu Fu returning in a hurry, holding a jade slip—an urgent report.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang take the jade slip and his expression suddenly change, Bai curiously asked,</p><p>"Brother Bai, you truly are a lucky star!"</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, his face changing constantly before finally uttering a nonsensical remark to Bai.  He handed the jade slip to Bai, saying incredulously, "News just arrived: Yu City is suddenly in chaos.  We don't know the reason... Brother Bai, you read it yourself!"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>This is the previous two chapters. I had written most of it last night and planned to finish it this morning, but unfortunately, one of my wisdom teeth was impacted and shattered. I had to rush to the hospital to have it extracted.</p><p>I've been in terrible pain all day, but I'm feeling a little better now.</p>
