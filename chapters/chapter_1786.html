<h1>Chapter 1777: The High God's Heavenly Palace</h1><p>Numerous flying chariots arrived one after another.</p><p>Thunderbolt Left Mansion disciples were at the forefront, followed by Lower Sect disciples, with Qin Sang and others standing outside the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around; only a dozen or so people were beside him, all fellow Outer Sect disciples.</p><p>Thousands of disciples came for the initiation ceremony, yet only a small number of external applicants were accepted, demonstrating the exceptional rarity of the High God's Heavenly Palace initiation.</p><p>The last flying chariot landed.</p><p>At this moment, the handsome young man who had brought Qin Sang here approached, walking on clouds. He addressed Qin Sang and the others, “Follow me to the Initiation Academy.”</p><p>A boy beside Qin Sang, unable to contain his curiosity, pointed at the large group ahead and asked, "Aren't they going?"</p><p>Qin Sang was equally puzzled.</p><p>During his wait, the Thunderbolt Left Mansion had organized aptitude tests for all disciples attending the initiation.</p><p>He was exempted from the test due to possessing a thunder talisman.</p><p>Could there be more trials ahead?</p><p>The handsome youth glanced sideways, "They are disciples from our Main and Lower Sects. Before the initiation, they must undergo another test. While they generally don't eliminate many, those who think they can rest easy here, heh…"</p><p>The handsome youth chuckled meaningfully, "However, you are not disciples of our sect.  You don't need to undergo the test; simply wait three days at the Initiation Academy."</p><p>Hearing this, the other youths visibly relaxed. Qin Sang, however, understood.  This test was probably designed to assess the disciples' temperament, comprehension, and such.</p><p>The handsome youth led them into the air.</p><p>Thunderbolt Left Mansion disciples watched them pierce the thunderclouds, their expressions complex, many feeling anxious.</p><p>The waters surrounding the island were covered by thick thunderclouds.</p><p>Entering the clouds, it was initially pitch black, then deafening thunder filled their ears, with streaks of lightning dancing around them.</p><p>Having only recently begun their cultivation, they had never experienced such a scene. Each of them turned pale, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A lightning bolt struck towards them, causing an immediate outcry.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid.”</p><p>The handsome youth calmly raised his hand, grabbed the lightning, and played with it in his hand; the raging lightning became surprisingly docile.</p><p>Seeing this, the other youths felt a mix of fear, envy, and anticipation—by receiving the High God's Heavenly Palace initiation, they too could possess such abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully.</p><p>The moment he grasped the lightning, the handsome youth used a type of thunder talisman. However, he didn’t take out a physical talisman, nor did he summon an altar or draw a talisman in the air; the talisman manifested simply through his intent.</p><p>As they spoke, the handsome youth flew higher and higher, surrounded by countless thunderbolts.</p><p>A massive dark shadow emerged from the depths of the thunderclouds.  As they drew closer, it revealed itself to be a grand hall.</p><p>This hall floated within the thunderclouds, surrounded by lightning, seemingly protected by an invisible barrier that kept the lightning out.</p><p>The words ‘Initiation Academy’ were inscribed on the hall. A jade staircase extended downward from the plaza in front of the hall, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>"We're here. Wait here and don't wander off."</p><p>The handsome youth set them down, turned, and flew back.</p><p>The group exchanged glances, finding places to settle. Qin Sang, showing no emotion, surveyed his surroundings and sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p>Three days passed in a flash.</p><p>From noon on the second day, people began to climb up the jade staircase, increasing in number. As the handsome youth had said, over 90% of the disciples passed the test.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The sound of bells and drums echoed throughout the heavens.</p><p>The main gate of the Initiation Academy opened, and a Daoist priest in a high crown emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang then witnessed elaborate ceremonies unlike anything seen in the Three Suns Gate. The Daoist priest alone spent half an hour reciting the initiation procedures before allowing everyone to enter the Initiation Academy.</p><p>Two lines of Thunderbolt Left Mansion disciples, carrying banners and flags, filed out to guide everyone into the Initiation Academy.</p><p>The layout inside was similar to the Three Suns Gate.</p><p>A large incense burner stood in the vast plaza, emitting swirling smoke.</p><p>The smoke dissipated instantly upon leaving the burner. The disciples felt an unprecedented clarity in their minds; evidently, a special incense was burning within.</p><p>However, the plaque above the main hall was different.</p><p>“Thunder Ancestor Hall!”</p><p>Seeing these three powerful characters, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly as he looked inside the hall.</p><p>The main entrance to the Thunder Ancestor Hall was open, revealing the interior.</p><p>An altar stood in the center of the hall. Behind the altar, instead of a statue, a divine image hung.</p><p>The image depicted a divine being, with a profound and solemn demeanor, clearly the work of a master.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable!</p><p>Qin Sang felt that this divine image was not a magic treasure, likely just a painting. Yet, for some reason, gazing at this divine being, he unconsciously felt a sense of awe, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p>‘Dang…dang…’</p><p>The sound of chimes echoed, silencing the courtyard as they awaited the arrival of the three masters: the Transmission Master, the Supervision Master, and the Recommendation Master.</p><p>Six protector masters also arrived: the Protection Master, the Dharma Protection Master, the Scripture Protection Master, the Altar Protection Master, the Precept Protection Master, and the Path Protection Master.</p><p>Incense burning, paying respects, worshipping the deity, visiting the ancestors, performing rituals, opening the altar…</p><p>Though not as meticulous as Daoist rituals, the entire process took three full hours.</p><p>The newly initiated disciples, barely having entered the Dao and lacking any magical power, were all aching and exhausted, yet dared not show the slightest carelessness.</p><p>Before the final initiation, they had to perform a repentance ceremony.</p><p>This repentance, or *bai chan*, involved appeasing the deities and confessing sins.</p><p>Led by the master, everyone chanted the *Chao Tian Bao Chan* (Morning Heavenly Treasure Repentance). While others sincerely performed the repentance, Qin Sang secretly sneered.  His hands were stained with blood from his cultivation; if the repentance scripture were true, how could the deities possibly tolerate him?</p><p>Finally, the ceremony reached its most crucial step – the initiation!</p><p>The recommending master stood before the Lei Zu Hall, reciting the names of the disciples.  Those whose names were called entered the hall for initiation.</p><p>Naturally, the outer sect disciples were last. By the time it was Qin Sang’s turn, few disciples remained in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stepped forward, bowed deeply, and entered the hall.</p><p>The officiating master was a white-bearded elder with early Yuan Ying cultivation. He glanced at Qin Sang and then looked away.</p><p>Since Qin Sang wasn't a disciple of the main Thunder Left Manor lineage, the officiating master didn’t offer any guidance. Without a word, he activated the altar.</p><p>A golden seal hung high above the altar.</p><p>A blank talisman appeared before Qin Sang. As his blood and consciousness merged with it, the seal was impressed, and the talisman split in two.</p><p>One part entered Qin Sang’s forehead; the other, guided by the officiating master’s hand, flew back to the altar and ignited spontaneously.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, the talisman burned to ash, the flame extinguished, its essence ascending to the heavens.</p><p>Among cultivators, this step is figuratively referred to as establishing a celestial contract, giving one a name in the Heavenly Court.</p><p>Qin Sang knelt on a cushion, his eyes closed, motionless, seemingly experiencing something profound.</p><p>For disciples of the main Thunder Left Manor lineage, the initiation would be followed by the bestowal of the three refuges and nine precepts of Daoism. Thunder Left Manor disciples typically choose three of the nine precepts, adhering strictly to them, at least in the Zhengyi (Orthodox Unity) rank.</p><p>This is the initial voyage into the faith, the first step on the path of the Dao; it must be approached with utmost caution.</p><p>Qin Sang, not being a main lineage disciple, was exempt from these formalities.</p><p>The officiating master waved his whisk. The recommending master outside the hall announced the next name.</p><p>As if awakened, Qin Sang bowed his head, rose, and retreated from the hall. As he exited, someone approached carrying a wooden tray.</p><p>Thunder Left Manor disciples are bestowed with robes, artifacts, and other items. Qin Sang received only a single, unadorned jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them, took the jade slip, and followed the attendant out of the initiation hall.</p><p>Once the initiation ceremonies were complete, someone escorted Qin Sang and the other outer disciples back to the Guest Island.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't plan to stay. He immediately boarded a treasure ship and left the Thunder Left Manor.</p><p>Standing at the stern, Qin Sang gazed at the receding Thunder Left Manor, lost in thought.</p><p>The initiation process was smoother than expected. The Thunder Left Manor didn’t suspect him in the slightest, and the altar showed no unusual reactions to his cultivation level.</p><p>Shortly after leaving the Thunder Left Manor, Qin Sang disembarked on a small island, rented a cave dwelling, and eagerly examined his talisman!</p><p>“Exalted God of the Upper Heaven Soaring Firmament Talisman!”</p><p>In his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his consciousness sinking into his Purple Mansion.</p><p>There, a golden talisman shone brightly. Each time he sensed the talisman, Qin Sang felt a blood connection, a sense of complete unity.</p><p>This was the talisman he had received – the Talisman of the Supreme One, the Zhengyi Boy-Attendant Spirit Official General Talisman.</p><p>The talisman wasn't physical but ethereal, composed of enigmatic symbols, resembling a transparent spiritual amulet.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang needed to forge an altar.</p><p>Once the altar was forged, the talisman would manifest as a seal within it.</p><p>However, even before the altar was forged, Qin Sang felt a difference.</p><p>A few strands of faint true essence returned to his empty dantian. Without using his consciousness to suppress them, he felt the long-lost stability of his true essence.</p><p>Furthermore, this true essence was derived from refining the world's elemental energy.  It required no complicated steps; within certain limits, he could directly draw elemental energy into his body.  As it entered, it seemed to be filtered, returning to a normal state.</p><p>He flipped his hand, producing a spirit stone from this world, and he could directly absorb its spiritual energy as well.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself in understanding the talisman.  Subtly, a mysterious force seemed to protect him, isolating him from the chaotic energies of the world, shielding his true essence from external influence.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the source of this mysterious power.  When he delved into the talisman, he felt a vast expanse, seemingly in the highest heavens, yet profound and weighty – contradictory sensations that eluded his understanding.</p><p>For now, he would believe the Daoist legends.</p><p>Of course, the protection offered by the talisman is limited.  When his true energy surpasses the Foundation Establishment stage, exceeding the talisman's limit, the chaotic energies of heaven and earth will still affect his true energy.</p><p>Generally, cultivators in this realm who reach the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, will receive a second-order talisman before attempting a breakthrough.</p><p>Otherwise, without the talisman's protection, external influences will cause the true energy to become unstable. Even if a breakthrough occurs, it must be suppressed to the Foundation Establishment level.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang didn't rush into creating the altar. He took out the jade slip he obtained from the Left Thunder Mansion and began to examine it.</p><p>The jade slip's contents were primarily divided into three parts.</p><p>First, various key points for creating the altar.</p><p>It listed several spiritual materials suitable for a golden seal altar, mostly thunder-attribute spiritual objects, with almost no mention of military altars.</p><p>After all, outside the Daoist sect, most cultivators lack the ability to raise armies, and even within the Left Thunder Mansion's inner circle, those cultivating military altars are few and far between.</p><p>Second, a "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Celestial Guide."</p><p>The guide depicted the sacred images and names of various Thunder Department deities for the purpose of summoning them.</p><p>Creating the altar and summoning deities are both mandatory procedures after receiving the talisman.</p><p>Standard-bearers, jade light boys, thunder light girls, thunder master boys, hail master boys, west platform wind and rain officials, wind and cloud controllers, lightning-striking thunder-running cloud envoys, cloud envoys, hail-summoning warriors, evil-crushing warriors…</p><p>One sacred image after another flowed through Qin Sang's consciousness.</p><p>After reviewing all the images, Qin Sang discovered that the Left Thunder Mansion primarily worshipped Thunder Department deities, and the deities in the guide were all of the jade girl, boy, envoy, and warrior types.</p><p>This is normal; each level of talisman requires the contemplation of the corresponding level of deity. If the level is exceeded, it's impossible to summon a protective deity for the altar.</p><p>Even if the summoning were successful, the altar would likely not be able to withstand it, leading to its destruction.</p><p>In the "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Celestial Guide," most of the sacred images were gray; only three were bright: the Purple Light Jade Girl, the Wind and Cloud Controller, and the Water Thunder Lightning General.</p><p>This indicates that these three deities are the easiest to contemplate.</p><p>Contemplating other deities would likely consume a vast amount of time and energy, ultimately failing to summon a protective deity.</p><p>Contemplation is not guaranteed to succeed. It requires prolonged visualization of the sacred image, sensing the celestial will, and the higher the deity's rank, the more difficult it becomes.</p><p>The entire guide only listed three deities; it's unknown whether the Left Thunder Mansion was concealing something.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the Left Thunder Mansion had no need to hide anything. He guessed that outsiders who didn't cultivate the Left Thunder Mansion's techniques would find their talismans incompatible, only allowing them to contemplate these three deities.</p><p>Continuing further, the third part was an incantation called the "Morning True Jade Talisman Incantation."</p><p>This incantation is to be practiced when contemplating the protective deity.</p><p>"Should I contemplate a deity?"</p><p>Seeing that most of the jade slip's contents related to deity summoning, Qin Sang held the jade slip, lost in thought.</p><p>He was curious about the actual existence of deities.</p><p>Are the protective deities truly the descent of divine will, or a projection of the mental image created when visualizing their sacred images?</p><p>If it's a mental projection, why can some deities be summoned, while others fail?</p><p>However, actively summoning a deity gave Qin Sang an uneasy feeling.</p><p>Ultimately, it was because of the jade Buddha. The origins of the so-called deities were unclear, and to protect the secret of the jade Buddha, Qin Sang instinctively resisted the entry of external deities.</p><p>In fact, contemplating a deity isn't necessary.  Seeing the demonic talisman from the snake demon, Qin Sang realized he could contemplate his inner true energy as the protective deity, also called an inner deity.</p><p>As far as he knew, demonic talismans all contemplated inner true energy; this was one of the biggest differences between demonic talismans and Daoist talismans.</p><p>This situation also existed among some cultivators in the Jushan region.</p><p>Due to various reasons, some sects' talismans received no response from either their main deities or any others, unable to summon deities, and were thus forced to contemplate inner true energy.</p><p>However, it's said that inner true energy is less stable than a deity, and cultivators practicing this method face a difficult and precarious cultivation path, a choice made out of necessity.</p><p>Possessing the jade Buddha, he didn't need a protective deity. But he still wanted to use the altar to protect the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to contemplate his inner true energy.</p><p>Perhaps, because of the jade Buddha, his contemplated inner true energy would be more stable than others.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang skipped over the "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Celestial Guide," memorized the "Morning True Jade Talisman Incantation," and focused his consciousness, preparing to create the altar.</p><p>Before creating the altar, the most important thing was to comprehend the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the various methods he had gathered, and once again immersed himself in the talisman.</p><p>Gradually, a talisman-like shape appeared in his mind.</p><p>(End)</p>
