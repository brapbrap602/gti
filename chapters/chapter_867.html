<h1>Chapter 859: The Rain Desert</h1><p>The young man surnamed Fang had invited five people. When hunting the demon beast, Qin Sang and the others would control the Glacial Gale Formation.</p><p>"There was a slight mishap with the last Glacial Stele. It won't be ready until tomorrow. Fellow Daoist Qin, please observe Fellow Daoist Qiu and the others practicing the formation. Once I've finished refining the stele, we'll set off immediately."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang gave these instructions, then flew to the icy pond above, took out an incomplete crystal stele, absorbed the cold air, and began refining it.</p><p>Qin Sang greeted the others one by one and found a place to sit quietly by the pond.</p><p>The burly man surnamed Qiu, whose real name was Qiu Ji, called the others to practice the formation. In order to let Qin Sang clearly see every change and keep up, they deliberately slowed down.</p><p>Another cultivator Qin Sang had met was named Chu Heng.</p><p>The other two were called Luo Kun and Ma Debao.</p><p>They were once rogue cultivators, but now they had been recruited as retainers by sects near Tianxing Island. To avoid restrictions, they hadn't joined any major powers.</p><p>Chu Heng was most proficient in formations and restrictions. The formation's core for the Glacial Gale Formation was controlled by Chu Heng, and he was now leading the others in practice.</p><p>Luo Kun, a man of few words, nodded slightly to Qin Sang as a greeting.</p><p>The cultivator named Ma Debao, however, had a less pleasing appearance. Two small eyes were embedded in his large, round face, and his eyeballs darted around. When he looked at Qin Sang, it seemed as if he were blatantly trying to pry into his secrets.</p><p>Including Qin Sang, all five were mid-stage Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the changes in the formation, his gaze inadvertently falling on the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>Earlier, when following the young man into the cave, Qin Sang, out of caution, had awakened the Skyeye Butterfly to prevent any treachery or hidden restrictions within the cave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he didn't see any ambush but discovered something unusual about the young man.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Qin Sang wouldn't rashly let the Skyeye Butterfly use its Skyeye ability to spy on others. Core Formation cultivators had sharp spiritual senses, and being discovered could create enemies.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly didn't directly probe into the young man's secrets, so it went unnoticed. However, there seemed to be a layer of mist around him, which even the Skyeye Butterfly couldn't penetrate.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly's ability had been proven many times. It could not only see through illusions but also easily discern disguises.</p><p>During the breakout from Yuheng Island, the late-stage Core Formation demon fish, which had consumed Emperor Flow Nectar, tried to ambush him, but its movements were seen through by the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>Also, the cultivators of the Western Gloom Alliance not long ago had fallen prey to Qin Sang because of the Skyeye Butterfly's ability.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang seemed to possess some kind of treasure or technique that could conceal himself and resist prying eyes, rendering the Skyeye Butterfly ineffective.</p><p>Qiu Ji and the others increased the speed of their formation practice.</p><p>After observing it once, Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and he no longer had the mind to think about other things. The Glacial Gale Formation was more complex than he had anticipated, and with the Glacial Stele incomplete, they could only demonstrate part of its changes.</p><p>For the five of them to fully grasp the formation and use it against a late-stage Core Formation demon, they would likely have to practice non-stop on their way to the demon's lair.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to slack off, carefully memorizing every change. Unknowingly, a day passed.</p><p>At noon the next day, the young man surnamed Fang finally finished refining the Glacial Stele. After a brief discussion, they decided to set off immediately.</p><p>To save time, they chose not to travel by boat. The young man took out a flying treasure. They took turns controlling the treasure while the others practiced the formation.</p><p>After leaving the island, the young man steered the treasure due north. Its light streaked across the sea like a meteor.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fang, you've been so secretive. Even now, you're unwilling to reveal any information.  Could the demon beast's lair be in the Rain Desert of the North Sea?"</p><p>Ma Debao stroked his mustache and asked in a shrill voice.</p><p>The young man lifted his eyelids and smiled faintly. "Fellow Daoist Ma, you worry too much. The distance from Tianxing Island to the Rain Desert is vast, not a journey of just one or two years.  You would all grow impatient before reaching halfway.  Our destination is on the edge of the North Sea, only two months away. When we arrive at the beast's lair, you'll know what kind of demon it is."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. If the journey took too long, he would have to reconsider.</p><p>The Rain Desert they spoke of was a peculiar area deep in the North Sea, close to the storm belt.</p><p>Some tried to divide the Inner Sea into four quadrants, but in reality, the Inner Sea's shape was irregular, roughly a long north-south strip.</p><p>Previously, when searching for Senior Qingzhu, Qin Sang had traveled to the Cleftwind Islands in the southwest quadrant. If he had continued westward, he would have soon reached the storm belt on the western side of the Inner Sea.</p><p>But heading north would take much longer, and the first area reached would be a region of constant torrential rain, known as the Rain Desert.</p><p>It was said that the North Sea was the region most affected by the storm belt, especially the Rain Desert.  The ceaseless downpour and lack of sunlight made it uninhabitable for mortals.</p><p>Therefore, except for islands with spirit veins that might have cultivators, other islands were desolate. While not as chaotic as the Cleftwind Islands, it was undoubtedly the most desolate and lonely region of the Inner Sea.</p><p>Qiu Ji exclaimed softly, "Within the Inner Sea, and not even in the Rain Desert, and this great demon hasn't been hunted by powerful cultivators?"</p><p>"The vile beast lives well, and is extremely rampant."</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang nodded.  "The reason I discovered this beast is because a friend of mine's merchant fleet was attacked. Not only were their goods completely destroyed, but my friend nearly lost his life. He managed to escape, but was severely injured, his foundation ruined, and his cultivation completely gone. He's now a cripple. I'm hunting this beast to avenge him."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fang, your righteousness..."</p><p>The escaping light sped on, and quiet returned within the flying treasure. Qin Sang and the others focused on practicing the formation. The young man surnamed Fang, controlling the treasure, watched the monotonous sea, his eyes flickering.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after they left, several shadowy figures appeared at the edge of the island.</p><p>These people were strangely dressed in black robes, as if they didn't want to be seen.  There was one exception: the shopkeeper from Tianxing City.</p><p>The shopkeeper's expression was cautious and ingratiating as he faced these people.</p><p>"Senior Brother has already taken his people. We should also depart. Junior Brother, after we leave, you will contact those late-stage old fogies. Make sure to keep them on our side, so we have enough people when we need them. We won't need them for now, but Senior Brother said the information he received might not be accurate, and there could be complications."</p><p>One of the black-robed figures turned to stare at the shopkeeper. From his voice, it was the same person who had traded with Qin Sang in Tianxing City.</p><p>The shopkeeper nodded repeatedly, "Rest assured, Senior Brother. I will do my utmost."</p>
