Chapter 563: A Startling Discovery


After all the Star Essence Stones were drawn together by hand seals, forming a shimmering, embryonic spirit array in the air, Red Hair chuckled and looked towards Daoist Zhenyi. "Old goat, time to bring out the array materials."

Daoist Zhenyi remained silent, his face grim. With a wave of his hand, he tossed out a mustard seed pouch. The pouch opened in mid-air, and a stream of various spiritual objects poured out.

These objects were a feast for the eyes, even for Qin Sang and the others. Each one was a rare treasure in the cultivation world.  Many of them Qin Sang had not even heard of, let alone seen.

The Little North Star Essence Array, like a gold-devouring beast, demanded so many precious materials!

After these objects appeared, Daoist Zhenyi and the other three Nascent Soul cultivators continued to maintain the embryonic form of the array. Now it was the turn of the other Nascent Soul cultivators to contribute.

Powerful streams of true essence enveloped the spiritual objects, refining them one by one.

At this moment, the Little North Star Essence Array underwent dazzling transformations. Qin Sang widened his eyes, trying to learn something, but after a while, he felt dizzy and mentally exhausted, so he had to give up.

Instead, he chose to imprint this scene in his mind, hoping to comprehend it later.

With so many Nascent Soul cultivators working together, the array formation progressed rapidly.

A quarter of an hour later, the last spiritual object was embedded into the grand array.  The embryonic form of the array vanished, replaced by an area of utter darkness, like a black hole appearing beneath a swirling vortex of wind and clouds.

Suddenly, a single point of starlight ignited within the black hole.

Then, one star after another lit up in succession.

In the blink of an eye, within that small black hole, countless stars twinkled brilliantly, resembling a miniature version of the night sky.

Just like the real night sky, stars flickered and died, galaxies flowed, and meteors streaked across the darkness. It all seemed incredibly real.

At the center of this miniature cosmos, one star shone exceptionally bright, as if all the others were its companions.

This star was the eye of the Little North Star Essence Array, named Polaris.

And it grew increasingly brighter.

'Boom!'

A sudden change occurred.

A dazzling beam of light descended from the heavens, effortlessly piercing the wind and cloud vortex. It landed precisely on the Polaris star within the array.

Within the beam of light resided a peculiar power, of the same origin as the Star Essence Stones.  The Little North Star Essence Array could actually draw upon the power of the celestial stars!

This power was unfamiliar to Qin Sang, but he had heard of cultivation techniques that utilized celestial star power. However, no one would dare to channel so much stellar energy into their body.

Even a Nascent Soul cultivator would explode!

Infused with the celestial star power, not only Polaris, but the entire Little North Star Essence Array began to stir.

At this moment, the four-colored cloud formations nearby suddenly dispersed.

Treasures like palaces and warships were recalled by their owners.

Everyone was abruptly exposed beneath the wind and cloud vortex, facing its terrifying pressure head-on.

Just as Qin Sang and the others were filled with apprehension, they heard Duke Dongyang's voice. "The five of you, follow Lady Chenyan closely and form the Beast Seal Array. When we breach the immortal array, focus solely on maintaining the Beast Seal Array.  Do not concern yourselves with anything else. Remember, no matter what happens, do not panic, and absolutely do not reveal the aura of the ferocious souls within the Beast Seals!"

Qin Sang felt slightly reassured. He glanced at Chenyan, who stood impassively beside Duke Dongyang, her peerless beauty hidden beneath her cloak.

Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai, and the others flew to positions behind Chenyan and began to activate their Beast Seals as instructed.

Feng Ming, Iron Crown, and the others followed suit, relying on Duke Dongyang's protection.

They had long practiced the various formations of the Five Elements Beast Seals to perfection.

This was a purely defensive formation. Linked by their Beast Seals, the five of them became as one.  With the power of the Beast Seals, they could withstand attacks exceeding their own cultivation levels, but they couldn't counterattack.

Seeing five Foundation Establishment cultivators among Duke Dongyang's subordinates, a rare sight, the other Nascent Soul cultivators glanced over, but no one interfered.

Even if they were all wiped out, they were Duke Dongyang's disciples.  Some would even be pleased to see it.

Qin Sang, however, wasn't worried about his life at all.

Protected by the Beast Seal Array and Chenyan's covert assistance, the five of them were certainly safe.

This formation was the simplest one. While activating his Beast Seal, Qin Sang could still observe his surroundings.

Empowered by the continuous flow of celestial star power, the Little North Star Essence Array grew increasingly magnificent. The Polaris star almost transformed into a true celestial body.

The Nascent Soul cultivators, including Duke Dongyang, surrounded the Little North Star Essence Array, each wielding their magical treasures to protect their disciples.

The Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly March Alliance remained clearly separated, each following their strongest cultivators.

The Feathered Demon King, seemingly still recovering, stood alone. His demonic beasts lacked the Purple Subtlety Secrets but were also allowed to enter the Little North Star Essence Array.

Each Nascent Soul Patriarch possessed mystical and powerful magical treasures.  The lowest quality among them were Middle-Grade Magical Treasures, with many being High-Grade.

However, no Top-Grade Magical Treasures appeared.  Qin Sang wondered if these Nascent Soul cultivators were holding back.

As Qin Sang was engrossed in observing the awe-inspiring power of the magical treasures, his gaze inadvertently swept across a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Suddenly, his eyes narrowed, and his expression shifted slightly.

This cultivator's magical treasure was the very same Black Tortoise Shell he had seen in the Boundless Valley!

There could be no mistake!

Qin Sang couldn't help but take another look.  This Black Tortoise Shell was incredibly unique; there couldn't be another identical one.

Perhaps due to time constraints, or perhaps it wasn't necessary, the cultivator manipulated the Black Tortoise Shell above his head, forming only nine surfaces to protect his disciples, not the grand formation of eighty-one surfaces he had used against the Thunder Swallowing Falcon.

What truly shocked Qin Sang was the cultivator's identity.  He was the same yellow-robed Daoist who had initially assisted Red Hair and the others in setting up the array. He was a member of the Heavenly March Alliance!

"Hissâ€¦"

A deep unease welled up within Qin Sang.

He had initially suspected the Black Tortoise Shell's wielder to be a demonic cultivator, never imagining they would be from the Heavenly March Alliance.

What was the relationship between this person and the Wuji Sect Master?

As Yun Youzi had said, in this world, Nascent Soul cultivators represented the pinnacle of power, free to act as they pleased within certain boundaries. Even having connections with cultivators from opposing factions wasn't unusual.

Yet, Qin Sang still felt something was amiss.

Back then, when they had entered the Boundless Valley together, both were clad in black robes, concealing their true identities.

Their first encounter had been shortly after entering the inner valley.

Neither had used magical treasures or special spells.  If not for the predicament caused by the light released from the restrictions, which trapped them both, the cultivator wouldn't have resorted to the Black Tortoise Shell.

Their second encounter was during the battle with the Thunder Swallowing Falcon.  That location was shrouded in endless Black Frost Winds and located in the deepest part of the Boundless Valley, within the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's nest, a place even Nascent Soul cultivators struggled to reach.
