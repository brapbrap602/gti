<h1>Chapter 1816: Awakening</h1><p>The monstrous bull opened its maw and spewed a torrent of silver mist.  The mist, thick with demonic qi and emitting an intensely foul odor, formed a tempestuous storm out of thin air, surging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a sinister aura within the mist.  His mind stirred, and a flash of lightning shot out from between his eyebrows, manifesting the form of a divine rune in midair.</p><p>It wasn't just one divine rune, but three!</p><p>The Jade Pure Lightning Summoning Rune.</p><p>The Flowing Gold Fire Bell Lightning Summoning Rune.</p><p>And the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Rune!</p><p>Although the Jade Pure Lightning Summoning Rune and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Lightning Summoning Rune were divine runes carrying first and second-tier spells, the fact they could become spells meant they were undoubtedly the painstaking work of Daoist sages, profoundly mystical and not to be regarded as ordinary runes.</p><p>As a cultivator's cultivation increased, the power of the divine runes would also grow. They could still serve as protective divine abilities, easily summoned and dismissed at will.</p><p>More importantly, spells of the same lineage could amplify each other.  By comprehending the divine runes, one could merge them, channeling qi through them.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang's understanding of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Rune was not the end.  The ultimate Five Thunders Seal would be achieved only when he could merge all three runes, channeling qi through them as one.</p><p>He could currently merge the Jade Pure Lightning Summoning Rune and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Lightning Summoning Rune, but comprehending the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Rune required the Void Refinement Realm, and merging all three runes was even further out of reach.</p><p>However, casting the first two runes followed by the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Rune could still enhance its thunderous might.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder materialized out of nowhere.</p><p>The battlefield above was instantly illuminated, bathing the night sky in light.  Streaks of lightning danced across the heavens, and in a flash, a torrential downpour of thunder erupted.</p><p>What descended wasn't just lightning, but also balls of thunderfire.</p><p>Thunderfire filled the sky, dyeing the heavens.  It was as if a celestial being had kicked over a cauldron, sending its contents crashing down from the heavens.  Above the sea of fire, a god-like phantom truly appeared.</p><p>Riding a divine chariot, trailed by raging flames, amidst the roar of heaven and earth, the phantom, like a Thunder General patrolling the heavens, vanished in an instant, leaving behind endless thunderfire.</p><p>Within the Myriad Gods Thunder Office Celestial Invitation, there was indeed a deity named the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Great General, the only deity in the second-tier spells that could be summoned.</p><p>At this moment, although not a true god, the thunderfire it brought forth was immense, as if it could incinerate mountains and boil the seas.</p><p>For a time,</p><p>Lightning danced wildly, and flowing fire descended from the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thunderous roar shook heaven and earth.</p><p>A blinding white light illuminated the battlefield.  A Heavenly Thunder Seal formed, its might unsurpassed.  Compared to this radiant thunder light, the lightning and thunderfire seemed to dim.</p><p>With all three runes unleashed, evil was banished and corruption was purged.</p><p>The demonic qi approaching Qin Sang dispersed, annihilated by the divine thunder, revealing the monstrous bull charging forward.</p><p>‘Dong, dong, dong…’</p><p>Thunderfire rained down, relentlessly bombarding the monstrous bull, the sound like the beating of war drums.</p><p>The monstrous bull roared in fury.  The antlers on its head emitted a strange glow, transforming into jade-like crystalline antlers.  Then, the tips of the antlers shimmered with silver light.</p><p>The silver light spun, rapidly expanding.</p><p>In an instant, a giant silver disc appeared in the void, intercepting the thunderfire.  As it rotated faster and faster, it finally transformed into a silver wheel, hurtling towards Qin Sang.</p><p>One could tell at a glance that the silver wheel was incredibly sharp, capable of dismembering anyone with the slightest carelessness.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The silver wheel flew towards him, slicing through the void, arriving before Qin Sang in the blink of an eye.  He didn't dodge or flinch, raising his right palm, facing the silver wheel head-on.</p><p>Compared to the wheel, his palm seemed incredibly fragile, yet it wasn't cut open.  He firmly grasped the silver wheel in his hand.</p><p>At this moment, a fragment of the True Treasure appeared in his palm, transforming into ripples of water that blocked the silver wheel.</p><p>Seeing this, even the enraged monstrous bull couldn't help but pause, then became even more furious, charging directly at Qin Sang, using its antlers as weapons.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.  With a bend and thrust of his arm, he deflected the silver wheel, sending it past him.  Simultaneously, his figure flickered, appearing beside the monstrous bull in a ghostly manner, his fists heavily pounding the bull's shoulders.</p><p>The monstrous bull stumbled, but its hide was thick and tough, and these injuries weren't enough to be fatal.</p><p>Unless other ferocious beasts were attracted, Qin Sang wasn't eager for a quick victory. He relied on his powerful defenses to spar with the bull, using the Gray Warbler Sword for the main attack.</p><p>Sword stars continuously fell from the sky, leaving wounds on the monstrous bull. Qin Sang used the bull to test and refine his swordsmanship, confirming his previous insights.</p><p>The monstrous bull fell into the same predicament as Marquis Li, nearly driven mad.  The prey before it seemed to be covered in a shell, its usually unstoppable power meeting its nemesis today.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the monstrous bull fought, the ancient trees in the jungle withered in large swaths.</p><p>This was because the wood spiritual qi was being drained.  As the Wood Spirit Body continuously absorbed it, an aura of death gradually permeated the jungle.</p><p>Such a conspicuous sign, if encountered by an opponent with normal intelligence, would immediately reveal Qin Sang's reliance and allow them to devise a counter-strategy.</p><p>Unfortunately, the monstrous bull only possessed brute strength.</p><p>…</p><p>The celestial stars shifted.</p><p>A sword light originated from the first lunar mansion, Kui, shooting towards the other mansions. After six jumps, it finally landed in the Zi mansion.  With each jump, the sword light solidified, and when it shot out from Zi, it had practically become a real spiritual sword.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>Like an Immortal Slaying Sword, it slashed squarely onto the monstrous bull, piercing its armor-like back, deep enough to see bone, sending blood gushing.</p><p>The monstrous bull cried out in pain, its howls piercing. The tumors on its back ruptured one after another, spraying dark red pus and blood, which then condensed into clumps, transforming into snake-like creatures.</p><p>The creatures' tails were connected to the monstrous bull, their upper bodies serpentine. There were nine in total, all glaring at Qin Sang with menacing eyes, a truly grotesque sight.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, momentarily unsure whether these were manifestations of the bull's divine ability or another ferocious beast parasitizing it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thunder runes were unleashed again.</p><p>The nine monstrous snakes were annihilated by the divine thunder, but immediately reformed, intertwining with each other and transforming into a giant python.</p><p>The monstrous bull and the monstrous snake, truly like two ferocious beasts, coordinated flawlessly, attacking Qin Sang from both sides.</p><p>The monstrous snake spewed a bloody mist, quickly enveloping a large part of the void. The mist emitted a nauseating smell and possessed considerable power.</p><p>Others might have been flustered, but Qin Sang, cultivating both body and Dharma, didn't find it too difficult to handle.</p><p>He showed no weakness, wielding his powerful arms, fiercely attacking the monstrous bull, while the Gray Warbler Sword locked onto the monstrous snake.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky brightened.</p><p>The night sky vanished as Qin Sang withdrew the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.  Then, seven phantoms appeared out of thin air beside the monstrous snake, instantly transforming into brilliant sword light.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>The Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation could attack, defend, and trap, making it extremely versatile, especially when combined with his powerful physique. Since comprehending this sword formation, Qin Sang had rarely used the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The seven swords of slaughter intertwined, merging into a world-shaking killing sword, carrying boundless killing intent as it slashed down.</p><p>‘噗!’ (Pu! - SFX for stabbing/piercing)</p><p>A sword light pierced through the monstrous snake's head, running along its long body, splitting it in two on the spot.</p><p>The pus and blood separated into nine clumps, writhing and twisting, then reforming into snake shapes.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to see what the monstrous snakes truly were, so the Seven Souls Killing Formation only targeted the snake.  Now it seemed that after reforming, the snake's aura had weakened, while the monstrous bull roared repeatedly, suggesting it was the bull's divine ability rather than another beast.</p><p>The instant the nine monstrous snakes reformed, the Gray Warbler Sword trembled. A subtle, almost imperceptible sword light shot from its tip, flashing into the forehead of one of the snakes.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was fighting the monstrous bull, paused slightly. This attack seemed to have taken a considerable toll on his mind.</p><p>The snake suddenly stiffened, exploding with a bang.</p><p>Without warning, another snake beside it also froze, its head bursting into pus and blood, leaving only its writhing body behind.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, shaking his head slightly.</p><p>He had obtained a sword technique from the Cheng Ying Sword inheritance but hadn't fully grasped it yet.  Using it now proved to be quite strenuous.</p><p>After another round of fighting, the monstrous bull had exhausted its divine abilities, but still couldn't overcome Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to use it to further his comprehension and was reluctant to end its suffering, but the Heavenly Eye Butterfly transmitted a thought.</p><p>Dark clouds were surging towards them from the depths of the Demonic Wasteland, rapidly engulfing the mountains. Ferocious beasts or ghostly beings were being drawn here, seemingly more than one.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. The Heaven Severing Soul Shaking Needles left his hand.</p><p>Sword stars reappeared, the White Tiger descended, its roar echoing through the mountains. He clenched his fists, blood thorns extending from his gauntlets, killing intent radiating from him.</p><p>Outside this jungle, only darkness could be seen, along with occasional flashes of sword light and starlight.</p><p>The ground trembled violently, thunderous booms echoing continuously, followed by pained roars.</p><p>The dark clouds drew closer.</p><p>Suddenly, the darkness receded like a tide.</p><p>Qin Sang transformed back into his human form, holding the monstrous bull's carcass in one hand. He glanced back, thunder wings sprouting from his back as he soared into the sky, leaving behind a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>Over seventy percent of the ancient trees in the jungle had withered, and the surviving ones were tinged with yellow, almost a dead forest. Several peaks had collapsed, and the ground was pockmarked with craters.</p><p>His thunder escape was incredibly fast, and soon the dark clouds behind him were out of sight.</p><p>After flying for some distance, Qin Sang stopped, confirming there were no pursuers.  He glanced around and landed on a barren mountain.</p><p>‘Thump!’</p><p>The monstrous bull's carcass crashed to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Gray Warbler Sword to dismember it. The demon core, antlers, and the nine clumps of pus and blood were the most valuable, and he stored them separately and methodically.</p><p>After quickly dividing the spoils, Qin Sang sat down cross-legged.</p><p>He needed to reflect on the gains from this battle.</p><p>Several hours later,</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, a hint of uncertainty flashing within them.</p><p>The monstrous bull and Marquis Li were both at the mid-stage of Nascent Soul, and both were slain by him single-handedly. Yet the insights he gained from the two battles were markedly different.</p><p>It wasn't merely a matter of sequence.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow, sensing a flaw in his previous understanding.</p><p>Perhaps it was because this opponent was a ferocious beast, its mind muddled.</p><p>It wasn't enough to simply challenge powerful opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the momentary exhilaration he felt when slaying Marquis Li, a sense of release, the satisfaction of using every possible means to outwit and outfight the enemy, and ultimately prevailing.</p><p>Of course, there was also the gratification of revenge!</p><p>Killing Dao cultivation, who to slay?</p><p>Slaying the strongest enemy, seeking survival against the odds, or taking revenge on those who would kill him, or perhaps all of the above.</p><p>As his realm increased, Qin Sang increasingly understood the importance of 'Dao'. The creators of cultivation methods weren't indiscriminate killers, they had forged their own Dao.  If he couldn't grasp this, his future cultivation would be hindered.</p><p>If his guess was correct, he might not be able to remain in seclusion indefinitely. Fortunately, the battle against Marquis Li had yielded immense gains, and hunting ferocious beasts was somewhat helpful, so there was no need to rush out into the world.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang sighed softly and vanished from the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Southeast of the Ju Mountain Ritual Altar, on a barren ridge, the Snake Demon prostrated itself before Qin Sang.</p><p>“Reporting to Immortal, this is this humble demon's territory.”</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over the desolate area. There were caves in the mountains where the Ghost People eked out a meager existence.</p><p>Territory?  Had the Ghost Fang Kingdom already begun to consider the Demonic Wasteland its own?</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the distance. Having the Snake Demon stationed here would make it much more convenient to travel to and from the Ju Mountain Ritual Altar, which was a good thing.</p><p>‘Thump! Thump! Thump!’</p><p>In a blink of an eye, several items appeared on the ground before the Snake Demon, all consisting of skin, bones, flesh, and blood.</p><p>“Take these and exchange them for spiritual herbs,” Qin Sang pointed to a small jade bottle. “This bottle of demon blood is for your own use.”</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the remains, the Snake Demon shuddered, its heart filled with terror.</p><p>Although it couldn't discern the ferocious beast's cultivation level during its life, it was certain that it was stronger than the Demon Marquis it served, and it had died recently.</p><p>This person could actually slay such a beast alone!</p><p>Overwhelmed by fear, the Snake Demon dared not harbor any ulterior motives. Then, upon hearing Qin Sang bestow the blood, it was filled with ecstasy, kowtowing repeatedly.  “This humble demon will wholeheartedly gather spiritual herbs for Immortal, offering my utmost service…”</p><p>These were only a small portion of the spoils.  With the Snake Demon's cultivation level, occasionally taking out one or two pieces was plausible, but anything more would arouse suspicion.</p><p>The Snake Demon's task was to gather information. If it encountered a large quantity of spiritual herbs, it was to delay the other party until Qin Sang returned, disguised as a demon cultivator, to conduct the transaction.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang chose a secluded spot and set up a spirit array for the Snake Demon before returning to the Ju Mountain Ritual Altar.</p><p>The poison lake remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the spirit array and returned to the White Bone Flower Field.</p><p>During his absence, the White Bone Flower Field remained the same.</p><p>Qin Sang patrolled the field, first collecting the ripened flower dew, then with a flick of his sleeve, numerous array artifacts flew out in all directions.</p><p>Previously, he lacked the necessary materials, but after returning, Qin Sang had specifically borrowed Master Qi's fire chamber to refine all the array artifacts, completely restoring the spirit array.</p><p>No change was visible to the naked eye, but the spirit array's power had undoubtedly been greatly enhanced, and several of its transformations had been restored, making it even more concealed.</p><p>“It’s time for closed-door cultivation…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, glancing around, then vanished into his cave dwelling.</p><p>The entrance to the cave dwelling closed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inwards at his own body, then settled into meditation. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew out from his dantian, landing on his shoulder, nestled against his neck, its wings gently opening and closing.</p><p>Silence filled the cave dwelling, an air of tranquility pervading the space.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's aura fluctuated, sometimes surging, sometimes calming.</p><p>Unlike his previous complete seclusion, every three to five years, Qin Sang would emerge from seclusion to meet with the Snake Demon and Realist Zhi Jian.</p><p>The True Essence imbued with the Jade Buddha's aura could protect the Fire Jade Centipede for this long, eliminating the need to entrust its care to others.</p><p>With nothing else to attend to, Qin Sang's trips were always brief. Occasionally, he would infiltrate the Ghost Fang Kingdom, concealing his identity for transactions, but he never lingered.</p><p>…</p><p>Years flew by.</p><p>Thirty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>No trace of time could be felt within the White Bone Flower Field. The spiritual flowers remained as vibrant as ever, and the Flower Spirit was still as beautiful as a celestial maiden.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling,</p><p>Qin Sang's qi and blood surged as he tempered his body with poison. His vitality was far greater than thirty years ago, his progress astonishing.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang raised an eyebrow, forcibly stopping the secret technique and retrieving the Sun God Tree with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p>“You’ve finally awakened.”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird fledgling’s slumber this time had lasted nearly a century.</p><p>“You’re not dead yet?”</p><p>A clear, childish voice emerged from the Sun God Tree, tinged with fatigue.  Then, after a pause, it exclaimed in surprise, “Eh? Where is this? Why have you turned into this ghastly state?”</p>
