Chapter 723: The Seal

‘BOOM!’

Deafening roars echoed intermittently across the ocean surface. Two figures, one pursuing and one fleeing, churned the sea, leaving towering waves in their wake.

The Two-Headed Flood Dragon appeared considerably more battered than before. Its fur was ruffled and scorched in several places, its breath ragged. As it fled, it glanced back anxiously.

After using its Shadow Doppelganger technique three times, it had managed to put a significant distance between itself and the man in black armor. However, to the Flood Dragon’s dismay, the man remained like a persistent shadow, relentlessly tailing it.

In contrast, the man in black armor grew increasingly confident, treating the Two-Headed Flood Dragon as if it were already captured.

Suddenly, he accelerated, closing the distance rapidly. Just then, the Flood Dragon blurred, splitting into six identical figures once more.

"Beast, do you think Lu has no other means just because I've used up the Spirit Water? I want to see how many more times you can use that trick, and where you think you can run!" the man in black armor roared.  A spectral image of a mirror appeared above his head.  Wielding this mirror was taxing, but seeing the Flood Dragon within his grasp, the man spared no effort.

Moreover, the Flood Dragon had expended a great deal of energy during the prolonged chase.  Now was the perfect time to utilize the mirror.

The mirror slowly rotated, then fixed on the third figure to the left. It had seemingly pinpointed the Flood Dragon's true form with ease.

The man in black armor sneered and raised his black spear, ready to strike.  Suddenly, his expression shifted dramatically. He spun around, looking back towards Coldflame Island. A blue light flickered in the distance, a clear sign of the Coldflame erupting!

"The Winterfire Coldflame!" he exclaimed in alarm.

His duty bound him to the Coldflame. Seeing such an anomaly, he immediately abandoned his pursuit of the Flood Dragon and turned back towards Coldflame Island without hesitation.

Moments later, he appeared above the island, his face grim as he surveyed the scene below.

The erupting Coldflame had frozen the surrounding sea, the ice already several meters thick – a testament to its power.

The Winterfire Coldflame was in chaos, erupting repeatedly.

The man hastily retrieved a jade talisman to send a message, but just as quickly, the Coldflame inexplicably began to subside.  He paused, a look of bewilderment on his face…

Meanwhile, south of Coldflame Island, Qin Sang, Tianmu Butterfly, and the Two-Headed Flood Dragon had reunited.

"Well done!" Qin Sang praised, stroking the Flood Dragon’s head as he settled onto its back.

Having successfully retrieved the Winterfire Coldflame, Qin Sang was in high spirits. The Flood Dragon shook its head playfully, trying to escape his touch.

Qin Sang chuckled, unfazed, and tossed the Flood Dragon a medicinal pill.  He then looked out at the vast Demonic Sea and said gravely, "I wonder if this will alert the Island Lord of Boundless Heaven Island... We can't go back the way we came. We must avoid Boundless Heaven Island.  A bit of risk is acceptable. We'll go directly to Cliffrock Island.  You'll have to work a little harder..."

He held the ball of fire in his hand.  Unsure how to subdue the Coldflame just yet, he dared not put away the Ten Directions Yama Banner and could only ride the Two-Headed Flood Dragon.

For some reason, the Flood Dragon's mood seemed to have improved considerably. It swallowed the pill and set off without a word.

Qin Sang kept an eye on the distance, making sure the man in black armor wasn't pursuing them. Only then did he turn his attention to studying the Winterfire Coldflame.

"Immortal Winterfire was too powerful. This spiritual fire is entirely his, inseparable from him.  No wonder neither the Transformed Demons nor the Island Lord could do anything!  Even given decades, I wouldn't be able to erase Immortal Winterfire's mark.  What am I supposed to do?"

Qin Sang was at a loss, seemingly unable to control the Winterfire Coldflame.

Although the Nine Nether Demon Fire could suppress the Winterfire Coldflame, the two were fundamentally incompatible.  If Qin Sang attempted to use the Nine Nether Demon Fire to invade or devour the Winterfire Coldflame, it would certainly trigger a massive explosion.

"For now, I can only try to stabilize it.  I can't hold it in my hand forever.  I'll have to think of a way to subdue it later.  Perhaps I can use restrictions..."  Qin Sang mused, an idea forming.

Stabilizing the Winterfire Coldflame would require the power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire.

He held the fire in one hand and gestured with the other, his fingertips shimmering with true essence. A rune formed instantly. Then, with his divine sense, he guided a wisp of Nine Nether Demon Fire, attaching it to the rune.

After dozens of failed attempts, he finally began to grasp the technique.

A Fire Restriction Seal gradually took shape, as black as ink like the Nine Nether Demon Fire, slowly drifting towards Qin Sang’s other hand.

Under his careful control, the Fire Restriction Seal passed through the body of the Nine Nether Demon Fire and attached itself to the surface of the Coldflame, sealing it within.

Qin Sang took a deep breath, withdrawing his divine sense and the Nine Nether Demon Fire. Seeing the Winterfire Coldflame remain stable, he felt a wave of relief. He quickly retrieved a large jade box from his Thousand Treasures Ring and placed the Coldflame inside.

…

Having stolen the Winterfire Coldflame, Qin Sang didn't dare linger, immediately departing with the Two-Headed Flood Dragon.

He avoided Boundless Heaven Island, preferring to take the longer route. Back on the established sea lanes, he headed straight for Cliffrock Island.

The journey back was uneventful.

Along the way, he saw large ships sailing, a clear sign that the two races had indeed reconciled. Qin Sang knew the route well, and with the Primordial Concentric Rings, his journey was even easier. Therefore, he didn't board any ships.

He soon arrived near Four Clarity Island. There was no sign that the Island Lord of Boundless Heaven Island had issued a warrant for his arrest.  Thus, he returned to Cliffrock Island without incident.

Unexpectedly, twenty years had passed since he last left the island.

Qin Sang felt a sense of disorientation, the years of hunting demons feeling like a dream.

He donned his cloak and flew towards Cliffrock Island. Midway, he encountered a patrol. After presenting his token as a retainer of the Joan Yu Trading Company, he was immediately granted passage.

"It seems the Joan Yu Trading Company still has a presence on the island.  I wonder if the people have changed." Qin Sang mused as Cliffrock Island drew near.

The island and its city looked the same as before, untouched by the conflict between the two races.

"I was being overly cautious back then," Qin Sang chuckled to himself. He landed at the city gate and walked in, heading towards where he remembered the Joan Yu Trading Company's branch being located.

The building still bore the same plaque, cultivators coming and going as usual.

Qin Sang reached the entrance and was about to step inside when a group of cultivators emerged.

Two of the women in the group glanced at Qin Sang, his attire striking a familiar chord.

They exchanged a look, their faces lighting up with surprise.  To the astonishment of their companions, they darted forward, blocking Qin Sang’s path.  With barely contained excitement, one of them asked, "May I ask if senior's Daoist name is Clearwind…?"

Qin Sang smiled faintly, cutting them off.  "What, after a few years, you two no longer recognize this humble Daoist?"

The two women were the Wang sisters, whom he had traveled with years ago, separated during the demon hunt when they were attacked by the sorcerers.

He was surprised to run into familiar faces so soon after returning.  He was further surprised to see that the elder Wang sister had successfully formed her Gold Core, a testament to the passage of time.
