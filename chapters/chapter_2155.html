<h1>Chapter 2145:  弘道's Teachings</h1><p>The Dharma altars are built according to the Daoist court's specifications, divided into administrative altars , pacification altars , capital altars , and branch altars .  There is no ancestral altar  due to the lack of established sect power here.</p><p>Storm World doesn't possess the Daoist court's strength and vast territory, so regulations are scaled down accordingly.</p><p>The administrative altar is situated near the teleportation array leading to the Western Lands. This location, roughly at the center of Storm World and not far from Qingyang Temple, is the ideal choice.</p><p>Qin Sang names the Daoist compound Qingyang Zhi, and this administrative altar is the Qingyang Zhi Altar.</p><p>One day, if the Qingyang Zhi Altar connects with the Divine Court, or even condenses the Capital Merit Seal, rising to become one of the Daoist court's main administrative altars, Qingyang Temple will truly become renowned throughout the Great Thousand World!</p><p>Four pacification altars are established under the administrative altar.</p><p>During the Daoist court's heyday, its rules were strict, including the names of the pacification and capital altars, all following specific conventions. For example, “Jiazi Tongxuan Zhizhen Jing” or “Lingzhen Yingmiao Tan.”  “Jiazi” is a serial number, followed by the altar's name.</p><p>With the decline of the Daoist court and Qingyang Zhi not yet incorporated into it, there's no need to strictly adhere to all rules to avoid startling Storm World cultivators.  When naming the pacification altars, Qin Sang uses the names of the four regions from the lower realms.</p><p>The first pacification altar is located on the East Sea coast, overseeing the original North Waste, Central Plains, and East Sea regions.  This includes the Witch tribe territory and is the strongest and most central of the four, named Jiazi Central Plains Pacification Altar.</p><p>The second pacification altar is in the North Sea, Qingyang Temple’s place of origin, governing the four regions of the North Sea, leaving room for northward expansion. It is named Yi Chou North Sea Pacification Altar.</p><p>The third is located in the Western Lands. The climate and geography of the Western Lands have changed dramatically, and the population is growing. The vast territories extending from the Western Lands, including the three island chains, will eventually be incorporated into Qingyang Zhi, making this altar the one with the greatest potential for the future. It is named Bing Yin Western Lands Pacification Altar.</p><p>The fourth is in the Canglang Sea, overseeing the Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea, monitoring the Evil River to the east and encompassing a vast sea area to the south. It's named Ding Mao Canglang Pacification Altar.</p><p>Below the four pacification altars are capital altars and branch altars, established as needed.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang ordered Li Yu Fu to establish a capital altar in the shelter. Although external threats are eliminated, this location cannot be abandoned. Cultivators will remain there permanently as a fallback.</p><p>Only the divine path makes Qin Sang hesitate.</p><p>Fortunately, the divine path of Qingyang Zhi is just starting and not a major concern.  Qin Sang adopts the method from the Talisman World, using celestial officials to control the deities, having them watch over the mortal realm.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang has built the framework of an administrative altar. Normally, he could expand outward, conquering and establishing more pacification and capital altars, attracting more cultivators to accept the teachings and practice Daoist methods.</p><p>The larger the territory and the more cultivators under his teachings, the stronger the administrative altar will become, increasing the possibility of connecting to the Divine Court, condensing the Capital Merit Seal, and ascending to a main administrative altar.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is the Mist Sea, and the territory cannot exceed the former territory of the Changyou tribe. Storm World cannot go to war with the entire Yi Ren race.  The limit will be reached, forcing them to remain here.</p><p>If Qin Sang truly chooses the Mahayana path, Qingyang Zhi won't be enough to help him reach the Unity stage. It's only a temporary measure, and he’ll need to find another location to establish a Daoist compound later.</p><p>“Do you have suitable candidates in mind for the four pacification altars?” Qin Sang asks Li Yu Fu.</p><p>With pacification altars, there needs to be celestial officials to preside over them.</p><p>As the Five Thunder Palace Envoy, Qin Sang has the authority to act arbitrarily, appointing officials within the Five Thunder Palace and reporting to the Divine Thunder Upper Palace afterward.</p><p>Below the Five Thunder Palace Envoy in the Five Thunder Palace's ranks are:  Rank 3, Ninth Heaven Golden Que Upper Minister; Divine Thunder Jade Axis Deputy Envoy; Five Thunder Palace Deputy Envoy.</p><p>Rank 4: Jade Mansion Upper Minister, Five Thunder Order. Rank 4, : Jade Mansion Upper Minister, Five Thunder Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>And so on, with various ranks and titles, with positions like Registrar Celestial Official,  Secretary Celestial Official, Keeper of Records Celestial Official, Purple Micro Inner Hanlin, Purple Micro Master of Law, Tai Ping Auxiliaries Celestial Minister, Divine Thunder Enforcement Celestial Official, and many more.</p><p>The names of the positions themselves show that during the Daoist court's peak, Rank 5 was a significant threshold; high-ranking positions not attainable by ordinary individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang benefits from the decline of the Daoist court and the resulting exceptional promotions.  Subordinate officials also benefit; Metamorphosis cultivators can become pacification altar masters, receiving the rank of Rank 4 Jade Mansion Upper Minister, Five Thunder Order, and similar titles.</p><p>“This disciple wishes to take charge of the Central Plains Pacification Altar.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu bows.</p><p>He is the head of Qingyang Temple, representing Qin Sang's will, a responsibility he cannot shirk.  The Zhongzhou Garrison is the strongest, a melting pot of diverse factions, requiring a powerful figure to oversee it—none other than Li Yu Fu.</p><p>As he is not yet a Transcendent cultivator, he can only temporarily serve as the deputy commander of the Five Thunder Academy.  Later, he will oversee the Qingyang Garrison on behalf of Qin Sang, but his official rank remains that of a fifth-rank Five Thunder Commander.</p><p>"Palace Master Bao Zhengnan's letter arrived.  Daoist Bao Xi wishes to cultivate thunder techniques. In my opinion, Daoist Bao Xi could oversee the Western Garrison.  Palace Master Tong and Master Shi are unwilling to change their cultivation methods.  Mistress Yun Xin recently relinquished her abbess position; she seems inclined to shift from Buddhism to Daoism.  We could either ask Palace Master Tong to assign a Xuan Tian Palace expert, or invite Mistress Yun Xin to oversee the Canglang Garrison. The Four Saints Palace and Xuan Tian Palace have undeniably contributed greatly to past battles, and Fairy Liuli's benefaction to the world is widely known and respected."</p><p>Li Yu Fu, clearly prepared, spoke confidently, "For the last garrison, the North Sea Garrison, I suggest we allow other forces to jointly nominate a candidate, as a gesture of benevolence and goodwill."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently; Li Yu Fu's considerations were quite thorough.</p><p>He has ensured that the garrison commanders and their sects are not from the same group, preventing any single faction from dominating the garrisons. He has also considered the perspectives of other forces, achieving a delicate balance.</p><p>Regardless, the other factions' selection process will undoubtedly lead to internal conflict.  The chosen individual will lack a base of power in the North Sea, yet the North Sea is the ancestral seat of Qingyang Temple, and the mighty Xuan Tian Palace is also present, limiting the garrison commander's authority.</p><p>Within the Daoist court's system, the garrison commander cannot act unilaterally. Key positions will only be filled by those trusted by Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"With you overseeing the Qingyang Garrison, I will have no worries," Qin Sang said with relief.</p><p>Li Yu Fu showed no sign of pride, bowing deeply, "Master, you overpraise me."</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the Garrison.</p><p>From afar, the landscape had dramatically changed.</p><p>Surrounding the ancient relocation array, a celestial city had originally been formed.  Now, the city has expanded, leaving several mountain peaks at the city's center.</p><p>The mountains were not steep, shrouded in mist, with dense forests and bamboo groves.  A monumental archway stood at the foot of the mountains, inscribed with the five golden characters 'Qingyang Garrison Headquarters', guarded by golden armored soldiers.</p><p>Though not as grand as the White Stone Garrison Qin Sang had seen, pavilions and towers were nestled among the clouds and ancient trees, while a bustling celestial city lay outside, creating a dynamic yet serene atmosphere, both mysterious and awe-inspiring.</p><p>The ancient relocation array is located near the foot of the mountains, accessible to ordinary cultivators.</p><p>At the summit stood numerous golden halls.  One is the Consecration Hall of the Consecration Office, and also the Garrison Headquarters.</p><p>They arrived before the golden hall, Li Yu Fu opened the door, and Qin Sang saw a fully prepared altar.</p><p>In fact, various Daoist altars are, to a certain extent, interchangeable. The true core lies in what is inscribed within them—for example, the oaths and thunder talismans in a thunder altar, and the seals and methods within a transmission altar.</p><p>In ancient times, transmission altars could consecrate, establish the Four God Stations, summon deities and generals, and deploy thunder talismans and techniques, surpassing thunder altars in scope.</p><p>Qin Sang could integrate the thunder altar into the garrison altar for easier control.  However, a single altar serving too many purposes might cause conflict, depending on the altar master's cultivation and control.</p><p>As this is his first time establishing a transmission altar, he decided to build a garrison altar from scratch – one to protect Qingyang Garrison and one for transmission purposes. He would consider merging them once the altar grows sufficiently large. However, preparations for future integration are underway, with the three core sub-altars situated adjacent to the garrison altar.</p><p>Li Yu Fu stood respectfully at the entrance. Qin Sang entered the Consecration Hall. The Qianjun Ring shone brightly, and countless spiritual materials flowed out like water, transforming into various shapes before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang personally worked, and the altar quickly took shape.  Except for its larger size compared to the garrison altar, its structure was essentially the same, lacking any further extraordinary features.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The altar trembled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang floated above the altar, and with a thought, a green light shot out from his brow, instantly illuminating the entire hall, revealing a phantom altar.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, having some understanding of the Daoist court, felt the mysterious aura emanating from the phantom altar, his eyes filled with a mixture of awe and eagerness.</p><p>The guardian deity, Lei Zu, was deliberately concealed by Qin Sang.  As Qin Sang's thoughts flickered, Lei Zu's imperial decree and the Five Thunder Academy seal flew out from the phantom altar, hovering above the garrison altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Divine Thunder Imperial Seal within the phantom altar was activated, shooting out three green lights, each condensing into a phantom image of a technique before Qin Sang:  a first-order Taishang Zhengyi Boy Divine General technique, a second-order Flowing Gold Fire Bell technique, and a third-order Five Thunder Secret technique.</p><p>A golden light shot from the imperial edict, transforming into a blank golden talisman. A spell was attached to it, solidifying into a true golden talisman.  Immediately, a phantom seal from the Five Thunder Envoy’s office merged into the talisman.</p><p>The talisman vibrated, its aura drastically changing, emitting strange power.</p><p>Three golden talismans fully formed, turning into three points of golden light, spiraling down into the altar.</p><p>Inside the altar, the three golden talismans revolved around each other, sometimes separating, sometimes merging. Occasionally, the shadow of a golden seal, resembling the Divine Thunder Imperial Seal, appeared within the golden light.  Normally, once the altar is completed and connected to the Celestial Court, the three talismans would form the Grand Seal of Merit.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind on the altar, manipulating the talismans, exerting his full power to sense the Celestial Court.  As expected, there was no response, like a stone sinking into the sea.</p><p>However, the Five Thunder Envoy’s seal on the talismans meant Qin Sang could bestow spells upon others.  The only difference was that during the bestowal, the petition burned during the ritual wouldn't reach the Celestial Court; instead, it would fly to the altar.</p><p>Unsuccessful in his attempt, Qin Sang abandoned it, withdrawing his focus.  True energy surged wildly into the altar. The bestowal hall violently shook as the altar emitted a green pillar of light that shot through the roof and into the sky.</p><p>At that moment, the entire Xian City, and even a large part of Central State, witnessed a green rainbow ascending to the heavens.  Following this, all the main, regional, and branch altars displayed similar phenomena, emitting green light in response to the main altar.</p><p>This scene caused great unrest in the Storm World, as people feared another major event was about to unfold.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon didn't last long. If anyone had been near the main and regional altars at that time, they would have noticed a faint golden light retracting with the green light as it disappeared into the altars.</p><p>At this moment, all altars possessed the ability to bestow spells, with different spell grades accessible depending on the altar's level.</p><p>Only the main altar could bestow the highest-grade, third-tier Five Thunder Secret Techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, looking at Li Yu Fu and saying, "Choose an auspicious date, invite all fellow practitioners, and come to the altar to witness the ceremony where I will bestow spells upon you!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu would be the first to receive the bestowal.</p><p>"Which technique have you chosen?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Daoist scriptures differed.  Even the high-level Divine Thunder Scripture could be practiced in various ways.</p><p>"Disciple feels that the 'Divine Thunder Ten Cross Scripture' is more suitable," Li Yu Fu respectfully replied.</p><p>Qin Sang presented Li Yu Fu with several thunder scriptures to choose from.</p><p>The Five Thunder Envoy's seal contained superior thunder scriptures such as 'Three Palaces Inner Mandate,' 'Primal Chaos Six Heavens Auspicious Scripture,' and 'Cave Profound Jade Pivot Thunder Technique,' with the 'Divine Thunder Ten Cross Scripture' also among them.</p><p>There were also ordinary thunder scriptures like 'Primordial Thunder Secret Canon,' 'Cloud Movement Rain Summoning Secret Record,' and common five-element thunder techniques, with methods for all five-elemental spiritual roots.</p><p>Qin Sang would not so easily provide superior thunder scriptures to outsiders, as there would be restrictions and conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, taking out a jade slip. "This scripture originated in the era of the Divine Thunder Chief Office of the Celestial Court, an ancient thunder scripture of great power.  Your late shift to the path of thunder means comprehending this scripture won't be easy. Although I am not a true thunder cultivator, I also have some insights into this path, which I've added to the end of the scripture."</p><p>"Thank you, Master Uncle, for passing down the teachings!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu knelt, raising his hands to solemnly receive the scripture.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon after, various factions received messages and came to the altar for the ceremony.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Qin Sang activated the altar, offered incense, reported to the Divine Thunder Upper Palace, and personally bestowed spells upon Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Around twenty or thirty others also received the bestowal, all Nascent Soul stage cultivators who decided to switch to the thunder path.</p><p>Some were hesitant but quickly regretted it, as only the first batch would receive the bestowal personally from Qin Sang.  Future bestowal at the altar would be conducted by Li Yu Fu after he received the Five Thunder Secret Technique and refined his own altar, acting as Qin Sang's representative.</p><p>This meant that the first recipients could call themselves disciples of the Envoy's lineage. Even those not disciples of the Green Goat Temple would envy such a connection.</p><p>With Li Yu Fu and others receiving the Five Thunder Secret Technique, the four main altar masters were selected, and the regional and branch altar masters assumed their duties, gradually putting the Green Goat Altar in order.</p><p>From then on, the Celestial Court's thunder techniques flourished!</p><p>Every so often, countless cultivators and mortals received spells at various branch altars.</p><p>Bestowal Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged above the altar, intently sensing something.</p><p>"So opening an altar has this benefit…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He felt that as more and more people received, practiced, and cultivated the spells and thunder techniques, forming a connection with the altar, the altar's power was subtly increasing, and the golden seal manifested by the three golden talismans became more substantial. The altar could even help the altar master comprehend thunder techniques, with the effect becoming more significant as the altar grew stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, his fundamental technique wasn't a thunder scripture, and he'd reached the peak of the Five Thunder Secret Technique. He still didn't know where to receive the fourth-tier Purple Void Command Thunder Treasure Technique.</p><p>However, there was still something to learn.</p><p>After all, propagating and transmitting the Dao is also a great path!</p>
