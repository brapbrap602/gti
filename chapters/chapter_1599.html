<h1>Chapter 1590: The Yi Bao Fair</h1><p>Chapter 1590: The Yi Bao Fair</p><p>Jia District.</p><p>Having shaken off his pursuers, Qin Sang returned to his rented cave dwelling.  Opening the jade box, he examined its contents closely. To his surprise, the tuft of fur had darkened slightly and its shape had changed.</p><p>The fur seemed alive, subtly twisting and turning—a movement only perceptible after a period of time.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, deciding against breaking the seal prematurely.  He instead channeled his spiritual sense into the jade box, making a cursory examination.  He sensed a hint of danger emanating from the fur; it was clearly no ordinary object.</p><p>“To what extent can this thing threaten the Faceless Man?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He didn't doubt the power of the Wan Du Mountain treasure, but so much time had passed, introducing too many variables.  The Faceless Man might well have developed a way to suppress the remaining poison.</p><p>Furthermore, the greatest danger posed by the Faceless Man was the Jade Armored Insects.</p><p>Pinning his hopes on a single object was unwise.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade box and took out the Li Meng San.  Having gathered all the necessary pills for the insect-raising technique, he could begin preparing for the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang needed to forcibly enhance the Chi Ye Yuan Insect to the late third stage of transformation.  Even using the riskier pills wouldn't affect the final outcome of the insect-raising process.</p><p>Then, for a year, he would continuously feed the Fire Jade Centipede with spirit medicines.</p><p>Everything was ready; he only needed to proceed methodically.</p><p>Qin Sang divided his quiet chamber into three sections, releasing the Fire Jade Centipede, the Fiery Silk Worm, and the Chi Ye Yuan Insect.  A flash of light from his palm revealed a bottle of pills; he poured out three and flicked them towards the three spirit insects.</p><p>The alluring scent of the pills compelled the insects to swallow them whole, excitedly darting about within the restrictive barrier.</p><p>Their digestion of the pills did not require Qin Sang's constant attention.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, entering a meditative state to cultivate.</p><p>A black light flashed from his brow.</p><p>The Fire Lotus flew out, blooming slightly more than before.  Its layered petals were now visible, resembling a lotus flower about to fully open.</p><p>A demonic banner emerged from Qin Sang's sleeve, wisps of demonic fire swirling and being slowly refined by him before being incorporated into the Fire Lotus.</p><p>As his understanding of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* technique deepened, this process should have accelerated.</p><p>Yet, its speed was considerably slower than twenty years ago.</p><p>The reason was not simply that he was approaching a bottleneck; he was nearing the purest core essence of the demonic fire.</p><p>At a lower cultivation level, Qin Sang hadn't cultivated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and when using the demonic banner he only manipulated the outwardly manifested demonic fire's aura, similar to the Sun God Bird formed by the condensed aura of the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>With his cultivation rising and with the cultivation of *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he could directly use the demonic fire against enemies, but he hadn’t touched the core essence sealed within the Xuan Tie Pillar.</p><p>It was certain that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was a technique employed by cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage or even higher. After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang would definitely be able to refine all the demonic fire he had collected with the demonic banner.</p><p>Currently, most of the eighteen demonic banners only contained a wisp of the demonic fire's essence.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was insufficient.  Attempting to refine the demonic fire essence greatly increased the pressure and slowed his progress, also contributing to the bottleneck.  If he could refine all the demonic fire essence, it would mean he had completely mastered the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and his spiritual sense would undoubtedly undergo a significant leap.</p><p>Achieving this was extremely difficult!</p><p>Since arriving at Fei Yun Ferry, Qin Sang had maintained contact with Jiang Mu, closely monitoring developments and waiting for high-profile Yi Bao Fairs and auctions.</p><p>Over the next year, Qin Sang fed the three spirit insects according to his plan.</p><p>In the eleventh month, the Chi Ye Yuan Insect advanced to the late third stage of transformation as expected.  Due to the potent nature of the pills it had consumed, the Chi Ye Yuan Insect possessed the most volatile temperament of the three; it could only barely maintain stability at this stage.</p><p>Confined within the restrictive barrier, they were close together, clearly able to see each other.  They coexisted day and night, eager to devour one another, yet separated by an invisible barrier.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, possessing the gentlest temperament, lay lazily coiled, not bothering to glance at its two companions.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Pills shot into the barrier.</p><p>The three spirit insects, accustomed to their catered-to existence, leaped up, swallowing the pills.  Their small eyes, however, remained fixated on each other, filled with greed, vying for the spoils.</p><p>“The time is almost right…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself.  After a moment's thought, he collected the three spirit insects into his spirit beast pouch, then left the cave dwelling, boarded his beast chariot, and parked it at a way station on the north bank of Fei Yun Ferry before teleporting into the wilderness.</p><p>He found a relatively open valley.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly tapped his fingers, sending out streaks of light that formed a spirit array in the open space.  Upon activation, a semicircular crimson light shield appeared.</p><p>Then, he summoned the three spirit insects, placing them within the spirit array, still separated by the restrictive barrier.</p><p>A thousand-weight seal shimmered.  Dozens of jade vials flew out, clanging as they spontaneously opened, scattering medicinal herbs through the air like a celestial shower. A heady, mixed fragrance filled the space.</p><p>There were pills, powders, and elixirs—all listed as essential ingredients in the *Gu Jing*.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly touched the herbs, sorting them and carefully adding them to the spirit array, one by one, following a precise procedure.  His knowledge of alchemy was limited, but it felt much like refining pills, the spirit array acting as the crucible, ultimately to cultivate a spirit insect.</p><p>The herbs mixed within the array, forming a visible stream of medicinal energy that swirled above, creating a ring.</p><p>Three spirit insects reacted to the scent, thrashing in agitation but held firmly to the ground by a suppressing enchantment, emitting shrill cries.</p><p>Qin Sang took a vial of mid-grade Li Meng Powder and tossed it in front of the Fire Jade Centipede.  The centipede consumed it, its mind regaining some clarity.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang released the suppression.</p><p>The Fiery Silkmoth and the Red Wild Worm instantly turned into streaks of red, plunging into the stream of medicine. The Fire Jade Centipede, slightly dazed, moved its head, saw the two insects greedily devouring the herbs, and in a flurry of panic, threw itself into the mix.</p><p>Initially, with an abundance of herbs, the three insects gorged themselves without fighting, but soon, competition began. The herbs heightened their aggression.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, somewhat improved by the Li Meng Powder, was no match for the already enraged Fiery Silkmoth and Red Wild Worm. When they came close, they viciously attacked one another.</p><p>Before long, the Fire Jade Centipede was forced to join the fray. The three insects battled fiercely.</p><p>The Fiery Silkmoth spat molten rock. The Red Wild Worm emanated a crimson aura, transforming into a fire spirit, convincingly realistic.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was not a skilled fighter, but its innate abilities granted it high defense against these kinds of attacks. Being the most powerful of the three, and retaining some semblance of intelligence, its self-preservation instinct remained; its injuries were the lightest.</p><p>As time passed, the battle within the spirit array became more brutal.  Broken limbs and body parts flew everywhere, punctuated by the sickening sound of crunching. The Fire Jade Centipede’s fleeting clarity was completely gone.</p><p>Seizing the moment, Qin Sang gave it another dose of Li Meng Powder.</p><p>Finally, the Red Wild Worm fell first, its round body torn in half by the Fire Jade Centipede and Fiery Silkmoth, who clamped down on either end.</p><p>"Crunch! Crunch!"</p><p>Chewing on the remains of their enemy, the Fiery Silkmoth and the Fire Jade Centipede, their ferocity intensified, glared at each other before simultaneously lunging.</p><p>Qin Sang added the final batch of pills. The two insects, while killing, also absorbed the pills, the battle escalating.</p><p>In the end, the Fire Jade Centipede, with its greatly diminished leg, wrapped itself tightly around the Fiery Silkmoth. Despite the Fiery Silkmoth's furious spray of molten rock, the Fire Jade Centipede bit through its abdomen and burrowed inside.</p><p>The Fiery Silkmoth thrashed violently, emitting a shrill cry. Its struggles intensified its agony, until suddenly its body stiffened, its life force rapidly draining.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, having pierced through the Fiery Silkmoth, devoured the corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang held the last vial of Li Meng Powder, his expression grave, his gaze fixed on the Fire Jade Centipede. He watched it transition from ravenous consumption to dainty nibbling.</p><p>At the same time, the color of the Fire Jade Centipede's carapace began to change, emitting a faint golden glow.</p><p>After consuming the entire carcass, the Fire Jade Centipede, still unsatisfied, searched for remaining scraps, wasting nothing. Then, it lay on the ground, its body contorting.  The golden glow grew even brighter.</p><p>From its carapace, the Fire Jade Centipede's entire body turned a reddish gold. During this transformation, its aura steadily increased in intensity, accelerating rapidly. Flames flowed across its body, and it began to cocoon itself.</p><p>"It's finally done!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up.  Without hesitation, he administered the final dose of Li Meng Powder. The Fire Jade Centipede's aura gradually stabilized, as it fell into a slumber within its fiery cocoon.</p><p>The precise rules governing the metamorphosis of spirit insects remained unknown.  This time, the Fire Jade Centipede's slumber was brief, less than half a year, before Qin Sang sensed movement from the cocoon. He returned to the old spot and set up a formation.</p><p>"Rip!"</p><p>The cocoon split open, and the Fire Jade Centipede crawled out. Sensing the celestial might, it raised its head, emitting a series of hisses before burying its head in the remains of the cocoon, consuming it. Its body was a radiant, reddish gold, shimmering with a metallic luster.</p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p>Thunderclouds gathered, the sky darkening, filled with lightning and thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly changed his hand seals, the surface of the spirit array transforming into numerous mystic mirrors. This array, incorporating the Mystic Mirror Formation, assisted the Fire Jade Centipede in its tribulation.</p><p>The tribulation clouds receded, the lightning vanished.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed, and he swiftly flew out of the valley.</p><p>Central Plains is densely populated, especially the six Jiangzuo prefectures.  Although Qin Sang chose a remote location for the Fire Jade Centipede's tribulation, there were still many powerful factions nearby, including some Yuan Ying sects.</p><p>The tribulation descended with great fanfare.</p><p>A Yuan Ying ancestor, disturbed from his meditation, flew into the air, glanced towards the horizon, and vanished.  He expelled a puff of white air, his figure merging with it, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Shortly after, seeing the tribulation clouds from afar, the Yuan Ying ancestor paused, a look of surprise on his face.  "Hmm? This tribulation cloud is quite strange… Could it be…"</p><p>Remembering something from an ancient text, the old Yuan Ying cultivator was overjoyed.  He suddenly noticed another figure approaching from the north, snorted coldly, and sped towards the tribulation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he could get close,</p><p>the Yuan Ying ancestor heard two strange sounds, "Humph! Ha!", and felt a sharp pain in his primordial spirit.  He staggered, horrified to discover his old enemy had also been struck. The other figure’s movement halted abruptly, his aura noticeably fluctuating.</p><p>"One step closer, and you die!"</p><p>A loud shout echoed clearly amidst the rolling thunder.</p><p>Simultaneously, a silver lightning bolt tore through the heavens, striking the valley, illuminating half the sky in an instant. A figure was vaguely visible.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying cultivators stopped abruptly, not daring to cross the threshold.</p><p>No wonder a four-stage spirit insect appeared here.</p><p>The Ullambana Festival was approaching, many long-reclusive cultivators were out and about.  Recently, there have been many rumors surrounding Feiyun Ferry; this person was likely one of them.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The mountains shook, the valley bathed in silver light.</p><p>After a bolt of tribulation lightning, the clouds dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the area, landed in the valley, released his Sky Eye Butterfly to absorb the remaining lightning energy, confirmed the Fire Jade Centipede was unharmed, collected the insect, and swiftly departed.</p><p>Only after he had been gone for some time did the two Yuan Ying cultivators dare to approach.</p><p>In the following period, more cultivators circled the area, but found nothing.</p><p>After a long detour, Qin Sang returned to his Feiyun Ferry cave abode and released the Fire Jade Centipede for observation.</p><p>Thanks to thorough preparation, the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation didn't leave any serious problems.  The fierce spirit was mostly dispelled by Li Mengsan, its intelligence remained relatively intact, and it still recognized Qin Sang as its master, docilely coiling on his palm, staining it crimson gold.</p><p>It would need some time to fully recover.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed the Fire Jade Centipede's mind, still detecting traces of ferocity.  He patiently soothed it for a while, then carefully examined it.</p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time, Qin Sang opened his eyes, thoughtful.</p><p>"This transformation undoubtedly enhanced its perception.  Also, its crimson gold carapace is extremely hard, seemingly possessing other powers to withstand harsh environments and improve its survival rate.  The prerequisite for treasure hunting is survival; that makes sense…"</p><p>Qin Sang valued the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-hunting ability most, not its combat strength; this outcome was acceptable.</p><p>He suddenly recalled something.</p><p>He had always thought the Fire Jade Centipede didn't develop any supernatural abilities at the third stage, perhaps because the improved fire resistance didn't lead to noticeable changes.</p><p>What bothered Qin Sang was that after its advancement, the Fire Melting Pill had no effect on it. He had to find other spiritual herbs.</p><p>Although the Fat Silkworm offered some clues, it required consuming high-level Gu insects. The cost of cultivating the Gu insects was a huge drain on Qin Sang's resources.</p><p>"Three four-stage spirit insects are just too expensive to keep…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, letting the Fire Jade Centipede go back to sleep, and then took out an invitation.</p><p>It was sent a month ago by Jiang Mu, inviting him to an auction in two months.</p><p>The auction was held in a county city a thousand miles south of Feiyun Ferry, claiming the possibility of treasures that would drive Golden Core cultivators mad.</p><p>Jiang Mu personally delivered the invitation, making Qin Sang understand the significance.  The top-level treasure exchange he anticipated was finally starting!</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang first returned to Pushan.</p><p>He stopped before his cave abode, hesitated, and then turned away.</p><p>While his main body was active at Feiyun Ferry, his clone had been secluded in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm, diligently cultivating the "Ice Soul Divine Light".</p><p>The ice disk provided sufficient cold煞 energy.</p><p>His clone's supernatural powers had greatly improved.  If not for the need to simultaneously refine the cold煞 energy and modify the supernatural powers to suit himself, he would have probably achieved mastery by now!</p><p>Unfortunately, his clone was in the crucial stage of a breakthrough and couldn't leave seclusion, leaving his main body to attend the treasure exchange alone.</p><p>He returned to Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>Qin Sang sorted through the items in his Qianjun Ring, selecting those suitable for trade, along with some miscellaneous items.</p><p>At the top-level treasure exchange, bartering was the norm; spirit stones had little value.</p><p>The gains and losses would be determined by his own judgment.</p><p>When the time came,</p><p>Qin Sang left Feiyun Ferry in advance, traveled south by boat, and disembarked at Tianzhong County, located on the west bank of Feiyun Ferry.</p><p>The Six Prefecture Hall’s choice of Tianzhong County was interesting.  Tianzhong County is reputed to be the center of the six Jiangzuo prefectures and the heart of the five major sects.</p>
