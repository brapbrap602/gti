<h1>Chapter 1360:  The Sermon at the High Altar</h1><p>Qin Sang sat high on the altar.</p><p>His disciples, their beast banners furled, stood silently at his sides.</p><p>The grand ceremony neared its end.</p><p>Yet, the anticipation on the faces of the cultivators in the valley grew stronger.</p><p>According to tradition, the founder of a sect would deliver a sermon on this day, as a return for their presence.</p><p>Sadly, such opportunities were rare.</p><p>Few had the qualifications, the ability to establish a sect, and the boldness to hold such a grand ceremony, inviting numerous guests.</p><p>For independent cultivators, even hearing a Golden Core cultivator preach was an enviable opportunity.</p><p>To hear a Nascent Soul ancestor deliver a sermon was a rare chance, even for disciples of established sects.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's sharp sword intent was gone, his aura subdued, as if he were an ordinary person.</p><p>He nodded slightly and spoke. His voice was not loud, yet it clearly reached everyone's ears, even those at the farthest edge of the valley.</p><p>“Fellow cultivators, you have traveled far to grace this ceremony.  I, Qin, thank you. I have nothing substantial to offer in return, only some insights into cultivation that I wish to share and discuss with you all.”</p><p>As he spoke his last sentence, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the Nascent Soul cultivators on the altar.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the tens of thousands of cultivators below fell silent, sitting respectfully.</p><p>In an instant, the vast Qingyang Temple was still, save for the gentle breeze.</p><p>On the altar, the Nascent Soul cultivators also sat upright, showing great respect for Qin Sang.</p><p>But unexpectedly, Qin Sang began his sermon from the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>Fortunately, the Nascent Soul cultivators were patient, listening attentively, awaiting the later parts of the discourse.</p><p>The cultivators in the valley, especially the independent cultivators, were overjoyed; the Qingyang Temple master was incredibly generous.</p><p>Qin Sang's sermon was concise and to the point, focusing only on the essentials. How much one could comprehend depended entirely on one's aptitude.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly finished the Qi Condensation section and moved on to Foundation Establishment.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang didn't have profound insights into Foundation Establishment; he had forcibly advanced using the spirit medicine gifted by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>However, with his current realm, looking back at the Foundation Establishment stage, he could effortlessly offer unique perspectives.</p><p>The Golden Core stage was different.</p><p>In the cultivation world, it was unlikely to find someone whose Golden Core formation had been more tortuous and heart-wrenching than his.</p><p>The Golden Core, embodying the Yin and Yang, was easy for those who understood it, but impossible for others, who might never grasp it even until death without guidance.</p><p>Those who had some understanding finally realized the incredible opportunity before them. Overjoyed and grateful, they disregarded the stares of others and kowtowed towards the ethereal figure on the altar.</p><p>As Qin Sang continued his sermon, more and more people knelt.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others attending the altar closely watched the valley, particularly the independent cultivators, diligently recording something.</p><p>Arcane arts cannot be easily passed down; after the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang spoke more briefly.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had spent most of his Golden Core stage in the Canglang Sea; the Canglang Sea's cultivation tradition differed from the Bei Chen region, so some of his insights were novel to the cultivators of Bei Chen.</p><p>Especially since Qin Sang had also absorbed some of the妖族 (Yaozu) and 巫族 (Wuzu) heritages.</p><p>Some perspectives were unheard of even by Nascent Soul cultivators and transformed great demons.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators listened attentively, not just out of courtesy to Qin Sang, but because they were genuinely listening and thinking carefully.</p><p>Si Di and Yao Jing exchanged a surprised glance; they had both received some inspiration.</p><p>There were no similar traditions in the Bei Chen region.  Had Qin Sang obtained this knowledge from some ancient secret realm?</p><p>If all this was solely Qin Sang's own understanding, then he was truly an unparalleled genius!</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't explain anything, leaving them to their speculations.</p><p>Gradually, subtle changes appeared on the Nascent Soul cultivators' faces—some in thought, others frowning.</p><p>Qin Sang always stopped just short of full revelation; it was as if there was a door that could be opened with a push, and behind it lay a far more magnificent and alluring world.  Whether Qin Sang hadn't fully comprehended it or was deliberately keeping them in suspense, their curiosity was piqued.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators below were even more restless, scratching their heads, anxiously looking around, trying to find fellow cultivators to exchange insights.</p><p>But they couldn't blame Qin Sang; more detailed information would certainly be the exclusive knowledge of their respective sects.</p><p>Qin Sang's mere mention of the door's existence was already extraordinarily kind.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators suppressed their thoughts, watching Qin Sang speak eloquently, their expressions growing increasingly serious, because Qin Sang was about to discuss the Nascent Soul stage, surely offering unique insights!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang stopped abruptly!</p><p>He had only been a Nascent Soul cultivator for less than a century, and he himself hadn't fully understood it; it was inappropriate to presume to teach others, especially since there were many mid-stage Nascent Soul masters on the altar.</p><p>The initial, superficial discourse proved insufficient; continuing would have been ridiculous.  Qin Sang cleverly shifted gears, instead lecturing on swordsmanship – a subject where she possessed supreme confidence.</p><p>Both the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Chapter" and the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" were profoundly insightful.  Qin Sang chose to focus on the latter, a text created by Qingzhu based on the former. She had regularly studied it, finding the scripture greatly beneficial to her cultivation.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, already aware of the lecture's topic, immediately transmitted a message to the sword cultivator disciples, urging them to clear their minds and listen attentively.</p><p>The Yuan Ying stage cultivators, after a brief moment of disappointment, displayed keen interest upon hearing the profound sword techniques.  The lower-level cultivators on the mountainside, while largely unable to fully comprehend the teachings, diligently recorded Qin Sang's every word.</p><p>Throughout the vast Qingyang Temple, only Qin Sang's voice resonated.  The weather was clear and pleasant. The cultivators, immersed in the mystical realms of Dao and swordsmanship, lost track of time.</p><p>Only the words "This concludes the lecture" jolted them back to reality, though the lingering enchantment held them captive.  Qin Sang's voice seemed to echo in their ears.  Some even found their previously stubborn cultivation bottlenecks subtly loosening.</p><p>"We thank Grandmaster Qin for her teachings!" someone shouted.</p><p>The mountainside cultivators prostrated themselves en masse, their voices rising in a chorus.  The sound, like a tidal wave, reverberated through the mountains.</p><p>On the Celestial Stage, the Yuan Ying cultivators rose, bowing their thanks to Qin Sang; they too had gained much. Qin Sang accepted their gratitude, a wave of her sleeve dispersing the clouds to conceal the stage. The ceremony concluded.</p><p>The mountainside cultivators, still unsatisfied, lingered.  Meanwhile, Li Yu Fu and others hastily descended the mountain, separating to pursue their respective tasks.</p><p>Those who achieved immediate enlightenment during Qin Sang's lecture were clearly exceptionally gifted. While this applied to the sect disciples, the independent cultivators were particularly noteworthy and couldn't be overlooked.  The newly established Qingyang Temple needed to attract new disciples.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang couldn't indiscriminately accept all applicants; she had established specific criteria. Some departed, some remained.</p><p>Gradually, calm returned to Qingyang Temple.  The inner disciples exchanged admiring glances, their joy and respect evident as they gazed towards the main peak, marked with the character for "Sword"—the symbol of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Leaving aside the mountainside affairs, on the Celestial Stage, the Yuan Ying cultivators engaged in further discussions on the Dao, using Qin Sang's teachings as a springboard.</p>
