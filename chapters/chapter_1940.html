<h1>Chapter 1931: The Hunt</h1><p>Zhu Que, seemingly excited by something, gesticulated wildly.</p><p>Xiao Wu lowered his head, following Zhu Que's gaze.</p><p>Below the sheer cliff was a lush jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees towered, their canopies intertwined, forming an impenetrable thicket. Occasionally, vines as thick as pythons could be seen stretching down from the canopy.</p><p>'Chirp… chirp…'</p><p>"Tweet…"</p><p>'Flap… flap… flap!'</p><p>This was a bird's paradise; nests were visible everywhere in the treetops, and the sounds of rustling leaves and scurrying creatures could be heard from below.</p><p>However, the roars of large predators were almost nonexistent; beasts like wolves, tigers, and leopards seemed scarce.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, traces of human passage were visible, a narrow path carved through the thorns and undergrowth.</p><p>It wasn't exactly a deep mountain.</p><p>The path extended from the outside world, disappearing at the base of the mountain.</p><p>Overgrown with weeds, it was difficult to spot unless one looked carefully.  Few people used this path, probably a hunting trail blazed by local hunters.</p><p>Following the path outward, the mountain gradually leveled off. When Qin Sang and the others arrived, they had seen a village in the distance.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay a true wilderness, rarely visited by humans, where predatory animals abounded.</p><p>Zhu Que was looking at that very path.</p><p>The sun was high now, bathing the forest in sunlight.  At the other end of the path, a figure appeared.</p><p>The newcomer was a boy, seemingly fourteen or fifteen years old, dressed in coarse homespun clothing and straw sandals – clearly from a poor family.  Yet his clothes were clean, and his brow held a determined air, combined with an unexpected scholarly grace.</p><p>He walked with one hand gripping a bundle of rope and the other holding a sharpened steel pick, his pace surprisingly light despite the uneven path.</p><p>The knuckles on his hands, gripping the rope and pick, were thick and prominent – a sign of martial arts training.</p><p>Hunters usually possessed some martial skill; otherwise, even entering the mountains would be difficult, let alone hunting beasts.</p><p>Whether this boy was collecting firewood or hunting, his courage to enter the mountains alone at such a young age was remarkable.</p><p>'Rustle… rustle… rustle!'</p><p>He was, after all, neither a cultivator nor a skilled martial artist capable of traversing rooftops and leaving no trace in the snow.  His body brushed against the tall grasses, inevitably making noise.</p><p>His brow remained furrowed, his vigilance constant, as he scanned for danger, pausing frequently to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Soon, a mountain appeared to the east, casting both the path and the boy into shadow.</p><p>It became clear then that he wasn't hunting. He slowed his pace, carefully examining the mountainside to his right.</p><p>This mountain wasn't as majestic and breathtaking as the one where Qin Sang and the others were.</p><p>This slope was alternately steep and gentle, covered with vegetation.  Steep sections featured hundred-foot-high cliffs, while gentler slopes could easily be climbed on foot.</p><p>The boy seemed to be searching for something, moving slowly and methodically, pausing occasionally to think.</p><p>Finally, spotting a location that met his expectations, his eyes brightened. He quickly approached.</p><p>His target was a cliff face, about a hundred feet above the path, beyond a gentle slope.</p><p>Just as he was about to ascend, he seemed to remember something. Glancing at the sky, he marked a line on the ground with his pick, scanned the slope, and with a powerful leap, landed steadily on a rock. Repeating this several times, he reached the cliff face and looked up.</p><p>The cliff itself wasn't more than a hundred feet high, but it was relatively flat, with clumps of grass growing on it.</p><p>A tree stubbornly grew horizontally from a crack in the rock, with vines entwined around its trunk. Two vines drooped almost to the ground.</p><p>The cliff wasn't wide; earthen slopes bordered both sides, with a large tree pressed close to the cliff on the right, also covered with vines.</p><p>The boy recognized this vine; it was exceptionally tough and could be used as rope.</p><p>He quickly scanned the entire cliff, his eyes flickering, seemingly pondering something, before finally focusing on the top of the cliff.</p><p>Looking up, a dark mass was visible – a large boulder protruding slightly. The boulder itself was uneven, round, and precariously perched, raising concerns about it potentially rolling down.</p><p>The boy was after this boulder.  Using the same method, he leaped from the side slope to the top of the cliff, grasped the boulder, and gently pushed it.  The boulder remained unmoved.</p><p>He increased his strength, feeling the large stone shift slightly.  A joyful expression crossed his face.  Ignoring the danger, he lay prone at the edge of the cliff, observing where the base of the stone met the cliff face, trying to insert the steel chisel.</p><p>Next, he worked tirelessly, measuring and marking with the chisel and rope.</p><p>The boy was so engrossed in his work that he suddenly remembered something.  He looked at the line he had drawn earlier and saw the mountain's shadow was about to cross it. His expression tightened, and he quickly hid the chisel and rope in the grass before running back.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Zhu Que and Xiao Wu, who had been watching with great interest, were quite surprised to see the boy suddenly rushing back as if fleeing a predator.</p><p>"He'll be back tomorrow," Zhu Que declared confidently.</p><p>The next day, at the same time, the boy arrived as promised.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel. He retrieved the rope and chisel from the grass and resumed his work.  As before, he left promptly when the time came.</p><p>From then on, while Qin Sang was busy repairing the thunder altar, the boy became a source of amusement for Zhu Que and Xiao Wu's otherwise monotonous life.</p><p>Zhu Que even wanted to bet with Xiao Wu on what the boy was up to, but Xiao Wu wasn't interested.</p><p>This didn't dampen Zhu Que's enthusiasm; her favorite part of the day was sunrise.  However, to maintain their curiosity, they refrained from using their supernatural abilities to investigate the boy's intentions.</p><p>Over time, the boy brought new tools each visit.</p><p>For example, wire mesh wrapped with strangely colored nails – likely poisoned.</p><p>Then, a wooden shaft with an iron tip, sharpened to a deadly point.</p><p>And various ingenious mechanisms.</p><p>These mechanisms, the product of a hunter's ingenuity, were for setting traps, their construction quite sophisticated.</p><p>The boy tested and retested them, spending over two weeks before selecting the most suitable ones.</p><p>"See! I guessed from the start that he was building traps!"</p><p>Zhu Que, smugly satisfied, boasted to Xiao Wu.</p><p>But it was puzzling.  The boy's efforts suggested he was hunting exceptionally dangerous beasts, yet no such creatures existed nearby. The deep mountain's beasts were blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>The boy was incredibly patient, toiling for over a month before finally completing the trap.</p><p>On the final day, he meticulously checked every mechanism, carefully erasing any trace of his work, even covering the indelible marks on the rocks with moss from elsewhere.</p><p>He didn't leave any bait, nor did he lure any beasts. When the time came, he went home.</p><p>"This kid's concealment isn't perfect enough. Let me give him a hand."</p><p>Zhu Que, ever the mischief-maker, chuckled, flapping her wings.</p><p>For the next three days, there was no sign of the boy.  Zhu Que, becoming increasingly impatient, almost flew to the village to find him and discover his purpose.</p><p>On the fourth day, as the sun rose in the east, the boy reappeared.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, though his pace remained brisk.</p><p>This time, he passed the trap without stopping, heading straight for their mountain.</p><p>It was his first time entering the mountains in days.</p><p>The dense foliage couldn't hide the boy from Zhu Que and Xiao Wu.  They watched as he moved with the agility of a monkey through the trees.</p><p>He had a small crossbow strapped to his right arm.  With the trap and crossbow working in tandem, his hunt was fruitful.</p><p>Descending the mountain, his bag contained several birds, and he carried a fairly large deer.</p><p>Back on the mountain path, noticing the time, he saw it was almost his usual departure time.  But this time, instead of going home, he took his game to the trap and, at a pre-selected spot on the north slope of the cliff, built a fire. He took a bird, gutted it, and placed it on the fire.</p><p>The bird was plump and soon began to sizzle, its aroma spreading far and wide.</p><p>What happened next was astonishing. Unaffected by the delicious smell, he drew a short blade from his waist, gestured towards his left arm, and, with a grimace, plunged it into his skin, making a deep cut.</p><p>Flesh and blood were exposed, bright red staining his clothes. The smell of blood mingled with the aroma of roasting meat.</p><p>'Hiss!'</p><p>The boy gasped, tore a strip of cloth, bit one end, and began to bandage his wound.</p><p>The bleeding, however, wouldn't stop easily.  The cloth was soon soaked through.</p><p>His face pale from blood loss, he emptied a waterskin, gulping down the liquid, before returning his attention to the cooking meat.</p><p>Soon...</p><p>On the mountaintop where the boy was, a white shadow suddenly appeared and vanished in an instant.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>Zhu Que, who was watching the spectacle, couldn't help but lower her voice, her eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>"No wonder, so it's hunting a demon!  This kid must have nerves of steel, doesn't he?"</p><p>Xiao Wu's eyes flickered as well.</p><p>The white shadow's movements didn't escape their notice; it was a common-level white weasel demon.</p><p>Although human warriors who reach the Innate stage possess considerable fighting power and might potentially kill low-level Qi Refinement cultivators, the boy was clearly not one of those top experts.  Daring to lure the weasel to kill him could be described as incredibly reckless.</p><p>The weasel moved stealthily, traversing the grass without a sound, silently approaching the boy from behind before suddenly attacking.</p><p>The boy appeared to be focused on roasting meat, but his mind remained alert. However, the weasel was too fast; by the time he sensed the wind, he had no time to dodge.</p><p>The weasel closed in instantly, its two sharp claws striking at the boy's back.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The sound that echoed was that of metal colliding with metal.</p><p>Beneath the torn clothes were iron plates.</p><p>Based on the bodies of Master Fu and others, and descriptions from survivors, the boy had deduced that this demon beast favored surprise attacks, targeting the back; hence the iron plates for protection.</p><p>Unfortunately, the weasel's claws were incredibly sharp and pierced through the iron plates!</p><p>The boy felt a sharp pain in his back, and a terrifying force slammed into him through the plates. He instinctively lunged forward.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The boy fell face-first against a rock wall, taking the grill and its roasting meat with him into the sand below.</p><p>His whole body ached, his internal organs displaced.</p><p>Even in this situation, before hitting the ground, the boy managed to half-twist his body, aiming the light crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>Failing to kill its prey, the weasel let out a shriek.</p><p>"Zee!"</p><p>The cry was incredibly sharp.</p><p>At the same time, the weasel turned into a white shadow, leaping down after the boy, continuing the pursuit.  It shook the fur under its chin, releasing a puff of white smoke that enveloped the boy.</p><p>The boy, well-prepared, had already closed his eyes and held his breath.</p><p>Despite his precautions, the shriek caused his head to ring, and he felt a bit dazed, even with cotton stuffed in his ears.</p><p>The smoke and the strange cry were terrifying demonic arts. The village's most skilled hunter had died from these arts, helpless, instilling fear in the villagers.</p><p>Luckily, this weasel didn't appear in the mornings; villagers only dared to work during the morning, closing their doors and windows after noon. No one dared hunt demons.</p><p>His preparations proved somewhat effective; the boy didn't lose consciousness immediately.  With sheer willpower, he propped up his left arm and fired his crossbow.</p><p>The weasel pounced, and the boy's left arm seemed about to be torn apart.  Fortunately, he had also secured iron plates on his forearm, though even these were ripped open, leaving a deep wound down to the bone.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Three crossbow bolts shot out, their tips reflecting a bluish light, having been previously poisoned.</p><p>The weasel was forced to dodge, twisting incredibly to avoid the three bolts, emerging unharmed.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The boy crashed to the ground, spitting blood.</p><p>The weasel greedily eyed the vibrant body, preparing to leap down.</p><p>Just then, something triggered a mechanism; the sand beneath them exploded upwards.</p><p>From the trees on either side, two curved branches snapped straight, making a loud *bang*.</p><p>Vines hanging from the branches were suddenly pulled from the sand.</p><p>Several vines were tightly bound to a wire mesh, which sprang from the ground, creating a net in an instant.  The weasel was about to be trapped inside and impaled by the wire's nails.</p><p>Being a demon with considerable cunning, the weasel reacted quickly, grabbing the edge of the net and leaping high.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the net's launch activated another trap. A vine clinging to the rock face was pulled, dislodging a large stone perched at the cliff's edge.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A strong gust of wind ruffled the weasel's fur.</p><p>The weasel was completely shrouded in the stone's shadow. With its level of cultivation, if struck by the rock, it would be crushed to pieces.</p><p>"Zee!"</p><p>The weasel, enraged beyond measure, let out a shrill cry.</p><p>*Puff!* *Thwack!*</p><p>At the last moment, the weasel hastily released a puff of smoke to briefly impede the stone, grabbing its edge with its front paws and kicking off with its back paws.  With a skillful somersault, it evaded the falling boulder.</p><p>But this wasn't the end of the traps. As the boulder fell, a third, interconnected trap sprung into action, with the clicking of a mechanism echoing from the ground, and cold steel glinting from the grass.</p><p>Five poisoned spears on each side, taking advantage of the weasel's airborne, powerless state, shot out suddenly.</p><p>*Swish! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The spears' force was comparable to a powerful crossbow, swift as lightning.</p><p>The ten poisoned spears crisscrossed, their force such that the seasoned weasel had nowhere to escape, its enraged cry changing to a terrified shriek.</p><p>*Pch!* *Bang!*</p><p>Demon blood traced a line on the ground.</p><p>A spear pierced the weasel, its tip buried deep in the tree trunk, its shaft still trembling.</p><p>"Magnificent!"</p><p>Zhu Que clapped her wings vigorously. "A pity; this little weasel bears the aura of a cultivator; it must have been someone's pet. This boy is in for trouble."</p>
