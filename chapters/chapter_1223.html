<h1>Chapter 1215: Blood Lake</h1><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>After a chase, Qin Sang, relying on the powers of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, finally arrived at the Sealed Lake with the Snake King, evading Ye Laomo's pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the ancient restrictions here.  He instantly entered the dark clouds, easily passing through the ancient barriers, and reached the lake bottom. He then used the ebony sword to disturb the seal in the lake, and the passage reappeared.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Laomo's figure appeared above the dark clouds.</p><p>Along the way, he almost lost sight of his target several times.</p><p>The other party seemed to understand the Abyssal Ruins better than he, the owner of this place.</p><p>By now, if Ye Laomo still hadn't guessed that Qin Sang possessed a treasure specialized in breaking restrictions, it would have been a waste of his many years of cultivation.</p><p>After staring at the dark clouds for a moment, Ye Laomo saw that the ancient restrictions here were already loosened. Breaking them wouldn't be difficult, but it would inevitably waste some time.</p><p>Tian Shi Sect headquarters.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King surfaced.</p><p>"Mingyue, you came in from here! I knew I shouldn't have kept it from you that day. If we had come together, explored the Abyssal Ruins first, perhaps things wouldn't have been so complicated..."</p><p>Having fought side-by-side for so long, the wariness between the Snake King and Qin Sang had lessened, replaced by a greater trust, allowing them to address each other by their names.</p><p>The demonic clouds around the Snake King were dissipating, indicating serious injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I also went through a lot of trouble to find this place..."</p><p>He then went to the secret realm's exit, only to find several Abyssal Cultivators patrolling nearby.  They had obviously received news and were searching for the exit.</p><p>They exchanged a glance, both aware that Ye Laomo would be chasing after them soon, and that they had to force their way out.</p><p>"Once we're out, we'll split up and draw their attention."</p><p>The Snake King transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang had the same idea.</p><p>Deep within the Heavenly Scar, a patrol of four guards reached a black forest.</p><p>"Senior Feng asked us to look for the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins.  Why have we never heard of this before?  Besides that cave, are there really other entrances to the Abyssal Ruins?"</p><p>One of the guards asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p>"These secrets aren't for us to know!  Since both senior masters mentioned it, it must be true.  They probably want to take advantage of the turmoil in the Crime God Palace to…"</p><p>He trailed off, suddenly staring blankly at a pile of rocks outside the forest.</p><p>The others followed his gaze and discovered unusual fluctuations on the pile of rocks. Then, two figures emerged from the fluctuations.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A sword and a knife instantly ended the lives of the four guards.  However, an urgent bell rang in the distance, and they sensed the approach of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"Alas! We were a step too slow. They sent a signal."</p><p>The Snake King sighed softly, conjuring a demonic wind and soaring into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang left from another direction.</p><p>Chaos erupted within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>At this time, Ye Laomo finally tracked them down. He extended his divine sense to its limit, locking onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Outside the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>Qin Sang used his lightning escape technique to its fullest, shaking off other pursuers, but he still felt a faint divine sense constantly locking onto him.</p><p>"Sigh! The gap in cultivation is all-encompassing. Some things can't be compensated for by treasures or divine abilities.  When I return, I must find a way to obtain the Ancestral Sacred Fire and cultivate the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' to improve my divine sense.  At least then, escaping divine sense locks will be much easier."</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang summoned the ebony sword, combining sword escape and lightning escape, further increasing his speed.</p><p>In the daytime, Qin Sang turned into a thunderbolt, tearing through the sky.</p><p>Ordinary people thought it was a falling star.</p><p>Only cultivators could sense the powerful aura in the lightning, feeling frightened.</p><p>Ye Laomo thought Qin Sang was using some kind of overdrafting secret technique to forcibly increase his speed.  However, he showed no signs of slowing down.</p><p>At this time, his eyebrows suddenly furrowed. He sensed a disturbance at the Blood Lake and, after some thought, gave up the pursuit.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang disappear from sight, Ye Laomo coldly snorted and returned to the Tian Shi Sect headquarters.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyssal Ruins was searching for something there.  It was the white-haired elder who had been guarding the cave entrance earlier. Upon seeing Ye Laomo, he chuckled bitterly: "Han Xi self-destructed his treasure, Wan Daoyou has already gone after him, but he hasn't returned yet. I am incompetent; the Snake King escaped, his cultivation is higher than mine, and I couldn't break through his concealment technique."</p><p>Ye Laomo said indifferently, "We were constrained by the Blood Lake and couldn't give our all, so it's normal for them to escape. Pay attention to that Mingyue Demon King in the future. Although I didn't manage to capture him, I almost forced out all his abilities.  Warn the others to be careful, lest more people fall victim to him."</p><p>“Yes! I have carefully investigated the area. I suspect that this might be the headquarters of a sect from thousands of years ago, the Tian Shi Sect. The Tian Shi Sect has always been mysterious and was once besieged by the righteous sects of that time."</p><p>Legend has it that the sect master possessed a corpse king-level undead creature.  Later, the high-ranking officials disappeared suddenly, and the Sky Corpse Sect fell silent.  Unexpectedly, the Sky Corpse Sect's main hall is located here and connects to the Abyssal Realm. This person may have inherited the Sky Corpse Sect…"  The white-haired elder pointed at the main hall.</p><p>"The Sky Corpse Sect?"</p><p>Ye Laomo nodded indifferently, "Seal this place, but leave this passage open; it might be useful."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Ye Laomo activated the passage to return to the Abyssal Realm.</p><p>The white-haired elder looked worried, "Elder Ye, the Serpent King and Bright Moon Demon King returning may tell the Two Realms Alliance about the Blood Lake.  Anyone who has been deep into the Limitless Valley will easily connect this, guessing our plan. We thought we could get away with it, while the Two Realms Alliance was preoccupied at the front lines, and wouldn't notice the anomaly in the Limitless Valley.  But they suddenly broke into the Abyssal Realm. I wonder if it's fate…"</p><p>"Heh, what fate?  Even if they guess, so what? They can't guess our true purpose. At most, they'll enter at the same time, but we'll be one step ahead and gain the advantage."</p><p>Ye Laomo waved his hand and stepped into the passage.</p><p>Seeing Ye Laomo so calm, the white-haired elder's worry lessened.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang felt the divine sense locked onto him disappear, but he still didn't dare relax. He almost depleted the lightning power in his phoenix wings before escaping into a deep mountain range.</p><p>Certain no one was following, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. This Abyssal Realm trip was extremely dangerous, but thankfully his abilities were strong enough to escape.  He wondered how the Serpent King and the others fared.</p><p>After a brief rest, he continued on, leaving the Sinful Abyss.</p><p>Before they separated, he and the Serpent King had agreed on a meeting place in the desert.</p><p>"It's a treasure I've never heard of. It's not a magic weapon, but possibly a spiritual material…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the white copper.  He recalled the classics he had read, but found no relevant records. It seemed to be a very rare spiritual material, but he didn't know its name.</p><p>Qin Sang had placed a restriction on the white copper; its white light had dimmed slightly, but was still dazzling.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to carefully examine the properties of the white copper, he sensed a message from the Primordial Heart Ring from Fat Chicken.</p><p>"Master, my mother and I saw an identical Blood Lake in the Limitless Valley…"</p><p>Fat Chicken seemed to have hesitated for a long time, his tone lacking confidence.</p>
