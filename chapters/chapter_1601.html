<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang left Gong Xingqing behind and quickly walked out of the quiet chamber.</p><p>The token in his hand guided the way.</p><p>Before long, the token led Qin Sang to a room. An attendant was already waiting there.  Opening the door, he respectfully said, "Senior, please enter."</p><p>Behind the door wasn't a room, but winding stone steps leading down a narrow, long passage to an unknown destination.</p><p>The attendant led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang detected fluctuations of restrictions within the passage. However, they weren't meant to confine those who passed through, but rather to isolate spiritual sense detection.</p><p>The attendant's cultivation wasn't weak, and he was proficient in movement techniques, his speed swift. Qin Sang followed without any effort.</p><p>The dark passage seemed endless.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the distance and realized they had already left Tianzhong Prefecture, feeling slightly surprised.</p><p>After hurrying like this for a while,</p><p>Ahead, the light suddenly dimmed, and a stone wall appeared.</p><p>The attendant stopped and turned, saying, "Reporting to Senior, this junior can only escort you this far. After exiting, Senior can rely on the token's guidance to ascertain the location of the Treasure Exchange. This is a disguise treasure prepared by our hall for Senior.  Combined with the formations at the exchange, it can isolate divine sense and prevent others from prying."</p><p>Having said this, the attendant handed Qin Sang a jade pendant-shaped talisman treasure, bowed respectfully, and turned back to the passage.  Then, both he and the passage vanished into thin air before Qin Sang's eyes. Whether it was the work of mechanisms or restrictions, it clearly demonstrated the deep roots of the Six Prefectures Hall in this place, their complete control over Tianzhong Prefecture.</p><p>His previous guess was most likely correct; the headquarters of the Six Prefectures Hall was very likely in this city.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then activated the jade pendant. His figure blurred and transformed into a withered young Daoist.  He then took out a mask treasure he had prepared and put it on.</p><p>Confirming there were no abnormalities outside, he pushed the door open.</p><p>Outside the stone door was a mountain cliff.</p><p>As expected, he had been led to the wilderness.</p><p>Tall yellow grass swayed.</p><p>Birds and beasts cried.</p><p>A faint light glimmered not far ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to set off when he suddenly heard a 'kacha kacha' sound behind him. Turning his head, he saw a graceful Daoist nun emerging from the opposite cliff face.</p><p>This person was certainly also disguised. Their appearance held no meaning; outwardly a Daoist nun, their true identity, male or female, was unknown.</p><p>Upon exiting the passage, Qin Sang had sensed the fluctuations of a spiritual formation. He was already within the formation. When he activated his divine sense, he felt an unprecedented difficulty, his spiritual perception restricted by an invisible force.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly was unaffected, but Qin Sang couldn't be sure whether the Six Prefectures Hall had secretly arranged countermeasures for such divine abilities.</p><p>The cultivators participating in the Treasure Exchange possessed extraordinary cultivation.</p><p>Even the slightest fluctuation from the Celestial Eye divine ability wouldn't escape their spiritual perception. It was best not to take risks, lest he become a target.</p><p>Their eyes met, and both were momentarily stunned. Then, they casually looked away, deliberately keeping a distance between them as they flew toward the light.</p><p>Approaching closer,</p><p>Ahead was a secluded pond.</p><p>The vegetation around the pond had been cleared. Several tables and cushions were placed by the pond, where a few individuals sat scattered, some having arrived even earlier than him.</p><p>Within the pond, several brocaded carp swam, their tails swaying as they spat out pearls, the source of the light.</p><p>The pearl light wasn't particularly bright.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang and the others, the presence or absence of light made little difference.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the Daoist nun drew near, those seated noticed their arrival. Some glanced at them, while others continued to cultivate with their eyes closed.  No one made any rude attempts to pry.</p><p>The Daoist nun sat down without a word.</p><p>Casually finding a cushion at the edge, Qin Sang sat down cross-legged and glanced around, not seeing anyone from the Six Prefectures Hall.</p><p>After they sat, the number of people arriving suddenly increased, the sound of breaking air constantly echoing. In just a few dozen breaths, Nascent Soul cultivators arrived one after another, filling most of the seats.</p><p>Despite so many people, it remained quiet.</p><p>Some came in groups, but only communicated discreetly among themselves.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Suddenly, a splash echoed, and a cloud of mist erupted from the center of the pond, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>Mist arose from level ground, and a figure appeared.</p><p>A white-haired elder stood on the water's surface. His gaze swept over the crowd, and he smiled, cupping his hands in a circular greeting. "This old man, Jiang You, greets all fellow Daoists. Among those present, there must be close friends of mine, though I cannot recognize your identities at present. Given the hasty arrangements and humble location, I apologize for any shortcomings."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, someone below jested, "Who among us doesn't know the illustrious name of Vice Hall Master Jiang?  Is there a need for introductions?"</p><p>"Is it truly Fellow Daoist Jiang? Could this also be a disguise? This humble one has heard that Fellow Daoist Jiang wields the Seven Paths Soul-Snatching Spear, capturing souls and hooking spirits. Why not demonstrate it and verify your identity?" Another spoke sarcastically.</p><p>Jiang You wasn't offended, his smile unwavering. "All of you possess extraordinary divine abilities. Whether this old man is disguised surely cannot escape your discerning eyes.  Among those present, there are fellow Daoists whose spear techniques far surpass my own.  I shall refrain from making a fool of myself..."</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up.</p><p>The Six Prefectures Hall had two Vice Hall Masters, with a mysterious Hall Master above them.  Of the two Vice Hall Masters, Jiang Mu held this Jiang You in high regard. Qin Sang had heard of him long ago.</p><p>Another person arrived.</p><p>Jiang You glanced at the sky and said in a deep voice, "The time has come. The Treasure Exchange shall now begin. For those fellow Daoists who have not arrived, I can only express my regrets."</p><p>He formed a single-handed seal and struck it toward the void. The power of the formation suddenly converged, covering only the area around the pond, even blocking the light there, creating a secluded space.</p><p>The crowd stirred slightly, surprised.</p><p>As long as the qualifications were met, surely more participants were better.</p><p>The Six Prefectures Hall's actions were excessively cautious.  Was it the client's request?</p><p>"Surnamed Jiang, since you are merely the organizers, why must you show your face? Where is the host? We have been at their beck and call for so long, do they intend to remain hidden?"</p><p>The speaker's voice was low and hoarse, their tone dissatisfied.</p><p>He had arrived with another person and sat on the left side. The person on the right remained motionless with closed eyes, seemingly of higher status.</p><p>"The host is among you. This old man is entrusted to preside on their behalf. The host is generous; there will be no commission taken for this exchange. When the time is right, the host will reveal themselves. Fellow Daoist, do not be impatient.  Our hall operates openly and strives to satisfy all the requests of our esteemed guests. Should any of you have future needs, it will be the same."</p><p>Jiang You explained the reason while also seizing the opportunity to promote the Six Prefectures Hall.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked around, suspecting everyone of being the host.</p><p>This was truly the strangest Treasure Exchange they had ever attended.</p><p>The host hiding their identity, afraid to show themselves, either possessed a highly sensitive identity with many enemies or was preparing to trade treasures of great importance.</p><p>This, however, increased everyone's anticipation.</p><p>"The rules of the Treasure Exchange, you all should be aware of, so I need not elaborate.  I will only mention one thing: during the exchange, once the host makes a bid, under the same conditions, the host takes priority.  Do not let this cause any discord." Jiang You emphasized this reminder.</p><p>This was a standard rule, and no one objected.</p><p>Jiang You nodded, raised his palm, and the water in the pond surged, forming a platform. With a flick of his sleeve, three items appeared out of thin air. "Let this old man start the proceedings. Here are three treasures."</p><p>He first pointed to the twin rings on the left. "These are special magic weapons, the Moon Reflecting Rings, unparalleled in sharpness, specifically designed to break protectiveç½¡ shrouds. As for other powers, they are difficult to describe. In a moment, this old man will loosen a restriction, allowing you to investigate with your divine senses."</p><p>In the middle was a round pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it for a few moments.  Wasn't this the Corpse Soul Pearl that Bai had obtained after hunting the Corpse King?</p><p>The surface of the Corpse Soul Pearl was bluish-black, with condensed corpse Qi within. Occasionally, a terrifying face would appear within it. However, this Corpse Soul Pearl was much weaker than Bai's.</p><p>"This is from a Nascent Soul stage Corpse King. Unfortunately, the Corpse Soul Pearl was left undiscovered for many years, and its power has diminished. For fellow Daoists of the Corpse Ghost Dao, it remains a rare treasure."</p><p>The third item was a cyan crystal stone. The cyan light manifested as a swirling wind, giving a sense of lightness. It held great benefits for cultivating wind-based divine abilities.</p><p>"Three treasures, to be exchanged for Five Elements Dao magic weapons, or other easily circulated treasures. Spirit stones may also be used for transactions, with a base price of ten thousand, and each increment no less than ten thousand," Jiang You announced the conditions.</p><p>Indeed, it was just to get things started.</p><p>The three treasures themselves were not of low value, but their applications were somewhat limited. The most valuable Corpse Soul Pearl, due to its diminished power, wouldn't fetch a high price.</p><p>As for spirit stones, it was best to take that with a grain of salt.  Spirit stone transactions were practically unheard of at these kinds of Treasure Exchanges.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Moon Reflecting Rings. Hiså¦æ Treasure Pearl was aç½¡ shroud type defensive magic weapon. He never expected the first treasure to be a counter to his own.</p><p>Such magic weapons were not uncommon in the cultivation world.  Qin Sang couldn't possibly seize them all.  He possessed the spiritual treasure and the Sun God Tree; as long as he could land a hit, an additional Moon Reflecting Ring wouldn't be of much help.</p><p>Relatively speaking, he was more interested in the Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>Bai had advanced by refining a Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>But Ya Gu's intelligence hadn't yet recovered, and Qin Sang couldn't communicate directly with her. Otherwise, purchasing the Corpse Soul Pearl and helping Ya Gu refine it would certainly yield considerable benefits.</p><p>After considering it, Qin Sang still didn't make a move.</p><p>Ya Gu's lifespan exceeded the norm, but she was only at the Qi Refining stage before her slumber. Forcibly refining a Nascent Soul stage Corpse Soul Pearl, no one could predict the consequences.</p><p>Searching for the Ghost Mother and hoping for Fatty's advancement were more reliable.</p><p>In the end, all three treasures were exchanged for magic weapons.</p><p>Jiang You, beaming, landed at the edge of the pond.  "Fellow Daoists, please begin."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a figure rushed out from the frontmost seat, taking the lead.  "Haha... This old man is a bit impatient, please forgive me!  Behold, this is an Earth Essence Pearl, meticulously condensed by this old man over many years using profound techniques in a place of converging earth Qi. For fellow Daoists cultivating earth-attributed cultivation methods, refining this pearl has the effect of assisting breakthroughs, the lower the realm, the better the effect... In exchange for a living, Transformation stage Earth Spirit."</p><p>Silence followed.</p><p>Many coveted the treasure, but unable to meet the elder's request, they offered other conditions, all of which were rejected.</p><p>Disappointment evident on his face, the elder prepared to return.</p><p>At that moment, the armored, burly man sitting not far from Qin Sang's right suddenly spoke, "I do not have a living Earth Spirit, but a hundred years ago, I encountered a group. There should be an Earth Spirit leader among them. This place is remote, and Earth Spirits rarely relocate their nests. They should still be there. After the Treasure Exchange concludes, I will personally lead you there and assist you in capturing the Earth Spirit... Is that acceptable?"</p><p>The elder's face lit up with joy. "Acceptable!"</p><p>The two communicated via voice transmission, discussing something in secret.</p><p>Satisfied, the elder flew back to his seat, and immediately others lined up to follow.</p><p>Next, some, like the elder, returned with their desires fulfilled, while others left empty-handed.</p><p>As the Treasure Exchange progressed, Qin Sang truly felt the vastness and richness of Zhongzhou.</p><p>Most of the items were various rare spiritual materials.</p><p>Exotic treasures appeared one after another, many of which were extremely rare in the North Sea, even extinct, exceeding the Demon Assembly of years past by more than a single level.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't had a clear goal, he would have been unable to resist making a move several times already.</p><p>There were some items Qin Sang had never even heard of, and couldn't judge their value.</p><p>Magic weapons rarely appeared at the exchange.</p><p>After all, the participating cultivators weren't lacking in top-grade magic weapons.</p><p>But surprisingly, someone actually offered a pseudo-spiritual treasure, and it wasn't someone's natal magic weapon, meaning it could be refined by others normally!</p><p>Qin Sang needed to improve in many areas, and refining techniques were last on his list. After entering Zhongzhou, he hadn't specifically inquired about Zhongzhou's refining heritage.</p><p>As expected, Zhongzhou had even more profound refining techniques!</p><p>This was quickly confirmed.</p><p>"A refining secret art, the 'Soul Shackling Art,' capable of refining pseudo-spiritual treasures, and not requiring a natal magic weapon," A Daoist in green robes floated gracefully onto the water platform, taking out a jade slip.</p><p>Before he could announce his conditions, surprised voices arose from below. "Soul Shackling Art? Could it be one of the three great inheritances of the ancient sect, Profound Artifact Mountain, in the South Sea?"</p><p>"Indeed!" The Daoist nodded with a smile.</p><p>"By mastering the 'Soul Shackling Art,' one can refine spiritual treasures! A thousand years ago, the Qiong Ying Sect discovered the ruins of Profound Artifact Mountain on the shores of the South Sea and obtained half of the treasures. It is said that a fragmented scroll of the 'Soul Shackling Art' also fell into the hands of the Qiong Ying Sect. Could fellow Daoist possess the complete 'Soul Shackling Art'?" The person continued to question.</p><p>"Not so," The Daoist shook his head. "What this poor Daoist holds is also a fragmented scroll. As to whether it is the same as the portion held by the Qiong Ying Sect, this poor Daoist cannot say. I can also include the portions I have comprehended myself, but it cannot refine spiritual treasures, only pseudo-spiritual treasures."</p><p>The person chuckled. "Pseudo-spiritual treasures are sufficient. Spiritual treasures are not something we can consider yet, unless we don't wish to ascend to Deity Transformation?"</p><p>Refining spiritual treasures was not a task accomplished overnight, nor even by a single person.</p><p>The back-and-forth between the two made it hard not to suspect they had a prior agreement.</p><p>After a moment of silence,</p><p>A female cultivator's voice echoed from the gathering.</p><p>"What does fellow Daoist wish to exchange for the 'Soul Shackling Art'?"</p><p>The Daoist's eyes brightened, and he listed over a dozen extremely rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures, leaving everyone speechless.  Then he said, "Fellow Daoist need only provide three of these."</p><p>The female cultivator remained silent for a moment, then asked, "Three heavenly materials and earthly treasures for a fragmented scroll, the conditions are too harsh!  Why doesn't fellow Daoist directly seek a trade with the Qiong Ying Sect?"</p><p>The Daoist in green remained silent.</p><p>The female cultivator didn't press further. "I need to see a portion of the secret art first."</p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p>The Daoist in green looked towards Jiang You.</p><p>Jiang You made a hand seal and nodded slightly.</p><p>A wisp of divine sense subtly probed the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the jade slip, quite interested.</p><p>But not now.</p><p>He would have time to study this later, and then visit sects specializing in refining techniques for guidance.</p><p>"I'll take it."</p><p>The female cultivator took out three jade boxes and tossed them into the pond. The Daoist in green examined them one by one, his face revealing delight. He then flicked the jade slip towards the female cultivator and returned to his seat.</p><p>The exchange continued, with participants coming and going.</p><p>Still, the host remained unseen, and there were no treasures for strengthening divine sense, which Qin Sang anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly took out the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal and stood up.</p>
