<h1>Chapter 2108: Breakthrough</h1><p>Chapter 790: Breakthrough</p><p>Qin Sang never truly had a master.  The person who guided him most was a wandering cultivator, a mentor and friend, but after being sent to the Canglang Sea, they were separated by thousands of miles, and hadn't seen each other in decades.</p><p>Especially in the way of the sword, Qin Sang had always explored alone. He had never encountered such a dedicated teacher.  This teacher could always pinpoint his weakest points with accuracy.</p><p>Thanks to his cultivation technique, Qin Sang independently mastered Sword Qi Thunder Sound, but without guidance, the process was lengthy, and his understanding of Sword Light Divergence progressed slowly.</p><p>However, the long process wasn't without its benefits. Without that experience, his current improvement wouldn't have been so rapid.  Meeting such a master now could be considered the culmination of years of hard work.</p><p>Qin Sang re-entered the passage. He hadn't fully recovered. Swords have no eyes; the swordsmen wouldn't kill him, but injuries were unavoidable, especially in the last few battles, leaving several sword wounds on Qin Sang's body.</p><p>He took some pills to suppress his injuries, and without looking back, walked in. This was a rare opportunity, time was limited, and he had to comprehend as much as possible before the Seven Killing Hall closed.</p><p>Re-entering the passage, the familiar blue light descended, and the swordsmen appeared. This time, Qin Sang had experience. He didn't rush to defeat the swordsmen, but instead, cast aside all distracting thoughts, forgot everything, and comprehended the sword through battle.</p><p>He was defeated repeatedly, and returned to the passage again and again. The wounds on Qin Sang's body multiplied, but he ignored them. Wiping away the blood, he took pills and charged into the passage, greedily absorbing everything.</p><p>His swordsmanship was rapidly improving. Now, his swordsmanship was no longer confined to a particular style. He could act as he pleased; his mind guided his movements, allowing him to use the most appropriate techniques. He could be considered to have reached a certain level of mastery in swordsmanship.</p><p>If he were willing to devote himself to research, he had the potential to create his own sword technique. In the past, he could only use Sword Qi Thunder Sound as a surprise attack, lacking variation. Now, he'd advanced further. His flying sword moved like a ghost, keeping his opponents constantly on the defensive.</p><p>But this wasn't what pleased Qin Sang the most.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel that he was getting closer and closer to Sword Light Divergence!</p><p>…</p><p>"Hahaha…"</p><p>A burst of unrestrained laughter suddenly echoed through the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang stood tall, at the entrance of the passage, his ebony sword floating before him.  As Qin Sang focused his mind, the ebony sword trembled slightly, splitting off a ray of sword light, but immediately afterward, another illusory sword shadow slowly emerged!</p><p>This faint sword shadow was the rudimentary form of Sword Light Divergence!</p><p>"As long as I don't compare myself to that freak, Senior Qingzhu, my talent isn't so bad! Even among those Core Formation stage sword cultivators, few have mastered Sword Light Divergence…"</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curled into a smile. He hadn't expected that after countless battles, a flash of inspiration in his mind led him to suddenly comprehend Sword Light Divergence.</p><p>However, he knew that while the swordsmen played a role in his significant improvement, the *Metaphysical Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter* was also inseparable from it.</p><p>Although it was only a rudimentary sword shadow, the most difficult part was the beginning. Qin Sang believed that it wouldn't be long before he could split off true sword light, allowing him to potentially fight above his level!</p><p>Legend says that top-tier sword cultivators could fight ten thousand alone. One sword out, ten thousand swords born!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have such lofty ambitions. As long as he became stronger, he was satisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the ebony sword, looking at the depths of the passage with confidence.  He could easily defeat his former self. In this passage, he could definitely go further.</p><p>This time, he didn't act hastily. He sat cross-legged, running his cultivation technique, focusing on healing and recovering his breath, adjusting his state to its peak.  His gaze darkened, and he entered the passage again.</p><p>Opponents that had previously seemed difficult were no longer much of a problem. Qin Sang smoothly arrived at the place he'd reached before, easily defeating the swordsmen.  He glanced at where he'd been defeated earlier, and strode forward.</p><p>But soon, Qin Sang encountered trouble. The swordsmen were also growing stronger.  Later on, every battle was a fierce fight.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was firm, fixed on the end of the passage.  He pressed forward step by step, using all his strength to fight the swordsmen.</p><p>Finally… he saw the sight at the end of the passage. There was no stone gate, no altar, but a stone staircase leading upward. The light was dim, revealing only four layers of exceptionally smooth, polished stone steps.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped resisting, was moved back to the entrance of the passage, and stared into the darkness, lost in thought. He was curious what the staircase connected to. Whatever was there, he had to go see it. Even if there wasn't a teleportation array, it was certainly related to the *Metaphysical Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>He glanced at the spot where Senior Qingzhu had left the jade slip.</p><p>“If the stone steps lead to the ancient teleportation array, has Senior Qingzhu already returned to Xiaohan Domain?” Qin Sang muttered to himself, unsure.</p><p>He didn't know much about Senior Qingzhu's life, so he could only guess.  Finding out about Senior Qingzhu's history through Linggui Island might help.</p><p>It was clearly impossible to force his way through right now.</p><p>Even with all his strength, Qin Sang had only made it halfway. He calculated silently: the final guardian swordsmen would likely be comparable to a peak late-stage Golden Core cultivator, possessing top-tier swordsmanship and extremely high combat prowess.</p><p>He would have to face two top experts at once.</p><p>This was a difficult situation for Qin Sang.  He understood the swordsmen's strength; even if he successfully broke through to the peak late-stage Golden Core, his chances of winning next time wouldn't be high.</p><p>Moreover, he still didn't know how to solve the problem with the ebony sword; his cultivation might stagnate at any moment.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something. He hurriedly took out a jade slip – the one left by Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>He looked at the *Cultivating the Yuan Devil Embryo*, a demonic cultivation technique, his expression thoughtful.</p><p>Why would Senior Qingzhu leave behind only this secret technique?  Could there be a deeper meaning?</p><p>The demonic seed of the external avatar is forged using a sword spirit, and the corridor's restriction doesn't seal the ebony sword. Could it be that because of the sword spirit, it allows the external avatar to enter?</p><p>With an external avatar at the peak late-stage Golden Core, his chances of success would be considerably higher.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang immediately made his decision.</p><p>Regardless of the odds, it was worth the gamble. Refining an external avatar wouldn't hurt him, and even if his guess was wrong, he would gain a powerful asset.</p><p>He stayed a little longer in the corridor, then bowed before leaving, as a thank you to the swordsmen for their guidance.</p><p>“A single path of swords, and it brings me such great opportunity, comprehending the division of sword light… ancient cultivators, Seven Killing Hall…”</p><p>Qin Sang walked out, gazing up at the stone wall, filled with awe.</p><p>Looking around, he wasn't sure where to go.</p><p>His gains this trip were significant. Although he hadn't found the teleportation array, discovering the clues left by Senior Qingzhu and this corridor potentially leading to it was exhilarating.</p><p>Qin Sang checked his jade token and discovered he had spent too long in the corridor comprehending the sword dao; it was almost time for him to leave.</p><p>With so little time left, finding anything significant in the Heavenly Tower would be essentially impossible.</p><p></p>
