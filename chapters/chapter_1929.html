<h1>Chapter 1920: The Altar Array</h1><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance of the stone cave, sensing the ancient aura emanating from within. Before him was an old altar.  The three-tiered altar was constructed from a special, meticulously refined stone, its surface engraved with intricate thunder patterns, exuding an ancient charm.  It wasn't as grand as the altars he'd seen at the Left and Right Thunder Palaces, but it was still roughly the size of a house.  Only the bottom layer of the three-tiered altar remained intact; the upper two were severely damaged, the third reduced to a few broken stones. Because of this, the altar was completely powerless.</p><p>On the altar were some incongruous stones, also engraved with dense runes, but these were noticeably crude and shallow. It seemed that the Lei Xiao Sect had attempted repairs, but without success.  Many of the runes' meanings were only clear to Qin Sang due to his study of the Five Thunder Envoy Seal. The Lei Xiao Sect's inherited knowledge was insufficient for them to comprehend the subtleties involved.</p><p>Qin Sang took two steps forward, gazing at the altar. His gaze slowly and carefully swept over each stone, each rune, before he closed his eyes in contemplation. This altar was different from those at the Left and Right Thunder Palaces. It might not belong to any sect he anticipated, or perhaps the Daoist Court had undergone so many changes that the altars themselves had evolved, defying conventional understanding.</p><p>However, one thing was certain: the cultivator who built this altar possessed cultivation comparable to his own!  Even with the knowledge from the Five Thunder Envoy Seal, Qin Sang found the runes on this altar difficult to decipher quickly, hindering his understanding of its function.  Even his true form couldn't instantly repair it.  He had overestimated the altar's origin, but underestimated it even more.</p><p>This discovery filled Qin Sang with both surprise and greater anticipation, as well as confusion:  "Such an altar hidden in the mortal world indicates the presence of a powerful Daoist cultivator here. Why hasn't the Yun Du Mountain cultivation world been affected by the Daoist Court?"</p><p>The Daoist Court's expansion often involved Daoists leaving the Court, selecting a geomantically auspicious location, building an altar to preach and accept disciples.  As their influence grew, forming the beginnings of a sect, they would begin refining a Sect Seal. Once the Sect Seal was complete, they would be upgraded to a formal sect, becoming a recognized core force within the Daoist Court. Before this stage, they were variously referred to as subordinate sects, affiliated sects, itinerant sects, or independent sects.  Subordinate and affiliated sects were mostly located around the established forces of the Daoist Court, developing under the protection of a formal sect.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's investigations, the area around Yun Du Mountain didn't seem to have any formal sects of the Daoist Court.  Itinerant sects, as the name suggests, operated independently. Daoists daring enough to establish itinerant sects were extremely powerful cultivators. After all, being far from the core forces of the Daoist Court meant they lacked timely support in case of danger.</p><p>There were three possibilities for this altar.</p><p>1. A Daoist cultivator established a cave dwelling here for cultivation.</p><p>2. A Daoist cultivator encountered a powerful enemy, used the altar for a magical battle, then abandoned it afterward.</p><p>3. This was an itinerant sect, with a Daoist leaving behind their lineage here.</p><p>Qin Sang believed the third possibility was the most likely, with the Lei Xiao Sect's inheritance serving as evidence. However, to understand the altar's true purpose, he first needed to decipher the runes and repair it.</p><p>Runes flashed through Qin Sang's mind, forming complex shapes, some unseen even in the Five Thunder Envoy Seal, but with the Five Thunder Palace's thunder techniques as reference, deciphering them wouldn't be too difficult, only time-consuming.</p><p>"An itinerant sect would be perfect," Qin Sang thought. If it was an itinerant sect, finding the altar might allow him to connect with the Divine Court, not only borrowing its power, but most importantly, re-establishing contact with the Daoist Court.</p><p>…</p><p>While Qin Sang examined the altar in the stone cave, the collapse of the secret realm intensified. Cultivators from various sects rushed into the secret realm, rescuing those who had entered earlier. The various sect leaders reached an agreement, instructing people to bring the young man out while keeping the Jade Pavilion surrounded.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Jade Pavilion shook violently, emitting chaotic rainbow light, with cracks appearing more and more frequently on its surface.  Everyone activated their secret techniques, studying the Jade Pavilion's restrictions, searching for a safe way to break them. Their gazes were filled with fervent desire.</p><p>A woman in palace attire licked her lips, giggling, "Sect Leader Ruan's suggestion is excellent. We'll share the inheritance together.  The commotion today will undoubtedly attract attention; many will covet the Lei Xiao inheritance. Only by forming a defensive alliance can we deter others' greed."</p><p>An elderly man beside her spoke softly, "We are all descendants of the Lei Xiao lineage, without any mortal feuds. Perhaps by studying the scriptures together, our relationships will improve, and we can restore the Lei Xiao glory."</p><p>The elder was a clan leader who hoped for the merger of the various sects, but others didn't share his vision.</p><p>Jin Du Mountain's sect leader chuckled, "We're allies, aren't we? Otherwise, why would there be a Lei Xiao Assembly?  Not good! The mountain's collapsing! Quickly take the Jade Pavilion to safety to avoid being affected!"</p><p>"Right!"</p><p>Everyone responded, exerting all their strength to lift the Jade Pavilion and fly it high into the air. Soon, they heard a deafening roar from below.</p><p>Dust and smoke billowed as the mountain peak crumbled, leaving the secret realm in ruins.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the mountain's collapse was a mere illusion. Qin Sang had used an array to stabilize the mountain and conceal it, deceiving everyone.</p><p>The experts from various sects remained oblivious, focusing on breaking the Jade Pavilion's restrictions.  Finally, they forced their way in, obtaining the Lei Xiao Sect's true teachings and various profound cultivation techniques and secret arts.  Everyone rejoiced.</p><p>Unfortunately, the secret realm was no longer what it once was. That mountain range had returned to the surface world, but it was utterly destroyed.</p><p>The various sects searched meticulously many times afterward, but found nothing, confirming there were no omissions. Gradually, fewer people came.</p><p>No one knew that another unknown peak stood silently there.</p><p>These are later events.</p><p>Qin Sang originally took Xiao Wu down the mountain to travel, but unforeseen circumstances led them back up, where they stayed for over a decade, coincidentally aligning with a natural, unhurried state of mind.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to comprehend the Dharma Altar, but he wasn't comfortable leaving Xiao Wu alone to go down the mountain, so he and Xiao Wu lived in a hut near the stone cave.</p><p>When Qin Sang wasn't around, Luo Hou and Zhu Que were somewhat afraid of Xiao Wu, even though Xiao Wu had changed since leaving the mountain.  Zhu Que was slightly better, somewhat timid, while Luo Hou kept a respectful distance, preferring to remain a quiet green horse.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a simple barrier at the foot of the mountain. Any small animals lingering nearby might be drawn in, hoping to provide Xiao Wu with some companions.</p><p>Fifteen years after the Lei Xiao Assembly.</p><p>This day.</p><p>Qin Sang came out of his hut and saw Xiao Wu sitting on a stone bench in the small courtyard, opposite a fox.</p><p>The fox was pure white, with smooth, glossy fur. It stuck out its tongue, constantly licking a cup.</p><p>The cup only contained water, yet the fox ate with gusto, its eyes narrowed to slits.</p><p>Xiao Wu, hands supporting her chin, watched the fox quietly. Sensing Qin Sang's return, she ran over.</p><p>The fox, startled, darted under the table, accidentally knocking over the cup.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The water spilled, releasing a faint medicinal fragrance.</p><p>The sound of the cup hitting the ground startled the fox again, and it bolted into the forest, disappearing without looking back.</p><p>Qin Sang had been collecting nearby herbs and casually refining some pills to feed Xiao Wu's beast companions. One had been added to this cup of water.</p><p>"That little fox is quite clever, knowing there are benefits here and coming frequently," Qin Sang said thoughtfully, watching the fox's retreating form. "This fox has a similar aura to that group of fox spirits; they must be related. Quite a coincidence."</p><p>That group of fox spirits had likely been subdued and taken from Ji State to Bei Kuo County, so it's normal for descendants to remain nearby.</p><p>Back then, Gao Ruoxu had captured that group of fox spirits. They would have been tried and imprisoned according to the law.</p><p>The laws of the underworld were relatively just, judging only by the crime, without bias towards whether the accused was human or spirit. This group of fox spirits had been coerced, only sucking yang energy from people without killing them, so their crime wasn't punishable by death.</p><p>I wonder if they've been released yet.</p><p>"Feeling bored?  The world below is much more vibrant. Don't worry, we'll be going down the mountain soon."</p><p>Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair. He'd just used his magic to sense his main body and informed it of the situation here.</p><p>Xiao Wu gently shook her head.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>In the Fire Domain, within the training grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body awoke from meditation, gazing south, murmuring, "The Dharma Altar…"</p><p>His figure flickered, disappearing into the fire chamber.</p><p>Inside, the Hui Ying sword and other treasures were being tempered by flames.</p><p>He sat cross-legged atop a copper pillar, pondering for a moment before extending a hand. The surrounding flames transformed into docile fire dragons, obediently circling above his palm.</p><p>Then, he retrieved various materials from his Qian Jun ring, his hand seals changing rapidly as he used fire to refine them, meticulously inscribing various runes to create a ten-foot-long stone slab.</p><p>The slab's shape mirrored that of the Dharma Altar, its surface covered with incredibly complex thunder patterns—the result of his incarnation's ten years of deduction.</p><p>His movements were swift, more and more stone slabs taking shape.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Gui Hou, who was training demon soldiers, twitched his ears and immediately flew to Qin Sang's cave. He heard a voice from inside, "Go down the mountain immediately and take these to Ji State."</p><p>A spiritual light burst from the opened cave, containing various stones and spiritual materials.</p><p>Repairing, not rebuilding, the altar was possible even with only his own transformed self, but lacking sufficient materials, he had to rely on his true form.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Gui Hou collected the items, bowed before the cave, and descended the mountain as a gust of妖风 (demon wind).</p><p>Though curious about the wider world, fear of Qin Sang's displeasure, and the understanding that Qin Sang wouldn't have allowed him to leave if escape were a concern, kept him from lingering.  He reached Ji State with utmost speed, delivered the items, exchanged a few words with Luo Hou, and quickly returned.</p><p>Qin Sang took the stones and entered the stone cave.</p><p>With a plan already in mind, he swiftly repaired the altar.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous sound echoed through the cave, emitting blinding lightning that illuminated half the mountain.</p><p>Small mountain creatures panicked; a fox, in particular, fled in terror, hiding trembling in the grass.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the now-repaired altar. He channeled his spiritual energy into it.</p><p>Unusual phenomena erupted.  Lightning, like dragons, danced around the altar, which seemed to be composed entirely of lightning, emanating a terrifying aura of thunder.</p><p>“Something’s wrong…”</p><p>After careful sensing, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, repairing the altar yielded no desired information.</p><p>“This is a subsidiary altar!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood.</p><p>Daoist altars have various uses. Multiple altars—master, minister, advisor, and attendant—can be arranged into an array, vastly increasing their power!</p><p>The arrangement of the main altar, subduing altar, capital altar, and subsidiary altars forms a powerful array.  The two True Monarchs’ summoning of the Thunder God and Gou Chen Emperor utilized the power of such arrays.</p><p>Altar arrays possess countless variations.  Different numbers and layouts create significant differences.</p><p>They are not only ranked in importance but may also have singular purposes or serve merely as auxiliary altars, with even slight differences resulting in vast discrepancies.</p><p>A single subsidiary altar naturally couldn't reveal the full picture.</p><p>“If even a subsidiary altar is this profound, how powerful must the cultivator who created this array be?”</p><p>This discovery greatly surprised Qin Sang; he might indeed gain unexpected benefits.</p><p>The condition was that other altars hadn't been destroyed; at least, ruins like this subsidiary altar remained.</p><p>Over endless ages, with the changes of time, anything could happen.</p><p>Qin Sang was not optimistic about this, otherwise, there wouldn’t be only one Lei Xiao Sect left.</p><p>He entered a meditative state, attempting to sense other subsidiary altars and the main altar through this one.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, no matter what he did, it was like a stone dropped into the ocean. The other altars were destroyed.</p><p>His foresight in having his true form deliver the materials saved him future trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected.</p><p>This left him to use this subsidiary altar as a reference point for his own deduction; at best, he could only determine a general location.</p><p>However, finding a second subsidiary altar would make the process progressively easier.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that repairing three subsidiary altars would allow him to discern the array's pattern and determine the main altar's location.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang entered meditation again and focused on his calculations.</p><p>This calculation took a full month.  Qin Sang narrowed the possibilities to three general areas, none of which could be definitively ruled out, requiring further investigation.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang left the stone cave, announcing his descent from the mountain.</p><p>"I'm finally going down to travel again! This mountain is so boring!"</p><p>Zhu Que was ecstatic, eager to leave.  She urged Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, "Hurry! Hurry!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu mounted their green horse and descended the mountain, using magic to relocate the mountain creatures away from Lei Xiao Sect before releasing them.</p><p>Most creatures, lacking high intelligence, scattered and fled.</p><p>Only the fox, hiding in the nearby grass, peeked out cautiously, unwilling to leave.</p><p>It looked at Xiao Wu on the horse, making soft whimpering sounds, seeming reluctant to leave yet afraid to approach.</p><p>The green horse walked slowly, stopping by the grass.</p><p>The fox quickly ducked its head back, then timidly poked its nose out again, its body trembling.</p><p>Xiao Wu was also looking at the fox.</p><p>The two stared at each other for a while. Then Xiao Wu slowly raised her head.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Xiao Wu dismounted and placed the remaining pills in front of the fox.</p><p>'Tap! Tap!'</p><p>The two and their horse rode towards the distant mountains as the sun set.</p><p>The fox in the grass carefully clutched the pills, its eyes half-closed, until the figures disappeared in the distance. Only then did it retreat quietly into the grass.</p><p>(Could not post last night; system or code error displayed.)</p>
