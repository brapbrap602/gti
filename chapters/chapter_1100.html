<h1>Chapter 192: Sword Spirit</h1><p>Chapter 192: Sword Spirit</p><p>“True Qi, physical body, and divine sense; cultivating all three simultaneously would undoubtedly bring immense benefits.  But the resources and effort required, along with the increased difficulty, would be far more than triple. Furthermore, with the Heavenly Tribulation looming like a sword, stagnation means death. Who dares to be distracted? Perhaps it was possible in the ancient cultivation world, but in that era, with the lack of secret techniques and depletion of resources, it was nearly impossible for anyone to succeed.  Therefore, most cultivators chose the easier path of spiritual cultivation, making spiritual roots the sole measure of a cultivator's talent.”</p><p>Qingzhu offered his insights.</p><p>“I was teleported to the Canglang Sea, only one step away from forming the Nascent Soul. Due to the splitting of my killing intent, my primordial spirit was severely damaged. It took me over a hundred years, using every method imaginable to heal, before I finally and barely formed my Nascent Soul.  It shows that any damage to Jing, Qi, or Shen (spirit, energy, and essence) will have an impact, and vice versa. The effectiveness of the Soul Cleansing Liquid stems from this very principle.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchids and the Soul Cleansing Liquid are external aids.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, once it reaches its third transformation peak, can also help break through bottlenecks.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, he had already gathered so many methods to aid in Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>If Qingzhu’s words are true, it seems I should place equal importance on the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* and *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation* techniques from now on.</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Once he cultivates *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* to the third-layer peak, with the help of stellar essence body refinement, perhaps he can directly break through to the fourth layer.</p><p>At that time, his physical body alone would be comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator, providing significantly greater assistance.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages caused Qin Sang immense hardship, making him fully aware of the difficulties of cultivating with five spiritual roots.</p><p>There’s only one Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid; unlike the Soul Cleansing Liquid, which has a lasting effect, it must be used only when absolutely certain of success.</p><p>After giving Qin Sang some pointers, Qingzhu returned to the main topic.</p><p>“Do you know that the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation* is hidden in the Ziwei Palace, a place similar to the Netherworld Valley? When the ancestors of Mount Shaohua obtained the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation*, they also discovered a fragment of a spirit sword. Only those who have cultivated this technique can gain the fragment's recognition.  Even Dongyang Bo couldn't wield this treasure, so the fragment ended up in my hands.”</p><p>“Senior means…?”</p><p>Qin Sang practically held his breath.</p><p>“Exactly!”</p><p>Qingzhu didn’t beat around the bush. “Barring unforeseen circumstances, another part of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation* should be hidden in the Netherworld Valley. Whether it’s a second volume, we’ll only know after obtaining it. Back then, I had already exhausted my efforts, finding it difficult to further deduce the technique. I was overjoyed upon discovering the Netherworld Valley.  Unfortunately, the valley contains extremely dangerous ancient restrictions; only Nascent Soul masters have the strength to break them…”</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the Sword Qi Hall outside the Netherworld Valley.</p><p>“To enter a mountain of treasure, yet return empty-handed.”</p><p>Qingzhu’s face was filled with regret. “To make matters worse, my self-severing of my primordial spirit and forcibly cultivating the technique led to the accumulation of killing intent, giving rise to a demonic soul. After my recent serious injury, the demonic soul finally seized its opportunity.  The sword qi in this hall triggered it, causing a demonic soul backlash, almost leading to my losing control. In the end, I was forced to use the spirit sword fragment to barely seal the demonic soul within this hall. I thought this place was uninhabited, but the ancient demon sealed beneath the mountain influenced the demonic soul, causing many problems, with the consequences lingering to this day…”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully protected Qingzhu while listening to his detailed account.</p><p>“After sealing the demonic soul, I barely escaped the Seven Killing Hall, only to find myself in an unfamiliar cultivation world. I traveled far and wide before settling on Spirit Turtle Island, rarely interacting with other factions, and closed myself off there, recuperating while attempting to form my Nascent Soul.”</p><p>“For over a hundred years, unable to enter the inner hall to retrieve the demonic soul, I tried various methods, including teaching and meditation.  By sheer luck, I forcefully broke through despite the damage to my primordial spirit, but this laid the groundwork for future trouble. I must retrieve the demonic soul, otherwise, my cultivation path will be incredibly difficult.”</p><p>“Decades later, the Seven Killing Hall reappeared. I intended to subdue the demonic soul, take the spirit sword fragment and the technique, then return to the Little Cold Domain for revenge and reunite with my loved ones.  However, fate had other plans.”</p><p>Qingzhu let out a long sigh.</p><p>Qin Sang knew they were reaching the crux of the matter.</p><p>Why did he appear on the Wu God Continent?</p><p>What else had Qingzhu gone through?</p><p>All would soon be revealed.</p><p>Qingzhu looked at Qin Sang, his eyes holding an inexplicable meaning.  “After the Seven Killing Hall reappeared, I first entered the trial realm left by the Four Saints, then successfully reached the Netherworld Valley, intending to subdue the demonic soul, only to find it missing! Unexpectedly, you were then teleported from the Ziwei Palace. All my plans have been disrupted by you and the sword spirit within you.”</p><p>"A sword spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then realized Qingzhu was likely referring to the grey energy within him.</p><p>"It's the sword spirit of a shattered spirit sword?  Wasn't it placed inside me by the senior after I arrived at the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  This was completely different from his guess.</p><p>Qingzhu was startled, shaking her head.  "Why would I invite trouble? The sword spirit within you, after arriving at the Seven Killing Hall, sensed the shattered spirit sword fragment and tried to draw the fragment back. This caused the fragment within the Demon Soul to act strangely. At that time, the Demon Soul had already been released by the Ancient Demon and occupied a new body.  Furthermore, his cultivation was far superior to my own, the original. Luckily, the seal on the spirit sword fragment hadn't been broken, and his memory hadn't returned. The sword spirit's attempt to draw the fragment within the Demon Soul led him to trace it, almost causing him to discover the restrictions of the Sword Qi Hall and the Netherworld Valley…"</p><p>Qingzhu gently pressed a section of the Sword Qi Hall wall, revealing a phantom door.</p><p>The two passed through the restriction and arrived at the Netherworld Valley.</p><p>Qingzhu glanced back, saying, "I originally intended to forcibly subdue the sword spirit, but it possessed exceptionally high intelligence and had already recovered some of its power. Upon discovering me, it hid within you, taking you into hiding. If the Demon Soul had found the Netherworld Valley and the ancient teleportation array, recovered his memories, and unleashed his killing intent, the situation would have been irrecoverable. In desperation, I had no choice but to use a Lesser Relocation Talisman to forcefully send you out of the Seven Killing Hall, isolating the sword spirit from the spirit sword fragment."</p><p>"After I awoke, I found myself on the Witch God Continent.  Did the senior send me away using a Lesser Relocation Talisman? The sword spirit was inside me, but why did it always appear as grey energy, never making a move for a hundred years?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he were hearing a fantastical tale after hearing Qingzhu's account. He had been severely injured and unconscious, his body occupied by a sword spirit, and so much had transpired.</p><p>"That's right. The Lesser Relocation Talisman was an ancient spirit talisman I accidentally discovered within the celestial restriction above. Its origins are extraordinary. Once activated, it can instantly teleport one elsewhere, escaping danger; it's a life-saving treasure. However, the direction and location of the teleportation cannot be controlled. Here, you would most likely be transported to the depths of the storm zone, with a slim chance of survival.  However, at the time, I saw your body surrounded by corpse energy and thought you were already dead."</p><p>Qingzhu speculated, "Now it seems the Lesser Relocation Talisman may have been influenced by the sword spirit, sending you to the relatively safe Witch God Continent.  The sword spirit must have paid a great price for this and fell into a deep sleep. Otherwise, when the Witch tribe first opened the Seven Killing Hall, with both me and the Demon Soul present, if the sword spirit had drawn the spirit sword fragment, you would have been discovered by the Demon Soul."</p>
