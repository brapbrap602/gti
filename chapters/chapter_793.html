<h1>Chapter 785: Guidance</h1><p>Chapter 785: Guidance</p><p>Among the numerous sword marks, this one was the most inconspicuous, yet the most special!</p><p>Seeing the sword mark, Qin Sang felt a sudden pang in his heart.</p><p>He stared intently at the mark, forcefully suppressing the turmoil within him.  Without changing his expression, he turned to glance at the cultivators still searching behind him.  Seeing that no one was paying attention to this spot, he pretended to continue searching while keeping his eyes fixed on the sword mark.</p><p>The stone wall was crisscrossed with countless sword marks. This was just one among them, and it showed no signs of being recently made.</p><p>This sword mark was unique, containing a special sword intent.  The moment Qin Sang saw it, a sense of familiarity welled up within him.  A killing talisman within his ebony sword trembled, as if sensing something.</p><p>To his astonishment,</p><p>this talisman wasn't one of the first five from the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, but the still-unformed sixth talisman, a creation of Elder Qingzhu!</p><p>Only someone who had cultivated this talisman would notice the difference.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with surprise.</p><p>Unless Elder Qingzhu had taken on a disciple, only the two of them in the Canglang Sea had cultivated this technique.</p><p>He had been unable to find any trace of Elder Qingzhu, fearing he had met with an accident. Now he knew that Elder Qingzhu was still alive and had left a mark here!</p><p>Was it left unintentionally, or was there some deeper meaning?</p><p>It was certain that if Elder Qingzhu were still alive, he wouldn't have given up on finding a way back.  Coming to the Seven Killing Hall and the Sky Tower was perfectly normal.</p><p>He still had old friends in the Xiao Han Domain, as well as enemies he sought revenge against.</p><p>But why Elder Qingzhu ultimately didn't return, whether he failed to find a teleportation array or encountered some incident, remained unknown.</p><p>This sword mark might hold the answer to his questions.</p><p>Qin Sang waited until the last person left.</p><p>After a long and fruitless search,</p><p>everyone believed the previous person's claim, thinking the treasures the High Priest had obtained were from inside the valley. They had given up hope and were unwilling to waste any more time there.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his search without revealing his intentions, but he didn't find a second similar sword mark.</p><p>Once he was sure everyone had left, Qin Sang returned to the wall, pondered for a moment, and then, wielding his ebony sword, gently sent a sword energy toward the mark.</p><p>This sword energy was very thin and drifted towards the sword mark.</p><p>Qin Sang had examined the mark for a long time but couldn't discern anything, unsure if it was unintentionally left by Elder Qingzhu or if it concealed some secret.</p><p>Remembering an incident in the Ziwei Palace, he decided to try a test by striking it with a sword.</p><p>The shape of the sword energy perfectly matched the sword mark. Upon striking the mark, it silently dissipated.</p><p>The sword mark remained unchanged.</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of black light rippled nearby, and dozens of black threads shot out, heading straight for Qin Sang at an incredible speed.</p><p>These threads were only a tiny fraction of the black light, but they startled Qin Sang. If he were struck by them, he doubted he would remain unscathed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, retreating dozens of meters. Seeing the threads finally retract, he relaxed.</p><p>No wonder the High Priest and the Demon Lord didn't dare fight near the threads. These threads could sense the fluctuations of true energy, and even cultivators outside weren't safe.</p><p>After the black threads retreated and the area stabilized, Qin Sang returned to his original spot, gazing at the unchanged sword mark and falling into deep thought.</p><p>He seemed to recall something, his eyes brightening.</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes slightly, his demeanor subtly changing.</p><p>At this moment, he immersed his mind in Qingzhu's self-created technique.</p><p>Although he had cultivated this technique, he hadn't followed Elder Qingzhu's path, and his state of mind remained unaffected by the technique; he had maintained his true self with the help of the jade Buddha.</p><p>Now, he actively immersed himself, harmonizing with the killing talisman, and sent out another sword energy.</p><p>While dodging the retreating threads, Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed on the sword mark. The moment the sword energy struck the mark, the mark indeed changed.</p><p>A faint light suddenly flashed within the mark, and a weak light ball emerged from within the stone wall.  It bounced gently and shot towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"It worked!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, reaching out to grab the light ball.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the light ball suddenly dissipated, and Qin Sang's expression changed, but he immediately received information.</p><p>To be precise, it was a guidance!</p><p>"It must be a nearby fragment!"</p><p>Qin Sang identified the guidance's content: Elder Qingzhu was directing him to a fragment on a certain peak.  There was nothing else.</p><p>"Did Elder Qingzhu leave this guidance specifically for me, or for his disciple?</p><p>"If it was specifically for me, then at least fifty years ago, when I fell from the Sky Tower, Elder Qingzhu was still alive."</p><p>They all came through the same teleportation array. Knowing about the celestial corpse, he must have figured something out and might be looking for me.</p><p>“Is he trying to tell me something?”</p><p>“The sword marks are impossible to date.  Senior Qingzhu not only cleverly disguised the marks and left clues here, but even the High Priest and the Demon Lord didn't find them. That's more than just a unique cultivation technique. What cultivation level was Senior Qingzhu at when he left these marks?</p><p>“If he had already achieved Nascent Soul, why was he so obscure?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, his heart filled with questions.</p><p>He cautiously looked around, then propelled himself from the ground, soaring out of the valley.  His gaze swept across the landscape as he sped away.</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang appeared on a fragment of rock.</p><p>He looked straight ahead, where there was a smaller fragment than the valley.</p><p>It was an extremely dangerous location, with a stone staircase winding its way up the mountain towards an ancient temple.</p><p>The temple was built against the cliff face, with a sheer drop behind it.  There was nothing else remarkable about the location.</p><p>The temple was unprotected by any formations, severely damaged, and dilapidated.  Most of the roof had collapsed, with only a few remaining tiles precariously clinging to the cliffside.</p><p>There were no plaques, dragon pillars, or any similar inscriptions.</p><p>At first glance, it was like any other fragment—without even ancient restrictions. Any treasures would have long since been looted. Yet, Senior Qingzhu's clues led here.</p><p>Qin Sang flickered, concealing himself in the shadows, and silently moved to the stone steps.  He felt nothing unusual and quickly approached the temple.</p><p>The temple was tall, its former grandeur evident from the remaining ruins.</p><p>Standing before the temple, he searched in vain for other sword marks. After a moment's thought, he fixed his gaze on the cliff face behind the temple.</p><p>The temple had clearly been completely destroyed; the last possible place to find anything would be this cliff.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu's guidance wouldn't be arbitrary.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>He quickly set up a prohibition spirit array around him. At the same time, the ebony sword shot out, slashing diagonally.</p><p>The sword energy silently dissolved upon contact with the stone wall, swallowed by it.</p><p>This familiar sight made Qin Sang's eyes widen. Without hesitation, he continued to control the ebony sword, sending wave after wave of sword energy into the stone wall.  A faint light flickered from within the stone!</p>
