<h1>Chapter 411: Taiyin Body Refinement</h1><p>During his time at the Ancient Battlefield, although Qin Sang spent years cultivating in the Heavenly Crystal Sanctuary, every time he returned to Skull Fortress, he meticulously prepared gifts for Qi Yuanshou, Yu Yangzi, and others.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou's decision was precisely what Qin Sang desired.</p><p>His cultivation method wasn't suited for constant secluded cultivation within a cave.</p><p>Unless one intended to betray their sect, they absolutely could not disobey the sect's assigned missions. Fortunately, Qi Yuanshou mediated, sparing him this difficulty.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately rose and bowed, expressing his sincere gratitude.</p><p>"It all depends on Senior Uncle Qi's decision!"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou nodded slightly, gesturing for Qin Sang to sit, and then asked, "Do you still intend to return to Skull Fortress for cultivation? The Spirit Tide's influence is growing, and the Ancient Battlefield is unstable. I can write a letter for you to give to your Senior Brother Rong, exempting you from future Shadow Guard duties."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang shook his head. "Reporting to Senior Uncle Qi, this disciple plans to cultivate in Boundless Valley for a while and won't return to Skull Fortress for now."</p><p>Indeed, in Sunny Market, Qin Sang had already decided not to return to Skull Fortress but to go to Boundless Valley for cultivation.</p><p>He had already secured a cave dwelling in Sunny Market, paying a hefty price. He could afford such extravagance thanks to the large sum of spirit stones Yu Hua had sent.</p><p>Moreover, after obtaining the Bloodwood Heartwood, he no longer needed to spend spirit stones on spirit wood, making his cultivation resources much more abundant.</p><p>There were two main reasons for staying in Sunny Market.</p><p>First, Sunny City was north of Sunny Market, not too far away, making it convenient to investigate and monitor the remnants of the Gloom Yin Sect.</p><p>Second, he was aiming for the Sunny True Flame of the Sunny Devil Sect.</p><p>Another location containing True Flame was in a Nascent Soul cave dwelling, something Qin Sang wouldn't even dare to consider.</p><p>The Sunny Devil Sect was different. As far as he knew, even Qi Refining disciples of the Sunny Devil Sect could cultivate Sunny Devilfire and come into contact with Sunny True Flame. There might be a loophole to exploit.</p><p>Sunny Market was just outside the Sunny Devil Sect's mountain gate, very close to the sect. Qin Sang planned to stay there and thoroughly investigate the Sunny Devil Sect.</p><p>All of this was in preparation for forming his Gold Core, planning ahead.</p><p>Boundless Valley teemed with countless demons and monsters. Training within the valley was similar to the Ancient Battlefield, and wouldn't significantly impact his cultivation.</p><p>"Boundless Valley?"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou frowned, his gaze stern. "The depths of the Severed Sky Mountains, the heart of the Devil Dao. How much confidence do you have?"</p><p>Qin Sang confidently replied, "Rest assured, Senior Uncle Qi. Disguised as a rogue cultivator, I have some methods to ensure my safety."</p><p>He had the Ten Yama Formation and magical treasures for protection, as well as valuable items like the Nine Dragon Chariot Talisman. Especially once Yu Hua was refined into a living corpse and the Ebony Wood Sword devoured the Bloodwood Heartwood, transforming into a magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang felt he wasn't far from being invincible among his peers.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou hummed, pondered for a moment, and tossed Qin Sang a token.</p><p>"This is a secret order for a branch of the sect's hidden guards in Sunny City. If you encounter life-threatening danger, you can seek help there.  You cultivate the 'Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit' chapter and your combat prowess far surpasses cultivators of the same realm. Remember to preserve yourself. I still need to handle the sect's affairs and don't want to be short-handed in the future."</p><p>Qi Yuanshou looked at Qin Sang intently.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang accepted the token with both hands.</p><p>Having this token was like having an extra life.</p><p>As for Qi Yuanshou's potential demands, Qin Sang wasn't worried at all. He was more concerned that Qi Yuanshou wouldn't use him!</p><p>He believed Qi Yuanshou wouldn't assign missions beyond his confidants' capabilities.</p><p>And since he was concealing his true strength, he could certainly complete them with ease.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou gave no further instructions. Qin Sang took his leave, bidding farewell to Qi Yuanshou, and flew away from the Sect Leader's Peak. Glancing back, he pondered for a moment, then flew towards Pagoda Peak.</p><p>Entering the area where Pagoda Peak's ancient texts were stored, Qin Sang began to patiently browse through them.</p><p>After a full day, Qin Sang emerged from Pagoda Peak, his expression shifting.</p><p>He had searched through the ancient texts, hoping to find clues similar to the Unsullied Secret Art.</p><p>Unfortunately, these ancient texts were severely fragmented, with many reduced to mere phrases, and there weren't many that truly dated back to ancient times.</p><p>Among these texts, he found only a few lines in a fragmented pieceâ€”in the ancient cultivation world, there was a path to ascension called Taiyin Body Refinement, the Corpse Liberation Path!</p><p>This was an esoteric art of the orthodox Dao, where cultivators dedicated their bodies to the Dao of Corpses, their true spirits remaining intact, with the hope of glimpsing the realm of immortals!</p><p>Sadly, the Taiyin Body Refinement art had long been lost.</p><p>Could the secret art created by Unsullied be similar to Taiyin Body Refinement?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know.</p><p>He gently shook his head, left Pagoda Peak, and returned to Dao Sect Peak. He met with Senior Brother Zhuang Yan and other acquaintances, and even saw Song Yi.</p><p>Song Yi, carrying Qin Sang's token, had joined Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Knowing that Song Yi was recommended by Qin Sang, Zhuang Yan kept Song Yi by his side, though other disciples handled the trivial matters, allowing Song Yi to focus on cultivation.</p><p>This was the benefit of having connections.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang went to Moon Inquiry Market.</p><p>He met with Shopkeeper Wu again, discussing the Dao of Refining, and before leaving, he bought spirit herbs from Skymark Tower to treat corpse transformation.</p><p>Returning to Returning Dragon Temple, Qin Sang activated the restrictions and sealed his cave for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Inside the cave,</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a stone bed, two objects placed before him.</p><p>One was the corpse embryo Yu Hua had prepared, and the other was the Bloodwood Heartwood.</p><p>He had been continuously experimenting, but unfortunately, he still had no confidence in refining Yu Hua.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang placed Yu Hua into the Corpse Puppet Pouch, planning to try again after refining a few more living corpses.</p><p>Capturing live False Core Realm cultivators was not easy, a rare opportunity, and it was related to the refining secret art created by Unsullied, so it had to succeed.</p><p>Qin Sang believed Unsullied wouldn't speak without reason, but he still needed to witness the transformation of a living corpse into a Skyfiend Yaksha and fully understand this secret art before completely trusting it.</p><p>Putting Yu Hua away, Qin Sang turned his gaze to the Bloodwood Heartwood and waved his hand to break the restrictions on it.</p><p>Bloodlight soared!</p><p>It began to spread towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, grasping the Bloodwood Heartwood in one hand and summoning the Ebony Wood Sword from his Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Sensing the aura of divine wood, the Ebony Wood Sword hummed cheerfully, seemingly eager to devour this spirit wood and enhance itself.</p><p>Qin Sang was fully prepared.</p><p>He gently tossed the Bloodwood Heartwood into the air, then activated the Ebony Wood Sword, sword Qi surging, enveloping the Bloodwood Heartwood.</p><p>Instantly, azure sword light and eerie bloodlight intertwined within the cave.</p><p>As expected of divine wood!</p><p>Other spirit woods, no matter how high their quality, couldn't resist the Ebony Wood Sword's devouring, but the Bloodwood Heartwood was actually able to withstand it, the two locked in a stalemate!</p><p>In the air, the bloodlight released by the Bloodwood Heartwood intensified to its peak, pushing back against the Ebony Wood Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword wouldn't be outdone, its humming growing louder, its sword light becoming increasingly brilliant.</p><p>Qin Sang observed this wondrous sight, his heart filled with admiration and anticipation for the future!</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes slightly, his divine sense connecting with the Ebony Wood Sword, beginning to assist it with all his might.</p><p>Time slowly passed, the two wondrous objects still locked in stalemate. With Qin Sang's help, the Ebony Wood Sword's momentum grew increasingly aggressive, while the Bloodwood Heartwood gradually weakened.</p>
