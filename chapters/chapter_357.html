<h1>Chapter 350 Dissolution of Power</h1><p>Windcross Market.</p><p>Tan Hao anxiously waited in a courtyard, but he was afraid of disrupting Qin Sang's plan and didn't dare to act rashly.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was pushed open.</p><p>Tan Hao abruptly stood up. Seeing Qin Sang walk in, his worried heart finally settled down.  He asked urgently, "Brother Qin, how did it go?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said, "Liang Yan has been eliminated by me. Let's go save Senior Sister Shi Hong."</p><p>He had already used the Soul Snatching Curse to learn the restrictions on Liang Yan's cave.</p><p>The two immediately went up the mountain and, upon entering the small courtyard, opened the restrictions on Shi Hong's room.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Shi Hong was startled awake. Sensing something was wrong, she hurriedly took out her magical tool for protection, but saw Tan Hao appear at the door.  Utterly surprised, an astonished expression appeared on her face.</p><p>"Junior Brother Tan, why are you here? Liang Yan, he…"</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Hong, Liang Yan is dead!"</p><p>Tan Hao directly dropped this shocking news.</p><p>Shi Hong's mouth opened slightly, her face full of disbelief.</p><p>Liang Yan had been alive and well just a moment ago.  He'd left for less than two hours, and then Tan Hao suddenly appeared, telling her this villain was dead. How could this be?</p><p>"Thanks to Brother Qin!"</p><p>Tan Hao stepped aside.</p><p>Qin Sang walked in, looking at Shi Hong with a sigh.</p><p>#Send 888 Cash Red Envelope# Follow vx.

Her brows held an unshakeable sorrow and fatigue.</p><p>Time, like flowing water, had eroded so much beauty.</p><p>"Senior Sister Shi Hong, long time no see…"</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Dark Mountains Pass.</p><p>Inside Tan Hao's cave.</p><p>Shi Hong sat cross-legged on the stone bed, still feeling that everything was unreal.</p><p>The demonic cultivator who had controlled her had been eliminated, and the greatest threat to her had been removed.</p><p>Her expression held a hint of relief, but it was far from joy.  It was exceptionally complex.</p><p>Gradually, her eyes began to redden, and two lines of tears slid down her cheeks, landing on the stone bed.</p><p>The tears flowed faster and faster.  Shi Hong suddenly covered her mouth, but she couldn't suppress the surge of emotion and burst into tears...</p><p>Now, Shi Hong's aura was even weaker than before, her cultivation only at the second level of Qi Refining!</p><p>After leaving Windcross Market and explaining the whole story to Shi Hong, Qin Sang also explained the details of the Yama Banner to her, asking for her opinion on whether she wanted to retain her current cultivation or dissolve her power and cultivate anew.</p><p>At the tenth level of cultivation, she would inevitably be devoured by the King of Hell. Only by dissolving her power and starting over could Shi Hong completely break free from the Yama Banner and cultivate to a higher realm.</p><p>But at Shi Hong's age, even with the best talent, there was almost no hope of Foundation Establishment in this life.</p><p>Even reaching the eighth level of Qi Refining again would be very difficult. In this process, Shi Hong would suffer much hardship and might not even reach her current level of cultivation before her lifespan ended.</p><p>Yun Youzi was an anomaly; not everyone could compare to him.</p><p>If she kept her cultivation, she would still be threatened by the Yama Banner, unable to improve and only able to stagnate. But if she returned home now, whether it was to enjoy a life of luxury or marry and have children, she could at least have a stable life for the rest of her days, far more prosperous than ordinary people.</p><p>Shi Hong made her decision almost without hesitation.  She resolutely said to Qin Sang, "I want to dissolve my power and cultivate anew! What can I do if I go back? Besides cultivation, I know nothing else.  Moreover, my parents and relatives have long since passed away, and I have no one… I'd rather die on the path of cultivation, with no regrets!"</p><p>Facing Shi Hong's resolute gaze, Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Shi Hong was the most talented of their four siblings. If she hadn't mistakenly entered the Demonic Sect, she might have reached the edge of the Core Formation realm by now, but due to a twist of fate, she had ended up like this.</p><p>With Shi Hong's insistence, Qin Sang acted as a protector and helped her dissolve her power, finally breaking free from the Yama Banner.</p><p>The moment the dissolution was complete, Qin Sang used all his strength to stabilize Shi Hong's collapsing spiritual sea, but he could only restore her to this level.</p><p>The second level of Qi Refining!</p><p>Only slightly stronger than a cultivator who had just stepped onto the immortal path.  Countless years of hard work had been destroyed.</p><p>"I'm about to travel south… Where does Senior Sister plan to cultivate? If Senior Sister wants to return near her hometown, I can escort you part of the way," Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Shi Hong came back to her senses, wiped away her tears, and hesitated.</p><p>Her current cultivation was too weak. In the dangerous Ancient Immortal Battlefield, she could die at any moment, while the heartland of the Small Cold Region would be much safer.</p><p>But only the Ancient Immortal Battlefield had abundant cultivation resources.  Staying here was her only hope.</p><p>Tan Hao, who was standing by the side, suddenly said, "If it weren't for Senior Sister's help, Tan Jie and I wouldn't have lasted until we met Brother Qin. If Senior Sister is willing, you can stay. This cave is sufficiently secluded; you can cultivate here without disturbance. Now Tan Jie no longer needs to consume spirit medicine, and I also have some ability to protect myself. As long as I'm here, Senior Sister doesn't need to worry about cultivation resources.  Give me a chance to repay your kindness."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  He had acted out of past affection to save them, but he couldn't keep them by his side forever, nor did he have the ability to.</p><p>It would be best if Tan Hao was willing to repay Shi Hong.</p><p>Shi Hong's realm was still low.  Even if she needed pills and other items, they wouldn't be very precious. With Tan Hao's current cultivation, he could fully support both his and Shi Hong's cultivation.</p><p>Persuaded by Tan Hao's sincerity, Shi Hong hesitated for a moment and finally agreed.</p><p>"In that case, I should also be on my way…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled lightly, his tone relaxed.  He could only do this much. As for the future of the Tan brothers and Shi Hong, it depended on their own fate.</p><p>He had already stayed at Dark Mountains Pass for over a month.  After returning to the sect, he might have to stay for a while to handle sect matters, so as not to miss his appointed time with Yun Youzi. He needed to set off as soon as possible.</p><p>Not mentioning the Tan brothers and Shi Hong's gratitude and attempts to persuade him to stay, the three walked out of the cave together. Qin Sang turned around and cupped his hands towards them, saying, "Senior Sister, Brother Tan, may our paths cross again!"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Nether Cloud, about to ascend, when he was suddenly stopped by Shi Hong.</p><p>He turned to look at her.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin…"</p><p>Shi Hong gazed at Qin Sang, her lips moved slightly, and she only uttered four words.</p><p>"May you ascend!"</p><p>Short but powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback. He nodded silently, turned, and stepped onto the Nether Cloud, soaring into the sky, merging into the sea of clouds, and breaking through the air.</p><p>Tan Hao and Shi Hong watched until the escaping light completely disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>Riding the Nether Cloud, speeding through the air, Qin Sang's expression was still somewhat absent-minded.</p><p>For cultivators, wishing a fellow Daoist ascension was perhaps the best blessing, right?</p><p>But, was immortality so easy to attain?</p><p>Qin Sang urged the Nether Cloud to fly to the top of the cloud layer, looked up at the boundless sky, and remained silent for a long time.</p><p>The Nether Cloud was extremely fast, and soon flew out of the sea of clouds. Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and, to avoid trouble, concealed his escaping light, flying discreetly.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang seemed to remember something and looked down at his storage pouch.</p>
