<h1>Chapter 1302:  A Killing Intent</h1><p>Qu Huan smiled calmly, saying, "I know you all have many questions. However, the most urgent matter now is to breach Yu City."</p><p>He pointed towards Yu City. "Now that the city's protective array has lost the Youjing Tower, they haven't had time to repair the damage.  It's the perfect opportunity to break through.  Once we breach the outer city, Zu Yuan will be forced to retreat to the inner city, and when our main forces arrive, we can surround them.  Zu Yuan has lost almost half their Yuan Ying stage cultivators. I'd like to see how long they can resist!"</p><p>"What did you say? Almost half their Yuan Ying cultivators fell to Ye Laomo's hands?"</p><p>Even the usually calm Zhen Daozhang was startled, his grip on his Qianyu whisk tightening as he exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two were even more shocked.</p><p>According to Qu Huan's previous report, Ye Laomo had openly rebelled in Yu City, slaughtering his allies.  Naturally, everyone would have attacked him.</p><p>Yet, under the watchful eyes of many, Ye Laomo had managed to kill so many and escape.</p><p>How terrifyingly powerful was Ye Laomo?  Even a true late-stage Yuan Ying cultivator couldn't achieve such a feat. Only a legendary Nascent Divinity stage cultivator could possibly do it.</p><p>A chill went down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>Had Ye Laomo been hiding his strength?</p><p>If Ye Laomo had unleashed such carnage at Blood Lake, Qin Sang doubted whether he and his senior sister could have escaped.</p><p>"That's correct, but there's more to it.  Most of the losses were among the newly promoted Yuan Ying cultivators of the last two hundred years.  Ye Laomo has played a very big game, and even more frightening is that we still don't know his true intentions!"</p><p>A look of intense astonishment crossed Qu Huan's face.</p><p>Following Qu Huan's guidance, everyone altered their strategy for breaching the array, finding a weak point and unleashing their most powerful treasures in a full-scale assault.</p><p>During the attack, Qu Huan revealed the full story.</p><p>"It all began with the Zui Shen Palace.  Back then, the Zu Yuan factions, while not openly hostile, were far from harmonious. Their alliance was due to a single incident. My cultivation was too low back then; I wasn't allowed into Zui Shen Palace and only learned about it later. I only know the general outline. To get the specifics, you'd have to ask those involved.  We all swore an oath in Xing Heng Sect, but now Ye Laomo has gone on a rampage. The foundation of that oath is gone, so I have nothing to worry about."</p><p>Qu Huan slowly revealed a secret.  "Back then, Ye Laomo and others discovered a demon in the Zui Shen Palace, an ancient demon supposedly imprisoned for ages, and still alive! This demon was extremely vicious, and they nearly released it, causing a great calamity.  In the end, both factions joined forces and paid a terrible price to kill the demon!"</p><p>A demon!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, sensing Qing Jun's gaze.</p><p>The two exchanged a look, understanding dawning on their faces.</p><p>This demon was likely another ancient demon, possibly connected to the Demon Lord of Qisha Hall.</p><p>No wonder there were ancient demon apparitions in the Zui Wei Palace's celestial array during the battle!</p><p>No wonder Qin Sang had sensed a similar aura to the Demon Lord from the Youjing Tower!</p><p>The Zui Shen Palace, imprisoning an ancient demon, had been attacked and its cultivators killed.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  It was clear that the remnants of this demon's power were far less than the Demon Lord's, otherwise, even the combined might of the Bei Chen cultivators wouldn't have been able to defeat it.</p><p>"What did they find on the demon?"</p><p>Qing Jun acutely sensed the key point.</p><p>Others also realized that the Zu Yuan factions had joined forces, set an ambush in Zui Wei Palace, and attacked Tian Xing Plateau—all after killing the demon—and it must be related!</p><p>Qu Huan looked at Qing Jun in surprise and nodded. "Many things!  While the demon was dying, they took advantage of its weakness to perform a soul-searching technique. The demon was caught off guard, and the technique was surprisingly successful. Although the demon quickly retaliated, they gained a significant amount of information. For instance…"</p><p>Qu Huan paused, his following words causing everyone's hearts to pound.</p><p>"The Youjing Tower, a type of pill called Ku Yuan Dan, secrets about Blood Lake, and...the passage between the Zui Shen Palace and Zui Wei Palace!"</p><p>The ambush in the Zui Wei Palace's celestial array nearly destroyed Xiao Han Yu and Tian Xing League, marking the beginning of the war in Bei Chen.</p><p>"So that's it."</p><p>Recalling the past, everyone’s expressions varied.</p><p>"Killing that demon, they tasted the sweetness of it. After performing soul-searching, they learned that another demon was imprisoned in Blood Lake, and they wanted to try the same trick again."</p><p>However, the demon's power left them deeply scarred, fearing that killing the demon would backfire. They waited until the demon was weakened recently before daring to enter Blood Lake. Unfortunately, they arrived too late, only finding a jade skeleton…"</p><p>Qu Huan sneered slightly, "However, it now seems there's more to this.  From the beginning of the Crime God Palace's hunt for the demon, it was likely all a scheme orchestrated by Elder Ye, and today is the culmination!"</p><p>Master Zhen's brow furrowed, "What do you mean by that? Also, is the Ku Yuan Dan a pill, or...?"</p><p>Others pricked up their ears.</p><p>Qu Huan had deliberately mentioned the Ku Yuan Dan earlier without explanation.</p><p>It sounded like a pill, comparable to the Youjing Tower, and mentioned in the ancient demon's memories – it must be incredibly important!</p><p>"The Ku Yuan Dan is the true reason behind the Crime Abyss's alliance between righteous and demonic cultivators, triggering this war."</p><p>Qu Huan produced a dull gray pill, displaying it before everyone, "This pill greatly increases the chance of breaking through cultivation bottlenecks. It can help Golden Core cultivators ascend to Nascent Soul, and is equally effective for Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"A breakthrough pill! No wonder the Crime Abyss has seen such a sudden surge in Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>"How much does it increase the chances?"</p><p>…</p><p>An uproar erupted.</p><p>Everyone's gaze locked onto the Ku Yuan Dan, intensely focused.</p><p>The Ku Yuan Dan was unremarkable, dull gray, lacking distinctive patterns or alluring fragrance.  It was hard to believe it possessed such incredible effects!</p><p>Qin Sang was also quite moved, intently observing the Ku Yuan Dan.</p><p>However, he hadn't lost his reason.  Qu Huan clearly had ulterior motives.  Holding the Ku Yuan Dan but not consuming it, and openly displaying it, certainly indicated some trickery.</p><p>The Ku Yuan Dan's refinement method came from the ancient demon's memories, and it's unlikely to be benign; it might conceal hidden dangers.</p><p>Qu Huan noticed the greed in everyone's eyes, unsurprised.  The Crime Abyss cultivators were driven by this very greed, readily plunging countless lives into this catastrophe.</p><p>Thinking this, Qu Huan silently mocked himself.  What right did he have to criticize others?  Upon learning of the Ku Yuan Dan's effects, hadn't he almost lost his head as well?</p><p>"According to the memories obtained by soul-searching the demon, the Ku Yuan Dan shows no obvious side effects.  With such potent effects, one can imagine the feelings of Tian Zheng and the others back then.  Overwhelmed with joy, they almost immediately decided to refine the Ku Yuan Dan. One of the materials required for its refinement is an elusive substance called 'the killing intent of men'."</p>
