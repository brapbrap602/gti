<h1>Chapter 570: The Master</h1><p>Chapter 570: The Master</p><p>Besides this, there were no other unusual aspects within the courtyard.</p><p>There were no traces of lingering spirit formations, no ubiquitous ancient prohibitions, not even a single shadow of an ancient beast. It was just like an ordinary courtyard, yet it inexplicably existed within the mystical Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were full of doubts, but seeing Chen Yan's cold demeanor, they dared not rashly ask, choosing to suppress their questions.</p><p>At this moment, a streak of light flew into the courtyard. Chen Yan caught it in her palm, examined it, her lips moved, then she flicked the light back.</p><p>After waiting for a quarter of an hour, a white rainbow arrived.</p><p>It was Dongyang Bo.  Fengming Shishu and Tieguanzi, and the others, were nowhere to be seen, likely already off on their own treasure hunts.</p><p>After Qin Sang and the others greeted him, Dongyang Bo gestured for them to retreat.</p><p>“Miss Chen Yan certainly cherishes her juniors.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo’s gaze followed Qin Sang and the others, a smile playing on his lips.  “Thanks to Miss Chen Yan’s unwavering protection, these five have made it in here unscathed.”</p><p>Chen Yan coldly snorted. “Senior mentioned before that entering the Heavenly Mountain and breaking through the formations required them to control the Five Element Beast Seals.  I naturally had to protect them with all my might.  What do you mean by this?”</p><p>Dongyang Bo waved his hands repeatedly.  “Miss Chen Yan, please don’t misunderstand. I was merely making casual conversation…  Right, the two regions’ Yuan Ying cultivators gathered for a meeting earlier.  Our fellow cultivators learned that Shaohua Mountain has a new Yuan Ying expert, and they all wish to meet you. I’ve already deflected them for you. However, this is not a long-term solution; we can't delay it indefinitely.”</p><p>Chen Yan pondered. “Let’s address that after we leave the Purple Micro Palace.  The Zuyuan’s surprise attack, will that affect our entry into Heavenly Mountain?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo shook his head with absolute certainty. “This is an opportunity that comes only once every few hundred years. We’ve already entered, how can we leave without trying? After we leave the Purple Micro Palace, the two regions will certainly set aside their differences and join forces against the enemy. As for the specifics, we can discuss them later.  However…”</p><p>Dongyang Bo’s tone suddenly changed, and he said with a smile, “The Zuyuan’s surprise attack may be a good thing for you and me. That old geezer self-detonated his life-saving treasure; the other Tianxing League cultivators are either dead or injured, they probably won’t be in the mood for a fight, we don’t need to worry about them. With most of our enemies gone, our chances have increased significantly.  At that point, it will all depend on you.”</p><p>Chen Yan said solemnly, “As long as you keep your promise and help me rescue my Master, I will abide by our agreement. I’ve already sworn an oath; you needn’t worry.”</p><p>“I believe you are a woman of your word!”</p><p>Dongyang Bo clapped his hands and laughed, glancing up at the boundless clouds. “We’ve wasted so much time. We still need to pass through several checkpoints in the outer hall before reaching the inner hall. Although we are working together, we are also bringing these five with us, so we must be careful. If anything unexpected happens, there won't be any Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Purple Micro Palace to replace them.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood at the edge of the courtyard, not daring to eavesdrop on their masters’ conversation.</p><p>After waiting for a while, they saw Dongyang Bo beckoning them, and quickly approached.</p><p>“To save time, Miss Chen Yan and I will take you directly to the inner hall. If you encounter any danger along the way, you only need to use the Five Element Beast Seals to protect yourselves and follow our commands…”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others readily agreed, carefully remembering Dongyang Bo’s instructions, and set off.</p><p>Dongyang Bo led the way, Qin Sang and the five maintained their formation in the middle, and Chen Yan brought up the rear.</p><p>The seven of them flew into the air, heading straight towards the depths of the Purple Micro Palace.  To accommodate Qin Sang and the five, their speed was not fast.</p><p>Clouds covered above, and chaotic spiritual energy currents filled the air.  They flew only slightly higher than the ancient trees, their vision finally becoming clear.</p><p>Looking far into the distance, there were hundreds or even thousands of similar palaces and courtyards, arranged neatly, scattered like stars.</p><p>Most of them were collapsed and dilapidated, abandoned just like the one they entered.</p><p>But some palaces were intact, even shining with the light of ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Within their field of vision, colorful pillars of light soared into the sky, clearly indicating extraordinary locations within.</p><p>And surrounding these groups of palaces, were encircling mountains, completely blocking their sight, obscuring what lay beyond.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang also noticed something unusual.</p><p>So many people had come in.</p><p>Few dared to fly in the air; Qin Sang only saw a few scattered figures.</p><p>He silently looked at the protective shield beside him; the external turbulent currents impacting the shield were easily repelled.</p><p>It seemed these currents were far more dangerous than they appeared.</p><p>Dongyang Bo’s destination was clear: the highest peak deep within the group of palaces.</p><p>This mountain was different from the others; it was barren, devoid of vegetation, covered in rubble, and seemed to be made entirely of piled stones, with sheer cliffs everywhere, like knife cuts, straight up and down.</p><p>On the jumbled rocks, a cluster of dark shapes huddled.  From a distance, their features were indistinct.</p><p>These shapes seemed to be living creatures, and Qin Sang couldn't help but glance at them again.</p><p>Layers of chaotic rocks resembled the steps of a pyramid. Near the summit, a simple stone hall, built of large stones, was strikingly visible.</p><p>This stone hall was the only sign of human presence among all the surrounding peaks; the other mountains were only covered in lush ancient trees.</p><p>“Should we enter the hall?”</p><p>Qin Sang silently wondered, then withdrew his gaze and looked down.</p><p>On the way, he noticed many figures flitting between the halls.  Though they didn't dare to fly, their speed was considerable. Some dashed towards the intact palaces, but most, like him, aimed for the stone hall on the stone mountain!</p><p>The path was clear, and he finally reached the foot of the stone mountain.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang finally saw clearly: the dark shapes were vulture-like demonic beasts.</p><p>These beasts didn't seem particularly strong, but there were far too many!</p><p>From the foot to the summit, every boulder held one, probably tens of thousands.  The dense mass of dark shapes sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the blood-winged wasp nest he'd seen in the Endless Valley.</p><p>This mountain was essentially a demonic beast nest, and these vulture-like beasts were far more formidable than the blood-winged wasps.</p><p>Because of the earlier delay, they weren't the first to arrive.</p><p>People were already climbing.</p><p>They each employed their methods, most using various techniques to conceal their presence and mask their auras, deceiving the beasts' senses.</p><p>One Golden Core cultivator, holding a black gourd, unleashed black smoke with a foul stench.  The beasts, smelling this, treated him as one of their own.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang secretly speculated about what Lord Dongyang would do, a shout of "Climb!" rang out.</p><p>Immediately, Lord Dongyang casually swung his sword.</p><p>The sword energy, like a rainbow, sliced through the beasts in its path, clearing a way forward!</p>
