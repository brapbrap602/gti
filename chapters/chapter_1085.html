<h1>Chapter 1777: A Desperate Gamble</h1><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang, despite dodging with all his might, was still struck by the radiant light.  He was sent flying like a rag doll, his back wracked with searing pain. Blood poured from gaping wounds, the smell of burning flesh filling the air.  Gritting his teeth, he sprang up before hitting the ground and fled again.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had been hunted by a Yuan Ying-level expert.  Just like when he faced Mo Qingzhu, he was completely outmatched.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>As Qin Sang leaped up, a streak of light shot down, blasting a deep crater in the ground.  The Nine Phoenix King watched Qin Sang's desperate struggle with a cold gaze, leisurely pursuing him, inching him closer to the edge of the Zhen Ling Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't let her succeed.  Once outside the Zhen Ling Domain, he would face a siege by numerous demon kings, each capable of toying with him effortlessly. That was true despair.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, searching for a solution. Bai was also trying to find a way out, but lacking the protection of the gray energy, he couldn't act independently.  He'd used up the Star Conch, and had no stronger means at his disposal.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the Spirit Orb's followers were nowhere to be seen.  Such a commotion hadn't alerted them, suggesting they were likely on the other side of the Yitian Peak.  Old Man Mou had deliberately chosen a route that avoided them, unknowingly falling into even greater danger.  Diverting attention was also impossible now.</p><p>It seemed his only chance was to buy time, hoping the Nine Phoenix King's feathered weapon had limited power and couldn't be used indefinitely.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A boulder shattered. Qin Sang sidestepped, narrowly avoiding another attack. The Nine Phoenix King's assault was incredibly fierce. Feeling the terrifying power, Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Then, as he dashed through a forest, he caught a glimpse of a shimmering reflection deep within the woods. To his surprise, it was a lake.</p><p>"A poison pool!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered Ning Wuhu's mention of the origin of the Ghost Valley's poisonous land – the poison pools within.  These pools contained highly toxic water, feared even by Yuan Ying masters, the very source of the poison.  The inner hall was desolate.  This was the first lake he’d seen since entering; it had to be a poison pool!</p><p>"A chance!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>But then he hesitated. The Ghost Valley's poison was comparable to that of the core area of the Purple Mist Desolate Land. If the airborne toxins were this potent, how much more fierce would the source be? Could Fei Can endure it?</p><p>But he was almost at his wit's end. With no other option, Qin Sang steeled his resolve and changed course, heading straight for the poison pool. He swallowed all the snow frog pills Ning Wuhu had given him, activated his few anti-poison artifacts, and ordered Fei Can to strengthen its anti-poison armor.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's move, the Nine Phoenix King raised an eyebrow.  He was too close to the poison pool; it was too late to use the Celestial Phoenix Feather to intercept him.</p><p>With countless layers of protection, Qin Sang reached the edge of the poison pool, closed his eyes, and leaped in.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The moment he entered, an anti-poison jade pendant shattered.  Qin Sang felt a chill, hastily gathering his anti-poison barriers, merging them with Fei Can's armor to withstand the toxic water, and quickly sinking.</p><p>Within the poison pool, his spiritual sense couldn't leave his body.  According to Ning Wuhu, the poison pools were interconnected, with a complex network of waterways. As long as he could escape the Nine Phoenix King's sight, he'd have a chance to escape.</p><p>He descended, constantly monitoring Fei Can's condition.  One by one, his anti-poison artifacts exploded. Fei Can emerged from Qin Sang's inner armor, perched on his shoulder, its body tense and arched, constantly spewing colorful auras to strengthen its armor. Its breathing was rapid, clearly straining.</p><p>Thankfully, Fei Can seemed to be holding on. Qin Sang’s tense heart eased slightly.</p><p>Above the poison pool, the Nine Phoenix King swooped down, her gaze fixed on the depths. She didn't know the poison pool's origins, but instinctively sensed danger, knowing it was connected to the Ghost Valley's poison. However, she wasn’t skilled in anti-poison techniques; she'd previously relied on the protection of the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>Even Yuan Ying cultivators wouldn't dare stay in this poisonous pool for long.  How long could a mere Golden Core cultivator possibly endure?</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng snorted coldly, a flame coalescing into a protective shield as she followed Qin Sang into the poisonous pool.</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>Upon entering, the toxic water boiled, and the shield immediately began to burn fiercely.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng frowned. The poison in the pool was even more potent than she'd anticipated. She had to catch that person quickly!</p><p>The pool was deep.</p><p>Qin Sang was frantic.  He didn't know how much longer the fat silkworm could hold on, and this crazy woman was still relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang finally saw the bottom of the pool—a massive underground river, stretching into a dark, unknown expanse ahead.</p><p>He entered the river, and Queen Jiu Feng followed without hesitation.</p><p>Soon after entering, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang was checking on the fat silkworm, about to retrieve various restorative items to help it recover, when he felt a sudden tightening, and was swept into a powerful undercurrent, uncontrollably pulled towards the river's depths.</p><p>Trying to use his cultivation to stabilize himself and escape the current, he discovered it wasn't a natural undercurrent at all, but a strange, immense suction force.  </p><p>Even with his cultivation, he couldn't break free!</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly cursed.</p><p>The pool had been perfectly calm. Why this sudden, bizarre suction?</p><p>He struggled wildly, but to no avail.  The force was overwhelming, like an unbreakable shackle dragging him away.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng, behind Qin Sang, also fell into the undercurrent created by the suction.</p><p>Initially unconcerned, her expression changed when she realized she too couldn't escape.</p><p>The river's destination and depth were unknown.  This strange suction was terrifying.  Moreover, trapped in the current, if she couldn't withstand the poison, she would dissolve into nothing, accompanying Qin Sang in death.</p><p>She'd wanted to capture Qin Sang and seize his treasures, but not at the cost of her own life.</p><p>Queen Jiu Feng made a swift decision, and unleashed the full power of her Celestial Phoenix Feather.</p><p>With a burst of power from the feather, she finally broke free of the suction.  Without pausing, she swam upstream, out of the pool. She found that the pool's water had mysteriously disappeared—nearly half gone, and still receding rapidly.</p><p>By the time she reached the shore, the pool was completely dry!</p><p>This bizarre sight baffled Queen Jiu Feng. She wondered if it was a natural phenomenon.</p><p>She glanced at the bottom of the dry pool, her brows furrowed. The boy had been swept away—almost certainly dead.  She'd expended the power of her Celestial Phoenix Feather for nothing.</p><p>The suction intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang, lacking a treasure like the Celestial Phoenix Feather, struggled desperately with Bai, completely helpless, being carried by the current through various channels towards an unknown location.</p><p>He repeatedly collided with rocks and walls, but his robust physique held up.</p><p>The problem was…</p><p>The fat silkworm's emission of colorful light began to slow, unable to maintain the protective anti-poison armor any longer!</p>
