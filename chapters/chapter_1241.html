<h1>Chapter 1233: Purgatory</h1><p>Holding the jade token in his hand, Gongliang Yu seemed to gain some confidence, his expression slightly easing. With one hand gripping the small figure and the other clutching the jade token, Gongliang Yu leaped into the blood lake.</p><p>...</p><p>The moment Qin Sang made contact with the blood water, he felt a sinister and malevolent force invade his entire body, seeping into every pore. The eerie chill penetrated his mind and seeped into the very marrow of his bones. Qin Sang, who rarely shivered, couldn't help but tremble, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>He recalled the time when he had used the Nine Nether Demon Flame to resist the poisonous mist during his bet with the Qianji Demon King. Thinking to employ the same tactic, he summoned the demonic flame to form a fiery armor around his body. However, the chilling force was strangely potent, able to pierce through the demonic flame. Qin Sang then transformed the fiery armor into the Ancestral Sacred Flame, but even that failed to block the cold. It wasn't until he retracted the spiritual flame and activated his true essence to form a protective barrier that he felt some relief. Fortunately, the consumption of his true essence wasn't too rapid, and as a Nascent Soul cultivator, it didn't affect him much.</p><p>The world around him was a sea of crimson. The blood water flowed around him, its gurgling sound echoing endlessly, as if leading to some unknown destination. Qin Sang could sense that the malevolent force originated from a strange power within the blood water, dragging him toward an unknown place. He glanced around and then felt his body suddenly lighten as he broke free from the blood water's grip.</p><p>Beneath the blood water was an unknown space shrouded in a dense blood mist. Qin Sang cautiously descended, observing his surroundings, and soon his feet touched solid ground. The malevolent force still lingered, permeating the entire space through the blood mist. Qin Sang dared not dispel his spiritual armor. Instead, he flicked his sleeve, releasing three demonic banners that circled around him as a protective measure. At the same time, he summoned the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, as the master of the Shaohua Sect, must have studied the "Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture." Qin Sang's cultivation of this technique was known to Dongyang Bo. If Qin Sang were to use the Ebony Sword and sword formations in front of Dongyang Bo, even if Dongyang Bo hadn't seen the second part of the technique, he would surely recognize it and deduce Qin Sang's identity. Therefore, Qin Sang decided to use sword techniques sparingly, relying primarily on the demonic banners and demonic flames, and avoiding the use of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation unless absolutely necessary. The eighteen demonic banners were more than enough to handle any crisis.</p><p>As Qin Sang summoned his treasures, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly also awoke. It still preferred to perch on Qin Sang's shoulder, its soft wings brushing against his cheek, staying close to its master. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had the ability to protect itself, so Qin Sang wasn't worried about its safety even when it ventured outside. He allowed it to do as it pleased.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly remained vigilant, its vision piercing through the blood mist, allowing it to see further than Qin Sang could. After some probing, Qin Sang confirmed that the blood mist only slightly obstructed vision and had no effect on spiritual sense. As long as one could resist the malevolent force, it wasn't a major concern. However, based on the information they had gathered, the interior of the blood lake was akin to a purgatory. It was unwise to extend one's spiritual sense too far, lest they accidentally trigger some mechanism and invite danger.</p><p>The records were vague, and Qin Sang had no idea what lay within. But caution was always the best policy, so he kept his spiritual sense confined within a three-zhang radius. With the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, the lack of spiritual sense wasn't a significant hindrance.</p><p>Activating the Heavenly Eye ability, Qin Sang finally saw the surrounding scenery clearly and understood why this place was called a purgatory.</p><p>He stood on a barren rock, not far from a mountain. The mountain was also made of stone, devoid of any soil or vegetation. The entire mountain was blood-red, either dyed by the omnipresent blood mist or naturally so. The scene on the mountain was horrifying.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder roared, accompanied by an unceasing, bone-chilling wind. The lightning was also blood-red. Above the mountain, blood-colored thunderbolts, like countless crimson serpents, struck down in the thousands, tens of thousands, without pause, as if intent on obliterating everything around the mountain.</p><p>The thunder was deafening, shaking one's very soul. This blood lightning was clearly not benevolent, and Qin Sang had no desire to experience its power. Despite being bombarded by blood lightning day and night, the mountain remained unscathed, either due to its unique material or some powerful restriction. Each blood lightning strike that hit the mountain blossomed into a crimson thunder flower, scattering blood-colored light in all directions, yet failing to harm the mountain in the slightest.</p><p>The chilling wind was no ordinary breeze. It continuously swirled around the mountain, and when it clashed with the blood lightning, it sometimes even dispersed the thunderbolts, showcasing its formidable power. While the mountain endured, no human body could withstand such torment indefinitely.</p><p>Recalling his earlier speculations about the Abyssal Ruins, Qin Sang thought that if someone were imprisoned here, subjected to the relentless strikes of blood lightning and the bone-eroding wind, the suffering would be no less than that of the Sawblade Hell. Even the most heinous criminals would find such punishment sufficient.</p><p>And this Wind and Thunder Mountain was, according to the records, just one of many ordinary features within the blood lake. It was no wonder that those who had entered before regarded the blood lake with fear, deeming it a purgatory.</p><p>At that moment, the Mixed Origin Unity Ring on Qin Sang's wrist flashed, and Fat Chicken emerged.</p><p>"Any sensations?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Fat Chicken didn't respond immediately. Instead, it opened its mouth and spat out a treasure pearl, exhaling several breaths of vital energy. The pearl slowly rose, hovering three inches above Fat Chicken's head, glowing rhythmically as if breathing. The light it emitted helped Fat Chicken resist the malevolent force.</p><p>After a moment, Fat Chicken's eyes showed a hint of disappointment. "If my mother were nearby, we could use the Thunder Thought Pearl to sense each other's location through our bloodline connection... but the Thunder Thought Pearl isn't reacting."</p><p>After clarifying the range, Qin Sang comforted, "Don't worry. The interior of the blood lake is vast, and even the outer regions will take us some time to explore. Don't underestimate the outer areas—there are many places like this Wind and Thunder Mountain. Even with your mother's strength, it wouldn't be unusual for her to get trapped if she accidentally stumbled into one."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured toward the mountain ahead, speaking calmly. He had approached the mountain but dared not get too close. The chilling wind and blood lightning enveloped the space around the mountain, and their residual energy spilled out, affecting anyone who passed by. Qin Sang suspected that if he were to rashly enter, he would face more than just the wind and lightning. The restrictions on the mountain were hidden and unpredictable, making the situation even more perilous.</p><p>Looking at the mountain, Qin Sang felt a sense of dread. His rational mind told him it was best to stay far away.</p><p>Fat Chicken, upon hearing this, was both relieved and concerned. "I just hope we don't delay your important matters, Master."</p><p>"I am but a lone force, not trusted by many. Arriving a bit late isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, before that, we need to locate the places marked on the fragment map to determine our position," Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>He had no intention of being the first to confront Old Demon Ye. Instead, he planned to act according to the situation. Moreover, he wanted to circle the blood lake to see if the Slaughter Sword's spirit would react.</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang took out a piece of animal hide with rough lines drawn on it—a fragment map copied by the Netherworld Demon Lord, left by a predecessor who had once entered the blood lake. It was unclear whether the map had changed over the years. Unfortunately, the Wind and Thunder Mountain before him wasn't marked on the map.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Fat Chicken to follow him and was about to bypass the Wind and Thunder Mountain when, without warning, dozens of blood lightning bolts suddenly changed direction and struck toward them!</p>
