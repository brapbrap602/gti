<h1>Chapter 1674: Nine Steps to the Apex</h1><p>Within the illusory realm of the palace lanterns.</p><p>When True Person Zilei learned the truth from Old Devil Fan.</p><p>In a short span of time, more than half of the divine statue had been dyed black. The black and blood-red were clearly demarcated, yet they were also eerily merging. The Demon Child's power seeped through the passage, increasingly infusing Zhu Wudao's body.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's power continuously climbed.</p><p>They desperately tried to communicate with the Artifact Spirit.</p><p>However, during this period, the Artifact Spirit seemed to be entirely focused on purging the defilement infecting its main body, completely ignoring the Demon Child's clamor and True Person Zilei's calls.</p><p>The Artifact Spirit had no intention of stabilizing the seal.</p><p>At this moment, the seal was beset by troubles both inside and out.</p><p>The Demon Child unleashed his demonic might, his frantic assault proving highly effective. The seal's tremors grew increasingly violent, and the resulting phenomena in the outside world became even more terrifying.</p><p>‘Crack, crack, crack…’</p><p>The sound of shattering, like a raging storm, echoed throughout Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, enormous “pythons” crawled all over the barrier, cracks as dense as a spiderweb. Such weakened points could no longer hold.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The first point of collapse finally appeared, forming a massive void near the summit, unleashing endless baleful winds.</p><p>Those outside could clearly see the baleful winds forming a black tornado, soaring towards the heavens, until it crashed into the Sword Formation above, colliding with the flying swords.</p><p>Immediately following, more and more such tornadoes appeared, covering Emperor Bestowal Mountain in mere breaths!</p><p>Seeing such a terrifying sight, everyone felt as if Emperor Bestowal Mountain was about to topple, their hearts trembling with fear. What kind of great battle was happening on the mountain to seemingly tear it apart?</p><p>At the edge of the Earthly Forms Hall.</p><p>A stone stele suddenly fractured, its upper half flying a great distance before turning to rubble mid-air. The stele was a formation artifact, a crucial node in the Earthly Forms Hall's protective formation, now shattered from within.</p><p>Sect Master Yue Lingtian of the Grand Peak Sect emerged from behind the broken stele.</p><p>It was unknown what he encountered within the Earthly Forms Hall. He looked travel-worn, his Daoist robe torn in many places, and a long, narrow wound, resembling a knife cut, marked his left wrist.</p><p>Yue Lingtian didn't rush to treat his wound, his gaze captivated by Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>According to his plan, he would ascend Emperor Bestowal Mountain after obtaining the Earthly Forms Hall's inheritance. By then, the situation would be clear, allowing him to act calmly based on the circumstances.</p><p>Now, something unknown had happened on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Go, or not go?</p><p>Yue Lingtian pondered. A flash of spiritual light coursed through his body, restoring his robe. Ultimately, he decided to summon his flying light and soar towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and the others within the mountain felt it even more acutely.</p><p>The omnipresent cracking sounds were unsettling.</p><p>There was a change, both good and bad. As the barrier shattered, the baleful winds found a channel for release, and the fluctuations caused by the shattering suppressed the wind formation, greatly diminishing its power. The baleful winds on the mountain gradually thinned, and visibility was returning.</p><p>As the upheaval unfolded.</p><p>The chase within the medicinal garden continued, unaffected by the external environment.</p><p>True Person Hegao, transformed into a spiritual crane, moved with agile grace. As he traversed the garden, he continuously analyzed the formations within, intending to use them to shake off Su Mo and the other.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two joined forces again, their combined strength too formidable. All the obstacles True Person Hegao created failed to achieve their intended effect, forcefully overcome.</p><p>Su Mo and the other pursued relentlessly, only able to maintain a tenuous grasp on True Person Hegao's aura, ensuring they didn't lose him.</p><p>True Person Hegao's mastery of formations left them in awe. To achieve such proficiency in such a short time…  Several times, the two tried to intercept him, but were seen through.</p><p>This chase left the medicinal garden in ruins.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A stone forest behind them collapsed.</p><p>Hearing the cracking sound, True Person Hegao knew he still hadn't shaken them off. He snorted coldly, his crane shadow flapping its wings, abruptly rising several zhang. With a resounding crane cry, his speed surged!</p><p>At this moment, before True Person Hegao lay an area shrouded in spiritual mist.</p><p>Su Mo and the other, upon seeing it, their eyes brightened.</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Old Devil Fan's furious roar echoed from within the mountain's belly.</p><p>At this very moment, True Person Zilei, instead of focusing on thwarting Zhu Wudao's scheme and preventing the Ancient Devil's release, suddenly withdrew from the battlefield, flashing towards the summit.</p><p>Leaving him to fight Zhu Wudao alone!</p><p>Only with True Person Zilei present had Old Devil Fan decided to gamble. If it were just him, seeing the situation as hopeless, he would never risk his life fighting the Ancient Devil here.</p><p>“The Demonic Calamity rises again, and the Nascent Soul cultivators are nowhere to be seen. Can you truly remain untouched?”</p><p>True Person Zilei's tone was calm.</p><p>As the Sect Master of a righteous Immortal Sect, True Person Zilei's mental fortitude was truly remarkable. Faced with imminent danger, he remained as composed as ever.</p><p>Yet, this tone made Old Devil Fan grind his teeth, almost exploding in curses.</p><p>Curse as he might, he couldn't refute it.</p><p>Back then, the Formless Immortal Sect didn't adhere to any single path, encompassing Dao, Buddha, Demon, and Deviant, with no shortage of cultivators practicing demonic arts. But when the Demonic Calamity arrived, all were treated equally.</p><p>Never had the Ancient Devils shown any leniency towards demonic cultivators.</p><p>Once the Ancient Devils corrupted a realm, escaping to the ends of the earth would be futile.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, calm yourself. This poor Daoist has a plan to subdue the demons. I'll be back shortly.”</p><p>True Person Zilei had made his decision, leaving behind these words, he flew to the summit.</p><p>In an instant, a brilliant violet light erupted from the peak of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, thunder rumbling, echoing throughout the legacy realm.</p><p>Both inside and outside the mountain, everyone could see the myriad violet lightning bolts at the summit, as if a Thunder God had descended, clad in thunderous robes, crowned with an imperial diadem, commanding the thunder, awe-inspiring all directions.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others all felt it, gazing towards the peak, wondering what True Person Zilei intended.</p><p>True Person Zilei's gaze was indifferent, sweeping across various locations on the mountain, before landing on the medicinal garden.</p><p>Within the medicinal garden.</p><p>The three had entered one after another. The spiritual mist dispersed in the chaos, revealing the scene within.</p><p>There was no wondrous spectacle, only a clear spring, its waters gurgling, fresh and natural. The only unique aspect was the exceptionally rich spiritual energy here.</p><p>A green vine grew within the spring, its roots anchored in the water, its leaves lush and verdant.</p><p>Two fruits were faintly visible beneath the leaves, round like bright moons, spiritual light forming illusions, as if depicting a celestial laurel palace, with celestial maidens dancing around the immortal fruits…</p><p>The spiritual light was actually an illusion formed by incredibly dense spiritual energy.</p><p>They had seen this type of spiritual herb at the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>“Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit!”</p><p>Su Mo and the other's expressions drastically changed, both exclaiming in astonishment.</p><p>Then, they saw True Person Hegao extend his hand, a Dharma Seal flying from his palm. Wherever it touched, the light barrier of the protective formation cracked.</p><p>The Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was real!</p><p>Back then, Kun Dao had actually wanted to use the real Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit to set a trap. After all, the Immortal Fruit was useless for the Artifact Spirit's spiritual refinement, and using the real one would be more effective.</p><p>Unfortunately, the protective formation was too strong. Before she could fully decipher it, she discovered the two Daoist True Persons were about to leave, so she had to use the medicinal garden's formation power to project the image of the vine.</p><p>Although a projection, it truly existed.</p><p>A mix of truth and falsehood, only then could she deceive the numerous Grand Cultivators.</p><p>True Person Hegao, being closest at the time and deeply versed in formations, had a faint inkling, but he wasn't certain. After all, who would be willing to use a Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit as bait? It was too extravagant.</p><p>He circled the medicinal garden repeatedly, partly to search for the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit and partly to observe the flow of the spiritual veins, finally achieving some understanding.</p><p>The Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was undoubtedly the most precious spiritual herb in the entire medicinal garden. The protective formation here was intricately linked to the formations throughout the garden, making it the most fortified location.</p><p>Now, True Person Hegao had a thorough grasp of the medicinal garden, and the protective formation posed no difficulty for him.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The protective formation shattered, triggering chaos throughout the medicinal garden.</p><p>The greatest chaos was here.</p><p>Just as True Person Hegao was about to break through the light barrier, two figures suddenly darted forward, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao, one on the left and one on the right, lunging directly towards him.</p><p>Since entering the legacy realm, Mo Xingdao had rarely displayed his prowess. Only a supreme treasure like the Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit could make him disregard everything.</p><p>Even collaborating with Su Zinan, with whom he had just formed a deadly feud, and offending the Daoist Sect, was a price worth paying!</p><p>Two Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruits, just enough to split.</p><p>He and his puppet were virtually one, their aura shocking. Su Zinan, having merged with two souls, was even more formidable. Both aimed directly for True Person Hegao's back.</p><p>In an instant, True Person Hegao faced the combined might of two peak experts alone, bearing immense pressure.</p><p>He didn't turn his head, his eyes suddenly turning cold, a snort escaping his throat. His figure vanished, transforming into an elegant celestial crane in mid-air.</p><p>Crimson-crowned and frost-feathered, its bearing was extraordinary.</p><p>More refined than any previous transformation.</p><p>In a flash, with a crane cry, the celestial crane split, one into ten. Ten illusory shadows, each in a different posture, all imbued with Dao韵.</p><p>Ten shadows formed a circle, a formation complete.</p><p>Ten Shadows of the Spiritual Crane!</p><p>Not just a powerful divine ability of True Person Hegao, but one infused with his profound understanding of formations, a creation merging all his divine abilities.</p><p>One man forming a formation, facing Su Mo and the other, without a trace of fear!</p><p>Crane shadows hovered.</p><p>Su Zinan's gaze chilled. His main body and two souls combined their power, wielding the black ruler, leaving streaks of ruler shadows in the void, slamming fiercely towards the crane formation.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Instantly, a crane shadow dispersed.</p><p>Su Zinan was startled, abruptly turning his head. Mo Xingdao's attack, though visually impressive, lacked the expected power of man and puppet united.</p><p>This glance made Su Zinan's face change dramatically.</p><p>The puppet beside Mo Xingdao had vanished without a trace.</p><p>At the same time, above the clear spring, beside the green vine, a figure suddenly appeared. It was Mo Xingdao's puppet! But its size had shrunk, its height now like an ordinary person.</p><p>Not only Su Zinan, but even True Person Hegao was astonished, unable to comprehend how Mo Xingdao accomplished this.</p><p>The puppet, regardless of their thoughts, reached out to grab the vine!</p><p>Just as their astonishment turned to anger, a Daoist shout echoed.</p><p>At the summit.</p><p>True Person Zilei took in the scene within the medicinal garden. The imperial crown on his head radiated brilliantly, detaching itself and shooting into the sky, instantly transforming into thunderclouds.</p><p>“Where are the legions of the Violet Thunder Department!”</p><p>True Person Zilei's eyes opened slightly, his aura profound.</p><p>The Thunder God's wrath shook the mountain and earth.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, the Poison King, and the others were all alerted by the thunderclouds. As the thunderclouds’ aura swept away the baleful winds around the medicinal garden, they too saw the scene within.</p><p>“Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. No wonder he hadn't found it on Kun Dao.</p><p>Who could have predicted that she would dare use it as bait before even obtaining it?</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth. Kun Dao was truly insane. He had chased after her, obtained the Crimson Immortal Pendant, but missed the Nascent Soul opportunity.</p><p>The Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was no Heavenly Exquisite Jade, and it was useful to him as well!</p><p>The competition for the Immortal Fruit had already been decided, and it was too late to return now.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Three violet beams shot down from the thunderclouds, plunging into the clear spring, manifesting into human forms mid-air.</p><p>The legions of the Violet Thunder Department, formed from thunder, clad in thunder armor, expressions stern, even their eyes violet, without pupils, only thunder threads coursing through their bodies.</p><p>Three members of the Violet Thunder Department, each with a formidable aura, each wielding thunder ropes, instantly descended beside the puppet.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The puppet, having just grasped the vine, shuddered violently. Its incredibly robust body was pierced by the thunder ropes, their other ends held by the members of the Violet Thunder Department.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the puppet forcefully seized a Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit. In the instant the cage formed, its figure flickered, incredibly breaking free from the chains and vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The puppet, having snatched the fruit, returned to Mo Xingdao's side, the large hole in its chest lingering, thunder permeating its body, a shocking sight.</p><p>“Yin-Yang Escape Technique!”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang, True Person Hegao, Su Zinan, the Poison King…</p><p>Everyone who witnessed this scene was shocked.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Escape Technique was the innate divine ability of the Yin-Yang Ghost魈, comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator. </p><p>“Yin-Yang… Yin-Yang…”</p><p>These two words flashed repeatedly through Qin Sang’s mind.</p><p>He had suspected it when he saw Mo Xingdao's puppet earlier, and now he was almost certain. Mo Xingdao had bought the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal!</p><p>He never expected the crystal to contain such a powerful divine ability as the Yin-Yang Escape Technique. Qin Sang smiled wryly. He truly had entered a treasure mountain without recognizing its value, lamenting his senior sister’s absence.</p><p>He couldn't blame anyone but his own lack of knowledge.</p><p>Since it was a trade, each party took what they needed, based on their own judgment.</p><p>Regret it?</p><p>Perhaps not.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal had been exchanged for the Thousand Knot Divine Net, enabling him to cultivate the 《Fire Seed Golden Lotus》 so smoothly. If he had been distracted by puppetry, how could he have come this far?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, he suddenly heard an explosion. Qin Sang focused his gaze, seeing the medicinal garden undergo a series of changes. At the same time, the thunderclouds shot down a violet thunder seal, striking a valley near the summit.</p><p>Light and shadow mingled chaotically as the thunder seal pierced through the restrictions.</p><p>For a brief moment, Qin Sang saw a jade-like mountain wall.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, as the remaining power of the thunder seal struck the jade wall directly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The jade wall shattered. As countless gazes, each filled with different emotions, watched, the fragments scattered, revealing a blurry figure, neither entirely Buddha nor Dao.</p><p>The figure stood several zhang tall, its aura ethereal. Taking a step forward, it raised a finger, gently tracing a line in the void, leaving a momentary mark.</p><p>The mark and the figure remained only for an instant before vanishing, but their lingering resonance was profound, the mark seemingly embodying the birth and death of Dao韵.</p><p>Everyone, captivated, forgot their regrets.</p><p>Just then, the members of the Violet Thunder Department abandoned their pursuit of the puppet, picking the last Spiritual Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit and returning, kneeling in mid-air, presenting a thunder tray to True Person Zilei.</p><p>Taking the Immortal Fruit, he placed it in his mouth.</p><p>True Person Zilei gazed at the Dao mark, pondering for a moment, then suddenly laughed, startling everyone.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>His laughter echoed.</p><p>True Person Zilei lightly shook his thunderous robes and took a step.</p><p>Steps seemed to appear in the void.</p><p>Ascending nine steps, nine steps to the apex!</p><p>By then, the barrier had shattered, and the circling flying swords retreated.</p><p>Tribulation clouds gathered.</p>
