<h1>Chapter 1118: Puppet Battle</h1><p>“The Soul Cleansing Solution is most effective when taken for the first time before reaching Nascent Soul.  Its potency diminishes greatly afterward, so giving you more would be pointless.” The elder explained, dividing the Soul Cleansing Solution into two small jade vials and handing them to the young man and woman.</p><p>Next, the elder pointed a finger and gently pressed the stone cauldron.</p><p>Runes flickered on the cauldron's surface, creating a vortex, and the remaining Soul Cleansing Solution vanished, its destination unknown.</p><p>The two held the vials of Soul Cleansing Solution, treasuring them and carefully putting them away.</p><p>“Alright! Junior Sister, let's split up. You stay in the outer area and double-check the ancestral restrictions and immortal prohibitions. I'll take these two to the inner hall and tell them the true ancestral teachings.” The elder said.</p><p>The old woman nodded, then her expression turned serious as she remembered something. “Brother, be careful. Ling Zhuzi, the Demon Lord, and the others are all cunning and treacherous. It's best to avoid encountering them. If they learn the location of the Four Saints Palace, they certainly won't let it go. Since our ancestors' time, our Four Saints Palace has weakened, forcing us into seclusion.  We are no longer at our peak and can't afford any turmoil.”</p><p>The elder sighed softly. "I hope that one of them can break through to Deity Transformation and unlock the ancestral heritage.  Perhaps there's a way to leave the Canglang Sea inside. It's a shame our descendants are so inadequate; no one has reached Deity Transformation, and we've been trapped in this cage-like place."</p><p>The old woman also fell silent.</p><p>The four then teleported back to the wooden hall, emerging from the cloud.</p><p>The old woman left alone.</p><p>The elder led the two disciples towards the depths of the inner hall.</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped through the gate of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>He was wary, unsure what the first trial would be.</p><p>The moment he passed through the barrier, Qin Sang felt a tightness around his body, and darkness enveloped his vision. The other cultivators around him vanished, leaving him alone.</p><p>Soon, his vision cleared, and Qin Sang squinted, examining his surroundings. He found himself in a circular hall, empty except for a circular arena beneath his feet.</p><p>At the back of the hall, a staircase led to the upper level, but it was blocked by a shimmering barrier.</p><p>"Is this the Puppet Battle?" Qin Sang thought, recalling the information he had gathered.</p><p>The Puppet Battle involved facing various puppets on the arena until either the puppets were completely destroyed or he was exhausted and defeated. There was no surrender.</p><p>The rules seemed cruel, but comparatively, the Puppet Battle was considered one of the simplest trials.</p><p>It was said that the puppets' strength wasn't overly outrageous, and there were rest periods.  Anyone daring to enter the inner hall should be confident in passing the Puppet Battle; otherwise, they were overestimating themselves.</p><p>The Puppet Battle was also one of the most common among the first three trials.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean one could be careless. The puppets weren't static; some had strange abilities, and carelessness could lead to defeat.</p><p>Standing in the center of the arena, Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>The hall remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, wondering if he needed to activate some mechanism.  Suddenly, the arena beneath his feet trembled, and several dark figures leaped out, surrounding him.</p><p>"Six…" Qin Sang assessed the puppets.</p><p>The puppets were fierce-looking and identical, resembling tigers. They crouched on the arena, baring their fangs at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft sound of surprise, a sense of familiarity washing over him.</p><p>These puppets resembled the puppet beasts on the first six floors of the Heavenly Tower, even their appearance being nearly the same.</p><p>“The puppet beasts on the sixth floor of the Heavenly Tower require even Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators some effort to defeat.  Are these puppets similar?” Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a gust of wind behind him.</p><p>Without turning his head, he summoned the Ebony Sword and slashed with his fingers.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword hovered in mid-air, splitting into six beams of sword light, simultaneously striking the six puppet beasts.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword light hit the center of each puppet beast's forehead, easily piercing their skulls and leaving small holes.</p><p>The six puppet beasts froze, instantly turning into dust and disappearing.</p><p>"Just like the puppet beasts in the Heavenly Tower, they're of the same origin. But they don't start from the Foundation Establishment stage. Each one is equivalent to late-stage Foundation Establishment. If it's like this on every level, with so many puppet beasts appearing at once, most people would be overwhelmed…"  Qin Sang thought.</p><p>He had entered the Heavenly Tower twice and was very familiar with the puppet beasts, knowing how to deal with them. Naturally, he felt no pressure.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, do you want to practice your skills? Then I can rest for a while.”  Qin Sang turned his head and said.</p><p>Bai, for some unknown reason, had emerged from the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Bai replied with disinterest, "I feel there are still flaws in the Fire Curse Seed.  Being too close carries the risk of Old Devil Mu detecting it. I want to find a way to improve the restriction."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and sheathed his sword, walking towards the staircase.</p><p>The barrier on the stairs had vanished when he destroyed the six puppets.</p><p>Bai followed behind, holding the Fire Curse Seed, his expression focused.</p><p>Cultivators could recover their spiritual energy on the stairs. Qin Sang didn't need to and walked directly to the second level.</p><p>The second level was similar to the first.</p><p>New puppets jumped out, their strength indeed increased, comparable to early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators. Qin Sang cut them down effortlessly with his sword, passing through two levels of puppet battles without pause and entering the fourth level.</p><p>Arriving here, Qin Sang found there were no stairs leading upwards.</p><p>"The final stage?" Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, remaining vigilant.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…*</p><p>Six leopard-shaped puppets leaped out.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something and understood.</p><p>The requirement for this stage wasn't to defeat the puppets but to endure their attacks for the duration of a stick of incense.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he focused on the puppets, immediately realizing that this Puppet Battle was unusual.</p><p>He noticed that the leopard puppets' claws gleamed coldly like sharp swords. Their positions were also deliberate, not simply surrounding him, but forming a specific formation.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>One of the puppet leopards suddenly moved.</p><p>The other puppets followed closely.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang had a strange feeling. The puppets around him seemed to disappear, replaced by a series of unpredictable, sharp sword lights.</p><p>“The person who refined these puppet beasts is extraordinary!  It’s a pity the puppets are restricted, greatly diminishing their power. Otherwise, even if we joined forces, it might be dangerous.” Bai’s voice came from behind. He, too, was startled.</p><p>"It’s not a puppet formation! It’s a sword formation!” A spark of realization flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.</p><p>The creator of the puppet beasts had, through astonishing means, integrated a sword formation into them.  When the puppets attacked, they even displayed a hint of sword intent.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was not alarmed but delighted.</p><p>He had been struggling to comprehend sword intent, unable to find guidance and left to fumble his way towards a crude, unorthodox sword wheel.</p><p>He had originally planned to prioritize self-preservation and simply survive the duration of the incense stick, but now faced with a sword formation, he naturally wouldn't let go of this opportunity.</p>
