<h1>Chapter 2219: Eternal Night</h1><p>The giant eyes of the demonic python’s manifestation hung in the sky like two lanterns.  Flames erupted from its body, turning the surrounding mist into a sea of crimson.</p><p>Crimson light filled the heavens, illuminating the terrifying form of the demonic python.  The giant serpent let out a series of piercing roars, its eyes glowing brighter and brighter, burning like two coals.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Pillars of fire suddenly erupted from the ground.</p><p>The demonic python’s gaze fell upon a mountain, instantly igniting it.  The mountain was visibly consumed and melted by the raging inferno.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>As the demonic python’s gaze turned towards Qin Sang and Liu Li, two beams of light, solid as substance, pierced the void, shooting down from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang’s protective energy fluctuated violently, while Liu Li’s face turned pale.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ball of fire previously spewed by the serpent suddenly exploded with far greater power than Qin Sang anticipated, seemingly infused with new energy by the demonic python’s gaze.</p><p>The flames raged, licking at Qin Sang and Liu Li, threatening to engulf them.  The power of this demonic fire was unlike any Qin Sang had ever encountered; it far surpassed any spiritual fire he had seen.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Sword light, like a dragon, flew out from Hui Ying’s sword.  Despite several powerful strikes, it only managed to impede the flames, unable to push them back.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang and Liu Li retreated, widening the distance.</p><p>He looked up, meeting the demonic python’s gaze.  A fierce battle seemed inevitable.  He wondered about the escape speed of the Sky Serpent General and whether he and Liu Li could escape.</p><p>However, encountering this strange demonic cultivator, Qin Sang was reluctant to leave without obtaining more information and solving some mysteries.</p><p>His intuition told him the Sky Serpent General’s origins were highly unusual.</p><p>The Sky Serpent General claimed to be from Yi Constellation. With twenty-eight constellations in total, it was not even a star lord or star official.  Yet, a mere Sky Serpent General possessed the cultivation of a late Nascent Soul stage.  It was difficult to imagine the scale of the organization it belonged to. If the Eastern Sea aquatic races possessed such a force, he should have heard of it.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sky Serpent General’s behavior was very strange. Like the demonic beasts in the beast tide, it was consumed by madness, its consciousness muddled.  However, Qin Sang and Liu Li were unaffected.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, particularly at the sky. There were no other falling stars; only this single Sky Serpent General. Although powerful, it was irrational. He had a chance.</p><p>He had defeated the Immortal Child. Surely, he could handle a mere Sky Serpent General?</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to Liu Li, instructing her to evade the immediate threat, support him from a distance, and to temporarily refrain from unsealing the Emperor Ce Yi Talisman.</p><p>Liu Li nodded and flew away.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang secretly cast an incantation, summoning a torrential downpour – the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Rainstorm Technique.</p><p>The rain poured down, significantly reducing the fire’s intensity, but only briefly before a fierce counterattack commenced.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Qin Sang changed his swordsmanship, slowly deploying the Four-Image Sword Formation. His eyes narrowed as he observed the demonic python’s movements, noticing its lack of intent to avoid the sword formation.</p><p>Any experienced cultivator would not let an enemy draw them into a sword formation.</p><p>Perhaps sensing danger instinctively, the demonic python’s counterattack was extremely fierce, but it failed to evade the sword formation, leading to its fall into the Star Sea.</p><p>This was a test. It proved that the Sky Serpent General was indeed irrational. Qin Sang’s heart settled.  He activated the altar and the Five Thunders Heart of Heaven Seal Talisman!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The demonic python was indeed ferocious. Facing this thunderbolt, it chose to confront it head-on.  Its serpent head shot skyward, its maw open to unleash a jet of flame to meet the lightning.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blue lightning and the raging flames collided, the shockwave sweeping across the Star Sea and lasting for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared. He solidified the sword formation and simultaneously activated the Sword Star, unleashing countless sword lights across the sky towards the Sky Serpent General.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The demonic python turned its upper body, spewing a ring of demonic fire that swept across the battlefield.  The sword lights melted like ice and snow upon contact, unable to get close, demonstrating the power of the demonic fire.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's offensive had just begun. In a short time, he had already identified many flaws in the Sky Serpent General’s behavior.  Lacking rationality, despite immense power, this opponent was not so difficult to deal with.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang seized the Serpent General's weakness, using only swordsmanship and lightning techniques.  Thunderbolts struck the giant serpent apparition repeatedly, while a constellation of swords formed a deadly array, eroding the apparition's power.</p><p>The Serpent General was completely trapped. The immense serpent apparition, capable of shattering countless stars with a single movement, seemed to be hitting an invisible wall, becoming increasingly entangled.</p><p>"Still not using your magical treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the serpent apparition, noting that the Serpent General only relied on its apparition's power.  He wondered if the General lacked a magical treasure, or had lost its reason, unable to use it.</p><p>Some cultivators fiercely believe in their own strength, rejecting any external aid. However, these are rare individuals. External aids often play a significant role in a cultivator's power.</p><p>The outcome of this battle seemed inevitable.</p><p>Qin Sang thought this, when suddenly the serpent apparition reared up, letting out a piercing shriek.  A crimson light shone into the sword array as a red star appeared above the apparition's head.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He saw flames appearing out of thin air, far more powerful than the previous demonic flames; a mysterious technique.</p><p>Having probed enough, Qin Sang summoned his Five-Element Crown, a five-colored radiance appearing before his chest. A beam of five-element energy shot towards the red star.  Simultaneously, the lightning and sword array attacks continued as Qin Sang unleashed his full power, supported by the power of  Liuli. The Serpent General's loss of intelligence became a fatal weakness. Soon, the red star shattered, the serpent apparition's momentum broken, its defeat imminent.</p><p>Throughout the fight, Qin Sang observed the Serpent General, noticing no sign of regained intelligence. It was completely frenzied.  Surrender was impossible, and even capturing it would be pointless.</p><p>Beyond the sword array,</p><p>Liuli remained vigilant, constantly scanning her surroundings for uninvited guests.  When the Four-Symbol Sword Array was activated, the area remained unremarkable, simply dark.  Liuli sent gusts of icy wind into the array, sensing that Qin Sang was suppressing the Serpent General's power, and the battle's end was near.</p><p>Suddenly, Liuli sensed something, looking up sharply. Her eyes showed surprise and gravity.</p><p>Since entering this region, storms and fog were ubiquitous, the world a greyish-white. Although dim, it wasn't completely dark.</p><p>Now, however, Liuli saw that the east had become pitch black, the darkness spreading rapidly towards them, like a black curtain descending.  It was absolute darkness.</p><p>Within the battle array, Qin Sang had completely subdued the Serpent General.  Noticing the change outside, he frowned slightly, but his attack continued unabated.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's relentless assault, the serpent apparition roared repeatedly, but its defenses faltered, revealing more and more weaknesses which Qin Sang exploited, hastening its destruction.</p><p>Finally, the Serpent General was utterly overwhelmed.  As it neared its end, Qin Sang sensed something and swiftly struck the killing blow!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of azure lightning struck the Serpent General's true form.</p><p>Its scales were already broken and bloody.  Its head exploded under the lightning, flesh and blood scattering.</p><p>The serpent body stiffened, falling downwards.</p><p>Then, an astonishing sight occurred. The serpent's body shattered like an illusion, the scattered flesh and blood vanishing without a trace.</p><p>The Serpent General vanished, leaving only the battle's marks as testament to its existence.</p><p>Seeing this, Liuli exclaimed, "It was also fake?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>It was hard to believe that the Serpent General, like the other beasts, was an illusion. But was its intelligence also false?</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank as he considered a possibility: Perhaps these beasts were not only increasing in power, but also undergoing mutations, eventually gaining intelligence, becoming indistinguishable from true beings!</p><p>If so, the beast tide would be even harder to defeat.</p><p>"Qin Daoist, what are you thinking?" Liuli flew closer, seeing Qin Sang's thoughtful expression.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, hesitantly saying, "I have a feeling... the serpent apparition seemed familiar..."</p><p>It was a strange feeling.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered many demonic cultivators who also cultivated apparitions, but he'd never felt this before.</p><p>"Is it because of the technique?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, and looked towards where the Serpent General had fallen.  The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was the most unique demonic cultivation technique he'd ever seen.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Refining* cultivation method draws power from the stars.  Could there be a connection with the Sky Serpent General, who claims to originate from the Wing constellation?</p><p>Alas, the Sky Serpent General was merely an illusion…</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed her stray thoughts, glanced at the darkness surrounding them, and her expression turned serious.  "Is this the power of the Spring and Autumn Gnomon?" she asked.</p><p>Liuli nodded, her tone equally grave. "Whenever the Spring and Autumn Gnomon appears, there's an alternation of light and darkness, day and night. This scene closely resembles historical accounts."</p><p>"It seems this hidden realm has undergone a significant transformation," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>The Spring and Autumn Gnomon doesn't easily emerge.  It usually requires a Daoist cultivator to trigger certain conditions upon entering.</p><p>They had only been inside a short time, yet the day-night reversal phenomenon already appeared.  There's only one explanation: the realm's transformation caused the Spring and Autumn Gnomon to appear prematurely.</p><p>This was far from good news for them. It meant their prospects were even bleaker. They hadn't held much hope of obtaining the spirit's recognition to begin with.</p><p>However, since Master Ning gave specific instructions, they would undoubtedly have to compete for it.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Heart Lake.</p><p>Among the Cloud Mountains.</p><p>Since Qin Sang and the others entered the hidden realm, Hong Tian had risen from his meditation cushion, gazing at the sky at times, and at the depths of the thick fog at others.</p><p>Suddenly, Hong Tian spoke. "I doubt any more fellow cultivators will appear.  I'm sure you've all seen the decree from above?"</p><p>He was alone, seemingly speaking to the void.</p><p>Silence blanketed the surroundings.</p><p>After a moment, a voice from beyond the mountains demanded, "Hong Tian, what are you trying to say?"</p><p>"I've heard that you, Hong Tian, are quite audacious.  Even at the Empty Realm, second level, you dared to cross the Winged People. You wouldn't dare defy the higher powers, would you?" A woman's light laughter followed, tinged with mockery.</p><p>"Do you think I'm unaware of my limitations?"</p><p>Hong Tian smiled faintly, unperturbed. Turning towards the depths of the Heart Lake, he said, "It seems those old fellows are all deeply involved and unable to spare themselves."</p><p>This trial was a way to send everyone in to stir up trouble, a test of those ancestors.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had been inside for quite some time, yet the ancestors hadn't reacted. This confirmed some suspicions.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>A sharp voice snorted. "Those old fogies are stuck inside; we're the ones left to deal with the aftermath! This was meant to be for us, yet others want a piece of the pie. I want to see who's shameless enough to show themselves now!"</p><p>No one agreed, but no one refuted him either, indicating that this was the general sentiment.</p><p>"Perhaps you're overthinking it,"</p><p>After a period of silence, a gentle female voice spoke.</p><p>"The ancestors want to secure some benefits for their disciples; it's only human nature. As long as they don't interfere excessively, the disciples will ultimately obtain only a fraction of the benefits. It's harmless."</p><p>Before the words faded, a hearty voice boomed, "Haha, the Empress is magnanimous! Your Majesty is right. As long as the ancestors don't break the rules, if some juniors are blessed with good fortune, we can afford to cede some. Don't worry too much. Our true opponents are right here among us.  Hong Tian, you're waking everyone up now. Are you trying to establish some kind of order?"</p><p>From this, it was clear that the woman was the Mermaid Empress!</p><p>"I'm not as optimistic as you two,"</p><p>The sharp voice remained firm. "Not everyone can see the bigger picture! Some call themselves ancestors, but they've been detached from the world for too long, sitting high and mighty, acting as they please. We must be wary!"</p><p>"Exactly, opportunities are tempting! This is our greatest chance for advancement, perhaps even the greatest chance in our lives. Caution is necessary," another person chimed in. "If so, let's wait a bit longer and see how the juniors perform. Anyone with ulterior motives will inevitably reveal themselves. The old fellows can't interfere from within, so the situation is still under our control."</p><p>"Hong Tian, you're too hasty," someone complained.</p><p>Hong Tian didn't take offense.  He spread his hands.  "I come from a humble, small clan, alone and vulnerable. How can I not be anxious?  If we don't establish an order quickly, even if those old fellows don't interfere, what happens if someone makes a misstep afterward and refuses to acknowledge it, using force to coerce others?"</p><p>"Hong Tian, you really are too anxious!"</p><p>The hearty voice coldly stated, "Tribal distinctions only matter in the Mist Sea. Above the Saint Realm, there's only ever one Otherhuman Clan. That's the ancestral decree!"</p><p>The Mermaid Empress calmly said, "Who can say for sure where the power truly lies?  The Zhu Huai Clan may have Ancestor Realm elders above them; perhaps we'll all be dependent on your favor, Hong Tian."</p><p>"Oh?" Hong Tian grinned. "I'll take that as a blessing, Empress. I'll certainly keep my word then."</p>
