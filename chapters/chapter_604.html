<h1>Chapter 597: The Celestial Platform (Can this count as three updates?)</h1><p>After several maneuvers, they arrived at the place Yun Youzi had indicated.</p><p>A sword energy shattered a point of light.</p><p>Countless specks of light scattered, illuminating a crack in the darkness.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>Yun Youzi hissed, and Qin Sang immediately used his sword to envelop them both, rushing into the fissure.</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying compressive force bore down on them, but before they could react, they disappeared instantly. Light dispelled the darkness, revealing a scene of ruins.</p><p>Although it was only an instant, the feeling of almost being crushed into pulp was so clear and terrifying that it sent a cold sweat down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>Before them lay the ruins of a largely collapsed palace and a scene of decay.</p><p>In the past, there must have been more than one palace here; it must have been a grand complex of celestial palaces, but now only this fragment remained; the other parts were nowhere to be found.</p><p>In front of the palace, a large area still had some remaining pavilions.</p><p>But the pool was dry, the paths overgrown; between the cracks in the stone slabs on the ground, thick weeds grew vigorously, even more robust than those in the valley below.</p><p>Of the ancient hall, only a few sections of wall stubbornly remained standing, surrounded by rubble and decay.</p><p>Even so, one could still see something of its former grandeur from the ruins.</p><p>In the ruins of the ancient hall, directly in front, was a section of remaining wall. A broken plaque hung precariously from a corner of this wall.</p><p>The plaque had lost its luster, reduced to dark, decaying wood; the inscription could only be barely discerned; it was the character "Gathering" that Yun Youzi had recognized.</p><p>The area wasn't large; a sweep of divine sense revealed everything.</p><p>It was indeed a ruin; even inside the Gathering Spirit Hall, there was nothing remarkable.</p><p>Those who discovered this place had wasted their energy and time breaking through the formations, searching more than once with great hope, only to find no treasure, and left in a fit of rage.</p><p>“It is indeed a part of the Gathering Spirit Hall, and the main hall where the Gathering Spirit Bowl was kept!”</p><p>Yun Youzi said gravely, “Most of the Gathering Spirit Hall fell into the Hanging Garden Palace during the collapse, and the treasures inside were looted by those Nascent Soul cultivators.  Unexpectedly, the most important part ended up here. There should be a Celestial Platform in the hall, where the Gathering Spirit Bowl was placed. The celestial prohibition protecting it was destroyed, and the platform is hidden.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi exchanged a glance, dashed to the side of the remaining wall, looked up at the broken plaque, and began searching the ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, sending out a gust of wind to clear away the rubble, revealing a ground covered in cracks.</p><p>Some of the damage clearly wasn't from the ancient era; it was made later by people who came in searching for treasures, all of whom ultimately came up empty-handed.</p><p>Based on what Yi Tiannie had seen in the ancient text, one needed to use a special incantation combined with specific steps in the main hall to activate the hidden restriction and reveal the treasure.</p><p>They found the central position of the Gathering Spirit Hall.</p><p>The tiles there were shattered, with dozens of sword marks, a scene of chaos; the earth beneath had been dug up, but on the surface, everything appeared normal.</p><p>Fortunately, the outline of the Gathering Spirit Hall remained. Qin Sang stood in the center, feet together, hands forming seals.</p><p>Now, he felt a little nervous, unsure whether the records in the ancient text were reliable. While Yun Youzi knew this was the main hall of the Gathering Spirit Hall and that the Gathering Spirit Bowl was indeed hidden here, he wasn't sure if this method would work.</p><p>The unusual phenomena in the surrounding plants indicated a high probability of the Three Lights Jade Liquid being hidden here.</p><p>If they failed to open it and returned empty-handed, it would be devastating.</p><p>‘啪!’</p><p>One seal was completed, and Qin Sang struck the ground with his palm.</p><p>It sank into the earth, without any change.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at his hands, concentrating on the incantation, not looking at his feet. Dozens of complex seals were performed in quick succession.  Then Qin Sang suddenly took a step.</p><p>With speed and agility, he instantly changed position, but the ground still showed no sign.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang stepped according to the Celestial Gan steps, rotating around the center of the Gathering Spirit Hall, his figure constantly shifting, like a butterfly flitting through flowers, exceptionally agile.</p><p>At the same time, countless seals were struck into the ground, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the secret technique seemed almost complete, yet nothing happened.</p><p>Even Yun Youzi's face showed a hint of worry; the Three Lights Jade Liquid was a matter of life and death for him, yet even with his temperament, he couldn't maintain complete composure.</p><p>Finally, with another step, Qin Sang turned gracefully, his feet rising and falling, returning to the central position of the Gathering Spirit Hall.</p><p>‘噗!’</p><p>The final seal struck the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the ground, finding it still unchanged.  Reluctant to give up, he extended his divine sense to scan the area beneath the ground.</p><p>It seems the celestial barrier has changed; this method won't summon the Celestial Platform," Yun Youzi sighed.  "Oh well, it's my fate. I'm not destined for the Three Lights Jade Liquid. Qin, you should collect more ancient texts from the Purple Micro Palace to learn about the celestial barrier.  Next time, we might find the Three Lights Jade Liquid. It's a divine treasure, a great help – don't miss out…"</p><p>Yun Youzi was clearly disappointed, yet remained composed and unconcerned.  Seeing the situation was hopeless, he turned to leave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as he took a step, he froze, turning to stare intently at Qin Sang's head, his eyes brimming with astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something amiss and quickly retreated.</p><p>The next moment, a rainbow-like beam of light descended from the heavens, incredibly beautiful.</p><p>After showering down, the light coalesced, remaining solid and undissolved.  In the center of the Gathering Spirit Hall, within the beam of light, a square outline appeared – the shadow of the Celestial Platform!</p><p>The Celestial Platform was enormous, occupying most of the Gathering Spirit Hall. Its top was flat and several meters higher than the remaining walls.</p><p>The shadow of the Celestial Platform solidified, manifesting from thin air.  There was no sign of it before the light appeared, no wonder they searched everywhere without finding it.</p><p>Qin Sang's hands clenched.  A stroke of luck!  They had finally summoned the Celestial Platform!</p><p>The strange phenomenon unfolded rapidly.  In a short while, a towering Celestial Platform stood before them in the center of the Gathering Spirit Hall.</p><p>Suppressing their excitement, they confirmed the absence of any dangerous restrictions around the Celestial Platform before flying up to its top.</p><p>The top was a vast square platform, adorned with jade pillars, intricately carved with dragons and phoenixes – a magnificent sight.  In the very center of the platform was a small recess.</p><p>The recess was tiny, about the size of a monk's alms bowl.</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the edge of the Celestial Platform, curiously observing the recess.</p><p>This must be where the Gathering Spirit Bowl was placed.  Who would have thought it was so small, yet reputed to gather the power of the sun, moon, and stars?  The methods of the ancient masters are truly profound and awe-inspiring!</p><p>The recess was empty.</p><p>Yun Youzi said with disappointment, "The Gathering Spirit Bowl is gone.  Either stolen or destroyed during the upheaval.  What a pity!  What a pity!"</p><p>Qin Sang echoed his regret.</p><p>Scanning the empty Celestial Platform, he asked hesitantly, "Senior, where do you think the Three Lights Jade Liquid might be hidden?"</p>
