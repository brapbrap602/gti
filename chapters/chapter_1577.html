<h1>Chapter 1568: Elder Yanshan</h1><p>Leaving Mount Nonattachment.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back.</p><p>So far, Mount Nonattachment was the only power in the Central Continent that could possibly become an ally.</p><p>Several crucial pieces of intelligence had come through Mount Nonattachment, allowing him to timely understand the movements of all parties and accurately grasp the overall situation.</p><p>Losing Mount Nonattachment as a channel would make things more difficult in the future.</p><p>For a sect, ensuring its legacy was paramount, and Situ Yu's choice was understandable.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, withdrawing his gaze, and returned to Mount Pu.</p><p>His main body consolidated his cultivation and practiced the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>His avatar retrieved the remaining Cold Crystals, preparing to refine them to confirm how helpful they were to the *Ice Soul Divine Light* before deciding whether to visit Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Regardless of how the world's situation changed,</p><p>It wouldn't affect the small Fuddu Prefecture for the time being.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>The avatar finished refining the Cold Crystals.  The results were quite encouraging.  Qin Sang decided to make a trip to the Northern Wilderness, and both his main body and avatar would go.</p><p>He planned to have his avatar, carrying the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, visit Elder Yanshan. The search for Cold Crystals would be handled by the avatar.</p><p>This wouldn't affect his main body’s cultivation of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was too important to his main body. Qin Sang wasn't at ease letting his avatar take it alone, so his main body would follow in secret, preventing any accidents.</p><p>On Mount Pu.</p><p>The Zhou and Ruan couple received a message and came to Mount Pu to receive orders.</p><p>They were greeted by Xie An and a rising star named Xie Ruyun.</p><p>Forty years ago, Xie Qian’s lifespan had reached its end, passing away peacefully.</p><p>His cultivation was solidified at the mid-Gold Core stage.</p><p>Before his death, Xie Qian saw the prosperity of the Xie family and died without regrets.</p><p>The Xie family and the Tower Terrace Monastery had a close relationship, and several Dao Companion pairs had formed among their disciples. The Zhou and Ruan couple felt at home on Mount Pu, casually sitting across from Xie An and stopping the disciples from serving tea.</p><p>“May I ask why Senior Qingfeng summoned us?”</p><p>Zhou Jin bowed and asked.</p><p>Xie An and Xie Ruyun both shook their heads, saying they didn't know.</p><p>They had just exchanged a few words when the room suddenly darkened as Qin Sang’s avatar walked in from outside.  They hurriedly stood up and bowed.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the four.</p><p>He thought to himself that he still had too few usable subordinates. Zhou Jin, the highest in cultivation, was still some distance from the late-Gold Core stage.</p><p>In times of peace, Nascent Soul cultivators were busy cultivating and overcoming tribulations, their whereabouts erratic.</p><p>In the cultivation world, Gold Core cultivators could be considered experts.</p><p>As chaotic times approached, the cultivation of Zhou Jin and the others wasn't enough. If he had a Nascent Soul subordinate, many things would be much easier.</p><p>Unfortunately, reaching Nascent Soul wasn't so easy.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the Green Ram Monastery.</p><p>After one closed-door cultivation session, a hundred years had passed.</p><p>He wondered how many people from the Green Ram Monastery had achieved success on the path of the Great Dao?</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was certainly out of the question.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, Mei Gu, and Li Yufu, from oldest to youngest. Shangguan Lifeng was about the same age as Qin Sang, and the youngest, Li Yufu, wasn’t more than fifty years younger than Qin Sang.</p><p>If they failed to reach Nascent Soul, they were probably already bones in their graves.</p><p>Once parted from old friends, there might never be another chance to meet.</p><p>Before leaving the North Sea, Qin Sang had already anticipated this.  After arriving in the Central Continent, he certainly wouldn't be able to return in the short term.</p><p>Now recalling it, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>One day, when matters in the Central Continent were settled, and he returned to the North Sea, how many familiar faces would he still see?</p><p>Even Liu Li, who had traveled with him to the Central Continent, had been without a trace for a hundred years.</p><p>Parting from life and death was something every Dao seeker had to get used to.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, and Zhou Jin and the others dared not speak, respectfully waiting.</p><p>After giving them some guidance on their cultivation, Qin Sang ordered them to contact the major trading companies, sparing no spirit stones, to gather as much information as possible.</p><p>They all agreed.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang flew out of Mount Pu alone.</p><p>His main body was already waiting outside. He absorbed his second Nascent Soul into his body for nurturing and began his journey north.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s cultivation grounds were called the Yanshan Mountains, located in the northwest of the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>Situ Yu had given him a rough location.</p><p>However, the Northern Wilderness was vast and sparsely populated, and finding a specific mountain range would take some effort.</p><p>His main body set out personally. After a hundred years of seclusion, looking at the mountains and rivers of the outside world again gave him a feeling of having passed through a lifetime. He simply slowed down his escape technique, traveling with the wind.</p><p>Heading north from Zhuozhou, he entered Zhaoyaozhou.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt the tension in Zhaoyaozhou. In less than an hour of flight, he saw several battles.</p><p>Zhaoyaozhou had no super-sects like Mount Nonattachment. Three mid-sized sects formed a three-legged tripod, a structure that doomed Zhaoyaozhou to instability.</p><p>Coupled with its proximity to the Northern Wilderness, it was even worse.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang casually dealt with a few unruly demonic cultivators, flew over Mount Zhaoyao, and returned to the Northern Wilderness. Tired of the scenery, he increased his speed.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Wooo…’</p><p>The cold wind howled like a knife.</p><p>Heavy snow fell.</p><p>A blizzard couldn't describe the current snowfall.</p><p>Gray, gloomy clouds pressed low against the ground. Snowflakes, like clumps of cotton, were poured down from the sky, blanketing the earth in the dark night, as if it would never stop.</p><p>In his field of vision, nothing could be seen but snow.</p><p>The environment of the Northern Wilderness was just that harsh.</p><p>In fact, this was the Snow Calamity, one of the nine calamities of the Northern Wilderness that everyone dreaded.</p><p>The Snow Calamity had the widest range of destruction among the nine calamities.</p><p>Once a Snow Calamity occurred somewhere, it would last for years, and the most terrifying ones could last for decades. It would not only cause devastating damage to mortals, but low-level cultivators would also have their strength greatly reduced in such an environment.</p><p>Fortunately, snow calamities rarely occurred in the densely populated eastern part of the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>Amidst the swirling snow.</p><p>Qin Sang flew low, only about ten feet above the snow-covered ground.</p><p>He had already entered the western part of the Northern Wilderness, unexpectedly encountering a snow calamity.</p><p>The heavy snow was repelled as it hit his protective true essence.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>He didn't know how long the Snow Calamity had lasted.  The heavy snow had filled the rivers and ravines.  As far as the eye could see, the snow surface was completely flat, with only a few isolated mountain peaks visible in the distance.</p><p>In such an environment, it wouldn't be easy to even find someone to ask for directions.</p><p>“Eh? Finally encountered living people.”</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, releasing his external avatar and ordering the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to hide within his avatar's dantian.  His main body then retreated into the shadows, vanishing.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The avatar left a white trail in the air.</p><p>On a mountain ahead, three low-level cultivators were busy picking a kind of small blue flower. Hearing the sound of something breaking through the air behind them, they hurriedly gathered, summoning their respective magical artifacts with wary expressions.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Snowflakes rushed towards their faces.</p><p>A figure landed ‘唰’ in front of them.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang tossed them a few spirit stones and soared away, holding a topographical map in his hand.  Several landmarks matched Situ Yu’s description, basically confirming the location of the Yanshan Mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang continued north, flying for half an hour.  Ahead lay a vast range of mountains.</p><p>Due to the Snow Calamity, only the upper halves of the mountain peaks were exposed above the snow.  From afar, they looked like white burial mounds.</p><p>Such a place was indeed a good place for secluded cultivation.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.  He awakened the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and slowly flew towards the depths of the mountain range.</p><p>The Yanshan Mountains were just one range within the larger group, named by Elder Yanshan himself.</p><p>The topographical map from those three cultivators didn’t mark the Yanshan Mountains, indicating that Elder Yanshan wasn’t well-known in the area.  Just as Situ Yu had said, he was a solitary cultivator.</p><p>Back then, Situ Yu had travelled here and befriended Elder Yanshan.</p><p>The two were kindred spirits, cooperating to hunt down a strange fox.</p><p>Because Elder Yanshan preferred tranquility and Situ Yu was preoccupied with sect affairs, their contact later became less frequent.</p><p>After flying around these mountain peaks for quite a while, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly finally discovered that a seemingly ordinary mountain peak concealed a profound mystery. The snowy scenery was likely an illusion created by a grand formation, seamlessly blending with the surrounding environment.</p><p>Besides Elder Yanshan, there should be no one else nearby capable of setting up such a spirit formation.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura, flying directly towards that mountain.</p><p>Before he got close.</p><p>A vigorous voice suddenly rang out from within the mountain, “This fellow Daoist has been circling around my cave dwelling, lingering and refusing to leave. What exactly do you want?”</p><p>“Are you Elder Yanshan?”</p><p>To show goodwill, Qin Sang stopped from afar, cupped his hands towards the Yanshan Mountains, and said in a clear voice, “I am Qingfeng.  I have come at the recommendation of Sect Master Situ with a request.”</p><p>“Sect Master Situ?  Is it Situ Yu?”</p><p>Elder Yanshan chuckled, “I didn’t expect Sect Master Situ to still remember this old man.”</p><p>His tone wasn't unfriendly.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the letter written on the jade slip, flicking his finger and sending it into the mountain.</p><p>The snow surface, which appeared level with the surroundings, was actually empty beneath.  The jade slip passed through without any obstruction, sinking into the snow and disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang stood calmly in place.</p><p>A short while later, the snow surface cracked open, revealing the lush green scenery below.  “Since you’ve been recommended by Sect Master Situ, Fellow Daoist, please come in and talk.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, his peripheral vision inadvertently glancing at a low mountain peak at the edge of the range.  He entered the Yanshan Mountains through the opening without a change in expression.</p><p>His main body opened a cave dwelling on that low peak.</p><p>Beneath the snow, the scenery was spring-like.</p><p>Looking outward, he could see the heavy snow swirling down, but no chill could be felt from within.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted, landing on a white-robed elder standing in a small pavilion among the mountains, looking towards him.  His expression subtly changed as he leaped down in front of the pavilion. “Greetings, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>This person’s cultivation was profound, his aura deep and unfathomable.  His cultivation was definitely no less than his avatar’s and was likely comparable to Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>Such a master was rare even in the Central Continent, yet he was secluded in this remote place.</p><p>Elder Yanshan returned the greeting, unabashedly sizing up Qin Sang and asking directly, “I already know your purpose. Sect Master Situ mentioned in his letter that Fellow Daoist is proficient in the Ice Dao and has come seeking Cold Crystals?  Could you let this old man witness your divine abilities?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know Elder Yanshan’s purpose, but since he had a request, he had to satisfy the other party.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Qin Sang chose to summon the Snow-Treading Divine Saber.</p><p>Seeing the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, Elder Yanshan’s eyes lit up. He pointed to the void above, “Fellow Daoist, feel free to make your move!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced upwards.  The Snow-Treading Divine Saber hummed, its tip tilting slightly upwards before abruptly unleashing a saber energy.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>As the saber energy erupted, snowflakes began to swirl around the pavilion, echoing the snowy scenery outside.</p><p>A snowy path extended straight towards the sky, merging with the blizzard.  It surprisingly didn't cause any disturbance to the surrounding environment.  Qin Sang's control was truly exquisite.</p><p>“Good! Good! Good!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan exclaimed three times, his eyes gleaming with an excited expression. “The Ice Dao’s inheritance is rare in the Central Continent. I dare say I understand seventy to eighty percent of it, and Fellow Daoist’s saber technique is so refined; it must be a superior inheritance, one this old man has never heard of before.”</p><p>“The Central Continent is so vast, how could Fellow Daoist know everything?”</p><p>Qin Sang took the initiative to speak, “If Fellow Daoist is interested, I can exchange some insights with you.”</p><p>He was still considering how to persuade Elder Yanshan to help him.</p><p>He truly didn't have many treasures to trade with.  Elder Yanshan, residing in the Northern Wilderness for so long, presumably wasn't interested in spirit stones. The Soul-Calming Incense would certainly work, but using it here would be a waste.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Soul Crystals only had value when encountered by specific individuals.</p><p>Elder Yanshan nodded repeatedly, saying, “There’s no rush for that. Since Fellow Daoist has come seeking Cold Crystals, are you aware of the difficulties involved?”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement, “Sect Master Situ mentioned that he and Fellow Daoist discovered these Cold Crystals while pursuing a strange snow fox.”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan said solemnly, “To be honest with Fellow Daoist, after Sect Master Situ left, I tried several times myself, but the snow fox escaped every time. I haven't been able to obtain any more Cold Crystals. I can't guarantee whether there are more Cold Crystals there, but one thing is certain: to find them, one must first capture the snow fox.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face took on a contemplative expression.  “Did the snow fox use illusion techniques to escape?  I happen to have a divine ability that can see through illusions.”</p><p>"It's rather embarrassing," Elder Yanshan sighed. "That snow fox is quite peculiar. Sect Master Situ and I couldn't figure out how it vanished from right under our noses. Even if it were an illusion technique, it would be the most advanced kind, impossible to counter with ordinary methods."</p><p>Hearing Elder Yanshan’s mysterious description,</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that the Northern Wilderness was truly bizarre.</p><p>Not only was there the mysterious Insect King of the Skycrack Valley, but also this strange snow fox that two top experts couldn't handle.</p><p>“If it were any other time, this old man wouldn't mind accompanying Fellow Daoist, but I’m currently at a crucial point in cultivating a divine ability. If Fellow Daoist isn’t completely confident, it's best not to waste your efforts."</p><p>Elder Yanshan's tone was solemn, clearly not optimistic about Qin Sang's chances.</p><p>“How will we know if we don’t try? Fellow Daoist should at least give me a chance to prove myself,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's confidence, Elder Yanshan became interested, "Fellow Daoist, please follow me.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Elder Yanshan to the mountain peak.</p><p>Elder Yanshan nodded to Qin Sang, then formed hand seals, striking upwards.  The seals flashed and vanished.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the protective formation around the mountain shifted dramatically.</p><p>Looking down from above at this moment,</p><p>The snowy scenery within the mountain vanished, revealing the true form of the protective formation.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt the power of the spirit formation converging around them.  He narrowed his eyes, glanced at Elder Yanshan, and also looked up at the sky.</p><p>Just at this moment, Elder Yanshan’s figure flickered and suddenly vanished.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s voice echoed from all directions, “This formation incorporates illusion techniques. This old man will use the spirit formation to conceal myself.  I believe there are very few in this world who can see through me. If Fellow Daoist can easily block this move of mine, this old man will personally accompany you on this trip.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath.  “It’s a deal!”</p><p>With that, he summoned the Snow-Treading Divine Saber once more, stroking the blade with his hand.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Divine Saber turned ethereal and vanished.  Snowflakes danced around Qin Sang, surrounded by saber energy.</p><p>When Qin Sang was ready, Elder Yanshan said, “Fellow Daoist, be careful!”</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Qin Sang heard the sound of crashing waves, finding himself surrounded by surging waves as if he had entered a vast ocean.</p>
