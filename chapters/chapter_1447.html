<h1>Chapter 1439 The Most Precious Treasure</h1><p>Chapter 1439 The Most Precious Treasure</p><p>A middle-aged man walked, taking ice mirrors from a pouch, without turning his head, he said: “This is how I create an ice key to sense the sacred object.  Those who do evil will surely meet their doom. If that fiend dies at someone else's hands and the sacred object falls into the wrong hands… if that person doesn't understand the sacred object, they might bring it to the Grand Demon Assembly.  Heh… then we'll get it effortlessly.”</p><p>The old woman sighed softly, “An ice demon's body isn't so easily destroyed.”</p><p>However, she didn't stop the middle-aged man.</p><p>After all, they had spent too much effort searching for the sacred object; every possibility had to be considered.</p><p>The old woman withdrew her gaze, falling into thought, considering how to ensure they caught the traitor without fail, and how to guard against the Old Demon Master.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Wanmo City.</p><p>In the misty mountains.</p><p>Inside a somewhat gloomy cave.</p><p>At this time, the cave door was wide open. A black-robed man with high cheekbones and a cold aura stood respectfully before the cave, looking at the figure seated with its back to him.</p><p>“Have you found the one who controls the demonic fire?”</p><p>The seated figure remained motionless, the Old Demon Master's voice echoing.</p><p>The voice was chilling, making the black-robed man's heart tighten.</p><p>His expression became even more respectful. “Master, we found no one wielding that demonic fire in the Boundless Sea.  I plan to expand the search to the Lunar Crescent Realm and other outer regions. Also, many cultivators from the outer regions have come to the Grand Demon Assembly, and I am trying to make contact with them to gather information.”</p><p>An unsettling silence filled the cave.</p><p>Just as the black-robed man felt uneasy, the Old Demon Master finally spoke, “Has the Hundred Flowers Valley Master made any unusual moves?”</p><p>The black-robed man thought for a moment before replying, “My junior brother has sent people to secretly monitor Hundred Flowers Valley.  They found that after the Valley Master returned, she completely sealed off the valley, and no one has entered or left since. However, because Hundred Flowers Valley is located in the Black Swamp, a remote area, it's hard to conceal activities. Those junior disciples have low cultivation, and dare not get too close. My junior brother will go there personally after the Grand Demon Assembly.”</p><p>The Old Demon Master's voice softened slightly. “Forget it, you don't need to spend more effort on this person. Leave a few people to monitor Hundred Flowers Valley's movements.  This person went to great lengths to seize the treasure, using that black spiritual fire to shroud themselves and block my perception.  It might not be that person… heh, being so secretive, it might be a familiar face.”</p><p>The black-robed man lifted his eyelids slightly and pondered, “The Feather Robe Monarch suspects it was the Ghost General, or someone from Bamboo Court.”</p><p>The Ghost General was a powerful figure in the demonic path in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>It is said he was a general in the mortal world, hence his strange title.</p><p>He was skilled in creating puppets, using the bodies and nascent souls of cultivators as materials. His actions were ruthless, leaving his enemies neither dead nor alive, making him second only to the Old Demon Master in notoriety.</p><p>Bamboo Court was the most famous sect in the North Sea specializing in puppetry.  They belonged to the righteous path, with their disciples mostly using puppets as a cover, while keeping themselves hidden.</p><p>Their puppets were realistic enough to deceive anyone, making them incredibly mysterious.</p><p>The Old Demon Master thought of the puppet that had stolen the Seven-Story Pagoda from the Buddha Hall, and hummed, “Puppets comparable to mid-Nascent Soul cultivators are rare.  The Feather Robe Monarch's guess isn't unreasonable.  But it was just two artifacts. Since he didn't take the spiritual treasure, there's no need to investigate further. You have more important matters.  Little did he know, the most precious treasure on the altar was the one he left behind?”</p><p>Saying this, the Old Demon Master stroked the Lingzhi Ruyi in his hand, his tone laced with sarcasm.</p><p>After Qin Sang escaped.</p><p>The Old Demon Master and the Feather Robe Monarch divided the remaining treasures in the Buddha Hall, with the Lingzhi Ruyi undoubtedly falling into the Old Demon Master’s hands.</p><p>The black-robed man listened carefully, curious about what this remaining treasure was and why it was so precious.</p><p>But the Old Demon Master showed no intention of explaining, and he dared not ask.</p><p>Hearing the Old Demon Master mention more important matters, the black-robed man was startled, then remembered something and said excitedly, “Master, you mean Huanglongshi's cave?  You found it?”</p><p>The Old Demon Master's deal with the Xuan Tian Palace was not hidden from him.</p><p>He knew that the Old Demon Master had obtained an important relic of Huanglongshi from Xuan Tian Palace, which pointed to Huanglongshi's cave.</p><p>The Old Demon Master scoffed, “Xuan Tian Palace, just like you, thought that Huanglongshi's cave would be of great interest to me.”</p><p>"Heh heh..."</p><p>After a pause, the old man, Hun Mo, said calmly, "Unbeknownst to them, my true purpose is hidden in another inconspicuous condition. Otherwise, why would I have agreed so readily without asking any questions? I've largely confirmed a previous guess, but some things still need verification. Focus your efforts and secretly monitor the Xuan Tian Palace people's movements in Wan Mo City. I want to see what they're up to..."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>The man in black robes bowed respectfully and left the cave.</p><p>The cave silently closed, swallowed by darkness.</p><p>After a long silence, an almost inaudible sigh echoed in the darkness.</p><p>"Transformation Deity..."</p><p>...</p><p>Wan Mo City.</p><p>Nightfall.</p><p>The first day of the conference ended perfectly.</p><p>Several auctions were spectacular.</p><p>As soon as it finished, the complete list of treasures spread throughout Wan Mo City.</p><p>Lower-level cultivators stared at the list, their eyes glued to one alluring treasure after another, regretting their lack of spirit stones, helplessly watching the treasures fall into others' hands.</p><p>The flow of people before Wan Mo City gate was like a river. Some left satisfied, others entered with hope.</p><p>Tan Hao walked out of the wooden building.</p><p>Recalling his recent lavish spending and the treasures in his pouch, he became more vigilant. He discreetly observed his surroundings before leaving.</p><p>Confirming no one was following him, he breathed a sigh of relief, realizing he'd been slightly overreacting.  After all, the treasures he'd bought, while valuable, weren't enough to tempt a Yuan Ying cultivator to risk their life.</p><p>However, that might not be the case in the final days.</p><p>The Ascending Spirit Ceremony required an enormous number of spirit materials, a vast variety, all of considerable value, especially the three most important ones, all rare treasures.</p><p>Fortunately, these three would most likely not appear at the auction.</p><p>Back in his rented cave, Tan Hao rested briefly before resuming his work.</p><p>For the next few days, Tan Hao had no respite.</p><p>He frequently shuttled between the trading and auction halls. The spirit stones in his pouch flowed out like water, but were gradually replenished in another form.</p><p>The Wan Mo Conference lasted until noon on the ninth day.</p><p>Tan Hao, in new disguise, appeared before the Wan Mo City gate.</p><p>His luck was good; the auction he attended had allowed him to gather everything Qin Sang required. After inquiring about the afternoon's auction and finding nothing suitable, he decided to leave the island immediately.</p><p>Carrying so many treasures was really stressful.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed inwardly, strode out of Wan Mo City. Seeing guards flying around the island from time to time, he felt slightly reassured.  He changed direction several times and quietly left from the southern part of Hun Mo Island.</p><p>After leaving the island, regardless of whether he was being followed, Tan Hao activated a transmission talisman to inform Qin Sang and then vanished into the air.</p>
