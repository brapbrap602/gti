<h1>Chapter 308 | Dividing the spoils</h1><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Luo Xingnan fought desperately, no longer stingy with the might of the talisman treasure, the silver blade gleamed, and in the air, a spectacular silver glow several meters long suddenly opened up.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had a flood dragon essence appear on him, his speed also skyrocketed, his figure suddenly twisted, and he narrowly dodged this surprise attack, groaned, and his body flew out at an angle.</p><p>His hand clasped his right chest, stained with blood.</p><p>Qin Sang used his body as bait, and with the help of the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, he dodged the silver drop's sure-kill attack at the last moment, but his right chest was still grazed by the blade's glow, causing a serious injury.</p><p>Fortunately, the secret talisman's speed was fast enough to avoid any vital damage.</p><p>However, an injury is always better than death.</p><p>上官 Lifeng is inside the Ten Directions Yama Formation, his vision is completely blocked by the ghost energy, and Qin Sang is using the identity of Daoist Qingfeng, even if he discovers the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, he doesn't need to worry too much.</p><p>The silver blade's surprise attack failed, the blade's glow trembled slightly, and it was about to continue chasing Qin Shang, but in mid-air it suddenly turned back into a piece of talisman paper and floated down.</p><p>The talisman paper was covered with cracks, only slightly better than the state of the previous Jade Ruyi talisman treasure, and it looked like it could only be used once or twice at most.</p><p>Luo Xingnan had the silver blade talisman treasure for a short time, once the talisman treasure's power was exhausted, it could not be replenished, although he had been using it sparingly, it was almost exhausted.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual power to wrap up the talisman treasure, hurriedly sealed the wound, and swept to the front of the Ten Directions Yama Formation, catching上官 Lifeng who was falling because of exhaustion.</p><p>At the same time, the main soul of the Yama Banner also carried Luo Xingnan's body over, ran over to him with an ingratiating expression.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's body was covered in knife and sword wounds, his heart was shattered by sword energy, and he died instantly, but even after his death, his eyes were still wide open, unable to close, as if he couldn't believe he would die here.</p><p>The Sea of Qi wasn't damaged, so it could still be made into a Corpse of Evil.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly, tidied up Luo Xingnan's body a little, and put it into his Mustard Seed Pouch.</p><p>According to the《Heavenly Yin Corpse Art》, the strength of a Corpse of Evil was closely related to the strength of the cultivator during their lifetime, the Corpse of Evil made from the body of a Foundation Establishment中期 cultivator would be a lot stronger than the previous Corpse of Evil.</p><p>Thinking back to the battle just now, Qin Sang's heart was still pounding nervously, although he was 80% sure, it was still very dangerous when he actually did it.</p><p>Luo Xingnan also had a talisman treasure, and he had seen himself using the Jade Ruyi talisman treasure, so he must have been on guard, it was impossible to kill him with just the talisman treasure or the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>If he used both, his spiritual power would not be able to sustain it for too long, and it would be difficult to forcefully kill Luo Xingnan who was protected by the talisman treasure.</p><p>So Qin Sang set a strategy, and took a great risk, thankfully he succeeded.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately put away the Ten Directions Yama Banner, instead, he let the main soul return to the ghost banner, and then hid it.</p><p>上官 Lifeng looked at Qin Sang manipulating the Demonic Treasure, but didn't ask anything.</p><p>Sweeping back to the entrance of the cave, Qin Sang asked上官 Lifeng to recuperate, while he endured the pain in his body and hid at the entrance of the cave, vigilantly looking outside.</p><p>Some time passed, and it was calm.</p><p>"It seems that the White-clothed Scholar has left."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly, this man was indeed not greedy, otherwise he might have stayed and become a fisherman.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn't let him succeed.</p><p>This place wasn't suitable for staying for long, Qin Sang waved and summoned the Ten Directions Yama Banner back, turned around and swept into the cave, and found that the Drifting Wanderer was sitting cross-legged, although he was still very weak, he was much better than before.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang say this, Drifting Wanderer and上官 Lifeng also agreed, the three of them went against the common way, and flew straight into the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Just after they left.</p><p>In the cave, the worship hall suddenly shook and a burst of strange fluctuations came out.</p><p>The people in all parts of the cave sensed the fluctuations, and looked up at the mountain top, their expressions uncertain.</p><p>Immediately, a rainbow beam suddenly rushed out of the hall, followed by the roar of the Hook Snake.</p><p>Everyone knew that the worship hall had changed, this location was special, and its significance was extraordinary, if there was a strange treasure born, it would definitely be a remarkable existence.</p><p>In an instant, apart from the people who had already entered the Spirit Treasure Pavilion, everyone else rushed to the worship hall, countless streams of light like fireflies gathered on the mountain top, making it spectacular.</p><p>None of this had anything to do with Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>After leaving the Qiuhong Market Town, they found a secluded place, as all three were injured, this place was deep in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and was very dangerous, so they needed to recover quickly.</p><p>Among them, Qin Sang's injuries were the lightest, he swallowed a few Spirit Pills, sat down in meditation, and cultivated his techniques, before long, the effects of his injuries were no longer significant.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's most serious injury was his severed left arm. Other than that, he was mostly alright. His Qi Sea had been depleted, and it would take him about as long as Qin Sang to recover.</p><p>Only Youyouzi had been restoring his vitality for so long without showing any improvement. The price he had paid for activating the Flawless Pearl was much higher than Qin Sang had imagined.</p><p>Youyouzi opened his eyes. The fatigue in them had decreased slightly. He said helplessly, "I'm afraid I'll have to recuperate for a few years to make up for my losses. I won't be able to concoct Elixirs for you in the meantime. If I force myself, the success rate will be drastically reduced, which would be a waste of this Nine-Patterned Yellow Ginseng that was not easy to acquire."</p><p>"Senior, there's no need to be in a hurry..."</p><p>The damage to his foundation would not have much impact for the time being. It would not make much difference if he recovered a few years earlier or later.</p><p>Qin Sang said something and suddenly remembered something. He took out Ge Yuan and Luo Xingnan's storage rings and poured out the three Spirit Medicines inside. He placed them all out before him.</p><p>"Can any of these three Spirit Medicines be used to help you recover from your injuries?"</p><p>Youyouzi shook his head repeatedly. "How can I do that? I may not have seen it for myself, but you must have been in grave danger when you killed Luo Xingnan. A single wrong step could have been fatal. These were obtained through your desperate efforts. I cannot take them."</p><p>Qin Sang disagreed. "Without you severely injuring the Chimera and deterring the Twin Snakes, I would never have had the opportunity to fight Luo Xingnan to the death. I would have already lost my life to the monsters. Surely you don't want me to be ungrateful? Daoist Official Shangguan also contributed. Three Spirit Medicines is just enough for us to split evenly."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shangguan Lifeng did not hesitate in refusing to take the Spirit Medicines.</p><p>Qin Sang was amused. He had never expected that the thousand-year-old Spirit Medicines that innumerable cultivators fought over would be rejected by the three of them.</p><p>Qin Sang was satisfied with obtaining the Nine-Patterned Yellow Ginseng. Any more than that would be an unexpected bonus. He was not greedy enough to take all three Spirit Medicines for himself.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Youyouzi tried to refuse, but when he saw Qin Sang's determined expression, he relented. He pointed to the Jade Leaf Grass.</p><p>"This Jade Leaf Grass can be taken directly without being made into a pill. It has a thousand years of age. This grass is exceptionally rare. Its potency far exceeds ordinary Jade Leaf Grass. If all goes well, it will shorten my recovery time by at least two years."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded when he heard this. He closed the jade box containing the Jade Leaf Grass and handed it to Youyouzi.</p>
