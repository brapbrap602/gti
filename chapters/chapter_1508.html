<h1></h1><p>The aura of the tribulation lightning was exceptionally unique, imbued with the divine might of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>This was a pressure that instilled fear in all cultivators, and even amidst the incredibly chaotic energy storm, it remained distinctly perceptible.</p><p>Yin Changsheng felt it most acutely!</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The storm intensified, seemingly becoming even more violent due to the appearance of this tribulation lightning.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure soared into the sky, appearing and disappearing within the turbulent storm.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was not dead.</p><p>Previously, inside the ice coffin, Yin Changsheng, wearing a jade crown, had the appearance of a young man. Apart from being thinner and paler than a normal person, there was little difference, and he possessed an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>Now, however, his hair was disheveled, and he looked like a madman.</p><p>His entire body was emaciated, his flesh withered, and his veins protruded.</p><p>His facial features no longer resembled their original appearance, and his twisted expression was filled with a sense of madness, as if he had completely lost his reason.</p><p>His eyes were wide open, bloodshot, and he stared fixedly at the tribulation lightning, his gaze a mixture of fear, fury, hatred, and insanity!</p><p>"Damn heavens, you dare to obstruct my path to ascension!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng roared at the sky, his demonic aura shaking the heavens.</p><p>Summoning the Hanging Sword Tower to deal with Qin Sang, his mind became unstable, and demonic thoughts silently invaded Yin Changsheng, causing a drastic change in his temperament. He had already fallen to the demonic path.</p><p>Although the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's tribulation lightning was outwardly strong but inwardly weak, not reaching the power of true tribulation lightning, the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation it emitted was extremely close to the real thing.</p><p>In this situation, the frenzied Yin Changsheng could no longer distinguish between truth and falsehood, and mistook it for his own true Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>He had not hesitated to cultivate evil techniques, hiding in the ice coffin and enduring boundless cold and loneliness, all to avoid the tribulation, delay the Heavenly Tribulation, struggle against fate, and defy the heavens.</p><p>Now, just as his plans were about to come to fruition, the Heavenly Tribulation suddenly descended. How could Yin Changsheng not despair?</p><p>A lifetime of arduous cultivation.</p><p>Meticulous and elaborate schemes.</p><p>Everything had lost its meaning.</p><p>How could he not be enraged!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng let out an incomparably shrill cry.</p><p>Fear and rage completely overwhelmed his reason.</p><p>'Ding ding ding…'</p><p>The sound of the bells was still crisp and clear, but it now carried a hint of desolation, as if it had already foreseen the fate of its master and itself.</p><p>The Hanging Sword Tower flew back to its master's side, spinning rapidly. The nine suspended swords swayed ceaselessly, their radiant light even more dazzling than before, unleashing their final brilliance, and brazenly charging towards the tribulation lightning!</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>Yin Changsheng still had strength remaining!</p><p>Or rather, this was Yin Changsheng's true strength. Just now, while he was in the ice coffin, facing him and Tong Lingyu, he had been constantly distracted, maintaining the evil technique to avoid the tribulation.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was probably infinitely close to the Soul Transformation Stage.</p><p>This was the strength of a half-step Soul Transformation cultivator!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Like a night rain about to fall, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled. The richly colored sunset glow in the sky seemed about to be torn apart by the heavenly lightning, then swallowed by darkness.</p><p>However, this scene did not come to pass.</p><p>What happened next was beyond Yin Changsheng's expectations.</p><p>The tribulation lightning rushed into the radiant light and was immediately engulfed. It never emerged again, completely devoured by the light, without causing any disturbance.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was only at the mid-stage of its fourth transformation. No matter how powerful its lightning control ability was, it could not possibly be a match for the Hanging Sword Tower.</p><p>How could the Heavenly Tribulation be so weak?</p><p>Yin Changsheng's face was filled with bewilderment.</p><p>At this moment, Yin Changsheng's aura had been exposed!</p><p>…</p><p>The dome of the underground cavern was not solid, but rather an illusion formed by ancient restrictions.</p><p>From above, the underground cavern was actually a sinkhole on a giant peak, which itself was located on a floating mountain.</p><p>This place was barren, with exposed rocks, and extremely desolate.</p><p>The dome was only a part of the ancient restrictions.</p><p>Around the sinkhole, a dense fog persisted year-round, forming a thick barrier, sealing off this area and creating a forbidden zone. This fog was black, blending with the darkness of the sacred ground, making it difficult to detect with the naked eye.</p><p>At the edge of the black fog, a group of people were engaged in a fierce battle. Without exception, they were all cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>One side was led by Hall Master Yin of the Imperial Universe Hall, Shang Lu, and the cultivator surnamed Yue from the Heavenly Mountain lineage. The other side consisted of Hall Master Jiang of the Primal Zenith Hall, Elder Mei, and others.</p><p>The great battle in the sinkhole was blocked by the black fog of the ancient restrictions and did not affect the outside world.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace, torn apart by the conflict between the Palace Master and the Grand Elder, had no time to deal with the demonic invaders of the sacred ground, and had instead begun to fight among themselves.</p><p>These people were completely unaware of the situation inside, and did not know who had won between Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu.</p><p>With premeditation against the unprepared, Hall Master Yin, Shang Lu, and the others clearly had the upper hand, surrounding Hall Master Jiang and his group.</p><p>The black fog churned, and the light of treasures flashed repeatedly, in various colors, accompanied by continuous rumbling sounds. All sorts of magical treasures and divine abilities were unleashed in turn, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>Though from the same sect, they showed no mercy towards each other.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang and the others appeared to be in a sorry state, only able to form a circle and a battle formation, struggling to resist.</p><p>Seeing that victory was within their grasp.</p><p>Shang Lu laughed loudly and shouted fiercely, "Surrender now! Do you think that traitor Tong can survive under the Palace Master's power? You dared to collude with the traitor Tong and plot to murder the Palace Master, a heinous crime! If you abandon the darkness and embrace the light now, sincerely repent, the Palace Master, in a moment of compassion, might spare your lives."</p><p>Elder Mei said angrily, "Yin Changsheng is no longer the Palace Master he once was. You are aiding a tyrant, allowing him to harm the Grand Elder. The Profound Heaven Palace will be doomed!"</p><p>"Demonic words to confuse the masses!"</p><p>Shang Lu's expression darkened, and he flew into a rage.</p><p>Just then, he suddenly felt a tremor deep within his soul and abruptly looked up at the sky.</p><p>Almost at the same moment, the others also sensed the anomaly. They all looked up at the sky, felt the pressure from the Heavenly Dao, and the fear arising from within their hearts. Their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>"This is… the Heavenly Tribulation…"</p><p>A Nascent Soul Stage cultivator in his early stage said tremulously.</p><p>He had just formed his Nascent Soul not long ago and had a fresh memory of the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>What shocked him was that the Heavenly Tribulation was only just beginning to brew, yet the terrifying pressure it emitted had already far surpassed his own Heavenly Tribulation. He had no doubt that if the Heavenly Tribulation were aimed at him, he would instantly be reduced to ashes.</p><p>For a moment.</p><p>The battlefield fell silent. Everyone seemed to have forgotten to attack.</p><p>Their expressions were varied, and all sorts of thoughts flashed through their minds.</p><p>Shang Lu stared fixedly at the sky above, a fanatical smile appearing on his face. "Haha! Haha! The Heavenly Tribulation has descended! The Palace Master has finally broken through the bottleneck of the Soul Transformation Stage…"</p><p>Soul Transformation Stage!</p><p>These three words were like a heavy hammer, causing everyone's minds to shake violently.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei exchanged a glance. Neither of them had ever seen the Heavenly Tribulation of the Soul Transformation Stage, but they felt that things were not so simple.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the sacred ground.</p><p>Darkness enveloped everything. Only the floating mountains flickered with a faint, luminescent light, but compared to the vastness of the sacred ground and the turbulent dark currents, they seemed insignificant.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Deep within the sacred ground, a deafening explosion erupted from a floating mountain, followed by continuous thunder. Dark clouds, gathered from who knows where, covered the sky above the giant peak.</p><p>Fierce winds howled, and black fog churned on the giant peak.</p><p>All these anomalies occurred in an instant.</p><p>The Heavenly Might descended!</p><p>At this moment, the cultivators on the other floating mountains all felt it, and turned to look in this direction.</p><p>The souls of the lower-level cultivators trembled, and they were filled with panic, not understanding what was happening.</p>
