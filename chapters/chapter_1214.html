<h1>Chapter 1206: The Abyssal Ruins</h1><p>He carefully collected the decaying bones, treating them like precious treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was still unsatisfied, wanting to search for more clues here, to understand Tan Hao's whereabouts, and ideally find the mysterious person once and for all.</p><p>This cave, aside from the bone formation, held no other marks.</p><p>Qin Sang explored all the underwater peaks, yet found nothing.  The underwater restrictions seemed solely to seal this one person.</p><p>His search yielded nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang looked upward, "Let's check the surface.  If I'm not mistaken, this is the Abyssal Ruins..."</p><p>He activated his ebony sword for protection, suppressing its energy fluctuations to the minimum, remaining vigilant and cautiously rising to the surface.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A devastating storm greeted him.</p><p>Above the water, the sky was a murky gray.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself, surveying his surroundings. He found himself in what appeared to be a lake, the entire surface shrouded in dark, ominous clouds.</p><p>The interior of the cloud was like a chaotic void, completely blocking Qin Sang's vision and spiritual sense.</p><p>However, from here, he could sense the tremors more clearly. At the Heavenly Corpse Sect headquarters, it was as if there was a layer separating him, only the ripples of the tremors reaching him.</p><p>Now, he could feel the waves of tremors directly.</p><p>"Confirmed. It's the tremor from the Sinful God Palace. This is the inside of the Abyssal Ruins!"</p><p>Looking up at the dark clouds, Qin Sang realized they were actually powerful ancient restrictions.  While appearing dark, they were extremely dangerous, capable of consuming any intruder.</p><p>He then leaped into the storm, reaching the edge of the clouds and circling them, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>"So that's it. Each tremor from the Sinful God Palace impacts the ancient restrictions and seals of the clouds, creating weaknesses. The restrictive power here has been slowly dissipating. In recent centuries, the Purple Micro Palace has frequently appeared, and the Sinful God Palace must have also trembled frequently, significantly weakening the seal. In the Heavenly Corpse Sect's era, the seal was far stronger than it is now. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator like the Heavenly Corpse Sect's master might not have been able to break the seal."</p><p>Qin Sang understood why the Heavenly Corpse Sect couldn't rescue the mysterious person.</p><p>He flew in a circle, attempting to locate a weak point in the ancient restrictions, intending to pass through the dark clouds and enter the Abyssal Ruins!</p><p>This wasn't to find Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Tan Hao had returned to the Heavenly Corpse Sect headquarters after rescuing the mysterious person.  Although the power of the dark cloud restrictions was fading, it wasn't easy to pass through.</p><p>He wanted to enter the Abyssal Ruins himself.</p><p>Firstly, and most importantly, it was related to the fragments of the Killing Sword.</p><p>Upon forming his Nascent Soul, the Killing Sword's spirit communicated with him, instructing him to seek out other fragments. When he was close, the spirit could sense them and guide him.</p><p>Two fragments had been found, one in the Purple Micro Palace, the other in the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>There was clearly a deep connection between the Sinful God Palace and the Purple Micro Palace. Qin Sang speculated that the Sinful God Palace might also contain a fragment, like the Seven Killing Hall. But the Sinful God Palace was controlled by Sin Abyss cultivators, and the Three Realms were at war.  Infiltrating the Sinful God Palace secretly would require considerable effort.</p><p>However, the Killing Sword was shattered into many pieces, and they weren't necessarily all in places connected to the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>In the vast Northern Star Realm, among the various forbidden lands and secret realms, only the Ancient Immortal Battlefield could surpass the Abyssal Ruins. Since he couldn't enter the Sinful God Palace for the time being, he couldn't miss the opportunity to search the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>The Sin Abyss didn't know about this passage, but the ancient restrictions of the dark clouds were continuously weakening. Once it weakened to a certain point, it would certainly be discovered.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang sensed that the source of the tremors wasn't nearby, but far away.</p><p>The core of the Abyssal Ruins was undoubtedly where the Sinful God Palace was located—the most heavily guarded area of the Sin Abyss. Other places would be far less secure.</p><p>The tremors from the Sinful God Palace, sweeping across the entire Abyssal Ruins, creating immense chaos, provided perfect cover for his actions, making it the ideal time for infiltration.</p><p>As long as he acted cautiously and with the timely warnings of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, the chances of discovery would be minimal.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the dark clouds, searching for a weak point in the ancient restrictions, finally selecting a spot.</p><p>He stored the Twelve Demon Banners in his sleeve and activated the ebony sword, preparing to break the restriction with all his might.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings fluttering as it diligently searched for a weak point in the ancient restrictions. Its Sky-Eye ability would be at its peak here.</p><p>Its wings shimmered, emitting Sky-Eye light and faint flashes of lightning.</p><p>Actually, after breaking through its fourth transformation, Tianmudie not only understands the Tianmu Divine Light, but also has the power to protect itself. The thunder it commands contains a trace of the true meaning of tribulation thunder, its power is not to be underestimated.</p><p>However, Qin Sang habitually protects her, trying to prevent her from directly facing opponents. This is also to avoid being noticed by those with ulterior motives who might discover Tianmudie's ability to absorb tribulation thunder.</p><p>Tianmudie itself is still very fragile. If anything were to happen, Qin Sang would deeply regret it.</p><p>Sword energy surrounds Tianmudie, forming a thick, impenetrable barrier. Tianmudie can feel the master's care for her; the emotions transmitted are not only close but also include affection and filial piety.</p><p>The person and the butterfly work together to break the barrier.</p><p>They quickly found a flaw in the ancient barrier, like a crack, piercing into the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p>However, affected by the shockwaves from the Zuishen Palace, the ancient barrier was unstable, and the crack appeared and disappeared intermittently. Qin Sang observed for a long time, searching for patterns, and confirming that the danger was minimal, then he flickered and entered the crack.</p><p>The Wumu Sword hung above his head, the sword energy like flowing tassels protecting his body. Each swing would slash out a sword light, continuously striking the dark clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't act randomly. The sword lights struck the key points of the ancient barrier. As Qin Sang and Tianmudie became more familiar with the barrier, they followed the flaws, peeling away layer by layer, opening a passage, and their figures disappeared into the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p>"The dark clouds are far thicker than I imagined..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, this thought flashed through his mind, and he continued to work diligently.</p><p>After breaking countless restrictions, the dark clouds ahead finally thinned. He sped up, the Wumu Sword instantly slashing out dozens of sword lights, finally splitting open the dark clouds!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang burst out of the dark clouds. Just as a shockwave arrived, he immediately felt immense pressure pressing down on him.</p><p>The Wumu Sword trembled slightly, helping him dissipate the impact.</p><p>Behind the dark clouds was an unknown land.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and found it incredibly barren. Outside, dark clouds connected to other dark clouds, ancient barriers everywhere, a boundless sea of gray clouds.</p><p>Between the clouds, the shadows of mountain peaks appeared and disappeared, the same color as the dark clouds. The Abyssal Ruins resembled an abandoned wasteland, dark and silent.</p><p>"This is the Abyss of Sins. Unlike the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, its danger is second only to the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield where space is shattered. However, this terrain makes it easier to conceal my aura. The shockwaves from the Zuishen Palace will continue for a long time; I can search slowly."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed the surrounding environment and entered the gap between two clumps of dark clouds.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Feeling like this isn't working, I tried going to bed early yesterday.</p><p>I feel great today, haven't felt this good in a long time. I shouldn't need a nap at noon, and I should be able to finish the second chapter.</p><p>Hopefully, I can adjust and reverse my sleep schedule.</p>
