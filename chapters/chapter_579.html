<h1>Chapter 572: Immortal Graves</h1><p>This provided an additional escape route.</p><p>The competition for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was directly related to his path to immortality, leaving him originally with no room to retreat.</p><p>His opponent was a Core Formation demon, possibly even stronger. Qin Sang was prepared to fight to the death and would not yield unless all his trump cards were exhausted and he was forced into a desperate situation.</p><p>Now, with the Nascent Soul reward as a safety net, he could retreat at any time if the situation became unfavorable.</p><p>A heavy weight lifted from Qin Sang's heart, and he felt much more at ease.</p><p>While Qin Sang was lost in thought,</p><p>Lord Dongyang and Chen Yan were also conversing secretly.</p><p>"Daoist Dongyun didn't recognize your true identity.  Before your master disappeared, I had no interaction with him. Unless someone is familiar with you or your master, they shouldn't connect you so quickly to the Qi Refining stage little girl from over two hundred years ago. After all, achieving Nascent Soul in just two centuries is simply too astonishing."</p><p>Chen Yan said, "Master traveled thousands of miles to the Small Cold Realm for the Violet Firmament Palace.  He originally planned to explore the palace and return to our sect, not wanting to get too involved with the local powers, so he didn't introduce me to many people.  They've likely only seen me once at most."</p><p>Lord Dongyang responded with a hum, "That's good. As long as your identity isn't exposed before the treasure hunt in the Celestial Mountains, we have a decent chance. However, there's something I'm not sure whether I should say... Before your master, others have been trapped in the Celestial Mountains, and without exception, they all vanished completely. There must be dangers we're unaware of in the depths of those mountains. Although your master's cultivation is exceptional, being trapped for two hundred years..."</p><p>"My master is a late-stage great cultivator! He'll be fine!"</p><p>Chen Yan's tone suddenly became very agitated.</p><p>Lord Dongyang quickly reassured her.</p><p>"I'm not saying your master has no chance of escape, but you must be prepared for the worst.</p><p>"I haven't inquired about your sect before. You were still young when you arrived in the Small Cold Realm.  Considering you're less than three hundred years old, you've spent over two hundred years at Mount Shaohua. We've developed a bond.</p><p>"If your master can't be rescued, what are your plans? Do you intend to stay at Mount Shaohua or return to your sect?"</p><p>Before Chen Yan could answer, Lord Dongyang added, "You're already a Nascent Soul cultivator, and so young. You might even have a chance to reach late-stage Nascent Soul or even the legendary Deity Transformation stage.  You'll be welcomed anywhere.</p><p>"If you're willing to stay at Mount Shaohua, I'll welcome you with open arms and hand over the entire sect to you.  There's no promising talent among the younger generation of Mount Shaohua, and you could become our next ancestor.</p><p>"If this trip yields no results, and my next heavenly tribulation comes, I have less than a 10% chance of survival. I likely won't live to see the next opening of the Violet Firmament Palace.</p><p>"Although great chaos is approaching, there are opportunities amidst the crisis.</p><p>"However, I worry that someone in your sect cares about you and is searching for you.</p><p>"Judging by your master's demeanor, your sect's strength likely far surpasses our imagination. If they come looking for you, I'm powerless to stop them."</p><p>Chen Yan was silent for a moment, then said indifferently, "Don't worry.  While Master and I don't have many close relations in our sect, we have no mortal enemies either. At least, it won't implicate Mount Shaohua. They'd be happy we're gone, not searching for us. I can't make a decision now. I'll return to my sect eventually, but not now."</p><p>...</p><p>The exit of the stone hall led to a cliff.</p><p>The entire mountain seemed to have been sliced from top to bottom by a sharp blade, smooth as a mirror.</p><p>Ahead, grayish-white fog filled the air, limiting visibility to only a few meters. Within the depths of the fog, shadowy figures flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized these as Yinç…ž Qi (Yin Sha Qi).</p><p>Where the Yin Sha Qi was concentrated, the fog turned grayish-black, but it remained a chaotic blur, obscuring everything.</p><p>This grayish-white fog was more than just Yin Sha Qi.  A ghostly wind howled within it, like the cries of the damned, and ghostly figures seemed to move within its depths, creating an eerie atmosphere.</p><p>"Are those ghostly figures the spirits trapped here?"</p><p>Qin Sang became extremely vigilant.</p><p>Ghostly beings possessed strange and difficult-to-counter abilities.</p><p>He had encountered most of his ghostly encounters in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>However, those were born from blood Qi, more akin to demonic spirits than true ghosts, significantly different from these. The Violet Firmament Palace, despite being called an immortal palace, contained this ghost-fog shrouded area. The ghosts here were undoubtedly terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Lord Dongyang, usually relaxed, now wore a grave expression. He held a sword in one hand and a Vajra Ring-like magical treasure in the other.</p><p>The connection between this treasure and Lord Dongyang was clearly stronger, indicating the Vajra Ring was his true life-bound treasure, not the sword.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Lord Dongyang gestured, and the Vajra Ring flew above the five, emitting a bright light, shielding them beneath it.</p><p>Then, pointing to the chains on the cliff face, Lord Dongyang said, "Descend using these chains, and you'll reach an area called the Immortal Graves. It's filled with ghostly fog, countless malevolent spirits and resentful souls. It was already dangerous, but after consuming many cultivators who entered the Violet Firmament Palace, it's become even more treacherous. Some of these ghosts are incredibly powerful, even Nascent Soul cultivators are no match for them. Be extremely careful.  These ghosts excel at manipulating the mind, so stay focused and follow the guidance of my treasure.  Seal your senses if necessary."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>...</p><p>Dozens of thick iron chains, as thick as a man's thigh, hung from the cliff face, disappearing into the depths of the ghostly fog.  The wind caused them to clang against the cliff, echoing eerily.</p><p>Gripping the icy chains and descending, even with the protection of the Vajra Ring, a chilling cold seeped into their bones. No wonder the outer halls of the Violet Firmament Palace were said to be so perilous. Foundation Establishment cultivators entering would surely perish.</p><p>Without Lord Dongyang and Chen Yan, Qin Sang wouldn't have even survived the first trial against the Corpse Vultures.</p><p>This thought made him even more worried about Yun Youzi.</p><p>He had to face these trials alone to reach the inner halls. Qin Sang hoped he was sufficiently prepared.</p><p>Circulating his spiritual energy with all his might to ward off the cold, Qin Sang finally reached solid ground, nearly frozen stiff.</p><p>He took out a cold-dispelling medicinal pill and swallowed it, then turned to face the depths of the ghostly fog.</p><p>Ahead lay a barren plain. The ground was a dark, brownish color, making one wonder if it had been soaked in blood.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's gaze fixed. He saw a grave!</p><p>It was a low mound, like a small pile of earth, with a broken tombstone in front. The inscription on the tombstone was covered in countless claw marks, completely illegible.</p><p>A single tombstone and a lone grave, standing solitary in this ghostly realm for untold millennia.</p><p>No, there wasn't just one grave!</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously took a step forward. As his field of vision widened, he saw three more graves arranged neatly behind the first.</p><p>And beyond those, there were more!</p>
