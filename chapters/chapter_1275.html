<h1>Chapter 1267: Desperate Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1267: Desperate Battle</p><p>The clang of swords was deafening, inescapable.</p><p>A sword array formed from the ebony sword, the Seven Souls Killing Array, encircled the Blood Demon's avatar.</p><p>The avatar stood unyielding, the Blood Moon Wheel hovering above its head, blood-light flickering incessantly.  It was unaware that Qin Sang had already exhausted his Blood-秽 Divine Light, and remained cautiously wary in using his treasures.</p><p>A curtain of blood poured down from the Blood Moon Wheel, surrounding the avatar, rendering the sword-energy ineffective.</p><p>The Blood Demon avatar had previously experienced the power of the Seven Souls Sword Array, and now countered with some skill.</p><p>The sword array failed to break through.</p><p>Qin Sang altered his incantations, withdrawing the sword array. The ebony sword flew back to him, followed by a surging wave of Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire, like a ferocious dragon, charging forth.</p><p>Upon contact with the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire, the Blood Demon avatar felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>While Qin Sang's twelve magic banners and the infernal fire they summoned in the past were powerful, they paled in comparison to this.  The avatar felt a mortal threat!</p><p>Ye Lao Mo was a seasoned veteran of countless battles.</p><p>Within a few exchanges, the Blood Demon avatar perceived a slight clumsiness in Qin Sang’s control of the infernal fire, a lack of perfect mastery, indicating the fire wasn't yet fully refined.</p><p>As long as he exploited this opening, if he could just avoid being trapped by the infernal fire, he should be safe.</p><p>But he couldn't afford to retreat; doing so would cause even greater trouble for his true body.</p><p>A chill ran down the Blood Demon avatar's spine.</p><p>His only option was to fight to the death!</p><p>'Buzz… buzz…'</p><p>The Blood Moon Wheel, like the eye of a bloody sea, erupted with a torrent of blood-light.</p><p>Instantly, the area around the avatar transformed into a sea of blood. Its figure was hidden within the heart of this sea, layer upon layer of true blood light rising, accompanied by deafening roars.</p><p>Even the surrounding blood mist and the blood in the pool were drawn into the sea, their blood essence absorbed by the blood-light, amplifying its power.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily activated the magic banners. Eighteen banners shot up wildly, each reaching ten feet high, standing in the void, rapidly rotating around him.</p><p>Streams of infernal fire erupted, spreading out, black flames burning furiously across the sky, attaching themselves to the edge of the blood sea, incinerating the blood-light.</p><p>Gigantic waves surged from the blood sea, the infernal fire possessing the power to incinerate heaven and boil the sea.</p><p>The intensity of the battle instantly reached its peak, surpassing even that of the battle between Tong You Mo Jun and Tian Zheng Lao Ren.</p><p>Those witnessing the event turned their gazes.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo’s fame had long been established.  Even for a Blood Demon avatar, such power wasn't unexpected.</p><p>But this Ming Yue Yao Wang, how long had it been since its transformation?</p><p>First, it had slain a Yuan Ying cultivator in battle, then caused havoc in Yuanxu, escaping Ye Lao Mo’s clutches. These feats alone had already left cultivators of the same level awestruck and ashamed.</p><p>Now wielding the infernal fire, its power was astonishing, even overshadowing the Blood Demon avatar!</p><p>Reaching this level, each advancement was as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p>In just a few years, this demon had made incredible progress, suppressing the Blood Demon avatar—an unbelievable feat.</p><p>The spectators were astounded, secretly marvelling that Xiaohan Region had produced another legendary figure. In a few more years, he might even surpass Ye Lao Mo.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Where the infernal fire and the blood sea collided, waves of fire and blood shot into the sky, ultimately stopped by the ancient prohibitions of the blood pool; otherwise, the affected area would have been far greater.</p><p>The Blood Demon avatar was in a dire situation.</p><p>The eighteen magic banners were the most powerful treasures it had ever encountered.  It couldn't fathom where this youth obtained them.  Under the relentless assault of the infernal fire, the blood-light shattered, even the Blood Moon Wheel was struggling.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>The battle with Dong Yang Bo had demonstrated the power of the eighteen magic banners.</p><p>Had Dong Yang Bo not possessed a secret escape method, he would have been reduced to ashes by the infernal fire, a tragic end!</p><p>Although the Blood Demon avatar was powerful, it was still outmatched by the eighteen magic banners. Moreover, its goal was different from Dong Yang Bo's; it was single-mindedly blocking Qin Sang and confronting the infernal fire head-on.</p><p>Let's see how long it can hold out!</p><p>The main body of the Blood Moon Wheel violently trembled, enduring a terrible impact.</p><p>The Blood Demon avatar's fingers spun, rapidly forming hand seals. Blood essence surged within its body, blood-light condensing into strange symbols, flying towards the Blood Moon Wheel.  Supported by the avatar, the Blood Moon Wheel stabilized slightly, but this respite was short-lived, instability soon returning.</p><p>Seeing this, the Blood Demon avatar knew its plan had failed.</p><p>The infernal fire's power was too terrifying.  At this rate, before Qin Sang's true essence was depleted, the Blood Moon Wheel wouldn't be able to withstand it any longer.</p><p>After all, the Blood Demon avatar was just an avatar; its true body could only provide it with limited treasures.</p><p>The Blood-Chill Needle failed, and even the Blood Moon Wheel, refined for years, was no match for the demonic flames.  His other techniques were even less effective.</p><p>For the first time, he felt utterly outmatched.  He sighed inwardly, closed his eyes, and formed a strange hand seal.</p><p>The next moment, the blood demon avatar blazed with bloody light.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The blood demon avatar vanished, splitting into three blood shadows.  This was some kind of blood magic secret technique, similar to a demonic self-destruction technique, with a huge cost.  But the three blood shadows, working together and wielding the Blood Moon Wheel, managed to hold their ground against the demonic flames.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked.  Ye Laomo's methods were endless; even his mere avatar was so difficult to deal with.  He wondered how powerful the main body was and if his senior sister could withstand it.</p><p>Although anxious, he had no other choice. The Eighteen Demon Banners were his strongest technique. If even that couldn't repel the blood demon avatar, nothing else would work.</p><p>However, this self-destruction technique would surely drain his potential and inflict severe injury, unsustainable for long.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately poured all his spiritual sense and true energy into it, fully activating the Eighteen Demon Banners. The demonic flames surged relentlessly, crashing into the bloody light.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Qin Sang and the banners plunged into the demonic flames, charging forward.</p><p>Soon, the three blood shadows began to waver.  The blood demon avatar was still desperately resisting.</p><p>At that moment, the center of the blood pool churned.</p><p>With a loud *splash*, a figure burst from the water.</p><p>The sudden change caught everyone off guard, drawing all attention. It seemed the battle beneath the blood had concluded, but the victor remained unknown.</p><p>But upon seeing the figure's appearance, everyone was astonished.</p><p>It was a desiccated corpse with exposed, jade-like bones!</p><p>“Is this the ancient cultivator who survived? How bizarre!  To be alive like this! What about the three who went in? Were they…?”</p><p>They only saw the bones, but not Ye Laomo or the others, causing great alarm.  Ancient cultivators possessed unpredictable abilities.</p><p>The forces of the Sin Abyss had mobilized for two reasons: to open the seal and the blood gate, and to prevent being killed by the released ancient cultivator. They hadn’t expected interference from the Xiaohan region, leaving only Ye Laomo to enter the blood pool alone.</p><p>Had their worst fear come true?</p><p>Both sides were uneasy.</p><p>Several glows followed the bones, revealing the Five Directions Pagoda, the Yin-Yang Double Halberds, the Thunder-Thought Beads, and other magic treasures.</p><p>The treasures circled the bones, battling each other. The bones remained seated, motionless, allowing the treasures to fight amongst themselves, showing no sign of revival.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, but were even more puzzled.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I got home late yesterday; more to come.</p>
