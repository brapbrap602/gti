<h1>Chapter 975: The Cave Abode</h1><p>The storm zone was filled with chaotic spiritual energy.  Qin Sang channeled his true energy to protect Yuan Zhu’s divided soul from the storm’s onslaught.  They flew, one in front of the other, through the raging winds and waves, seeing nothing but the storm itself.  Without guidance, one would quickly succumb to despair and become lost in this place.</p><p>Yuan Zhu indicated the direction.  Qin Sang asked him many questions about the sea demons and their tribes. Yuan Zhu answered freely about some things, but hesitated when it came to the tribe’s true secrets.  After all, only the demon kings had betrayed them. Even so, the information Qin Sang gleaned from Yuan Zhu significantly deepened his understanding of the demon tribes.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>Yuan Zhu suddenly exclaimed softly, his eyes shining with joy. He had sensed his main body’s location.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately changed course, flying towards the direction Yuan Zhu indicated. After a time, he finally saw a faint white light flickering within the storm, quite noticeable against the dark, turbulent waters.  It was Yuan Zhu’s main body.</p><p>The white light was nearly extinguished, tossed about helplessly by the huge waves.  Yuan Zhu’s main body was extremely weak, near exhaustion. His presence was barely perceptible; he lacked even the strength to resist the waves, only managing to evade the grey whirlwinds with desperate maneuvers when they struck. Without rescue, Yuan Zhu would undoubtedly die.</p><p>The Jiao shadow spirit rushed towards its main body, Qin Sang quickly following on his sword.  Upon arriving, Qin Sang saw an ice coffin. Yuan Zhu’s eyes were closed, sealed within. His condition was terrible—skin torn, flesh exposed, his arm bones even visible.  The burning blood had not subsided. The flames originated from within him, burning from the inside out, spreading from his blood and marrow, ravaging his internal organs before bursting outward.</p><p>Whether it was a secret technique used by Yuan Zhu himself, or the suppressive effect of the ice coffin, the burning blood, though spreading throughout his body, was vastly weaker than before, only a thin layer remained.  The burning blood still clung to him like a malignant growth, incurable.</p><p>Yuan Zhu was very weak, but still alive. The divided soul merged with the main body.</p><p>Yuan Zhu slowly opened his eyes, saw Qin Sang, and tried to smile, failing, before weakly saying, “Forgive my sorry state, Friend Mingyue.”</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true energy to help the main body withstand the waves, saying, “Friend Yuan, my divided soul and I made a pact: I would save you, and in return you would guide me out of this storm. How are you? How can I save you?”</p><p>“I’ll live. I understand our agreement…”</p><p>Yuan Zhu fell silent for a moment, his eyes flickered, scanning his surroundings. He murmured sadly, “Friend, your safety doesn't surprise me.  However, Gu Heng and the others…  I fear the worst…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Even with your preparations, Friend, you only secured a sliver of hope. Unless Gu Heng and Friend Caiyi possess extraordinary treasures to suppress this evil fire, their chances of survival are minuscule.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu sighed softly. “Enough! Friend Mingyue, I have a way to expel this burning blood and restore my cultivation, but I need to avoid the storm’s interference and find a place for quiet cultivation. Please take me back to my cave abode.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Aren’t you worried about the location of your abode being exposed?”</p><p>“The ancient restrictions on my abode are quite unique. It took me considerable effort to gain control over them.  Even if you knew the location, without my guidance, you wouldn’t find it. You’ll see when we get there…”</p><p>Yuan Zhu’s expression remained unchanged, his tone calm.</p><p>“In that case, I’d like to see what a cave abode in the storm zone looks like.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed, a slight smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang then used his true energy to encase the ice coffin and flew towards the direction indicated by Yuan Zhu.  During the flight, the jade talisman remained unresponsive; whether this was due to his distance from the Seven Kill Hall or the Hall’s closure, he couldn’t tell.</p><p>After some time, Yuan Zhu spoke, instructing Qin Sang to stop. Qin Sang expected the cave abode to be on a small island, but found nothing around them—a vast expanse of empty sea, devoid of any sign of it. He secretly awakened the Heaven’s Eye Butterfly, but its celestial vision still detected nothing unusual.  </p><p>No wonder Yuan Zhu was so confident.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the ice coffin. Yuan Zhu’s lips moved, silently chanting an incantation.  The next moment, Qin Sang’s expression changed, as if sensing something, he suddenly looked down.  The sea was never still, hundred-foot waves capable of crushing anything.</p><p>At that moment, a strange ripple pulsed from the seabed.  Moments later, a milky-white pillar of light exploded from the water's surface, transforming into a luminous curtain that appeared at their feet.</p><p>Beneath the curtain, what seemed to be a fragment of a mountain was visible.</p><p>The mountaintop was exceptionally barren, devoid of vegetation, with jagged rocks strewn everywhere.  An ancient restriction, manifested as the curtain, had shielded this mountain fragment until this day.</p><p>The curtain trembled slightly, revealing a fissure. Qin Sang, using his celestial vision, confirmed the absence of any ambush. After a brief hesitation, he followed Yuan Zhu into the gap.</p><p>Instantly, the fissure sealed shut, and with a flicker, it disappeared back into the seabed, submerged within the raging waves.</p><p>Upon entering, the deafening storm vanished.</p><p>“The spiritual energy is quite thin…”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the environment and made a mental assessment.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings. The area was sizable; ahead lay a cave, presumably the entrance to the dwelling. Looking up, he saw thick, dark clouds floating above, a manifestation of the ancient restriction.</p><p>The ancient restriction blocked all chaos from the outside, creating a sanctuary-like atmosphere.</p><p>Yuan Zhu eagerly returned to his dwelling and said to Qin Sang, “Yuan needs to enter seclusion for a while to recover.  There are no other secrets here besides the dwelling. Please feel free to do as you wish.”</p><p>With that, Yuan Zhu activated the dwelling's restriction and entered.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  Seeing that Yuan Zhu had sealed the dwelling, he casually found a spot, used his sword to carve out a temporary cave, and set up several spirit arrays and restrictions for rest and recuperation while waiting for Yuan Zhu to emerge.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang took a walk around and found the area to be as desolate as Yuan Zhu had described.</p><p>“Finally out.”</p><p>Returning to his cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, silently reflecting.</p><p>Reviewing his recent encounter at the Seven Killing Hall, despite the considerable gains, he had consecutively faced three Yuan Ying-level masters, constantly walking a tightrope between life and death.  He felt a lingering sense of unease, relieved to have survived.</p><p>“I’ve managed to survive into this age.  But after escaping the demonic restriction, I nearly perished several times.”</p><p>Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, eyeing Qin Sang with disdain.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't acknowledge any fault on his part.</p><p>He took out a jade slip, recorded his knowledge of the Canglang Sea and various treasures, and handed it to Bai.  “For now, it can only stay here.  Recover your cultivation first, and see if this helps you recall anything.”</p><p>Bai grumblingly accepted it and retreated into another cave.</p><p>Silence returned to the space.</p>
