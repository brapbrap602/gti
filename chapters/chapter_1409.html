<h1>Chapter 1401: The Myriad Demons Assembly</h1><p>In the Northern Chen Realm.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators sometimes take the opportunity of alliances to exchange with each other, which counts as a small-scale trade fair.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had heard of a Myriad Demons Assembly gathering so many Nascent Soul experts, with a Great Cultivator in the late Nascent Soul stage personally presiding over it, and he was very interested.</p><p>"The list is just a small part of it, used to attract attention. Even if you don't see the treasure you want, it's best not to miss it. There won't be any harm, and at worst, it's an opportunity to communicate with fellow Daoists…"</p><p>Valley Master Mu kindly advised.</p><p>As they spoke.</p><p>The four of them flew through the seawater for a distance.</p><p>Just then, Valley Master Mu and the other two suddenly stopped, turned their heads, and looked at Qin Sang with a smile, all with expressions of watching a good show.</p><p>"Didn't Daoist Priest (Daozhang) feel anything unusual?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu asked with a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang felt baffled and looked around.</p><p>It was dim underwater.</p><p>The cold water flowed over the Protective Divine Aura (Huti Shengang), all of which truly existed.</p><p>Everything was normal.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly realized something and abruptly turned around to look behind him, surprised, "Is the entrance to the Net Sea Sect here?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu then solved the mystery, pointing behind them, the route they had come from, and said, "Daoist Priest (Daozhang) remembers what I said before? We just passed through the formation outside the Net Sea Sect, and now we are on the other side of the formation."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Hearing this.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils suddenly constricted as he stared fixedly behind him.</p><p>Although he was talking with Valley Master Mu and the others, he remained vigilant at all times, having awakened the Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) early on and secretly urging the Heaven's Eye Divine Power (Tianmu Shentong).</p><p>When they just passed through the formation, he and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) hadn't noticed anything at all.</p><p>The water behind them was clearly the same as everywhere else!</p><p>Valley Master Mu had briefly talked about his experiences during this time. Qin Sang didn't expect the Net Sea Sect's formation to be so strange. No wonder they hadn't been able to analyze the details of the formation until now.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's suspicious expression.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi chuckled, "Daoist Priest (Daozhang) doesn't need to find it strange. When you go back and shuttle back and forth a few times, and observe carefully, you will realize what's wrong. In our eyes, it's an ordinary area of water, and even when passing through the formation, it feels completely normal. But they are all illusions. In reality, the route we take doesn't match what we perceive. It's as if space has been shifted or folded here. If we hadn't discovered the anomaly in advance and known that this place was unusual, I wouldn't have realized it even if I passed through the formation."</p><p>Could it be a mustard seed space (Jiezi Kongjian)?</p><p>But even Nascent Soul cultivators only have a superficial understanding of space.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, refining a mustard seed bag (Jiezi Dai) is already the limit. How big would a mustard seed space (Jiezi Kongjian) have to be to serve as the location of an entire sect?</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed, "Daoist Friend (Daoyou) Qi, what kind of anomaly did you see at the beginning?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi pointed to the surface of the sea, "At that time, a beam of scarlet light shot into the sky. There wasn't an earth-shattering momentum, and it only existed for a very short time, dissipating in less than an incense stick (yizhu xiang) of time."</p><p>It was impossible to deduce anything from the anomaly.</p><p>At this time, Valley Master Mu suggested trying a few more times.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, first following the route he had come from, and then changed directions several times, going back and forth seven or eight times.</p><p>Just as the cultivator surnamed Qi had said.</p><p>No matter which direction he passed through, the result was the same.</p><p>He couldn't feel any fluctuations here, and the formation wouldn't attack intruders. If someone hadn't reminded him, Qin Sang would have certainly ignored it if he had passed by this place.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) to fully use its divine power (Shentong), but he didn't find any traces of the existence of an illusion formation (Huanzhen).</p><p>Valley Master Mu personally went over, allowing Qin Sang to observe from the outside.</p><p>Finally, he discovered that after Valley Master Mu went in, the space seemed to twist slightly, and he suddenly appeared in front. The process of 'teleportation (nuo yi)' was completely normal, and the person in the formation couldn't feel it.</p><p>After entering the formation, the teleportation (nuo yi) appeared without any warning, making it impossible for them to start.</p><p>The formation's range had boundaries. Viewed from above, it was roughly a large circular area, deeply hidden at the bottom of the sea, insignificant compared to the vast Emptiness Sea (Kongling Hai).</p><p>Unless someone deliberately passed by here and had a companion watching from the outside at all times, it would be almost impossible to notice.</p><p>What could be certain was that the purpose of the formation was to protect the secrets here.</p><p>That is, the entrance to the Net Sea Sect that Valley Master Mu mentioned.</p><p>"Daoist Priest (Daozhang) might as well summon the Fire Jade Centipede (Huoyu Wugong) to see if it can sense the Myriad Spirits Fruit (Wanling Guo)?" Valley Master Mu said expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and opened the mustard seed bag (Jiezi Dai).</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede (Huoyu Wugong) flew to Qin Sang's palm, lazily lying on his palm.</p><p>It had just taken a Fire Melting Pill (Huo Rong Dan) and was digesting the medicinal power.</p><p>Qin Sang tried it a few times with it, and as expected, the Fire Jade Centipede (Huoyu Wugong) didn't react at all. Valley Master Mu closely followed Qin Sang, and the two of them were teleported (nuo yi) out at the same time. Seeing this scene, disappointment appeared on his face.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, was distracted observing Valley Master Mu's expression.</p><p>Valley Master Mu, like him, had clear eyes and didn't show any signs of absentmindedness or enchantment. It seemed that the power of the formation wouldn't affect the Nascent Soul.</p><p>This also made Qin Sang feel very棘手 (jishou, thorny, troublesome).</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) and the Jade Buddha, his two biggest trump cards, were of no help in breaking the formation.</p><p>However, it was too early to draw conclusions. If he could activate the power of the formation and see the entire picture of the formation, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) would definitely have a chance to perform.</p><p>"What does Daoist Priest (Daozhang) mean?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, and said, "Give me three more days. If I can't think of a way to break the formation, then I will set up the Three Spirits Pan King Formation (San Ling Pan Wang Zhen)."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu nodded.</p><p>The three of them retreated to the side, leaving space for Qin Sang.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang was also helpless. He found Valley Master Mu and agreed to set up the Insect Formation.</p><p>Valley Master Mu and the others were overjoyed and immediately began to prepare the altar.</p><p>As agreed, Valley Master Mu first passed the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji) and the Three Spirits Pan King Formation (San Ling Pan Wang Zhen) secret technique to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Hiss! So many things to prepare!"</p><p>Qin Sang first looked at the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji) he had been longing for, and was immediately shocked by the spiritual objects required for the Spirit Ascension (Sheng Ling).</p><p>The list was densely packed with dozens of spiritual objects!</p><p>The Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji) could increase the realm of a spirit insect by one level out of thin air, so how could it be ordinary?</p><p>In the process of Spirit Ascension (Sheng Ling), the power that stimulates the potential of the spirit insect comes partly from the master and partly from external objects.</p><p>Fortunately, most of them are not at the level of rare treasures.</p><p>But there are also some that even Nascent Soul cultivators would have to put some thought into collecting, and may not be able to find them. Using the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji) to upgrade the Heaven's Eye Butterfly (Tianmu Die) is not as easy as he imagined!</p><p>"Hundred Flowers Valley (Baihua Gu) must have collected all the necessary items for the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji). I just don't know how much is left."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Valley Master Mu.</p><p>But he also understood that these spiritual objects must be reserved for the descendants of Hundred Flowers Valley (Baihua Gu), and it would probably be more difficult for Valley Master Mu to give them to him than to pass on the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji).</p><p>He remained calm and suppressed this thought.</p><p>He would try his best to collect them himself first. If he really couldn't find them, he would go to Hundred Flowers Valley (Baihua Gu) to trade for them.</p><p>Continue reading below.</p><p>Qin Sang roughly understood why Lan Jingsi said that the success rate of outsiders performing the Spirit Ascension Ritual (Sheng Ling Ji) on spirit insects was lower than that of Hundred Flowers Valley (Baihua Gu) disciples.</p><p>Because this is closely related to the natal insect gu (benming chong gu) secret technique!</p>
