<h1>Chapter 1421:  Planning</h1><p>It all depended on how much Tan Hao knew about Jing Hai Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang asked these questions, revealing his intentions.  Tan Hao was secretly surprised; he hadn't expected Qin Sang to dare to confront the Hun Mo Elder.  After hesitating, Tan Hao didn't try to dissuade him. He trusted Qin Sang; his current achievements weren't accidental.  He wouldn't act recklessly and seek death; otherwise, he'd already be a ghost in the Yin Sha Abyss.</p><p>Admittedly, Tan Hao also held a degree of hope that Qin Sang could help him recover a magical artifact, preventing him from returning empty-handed and watching his treasures fall into the hands of others.</p><p>"Where did you come in from?"  Qin Sang prioritized securing their escape route.</p><p>Without a word, Tan Hao led Qin Sang back to the cave dwelling. He groped the wall at the back of the cave. A clicking sound followed as the wall moved aside, revealing a stone staircase leading downwards.</p><p>A wave of intense heat washed over them. The entire Jing Hai Temple was enveloped in a fiery aura.</p><p>Tan Hao started descending.  Qin Sang left his Yuan Ying spirit puppet outside to monitor the Hun Mo Elder's movements before following Tan Hao into the passage.</p><p>The passage, which should have been cool, was now fiery red on both sides, as if about to melt. Fortunately, Buddhist restrictions on the walls supported the passage, preventing its collapse.</p><p>"This passage leads to several meditation halls," Tan Hao explained as they walked. "Originally, these were places with the most abundant spiritual energy, used by the temple's senior monks for seclusion and meditation. It was possible to leave the temple directly from here.  Elder Gui Mu discovered that this area was the weakest point in the spirit formation and broke through near the meditation halls."</p><p>After walking for a while, Qin Sang stopped Tan Hao. "Wait, where do these two paths lead?"</p><p>They had entered a small chamber, once a guard post for the meditation halls. A stone door behind the chamber led to the halls themselves. The front of the chamber had three identical passages, all leading back to the chamber but seemingly connecting to different areas.</p><p>"They lead to the Scripture Repository and the peak where the Golden Summit is located," Tan Hao, who was very familiar with the Temple, explained, pointing to the other two passages. "These three places are the core of Jing Hai Temple. The place we entered is not only the medicinal garden, but also the alchemy rooms, instrument rooms, and so on. The Scripture Repository was originally a wooden pagoda standing alongside the thirteen-story Buddha pagoda, but unfortunately it was destroyed in that incident. Only the base remains.  The exit of this passage is in the Buddha cave behind the two pagodas, and the restriction is still in place. When the Elder entered the pagoda, she didn't completely destroy its restrictions. If their attention is drawn to the pagoda, they shouldn't discover the passage for a while. The third passage leads directly to the Golden Summit, but its exit is also sealed by the Golden Summit's restrictions."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up as he looked towards the passage leading to the Golden Summit. "Could we use this passage to avoid the Hun Mo Elder and reach the Golden Summit?"</p><p>Tan Hao hesitated. "That's true, but the Golden Summit's restrictions are interconnected. If you break the restriction, they'll definitely notice.  Also, the passage runs close to the mountain pass. If breaking the restriction causes the seal to collapse and the fiery energy breaks through, the passage will be the first to be affected, and you'll be trapped inside."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, allowing Tan Hao to show him the exit.  He weighed his options.  The pagoda had already been visited by Gui Mu; there probably wouldn't be anything valuable left.  There were a few other places in Jing Hai Temple with some history; searching them might yield treasure, but certainly not as much as the Golden Summit. Tan Hao had intended to loot them all after he formed his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The magical artifacts on the Golden Summit were the most valuable. But this also meant that acquiring them would be the most difficult!</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang followed Tan Hao and saw the back door of the meditation hall; everything was normal.</p><p>"Almost forgot," Qin Sang asked, "Do you know what kind of magical artifacts are on the Golden Summit?"</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was truly interested in the Golden Summit, Tan Hao suppressed his urge to dissuade him and recalled, "Some artifacts are on the offering tables in front of the Buddha statues on the Golden Summit, others are scattered on the ground, near corpses. There are about seven or eight in total.  There's a pair of golden forks, a vajra, a jade sword about the size of a finger, an artifact like a protective amulet, a wish-granting pearl, a wooden Buddha niche, a flower basket, a Lingzhi Ruyi..."</p><p>He added, "There might be more treasures on the corpses or in places blocked by the Buddha statues. I can't see through the restrictions, so I don't know the function or grade of those artifacts; I can only guess."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that there were so many.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked, "Which one do you want?"</p><p>If the opportunity arose, Qin Sang wouldn't mind helping Tan Hao acquire one, as payment for intelligence.</p><p>"The Blessing Staff!"</p><p>Tan Hao answered without hesitation.</p><p>His progress in refining his natal treasure was lagging.  After forming his Nascent Soul, he lacked a powerful attack treasure. The Blessing Staff was his most desired and safest option.</p><p>Other Buddhist treasures might not suit him; some might even require a Buddhist cultivator to activate.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, took a deep breath, and said, "Let's go up!"</p><p>...</p><p>Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Five figures landed on a mountain peak, their gazes drawn to the Buddhist pagoda and its golden spire.</p><p>Among them, the Hun Mo Elder possessed the weakest aura, yet was the most feared and respected.</p><p>Chi Jie Zhenren stood beside Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>He kept fiddling with a ring on his finger, his eyes betraying excitement and anticipation.</p><p>On the other side of Hun Mo Elder stood a woman of elegant bearing.</p><p>She had a beautiful face but silver hair, making her age unreadable. She was also the only Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator among the five.</p><p>This woman's Dharma name was Yu Yi Yuanjun, the most powerful cultivator near Kong Ling Sea. She was known for keeping male consorts, but she didn't force anyone and was very selective.  Her reputation was far better than that of other devil cultivators; she was usually discreet and rarely left her secluded residence.</p><p>Chi Jie Zhenren, without showing it, glanced at Yu Yi Yuanjun, surprised to see this "demoness" had been alerted.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun's eyes were like water, her lips curved in a smile. She seemed to be observing the Jing Hai Sect, but her attention was actually focused on Hun Mo Elder, a hidden vigilance in her heart.</p><p>Behind the three stood two men, one tall and one short, both Nascent Soul early-stage cultivators.</p><p>The taller one stood behind Hun Mo Elder, appearing somewhat detached.</p><p>The other looked worried.</p><p>"The extent of the seal's damage seems worse than you described!  The uninvited guest you two mentioned doesn't seem to have entered yet,"</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun surveyed the surroundings, her voice alluring and captivating.</p><p>"Immortal Lady, don't be careless. This person is also a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator. We soul-searched his companion and learned that he seems to have a way to receive guidance within the spirit array. Unfortunately, soul-searching a Nascent Soul is not easy, and at the critical moment, he was desperately protected by someone surnamed Mu. We don't know what methods this person used,"</p><p>Chi Jie Zhenren cautioned, pausing before adding, "However, he is alone after all. With the five of us working together to break the array, it's only natural that we're faster."</p>
