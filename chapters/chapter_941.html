<h1>Chapter 933: Countless Ghost Claws</h1><p>Chapter 933: Countless Ghost Claws</p><p>“Unexpectedly, upon our reunion, not only can you see my true form, but your strength has also increased several times.”</p><p>The shadowy figure recoiled, swayed slightly, and revealed its form.</p><p>This face, once very familiar to Qin Sang, revealed its identity: the lost Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Yet, a strange voice emanated from its mouth, raspy and low, each syllable uttered with great effort, as if it hadn't spoken for a long time.</p><p>Previously, the Flying Night Rakshasa lacked independent consciousness; its expression was wooden, obeying only its master's commands, each action accompanied by bloodshed and slaughter.</p><p>Now, it had changed.</p><p>Although corpse energy still enveloped it, instantly revealing its nature as a cultivated corpse, its expression was far more lively than before.  Its black eyes flickered, fixing Qin Sang with an uncanny gaze.</p><p>It looked like a living person.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He knew this ghost creature had certainly developed sentience, but he hadn't expected its intelligence to be so high, indistinguishable from a normal human.</p><p>Was this its original state, or had the Flying Night Rakshasa's memories not completely vanished, merging with the ghost creature?</p><p>Even more shocking to Qin Sang was the fact that before it was taken, the Flying Night Rakshasa's cultivation was only equivalent to that of an early Nascent Soul cultivator.  Yet, the power it displayed in their brief clash was not inferior to his!</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang questioned coldly, but his actions remained unwavering. He summoned the ebony sword, his fingers lightly plucking at it.</p><p>The ebony sword spun rapidly in the air, countless sword energy and light bursting forth, forming a dazzling sword wheel that instantly annihilated the bone dust swirling in the air.</p><p>The sword wheel descended from the heavens, overwhelming all directions, suppressing the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>He would show no mercy to the ghost creature that had possessed the Flying Night Rakshasa. He decided to kill it quickly, preventing it from preparing and causing further complications.</p><p>A hint of confusion flickered across the Flying Night Rakshasa's face. It murmured, “Yes… who am I… I don't remember! My former name… seems to have a ‘Bai’ character… why don't you call me Bai?”</p><p>As it responded to Qin Sang, the sword wheel bloomed like a fantastic flower, reaching its peak brilliance.</p><p>Bai showed no fear in its eyes, slightly tilting its head to gaze at the sword wheel, extending its ghostly hand, seemingly slow but fast, suddenly transforming into countless shadowy claws.</p><p>In an instant, the bone dust between them vanished, the space cleaved in two.</p><p>One half was the majestic, indestructible sword wheel.</p><p>The other was pitch-black, filled with corpse energy, the outlines of the ghost claws almost invisible, yet it seemed as though countless claws filled the air, their momentum in no way inferior to the sword wheel.</p><p>“My flesh and bones decayed, I don't know when I'll be reduced to dust… my memories, like my primordial spirit, withered and decayed, leaving only this lone soul, trapped in this world… lost, yet persistent… for a nearly impossible obsession. Perhaps, after a thousand, ten thousand years, even my soul will completely vanish.  I must thank you for providing this body, giving me a glimmer of hope.”</p><p>Bai seemed more comfortable speaking, its speech faster, clearer, and smoother. It seemed keen to converse with Qin Sang, yet it also sounded like self-talk, its words enigmatic and baffling.</p><p>The ghost claws stirred the wind, multiplying into thousands, confronting the sword wheel's attack with extreme force.</p><p>The sword energy within the sword wheel flickered and extinguished, torn apart by the claws, just as claws were shattered by the sword energy.</p><p>However, the true sword energy, untouched by the claws, became even brighter and more dazzling, supporting the sword wheel's structure, incredibly sharp, shredding the claw shadows.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed continuously.</p><p>In an instant, the sword wheel shattered a third of the countless claw shadows.  Seeing this, Bai let out a cold snort.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Instantly, the claw shadows retracted, merging into Bai's arm.</p><p>The corpse energy receded, revealing its arm, black as obsidian. As its fingers moved, its knuckles clicked like metal colliding, as if truly forged from iron and stone.</p><p>The sword wheel was about to approach.</p><p>Bai's eyes moved, its palm closed slightly, suddenly striking towards the center of the sword wheel. A massive ghost claw shadow effortlessly tore through the sword energy, penetrating the sword wheel.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The power of this ghost claw shadow far surpassed the previous illusions. Not only was it not severed by the sword wheel, but it raged within, causing the sword wheel to falter and become unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He chanted an incantation, the sword wheel exploding with dazzling brilliance, its sword light transforming into a thick beam of light, shattering the ghost claw, striking towards Bai's true form with astonishing speed.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai's eyes narrowed, its figure retreating, but it was too slow. The beam engulfed it.</p><p>The beam of light, carrying the force of the whirling sword, surged outward before finally dissipating.  Several bone mountains behind Bai were pierced, leaving large holes in their structures.</p><p>*CLANG!*</p><p>The light beam vanished, revealing an unexpected sight.  Bai was unharmed, his arm still raised, a barrier of swirling corpse energy forming a sturdy shield before him, having somehow withstood the impact of the ebony sword itself.</p><p>The ebony sword trembled, its blade flickering, unable to penetrate the corpse energy.  Qin Sang, seeing this, sheathed the sword, her gaze fixing on Bai with newfound seriousness.</p><p>This was their first true exchange, neither gaining an advantage, yet neither seeming able to decisively defeat the other.</p><p>"You're strong," Bai said calmly, "but not strong enough to subdue me."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.  Her wings flared, and the Heavenly Corpse Coffin flew from her back, rapidly transforming in mid-air.  A series of sharp cracks echoed as the coffin's panels shifted, forming plates of armor that fused to her avatar's body, creating a suit of gleaming armor.</p><p>The next moment, the avatar's eyelids flickered, its eyes snapping open, a blood-red hue filled with madness and bloodlust, shocking to behold.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang, staring into her avatar's eyes, secretly activated a secret technique, forcefully suppressing the avatar's rebellious demonic thoughts.</p><p>The blood-red in the avatar's eyes gradually faded, and it stood silently behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the avatar's presence, a flicker of surprise crossed Bai's black eyes. His expression turned grave.  "Your methods are truly inexhaustible. You even have an external avatar whose strength rivals your own."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang looked deeply at Bai. He had instantly recognized the nature of the avatar.</p><p>"What about with him?"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, ordering her avatar to attack.</p><p>She and her external avatar, flanking Bai from both sides, launched a combined assault.  Qin Sang again unleashed the ebony sword, creating a whirling blade, its power increased by a third.</p><p>The external avatar, clad in its armor and wielding a blood-red sword, was equally aggressive.  This blood-red sword was surprisingly well-suited to the avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang had thoroughly examined the sword during its refinement, confirming no other person's mark.  Soul searching also revealed its origin; a young man surnamed Fang had unexpectedly obtained it; it was not a gift from the ancestor of Black Serpent Mountain.  Thus, she left it for her avatar's use.</p><p>The avatar's cultivation had reached the peak of the Core Formation stage, but only by wielding a top-tier magical weapon could it unleash its true potential.</p>
