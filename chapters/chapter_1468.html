<h1>Chapter 1460: The Grand Elder's Conditions (4k, Two-in-One)</h1><p>Chapter 1460: The Grand Elder's Conditions (4k, Two-in-One)</p><p>In the room.</p><p>Shi Xue sat restlessly, keeping company with an ice sculpture.</p><p>She worried that the unscrupulous man would be heartless and unappreciative, cruelly harming her sister.  She also worried her sister would fall prey to his sweet words and be taken away.</p><p>Amidst her anxious thoughts, a faint figure slowly appeared at the door.</p><p>"Sister!"</p><p>Shi Xue quickly stood up, hurrying forward to examine her sister, making sure she wasn't harmed.</p><p>Liuli's expression was unchanged from when she left, seemingly oblivious to Shi Xue's strange gaze. She softly asked, "When will the Grand Elder return?"</p><p>"Did you persuade that scoundrel to return the sacred artifact?"</p><p>Shi Xue was suspicious.</p><p>That arrogant, heartless fellow, could he be persuaded so easily?</p><p>Liuli said, "He wishes to speak with the Grand Elder."</p><p>"I knew it!"</p><p>Shi Xue snorted, "Elder Mei has already sent a message to the Grand Elder. It will be at least ten days before he arrives."</p><p>Liuli nodded, waved her hand to dispel the ice sculpture, and returned to her meditation cushion.</p><p>Shi Xue's gaze followed Liuli, her lips moving slightly as if she wanted to ask something but hesitated.</p><p>…</p><p>Mingzhu Island.</p><p>The Fire Chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat by the furnace, oblivious to the passage of time, not moving an inch.</p><p>The Fire Chamber was no longer intensely hot, nor as brightly lit as before.</p><p>In the furnace before him burned black flames, like a coiled black dragon—the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire.</p><p>Refining a top-grade magical artifact using the magic fire, even though Qin Sang had cultivated the first layer of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," was incredibly taxing; sweat beaded on his forehead.</p><p>At the heart of the magic fire, a golden liquid formed a perfect sphere.</p><p>The surface of the sphere was mottled, like patches of red clouds, the transformed Falling Phoenix Jade.</p><p>Among the red clouds, blue stars were scattered, the Blue Dot Gold.</p><p>Between the blue stars, silver threads connected them—the Celestial Crown Heavy Liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang had cast all three spiritual materials into the furnace, melting them together into the sword body. As time passed, the sphere stretched, revealing a sword shape; the red clouds, blue stars, and silver threads gradually merged with the spirit sword, their brilliance fading.</p><p>It looked like this:</p><p>The sword body shone with golden light, dotted with blue stars.</p><p>Red jade carved the sword hilt, outlined with silver threads.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang added another drop of Celestial Crown Heavy Liquid to the furnace.  Gripping his hand tightly, a layer of silver immediately coated the spirit sword, completely seeping in, truly a golden glow sinking, a silver light emerging.</p><p>Afterwards, the hilt and pommel melted, transforming into a three-inch blade without a handle, glittering with silver light.</p><p>Compared to the time he fought the Hunmo Elder, its form was completely different; there wasn't even a hint of the original Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, reached out, and the Golden Sinking Sword swam into his palm like a fish. Having used it for many years, and having personally crafted it, refinement was easy; he could control it as he wished.</p><p>"Finally, a top-grade magical artifact!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a breath, feeling a blood connection with the spirit sword.  He smiled.</p><p>Only then did he feel utterly exhausted. He left the Fire Chamber, returned to his cave abode, sat cross-legged in meditation to recover, and then summoned the Golden Sinking Sword to concentrate on its refinement.</p><p>The Grand Elder, upon learning the news, would certainly come immediately to demand the sacred artifact. Qin Sang seized the time, avoiding any future obstacles that might prevent him from using the sword array, reducing his strength instead of increasing it.</p><p>As Qin Sang anticipated, within two days, the new Golden Sinking Sword was as if an extension of his arm.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The spirit sword whizzed around him, appearing and disappearing, leaving trails of afterimages, weaving a sword net.</p><p>Qin Sang tried activating the Seven Souls Killing Array, practicing briefly. Although he had no opponent, he could sense the power was vastly superior, and he nodded silently.</p><p>Afterward.</p><p>He put away the spirit sword and took out a jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the "Seven Teacher Buddha Seal." Qin Sang was about to examine and comprehend this body-cultivation divine ability, when he sensed unusual fluctuations from a sound transmission talisman in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>"The Xuan Tian Palace Grand Elder has arrived,"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He took out the sound transmission talisman and crushed it, then left his cave and flew away from Mingzhu Island.</p><p>He had already chosen and prepared a location.  After flying south for a while, he found an uninhabited island, landed on the shore, faced east, and patiently waited.</p><p>Soon, two figures gracefully appeared on the horizon, like two descending fairies.</p><p>One was Liuli.</p><p>The other was a beautifully dressed woman in white, wearing a phoenix crown, with a dignified bearing, clearly someone of high status.</p><p>Qin Sang looked behind them, but saw no one else; only these two had come.</p><p>They also noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Liuli's lips moved slightly, whispering something inaudible.  The Grand Elder's eyes widened, bright and intense, their gaze carrying a certain oppressive weight.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, calmly meeting the Grand Elder's gaze.</p><p>A single glance was enough for Qin Sang to feel a degree of apprehension towards the Grand Elder, preventing any hint of condescension.</p><p>Nothing outwardly betrayed it.</p><p>The Grand Elder's aura was full, their injuries seemingly healed.</p><p>As for the sacred artifact, it was highly improbable that it would be left out in the open.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two women arrived. The Grand Elder quickly scanned the small island before landing on the shore.</p><p>"This place is desolate, we haven't prepared any celestial tea, please forgive us, Grand Elder."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, bowing politely.</p><p>"Daoist Qin is too kind."</p><p>The Grand Elder's voice was as clear as a young girl's, returning the bow. Their tone was quite amicable, yet subtly authoritative. "Grand Elder is a titular position within the sect, I wouldn't dare flaunt it outside. My surname is Tong, my given name is Lingyu. I've already learned of Daoist Qin's deeds from Elder Mei, Elder Lan, and Liuli, and I greatly admire them."</p><p>"Daoist Tong is too generous. I imagine the rumors are greatly exaggerated, I hardly deserve such praise!"</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed, then looked at Liuli, wondering what she'd told the Grand Elder. He nodded slightly, "These past few days, thank you, Immortal."</p><p>Liuli shook her head, remaining silent.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's gaze swept over the two, after a brief exchange of pleasantries, she didn't inquire about the sacred artifact, but instead brought up another matter, "That traitor, I presume Daoist Qin personally eliminated him.  On behalf of the Palace Master and all of Xuantian Palace, I offer my thanks."</p><p>Tong Lingyu then bowed deeply and formally. "I understand what transpired at the Wanmo Assembly. Elders Mei and Lan were careless in their considerations and actually attacked you to understand the situation. I wanted them to apologize in person, but feared it might be too abrupt and lead to misunderstandings. After we return to the mountain..."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly clicked his tongue. He had no desire to be showered with undeserved praise, and immediately interrupted Tong Lingyu, saying, "Before the Wanmo Assembly, I was unaware of that person's connection to Xuantian Palace, I had no grievances against him. Moreover, I was hunting a Rainbow Rat Demon King that day.  Unexpectedly, a human cultivator's spirit resided within the demon's body. It was purely coincidental."</p><p>"Rainbow Rat?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu and Liuli exchanged glances, a sudden understanding dawning on them.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat's lair was in the eastern region of the Demon Realm, and Xuantian Palace was quite familiar with it.  It was likely that the traitor, while being pursued, happened to be near the Rainbow Rat Demon King's territory.  Without Qin Sang needing to explain, they could guess the general sequence of events.</p><p>The traitor may have been lingering near the Demon Realm, entangled with the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Tong Lingyu seemed relieved, "Thankfully, the sacred artifact hasn't fallen into the hands of the demons."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang wasn't someone easily swayed by words, she stopped beating around the bush and directly addressed the sacred artifact. "Forgive my boldness, Liuli mentioned Daoist Qin's intention to return the artifact. I presume you haven't changed your mind in these past few days?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed, smiling, "If I had changed my mind, you two wouldn't be seeing me today!  Thankfully, Immortal Liuli persuaded me, and I realized the significance of this artifact. Xuantian Palace upholds the righteous path, suppressing the great demon saints in the north and controlling the chaotic flames of the Hunmo Elder in the south, thus maintaining stability in the cultivation world. We loose cultivators must avoid calamity. If I were to seize Xuantian Palace's sacred artifact, wouldn't I be inviting the wrath of both friend and foe?"</p><p>His words were righteous and grand.</p><p>Liuli kept glancing at him.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression faltered slightly. After a moment of silence, she said, "Daoist Qin's words are quite right. However, that traitor possessed considerable abilities. Daoist Qin, by eliminating him, certainly took great risks, and we cannot allow you to bear that burden alone."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, but looked expectantly at Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Liuli, then said, "I hear that Daoist Qin is quite interested in the Sacred Grounds and wishes to observe the ceremony. I can grant you permission."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could express his delight,</p><p>Tong Lingyu's tone abruptly changed, "But there needs to be a slight detour."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned; he knew it wouldn't be that simple.</p><p>This condition, seemingly requiring nothing from Xuantian Palace, was the easiest among all the options. Yet Qin Sang knew perfectly well that it was the hardest to accept.</p><p>"Why?" Qin Sang asked cautiously.</p><p>Tong Lingyu responded frankly, "The importance of the Sacred Grounds to a sect needs no explanation. Especially for Xuantian Palace, the Sacred Grounds are crucial to the fundamental cultivation methods of each branch, and cannot be jeopardized. Daoist Qin should understand how much each branch values the Sacred Grounds. On the day the Sacred Grounds open, with a powerful cultivator like yourself observing nearby, how could the various branches not be suspicious? This place is far from the Yinri Realm. By the time we return to the mountain, convene the various branches, and reach a consensus, Daoist Qin will likely be impatient."</p><p>Qin Sang fell into silent contemplation.</p><p>He had previously indirectly questioned Liuli about Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Such a dominant force, a behemoth controlling its own territory, must inevitably have internal factions and conflicts. The Palace Master and the Grand Elder couldn't ignore the wishes of various branches, and even had checks and balances between themselves.</p><p>He didn’t rashly agree.  “Daoist Tong, what’s your plan?”</p><p>“Simple!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed at Liuli. “Daoist Qin, if you don’t mind, you can become a guest elder of Listening Snow Tower.  Just play along with a plausible story. Before the Sacred Grounds open, I’ll find a reason to give you an opportunity to observe the ceremony, so you won't attract attention. Of course, during this period, you need to disguise yourself as someone else and not reveal your true strength.”</p><p>She just wanted to retrieve the sacred artifact as soon as possible to avoid further complications.</p><p>The artifact had been missing for so long.  Although they tried their best to suppress the news, turmoil arose within Xuan Tian Palace, and some people were starting to get restless. She was under immense pressure.</p><p>Tong Lingyu wasn’t worried that Qin Sang would cause trouble in the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>Firstly, she saw the deep connection between him and Liuli, and he would swear an oath before entering the Sacred Grounds.</p><p>Secondly, he wouldn’t truly enter the Sacred Grounds; the Palace Master would also appear that day.</p><p>“A guest elder of Listening Snow Tower?”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t averse to being a guest elder; it was just a nominal title anyway. He could enjoy some benefits beforehand, and whether he contributed later was entirely up to him.</p><p>However, he sensed something odd in Tong Lingyu's words.  “What’s the difference from being a guest elder of Xuan Tian Palace?”</p><p>Tong Lingyu explained, “Daoist Qin, you may not know this, but before joining Xuan Tian Palace, the various branches within were actually independent sects at the Hidden Sun Realm. Now that they are under one roof, they still maintain a degree of autonomy and can independently invite guest elders. If you only join Listening Snow Tower, it won't attract too much attention.”</p><p>Liuli interjected at the right moment, explaining the benefits of being a guest elder of Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Because it was a transaction, the benefits were given, but Qin Sang wasn’t required to take on any responsibilities for Listening Snow Tower – more of a guest than a guest elder.</p><p>Finally, Tong Lingyu added, “Daoist Qin, those supernatural powers you demonstrated earlier left a deep impression on Elder Mei and others; they’ve been talking about it endlessly.  … During this time, it's best to hold back and avoid using them.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Disguising his identity wasn't difficult.  Within Xuan Tian Palace, only the Grand Elder and the Palace Master's divine senses could match his; others, unless they possessed special abilities, would find it hard to see through his disguise.</p><p>Thunder escape, sword formations, thunder control, and demonic fire had all been revealed.</p><p>However, his skills didn’t end there.</p><p>He knew more than one sword technique. The Green Bamboo Sword Scripture was a top-tier sword scripture. The part Green Bamboo comprehended himself differed greatly from the  “Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen,” allowing for sufficient deception.</p><p>He only needed to use the Seven Souls Killing Formation against the Grand Elder and the Palace Master; there would be no need to hide at that point.</p><p>Furthermore, he also had the newly acquired Seven Masters Buddha Seal, which could be used to disguise himself as a physical cultivator.</p><p>If he could refine a Yuan Ying puppet into an external manifestation using the “Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture”, he could also impersonate a cultivator relying on an external manifestation.</p><p>At worst, he could just keep a low profile.</p><p>Speaking of Yuan Ying puppets, Qin Sang couldn’t help but recall the various pieces of information he had gathered through the Dan Ding Assembly these days.</p><p>After the Myriad Demons Conference, the Old Man of Mixed Demons chased a mysterious expert for three thousand miles but lost him.</p><p>This matter had spread throughout the Boundless Sea, becoming a legend.</p><p>Strangely, no further information was leaked. The details of the chase, and Qin Sang’s demonic fire, Yuan Ying puppet, and other abilities, had not been circulated externally.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace’s unwillingness to stir up trouble and their concealment were understandable.</p><p>Whether the Old Man of Mixed Demons felt it was a loss of face or had other plans, he did not widely publicize the matter.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. As long as he could achieve his goal, the process didn’t matter.</p><p>Tong Lingyu showed a pleased expression. “Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Qin. Besides this small matter, you can enter the treasure vault and choose three treasures!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu was extremely decisive.</p><p>Qin Sang was also quite surprised. He hadn’t expected the Grand Elder to be so generous and hesitantly asked, “Any treasure?”</p><p>Tong Lingyu’s lips curved into a slight smile. “Liuli mentioned that you are interested in refining an external manifestation. As long as you swear not to spread it, I will pass the Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture to you. However, the Kan Shen Pearls in the treasure vault are depleted, and we need to harvest new ones from the Sacred Grounds before giving them to you.  Of course, that counts as two!”</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the treasure vault wouldn't contain Xuan Tian Palace’s top-tier treasures, but the Kan Shen Pearls and the Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture were tempting enough.</p><p>“Daoist Tong, you’ve given me too many surprises, I can’t decide immediately!”</p><p>Qin Sang knew when to stop and didn’t try to push for more.</p><p>However, he hadn’t mentioned what he wanted most. “One more thing…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished, Tong Lingyu understood and said solemnly, “I’m sorry to disappoint you, both the Palace Master and I have heard of the Central Plains, but the palace doesn’t have a sea chart.”</p>
