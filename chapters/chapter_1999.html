<h1>Chapter 1990: Da Zhou</h1><p>A figure materialized from the mountains, approaching them.  It was a man, a cultivator of the Transformation God stage, who remained composed in the presence of Qin Sang and his companions.</p><p>"I am Chu Wenxuan.  Greetings, Master Ying…"</p><p>Chu Wenxuan greeted each of them individually, finally turning to Qin Sang.</p><p>"I am Qingfeng. I am here at the invitation of Daoist Gu Yun Shou to witness the ceremony," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Chu Wenxuan didn't ask further questions.  "I will arrange for you and your companions to rest at Gu Qing Peak. What do you think?"</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>They followed Chu Wenxuan, flying over the mountains to a verdant peak.</p><p>The mountains were similar in appearance, varying only slightly in vegetation.  The air was filled with spiritual energy, and the lush greenery was refreshing. It was hard to distinguish one peak from another.</p><p>It was likely a deliberate arrangement by the Ji Tian Sect to avoid discontent caused by perceived unequal treatment.</p><p>Their light faded, and they landed at the foot of the mountain, putting away their flying artifacts.</p><p>Near the summit stood several striking ancient trees.</p><p>Chu Wenxuan explained that each tree was a treasure garden, serving as a residence for honored guests.  Numerous large and small caves were scattered around each garden.</p><p>Gu Qing Peak had more than enough space for the various sects.</p><p>The gardens were much the same, so Qin Sang chose one at random. Since he had only brought Tai Yi and Yu Lang, he had them cultivate there as well.</p><p>Standing before the garden, Qin Sang activated a jade talisman.  The void before him warped, revealing the true form of the garden.</p><p>The tree canopy was like a canopy, and a wooden pavilion nestled amongst the branches. Upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the pavilion wasn't man-made; it was formed naturally by the twisting and growth of the tree's branches.</p><p>Hidden beneath the canopy, the pavilion was still visible.  Qin Sang ascended to the pavilion and gazed at the endless expanse of mountains.</p><p>Tai Yi and Yu Lang rested below.</p><p>Soon, the garden's barrier was triggered, and Tai Yi and Yu Lang came up. "Master, Daoist Yun Xi is outside and invites us to sightsee."</p><p>Several sects were to participate in the Ji Tian Ceremony, and Gu Yun Shou and the others needed to negotiate with the Ji Tian Sect to arrange the subsequent matters.</p><p>Qin Sang had nothing to do and was waiting for news from Gu Yun Shou.</p><p>This was an opportunity for Tai Yi and Yu Lang to broaden their horizons, so Qin Sang didn't stop them. He flicked a beam of lightning at Tai Yi's forehead, leaving a lightning mark.  This mark would conceal Tai Yi's true nature.</p><p>The Ji Tian Sect strictly forbade fighting between participants in the ceremony.  The righteous and demonic cultivators were housed separately.</p><p>Nobody wanted trouble at the Ji Tian Ceremony; it was generally safe, but unforeseen circumstances could still occur.</p><p>Tai Yi had a unique origin, achieving enlightenment through spirit talismans. Qin Sang didn't want him to attract unwanted attention. After his enchantment, even if someone noticed Tai Yi's unusual nature, they would only think he was a special type of demonic cultivator.</p><p>"Go."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. After the two left, he didn't begin his cultivation.  He sent a message to Gu Yun Shou and left the garden himself.</p><p>Peaks rose majestically, connected by vine bridges, forming a unique city.</p><p>Qin Sang followed a vine bridge away from Gu Qing Peak, hearing bursts of laughter along the way.</p><p>More flying artifacts continued to arrive, and the mountaintop became increasingly crowded, as people commented on various sects' flying artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't interested in joining them. He had inquired about the city's layout from Chu Wenxuan and planned to visit Lingbao Peak.</p><p>Lingbao Peak housed major trading houses.</p><p>After the ceremony, an auction would be held here, with rumors of treasures that might even attract Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang had secured a place through Gu Yun Shou, not to participate in the auction itself but to consult ancient texts and gather information about the cultivation world.</p><p>Lingbao Peak was the highest peak in the city, and highly visible.</p><p>It was surrounded by sheer cliffs, with ancient trees growing from the cliffs. Numerous "lanterns" hung from their crowns, some larger than houses.</p><p>These lanterns were jade-white, emitting a soft, elegant light.  Vine bridges of varying thicknesses connected the lanterns and peaks, forming a dense network.</p><p>These ancient trees were a special type of spiritual tree, and the "lanterns" were their blossoms.  The petals were incredibly hard and hollow inside. Cultivators carved these blossoms into pavilions and buildings, with intricately carved doors and windows.  Shops were built within these blossoms.</p><p>As twilight descended, the lanterns of Lingbao Peak swayed gently, creating a breathtaking scene.</p><p>Shortly, Qin Sang reached Lingbao Peak, crossing several bridges with a clear purpose.</p><p>Jin Shu Ge…</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>Jin Shu Ge sold various cultivation manuals and books, claiming they were all of the highest quality, hence the name.  Qin Sang wasn't there to buy cultivation techniques; he needed texts detailing the anecdotes and history of the immortal cultivation world, preferably ancient classics.</p><p>Inside the building, the furnishings were unremarkable.</p><p>A beautiful servant girl approached.  Learning Qin Sang's intentions, she led him to a quiet room, offering fragrant tea and a selection of jade slips and books.</p><p>Batch after batch of jade slips and books were brought in.  Qin Sang completely lost track of time, sifting through the materials, verifying the information's authenticity, and pondering the upcoming Ji Tian Conference.</p><p>His primary goal was naturally Xiao Dong Tian, but his role was limited; Gu Yun Sou would handle the operation.  A single Panlong Heavenly Pillar offered a roughly seventy percent chance of success, but absolute certainty was needed to avoid unexpected obstacles; every aspect required careful consideration.</p><p>Next was the Stellar Yuan Infusion.</p><p>Finding a Nascent Soul cultivator specializing in the Stellar Dao wouldn't be difficult if the right person could be found.  On his journey, Qin Sang had specifically inquired with Gu Yun Sou and the others; Yue Du Bay didn't have any sects or powerful cultivators renowned for their mastery of the Stellar Dao, so other options had to be explored.</p><p>Then there was gathering information about the immortal cultivation world and planning his future travels.</p><p>Upon first hearing the name "Yue Du Bay," Qin Sang had assumed it was a bay located on the edge of a landmass.</p><p>Further investigation revealed it to be an island, in the eyes of many.</p><p>This "island" was far larger than any continent in the Lesser Thousand Worlds!</p><p>Yet, within the Greater Thousand Worlds, Yue Du Bay was a negligible speck – an inconceivable notion for inhabitants of the Lesser Thousand Worlds.</p><p>It was called Yue Du Bay because its shape resembled a bay.  The eastern side of the island saw the sea receding into the land, with two peninsulas extending out from the edges, creating a bay-like formation.</p><p>Yun Du City was situated in the south of Yue Du Bay, a relatively barren region.</p><p>The most prosperous area was naturally where the Ji Tian Sect resided, roughly in the center of Yue Du Bay. Traveling directly east from the Ji Tian Sect would lead one to the bay.</p><p>The geographical location illustrated the Ji Tian Sect's influence extending north and south, with all sects within Yue Du Bay essentially beholden to their whims.</p><p>Beyond Yue Du Bay lay countless smaller islands, inhabited by both mortals and cultivators; numerous large and small sects existed, constituting the outer reaches of Yue Du Bay's cultivation world – ineligible to participate in the Ji Tian Conference.</p><p>Historically, the Ji Tian Sect hadn't demonstrated ambition for unifying Yue Du Bay, yet this didn't imply other sects could disregard the Ji Tian Sect and stir up trouble within the cultivation world.</p><p>The Ji Tian Conference was more of an alliance meeting, a display of the Ji Tian Sect's authority, and a balancing act of various interests.</p><p>Even before the conference, an undercurrent of conflict was palpable.</p><p>Beyond Yue Du Bay lay a boundless ocean, and other cultivation worlds existed nearby.</p><p>After Gu Yun Sou's breakthrough to the Nascent Soul realm, he traveled extensively, visiting Lu Song Island south of Yue Du Bay.</p><p>Eastward lay a place called Chen Yu Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Each of these cultivation worlds possessed strength and scale comparable to Yue Du Bay, separated by vast stretches of ocean. While connections existed, the immense distances, inherent dangers, demonic cultivators, and even the difficulties faced by even Transcending Divinity cultivators made travel exceedingly arduous.</p><p>Traveling with Sect Master Yu, Sect Master Ying, and others, they shared their experiences and generously provided various cartographic maps.</p><p>The maritime situation was ever-changing; after a period of seclusion, information on a map might become obsolete.  Relying solely on maps could be fatal.</p><p>The maps' purpose was to indicate directions and mark the locations of powerful forces.</p><p>A common feature of these maps was the more detailed description of the area north of Yue Du Bay compared to other regions.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that north of Yue Du Bay lay islands such as Qi Feng Island and Ji Tian Peak.</p><p>At the northernmost point recorded on the maps, only a small dot remained, making it impossible to determine the exact distance or the dangers involved, resulting in limited contact between Yue Du Bay and that area.</p><p>It was so far that land still hadn't been reached.</p><p>Qin Sang also noted a pattern:  westward from Yue Du Bay, the markings became increasingly sparse.</p><p>Upon inquiring with Gu Yun Sou, Qin Sang learned that Gu Yun Sou had been similarly curious and traveled west alone, discovering that the region grew increasingly desolate. Time constraints forced him to return before reaching his destination.</p><p>Most cultivators from Yue Du Bay traveled north, maintaining closer ties with the northern forces.</p><p>When Qin Sang first met Qing Yuan, he had asked for guidance on his location and how to reach Yu Jing Mountain.</p><p>Qing Yuan couldn't provide detailed directions but offered a general direction and a rough introduction to humanity.</p><p>Combining this information with recent rumors, Qin Sang gained a rudimentary understanding of humanity within the Greater Thousand Worlds.</p><p>The legends circulating in Yue Du Bay were mostly hearsay, but some aligned with Qing Yuan’s accounts.</p><p>Jade Kyng Mountain, the ancestral land of humankind and a sacred site, has always been the heart and soul of humanity.  There lies the celestial city Baiyu Kyng, the largest such city among humankind.</p><p>Baiyu Kyng is also the capital of Great Zhou!  It’s hard to believe, but humankind has a celestial kingdom, known as Great Zhou, existing since Jade Kyng Mountain became a sacred place.</p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou reigns over all humankind, residing in Baiyu Kyng and governing with benevolent wisdom.</p><p>While Qingyuan didn't provide much detail, it seems Great Zhou's rule isn't as strict as in the mortal realm.</p><p>Beyond Jade Kyng Mountain lies the eight great celestial states of humankind: Qian, Kun, Xun, Zhen, Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui, corresponding to the eight trigrams of the Bagua.</p><p>However, these states aren't arranged strictly according to the Bagua.</p><p>According to Qingyuan, the eight states are immensely far from Jade Kyng Mountain, separated by vast wilderness, like a chasm.  A typical cultivator might spend a lifetime in one state's capital without reaching another state or Baiyu Kyng.</p><p>The journey is fraught with unimaginable dangers; even Void Refinement cultivators wouldn't travel alone.</p><p>The eight states and Jade Kyng Mountain are connected by grand teleportation arrays.</p><p>Qin Sang only needs to reach the capital of any of the eight states to travel to Jade Kyng Mountain via these arrays.</p><p>Using the arrays is expensive and requires stringent conditions, but it's far easier than traversing the vast land.</p><p>Most of Jade Kyng Mountain and the eight states are located on the mainland.</p><p>According to Qingyuan, the nearest route to land from here is north.  If one doesn't lose their way, they'd likely land on the border of Gen State.</p><p>In the Bagua, Gen represents mountains, and Gen State has many unusual mountains—this is the only information Qin Sang knows.</p><p>Qingyuan didn't travel south from Gen State but came by sea from elsewhere, so he couldn't advise on a safe route.</p><p>One book after another was delivered and then removed.  Unknowingly, it was already dawn, with the sky gradually brightening outside.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his private chamber, continuously reading.</p><p>After finishing the books at the Jin Shu Pavilion, Qin Sang didn't leave immediately. He asked the shopkeeper to bring books from other shops.  During this time, Qin Sang also bought some cultivation techniques and secret arts that interested him.</p><p>At the Void Refinement stage, problems that can be solved with spirit stones are not problems.</p><p>As far as he knew, Void Refinement cultivators at a certain level could manipulate spiritual energy and even mold spirit stones.</p><p>The purity of a spirit stone depends on the cultivator's cultivation level and control over the world's primal energy.</p><p>His ability was still lacking; even if he forcefully created one, the spiritual energy would be impure, reducing its value and requiring considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that even at the peak of Void Refinement, forging a top-grade spirit stone would be difficult; he wondered if even those at the Unity stage could do it easily.</p><p>Therefore, only top-grade spirit stones are valuable to Void Refinement cultivators.  At this stage, there's no commonly accepted "currency."  Transactions are mostly bartering, relying entirely on one's discernment.</p><p>The restriction was triggered.</p><p>The manager sent another batch of books, followed by a servant girl carrying the finest spiritual tea.  They dared not disturb Qin Sang and quietly withdrew.</p><p>He couldn't remember which batch this was. The Jin Shu Pavilion readily fulfilled the demands of this generous patron.</p><p>To thoroughly understand the cultivation world near Yue Du Bay, he would definitely have to interact with Void Refinement cultivators; the information he would obtain from them would be the most reliable.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang found a considerable amount of useful information among these many books.</p><p>North of Yue Du Bay, islands are scattered like stars. The largest islands, comparable to Yue Du Bay itself, are generally occupied by top-tier forces.</p><p>Separated by the sea, unless under special circumstances, these dominant powers did not interfere with each other, coexisting peacefully.</p><p>For now, the cultivation world appears calm, without any signs of hidden currents.</p><p>Picking up the last jade slip, Qin Sang quickly scanned its contents. Finding nothing of note, he tossed it aside and opened the door.</p><p>The manager was waiting outside, a smile plastered on his face.  "Daoist Qin, have you finished reading? These are only this branch's collection. If you need more, I’ve already contacted headquarters. However, the headquarters’ collection involves rather… sensitive secrets, so…"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Get them here as soon as possible. I’ll collect them when the… matter… concludes."</p><p>"Yes, of course! Please go slowly!"</p><p>The manager's smile widened even further. He quickly stepped forward and personally escorted Qin Sang out.</p>
