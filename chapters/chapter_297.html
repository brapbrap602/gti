<h1>Chapter 290: The Trap</h1><p>“My men left no warning signs… Even if there were danger, Old Man Yu and his few companions made it through.  Could we really be trapped here? Stop being so paranoid! Old Man Yu has been inside for a while now; we can't afford to dawdle!”</p><p>With that, Luo Xingnan transformed into a streak of light, soaring through the air, followed closely by the others.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi shook his head helplessly. He felt there was some truth in Luo Xingnan’s words, but he still waved his hand, sending a surge of spiritual energy into the abyss. The spiritual energy pierced the Yin energy, causing a disturbance, but nothing else seemed amiss.</p><p>Seeing this, Sheng Yuanzi sped up to catch up.</p><p>The group quickly flew over the abyss.  As expected, there was nothing unusual inside; it remained calm.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi looked away, letting down his guard, and chuckled self-deprecatingly. But before the smile could fade from his face, he suddenly heard a faint hissing sound.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi’s smile froze, his face suddenly darkening.</p><p>Not only Sheng Yuanzi, but others heard it too. They looked around and quickly located the source of the sound—it was coming from the two low hills ahead of them.</p><p>Not far from the other side of the abyss stood two stone hills, like two gatekeepers of the wasteland.</p><p>The stone hills were bare, not particularly small, but compared to the distant mountains covered with spiritual herbs, they were insignificant and inconspicuous.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and the others had been focused on the abyss. After all, these two hills were completely exposed, and any unusual activity would be easily noticeable. Since there was nothing unusual in the abyss, no one expected the problem to lie with the hills.</p><p>The sound appeared abruptly, like the hiss of some monster.</p><p>The next moment, the ground suddenly trembled. The hissing sound intensified, echoing across the plains, and quickly threatened to pierce the sky.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a cloud of red mist erupted from each of the two hilltops, shooting high into the air.</p><p>There seemed to be a huge cave hidden within each summit.  The red mist appeared without warning, seemingly endless, instantly spreading out and covering half the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The two clouds of red mist converged between the hills, blocking their path.</p><p>“There are snakes inside!” someone shouted, pointing at the fog.</p><p>“Hook Snakes!”</p><p>At this point, everyone finally got a glimpse of what was hidden within the red mist.</p><p>The mist was formed by the breath of a serpentine demonic beast!</p><p>These snakes had a bizarre appearance, their bodies shaped like serpents, each at least several dozen feet long. However, unlike ordinary snakes, the Hook Snakes had forked tails, each ending in an iron hook that gleamed like dark metal, flashing with a cold light!</p><p>Because of their unique appearance, everyone recognized the Hook Snakes instantly and recalled the records about them.</p><p>These demonic beasts reached the peak of the Mortal Demon stage upon maturity, and with enough cultivation, breaking through to the Demon Spirit stage wasn't difficult.</p><p>Their most potent weapon was their venom.</p><p>The red mist they exhaled not only served as a protective shield, helping them absorb attacks, but also contained a deadly poison. Even for cultivators, accidentally inhaling a mouthful or being exposed to the mist would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Their tail hooks carried an even more lethal poison and were incredibly hard, capable of directly blocking attacks from magical artifacts!</p><p>Now, the red mist filled the sky, countless snake shadows writhing within.  It was impossible to tell how many Hook Snakes were concealed, but there were at least several dozen.  Even if only a small fraction had reached the Demon Spirit stage, it would be a huge problem!</p><p>Not to mention the possibility of even stronger demons at the mid or late Demon Spirit stage!</p><p>Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi exchanged glances, both puzzled. Before the Hook Snakes appeared, there were no signs of battle on the hills or below. How did Yu Kong avoid the Hook Snakes’ detection and slip through unnoticed?</p><p>But now was not the time to ponder these questions.</p><p>“Retreat to the cave!”</p><p>The two didn't dare hesitate any longer and immediately ordered a retreat!</p><p>The terrain here was wide open. Once surrounded by the snakes and trapped in the red mist, no one could guarantee their survival.</p><p>Only by relying on the narrow cave entrance could they set up formations, divide the snake horde, and slowly hunt them down.  No matter how powerful they were, the Hook Snakes were still just beasts.  With so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, they weren't necessarily afraid of them.</p><p>Following the orders, everyone formed a defensive formation and quickly retreated.</p><p>The hissing of the Hook Snakes rose and fell as the red mist rapidly spread, closing in on them.</p><p>"Be careful not to get injured. Don't let these monsters smell blood!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi suddenly remembered something and shouted a warning.</p><p>Legend had it that Hook Snakes were extremely sensitive to the smell of blood, especially the blood of human cultivators. Once they caught the scent, they would enter a state of extreme frenzy, becoming entirely different creatures.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, two loud explosions erupted beneath their feet.</p><p>Everyone was startled and looked down to see two bursts of blood mist erupting from the abyss.</p><p>Flesh and bone fragments flew everywhere, mixed with blood, splattering in all directions.</p><p>Caught off guard, the group was instantly enveloped by two clouds of blood mist, one on each side.</p><p>“Crescent Fairy!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face drastically changed as he cried out in alarm.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi's expression was equally horrified, clearly recognizing Old Man Withered Vine as well.</p><p>At this moment, they suddenly understood.  No wonder there were no warning signs, no traces of battle…</p><p>Their spies had been exposed long ago. Yu Kong knew, but he turned a blind eye, allowing the spies to relay the information and luring them into the trap.</p><p>This was clearly a trap carefully orchestrated by Yu Kong!</p><p>His purpose might have been to use them as bait for the Hook Snakes, or perhaps he had even more sinister intentions…</p><p>"Quick! Wipe away the blood mist!"</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi was the first to react, shouting urgently while unleashing a burst of crimson flames, attempting to burn away the bloody scent. The others naturally didn't dare to delay and quickly moved to erase the smell of blood.</p><p>But they were too late.</p><p>The red mist was hot on their heels. The moment the bodies exploded, the Hook Snakes had already caught the scent of blood.</p><p>Within the red mist, hidden from Luo Xingnan and the others, the Hook Snakes’ eyes suddenly turned crimson, fixated on the group above the abyss.</p><p>Their hissing intensified tenfold, a hundredfold.</p><p>Even more alarming, deep within the abyss, the Yin energy suddenly churned violently. Two enormous serpentine shadows, like arrows released from a bowstring, shot out of the abyss with earth-shattering roars at incredible speed!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the others, hiding in the shadows, didn't dare to breathe, fearing that the frenzied Hook Snakes would catch their scent. Otherwise, they would meet the same fate as Luo Xingnan and his group.</p><p>―――――</p><p>Qin Sang stealthily observed Yu Kong’s hiding place.  Now that the Hook Snakes were completely distracted by Luo Xingnan and the others, Yu Kong showed no intention of taking advantage of the situation to sneak past from the other side and gather the herbs.</p><p>Did he plan to stay and watch the battle unfold, waiting for a victor before making his move?</p>
