<h1>Chapter 280: The Convergence Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang's goal was to gain Yu Kong's trust.  First, he needed to demonstrate his value and showcase a certain level of strength, ideally enough to entice Yu Kong to approach him.</p><p>His other objective was to let Yu Kong and the others know he wasn't someone to be trifled with, preventing them from using him as a pawn in dangerous situations.</p><p>This was a plan Qin Sang had formulated beforehand.  Left to his own devices, he would have avoided drawing attention to himself.</p><p>He needed to display strength, but not excessively.</p><p>The Ebony Sword and the Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation were sufficient to deter them.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Banner, the Jade Ruyi Talisman, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman – none of these could be revealed.</p><p>Having repelled Yan Wu, the Ebony Sword whistled as it flew back, flashing once before disappearing into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The circular sword formation still hovered in the air. A moment later, the sword energies dissipated, but the sharp sword intent lingered in everyone's minds, refusing to disperse.</p><p>The onlookers wore various expressions.</p><p>The moment the Ebony Sword appeared, Shangguan Lifeng's eyes had lit up, fixated on the weapon.  After Qin Sang withdrew the sword, his gaze shifted to Qin Sang himself, a strong battle intent flickering in his eyes before quickly subsiding.</p><p>―――――</p><p>"What a sword!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters exchanged glances. Out of respect for a powerful cultivator, both Xiu Zhiying's coldness and Xiu Zhirui's charm diminished somewhat. They bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng's swordsmanship is divine. We are impressed."</p><p>Only Yan Wu, whose pride had been wounded, remained grim-faced.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, Yan Wu might not have been so easily repelled.</p><p>He wanted to regain face but knew that since the Daoist dared to reveal his natal flying sword, he likely possessed even stronger methods.</p><p>To challenge him rashly would be to invite humiliation.</p><p>Yan Wu glared at Qin Sang, snorted coldly, and without a word, turned and stormed into his room, slamming the door shut.</p><p>The Xiu sisters and Shangguan Lifeng also returned to their rooms.  Being strangers, they had no desire for idle chatter.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed by Yan Wu's animosity. Yu Kong also seemed oblivious to Yan Wu's behavior. He cupped his hands and praised, "Master, what a magnificent sword! What superb swordsmanship! With your and the other fellow Daoists' help, how can we fail in our great endeavor?"</p><p>"Master, please settle into your room. Simply activate the restrictions, and you needn't worry about being disturbed. You can cultivate in peace." Yu Kong led Qin Sang to an empty room and instructed him on how to manipulate the restrictions within.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The room was cramped and sparsely furnished, only about a quarter the size of a typical room, with just a single meditation cushion inside.</p><p>Yu Kong explained, "Cave dwellings in West Desolation Town are exorbitantly expensive. My meager funds could only afford this small courtyard. I gave the largest room to the Xiu sisters; the others are indeed rather cramped. I hope you won't mind, Master."</p><p>"As cultivators, we require only a place to rest."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, indicating he didn't mind. Then, with a hint of curiosity, he asked, "Fellow Daoist Yu, I heard from the innkeeper that you are proficient in a formation that can ensure safe passage through the protective formation and into Autumn Wilds Market with over ninety percent certainty.  May I inquire as to the name of this formation? And when do we begin practicing it?"</p><p>Yu Kong lightly patted his forehead, shaking his head and chuckling. "If you hadn't mentioned it, Master, I would have nearly forgotten! I suppose seeing your impressive strength, and with such a powerful ally, I became overly excited and put this most crucial matter out of my mind..."</p><p>Although Qin Sang understood Yu Kong's flattery, such sincere-sounding compliments would inevitably please most people.</p><p>This man is skilled at winning people over.</p><p>Qin Sang remained wary, modestly replying, "My meager skills are far inferior to yours, Fellow Daoist Yu.  As long as you do not find my strength lacking, I will do my utmost to maintain the formation and follow your lead..."</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly.</p><p>"To be honest, Master, the innkeeper exaggerated somewhat.  My formation is called the Convergence Formation. Its power isn't as great as he claimed, but because I've entered Autumn Wilds Market once before and have some understanding of the protective formation, I am indeed quite confident.  Furthermore, this formation requires at least nine people to reach its full potential.  Including you, we now have six. Please be patient, Master.  We just need to recruit three more, and then we can begin practicing the formation."</p><p>Like the Nine Radiance Star River Formation, the Convergence Formation also required nine participants.</p><p>"Nine" is indeed an extreme number, but it's quite normal. Qin Sang nodded, not asking further.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed very interested in Qin Sang. He didn't leave immediately, but instead subtly inquired about Qin Sang's origins.</p><p>"I've been active beyond Skull Ridge. Later, I heard that an ancient herb garden was discovered here, with spirit herbs appearing, so I hurried over. I didn't expect Autumn Fair to be so intricate. Had I known, I would have invited a few friends along, and wouldn't be in such a difficult situation..." Qin Sang said, feigning frustration.</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed. "I can't believe the rumor has already spread to Skull Ridge."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu also thinks it's a rumor?" Qin Sang feigned astonishment, his voice urgent. "Are there really no spirit herbs in Autumn Fair?"</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes flickered. He glanced at Qin Sang discreetly and said with unusual certainty, "It is indeed a rumor. Every time a secret realm like Autumn Fair appears, similar rumors circulate. This time, it has spread particularly widely, misleading many fellow Daoists, just like yourself. If the rumor said a few spirit herbs were hidden in a pagoda or ancient building within Autumn Fair, it might be plausible. But the rumor claims there's an undiscovered herb garden. Anyone who's been to Autumn Fair wouldn't believe that. I wonder what the intentions are of the scoundrels spreading such rumors."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't glean anything from Yu Kong's words. Since entering West Wasteland Town, he had made several inquiries, and the information he received was similar to what Yu Kong had said.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He didn't forget to interact with Yu Kong, his brow furrowed in silence.</p><p>Yu Kong consoled him, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. Even if the herb garden is a rumor, there are many places in Autumn Fair where treasures are hidden, including spirit herbs and immortal pills. I happen to know a thing or two. If you're interested, after we enter Autumn Fair, we could cooperate. We can divide the obtained treasures fairly, each taking what they need. What do you think?"</p><p>"This..."  Qin Sang hadn't expected the Ebony Sword's effect to be so potent. It was only the first day, and Yu Kong had already extended an invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang was inclined to accept, but it didn't fit the cautious persona he had presented to the old shopkeeper. He had to forgo this opportunity, a look of hesitation appearing on his face.</p><p>"Don't rush to answer, Fellow Daoist."  Yu Kong walked towards the exit, saying as he went, "We still have a long time to spend together. By then, you'll know my character."</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and nodded vigorously.</p>
