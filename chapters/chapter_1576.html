<h1>Chapter 1567: Exposure</h1><p>Chapter 1567: Exposure</p><p>Qin Sang understood the implication in Fu Han's words.</p><p>Why did the Eight Scenic Spots and Ganlu Temple risk their lives to force their way into the Wuwang Hall?</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, the esteemed head of the temple, was even injured.</p><p>This not only highlights the extreme danger of the Wuwang Hall, but also reveals the urgency and desperation of their intrusion, that they were willing to pay any price.</p><p>Coupled with previous rumors, it's hard not to overthink.</p><p>Were the two sects' Nascent Soul cultivators trapped in the Wuwang Hall, hence their desperate actions?</p><p>More than two hundred years have passed since the rumors of the missing Nascent Soul cultivators surfaced.</p><p>It truly gained traction after the mysterious intrusion into Ganlu Temple's Xiaofang Mountain.</p><p>The response from the two major immortal sects was unusual.</p><p>While one could argue that Nascent Soul cultivators are aloof and disdainful of clarifying rumors, the sects' unusually low-profile behavior is noteworthy.</p><p>After years of silence, the two sects suddenly dispatched numerous experts, showing an unusual interest in the Wuwang Hall.</p><p>How could one not suspect something?</p><p>Si Tu Yu and Cheng Shenzi returned from the East Sea and immediately summoned the Zhuozhou forces for a meeting, a move that is also intriguing.  Fu Han of the Bunian Mountain sect sent an invitation, showing the importance attached to this meeting, and Qin Sang certainly had to attend.</p><p>Fu Han stayed briefly, received Qin Sang's assurance, and then left.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Pushan on time.</p><p>Liuhxu Mountain is located between Fudushu County and Bunian Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang could simply take a detour to pass by the Liuhxu Mountain gate. He naturally wouldn't go to Liuhxu Mountain to invite trouble, but he was curious whether Bunian Mountain would invite Cheng Huanzi.</p><p>He flew alone for a while.</p><p>Approaching Bunian Mountain, Qin Sang noticed a gust of wind blowing from the northwest, heading in the same direction as him. Within the breeze, he saw two figures, one of whom was the Changfeng Sect Master he had met a few days ago.</p><p>"Qingfeng Daoist!"</p><p>The Changfeng Sect Master also saw Qin Sang and flew closer with his companion.</p><p>"Daoist Cheng Wei mentioned it, and only then did I realize that Daoist Qingfeng was the first to detect the demon's plot. You left in a hurry that day; I haven't thanked you properly yet."</p><p>The Sect Master's evident worry had subsided, suggesting his spirits had recovered.</p><p>The other person was a young woman, only at the Foundation Establishment stage, a disciple of the Changfeng Sect Master.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed regret, "It was too late; we couldn't prevent the losses suffered by your sect.  Did you discover anything while tracking the demon afterward?  Did you determine its origin?"</p><p>"Fate!"</p><p>The Changfeng Sect Master sighed, "We chased them to Zhaoyao Mountain and captured some minor demons. They were all misled and couldn't provide any information. After Sect Master Si Tu returned, Daoist Cheng Wei reported the matter, describing the demon's abilities.  Sect Master Si Tu said it was only about one-third similar to the Zhu Long Demon Energy and couldn't confirm if it was a descendant of Lu Lao Mo."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, "Lately, there have been more and more demons taking advantage of the chaos."</p><p>They slowed their pace and chatted as they flew.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a mountain barely over a thousand feet high, landed on the summit, and saw a stone tablet inscribed with "Baiyun Waterfall."</p><p>Learning that this was Bunian Mountain, the young woman, visiting for the first time, widened her eyes in disappointment. She was sent by her master to Bunian Mountain to become an outer disciple, aiming to cultivate there until the False Core stage.  Before arriving, she had envisioned various scenes of an immortal sect.</p><p>The surroundings were pleasant, but a significant difference from her image of a top-tier sect.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Changfeng Sect Master exchanged smiles, activated the restriction on the stone tablet, and soared into the sky.</p><p>The young woman was protected by her master.</p><p>She only felt the piercing wind, the increasing speed, and in a blink of an eye, they reached a breathtaking altitude. Her vision shifted, revealing a magnificent scene.</p><p>Above the clouds, the white clouds cascaded like a waterfall.</p><p>A white jade ribbon flowed down from the heavens.</p><p>Looking down, the young woman saw boundless, undulating cloud waves like mountains, but from below, only clear blue skies were visible.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Changfeng Sect Master didn't reduce their speed, cutting through the clouds and reaching the peak of the waterfall, the sight changed again.</p><p>Clouds billowed, and a rosy glow filled the air.</p><p>Immortal mountains appeared and disappeared among the clouds, high above the world, far removed from the mortal realm.</p><p>The young woman was mesmerized.</p><p>Qin Sang, not a first-time visitor to Bunian Mountain, silently marveled, "What a view! Unfortunately, such treasures are rare in the Central Plains, all occupied by powerful sects. Compared to Bunian Mountain, Pushan is just a small hill."</p><p>"Both of you have arrived."</p><p>As they settled, a figure appeared, Cheng Wei.</p><p>The three exchanged greetings.</p><p>Cheng Weizhi summoned a disciple to take the girl away, then personally flew towards one of the immortal mountains with Qin Sang and Chang Feng.</p><p>This mountain, Bunan Mountain, was where distinguished guests were received.</p><p>Nearing the mountain, Cheng Weizhi restrained his flying speed.  "Daoist Changfeng, please wait.  The Sect Master has summoned you to the main peak… I will first take Daoist Luo to rest."</p><p>The Changfeng Sect Master glanced at Qin Sang in surprise, but asked no further questions, following Cheng Weizhi into the mountain.</p><p>The main peak was situated in the heart of the cloud sea.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged as she followed Cheng Weizhi into the main peak, arriving at a lakeside pavilion.</p><p>Inside the pavilion were two meditation cushions; on one sat a man in white robes, tall and slender.</p><p>He was strikingly handsome, with sharp features and a youthful appearance, even more so than Lu Zhang.  His Daoist attire somehow carried an air of refined elegance.</p><p>"Reporting to the Sect Master, Daoist Qingfeng has arrived."</p><p>Cheng Weizhi bowed deeply and withdrew.</p><p>This man was the Sect Master of Bunan Mountain—Situ Yu.</p><p>Situ Yu slowly opened his eyes, like stars suddenly ignited, gesturing to the opposite cushion. His voice was as smooth as jade, "Daoist, please be seated."</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged opposite Situ Yu without hesitation.</p><p>Situ Yu's eyes were bright, fixed on Qin Sang's.  He then spoke, startling her, "Should I address you as Daoist Qingfeng, or Daoist Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened slightly, but her tone remained light, "Why do you ask?"</p><p>"The appearance of a master like you in Zhuozhou naturally prompts inquiry into your origins. However, those we sent found no trace of the Qingyang Island you mentioned in the East Sea.  If only you were a mysterious expert, that would be one thing, but the mystery surrounding both of you is rather suspicious."</p><p>Situ Yu paused, noting Qin Sang's unchanged expression, and continued, "For over a hundred years, you have remained peaceful in Pushan.  If you have no ulterior motives, I would not interfere; Zhuozhou could benefit from another top-tier expert. Thirty years ago, you saved my junior brother Lu, proving my choice to be correct."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly, "Was it the spiritual treasure that exposed me?"</p><p>Situ Yu nodded. "While far from the Central Plains, the Zhusha Temple and the Central Plains have maintained contact. A century ago, they commissioned allies to search for two people, a man and a woman. The woman possessed a spiritual treasure, matching the description of your small seal. The man was not only a top-tier expert, but also cultivated the Second Yuan Ying divine ability, possessing a physical manifestation of equal power to his original self."</p><p>This was not unexpected to Qin Sang.</p><p>She had stolen the Buddha bone relics from the Zhusha Temple; they would undoubtedly retaliate.</p><p>To escape pursuit, her second Yuan Ying had merged with her main body in front of Venerable Chengyuan—a fact they would not have missed.</p><p>"Do you intend to hand me over to the Hanhai?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, her face showing no fear.</p><p>The use of the spiritual treasure was thirty years ago.</p><p>If Situ Yu intended to harm her, he would have done so long ago.  Bringing up the matter now was unnecessary.</p><p>Indeed, Situ Yu shook his head gently.  "You revealed your identity to save my junior brother; Bunan Mountain would never be ungrateful! I am simply curious, why did you choose Pushan?"</p><p>The question was broad.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Situ Yu's meaning, replying calmly, "If I said I simply sought a peaceful place to cultivate and make a life, would you believe me?"</p><p>Situ Yu’s response surprised Qin Sang, "I could believe it, but I dare not fully trust it at this time."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, her voice deepening, "Did you discover something in the Wu Wang Palace?"</p><p>"Daoist Qin is indeed perceptive!"</p><p>Situ Yu, now certain of Qin Sang's identity, no longer concealed anything, recounting his experience in the East Sea.  "The entrance to the Wu Wang Palace was a forbidden zone, filled with terrifying spatial turbulence and restrictive storms.  We suspect the original mountain gate of the Wu Wang Palace was extraordinary, and its protective formation suffered a catastrophic event. Otherwise, no matter how fierce the conflict, it wouldn't have created such a wasteland.  Including True Person Zilei, none could pass through that zone, only differing in how far they penetrated.  However, during our search for the Wu Wang Palace, I discovered traces of the Yao King, and unexpectedly learned something: the Yao clan's Sacred King Palace… has been split."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang immediately understood what Situ Yu meant.</p><p>The Yao clan's Sacred King was a great demon at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>If the Sacred King were still alive, how could the Sacred King Palace be split?</p><p>Rumors of the disappearance of Holy Sage Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu were rampant.</p><p>However, the prestige of a Nascent Soul cultivator remained.</p><p>Even after over two hundred years of their disappearance, various factions only dared to operate in secret, fearing to openly antagonize the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>The unrest in the Central Plains is a result of the lingering rumors surrounding the Eight Scenic Spots and the Ganlu Temple, which have gradually surfaced over time.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the first trouble arose from the East Sea's demon tribe.</p><p>The Sacred King's Palace is in disarray, strongly suggesting that the demon tribe's Sacred King is in danger.  Qin Sang can only imagine the ensuing chaos if this news spreads through the cultivation world.</p><p>Situ Yu's intentions are clear.</p><p>In times of peace, Situ Yu would be confident in allowing Qin Sang to remain in Zhuozhou. Even if Qin Sang harbored ulterior motives, they wouldn't threaten the position of the Buluo Mountain.</p><p>However, with turmoil approaching, everything is interconnected, and even major sects must exercise caution.</p><p>Throughout history, which sect has remained prosperous and unbroken?  Even the formidable Wu Wang Palace was reduced to ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang, an outsider of unknown origin, could become a destabilizing factor.</p><p>“Daoist friend, are you asking me to leave Buluo Mountain?” Qin Sang pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p>Situ Yu denied it. “Buluo Mountain is Daoist friend Qin’s cultivation site. Since Buluo Mountain has already acknowledged it, it won't go back on its word.  I asked you here to inform you of something: I have decided that Buluo Mountain will be closed for a century.”</p><p>Closed!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect Situ Yu to be so decisive.</p><p>Buluo Mountain is not like the Xie family; it cannot be closed at will.</p><p>Closing the mountain means Buluo Mountain will relinquish most of its interests outside the sect, incurring immeasurable losses.  No wonder they summoned various forces in Zhuozhou for a meeting.</p><p>Under Situ Yu's gaze, Qin Sang replied, “I can assure you that whatever I do in the future will not involve Buluo Mountain or Zhuozhou.”</p><p>Situ Yu was pleased with this answer, a smile appearing on his face. His tone softened, and he changed the subject. “Daoist friend, have you made any progress in refining the cold crystal?”</p><p>Thirty years ago, Fu Han delivered the cold crystal, and Qin Sang had his external avatar attempt to refine it.</p><p>The crystal contained an unprecedented cold煞 (sha) energy, quite potent, but not quite compatible with the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>This cold煞 energy fluctuated noticeably, making it difficult to conceal.  The most important characteristic of Ice Soul Divine Light is its concealment.</p><p>However, after a period of time, Qin Sang confirmed that refining the cold crystal did help in cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>This was unexpected and left him hesitant.</p><p>Even if he could cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light, it would undoubtedly differ greatly from the original version.  He wouldn't be able to use it like Liuli, striking invisibly and unexpectedly.</p><p>However, the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light would likely increase, and its ability to restrain opponents might be even stronger.</p><p>Because he needed to protect his main body, and the cold煞 energy in the crystal wasn't enough for him to fully cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light, Qin Sang temporarily shelved the crystal.</p><p>When Situ Yu brought up the matter, Qin Sang asked, “I dare to ask, Daoist friend, where did this cold crystal originate? Are there more?”</p><p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p><p>The possibility of his avatar cultivating the original Ice Soul Divine Light was slim.</p><p>If he had enough cold crystals, Qin Sang wouldn’t mind his avatar learning another powerful divine ability.</p><p>“This item was obtained unexpectedly when I was traveling in the Northern Wastelands with another Daoist friend, the Yan Shan Elder, while pursuing a strange snow fox. The fox disappeared, leaving only this cold crystal.  I stopped inquiring after returning to the mountain. However, Elder Yan Shan's cultivation site is nearby, and he should know more.  My junior brother Lu mentioned that Daoist friend Qin has an ability that allows you to easily see through the Liuxu Mountain; perhaps you could catch that snow fox. I'll write a letter, and Daoist friend Qin can visit Elder Yan Shan with it...”</p><p>Situ Yu said, writing the letter casually.</p><p>Although he pressed Qin Sang for a promise, he didn't mind extending a favor and forging a good relationship.  After all, he hadn't promised anything; whether he could persuade Elder Yan Shan depended on Qin Sang's own abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang received the letter, thanked him, and left the water pavilion.</p><p>There was no need for him to participate in the subsequent discussions, so he flew directly towards Buluo Mountain's gate.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, a figure emerged from the shadows – Cheng Shenzi.</p><p>Situ Yu looked at Qin Sang's back and said calmly, "Junior Brother Lu is in seclusion, refining the stone toad. My next Heavenly Tribulation will occur within a century. While this tribulation isn't necessarily life-threatening, my chances of survival are less than 30%.  During this time, I'll leave the sect's affairs to my junior brother."</p><p>“Senior Brother Sect Master will surely overcome all dangers!”</p><p>Cheng Shenzi's tone was serious as he watched Qin Sang. "This person…"</p><p>“As long as he doesn't do anything harmful to Buluo Mountain, let him be.”</p><p>Situ Yu got up and walked towards his cave abode.</p>
