<h1>Chapter 1544:  Lu Zhang of Mount Unmindful (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1544:  Lu Zhang of Mount Unmindful (4k)</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the bamboo grove, the sound carrying into the hall.  </p><p>Qin Sang, taking the lead, sat in the master's chair.</p><p>Zhou Jin stood behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Xie An stood in the middle of the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang offered him a seat, but Xie An insisted he didn't dare.</p><p>Hearing the soothing wind outside, Xie An's anxiety remained, and he desperately tried to signal Zhou Jin for guidance.</p><p>Zhou Jin, eyes fixed straight ahead, was also uneasy.</p><p>Because the person with him wasn’t Qin Sang himself, but an external manifestation, going by the alias Qingfeng Daozhang.</p><p>Zhou Jin, unaware of the truth, assumed Qin Sang was merely in disguise, speculating on the purpose. Was it truly a head-on collision with the Xie family and the Six Emptiness Sect?</p><p>Limited by his cultivation, Zhou Jin's investigation of the Six Emptiness Sect only scratched the surface, failing to uncover core secrets. Yet, he could still deduce some things from the clues.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect held sway over several counties in Zhuozhou, preventing Mount Unmindful's influence from reaching the county towns – a feat beyond the capacity of three Yuan Ying elders alone.  Offending the Six Emptiness Sect might unleash a far greater power.</p><p>Such was the Middle Kingdom: factions intertwined in a complex web of checks and balances.  </p><p>A deceptive calm concealed underlying currents.</p><p>Concealing his identity suggested even Qin Sang lacked certainty about the fate of their lesser members; would they be treated as expendable pawns?</p><p>Qin Sang paid no heed to Zhou Jin's thoughts, and glanced at Xie An.</p><p>Xie An’s condition couldn’t escape Qin Sang’s keen eyes: he wasn't incapable of forming a Golden Core, but had suffered severe injuries, having been struck down from the Golden Core stage and sustaining internal damage that hindered his recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang casually asked, “Has the Xie family not yet reopened the Pure Void Realm?”</p><p>These words struck Xie An like a thunderbolt.</p><p>Xie An's eyes widened in terror.</p><p>The Pure Void Realm was the Xie family's greatest secret, unknown to outsiders. He only learned of it from the previous clan head upon succeeding him, setting a self-destructing soul-searching prohibition within his own spirit.</p><p>Neither the Luo Yan Sect nor the Six Emptiness Sect knew of the Pure Void Realm.</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>Xie An was instantly drenched in cold sweat. The wind whistling through the trees felt like a chill coursing from his head to his toes, freezing him stiff, leaving him utterly flustered.</p><p>He didn't know how to respond, much less dare deny it.</p><p>This secret was the Xie family's sole hope for revival.</p><p>The Xie family had confirmed that the Pure Void Realm was not destroyed, but had inexplicably shut down.  After being driven from Mount Pu by the Luo Yan Sect, the Xie family endured humiliation, never giving up hope.</p><p>Once they found a way to reopen the Pure Void Realm, they would plot their return to Mount Pu. The timeframe, however, remained uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang ceased teasing the younger man. “I am acting on another's behalf. This person has deep ties with your Xie family, and has commissioned me to assist you in reopening the Pure Void Realm.”</p><p>Stunned, Xie An's terror morphed into astonishment. He blurted out, “I wonder, which ancestor?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, saying nothing.</p><p>Xie An dared not ask further, his mind finally clearing somewhat as he rapidly searched his memories of the words left by previous Xie family ancestors. He couldn't figure out who it could be.</p><p>The secret of the Pure Void Realm was certainly out.</p><p>Moreover, this person was a Yuan Ying master, capable of obliterating the Xie family in an instant.</p><p>Regardless of this person's veracity, the Xie family had no choice but to believe!</p><p>Xie An gritted his teeth, his decision made. He bowed.  “I alone cannot decide, senior. Could you grant me a few days? The Grand Elder is currently away. I shall contact him immediately.”</p><p>Zhou Jin looked surprised. His investigation of the Xie family had failed to uncover this mysterious Grand Elder.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, found it unsurprising. If the Xie family hadn't been concealing their strength, they would have been completely wiped out by the Luo Yan Sect long ago.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, in no hurry.</p><p>Xie An quickly left the hall, returning shortly after with the clan's records, as requested by Qin Sang.</p><p>The external manifestation remained at the Xie family residence.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's main body secretly infiltrated the Fudou County government office.</p><p>Inside the government office,</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in a quiet room, sipping fragrant tea.</p><p>A flurry of hurried footsteps outside was followed by a slightly overweight cultivator entering, beaming. “Reporting to senior, the message has been sent back to the mountain gate as you requested. I marked it as urgent; it's sure to reach Elder Lu. Whether or not he attends the meeting, however, is beyond my control.”</p><p>This person was the prefect of Fudou County.</p><p>A magistrate, not originally from Mount Bu Nian, was transferred to a county city after his career prospects stalled.  His responsibilities were to maintain order and educate the populace, but the county was dominated by the Six Emptiness Sect.  Trapped and powerless, his ambitions remained unrealized.  However, his reputation from Mount Bu Nian afforded him a degree of protection, allowing him a relatively peaceful, if unfulfilling, existence.</p><p>A sudden visit from Qin Sang, who revealed himself as a Yuan Ying cultivator, requesting a meeting with an elder from Mount Bu Nian, left the magistrate with no choice but to comply.  Elder Lu, the sect's chief enforcer, held immense power and influence.</p><p>Qin Sang, setting down his teacup, smiled subtly. “Thank you, Magistrate.”</p><p>The magistrate repeatedly demurred.</p><p>“I expect this matter to remain confidential.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s smile vanished, his gaze piercing the magistrate before he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Moments later, the magistrate was left shaken, haunted by that chilling gaze.  He fidgeted anxiously, muttering, “Troubled times! Troubled times!”</p><p>Three days later, an elderly man with a white beard secretly entered the Xie family estate to meet Qin Sang with Xie An.  Unsurprisingly, this elder was a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>“Xie Qian greets the senior!”  His voice boomed, his presence far exceeding Xie An’s.  He addressed Qin Sang with neither subservience nor arrogance, “My apologies for my lateness.  I hope I haven’t kept you waiting too long.”</p><p>Qin Sang regarded him, then said calmly, “I presume you understand the situation. I intend to help the Xie family reclaim their ancestral lands. What are your plans?”</p><p>Xie Qian hesitated. “I am unworthy of such kindness, senior.  I am unsure how to repay you.  Furthermore, the Luo Yan Sect will surely not defy you, but what of the Six Emptiness Sect…?”</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted, his tone flat, “I act on behalf of another. I require no recompense from your family.  After activating the Clear Void Illusionary Realm, I merely require its temporary use for cultivation. As for the Six Emptiness Sect, I will deal with them.  If you have no further questions, prepare yourselves.”</p><p>The simplicity of the request left Xie Qian and Xie An incredulous. Perhaps this senior wasn't deceiving them; perhaps this was a legacy from a forefather.</p><p>“We shall obey your commands, senior!” they replied in unison.</p><p>Faced with the decree of a Yuan Ying cultivator, the Xie family dared not refuse.  Whether it was flying into a fire, they had no other choice.</p><p>Fortunately, anticipating the Luo Yan Sect’s treachery, the Xie family had taken precautions by secretly relocating a branch of their family. Even if Xie An's branch perished, the family line would continue.</p><p>It was a crisis. But it could also be an opportunity.</p><p>One day, several Luo Yan Sect disciples guarding the mountain gate nervously watched the constant stream of cultivators coming and going.</p><p>“Senior Brother Wu, Elder Zhou holds you in high regard.  You must have heard about it, right? Why is the sect on such high alert?  They've activated the mountain protection formation, even the Sect Master and the elders have left their seclusion multiple times these past few months.  Has something major happened in the cultivation world?”</p><p>A young disciple, unable to contain her curiosity, whispered to a senior disciple.  Other disciples also looked over, sharing the same curiosity.</p><p>Basking in the attention, Senior Brother Wu glanced around, then leaned in, “I only overheard a bit while helping Elder Zhou refine pills a few days ago.  Don’t repeat this.  Several months ago, a Yuan Ying ancestor supposedly experienced their tribulation nearby.  And a mysterious Yuan Ying cultivator has since appeared in the area.  Of course the Sect Master is concerned!”</p><p>“A Yuan Ying ancestor!”</p><p>The disciples gasped, awestruck by the immense power of such a being.  The Luo Yan Sect, despite its power, had never produced a Yuan Ying ancestor.</p><p>“The legendary Heavenly Tribulation! Did the senior succeed?”</p><p>The girl, her eyes wide with awe, clutched her chest, eager for an answer.</p><p>“How would I know?”</p><p>Wu shrugged. “Didn’t you see several elders from the Six Emptiness Sect recently? It was surely about that matter.  I reckon nothing came of it; otherwise the sect would have returned to normal.”</p><p>“Right…”</p><p>The disciples nodded, murmuring among themselves.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing sound shattered the air from below.</p><p>The disciples straightened, following the sound, then froze in shock.</p><p>A large group of cultivators was rapidly approaching from below, clearly hostile.  The Xie family and the Luo Yan Sect had a long-standing conflict, and the disciples easily recognized several familiar faces.</p><p>“Xie family!”</p><p>Senior Brother Wu cried out, immediately crushing a warning talisman and shouting, “The Xie family is attacking the mountain!”</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The talisman shattered, shooting a signal arrow into the sky.</p><p>Rolling mist billowed from the mountain gate, closing in on the center, leaving no gaps. The protective mountain formation was fully activated.</p><p>Instantly, the entire Luoyan Sect trembled.</p><p>Streams of escaping light flew from the mountain, rushing towards the gate.</p><p>A cultivator in gray robes arrived first. Seeing the scene before the gate, his face changed drastically, and he roared, “Xie An, you’re audacious! Leading the Xie family to block my sect’s gate without cause, what are your intentions?!”</p><p>Xie An landed in front of the mountain gate and waved his arm.</p><p>The Xie family disciples formed their ranks before the Luoyan Sect gate, their weapons pointed directly at the sect. Hearing this shameless accusation, they were filled with righteous indignation, their eyes blazing, and curses erupted.</p><p>Xie An sneered, “Everyone in Fudou County knows that Mount Pu was originally the ancestral land of my Xie family! Your Luoyan Sect bullies others, seizing others’ caves. You still have the nerve to question me? Shameless!”</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator was momentarily speechless. He naturally knew the truth and didn’t know how to retort.</p><p>The Xie family had fallen, and Luoyan Sect had long considered Mount Pu its own territory.</p><p>They never expected the Xie family to dare to attack, it was simply suicidal.</p><p>The gray-robed cultivator snorted coldly, about to lash out, when he saw the Sect Master arrive. He quickly bowed and stepped aside.</p><p>The Luoyan Sect Master’s surname was Mo, and he wore a green robe.</p><p>Reputation precedes a person.</p><p>Seeing Sect Master Mo emerge from the mist, not only did the Luoyan Sect disciples fall silent, but the clamor of the Xie family disciples outside also involuntarily weakened.</p><p>Faced with the Xie family blockade, Sect Master Mo showed no anger. His eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze bypassing Xie An to fix on Xie Qian behind him. He chuckled, “Old ghost Xie Qian, you’re still alive.”</p><p>“With the ancestral land in the hands of others, how can I face the Xie family ancestors?”</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, his aura erupting, confronting Sect Master Mo.  His cultivation was inferior, however, and his momentum was significantly weaker.</p><p>Sect Master Mo laughed, “The Liuxu Sect bore witness that day; right and wrong have their own judgment. I don’t want to engage in pointless arguments. Think carefully, with your old, weak, sick, and disabled members, do you really want to start a war…?”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Sect Master Mo suddenly saw Qin Sang’s transformed form standing beside Xie An.</p><p>The more Sect Master Mo looked, the more wrong it felt. He hadn’t noticed this person before, completely overlooking them.</p><p>His words faltered.</p><p>Sect Master Mo stared intently at Qin Sang, his expression gradually showing a look of astonishment.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang stepped forward.</p><p>It seemed like a casual step, and even though it was across the protective mountain formation, the hearts of everyone in Luoyan Sect, including Sect Master Mo, felt as if struck by lightning, and they all stepped back.</p><p>“Sect Master Mo is right, right and wrong have their own judgment. Since the Liuxu Sect bore witness back then, they should also judge who is right and who is wrong now.”</p><p>Then, Qin Sang turned sideways and gestured, “Why doesn't Sect Master Mo send someone to invite the Liuxu Sect friends? I shall wait and see.”</p><p>…</p><p>Fudou County boasted interconnected mountains and rivers, with beautiful scenery.</p><p>The sky was clear and cloudless.</p><p>Yet, a white cloud was speeding across the high sky.</p><p>Two figures were on the cloud; it was a flying artifact.</p><p>Both appeared young.</p><p>One wore tight-fitting clothing, a wooden tag with the words "Enforcement Hall" hanging from his waist. His brows were sharp, his bearing noble. The other was much more ordinary, wearing a simple Taoist robe, with a calm expression and peaceful aura, sitting with his eyes closed.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, the white cloud smoothly flew over mountains, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>The young man in tight-fitting clothing stood at the edge of the white cloud, looking at the scenery below, and softly said, “Master Lu, we are almost at Fudou County’s city.”</p><p>His demeanor was extremely respectful.</p><p>Because the other person, though seemingly his age, was the renowned elder of the Bu Nian Mountain Enforcement Hall—Lu Zhang!</p><p>Lu Zhang was not only highly ranked in Bu Nian Mountain but also a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator, rumored to be the most likely to become a Grand Cultivator in Bu Nian Mountain’s current generation.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn’t respond, remaining silent.</p><p>The young man in tight-fitting clothing dared not show any impatience, standing quietly beside him.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Zhang suddenly opened his eyes, his eyes flashing with brilliance, and he stood up.</p><p>The young man in tight-fitting clothing was startled. Before he could understand what was happening, he was thrown violently away by a force, hearing Lu Zhang’s shout, “Retreat!”</p><p>The young man barely steadied himself, horrified to discover that a violent wind had suddenly arisen in front of the white cloud.</p><p>A terrifying wave surged from the mountain below into the sky.</p><p>The wind howled, the force rapidly contracting towards the center, and after a moment, it condensed into a phantom figure.</p><p>“Spiritual sense manifestation!”</p><p>The young man in tight-fitting clothing exclaimed.</p><p>The figure spoke, its voice like rolling thunder.</p><p>“Daoist Lu, I have been waiting for you. Why don't you come down for a chat?”</p>
