<h1>Chapter 825: Bloodforged Fruit</h1><p>Xiang'an Auction House.</p><p>Qin Sang finally met Alchemist Yi.</p><p>“It's been years. Fellow Daoist Qin still looks the same," Alchemist Yi said with a chuckle as he entered.</p><p>A servant girl followed him, carrying a tray with a storage pouch, which she handed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it and saw the spirit materials he had commissioned Xiang'an Auction House to gather. These were needed for the spirit array to refine the Ten Yama Banners’ flagpole.  He had already collected some before, and now with these, the set was complete, lacking only high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>"You've gone to great lengths, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up with joy.  He accepted the spirit materials and paid the spirit stones, a considerable sum that depleted his savings again. Fortunately, he'd had a few windfalls recently and could still manage.</p><p>After the servant girl left, Qin Sang continued, "After we parted ways, Fellow Daoist Yi, I came here a few more times and learned you'd gone to the Demon Sea.  Later, I had to leave Skyrise Island because of an important matter, and unexpectedly, years passed. I heard there was quite a stir back then, not just you but many others were sent to the Demon Sea. When did you return?"</p><p>"Indeed, I went to the Demon Sea. Many fellow Daoists went with me, and most of them are still there. I just recently found an opportunity to return."</p><p>As Alchemist Yi spoke, his smile faded, and he sighed.</p><p>Seeing his hesitant look, Qin Sang grew curious and asked in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist Yi, did something happen in the Demon Sea?"</p><p>Alchemist Yi nodded, hesitated for a moment, then waved his hand, casting a soundproof barrier.  "Fellow Daoist Qin, if you trust me, it’s best not to go to the Demon Sea anytime soon.  I suspect there will be major changes there in the near future."</p><p>"How so?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>He secretly guessed that in the Demon Sea, humans and witches had to cooperate to survive, their only enemy being the demon race. Could it be that the demon race was making a move?  If both humans and witches were forced out of the Demon Sea, and all cultivators were trapped in the Boundless Sea, it was hard to imagine the chaos that would ensue.</p><p>"I can't say my guess is entirely accurate, but in the two years I was in the Demon Sea, beast tides attacking the islands became significantly more frequent.  Even two Nascent Soul ancestors were forced to abandon their islands, nearly causing the sea routes to be severed.  It’s said that these demon beasts acted with a strange orderliness, possibly under the command of a powerful demon. The Merchant Alliance’s recent actions suggest they’ve noticed something too.  I have a bad feeling, so I found a chance to request a return.  I only know alchemy, not combat. I don’t want to be caught in a beast tide siege.”</p><p>Alchemist Yi shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang had spent decades in the Demon Sea and personally experienced beast tides, so he understood the situation there.  Hearing Alchemist Yi’s words, he also sensed something was amiss.</p><p>Beast tides attacking cultivator-occupied islands used to be common. For instance, Five Elements Island was attacked repeatedly by beast tides, losing all five islands, forcing the cultivators to flee.</p><p>However, islands occupied by Nascent Soul cultivators were not so easily lost. Such events might only occur once every century.</p><p>For two Nascent Soul cultivators to abandon their islands within just a few years was highly unusual.</p><p>"What are the demons trying to do? They wouldn’t try to drive all cultivators out of the Demon Sea, would they? As far as I know, Skywitch Island and Great Wilderness Island have never fallen. They’re connected by teleportation arrays, and reinforcements can be sent at any time," Qin Sang said, puzzled.</p><p>"Who knows?  We still know too little about the demon race, only that a few powerful clans rule the Demon Sea. I'm not worried about Skywitch Island and Great Wilderness Island falling, but I fear the chaos of a large-scale war.  We are insignificant, and if we get caught up in it, we'll be at their mercy. Who knows what will happen to us?  Falling into the hands of demons, even keeping a whole corpse would be difficult…" Alchemist Yi paused, then chuckled. "Of course, this is just my speculation, and it may not be accurate. Perhaps I'm just too attached to life."</p><p>"I believe there's truth to your words, Fellow Daoist. Thank you for the warning."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude with a bow.</p><p>Just then, Alchemist Yi seemed to remember something and changed the subject.  "Fellow Daoist Qin, you rushed over as soon as you returned to the island. Is it for the spirit fruit?"</p><p>“I didn't expect you to remember,” Qin Sang smiled slightly.</p><p>"Of course. I never go back on my word."</p><p>With that, Alchemist Yi took out a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang. "After returning, I finally found information on this spirit fruit in a friend's collection of ancient demon race texts.  See if it matches. Translated from the demon language, this fruit is called the Bloodforged Fruit.  It can refine blood and marrow, strengthen bones and tendons. It’s extremely potent, and only demon beasts, with their robust bodies, can withstand it.  If we cultivators consume it directly, we risk exploding.  If you find this fruit, remember never to eat it raw.  It's best to find an alchemist to temper its potency."</p><p>"Bloodforged Fruit?"</p><p>Hearing this name, Qin Sang's heart jolted with surprise.</p><p>The cultivation method "Demonic Refinement," mentioned three spirit fruits that could aid in breaking through to the third level, one of which was called the Bloodforged Fruit!</p><p>The other two were called Azurevine Root and Scorpion Venom Grass.</p><p>He only had the names, not their appearances.  He had inquired about them before but found no clues. He had planned to ask Alchemist Yi after his return, but he didn't expect to already have one of the spirit fruits in his possession.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his composure, steadily took the jade slip, and saw the copied text.  He immediately found the name written in demon script, which perfectly matched the characters in "Demonic Refinement"!</p><p>"It really is the Bloodforged Fruit."</p><p>Qin Sang read through the demon text and found that Alchemist Yi was right. It was indeed an extremely potent spirit fruit that could refine the physical body.  For demon beasts, it was a rare treasure.</p><p>When ripe, the Bloodforged Fruit was covered in a dense, blood-red net, resembling fresh blood. The spirit fruits he had were not yet ripe but already possessed most of their potency.</p><p>"Demon beasts consume it raw directly. After I break through to the third level of 'Demonic Refinement' and my body transforms, I should be able to consume it as well.  However, I still don’t know where to find a place for Star Essence Infusion.  Now that I have the Bloodforged Fruit, if I can find the other two spirit herbs, I can try to break through the bottleneck.  That's a viable option…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.  He withdrew his divine sense from the jade slip, stood up, and thanked Alchemist Yi.  "You've gone to great lengths, Fellow Daoist Yi. It is indeed the same spirit fruit. I finally know its name!"</p><p>Alchemist Yi shook his head. "Don't get too excited, Fellow Daoist Qin. This spirit fruit isn't easy to obtain.  I've never heard of it before, so I imagine few have found it.  Knowing the name is useless if you can’t find it."</p><p>"You are right."</p><p>Qin Sang forced a bitter smile. "Besides, these aren’t the only spirit herbs I need.  Fellow Daoist Yi, have you ever heard of Azurevine Root and Scorpion Venom Grass?"</p><p>"Those…"</p><p>Alchemist Yi was taken aback. "If I hadn’t looked them up, I wouldn't have remembered. According to the records, both are spirit herbs used by demon beasts to refine their bodies. Are you a body cultivator, Fellow Daoist?"</p>
