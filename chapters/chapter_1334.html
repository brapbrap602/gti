<h1>Chapter 1326: Opening the Altar to Preach the Dao</h1><p>"Let's see how this formation diagram works."</p><p>Qing Jun took out the Demon-Binding Rope and a new formation diagram. Only then did Qin Sang realize that Qing Jun had been studying the Demon-Binding Rope all these years.</p><p>Last time, Qing Jun had restored a formation diagram based on the one Qin Sang had copied. It allowed her to activate the Demon-Binding Rope, but only a fraction of its power could be unleashed, and there were significant limitations during its use.</p><p>Later, Qing Jun had exchanged insights with Bai and made new discoveries, but it wasn’t until after the great battle that she finally had time to go into seclusion.</p><p>Judging by Qing Jun’s confident expression, she must have been quite satisfied with this new formation diagram.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Fire Lotus Seed, summoning the Demonic Fire.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As soon as the Demonic Fire appeared, Qin Sang felt his vision blur. Dozens of serpent-like shadows of the Demon-Binding Rope shot out from Qing Jun’s hands.</p><p>In an instant, the Demonic Fire was surrounded by the shadows, compressed into a fireball, and trapped within a cage formed by the Demon-Binding Rope.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He hadn’t even noticed when Qing Jun had set up the formation diagram.</p><p>He remembered that last time, Qing Jun had to prepare in advance, making it impractical for battlefield use. But this time, it was so fast!</p><p>He looked at Qing Jun and saw the formation diagram now floating above her head. The diagram and the Demon-Binding Rope in her hand were tightly connected, giving the impression of being one and the same.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s astonished expression, Qing Jun explained, "Our previous assumption was off. We thought the formation diagram and the Demon-Binding Rope were two separate things, but in reality, they were meant to be one. I changed my approach, and it worked. Activating the Demon-Binding Rope immediately triggers the formation diagram, eliminating the need for prior setup. Try it..."</p><p>Qing Jun handed the Demon-Binding Rope to Qin Sang and instructed him on how to activate it. When he tried, it worked exactly as she said.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>"Even the original formation diagram couldn’t be activated faster than this, could it? This makes the Demon-Binding Rope much more practical! With this, even the most powerful ancient demons won’t be able to dodge it."</p><p>Qing Jun nodded. "Exactly. When I was studying the formation diagram, I focused on this aspect. Time was limited, so I haven’t fully deciphered the entire diagram yet. The Demon-Binding Rope’s current power is passable, but it’s usable!"</p><p>"There are still four years left. Senior Sister, you’ll surely be able to refine the formation diagram further," Qin Sang said with anticipation.</p><p>He quickly memorized the formation diagram. In the future, when repairing the Mystic Iron Pillar, he could draw inspiration from Qing Jun’s approach to recreate the Demon-Sealing Stake.</p><p>With the Demon-Binding Rope in hand, Qin Sang felt much more confident about facing Elder Ye next time.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in Peach Blossom Valley for a few days, assisting Qing Jun in studying the Demon-Binding Rope, before hurriedly leaving for the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>In the forbidden land, the Flame-Repelling Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bing Han sat facing each other, with a mysterious piece of white bronze floating between them.</p><p>Bing Han’s eyes were closed as she used a secret technique to examine it.</p><p>After a while, Bing Han slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>"How is it?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang had decided to consult Bing Han, a master of artifact forging, before proceeding with his own crafting. He hoped she could lend her expertise.</p><p>Bing Han pondered for a moment and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin’s analysis is correct. At most, I can only achieve this much. However, I have some ideas that you might find useful."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly felt he had made the right decision and quickly replied, "Please, Fellow Daoist, share your insights. I will surely repay you generously!"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin has put so much effort into this. It seems you’re planning to forge an extraordinary treasure."</p><p>Bing Han glanced at the white bronze and then continued, "However, I can only offer a few suggestions. I dare not claim any credit. If you find them useful, I have a small request. Could you leave a record of your insights into the art of artifact forging with the Void Spirit Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed. He could do so immediately.</p><p>Having studied artifact forging at the Void Spirit Sect, this was his way of returning the favor.</p><p>Bing Han said, "The important matter comes first. This can wait until after you’ve completed your treasure. Additionally, if you’re willing to offer some guidance to our younger disciples, that would be even better."</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "After I finish forging this treasure, I will open an altar at the Yuan Shen Sect to preach the Dao, focusing on the art of artifact forging. This will also help me organize my own thoughts. At that time, disciples from the Void Spirit Sect are welcome to attend."</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>A figure flew out of the Void Spirit Sect.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, his expression was relaxed, and there was a hint of a smile in his eyes, as if something joyous had happened.</p><p>Indeed, it had!</p><p>After ten years of diligent study and six years of preparation, Qin Sang had spent two full years in seclusion within the Mountain Within a Mountain.</p><p>With the help of his senior sister and Bing Han, and by harnessing the power of the Demonic Fire and the Flame Fire, he had finally succeeded in forging that treasure!</p><p>As he flew out of the Void Spirit Sect, Qin Sang paused for a moment, opened his palm, and summoned the treasure. He admired it for a long time before letting out a hearty laugh and speeding away, clearly very satisfied with the result.</p><p>Not long after he left, the Void Spirit Sect was abuzz with activity. Disciples rushed to spread the news that Qin Sang would soon open an altar to preach the Dao.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Disciples from the Void Spirit Sect, Yuan Shen Sect, and Qingyang Temple gathered at the Yuan Shen Sect. Whether they were skilled in artifact forging or not, none wanted to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>Li Yufu had already finished handling his miscellaneous tasks and was waiting at the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, Mei Gu, Tan Yi’en, and others arrived one after another.</p><p>"Senior Brother, I heard that Master will only speak about the art of artifact forging this time, not touching on other topics?" Mei Gu, who had been traveling in the desert, hurried back after receiving Li Yufu’s message.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was somewhat disappointed. "He won’t speak about the Sword Dao?"</p><p>After Qin Sang had passed the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" to him, he had been left to comprehend it on his own. Even when Qin Sang occasionally offered guidance, it was always brief.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng knew Qin Sang was tempering him, but he wasn’t sure what level he needed to reach to meet Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>"That’s right. This time, it’s only about artifact forging. But don’t worry. In a few years, Master will also open a Dao Field!"</p><p>Li Yufu revealed a mysterious smile.</p><p>Everyone quickly asked for details.</p><p>"According to the customs of the Northern Star Realm, when a Nascent Soul Patriarch establishes a sect and invites fellow cultivators to witness the ceremony, they must offer at least three days of public preaching as a gesture of gratitude. At that time, the gates will be wide open, and countless cultivators will gather. It will be a grand event. Today is just a preview!"</p><p>Seeing the excitement on Mei Gu and the others’ faces, Li Yufu chuckled and continued, "The art of artifact forging is also a great Dao. If you can gain some insights, it will greatly benefit your future cultivation. That’s why I called you back so urgently."</p><p>...</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>On a mountain in front of the Yuan Shen Sect’s forbidden land.</p><p>Disciples from the three sects gathered on the mountain, sitting or standing. There were Qi Refining, Foundation Building, and Golden Core cultivators everywhere, creating a spectacular scene.</p><p>Even Bing Han and Qing Jun had come out of seclusion to attend.</p><p>The mountain was eerily quiet as everyone held their breath, eagerly watching the empty stone platform at the summit.</p><p>At that moment, a surge of demonic energy rose from outside the Yuan Shen Sect. Jing Yu, leading the demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, had also come to listen to the Dao.</p><p>Seeing the group of powerful demons, the disciples of the Yuan Shen Sect and Void Spirit Sect were thrown into chaos, while Li Yufu and the others warmly welcomed them.</p><p>Purple qi rose from the east.</p><p>A figure appeared on the stone platform out of thin air.</p><p>Li Yufu stepped forward and said, "We respectfully welcome Master to preach the Great Dao of Artifact Forging!"</p><p>Everyone bowed in unison.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the stone platform, nodding to his senior sister, Jing Yu, and Bing Han. His gaze then fell on the disciples of the three sects as he said calmly, "Today, I will only speak about artifact forging."</p>
