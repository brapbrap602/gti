<h1>Chapter 699: Nascent Soul Cave</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist Fan was actually able to invite Fellow Daoist Qin. It seems this trip will be worry-free,” the scholar in blue smiled kindly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened slightly. He cupped his hands and replied, “You flatter me, Fellow Daoist. I’m still unsure why Fellow Daoist Fan invited me here. I haven’t agreed to anything yet.”</p><p>The stout cultivator quickly said, “Fellow Daoist Qin, please come onto the island and wait a moment. Once the other Daoists arrive, I will explain everything. As long as you agree, I promise to fulfill the conditions I offered.”</p><p>Qin Sang considered this. He flew over on his sword, eyes gleaming, confirming there were no anomalies on the island, before landing on a reef, keeping his distance from them.</p><p>The scholar in blue exchanged a few pleasantries with Qin Sang, but seeing Qin Sang's indifferent expression, he wisely stopped talking.</p><p>After a while, three more people arrived, all cultivators Qin Sang had seen at the market.</p><p>Qin Sang observed them dispassionately, noting that these were all elites among early Core Formation cultivators. Each possessed considerable strength. It seemed the stout cultivator had ambitious plans.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Fan, you’ve invited so many of us here. Can you tell us what this is about now?” someone asked impatiently, as night fell.</p><p>The stout cultivator said apologetically, “Fellow Daoist Qian, don’t be anxious. There’s one more Daoist who hasn’t arrived yet. They should be here soon. When everyone is present, I will explain everything without reservation.”</p><p>As he spoke, a streak of azure light suddenly flew in from the distance, also stopping outside the island. A thin, elderly man appeared.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Wan is here!” The stout cultivator’s face lit up with joy.  Just as he went out to greet him, he heard the thin elder shout angrily, "Fan, you said you invited me here to search for treasure together. Now you’ve gathered so many people to ambush me here. What is the meaning of this?"</p><p>The stout cultivator quickly explained, and the thin elder reluctantly flew onto the island.</p><p>Now, seven Core Formation cultivators had gathered on the island, enough to form a small trading assembly.  Everyone looked at the stout cultivator, curious about his intentions.</p><p>It went without saying that the stout cultivator must have paid a significant price to persuade so many people to come. Whatever he was after must be worth the reward.</p><p>The stout cultivator cleared his throat, and without further ado, said solemnly, “I have invited you all here today to ask for your help in breaking a restriction.”</p><p>“A restriction?”</p><p>“What kind of restriction?”</p><p>“Could it be an ancient restriction? Is there a legendary ancient secret realm in the Demon Sea that you’ve discovered?”</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, everyone was intrigued by the stout cultivator’s words and bombarded him with questions.</p><p>Even the thin elder, who had been scowling, now wore an expression of excitement.</p><p>After the two races of cultivators advanced into the Demon Sea, they were nearly overwhelmed by the beast tides due to the demons' superior strength.  They barely managed to hold onto Great Wilderness Island and Skywitch Island.  Even after gaining a foothold, they occupied only a small area of the Demon Sea and constantly faced the threat of beast tides.  They had never discovered any legendary ancient secret realms in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Some suspected that before the Demon Sea was discovered, it might have always been the domain of demonic beasts, with no cultivator activity. This was why there were no traces left by ancient cultivators.</p><p>Hearing that the stout cultivator was asking for help to break a restriction, everyone was surprised and greatly interested.</p><p>The stout cultivator waved his hands repeatedly, "Fellow Daoists, you misunderstand. It's not an ancient secret realm. I suspect it’s the cave dwelling of a senior cultivator…"</p><p>“A senior cultivator’s cave dwelling?”  Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>The thin elder sneered, “These temporary cave dwellings are everywhere. Who would be foolish enough to leave anything valuable inside? Aren't you afraid of being disappointed?”</p><p>The scholar in blue frowned in thought for a moment, then said in a deep voice, “Since you’re willing to pay such a high price for our help, you must have sensed something, right? Whose cave dwelling is it?”</p><p>The stout cultivator nodded, “To be honest with you all, the cave dwelling’s restriction actually has three layers. I’ve racked my brains and only managed to break two of them.  The third layer, no matter how I try, remains unshakeable. I originally planned to return and ask my friends for help, but unfortunately, this incident happened, and they are all trapped on Hutian Island. I had no choice but to take this drastic measure and take advantage of the market opening to invite you all to assist me. Even with only two layers of the restriction open, I've discovered some things that suggest the cave dwelling’s owner might be someone of considerable importance. I’m taking this risk, even if it means losing everything, because I want to gamble.”</p><p>The thin elder scoffed, “Who is this cave dwelling’s owner? Fellow Daoist Fan is being so secretive. Could it be a Nascent Soul ancestor?”</p><p>The thin elder’s laughter gradually faded as he noticed the stout cultivator looking at him strangely. His face stiffened, and he asked in disbelief, “Is it really a Nascent Soul cave dwelling?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say,” the stout cultivator shook his head. “I believe I have some skill.  A restriction that I, with all my efforts, can’t even budge must have been set by someone at least at the peak of Core Formation.  Moreover, I found something in the cave dwelling…”</p><p>As he spoke, the stout cultivator took out a decaying fish skin.</p><p>The fish skin was clearly severely corroded, as if it would tear apart with the slightest touch.  The originally tight scales were now patchy, many having fallen off.</p><p>Seeing this almost formless fish skin, everyone's expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The scholar in blue swallowed hard, his voice trembling slightly, “The hide of a Transformation stage demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang also stared intently at the fish skin.  Even in its decayed state, the aura of the demon from its lifetime still lingered, making his heart pound. Qin Sang had only felt this kind of instinctive awe and pressure from Nascent Soul ancestors!</p><p>The hide of a Transformation stage demon!</p><p>It was the first time he had ever seen such a thing.</p><p>Everyone was stunned into silence, staring blankly at the fish skin.</p><p>The stout cultivator nodded.  "As you can all see, I found this hide in the cave dwelling.  I was ecstatic at the time, but unfortunately, the hide only had a simple restriction on it, which had long since failed due to the passage of time. Even the hide of a Transformation stage demon couldn't escape the ravages of time. You all understand how terrifying a Transformation stage demon is. Such a large piece of hide, even a Nascent Soul ancestor would treasure it.  Conversely, someone who would treat it so casually must be a Nascent Soul ancestor."</p><p>The hide was decayed and no longer of any use.</p><p>The stout cultivator casually handed it to the person next to him, and it was passed around.</p><p>When it was Qin Sang’s turn, he took it in his hands, carefully stroking the hide. He had seen a live Transformation stage demon in the Small Cold Realm, but this was the first time he had seen a dead one.</p><p>The hide was not fake; this unique aura could not be imitated.</p><p>The stout cultivator said in a deep voice, “Do you believe me now?”</p><p>The thin elder reluctantly returned the fish skin to the stout cultivator and tentatively asked, “Since there’s even the hide of a Transformation stage demon inside, you must have gained quite a bit, right? Surely not everything inside is as decayed as the hide. Why don’t you let us have a look?”</p>
