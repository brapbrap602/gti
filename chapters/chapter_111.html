<h1>Chapter 104: The Year the Peach Blossoms Bloomed</h1><p>“That senior's Dharma name was Qingzhu. His experience was quite similar to Junior Brother Qin's. He was originally a rogue cultivator and later joined Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu achieved Foundation Establishment and then formed his Core in just forty years, the fastest in our sect's history, a record that remains unbroken to this day. However, it's unclear why he later became half-mad and was placed under confinement by the sect.</p><p>It's said that Senior Qingzhu, enraged for the sake of a woman, cleaved this mountain with a single sword stroke, breaking through the formation and leaving behind Sword Gate Pass. There must be a fascinating story behind it, but unfortunately, it's all rumors and legends; no one knows the truth.</p><p>Miraculously, after Senior Qingzhu's departure, the spiritual herbs and flowers on the mountain withered, damaged by the sword Qi, leaving the area desolate.  Only the patch of Red Jade Peach trees remained not only unharmed but thrived even more vigorously.</p><p>That year, during the Diao Xiao season, the peach blossoms bloomed brilliantly, enduring even the harsh winter, and bore fruit after three years.</p><p>After this incident, although the Red Jade Peaches are mundane fruits, their sweetness surpasses all other spiritual fruits. Whenever they ripen, many senior uncles emerge from seclusion to pick and savor them.”</p><p>Standing on his flying artifact, Senior Brother Zhuang gazed towards Sword Gate Pass, lost in the legend of Senior Qingzhu, his face filled with yearning.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, envied Senior Qingzhu's talent even more. Reaching Core Formation from Foundation Establishment in just forty years was an astonishing feat. Even those blessed with Heavenly Spiritual Roots, who typically lacked the Core Formation bottleneck, would still meticulously prepare and seclude themselves for many years, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly steady Senior Brother Zhuang had such a romantic side. Qin Sang chimed in, “Is that Senior Qingzhu still in the sect?”</p><p>Senior Brother Zhuang shook his head regretfully. "Senior Qingzhu left after splitting the mountain and never returned. The senior uncles and grand uncles also avoid mentioning him. There are rumors that he was seen in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, but they were never confirmed. It's been many years since anyone has heard from him. If Senior Qingzhu hasn't reached Nascent Soul, he's probably…"</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent. The path of cultivation was truly a case of countless fallen for a single victor.</p><p>With Senior Qingzhu's talent, all that remained of him was the legend of Sword Gate Pass. If he, Qin Sang, perished on this path, probably no one would remember him either.</p><p>"This is Pagoda Peak."</p><p>Senior Brother Zhuang turned and pointed to a distant mountain peak.</p><p>This mountain was quite peculiar.  Atop it stood a massive stone pagoda.  A closer look revealed that the pagoda was carved directly from the mountain's peak itself, with several smaller pagodas dotted along its slopes.</p><p>Senior Brother Zhuang explained that Pagoda Peak was where Shaohua Mountain stored its cultivation techniques, spells, and various scriptures. Qin Sang quickly committed this to memory.</p><p>He still didn't know what kind of spiritual herb the mysterious orchid he had brought was.  He would have to visit Pagoda Peak when he had the chance; perhaps he could find information about it in Shaohua Mountain's records.</p><p>“Qi Refining disciples can access the first floor of Pagoda Peak with their identity tokens, but there's a spiritual stone fee. Taking anything out of Pagoda Peak incurs an additional charge.  This also applies to attending lectures by senior brothers and uncles at Dao Discourse Peak. Everything costs spiritual stones. But don't worry, Junior Brother Qin. Once you've been assigned chores within the sect, you'll receive a monthly stipend, enough to support your cultivation. This is one of the benefits of being a sect disciple.  You understand the hardships of a rogue cultivator better than I do, Junior Brother Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang then inquired about the types of chores available in Shaohua Mountain. He had learned his lesson at Yuanzhao Sect and was determined to avoid any chores that were too time-consuming.</p><p>Without Yu Hua's support, he couldn't afford to squander spiritual stones setting up spirit-gathering formations.</p><p>Having plundered Zhao Yan's storage pouch, he was now relatively well-off.  He set aside a mid-grade spiritual stone for emergencies.  The rest should be enough to support his cultivation.  Finding a less demanding chore and focusing on cultivation was the right path.</p><p>Senior Brother Zhuang told Qin Sang not to rush. Instead, he took him on a tour of Shaohua Mountain, introducing him to the various peaks as they flew on their swords from Dao Discourse Peak inwards.</p><p>Qi Refining disciples were restricted to the area around Dao Discourse Peak.  The inner peaks were mostly forbidden zones, strictly off-limits.</p><p>"This is Pure Moon Peak, where Fairy Chenyan is in seclusion."</p><p>Following Senior Brother Zhuang's gesture, Qin Sang saw a small, unassuming mountain among the range.  However, it possessed a unique elegance, adorned with lush forests, bamboo groves, and streams that shimmered like jewels.</p><p>Throughout their journey, Senior Brother Zhuang mentioned Fairy Chenyan more than once.  Qin Sang was tired of hearing about her.</p><p>In Senior Brother Zhuang's words, Fairy Chenyan was peerlessly beautiful and possessed an ethereal aura, practically a celestial being. He stopped just short of calling her a fairy descended from the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang asked Senior Brother Zhuang if he had ever seen her in person.  To his surprise, it turned out that he was infatuated with her based solely on a portrait.  Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>When he had previously reminded himself of his immortal path and to forget worldly matters, where had that sanctimonious senior brother gone?</p><p>Fairy Chenyan's talent was even more enviable than her beauty. It was said that she possessed a Heavenly Spiritual Root, and her cultivation had already reached the late Gold Core stage. In order to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, she had been in secluded cultivation on Jingyue Peak for over twenty years.</p><p>Several hundred years old, right? Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>The two wandered for a long time, finally paying their respects at the foot of Shaohua Mountain. The name of the Shaohua Sect was derived from this mountain, and the sect's only Nascent Soul ancestor, Duke Dongyang's cave, was located within this mountain.</p><p>After returning to Daomen Peak, Senior Brother Zhuang took Qin Sang to a neighboring mountain and settled him in a hut.  "Junior Brother Qin," he said, "if you have nothing else to do, would you like to come with me to choose your assigned duties?"</p><p>The two flew towards Daomen Peak.  On the way, they encountered several senior brothers and sisters who were all hurrying along.  Upon inquiring, Qin Sang learned that a senior uncle skilled in spells was going to hold a Dharma assembly that evening.</p><p>As they were talking, a gust of wind suddenly struck from behind. Qin Sang quickly dodged, and a swift streak of light passed him by.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, holding back from saying anything.  However, the streak of light returned. A square-faced young man, standing on a magical artifact, looked at the two and said with a smile, "So it's Junior Brother Zhuang Yan. This junior brother looks unfamiliar.  May I ask your name?"</p><p>"This is Senior Brother Sun De," Zhuang Yan introduced Qin Sang.  "Senior Brother Sun, Junior Brother Qin Sang has just joined the sect under Master Wen's decree with a Sword Intent.  I was instructed to guide him through the introductory process.  It's normal that you haven't met."</p><p>Sun De suddenly understood.  "I was wondering why someone would join the sect at this time. Junior Brother Qin, I was just rushing to Daomen Peak to listen to our senior uncle's Dharma lecture. I was reckless and almost bumped into you.  Please don't take offense."</p><p>He then cupped his hands apologetically.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang naturally no longer minded and returned the gesture.  "Senior Brother Sun, you are too kind."</p><p>Sun De's eyes darted around, and he asked with a smile, "Junior Brother Qin, since you've just joined, have you chosen your assigned duties yet?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Zhuang Yan said, "I was just about to take Junior Brother Qin to Daomen Peak to choose."</p><p>"Then Junior Brother Qin, don't be fooled by Junior Brother Zhuang. If you're not short on spirit stones, don't choose those notoriously exploitative duties, or you'll regret it!"</p><p>Sun De laughed heartily and, ignoring Zhuang Yan's disgruntled protests, flew off.</p>
