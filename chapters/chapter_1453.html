<h1>Chapter 1445: Sand Escape Technique</h1><p>Chapter 1445: Sand Escape Technique</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang decided to give it a try.  "I have a fragment of a very difficult secret technique."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang quickly produced a blank jade slip and inscribed the first layer of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" onto it.</p><p>"Sigh, I've fallen to the point of selling secret techniques for a living,"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He wouldn't share such a top-tier secret technique unless absolutely necessary, lest he cultivate a rival.</p><p>However, obtaining the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" would be worth it.</p><p>He didn't deliberately conceal its flaws, as the other party could easily see them.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand slightly, the jade slip floating forward, passing through a restriction he had personally laid, and floated in mid-air alongside the Gloomthorn.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't release his spiritual sense, adding, "I don't need cultivation techniques. If you're interested, I'd like to exchange it for an earth-elemental escape technique."</p><p>The other party understood, chuckled, and said indifferently, "A fragmented secret technique, and extremely difficult to cultivate. I'm only worried that my aptitude is too dull to even begin to understand it!"</p><p>With that, the person sent a strand of spiritual sense over.</p><p>Qin Sang hid the core content and allowed only the person to view it.</p><p>After a moment.</p><p>The person suddenly made a surprised sound, attracting the curiosity of others.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, the person solemnly said, "This secret technique is indeed extraordinary, but the flaws are unbelievably large!  When you obtained this secret technique, were there any other items nearby?"</p><p>The other party had guessed that the technique was too dangerous and there might be auxiliary cultivation techniques or items.</p><p>He didn't directly refuse. Did he also possess some kind of spirit fire, or did he have confidence in avoiding the dangers?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He used the excuse he'd prepared, "This technique is a treasure of my sect. If there were such things, why would I focus my efforts on another path? After all, compared to this flaw, there's always a chance of fulfilling the second condition."</p><p>The second condition referred to the spirit fire; given enough time, one could slowly collect various spirit fires to refine Fire Lotus Seeds.</p><p>'Another path' referred to body cultivation.</p><p>According to the understanding of most Nascent Soul cultivators, when encountering bottlenecks in cultivation, some might try to improve their physical body and spiritual sense to find a breakthrough.</p><p>But even the most talented individuals with exceptional spiritual roots couldn't balance the three aspects of spirit, energy, and body.</p><p>Qin Sang made it clear that he desperately wanted the "Seven Master Buddha Seal," indicating he had already reached a high level in body cultivation.  It must be that his spiritual sense path was blocked; otherwise, why would he possess a top-tier spiritual sense secret technique and not cultivate it?</p><p>This was perfectly reasonable.</p><p>Who could imagine that Qin Sang, relying on the Jade Buddha, had cultivated several techniques that seemed impossible to others, forging a unique path!</p><p>After a long silence.</p><p>The other party, after much consideration, finally spoke, producing a jade slip, "I have a "Sand Escape Technique," but it's not top-tier and might not meet your requirements."</p><p>This person isn't simple. He really wants to buy the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus"!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and after getting the agreement of the other party and Venerable Chongtai, he invited the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" to join the transaction.</p><p>After examining the "Sand Escape Technique," the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" hesitated for a moment and asked Qin Sang, "Are you a body cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and answered evasively, "Don't be too greedy."</p><p>The owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" fell silent for a moment, then resolutely stated, "The "Sand Escape Technique" plus the Gloomthorn, in exchange for the "Seven Master Buddha Seal"!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>His actions had both advantages and disadvantages. It dispelled one person's doubts, but gave the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" the confidence to ask for a high price.</p><p>"These old guys are all shrewd as ghosts; they wouldn't let me get a bargain here."</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang let go of his worries, glanced at the clusters of white light around them, and said, "Add two drops of Sky Crown Heavy Liquid!"</p><p>"One drop!"</p><p>"Deal!"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. Regardless of how the owner of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" obtained the Sky Crown Heavy Liquid, he turned to negotiate with the other person.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, the other party said, "Well, even if it's fragmented, this secret technique is worth far more than the "Sand Escape Technique." What else do you want?"</p><p>This person was quite straightforward.</p><p>Qin Sang softened his tone, "Help me exchange it for that piece of Blue Dot Gold, or the flocculent cloud crystal."</p><p>The onlookers watched silently. They guessed Qin Sang was preparing to refine a magic treasure, but although the three materials had similar properties, they couldn't be mixed like that. It truly baffled them.</p><p>After a dizzying exchange.</p><p>The jade slip and Gloomthorn in front of Qin Sang's bamboo building disappeared.</p><p>He had three things in his hands.</p><p>A jade slip.</p><p>A fist-sized piece of black Blue Dot Gold with blue spots.</p><p>And a jade bottle containing a drop of silver liquid, which felt even heavier in his hand than the Blue Dot Gold.</p><p>He checked the jade slip, quickly scanning its contents.  Confirming the spell was correct, he put it away without a detailed examination.</p><p>His transaction was the most complex of the fair so far, involving six Yuan Ying cultivators because the owner of the *Floating Sand Escape Technique* added an extra step when exchanging it for Blue Dot Gold.</p><p>All parties were very satisfied with the deal.</p><p>Zhonghou Venerable was particularly pleased, smiling and saying, "Next, please!"</p><p>Then, three bamboo towers exited.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his jade token, thinking he hadn't arrived late, yet it wasn't his turn.</p><p>A voice from outside drifted in: "A Locked Void Sword, in exchange for a top-grade treasure!"</p><p>At this, Qin Sang looked outside.</p><p>Even at the Wan Mo Conference, top-grade treasures weren't common.</p><p>Within a white light, a jade sword, about the size of a finger, hovered.</p><p>The sword was pure white, without any markings.</p><p>The moment he saw it, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity. It was the small jade sword from the corpse in the Buddha Hall!</p><p>"Hunmo Elder or Yu Yi Yuanjun?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, as if trying to see through the darkness into the bamboo tower.</p><p>He had already learned that besides Hunmo Elder, a female cultivator with the dharma name Yu Yi Yuanjun had entered the Buddha Hall.  The remaining treasures from the Buddha Hall must have fallen into their hands.</p><p>A top-grade treasure!</p><p>If he'd known it was a top-grade treasure, he wouldn't have bothered refining the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, then heard someone question, "That's clearly a high-grade treasure. Why are you asking for a top-grade treasure in exchange?"</p><p>A calm, even laugh came from within the bamboo tower, in response to the question.  "I dare to ask this price, naturally, for a reason. This sword is not only a high-grade treasure, but it also holds an unknown secret, which I haven't yet been able to unlock. For the right person, its value will certainly surpass that of a top-grade treasure, perhaps even greatly exceeding it!"</p><p>This statement caused an uproar.  The audacity of someone demanding such a high price for a secret they couldn't solve themselves was ridiculous!</p><p>Though curious, Qin Sang didn't bother to investigate with his spiritual sense, observing from the sidelines.</p>
