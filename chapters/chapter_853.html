<h1>Chapter 845: Leaving the Island</h1><p>Qin Sang, despite his slightly lower cultivation, was on par with them in swordsmanship.  Sword light differentiation is the lifelong pursuit of sword cultivators; only a very small number of late-stage Golden Core cultivators achieve it, all of them renowned Grand Sword Masters. No one dared to underestimate such a cultivator.</p><p>The two seated beside him bowed slightly to Qin Sang in greeting.  Yue Xiangu sat upright and said seriously, “Daoist Qingfeng is a master of the sword, I admire you.  Daoist Zou’s words are true, you have the strength to fight a late-stage Golden Core cultivator! However…”</p><p>Pausing slightly, Yue Xiangu continued, “Forgive my bluntness, my goal is to rescue someone, to bring them back to Great Desolation Island alive.  Your swordsmanship alone may not be enough.”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and looked at Old Man Zou.  Old Man Zou also looked a little helpless.</p><p>Sword cultivators are indeed incredibly strong and awe-inspiring. But the gap caused by insufficient cultivation is all-encompassing. If they were simply looking for a fighter, Qin Sang would be the perfect choice, but Yue Xiangu's goal was to find someone, so her words were not unreasonable.</p><p>Old Man Zou shrugged at Qin Sang, indicating his helplessness.</p><p>The chance to obtain the Maoshan Vine and return to the Canglang Sea was rare, and Qin Sang was unwilling to give it up. He bowed his head slightly, pondering for a moment before saying, “I also have some skill in escape techniques, and I believe I won't let my fellow Daoists down in times of crisis…”</p><p>As he spoke, a red glow surged from Qin Sang's body, with the faint image of a dragon appearing, competing with a sharp sword. Then, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of rainbow light, accompanied by a clap of thunder, shooting out of the hall.  He circled briefly outside before returning.</p><p>The red glow dissipated, the dragon image vanished, the thunder subsided, and Qin Sang reappeared in his original place. This instantly displayed escape technique left the four people in the hall looking grave and silently shocked.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully considered this; he decided to reveal his escape techniques to impress Yue Xiangu.  In a rescue operation, top-tier escape techniques would be extremely effective, he believed Yue Xiangu wouldn't refuse after seeing this.</p><p>He possessed several valuable treasures; any one of them would likely gain acceptance, but those were his trump cards, and would easily arouse the greed of others.</p><p>The Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman was hidden in his dantian, concealed by sword energy and thunder sounds. As long as it wasn't exposed for too long, he believed they wouldn't be able to see through its true nature.  If these people couldn't figure out his background, they wouldn't dare to have any evil thoughts.</p><p>Sure enough, after seeing Qin Sang's escape technique, Yue Xiangu's face lit up with joy. She immediately agreed to let Qin Sang join them and entrusted him with an important task.  “Daoist, your escape technique is superb, I am in awe! With you joining us, I'm finally relieved! Once we find that person, I hope you will be willing to provide close protection.  If surrounded by demonic beasts, you must take her and escape first if necessary!”</p><p>Hearing Yue Xiangu's words, Qin Sang was secretly surprised.</p><p>He wondered who they were rescuing; Yue Xiangu valued the person's life more than her own, willing to be the one to cover their retreat if things turned dangerous. Qin Sang was curious, but he didn't ask further, agreeing to Yue Xiangu's request. Then he changed the subject, saying, “Daoist Yue, for the Maoshan Vine and the transmission talisman, I am risking my life to enter the depths of the demon sea to save someone. If that person has already met with an accident, and we can’t find them…”</p><p>“Payment will still be made!”</p><p>Yue Xiangu decisively stated, “I will deposit the treasures at the Xiang'an Auction House, and we will make a sworn agreement with all of you. Even if we don't find the target, payment will still be made!”</p><p>Old Man Zou stroked his beard and smiled, “It was worth the effort, everyone must have many more things to discuss, I won't disturb you, I'll take my leave!”</p><p>After Old Man Zou left, Qin Sang remained at Yue Xiangu's cave dwelling. Yue Xiangu intended to find three late-stage Golden Core cultivators to help; with Qin Sang's addition, the number was complete. After getting to know each other, they made a sworn agreement and discussed their departure time.</p><p>Currently, Great Desolation Island was besieged by demonic beasts, with transformed demonic beasts everywhere. Leaving the island would be their first hurdle.</p><p>“The demons are arrogant and rampant. I just arrived from the Inner Sea and learned that a senior was angered by them and decided to take the initiative to attack, giving them a lesson. The time is set for three days later; we can take advantage of the chaos to leave.  You all should wait for my news; when the time comes, we'll set off immediately!” Yue Xiangu had obtained confidential information and had already made her plans.</p><p>“Departure in three days, the time is so urgent… The high-level cultivators are going to attack, and there is no news at all. Taking the opportunity to leave and avoid this battle is good…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these thoughts, returned to his cave dwelling, and continued patrolling.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The four of them gathered on a small island north of Great Desolation Island, having created a cave dwelling underground, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Human experts will launch a surprise attack at midnight, focusing on the south. This will draw most of the beasts there, allowing Qin Sang and the others to escape from the north during the ensuing chaos.</p><p>Inside the dark cave, the four remained silent.</p><p>Besides Qin Sang and Yue Xiangu, the other two were men: a middle-aged man and an old man whose appearance was not much younger than Yue Xiangu.</p><p>The middle-aged man was Kong Yun, a member of the Dongji Alliance Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>The old man, who called himself Zhushan Weng, was actually an elder from a sect in the Inner Sea. He was recruited as a guest elder by a chamber of commerce while traveling in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, they were all attracted by Yue Xiangu's treasure.</p><p>Both men possessed profound true energy and formidable strength, not to be underestimated. Of course, Qin Sang's demonstrated abilities also commanded their respect, fostering a harmonious atmosphere among them.</p><p>"Midnight!"</p><p>Yue Xiangu whispered.  The group dashed to the cave entrance, gazing south.  Suddenly, several brilliant auroras lit up the southern sky, bright as day.</p><p>The stars were obscured by the aurora; even the moon seemed dimmed.</p><p>From their distance, they could only witness this spectacle, their faces filled with awe.</p><p>Immediately after the aurora appeared, they sensed several terrifying auras rushing south, and the surrounding beasts grew restless, gathering towards the south.</p><p>The aurora lasted for a full cup of tea's time.  Then, shimmering lights clashed and chased each other across the sky in all directions; chaos had spread.</p><p>At Yue Xiangu's command, the four immediately set off, silently heading north.</p><p>Reaching the outer perimeter, they heard the sounds of battle—beasts attacking the subsidiary island, engaging the cultivators in a fierce melee.  Exchanging a glance, the four concealed their auras and slipped into the fray.</p><p>All four were powerful individuals. To avoid attracting the attention of powerful demons, they were restrained in their attacks.  However, working together, they encountered little danger and successfully broke through.</p><p>After escaping danger, they all looked to Yue Xiangu.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yue Xiangu showed no sign of stopping, leading them directly north.</p><p>Even before the unrest, cultivator forces were weak in the north of the Great Waste Island, having explored little of that area.  It was said that a powerful demon tribe resided in the north, and cultivators had avoided provoking them. Yet, the person Yue Xiangu sought was there, explaining why she brought so many experts to rescue him.</p>
