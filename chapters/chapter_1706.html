<h1>Chapter 1697: Firefly</h1><p>The Poison Beads, including the previously acquired Fat Silkworm, had limited use due to their singular function.</p><p>Once he gained poison control, it would be a different story.</p><p>Then there was the *Heavenly Absolute Soul-Shattering Divine Needles* obtained from the Strange-Faced Man. Qin Sang vividly remembered the needles’ power. If he could refine them using the poison from the Poison Beads, it would become another extremely lethal technique.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He immediately consulted Ghost Mother about refining the Poison Beads, learning that both refining the beads and absorbing the Gu King were long-term endeavors, requiring patience and gradual progress.</p><p>Next, they discussed setting off as soon as possible to send his true body to Deer Wilderness for healing, lest any unforeseen complications arise.</p><p>More importantly, Ghost Mother's preparations were almost complete. She herself was eager to begin, waiting only for Dumb Aunt's condition to stabilize before traversing the void.</p><p>There was no time to lose.</p><p>That very night, everyone decided to depart.</p><p>They deliberately avoided the Central Plains and the territories of the major Immortal Sects, choosing treacherous and difficult terrain to avoid attention.</p><p>Apart from Qin Sang's injured true body, Ghost Mother, Liu Li, and his avatar were all peak cultivators. The hardships and obstacles along the way posed no real challenge. They traversed the land as if walking on flat ground, smoothly arriving at the Northern Wilderness.</p><p>The Northern Wilderness was vast and sparsely populated, a melting pot of various factions. Reaching this point meant they were essentially safe. As long as they didn't directly encounter Nascent Soul cultivators from the two races, Qin Sang's true body's safety was practically guaranteed.</p><p>Shen Chen had moved Deer Wilderness nearby earlier.  They located the "anchor point," boarded Deer Wilderness, and vanished without a trace.</p><p>The cultivators of the Northern Wilderness were completely unaware that a colossal object was drifting above them. Observing its direction, it was surprisingly heading towards the Northern Sea.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang's return, Liu Li prepared to depart.</p><p>She and the nuns of Hidden Moon Convent had parted hastily.  Protecting Qin Sang afterward made contacting them difficult. She needed to return as soon as possible, delivering the inheritance of the Unfettered Immortal Sect to reassure everyone.</p><p>During this time, Liu Li specifically visited Dumb Aunt, but she hadn't yet awakened. Liu Li could only offer silent blessings.</p><p>She had already returned the Ice Instrument Divine Disc to Qin Sang.</p><p>Her and Qin Sang's avatar's foundations were similar, yet different.</p><p>The avatar followed Qin Sang's usual approach, prioritizing breakthroughs above all else, actively drawing closer to the Cold煞 Energy within the Ice Instrument Divine Disc.  Liu Li, however, steadfastly adhered to her own path, unwavering, only using the disc as a reference, thus spending less time comprehending the Cold煞 Energy.</p><p>Even so, she had gained considerable insights and was eager to return to secluded cultivation.</p><p>"This is the token for Deer Wilderness. The anchor point on the token will not change.  In the future, Fairy Liu Li only needs to hold this token to that location, and the Deer Wilderness grand formation will sense it."</p><p>Qin Sang's true body specifically emerged from seclusion, producing a black iron token and handing it to Liu Li. He continued, “I plan to set up a formation in Deer Wilderness, mimicking the Unfettered Immortal Sect's, to nurture the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, and to refine the Immortal Platform in preparation for Nascent Soul.  Being able to retrieve this formation from the Unfettered Immortal Sect was all thanks to Fairy Liu Li's assistance. Qin Sang wouldn't dare to keep it to myself.  After Fairy Liu Li’s breakthrough, please also remember to start preparing to refine the Ice-Fire Token."</p><p>He had obtained Elder Yanshan's memories from Su Zinan.</p><p>It turned out that the two ice boxes Elder Yanshan took from the snowy plains tomb contained the Water Phase Token in one, and records of the tribulation-crossing grand formation and a portion of the Water Phase inheritance in the other.</p><p>From this, Qin Sang learned the true names of the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, as well as the refining methods for the Taiji Immortal Platform and the Ice-Fire Token, saving himself the trouble of deciphering them.</p><p>After the current turmoil subsided, he could venture out to search for spirit materials for the refinement.</p><p>As for the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, as long as the grand formation was maintained and continuously replenished with power, not only could they protect one person during tribulation, but they could also benefit their relatives and descendants, serving as the foundation of a sect.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing immortal formation was nameless, commonly referred to as the "Three Disasters Crossing" by the Unfettered Immortal Sect. This formation was also pieced together by the Unfettered Immortal Sect using various treasures.  After verification, it proved to have protective power against the Three Disasters Tribulation and even had a certain effect against the Nascent Soul Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Of course, it could also be used for the Core Formation Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>However, because replenishing the energy of the two treasures took time, the Ice-Fire Token could only be used once, and the Taiji Immortal Platform also risked being destroyed during the Heavenly Tribulation. Moreover, the Ice-Fire Token and the Immortal Platform were extremely difficult to refine. The Unfettered Immortal Sect established a rule that only disciples who had reached Nascent Soul could utilize them.</p><p>Qin Sang often wondered if Cloud Traveler's fate would have been different had he possessed this formation during his tribulation.</p><p>He watched Liu Li depart.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, turning back to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He saw Ghost Mother, who had arrived at some point, leaning against a tree with her arms crossed, nodding towards Liu Li's departing figure.  "Gone?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Ghost Mother clicked her tongue, a little curious.  "Quite the Ice Beauty. How did you snag her, kid?"</p><p>Ghost Mother saw through the unusual dynamic between Qin Sang and Liu Li.</p><p>It wasn't that she sensed the demonic cultivation brand, but rather, in front of someone as perceptive as her, their awkwardness was simply too obvious.</p><p>Throughout this period, Ghost Mother found it quite uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then asked, "I've heard there are methods of cultivating through the Seven Emotions. But if the Seven Emotions become disordered and one is manipulated by them, how can one break free?"</p><p>With Ghost Mother's wisdom, she understood his implied meaning.  Her red lips curved slightly. "It's better to guide than to suppress."</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, thinking about Liu Li and the demonic cultivation brand.</p><p>He had just discussed this matter with Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother didn't have a better solution for the demonic cultivation brand.</p><p>Qin Sang understood what Ghost Mother meant, and he believed Liu Li would understand as well.</p><p>For instance, the husband-slaying cultivation technique of Duke Dongyang.</p><p>Utilizing the demonic cultivation brand for some purpose might not only resolve the problem but also bring benefits. Of course, Qin Sang wouldn’t sacrifice himself, but he could draw inspiration from this line of thought.</p><p>However, this was just their wishful thinking. After all, they couldn't truly empathize and didn't know the extent of the demonic cultivation brand's influence on Liu Li.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that Liu Li's refusal to accept his goodwill and her deliberate attempts to distance herself weren’t solely due to her resistance to the brand, but that she herself had developed a mental demon without realizing it.</p><p>This kind of inner demon could only be overcome through Liu Li's own understanding.  Qin Sang's rash intervention might be counterproductive.</p><p>A soft sigh echoed within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped dwelling on these troubling matters. With a wave of his hand, he retrieved all the belongings of the Witch Race Nascent Soul cultivator and laid them out before him.</p><p>Among the belongings, some treasures were common to both races, and Qin Sang, cultivating the Witch Race's Native Insect Gu technique, could utilize them. However, most were deeply imprinted with the Witch Race's mark and were set aside by Qin Sang.</p><p>After organizing, only two star platforms remained before him.</p><p>At Emperor Bestowal Mountain, Qin Sang worried that merging the platforms might cause unusual phenomena. He waited until now to attempt it. Deer Wilderness had already drifted into the uninhabited regions of the Northern Wilderness, so he didn't need to worry about any large-scale phenomena.</p><p>Qin Sang exited the cave dwelling, set up formations around the area, and placed the two star platforms flat before him.</p><p>Extending his hands, he positioned them above the two star platforms, sensing the connection between the platforms and the stars. The familiar feeling reminded him of the *Celestial Demon Body Refining* technique he had long neglected.</p><p>But he still wasn't ready to resume this practice. Instead, he continued refining Demonic Fire and cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. Healing wouldn't delay his divine sense refinement.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang brought his hands together, merging the star platforms.</p><p>Surprisingly, they instantly adhered to each other. A dazzling starlight erupted from within the crack, and the power of the two star platforms began to merge spontaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need to do anything.</p><p>The anticipated earth-shattering phenomena didn't occur.</p><p>Soon, the starlight dimmed. Qin Sang scrutinized them closely, discovering that the crack in the middle had vanished, becoming a single, seamless circular platform.</p><p>A faint starlight seemed to linger around the star platform, as always.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then his figure flickered as he sat cross-legged on top of the platform. Activating *Celestial Demon Body Refining*, he sensed that the speed of absorbing stellar power was faster than before, but there were no other changes.</p><p>Black Serpent Old Ancestor had dispatched his favored disciple to infiltrate a major human sect and steal a star platform, while the Witch Race Nascent Soul cultivator carried a star platform with him to the Central Continent. If the star platforms were so simple, such efforts seemed excessive.</p><p>Qin Sang had no clue how to unlock the star platform's secrets.</p><p>Until one day, Deer Wilderness drifted into the Northern Sea, stopping at a very ordinary stone island.</p><p>This place was located in the western part of the Northern Sea, equivalent to the northwest corner of the entire Central Continent. It was remote and constantly affected by storm belts, making it desolate and uninhabited. However, this was the ascension location chosen by Ghost Mother.</p><p>Ghost Mother activated the restrictions on Qin Sang's cave dwelling, bringing him news.</p><p>She had decided to immediately set up the formation, striving to ascend within a month.</p><p>Such haste, although Qin Sang was mentally prepared, still left him with a sense of melancholy. He welcomed Ghost Mother inside and took out the belongings of the Witch Race Nascent Soul cultivator, allowing her to choose.</p><p>Saying it was for Ghost Mother, it was more accurate to say it was for Dumb Aunt's protection.</p><p>Ghost Mother knew this well and didn't hold back.</p><p>"Quite a collection..."</p><p>Ghost Mother picked and chose, taking some and returning a few to Qin Sang.  "You're cultivating our race's Native Insect Gu. Refine these according to my instructions, and they'll be useful.  Like this Purification Bead, after refining it, let your butterfly swallow it. You can jointly control this bead, sufficiently increasing its power.  And this Green Spirit Stake, the refining technique is too crude, but it has retained the properties of the Green Spirit Mushroom.  Extract it, and cultivating the *Panhu True Scripture*'s spirit nurturing method will be twice as effective..."</p><p>Ghost Mother generously offered guidance, and Qin Sang noted every detail.</p><p>Having obtained the *Panhu True Scripture*, but with his teacher about to ascend, Qin Sang could only memorize her words for now and comprehend them slowly later.</p><p>Next, elevating the Sky-Pupil Butterfly's realm was also a top priority.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang brought out the star platform and asked Ghost Mother to appraise it.</p><p>Returning to the Roiling Wave Sea was unrealistic at present.</p><p>Although he had obtained the sea chart, the storm belt was filled with rampaging ferocious beasts, making it extremely dangerous. Qin Sang couldn’t guarantee he’d be as lucky as last time.</p><p>In his hands, the star platform could only assist in cultivating *Celestial Demon Body Refining* and couldn't trigger the influx of stellar power for breakthroughs. It didn't live up to his expectations and was like a hidden pearl covered in dust.</p><p>If the star platform could aid in breaking through to Nascent Soul, hoarding it would be foolish.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Ghost Mother took the star platform, examining it from all angles, her brows furrowing. "Are you certain this is something from our race?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, and he explained the origins of the two star platforms in detail.</p><p>Ghost Mother pondered for a moment, then said, "Our race has numerous divine abilities and treasures related to stellar power, but in my memory, there's nothing with a similar fluctuation to this star platform. Of course, not only was my cultivation base sealed, but my memories are also severely fragmented.  This part might have been erased. The Witch Race in the Upper Realm seems to have different clans, each with distinct inheritances.  It might be a treasure from a particular clan, perhaps related to the bloodline of the Roiling Wave Sea's main branch.  However, in my opinion, two other possibilities are more likely…"</p><p>"One is that this treasure is unrelated to our race. I remember you mentioning the incomplete inheritance of the Roiling Wave Sea Witch Race, forcing them to cultivate human techniques.  They might all be outsiders. Two, this treasure is incomplete, lacking a crucial component, which is why neither of us can activate the restrictions within the platform."</p><p>With that, Ghost Mother tossed the star platform back to Qin Sang.  Aside from traversing the void, nothing else piqued her interest.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the star platform, lost in thought. It seemed he’d have to wait until he returned to the Roiling Wave Sea to unravel the mystery.</p><p>…</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Stone Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ghost Mother stood side by side, gazing at a spring before them, their expressions solemn.</p><p>His avatar was patrolling the surroundings with the Nether Moon Guard, while Shen Chen had been instructed to move Deer Wilderness to a distance.</p><p>A bamboo bed floated in the spring. Dumb Aunt, dressed in ceremonial attire, lay serenely upon it, her hands folded over her chest, still asleep.</p><p>A faint image appeared on her forehead, the Fat Silkworm wriggling its fleshy body, seemingly bidding Qin Sang farewell.  It had been relentlessly tormented by Ghost Mother during this time, noticeably slimming down.</p><p>The spring water remained undisturbed.</p><p>An earthen platform had been erected around it, a grand formation laid out.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>"Begin," Ghost Mother said softly.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, taking one last look at Dumb Aunt before slowly retreating.</p><p>Ghost Mother ascended the sacrificial platform, gazing up at the sky.</p><p>It was already late at night, a moonless night with a sky full of stars.</p><p>Until midnight.</p><p>Ghost Mother lowered her gaze, nodded at Qin Sang, and suddenly raised her arms.</p><p>Without a sound, Qin Sang's heart pounded, drawn into a strange rhythm.</p><p>A sacrificial dance!</p><p>Ghost Mother raised her hands high, her body swaying, as if embracing the heavens.  She paused briefly before erupting into even more powerful movements.</p><p>Under the night sky, Ghost Mother's figure moved like a serpent, each movement carrying a unique rhythm, harmonizing with the natural world.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously held his breath, almost becoming immersed within it.  Suddenly, he heard the sound of wind and thunder. Looking up, he saw clouds gathering in the sky, lightning flashing, and then raindrops falling.</p><p>Heaven and earth were responding to Ghost Mother's sacrificial dance!</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>The pool remained undisturbed, while the sacrificial platform emitted a strange radiance, converging towards the bamboo bed, growing increasingly brighter, as if all the light between heaven and earth was shining upon Dumb Aunt!</p><p>Ghost Mother completed her final movement, stomping heavily on the platform.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The platform, the stone island, even the surrounding seawater trembled violently. Heaven and earth responded with thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly looked up, surprised to find that the starry river seemed to tremble as well, the stars momentarily flashing brightly.</p><p>The next moment, Ghost Mother's body stiffened, and a stream of light flew out from between her brows, instantly vanishing into Dumb Aunt's body.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the most crucial moment had arrived. He held his breath and watched as the light at the center of the platform grew increasingly blinding. The bamboo bed gradually turned transparent, fading into nothingness.</p><p>When the light reached its peak brilliance.</p><p>Dumb Aunt and the bamboo bed vanished abruptly.</p><p>"Next time we meet, remember to call her by her true name."</p><p>Ghost Mother's voice echoed beside Qin Sang, ethereal and faint, like a soft sigh.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the center of the platform and suddenly noticed a faint glimmer.</p><p>Like a firefly, it flew above his head, hovering there, reluctant to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, feeling a sudden coolness on his cheek.  He touched it with his finger, sensing moisture.  His heart tightened.</p><p>The next moment, the glimmer abruptly soared upwards, as fast as lightning, its speed exploding to a point beyond description.</p><p>In a mere blink, the glimmer shot into the sky, disappearing among the countless stars, vanishing without a trace.</p>
