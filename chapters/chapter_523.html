At this stage of corpse refinement, the Golden Core resided in the Qi Sea, only barely kept in check by the corpse refinement restrictions.  Disturbing the Qi Sea and disrupting the balance would cause the Golden Core to backfire.</p><p>With preparations complete, Qin Sang arrived at the gates of the Qingyang Demon Sect. He hid in the shadows, observing the sect.</p><p>Towering mountains, lush and verdant.</p><p>At the edge of the mountain range, clouds swirled, cranes sang, a scene of idyllic beauty, making one doubt if this was truly a Demon Sect's base.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect was divided into outer, inner, and restricted areas, each sealed by spirit formations.</p><p>The outer area served as a place for guests, housing the sect's spirit beasts, medicinal gardens, and other external facilities.</p><p>The mountains Qin Sang saw were those of the outer area of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>There were eight such mountains, arranged with remarkable regularity in eight directions around the sect.  One wondered if a powerful cultivator had used earth-moving techniques to arrange them, as such precision was otherwise improbable.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell upon a white jade staircase on the southernmost mountain, stretching straight to the summit, disappearing into the clouds.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's gate was hidden at the top of this staircase. To enter the sect, one must ascend this path.</p><p>Beyond the outer area lay the inner area, the training ground for the sect's disciples.</p><p>The restricted area was a section within the inner area, sealed by a powerful formation; the core of the Qingyang Demon Sect, heavily protected by restrictions. Fortunately, Qin Sang didn't need to enter this area; the Divine Yang Peak, where the Heavenly Yang Qi descended, was located within the inner area.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Qingyang Demon Sect, then found a secluded spot in the wilderness outside the mountain gate. He buried his belongings deep underground – his pouch, the corpse puppet pouch, and the spirit beast pouch – carefully concealing them with restrictions.</p><p>Even after doing this, Qin Sang remained uneasy, as his entire fortune was buried there. He carefully checked again before stealthily departing.</p><p>In the distance to the east, dawn broke, the sun about to rise.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his speed, heading directly southwest, flying through the mountains and forests.</p><p>He had strayed far from Qingyang Market, but Wuyaya Valley was near the Qingyang Demon Sect, and Qingyang Market was the largest market in the nearby cultivation world. He might encounter cultivators who liked to travel the wilderness, so Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>He crossed dozens of mountains and rivers without encountering a soul.</p><p>Arriving at a mountain pass, Qin Sang suddenly stopped.</p><p>West of the Qingyang Demon Sect lay a large human kingdom, one of many vassal states under the sect's control.</p><p>Continuing southwest, he would reach the border cities of this kingdom, one of which was called Qincheng, a city inhabited by ordinary people.</p><p>Qincheng was located on the border; to the east lay only wilderness, as it was near Wuyaya Valley, an area frequented by cultivators.</p><p>The mountain pass where Qin Sang found himself was the only route from Qincheng to the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Concealing his aura, he quietly descended into the pass. After surveying the area, he began to work, starting from the entrance.  He created the appearance of a severely injured cultivator who had barely escaped his pursuers, only to collapse and die here, leaving behind a trail of blood, disordered footprints, disrupted spiritual energy, and bent grass.</p><p>He placed the corpse at the end of the blood trail, hidden amongst the tall grass.</p><p>Combined with the modifications made to the corpse, this scene was so realistic that if one stumbled upon it unexpectedly, they would struggle to find any flaws.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang checked meticulously.  He appeared before the corpse and suddenly activated a surge of corpse energy, sending it coursing throughout his body.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang's appearance changed drastically.</p><p>Green-faced, fanged, and ferocious, he appeared as a genuine corpse puppet, his original features utterly obscured.</p><p>"Luckily, I can suppress the corpse energy and recover quickly afterwards. Otherwise, with this face, I'd be unable to move an inch in the cultivation world."</p><p>Qin Sang touched his cheek and muttered to himself.</p><p>Disguised as a corpse cultivator, he couldn't use restrictions to hide his face, so he had to rely on corpse energy to alter his appearance.  The reputation of the Shadowless Sword was known throughout the Turbulent Islands; Qin Sang was now somewhat famous, so there was a chance he might be recognized.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang carelessly tossed the coffin near the corpse and hid himself inside, patiently waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't choose the person who would take him to the Qingyang Demon Sect at random.  Having lived in Qingyang Market for twenty-eight years, Qin Sang lowered his guard as a high-level cultivator and frequently interacted with Qingyang Demon Sect disciples, building files on those he regularly spoke with.</p><p>He interacted less with those of higher cultivation and knew little about them. But he was very familiar with those below the Foundation Establishment stage, and a few early Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The person he chose was named Yu Batie, an early Foundation Establishment cultivator.  This man was quite talented and successfully reached Foundation Establishment, but he'd been stuck at the mid-Foundation Establishment bottleneck for decades, unable to break through—somewhat similar to Yu Daiyue back then.</p><p>However, his character was far inferior to Yu Daiyue's. Yu Daiyue eventually succumbed to inner demons and killed his fellow disciples, but even he had tried everything before being driven mad.</p><p>Qin Sang had interacted with Yu Batie many times. Yu Batie frequently complained and whined, always mentioning how others were favored by their masters or gained great opportunities and treasures.</p><p>Whenever he spoke of famous cultivators, he invariably attributed their achievements to luck, without exception, even for his well-known fellow disciples. Then he would lament his own bad luck, bemoan never receiving any decent opportunities, and curse the unfairness of Heaven for keeping him trapped in his bottleneck.</p><p>Yet, Yu Batie was not a dedicated cultivator. After a few days of secluded cultivation, he'd become restless and go out drinking and carousing, joining his fellow disciples on hunts in the Boundless Valley, always returning first.  He had never even been to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>He was also obsessed with worldly pleasures and lust, growing increasingly worse with age. He amassed beautiful women in Qincheng, and every so often, under the guise of training, he would spend a few days there enjoying himself.</p><p>Since Yu Batie craved opportunities, Qin Sang decided to give him one. Qin Sang calculated that today was the day Yu Batie would be returning from Qincheng after his indulgences.</p>
