<h1>Chapter 719: News</h1><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, and he vanished.</p><p>Concealing his aura, he quietly headed north, approaching Coldflame Island.</p><p>Coincidentally, just like the day he first came to Coldflame Island, it was now dusk, and the setting sun was blood-red.</p><p>Calculating the distance, Qin Sang estimated that Coldflame Island was not far ahead, so he stopped and flew higher.</p><p>When he vaguely saw the scene where Coldflame Island should be, Qin Sang's face suddenly went blank. He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was hallucinating, and subconsciously flew a bit further.</p><p>Finally seeing clearly, Qin Sang couldn't help but gasp.</p><p>He still remembered that when he was startled away by the swarm of demons, the Coldflame, though newly emerged, had already stabilized, occupying a deep pit in the middle of the island. Although other parts of the island were also affected, they weren't as thoroughly destroyed.</p><p>Now, Coldflame Island had completely disappeared!</p><p>Where Coldflame Island used to be, blue flames were still brilliantly burning. Around the original location, small blue flowers formed from the Coldflame were floating in the air and on the sea surface, like the river lanterns he had seen in the mortal world.</p><p>The setting sun in the west was blood-red, the clouds like fire, the Coldflame in the east remained, and the surroundings seemed to be encircled by a blue star belt.</p><p>A look of deep surprise appeared on Qin Sang's face. The Coldflame was still there, but it had scattered.</p><p>This was far beyond his expectations.</p><p>He thought the Coldflame had been subdued by a transformed demon, but it was still here, and even the transformed demon had returned empty-handed.</p><p>Why did the Coldflame split? Why did Coldflame Island disappear?</p><p>Gazing from afar, Qin Sang was puzzled. He looked carefully at the waters near Coldflame Island, but found nothing unusual, and the Concentric Rings didn't send any warnings.</p><p>With the transformed demon gone, even if there were other monsters nearby, escaping shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang boldly continued to approach.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang got close to the Coldflame. He could see more clearly with the naked eye that after the Coldflame split, each flame remained stable, floating in the air or on the water, neither extinguishing nor drifting.</p><p>"Incredible!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He waited for a while, then continued to approach, this time more cautiously and slowly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after flying only a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly stopped. A look of surprise appeared in his eyes, and then he quickly took out a mask from the Qianjun Ring and put it on.</p><p>At the same time, tiny ripples appeared on the water surface next to the Coldflame, and specks of golden light emerged within the ripples, revealing some kind of restriction.</p><p>Through these restrictions, one could see that the base of Coldflame Island was still there. The entire island hadn't collapsed; instead, the part above the water had been erased for some unknown reason.</p><p>Even so, the power required to destroy such a large island was still astonishing.</p><p>Then, a man in black armor emerged from the water. The man in black armor glanced around and accurately locked onto Qin Sang's hiding place. He shouted angrily, "Come out!"</p><p>In an instant, the man in black armor disappeared.</p><p>A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine. Without hesitation, he used all his strength. The sound of thunder exploded, and a red and white streak of light flashed like lightning, instantly shifting dozens of yards.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The next moment, where Qin Sang had been standing, the sea surface suddenly splashed, and a deep pit exploded. A spear shadow flashed, and the figure of the man in black armor slowly appeared at the edge.</p><p>The attack missed.</p><p>The man in black armor looked solemnly at where Qin Sang was. Strangely, after seeing Qin Sang clearly, the solemn look on his face diminished.</p><p>"So it's a fellow Daoist..."</p><p>The man in black armor sized Qin Sang up, noticing his low cultivation level. However, because of the extraordinary speed Qin Sang had just displayed, he didn't underestimate him. He lowered his spear, cupped his hands, and said, "This place is very dangerous. Fellow Daoist, if you don't know the situation, leave quickly. Lu will not pursue this matter."</p><p>Qin Sang naturally didn't want to leave just like that. What shocked him was the cultivation level of the man in black armor. The aura he displayed in that instant was that of a late Gold Core expert!</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang even more was the identity of the man in black armor. Although he had never met this person, he recognized the origin of the black armor â€“ the unique battle armor of the Hunyuan Island guards!</p><p>If he hadn't displayed such astonishing speed, this person definitely wouldn't be so polite.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it wasn't a monster guarding the Coldflame, but a Hunyuan Island guard.</p><p>Was that transformed demon driven away by the Hunyuan Island Master?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave immediately. He secretly gripped the Ten Yama Banners, cupped his hands in return, glanced sideways at the Coldflame, and said, "Don't blame me, Fellow Daoist. I was just passing through the Thousand Demons Sea. When I passed by here, I noticed a blue light flickering. I thought some rare treasure had appeared, but unexpectedly, it's this strange Coldflame. This fire actually requires Fellow Daoist to personally guard it. Could it be some extraordinary treasure?"</p><p>Perhaps because guarding this place was too boring, the man in black armor didn't strictly order Qin Sang to leave. Hearing this, he smiled and said, "It's not wrong to say it's a rare treasure. This fire is called the Winter Nether Coldflame, a supreme divine ability cultivated by the previous Island Master, Winter Nether. Senior Winter Nether passed away here, leaving behind the Winter Nether Coldflame, which possesses extraordinary power. Even transformed demons covet it. The Island Master drove away the transformed demon and ordered Lu to guard this place. However, this fire has Senior Winter Nether's unique mark. It's said that Senior Winter Nether was only a hair's breadth away from late Nascent Soul during his lifetime. It's basically impossible for others to erase Senior Winter Nether's mark and subdue this fire."</p><p>"Winter Nether Coldflame?"</p><p>Qin Sang was truly surprised. He had thought it was some kind of naturally born strange fire that attracted Senior Winter Nether here, but unexpectedly, it was cultivated by Senior Winter Nether himself.</p><p>So that cave was where Senior Winter Nether passed away, no wonder it left behind so many treasures!</p><p>"Transformed demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned shock. "No wonder there was so much chaos in the Demon Sea in recent years. It turns out a transformed demon emerged."</p><p>The man in black armor sized up Qin Sang and said in surprise, "Fellow Daoist just returned from the depths of the Demon Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I was hunting demons in the depths of the Thousand Demons Sea before. Later, I heard about the great war between the two races and that the sea routes were blocked by evil cultivators. Although I was anxious, there was nothing I could do. I was trapped inside. Some time ago, I luckily obtained a sea chart and discovered this route, so I dared to take a risk."</p><p>"So, Fellow Daoist entered before the war between the two races and stayed in the depths of the Demon Sea for nearly twenty years?"</p><p>The man in black armor was surprised. He took a deep look at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist hides yourself too well. Lu almost misjudged you! Fellow Daoist, you might not know, but the war between the two races ended five years ago. The evil cultivators blocking the routes were never a real threat. With Fellow Daoist's strength, you actually didn't need to be afraid. However, it's not wrong for Fellow Daoist to be cautious. That route was overrun by demon hordes long ago. This path is already broken. Now, there are very few cultivators who dare to enter the Thousand Demons Sea. The evil cultivators who were entrenched there couldn't escape in time and were also slaughtered by the monsters, saving us the trouble of cleaning them up."</p>
