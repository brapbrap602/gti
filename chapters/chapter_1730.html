<h1>Chapter 1721: Descent into Hell</h1><p>“Master Qin, these are records concerning the Abyssal Beasts.”</p><p>Master Xingji presented a jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>His manner was respectful and courteous, yet his expression remained impassive.</p><p>Beside him, Xingren and another high-ranking monk from the Ganlu Monastery sat cross-legged on cushions.  Except for those traveling abroad, all the great cultivators in the monastery had emerged to greet the True Monarch.</p><p>Monks Xingren and the other watched Qin Sang, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p>Their eyes showed a mixture of questions, anticipation, and surprise, which they forcefully suppressed.  The fact that monks of their cultivation could behave in such a manner indicated the gravity and difficulty of the situation.</p><p>Saint Huiguang had once summoned his disciples to discuss the matter of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound, and all the great cultivators of Ganlu Monastery were privy to the information that the demonic sound was obstructing the Dao, making ascension difficult.</p><p>Over a hundred years ago, Qin Sang’s cultivation was only at the late Nascent Soul stage, comparable to theirs.  He had been hunted by the Qinghu Saint King—an undeniable fact, making a breakthrough before the Heavenly Tribulation impossible.</p><p>Yet, this person had reappeared, having already ascended to the rank of True Monarch!</p><p>Could this be a turning point?</p><p>The Red Cloud Holy Land incident had concluded; Qin Sang, of course, had not killed the young novice monks but released them, and together they had come to Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>This is the Immeasurable Hall of the monastery.</p><p>The hall doors were closed, and the Black Lion Great Sage lay down before them.</p><p>The other monks of Ganlu Monastery were unaware of the True Monarch’s arrival. Seeing their fellow monks unharmed, they assumed the problems at the Holy Land had been resolved, and everything was as usual.</p><p>Inside the hall.</p><p>Master Xingji sat cross-legged, eyes slightly closed, his fingers twirling prayer beads as he silently chanted sutras.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, then used his divine sense to examine the jade slip. The first thing he saw were vivid images of beasts, each bizarre and grotesque.</p><p>Some of these beasts bore a resemblance to creatures found in the mortal world, their appearances similar to certain types of demonic beasts.</p><p>Yet, like the monstrous whale hunted by the Dragon Whale clan, their essence differed greatly from demonic beasts.  The images themselves radiated a ferocious aura.</p><p>According to Master Xingji, these were beasts that cultivators of this world had personally witnessed over countless years.  They were compiled from records and images left by countless predecessors and passed down as a legacy.</p><p>These records originated not only from the Buddhist and Daoist sects but also from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, and even from more ancient sects.</p><p>The vast majority featured only a single image, and some did not even have that, only a few dry descriptions.</p><p>Before the Heavenly Tribulation, these beasts roamed only in the Abyss, rarely leaving their lairs.</p><p>Only Transformation Stage cultivators could reach the Abyss.  The records were thus of creatures that posed a threat to them.  Therefore, the weakest beasts depicted in the illustrated volume were at the Transformation stage.</p><p>However, their number was far fewer than Qin Sang had imagined.</p><p>Clearly, these were not all of the Abyssal Beasts. For instance, the manta-ray shaped beast summoned by the two Transformation Stage cultivators during their hunt was not recorded.</p><p>Furthermore, the descriptions of the beasts' abilities were far from exhaustive.  Except for a few, they were only briefly mentioned.</p><p>For example, one entry read:</p><p>“Resembling a dragon, it possesses horns, and thousands of black tumors on its back.  Its spiritual perception is dull. When startled, the black tumors burst, releasing ink-black pus that can corrode True Essence.”</p><p>The implication was that encountering such a beast required no panic. Concealing one’s aura and carefully avoiding it would suffice; otherwise, one would only disturb the beast. Of course, this advice was only applicable before the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>This entry on the beast’s abilities and countermeasures was considered quite detailed.</p><p>Over the generations, countless Transformation Stage cultivators had emerged in the Central Plains, yet only these records existed.</p><p>This was because the Abyss was easy to enter but difficult to leave, fraught with countless dangers.  The goal of entering the Abyss was to find a Dao marker for ascension—the only path.  Forcibly returning meant risking one’s life.  The beasts were incredibly powerful, and the surrounding environment was rife with danger.  Cultivators would rather avoid them than provoke them.</p><p>Few were like the ancestor of the Dragon Whale Great Sage, who had guarded the Abyss’s outer edge for three hundred years, single-handedly hunting and dragging back the monstrous whale to the Central Plains.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the various images of the beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang put down the jade slip and asked, “Since the beast hunted by you all was captured alive, did you manage to learn anything from it?”</p><p>Not long after the hunt, Ganlu Monastery had publicly displayed their findings, something Qin Sang already knew through his avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang was, of course, asking about something they might have concealed.</p><p>“Everything obtained then was made public without reservation, nothing was hidden.”</p><p>Master Xingji clasped his hands in reply.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that only by personally entering the Abyss would he know what had happened there and what the place was like.</p><p>“When did the two of you set off?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Saint Huiguang and the Qinghu Saint King had already crossed the Eastern Sea to ascend.</p><p>Master Xingji answered promptly and without hesitation, “Sixty-five years ago.”</p><p>After Qin Sang achieved the Transformation stage, consolidating his cultivation and the journey to the East Sea had taken nearly ten years.</p><p>Sixty-five years ago, fifteen years after the Three Oaths.</p><p>They sure were in a hurry!</p><p>I wonder how deeply they were affected by the demonic sound. Sixty-five years should be enough for Hui Guang and the Qinghu Yao Wang to reach Gui Xu.</p><p>Transformation Stage cultivators are less affected by the storm than Nascent Soul cultivators. They can absorb spiritual energy while flying, allowing for extended flight without needing to constantly find shelters to recover their essence. Before the Heavenly Tribulation, reaching the edge of Gui Xu would only take them a little over thirty years.</p><p>Double the time, they should have arrived by now.</p><p>If all went well, they might have even ascended to the Upper Realm.</p><p>"Did the two of you leave behind any similar soul-lamp treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that if they discovered the anomaly in Gui Xu and found the situation impossible, would they return to Zhongzhou?</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Xingji shook his head. "My senior master said that this eastward journey is a one-way trip. If they fail to ascend, they will perish in Gui Xu, leaving their findings on Daiyu Immortal Mountain. If future generations are fortunate enough to achieve Transformation Stage, they can inherit our will, reopen the Heavenly Gate. Therefore, there’s no need to leave soul lamps."</p><p>As he spoke, Master Xingji looked up at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>Success or death.</p><p>The three of them went east, never considering turning back.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, because his puppet was chosen, also went with them, making it a party of three.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up another jade slip, containing information related to Gui Xu.</p><p>The Heavenly Gate that Master Xingji spoke of was the same landmark mentioned by the Ghost Mother. Cultivators use the landmark to ascend to the Greater Thousand World, hence the name Heavenly Gate.</p><p>The East Sea has a great abyss, a bottomless valley.  Its depths are unfathomable; it is called Gui Xu. The waters of the eight wilds and nine deserts, the celestial rivers, all flow into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases.</p><p>Deep within Gui Xu, one can see a dark, turbid current, flowing endlessly, its source and destination unknown. The Heavenly Gate is hidden within it.</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain is an island within Gui Xu.</p><p>This island is truly peculiar. The dangers in Gui Xu far surpass those of the storm belt. Shelters that survived the storm belt in the past would soon collapse if they were in Gui Xu.</p><p>Gui Xu is filled with ferocious beasts and endless waters, devoid of blessed lands, yet this solitary mountain remains unscathed to this day.</p><p>Countless years ago, cultivators of this world discovered Daiyu Immortal Mountain.  It hangs in Gui Xu, its location unchanging for millennia, though unsuitable for cultivation, serving only as a temporary resting place.</p><p>The jade slip Qin Sang currently holds contains only general information, with no detailed description of the interior of Gui Xu.</p><p>What he most desires now is the path to ascension, the safe route to the Heavenly Gate, and the experiences of past cultivators within Gui Xu.</p><p>This would be invaluable knowledge.</p><p>However, the jade slip doesn't provide this; only the location of Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Because all of this is kept on Daiyu Immortal Mountain itself.</p><p>Initially, the path to ascension was fraught with peril, a journey of life and death.  Past cultivators inscribed their findings on the mountain to guide future generations, who then, in turn, guided those who followed. The safe path to ascension was built up generation after generation.</p><p>By finding Daiyu Immortal Mountain, one can find the path to ascension.</p><p>Hui Guang and the others were trying to forge this path.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully memorized the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>Actually, after the internal strife in the demon race, he had already obtained similar information from them.</p><p>For Transformation Stage cultivators, this world is a cage, even for the demon kings. Ascending to the Upper Realm is a common pursuit of both human and demon cultivators.  They readily share information, thus the contents are largely the same.</p><p>'Tap tap tap...'</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the jade slip lightly, lost in thought.</p><p>Since he remained silent, the three monks dared not ask questions.</p><p>The Wuliang Hall was filled with a deathly silence.</p><p>Qin Sang was naturally thinking about ascension.</p><p>He wondered how Hui Guang and the others were doing, what they'd managed to accomplish in Gui Xu.</p><p>Two Transformation Stage cultivators, a Transformation Stage puppet, and the Five Elements Crown, the foremost spiritual treasure of Zhongzhou which had already given birth to a demon spirit; their combined strength was terrifying.</p><p>Upon sensing the demonic sound of Heaven’s Dao, Qin Sang guessed that something was amiss with the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Asking Master Xingji, his suspicions were confirmed. It was indeed ancient demons who caused the previous chaos. But it wasn’t just ancient demons. The Kun Daoist, who had set up the trap on Di Shou Mountain, was actually the demon spirit within the spiritual treasure. The spirit had merged with the ancient demons and was overwhelmed by the demonic sound, its intelligence replaced by madness, making any communication impossible.</p><p>Even if this group perished in Gui Xu, they would likely leave behind some experiences. I'll find them when I go to Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>If I go early enough, maybe some of them are still alive.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own situation.  He had only recently consolidated his cultivation after reaching the Transformation Stage; he hadn't even begun serious cultivation yet. Even before the Heavenly Tribulation, Transformation Stage cultivators would need to diligently cultivate for a while, reaching their peak before considering ascension. Gui Xu would certainly be even more dangerous now.</p><p>Leave too early, my cultivation isn't sufficient.</p><p>Leave too late, I'll be alone and vulnerable.</p><p>It's a truly difficult choice!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, flicking the jade slip back. He mused, "The two of you sought the recipe for my Town Spirit Incense, hoping to refine a superior version with even greater efficacy, right? How many have you refined? Have you kept any samples? Please let me have a look."</p><p>Having heard Qin Sang's question, both Abbot Xing Ren and Abbot Xing Ji's eyes lit up.</p><p>They keenly noticed the word "also" in Qin Sang's statement.  Since Qin Sang's appearance, they had harbored a question: how did this person overcome the Demon Tribulation?  From Qin Sang's tone, the Heavenly Demon's voice hadn't disappeared.  Since Qin Sang didn't volunteer information, they couldn't directly ask, leaving them in a state of agitation.</p><p>They knew that Qin Sang, burdened by the terrifying pressure of being hunted by a demon king, had reached the Nascent Soul stage so quickly, demonstrating exceptional mental fortitude. But as the Venerable Hui Guang had said, the Demon Tribulation couldn't be overcome with willpower alone; there had to be some means.</p><p>They remembered that Qin Sang's external avatar had been studying alchemy at the temple, frequently consulting with master alchemists.</p><p>Could it be that True Cultivator Qin, mirroring his master's ideas, had begun refining before his breakthrough, successfully creating superior Soul-Calming Incense, inadvertently overcoming the Demon Tribulation?  They desperately hoped the superior Soul-Calming Incense would work, offering them a lifeline!</p><p>Qin Sang having given his consent, Master Xing Ji, unable to refuse, rose and apologized.  Qin Sang said, "I'll go with you."</p><p>Master Xing Ji paused, addressing the two abbots, "You come too."</p><p>Leaving the Infinite Hall, they arrived at a restricted area of the Ganlu Temple. Qin Sang watched as Master Xing Ji produced a jade box; upon opening it, a bright green light emanated, accompanied by a fragrant scent.  Seeing the contents of the box, Qin Sang frowned slightly. Inside were not incense sticks, but three glowing green masses, pulsating gently, yet unformed.</p><p>Master Xing Ji explained, "My master and the Demon King convened master alchemists to refine the formula, and eventually succeeded in creating five sticks of superior Soul-Calming Incense. However, due to insufficient ingredients, only two were completed, leaving these three unrefined masses."</p><p>Qin Sang requested the Soul-Calming Incense formula.  Seeing the newly added ingredients, he couldn't help but marvel. The new herbs were all celestial treasures, far surpassing the original formula in value; some even originated from the Immortal Palace. Two Nascent Soul cultivators, combing through the resources of two races, only managed to refine two sticks and three unformed masses.</p><p>Of course, rare ingredients alone weren't enough to refine the incense. Xiao Xiangzi's creation of the Soul-Calming Incense was groundbreaking; following his path made the refinement easier.  The new herbs were compatible with the incense's properties.</p><p>Though Qin Sang, despite his avatar's alchemic studies, was not yet a master alchemist, understanding the formula presented no problem. He knew that by gathering the necessary ingredients, refining these three green masses would yield three sticks of superior Soul-Calming Incense, significantly easier than starting from scratch.</p><p>"Thousand-Leaf Awakening Ginseng..." Qin Sang murmured, looking at the unheard-of herb, silently shaking his head. Gathering the ingredients would not be an easy task.</p><p>He naturally intended to accept these three masses of incense material; the Ganlu Temple wouldn't dare refuse.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could respond, Master Xing Ji's expression turned serious. He bowed deeply, "I've revealed everything I know and willingly offer these three unrefined masses to the True Cultivator, hoping to be of assistance."</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade box, his expression unchanged, but a hint of a smile played on his lips. The two abbots, however, showed a subtle change in their expressions.</p><p>These were not merely unfinished materials; their refinement was extremely difficult, requiring the combined efforts of two Nascent Soul cultivators. While all that was needed was to gather the missing herbs, giving away the unrefined masses meant starting over.  Without Nascent Soul assistance, the chances of failure drastically increased.</p><p>Ignoring the two abbots, Master Xing Ji, upon seeing Qin Sang's expression, sighed, "Venerable Hui Guang, blinded by obsession, used the 'Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture' to manipulate the True Cultivator, planting karmic debt. Now that the True Cultivator has come, the consequences must be faced."</p><p>Qin Sang calmly said, "I hadn't yet sought retribution, yet you bring it up yourself."</p><p>Master Xing Ji felt bitter. This secret technique was a treasured transmission of the temple, impossible to deny.  Waiting for Qin Sang to press the issue would be too late.</p><p>"My master informed me; I am also culpable. I offer my life to the True Cultivator, not seeking to resolve the karmic debt, only to quell the True Cultivator's anger. The other monks are unaware; please don't implicate the innocent."</p><p>Master Xing Ji spoke, then sat cross-legged.  The two abbots, now aware of the situation, were shocked.</p><p>"Brothers, remember, this is my own choice, do not resent the True Cultivator."</p><p>Master Xing Ji clasped his hands together, his life force extinguishing.  "Amitabha."</p><p>Witnessing their abbot's passing, the two abbots, understanding his noble intentions, showed sorrowful expressions.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed deeply at Master Xing Ji, sighing softly before placing a finger on his forehead.  Master Xing Ji suddenly awoke, momentarily believing he was in hell.  The two abbots showed faces of immense surprise and gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the jade box, calmly saying, "This is a karmic debt between myself and Daoist Hui Guang; I shall settle it with him alone.  Quickly summon the various sects of Central State; I have important matters to discuss."</p><p>(End)</p>
