<h1>Chapter 1821: The Five Elements Crown</h1><p>Chaos!</p><p>From the mountaintop, witnessing the scene beyond, everyone simultaneously shared the same thought.</p><p>Even from the highest point, details remained elusive.</p><p>Within the Wu Xiang Sect, mist and clouds swirled, a colorful fog sea shimmered with the fluctuating light of various prohibitions and spirit arrays. Countless flying swords drifted through the void, the whole scene a chaotic mess.</p><p>Straining their vision, the group could only vaguely discern layers of mountain shadows.</p><p>An air of mystery and unpredictability hung heavy over the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>The mountaintop had been leveled into a platform.  Judging by the remaining traces, this was the original entrance to the Wu Xiang Sect.  Several teleportation arrays were built on the platform, likely leading to different locations within the sect; everything appeared orderly in this area.</p><p>Each teleportation array was marked by a stone tablet.</p><p>However, these arrays had long been destroyed from the opposite side, beyond repair. The stone tablets, undoubtedly once protected by prohibitions, were now reduced to broken fragments.</p><p>From the surviving text on the fragments, words like "valley," "hall," and "pavilion" could be deciphered, though most were too damaged to allow for precise understanding of their function.</p><p>In the center of the platform, a few teleportation array locations stood out as particularly important.  One stone tablet miraculously preserved complete inscriptions—Earth Aspect Hall!</p><p>Four other teleportation arrays, along with the Earth Aspect Hall array, encircled a central, unmarked array.</p><p>Su Zinan pointed to these arrays, "As fellow cultivators previously stated, these should be the core of the Wu Xiang Sect. This unnamed teleportation array, guarded by the five elemental halls, indicates its supreme importance.  The Wu Xiang Sect's treasure, the Five Elements Crown, must be stored here, wouldn't you agree?"</p><p>He looked inquiringly at Zhu Wudao, the masked man, and the others.</p><p>The masked man ignored him.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, unwilling to antagonize Su Zinan at this moment, observed the Wu Xiang Sect while answering, "When the Wu Xiang Sect suffered annihilation, its legacy was scattered, and the Five Elements Crown disappeared.  No one knows where it ended up.  It might still be hidden somewhere in the ruins, gathering dust, or perhaps it's already been taken away…"</p><p>"In that case, the Five Elements Crown is ownerless; whoever obtains it will possess it. Let us not claim any ancient rights to it,"</p><p>Su Zinan paused, seeing Zhu Wudao nod, smiled contentedly. "My adoptive father, when recounting the secrets of the cultivation world, never mentioned the Five Elements Crown. If it weren't for your claims, I wouldn't believe that the Wu Xiang Sect's most treasured item was so obscure."</p><p>"If it were widely known, how could I use it to summon the sect's descendants?" Zhu Wudao seemed to have spotted something, his gaze fixed in one direction. "The Five Elements Crown is just one among many treasures of the Wu Xiang Sect, and the least known.  Only the true inheritors of each lineage knew of its existence…"</p><p>It turned out that the strange statue worshipped by the Gu Shen Cult had a crown made of five crude jade pieces fitted together, precisely resembling the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, using the Five Elements Crown's image, spread the Gu Shen Cult's influence to rally the hidden descendants of the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>While Zhu Wudao observed, the others strained to discern the various sights within the Wu Xiang Sect, attempting to guess the location of any hidden areas.  Their efforts yielded little success.</p><p>The only certainty was the northeast direction, filled with formidable prohibitions and layered peaks. The chaotic scene could not completely mask the aura of a grand immortal sect—surely a critical area of the Wu Xiang Sect!</p><p>The Five Element Halls were most likely in that direction.</p><p>Having found his target, Zhu Wudao dashed down the mountain ahead of the others.</p><p>Given his evident knowledge of the Wu Xiang Sect, none present could rival him, and the others instantly followed him down the mountain.</p><p>"Hm? The flight restriction is weakening."</p><p>Not far from the peak, Mo Xingdao was the first to notice a change.  He leaped, rising to a height of about six feet before feeling the pressure, a sense of being locked onto by flying swords.</p><p>Everyone tried it, confirming the observation.</p><p>The Swordsman gazed ahead, murmuring, "The Wu Xiang Sect's chaos is not merely superficial.  The prohibitions and spirit arrays here defy common sense; in some areas, the prohibitions are weaker, allowing higher flight, while others are stronger."</p><p>"Precisely!" Zhu Wudao's figure continued to move; without turning, he called out, "Be cautious, everyone. An unexpected incident could affect the others."</p><p>The group complied, continuing their low-altitude flight.</p><p>Reaching the foot of the mountain…</p><p>Below was a vast, desolate expanse of stony beach, stretching as far as the eye could see.  The beach was littered with rubble, devoid of any vegetation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao flew onto the beach, then stopped, looking down. He reached down, picking up a piece of ashen-white rubble.</p><p>This was no ordinary stone; it was clearly a refined spiritual material fragment, yet it didn't resemble the remnants of a magical artifact.</p><p>The vast beach was covered with such fragments.</p><p>Their number was countless.</p><p>The others also realized the true nature of the beach.</p><p>Suddenly, the fragments on the stone beach trembled slightly. A low rumble echoed from beneath, like the earth's heartbeat.</p><p>"What was that sound?"</p><p>Su Zinan's face changed slightly, a bad feeling washing over him.  Even as a successor of the Divine Transformation stage, he didn't dare to be careless within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy. This place was far more complex than a mere cultivation ground; too many unknowns lurked here.</p><p>The tremors intensified.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ground exploded.</p><p>A flurry of explosions followed, shattering fragments across the stone beach. Oddly shaped figures burst forth from the chaos.</p><p>Before their appearance, Wu Dao and the others hadn't sensed any living beings.</p><p>The figures emerged, silent and without noticeable auras, turning towards Wu Dao and his companions as one.</p><p>"War-formation puppets!"</p><p>Wu Dao recognized them, his expression darkening.  These were the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's creations, designed in diverse forms for optimal coordination within a war array.  Pure killing machines, born for battle, they attacked any intruder indiscriminately.  Even with his inherited knowledge, Wu Dao couldn't control the legacy grounds; these puppets wouldn't recognize him.</p><p>Their eyes were vacant.</p><p>Despite their high cultivation, even these powerful cultivators felt a chill at being surrounded.</p><p>The next moment, the air filled with the sound of tearing fabric.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Darkness enveloped them as the war-formation puppets surged forward, a sea of shadows above the stone beach.</p><p>Their keen senses detected the puppets' individual weakness. Many were damaged, missing limbs, unable to form a coherent formation. They posed no mortal threat.</p><p>However, their sheer number was overwhelming.  Their allies were lagging behind, leaving them to fight alone.</p><p>"Charge!"</p><p>Without Wu Dao's command, everyone understood their only option.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others unleashed their treasures, displaying their various abilities, charging into the mass of puppets to carve a path.  They were peak experts, capable of obliterating groups of puppets with a single strike.</p><p>But the puppets seemed inexhaustible.  Furthermore, lacking coordination, they guarded against each other, fighting independently, adding to the challenge.</p><p>Su Zinan moved at a steady pace, maintaining distance from everyone, including Mo Xingdao. He raised his right hand, five dragon tendons twirling from his fingertips, connected to a dragon tendon net. The net danced like a butterfly, ensnaring swathes of puppets, the tendons tightening to pulverize them.</p><p>Su Zinan showed no strain, his gaze flickering as he subtly observed Wu Dao and the others, lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, Su Zinan felt a shift, and looked up sharply!</p><p>The clouds above stirred, revealing flickering lights, growing brighter and dimmer within the mist.</p><p>They recognized this; the sign of the activated sword formation preparing to strike!</p><p>Their incursion had awakened not only the puppets but the sword formation as well.</p><p>Su Zinan cursed inwardly, flicking his fingers, sending bloodlight soaring, coalescing above his head into a blood amulet.  The amulet exploded with a *bang*, unleashing a visible blood ring that swept outwards.</p><p>Touched by the bloodlight, the puppets' joints seemed to seize, their movements slowing.  Su Zinan swiftly deployed his dragon tendon net, creating a protective barrier above him.</p><p>Simultaneously, a howling wind swept down from above.</p><p>A forest of swords descended!</p><p>In an instant, everyone was swallowed by the deluge of swords and puppets.</p><p>Wu Dao, his head radiating golden light, endured the onslaught of swords, the golden light repelling nearby puppets, resolutely pushing towards his chosen direction.</p><p>His target wasn't the previously identified northeastern stronghold of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, but a slightly offset point to the north.</p><p>Since entering the beach, the sword-carrying man had followed closely behind Wu Dao, wielding a heavy sword repeatedly.</p><p>His style was unorthodox, combining sword techniques with knife principles.  It was strange but effective, and concealed his identity.</p><p>The heavy sword cut through the puppet horde with ease.  Amidst the chaos, the sword-carrying man remained calm, his sword a whirlwind around him, safeguarding Wu Dao.</p><p>Elsewhere, the grotesque-faced man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master had drawn near each other.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master wore a red flower in his hair.</p><p>This treasure, when it emits its light, can repel the puppets.  When its power is drawn in, it can swallow the magic swords; its uses are endless.</p><p>However, the person with the strange face appeared most at ease.</p><p>He moved without touching the ground, his feet on a vine as thick as a giant serpent.  Both ends of the vine were deeply embedded in the earth, carrying the strange-faced man forward.</p><p>As soon as a puppet approached, thinner vines would shoot out from the main vine, entangling it and dragging it underground.</p><p>When the magic swords descended, the strange-faced man's reaction was somewhat like Su Zinan's—countless vines shot upwards, weaving a net above his head.</p><p>Glancing at Zhu Wu Dao's position, the strange-faced man sent a voice transmission:  "Master Dong, please keep close to Elder Zhu. I'll go to the Mu Xiang Hall to obtain that secret technique and then immediately rejoin you."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Master Qi Ling showed displeasure.</p><p>The strange-faced man sensed Master Qi Ling's reservations and added a few more explanations: "Elder Zhu is treacherous. We must be wary of him tampering with the teleportation array leading to the Tian Tong Hall and falling into his trap. This secret technique is also crucial, second only in importance to the Immortal Hall.  Elder Zhu's destination and the Mu Xiang Hall are not in the same direction, so we must split our forces. I have already sworn oaths of both mind and karma to you, Master. What else do you worry about? Elder Zhu's disciples and grandchildren haven't arrived yet. As long as you remain vigilant, you'll be safe."</p><p>Finally, Master Qi Ling followed the strange-faced man's advice and went after Zhu Wu Dao alone.</p><p>The strange-faced man watched for a moment, then pushed off with his foot. The vine immediately turned and headed east.</p><p>The man in white robes was at the rear.</p><p>Surrounded by puppets and magic swords, he was more cautious than the others, immediately slowing down. Steam rose from his body, forming a thick suit of armor made of water.</p><p>The armor seemed weak.</p><p>The sounds of "poof, poof" rang out continuously. The puppets and magic swords could shake the armor, but they couldn't penetrate it, protecting the man in white robes securely.</p><p>He proceeded unhurriedly, and even when he lost sight of Zhu Wu Dao, he showed no signs of speeding up.</p><p>In the end, he stopped, waited a while, and quietly distanced himself from the others.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao seemed to know the least about the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, having only recently begun to gather information about it.  Su Zinan, on the other hand, had heard some secrets from Old Master Lu.</p><p>His agreement to cooperate with Su Zinan ended after they passed the Wu Wang Hall. They later formed a temporary alliance at Zhu Wu Dao's invitation.  Su Zinan wouldn't reveal any secrets to him.</p><p>Besides the Five Elements Crown, he didn't know what other treasures the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect possessed.</p><p>However, Mo Xing Dao was certain of one thing: sticking with Zhu Wu Dao was the right move!</p><p>After a furious dash, Zhu Wu Dao finally burst out of the stone beach.</p><p>Ahead lay a ravine, overgrown with weeds, it didn't seem like a safe place.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao ignored his pursuers, his pace never faltering, he dashed into the ravine.  Soon the swordsman and Master Qi Ling followed.</p><p>When Mo Xing Dao emerged from the stone beach, he unexpectedly found that Su Zinan was gone.</p><p>The man hadn't followed, and he didn't know where he'd gone.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Mo Xing Dao decided to ignore Su Zinan and act alone.</p><p>…</p><p>Two figures appeared on the mountaintop—Master Zi Lei and Yue Ling Tian.</p><p>They looked down at the mountain.</p><p>The stone beach had become a sea of puppets and magic swords. It was too chaotic to discern the movements of others.</p><p>While Yue Ling Tian observed the stele, Master Zi Lei took out a jade talisman, held it in his palm, sensed it slightly, said "Let's go," and flashed into the stone beach.</p><p>Yue Ling Tian followed closely behind.</p><p>Before leaving, Yue Ling Tian looked back, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>Things had changed with Yun Long.  He wondered if Hua Chen Zi could still arrive in time.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after Master Zi Lei and Yue Ling Tian entered the stone beach, Qin Sang reached the mountaintop, also exclaiming, "What chaos!"</p><p>"Anti-flight restrictions, magic sword formations, a sea of puppets… they'd already attacked the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's mountain gate back then. I suspect that they forcefully sealed the mountain gate during the war, and these restrictions fell dormant. Now they've been reactivated, sensing the presence of living beings and being awakened…"</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the events of the past based on these clues.</p><p>The hasty sealing of the mountain gate by the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's ancestors suggested that many treasures inside hadn't been moved in time.</p><p>After scanning the area, Qin Sang didn't rush down the mountain but examined the inscriptions on the stele.</p><p>"Tu Xiang Hall… some teahouse… huh? Lang…  …"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>Legend says Lang… is the treasure house of classic texts.</p><p>The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect certainly wouldn't name things randomly.  The so-called Lang… must be the sect's library!</p>
