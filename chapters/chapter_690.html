Chapter 682: Hunting the Jiao


The old couple had warned them that danger lurked everywhere once they left Cliff Island.  Deep within the Demon Sea, besides the ever-present threat of sea monsters, they also had to be wary of other cultivators. In such a chaotic place, it wasn't surprising for anyone to turn into a murderous bandit.

The couple had spent decades in the Demon Sea and had faced similar dangers more than once, relying on their vigilance to survive.

They had recruited three others to form this monster hunting team, and it was only after many trials together that they had built trust among themselves.

The old couple also spoke frankly to Qin Sang. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't accept employment from an unfamiliar Nascent Soul cultivator. However, due to the guarantees from瓊宇 Trading Company and Ran Luo, combined with the generous reward offered by both Qin Sang and the company, they had accepted the job.

After several days of travel, they were getting further and further away from Cliff Island.

Qin Sang could clearly sense that as they left the area patrolled by the island's cultivators, everyone became increasingly cautious.

Later on, when encountering other cultivators from afar, without knowing each other's strength, they would immediately and tacitly avoid each other, maintaining a safe distance.

This seemed to be an unspoken rule of the Demon Sea.

True to their word, the old couple was very familiar with the area. Their chosen route avoided any powerful sea monsters, ensuring a smooth journey. After more than ten days, they finally reached their destination.

"The trench is just ahead."

The group landed on a deserted island, carefully concealing themselves. The old man pointed forward and said to Qin Sang.

Perhaps it was psychological, but Qin Sang felt that the color of the water ahead was deeper than elsewhere, as if countless dangers lurked beneath the surface.

"Master, the peak Spirit Transformation realm Azure Jiao we found earlier has its lair three days east of here.  Unless something unexpected happened, it should still be there. Shall we head over now?"

The old woman asked Qin Sang in a low voice.

Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, glanced at the old woman, and asked, "Since you knew the Azure Jiao's lair for so long, why didn't you hunt it down? With the strength of your five-member team, hunting a peak Spirit Transformation Azure Jiao shouldn't be difficult, right?"

The old woman replied, "Under normal circumstances, hunting it wouldn't be difficult. However, there's more than one Azure Jiao in the lair.  The others aren't as powerful, but they are still a force to be reckoned with. Secondly, the Demon Sea teems with monsters, especially in the depths of the trench. If we can't kill the Azure Jiao quickly and retreat, we risk attracting other monsters. Surrounded, our chances of survival would be slim.  We haven't actually hunted many peak Spirit Transformation realm monsters. Each time, we meticulously prepare before taking action."

Qin Sang responded, "Since you say it's so dangerous, I shouldn't be careless.  It's best to have someone on the perimeter during the hunt, monitoring the surrounding waters. Who among you excels in detection techniques?"

The old couple exchanged a glance.

The old man said, "Master, my wife and Lady Wang both have several methods to detect the movements of sea monsters."

"Good," Qin Sang nodded. "When we encounter the Jiao, they will keep watch outside, and the three of you will come with me to hunt the Jiao. I will deal with the peak Spirit Transformation realm Azure Jiao, and you three will handle the others. After the hunt, the spoils will be divided as agreed.  Aside from the Azure Jiao leader, the rest are yours."

The old couple and their three companions beamed with delight and readily agreed.

With Qin Sang taking care of the Azure Jiao leader, the others would be much easier to deal with. The bodies of Jiao were extremely valuable, promising them a significant profit.

After the plan was settled, they immediately set off.

Upon entering the trench, Qin Sang also abandoned his relaxed attitude and actively extended his divine sense, probing the surrounding waters.

On the evening of the third day, six figures appeared in a seemingly empty area of the sea.  The water here was unusually calm, showing no signs of Jiao activity.

"This is the place. Every full moon night, these Jiao leave the trench and swarm out to wreak havoc. That's the perfect time to hunt them."

The old man whispered, then led the group in an arc to a small reef island where they hid.

Qin Sang calculated that the full moon would be in two days, so they had to wait patiently.

Before they knew it, two days passed.

As night fell, a bright, silver moon hung in the sky, casting a cool, watery light.  The moon's reflection danced on the waves.

Even with the full moon out, the sea remained calm.

The six people on the reef held their breath, their eyes wide open, not missing any changes on the sea surface.

As time went on, it was soon deep into the night, and the moon climbed to its zenith, yet there was still no sign of the Jiao.

Just then, the old man suddenly exclaimed in a low voice.

"They're here!"

Qin Sang followed the old man's gaze. A faint mist had risen on the distant sea surface, easily mistaken for ordinary sea mist at first glance.

Such sights were common in the vast ocean, but this time it was clearly different.

"Every time these Azure Jiao appear, they summon clouds and mist to conceal themselves..."

Listening to the old man's voice transmission, Qin Sang saw the mist slowly moving across the vast water surface, growing larger and larger, enveloping a large area within moments.

At the same time, slender figures flickered within the mist.

The Jiao had appeared!

Qin Sang quietly left the reef and approached the mist, stopping at a distance.  The Azure Jiao, completely unaware of the approaching danger, were playfully frolicking in the mist.

After observing for a while, Qin Sang confirmed that the information was correct. The highest cultivation among these Azure Jiao was indeed peak Spirit Transformation realm. He immediately decided to strike!

*Whoosh!*

The Ebony Sword flew out from between Qin Sang's eyebrows, its aura surging.

Without a pause, the Ebony Sword unleashed a dazzling beam of sword light that slashed down towards the center of the mist.

The five people on the reef saw the sword light and immediately flew out.

"The two of you go to the flanks and keep watch! The rest of you, follow me to hunt the Jiao!"

The old man quickly gave his orders. Before he finished speaking, he saw Qin Sang charge into the mist, sword in hand.  The furious roars of the Jiao echoed from within the mist.

"Hurry!"

The old man urged, using all his strength to rush towards the mist.

The three of them used their various techniques to enter the mist one after another. They found the Azure Jiao in disarray and quickly formed a battle formation to begin the hunt. They then saw a figure standing in the air in the center of the mist, a large hand formed from true essence tightly gripping an Azure Jiao.

The Azure Jiao was covered in blood, barely clinging to life, held firmly by the large hand, utterly unable to resist!
