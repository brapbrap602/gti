<h1>Chapter 165: Releasing the Demon</h1><p>They escorted Su Nü into the mountain valley.</p><p>At the valley's center stood a weathered stone stele, seemingly ordinary and ancient.  Piles of rubble surrounded it, creating a desolate scene.</p><p>Strangely, there were no graves nearby, and the stele bore no inscription, only the marks of time—a wordless monument.</p><p>They stopped before the stele and first cast a concealing barrier over the valley.  Then, after a brief hesitation, they simultaneously formed hand seals, channeling their vital essence into their hands.</p><p>Their vital essence was infused with demonic energy, and behind each of them, a three-headed, six-armed demonic phantom materialized.</p><p>Su Nü, all too familiar with demonic energy, was shocked.</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders, outwardly unconnected to the demonic path and even considered thorns in the Demon Lord's side, were all proficient in demonic arts, capable of wielding demonic energy!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Three solidified seals struck the stele simultaneously.</p><p>A black light flickered across the weathered surface before fading. Then, a faint sigh emanated from within the stone.</p><p>"Alas... I have waited for centuries, and you have finally arrived..."</p><p>The voice was weak yet paradoxically harsh and grating, like scraping metal.</p><p>Su Nü's eyes widened, her gaze vacant.  Her last shred of hope vanished.  A great demon was truly sealed here!</p><p>Wisps of black energy seeped from the stele's base, but an unseen force contained them, preventing them from breaking the seal. Trapped at the bottom, the energy formed a grotesque face.</p><p>Its features were distorted, inhuman.</p><p>Despite the emptiness of its eyes, their gaze sent a chill down the Alliance Leaders' spines.</p><p>"Mid-Nascent Soul peak, all of you. Excellent! You haven't disappointed me. My personal guidance and the Sacred Clan's divine arts were not wasted... But why are there only three of you?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders exchanged glances, their expressions varied. The East Alliance Leader stepped forward and bowed. "Your Majesty, after receiving your guidance in the Outer Hall, we followed your command, establishing our influence and gathering resources to aid your release. Sadly, our cultivation was weak then, and two of my fellow disciples provoked powerful enemies and met with unfortunate accidents. We were forced to bide our time and adopt a different approach..."</p><p>Sealed within the stele was an ancient Demon Lord!</p><p>"A merchant alliance?"</p><p>The Demon Lord, unconcerned about his two disciples' deaths, let out a mocking laugh.  "I recall you saying that in this era, there are no cultivators who have reached the Deity Transformation stage. In such a desolate land, as my personal disciples, you couldn't establish dominance and had to form a merchant alliance, bowing to others' whims?"</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, the three merchant alliances were second only to the righteous and demonic sects.  Yet, the Demon Lord's tone was derisive, filled with disdain for the three Alliance Leaders.</p><p>The three had never endured such mockery.</p><p>The West Alliance Leader's brow furrowed, anger flashing across her face. "If you hadn't tampered with us, causing our vital essence to become unstable and threatening our very lives, we would have long since ascended to greater heights, dominating the cultivation world. We wouldn't have needed to tread so carefully!"</p><p>The East and North Alliance Leaders shared her sentiment.  They had fallen deep into the demonic path, with no chance of redemption.</p><p>"You've noticed it, have you?" The Demon Lord chuckled.</p><p>"It wasn't my doing. Your human bodies are cultivating the divine arts of the Sacred Clan. Upon reaching a certain realm, without my guidance to adjust it, such instability is inevitable. When I projected my consciousness into the Outer Hall, I was at my weakest and unable to assist you. However, without cultivating the Sacred Clan's divine arts, with your talent, reaching Nascent Soul would have been your limit.  Aren't you satisfied with your current cultivation and achievements?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders were speechless.  The Demon Lord was right. Without their encounter in the Outer Hall, they would have remained insignificant.</p><p>"Furthermore, without this hidden danger, would you have even come to see me?"</p><p>The Demon Lord's casual words sent a shiver down their spines.</p><p>"We swore oaths with our inner demons. How could we dare disobey?" The West Alliance Leader's expression shifted.</p><p>Unfazed, the Demon Lord said, "Rest assured. Trapped here for countless years, I have perfected the divine arts. I can easily resolve your instability. Even if you cultivate beyond the Void Refinement stage, there will be no further issues."</p><p>The Demon Lord's words were bold. Void Refinement was a realm they hadn't dared to dream of, let alone anything beyond it.</p><p>"Is this the vessel you've prepared for me?"</p><p>The grotesque face shifted.</p><p>Its empty sockets turned towards Su Nü.</p><p>The East Alliance Leader brought Su Nü before the stele.</p><p>Su Nü trembled.</p><p>After scrutinizing Su Nü, the Demon Lord's voice turned icy.  "Have you forgotten my commands entirely?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders' hearts skipped a beat.  The East Alliance Leader forced himself to remain calm, hastily explaining, "Your Majesty, please forgive us. The Nine Revolutions Yin Body and the other spiritual bodies you requested are exceedingly rare, even scarcer than Heavenly Spiritual Roots. They are virtually impossible to find now. We have mobilized the full force of the Alliance and are still searching. We have only found a few disciples with Yin meridians. This woman was discovered decades ago, at the Foundation Establishment stage. We spared no effort in assisting her cultivation, enabling her to reach the late Core Formation realm. Unfortunately, she failed during her Nascent Soul tribulation. However, she possesses the Five Yin Exquisite Body, second only to the Nine Revolutions Yin Body. Even with her slightly lower cultivation, she far surpasses those with mere Yin meridians."</p><p>After a moment of silence, the Demon Lord said coldly, "Fine! This vessel will suffice. Have you completed the other tasks?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The old demon was angered by Su Nü's insufficient cultivation but hadn't discovered their hidden maneuver.</p><p>The North Alliance Leader replied, "Your Majesty, we have imbued the auxiliary altars in the Outer Hall with Demonic Spirit Runes. The three main altars have also been tampered with, as you instructed. Once activated, they will suppress the Lightning Chains, destabilizing the entire sealing formation and aiding your escape..."</p><p>The North Alliance Leader briefly recounted their actions.</p><p>The other two also summarized their contributions.</p><p>"Well done."</p><p>The Demon Lord was pleased, a grotesque smile spreading across the face.  "What are you waiting for? Release me!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>The three exchanged uneasy glances.</p><p>The North Alliance Leader cautiously said, "Your Majesty, the instability in our cultivation..."</p><p>"Once I'm free, I will naturally impart the method to resolve your issues. You will become my generals, conquering and ruling the cultivation world alongside me. What benefit would I gain from letting you explode?"</p><p>The Demon Lord scoffed. "Do you need me to swear an oath with my inner demon?"</p><p>The three Alliance Leaders had intended to ask, but they remained silent.</p><p>The Demon Lord, without hesitation, swore an oath.</p><p>Their expressions eased slightly. They placed Su Nü before the stele and then surrounded it, taking their positions.  Their fingers moved rapidly, forming intricate hand seals.</p>
