<h1>Chapter 1970: Making a Move</h1><p>Outside the capital city of Yan.</p><p>A carriage departed from the official road, the path ahead winding into the mountains.  Lush vegetation flanked both sides, the terrain growing increasingly treacherous.</p><p>Driving the carriage was a powerfully built man. His temples bulged prominently, marking him at a glance as a martial arts expert, yet he contentedly served as a coachman.</p><p>On such a mountain path, even the highest martial arts skills were of little use.</p><p>After a difficult stretch, a voice called from within the carriage, "Stop here. Wait for us."</p><p>"Yes!" The coachman leaped down, standing respectfully at the side.</p><p>The curtain lifted, and Yu Lang and Tao Teng stepped out, proceeding on foot into the deep mountains. Their figures gradually disappeared amidst the trees.</p><p>The two men moved swiftly and surely, as if walking on level ground.</p><p>The atmosphere was somewhat oppressive. Tao Teng's face remained gloomy, burdened by unspoken thoughts.</p><p>"Is it that one?"</p><p>Having crossed a mountain ridge, Yu Lang pointed ahead.  A celestial mountain could be faintly glimpsed through the clouds and mist.</p><p>Tao Teng nodded absently.</p><p>Yu Lang sighed inwardly. Upon returning to the capital, he had discussed the situation with Sha Jiayu and revealed certain information to Tao Teng, which had left his friend in this state. He understood Tao Teng's aspirations and his current mood, but he didn't know how to console his friend.</p><p>"I've dragged you into this!"</p><p>Tao Teng suddenly spoke, his face filled with guilt.</p><p>After learning the truth, Tao Teng realized that there was something unusual about his master.</p><p>Initially, he hadn't even broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.  It should have been a time for dedicated cultivation, yet his master had allowed him to descend the mountain, even seeming to encourage it, without any concern for delaying his progress.</p><p>Tao Teng dared not think too deeply.</p><p>However, his instincts told him that what he least wanted to accept might be the truth!</p><p>Perhaps even Yu Lang and Daoist Qingfeng had been implicated because of him.</p><p>After becoming his master's disciple, he recalled his experience at the Drunken Fragrance Pavilion.  The more he pondered the conversation between the storyteller and Daoist Qingfeng, the more he felt that both were extraordinary individuals. Naturally, he had asked his master about them.</p><p>What if his master had long foreseen the coming chaos and was directly involved?</p><p>What if the cultivation world was as Sha Jiayu described, with everyone caught in the storm, tossed and turned by the wind and rain?</p><p>Originally, the master and disciple had lived in seclusion at the Green Ram Temple, healing the sick and cultivating in peace, yet because of him, their tranquility was shattered.</p><p>Yu Lang sighed softly, "You were also kept in the dark.  Inviting me down the mountain was well-intentioned.  Since things have come to this, don't dwell on it too much."</p><p>In truth, he also harbored some worries, but not excessively.</p><p>His master's words had inexplicably filled him with confidence.</p><p>The mountain path disappeared here. The two concealed their forms, activating their artifacts and flying towards the celestial mountain.  They landed before a stone cave.</p><p>Tao Teng knelt, "Disciple greets Master."</p><p>"Junior Qin Yulang, pays respects to Senior."</p><p>Yu Lang bowed respectfully.</p><p>After a moment of silence, a vigorous voice echoed from within the cave, "Why has my disciple returned?"</p><p>The stone door remained closed.</p><p>Tao Teng lowered his head, trying to maintain a calm voice as he recounted the information Yu Lang had shared, seeking confirmation from his master.</p><p>Upon hearing this, his master showed no surprise, his tone indifferent, "Since you already know, what do you intend to do?"</p><p>"Disciple has some questions for Master."</p><p>Tao Teng paused. Seeing no response from his master, he continued, "Do cultivators enter the mortal world to use mortals as pawns, driving them to war against each other until the nations are unified and a victor emerges?"</p><p>"Yes," his master admitted frankly, offering no further explanation.</p><p>Tao Teng's body trembled slightly. He pressed on, "Will the cultivators who have entered the mortal world participate in battles, using treasures and spells to slaughter mortals?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"But, without the Divine Path's oversight, their every word and action will still have a tremendous impact on the mortal world. With them present, unless mortals are slaughtered to near extinction, the wars may never end!"</p><p>Tao Teng's voice was heavy.</p><p>"In wars between mortals, when one army is routed, it doesn't need to suffer more than half its strength in casualties.  Sometimes, it's not even due to losses on the battlefield. The commanding general might simply surrender after assessing the situation and finding his strength insufficient, or due to factors beyond the battlefield.</p><p>"Cultivators will change this dynamic.</p><p>"For instance, they don't need to participate directly in battle. They only need to reveal their identities as cultivators to the rulers or generals, promising them immortality pills or guidance on the path of cultivation, deceiving them with false promises.</p><p>"There will certainly be those who are swayed, driven to achieve their goals at any cost, exhausting every last soldier, even driving all their citizens onto the battlefield, unwilling to admit defeat!</p><p>"Under such immense incentives, rebellions could erupt at any moment, creating an endless cycle of conflict!"</p><p>After listening to Tao Teng, his master simply uttered, "Oh? And what is your solution?"</p><p>"Disciple has two ideas.</p><p>"First, cultivators should no longer conceal their identities. They should openly serve as generals and ministers, fighting on the front lines, engaging in direct confrontations using their divine abilities.</p><p>"Second, cultivators should be strictly forbidden from influencing mortals. They should allow the mortal world to determine its own fate through conventional means and then depart, preventing needless prolonged suffering."</p><p>This was the only thing they could do for the people of Yan, a solution he and Yu Lang had painstakingly devised.</p><p>By drawing cultivators into open conflict, they could naturally reduce the number of mortal casualties.</p><p>Without the interference of cultivators, he and his brother, working together, could potentially lead Yan to continuous victory, thus fulfilling their duty to the people of Yan.</p><p>It was precisely as Sha Jiayu had said, do their utmost!</p><p>Silence reigned within the cave for a moment. His master neither agreed nor disagreed, saying only, "Return down the mountain. Achieve great merit, and upon returning to the sect, ample rewards await."</p><p>Tao Teng opened his mouth, then let out a bitter laugh, "Disciple only wishes to restore a golden age to the people of Yan. I dare not hope for anything else."</p><p>He dared not speak further, kowtowing and taking his leave.</p><p>Yu Lang stood silently by the side.  As he was about to bid farewell, Tao Teng's master called him back.</p><p>"Your master, Daoist Qingfeng, is someone I've long admired from afar. He dares to discuss the Lesser and Greater Vehicles of Buddhism, suggesting he is surely an enlightened individual.</p><p>"Tao Teng says your master lives in secluded cultivation. I wouldn't wish to intrude, and due to various matters, I haven't been able to visit.</p><p>"Convey a message to your master on my behalf.</p><p>"Great change is imminent, and all are caught in the tribulation.</p><p>"When necessary, I hope the Daoist will not hesitate to lend a hand. Of course, such opportunities will not be numerous.</p><p>"Under normal circumstances, no one will disturb the Daoist's tranquility!"</p><p>Yu Lang waited for a moment, ensuring Tao Teng's master had nothing further to add, and respectfully replied, "This junior will certainly deliver the message."</p><p>The two returned the way they came.</p><p>From beginning to end, they never saw Tao Teng's master's true face.</p><p>Descending the mountain, Yu Lang pondered silently.</p><p>The situation wasn't as dire as Sha Jiayu had described.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Fallen Soul Abyss were not simply treating the various factions as slaves, driving them as they pleased. They were employing both appeasement and suppression, rather than simply overwhelming them with their superior forces.</p><p>This was what it meant to play the game.</p><p>Just as the Bai Li Clan was being suppressed, his own master was clearly being courted.</p><p>His being persuaded by Tao Teng to descend the mountain was a brilliant move. From that moment on, his master's stance had already begun to shift.</p><p>His master had likely seen through their scheme from the start, having a tacit understanding, which was why he wasn't worried.</p><p>Thinking this, Yu Lang felt completely at ease.</p><p>Little did he know, his thoughts only scratched the surface.</p><p>...</p><p>After descending the mountain.</p><p>Tao Teng and Yu Lang dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to assisting the ruler, diligently strengthening Yan's national power.</p><p>They trained their troops and prepared their horses, ready for the coming era of great strife.</p><p>War arrived as expected.</p><p>The northern kingdom of Qi launched a sudden attack. Yan steadily retreated, but did not send reinforcements to the north.</p><p>Yu Lang held court in the capital, while Tao Teng led the army. One managing internal affairs, the other external, they calmly and methodically swept through the smaller nations surrounding Yan.</p><p>In just three short years, all the surrounding nations submitted, and Yan's national power reached its zenith.</p><p>Not only Yan, but the entire mortal world was in chaos.</p><p>Large nations annexed small nations, large nations fractured internally, and large nations waged war against each other.</p><p>Annexation and division were commonplace.</p><p>By this time, the struggle for the throne in the Great Liang Kingdom still hadn't ended, and the nation teetered on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Behind this, there were naturally the two opposing factions at play, and discerning eyes could see the shadows of cultivators.</p><p>Yan, while resisting Qi, also colluded with the third prince of Great Liang, participating in the succession struggle.</p><p>Similar scenarios played out repeatedly across the mortal world.</p><p>Even within the same faction, conflicts arose due to competition for merit. No one was willing to be subservient to another, and they always had to determine a victor before uniting.</p><p>The mortal world was engulfed in flames of war, becoming increasingly chaotic, with cultivators appearing everywhere.</p><p>Under the combined efforts of Yu Lang and Tao Teng, Yan gradually rose to prominence, its territory expanding continuously.</p><p>Were it not for the ever-present shadow of the cultivation world hanging overhead, preventing the cessation of hostilities, Yan might have truly entered an unprecedented golden age!</p><p>However, the price was incredibly heavy.</p><p>...</p><p>The mortal world was filled with smoke and fire.</p><p>The cultivation world was rife with constant battles.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's domain remained a sanctuary, unaffected by the turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang's forces had all been sent down the mountain, leaving his domain temporarily deserted.</p><p>Only a few remaining demon soldiers diligently patrolled the perimeter at regular intervals.</p><p>The cave at the summit remained tightly sealed.</p><p>One day.</p><p>The stone door quietly opened, and Qin Sang emerged.</p><p>He looked out beyond the mountains, his gaze seemingly sweeping across the entire fiery domain.</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang extended his hand, beckoning.  A golden thread shot out from the magma, revealing the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had successfully undergone tribulation, advancing to its fifth transformation, its appearance even more imposing and ferocious.</p><p>It was one of the few fifth-transformation Fire Jade Centipedes in existence.</p><p>However, after breaking through to the fifth transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't exhibited any other unusual changes, and the Water-Fire Divine Centipede remained but a distant dream.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to further aid the Fire Jade Centipede, so he could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>Next, a butterfly shadow flew from his dantian, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Unfortunately, helping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly break through to the sixth transformation wasn't easy either. Otherwise, it would have become another powerful asset for Qin Sang.</p><p>The man and the two insects vanished from sight.</p><p>Qin Sang then proceeded to traverse the entire fiery domain.</p><p>Utilizing the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-finding abilities and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's divine vision, he explored every nook and cranny.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang paid particular attention to the ruins previously discovered by the Fallen Soul Abyss's Corpse Demons.</p><p>He wanted to know what exactly the two great powers were so interested in, what drove them to such lengths.</p><p>Both powers continued to dispatch experts into the fiery domain, including top-tier Late Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, their Soul Formation cultivators remained inactive, calmly observing the situation. These individuals alone wouldn't be able to discover Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that new ruins had been unearthed during this time.</p><p>Among them, the Fallen Soul Abyss controlled the majority.</p><p>It appeared that the Fallen Soul Abyss had gained the upper hand.</p><p>There were some places Qin Sang couldn't easily force his way into. After careful observation, he confirmed that these locations were intricately connected to the copper pillars.</p><p>During his travels, Qin Sang happened to witness a clash between the two factions.</p><p>A new ruin had been discovered.</p><p>Four of the Cloud Metropolis Heaven's Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals appeared, matched by an equal number from the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>As the two sides clashed, neither noticed a figure stealthily infiltrating the ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the ruins, unafraid of the arrival of their respective patriarchs.</p><p>As expected, these ruins shared a common origin with his own domain.</p><p>After some exploration, Qin Sang discovered further differences.</p><p>The restrictions within these ruins, while seemingly similar to those in his domain, actually differed significantly.</p><p>By comparison, the formations and restrictions in his domain were more complex and profound, suggesting they constituted a more crucial component.</p><p>"Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation…"</p><p>Standing at the center of the ruins, Qin Sang repeated these four words he had recently learned.</p><p>He had never heard of such an ancient formation before.</p><p>But even these current discoveries were enough to astound.</p><p>If each ruin represented only a part of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation, then this ancient formation was likely even grander than the Altar Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that the entire fiery domain was merely a small part of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation.</p><p>If this were true, the power of the faction that had set up this ancient formation was unimaginable.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Fallen Soul Abyss combined couldn't compare, which explained their intense interest.</p><p>Qin Sang also wanted to find other ruins, but even with the help of the two spirit insects, he found nothing.</p><p>Clearly, they possessed special methods.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang ceased wasting his efforts.</p><p>Having visited every excavated ruin, Qin Sang concluded that the copper pillars were undoubtedly a crucial part of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation.</p><p>This presented an opportunity!</p><p>Having completed his exploration, Qin Sang returned to his domain, entering the fire chamber and contemplating the copper pillars.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang flew above his domain once more, directing a series of hand seals downwards.</p><p>With Qin Sang's movements, the entire domain trembled.</p><p>Magma churned, and formation flags rose from the ground, pulling the mountain peaks upwards with them.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The mountain peaks floated in midair.</p><p>Surrounded by the whirling formation flags, they rapidly spun, embedding themselves into the mountainside.</p><p>With a resounding boom, all the unusual phenomena vanished.</p><p>A Vermillion Bird appeared behind Qin Sang, carrying the mountain peak.  He flew to a pre-selected magma lake and plunged into its depths.</p><p>The cave, along with the demon soldiers within, was submerged, concealed from view.</p><p>More than two hundred years ago, Qin Sang had personally established this domain, and now he personally destroyed it.</p><p>The domain reverted to its original state, the ruins resurfacing.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his fingers, gradually restoring the ruins' restrictions to their former appearance.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't fully restore the ruins, removing the copper pillar and its most crucial components.</p><p>Qin Sang had already sealed the area around his domain, so the entire process, though accompanied by unusual phenomena, didn't alert anyone.</p><p>Having completed these preparations, Qin Sang looked towards the south.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis Heaven's Supreme Patriarch, Gu Yun Sou, and the Fallen Soul Abyss's Undying Bone Nether Falcon Patriarch, were engrossed in their game of Go.</p><p>It was time for him to make his move!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression hardened slightly.  With a sweep of his sleeve, he carried the copper pillar and flew south.</p><p>He flew out of the fiery domain and into the desert.</p><p>Beneath the desert, subterranean fire veins connected to the fiery domain stretched outwards, essentially making the desert an extension of the fiery domain.</p><p>Traveling through the desert, Qin Sang arrived at a particular location and stopped.</p><p>This was the place Qin Sang had chosen to make his move!</p>
