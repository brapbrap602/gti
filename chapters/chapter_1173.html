<h1>Chapter 1165: The Yao Wang's Meeting</h1><p>Chapter 1165: The Yao Wang's Meeting</p><p>“Establishing a sect is no easy feat.”</p><p>Qin Sang, having settled matters at the Moyan Gate, began his journey home.  Reflecting on his recent endeavors, a weariness settled upon him, prompting a sigh.  The responsibilities of a sect leader – absolute authority, the reverence of countless disciples – were undeniably gratifying, yet not what he truly sought. He had simply intended to take on a few useful disciples.</p><p>Fortunately, he now had several capable subordinates. Li Yu Fu and Mei Gu could each lead independently and would become pillars of the sect. Zhao Shanran and Tan Yi'en were less gifted, but Qin Sang had no shortage of  Sha Yao pills and planned to help them achieve Nascent Soul stage.  Both possessed excellent character; one to assist Mei Gu in managing sect affairs, the other adept at handling internal and external matters.</p><p>Furthermore, Qingyang View, similar to the Yuling Sect, possessed unparalleled advantages.  By collaborating with the Yao race in the Qianshan Bamboo Sea, disciples could attempt to gain the recognition of spirit beasts, thus establishing a sect spanning both human and Yao races.  As long as the ancient teleportation array remained functional, a steady supply of Sha Yao pills would be ensured.</p><p>Of course, compared to established major sects, Qingyang View still lagged significantly, especially in terms of foundation and legacy. Even Li Yu Fu, the most powerful cultivator, was only in the early Nascent Soul stage; the Yuan Ying stage was still a long way off.  Qin Sang understood this couldn't be rushed. With him, Qingyang View's strength would steadily increase. The framework was in place; only a location with abundant spiritual energy needed to be found for the sect's headquarters.</p><p>In the future, Qin Sang wouldn't dedicate excessive energy to the sect; his own cultivation was paramount.</p><p>On his return journey, Qin Sang again detoured to Shaohua Mountain, hoping to see Mu Yifeng. He had failed to do so previously.  Mu Yifeng had become a hermit, spending years in seclusion.  At the time, Qin Sang dared not contact Mu Yifeng openly, fearing repercussions.  This time, Shaohua Mountain was already sealed, and he still didn't meet him.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, deciding not to rush.  He would certainly be heading to the front lines; if Mu Yifeng was there, they could meet. His own strength had vastly improved; ensuring Mu Yifeng's safety was now within his capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang then returned to the Yuanshen Gate, planning to complete the first step of his cultivation technique – imbuing his sword soul with killing talismans – before embarking on any further actions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon his return, he found the gluttonous and lecherous avian duo had arrived and been waiting for many days.</p><p>“Master! You’re finally back! We’ve been waiting anxiously! A day apart feels like three autumns; a year apart…”</p><p>The fat chicken rushed forward, fawning obsequiously, launching into a torrent of words.  Mid-sentence, realizing it was speaking without making a sound, it saw Qin Sang’s displeasure and wisely shut up.</p><p>“Where’s Bai He? Didn’t he come with you?”</p><p>As Qin Sang finished speaking, a crane's cry echoed from afar.  Bai He and a vibrantly colored spirit bird soared together. Mid-flight, Bai He elegantly waved its wings, bidding farewell to the spirit bird, which responded with a mournful cry.</p><p>“Master is well,”</p><p>Bai He dared not be too flamboyant in front of Qin Sang, maintaining a respectful demeanor.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “You dare flirt around even in human territory?  You're courting death! I thought you only liked hooking up with Phoenix descendants.  A mere early-stage spirit bird, freshly enlightened, can also capture your heart?”</p><p>Bai He sighed, “The Yao of this realm are so disappointing.  Not a single Phoenix descendant is to be found, so I had to settle.  Although only in the early stage, its plumage is exquisite – perfectly straight, with clear textures. The curve of its beak is captivating, particularly enchanting. While it has some flaws – the feathers aren’t vibrantly colored enough, the color blocks are too chaotic, the voice not crisp enough – it’s still quite rare…”</p><p>It smacked its beak thoughtfully.</p><p>A hint of melancholy clouded Bai He’s expression; stranded here, it couldn’t tell when it would return to its glorious homeland.  Qin Sang had strictly forbidden it from mentioning the Yao Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his eye.</p><p>The lecherous bird was quite articulate, but Qin Sang couldn't see what made this bird superior to others.</p><p>“Alright, what is it?”</p><p>Ignoring Bai He's self-pity, Qin Sang turned to the fat chicken.</p><p>“Reporting to Master, Elder Liu sent us both.  The Feather Yao Wang sent a message that a meeting will be held in Wan Yao City soon, to inquire whether Master and the Bamboo Yao Elder are available to attend.  Attendance is not mandatory.”</p><p>The fat chicken handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, “Has the battle situation changed?”</p><p>The fat chicken hesitated, “Old Monkey just returned with news, things seem normal on the front lines.”</p><p>After reading the jade slip, Qin Sang learned that one of the purposes of this meeting was related to the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then nodded.  "Very well. Tell Elder Liu I will personally go to Wan Yao City."</p><p>"Master, Master..."</p><p>Fat Chicken, fawning, sidled up. "If you are disguised as a demon king, wouldn't it weaken your presence without a mount and attendants?  My cultivation is decent; let us stay by your side to assist you with small matters."</p><p>"Sycophant!"</p><p>Bai He, unable to contain himself any longer, muttered under his breath before hurrying to join them.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it and agreed.  Having Fat Chicken, who had roamed the Demon Realm for years, would prevent him from revealing any ignorance of the area.</p><p>Qin Sang bypassed Yuan Shen Gate and continued north, accompanied by the two birds.  They passed Li Yu Fu's cave dwelling.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and Tan Yi En came out to greet him, bearing good news.</p><p>"Master Uncle, Han Qiu sensed a chance to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage and is currently in seclusion."</p><p>"Excellent. This should be her last chance. Let's hope she seizes it. Yi En, I asked you to contact your father's acquaintances. Have you had any leads?" Qin Sang turned to Tan Yi En.</p><p>Tan Yi En replied, "Following your instructions, Master Uncle, I contacted several of my father's friends or their families in recent years.  Some died unexpectedly, others are stuck at the Foundation Establishment stage, nearing the end of their lifespans, with no hope of further advancement, having long severed ties with my father. However, they confirmed that two senior cultivators, both Golden Core stage, had close contact with my father in his final years. One was a solitary cultivator, the other a disciple of a major sect, but both have been dispatched to the battlefield and are unreachable for the time being."</p><p>"The battlefield?" Qin Sang's thoughts stirred.  "I'm going to Tian Yao Hill, and I intend to visit the front lines afterward. Yi En, go to Cang Heng Island and wait for me; you'll accompany me. Yu Fu, I recently took in a disciple in the Demon Path territory. A seed I planted there years ago unexpectedly grew into a large tree... You can help them get acquainted; the Mo Yan Sect will eventually merge into Qing Yang Temple."</p><p>Hearing this, Li Yu Fu's face lit up with joy. "I'll go tomorrow, Master!"</p><p>Starting anything is difficult. He racked his brains, realizing the complexities of establishing a sect were far more than he anticipated.</p><p>With the foundation of the Mo Yan Sect, developing Qing Yang Temple would be much easier.</p>
