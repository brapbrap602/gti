Chapter 484:  Demonic Cores


Yu Hua and Huang Jia Ren's consciousnesses had only recently been erased by Qin Sang.


Having gained experience refining the young man, and with two Foundation Establishment cultivators at his disposal, Qin Sang was confident he could successfully create at least one.


But this wasn't enough; only by succeeding with both could his plan proceed.


He placed them on the ground, not acting immediately, but instead sat cross-legged, entering a meditative state to stabilize his cultivation and refine his mental state.


He remained in this state for two days.


Two days later,


Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes. His pupils were deep and still, like a tranquil pool, devoid of any anxiety or hesitation.


His calm gaze swept over Yu Hua, then settled on Huang Jia Ren.


Five Element Yin materials flew from the corpse puppet bag, lining up before Qin Sang.  Huang Jia Ren cultivated a Metal-attribute technique, so Qin Sang reached for a piece of Blue Nether Gold.


He had prepared a large quantity of Five Element Yin materials; he had four large pieces of Blue Nether Gold, more than enough to create four living corpses.


The Blue Nether Gold melted in Qin Sang's palm, transforming into a small ball of viscous blue liquid.  It remained tightly clustered, not spreading even when Qin Sang released his spiritual energy.


After removing the few impurities from the Blue Nether Gold, Qin Sang injected the pure liquid into Huang Jia Ren's dantian, followed by Yin Spirit Water – he had plenty, several bottles full.


…


As the Five Element Yin materials entered Huang Jia Ren's body, Qin Sang continuously changed countless hand seals, step-by-step completing the corpse refinement restrictions.  He focused intently on each step, not daring to be distracted.


Soon, the Five Element Yin materials successfully established their foundation!


Externally, there was no visible change in Huang Jia Ren.


Qin Sang slowly exhaled, his expression becoming even more serious. The main event was yet to come: introducing the Earth Fiend Qi into the body, refining Huang Jia Ren into a true living corpse!


‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’


The Earth Fiend Qi in the abyss surged, and Qin Sang drew out a small strand.


Even though it was a small amount, it was incredibly violent.  Qin Sang used all his strength to suppress the Earth Fiend Qi, waiting until it calmed down before attempting to inject it into Huang Jia Ren.


He then opened his spiritual sense and examined Huang Jia Ren from head to toe countless times, paying particular attention to the dantian area, noting every minute change before he stopped.


‘Swish!’


The first attempt failed.


But Qin Sang was already skilled. Before the spiritual energy in Huang Jia Ren's dantian could erupt, he withdrew the strand of Earth Fiend Qi, then condensed a new one and tried again.


Failure followed failure.


Finally, the first strand of Earth Fiend Qi successfully merged with Huang Jia Ren's dantian.


Qin Sang quickly completed a hand seal, his spiritual sense sweeping across Huang Jia Ren's dantian. Within the spiritual energy, a black aura appeared, starkly out of place, yet somehow coexisting peacefully.


This was just the beginning; it was too soon to celebrate.


On Finger Heaven Peak, during the refinement of the young man, it was the second strand of Earth Fiend Qi that caused a sudden change, leading to failure.


However, Qin Sang was no longer the same, and he was prepared, so he wasn't panicked, calmly proceeding to the next step.


The second strand!


The third strand!


…


As time passed, the Earth Fiend Qi within Huang Jia Ren's body became increasingly full.


At least 90% of his attempts failed, yet Qin Sang showed no sign of discouragement because failure was nothing compared to the greater danger of Huang Jia Ren's unstable dantian.


Qin Sang remained highly focused, never being reckless. While there were several dangerous moments at the start, Qin Sang successfully resolved them, proceeding step-by-step.


In the dark depths of the cave,


Besides the surging Earth Fiend Qi, there were no other sounds.


Qin Sang continuously attempted to inject the Earth Fiend Qi into Huang Jia Ren's body, simultaneously completing complex hand seals at an increasing speed.


After an unknown amount of time,


Another strand of Earth Fiend Qi entered, causing a disturbance in Huang Jia Ren's dantian, which eventually subsided. Qin Sang widened his eyes; a rare ripple of emotion appeared in his usually calm gaze.


At this moment, his movements suddenly increased in speed by several times, his actions a blur as one complex hand seal after another landed on Huang Jia Ren.


"Merge!"


Qin Sang suddenly shouted, his palm seemingly slow yet swift, lightly pressing onto Huang Jia Ren's dantian.


‘Boom!’


A terrifying storm erupted within Huang Jia Ren's dantian, a silent tremor!


Huang Jia Ren's body trembled, the amplitude increasing, and the sturdy barrier created by the Five Element Yin materials began to shake. The restrictions on Huang Jia Ren's body also showed signs of collapse.


Qin Sang's expression was serious. He frantically channeled his spiritual energy into the Yellow Armor corpse through his palm.  The storm raged even more fiercely.

A powerful counterattack surged from the Yellow Armor corpse's dantian, trying to overwhelm Qin Sang.  But Qin Sang didn't move his hand, gritting his teeth and persevering.

Finally, the storm reached a peak and abruptly ceased.  The Yellow Armor corpse stood motionless in the distance.

Qin Sang was surprised. He quickly probed the corpse's energy sea with his spiritual sense and found it stable, the earth煞 energy and the corpse's own spiritual energy coexisting peacefully.  At Qin Sang's mental command, a portion of each energy separated and merged, flowing calmly through the corpse's meridians.

Success!

Qin Sang let out a long breath, his tense mind finally relaxing.  Only then did he realize how drained he felt; creating this living corpse had been incredibly taxing.

This success boosted Qin Sang's confidence. He tested the Yellow Armor corpse's strength before storing it in his corpse puppet bag.  After recovering his peak condition through cultivation, he summoned Yu Hua.

...

Two days later.

A figure emerged from the entrance of the Deep Pit Cave.  After checking the direction, it headed south into the Yun Cang Marshes.

Even with Qin Sang's resolute nature, a hint of excitement showed on his face.  The Yellow Armor corpse and Yu Hua—creating both living corpses had been perilous, but he had overcome the dangers, and both were successfully completed!

Dark clouds gathered over the Yun Cang Marshes, a chilling rain falling, but Qin Sang felt no oppression.  He flew swiftly on his cloud, eager to reach the area of the Turbulent Islands.

After a long journey, he finally saw the misty sea formed by the True Water Thousand Illusions Formation in the distance.  Qin Sang landed his cloud, stealthily entered the formation, disguised himself as a masked man in black robes, and headed straight for Mist Island.

The unusually obese Manager Bao's face crumpled into a flower when he saw Qin Sang.  He personally led Qin Sang to a quiet room, excitedly whispering on the way,  "Friend, you've kept Master Bao waiting for so long!  These past days, I haven't been able to eat or sleep properly, my cultivation has been disrupted, and I've lost several pounds just waiting for news from you... What was the result?"

Manager Bao looked at Qin Sang anxiously, terrified of hearing bad news.

*This guy is really obsessed with living corpses,* Qin Sang thought, chuckling lightly before saying, "Manager Bao, is the demon core ready?"
