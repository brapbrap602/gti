<h1>Chapter 688:  Assassination</h1><p>Qin Sang said nothing, seemingly ignoring the pursuer, and continued flying forward.  The pursuer became even bolder, making no attempt to hide their intentions, trailing far behind but maintaining a safe distance.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped, hovering above the water, and turned to face their pursuer.  The pursuer immediately slowed their flight, facing them across the vast sea, displaying no urgency, appearing almost pleased.</p><p>"Go ahead," Qin Sang instructed, then instantly attacked, merging with his sword in a counter-attack.</p><p>The pursuer immediately fled, their speed matching Qin Sang's, indicating at least Foundation Establishment stage cultivation.  But Qin Sang relentlessly pursued, his sword light dazzlingly bright, cutting through the thundering sky like a lightning bolt—the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique. The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>The pursuer, startled, desperately fled, but still couldn't outrun Qin Sang.  In a panic, they produced an item from a pouch and slapped it onto themselves, their speed instantly increasing, matching Qin Sang's Sword Qi Thunder Sound.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, stopped his pursuit, his eyes narrowed in thought. He'd seen the pursuer use a talisman to achieve such speed, indicating they weren't particularly strong.</p><p>Qin Sang formulated a plan, feigning exhaustion, turning his sword light and returning to the elderly couple and the others.</p><p>"Senior, he's waiting for reinforcements to ambush us," the elder said, trembling, seeing Qin Sang's unsuccessful pursuit and the pursuer's brazen return. He'd never encountered such audacity, especially near Duoyan Island.</p><p>Qin Sang, without needing the elder's warning, had already reached the same conclusion. But he thought deeper.</p><p>Duoyan Island's master was a Nascent Soul cultivator, the undisputed ruler of the surrounding seas, and no one dared break their established rules.  Something unusual was happening, and there had to be a reason.</p><p>"Could something have changed on Duoyan Island or in the Demon Sea in the few years I've been away?" Qin Sang muttered.  He had been focused on cultivation and hadn't returned to Duoyan Island, preventing Ran Luo from contacting him about any changes.</p><p>Duoyan Island had been peaceful for years, and the island master wasn't near the end of their lifespan.  This incident was unexpected.</p><p>Returning to Duoyan Island rashly could mean walking into a chaotic situation, something Qin Sang wanted to avoid.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, as he glanced at the figure relentlessly pursuing them. Perhaps he could learn what was happening from this person.</p><p>He only had five Foundation Establishment cultivators with him, who couldn't help and were more of a liability. Even with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang didn't dare risk being surrounded, otherwise, there might be no chance of escape.</p><p>The pursuer's companions were surely nearby, and any delay would worsen the situation.  Since the pursuer had malicious intent, Qin Sang wouldn't show mercy.</p><p>His mind racing, Qin Sang remained still and transmitted a message: "Take my illusory image and continue forward, without acting strangely. I will deal with him. If you see us fighting, immediately return to Duoyan Island for help, or, after losing sight of him, find somewhere to hide. Don't worry about me, I can handle myself."</p><p>After a quick discussion and forming a plan, everyone simultaneously accelerated their flight. The pursuer immediately responded by speeding up.  But they didn't notice that, at the same moment, Qin Sang, using the others' flight as cover, employed a spell to create a realistic illusion of himself while secretly disappearing underwater.</p><p>This illusion was not effective against cultivators of the same level and could be easily seen through.  But the pursuer was far away, and the illusion would suffice.</p><p>The others, with Qin Sang's illusion, flew away without looking back, while Qin Sang used the "Elusive Spirit Technique" to hide beneath the surface, waiting for the pursuer.</p><p>Soon, the pursuer caught up—a young man in his twenties wearing a strange black robe.  His eyes were fixed on the elderly couple, completely unaware of the trap beneath the water.</p><p>Just as the young man in black was about to pass over Qin Sang's hiding place, the calm surface shattered like a mirror, and a lightning-fast sword light shot out from the fragments.</p><p>In an instant, the thunderbolt transformed into a spirit sword, appearing before the young man in black, revealing the deadly intent!  Qin Sang, having confirmed the young man's cultivation was similar to Du Han's, attacked without hesitation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the young man in black showed no alarm, instead breaking into a sly smile and coldly sneering, "I've seen you all along!"</p><p>"Golden Armor!"</p><p>The young man in black shouted, his body instantly erupting in blinding golden light.  In the nick of time, he transformed into a suit of golden armor, completely shielding himself.</p><p>He seemed supremely confident in this armor, facing the spirit sword without dodging. He sneered, "Sword Qi Thunder Sound. It seems you're an elite human cultivator…"</p><p>Time slowed.</p><p>The instant the golden light appeared, the ebony sword pierced towards him.</p><p>But even faster than the ebony sword was a bizarrely vibrant crimson light.</p><p>The golden armor was useless against this crimson light.  It pierced the armor, splashing onto the young man in black.</p><p>"What is that?!"</p><p>The young man in black shrieked.</p><p>Touched by the crimson light, the spiritual energy of his inner armor was greatly weakened, and the golden armor rapidly dimmed.  Terror struck him; he lost all composure. He tried to dodge, but his movements were too slow for the ebony sword.</p><p>The ebony sword shattered the golden armor, but was momentarily hindered just before piercing the young man.</p><p>A sharp 'crack' echoed as the young man's black robe was shredded by the sword energy, revealing a golden inner armor beneath.</p><p>A crack was now clearly visible on the inner armor!</p><p>The inner armor's remarkable hardness surprised Qin Sang. The Blood-Soiling Divine Light could defile a treasure's spiritual energy, but it didn't affect the material itself.</p><p>This inner armor must have been crafted from an extremely hard spiritual material.</p><p>The ebony sword paused slightly, then immediately stabbed again at the crack in the armor. This time, the sword's shadow flickered, splitting into another almost identical sword light.</p><p>The young man in black was startled, his figure recoiling.  At the same time, a green light surged from his dantian, forming a spirit insect phantom a man's height in front of him.</p><p>This insect had enormous mandibles filled with sharp teeth. With a wide gape, it clamped down on both the ebony sword and its illusory counterpart.</p>
