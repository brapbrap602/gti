<h1>Chapter 293: The First Restriction</h1><p>Chapter 293: The First Restriction</p><p>Time was running out; there was no time to continue searching for a safe path. Other than barging through, no one could come up with a better solution.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was quite proficient in the Dao of Restrictions, he had seen the tip of the iceberg of the restrictions in the mist. He was not confident in being able to crack the code in a short amount of time.</p><p>As a result, they could only follow Yu Kong’s suggestion.</p><p>Yan Wu spoke up, "The four of us can form two groups of two, to assist each other..."</p><p>Before Yan Wu could finish speaking, Yu Kong pointed a finger at him and stated without question, "Yan Wu, you will be in a group with Daoist Wu Chen, while Daoist Qingfeng and Daoist Shangguan will team up and work together because they are more compatible!"</p><p>Yan Wu was stunned for a moment. His heart was slightly discontent. He opened his mouth to say something further, but when his gaze met Yu Kong’s cold stare, he suddenly shivered and realized that the little bit of friendship he had with Yu Kong was not enough to make Yu Kong help him wholeheartedly, against all odds.</p><p>If Yan Wu’s personal grudges were to affect their quest, Yu Kong would not hesitate to teach him a lesson first.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wu suddenly heard a buzzing sound as faint as a mosquito.</p><p>After receiving Yu Kong’s promise, Yan Wu was overjoyed. He let go of his worries and discreetly glanced at Qin Sang. Then, he immediately followed Yu Kong’s orders and walked to Wu Chen’s side.</p><p>"Daoist Wu, please take care of me."</p><p>The others did not seem to notice the small actions between him and Yu Kong.</p><p>"Me too..."</p><p>Wu Chen hurriedly returned the greeting, but his smile was somewhat bitter. If it were not for Yu Kong’s order, he would not have wanted to work with Yan Wu.</p><p>He was not afraid of Yan Wu harming him, but if Yan Wu were to be like them, wavering about saving someone in danger, Yan Wu was Yu Kong’s man.</p><p>Wu Chen could not help but worry that if something unexpected were to happen when they were breaking through, would Yu Kong take it out on him?</p><p>Not only did he have to protect his own life, he also had to pay attention to saving Yan Wu, which doubled the danger.</p><p>Wu Chen sighed inwardly.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng walked to Qin Sang’s side and raised his saber slightly, "Daoist Qingfeng, I do not know much about your swordsmanship. If there are any areas where we do not coordinate well, please give me some guidance."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and said, "Daoist Shangguan is too humble. I will also watch out for opportunities to coordinate with you. However, we do not know the situation yet. It is better to wait until we go in and then make a plan."</p><p>"The Daoist is right."</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng did not say much more. He immediately put away his saber and did not utter a word.</p><p>After agreeing on this, the five of them formed a formation. Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng were on the left, while Wu Chen and Yan Wu were on the right, acting as the pathfinders for Yu Kong.</p><p>The power of the restrictions around the mountain was similar. They did not have time to differentiate carefully. They随便 found a spot and walked into the barrier.</p><p>There was no change in the scenery; they only felt that their vision went dark for a moment before it suddenly brightened up. Then, a wave of heat hit their faces, and a cyan flame struck down from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had been on alert all along. The moment they felt the heat, they immediately took action.</p><p>Several spiritual powers almost simultaneously struck the fire stream, directly scattering it and then driving the scattered flames to one side. They then surveyed their surroundings.</p><p>They had actually ended up in a world filled with raging flames.</p><p>Above, below, left, right—there were flames burning everywhere, making the air almost unbearable.</p><p>These flames did not adhere to anything. They burned and drifted in the void, but they lasted for a long time.</p><p>The flames around them were not very dense. A few large and small flames were drifting around. Just now, they were unlucky to have alarmed a flame stream as soon as they entered. Fortunately, its power was not strong, so they had easily broken it up.</p><p>However, the flames around them suddenly became denser, and they joined together to form an endless sea of fire.</p><p>Flames blazed fiercely, covering the sky and blocking out the sun.</p><p>The flames in each direction were also different in color. Some were the same cyan color as the one they had encountered earlier, and some were gray and white or a normal shade of scarlet fire...</p><p>There were eight different colored flames in the eight directions, including front, back, left, and right. They were distributed evenly, like a八卦 fire pan, surrounding them.</p><p>Yu Kong had been observing the changes in the flames. He let out a soft gasp, "The illusionary scene in this restriction is somewhat familiar. When I passed through the guardian formation last time, I encountered this kind of flame formation."</p><p>Seeing the power of these flames, the others were slightly anxious, but hearing this, they were delighted.</p><p>Wu Chen asked as if he were relieved, "Senior Yu has found a way to break the restriction?"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Kong shook his head slowly and said, "Not yet. This restriction seems to have some connection to the guardian formation, but there are also significant differences. You’ll have to go in and try it out. Based on my previous experience, these eight colored flames should represent eight paths. No matter which path you take, you will eventually find a door. However, only one of them is the real exit. If you choose the wrong door, you will fall into the next level of the restriction, which will greatly increase the difficulty of breaking it."</p><p>To make matters worse, this is only one of several restrictions. If an accident should trigger a ripple effect that destabilizes all the restrictions, we’ll be in grave danger.”</p><p>Wu Chen’s face grew pale, and he exclaimed in horror: “The first restriction is already so dangerous…”</p><p>Yu Kong smiled slightly. “Daoist Wu, there’s no need to be concerned. Breaking the restriction will not be difficult, as long as we find the right approach. Now, you will all enter the sea of fire in pairs. You don’t need to force your way to the end of the sea of fire, but rather go halfway and remain there for at least thirty breaths. Yu will be able to observe the changes and discern which is the false gateway and which is the real exit. If you encounter any danger, retreat immediately and Yu will definitely do everything to save you.”</p><p>After saying this, Yu Kong sat cross-legged on the ground and took out three small flags, which he planted beside him.</p><p>The flags formed a cloud qi barrier that would protect him from the flames and allow him to observe the changes in the restriction undisturbed.</p><p>Yu Kong’s eyes gleamed, and he nodded to indicate that they could begin.</p><p>There was nothing to distinguish the eight directions from their appearance. Other than their different colors, these flames seemed no different, so it made no difference which direction they chose.</p><p>Wu Chen and Yan Wu entered the gray-white flames, while Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng discussed as they approached the bluish-purple sea of fire in front of them.</p><p>Qin Sang brandished his Ebonywood Sword, while Shangguan Lifeng held his saber in both hands.</p><p>They had learned a little about each other while hunting the cloud beast before this. They were not close enough to act as one, but simple cooperation was no problem.</p><p>Sword qi and saber qi joined forces to disperse several flames that surged towards them, and the two of them appeared in front of the sea of fire.</p><p>The sea of fire was boundless, with not a single crack in it.</p><p>Countless fiery tongues shot out of the sea of fire, licking at their protective spiritual energy.</p><p>【Collect free good books】Follow v.x [Book Friends Base Camp] to recommend your favorite novels and get cash红包!</p><p>Surrounded by raging flames, even their hair and beards seemed to curl.</p><p>“Daoist Qingfeng, we two should go side-by-side. If we both fall into danger at the same time, we might not be able to respond quickly enough. It would be better for one of us to go in front and the other behind, which would make it easier to respond,” suggested Shangguan Lifeng.</p>
