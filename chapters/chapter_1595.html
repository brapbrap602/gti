<h1>Chapter 1586: Reunion with an Old Friend</h1><p>Qin Sang listened to the discussions of the cultivators nearby.</p><p>This was the third area Su Zinan had searched.</p><p>The previous two had yielded nothing.</p><p>Cultivators gathered on several nearby islands, observing the outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what methods Su Zinan had employed.</p><p>The distant sea surface bulged high, seawater continuously pouring outward. Qin Sang flew a bit higher and saw that the bulge was ring-shaped, forming a bottomless pit in the center.</p><p>Within the pit, lights of various colors flickered incessantly. The fluctuations of magical treasures and Daoist techniques were clearly perceptible.</p><p>Several figures floated within the pit.</p><p>A few of them were clearly the core group.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, discerning their appearances.</p><p>One of them, dressed in white robes with a jade belt, handsome and elegant, was none other than the currently most prominent Su Zinan.  His appearance was indeed quite well-matched with Yue Fei.</p><p>“That old devil truly wasn't Su Zinan,” Qin Sang recalled Wu Lao.</p><p>He remembered the old devil didn't have the Nether Moon Mark on his forehead, meaning he wasn't a Nether Moon Guard. His status within Luye remained unknown.</p><p>Glancing over the other figures, Qin Sang noticed the man beside Su Zinan.</p><p>This person remained silent, standing there quietly, giving off an otherworldly feeling.</p><p>“Mo Xingdao, the number one rogue cultivator of the Northern Wasteland. What is this person’s connection to Luye… As expected of a Nascent Soul lineage, they have at least three Grand Cultivators, openly or covertly! Could the old devil not be here? Or is he hidden in the shadows, providing support for Su Zinan?”</p><p>Qin Sang observed Mo Xingdao for a moment, then awakened the Celestial Eye Butterfly, searching secretly.</p><p>From those around Su Zinan to the outermost onlookers,</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over everyone, but found no one resembling Wu Lao.</p><p>The setting sun dipped into the sea.</p><p>As night fell, the treasure light within the pit suddenly vanished.  Su Zinan flew out of the pit with a gloomy expression. Mo Xingdao and the others followed closely.  The seawater receded, returning to its original state.</p><p>Then, ignoring everyone else, Su Zinan flew straight back to the Chinan Island Chain.</p><p>As expected, the search had failed again.</p><p>…</p><p>For the next month,</p><p>Qin Sang followed Su Zinan to various locations, each time filled with anticipation but returning disappointed.</p><p>Su Zinan's movements were completely erratic, running around in all directions.</p><p>After so many attempts, Qin Sang began to suspect whether Su Zinan truly had a way to locate the Unerring Palace ruins or was deliberately delaying.</p><p>During these days, the number of Nascent Soul cultivators of unknown origin within the observing crowds had clearly increased. Some concealed their auras deliberately, but they couldn't escape Qin Sang's spiritual sense.</p><p>Cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" here wasn't affected, so Qin Sang decided to continue observing Su Zinan.</p><p>Another half month passed.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the midst of cultivation when someone from the inn came to report that Su Zinan had left the island again.</p><p>Su Zinan’s every move was conspicuous, which saved Qin Sang the trouble of constant surveillance.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly concluded his cultivation, the Fire Lotus Seed disappearing into his forehead.</p><p>Without asking where Su Zinan had gone, Qin Sang walked out of the inn and looked up, seeing streaks of escaping light flying across the sky, all heading in the same direction.</p><p>He unhurriedly followed.</p><p>He quickly realized that this time was different. As soon as Su Zinan left the island, he flew southeast at maximum speed, his destination very clear.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he increased his speed, surpassing most of the cultivators.</p><p>Soon,</p><p>Everyone followed Su Zinan to a new area of the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang habitually landed on a deserted island, finding a spot with a good view to observe.</p><p>From afar, he saw Su Zinan and the others stop on the sea surface, forming a circle, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned,</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the other Nascent Soul cultivators each received a strangely shaped wooden stake from Su Zinan. They then dispersed in all directions, leaving only a Nether Moon Guard by Su Zinan's side.</p><p>The stakes were as thick as a thigh and only three feet long.  Dense grooves were carved on their surfaces, reflecting a demonic blood-red light under the sunlight, like the stakes’ blood vessels, with blood flowing continuously within.</p><p>Each person held a stake, encircling an area of about ten miles.  Su Zinan was at the center, floating above the sea surface, sitting cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>Su Zinan closed his eyes.</p><p>The others began to busy themselves.</p><p>From such a distance, Qin Sang couldn't tell what they were doing, but it seemed like they were setting up a formation.</p><p>A moment later, Su Zinan let out an unintelligible growl.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others immediately threw their stakes straight into the sea.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Water splashed everywhere.</p><p>The stakes pierced the sea surface, mostly submerged, with a portion remaining above the water, hovering motionless.</p><p>At the same time, Su Zinan raised his hands, swiftly completing a hand seal. He then pressed his palms downward, a streak of light shooting into the sea.</p><p>The light silently merged into the seawater.</p><p>Suddenly, the outer stakes underwent a transformation. The blood within the grooves flowed rapidly, emitting a rich blood-red light. The stakes resonated with each other, their blood-red lights attracting one another.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish…’</p><p>The blood-red lights formed lines, connecting all the stakes, creating a complex pattern on the sea surface.</p><p>Controlling this formation seemed to be a significant burden for Su Zinan, his face flushed, his upper body swaying slightly.</p><p>Just as outsiders thought something had gone wrong with Su Zinan, he suddenly faded and vanished.  An image of Su Zinan appeared simultaneously above each stake, then flashed into it.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>A loud shout accompanied the action.</p><p>The stakes plunged into the seabed at the same time. The seawater at the center of the formation turned completely blood-red, dazzlingly bright, as if a blood-colored gem was embedded in the sea.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The blood-red water churned, transforming into a thick beam of blood-red light, soaring into the sky!</p><p>Both Su Zinan's actions and this Bloodwood Formation were completely different from previous attempts.  Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that something would change today!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze followed the blood-red light upwards, and he was immediately met with an astonishing sight.</p><p>The blood-red light reached a height of a thousand zhang, then abruptly vanished. The Bloodwood Formation was still operating, the blood-red light continuing to flow like a pillar, yet only the lower portion was visible.</p><p>It was as if an invisible giant mouth in the void was devouring the blood-red light!</p><p>Exclamations of surprise erupted from the surrounding area.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at where the blood-red light disappeared, urging the Celestial Eye Butterfly to use its Celestial Eye power to its fullest extent.  Initially, he saw nothing; there was no imagined invisible barrier.</p><p>As the blood-red light grew more intense, a change finally occurred. A black dot faintly appeared within the blood-red light, then expanded at an alarming rate.</p><p>In an instant, the black dot became half the size of the blood-red light and continued to expand rapidly.</p><p>Even those without the Celestial Eye Butterfly noticed the change within the blood-red light.  An unknown force tore a large hole in the void, much like some kind of passage.</p><p>“He’s truly found it!”</p><p>“Is it definitely the Unerring Palace?  Was anyone present during the last time the ruins opened? Was it like this?”</p><p>“Elder Shen was there!  Eh?  Where is Elder Shen?”</p><p>…</p><p>The islands were filled with commotion.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the black hole with a grave expression.  The black hole was pitch black, and for some reason, it gave him a sense of unease. As the black hole expanded, this feeling intensified.</p><p>Suddenly, a grey aura flew out from the black hole.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A deafening roar echoed, silencing everyone in shock. They stared blankly upwards as the grey aura rushed out of the black hole, displaying an extremely violent power, slamming down fiercely.</p><p>A grey waterfall was born in the void.</p><p>Even from such a distance, everyone could feel the world-shattering momentum, their hearts pounding in fear.</p><p>The grey aura surged downwards.</p><p>Those within the Bloodwood Formation bore the brunt of it.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Streaks of escaping light fled the Bloodwood Formation. Su Zinan and the others were in a sorry state, looking back with expressions of lingering fear.</p><p>The grey aura was clearly a turbulent flow of extreme violence.</p><p>The Bloodwood Formation was torn to shreds. Now even the black hole was no longer visible.  An endless stream of grey aura surged out, its interior a chaotic mess of turbulent currents, spreading outwards at an alarming speed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood why it could flatten an entire island.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the scene of the Purple Firmament Palace ascending years ago.</p><p>There were also terrifying spatial turbulences within the spatial rifts. Even with the protection of the Ascension Platform, one needed the cultivation of late Nascent Soul to have a chance of self-preservation.</p><p>Of course, the two types of turbulence weren't the same.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense that there was chaotic restrictive power within the grey aura, most likely caused by the destruction of a spirit array or a secret realm.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators probably couldn't set up such a spirit array. It was at least at the level of an ancient immortal array. The profoundness of the Unerring Palace's foundation was beyond imagination.</p><p>After a long time,</p><p>The Unerring Palace had long since become history.  Recently, some ancient texts had been unearthed, but the relevant records were scarce and not necessarily credible.</p><p>According to research, the Unerring Palace at its peak was a super power spanning the continent and the East Sea, and it was very likely jointly ruled by humans and demons.</p><p>The coexistence of the two races within one power was unimaginable to present-day cultivators.</p><p>Now, humans and demons were separated, and the Unerring Palace was in ruins.  Fortunately, the Middle Continent was large enough, and the sea between the continent and the East Sea was vast and desolate enough.</p><p>The rumbling continued, deafening.</p><p>It only took a quarter of an hour for these turbulent flows to cover a vast area of the sea before the expansion slowed down, turning the area into a storm zone, blotting out the sky.</p><p>The surrounding sea areas were affected, with monstrous waves surging.</p><p>Qin Sang deployed his protective True Essence, resisting the gale, and shifted his gaze to Su Zinan and the others at the edge of the turbulence.</p><p>Su Zinan's face was somewhat pale.  Fortunately, he had escaped quickly and hadn't been directly impacted. He channeled his True Essence, his voice rising above the storm, “Which fellow Daoist is willing to help me enter the Unerring Palace? Su Mou’s previous offer still stands!”</p><p>Silence met his words.</p><p>After a moment, someone called out, “Fellow Daoist Su, are you planning to cross these turbulent flows and enter the deepest part?”</p><p>Su Zinan’s answer was unexpected, “Su Mou doesn’t know much about the Unerring Palace. Whether it lies within the depths of the turbulence, I’ll only know after entering.”</p><p>The crowd stirred at his words.</p><p>With the previous examples of the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery,</p><p>Logically, both sects had returned empty-handed. Anyone with self-awareness wouldn't risk accompanying Su Zinan, lest they repeat their mistakes.</p><p>However, Su Zinan had been able to locate the Unerring Palace so quickly, and the Bloodwood Formation was clearly unusual. He must know some unknown secrets.</p><p>Everyone was weighing the pros and cons; no one responded immediately.</p><p>Su Zinan shook his head, about to lead his group into the turbulence, when another voice called out, "Fellow Daoist Su, could you tell us why you are entering the Unerring Palace? Since you declared you're abandoning all treasures, you're not going there for treasure hunting, are you?"</p><p>Su Zinan was silent for a while before replying, “To find someone!”</p><p>To find someone!</p><p>These words caused an uproar.</p><p>There had already been rumors of Nascent Soul cultivators trapped within the Unerring Palace, first the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, and now Su Zinan.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Someone immediately asked.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced around, not finding the speaker, and coldly refused to answer, saying in a deep voice, “Su Mou will wait for ten more breaths!”</p><p>Nine breaths passed in a flash.</p><p>Until the very last breath, a streak of escaping light brightened from a distant island. An old man with white hair and beard flew to Su Zinan and nodded, “This old man will accompany Fellow Daoist Su on this journey!”</p><p>Su Zinan was overjoyed. He looked the old man over and exclaimed in surprise, “Could you be the Weeping Spirit Cave Master?”</p><p>The old man chuckled, “I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist Su to also know of my humble reputation. It’s an honor.”</p><p>“Cave Master is too modest.  The Weeping Spirit Cave Master of the Southern Continent, who doesn't know your name? It's Su Mou’s honor to finally meet you in person!”</p><p>Su Zinan was extremely enthusiastic.</p><p>Seeing no one else respond besides the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, Su Zinan didn’t hesitate and led his group into the turbulence.</p><p>As soon as they entered, streaks of escaping light flashed from the islands, flying closer to the turbulence.  After sensing the power of the turbulence, most cultivators flinched.</p><p>In such a place, even Golden Core cultivators would likely not be able to travel far. Not only would they not obtain treasures, but they would also lose their lives.</p><p>However, the commotion Su Zinan created was too great, and quite a few Nascent Soul cultivators were attracted, some alone, some in small groups.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the turbulence alone.</p><p>He didn’t choose to go with Su Zinan.</p><p>Back then, in order to deal with Wu Lao, he had used the Sword Formation, Demonic Fire, and the Sun God Tree. Wu Lao was aware of these. If he encountered danger inside, he wouldn’t be able to conceal himself.</p><p>He would then face the combined attack of three Grand Cultivators, which would not be worth it.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a vague feeling that Su Zinan’s purpose wasn’t so simple. If Old Devil Lu was trapped within the Unerring Palace, it contradicted Yue Fei's words.</p><p>It was still necessary to go in and see.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed into the turbulence.</p><p>It was relatively easy at the outermost layer. He could dodge to avoid the impact of the turbulence. However, the turbulence changed very quickly. Not far in, the turbulence became extremely dense, and he had to endure it head-on.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Ruyi Pearl, stimulating a protective罡罩.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly observed the surroundings for him.</p><p>He could see traces of other cultivators on both sides.</p><p>Their direction was the same as Qin Sang's, all wanting to follow Su Zinan.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the others, having the Celestial Eye Butterfly fully utilize its Celestial Eye to lock onto Su Zinan’s direction from afar.</p><p>After traveling like this for a short distance,</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure suddenly paused.</p><p>There was clearly nothing around him, but at this moment, he inexplicably felt something different, as if he had entered a different space.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Several turbulent currents suddenly struck simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly as he was hit by several chaotic forces at once.  Rumbling sounds echoed continuously, the protective罡罩 vibrating and flickering unsteadily.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly increased his True Essence, stabilizing the罡罩.</p><p>“Hiss…  The power of the turbulence is already this strong before even going deeper! Nascent Soul initial stage cultivators, without a sufficiently strong protective divine ability, can only stop here.”</p><p>Qin Sang braced himself and continued forward, noticing that the cultivator on the left indeed hadn't been able to keep up.</p><p>Moving further forward became increasingly difficult, with more and more people falling behind.</p><p>They could only stay nearby to search, hoping to find something.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew increasingly grave. He had inquired about the scene during the last opening of the ruins in the Chinan Island Chain. Although the power of the turbulence at the outermost layer was also very strong, it wasn't to this extent.</p>
