Chapter 659: Captured Alive


Seeing the bone claw reaching for the Ebony Sword, its glow seeming peculiar, Qin Sang quickly made a decision. With a swift incantation, the Ebony Sword shimmered, suddenly transforming into two identical blades of light.


Both blades of light appeared real, indistinguishable from each other, making it impossible to tell which was the true sword and which was the illusion.


“Sword Splitting!”


Du Han's scalp tingled.


He never expected to witness two coveted sword cultivator techniques performed by the same person, especially someone who had recently formed their core.


The two sword lights flew side by side, evading the bone claw.


Even with his keen eyesight, he couldn't discern which was real and which was fake.


Unable to hesitate any longer, Du Han gambled, directing the bone claw towards one of the sword lights. Simultaneously, he swiftly patted his storage pouch, retrieving a circular mirror.


The mirror, made of an unknown material, was entirely black. Both the mirror surface and its frame shimmered with an obsidian-like sheen, appearing as a single piece.


This was the Blackwater Mirror, a magical treasure awarded to Du Han by the Li Wu Palace after he formed his core.


Originally, the Blackwater Mirror was a high-grade low-rank magical treasure. Later, he stumbled upon a piece of exceptional ore and had it refined into the mirror. Although it didn't elevate it to a mid-rank treasure, its power was among the top tier of low-rank magical treasures.


‘Crack!’


The bone claw successfully grasped one of the sword lights.


However, that sword light struggled briefly before shattering, revealing itself as the illusory copy.


The other was the true spirit sword.


‘Whoosh!’


The Ebony Sword was now inches from Du Han.


The bone claw couldn't return in time. Fortunately, Du Han had anticipated this, ignoring the bone claw and hastily activating the Blackwater Mirror, placing it in front of the Ebony Sword.


Black currents seemed to flow across the mirror's surface, undulating before transforming into a black whip that lashed out, attempting to ensnare the Ebony Sword.


Just then, Du Han cried out in alarm, stomping his foot and flashing away.


In the next instant, a black spectral claw pierced through his chest.


Behind Du Han, the Nightfiend, seizing the opportunity amidst the chaos, had finally found its chance to strike.


Qin Sang had instructed the Nightfiend to remain hidden, initially intending for it to assassinate Du Han's natal insect-gu. After discovering that Du Han didn't possess one, he changed the plan to a direct attack on Du Han himself.


The attack appeared successful.


However, the Nightfiend's hand was devoid of blood. Moreover, Du Han's body gradually became translucent, ultimately revealing a small figure woven from an unknown type of straw.


The figure, only palm-sized, bore Du Han's exact features, lifelike in its detail.


At this moment, a pained expression contorted the figure's face before it crumbled into dust.


Du Han's figure then materialized a short distance away, his chest heaving, yet completely unharmed. He appeared startled, clearly frightened by the Nightfiend's surprise attack, his body drenched in cold sweat.


“Some sort of substitute puppet technique?”


Qin Sang's pupils constricted, realizing just how difficult this opponent was.  His various strange methods allowed him to escape seemingly fatal situations.


However, despite the failed attack, Qin Sang remained unfazed, gently tapping the Ebony Sword.


The sword's surface swiftly turned crimson, followed by a streak of blood that slammed into the Blackwater Mirror.


Qin Sang had reserved the Blood Defilement Divine Light for the Blackwater Mirror.


Although the bone claw was Du Han's natal magic treasure, its quality was inferior to the Blackwater Mirror.  Qin Sang considered the mirror Du Han's greatest threat.


He had waited for this moment to disable it.


Without the Blackwater Mirror, Du Han would lose his greatest advantage. No matter how high his cultivation, he wouldn't escape Qin Sang's grasp.


Du Han, his mind unsettled, could only watch helplessly as the Blackwater Mirror was engulfed by the eerie blood light. He instantly felt the connection between him and the mirror weaken.


The mirror's spiritual light dimmed considerably, its power greatly diminished, and it wobbled precariously in the air.


Du Han was horrified. As he hurriedly tried to recall the Blackwater Mirror for inspection, he caught sight of a bloody figure in the corner of his eye. The Nightfiend, after its initial attack missed, had swiftly killed Du Han's disciple, hurling the corpse at Du Han before closing in again.


Knowing the Nightfiend's terrifying power, Du Han was forced to abandon the Blackwater Mirror, recalling his bone claw to defend against the Nightfiend.


Having lost both his precious substitute straw puppet and the Blackwater Mirror, Du Han's will to fight evaporated. He no longer harbored any thoughts of killing Qin Sang, focusing solely on escape.


The array of treasures Qin Sang displayed made Du Han feel as though he was facing an ancient monster. Even renowned cultivators who had formed their core for many years rarely possessed so many terrifying methods.


Was this truly someone who had recently formed their core?


No wonder he didn't have a natal insect-gu; he clearly had natal magic treasures!


Du Han was filled with regret, desperately seeking an escape route while cursing his disciples for their foolishness.


However, having planned for so long, how could Qin Sang allow him to escape?


After disabling the Blackwater Mirror, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately recalling the Ebony Sword. With a flick of his wrist, three small banners spun out from his palm, unfurling in mid-air.


The Ten Yama Banners expanded to several meters in height, causing the surrounding temperature to plummet. Despite the bright midday sun, a chilling aura pervaded the area.


Qin Sang fully activated the Ten Yama Formation. Since forming his core, he had continuously practiced both the Sword Splitting technique and familiarized himself with the Ten Yama Banners. The Sword Splitting technique had shown some progress, at least enough to deceive opponents.


The Ten Yama Formation, however, still required some preparation.


“What kind of evil artifact is this?”


The appearance of the Ten Yama Banners once again shattered Du Han's understanding.


Skilled in formations, he immediately recognized that it consisted of three magical treasures forming a powerful array.


Du Han's fear intensified. Sensing impending doom, he used every means at his disposal to try and break free from the Nightfiend, even considering sacrificing his natal magic treasure.


Talismans and spells flew everywhere.


The Nightfiend, with its thick hide and tough flesh, ignored everything, relentlessly pursuing Du Han.  Its durable body allowed it to withstand the bone claw's attacks, buying Qin Sang time to prepare the banner formation.


Meanwhile, Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly, finally completing the formation!


‘Whoosh… ’


A fierce wind erupted.


In an instant, a chilling wind filled the air, plunging the surroundings into darkness.


The surfaces of the three ghostly banners seemed to contain black holes, from which an icy black flame surged, converging in the center to form a deeper, darker mass.


“Go!”


Qin Sang pointed at Du Han, his eyes cold.


He had saved the Ten Yama Banners for last to ensure he could capture Du Han alive!


The Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fire dragon, lunging at Du Han. Du Han frantically manipulated his bone claw, struggling to defend against both the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and the relentless Nightfiend.


Finally, a cracking sound echoed as the bone claw shattered, consumed by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.


Despair engulfed Du Han.


Qin Sang didn't even give him the chance to end his own life.


Overwhelmed by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, Du Han's consciousness faded. When he awoke, he found himself held by the neck.
