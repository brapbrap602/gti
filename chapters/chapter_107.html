<h1>Chapter 100: Asking Moon Market (Seeking Subscription!)</h1><p>The Eight Righteous Sects refer to the eight major sects of Pure Yang Sect, Great Elixir Sect, Wuji Sect, Beast Control Sect, Mount Shaohua, Shangyuan Serenity Palace, Void Spirit Sect, and Yuan Mirage Sect. Each boasts Nascent Soul ancestors, signifying their formidable strength and earning them the collective title of the Eight Sects.</p><p>Within the Small Cold Region, the composition of these Eight Righteous Sects is not static. If a sect's Nascent Soul ancestor passes away without a successor, leading to the sect's decline, as exemplified by the Yuan Zhao Sect, its position will be replaced by another sect.</p><p>Most cultivation families within the Small Cold Region are affiliated with these sects.</p><p>Yu Lian spoke eloquently, though the information he shared was similar to what Qin Sang had learned at the Gloom Yin Sect.</p><p>By the time Yu Lian had finished speaking, dusk was approaching. Everyone dispersed contentedly, bidding each other farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang then revealed his desire for a map of the Small Cold Region's cultivation world.  The inclusion of mortal kingdoms was unimportant, but the locations of the major sects needed to be clearly marked.</p><p>“Senior Yu, could you advise me where I might acquire such a map nearby?  I’ve been traveling for many years, wandering aimlessly. I wish to visit the various cultivation sects, but without a map, finding them has been quite challenging.”</p><p>Yu Lian didn't believe Qin Sang's talk about visiting sacred grounds, suspecting he was another seeker of immortality. This was a common occurrence.  Yu Lian smiled and said, “You needn’t go elsewhere for a map of the Small Cold Region. My family has one. If you can wait a few days, I can bring one for you at the next Phoenix Peak gathering.”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. “Thank you, Senior.  Are there any requirements from your family? I have some spirit stones, or I could trade with a magical tool…”</p><p>Zhao Yan, perhaps fearing that carrying too many treasures would expose his identity, hadn't left much in his storage pouch, but what he did have was valuable.</p><p>There were three mid-grade spirit stones and over a hundred low-grade ones.  Not to mention the mysterious orchid and the black pearl. There were also two quite useful magical tools.</p><p>One was a high-grade magical tool called the Sky Shuttle, capable of flight. Its speed wasn't as fast as the Voidwind, but it could fly much higher and automatically generate a protective shield against the cold wind, allowing flight above the clouds. However, this would be conspicuous to other cultivators, so Qin Sang rarely used it.</p><p>The other tool, a teardrop-shaped artifact called the Sky Star Tear, was a top-grade magical tool left behind after Zhao Yan’s body was cremated. Once refined, it could be absorbed into the body, and with a mere thought, it would generate a protective aura.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a bit apprehensive. If he hadn’t ambushed Zhao Yan while his spiritual power was depleted, the Ebony Sword might not have killed him with a single blow.</p><p>There were also a few spirit pills and a dozen talismans of various functions, all carefully stored away by Qin Sang.</p><p>He could certainly afford a map.</p><p>Yu Lian waved his hand dismissively. “Young Lady Li is my junior.  You helped her without asking for anything in return, curing Fourth Brother's illness. How could I take your spirit stones? Consider this map a gift from Young Lady Li, through me.”</p><p>“Then I’ll gratefully accept.”</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang received the map, bid farewell to Li Youniang and Yu Lian, activated the Sky Shuttle, soared into the clouds, and headed south. Cloudmist Great Marsh lay in that direction.</p><p>Mount Shaohua's entrance was located at the edge of Cloudmist Great Marsh, at the southernmost tip of the Small Cold Region.</p><p>Nine Peaks Mountain was peaceful and safe, but the path of cultivation there was bleak.  The rogue cultivators there didn't even dare to dream of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Some resented their fate, some lived ordinary lives like Li Youniang, and some abandoned their cultivation aspirations altogether, indulging in fleeting pleasures.</p><p>Qin Sang never gave up. He would strive.</p><p>He was going to Mount Shaohua to try his luck, to see if the Song family ancestor's sword intent decree was still there.</p><p>He was uncertain about his chances. Song Hua was a cultivator, but his sister, Song Ying, had no spiritual roots, a mere mortal.</p><p>He had been in this world for eleven years.</p><p>Eleven years was a blink of an eye for a cultivator, but for a mortal, it was a decade of change and the passage of seasons.</p><p>Song Hua had died by the Sinking Water River, and eleven years had passed.</p><p>Song Ying was only a ten-year-old girl at the time. How could she have survived alone in a cultivation market for eleven years? Could she have held onto their family business?</p><p>Or worse, she might be dead.</p><p>But Qin Sang still decided to make the trip. Joining Mount Shaohua would be ideal, but if not, settling in a market near the mountain would make it easier to find Yin Sha Qi and interact with higher-level cultivators.</p><p>The Soul Pills he stored in the Gloom Yin Sect could only sustain him to the ninth level. He couldn't return to the Gloom Yin Sect, but it wasn't the only place with Yin Sha Qi.</p><p>With Yin Sha Qi, he wouldn't have to worry about cultivation. As for Foundation Establishment Pills, he could figure that out later.</p><p>…</p><p>Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Asking Moon Market.</p><p>Qin Sang stood outside the market, filled with emotion. This was the third cultivation market he had found.</p><p>It has been two years since he left Nine Summits Mountain. A month ago, he arrived at the edge of the Boundless Azure Marsh, awestruck by its immensity, and finally located the entrance to Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Lesser Hua Mountain stands at the marsh's edge.  Dozens of sword-like peaks rise within its gates, exuding a sharp, blade-honed aura.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated as he traveled, and his cultivation had reached the late eighth stage. He was stuck at the bottleneck to the ninth stage, unable to break through no matter how anxious he became.</p><p>However, his Soul Pills were running low, so he needed to prepare.</p><p>There were four renowned cultivator markets near Lesser Hua Mountain, all quite large. Qin Sang searched them one by one, starting with the nearest, but hadn't found the Song family.  Moonquery Market was the third.</p><p>He was familiar with the rules of these markets. Cultivators could stay long-term for a small spirit stone fee and even purchase property.  Ordinary houses meant for mortals were affordable even for cultivators, and with Lesser Hua Mountain's backing, safety and credibility were assured.</p><p>However, residences within the market with rich spiritual energy, ideal for cultivation, were exorbitantly expensive.  Even with Qin Sang's considerable wealth, buying one would nearly bankrupt him.</p><p>Qin Sang blended into the crowd discreetly and began his inquiries, following his usual method.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang emerged from a shop, a hint of joy on his face. He had finally found a lead on what might be Song Hua's residence.</p><p>Lesser Hua Mountain had rules: within the market, cultivators were strictly forbidden from showing off their powers or bullying mortals.  Though impatient, Qin Sang could only walk slowly through the crowd, making his way from the entrance of Moonquery Market to its innermost area.</p><p>Compared to the noisy outer area, this part of the market was quiet and serene.  Large estates, each brimming with spiritual energy, lined the streets, clearly the homes of cultivators or their descendants. Even the shops here were hushed.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped before a large mansion. Seeing the plaque that read "Li Residence," he frowned.</p><p>Turning his head, he noticed what appeared to be a refining smithy across the street. An idea struck him, and he walked towards it.</p>
