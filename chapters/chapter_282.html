<h1>    herbs that can mend foundations, might still have other good things. It's worth a look.</p><p>Qin Sang's horde of</h1><p>    Devil Corpses was completely destroyed, leaving only a few zombies.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang</p><p>    decided to focus on nurturing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, hoping to restore it before his</p><p>    departure.</p><p>Firstly, the corpses of Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't easy to come by. His previous</p><p>    attempts at "fishing" for them had only been successful once in a long while. Secondly, from a survival perspective,</p><p>    the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman was far more valuable than the Devil Corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't yet</p><p>    determine the talisman's true power, but he guessed that after its restoration, activating it would allow him to</p><p>    move at speeds comparable to a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>In many dangerous situations,</p><p>    this would give him the ability to react calmly.</p><p>Holding the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang</p><p>    communicated with the Flood Dragon spirit within. He learned that its soul had been severely injured by the golden</p><p>    bell and further weakened by resisting the lava. It would take considerable time to recover.</p><p>The talisman's</p><p>    restoration would also accelerate the spirit's recovery.</p><p>Now that the Flood Dragon spirit had submitted to Qin</p><p>    Sang, he didn't fear any backlash after its full recovery. Furthermore, the spirit wasn't a true Flood Dragon, but</p><p>    more akin to a tool spirit. Its primary function was to activate the talisman's speed and it lacked the power to</p><p>    assist in combat.</p><p>Having gained a deeper understanding of the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman through</p><p>    communication with its spirit, Qin Sang returned it to his dantian and channeled his spiritual power to envelop</p><p>    it.</p><p>As strands of spiritual energy flowed into the talisman, it radiated a brilliant light. The faint roar of</p><p>    a Flood Dragon echoed as the two halves of the talisman drew together, the gap between them shimmering with a milky</p><p>    white light.</p><p>Clearly sensing the accelerated recovery of the talisman, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. He</p><p>    paused and shifted his attention to the bone fragment.</p><p>Mastering the *Void Imprint* and the *Soul Snatching</p><p>    Curse* was essential. In addition, the *Demonic Sounds of the Heavens* contained several useful spells which Qin</p><p>    Sang intended to cultivate as well.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his divine sense into the bone fragment, his eyes closed</p><p>    tightly, and the cave fell silent.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, divine light</p><p>    flashing within. He shouted in a low voice, "Condense!"</p><p>Before him, an illusory square seal materialized. The</p><p>    seal bore no inscription but was covered in mystical runes. Following Qin Sang's thoughts, the seal shrank</p><p>    dramatically and flew into the center of his forehead.</p><p>Within his soul space, the jade Buddha emitted a yellow</p><p>    light, and the Heart-Devouring Insect lay dormant just outside its glow.</p><p>The Void Imprint arrived and</p><p>    precisely enveloped the insect, sealing it. The insect's aura was suppressed to a minimum.</p><p>This persistent</p><p>    worry could finally be partially resolved.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a great weight lift from his chest, his body feeling</p><p>    lighter. A smile appeared on his face as he diligently mastered the *Soul Snatching Curse* and other spells. He then</p><p>    continued to nurture the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman while awaiting Yun Youzi's arrival.</p><p>Time</p><p>    passed quickly in cultivation, and a year soon went by.</p><p>The cave's restrictions were suddenly triggered.</p></p><p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state. The talisman rotated slowly within his qi sea, the crack down its middle</p><p>    now a barely perceptible line. The Flood Dragon spirit had also recovered significantly, no longer as weak as</p><p>    before.</p><p>The talisman could now be used, albeit cautiously, offering speeds comparable to a mid-stage</p><p>    Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, it was still fragile and required careful handling.</p><p>Lost</p><p>    in thought, Qin Sang opened his eyes and swept his divine sense outwards. He was surprised to discover that the</p><p>    person outside his cave wasn't Yun Youzi, but Yu Daiyue.</p><p>What was he doing here?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled</p><p>    but couldn't turn him away. He deactivated the cave's restrictions, rose, and went to greet him.</p><p>"Senior</p><p>    Brother Yu, what brings you to my humble cave? Please, come in."</p><p>Qin Sang put on a welcoming smile and ushered</p><p>    Yu Daiyue inside.</p><p>"Knowing that Junior Brother Qin was in secluded cultivation, I hesitated for a long time</p><p>    before deciding to disturb you. I was afraid of interrupting your training," Yu Daiyue said with a bow as he</p><p>    entered.</p><p>"An honored guest graces my home, brightening my humble abode. I'm overjoyed!"</p><p>With a wave of</p><p>    his hand, Qin Sang conjured an ice chair and offered tea. Gesturing towards the seat, he said, "Senior Brother Yu,</p><p>    please be seated. My cave is simple, please forgive its lack of amenities."</p><p>Yu Daiyue glanced around the cave,</p><p>    which contained only an ice bed, and shook his head, sighing, "Junior Brother Qin is not one for worldly pleasures,</p><p>    undisturbed by external distractions. This is the true mindset of a cultivator. No wonder your cultivation has</p><p>    progressed so rapidly, surpassing even mine."</p><p>Hearing Yu Daiyue's words, Qin Sang felt a pang of</p><p>    helplessness.</p><p>Ever since their encounter in the Trial Space, Yu Daiyue had been convinced of Qin Sang's rapid</p><p>    increase in strength. No matter how Qin Sang explained, Yu Daiyue remained skeptical, so Qin Sang simply stopped</p><p>    trying.</p><p>After Yu Daiyue sat down, he got straight to the point: "Junior Brother Qin, to avoid disrupting your</p><p>    cultivation, I'll be frank. Do you still need spirit wood for your natal spirit sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart</p><p>    stirred. Back at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's base, Yu Daiyue had mentioned keeping an eye out for spirit wood for</p><p>    him. He hadn't expected Yu Daiyue to remember.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Yu, for your concern. My natal</p><p>    spirit sword is quite the glutton. Spirit wood is always welcome. If Senior Brother Yu has any high-quality spirit</p><p>    wood, I'm willing to pay handsomely for it. I certainly won't disappoint you."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly confident</p><p>    that the over ten thousand spirit stones he possessed were enough to exchange for most spirit wood. As for even</p><p>    better spirit wood, he figured Yu Daiyue wouldn't be willing to part with it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Daiyue shook</p><p>    his head. "Junior Brother Qin, you misunderstand. I don't have any spirit wood on hand. However, I know there's a</p><p>    Earthfire Pantong tree within the ancient cultivator's ruins. That's why I wanted to invite you to return to the</p><p>    ruins."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's surprise, Yu Daiyue explained, "Junior Brother Qin, you've been diligently</p><p>    cultivating, so you may not knowâ€¦"</p><p>It turned out that after they left, Che Yutao and the others had invited</p><p>    several more Foundation Establishment cultivators to help clear the ancient ruins. Among them was the Du cultivator</p><p>    they had met at the Upper Primordial Pure Palace via the ancient teleportation formation. He had come personally</p><p>    from the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang only now realized that this person was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, just one</p><p>    step away from Nascent Soul. No wonder Che Yutao was so respectful towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang ventured to ask, "Did</p><p>    Senior Uncle Che and the others manage to rescue Elder Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Yu Daiyue</p><p>    didn't know the details, only that the ancient ruins had stabilized, and most of the fire spirit beasts had been</p><p>    eliminated. The remaining ones posed no significant threat.</p><p>Of course, for Foundation Establishment</p><p>    cultivators, these fire spirit beasts were still quite dangerous. But as long as a few people entered together and</p><p>    remained cautious, they could manage.</p><p>It was said that some of the restrictions on the mountain peaks had been</p><p>    weakened by the upheaval and weren't as strong as before, increasing the chances of breaking them. Many people, like</p><p>    Yu Daiyue, were gathering companions and entering the ancient ruins to search for treasures.</p><p>"I discovered the</p><p>    Earthfire Pantong tree earlier," Yu Daiyue said, "but I lacked the strength to break the restriction on my own. Then</p><p>    the upheaval in the ruins occurred, and the matter was put on hold until now."</p></p>
