<h1>Chapter 358 Longevity</h1><p>“Sir, are you here for incense or treatment…?”</p><p>A young Taoist, only twelve or thirteen years old, likely an apprentice or assistant, helped a woman stabilize her broken leg and hurried forward. Looking up at Qin Sang's face, he suddenly froze as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>His eyes widened, his face full of astonishment.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. "Young Taoist, do you know me?"</p><p>"Master… Master…"</p><p>The young Taoist suddenly turned his head and shouted urgently toward a slightly older Taoist.</p><p>This shout attracted the attention of everyone in the Hall of Green Rams.</p><p>Everyone looked at Qin Sang with suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang spread his hands innocently, indicating he was blameless and hadn't bullied the child.</p><p>"What's all the commotion? Have you forgotten the *Qingjing Jing* already?" The older Taoist, who was taking an elderly man's pulse, looked over disapprovingly and scolded.</p><p>"Master… He… He is…"</p><p>The young Taoist pointed at Qin Sang, his face flushed with anxiety, unable to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>The older Taoist frowned slightly, following the young Taoist's finger to look at Qin Sang. Then, his expression suddenly changed, a look of uncertainty appearing on his face.</p><p>"Old sir, please wait a moment…"</p><p>The older Taoist hesitated, then rose and walked quickly to Qin Sang. He cupped his hands in greeting and asked tentatively, "I am Li Yufu. May I ask your honorable surname?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin…"</p><p>Seeing their reactions, Qin Sang guessed something and didn't bother concealing it any longer. He asked, "What is your relationship with Mingyue?"</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's question, Li Yufu's face was filled with shock, his voice laced with disbelief. "Master Mingyue was my late teacher. Could you be… Senior Uncle Qin?"</p><p>"Late teacher?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, his voice a little dry. "Mingyue, he has…"</p><p>Li Yufu nodded solemnly.</p><p>"Huh…"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, noticing that all the patients in the hall were staring at them curiously, likely wondering why the master of the Green Ram Temple had such a young senior uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said to Li Yufu, "Please continue your work. We can talk later."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Li Yufu obeyed Qin Sang without hesitation and returned to diagnosing patients, but he was clearly distracted. Suddenly remembering something, he asked Qin Sang, "Senior Uncle Qin, there will be more and more people seeking treatment later, and it might take several hours to finish.  Would you like Jingtian to take you to the back hall to rest?"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and followed the young Taoist into the back hall of the Green Ram Temple. Seeing the young Taoist's nervousness in his presence, he asked, "Your name is Jingtian?"</p><p>The young Taoist nodded, replying tensely, "Yes, Ancestral Uncle. Master found me during midsummer's eve, when the fireflies were dancing everywhere. So he gave me the Taoist name Jingtian."</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an "Oh," and asked, "Where are Master Jixin and Mingyue's memorial tablets enshrined?"</p><p>"In the Ancestral Hall…"</p><p>The so-called Ancestral Hall was actually very simple, containing only three memorial tablets.</p><p>Yun Youzi, Jixin, and Mingyue.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple lineage began with Yun Youzi, a self-taught wandering Taoist with no known master. Thus, there were only a few members, making it seem very modest.</p><p>Qin Sang sent Jingtian back to help out in the front, took down Yun Youzi's memorial tablet, picked up the incense sticks beside it, lit one for each of Jixin and Mingyue, and bowed in respect.</p><p>"You're all gone…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly, his voice barely audible.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the cushion, lost in thought. Memories of the past flooded his mind. The time he spent at the Green Ram Temple after arriving in this world was the poorest, yet also the happiest period of his life.</p><p>Carefree and unrestrained.</p><p>Of the three "Taoists" of the Green Ram Temple, only he remained.</p><p>Master Jixin was a mortal. If he were still alive, he would have been over a hundred years old. Qin Sang was prepared for this, but he didn't expect Mingyue to pass away so suddenly.</p><p>Beside the three memorial tablets was a wooden box. Inside, Qin Sang found a portrait of himself, signed by Mingyue.</p><p>Unfolding the portrait, Qin Sang smiled knowingly.</p><p>In the portrait, his Taoist robe was wrinkled and covered in dust. He held a stone in his hand, his gaze fixed intently on a flock of birds in the sky, his hand poised as if ready to strike down a bird for a meal at any moment.</p><p>The portrait was incredibly lifelike, no wonder Li Yufu and his apprentice recognized him at a glance.</p><p>…</p><p>The sun gradually moved to its zenith.</p><p>Jingtian was about to prepare lunch and came in to ask Qin Sang what he would like to eat.</p><p>"Make a bowl of mixed congee," Qin Sang said.</p><p>…</p><p>It wasn't until evening that Li Yufu finished seeing all the patients and hurried over.  "I have been remiss in my duties, please forgive me, Senior Uncle Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him with a faint smile. "Who told you to call me Senior Uncle?"</p><p>Li Yufu didn't expect Qin Sang to ask this.  He stammered, "It was Master's instruction."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a smile. Back then, he hadn't formally taken Jixin as his master.  Jixin, perhaps realizing his heart wasn't fully committed, never mentioned taking him as a disciple.</p><p>The whole “senior brother” thing was just a way to tease Mingyue and gain an advantage.</p><p>He didn't expect him to remember it all this time.</p><p>"Since I am your Senior Uncle, why isn't my memorial tablet placed here?" Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>Li Yufu quickly replied, "Master said that you went to cultivate immortality and would surely attain immortality and eternal life, so he told me to keep you in my heart…"</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgment.</p><p>It seemed that his faked death that night hadn't fooled Jixin.</p><p>Thinking of this, he recounted his whereabouts from that time, asking, "...Later, I came to Mount Cuiming and learned that Master Jixin and Mingyue had left. I sent my subordinates to various countries to search for them, but to no avail.  Where were they all this time? When did they return?"</p><p>Li Yufu explained.</p><p>"After leaving Mount Cuiming, Grandmaster and Master traveled south along the Jiangnan River, visiting various countries, healing the sick and saving lives along the way. Finally, they settled in the Chen Kingdom, at the end of the Wuling River.</p><p>“At that time, a plague was rampant in the Chen Kingdom.  They disregarded their own safety, administered medicine and treated the sick, even contracting the plague themselves to find the right cure, saving countless lives.</p><p>“The local people, grateful for Grandmaster and Master’s kindness, erected a shrine for them, which is still receiving offerings of incense to this day.</p><p>“I am also from the Chen Kingdom.  I lost my parents when I was still an infant and was taken in by Master.</p><p>“When Master grew old and longed for his homeland, he brought me back to Mount Cuiming to revive the Green Ram Temple…"</p><p>Li Yufu spoke娓娓道来, and Qin Sang listened intently.</p><p>No wonder he hadn't been able to find Jixin and Mingyue.  They had traveled so far, all the way to the Chen Kingdom at the end of the Wuling River.</p><p>Li Yufu's voice was filled with pride when he spoke of the shrine.</p><p>Qin Sang sincerely admired Jixin and Mingyue's kindness and perseverance.  They had never forgotten their original aspiration, and the shrine was what they deserved.</p><p>He couldn't help but think that as long as the sacrifices and incense offerings continued, Master Jixin and Mingyue would gradually become deities in the hearts of the local people, forever remembered.</p><p>Was this also a form of longevity?</p>
