<h1>Chapter 711: Chain Reaction</h1><p>Chapter 711: Chain Reaction</p><p>“A strict hierarchy, truly deserving of the name! If all the Huo Que in the entire nest could cooperate like this, guided by their Yuan Dan-stage leader, the combined power of hundreds of Huo Que's ice wind abilities would be terrifying,”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Obtaining the Wan Shi Chang from the Huo Que nest would not be easy.</p><p>Watching the Huo Que fly further and further away, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, suppressed his thoughts, and hurriedly used his movement technique to pursue them.</p><p>The Huo Que were not large, but had immense endurance. Carrying sea beast flesh many times their own weight, they flew for a full hour without stopping.</p><p>Following them for another four or five hours, Qin Sang finally saw a towering mountain shadow appear on the sea ahead.</p><p>From afar, a patch of white caught his eye.</p><p>“A snow mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Snow mountains were rare in this area, but considering the Huo Que's abilities and the nature of the Wan Shi Chang, its existence on a snow mountain made perfect sense.</p><p>The Huo Que flew higher and higher, finally disappearing at the top of the snow mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped far away and discovered that the top of the snow mountain was similar to a volcanic crater, its bottom unfathomably deep.  The Huo Que nest was clearly inside the mountain.</p><p>Having witnessed the Huo Que hunting together, Qin Sang decided against rashly entering the nest. He would first find a nearby place to observe their habits and determine the size of their population before making a decision.</p><p>The size of a Huo Que population was usually related to the strength of their leader. If there were hundreds of thousands of Huo Que, their leader might be a peak Yuan Dan-stage demon beast.</p><p>But Qin Sang thought the entrance to the snow mountain didn't seem very large; there shouldn't be that many.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang circled the snow mountain several times, selecting an inconspicuous small island in the distance to create a cave dwelling, setting up several concealment restrictions and spirit arrays.</p><p>After finishing this, he went out again and finally discovered another group of Huo Que hunting.</p><p>This time, he didn't hide, but directly attacked, killing all the Huo Que. To experience the power of their ice wind ability, he patiently engaged them before making the killing blow.</p><p>“The power is indeed formidable. The combined ice wind of this group of Huo Que can exert several times the strength of their leader. But the ice wind fusion takes time and requires preparation—this might be a breakthrough. However, the leader is a Yuan Dan-stage demon beast and might possess even stronger abilities… The good news is that the Nine Nether Demon Fire does have a strong counter effect against the Huo Que. Unleashing the Nine Nether Demon Fire, even if the Huo Que leader is mid-Yuan Dan stage, there's a good chance of killing it, provided I can lure it out of the nest and away from its group.”</p><p>Qin Sang collected the corpses, then hid underwater near the surface for a while before leaving.</p><p>“The other Huo Que didn't immediately search for them. It seems their group lacks the ability to sense the death of their members…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, a plan gradually forming in his mind.</p><p>Then, he returned to his temporary cave dwelling, cultivating and observing the snow mountain's activity. After about twenty days, he had gathered considerable information.</p><p>The weakest members of the group almost never left the nest; their purpose was likely solely for reproduction.  Every so often, a Yao Ling-stage leader would take turns leading small hunting parties, bringing back food to the nest.</p><p>The food was of two types: sometimes sea beasts, sometimes ordinary sea fish.</p><p>“Judging from their hunting frequency, there must be over ten thousand Huo Que. Their leader really is patient; I haven't seen it come out once…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, deciding to proceed with his plan.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang ambushed and killed a small group of Huo Que south of the snow mountain. The next day, he repeated the tactic, killing another group to the west.</p><p>He planned to use this method to lure the leader out of the nest.</p><p>Then, on the following night, the unexpected happened.</p><p>Qin Sang had arrived early at a deserted island north of the snow mountain, knowing that a group of Huo Que had just left the nest and were heading in this direction.</p><p>He hadn't killed enough yet; the Huo Que hadn't noticed anything unusual.</p><p>However, shortly after Qin Sang arrived at the island…</p><p>The moon hung high in the sky, a beautiful night.</p><p>Qin Sang was sitting cross-legged on the grass, meditating, when he suddenly felt an unprecedentedly terrifying aura sweep past from the far north, instantly jolting him out of his meditative state.</p><p>Qin Sang sprang to his feet, his eyes widening, staring fixedly at the northern night sky.</p><p>The next moment, a fiery red light streaked across the heavens like a meteor, heading west.</p><p>The red glow was too distant to see clearly.  </p><p>But even from afar, its aura sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine, leaving him panicked and terrified.</p><p>"A Transformed-Form Demon Beast!"</p><p>Qin Sang gasped in shock.  Such a terrifying aura was unmatched even by the human-faced porpoise near the Cold Flame; only a Transformed-Form Demon Beast or a Yuan Ying cultivator possessed such power.</p><p>Combined with the demonic energy erupting in the north, only one conclusion was possible!</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered Transformed-Form Demon Beasts in Xiaohan Domain, but those beasts had agreements with humans, and wouldn't casually kill.  They weren't this terrifying.</p><p>The Demon Sea was different.  The demon and cultivator races were sworn enemies.  If a cultivator was spotted, the demons wouldn't hesitate to kill them.</p><p>"A Transformed-Form Demon Beast near Huntian Island? Why is it appearing now?"</p><p>Horrified, Qin Sang rapidly considered his options, his body already moving. He fled the deserted island without hesitation, heading directly south.</p><p>"Judging by its flight path, that Transformed-Form Demon Beast seems to be heading straight for the Thousand Demons Sea.  Could it have been drawn by the Cold Flame...?"</p><p>A possibility struck Qin Sang, and the more he considered it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p>Cultivators could only establish themselves on an island with an understanding with the nearby Transformed-Form Demon Beasts. They generally wouldn't trespass, unless something extremely attractive appeared.</p><p>Only a treasure of the Cold Flame's caliber could lure a Transformed-Form Demon Beast.</p><p>"Even a Transformed-Form Demon Beast is tempted.  The Cold Flame can't be hidden..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed wryly, staring at the northern night sky. As the red light drifted further away, he felt a sense of relief.  The beast was heading straight for the Cold Flame, at least temporarily leaving him undisturbed to retrieve the Wan Shi Zhang.</p><p>However, after obtaining the Wan Shi Zhang, he would need to escape far away.  Returning the same way was impossible; he would have to continue south.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang's face changed drastically.</p><p>Just as the red light was about to disappear into the western night sky, several incredibly powerful auras emerged from the distant east.  Their speed was astonishing, seemingly following the red light.</p><p>Without exception, they were all Core Formation Demon Beasts.</p><p>One of them was directly east of him, heading straight towards his location.</p>
