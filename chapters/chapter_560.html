Chapter 553: Predicament


Qin Sang and the other four were equally shocked.
The Violet Palace was a distant and dangerous place, a stage for Core Formation and Nascent Soul cultivators. Unless one had a compelling reason like Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, even fake Core Formation cultivators wouldn't risk venturing there.
In the Violet Palace, they would be at the bottom, facing constant life-threatening danger.
They were at Hanging Skull Pass, waiting for the spiritual tide to recede so they could enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to seek opportunities.  They never expected to be entangled in such a matter.
The five looked at each other.
Qin Sang's heart was heavier than theirs.  If he continued to follow Duke Dongyang, putting aside the unknown dangers, what would happen to his own affairs?
Both the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the subsequent cultivation techniques of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture" could only be obtained in the Violet Palace. Who knew when it would open again?
But what excuse could he use to refuse?
Qin Sang racked his brains. Feigning injury or fear of death wouldn't work.
He would be easily exposed at the Violet Palace. If Duke Dongyang found out that his disciple dared to deceive him, the consequences would be dire.
Just then, the Black Tortoise Seal floated in front of him. Qin Sang reached out and grabbed it.
The moment his fingers touched the seal, a cyan thread shot out. Qin Sang was startled and quickly tried to shake it off, but the thread was too fast.
A sharp pain shot through his fingertip as the thread cut a wound, and a drop of blood landed on the seal.
The thread quickly climbed up Qin Sang's hand, wrapping around his wrist and forming a thin, bracelet-like mark.
Everything happened in a flash. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he couldn't react in time and could only watch as the mark attached itself to him.
'Roar!'
As the blood dripped, a roar suddenly erupted from the seal.
It was as if a monstrous beast was sealed within. A ferocious aura surged out, directly assaulting the holder's soul.
Like a primordial beast, it seemed to scorn heaven and earth, ready to crush everything!
What kind of beast soul was sealed inside?
Qin Sang was puzzled but remained unmoved. Protected by the Jade Buddha, he wasn't afraid of this soul-level attack.
After hearing a muffled groan beside him, Qin Sang glanced over to see Qiu Mubai's face flushed, his spiritual energy fluctuating as he struggled against the beast soul within the seal.
Qin Sang's heart stirred. He pretended to be struggling, slowly suppressing the beast soul.
The beast soul was helpless against him, while Qin Sang steadily gained the upper hand.  Finally, the beast soul gave up its struggle and gradually quieted down.
It would take time to truly tame and control it, but Qin Sang had a much easier time than Qiu Mubai and the others, and would require less time.
This wasn't good news. Qin Sang was preoccupied.
Soon, Qiu Mubai and the others managed to suppress the beast souls.
Qiu Mubai and Ji Qing were the fastest.
Qin Sang, seeing that the time was right, stopped a little later than the others, frowning at the mark on his wrist.
The mark had fused with his flesh and blood, but despite repeated scans with his divine sense, he couldn't sense anything, as if it didn't exist.
After they suppressed the beast souls, Che Yutao said, "For the next six months, find a room in this residence to cultivate in seclusion. Put all other matters aside and focus on taming the beast souls!"
Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak.
Qiu Mubai, standing beside him, asked hesitantly, "Uncle Che, I heard that even with the Patriarch's protection, Foundation Establishment cultivators can't withstand the pressure of the outer Violet Palace formation and must be sheltered by the Violet Secret Canopy to enter safely."
Che Yutao nodded. "I've already asked the Patriarch and Lady Chenyan. You just need to refine the Five Element Beast Seals and don't worry about anything else.  The Patriarch has other ways to bring you in without the Violet Secret Canopy."
The chosen one was named Yu Wansen, a disciple of a Golden Core cultivator known as Shoushanzi.
Upon hearing that he was to be taken to the Violet Palace, he had been distracted and almost lost control while taming the beast soul.
Yu Wansen's throat moved, and he stammered, "Uncle Che, I've heard that the Violet Palace is fraught with peril. Even Nascent Soul elders have fallen within, and even the Patriarch... If something unexpected happens, will we...?"
"Nonsense! What are you thinking?!"
Che Yutao glared at him, his face grim.  He scoffed, "You few are not even qualified to scout the Violet Palace!  The Patriarch merely wants you to control the Five Element Beast Seals and use their power to break a restriction.  The seals have recognized their masters, and I can't do anything about it. If anyone is afraid of death, go talk to the Patriarch yourself!"
After being scolded, Yu Wansen didn't dare to say anything more and repeatedly said, "This disciple knows his mistake."
Che Yutao snorted, his expression softening slightly. He pointed at Qin Sang and the others and rebuked them, "Think carefully! After this, if you catch the Patriarch's eye, will he treat you poorly when you return from the Violet Palace? Others would beg for this opportunity, yet you hesitate!"
After lecturing them, Che Yutao continued, "You should all have heard that the Violet Palace is divided into inner and outer sections. In the outer hall, just follow the Patriarch and Lady Chenyan. However, when entering the inner hall, you might be randomly transported to different locations. Don't wander around, just find a safe place and wait. The Patriarch and Lady Chenyan will find you based on the marks on your wrists. After breaking the restriction, obey the Patriarch's orders.  As long as you don't trespass into dangerous areas, you will be safe."
â€¦
Qin Sang picked a random room in Che Yutao's residence.
He entered the room, closed the door, activated the restrictions, and his expression immediately darkened.
He sat in the chair for a long while, at a loss.
According to Che Yutao, after they finished in the inner hall, Duke Dongyang wouldn't need them anymore. There might be a chance to escape.
However, Qin Sang knew that this possibility was slim.  They were following Duke Dongyang into the depths of the secret realm and didn't have the ability to leave on their own.
Moreover, Duke Dongyang and Chenyan's constant protection in the outer hall, while reassuring to Yu Wansen and the others, was a major problem for Qin Sang.
The subsequent techniques of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture" and the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit were equally important.  If he was forced to change his cultivation technique, it would be nearly impossible to find another one so suitable for him.
But if he didn't keep his promise and help Granny Jing kill Leng Yuntian, how could he persuade her to reveal the location of Senior Qingzhu's death?
Qin Sang paced back and forth in the room.
Yun Youzi probably didn't have a good solution either.  It was best to contact Granny Jing first to see if she could help him escape from the Violet Palace.
Unfortunately, when they parted ways at Finger Sky Peak, Granny Jing only told him to wait for her at Hanging Skull Pass and didn't leave any way to contact her.  He didn't know when she would arrive.
