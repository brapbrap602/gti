<h1>Chapter 1660: The Xin Jin Yuan Crystal</h1><p>Chapter 1660: The Xin Jin Yuan Crystal</p><p>Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy originates from the earth's veins, flowing deep within the earth's layers.  Cultivators skilled in earth-遁術 (tunshu - earth escape techniques) dare not venture too deep into unfamiliar territories, fearing they might stumble upon a convergence of Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy and be drawn in by its power.</p><p>The actions of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect are clearly more than just drawing in Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy.  Judging by the successive explosions of the Sword Stars and Star Pavilions, the violence of the Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy within the Earth God Prohibition is evident; its danger is no less than that of the Yang Yan God Prohibition or the Seven Mansions Star Division Sword Array.</p><p>The exploding stars were like the tearing apart of celestial bodies.  Two dazzling orbs of light appeared consecutively within the Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to the second orb of light. The first exploding star was a normal Sword Star, but this one was different – a Star Pavilion.</p><p>He had initially guessed that the Five Elements God Prohibitions and the outer fog tide together formed the protective formation of Di Shou Mountain, but his experiences inside, and certain signs within the prohibitions, gave him a different impression.</p><p>Placing a Star Pavilion within the sword array was even stranger. Could it be a place prepared for the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's sword cultivators, for seclusion and to comprehend sword intent?</p><p>As his thoughts raced, Qin Sang watched the entire process of the Star Pavilion's explosion.  First, the starlight was torn and distorted by magnetic force. The four swords hanging above the Star Pavilion reacted, emitting four striking beams of sword light within the orb, like four pillars trying to protect the Star Pavilion.  However, they soon became distorted.</p><p>Separated from the Seven Mansions Star Division Sword Array, these sword intents became rootless duckweed, their power only consumed and not replenished in their struggle against the Yuan Magnetic force.</p><p>The four hanging swords possessed incredibly strong sword intent, instinctively resisting for a while.  However, the aftershocks of the first Sword Star's explosion swept over, instantly shattering one of the hanging swords.</p><p>The other three swords didn't last much longer.  The balance of power within the Star Pavilion was lost; without the support of the sword intent, the Star Pavilion exploded into fragments along with the last hanging sword! It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>Qin Sang watched intently, his eyes fixed on the fragments of the Star Pavilion.  The next moment, his pupils constricted slightly, a look of surprise flashing across his face.  A figure appeared among the fragments.</p><p>It was a female cultivator, dressed in a green robe, with a treasured sword at her side, possessing an extraordinary bearing.  She was clearly a peerless sword cultivator.  Her lively eyes and expression indicated she was very much alive!</p><p>Considering the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had been sealed for so long, the sudden appearance of a living person would undoubtedly be shocking to any observer.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to examine her more closely when the female cultivator's expression suddenly turned ferocious, her limbs twisting violently. He realized it was the effect of the Yuan Magnetic force.  Instantly, the cultivator's body exploded, following the Star Pavilion into dust.</p><p>"Not a living person!" Qin Sang relaxed slightly.</p><p>Except for ancient demons, Bai, and the Ghost Mother – those special existences from the ancient era – Qin Sang had never seen anyone alive for so long.  The moment he saw the female cultivator, his guard had been at its highest.</p><p>Thankfully, it was only a corpse.  But it wasn't an ordinary corpse.  Torn apart by the Yuan Magnetic force, it hadn't been reduced to dust; bone fragments remained, as hard as gold and stone.  Several points of light also appeared with the corpse, even more eye-catching than the bone fragments.</p><p>Noticing the luminous points, Qin Sang's expression shifted. As expected, this woman must have been a cultivator of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  He wondered why she hadn't escaped, why she had perished here. Those points of light were probably her belongings.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang immediately changed his mind and flashed towards the Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy.  The treasures were secondary. The identity of this woman, and the information contained in her belongings, were what Qin Sang valued most.</p><p>He had only entered the array a short time ago and hadn't yet seen the Unwritten Jade Tablet.  The Five Elements God Prohibitions were already so formidable; who knew what other difficulties and obstacles lay ahead?</p><p>If he could find useful information from her belongings, he would gain a significant advantage.</p><p>In another direction, Su Zinan and the others had also witnessed everything.  Being decisive individuals, seeing the corpse and its belongings, they made the same choice as Qin Sang.</p><p>When the three groups rushed forward, the fragments of the Star Pavilion and the first Sword Star collided, converging into a chaotic torrent drawn by the Yuan Magnetic force towards the depths of the Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the two Sword Stars that had escaped the initial calamity were again drawn in due to the distortion of the Yuan Magnetic force caused by the Star Pavilion's explosion.  Perhaps because they had blocked the most violent surge of the Yuan Magnetic force, they did not immediately explode.</p><p>The suction of the Yuan Magnetic force was powerful, and the torrent and Sword Stars drifted at an incredible speed.</p><p>'Whoosh!' Qin Sang arrived at the boundary between the sword array and the Earthly Yuan Magnetic energy, pausing slightly, a thoughtful expression on his face, glancing into the distance.</p><p>A warning from the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  A disturbance in the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field to the right.  It's expected; anyone within the sword array would be drawn to the shining stars.</p><p>However, someone else was faster.  The immense sword stars had obscured my vision.</p><p>Clearly, they're also after the female cultivator's relics.</p><p>I don't know their background, but I won't back down.  Let's see who gets them.</p><p>The geomagnetic force, however, is problematic.</p><p>The Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field significantly counters five-element treasures. This is my first experience with the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic divine restriction; I don't know how much of my strength I can utilize within.</p><p>After experiencing the Sun-Flame divine restriction and the Seven-Mansions Stellar Division Sword Array, the intensity of the geomagnetic force shouldn't be much stronger. This counteraction must also have its limits.</p><p>I stepped in, contacting the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field.  My body felt heavy, locked by a powerful suction force, involuntarily pulled several dozen feet in an instant. It felt like being torn apart by the geomagnetic force.</p><p>With a thought, I channeled the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire into the Mani Pearl. The Gangfire Shield hummed, its surface black flames surging, resisting the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field.  I swayed, but managed to stand firm.</p><p>I looked at the Gangfire Shield, a hint of joy in my eyes.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire is the main source of power for the Gangfire Shield, but through the Mani Pearl's transformation, its nature is no longer purely spirit fire; it has become a special divine Gangfire.</p><p>Thanks to this transformation, the Gangfire Shield protects me. Though not completely free, the effect on me is much less than on others.</p><p>Smiling silently, I flapped my phoenix wings and pursued.</p><p>Su Zi'nan and the three others were already inside the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field when I arrived.</p><p>However, we maintained our distance. After entering the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field, we were drawn apart by the geomagnetic light.</p><p>There was no intention of joining forces.</p><p>Initially, both groups aimed to break the sword array, a common goal allowing for temporary cooperation. But after entering the array's core, finding the solution, and with a rare treasure appearing, this temporary alliance crumbled.</p><p>Both sides are top-tier experts, mutually wary, using the geomagnetic force as a convenient separation.</p><p>The Poison King was still with Master Huaiyin.</p><p>But this time, Master Huaiyin was in front.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's demeanor had changed dramatically.</p><p>Before, he was reserved and calm, taciturn, seeming like the Poison King's follower. If not for the vigorous blood energy within him, he would have been easily overlooked.</p><p>Now, Master Huaiyin was radiating golden light, his skin like gilded foil, clearly using some Buddhist golden body technique.</p><p>Even more astonishing, his blood energy was boiling, steaming from his body, as mercury, turning golden, as if bathed in Buddha light.</p><p>The Nine-Origin Geomagnetic light, upon contacting his golden body, bent and even bounced off.  Master Huaiyin strode forward, like a golden arhat!</p><p>His eyes, like lightning, locked onto the fragment torrent.  His steps were heavy, each one firm, yet seemingly slow but rapid, an unknown movement technique.  Simple yet masterful.</p><p>The Poison King, following behind, found it strenuous.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, a body cultivator, relying on nothing external, remained unaffected in the Nine-Origin Geomagnetic field, but the Poison King's many treasures were useless here.</p><p>The Poison King had no choice but to summon his poison cloud, merging with it.</p><p>The outer edges of the poison cloud churned, constantly being torn by the geomagnetic field.  Each layer consumed was replaced by a new one, thus he wasn't in immediate danger.</p><p>"What makes the Master so urgent?"</p><p>The Poison King called out, full of questions, seeing Master Huaiyin lose his composure for the first time.</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>Master Huaiyin continued walking, his voice booming.  "The humble monk has just seen a Xinjin Yuanjing! This treasure is crucial to the monk's quest, sought for many years."</p><p>Meanwhile, four words appeared in my mind.</p><p>"Xinjin Yuanjing!"</p><p>The Star Pavilion collapsed, a few gleams of treasure appeared.  In a fleeting glance, I noticed a lychee-sized golden bead. It seemed familiar.  Remembering its name, it was the rare Xinjin Yuanjing.</p><p>Xinjin, Yin gold, is the opposite of Gengjin, naturally forming as small golden beads.</p><p>However, Xinjin is soft and smooth, pliable; even a little force can alter its shape. When the Xinjin Yuanjing flew out of the Star Pavilion and encountered the geomagnetic force, it was pulled out of shape.  If not for its unique, externally soft yet internally strong nature, it would have been torn apart.</p><p>This further confirms my judgment.</p><p>庚金 is an exceptionally precious material, supremely strong and resilient, the unparalleled choice for forging spirit swords.</p><p>辛金 source crystal can also be used for refining artifacts, but this isn't its best use. Its true value lies in healing injuries.</p><p>Even if the body suffers severe wounds, even to the point of flesh and bone disintegration, refining and absorbing 辛金 source crystal can repair the body and quickly restore it.</p><p>It's said that cultivating and absorbing 辛金 provides significant benefits.</p><p>Qin Sang learned these secrets from body cultivation texts. He cultivates body refinement and diligently collects relevant texts.  Although he practices a demon cultivation method, he can draw parallels and apply his knowledge.  Unfortunately, he lacks a complete inheritance, and the texts are vague about the "benefits."</p><p>Qin Sang is unaware of the details, but Master Huaiyin knows them completely.</p><p>When 辛金 source crystal is cultivated and absorbed into the body, the body gains a certain level of supreme flexibility, highly beneficial in battle.</p><p>However, for Master Huaiyin, the reason 辛金 source crystal is a must-have item is for another purpose.</p><p>The temple possesses a secret technique that requires 辛金 source crystal to cultivate.</p><p>Legend says that from the formless void to creation, the universe went through five primordial stages, giving rise to material substances. Then came the initial separation of Yin and Yang, leading to the evolution of all things, with various essences floating unpredictably.</p><p>庚金 essence is similar.</p><p>When 庚金 essence accumulates to a certain level, it condenses into 庚金; otherwise, it continues to flow throughout the heavens and earth.</p><p>However, compared to the boundless universe, this 庚金 essence is too dilute for cultivators to perceive, let alone collect.</p><p>This cultivation method involves refining 辛金 source crystal into the bone marrow. Then, using the principle of Yin and Yang attraction, the 辛金 source crystal attracts the free-floating 庚金 essence in the world into the body.</p><p>With 庚金's supreme strength and resilience, it tempers the bones. When cultivated to the extreme, the bones can transform into 庚金.</p><p>Then, shattering artifacts with one's fists will be effortless.</p><p>This secret technique holds significant meaning for Master Huaiyin's path. Unfortunately, 辛金 source crystal is rarer than 庚金, rarely appearing in Central State.  Few monks in the temple throughout history have had the chance to obtain it.</p><p>After entering the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, Master Huaiyin didn't have high hopes.  Unexpectedly, discovering the 辛金 source crystal here, he couldn't miss this opportunity under any circumstances.</p><p>After hearing Master Huaiyin's brief explanation, the Poison King, knowing his determination to obtain the 辛金 source crystal, readily agreed to help him obtain it with all his might.</p><p>As they spoke, everyone pursued the Star Pavilion, entering the depths of the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field.</p><p>At this time, the last two sword stars finally couldn't hold on any longer, their sword intent surging, and they exploded together!</p><p>These two sword stars, pulled together by the Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, exploded simultaneously. This wasn't a simple additive effect; the scale was far more terrifying than the previous single-star explosions.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A dazzling light bloomed in the Nine Yuan Magnetic divine light, like a great sun hanging in the sky, swallowing the torrent.</p><p>Instantly, centered on the sword stars, the surrounding Nine Yuan Magnetic divine light became turbulent.</p><p>The magnetic force there was rampant, and the danger level increased exponentially.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. Seeing this, without much hesitation, he poured all the spiritual fire from the fire lotus into the Mani Pearl, further thickening the Gang Fire Shield, then charged straight in.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Master Huaiyin and the Poison King were also forced to stop.</p><p>The Poison King was secretly shocked.  From afar, it wasn't noticeable, but up close, he felt the astonishing power of the sword star explosions.</p><p>Sensing the violent magnetic force within, the Poison King hesitated slightly.  Immediately, he heard Master Huaiyin's bones cracking, his blood boiling, a golden light flowing over his skin, and the Buddhist light outside his body greatly intensifying.</p><p>This was the manifestation of thick blood energy.</p><p>Then, to the Poison King's astonishment, the blood energy transformed into a golden dragon, circling Master Huaiyin.</p><p>Master Huaiyin held the heavenly dragon; the dragon roared, and the Nine Yuan Magnetic divine light couldn't approach.  Without waiting for the Poison King, he strode toward the chaotic center, fearless, instantly disappearing into the starlight.</p><p>The Poison King couldn't do as easily as Master Huaiyin and could only slow down, proceeding cautiously.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao weren't far behind, and their speed was similar. However, separated by the pervasive Nine Yuan Magnetic Field, they could only vaguely sense each other.</p><p>The sword star explosions caused Su Zinan to squint and assess the situation, but he didn't stop.</p><p>Mo Xingdao caught up and frowned, slowing down like the Poison King, stopping.</p><p>Su Zinan nodded to him and continued forward. The dragon tendon net on his head rattled, seemingly nearing its limit and about to break.</p><p>After escaping Mo Xingdao's perception, Su Zinan secretly summoned the magic banner. Two ghostly figures of Old Wu and Elder Yanshan appeared before him, dissolving into nothingness and rushing into Su Zinan's body.</p><p>Su Zinan's face flushed. He removed the dragon tendon net, and he could actually stand firm!</p>
