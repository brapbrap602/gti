<h1>Chapter 1030: Escape</h1><p>Having shaken off the Stone Ape and the wild beasts, Qin Sang proceeded with even greater caution.</p><p>However, these Stone Spirits lurked beneath the earth, indistinguishable from ordinary rocks when dormant.  Not only were they undetectable by divine sense, but even the Skyeye Butterfly couldn't discern their presence, making it extremely difficult to spot them in advance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the chaotic forest but didn't linger, flying directly towards the water he had seen earlier.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang flew over several mountain ranges.</p><p>His view suddenly broadened.</p><p>Before him lay a vast expanse of water, not the small mountain lake he had envisioned.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang had a hunch. "This is likely the border between the Earth Domain and the Water Domain. I can find the Hundred Treasures Pavilion by following the border, but which way should I go?"</p><p>The four domains were located in the four cardinal directions.</p><p>The Earth Domain was in the west, and the Water Domain in the north. He simply needed to head southwest to reach the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, appearing on the shore.</p><p>The entire Water Domain was covered in water, and it was said that there were also beings similar to the Stone Apes within, a type of water spirit shaped like a three-legged golden toad, called the Water Toad.</p><p>Of course, there was no shortage of wild beasts in the water either.</p><p>Upon reaching the edge of the water, the surroundings were eerily quiet. Seeing no Water Toads, Qin Sang pressed on, continuing deeper into the Water Domain.</p><p>Before long, waves began to rise on the water's surface without any wind.</p><p>Then, with a series of croaks, transparent Water Toads, each the size of a calf, erupted from the water without warning.</p><p>The Water Toads opened their wide mouths, instantly sucking the surrounding waves into their bellies. Their cheeks puffed out, and they spewed out columns of water that transformed into volleys of ice arrows.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...*</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm under pressure. A veil of sword light enveloped him, shattering the incoming ice arrows.  Before the beasts could surround him, he employed his usual tactic, relying on his superior escape technique to leave his enemies far behind.</p><p>At this moment, a look of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>During the Water Toad attack, the Skyeye Butterfly had detected something amiss beforehand.</p><p>When the Water Toads were roused and took form, faint ripples appeared on the water's surface, barely perceptible to the naked eye.</p><p>As long as the Skyeye Butterfly could capture these ripples, Qin Sang could react in time.</p><p>Traveling through the Water Domain was undoubtedly much easier than on land.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang instructed the Skyeye Butterfly to keep a close watch on the water's surface as he flew towards the Hundred Treasures Pavilion on his sword.</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Swirling yellow sand.</p><p>The air shimmered above the sand, and even the wind here was scorching hot.</p><p>The dunes occasionally bulged as wild beasts moved beneath.</p><p>In the midst of this boundless desert, in a desolate area, a ripple suddenly appeared in the air, followed by the emergence of a woman's figure.</p><p>This woman was Su Nu.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, she was cautious upon arrival.  She surveyed the desert below, confirming there was no immediate danger before landing on a large dune to observe her surroundings.</p><p>"This is the Fire Domain."</p><p>Su Nu's knowledge of the Trial Realm far surpassed Qin Sang's. She recognized her location at a glance and quickly determined her bearings, pinpointing the location of the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>"Those guys aren't here. We've been separated. This might be my only chance to escape. If I can reach the Hundred Treasures Pavilion before they arrive, grab a treasure, and teleport out of the Trial Realm into the Inner Hall, I can temporarily escape the East Pole Alliance's control. Then, I can break the bloodline seal in this token and blend in when the Inner Hall is about to close.  That's how I'll be free…"</p><p>Su Nu's expression hardened as she muttered to herself.</p><p>She had never given up hope.</p><p>However, her enemies were overwhelmingly powerful. During the Foundation Establishment stage, it was Yue Xianggu who controlled her. Now, having broken through to the late Core Formation stage, she faced the East Pole Alliance Leader and other Nascent Soul cultivators from the Merchant Alliance.</p><p>Su Nu could only endure, feigning innocence and ignorance until she found an opportunity like this.</p><p>She didn't know what the East Pole Alliance was planning, nor did she have any interest in the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  She just wanted to escape their clutches, the sooner the better.</p><p>Learning that the East Pole Alliance Leader intended to take her to the Seven Kills Hall, a growing unease had been gnawing at her.</p><p>She opened her palm, revealing two items.</p><p>One was the token, a constant reminder of her predicament and a beacon for others to track her.</p><p>The other was a small, black, square seal with a skull. The seal was only the size of a thumb, completely black, with a lifelike skull that seemed to be grinning sinisterly, an eerie sight.</p><p>"I hope it doesn't come to this," Su Nu sighed, murmuring despairingly. "But if it does… who can I trust?"</p><p>She flipped her hand, putting both items away.</p><p>Without further hesitation, Su Nu activated her demonic wings, speeding towards the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as she crossed a dune, the sand cracked open without warning.  A burst of scorching air, tinged with a faint crimson hue, erupted like a pillar of fire.</p><p>The crimson air shot skyward, directly at Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu's expression changed slightly. She rapidly flapped her demonic wings, tilting her body to dodge.</p><p>The crimson air missed, but the attack didn't stop.</p><p>The air abruptly halted mid-air, its form shifting and transforming before finally coalescing into humanoid fire spirits.</p><p>The fire spirits' forms were flickering and insubstantial, but their power was considerable. Like the Stone Apes and Water Toads Qin Sang encountered, they were the guardian beasts of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"I tried to conceal my aura, but I couldn't fool them.  It seems that old geezer was right; these fire spirits have incredibly keen senses…"</p><p>Su Nu's heart sank.</p><p>Her plan had failed.</p><p>The fire spirits hid deep within the dunes, merging with the subterranean flames.  It was impossible to detect them in advance; she could only fight her way through, which would inevitably slow her down.</p><p>The hope of reaching the Hundred Treasures Pavilion before the others dwindled.</p><p>*Thump, thump, thump…*</p><p>Large and small bumps appeared in the surrounding sand.</p><p>As the fire spirits lunged at Su Nu, they opened their mouths, emitting a silent signal that awakened the wild beasts hidden beneath the ground.  The situation was even worse than she had imagined.</p><p>Despite this, Su Nu didn't give up.  She urged her demonic wings, transforming into a streak of black light, pouncing on one of the fire spirits and striking it with a palm of demonic energy.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The fire spirit dispersed into smoke, drifting back into the ground, quickly reforming.</p><p>By now, Su Nu had broken through the fire spirits' encirclement. She swung her demonic blade, slaying several wild beasts, and fled before they could surround her again.</p><p>She had successfully averted the crisis, but Su Nu's expression remained grim.</p><p>Her premonition had come true. She faced wave after wave of attacks along the way. Her escape technique wasn't as refined as Qin Sang's, so she couldn't avoid danger in advance.  She could only forcefully break through each attack.</p><p>To save time, she rarely paused to recover, and her true essence gradually depleted.</p><p>She didn't know how far she had traveled.</p><p>Nor did she know how much longer it would take to reach the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>Just as she was desperately pushing forward, a sound of something splitting the air came from the distance.  Two streaks of light rapidly approached, pursued by several fire spirits.</p><p>"Junior Sister, come quickly! Junior Sister Hong is here too! What a coincidence, all three of us ended up in the Fire Domain!"</p><p>One of the newcomers shouted in an elderly voice.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes darkened.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks to *Kiss and Don't Shoot* for the generous donation!</p><p>Thanks to all readers for your donations and support!</p><p>Things are a bit busy with the New Year approaching, but it's almost over.
