<h1>Chapter 215 The Fiery Jade Centipede</h1><p>Chapter 215 The Fiery Jade Centipede</p><p>Several mountain ranges undulated across the boundless plains, intertwining like giant dragons prostrating on the ground.</p><p>These mountains were quite peculiar; they glimmered under the sunlight with dazzling specks of light, as if they were covered in a layer of reflective scales. Upon closer inspection, one would realize that they were actually transparent 'flowers'.</p><p>Curiously, these 'flowers' were crystal flowers composed of amethysts, yet they bloomed like real flowers, their shapes exquisitely lifelike!</p><p>No one knew why such strange crystal flowers appeared here.</p><p>Millions of 'flowers' competed in their beauty; Qin Sang's figure appeared at the foot of the mountain. He couldn't help but silently marvel at the magnificent sight.</p><p>He discerned the direction, and flew to the waist of a mountain on his sword. Then he took out the Shadow Guard's token, sensed for a while, and slowly walked to a crystal flower.</p><p>The purple crystal flower sparkled under the sunlight, and seemed indistinguishable from the other crystal flowers.</p><p>Who would have thought, that there was a hidden realm concealed within this inconspicuous crystal flower? To be precise, the crystal flower was the entrance to the Tianjing Hidden Realm.</p><p>It had the charm of 'a flower, a world'.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang stood in front of the crystal flower, a strange fluctuation suddenly rippled from the pistil a moment later. Then Qin Sang felt a sharp pain in his forehead, as if it was locked onto by a sharp sword.</p><p>Apparently, the person in the hidden realm had confirmed that Qin Sang was here for the hidden realm, and was issuing a warning.</p><p>"Shadow Guard of Xuanguan Pass, disciple of Mount Shaohua, Qin Sang! Greetings to Senior Brother Tengnan! I was also entrusted by Senior Brother Yuyangzi to deliver a letter. Please open it personally, Senior Brother Tengnan."</p><p>Qin Sang announced his purpose aloud, and raised a jade slip in both hands. A letter from Yuyangzi was inside.</p><p>He saw the pistil suddenly open. Then, the fluctuation turned into a deep vortex, from which a suction force emanated, sucking the jade slip into the hidden realm. Then, a faint voice could be vaguely heard.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, senior..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands folded, waiting quietly.</p><p>A moment later, the light before Qin Sang dimmed, and a man in golden armor appeared in front of him.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin," The man in golden armor bowed to Qin Sang, and said in a gentle tone, "I am Tengnan, responsible for guarding the hidden realm. If there was any neglect, please forgive me, Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly sized up this Senior Brother Tengnan. He might have to spend dozens of years in the hidden realm with him. If he encountered a grumpy person, it would be a big trouble.</p><p>Tengnan was dressed in golden armor; he looked extraordinarily imposing and awe-inspiring, but his face was quite amiable. He shouldn't be a difficult person to get along with.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow, "Senior Brother Tengnan has a responsibility, and it's only right for you to be cautious. It's I, Qin Sang, who have been presumptuous to come and disturb you. I hope I didn't bother Senior Brother Tengnan."</p><p>Tengnan smiled when he heard that. He sized up Qin Sang, and said, "I've read Junior Brother Yuyangzi's letter. Junior Brother Qin, please come with me...Tianjing Hidden Realm is not as rich as other hidden realms, but giving up a cave abode is no problem."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang followed Tengnan into the vortex, and felt his vision blur. The scenery before him changed drastically.</p><p>Blue sky, white clouds, and fresh air. The spiritual energy was unusually strong.</p><p>From the desolate ancient immortal battlefield to Tianjing Hidden Realm, it was like suddenly entering a paradise.</p><p>Several green hills surrounded it, covered with a type of spiritual tree called Huangqiao.</p><p>The green grass in the plains was fragrant, and a large river meandered through it, unknown where it started or ended. On both sides of the river, large and small medicinal herb gardens were opened up, with many spiritual herbs planted inside.</p><p>The familiar sight made Qin Sang a little恍惚, and he suddenly recalled his time in Yuanguang Sect.</p><p>In the depths of the hidden realm, there was an area sealed off by thick fog. Qin Sang knew that it was the biggest secret in the hidden realm, and was either an ancient cultivator's ruins or an ancient medicinal herb garden. In short, it's best not to peek into it.</p><p>After entering the hidden, Qin Sang saw two more guards in golden armor. They were both at the Qi Refining Period. After Tengnan introduced them, he learned that one of them was a disciple of the Shangyuan Purification Palace, and the other was a disciple of the Taiyi Alchemy Sect. They were the ones who had spoken earlier.</p><p>All the guards in the hidden realm were under Tengnan's authority, and they took turns to stand guard.</p><p>"The others have either gone out to train, or are in seclusion. I'll introduce them to Junior Brother Qin later." Tengnan introduced the hidden realm to Qin Sang one by one. Finally, he pointed to the restriction in the sky above the hidden realm, and said, "The hidden realm is not stable, especially when celestial phenomena come. If Junior Brother Qin can lend a hand, I, as your elder brother, will be much more relaxed."</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "Rest assured, Senior Brother Tengnan. When you need me, just give the order. I will definitely not stand idly by."</p><p>Tendō Nodded with satisfaction, leading Qin Sang to a mountain deep inside the secret realm, where he saw more than ten caves carved in cliffs, each sealed by arrays.</p><p>Tendō pointed at one of the caves, "This is where spiritual energy concentrates the most in the entire secret realm, sufficient for the cultivation of Foundation Establishment cultivators. This is my cave. The rest are, for now, unclaimed. You may choose one, Junior Brother Qin. You can open or close the cave with the Shadow Guard token. Here you have a map of the areas around the Jade Crystal Secret Realm. Dens of cloud beasts are marked. Avoid those places when you practice outside, Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>After taking the jade slip from Tendō, Qin Sang put his spiritual perception into it and found that the map inside was much more detailed than the one Jade Yangzi had given him. It must be accumulated by the guards of the Jade Crystal Secret Realm over the years and was thus very precious.</p><p>After putting away the jade slip, Qin Sang immediately took out the Shadow Guard token, expressing his intention to give Tendō half of his merit points for renting the cave. After refusing several times, Tendō finally accepted the merit points.</p><p>The so-called cave was, in fact, just a cavern with rough walls, where one could even see marks from blades and swords. There was only a stone bed in the cavern, nothing more.</p><p>It looked like an abode for savages, but it was a very rare shelter in the Ancient Immortals' Battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang paid no mind to the interior of the cave. After a casual glance, he ignored it, closed his eyes to run the energy art. After a cycle, he stopped and nodded slightly.</p><p>It was far inferior to his Spirit Spring Cave, but it was sufficient for cultivation.</p><p>"Finally, I can cultivate with peace of mind!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with relief while sitting on the stone bed. He thought for a while and took out Yin Xingge's Monster Beast Pouch.</p><p>Besides the pouch and some magic tools scattered on the ground, no valuable mustard seed pouches were found by the Corpse Fiend in the mine. Maybe they fell into a crevice.</p><p>There were many bottles and jars in the Monster Beast Pouch, each holding more than ten kinds of demon bugs.</p><p>There was also a jade slip in the pouch, which recorded the experiences of Herb King Sect in breeding demon bugs. After a thorough study, Qin Sang found that these bugs were of little use. Most were used to assist in the cultivation of spiritual herbs.</p><p>Thinking of Yin Xingge's identity as a descendant of Herb King Sect, Qin Sang instantly understood.</p><p>But there was only one fiery red centipede, and there was no introduction in the jade slip. Qin Sang had an intuition that this bug was unusual. After finding a merchant group affiliated with Monster Controlling Sect in Changyang Market, he spent a lot of money to buy a book titled The Atlas of Demon Bugs from their shop. Only then did he learn that this bug was a rare and strange bug called the Fire Jade Centipede!</p>
