<h1>Chapter 2040: Vastlight Sand</h1><p>In Qin Sang's design, the Four Symbols Sword Formation would transform the four celestial regions to manifest the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>Upon completion, the four sword formations would truly merge into one, their spiritual energies interconnected and mutually reinforcing, jointly manifesting the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>Swords obscuring the heavens, the Four Divine Beasts slaying the enemy, a peerless killing move!</p><p>However, before completion, the sword formations were arranged in the four directions. Though their connections were tight, mutually beneficial, and could trap the enemy within a broader celestial region, increasing the difficulty of breaking the formation through numerous variations, they excelled at confinement but lacked killing power.</p><p>Qin Sang simultaneously deployed the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation and the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation.  One formation had to serve as the main formation, establishing a foundation for the starry sky, while the other assisted. This division created a sense of separate governance. Even if two Divine Beasts appeared together, it resembled a siege rather than a unified whole.</p><p>He had discovered this flaw earlier but lacked a solution. Now, having grasped the art of overlapping formations, he could combine the might of two formations for an instantaneous burst, forging a new path.</p><p>His time in the Sword Path might have only lasted a breath, but for Qin Sang, it was enough to mentally simulate the sword formation countless times. Now, employing it against an enemy for the first time, he felt no hesitation.</p><p>Ling Du was still unaware of this transformation. Trapped within the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation, he recognized the Southern Seven Lunar Mansions and decisively continued using the fine sand to break the formation.</p><p>However, as soon as Ling Du made his move, he sensed the difference between the southern and western celestial regions. Though the two formations' structures were similar, with identical sword stars, the starlight in the southern celestial region seemed more vibrant, giving the impression of a living formation.</p><p>This feeling was inexplicable. Both formations were controlled by Qin Sang, moving according to his will, and should both be living formations. Yet, Ling Du distinctly felt this difference and had a premonition that this formation would be harder to break.</p><p>Just as Ling Du anticipated, the fine sand floated, engulfing the sword stars in a sea of light. Yet, the sword stars flowed with the current, naturally rising and falling within the light stream, undisturbed.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two formations was the presence of a true Vermilion Bird within the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation!</p><p>Ling Du's initial attempt was fruitless. Though unaware of the Vermilion Bird's existence, he vaguely sensed another mystery within the sword stars.  Unwilling to give up, he flipped his palm, revealing a few shimmering silver specks—grains of silver sand.</p><p>Identical in size and shape to the other fine sand, the silver grains scattered into the vast starry sky, instantly vanishing within the sea of light, undetectable.</p><p>As the silver sand was deployed, the sea of light formed by the fine sand became viscous, like a thick liquid, sticky and heavy. Its undulating waves seemed to contain immense power, crashing against the sword stars!</p><p>If anyone witnessed this scene, they would feel as though the void was a curtain, and the sea of light was paste clinging to it. Any movement would distort the void, subsequently shaking the sword stars and the formation.</p><p>This method was undoubtedly profound, but Qin Sang had already changed his strategy.</p><p>Just as Ling Du felt hopeful about breaking the formation, he heard a roaring sound from afar. His expression shifted slightly as he saw the horizon turn crimson. Large stars, trailing long tails of flame, hurtled through the sky.</p><p>The western stars transformed into meteors, their imposing might undeniable, as they charged into the southern celestial region in droves!</p><p>Ling Du was slightly surprised. This scene resembled two sword formations colliding and destroying each other. As the meteors rushed in, their speed increased rather than decreased. If two large stars collided, it would undoubtedly cause catastrophic destruction.  He wouldn't need to act; his opponent would expose his own weaknesses.</p><p>Indeed, the art of overlapping formations was difficult to execute. The spiritual energies of two large formations differed, and the interference between them was challenging to resolve, let alone achieving perfect harmony and joint attack.</p><p>Qin Sang's success stemmed from three factors: First, he obtained the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation during the Nascent Soul stage and had cultivated it for years. Moreover, the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation was his own creation. Second, both formations were part of the Four Symbols Sword Formation, their spiritual energies inherently compatible, further aided by the formation spirits. Third, his enlightenment on the Sword Path resolved many of his doubts.</p><p>His first attempt was seamless, the seemingly perilous scene entirely within Qin Sang's calculations.</p><p>The fiery meteors pierced the sea of light, charging recklessly, filling the gaps where sword stars once resided, then abruptly halting, each taking its designated position. This level of control was exquisite.</p><p>The starry sky became dense and crowded, the two formations nested within each other, their energies intertwined. The complexity far exceeded mere addition.</p><p>However, from Ling Du's perspective, finding weaknesses was now easier.</p><p>There was a universally acknowledged principle in the Dao of Formation Restrictions: No formation was absolute; every formation had a "life gate," a weakness.  It depended on how well the formation master concealed it. If the enemy couldn't discern it, it was as good as nonexistent.</p><p>Now, the formation's confinement ability was inferior to before, its weaknesses more apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware of this. Pursuing offensive power required trade-offs; one couldn't have both. Furthermore, he had only just grasped the art of overlapping formations and hadn't refined it. It was only natural for his opponent to spot the flaws.</p><p>Ling Du knew Qin Sang wouldn't do something counterproductive. Before he could ponder further, he noticed a change in the starry sky. Sensing danger, he reached out, attempting to retrieve the fine sand.</p><p>Simultaneously, both formations activated. The sword stars radiated brilliant light, overpowering the sea of light formed by the fine sand. The converging starlight unleashed unprecedented sword intent.  At the point of greatest concentration, the form of a sacred beast faintly materialized.</p><p>The sacred beast had a bizarre appearance, with bird wings and beast claws, unlike any creature in the world, a fusion of the White Tiger's ferocity and the Vermilion Bird's fierceness.</p><p>A world-shaking roar, both a phoenix's cry and a tiger's roar, echoed through the heavens as the sacred beast lunged downwards!</p><p>Ling Du's expression changed drastically. In his eyes, this wasn't a sacred beast but a peerless sword beam!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Centered around the sacred beast, like a stone thrown into a lake, the sea of fine sand rippled outwards. The fine sand was instantly shattered by the sword intent, turning grey in swathes.</p><p>Originally a tool to break the formation, it couldn't withstand the pressure and was destroyed instead.</p><p>Even with his considerable wealth, Ling Du couldn't help but feel the sting, unwilling to let all the fine sand be ruined.</p><p>This sand, called Vastlight Sand, was difficult to refine. Since learning the method, he had diligently refined it whenever he had free time, accumulating this amount. Especially the few grains of silver sand, each meticulously crafted. If they were shattered, he would have to start from scratch.</p><p>Sensing the sword intent wasn't directed at him, Ling Du dodged slightly, revealing a swan-necked pure bottle in his palm. The Vastlight Sand was stored within.  He pointed the bottle upwards, collecting the light beams shooting down from the starry sea. The pure bottle trembled slightly, a rustling sound emanating from within as he salvaged a portion of the Vastlight Sand.</p><p>At that moment, Ling Du roared. With a ‘crack,’ the bottle suddenly fractured, a sword intent leaping from the cracks.</p><p>It was Qin Sang, using the Sword Rises from the Heart Sea technique, locking onto the Vastlight Sand and slashing at the inside of the bottle.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The golden hammer timely blasted the sword intent apart.</p><p>But the bottle was already broken. The Vastlight Sand's power dissipated, turning into a puff of grey dust, flowing through Ling Du's fingers and scattering with the wind.</p><p>Ling Du's face turned incredibly grim as he watched the sword intent, transformed from the sacred beast, vanish into the void. This attack hadn't harmed him, but it had destroyed his treasure.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Above Jade Lake, outsiders couldn't see the changes within the sword formation, only a slight darkening of the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam appeared out of thin air, its sword intent astonishing.  It effortlessly cleaved the water's surface, leaving a bottomless chasm in the lakebed.</p><p>The lingering sword intent persisted for a long time before the lake water slowly closed. If Jade Lake wasn't vast enough, this single sword strike could have split it in two.</p><p>This was the first time their clash had caused such a commotion, alerting the forces by the lake.</p><p>...</p><p>Ling Du hadn't been this cornered in a long time. He had suffered a significant loss right at the start of the battle. But if his opponent thought this was enough to subdue him, they were gravely mistaken!</p><p>Discarding the bottle fragments, Ling Du instantly forgot his losses. True Essence surged within him, emitting a muffled thunder as he expelled a mouthful of pure vital energy.</p><p>Simultaneously, an object appeared before him – the jade ring he used to break the formation.  The vital energy, upon touching the jade ring, was instantly absorbed.</p><p>Next, black lines appeared on the surface of the jade ring, eventually turning the entire ring black.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The jade ring emitted rings of black Qi, transforming into an identical black ring.  This black ring, seemingly intangible, expanded countless times in an instant, nearly encompassing the entire starry sky within its circumference.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird hidden within the starry sky sensed something sweep past it. Just as it was about to spread its wings and flee, it suddenly felt its surroundings darken.  The black ring had pierced through the starry mist, condensing a black shadow above it, about to engulf it.</p><p>The sword formation had just manifested the fierce beast, shattering the Vastlight Sand, revealing the Vermilion Bird's existence to Ling Du. Whether it was a formation spirit or something else, it was undoubtedly crucial to Qin Sang.  Qin Sang destroyed his Vastlight Sand, so he would capture this creature!</p><p>Qin Sang thought, this person is truly domineering.  This was the perfect opportunity to escape, yet he chose to counterattack, and with impeccable timing.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird, frightened by the black ring, cried out pitifully. Qin Sang ignored its pleas, only commanding it to flee quickly.</p><p>A black light appeared within the starry sea, locking onto the crimson light that was the Vermilion Bird, relentlessly pursuing it.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't allow the Vermilion Bird to be captured.  Silently manipulating the sword formation, he assisted the Vermilion Bird in resisting the black ring. Despite the danger, the sword formation was clearly becoming more refined.</p><p>He longed to continue this process, but his opponent wouldn't comply. Sensing a change in the black ring's fluctuations, Ling Du knew the time was right.  Any further delay, and the Vermilion Bird would truly fall into his hands.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred, and he unleashed another sword intent.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The sword intent struck the black ring squarely.</p><p>Ling Du formed hand seals, about to capture the Vermilion Bird, when the jade ring on his chest emitted a crisp sound, its luster dimming as it fell into his embrace.</p><p>A powerful impact surged from the jade ring.  Ling Du grunted, his face showing surprise as he looked sharply towards the sky.</p><p>Starlight glittered.</p><p>He couldn't see it, but he could sense the black ring shattering completely.  This treasure was far superior to the Vastlight Sand, capable of contending with the previous sword strike. Yet, it was broken with a single blow!</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this sword strike incorporated Qin Sang's understanding of the Sword Domain.</p><p>Against Patriarch Ming Hu, Qin Sang could only feign the Sword Domain's aura, bluffing his way through.  After his enlightenment on the Sword Path, he could now integrate a sliver of his Sword Domain comprehension into his sword techniques.</p><p>His exceptionally fruitful journey on the Sword Path was related to Qin Sang's accumulated knowledge finally blossoming.</p><p>The Purple Star Sword Canon and Senior Tian Yue's sword light had greatly broadened Qin Sang's horizons, elevating him to a level unattainable by his peers.  He had studied the Purple Star Sword Canon and the sword light for years. Often, he was just a hair's breadth away from a breakthrough, lacking only the guidance of a master to push him through.  Finally, on the Sword Path, everything clicked into place.</p><p>Even if another sword cultivator possessed greater talent than Qin Sang, a single trip through the Sword Path wouldn't lead to such a dramatic transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang's current application of the Sword Domain aura was subtle, not enough to intimidate.  His opponent couldn't imagine it, nor would he dare to think of the Sword Domain.</p><p>However, the power of his sword techniques had genuinely increased.</p><p>Ling Du felt a surge of fear. Fortunately, he hadn't neglected his defenses, the golden hammer constantly hovering above his head. Otherwise, if that sword strike had been directed at him, he might have been severely injured!</p><p>He hadn't expected Qin Sang to hold back. Ling Du realized his previous recklessness, having underestimated his opponent.  Trying to break the formation now would only put him a step behind, forcing him into a passive position.</p><p>Unwilling to engage in a direct confrontation, Ling Du acted decisively, expelling vital energy once more.</p><p>The jade ring flashed, appearing on his robe before merging with it.</p><p>The robe then detached from his body, billowing like smoke, forming a perfect circle with a black ring constricting its edges.</p><p>Ling Du leapt into the black circle, his figure disappearing within the swirling smoke.</p><p>Only the black circle remained in the void. The smoke within was thin, insufficient to conceal a person, yet Qin Sang couldn't detect Ling Du's aura at all.</p><p>The black circle resembled a black hole in the void, a space of its own.  Hidden within, Ling Du was shielded from external disturbances.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately urged the sword formation to attack.  Sword beams repeatedly slashed at the black circle, only causing the smoke to churn and the ring to tremble without breaking. He had to destroy it to force Ling Du out.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, Ling Du couldn't remain idle inside, he must be plotting something.  But he remained calm and collected.  Ling Du was concealing his killing move, and he, too, hadn't revealed his full strength.</p><p>He still had Xiao Wu, the Sun Wheel Seal, and the Azure Phoenix True Thunder Arts.  Regardless of the situation, he believed he could handle it. He waited patiently, contemplating his recent gains, even anticipating the greater pressure Ling Du might bring.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, Ling Du was currently within darkness, two orbs of light floating from his dantian, their contents indiscernible.</p><p>Gently stroking the orbs, Ling Du's expression was calm, seemingly confident in this treasure.</p><p>Just as he was about to activate it, Ling Du suddenly frowned.</p><p>A premonition struck him. Even if he deployed this treasure, it wouldn't turn the tide.  The path ahead remained bleak.</p><p>This feeling was fleeting and elusive.</p><p>Ling Du knew it wasn't an illusion but a consequence of his cultivation method.  This premonition didn't occur with every crisis and couldn't be relied upon.  However, whenever it did appear, it proved incredibly accurate.</p><p>"Just who is this person?!"</p><p>Ling Du's composure was truly shaken.</p><p>Remarkable physical cultivation, extraordinary swordsmanship, and he hadn't even revealed his full strength?</p><p>Ling Du's face grew serious.  To subdue this person today, would he have to resort to that step?!</p><p>The rumors were true; he could break through at any time. He had intentionally remained at the initial stage of Void Refinement to further refine his cultivation.</p><p>It wasn't perfectly honed yet, but would he truly break through for this person?</p><p>As Ling Du hesitated, on Jade Lake's eastern shore, within a cluster of immortal mountains and palaces, a gaze had been fixed on Jade Lake since Qin Sang unleashed that sword strike.</p><p>Suddenly, a stream of light flew out, transforming into a spectral figure.</p><p>Within Azure Water Village, Su Nyu sensed something, gazing eastward.  About to reveal herself to assist, she realized it was only an ordinary spectral figure, not a Dharma Body, and thus remained hidden.</p><p>This figure arrived at Jade Lake in an instant, proclaiming loudly, "Fellow Daoists, hold!"</p>
