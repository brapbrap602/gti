<h1>Chapter 482: Pseudo Core Formation</h1><p>Ji Wu's choice caught Qin Sang completely off guard, thoroughly disrupting his plans.</p><p>Obtaining the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris didn't guarantee his Core Formation.  While Qin Sang hadn't personally experienced it yet, seeing the dismal success rate of countless predecessors made it clear how difficult Core Formation was.</p><p>He had no certainty and had to prepare for both success and failure.</p><p>Dove Robe Daoist's Gold Core was the only one Qin Sang currently foresaw a chance of obtaining.</p><p>This was an opportunity he couldn't afford to miss.</p><p>Before leaving Stargazing Island, Serpent Hag had explicitly told them that the subsequent battles wouldn't be as intense. Those who had contributed significantly, like them, could use the excuse of sensing a breakthrough opportunity to return to the sect for closed-door cultivation at any time. This was considered a special reward.</p><p>Having received the Restoration Pill, Ji Wu likely wouldn't remain in the Chaotic Isles for long.  Dove Robe Daoist was anxious to heal his injuries, so the sooner the pill was delivered, the better.</p><p>However, Ji Wu was reclusive and rarely interacted with others. With such a valuable treasure like the Restoration Pill in his possession, he certainly wouldn't dare to publicize his departure. Even if he left, he would do so discreetly, without alerting anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang had no way of knowing his exact whereabouts.</p><p>After sitting in his cave dwelling for a while, Qin Sang abruptly stood up, leaving behind a note. He quietly left the cave, circled around for a long time, and, after confirming he wasn't being followed, flew out of the True Water Mirage Formation.</p><p>Leaving the Chaotic Isles at this time carried a certain risk.  The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris were even more tempting than the Restoration Pill. Since he hadn't reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage and couldn't consume them immediately, there was a chance someone might take a desperate gamble.</p><p>Therefore, he acted with extreme caution. Fortunately, there were no followers.</p><p>Presumably, no one would expect Qin Sang to dare leave the Chaotic Isles at this juncture.</p><p>Flying out of the formation, Qin Sang concealed himself in the shadows, maintaining utmost vigilance. After flying northeast for some distance, he arrived at a desolate islet.</p><p>This islet wasn't much larger than the cave dwellings in the Chaotic Isles and was quite inconspicuous.</p><p>It was already dawn of the second day. The morning sun shone on the wild grass of the islet, and the morning breeze rustled through it like a golden blanket.</p><p>Unfortunately, the spiritual energy in this area was thin. Although the scenery was beautiful, it wasn't suitable for cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after surveying the surroundings, Qin Sang decided to establish his cave dwelling here.</p><p>With spiritual energy protecting his body, he leaped into the water and continued to descend until he reached the bottom.  Qin Sang parted the dense aquatic plants and carved out a cave at the base of the island. He meticulously set up formations and restrictions for defense, concealment, and early warning.</p><p>The cramped cave could barely accommodate a spirit-gathering formation.</p><p>Having made a small fortune at Finger Peak, Qin Sang didn't spare any spirit stones, setting up the best spirit-gathering formation. The spiritual energy within the cave quickly became dense.</p><p>After circulating his cultivation technique for a full cycle, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Next, his mind sank into his Nascent Soul space.  He unexpectedly undid the Illusory Essence Seal on the Heart-Devouring Insect and opened its seal, exposing it and allowing its aura to spread unrestrained.</p><p>This cave dwelling wasn't chosen randomly; Qin Sang had carefully surveyed the area.</p><p>If Ji Wu wanted to return to the Demonic Flame Sect as quickly as possible, there was a high probability he would pass through this area.</p><p>A Heart-Devouring Insect Gu was equivalent to a slave, and it was difficult for ordinary cultivators to resist such a great temptation.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered setting an ambush elsewhere, even near the Demonic Flame Sect, to lure Ji Wu. However, his cultivation wasn't as profound as Ji Wu's, and Ji Wu possessed a flying artifact far superior to the Nethercloud Shuttle. Even at full speed, he couldn't outpace Ji Wu.</p><p>Secondly, he was worried that if he attracted Dove Robe Daoist, he would be in trouble.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang chose to establish his cave dwelling here, waiting for Ji Wu while refining the spirit pills obtained from the elegant young man, thus not delaying his cultivation progress.</p><p>This way, even if he failed to ambush Ji Wu, he could quickly raise his cultivation to Pseudo Core Formation and implement his next plan.</p><p>The cave was hidden underwater, protected by Qin Sang's meticulously prepared formations. Even if cultivators passed by, they wouldn't think anyone would establish a cave in such a barren place.</p><p>Only those who understood the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu would discover Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>The Gold Core cultivators of the Ghost Yin Sect were all dead, so Qin Sang wasn't afraid of attracting opponents he couldn't handle. If any other Ghost Yin Sect remnants were foolish enough to come looking for trouble, he would gladly accept their challenge.</p><p>With preparations complete, Qin Sang put aside distracting thoughts, retrieved the spirit pills from his storage pouch, and entered deep meditation.</p><p>As he refined the spirit pills one by one, Qin Sang's aura steadily increased. He was already very close to Pseudo Core Formation, and with the help of these pills, his cultivation progressed even faster.</p><p>Time passed unnoticed in the silent cave.</p><p>In the dim cave, one could vaguely see the edges and corners carved out by sword qi on the walls.  Within this rough stone cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the cold stone, motionless except to replenish spirit stones when their energy was depleted, fully focused on his cultivation.</p><p>After an unknown period, a soft sigh suddenly echoed within the cave.</p><p>This sigh didn't carry a sense of regret but rather relief and a hint of uncontainable joy.</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up, stretched, and slowly came to, looking down at his body with bright eyes that sparkled with an unusual brilliance.</p><p>Finally, Foundation Establishment complete, Pseudo Core Formation!</p><p>His cultivation had reached a plateau, with nowhere further to advance, awaiting only Core Formation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense that his aura was still somewhat unstable; it was best to consolidate for a period before attempting Core Formation.</p><p>The lingering effects of the damage to his foundation were a slight imperfection, but this was insignificant compared to the joy of breaking through to Pseudo Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the ground casually, hand supporting his chin, savoring this rare moment of ease.  Peaceful times were always fleeting, and the road ahead remained fraught with thorns.</p><p>Reflecting on the past years...</p><p>From arriving in this world to reaching Foundation Establishment, that was a tale for another time.</p><p>Since Foundation Establishment, seventy years had passed.  For seventy years, he hadn't dared to slacken for a moment, experiencing perilous situations numerous times and striving to seize every opportunity.</p><p>Fairy Chenyan, the Celestial Corpse Cave, Hanging Skull Pass, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Boundless Valley, the Chaotic Isles, Finger Peakâ€¦</p><p>These fragments flashed through his mind.</p><p>There was no sadness or joy, only remembrance.</p><p>He hadn't wasted time, hadn't let himself down, and had successfully reached this stage.</p><p>The future was uncertain.</p><p>At least, looking back, he could proudly say - no regrets.</p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p>Lost in thought for a full hour, Qin Sang gathered his wandering thoughts, exhaled deeply, composed himself, and his eyes sharpened.</p><p>Calculating the time, it had been nearly a month since he established this cave dwelling.</p><p>During this month, Qin Sang had sensed cultivators flying overhead several times, but not Ji Wu.</p><p>The cave's restrictions hadn't been triggered either. Ji Wu either hadn't left the Chaotic Isles or had taken another route; he hadn't appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't sealed the Heart-Devouring Insect, yet Ji Wu hadn't taken the bait. The infallible lure had failed!</p>
