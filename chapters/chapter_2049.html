<h1>Chapter 2040:  瀚光 Sand</h1><p>In Qin Sang's plan, the Four Symbols Sword Formation would transform into the four star regions to manifest the Four Sacred Creatures.</p><p>Upon completion, the four sword formations would truly merge into one, their spiritual energy interconnecting and complementing each other, jointly manifesting the Four Sacred Creatures.</p><p>Swords obscuring the heavens, the Four Sacred Creatures slaying the enemy – this is an unparalleled killing move!</p><p>Before reaching completion, the sword formations were arranged in four directions. Although the connections between them were very close and mutually beneficial, they could trap the enemy within a wider star region, adding various changes and greatly increasing the difficulty of breaking the formation. However, while it excelled at confinement, its killing power was insufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang simultaneously deployed the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation and the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation. He needed to choose one as the main formation, establishing a foundation in the starry sky, and then use the other to assist. This created a hierarchy, but also risked them operating independently. Even with two sacred creatures present, it was more like a siege than a unified attack.</p><p>He had previously discovered this flaw and had been at a loss for a solution. Now, having grasped the art of layered formations, he could combine the power of the two formations for an instantaneous burst, a truly novel approach.</p><p>The time spent on the sword path might only be a single breath, yet Qin Sang had mentally practiced the sword formation countless times.  Using it against an enemy for the first time, he felt no hesitation.</p><p>Ling Du was unaware of this transformation in the sword formation.  Falling into the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation, he recognized the Southern Seven Mansions and decisively continued using fine sand to break the formation.</p><p>However, as soon as Ling Du made his move, he sensed a difference between the Southern and Western star regions.  While the formations' structures were similar, and the sword stars were the same, the starlight in the Southern star region seemed more vibrant, giving the impression of a living formation.</p><p>This feeling was inexplicable. Both sword formations were controlled by Qin Sang, moving according to his will, so they should both be considered living formations.  Yet Ling Du genuinely felt this way and had a premonition that this formation might be difficult to break.</p><p>As Ling Du predicted, the fine sand floated, enveloping the sword stars in a sea of light. Surprisingly, the sword stars moved with the flow, naturally rising and falling within the light, unaffected.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two formations was that the Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation had a real Vermilion Bird presiding over it!</p><p>Ling Du's initial attempt failed. Though unaware of the Vermilion Bird's presence, he sensed a hidden mechanism within the sword stars.  He wouldn't give up, however.  He flipped his hand, revealing several silver specks in his palm – silver sand.</p><p>The size and shape of the silver sand were no different from the other fine sand.  Scattered into the vast starry sky, they instantly disappeared into the sea of light, undetectable.</p><p>Upon releasing the silver sand, the sea of light formed by the fine sand became viscous, like paste, sticky and heavy. The undulating waves seemed to contain immense power, fiercely battering the sword stars!</p><p>Anyone witnessing this scene would have thought the void was a curtain, and the sea of light was glue stuck to it. Any movement would distort the void, shaking the sword stars and the sword formation.</p><p>This method was undeniably profound, but Qin Sang had already changed his strategy.</p><p>Just as Ling Du felt he was about to break the formation, he heard a roaring sound from afar. His expression changed slightly, as a crimson glow appeared on the horizon.  Stars, each trailing a long tail of flame, hurtled through the air.</p><p>The Western stars transformed into meteors, their power overwhelming as they charged into the Southern star region in formation.</p><p>Ling Du was slightly surprised.  The scene resembled two sword formations colliding and destroying each other. The meteors, upon entering, not only didn't slow down but accelerated.  Once two large stars collided, it would be a cataclysmic event.  He wouldn't need to lift a finger; his opponent would reveal their weaknesses themselves.</p><p>In reality, the layered formation technique was difficult to perform. The spiritual energy of the two formations differed, and even the slight disturbances between them were hard to resolve.  It was even more challenging to achieve perfect harmony between the two formations and launch a combined attack.</p><p>Qin Sang was able to do it for three reasons:  first, he obtained the Seven Mansions Division Sword Formation during the Yuan Ying stage and had cultivated it for many years. The Southern Vermilion Bird Sword Formation was his own creation; second, both formations were part of the Four Symbols Sword Formation, their spiritual energies were inherently compatible, and he had the aid of formation spirits; third, his enlightenment on the sword path had resolved many of his doubts.</p><p>Its first deployment was seamless. The scene seemed perilous, but it was all within Qin Sang's calculations.</p><p>The fiery meteors broke through the sea of light, charging wildly and inserting themselves into the gaps between the original sword stars. They abruptly stopped, settling into their designated positions – a display of exquisite control.</p><p>The starry sky instantly became crowded and dense.  The dual formations nested together, their energies interlinked, creating complexity far beyond mere addition.</p><p>However, from Ling Du's perspective, it was now easier to find weaknesses.</p><p>A recognized principle of array formations is that there is no impenetrable formation; every formation has a life gate, a weakness.  It all depends on how well the array master conceals it. If the enemy can't see it, then there is no weakness.</p><p>The confinement power of the sword formation was now less effective than before, and its flaws became obvious.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware of the trade-offs inherent in pursuing a decisive victory.  He couldn't have it both ways.  Furthermore, his newly mastered layered formation technique was still rough around the edges, making it unsurprising that his opponent spotted a flaw.</p><p>Ling Du knew Qin Sang wouldn't undertake a fruitless endeavor.  Before he could react, he noticed a strange anomaly in the sky.  Realizing the danger, he instinctively reached for the fine sand, attempting to retrieve it.</p><p>Simultaneously, both formations sprang into action.  The sword stars blazed, their light surpassing even the sea of light created by the fine sand. The starlight converged, unleashing an unprecedentedly powerful sword intent.  At the heart of this intense starlight, a phantom beast manifested.</p><p>The beast's form was bizarre, a grotesque amalgamation of avian wings and bestial claws—a creature unlike any in the world, a fusion of the white tiger and vermillion bird malignant spirits.</p><p>A terrifying roar, a blend of phoenix shriek and tiger growl, shook the very earth as the beast lunged.</p><p>Ling Du's expression changed dramatically. To him, it wasn't a beast, but a devastating blade of light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>With the phantom beast as its epicenter, the impact was like a stone thrown into a lake.  Ripples spread through the sea of fine sand, quickly dissipating it, rendering swathes of it inert and dim.</p><p>The very instrument intended to break the formation was overwhelmed and destroyed.</p><p>Even with Ling Du's considerable wealth, the loss was painful. He couldn't afford to let all the sand be destroyed.</p><p>This sand, known as Han Guang Sand, was difficult to refine. Since mastering its creation, he had diligently refined it in his spare time, accumulating a significant supply.  The silver sand, in particular, was painstakingly crafted, requiring a complete restart if broken.</p><p>Ling Du noticed the sword intent wasn't aimed at him directly.  He dodged slightly, revealing a swan-necked bottle in his palm—the vessel containing the Han Guang Sand.  He pointed the bottle upwards, directing the starlight into it. The bottle trembled gently, a rustling sound indicating the recovery of some of the sand.</p><p>Suddenly, Ling Du roared as the bottle cracked with a *snap*, a sword intent erupting from the fissure.</p><p>It was Qin Sang, using the 'Sword from the Heart Sea' technique, targeting the Han Guang Sand and attacking the interior of the bottle.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>A golden hammer shattered the sword intent.</p><p>But the bottle was already broken, the Han Guang Sand's power lost, reduced to a plume of gray dust that spilled from Ling Du's fingers and scattered in the wind.</p><p>Ling Du's face darkened, his gaze cold as he watched the sword intent, now dissipated, fade into nothingness.  While the attack hadn't harmed him, it had destroyed a valuable treasure.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Over the lake, observers unaware of the intricacies of the formation battle only saw a darkening of the sky.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam appeared, its intent breathtaking, cleaving the water's surface and leaving a chasm in the lakebed.</p><p>The lingering sword intent persisted, and only after a long time did the lake slowly close over the wound. Had the lake been smaller, this single strike would have bisected it.</p><p>This was the first exchange to create such a spectacle, alarming the nearby factions.</p><p>…</p><p>Ling Du hadn't faced such a disadvantageous situation in a long time. He'd suffered a significant setback in the initial exchange. But if his opponent believed this was enough to subdue him, they were gravely mistaken!</p><p>Discarding the bottle fragments, Ling Du immediately cast aside his losses. His internal true energy surged, emitting a dull rumble as he expelled a burst of refined vital energy.</p><p>An object appeared before him—the jade ring used to break the formation.  The vital energy was absorbed instantly.</p><p>Black lines appeared on the jade ring's surface, eventually turning it entirely black.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The ring emitted rings of black energy, transforming into an identical black ring. This ring, seemingly insubstantial, expanded instantaneously, encompassing nearly the entire starry expanse.</p><p>The vermillion bird, hidden amidst the stars, felt something unseen sweep past.  As it prepared to flee, a sudden darkness enveloped it. The black ring had pierced the stellar mist and solidified into a dark shadow directly above, descending to engulf it.</p><p>While the formation had summoned the malignant spirits to destroy the Han Guang Sand, it had also revealed the vermillion bird's position to Ling Du.  Whether a spirit or something else, it was clearly crucial to Qin Sang.  Qin Sang had destroyed his sand; now, he would seize this creature!</p><p>Qin Sang thought his opponent was incredibly ruthless; this was the perfect opportunity to escape, yet he chose to counterattack, and with impeccable timing.</p><p>The vermillion bird cried out in terror. Qin Sang ignored its pleas, only ordering it to flee.</p><p>A dark beam of light appeared in the starlit sky, pursuing the crimson glow that was Zhuque.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let Zhuque be captured. He silently activated his sword formation, assisting Zhuque in defending against the dark ring.  Despite the extreme danger, the sword formation was noticeably improving.</p><p>He wanted to continue indefinitely, but his opponent wouldn't allow it. Sensing an unusual fluctuation in the dark ring, he knew the time was right.  Any further delay risked Zhuque falling into enemy hands.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly shifted his focus and unleashed another sword intent.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The sword intent struck the dark ring squarely.</p><p>Ling Du was chanting an incantation, ready to seize Zhuque, when the jade ring on his chest emitted a sharp crack, its luster dimming as it fell into his bosom.</p><p>A powerful shockwave surged from the jade ring. Ling Du groaned, his face showing surprise as he abruptly looked upwards.</p><p>The stars glittered.</p><p>He couldn't see it, but he sensed the dark ring shatter completely. This treasure was far superior to ordinary Hanguang sand, capable of matching that last strike, yet it had been cleaved in two!</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, that strike incorporated Qin Sang's understanding of the sword domain.</p><p>Against the ancestor of the冥鹘, Qin Sang could only feign a sword domain aura, bluffing his way through. After his enlightenment on the Sword Path, he could now integrate a trace of his sword domain understanding into his swordsmanship.</p><p>The unusually bountiful gains from this Sword Path journey stemmed from Qin Sang's own accumulated strength.  The Ziwei Sword Scripture and the sword light of Master Tianyue had greatly broadened his horizons, elevating him to a level unattainable by his peers.  Years of studying the Ziwei Sword Scripture and sword light had left him just short of a breakthrough, lacking the guidance of a master. Finally, on the Sword Path, everything came together.</p><p>Even a swordsman more talented than Qin Sang wouldn't have achieved such a transformation after a single journey through the Sword Path.</p><p>Qin Sang's current approach kept his sword domain aura faint, not impressive enough to provoke suspicion. His opponent couldn't imagine, nor dare think, of a sword domain.</p><p>But the power of his sword techniques had undeniably increased.</p><p>Ling Du was terrified.  Fortunately, he hadn't been careless, keeping his golden hammer at the ready. Otherwise, that strike would have severely injured him!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang had been holding back. Ling Du realized his previous recklessness and underestimation of his opponent. Any further attempts to break the formation would only slow him down further, leaving him open to attack.</p><p>Unwilling to engage head-on, Ling Du acted decisively, exhaling another burst of vital energy.</p><p>The jade ring reappeared on his robe, merging seamlessly.  Then the robe detached, unfolding into a cloud of smoke that formed a perfect circle, encircled by a dark ring that contained the smoke.</p><p>Ling Du leaped into the dark circle, disappearing within the cloud.</p><p>Only the dark circle remained in the void. The smoke inside was paper-thin, far too small to conceal a person, yet Qin Sang couldn't sense Ling Du's presence at all.</p><p>The circle resembled a black hole in the void, a space unto itself.  Ling Du's concealment prevented outside interference.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately intensified his attack on the sword formation, his sword light repeatedly striking the dark circle. The smoke swirled, the circle trembled incessantly, but proved remarkably resilient.  Breaking it was the only way to force Ling Du out.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that Ling Du wouldn't passively wait, but rather be plotting something.  However, he remained calm; Ling Du was holding back, and so was he.</p><p>He still had Xiao Wu, the Sun Wheel Seal, and the Qingluan True Thunder technique. Regardless of the situation, he was confident in his ability to cope.  He calmly awaited further developments, studying his recent gains, even welcoming the greater pressure Ling Du might bring.</p><p>As Qin Sang anticipated, Ling Du found himself in darkness. Two orbs of light emerged from his dantian, their contents unclear.</p><p>His fingers lightly traced the orbs; Ling Du's expression remained calm, suggesting great confidence in these treasures.</p><p>Just as he was about to activate them, Ling Du frowned slightly.</p><p>A sudden premonition swept over him, a feeling that even with these treasures, he couldn't reverse the situation.  The future seemed bleak.</p><p>The sensation was fleeting, elusive.</p><p>Ling Du knew this wasn't an illusion, but a characteristic of his cultivated techniques.  This premonition didn't occur in every crisis, making it unreliable, yet when it did appear, it proved extremely accurate.</p><p>"What exactly is this person's background?!"</p><p>Ling Du's resolve truly wavered.</p><p>Exceptional cultivation, extraordinary swordsmanship, and he hadn't even exerted his full strength?</p><p>Ling Du's face turned grave.  To subdue this person today, would he have to resort to that?</p><p>The rumors were true; he could break through at any time. He had deliberately remained at the early stage of the Transcending Void realm to refine his cultivation.</p><p>But his refinement wasn't complete.  Would he really break his cultivation limits for this person?</p><p>As Ling Du hesitated, on the eastern shore of Lake Qiong, within a fairy mountain palace, a gaze had been fixed on the lake ever since Qin Sang unleashed that sword strike.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light shot out, transforming into a shadowy figure.</p><p>In Bi Shui Village, Su Nu sensed something and gazed east.  She was about to intervene, but upon noticing it was just an ordinary shadow, not a physical manifestation, she held back.</p><p>The figure rapidly approached Lake Qiong, calling out, "Both Daoist friends, please wait!"</p>
