Chapter 339: Contemplation


Under Tan Hao's expectant gaze, Qin Sang carefully examined Tan Jie.
Unfortunately, his knowledge of alchemy was limited, and he couldn't think of a way to cure Tan Jie.
After a moment's contemplation, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something, his eyes lit up, and he quickly searched his pouch, finally taking out a crystal coffin.
This crystal coffin was a relic left behind by his senior sister Qing Ting and senior brother Jiang after their deaths.
Qin Sang later discovered that the crystal coffin was a peculiar magical artifact. Senior brother Jiang had used it to maintain his vitality without medicinal herbs, slowing the dissipation of his spirit significantly.
It was unclear where Qing Ting obtained the crystal coffin, but it was undoubtedly a precious item.
The crystal coffin was of no use to Qin Sang, but seeing its unique abilities, he kept it.
Now, it proved useful.
Placing Tan Jie inside the crystal coffin would alleviate concerns about his physical body, slowing the dissipation of his spirit, thereby lessening Tan Hao's burden considerably.


Hearing Qin Sang explain the crystal coffin's capabilities, Tan Hao was overjoyed but also somewhat skeptical.
Qin Sang, confident, instructed Tan Hao to lift Tan Jie from the spiritual liquid and place him in the coffin.
Tan Hao's eyes widened, his face full of anticipation as he watched Tan Jie. After a while, he indeed saw a strange energy emanating from the crystal coffin, transforming into a layer of mist that enveloped Tan Jie, nourishing his body.
While it couldn't entirely prevent the dissipation of his spirit, it did significantly slow the process, allowing the effects of the Jing Shen Dan to last much longer.
Though this extension wasn't long, it was incredibly precious to Tan Hao!


"I know a friend who is experienced in treating soul injuries.  Wait here in your cave dwelling. I'm going back to Yinshan Pass to send him a message and see if he can find a solution."
The person Qin Sang referred to was Yun Youzi.
As the saying goes, prolonged illness makes one a doctor. Among Qin Sang's acquaintances, if anyone could find a way to cure Tan Jie, it was Yun Youzi. Yun Youzi was currently cultivating in his cave dwelling, refining medicinal power, so he wouldn't be disturbed.
However, Tan Jie's spirit wasn't simply injured; it was nearly dissipated.  Even Yun Youzi might be unable to save him, but Qin Sang, moved by Tan Hao's plea, was determined to try.
Tan Jie's condition was critical; every day counted.
Without delay, Qin Sang documented Tan Jie's condition in a letter, immediately bid farewell to Tan Hao, activated his You Luo Cloud, and returned to the Ling Dan Pavilion in Yinshan Pass.
When he attempted to use the Taiyi Dan Pavilion's network to send the letter back to Xuanlu Pass, he unexpectedly learned that Yun Youzi had already left seclusion and was on his way to Yinshan Pass, arriving within a few days.


Why was Yun Youzi coming to Yinshan Pass?
Qin Sang was also surprised. After some thought, he returned to Tan Hao's cave dwelling and informed him of the situation, omitting Yun Youzi's identity.
"...It would be best if my friend could examine him in person. But be careful with your words; don't mention past experiences, as if they never happened."
He and Yun Youzi had collaborated several times; they were close friends, and Qin Sang believed Yun Youzi wouldn't harm him without reason, but it was better to be cautious.
Tan Hao didn't ask any questions, nodding without hesitation. "Don't worry, I understand."
His voice held unconcealed excitement and anticipation, along with a hint of worry.
Immediately, they took the unconscious Tan Jie to the outskirts of Yinshan Pass. Qin Sang spent spirit stones to rent two secluded cave dwellings and waited for Yun Youzi.


After settling Tan Hao and his brother, Qin Sang returned to his own cave dwelling.
Located in the swamp outside Yinshan Pass, it was a hollowed-out ancient tree. It was Qin Sang's first time staying in such a dwelling, and he found it quite novel.
The spirit vein must be deep within the swamp, as the spiritual energy in this cave dwelling was exceptionally rich, justifying the price.
However, Qin Sang didn't immediately enter meditation but sat cross-legged on the wooden bed, reflecting on his experiences and the changes in his mindset since encountering Tan Hao.


He had helped Tan Hao and Shi Hong without hesitation.
On the one hand, it stemmed from Tan Hao's righteous warning when Qin Sang purchased the *Youming Jing* in You Shan Marketâ€”a kindness he remembered.
On the other hand, it was also related to his experiences with the Kui Yin Sect. Of those who entered together, only four remained, and Tan Jie had become a living corpse.
Shi Hong and Tan Hao's experiences were exceptionally tortuous, making Qin Sang feel a sense of impending doom.
He had thought they had perished in the great upheaval. Now, knowing they were alive, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't hesitate to help, especially since it was a simple task.
The change in his mindset came later.


Witnessing the familial bond between the Tan brothers, Qin Sang reflected on the love between Qing Ting and Jiang, and even on Yu Daiyue's obsession with cultivation.  He seemed to gain some understanding.

About himself, about love, about the Dao...

"Family, love..."

Qin Sang murmured to himself, his gaze distant, as if seeing beyond time and space.

Love was something Qin Sang had long since put behind him.  But familial affection still resided in his heart, though he deliberately ignored it.

If he hadn't arrived in this new world, completely cutting off the possibility of reunion...

If his parents had suddenly appeared before him before he embarked on the path of cultivation...

Would he still have the resolve to sever his worldly ties?

His Dao heart felt clearer, but he was uncertain what impact this change would have, or how much it would aid his future cultivation.

"Hmph..."

Qin Sang snapped back to attention, exhaling a breath. He took a jade box containing Ghost-Attracting Grass from his pouch, along with the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.

Yun Youzi wouldn't arrive for a few days, giving him time to study the crafting of Heavenly Corpse Talismans.

Out of caution, Qin Sang reread the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* from beginning to end, paying particular attention to the section on creating living corpses, meticulously studying each word.

Creating Heavenly Corpse Talismans was extremely difficult, demanding a high level of skill, especially in controlling spiritual energy and divine sense. Qin Sang couldn't guarantee success every time.

The first step was to refine the Ghost-Attracting Grass into "talisman paper" using the scripture's techniques.

This step seemed relatively straightforward.

Qin Sang committed the entire process to memory, mentally rehearsing it over a dozen times before attempting it. He released the seal on the box, gently removed the Ghost-Attracting Grass, and used his divine sense to observe and analyze each vein within the plant. These veins were crucial, impacting the talisman's success rate.

The leaves must not be damaged during separation.

Soon, Qin Sang fully understood the Ghost-Attracting Grass. After a moment's thought, his divine sense transformed into an invisible blade, lightly slicing the stem.

The cut was clean and precise.

The Ghost-Attracting Grass automatically separated, a single leaf falling.

Success!

Qin Sang's expression brightened as he caught the leaf.
