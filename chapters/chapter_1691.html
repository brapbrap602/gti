<h1>Chapter 1682: A Transaction</h1><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>……</p><p>Rumbling sounds continuously emanated from Emperor Bestowment Mountain. The mountain visibly trembled, the tremors growing stronger and stronger, causing the surrounding earth to shake violently.</p><p>The shockwaves spread far and wide, impacting a large part of the legacy realm.</p><p>Most striking was the multicolored cloud canopy swirling around the mountainside. It expanded at an accelerating pace, spreading across the mountain, threatening to engulf Emperor Bestowment Mountain entirely.</p><p>Within the cloud canopy, flashes of multicolored spiritual light could be seen clashing, the very source of the tremors.</p><p>This was because the Five Elements Crown, the core of the seal, was separating from it. The Five Elements Divine Restrictions had been able to coexist and maintain the cycle of Five Elements generation for so many years, largely thanks to the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Without the spiritual treasure governing the Five Elements, the seal became unbalanced, and the internal conflicts intensified dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body, hidden within the seal, felt it most acutely. The power of the seal became increasingly chaotic, and the Five Elements Divine Restrictions showed signs of going out of control, their power expanding outwards.</p><p>Within the seal, spiritual energy was in turmoil.</p><p>Qin Sang could leave the stone house, but he didn't dare step out of the seal and leave Emperor Bestowment Mountain.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the two Soul Formation cultivators could still divide their attention.  Did they maintain a sliver of their divine sense on Emperor Bestowment Mountain? They clearly weren't fighting with their full strength, and any careless move now could expose him.</p><p>The best opportunity would be when their battle reached its peak.</p><p>If this continued, once the Five Elements Divine Restrictions completely lost their balance, a catastrophic explosion would inevitably occur, destroying Emperor Bestowment Mountain.</p><p>The cultivators outside the mountain dared not approach it any further, lacking the ability to resolve the issues with the seal.</p><p>Some, terrified by the dreadful might of the demonic body, chose to retreat after weighing the risks, lest they become collateral damage.  Even the residual waves of a Soul Formation battle were beyond their ability to withstand.</p><p>Others, bolder and more audacious, saw this as a heaven-sent opportunity.</p><p>Fortune favors the bold!</p><p>If the sky fell, the Soul Formation cultivators would hold it up. If they could suppress the demonic body, all would be well. But if they weren't a match for it, the cultivation world would face utter annihilation, and hiding anywhere would be pointless.</p><p>It was better to seize the moment, while they were occupied, and scour the Boundless Immortal Sect for treasures to empower themselves, increasing their chances of survival.</p><p>Especially the descendants of the Boundless Immortal Sect, who would have to live in hiding regardless of who won.</p><p>With this in mind, the cultivators stopped focusing solely on the Soul Formation battle. Avoiding the battlefield, they scattered in all directions.  Cultivators began to appear in various mystical secret realms, halls, and pavilions of the Boundless Immortal Sect.</p><p>For a time, the legacy realm buzzed with activity, filled with dazzling lights, a scene of flourishing prosperity amidst the impending doom.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu and Holy Venerable Huiguang had no time to pay attention to those below; suppressing the demonic body was paramount.</p><p>Bright Moon Illuminates the Demon.</p><p>Water and Sky Merge.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's opening move was awe-inspiring. A whirlpool of spiritual water transformed into a cage, generating a strange suction force. Moonlight converged, pouring onto the demonic body, growing denser and forming a heavy armor of light, like shackles, exerting immense pressure on the demonic body, pinning it in place.</p><p>Soon, the demonic body's terrifying form was almost invisible, submerged in spiritual water and moonlight.</p><p>However, no one present felt any joy. The demonic energy within the water and moonlight showed no sign of being suppressed. Instead, it continuously assaulted the water-moon cage, each attack fiercer than the last, exuding a terrifying demonic intent that made their hearts tremble.</p><p>The battle formation was completed.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang sat at the center, the undisputed core of the Meditative Arhat Formation.</p><p>The others spread out, surrounding the demonic body.</p><p>The halos behind their heads grew increasingly radiant, each resembling a devout Buddhist disciple who had taken refuge in the Buddha's teachings. Faint images of Buddha statues appeared within the halos, bearing a slight resemblance to Holy Venerable Huiguang.</p><p>In fact, within the Meditative Arhat Formation, they were connected to Holy Venerable Huiguang's mind and intent. Their spiritual energy was unified by the formation, and even though this union was rudimentary, it was stronger than fighting alone, a scattered mob.</p><p>As the core of the formation, Holy Venerable Huiguang's every action could be sensed by the others. Through this connection, they gradually noticed a hint of disharmony in his aura.</p><p>It seemed... like he was injured!</p><p>Everyone present was astute, and they recalled the Five Elements Pill and the previous rumors.</p><p>It could be deduced that Holy Venerable Huiguang must have encountered danger and been injured while exploring the Hall of Delusion, which was why he had been trapped for so long.</p><p>This also explained why he couldn't fight at full strength and had to keep them there. Fortunately, Holy King Qinghu seemed to be in good condition, so they wouldn't have to face the ancient demon's might directly.</p><p>As Holy Venerable Huiguang took out the Five Elements Pill to motivate them, the demonic body's counterattack suddenly intensified.</p><p>Giant waves surged from the center of the spiritual water whirlpool, erupting outwards. The towering waves shattered even the flying swords around them.</p><p>The Jade Lake hanging in the air suddenly plummeted dozens of feet, as if the sky was collapsing.</p><p>Sensing this power, the cultivators outside the mountain trembled in fear.</p><p>As the giant waves erupted, a five-colored beam of light shot out from the center of the whirlpool, instantly dyeing the moonlight five colors and shooting towards the bright moon along the moonlight's path.</p><p>This moon wasn't a true moon but a manifestation of Holy King Qinghu's divine ability. If it was shattered by the Five Elements Crown, allowing the demonic body to escape its cage, it would be even harder to suppress it later.</p><p>This five-colored spiritual light was clearly more powerful than any previous one. The demonic body's strength was actually still increasing!</p><p>Following the Five Elements Pill, Holy Venerable Huiguang promised further rewards.</p><p>Seeing this, Holy Venerable Huiguang closed his mouth, chanted a Buddhist mantra, and pressed down with his right hand.</p><p>"Amitabha!"</p><p>At this moment, the demonic body's instinct hadn't given up on devouring the Poison King, and Holy Venerable Huiguang's Dharma Wheel needed to protect the gray cocoon.</p><p>He held a Bodhi bead in his palm, its surface engraved with a dignified image of Buddha.  As it appeared, chanting filled the air.</p><p>It was unclear what scripture was being chanted, but everyone felt an inexplicable heaviness, knowing this must be a supreme treasure for subduing demons.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Bodhi bead transformed into a streak of crimson-gold light.</p><p>At the same time, Old Devil Fan and the others sensed Holy Venerable Huiguang's mental transmission, precisely grasping the timing to strike.  Their prepared divine abilities and magical treasures were unleashed.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus was damaged, so he had to summon the yellow copper bowl again.</p><p>Yue Lingtian urged his three-legged cauldron to hang upside down, its mouth aimed at the center of the whirlpool, primal yellow light pulsing within.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's wisp of profound energy moved like a phantom.</p><p>Real Person Hegao remained indifferent, his jade smoke flowing and transforming endlessly.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's avatar had the weakest cultivation.  Holy Venerable Huiguang took this into account, placing him in the position with the least pressure. But it was only relative. The avatar summoned his Snow-Treading Divine Saber, its energy condensing into snow, but he felt strained.</p><p>He quickly waved his hand over his head, manifesting a large hand of profound energy to barely maintain his position.</p><p>Secretly, the avatar prepared his hand seals, ready to unleash his Ice Soul Divine Light at any moment.</p><p>They inherited different lineages, their divine abilities vastly different. Yet within the Meditative Arhat Formation, guided by Holy Venerable Huiguang, they cooperated seamlessly.</p><p>Instantly, the battlefield was illuminated by a dazzling array of lights.  Everyone's attacks merged into the crimson-gold stream of the Bodhi bead, combining their power like a thunderbolt, intercepting the five-colored beam of light before it could hit the moon.</p><p>It was at this moment that the avatar contacted Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao glanced at the avatar with a strange look. This person, with a mere mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivation, was the weakest here. He didn't know where he got the nerve to covet the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, about to respond.</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill cry, unlike any human sound, echoed out.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's face changed drastically. She only had time to shout a warning, flicking her jade fingers and opening her lips slightly to exhale a fragrant orchid scent that merged into the spiritual water.</p><p>After this, her face paled slightly.</p><p>In an instant, the giant waves of the Jade Lake froze, as if solidified. The lake water became even purer, like a mirror hanging in midair.</p><p>But the demonic body's shriek instantly pierced through the Jade Lake. Streaks of five-colored light shot out from the center of the whirlpool, instantly churning the lake water into chaos.</p><p>Cracking sounds rang out continuously.  Faults appeared in the lake water, especially at the center of the whirlpool, which seemed on the verge of collapse, revealing the demonic body's form.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang's eyes widened. The Bodhi bead, carrying its remaining power, shot down towards the demonic body.</p><p>The demonic body sensed it and looked up abruptly, its eyes filled with madness and brutality, letting out a low growl as the jade pieces on the Five Elements Crown lit up, shooting out five beams of light.</p><p>The five beams of light were about to collide with the Bodhi bead but didn't merge into a five-colored beam.</p><p>Seeing this, Holy Venerable Huiguang suddenly had a bad premonition. He shouted, striking a Buddhist seal towards the Bodhi bead.  At the same time, the five beams of light suddenly converged, creating a powerful confining force.</p><p>The Bodhi bead's light dimmed. Fortunately, Holy Venerable Huiguang acted in time. It vibrated violently, forcibly breaking free and shooting back.</p><p>The terrifying demonic might shocked everyone.</p><p>"With the strength displayed by the demonic body, we cannot directly confront its edge.  Let alone capturing it alive, even killing it would come at a great cost, unless we separate the demonic body from that five-colored crown, or you and I risk grievous injury."</p><p>Holy King Qinghu's breath came in ragged gasps, stabilizing the Jade Lake while the demonic body was distracted by Holy Venerable Huiguang.</p><p>She transmitted her voice to Holy Venerable Huiguang, her tone grim.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang remained silent.</p><p>Holy King Qinghu said coldly, "These few are not enough. Summon all the Nascent Soul cultivators below and form a battle formation to wear down the demonic body in rotations."</p><p>Her tone was ruthless, showing no concern for how many lives might be lost.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang glanced downwards.</p><p>It wasn't that he wouldn't, but that he couldn't.</p><p>First, these people were a disorganized mob and might become food for the ancient demon. Second, they were all shrewd and had fled far from Emperor Bestowment Mountain when they saw the situation turning bad.</p><p>If he forcibly summoned them, they would definitely scatter. Who would be foolish enough to come here to die?  Only Old Devil Fan and the others were trapped and couldn't escape.</p><p>Even the Demon Kings who received the Holy King's orders hesitated, stopping and starting, deliberately delaying.</p><p>In this situation, only the disciples of Sweet Dew Zen Monastery would still heed his call, but they weren't here.</p><p>As they spoke, Holy Venerable Huiguang and Holy King Qinghu adjusted their strategy. They stopped trying to suppress the demonic body immediately, instead searching for its weaknesses, waiting for its rationality to be completely eroded by the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers, hoping for a turning point.</p><p>A spiritual treasure with a nascent spirit, combined with the ancient demon's own strength, was even more terrifying than they had anticipated.</p><p>The situation eased slightly. Mo Xingdao breathed a sigh of relief and replied, "If Fellow Daoist is confident in obtaining the Five Elements Pill, we can discuss it. If I can survive this and bring out the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit..."</p><p>His expression couldn't hide his bitterness.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit was undoubtedly a source of trouble, with countless eyes staring at it. He didn't know how the old bald donkey planned to deal with him.</p><p>He would probably have to use the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit to save his life in the end.</p><p>Of course, if the old bald donkey kept his promise and let him take the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, he would be very happy to exchange it for the Five Elements Pill, which would be more beneficial to him.</p><p>The avatar nodded silently. He understood Mo Xingdao's predicament. This was just an opening gambit. He needed to escape first before considering the transaction.</p><p>The battle intensified, revealing the demonic body's terrifying power.</p><p>The avatar remained calm. The stronger the demonic body, the higher the value of the items he would offer next.</p><p>After a while, the avatar suddenly looked up at Holy Venerable Huiguang.</p><p>"Senior, do you recognize this?"</p><p>At the same time, cold air gathered above his head, forming a black iron chain.</p><p>Everyone was focused on dealing with the demonic body, but they were startled by the avatar and looked over.</p><p>Seeing the chain, Holy Venerable Huiguang's expression turned serious, and he exclaimed,</p><p>"Demon Binding Chain!"</p><p>Someone in the Central Continent actually recognized this treasure!</p><p>The avatar felt a slight relief.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang's eyes flashed.  "You possess a Demon Binding Chain?"</p><p>The Demon Binding Chain was an ancient treasure specifically designed to restrain ancient demons. With it, the chances of capturing the demonic body alive would greatly increase.</p><p>The avatar hesitated, saying, "This junior has indeed seen a Demon Binding Chain, but it is damaged, and it requires a special spiritual formation to function..."</p><p>Before the avatar could finish, Holy Venerable Huiguang impatiently interrupted, "Back then, the Boundless Immortal Sect obtained a damaged Demon Binding Chain and the corresponding Demon Subduing Formation from the Immortal Hall.  Although they attempted to repair it, due to improper application, the Demon Binding Chain was destroyed by the ancient demon. If Fellow Daoist's Demon Binding Chain isn't severely damaged, this poor monk has a method to restore it."</p><p>So the Boundless Immortal Sect had restored it before.</p><p>The avatar's heart stirred. He sighed, "Unfortunately, the Demon Binding Chain is severely damaged, and its fragments have been refined into other treasures. It's impossible to restore it in a short time."</p><p>Even if it could be restored, the Meteorite Divine Whip wasn't here. He had left it for his disciple to comprehend.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was in an uproar, cursing Qin Sang in their hearts.</p><p>The avatar seemed oblivious. After a moment of hesitation, he manifested another item.  "Since Senior knows the Demon Binding Chain, are you aware of another related treasure, one of a higher grade?"</p><p>What he manifested was the Demon Sealing Stake!</p><p>The Demon Sealing Stake had been refined into the flagpole of the Ten Directions Yama Banner, sealing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, accompanying him for many years. Now, he was prepared to trade it away!</p><p>Although it had been divided into a demonic banner, the internal restrictions hadn't been damaged.  By extracting the soul energy, it could be easily restored.</p><p>"Demon Sealing Stake!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang, with his vast knowledge, recognized the treasure at a glance.</p><p>Since he had revealed it, the avatar didn't hesitate. He waved his hand, breaking the Demon Sealing Stake in two, and declared righteously, "This treasure is also damaged, but only at one point. If Senior has a method of restoration, it might resolve this urgent crisis.  This junior is willing to contribute this treasure to suppress the ancient demon, for the sake of all living beings!"</p><p>However, as he spoke, the avatar looked at the jade bottle containing the Five Elements Pill in the old monk's hand.</p><p>"From which sect or clan does Fellow Daoist hail?" Holy Venerable Huiguang suppressed his joy, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>"This junior is a disciple of the Xie Family from Fudù Prefecture, Zhuozhou. Elder Lu Zhang of Mount Bu'nian is this junior's close friend."</p>
