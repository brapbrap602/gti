<h1>Chapter 1804: Vajra Pagoda</h1><p>Qin Sang speculated that the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* might be the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*, one of the Nine Glorious Seals, but he wasn't certain.  The origins of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* were lost to time, making it impossible to deduce its true nature. Only by cultivating this Dharma Seal to grand completion would he know for sure. However, the Western Buddhist sects possessed half of the *Inner Lion Seal*, which was sufficient evidence that the Storm Realm did indeed have a lineage of the Nine Glorious Seals.</p><p>"I'm curious about the origins of the Nine Glorious Seals.  What does the Venerable One seek by telling this poor Daoist these things?" Qin Sang asked cautiously, maintaining a calm demeanor.</p><p>"The Nine Glorious Seals are the supreme divine abilities of our Buddhist Vajra lineage.  There are nine Buddha Seals in total, each possessing wondrous properties and illustrious power. Sadly, they have all been lost to time, and now can only be found in ancient texts..." Venerable Zhenru sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred slightly.  Buddhists believed gold to be the most solid substance in the world. 'Vajra' symbolized indestructibility, and Buddhist scriptures also recorded Vajra Dharma Protector Deities, celestial beings who upheld the Dharma and held a revered status. Based on the two known Nine Glorious Seals, the Vajra lineage appeared to be a body-cultivation lineage within Buddhism. Qin Sang had personally experienced the power of the *Inner Lion Seal*, and he only possessed half of it. The remaining eight seals were on par with the *Inner Lion Seal*. It was conceivable that the Nine Glorious Seals were indeed supreme divine abilities of Buddhism, and Venerable Zhenru's words were not exaggerated in the slightest.</p><p>Just then, Venerable Zhenru fell silent for a moment, then said, "The purpose of this poor monk's visit involves a secret of our temple.  I hope the True Man can swear a karmic oath to never divulge it in his lifetime."</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, his curiosity piqued.  He readily agreed.</p><p>Once the oath was sworn, Venerable Zhenru chanted a Buddhist mantra.  "Our temple originates from the Vajra lineage, with the *Three Grades Vajra Scripture* as our fundamental cultivation method..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded as he listened. What Venerable Zhenru said wasn't a secret. He had also heard about it when inquiring about Mirror Stage Temple after his return.  Mirror Stage Temple occasionally produced a Deity Transformation stage monk, making it a considerable force in Jushan Prefecture. As Buddhism lacked its own system of governance, Mirror Stage Temple was also subject to the Daoist administration, cultivating the Dragon and Tiger Altar.  With the inherent conflict between Buddhism and Daoism, and the limitations of the Dragon and Tiger Altar, it was conceivable that the monks' cultivation was inevitably affected.  Mirror Stage Temple had yet to produce a saintly monk capable of turning the tide and revitalizing Buddhism.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru paused, then said in a deep voice, "Our temple also holds a Vajra Pagoda! This pagoda's origins are unknown.  It is likely a treasure of the Vajra lineage, but the pagoda has multiple seals, and our temple has yet to break them."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang understood. "Does the Venerable One believe that this poor Daoist's Buddha Seal can unlock the seals?"</p><p>"If the Vajra Pagoda is a sacred pagoda of the Vajra lineage, then the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*, as one of the Nine Glorious Seals, even if it isn't the key to unlocking the seals, it should still prove effective in breaking them," Venerable Zhenru affirmed.</p><p>His gaze towards Qin Sang held a hint of fervor.  Qin Sang knew that what he anticipated wasn't him, but the whereabouts of the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal* he potentially held the key to. Venerable Zhenru believed that the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* was created by emulating the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*. If the origins of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* could be found, it might lead to clues about the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*. Even if the Vajra Pagoda couldn't be opened, obtaining one of the Nine Glorious Seals would be enough to make anyone ecstatic.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned solemn. His following answer brought disappointment to Venerable Zhenru's face. "To be honest, this Buddha Seal, named the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, was obtained by this poor Daoist hundreds of years ago. At the time, I was unaware of its significance and didn't give it much attention.  Now, it's impossible to trace its origins. If the Venerable One doesn't believe me, this poor Daoist can swear an oath.  A supreme divine ability like the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal* is sufficient to establish one's foundation.  The Venerable One is willing to help me find the seal, and this poor Daoist eagerly seeks it. It's truly a mutually beneficial endeavor. There's no need for this poor Daoist to conceal anything."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't seem to be lying, the disappointment in Venerable Zhenru's eyes deepened.  He murmured, "In that case... I can only hope that the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* will be recognized by the Vajra Pagoda."</p><p>Qin Sang still had many questions.  "Dare I ask, what secrets are hidden within the pagoda? Your esteemed temple has produced many accomplished monks.  Haven't they found any way to break the seals?"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru slowly shook his head. The secrets of the Vajra Pagoda remained a mystery, and they didn't even know what treasures were stored within. But one thing was certain: the pagoda was extremely important to them. Once opened, Mirror Stage Temple might rise to great prominence because of it.</p><p>"A grand inheritance of the Vajra lineage, or perhaps Buddhist treasures, or even the Vajra Pagoda itself being a supreme treasure, are all possibilities.  Generations of our temple's ancestors have made countless attempts, yet none have managed to break the seals. We have also invited trusted Daoist friends from outside the temple to assist, but those who don't cultivate Buddhist Dharma are repelled, unable to even enter the pagoda, let alone break the seals..."</p><p>Inviting a Grand True Man from the Daoist Court might allow them to forcibly break the seals. But if that were to happen, the Vajra Pagoda might not remain in Mirror Stage Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Does the Venerable One want this poor Daoist to attempt entering the pagoda and assist in breaking the seals?"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru nodded, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.  Although Qin Sang didn't cultivate Buddhist Dharma, perhaps due to the origins of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, he might be recognized by the pagoda.</p><p>"If the True Man can help this poor monk break the seals, the inheritance within the pagoda will be shared between us.  If it contains solely Buddhist treasures, our temple will compensate the True Man handsomely. We will not let the True Man assist in vain," Venerable Zhenru promised.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded with excitement. In the foreseeable future, combat would rely more on physical cultivation. If he could obtain a supreme divine ability similar to the Nine Glorious Seals from the Vajra Pagoda, it would greatly enhance his own strength.  If he could acquire a superior body-cultivation method of the Buddhist Vajra lineage, it would be even more desirable. He cultivated the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* with a human body. Although it had been relatively smooth so far, there were hidden dangers, and he might be unable to continue due to bloodline incompatibility at any time. Qin Sang had long wanted to find a human body-cultivation method comparable to the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* as a replacement when he reached the end of his current path.</p><p>The two of them reached an agreement.</p><p>There was no time to lose.  True Man Zhijian had entered secluded cultivation again. Qin Sang informed his sword servant of his whereabouts and then set off with Venerable Zhenru for Mirror Stage Temple.</p><p>Leaving Zuo Dai Pass, they continued south.  The Eastern Region, bordering the Demon Kingdom, was in constant turmoil and strife, unlike the western region with its numerous immortal cities connected by a network of small teleportation formations.  Sometimes they entered cities to utilize these formations, and other times they had to fly. It took them five days to reach Mirror Stage Temple.</p><p>Mirror Stage Temple was located atop Mirror Stage Mountain.  This mountain was the highest peak in the vicinity, overlooking the surrounding area, even offering a view of the border of the Demon Kingdom to the east.  However, the overall slopes of Mirror Stage Mountain were gentle, covered in lush vegetation, with many mortals living nearby.  These mortals were protected by Mirror Stage Temple, allowing them to live and work in peace, safe from demonic incursions.</p><p>Two streaks of escaping light flew from afar, heading straight for the summit.</p><p>Atop the mountain stood a magnificent temple, its gates wide open, with monks coming and going.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru didn't disturb anyone, quietly leading Qin Sang into the temple and towards the abbot's quarters.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, True Man."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru went out alone and returned shortly, holding a shimmering blue jade bead in his palm. The jade bead was crystal clear, resembling a drop of water.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru activated the jade bead, saying, "This is the recorded image of the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*."</p><p>Viewing the recording was Qin Sang's request, a form of advance payment.  He gazed intently at the jade bead as white mist emanated from within. The mist gathered between Venerable Zhenru and him, its interior constantly shifting, gradually revealing some illusory images.</p><p>It was a desert scene, with swirling dust and flying sand and stones.  Someone was engaged in combat.  It was evident that the person recording the image was concerned about being affected and maintained a considerable distance from the battlefield.</p><p>Amidst the swirling yellow sand, two figures emerged.  One was a monstrous bird-like demon beast, enormous in size, its gray wings easily stirring up sand and stones with each flap. The other was a human, standing in the void, facing the ferocious demon beast without flinching.</p><p>Despite the blurry image, it was still discernible that this person was wearing monk's robes, a tonsured monk. Most peculiar was the faint, precious light radiating from the monk's body, the color of the azure sky, like clear water. This light enveloped the monk, illuminating everything within and without, piercing through the wind and sand, clearly visible. Venerable Zhenru referred to it as Pure Lapis Lazuli Light, a mark of the Vajra Lapis Lazuli Body achieved through the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*.</p><p>The recording was silent.  The monk and the demon beast clashed, then, in a fit of rage, the demon beast spread its massive wings, instantly closing in on the monk, its sharp claws like blades, slashing towards the monk's head.  Facing this peril, the monk calmly struck out with a palm.  The flying sand suddenly seemed to be drawn by an unseen force, beginning to swirl.  In an instant, a yellow vortex appeared in the void, and the demon beast was caught in its center, flapping its wings frantically.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The wind vortex exploded, unleashing astonishing power that surged in all directions, carrying a sandstorm that rapidly spread outwards.  The recording abruptly ended.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed with brilliance.  That palm strike, the confinement and the explosion, clearly carried the essence of the *Rotating Wheel Seal* and the *Demon Subduing Seal*. These two seals in the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* seemed like crude versions of those techniques. No wonder Venerable Zhenru believed it was created by imitating the *Great Vajra Wheel Seal*.</p><p>The recorded image replayed repeatedly within the mist.  Qin Sang watched with focused attention, lost in thought, and Venerable Zhenru didn't interrupt him.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to correlate the monk's every movement with the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*. Gradually, Qin Sang made another discovery.  The monk gave him a peculiar feeling.  The so-called *Great Vajra Wheel Seal* didn't display overwhelming power in the fight against the demon beast.  The monk's techniques seemed ordinary, yet step by step, he forced the demon beast into a desperate situation, easily neutralizing its desperate attack.</p><p>This feeling, if he had to describe it, Qin Sang thought of one word: unhindered.  Each move and technique seemed effortless, natural, yet precisely the best choice for the moment, as if everything on the battlefield was under his control.  He himself was flawless, neutralizing the enemy's threats effortlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang had a similar feeling after mastering the seventh seal, the *Vajra Great Unhindered Seal*, but compared to the monk, he was only a beginner.  Of course, the power of the Vajra Lapis Lazuli Body was certainly not limited to this. Perhaps that demon beast wasn't strong enough to force the monk to reveal his full strength.  It was a pity the recording was so short.</p><p>After watching it countless times, Qin Sang finally withdrew his focus.</p><p>"What are your thoughts?" Venerable Zhenru asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "The Venerable One's judgment is correct.  There must be a profound connection between the two Buddha Seals. Viewing this recorded image has greatly benefited this poor Daoist. Thank you."</p><p>These words were sincere. Observing the monk's battle had given Qin Sang much to reflect upon.  After returning and meditating on it, his *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* would definitely make great progress.</p><p>Putting away the jade bead, Venerable Zhenru led Qin Sang towards the back mountain.  The layout of Mirror Stage Temple was similar to other temples Qin Sang had seen in the Storm Realm, with many pagodas built on the back mountain, enshrining the relics of past generations of Mirror Stage Temple's monks.</p><p>Passing through the pagoda forest, the two continued onward, descending along a narrow mountain path.  The path was heavily protected by formations and restrictions, and Qin Sang also sensed the auras of powerful monks.  Security was extremely tight.</p><p>At the end of the mountain path was a deep ravine.  Venerable Zhenru pointed his finger at the water's surface repeatedly, nodded at Qin Sang, and leaped into the ravine.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind, encountering no resistance, rapidly descending.  Soon, he reached the bottom and saw a pagoda.</p><p>The pagoda was ancient and simple, hidden beneath the water, seven stories tall.  This reminded Qin Sang of the seven-storied pagoda he obtained from the Pure Sea Sect. Both the seven-storied pagoda and the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* were related to the Pure Sea Sect.  However, that seven-storied pagoda, along with the seven-storied treasure pagoda of the Profound Sky Palace, were crafted by Xiao Xiangzi as warning talismans.  Their materials and construction were different from this pagoda.</p><p>This Vajra Pagoda seemed to be made of wood, an unknown type of black spiritual wood.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru landed in front of the pagoda and pointed at the gate, saying to Qin Sang, "Those who cultivate Buddhist Dharma can enter through this gate.  Those who don't, cannot take a single step inside."</p><p>The pagoda gate was tightly closed.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the gate, observed it for a moment, then, without employing any divine abilities, reached out to touch it.</p><p>Just as his hand was about to make contact, golden light erupted from the gate. A gentle yet immensely powerful force instantly pushed Qin Sang back several zhang.</p><p>After repelling him, the golden light immediately vanished. The gate remained unchanged, without any noticeable fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly amazed. He returned to the gate, formed hand seals, circulated his Qi and blood with the *Auspicious Seal*, activated the *Vajra Celestial Armor Seal*, turning his skin a light gold. At the same time, he silently activated the seventh seal, the *Vajra Great Unhindered Seal*, exchanged a glance with Venerable Zhenru, and once again reached out to touch the gate.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's actions, Venerable Zhenru couldn't help but feel nervous.  If Qin Sang could enter the Vajra Pagoda relying on the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, even if their combined strength wasn't enough to break the seals, they could find a way to exchange for this Dharma Seal from Qin Sang and invite more powerful assistance. The secrets within the pagoda would eventually be revealed.</p><p>Based on past experiences, non-Buddhists would be instantly repelled by a gentle golden light upon touching the gate, just as before. No matter what methods they tried, they couldn't penetrate the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand touched the pagoda gate once more.  The apprehension on Venerable Zhenru's face instantly turned into joy.  There was no golden light!</p><p>He quickly said, "Quickly..."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang, following Venerable Zhenru's earlier instructions, pressed firmly on a specific spot on the gate.</p><p>The gate didn't open, but Qin Sang felt as if he had passed through a barrier.  His figure flickered, passing through the gate and entering the Vajra Pagoda.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, another figure appeared beside Qin Sang, none other than Venerable Zhenru, who had followed closely behind.</p><p>From the outside, the first floor of the pagoda had a diameter of no more than three zhang, but the interior space was remarkably vast. The lighting was normal.  What came into view were cyan jade floor tiles.  Ahead, light and shadow intertwined, making it difficult to see clearly. It seemed as though Buddhist statues stood there.</p><p>"True Man, follow behind me," Venerable Zhenru said, stepping forward.</p><p>Through the explorations of past generations of monks, Mirror Stage Temple was very familiar with the first half of the pagoda.  There would be no danger.</p>
