<h1>Chapter 1298: Aftermath</h1><p>Chapter 1298: Aftermath</p><p>Yu City.</p><p>The struggle for the plains had raged for years.  The forces of Zuoyan had been repeatedly attacked, pushed back to the very gates of Yu City, where they stubbornly held the line.</p><p>Since ancient times, Yu City had been a crucial stronghold of Zuoyan, guarding its northern border.</p><p>After the decision to retreat to Yu City, Zuoyan had made meticulous preparations. The city's defenses were considered impregnable.</p><p>Yet, at this moment, the cultivators within the city were panicked and bewildered, obeying orders with a deep-seated fear and uncertainty in their eyes.</p><p>Months earlier.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance launched a counteroffensive, pushing Zuoyan back.  But they weren’t afraid.</p><p>They knew that as long as their three top masters remained, the Two Realms Alliance only held the upper hand.  At worst, they’d lose some of their previous gains, but Zuoyan’s homeland would remain safe.</p><p>Over the years, Zuoyan had conquered almost half of the Skywalk Plateau.</p><p>The cultivators who survived the battles had amassed wealth beyond their wildest dreams, enough to allow them a period of rest and consolidation.</p><p>But now, things were different!</p><p>The months-long retreat concluded this morning, with Zuoyan's armies successfully regrouping in Yu City.</p><p>Though they had lost the plains and suffered considerable losses, their overall strength remained intact.</p><p>Furthermore, Zuoyan and the desert forces had reached a peace agreement.  Cultivators previously tied up on the western front had all joined them in Yu City, preparing for the Two Realms Alliance's advance.</p><p>The Zuoyan cultivators were confident they could repel the invaders.</p><p>No one expected internal strife to erupt before the enemy arrived, and even less that it would be among their Yuan Ying masters!</p><p>Zuoyan's cultivators were diligently carrying out their defensive preparations.</p><p>Everything seemed normal.</p><p>Seasoned veterans, they were experts at this.</p><p>Suddenly, Yu City trembled violently!</p><p>Then, a horrifying scene unfolded.</p><p>From the inner city's main hall, the palace of the Yuan Ying masters, beams of light shot into the sky, accompanied by screams and furious roars.</p><p>The screams were numerous and harrowing, each one a desperate death rattle filled with bitter resentment.</p><p>Those who heard it felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>Even more terrifying, these screams were familiar— unmistakably those of Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>The beams of light collided, intertwining in a kaleidoscope of colors— beautiful yet deadly.</p><p>Sharp-eyed observers noticed figures within the lights: the Yuan Ying masters were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The Zuoyan Yuan Ying masters clashed in the sky above Yu City.</p><p>Soon, it became clear they weren’t fighting each other, but attacking one person!</p><p>Subsequent shouts confirmed their suspicions.</p><p>"Ye Laomo! You've gone mad!"</p><p>"You dare slaughter so many fellow Daoists!"</p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p>…</p><p>The Yuan Ying masters roared in fury.</p><p>Hearing these shouts, the Zuoyan cultivators’ faces paled, understanding dawning.</p><p>Ye Laomo was slaughtering Yuan Ying masters, inciting the wrath of his peers!</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Previously, Ye Laomo had lived up to his moniker, "Old Devil," being capricious, ruthless, and an enemy to the righteous path.</p><p>But with the alliance between righteous and demonic sects, focused on external threats, Ye Laomo had become more restrained, earning respect as a senior figure.</p><p>He had repeatedly led the charge, his leadership contributing to Zuoyan’s prosperity, even changing the righteous path's perception of him.</p><p>Could all of this have been a facade, a carefully constructed disguise, finally cast off?</p><p>Amidst the confusion, screams continued to emanate from the inner city, each signifying the death of another Yuan Ying master.</p><p>The most terrifying aspect was that the Yuan Ying masters killed by Ye Laomo seemed unable to even escape with their Yuan Ying, their screams abruptly ceasing, leaving them lifeless.</p><p>Though known as the top expert in the Beichen Region, Ye Laomo was not even a Grand Cultivator, yet his power was so terrifying, effortlessly slaughtering Yuan Ying masters before everyone's eyes.</p><p>The entire city was thrown into chaos.</p><p>Finally, the screams stopped.</p><p>Outnumbered, Ye Laomo dared not continue the fight, fleeing the city in a burst of blood-red light. He was about to escape Yu City.</p><p>Master Canghong and the others desperately tried to stop him, but Ye Laomo destroyed the Youjing Tower, escaping unharmed.</p><p>This happened, so of course they couldn't let Ye Laomo escape.  Grandmaster Cang Hong led the pursuit. Thankfully, they left some people behind to stabilize the situation; otherwise, Yu City would have been in chaos.</p><p>Yu City's gates were shut tight, the city's protective array activated, forming a giant lotus blossom, radiating a green glow that enveloped the entire city.</p><p>Three figures hovered in the air—Yuan Ying masters left to maintain order.</p><p>The  members of the  Zui Yuan sect obeyed orders, but their faces were wooden, devoid of expression.</p><p>Without these three overseeing things, many would have likely fled the city.</p><p>After an event like this, how could they possibly continue to defend the city?</p><p>Everyone looked grave, weighed down with worry, their fighting spirit gone.</p><p>Above Yu City.</p><p>The three remaining Yuan Ying masters stood openly, bolstering morale.</p><p>One of them, an elderly man, looked incredibly frail, his face deeply wrinkled, emanating an aura of deep weariness. He sat cross-legged in mid-air, motionless.</p><p>He appeared to be meditating, yet his energy fluctuated wildly, suggesting a severe internal injury, though outwardly he showed no wounds.</p><p>The other two stood on either side of the old man, protecting him.</p><p>They issued commands, and exchanged whispered communications, their faces still etched with anger and shock.</p><p>Finally, the situation in Yu City stabilized.</p><p>The two looked down at the old man and were instantly horrified.</p><p>In just a short time, the old man's wrinkles deepened, and his aura weakened considerably; his vital energy seemed to be draining away with each passing moment.</p><p>The old man, a sect master, once full of imposing presence, was now an aged and frail centenarian, his hair seemingly turning white in an instant.</p><p>Fortunately, his energy stabilized, though there was no sign of improvement, and it seemed unlikely to worsen further.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, then looked towards the direction Ye Laomo had fled, their eyes filled with deep concern.</p><p>“Where does Ye Laomo intend to escape to?”</p><p>“Right now, no one understands Ye Laomo's intentions. It all depends on whether Grandmaster and his men can catch him.”</p><p>“Why hasn’t the Grandmaster returned yet? Although we acted quickly to seal the city gates, there's no guarantee that spies from the Two Realms Alliance haven’t already relayed the news. If they…”</p><p>Before they finished, the lotus array outside Yu City suddenly trembled.</p><p>…</p><p>Master Zhen Yi said calmly, “Don’t worry.” He looked around, seemingly searching for something, then said, “Follow me!”</p><p>The group, their movements swift and silent, followed Master Zhen Yi towards a nearby mountain peak.</p>
