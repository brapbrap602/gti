<h1>Chapter 276: The Profound Vein Harmonizing Pill</h1><p>“The two of us alone can't guarantee complete success. Besides Junior Brother Qin, I've also invited a friend to help. He's already on his way to the legacy site and should arrive soon. If Junior Brother Qin is interested, we can set off immediately. After we break the restriction, the main root of the Earthfire Pan-桐 tree will be yours, and my friend and I will split the Fire-桐 sap. What do you think, Junior Brother Qin?”</p><p>Yu Daiyue seemed to have planned everything out and directly proposed the distribution plan.</p><p>The Earthfire Pan-桐 tree has a main root, which is the most essential part of the entire tree, similar in quality to Blackflame Camphor.</p><p>However, the most valuable part isn't the Earthfire Pan-桐 itself, but the Fire-桐 sap produced in the hollow of its trunk, a rare medicinal substance.</p><p>Having accepted the invitation as a helper, if Qin Sang took the main root, it wouldn't be right to also share the Fire-桐 sap; it would be difficult to justify to others.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately agree but pondered silently.</p><p>If Yun Youzi hadn't extended an invitation beforehand, it wouldn't be a problem to accompany Yu Daiyue, but he was currently waiting for Yun Youzi, and their appointed time was fast approaching.</p><p>A round trip to the ancient legacy site would take at least two months.</p><p>Unfortunately, the two schedules clashed directly!</p><p>Moreover, he had obtained Blackflame Camphor from Di Que's belongings. His Ebony Sword had already devoured and refined it, fully meeting his cultivation needs. He wasn't so desperate for spiritual wood at the moment.</p><p>Compared to the Earthfire Pan-桐, Qin Sang valued the medicine garden more.</p><p>Yu Daiyue's friend was already on the way, and the trial space within the legacy site was destroyed, exposing the stone tablet. Entering the ancient legacy site was much simpler now.</p><p>Many others would be seeking the treasures; delays would be risky. They certainly couldn't wait for him to deal with the medicine garden.</p><p>He couldn't have both.</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang could only decline.</p><p>Yu Daiyue clearly hadn't expected this refusal. His face was full of surprise. “Junior Brother Qin, spiritual trees like the Earthfire Pan-桐 aren't easy to come by. Won't you reconsider?”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement, saying with some regret, “To be honest, Senior Brother, that matter is indeed very important to me; I can't miss it. I can't have you and your friend waiting for me. If someone else gets to the Earthfire Pan-桐 first, I would be to blame. If Senior Brother is short-handed, I can help you contact Senior Brother Mu Yifeng. His strength far surpasses mine and he would be of greater help in breaking the restriction.”</p><p>Yu Daiyue frowned deeply and tried to persuade him a few more times. Seeing Qin Sang's resolve, he shook his head regretfully and stood up. “What a pity. I heard Junior Brother Qin has been in secluded cultivation and thought you were free. I didn't expect such unfortunate timing; it was my presumption. In that case, I won't disturb you any longer.”</p><p>Qin Sang had originally intended to have Mu Yifeng take the main root and then buy it from him.</p><p>It seemed Yu Daiyue wasn't interested in this proposal.</p><p>As he escorted Yu Daiyue out, Qin Sang added, “Senior Brother Yu, if you and your friend are willing to sell the main root of the Earthfire Pan-桐, please consider me. I will certainly do my best to offer a satisfactory price.”</p><p>Yu Daiyue forced a smile. “Of course, I trust Junior Brother Qin's credibility. But we haven't obtained it yet; it’s too early to discuss this… Please return, Junior Brother Qin!”</p><p>A streak of light landed on the peak of a snowy mountain.</p><p>Yu Daiyue stared at Qin Sang’s closed cave entrance, the smile vanishing from his face, replaced by a gloomy expression.</p><p>After a moment, Yu Daiyue summoned his light again and flew away.</p><p>A barely audible cold snort lingered on the mountaintop.</p><p>…</p><p>After seeing Yu Daiyue off, Qin Sang didn't resume his meditative cultivation but took out a jade pendant.</p><p>The pendant was made of the purest white jade.</p><p>Yun Youzi had given him this jade pendant three months ago during his visit.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled a trace of spiritual energy into the pendant.</p><p>In the next moment, a blinding light erupted from the pendant, illuminating the entire cave. Anticipating this, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and focused on the pendant.</p><p>The light from the pendant grew increasingly bright, almost milky white and intensely rich. Then, the light shifted, forming a circular mirror above Qin Sang’s palm.</p><p>A scene appeared in the mirror: a distant mountain.</p><p>Clouds and mist seemed to shroud the mountain. Whether due to the distance or some restriction, it was difficult to see clearly.</p><p>Only a few beams of light could be seen piercing through the clouds and mist, reaching towards the sky from the silhouette of the distant mountain.</p><p>These beams of light varied in color, some bright, some dim. They weren't simply light; spiritual energy pulsed within them, much like the aura of a nascent treasure. In truth, it wasn't the divine light of a treasure but the potent essence emanating from ripening spiritual herbs.</p><p>Among them, a beam of primal yellow energy was particularly prominent, easily ranking within the top three.</p><p>Gazing at this primal yellow energy, Qin Sang recalled Yun Youzi's words:</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, the image within the jade pendant isn't entirely clear, but we can glean some information. The spiritual herb beneath that yellow light is likely Yellow Essence Root.</p><p>You might not be aware, Junior Brother, that the Harmony Pill was originally called the Yellow Essence Harmony Pill. However, due to the lack of Yellow Essence Root, a key ingredient, it couldn't be refined.</p><p>Later, a senior alchemist experimented extensively, modifying the formula and substituting two other herbs for the Yellow Essence Root. Surprisingly, they succeeded in creating a pill with similar effects, albeit slightly weaker than the original Yellow Essence Harmony Pill.</p><p>Due to the scarcity of spiritual herbs in the cultivation world, such substitutions are now commonplace. Most fail, but some even surpass the original formula in potency.</p><p>Without Yellow Essence Root, the name 'Yellow Essence Harmony Pill' became inaccurate, so the 'Yellow Essence' part was dropped, leaving just the Harmony Pill.</p><p>However, the Yellow Essence Harmony Pill has a property that the Harmony Pill lacks, stemming from the Yellow Essence Root.</p><p>If the Yellow Essence Root is of sufficient age, it can be used to refine the Yellow Spirit Pill, a pill that enhances cultivation. The older the root, the more pronounced the effect, and it's most effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  The Yellow Essence Harmony Pill inherits this property.</p><p>Therefore, even if the Yellow Essence Harmony Pill cannot fully heal your hidden injuries, Junior Brother, don't worry about the trip being in vain. Refining the residual energy can enhance your cultivation, pushing you to the cusp of mid-Foundation Establishment, saving you a decade or more of arduous practice.”</p><p>Yun Youzi paused, then added,</p><p>“The most precious ingredient in the Yellow Essence Harmony Pill formula is the Yellow Essence Root. The other ingredients are readily available and can be purchased at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion.  Once you've gathered the ingredients, I'll gladly refine the pill for you, free of charge. While my alchemy skills aren't comparable to our senior uncles', I'm about 70-80% confident of success. Of course, if you're not assured, I can introduce you to them. However, be prepared for a substantial fee.”</p>
