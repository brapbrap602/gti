<h1>Chapter 2227 Leaving the Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 2228 Leaving the Mountain</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Qin Sang stretched, brushing away lingering traces of heat, and smiled contentedly at the two pills in his hand.  One was a potent poison, the other its antidote, both for cultivating the *Poison God Scripture*.</p><p>With his current abilities, he could easily modify the *Poison God Scripture*, integrating it with the *Clear Dew Returning Elixir Technique* to accelerate his cultivation.  He had no shortage of herbs; ever since witnessing Qin Sang's 'talent',  Master Tong Shen had been exceedingly generous, providing more than enough even though Qin Sang didn't require the most precious elixirs.</p><p>“It's worth calling him Master,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, carefully collecting the residue from the alchemy furnace to avoid any reprimand from Master Tong Shen for neglecting his duties.</p><p>Since entering the Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang's diligence hadn't waned, putting Master Tong Shen more at ease, resulting in less frequent checks on his progress, giving Qin Sang more freedom.</p><p>His cultivation was progressing smoothly, and his life had become more structured.  He balanced cultivation and alchemy, spending time in seclusion in his private chamber for cultivation, then in the fire chamber for alchemy.  In truth, he mostly cultivated even while in the fire chamber.</p><p>Though he didn’t prioritize alchemy, he was skilled in it.  These pills were simple for him, and his success rate was extremely high—it was merely a show for Master Tong Shen.</p><p>Even so, in Master Tong Shen’s eyes, this disciple was an unparalleled genius.</p><p>Activating the array formation to seal the earth fire, Qin Sang left the fire chamber.  The morning view of Mount Yuanjing was endlessly captivating.  Qin Sang admired the scenery as he walked towards his private chamber.</p><p>Master Tong Shen wasn't at the mountain gate; he had gone to a gathering with fellow cultivators, promising to bring back a spatial storage device.</p><p>Reaching a pavilion, Qin Sang paused, gazing at the vast expanse beyond the mountains, lost in thought.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, nearly two years had passed.</p><p>Over those two years, Qin Sang had grown accustomed to Mount Yuanjing, to the life of cultivation and alchemy.  Sometimes, he almost forgot this was an illusion, believing himself to be in the real world.</p><p>“Is the Heart Demon Tribulation like this?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t experienced a Heart Demon Tribulation; he had only read about others' experiences in ancient texts.  Some escaped their Heart Demons instantly. Others were trapped, enduring countless illusions, only escaping by chance upon encountering some critical turning point, leaving them terrified in retrospect.</p><p>He relied on the jade Buddha, avoiding the Heart Demon Tribulation and its dangers, but also missing out on its tempering effect.</p><p>“What am I now?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his hands.  He was clearly aware that everything around him was an illusion, yet he couldn't escape it.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed something, his pupils constricting, and he shouted.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Simultaneously, a jade-white light shot from his waist – a jade ruyi, a gift from Mr. Lu.  The material of this jade ruyi had a calming effect, and as a magical artifact, it offered both offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a rare treasure.</p><p>The jade ruyi's movement was subtle, but the force was incredibly sharp, striking at Qin Sang's back. Furthermore, this treasure had a hidden function – catching enemies off guard.</p><p>The jade ruyi’s light transformed into a tiger, suddenly opening its mouth to release a thin needle, faster and quieter than the ruyi itself.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>A girl’s surprised voice came from behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Two dull thuds followed, and Qin Sang felt a powerful force impact the jade ruyi.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The jade ruyi was knocked out of the pavilion and landed on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted, swayed, and then saw a figure appear before him.</p><p>His fingers trembled in his sleeve; he didn't crush the poison pill in his hand.</p><p>This was a specially refined pill, highly potent, capable of severely crippling even Golden Core cultivators.  Currently weak, he had to find another way—preparing life-saving measures.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang felt a finger lift his chin, and a pretty little face approached, curiously examining him, her breath warm on his face.</p><p>“You’re the Master’s new prodigy junior brother?”</p><p>“You are… Senior Sister Qing Hong?”</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed the churning blood in his chest, feigning ignorance.  He thought to himself, ‘How long has it been since anyone dared to tease me like this?’ This senior sister was quite forward.</p><p>Two years into his mountain seclusion, Qin Sang had never met his senior sister.  His master had mentioned she’d returned from retreat twice, each time coinciding with his own seclusion, resulting in missed encounters.</p><p>“Master’s not here, so who else could be in the mountain gate besides us?”</p><p>Qing Hong, noticing Qin Sang’s discomfort, smirked mischievously.  Instead of letting go, she raised her hand higher.  “I didn’t realize you were not only a cultivation prodigy but also a combat prodigy.”</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Qing Hong’s eyes. She’d intended to startle her junior brother, but nearly suffered a setback. His countermove was perfectly timed – either incredibly lucky or not.  Was he really as Master said, two years without leaving the mountain, without sparring with anyone?</p><p>Qin Sang stepped back, escaping her grasp, and bowed.  “Qingfeng greets Senior Sister.”</p><p>Qing Hong pouted. “Why would Master give you such a name?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t argue, completing the courtesy meticulously, resolving to keep his distance from this senior sister in the future.</p><p>“Perfect timing!  Senior Brother is returning. Come, help me greet him!”</p><p>Qing Hong reached out to take Qin Sang’s arm.</p><p>“I’ll go collect my… magical artifact…”</p><p>Qin Sang tried to dodge, but was no match for Qing Hong, his arm firmly captured.</p><p>“Here you go!” Qing Hong hooked a finger, retrieving Qin Sang’s jade ruyi.  “Don’t worry, Senior Sister’s got a light touch; I won’t break your treasure.”</p><p>With that, Qing Hong pulled Qin Sang towards the welcome pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. He wasn't a naive boy; feeling the gentle pressure on his arm, he decided to enjoy it since escape was futile.</p><p>Reaching the pavilion, Qing Hong released his arm, tapping his nose playfully.  “You little flirt! I misjudged you!”</p><p>At that moment, a whistling sound echoed from beyond the mountain, followed shortly by a streak of lightning piercing the mist, landing in the pavilion. A man and a woman appeared.</p><p>The man, tall and upright, was their Senior Brother, Qing Yan.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Brother,” Qin Sang and Qing Hong bowed.</p><p>Qing Hong shoved Qin Sang forward, laughing.  “What did Master say about the little junior brother?”</p><p>Qing Yan smiled warmly. “Our Yuanjing Mountain is fortunate to have such a talented disciple. Junior Sister should be happy. I hear he likes alchemy; I’ve gathered many herbs, a gift for him.  When his alchemy skills improve, I can benefit as well.”</p><p>Qing Hong exclaimed, “Oh dear! I forgot a gift for him. I owe him one!  Junior Brother, just let me know what you want later.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked his senior brother.  Holding the herbs, inhaling their rich fragrance, he also thanked Qing Hong. “Thank you, Senior Sister!  Some herbs are more than enough; less than Senior Brother’s is fine.”</p><p>His senior brother was incredibly generous; the herbs included several rare varieties.</p><p>“No… prob… lem!”</p><p>Qing Hong gritted her teeth, glaring at Qin Sang, emphasizing each word.</p><p>Qing Yan, observing this, smiled. “Junior Brother, Junior Sister, please attend to our guest. This is Miss Shuang, a niece of Master Lu, trained under him.”</p><p>They exchanged greetings.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Miss Shuang was taciturn, a cold woman, though far less frigid than Liuli had been.</p><p>After the pleasantries, Qing Hong asked, “Senior Brother, after years of traveling, did you find a suitable place?”</p><p>“I did. A place to temporarily shelter us in times of crisis,” Qing Yan said gravely.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Qing Hong sensed a change in his tone. Qing Hong’s expression turned serious. “What’s happened?”</p><p>Qing Yan shook his head. “I don’t know the details yet. Master and Master Lu ordered us back to the mountain to pack. If things worsen, we’ll seal the mountain gate and leave Yuanjing Mountain with Master. Master Lu has already sealed his cave.”</p><p>“What? Abandon the mountain gate?”</p><p>Qing Hong gasped, her face etched with reluctance.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was equally grave.  Was this trouble from that time they investigated the portrait?</p><p>Unfortunately, he was too weak, capable only of fleeing.</p><p>“No time to waste. Please wait in the pavilion, Miss Shuang.”</p><p>Qing Yan urged Qin Sang and Qing Hong, “Follow Master’s instructions. Junior Brother, this is a magical artifact Master bought for you. Let me teach you how to refine it…”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it, a dull black bracelet.  After learning from Qing Yan how to use it, he probed it with his spiritual sense, finding the internal space quite small.</p><p>“It’s a Pure Void Stone.”</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recognized the bracelet's material.</p><p>Jing Kong Stone is a unique jade containing a peculiar cavity, which can be refined into a spatial artifact.  Using Jing Kong Stone allows for the creation of stable spatial items.</p><p>However, this refining method has long been abandoned. Qin Sang only learned of it from the Five Elements Alliance's texts.</p><p>Later methods for creating spatial pouches rely on intricate restrictive formations; Jing Kong Stone is no longer a necessary material.</p><p>In the vast world today, this refining technique is widespread and commonplace; its mastery is not particularly difficult, even attainable by ordinary artisans.</p><p>"I wonder which great cultivator from a later age invented this, benefiting all mankind…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, storing his most important possessions inside.  The space was nearly filled.</p><p>The three brothers busied themselves, organizing essential items, and awaited their master at the welcoming pavilion.  Soon, Master Tong Shen arrived, his expression grave.  With a sweep of his sleeve, he activated the mountain-protecting formation, sealing the mountain gate.</p><p>"Qing Yan, come with me. Qing Hong, you take your junior brother and Miss Shuang to the place Qing Yan mentioned and wait for us there!"</p><p>…</p><p>The Evil River.</p><p>The swirling mist, formed from the six-day old Qi, howled incessantly. The black sky, the black sea – the scenery here was monotonous, a desolate wasteland, devoid even of ferocious beasts.</p><p>Suddenly, the six-day old Qi solidified. Two vague figures appeared in the void, gradually taking shape, revealing Ning Zhenren and the old Daoist.</p><p>"The boundary shows no abnormalities.  Master, have you discovered anything?"</p><p>The old Daoist asked.</p><p>Ning Zhenren shook her head slightly.</p><p>Before her words fully left her lips, both turned their gazes to the distance.  A white rainbow sped through the six-day old Qi – a white crane.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The crane landed before them, its wings folded, its feathers as white as snow, exuding a sense of sacredness and pride.</p><p>"Greetings, fellow cultivators."</p><p>The crane opened its beak, spitting out a jade which it held in its mouth. The jade emitted a clear voice, "I didn't expect to disturb Ning Zhenren. Since you two are here, the boundary here must be safe! If I'd known, I wouldn't have sent this crane to investigate. Have you two discovered anything?"</p><p>After a pause, the voice continued, "The Great Dream Divine Lord's enlightenment – we in the Daoist sect only learned of it after the sacred sites opened. Logically, the Demon Realm shouldn't have received the news beforehand."</p><p>Ning Zhenren said, "The rift in the boundary shows no signs of widening, and the seal is intact.  Something must be happening on the other side, causing the boundary to tremble."</p><p>"It seems the Demon Realm is stirring again. We haven't received any news from the border pass."</p><p>The old Daoist sighed, looking at Ning Zhenren, "Master, you must be careful during your upcoming defense at the border pass."</p><p>"In that case, let's not alarm the others. We don't know when the Divine Lord will emerge from seclusion. To guard against the Demon Realm's schemes, the three of us should guard this place for a while."</p><p>The jade in the crane's mouth said.</p><p>The old Daoist looked at the crane, "Fellow cultivator, have you brought the Summoning Dust Veil?  Let's unfurl it, attaching it to the boundary; perhaps we can detect the Demon Realm's plans in advance."</p><p>Immediately, the two cultivators and the crane conjured a large stone, and sat upon it.</p><p>The crane swallowed the jade, then tilted its head back and spat out a purple veil.  The veil was as thin as a cicada's wing, incredibly light, and unfolded gently. It seemed boundless, instantly enveloping the area.</p><p>Far away from this location, the six-day old Qi raged with equal ferocity.</p><p>Battered by storms and waves, a stone island survived, bobbing in the black sea.</p><p>A large stone on the island was hollowed out. Inside, a person sat cross-legged – the same individual who had clashed with Tian Yue Shangren at Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>This person carried a sword, its faint blue light enveloping him and the entire island.  Not a trace of his aura emanated.</p><p>He remained motionless, seeming to be asleep.</p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, shooting out two bright beams of light.  He gazed towards the depths of the Evil River, his eyes revealing surprise and confusion.</p><p>It was just a slight tremor of the boundary; such events had occurred before. At most, it would draw the attention of powerful cultivators from the 異人族 , and as long as nothing else unusual happened, they wouldn't care too much.</p><p>But this time, it seemed to have attracted more than one powerful cultivator, and they seemed to have stopped. Also, the aura of that treasure... it seemed to originate from the Daoist sect?</p><p>He was utterly perplexed, gazing towards the edge of the Evil River, in the direction of Yuan Qiao Sea Market.</p><p>Had something unforeseen happened to the 異人族 ?</p><p>"It seems I have no choice but to abandon it…"</p><p>This thought surfaced in his mind.</p><p>In the presence of such powerful cultivators, every step must be extremely cautious, allowing for no mistakes, no room for luck, especially for a scheme that spans two realms.</p><p>He understood this well.  His eyes flickered, and he closed them. The stone chamber fell silent once more.</p>
