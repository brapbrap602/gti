<h1>Chapter 833: A Miscalculation</h1><p>Only one person.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  She signaled, holding her breath and stilling her movements.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly had excellent eyesight. From a distance, Qin Sang confirmed it was Xiang Yi!</p><p>Madam Liu, hidden deep in the sea, received the signal and immediately activated the spirit talisman.</p><p>The fish was hooked. Now came the hunt!</p><p>Xiang Yi was a well-known late-stage Golden Core cultivator, deeply trusted by the Merchant Guild's leader. Qin Sang believed his strength was comparable to, if not greater than, some peak late-stage cultivators.  He was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.  Her palm closed slightly, and the Ten Directions Yama Banner silently appeared in her hand.</p><p>She had mentally rehearsed this assassination countless times.</p><p>One hand held the Wu Mo Banner, the other the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>She wouldn't rigidly wait for Madam Liu to activate the talisman.  If she could deliver a killing blow at the moment of attack, that would be best; there would be no need for all the trouble later.</p><p>The遁光 (swift light) raced across the sea's surface, pausing occasionally.</p><p>Xiang Yi was cautious, but he didn't suspect the tortoise-shell wood was a trap. He was wary of beasts. Most cultivators currently active outside were like that; they feared encountering a beast tide.</p><p>"Almost…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, clenching her fist.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A piercing sound tore through the air.  Just as Xiang Yi was about to fly overhead, he paused again, surveying his surroundings.</p><p>"Can't wait any longer!"</p><p>Qin Sang urged herself inwardly. Even with her concealment techniques, at such close range, it would be difficult to mask her presence from Xiang Yi's spiritual senses.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang moved, Xiang Yi sensed the change. His eyes turned cold, and he roared, "Who's there?!"</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Water sprayed everywhere.</p><p>A lithe figure leaped from the water—the two-headed demonic beast.</p><p>Seeing the two-headed demonic beast, Xiang Yi's face showed surprise. He clearly hadn't expected such a powerful beast to be lurking in the shadows. He was instantly on alert, fearing he had stumbled into a beast tide, and prepared to retreat.</p><p>But then, Qin Sang and the two-headed demonic beast attacked simultaneously.</p><p>"Ambush! The tortoise-shell wood is a trap!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was startled. His experience allowed him to immediately understand the problem.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden attack, combined with the two-headed demonic beast, cut off Xiang Yi's escape route.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Nine Netherworld Inferno flames soared into the sky. The two-headed demonic beast roared, its vertical pupils shining, as endless wind blades, denser and sharper than before, shot out.  Simultaneously, the two-headed beast lunged at Xiang Yi with its claws, incredibly ferocious.</p><p>Having nearly broken through after consuming the Hegemonic Blood Fruit, its innate abilities and physical body had significantly improved. Now, its physical strength was great enough to engage in close combat with a cultivator.</p><p>As Qin Sang unleashed the Nine Netherworld Inferno flames, a sword light flashed from her brow. The ebony sword, accompanied by deafening thunder, appeared before Xiang Yi in an instant.</p><p>With a single flick of the ebony sword, several sword images sealed off the space around Xiang Yi, poised to pierce several holes in him.</p><p>The ambush had been well-prepared, and Qin Sang's initial attack was overwhelming.</p><p>The shock on Xiang Yi's face hadn't faded when he saw the ebony sword. It looked extremely familiar, and he instantly recognized Qin Sang's identity.  He cried out, "Qingfeng Daozhang, it's you!"</p><p>"That useless Cui Ji!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was furious, cursing angrily. He understood the situation and wished he could tear Cui Ji apart.</p><p>Cui Ji had confidently assured him that Qingfeng Daozhang was dead, that there was no chance he was still alive.</p><p>Now he was standing before him, alive and launching an ambush.</p><p>Although Xiang Yi had considered helping Cui Ji, he hadn't acted, and Cui Ji acted unilaterally, causing him to be implicated and feeling very wronged.</p><p>Xiang Yi suppressed his anger. He felt danger; his opponent's displayed strength was too formidable. No wonder Cui Ji had failed.</p><p>He thought that after the Seven Killing Hall closed, Cui Ji disappeared, possibly not perishing in the Hall's ancient restrictions, but at the hands of Qingfeng Daozhang!</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Xiang Yi was no ordinary person. He saw the situation clearly, realizing that since it was an ambush, there might be more than just one person, and he absolutely couldn't get entangled.</p><p>He glanced around, taking in the converging attacks.</p><p>Though Qin Sang's techniques were powerful, there were inevitably flaws. For an experienced cultivator like Xiang Yi, even the slightest flaw couldn't be hidden.</p><p>Xiang Yi remained calm and made a swift decision.</p><p>He was already on guard against a beast's attack, so he wasn't flustered.  A green light erupted from his body as he activated his protective treasure garment, and he pressed his palm to his Dantian, emitting a red light.</p><p>His innate treasure appeared!</p><p>The two-headed demonic beast's claws and wind blades struck the green light of the protective treasure garment.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The green light trembled and suddenly dimmed.</p><p>The protective garment worn by Xiang Yi was of excellent quality, and his reflexes were lightning-fast, allowing him to evade all but the initial blow.  Though unharmed, the immense force sent him reeling towards the demonic fire and the ebony sword.</p><p>The demonic flames engulfed him. Qin Sang displayed astounding swordsmanship; the ebony sword flashed like a thunderbolt, making Xiang Yi's scalp tingle.</p><p>Without hesitation, Xiang Yi flung his spiritual weapon forward, attempting to force a path.  His weapon was a small red pagoda, spinning rapidly and showering crimson light.  The pagoda, a top-tier mid-grade artifact, combined with Xiang Yi's potent true energy, withstood the onslaught of the demonic fire and ebony sword.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and he unleashed the Blood-Soiled Radiance without hesitation.</p><p>With a whoosh, a bloody light shot from a sword image, seemingly about to engulf the pagoda.</p><p>Then, a surprising sight.  A white light emanated from the base of the pagoda, and a transparent orb shot out, intercepting the Blood-Soiled Radiance at the last moment. It rapidly expanded, taking the brunt of the attack in place of the pagoda.</p><p>The white orb lost its luster, cracking in the middle.  It was a low-grade artifact, secretly concealed within the pagoda, undetected by Qin Sang.</p><p>"Haha..." Xiang Yi laughed maniacally.  "Did you think I didn't know about your foul artifact? Cui Ji's death wasn't in vain; he told me the bloody light came from those black banners! That sword is just a low-grade artifact, and that technique can only be used once! You dreamed of destroying my spiritual weapon!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  Xiang Yi, far from panicking under attack, had cleverly laid a trap, using the Blood-Soiled Radiance against him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't disheartened. He had anticipated this possibility during his preparations. Cui Ji, when enlisting Xiang Yi, would have undoubtedly mentioned the Blood-Soiled Radiance.  It was a surprise tactic only; against a prepared opponent, it was ineffective and its failure was expected.</p><p>The attack failed.  Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately resuming his assault with his artifact.</p><p>Xiang Yi, however, was too cunning to engage in a prolonged fight.  Even if he had the opportunity for a counterattack, this was not the place, regardless of whether Qin Sang had backup.</p><p>The pagoda spun wildly, crimson light blasting forth, colliding with the ebony sword and dispersing the demonic fire. Xiang Yi fought desperately to create an escape route.</p>
