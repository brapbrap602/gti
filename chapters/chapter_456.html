<h1>Chapter 449: External Elixir</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you jesting?” Steward Bao’s face quivered, and after a moment of struggling to contain himself, he slammed his hand on the table and stood up!</p><p>“I needn't explain how precious heavenly materials, earthly treasures, and spirit objects that aid Core Formation are!</p><p>“Just speaking of a demon core, extracted for less than ten years and still retaining its vitality, if I had the ability to kill a Demon Core realm demon beast, why would I need your activated corpses?</p><p>“Moreover, legend says there's a secret method to refine such demon cores into external elixirs. Wouldn't it be better for me to directly trade with a Golden Core cultivator?</p><p>“For mere refined corpses, Fellow Daoist's asking price is exorbitant… Could it be that I inadvertently said something disrespectful, offended Fellow Daoist, and you're now mocking me?”</p><p>Steward Bao was indignant, rebuking Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. He knew that trying to exchange activated corpses for a demon core extracted within ten years was nothing short of wishful thinking.</p><p>Tapping his fingers on the table, Qin Sang calmly said, “Steward Bao only mentioned that demon cores that still retain their vitality are not feasible… So, for ordinary demon cores, there's still a sliver of hope?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Steward Bao opened his mouth, scrutinized Qin Sang, then sat back down, lowering his head slightly, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>After a long while, Steward Bao raised his head and asked in a deep voice, “How many activated corpses can Fellow Daoist provide?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Steward Bao in surprise. Did this person actually have a way?</p><p>But thinking of the difficulty in refining activated corpses, Qin Sang sighed and said, “I can’t say for sure. Even one is difficult to come by… However, I can make Steward Bao a promise. If I ever intend to sell any, your shop will be the first place I come to.”</p><p>“Good! It’s a deal!”</p><p>Having received Qin Sang's promise, Steward Bao immediately forgot his previous displeasure, his expression changing to one of delight. “I await Fellow Daoist’s good news!”</p><p>After leaving the shop, Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he found a glimmer of hope for his Nightfiend here.</p><p>He didn't expect to buy a demon core extracted within ten years, but the hope of buying an ordinary demon core wasn't high either.</p><p>He had the ability to kill False Core realm cultivators, but the highest cultivation level of the activated corpse embryos in his Corpse Puppet Pouch was only late-stage Foundation Establishment, which certainly wouldn't meet Steward Bao's requirements.</p><p>This Steward was a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect, one of the four Flame Envoys of the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>The cultivators of the Small Cold Region were conscripted here, and the Demonic Flame Sect was no exception.</p><p>The battlefield was the best place to destroy evidence, and it wouldn't arouse the suspicion of Daoist Jiupao.</p><p>Qin Sang had been paying attention to the movements of the Kuiyin Sect remnants. He would create opportunities if there were none, silently eliminating Daoist Jiupao's minions and delaying his recovery as much as possible.</p><p>A large portion of the Demonic Flame Sect cultivators who had fallen here had died at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Compared to finding a demon core, capturing a False Core realm expert alive and refining them into an activated corpse was arguably even more difficult.</p><p>All he could say was that another path meant another chance.</p><p>Qin Sang left Mist Island directly, was teleported to another location within the formation, and rode the clouds back to his cave dwelling to continue his closed-door cultivation.</p><p>Inside the cave, the light flickered.</p><p>A batch of spirit stones had been depleted of their spiritual energy, turning into waste stones.</p><p>Qin Sang remained with his eyes closed, unhesitatingly deploying a new batch of spirit stones. He had repeated this action countless times and was no longer as distressed as before.</p><p>After circulating his cultivation method for several cycles, Qin Sang's consciousness left his Nascent Soul space. He looked at his Mustard Seed Pouch and finally retrieved two bottles of spirit pills.</p><p>These were the two bottles of Dragon Departure Pills obtained from Yu Hua's belongings, which Qin Sang had been reluctant to use.</p><p>The jade bottles opened, releasing a fragrant aroma.</p><p>Qin Sang inhaled greedily a few times, then flicked his finger. A spirit pill flew out, landing precisely in his mouth.</p><p>The spirit pill transformed into a warm current, merging into his body. Qin Sang felt his cultivation rapidly increase, sighed softly, and then re-entered meditation to refine the pill's energy.</p><p>Day after day passed.</p><p>Mu Yifeng and the others returned after completing their mission, reported to Stargazing Island, left a flying message talisman at Qin Sang's cave entrance, and then went about their own business.</p><p>Dispatched by Stargazing Island, all teams took turns patrolling, searching for spatial fluctuations.</p><p>For a period after completing a mission, they were free to act as they pleased, waiting for the next round of assignments.</p><p>Qin Sang was oblivious to everything outside, concentrating on refining the Dragon Departure Pills. The pills in the jade bottles dwindled one by one, until finally, one bottle was empty.</p><p>Soon, the second bottle neared its end.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his cultivation method, skillfully gathering spiritual energy to grab a spirit pill, but grasped at nothing. He abruptly awoke, staring blankly at the empty jade bottle, and finally sighed softly.</p><p>The potency of the Dragon Departure Pills went without saying. After consuming two bottles, Qin Sang's cultivation had leaped forward significantly.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was still a considerable gap to the False Core realm.</p><p>“I estimate… it will take another two years…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined his spiritual sea internally, estimating his cultivation level. Without the aid of pills, he would need another two years of arduous cultivation to reach completion and step into the False Core realm.</p><p>If he spared no effort to gather pills, it would be faster.</p><p>Once he reached the False Core realm, he could begin preparations for Core Formation.</p><p>But he had no leads on the spirit objects that aided Core Formation.</p><p>From his breakthrough to late-stage Foundation Establishment, it had only been a little over ten years, and some of that time had been wasted investigating the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>Thanks to the “Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter” and the miraculous spirit pills, his cultivation speed was definitely among the top compared to other cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>One had to remember that he had lingered in the early stage of Foundation Establishment for over thirty years and had only broken through to the middle stage with the help of the Profound Pattern Harmonizing Pill.</p><p>But Qin Sang was still dissatisfied. News from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield frequently arrived. Seven Heroes Pass was completely sealed, the spiritual tide had arrived, and it was intensifying.</p><p>The most worrying aspect was the situation in the Vast Azure Swamp. No one knew how long this fragile peace could last. Qin Sang already sensed turbulent undercurrents.</p><p>He didn't know what the Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Path Alliance were searching for, but once they found it, a great battle was inevitable.</p><p>He cultivated with all his might, never daring to relax for a moment, using everything he had to exchange for cultivation resources, and only then had he managed to catch up.</p><p>When chaos arrived, every bit of increased strength meant a greater chance of survival.</p><p>“Time waits for no one!”</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists, calmed his complex thoughts, and entered deep meditation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this time, Qin Sang only cultivated peacefully for two days. On the third day, he was awakened by the unusual activity of his command token.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He hurriedly retrieved the token and saw it emitting an intensely rich red light, blindingly so!</p><p>Red light represented the strictest of orders.</p><p>He had frequently seen it in the first year. Every appearance of the red light signaled a large-scale battle involving thousands of people!</p><p>This was the first time it had appeared in the final year.</p><p>Qin Sang's face shifted between light and shadow, and he couldn't help but curse.</p><p>“…Why couldn’t it wait two more years?!”</p><p>Despite his cursing, Qin Sang didn't dare disobey the order. He hastily collected the spirit stones in his cave dwelling and, before leaving, took a careful look at the cave where he had stayed for three years.</p><p>A sudden change after such a long period of calm was definitely not a good omen.</p><p>When Qin Sang opened the door, Mu Yifeng and the others had already assembled outside, fully equipped and ready to depart. Like Qin Sang, they were worried, their expressions carrying a mixture of apprehension and unease.</p><p>After confirming the number of members in the team, Qin Sang gave the order.</p><p>Depart!</p>
