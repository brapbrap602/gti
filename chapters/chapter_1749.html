<h1>Chapter 1740: Suzaku, Qilin, Feng Huang, Qingluan</h1><p>Suzaku's spirit thought it had Qin Sang completely under its control.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was preoccupied with other matters.</p><p>An ancient mythical beast, the Qilin, had transformed into a primal source and appeared in this world.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of the "ancient ones" he had encountered before.</p><p>According to Gu Mu, the Immortal Palace and those ancients had different origins.  Let's set aside the Suzaku spirit, Bai, and the Demon Lord from the Immortal Palace for now.</p><p>Beyond the Immortal Palace, other powerful beings from ancient times were also trapped in this realm.</p><p>Among the Wu tribe, there was Gu Mu.</p><p>Among the ancient demons, there was the Jade Bone Demon sealed in the Sinful God Palace, and another demon suppressed beneath the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Even among the Yao tribe, the Qilin primal source wasn't the first remnant spirit of a mythical beast Qin Sang had encountered.  Years ago, in the Northern Star Region, when he obtained the stone tablet, his primordial spirit had been attacked by the Qingluan remnant spirit.</p><p>The Qilin primal source tempted others to cultivate secret techniques, reviving within their bodies.</p><p>The Qingluan remnant spirit lay in wait, its spirit dormant.  Anyone whose spiritual essence resonated with the Qingluan would be awakened upon contact with the stone tablet, directly assaulting their primordial spirit.</p><p>Ultimately, they were both methods of body snatching.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but make a connection.</p><p>He had encountered powerful beings from the Wu, Demon, and Yao tribes!</p><p>These powerful beings were either sealed away or existed only as remnant spirits, and yet they were all scattered in the same small world. This couldn’t be a coincidence.</p><p>Could there have been an ancient war that engulfed all three races, a war so devastating that even these immensely powerful beings couldn’t escape, being cast down to the mortal realm? And this small world was unfortunately chosen as the battlefield?</p><p>What's most intriguing is that these powerful beings from the three races seemed to anticipate their plight, preparing in advance for their escape, each displaying their unique abilities, none of which were normal ascension methods.</p><p>The demons constructed an ascension platform.</p><p>The Wu tribe had a guide in the upper realm, breaking through the barriers and soaring into the sky.</p><p>The Yao tribe simply usurped existing structures, concealing their actions.</p><p>Were there human cultivators with similar experiences, and what kind of escape methods did they leave behind?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly frowned. He had a feeling that these powerful beings from the three races were all afraid of something.</p><p>Were they all like Gu Mu, sealed below the Nascent Soul stage, unable to break through in this world, unable to enter the Netherworld?</p><p>Or was there an unknown risk at the Dao Mark, preventing them from going there?</p><p>Qin Sang thought back to the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound, feeling a sense of unease towards the Dao Mark Gate.  If he was lucky enough to find the ascension platform, should he still explore the Netherworld?  Could there be great terror within?</p><p>He didn't know when the Immortal Palace fell into this world, perhaps he could find out more from this Suzaku spirit, verifying Gu Mu's words.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang suppressed his distracting thoughts, his gaze sweeping over the nine chattering divine birds. He said thoughtfully, "If what you say is true, if you haven't deceived me, and you can save my life, grant me a great opportunity, and protect my descendants, I really can't think of a reason to refuse. However…"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone suddenly changed, "Precisely because of this, I find it hard to believe that such a good thing exists. Even if the Qilin primal source can be found, it surely won't be easy to subdue, right?"</p><p>The Suzaku spirit sneered, "Of course it's not that easy. Unless the Qilin was near death at the time, it must have left behind means to protect its primal source. With your current cultivation, don't even dream of it."</p><p>In this world, perhaps only the Suzaku spirit dared to scorn Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang, instead of getting angry, smiled. "So, you don't currently have the ability to absorb the Qilin primal source?  Or perhaps, even if you find the Qilin primal source in the future, you won't be entirely confident. Bringing me along is actually to find an assistant."</p><p>The Suzaku spirit paused, then angrily retorted, "Many want to help this Suzaku find the Qilin primal source, but you're the only one who doesn't know what's good for you! If your strength is insufficient, this Suzaku won't carry a burden."</p><p>Qin Sang reassured, "Senior, please calm down. I just want to confirm one thing, that I am not useless to you, so that I can confidently follow you.  Senior can rest assured, I believe my determination to pursue the Dao is no less than others, and even without the temptation of the Qilin primal source, my cultivation will not falter."</p><p>The Suzaku spirit snorted, its anger subsiding slightly.</p><p>Looking at the Solar God Tree, a strange light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He deliberately provoked the Suzaku spirit for another purpose. Since the Suzaku spirit appeared, he had been silently observing, subtly probing its strength.</p><p>"Senior, don't you feel a little uncomfortable anywhere?" Qin Sang suddenly asked an irrelevant question, his expression slightly strange.</p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p>The Suzaku spirit was taken aback, puzzled.</p><p>"Nothing," Qin Sang slightly shook his head, "Junior is worried that extracting the essence from the Qilin primal source might be incompatible with your true spirit."</p><p>If anything goes wrong, not only will the elder suffer the backlash, but it will also affect the younger generation, and they will die even faster.”</p><p>He couldn't help but glance at the Sun God Tree twice as he spoke.</p><p>After the Vermilion Bird spirit appeared, it didn't mention the Heavenly Demon's Sound. Judging by its tone, it didn't seem to be affected by it. Could it be that it doesn't know about it?</p><p>Even the Five Elements Crowned Demon Spirits, which hadn't yet achieved the status of a spirit weapon, were driven mad by the impact of the Demon's Sound. Surely the Vermilion Bird spirit wouldn't be inferior to a mere demon spirit?</p><p>A Vermilion Bird spirit that cannot sense the Heavenly Demon's Sound—how many divine birds could it possibly command?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the past. When he was alone, he naturally wouldn't casually mention the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>When summoning experts from various regions to discuss important matters, he either used sound transmission to explain the situation, or there were too many people around, making it impossible to take out the Sun God Tree in front of them.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's hesitation, the Vermilion Bird spirit calmed down its anger and patiently explained: “Don't worry about that. The vital energy within the Qilin Primordial Seed is used to maintain the Qilin true spirit, it's the purest energy in the world. If the Qilin Primordial Seed hadn't already taken root in your body, you could absorb it to strengthen your soul. But since you're already one with it, no matter what you do, it will only accelerate its revival. I'm drawing away the energy to better suppress it, to gradually remove its ‘roots’ from your body…”</p><p>After hearing the explanation, Qin Sang's heart stirred, but his face showed difficulty, his expression indecisive.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit's patience was wearing thin. It angrily shouted: “What are you still worried about! You're so indecisive, how did you even survive this long!”</p><p>“It's not that I don't believe you, senior. I understand your intentions completely, and I'm willing to help you refine the Qilin Primordial Essence, but…”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile.  “When I retrieved that true feather, I was overjoyed, but I didn't know it was you who had done it.  You've been secretly observing me for hundreds of years, every move I've made.  Every time I think about it, I get goosebumps. It's just… it's just…”</p><p>His concern was reasonable.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit put itself in his shoes and its tone softened as it reassured him: “I've been mostly asleep, it's normal that you didn't sense me. Considering you freed me from my prison, as long as you obey me, I won't do anything to harm you.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked surprised. “Senior could enter the Thousand-Jun Ring's subspace and sleep inside?”</p><p>When not using the Sun God Tree, Qin Sang kept it in the Thousand-Jun Ring. This was his biggest question; he had tried before and the ring couldn't store living things.</p><p>Could the Vermilion Bird spirit enter the Thousand-Jun Ring?</p><p>Or were spirit weapons, Vermilion Bird spirits, and such beings special, exempt from the restrictions?</p><p>“This iron ring of yours is rather unusual.”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit controlled the divine bird to look at Qin Sang's right hand.</p><p>On his thumb was a simple, dark iron ring.</p><p>“Once you put me inside, I could attach myself to it, but my perception was of darkness and emptiness, making me drowsy and I fell into a deep sleep.  Later, I realized it didn’t affect me, so I let it be.”</p><p>“Attach itself?”</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, examining the Thousand-Jun Ring.</p><p>This treasure was obtained after killing the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect. Wearing it was discreet, more convenient than a subspace pouch, and its internal space was sufficient.</p><p>Therefore, even after seeing various subspace treasures, Qin Sang had never replaced it.</p><p>This treasure was likely also brought out from the Ziwei Palace by the Kuiyin Patriarch, and it held unknown secrets.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something, his expression turning serious. The Thousand-Jun Ring glowed, revealing a bone flute.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique came from this flute!</p><p>Qin Sang currently only knew the first four layers of *Heavenly Demon Transformation*; beyond that was a mystery, probably due to insufficient cultivation.</p><p>He distinctly remembered the flute had strange properties; it couldn't be stored in other subspace treasures. Others could only carry it, yet it could be placed in the Thousand-Jun Ring!</p><p>It was too coincidental that he could also cultivate the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique from the bone flute with the help of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned ashen, his mood soured. How many things of unknown origin were following him!</p><p>“Senior, can you tell me the origin of this?”</p><p>Qin Sang held the bone flute, revealing it in his open palm.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird spirit wasn't surprised. It calmly said: “I've noticed your bone flute for a while now. Don't worry, it's not sentient; otherwise, if it had attached itself to the Thousand-Jun Ring with me, I would have sensed it. But don't underestimate its origins, I can't even discern the material of this flute.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He examined the bone flute closely, turning it over and over.  The material seemed to be some kind of demonic bone.  Could there even be demonic bones that Zhuque couldn't recognize?</p><p>At this moment, the Zhuque spirit suddenly chuckled, its tone幸灾乐祸 (gleeful). "I wonder what special constitution you possess. There are countless cultivators in the world, yet so many old monsters have chosen you?"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a hidden meaning in its words.  He subtly activated the Tian Yao Transformation.  Giant phoenix wings unfurled behind him, lightning dancing across the feathers, illuminating the cabin.</p><p>The lightning was powerful enough to rival the fiery glow of the Sun God Tree and the True Phoenix Feathers.</p><p>"Senior, are you referring to Qingluan? Could I still have a remnant of Qingluan's spirit within me?" Qin Sang glanced at his wings, his expression calm, almost accustomed to such surprises.</p><p>The Zhuque spirit had one thing wrong.  It wasn't that others chose him, but rather that only he had the fortune – or misfortune – to encounter the Jade Buddha.  Otherwise, he would have been possessed by Qingluan long ago.</p><p>"Mm! Mm!"</p><p>The Sun God Bird nodded repeatedly. "Don't worry, the Qingluan spirit has perished.  Unexpectedly, you're quite capable. How did you manage to absorb it?"</p><p>"I didn't actually do anything, nor did I sense any remnant spirit.  Perhaps Qingluan was already extremely weak, or even already deceased."</p><p>Qin Sang shrugged and continued, "Senior, do you have a way to help me refine the lightning power within my wings?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>The Zhuque spirit's voice was firm, then changed. "That should be a remnant of Qingluan's primordial lightning power, different from the essence of the Qilin Yuanzhong. Moreover, due to the Qingluan remnant spirit's demise, it cannot corrode you like the Qilin Yuanzhong. This power is unclaimed, and is subtly merging with your Qi, becoming yours. Others cannot interfere; the slightest mistake, triggering the lightning's eruption, and you might not survive."</p><p>"Merging with my Qi," Qin Sang questioned, looking at his wings. "Why don't I feel it?"</p><p>He could currently use Qingluan's lightning power for lightning escape techniques, relying on the Qingluan Dharma Image.  He sensed only the wild and untamed power in his phoenix wings, making them impossible to control. He dared not attempt to use them rashly.</p><p>"Either your cultivation is insufficient, or you lack the method. You can only comprehend it yourself. However, if you can refine and absorb the lightning power, even if you only gain control, the benefits are countless. If you weren't so promising, this Zhuque wouldn't have taken an interest in you," the nine Sun God Birds proudly raised their heads at Qin Sang.</p><p>So many secrets hidden within him.</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue inwardly, not bothering to argue. He retracted his wings, pondered for a moment, and said, "I can agree to your third and fourth conditions and swear an oath. As for the previous conditions, I'd like to request two things of you before I can feel at ease. Rest assured, Senior, these won't hinder you in any way..."</p><p>After hearing his detailed explanation, the Zhuque spirit remained noncommittal. "Swear your oath first."</p><p>Qin Sang immediately swore an oath by his heart demon, promising to wholeheartedly assist the Zhuque spirit in finding the Qilin Yuanzhong.  Until the Qilin Yuanzhong was found, he would not leave the Zhuque spirit's sight, and the Zhuque spirit would not harm him.</p><p>The Qilin Yuanzhong was like a mirage, obtaining it was another matter entirely.</p><p>As for how it would be divided later, it would depend on their respective abilities.</p><p>After he made his oath, the Zhuque spirit, without suspicion, made its own promise. "Let me first comprehend and tame that feather. If your secret technique doesn't reject this fire, I can share a strand with you."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior. The stronger I become, the more I can help you," Qin Sang smiled.</p><p>With the Zhuque spirit's assistance, refining the True Phoenix Fire would be much easier.</p><p>"Senior, can you tell me how to absorb the essence of the Qilin Yuanzhong?  Only after confirming that this method won't harm me can I fully trust you and let you proceed."</p><p>The Zhuque spirit hummed lightly, reluctant.</p><p>However, it had determined that the Qilin Yuanzhong had already taken root within Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang only knew how to absorb the essence; he didn't know how to reverse the situation, subdue the Qilin spirit.  It was a dead end, leaving him no choice but to seek its help.</p><p>Therefore, the Zhuque spirit finally agreed to teach Qin Sang the method first to reassure him.</p><p>Qin Sang received the secret technique, closed his eyes, and immersed himself in its study.</p><p>This technique was different from any he had practiced before, but it didn't hinder his judgment; it was indeed ingenious and profoundly mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang felt incredibly amazed. After only one reading, he gained a great deal. He secretly marveled at the wonders of the world.</p><p>He had only seen the tip of the iceberg of various divine abilities and secret techniques.</p><p>The Zhuque spirit was already impatient and sharply cried out, "Offer up the feather!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, stared at the Sun God Tree, and a strange smile curved his lips. The Qianjun Ring glowed, releasing a small box. Inside was a transparent lotus seed.</p><p>"Senior, is this what you call the Qilin Yuanzhong?"</p><p>A long silence followed.</p><p>A piercing scream suddenly echoed in the cabin.</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>(End)</p>
