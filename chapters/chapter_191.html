Request for votes!)</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, and his brows tightly knitted together.</p><p>He did not try to hide it; he plainly showed it to the Le sisters, as the price was truly somewhat high.</p><p>Among rogue cultivators, even Qi Cultivating Stage cultivators would be overjoyed should they stumble upon a spirit vein with abundant spiritual energy. Whether it had a spirit eye was completely up to luck, and spirit springs were even more elusive.</p><p>Only powerful sects like Mount Shaohua, which occupied the greatest spirit vein, had the ability to bestow upon most of their Qi Cultivating Stage disciples cave dwellings that were comparable to spirit eyes.</p><p>The only reason Qin Sang had been able to trade those few Dharma artifacts for a spirit eye cave dwelling was that the White Cat had been eager to go to Heavenly Demon Mound to seek the Dao. As it did not trust humans, it had no other options, and the Esoteric Concealing Technique was a secret technique that could help it preserve its life.</p><p>One had to admit that the Le sisters were being somewhat delusional in attempting to exchange a mere dried-up spirit spring item for a spirit eye cave dwelling.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was determined to obtain the spirit spring item, thus he started to ponder internally after the Le sisters had stated their conditions.</p><p>He did know of two genuine spirit eye cave dwellings.</p><p>One was located on the same island as the spirit stone mine. It was originally occupied by a Qi Cultivating Stage cultivator, but it was now occupied by Shen Youdao.</p><p>With the spirit stones being depleted, the spirit vein and the spirit eye would gradually dry up. However, this would not happen quickly; it would take at least a century.</p><p>Even so, that spirit vein had nearly been destroyed by Shen Youdao and his companions, which would inevitably greatly increase the speed at which the spirit eye dried up.</p><p>Furthermore, even a nearly dried-up spirit stone mine was something that he could not afford. Those large and small secondary veins that extended underground would yield an astounding number of Spirit Stones if they were slowly extracted. He could not possibly become a miner, and mining Spirit Stones was difficult and involved many techniques. It was not something that a high cultivation level could accomplish.</p><p>He could apply to become the person in charge, but his sect definitely would not agree to him transferring the cave dwelling to an outsider.</p><p>The other one was the Heavenly Corpse Sect's sub-altar in the Grotto-heavens.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not have to think to know that it was impossible. If it was just an ordinary spirit eye cave dwelling, it would be one thing, but those three naturally formed spirit eyes were gathered together, making it somewhat inferior to genuine spirit spring, yet still enough to make people covet it.</p><p>After he and Senior Apprentice-brother Yu had reported the information to the sect, news of the Grotto-heavens would definitely have spread.</p><p>Although it was rather far away, the allure of a "spirit spring cave dwelling" could make people completely ignore such a distance; if they had already given it up, they should not expect to get it back.</p><p>Thus, upon leaving the Elders' Peak, Qin Sang did not ask, and Senior Apprentice-brother Chu did not mention it.</p><p>However, since this was a trade, stating conditions was nothing more than a way to haggle.</p><p>The Le sisters' cultivation levels were only at the 11th Qi Condensing Stage, thus a spirit vein with abundant spiritual energy would be sufficient to support their cultivation. They should have that as their bottom line.</p><p>He did not know what kind of place White Cloud Hermit's White Cloud Island was. If he did not have any friends who were extremely powerful, then he could forcibly seize it.</p><p>Having thought of this, Qin Sang said, "Fellow Daoist Le, I have yet to see the spirit spring item in your hands. Would you be willing to let me feast my eyes upon it?"</p><p>Le Xing nodded. "That's only proper."</p><p>As she spoke, she lightly swiped her Storage Bag, then a dried-up root appeared in her palm, which she generously handed to Qin Sang for inspection.</p><p>The root was the size of two human heads. Its roots were gnarled and covered in a strange luster that resembled ore. This was caused by it being washed over by spirit spring, and it was exactly as described in ancient books.</p><p>Qin Sang handed the root back. After some thought, he said, "Dried-up spirit spring items are rare, but not invaluable. Fellow Daoist Le, your price is a bit too high. I dare say that even if you asked everyone in all four Trading Cities, not a single person would agree to this price. How about this? Mount Shaohua has spirit beasts that can search for spirit veins. I will pay Spirit Stones to borrow them and lend them to you for a year. The Unruffled Expanse is vast and boundless, and its spirit veins crisscross. Perhaps you might truly find a spirit eye."</p><p>The Le sisters did not immediately agree or refuse. The two looked at each other and said, "Can the seniors allow us sisters to confer for a moment?"</p><p>Qin Sang motioned to them to do as they pleased.</p><p>Nurse Jing pointed to the main hall ahead and indifferently said, "There is a soundproofing restriction in the main hall. You can go there."</p><p>"Many thanks for the seniors' consideration."</p><p>Le Xing pulled Le Rou and quickly walked to the main hall. After setting up a soundproofing restriction, Le Rou complained rather resentfully, "The Unruffled Expanse is not only filled with countless妖兽, but there are also many evildoers just waiting for a chance to kill and steal. If we parade around with a spirit beast, we'll be dead before we even know it. I don't think he has any sincerity at all!"</p><p>"Alright</p><p>Le Xing pulled at her. "The spirit beasts kept by Shaohua Mountain shouldn't be too bad, and the price to hire one for a year definitely would not be low. Senior Qin's sincerity is not insignificant."</p><p>Le Rou opened her eyes wide. "You wouldn't want to just sell the tree root, would you?"</p><p>A thoughtful look appeared on Le Xing's face. "We definitely should sell it! This tree root has been passed down through generations, for a few hundred years, but it hasn't produced a single drop of spring water, which means the legend is true: after the spiritual spring runs out, it cannot be recovered. But we definitely can't sell it so cheaply. I think we should do as we discussed before we came here."</p><p>Le Rou's dark eyebrows knitted together. "We still don't know what kind of person he is. If there really is a Spirit Eye Cavern in there, Lady Jing might not be able to intimidate him. Will it..."</p><p>"That shouldn't happen," Le Xing said pensively. "Senior Qin is right. The spring water spirit object is rare, but it's not the ultimate treasure. My parents wanted to sell it before, but because the price was too high, no one wanted it. I deliberately mentioned the Spirit Eye Cavern, and he didn't explode in anger and denounce us. Instead, it seemed as though he was carefully considering it. This shows that first, he really does want to buy it; second, the Spirit Eye Cavern is not something that he must have. I heard that at Shaohua Mountain, every Foundation Establishment cultivator can get a Spirit Eye; that's how powerful a major sect is..."</p><p>Le Xing sighed enviously. "It's rare for this tree root to fetch such a good price. With Lady Jing acting as a go-between, Senior Qin could be said to be the best candidate. We sisters can only barely scrape by in our cultivation. Even if we had enough money to hire another Foundation Establishment cultivator, they might not be reliable. As long as we can get a good cave dwelling, we'll have hope of reaching Foundation Establishment. If we can't reach Foundation Establishment, we can only watch without being able to enter. What's the point of keeping it?"</p><p>Le Rou thought for a while before reluctantly yielding. "All right..."</p><p>...</p><p>When he saw the Le sisters return, Qin Sang straightened up.</p><p>He listened as Le Xing softly said, "Senior Qin, we can let go of the Spirit Eye Cavern and give you the tree root. We just want to ask Senior Qin to please help us with something..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and kept quiet, looking at Le Xing's eyes and quietly waiting for her to finish speaking.</p><p>Le Xing smiled a little awkwardly and glanced at Lady Jing before saying, "We found an unclaimed cave dwelling; the owner of the cave dwelling has already died, but there's a dangerous enchantment outside the cave. We don't dare to trespass without permission. If Senior Qin can help us break the enchantment, no matter how good or bad the cave dwelling is, we sisters will accept it and definitely give the tree root to Senior Qin."</p>
