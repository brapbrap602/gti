<h1>Chapter 1285: Earth Puppets</h1><p>Chapter 1285: Earth Puppets</p><p>Tianmu Die observed secretly.</p><p>There were no other Yuan Ying cultivators nearby;  Autumn Orchid Fairy was alone.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't attempt to retreat or evade.</p><p>He knew clearly that once his identity was revealed, the Abyss of Sin wouldn't let him slaughter freely. They would either send experts to suppress him or dispatch opponents who could restrain him.</p><p>Autumn Orchid's appearance didn't surprise Qin Sang.</p><p>Besides, it was unclear who would restrain whom.</p><p>Qin Sang had already surpassed expectations by first killing Yue Sanren and then holding off a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator from the Abyss of Sin.  He could focus on Autumn Orchid; the other battles could be left to others.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang raised his arm and suddenly retracted all of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire into his sleeve.</p><p>With the demonic fire gone, Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword again, continuously performing sword techniques.  The sword's aura was erratic, the flying sword pointed at Autumn Orchid Fairy.</p><p>“You are Qin Sang!”</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy said coldly, “Why aren't you using the demonic fire?”</p><p>Qin Sang's Demon Fire Banner was legendary, especially after Elder Ye's self-destruction as a blood demon, making it a terrifying existence to the Abyss of Sin cultivators.</p><p>However, Autumn Orchid Fairy showed no fear, instead wanting to experience the demonic fire's power.</p><p>“To decide the victor instantly would be uninteresting.  Fairy, perhaps you should first find a way to block Qin's flying sword.”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The ebony sword shone brilliantly, splitting into numerous sword lights that appeared in the void, countless points of light all aimed at Autumn Orchid Fairy.  Killing intent was integrated into the sword intent, captivating the mind and subtly sealing this space.</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy also had considerable achievements in swordsmanship, so she felt it more deeply than others, understanding how high Qin Sang's skill was; a trace of seriousness flashed in her eyes.</p><p>No wonder Yue Sanren so easily lost his life after falling into the sword array. With his swordsmanship alone, this person could occupy a place in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy coldly snorted, disdainfully saying, “You killed Yue Sanren without using your stronger Demon Fire Banner, but instead using a sword array.  This shows that you had no confidence in using the Demon Fire Banner to trap and kill Yue Sanren. Either the demonic fire has flaws, or you can't perfectly control it, and there are weaknesses that would allow him to escape.  Now it seems that the Demon Fire Banner's limitations are more than that.  The power of the demonic fire is unparalleled in my experience. You only recently formed your golden core; you probably can't maintain the consumption of such a treasure, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.</p><p>This woman's scheming was extraordinary. Before they even fought, based only on his previous actions, she had easily deduced the weaknesses of the Demon Fire Banner.</p><p>The reason he abandoned the Demon Fire Banner and switched to the ebony sword was precisely this.</p><p>Deploying all eighteen banners was too draining; it was difficult to maintain for long. His previous uses were all during critical moments, when facing strong enemies or in unavoidable life-or-death situations.</p><p>Moreover, controlling the banners made it difficult to focus; now that he was in enemy territory, he naturally needed to reserve some strength, lest he be trapped.</p><p>Using fewer banners was better than relying on his natal spirit sword and Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain silent,</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy became even more certain of her guess.  It was too unbelievable that someone who had just formed their golden core could kill a blood demon's incarnation.  No matter how powerful a magic treasure was, it was still an external object; cultivation was fundamental.</p><p>The Blood Lake battle was ultimately due to the pressure of the situation. If the blood demon incarnation had wanted to escape, he wouldn't have been able to stop it.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy pinched a sword訣 with her jade finger, a ball of yellow light flying from her palm, transforming into a giant Xuanhuang sword in front of her. She grasped it in her hand.</p><p>Her slender fingers tightly held the giant sword's hilt, pointing it diagonally at Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the sword, comparable in size to a door panel, Qin Sang couldn't help but be startled.</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy's petite frame contrasted sharply with the giant sword; held and wielded by her, it had a strange violent beauty.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>Autumn Orchid Fairy's jade arm trembled slightly.</p><p>Intense yellow light erupted from the Xuanhuang sword, but it didn't attack Qin Sang; instead, it sprinkled on the ground beneath her.</p><p>At the same time, Autumn Orchid Fairy's other hand continuously tapped out points of light; they were talismans. The talismans merged with the yellow light, and the ground began to writhe.</p><p>Then, earth puppets jumped out of the ground one after another.</p><p>These earth puppets were tall and had bodies made of stone, with sharp edges and corners. They seemed heavy, but they were surprisingly agile. Each puppet held a stone sword, a replica of the Xuanhuang sword.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The earth puppets raised their swords, resonating with Autumn Orchid Fairy's Xuanhuang sword, emitting a strange wave.</p><p>“Sword array!”</p><p>As a fellow sword cultivator, Qin Sang recognized it immediately.</p><p>The scene reminded him of the puppet sword array he encountered in the Seven Killing Hall. Autumn Orchid Fairy seemed to have combined swordsmanship and talisman techniques, summoning earth puppets to create a unique sword array.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let Autumn Orchid Fairy succeed. He immediately activated his ebony sword, stabbing out swiftly!</p><p>Sword light rained down.</p><p>Qiu Zhi Xianzi stood firm, then unexpectedly plunged her giant yellow sword into the ground.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>The yellow sword light surged into the earthen puppets, imbuing them with a golden aura, dramatically increasing their power.  They whirled, glared at Qin Sang, and unleashed a furious attack.</p><p>The next moment, a thick beam of yellow light slashed towards the ebony sword, while a shimmering sword barrier appeared before Qiu Zhi Xianzi.</p><p>The ebony sword shattered the yellow light, piercing the barrier.  It met immense resistance, as if countless spirit swords were relentlessly assaulting it.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly shifted his sword techniques.</p><p>The ebony sword, incredibly sharp, finally approached Qiu Zhi Xianzi. With a flick of the blade, the surrounding space momentarily dimmed, even the yellow sword's brilliance seemed to wane.</p><p>Just as Qiu Zhi Xianzi appeared about to suffer the same fate as Yue San Ren, she swiftly rotated her giant sword. The earthen puppets seemed to merge with her yellow sword, completing the sword array.</p><p>The two sword masters clashed directly.</p><p>All the earthen puppets, their energies intertwined, moved in perfect coordination, surrounding Qiu Zhi Xianzi.  Qin Sang, despite continually shifting his formations, couldn't harm her.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Qiu Zhi Xianzi was also alarmed.  Though her combined mastery of swordsmanship and talisman techniques, coupled with her higher cultivation level than Qin Sang, meant she wasn't as helpless as Yue San Ren, she couldn't easily overcome the Seven Souls Killing Array. If not for her powerful spiritual sense, she would have suffered greatly.</p><p>This person's swordsmanship must have an extraordinary origin!</p><p>Qiu Zhi Xianzi narrowed her eyes and counterattacked with her yellow sword.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The Xunfeng Array and the Abyss's defensive array fiercely collided, unleashing raging winds and monstrous waves.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qiu Zhi Xianzi fought countless rounds, pushing deep into the heart of the array.</p><p>Their battle lacked dramatic spectacle.</p><p>In the dim void, hidden currents surged, occasionally erupting in bursts of yellow and dark light. It resembled a duel between two expert swordsmen rather than a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>Suddenly, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly gave warning. Qin Sang's expression changed, his thunder wings beat rapidly, and he instantly shifted dozens of meters.</p><p>As Qin Sang moved, the ground below silently undulated.  Four earthen puppets, without warning, leaped from the earth, raising their giant swords. Four beams of light crisscrossed, sealing Qin Sang's escape route, and striking at his position.</p><p>Qiu Zhi Xianzi must have used some technique to conceal the puppets, blending them seamlessly with the rocks, leaving no trace.</p><p>Thankfully, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was vigilant.</p>
