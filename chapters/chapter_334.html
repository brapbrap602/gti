Chapter 327: The Purple Palace


Everyone, like Qin Sang, was afraid of offending the Foundation Establishment cultivator.  They remained glued to their seats, their upper bodies leaning forward, their eyes glued to the sheepskin.
However, the naked eye revealed nothing unusual about the "sheepskin"!
With a Golden Core cultivator present, the cultivators in the hall were extremely curious, anxiously fidgeting, but dared not use their spiritual energy or divine sense to probe it.
"High Commander, what exactly is this?"
A woman in red couldn't help but ask.
Others murmured amongst themselves.
"It looks like a piece of animal hide…"
"Could it be some kind of artifact that hides its brilliance?"
"Isn't it a scroll similar to a jade slip?  Could it contain cultivation techniques left by a powerful cultivator?"
"Perhaps it's a sealed object…"
…
Qin Sang remained silent, carefully observing it. He was almost certain.
This "sheepskin" was identical to the one he possessed—same material, same size, perfectly square, clearly cut from a larger piece!
Qin Sang’s "sheepskin" had been obtained along with the ebony sword and the Yama banner when he first arrived in this world, and he'd tested it more than once.
As soon as he entered the path of cultivation and learned to use spiritual energy and divine sense, he'd experimented on the sheepskin.
Later, after obtaining incantations like the Item Manipulation Spell and the ability to open a dimensional pouch, he tried again, all to no avail.
Later, after entering the Kuiyin Sect, suspecting the Black-robed Fiend might be a Kuiyin Sect disciple, he'd secretly investigated.
At the time, confined to the Yin煞 Abyss and then sent out as an undercover agent, naturally, he found nothing.
After joining Mount Shao Hua, learning the secrets of the Kuiyin Sect from Sun De, Qin Sang guessed that the Black-robed Fiend, like Shi Hong, was a sacrificial victim chosen by a Kuiyin Sect true disciple or Foundation Establishment cultivator.
But on second thought, he doubted he was a Kuiyin Sect disciple.
The Black-robed Fiend's cultivation was low, and his pursuit by Song Hua was terribly tragic. He either didn't have a dimensional pouch or lost it during the battle.
Severely injured, he could only control bandits to help him escape, using demonic magic to consume blood to survive.
Perhaps this person was a wandering cultivator, who obtained the *幽冥经* (Youming Scripture) and the Yama banner from somewhere. Even if he hadn't died by the Shen Shui River, he would have died sooner or later from the Yama's backlash.
Regardless of the Black-robed Fiend's identity, the Kuiyin Sect was destroyed, leaving no trace to investigate, so Qin Sang gave up pursuing it.
Qin Sang had once wondered if the conflict between Song Hua and the Black-robed Fiend was not a righteous-demonic struggle, or a personal feud, but rather because of this sheepskin?
However, investigating Song Hua was also impossible.
When Qin Sang met Song Ying, he obtained a letter left by Song Hua before his departure; it contained no hidden message, and he found no relevant clues in the Wen Yue Market.
So many years later, nobody knows Song Hua's whereabouts.
It eventually became a dead end.
After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage and organizing his dimensional pouch, Qin Sang remembered the "sheepskin" and checked it again, confirming it wasn't due to insufficient cultivation.
Apart from being exceptionally tough, the hide had nothing special about it. It might be the skin of some kind of demonic beast; such inexplicable things abounded in the cultivation world.
The Black-robed Fiend's belongings, the Yama banner and the *幽冥经*, were not valuable in the cultivation world; the sheepskin was probably not worth much either. Qin Sang's later cultivation path became increasingly difficult, leaving him no time for other matters, so he set it aside and ignored it.
If it weren't for the reappearance of the "sheepskin" at this auction, he would have almost forgotten it!
What could the "sheepskin" be?
Qin Sang's thoughts raced, his curiosity piqued, and excitement filled him.
A treasure precious enough to be kept in a wooden box by a Golden Core cultivator and put up for auction, it must be extraordinary!
A fragment of a magic treasure?
A fragment of a cultivation technique?
A treasure map?
Or something else?
However, Qin Sang remained vigilant, pondering why the Foundation Establishment cultivator in the shadows had put the "sheepskin" up for auction, and at this particular auction.


Could it be that the "sheepskin" isn't as valuable as he thought, not a precious item to a Golden Core cultivator?
Or…
A fishing expedition!
Assuming these two "sheepskins" share a common origin, could it be that one needs to gather two, or even more, to reveal their true purpose and value?

Was that Golden Core cultivator hiding in the shadows, observing the cultivators in the hall, to see who recognized the sheepskin?

Qin Sang was startled, his hairs standing on end, a premonition of danger arising in his heart.
Fortunately, he was shrewd, only letting his thoughts race internally, showing nothing outwardly.

As Qin Sang's mind raced, Gao Yi took the sheepskin from the wooden box, raising his arm, and said solemnly, "Fellow cultivators, please be patient. Let's see the full picture of this treasure."

A golden light shot out from the darkness, striking the center of the sheepskin.
Strangely, the seemingly sharp golden light landed on the sheepskin like a stone sinking into the sea, instantly disappearing as if swallowed by the sheepskin, leaving it unchanged.

Just as everyone was puzzled, a faint white light bloomed from the center of the sheepskin, slowly spreading.
On the previously blank sheepskin, a pattern resembling a heavenly gate appeared.  In the center of the gate were three ancient characters, written in a powerful script – Purple Micro Palace!

The three characters "Purple Micro Palace" shone brightly, their strokes as sharp as sword energy, making it hard to look directly at them.
The image on the sheepskin seemed real, with flowing auspicious clouds.
The heavenly gate stood amidst layers of clouds, appearing and disappearing, intricately carved with dragons and phoenixes, ancient and extraordinary.

Sadly, the heavenly gate was severely damaged, with countless cracks and missing parts.  Damage was everywhere; even the carved dragons were half-gone, greatly diminishing their majesty.
One couldn't help but feel that a light touch would cause the gate to collapse.


Purple Micro Palace revealed!

Most cultivators in the hall, even a few who seemed to be late Foundation Establishment stage experts, looked bewildered, while the woman in red and the Daoist priest showed shock.

"Purple Micro Palace!" the woman in red gasped, covering her mouth. "This hide… could it be the Purple Micro Palace Secret Scroll?"

Before she finished, a deep laugh echoed through the hall.
"I didn't expect that among you youngsters, some would know of the existence of the Purple Micro Palace Secret Scroll.
Indeed, the Purple Micro Palace Secret Scroll is the key to entering the Purple Micro Palace.
The Spiritual Tide is approaching, and the Secret Scroll has appeared.
Once the Spiritual Tide arrives, the Purple Micro Palace will open.
Unless one finds the protection of a Nascent Soul ancestor, only those possessing the Secret Scroll will be eligible to enter the Purple Micro Palace.
You youngsters may not feel it yet, but the Lesser Cold Domain is already seething with unrest. The fight for the Secret Scroll is inevitable, and the competition will only intensify."
