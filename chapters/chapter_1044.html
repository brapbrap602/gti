<h1>Chapter 1036: The Unforeseen</h1><p>The underground caverns of the Labyrinthine Caves were incredibly complex, twisting and turning, seemingly endless. Yet, by consistently descending, one could find the hidden chamber.  Internal distractions and external earth spirits guarding the path made the journey perilous.</p><p>In another tunnel within the Labyrinthine Caves, Sunu and her companions were rapidly advancing. This time, Venerable Ye led the way. He seemed even more at ease than Qin Sang had been.</p><p>Having reached Nascent Soul cultivation, Venerable Ye possessed a mental fortitude far surpassing that of Core Formation cultivators.  He could easily block the cave's mental influence without resorting to special techniques or magical treasures. He strolled through the tunnel, his palm raised, fingers splayed like a wheel. He flicked out hair-thin needles of Qi, each one easily piercing the skulls of the earth spirits and exploding within their bodies.</p><p>The power of the Qi needles wasn't devastating, but Venerable Ye's control was masterful, a level unattainable by other Core Formation cultivators. He alone could protect Sunu and the others, allowing them to travel faster than Qin Sang and Ming Wei.</p><p>After an unknown number of earth spirits had been slain, the seemingly endless guardians suddenly vanished. Venerable Ye paused briefly, then continued forward. This was familiar territory for him.  Finally, he and his companions reached the end of the tunnel and entered a vast subterranean chamber.</p><p>The chamber floor was paved with smooth tiles, and an eerie silence filled the air. Thanks to Venerable Ye, they were the first to arrive.</p><p>With the exception of Sunu, the others couldn't hide their excitement as they stared intently at the center of the chamber. Black mist drifted through the chamber, but a faint blue light emanated from the center.</p><p>The source of the light was a hemispherical barrier. Inside, a simple, square stone platform stood bathed in blue light. Four jade bottles rested on the platform, filled with Soul Cleansing Liquid, their surfaces reflecting the blue light even more brightly than the barrier itself.</p><p>"That's the Soul Cleansing Liquid..." the enchanting woman murmured, her eyes fixated on the mesmerizing scene within the barrier. The jade bottles appeared to be the most precious treasures imaginable.</p><p>And indeed they were.  They were all approaching the Nascent Soul bottleneck, a trial so daunting that all cultivators dreaded it.  The Soul Cleansing Liquid offered a glimmer of hope, making it an invaluable treasure for Core Formation cultivators nearing the next stage.</p><p>However, retrieving the Soul Cleansing Liquid presented one final hurdle: breaking the barrier.</p><p>"Wait! Why are there only four bottles?" the elder with the long beard exclaimed, noticing the unusual number.  The Labyrinthine Caves usually yielded around ten bottles when the Seven Kills Hall opened. Why so few this time?</p><p>"Master, this..." the elder asked Venerable Ye, his face etched with confusion.</p><p>Venerable Ye had already noticed the discrepancy. He had witnessed a previous Soul Cleansing Liquid scramble where twelve bottles were available, ultimately divided among the representatives of several major powers.  Now there were only four, not nearly enough to go around.</p><p>"Four bottles! Some have suspected that the Soul Cleansing Liquid isn't naturally occurring, and that the Trial Grounds hold deeper secrets. It seems those suspicions were correct.  The inner hall appeared early, and there's less than half the usual amount of Soul Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>Venerable Ye seemed to have anticipated this possibility.  He snorted coldly, "I had intended to avoid a major conflict with the other powers, but it appears that's no longer an option. Four bottles... enough for each of you. There's no need to share."</p><p>Venerable Ye spoke calmly, as if claiming the Soul Cleansing Liquid was his by right. His disciples, however, were far from relaxed. They harbored a deep unease.</p><p>Outside the Trial Grounds, even a larger group of Blood Bat's followers wouldn't stand a chance against Venerable Ye. But within the Trial Grounds, things were different.</p><p>The long-bearded elder hesitated. "Master, with you personally retrieving the Soul Cleansing Liquid, it should be an easy task.  However, the restrictions within the Trial Grounds force you to seal your cultivation.  Among our rivals are Blood Bat and Daoist Xiaoyun, both formidable Core Formation cultivators. The others are elite disciples of major powers, and there are bound to be opportunists as well.  If we attempt to monopolize the Soul Cleansing Liquid, we'll become everyone's target..."</p><p>Within the Trial Grounds, Venerable Ye was forced to suppress his cultivation and was still recovering from injuries sustained while navigating the Immortal Prohibition.</p><p>Of course, even with his cultivation sealed, Blood Bat and Daoist Xiaoyun were no match for him.  But facing a multitude of enemies, he could be overwhelmed.</p><p>Venerable Ye saw through their concerns.  A faint smile played on his lips. "I cannot unleash my full Nascent Soul power within the Trial Grounds, but with preparation, I can temporarily unleash a single strike at full power.  Retrieving the Soul Cleansing Liquid requires my Nascent Soul cultivation. Otherwise, why would I risk so much to come here?"</p><p>His words brought immense relief to his disciples, dispelling all their doubts.  Even a single strike would be enough.</p><p>Venerable Ye surveyed the chamber.  "Earth spirits guard the Soul Cleansing Liquid. They're not weak.  We must hold them off while attacking the barrier until the seal breaks.  I'll seize the Soul Cleansing Liquid when the opportunity arises. Be ready to assist me and retreat with me into the tunnels. Once inside, it will be much harder for them to pursue us."</p><p>"Yes, Master!" his disciples responded, their spirits soaring.  After all, they were fighting for their own future.</p><p>"Before that, focus on self-preservation. How well have you mastered the formation flags I gave you?" Venerable Ye inquired.</p><p>"Master, I can unleash about seventy percent of the formation's power!" the long-bearded elder replied, as did the others, each holding a formation flag.</p><p>Venerable Ye nodded and gave them further instructions.</p><p>Just then, footsteps echoed from another tunnel. Several figures emerged, their features obscured by the black mist.  However, a streak of blood-red light stood out.</p><p>"Blood Bat is here! Those with him must be his demonic cultivators!" the long-bearded elder warned through voice transmission.</p><p>After Blood Bat's arrival, more footsteps and sounds of movement echoed from other tunnels. Cultivators from various factions began to emerge, filling the chamber.</p><p>The most elite disciples of various powers had gathered.</p><p>"What! Only four portions?!" someone exclaimed upon seeing the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Others noticed the anomaly as well, their expressions grim. Tension filled the chamber. They could sense the impending, fierce struggle.</p>
