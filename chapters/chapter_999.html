<h1>Chapter 991: Scales</h1><p>“The little guy has spirit. He’ll definitely achieve great things in the future,” Bai commented, watching the two-headed creature.</p><p>“Indeed, it’s quite rare,” Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>妖兽 who had consumed Emperor’s Flowing Liquid and awakened their intelligence might not have the same temperament as the two-headed creature. It was pure luck that they encountered it when it was injured.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked away and set off.</p><p>The two-headed creature would lure away Mu Lao Mo, while he would go east to find Yuan Zhu.</p><p>…</p><p>A bloody light streaked across the sky, pausing periodically before speeding off again.</p><p>Mu Lao Mo pursued relentlessly, drawing ever closer to his target.</p><p>But his face showed little joy; he felt an inexplicable unease.  The previous misleading had made him question the fire curse. He wouldn't rest easy until he saw the prey with his own eyes.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Winter Nether Flame surged, veering towards the front.</p><p>Despite this, Mu Lao Mo spat out a mouthful of essence blood, using its power to fully activate the fire curse and confirm the direction. Even with his high cultivation, this was proving strenuous.</p><p>His blood escape technique also consumed essence blood.</p><p>Mu Lao Mo’s face was ashen, pale and bloodless. To capture his prey quickly and avoid unforeseen complications, he pushed himself to the limit.</p><p>Afterwards, he would need a long period of rest to recover.</p><p>After breaking through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, his reputation was renowned in the cultivation world. Even the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi treated him with respect. He rarely found himself in such a sorry state.</p><p>Especially since he had the upper hand, and his opponent was merely a mere Core Formation cultivator.</p><p>Mu Lao Mo let out a sigh of frustration, about to retract the fire curse, when his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>The Winter Flame, which had been tilting south, shuddered, then abruptly veered towards the northeast, then back to the south, then east, swaying erratically right before Mu Lao Mo's eyes.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mu Lao Mo’s vision blurred; he almost cursed aloud.</p><p>His worst fears had been realized.</p><p>That was likely another decoy!</p><p>His prey clearly understood curses, and their methods grew more sophisticated each time. Before, they only masked part of the fluctuations; now, they could perfectly shield their presence even under his full-powered fire curse.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Mu Lao Mo’s gaze sharpened.</p><p>He was furious, but remained calm.</p><p>Which was real, east or south?</p><p>Was the front decoy indeed a decoy?</p><p>His prey was cunning. What if they had changed tactics, and the east was the decoy, luring him away?  He would be too late to react once he realized it.</p><p>Mu Lao Mo's expression shifted, and after a moment's thought, he suddenly shot a blast of Winter Flame downwards.</p><p>The sea froze, and Mu Lao Mo sat cross-legged on the ice, his eyes closed.  After a long while, the Winter Flame before him ceased its wavering and tilted towards the northeast.</p><p>As expected, the earlier one was a decoy.</p><p>Seeing the direction his prey was fleeing, Mu Lao Mo instantly guessed their intention—to use the chaotic spiritual energy of the storm belt to escape his pursuit!</p><p>Mu Lao Mo knew that once his prey escaped into the storm belt, the fire curse’s fluctuations would be affected.</p><p>Though his prey might perish in the storm belt, he didn't want its life, but the demonic fire within it!</p><p>Mu Lao Mo’s face changed slightly; he stood up abruptly, transforming into a bloody shadow and breaking through the air.</p><p>In the distance…</p><p>The two-headed creature…</p><p>It held a top-grade spirit stone in its mouth, absorbing its energy—a gift from Qin Sang, along with a nautical chart of the Canglang Sea.</p><p>The two-headed creature turned its head, its demonic eyes flashing as it sensed its great enemy moving away.</p><p>It shook its head, concealed its presence, and stealthily departed in the opposite direction.</p><p>Its steps were light.</p><p>…</p><p>“The two-headed creature, after reaching the late Core Formation stage, its wind escape technique is much faster than its external avatar.  It managed to lure Mu Lao Mo so far away, all the way until Bai was exhausted…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Bai had exerted himself to the limit, persevering until exhaustion before returning to recuperate.</p><p>Fortunately, the time they bought was enough for Qin Sang to escape into the storm belt.</p><p>Another long chase ensued.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang couldn’t seal the fire curse; he could only flee blindly. He held the jade bottle tightly, ready to consume the Three Lights Jade Liquid—he'd already taken the second drop.</p><p>…</p><p>On an unnamed small island.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The island trembled, a bloody shadow descending from the sky.</p><p>Mu Lao Mo appeared, his face livid.</p><p>His continuous blood escape had taken a heavy toll; he couldn’t sustain it and had to stop to recover.</p><p>The prey, surprisingly vigorous and tireless, continued its relentless escape, its vital energy astonishingly abundant.</p><p>Old Man Mou knew instantly that the prey must possess a top-grade elixir capable of replenishing vital energy.</p><p>He quickly set up a complex array, sat cross-legged within it, and swallowed various pills in one go, closing his eyes tightly to hasten his recovery.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Old Man Mou had stopped, but felt little joy.</p><p>Shaking off Old Man Mou was only temporary; the crisis was far from over.  He would inevitably be pursued, so he had to reach the heart of the storm zone.</p><p>Out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p><p>Qin Sang was well aware of the dangers within the storm zone's depths.  They were likely even more perilous than the spiritual tide during the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, a hazard even Nascent Soul Masters feared.</p><p>Still, at least there, he could die a swift death.</p><p>Lost in thought, he flew on.</p><p>A black curtain suddenly appeared on the horizon. Qin Sang's spirits lifted; he had finally reached the storm zone!</p><p>The heavens roared.</p><p>Waves crashed.</p><p>The storm zone’s scenery was monotonous: endless, identical hurricanes and waves.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived near Yuan Zhu's cave.</p><p>Looking around, he saw only the same repetitive landscape; the cave was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the scale Yuan Zhu had given him from his spatial ring.  After infusing it with vital energy, the scale emitted a faint glow, activating the restriction.</p><p>"Hurry! Hurry!"</p><p>Qin Sang was frantic, for Old Man Mou was catching up, rapidly closing the distance.  He was running out of time.</p><p>He was anxious, hoping Yuan Zhu hadn't left his cave.</p><p>At that moment, faint white lights emerged from the waves.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped, but Yuan Zhu remained hidden.</p><p>An idea struck him.  He patiently waited.</p><p>The white lights drifted, then suddenly, a column of light shot from the sea, accompanied by Yuan Zhu's hearty laughter.  "Haha, you're back so soon! Did you miss me?  Oh…"</p><p>At that precise moment, the fire curse flared up again.</p><p>Fire curse runes appeared vividly on Qin Sang's body.</p><p>A phantom materialized before him—Yuan Zhu's spectral form.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's condition, he asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "I've been framed and cursed with a fire curse, pursued by a powerful enemy.  I've come to you, Yuan Daoist, for help.  I beg you to assist me!"</p>
