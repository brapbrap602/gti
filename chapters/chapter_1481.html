<h1></h1><p>In the world of immortal cultivation, top-tier experts generally avoid forming grudges unless they can eliminate their opponent on the spot, leaving no future troubles, or unless it involves immense interests that cannot be shared with others. Even if misunderstandings arise, as long as it doesn’t escalate to a life-and-death situation, the best course of action is to find a way to resolve the conflict. At worst, they can simply avoid each other in the future. </p><p>The fact that the Demonic Elder couldn’t control Qin Sang and instead sent someone with a formal invitation to turn hostility into friendship was entirely reasonable. However, Qin Sang was well aware of the old demon’s cunning and unscrupulous nature. The Demonic Elder’s actions couldn’t be judged by ordinary logic. Assuming the contents of the invitation reflected the Demonic Elder’s true intentions—actively seeking peace—it certainly wasn’t out of genuine remorse. Qin Sang suspected it had something to do with that so-called "heavenly opportunity."</p><p>The Demonic Elder was clearly looking for allies—or perhaps cannon fodder. In this era, there were few things that could make the Demonic Elder act so cautiously, and this matter indeed held significant allure for Qin Sang. However, whether this opportunity was truly beneficial or not remained debatable. The fact that the Demonic Elder himself wasn’t confident suggested that it wouldn’t be easy to achieve.</p><p>Qin Sang had personally witnessed the Demonic Elder visiting the Great Sage Tianpeng, which likely wasn’t a coincidence. It was probably related to this matter, as the Demonic Elder was seeking another ally. With the Great Sage Tianpeng, the Demonic Elder, and himself, there were already three late-stage Nascent Soul-level experts involved. This indicated that the endeavor carried immense risks.</p><p>Another possibility was that the Demonic Elder was using this as bait to lure Qin Sang out. Perhaps the Demonic Elder and the Great Sage Tianpeng were secretly colluding to set a trap and ambush him. However, such a plan seemed overly elaborate. Qin Sang’s appearance was entirely beyond the Demonic Elder’s control, and the Great Sage Tianpeng couldn’t afford to wait indefinitely with the Demonic Elder. Moreover, if the Demonic Elder truly harbored such intentions, the invitation would have been filled with extravagant promises rather than being so ambiguous.</p><p>What truly raised Qin Sang’s suspicions was the Demonic Elder’s mention of a "common enemy." His transaction with Tong Lingyu involved a sacred artifact, and the Profound Heaven Palace wouldn’t willingly disclose such information, as it would damage their reputation. Later, Qin Sang had joined the Listening Snow Pavilion under a different identity. The Demonic Elder likely didn’t know that Qin Sang had already resolved his misunderstanding with the Profound Heaven Palace and had even become a guest elder.</p><p>On the other hand, Qin Sang was fully aware of the dealings between the Demonic Elder and the Profound Heaven Palace. The old demon had collaborated with the Profound Heaven Palace to stage a grand spectacle, deceiving the world and accelerating the convening of the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly. This didn’t seem like the behavior of someone with a grudge. Unless something had happened during Qin Sang’s travels in recent years that caused a falling out between the two parties. This could also explain why the Demonic Elder hadn’t invited the Profound Heaven Palace’s sect master or the grand elder. </p><p>Well, perhaps he had invited them, but given the Profound Heaven Palace’s formidable strength and the Demonic Elder’s relative weakness, he needed to find other allies to counterbalance the Profound Heaven Palace. The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. It would be best to wait until he returned to the Profound Heaven Palace and consulted Tong Lingyu before making a decision.</p><p>Additionally, while the likelihood of the Demonic Elder ambushing him was low, it wasn’t something Qin Sang could entirely dismiss. He wasn’t planning to meet the Demonic Elder anytime soon. Although Qin Sang no longer feared the Demonic Elder as he once did, he wasn’t willing to casually reveal the Sun God Tree, using such a treasure merely for combat. The Sun God Bird’s power was immense, but its timing had to be precise. If the opponent was prepared, the chances of failure increased significantly. Qin Sang was waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, to give the Demonic Elder a surprise.</p><p>Having quickly weighed the pros and cons, Qin Sang looked up at the black-robed youth and said indifferently, "You may leave. Tell the Demonic Elder to stop spying on the Hundred Flowers Valley in the future."</p><p>"Yes!" The black-robed youth bowed and immediately exited the hall. Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied his attendance, but the youth didn’t dare to ask further. The fact that Qin Sang had accepted the invitation spoke volumes. Before leaving, his master hadn’t demanded a definitive answer.</p><p>After the black-robed youth left, the banquet concluded hastily. Qin Sang remained in the Hundred Flowers Valley, studying insect control techniques with Valley Master Mu. The Hundred Flowers Valley had a long-standing tradition rooted in insect control, with successive generations of ancestors collecting various insect control methods from across the world, not limited to the Witch Clan’s innate insect gu techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang absorbed these insights voraciously, gaining immense knowledge. Previously, he had been clueless about how to nurture spirit insects after their fourth transformation. With these new insights and the texts he had seen at the Beast Taming Sect, he began to piece together a clearer understanding. While he still didn’t have a definitive method, he was gradually forming ideas about what types of spiritual materials to seek for different spirit insects, which would reduce the scope of trial and error in the future.</p><p>During this process, Valley Master Mu also discovered that Qin Sang’s foundation in insect control wasn’t as shallow as he had initially thought. Qin Sang was truly a kindred spirit. In a moment of enthusiasm, Valley Master Mu asked Qin Sang for his thoughts on the Hundred Flowers Valley’s legacy. Earlier, he had already passed on the pre-Nascent Soul portions to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for this opportunity and didn’t hold back. He began a lengthy discourse. After all, he had inherited genuine Witch Clan secret techniques. His explanations left Valley Master Mu feeling as if a veil had been lifted, and even some long-standing problems that had plagued Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators for years were resolved.</p><p>Valley Master Mu was astonished and, after careful consideration, asked Qin Sang to swear an oath before revealing the complete legacy. This was exactly what Qin Sang wanted. In the Canglang Sea, due to his limited cultivation level, he had only obtained the portions of the innate insect gu techniques up to the fourth transformation. This had caused the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s progress to slow significantly after breaking through to the fourth transformation. Now that he couldn’t return to the Canglang Sea, he hoped the Hundred Flowers Valley’s legacy would provide some inspiration.</p><p>"The founder obtained an incomplete legacy," Valley Master Mu sighed. "For generations, the cultivation of innate spirit insects in the Hundred Flowers Valley has mostly stagnated at the early stages of the fourth transformation. Even in exceptional cases, it was due to some unique opportunity that couldn’t be replicated. The most troublesome part is that as the innate spirit insect’s cultivation increases, it begins to show signs of resisting its master..."</p><p>Qin Sang understood that this legacy wasn’t just incomplete—it was fundamentally flawed. The Witch Clan, blessed by heaven, could tame innate insect gu. Qin Sang, with the help of the Jade Buddha, was immune to backlash, but other human cultivators lacked such means. The Ghost Mother had modified the Witch Clan’s legacy, using other methods to circumvent the hidden dangers. However, it now seemed there were limits to this approach. The path of the Hundred Flowers Valley cultivators was destined to be a dead end. It was unclear whether the Ghost Mother was powerless to change this or simply hadn’t put in enough effort.</p><p>The portions of the Hundred Flowers Valley’s legacy concerning spirit insects after the fourth transformation were sparse. These contents confirmed one of Qin Sang’s suspicions: innate insect gu indeed underwent changes after the Nascent Soul stage. Simply nurturing them with essence blood had limited effects, which explained why the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s progress had been so slow. Unfortunately, these methods were tailored by the Ghost Mother to suit the Hundred Flowers Valley and weren’t suitable for Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Qin Sang couldn’t fully adopt them but could draw some inspiration.</p><p>To obtain the complete legacy, he would need to find the Ghost Mother. All questions ultimately led back to this point.</p><p>Three months later, Qin Sang bid farewell. Valley Master Mu personally escorted him for a hundred miles, reluctant to see him go. This exchange had been mutually beneficial. Qin Sang not only gained many insights but also obtained several formulas and spiritual medicines for nurturing the Fire Jade Centipede from the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>After parting with Valley Master Mu, Qin Sang continued south, traversing the Crescent Moon Realm until he reached its southernmost point, then turned east. The Boundless Sea was vast but barren. Qin Sang selected a few islands occupied by renowned old monsters, approached them cautiously, and left swiftly if the sword spirit showed no reaction.</p><p>As he sped along his journey, Qin Sang returned to the Ghost Mother’s cave abode and met Tan Hao. Over the past few days, Tan Hao had been preparing to go into seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage. When it came to forming a Nascent Soul, others could offer little assistance. Qin Sang only shared some of his own experiences, avoiding fundamental principles to prevent misleading Tan Hao.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang left the cave and set off once more.</p><p>...</p><p>In the Hidden Sun Realm, spring had returned, and the ice and snow had melted. The once snow-capped mountains now showed hints of green. Mortals seized this most precious time of the year to venture out and tend to their fields. At this moment, the Hidden Sun Realm finally showed signs of life.</p><p>Under a cloudless sky, Qin Sang concealed his aura and flew on his sword. Seeing the Hidden Sun Realm’s transformed scenery, he murmured to himself, "Eight years..."</p><p>In those eight years, Qin Sang had only stayed briefly at Tianpeng Mountain and the Hundred Flowers Valley. The rest of the time, he had been constantly on the move, covered in dust. Worried about missing the Profound Heaven Palace’s sacred land, he had hurried along his journey. The key issue was that he hadn’t found any clues. While his body didn’t feel tired, his spirit was growing weary.</p><p>In another year, the Ice Demon Crystal would recover. Qin Sang decided to return to the Listening Snow Pavilion first.</p><p>Along the way, he rarely saw any cultivators. During his travels, Qin Sang had heard some news. It was said that the Profound Heaven Palace and the demon race had fought several fierce battles, with the Profound Heaven Palace slightly at a disadvantage. However, they had only lost some outer sea territories, and their mainland remained unaffected. Strangely, even during the most intense moments of the conflict, there had been no news of the Profound Heaven Palace’s sect master taking action.</p><p>Now, the two sides were at a stalemate. The Great Sage Tianpeng seemed to have realized that quickly defeating the Profound Heaven Palace was impossible and had become less aggressive compared to eight years ago. With the sacred land about to open, the Profound Heaven Palace naturally wouldn’t take the initiative to attack, and the situation had stabilized.</p><p>Before long, the Listening Snow Pavilion came into view. Qin Sang activated his guest elder’s token, passed through the mountain’s protective formation without alerting anyone, and headed straight for his cave to rest for a few days.</p><p>As he activated the token, on the main peak, Shi Xue sensed his presence and awoke from meditation.</p><p>"He’s finally back!" Shi Xue confirmed it was Qin Sang and breathed a sigh of relief. She quickly rose and pushed open the door.</p><p>Qin Sang had been gone for eight years without a word. While there were few beings in the world who could threaten him, accidents could still happen. Shi Xue hurried across the jade bridge and entered the valley where the Drifting Snow Pavilion was located. She sent out a streak of light, and with a creak, the wooden door opened.</p><p>Shi Xue entered and saw Liuli sitting cross-legged on the cold jade bed. Over the years, Liuli had rarely left the Drifting Snow Pavilion, spending most of her time with the cold jade bed. At this moment, Liuli’s eyes were closed, and she remained motionless. Although there were no visible phenomena in the Drifting Snow Pavilion, Shi Xue could sense a subtle yet powerful fluctuation around Liuli.</p><p>Shi Xue watched quietly until the fluctuation gradually subsided, then called out, "Junior Sister."</p><p>Liuli opened her eyes, her gaze regaining its clarity. Her voice remained cool as she asked, "Senior Sister, has he returned?"</p><p>"He just returned to his cave. I haven’t gone to see him yet," Shi Xue nodded, then hesitated. "Junior Sister, have you made your decision?"</p><p>Liuli calmly finished her cultivation, her voice steady. "This matter can only be done by him."</p><p>"Should I wait and test his intentions first?" Shi Xue asked with a hint of reluctance.</p><p>Liuli straightened her robes, stood up, and stepped down from the cold jade bed. She shook her head gently. "This is my own matter. There’s no need to trouble Senior Sister."</p><p>"You’re my junior sister, and this concerns our Listening Snow Pavilion. How can it not involve me?" Shi Xue frowned, her expression conflicted. "Junior Sister, why are you unwilling to dual cultivate with him, yet you’ve agreed to this matter?"</p><p>"It’s different," Liuli said, looking out at the vast world beyond the Drifting Snow Pavilion. After a long silence, she spoke in a calm tone.</p><p>"How is it different? To outsiders, what’s the distinction?" Shi Xue pressed.</p><p>"Why should we care about outsiders’ opinions?" Liuli retracted her gaze and gave Shi Xue a puzzled look.</p><p>Shi Xue lowered her head and sighed. "Fine, I won’t interfere in your affairs anymore. You two can handle it yourselves! I don’t want to end up causing trouble like last time."</p><p>As they spoke, the two sisters left the Drifting Snow Pavilion and walked along the snow-covered path toward Qin Sang’s cave. Liuli’s expression remained calm, but Shi Xue, following behind, couldn’t hide the worry in her eyes.</p><p>Soon, the two women arrived at the small building. Qin Sang, having sensed their approach, deactivated the formation and personally came out to greet them. He bowed slightly. "Sect Master Shi, Fairy Liuli, it’s been a while. I had planned to freshen up before visiting you both. My apologies for the lack of courtesy."</p><p>As he spoke, he subtly observed Liuli. She wasn’t deliberately concealing her aura, and Qin Sang could easily tell that her cultivation was still at the early Nascent Soul stage. This confirmed that her previous breakthrough attempt had completely failed. Was the mark of the "Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron True Scripture" truly so difficult to deal with? Qin Sang frowned slightly. With Liuli’s exceptional talent and the Profound Heaven Palace’s vast resources, how could they not resolve this?</p><p>"It’s us who have intruded, disturbing your peace," the two women returned the greeting.</p><p>Shi Xue also observed Qin Sang discreetly. "Daoist Qin, how was your journey to the North Sea? Did everything go smoothly?"</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for them to enter the cave and personally brewed a pot of spiritual tea. "There were some twists and turns, but nothing too dangerous. This tea was a fortunate discovery during my travels in the demon realm. It may not compare to the Listening Snow Pavilion’s immortal tea, but it has its own unique flavor. Please, give it a try."</p><p>Shi Xue took a sip and immediately felt a refreshing aroma fill her mouth. She praised, "Excellent tea! I never expected Daoist Qin to move through the demon realm as if it were his own backyard. I was worried you might be discovered by a demon king and face danger."</p><p>"Just some minor tricks, nothing worth mentioning," Qin Sang replied with a faint smile. "By the way, did the information I provided prove useful to the Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded. "The grand elder has mentioned multiple times in public that we must properly reward Daoist Qin. You were the only one willing to venture deep into the demon realm to gather intelligence. With this information, we were able to estimate the demon race’s approximate strength and plan our defenses accordingly, avoiding unnecessary casualties. After announcing your status as a guest elder, the Listening Snow Pavilion’s situation has also improved."</p><p>"I’m glad it didn’t backfire," Qin Sang nodded, then asked about the matter he was most concerned about. "The sacred land should be opening soon, right?"</p><p>"All the branches have been eagerly waiting. Once the sacred artifact has absorbed enough energy, the sacred land will open. The grand elder has already proposed that you participate..." At this point, Shi Xue’s tone hesitated slightly, and she glanced at Liuli, who was quietly sipping her tea.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up his teacup, took a sip, and used the rising steam to discreetly observe the two women. He keenly sensed that Shi Xue had been holding something back since her arrival. It was likely related to Liuli—or more precisely, to Liuli’s cultivation and the mark of the sinister technique. However, Liuli’s expression gave nothing away.</p>
