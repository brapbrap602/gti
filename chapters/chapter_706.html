<h1>Chapter 698: Fusion</h1><p>“My friend is right.  The Thousand Demon Sea is irrevocably changed.  It's difficult to restore its former tranquility.  While dangerous, it holds treasures found nowhere else.  A great pity,” </p><p>a scholar in a green robe echoed, expressing his regret.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, surveying the surroundings.  “My conditions have been stated.  Which of you possesses what I seek and wishes to trade?”</p><p>He looked at each person in turn, but received no response.  Disappointment washed over him.</p><p>Then, an elderly man, seemingly from a trading house, after whispering with his companions, spoke.  “The items you desire are all exceedingly rare.  Even with all my efforts, I can only guarantee finding one – the Soul-Guiding Grass.  If you’re interested, I’ll forgo the妖丹 and magical treasures; I wish to propose a different transaction.”</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Grass was an unexpected boon.</p><p>Qin Sang was intrigued.  “What transaction do you propose, friend?”</p><p>The old man mused, “Your ability to offer so many妖丹 speaks volumes about your strength. I wish to invite you to join our organization.  Things would be much easier as one of us. I can petition the Inner Sea; obtaining one or two Soul-Guiding Grasses is no problem.  Even other rare items aren’t impossible.”</p><p>The old man then secretly revealed his affiliation to Qin Sang – a renowned large trading house.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, amused to be recruited again on Huntian Island.</p><p>Judging by the man's tone, his organization was even larger than the Qiongyu Trading House, but Qin Sang had no interest in becoming subservient, certainly not for the Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>“If the Soul-Guiding Grass is in the Inner Sea, how long will it take to obtain it?”</p><p>A hint of awkwardness appeared on the old man's face.  “The sea routes are currently unsafe; it will likely have to wait until the conflict between the two factions concludes… But don't worry, we can draw up a contract. Furthermore, joining our trading house won't burden you with excessive responsibilities, but offers numerous benefits others only dream of…”</p><p>No matter how the old man tempted him, Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Since the old man couldn't persuade Qin Sang, no one else bothered.</p><p>Silence fell over the hall.</p><p>Seeing there was no hope, Qin Sang sighed, saying helplessly, “My friends, if any of you have medicinal pills suitable for Nascent Soul cultivators, you may offer them in exchange.”</p><p>Now, many were willing to trade.</p><p>Qin Sang not only exchanged for several highly effective healing pills but also luckily obtained a bottle of pills that aided cultivation.  The trip was worthwhile.</p><p>The exchange concluded, and it was the next person's turn. Just as Qin Sang put away his things, his right ear twitched slightly. Without showing any reaction, he looked towards another corner of the hall.</p><p>A short, stout cultivator was looking at him.  Their eyes met, and the man subtly nodded before calmly turning to the next person's offering.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, pondering for a moment, before becoming engrossed in the ongoing transactions.</p><p>Given the waiting time, the actual trading was swift.  Shortly after noon, the last transaction was completed.  The old man made a few concluding remarks, announcing the end of the exchange. Under the market’s arrangement, everyone departed the island separately.</p><p>Before leaving, the old man gave Qin Sang a compass and invited him to the next exchange.</p><p>After leaving the island, Qin Sang flew some distance before cautiously glancing behind him.  He landed on a deserted island, took out a map, and found a place called Black Eagle Island within the same sea area.</p><p>Looking at the small island marked on the map, Qin Sang appeared thoughtful.</p><p>At the exchange, Qin Sang had almost given up hope. Unexpectedly, the short, stout cultivator secretly contacted him, saying he had a way to traverse the Thousand Demon Sea, but didn't want the treasures Qin Sang offered. He asked Qin Sang to come to Black Eagle Island for a discussion if he was interested.</p><p>After some consideration, Qin Sang decided to take a look.</p><p>However, there was one thing he had to do first; he was already eager.</p><p>After setting up isolating restrictions, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, taking down the bone flute around his neck and also taking out another bone flute.</p><p>He held his breath, examining the two bone flutes.  They were identical, indistinguishable even up close.</p><p>Holding a flute in each hand, they were finally together, but nothing happened.  Doubt flickered in Qin Sang's eyes, and he finally brought the two flutes closer.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The moment they touched, a crisp sound echoed, and the two bone flutes automatically joined together.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed; he was about to activate his protective array, prepared to flee if the commotion attracted nearby cultivators.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after joining, the flute trembled slightly, its surface glowing briefly, then became still.</p><p>The most significant change is that the celestial energy within the bone flute is now much stronger and more evident.</p><p>Qin Sang held it up, examining it closely. The two small sections fit together seamlessly, forming a long, perfectly unified flute; no trace of the break was visible.</p><p>After confirming the flute's stability, Qin Sang cautiously probed it with his spiritual sense.  As before, it was like a stone dropped into the ocean – no response.</p><p>"It seems the bone flute must have other fragments scattered elsewhere," he muttered, disappointed. "It won't reveal its power until all the pieces are reunited…"</p><p>Finding even one piece in a foreign land was fortunate, but the whereabouts of the other fragments were unknown.  If they were also scattered across different cultivation realms like these two, the chances of finding them were incredibly slim.</p><p>He tried again and again, to no avail, eventually tossing the flute into a corner of his storage ring.</p><p>"Time to go…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the sky and flew towards Black Eagle Island.</p><p>As evening approached, he saw the dark silhouette of a small island in the distance. The highest peak resembled a black eagle's wings, hence the name.</p><p>Sighting Black Eagle Island, Qin Sang slowed his flight, hovering in the air.</p><p>"Daoist Qin has arrived! Why not come ashore?"</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang appeared, a rainbow-like light shot from the island, revealing a short, stout cultivator who called out.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed as he stared at the shadowy island.  He said coldly, "There seem to be other cultivators on the island.  You didn't mention that."</p><p>The stout cultivator was startled, forcing a laugh.  "I didn't say I only invited Daoist Qin! Please rest assured, the other cultivator is an acquaintance, we met at the trading fair.  Several others haven't arrived yet…"</p><p>Before he finished, another figure flew from the island.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely and recognized the scholar in green robes he'd met at the trading fair.  He remembered the man well; the treasures he offered were exceptional, indicating considerable strength.</p>
