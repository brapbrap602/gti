**Chapter 294: Both Wounded**

Qin Sang led the way, followed by Shangguan Lifeng. After they had traveled a certain distance, or Qin Sang’s spiritual power had been exhausted to a certain extent, they would switch, with Shangguan Lifeng taking the lead.

A blue light flew out of the mustard seed bag and revealed itself as an ice pearl the size of a longan.

Inside the tiny ice pearl, there was a scene of a snowstorm. The goose feathers of snow were clearly visible, very realistic.

Qin Sang’s artifacts had all been destroyed at the crater. Before leaving, he had bought some practical artifacts. This Snow Pearl was one of them, only an excellent artifact, but it was most suitable for this place.

The Snow Pearl automatically flew to the top of Qin Sang’s head. Snowflakes fell from the pearl, forming a snow curtain around Qin Sang that constantly revolved around him.

The flames hit the snow curtain, and the ice and snow melted. The flames would also be extinguished at the same time, offsetting each other.

The snowflakes in the Snow Pearl seemed inexhaustible and continued to fall, replenishing the lost snow.

With the help of the artifact, Qin Sang did not have to pay full attention to maintaining the spiritual power shield. He nodded at Shangguan Lifeng and flew into the sea of fire.

The flames burned fiercely everywhere in his field of vision.

At first, the flames were not very powerful, similar to the flames they had encountered outside.

They could be easily resisted by the Snow Pearl alone.

The snowflakes would block the flames that rushed forward. Qin Sang sent a signal to Shangguan Lifeng, then sped up.

The flames gradually darkened, and their power increased several times.

Layers of flames struck upwards, and the snow curtain around Qin Sang became extremely thin. It was about to be burned through by the flames. The Snow Pearl alone was not enough to resist the burning. He had to continuously pour spiritual power into it.

However, these were not big problems, just normal changes. The real power of the restriction had yet to be revealed.

Qin Sang maintained the artifact while also being vigilant about his surroundings.

Suddenly, Qin Sang discovered that the flames in front of him seemed to have abnormal ripples. He did not hesitate to summon the ebony sword. The sword energy exploded, and he slashed forward.

The sea of fire was immediately split in two by the sword energy.

In his field of vision, layers of fierce flames were split apart. Finally, the sword energy collided with a flame, and it was easily dispersed.

This flame was very different from the surrounding flames. It was a pure blue, and it flew out from the depths of the sea of fire. It went straight to Qin Sang’s location.

The cyan flames seemed to be very afraid of the blue flame, and they made way for it.

The moment he saw the green flame, Qin Sang’s heart skipped a beat. He immediately warned Shangguan Lifeng behind him, and at the same time, he quickly moved his figure to the left.

“Swish!”

The cyan flame was not only long but also extremely fast. Qin Sang had dodged as much as he could, but he was still at a disadvantage. He saw that he was about to be grazed by the tail of the flame.

“Clap!”

A powerful force, carrying an extremely terrifying high temperature, gently swept past Qin Sang’s body. The snow curtain was easily shattered.

Qin Sang reacted extremely quickly. The ebony sword quickly moved in front of his body and met the flame head-on. It bought him a short time. At the last moment, he avoided the flame’s impact.

The ebony sword buzzed and flew back. Qin Sang carefully examined it and confirmed that the sword was fine.

The cyan flame did not turn to attack again. Instead, it simply dissipated in the air.

This was the attack method of the restriction, Qin Sang realized.

If it was only like this, it would not be difficult to deal with. However, it would definitely not be that simple later on. This cyan flame was only the tip of the iceberg.

Qin Sang guessed correctly. As he continued forward, another flame flew towards him soon after. This time, there were two of them. Qin Sang was prepared. His figure flashed repeatedly, and along with his ebony sword, he dodged the flames’ attack. However, he immediately felt something strange beneath him. He quickly moved several feet away. He saw a pillar of fire erupt from his original position, rising high into the sky.

From that moment on, the changes within the restriction became very concentrated. Flames and mysterious fire pillars appeared in succession, their attacks coming in waves, giving Qin Sang no chance to rest.

With Qin Sang leading the way, Shangguan Lifeng behind did not have to be on constant alert for the flames, which made things much easier for him.

After a while, Shangguan Lifeng took the initiative to step forward and let Qin Sang rest and recover.

As time passed, the changes in the restriction became more complex and dense. The two of them found it increasingly difficult to cope.

“That’s about enough.

"Once more they changed direction. Qin Sang estimated they had long since surpassed the center of the sea of flames. Breathing heavily for a few moments, he messaged, "Hold out here for thirty breaths, that should suffice."

Shangguan Lifeng dodged a pillar of fire, frowning as he replied, "I still have some strength left. It is more prudent to press further inward. I ask that you protect me, Daoist brother."

Seeing that Shangguan Lifeng insisted, Qin Sang had no alternative but to follow closely behind him.

Unexpectedly, after flying only a short distance, Shangguan Lifeng let out a roar, pain evident in his voice.

Moments later, Shangguan Lifeng's figure stumbled backward in retreat.

Half of his robe had been burned away, revealing a long gash on his chest. He had clearly been careless for a moment, failing to dodge the flow of flames and suffering heavy injuries.

Witnessing this, Qin Sang did not believe that Shangguan Lifeng was deliberately injuring himself. While his wounds were not insignificant, they were not critical either. He could recover after taking a healing elixir and resting for a while.

As long as he had not lost his fighting power, he had to shoulder the task of scouting ahead. Doing so would serve no purpose.

Predictably, dozens of streaks of blue flames attacked simultaneously from behind Shangguan Lifeng, forming a dense web of fire, leaving no gaps.

"No wonder," Qin Sang thought to himself, "I had a hard time handling a dozen or so streams of flames the last time."

"Buzz!"

The Ebonywood Sword pierced through the void, instantly passing Shangguan Lifeng. The sword formation unfurled and then ferociously clashed with the streams of flames.

The sword energy shattered, and the Ebonywood Sword flew back even faster. Although it was no match for the flames, it had blocked them for a moment.

Seizing this opportunity, Shangguan Lifeng channeled spiritual energy, transforming his body into a blade of light. He finally escaped the danger.

"I was reckless. Please forgive me, Daoist brother."

Shangguan Lifeng pressed a hand to his wound and laughed bitterly, a hint of shame in his expression.

He had already taken a healing elixir, but the fire poison within his body required some effort to expel.

Qin Sang shook his head and said, "So many streams of flames attacked simultaneously, but Shangguan only sustained minor injuries. Your cultivation is remarkable. We should not tarry here. Let us wait until we are out before healing!"

This time, Shangguan Lifeng did not object. Together with Qin Sang, he quickly flew toward the edge of the sea of flames.

They finally escaped the flames. Shangguan Lifeng rushed to Yu Kong, offered a brief explanation, and then immediately sat down cross-legged to circulate his cultivation technique and expel the fire poison.

"Recover as soon as possible!" Yu Kong also realized this was unavoidable and said with a frown.

Unexpectedly, as he finished speaking, Yan Wu and Wu Chen flew out.

Yan Wu looked sheepish.

Wu Chen's face was ashen, and his injuries were far more severe than Shangguan Lifeng's.
