<h1>Chapter 1350:  Each Their Own Destiny (Extra chapter for the盟主原神养舰!)</h1><p>Inner Sanctum.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Han Xi barely escaped the inner sanctum.</p><p>The journey was fraught with peril.</p><p>Among these dangers, the Five-Colored Immortal Wind was insignificant.</p><p>They were forced to employ their combined secret technique.</p><p>Even so, both man and lizard were covered in wounds. Lu Boyuan's robe was almost soaked in blood, though most were superficial injuries.</p><p>They occasionally looked up.</p><p>Ziwei Palace was getting closer to the large hole in the sky. The spatial storm's fluctuations made their scalps tingle, leaving them no time to heal.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A hidden realm was destroyed.</p><p>The shockwave surged outwards in all directions.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>Lu Boyuan shouted a warning.</p><p>Han Xi reacted swiftly, coordinating with Lu Boyuan's combined secret technique, spitting out a blast of frigid light.  The target was themselves.</p><p>The cold light enveloped them, forming a solid ice coffin, sealing them inside.</p><p>The next moment, the shockwave struck.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The ice coffin was sent flying, a cracking sound followed as fissures spread across its surface before shattering into countless fragments, some stained with blood.</p><p>Two figures shot out from the debris.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Han Xi were in a sorry state, but their lives were spared.  They used the momentum of the impact to successfully break out of the inner sanctum, rapidly descending towards the outer hall.</p><p>Only then did they have time to observe their surroundings.</p><p>The shattered celestial palace, with its earth-shattering power, left them shaken and still reeling in the aftermath as they gazed at the devastation above.</p><p>Their gaze shifted, and the platform beneath the spatial storm came into view.</p><p>Seeing the figures on the platform and the scene of everyone struggling to cross, they were stunned.</p><p>Both were highly intelligent; witnessing this and considering the strange phenomena within the palace, they instinctively guessed its purpose, even without knowing the platform's function.</p><p>Man and lizard exchanged a shocked glance.</p><p>“I’ve gotten you into this mess.”</p><p>Han Xi lamented.</p><p>If Lu Boyuan had been there, he too would have had a chance to ascend the platform.</p><p>To help Han Xi find the medicinal herbs it needed to recover, Lu Boyuan had risked his life with it in the ancient medicinal garden. While they successfully obtained the immortal herb, he was injured, overexerted, and too weak to ascend.</p><p>A unique opportunity for 'ascension' in the immortal cultivation world for countless years—missed!</p><p>Lu Boyuan didn't blame himself.  He stared at the platform, shaking his head. “Not necessarily! There might still be changes…”</p><p>Before he finished,</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A dark shadow crashed to the ground.</p><p>Lu Boyuan and Han Xi, distracted by the platform, were startled by the sound and turned to see a round, furry ball.  Upon closer inspection, it was Yu Wang in his true form.</p><p>Lu Boyuan admitted he wasn't as strong as Yu Wang, but Yu Wang was far worse off than they were.</p><p>Yu Wang's original form was magnificent, like a divine bird.</p><p>Now, his feathers were stained with blood, lacking their luster, with patches missing, and bleeding profusely – a horrific sight.</p><p>His wings were the worst, limp and broken, his left wing fractured into several pieces, barely held together by skin and sinew.</p><p>When had the lord of the Sky Demon Qiu ever been so pathetic!</p><p>Yu Wang rolled several times on the ground, staggered to his feet, and froze.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Yu Wang smoothed his few remaining crown feathers, greeting them calmly while also noticing the scene on the platform.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation,</p><p>Yu Wang's expression changed, a deep regret flashing in his eyes. Although his harvest was plentiful, missing this opportunity was irreparable.</p><p>If he hadn't been tempted by the immortal herbs in the ancient medicinal garden and suffered such severe injuries, he would undoubtedly be among those on the platform!</p><p>However, some fared even worse.</p><p>From time to time, bursts of blood erupted from the inner sanctum of Ziwei Palace. Those who hadn't escaped yet would never leave, perishing with their treasures!</p><p>Each their own destiny.</p><p>…</p><p>On the platform.</p><p>Ye Laomo, Bai, and Qing Jun stood on one side of the platform.</p><p>Zhen Daochang, Canghong Zhenren, and Tongyou Mojun stood on the other.</p><p>All remained silent.  Maintaining their footing on the platform was already difficult enough; they had to face the upcoming dangers and had no intention of fighting each other.</p><p>Qing Jun and Bai ignored their surroundings.</p><p>Yu Gu was under their control, slowly moving towards the spatial storm.</p><p>Since they couldn't kill the Yu Gu demon with their own strength, they would borrow external force!</p><p>Ye Laomo coldly watched Zhen Daochang and the other two.</p><p>As Yu Gu struggled, it screamed wildly, attempting to tempt them.</p><p>Anyone who succumbed would first have to deal with Ye Laomo.</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The heavens trembled.  Ziwei Palace soared higher and higher.  A shadow engulfed most of the inner hall.  Everyone was awestruck by the magnificent spectacle, staring blankly as Ziwei Palace breached the void.  This secret realm, once considered the greatest treasure of the Northern Star region, was leaving them forever.  The celestial palace descended to the mortal realm; it will one day return!</p><p>Finally, Ziwei Palace flew past the Qingtai platform, reaching the edge of the spatial storm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The shockwave, tangible as a solid object, spread outwards in a visible, enormous ring.  From their position, they could only see the edge of Ziwei Palace’s inner hall, and even that was blurry. Yet, they could guess the incredible destructive power of the celestial prohibitions and the spatial storm.</p><p>The outer hall crumbled at an increasing rate. The Qingtai storm’s power intensified manyfold in an instant.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun was the first to show signs of distress.  Always cautious and methodical in his actions, rarely taking risks, he hesitated, glanced at everyone on the platform, leaped down from Qingtai, and retreated in the face of overwhelming odds.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Deafening roars drowned out all other sounds.  Everyone’s hearts pounded, their expressions tense.</p><p>Yugu, still struggling futilely, was helplessly drawn towards the spatial storm.  His roars were barely audible.  His figure was as insignificant as an ant against the vastness of the spatial storm.</p><p>Surprisingly, Yugu’s bones were incredibly hard.  Even so close to the spatial storm, despite being hit by its shockwaves, he didn't instantly turn to ash.  If he hadn't been restrained by the Demon Binding Rope and the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, even falling into the spatial storm, he might have survived.</p><p>Qingjun, changing his hand seals, actively destroyed his own puppet, adding to Yugu's woes; his destruction was merely a matter of time.</p><p>Then, another person was eliminated from the Qingtai platform.  Cang Hong Zhenren’s most important protective treasure had been severely damaged by Ye Laomo and hadn’t recovered.  Having experienced the power of the spatial turbulence firsthand, knowing his chances were slim, he sighed inwardly and gave up.</p><p>Only Zhen Daochang remained!</p><p>"Old geezer, why don't you get out of here!  Do you really want to die?" Ye Laomo sneered.</p><p>His millennia-long scheme was about to succeed, and he felt talkative.  "Back then, I considered you my lifelong nemesis, yet you became the leader of the Tianxing Alliance.  You claim to be compassionate, protecting all living beings, but haven't you been intoxicated by power?  If you had the chance to lead the Beichen Alliance, wouldn't you have seized it?"
