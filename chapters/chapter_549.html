Chapter 542: Confinement


Secondly, even if one could find both of these rare objects, who would dare to integrate them into their body?
Both Earthly Yin Qi and Heavenly Yang Qi are incredibly violent and unruly, posing extreme danger to cultivators, who typically avoid them like the plague.
Without the unique secret techniques and restrictions of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*, Qin Sang would have had his Dantian destroyed by the Earthly Yin Qi the moment he attempted to draw it into his body.
The Verdant Sun Devil Sect considers the Verdant Sun Divine罡 as the foundation of their sect, yet they only use it to refine the embers of Verdant Sun Devilfire within their bodies, never daring to allow the Verdant Sun Divine罡 to come into direct contact with their flesh.
Introducing both罡 and Yin Qi into the Qi Sea simultaneously, allowing them to temper one’s spiritual power through mutual collision, is even more unheard of.
Should these two forces meet within the body, the resulting explosion would obliterate the cultivator, leaving no trace.
Furthermore, during the process of罡 and Yin Qi tempering his Dantian, Qin Sang didn't perceive any changes in his spiritual power, suggesting that condensing Yin Qi and refining罡 might not have an immediate effect like the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.
It's likely that continuous refinement is necessary, tempering the spiritual power within the body to its limits before the final effect manifests.
Even if someone were mad enough to attempt this, they certainly wouldn't be able to endure to the end.
Reflecting on his entire corpse refinement journey, Qin Sang realized every step was taken with extreme caution and trepidation.
His success stemmed from several factors.
First, the five Yin elements formed his foundation and strengthened his Qi Sea. Then, he relied on the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* to pacify the Earthly Yin Qi, and refined an external Golden Core into his body before daring to attempt the罡 and Yin Qi Dantian tempering.
During this process, the Golden Core bore the brunt of the impact from the罡 and Yin Qi, allowing Qin Sang to survive.
However, even this Golden Core nearly reached its limit. Had it been a Golden Core or Demon Core older than ten years, with its spiritual nature significantly diminished, the attempt would have undoubtedly ended in failure.
Of course, the Jade Buddha played a crucial role!
The Jade Buddha was the foundation of Qin Sang's daring attempts.  Its protection emboldened him to plant the Heavenly Corpse Talisman in his Nascent Soul.
Otherwise, even if he were desperate and carried it out, after completing the罡 and Yin Qi Dantian tempering, he likely wouldn't have been able to resist the corpse transformation.
He would have become like Wushang, a mindless Flying Night Devil, eternally trapped in a frozen cave, never to be freed.
A combination of incredibly demanding conditions, aligning by chance, led to Qin Sang's current state.
This path is impossible for others to replicate.
Even with knowledge of the effects of Heavenly Yang Qi and Earthly Yin Qi, they would have to seek other methods. Such an elusive endeavor is likely more challenging than gathering spirit objects to aid Core Formation.
After all, other Core Formation realm cultivators, unlike Qin Sang whose talent is so abysmal, don't need to resort to such desperate measures, risking everything for a glimmer of hope.
Qin Sang sighed inwardly, never expecting Wushang's letter, though not directly related to the path of corpse refinement, to unexpectedly open up an unprecedented path to Core Formation for him.
Of the fifty Great Dao, Heaven derives forty-nine. The Heavenly Dao is merciless, yet merciful!
Recalling his journey, he realized the trials his willpower faced were no less significant.
Had his spirit been crushed after failing to form his core with the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, lacking the unwavering perseverance to seek a sliver of hope amidst impossibility;
Had he cowered in the face of the difficulties and dangers of corpse refinement, lacking the resolve to risk it all;
Had he become intoxicated by the power of the Corpse Core after refining it, content with his current state, unwilling to remove the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, straying from the true path, losing his Dao Heart;
One wrong step, and he would have missed this opportunity.
This wasn't just a transformation in his cultivation.
It was also a baptism of his Dao Heart!
…
Thinking of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang suddenly remembered Shi Ying's soul mark still residing deep within his Nascent Soul.
After incapacitating Shi Ying at Divine罡 Peak, Qin Sang hadn't rushed to remove the soul mark as a precaution. Now, with no further need for it, he immediately instructed the Jade Buddha to shatter it.
The Jade Buddha effortlessly pulverized the soul mark, leaving no trace, a feat even Nascent Soul cultivators would struggle to achieve.
“The Verdant Sun Devil Sect will definitely investigate how I infiltrated them. However, Shi Ying should have awakened by the time I left the Verdant Sun Devil Sect and fought Wu Youdao. If she’s clever, whether she escaped the Verdant Sun Devil Sect during the chaos or found a way to cover her tracks, escaping shouldn't be difficult. Her future depends on her own fate…”
Qin Sang shook his head, dismissing the thought.
His karmic connection with Shi Ying ended here. They were even. He wouldn't go back and meddle further.
…
After the excitement subsided, Qin Sang's mind regained its composure. Realizing his situation wasn't completely secure, he quickly calmed down, patiently circulating his cultivation technique to strengthen the spiritual power within his Qi Sea.
Time flowed silently.
When the spiritual power within the two mid-grade spirit stones in his hands was nearly depleted, turning them into pale white pebbles, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, with a glint of light flashing within them.
That sliver of spiritual power had grown exponentially stronger.
Now, his spiritual power was incredibly condensed, a qualitative change. Even without forming his core, his strength had already undergone a complete transformation.
If he had to gauge it, it should be somewhere between a Core Formation realm cultivator and a Flying Night Devil, provided his spiritual power could maintain this state.
Qin Sang didn't rush to attempt Core Formation.  He stopped when his spiritual power had recovered to about seventy or eighty percent, as he hadn't yet mastered the Corpse Core.
The longer he delayed, the harder the Corpse Core would be to subdue, with signs of instability becoming increasingly apparent. He couldn't afford to procrastinate.
Even if he formed his core, this 'external core' would be a powerful asset, equivalent to possessing two 'Golden Cores.'  This was achieved through immense effort, and Qin Sang naturally didn't want to let it go to waste.
Of course, compared to his own Golden Core, the Corpse Core was secondary. If the Corpse Core would affect his Core Formation, he would undoubtedly abandon it without hesitation.
Qin Sang patiently observed for a while, and seeing that his spiritual power was very stable, with no signs of reverting, he felt relieved and turned his attention to the state of the Corpse Core.
He had initially planned to actively dissipate a portion of the Corpse Core's power to make it easier to control. Now, with his transformed spiritual power and soaring strength, there was no need for such measures. He could directly attempt to control the Corpse Core at its peak.
Qin Sang already had a plan in mind and immediately channeled his spiritual power with full force, enveloping the Corpse Core.
The Corpse Core didn't resist Qin Sang, so he didn't have to fear backlash and could act freely.
This 'subjugation' was a painstaking process. After a full hour, Qin Sang finally emerged from his meditative state, letting out a long breath, filled with excitement.
Through continuous attempts, he finally subdued the Corpse Core, and his True Essence flowed smoothly, back under his control.
At this moment, all of his True Essence was withdrawn into the Corpse Core. The bluish-black Corpse Core slowly rotated within Qin Sang's Qi Sea, faint glimmers of restrictive light flashing on its surface.
As long as Qin Sang willed it, he could unleash the Corpse Core at any moment, exhibiting power no less than that of a Core Formation cultivator.
Testing its activation, it functioned as smoothly as before, and it didn't interfere with his use of the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter* techniques. His current strength surpassed even when he fought Wu Youdao!
