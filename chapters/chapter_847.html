<h1>Chapter 839: The Fish Demon</h1><p>The sheer number of demonic beasts was overwhelming.</p><p>The Golden Light Formation opened a path, but it threatened to close immediately after.</p><p>Standing on the mountain peak, the Leopard Demon watched this scene in a daze, filled with anxiety. It hadn't anticipated the Golden Light Formation's terrifying power.</p><p>Its insistence on breaking the formation to search for someone had resulted in heavy losses for the demonic beasts. When the transformed Great Demons returned, they would surely be furious and take their anger out on it.</p><p>"After this, I must return to my clan and hide for a few hundred years."</p><p>The Leopard Demon resolved inwardly.</p><p>The Crane Demon and Flying Fish Demon beside it were even more enraged, watching their subordinates swallowed by the golden light, their hearts bleeding. A chill ran down their spines. They were also grateful that they weren't at the front.</p><p>"I think I saw Six-Eyes. He was mangled by the golden light, half his body shattered. I don't know if he's dead…"</p><p>The Flying Fish Demon flapped its two long fins, its eyes uneasy, its tone hesitant.</p><p>"The one I saw, I don't know if it was Red-Tail. He was worse off than Six-Eyes, directly engulfed by the golden light, no bones left. The King values Red-Tail the most. How am I going to explain this to him!"</p><p>The Crane Demon's voice was sharp, its furious gaze fixed on the Leopard Demon, as if it wanted to devour it alive.</p><p>"If you didn't have designs on these humans, do you think I could force you? Everything we seize will be yours. I don't mind bearing the Demon King's wrath for you, but you must find that person for me!"</p><p>The Leopard Demon sneered, taking the initiative, its figure leaping up and rushing down the mountain.</p><p>"What are you two waiting for? The Golden Light Formation is exhausted. Hurry back and find that person. As long as we can capture him, the Serpent King will be overjoyed and will surely reward us handsomely. Your King will also benefit and definitely won't be punished."</p><p>The Crane Demon and Flying Fish Demon exchanged glances, their expressions sheepish, then they rushed down the mountain separately to search.</p><p>The Leopard Demon charged into the horde of demonic beasts, heading straight for the cultivators who had broken through, its nostrils twitching.</p><p>After a fruitless search, just as the Leopard Demon was growing restless, the Crane Demon flew back swiftly. "We've detected the scent of that person's companions to the north. They're a powerful group, with many experts! Flying Fish has already taken our forces to engage them."</p><p>The Leopard Demon's eyes lit up. "Is that person there?" it asked urgently.</p><p>"We haven't detected his scent."</p><p>The Crane Demon shook its head.</p><p>The Leopard Demon hesitated for a moment, then made a decision. "Gather everyone immediately. Capture his companions first. Be clever, and don't get caught by a human Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>At the mention of human Nascent Soul cultivators, a flicker of fear crossed the Crane Demon's eyes. It restrained its light and flew off to gather more forces.</p><p>The Leopard Demon immediately sped towards the direction from which the Crane Demon had come.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang was trapped in the tide of beasts, confronting a strange Fish Demon, his heart filled with anxiety.</p><p>This Fish Demon had the head of a fish, but also had four limbs like a human and walked upright, a slender fish tail trailing behind it. Its eyes were intelligent, clearly possessing high intelligence.</p><p>The moment the formation broke, Qin Sang was the first to leave the city, following the golden light to break through.</p><p>With the golden light clearing the way, Qin Sang only needed to focus on fleeing at full speed. He quickly flew beyond Yu Heng Island and, if there were no unexpected incidents, should have been able to escape the beast horde smoothly.</p><p>But an unexpected incident did occur.</p><p>While Qin Sang was escaping, he was completely unaware that he had been targeted by this Fish Demon.</p><p>If he hadn't been vigilant and had his Sky-Eye Butterfly on constant alert, he would have been injured by the Fish Demon's sneak attack from beneath the water's surface.</p><p>What infuriated Qin Sang was that he didn't pursue the Fish Demon for its attempted ambush, but the Fish Demon wouldn't let him go, blocking his path.</p><p>The Fish Demon stood on the water, its fishtail playfully splashing.</p><p>It had a long, narrow wound on its body, its left arm and a large portion of its chest and abdomen missing, likely caused by the Golden Light Formation.</p><p>Despite being heavily injured, the Fish Demon was exceptionally arrogant.</p><p>"Offer all your treasures to me, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p>The Fish Demon's eyes were greedy, fixed on the storage pouch at Qin Sang's waist, speaking in human tongue. It only half-believed the Leopard Demon's words, but it was certain that Qin Sang possessed valuable treasures; otherwise, the Leopard Demon wouldn't be so frantic.</p><p>If he truly was the one being hunted by the Serpent King, the treasures on him would be even more extraordinary.</p><p>Therefore, upon discovering Qin Sang, it immediately summoned its capable subordinates, without any intention of contacting the Leopard Demon.</p><p>A Great Demon that had consumed Emperor Flow Nectar!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>This Fish Demon's strength was probably no less than the body cultivator he had encountered outside the Seven Kill Hall. Even injured, it would be a difficult opponent.</p><p>What worried him even more was that several powerful auras were rapidly approaching in the distance, clearly reinforcements summoned by the Fish Demon.</p><p>Once surrounded by Great Demons, he would truly have no chance of escape.</p><p>Fortunately, he was no longer the same as he was back then.</p><p>In this situation, not a single second could be wasted. Without a word, Qin Sang threw the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings at the Fish Demon.</p><p>With a flick of its tail, the Fish Demon conjured a water column several meters high to collide with the rings, testing them. Unexpectedly, with a flash of light, a two-headed Flood Dragon emerged from the rings. Its vertical pupils shot out a storm, instantly shredding the water column before lunging at the Fish Demon.</p><p>"With your cultivation, you willingly serve humans? Shameless!"</p><p>The Fish Demon was startled, then enraged, cursing the two-headed Flood Dragon while trying to entice it. "Help me capture and kill this human, and I will ask the King to reward you with Emperor Flow Nectar to help you transform sooner!"</p><p>The two-headed Flood Dragon felt resentful, thinking that if it weren't for the restrictive ring, it would have fled long ago and wouldn't have to suffer this.</p><p>Ignoring the Fish Demon's words, the two-headed Flood Dragon pressed its attack. Qin Sang also arrived on his sword, with a wave of his hand, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fiery line, shooting towards the Fish Demon's wound.</p><p>Sensing the strange nature of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the Fish Demon's heart tightened. It dared not let the demonic fire get close. Facing the combined attack of the man and the dragon, it felt overwhelmed.</p><p>The Fish Demon continued to curse and try to persuade the two-headed Flood Dragon, but instead of swaying it, it only further enraged the beast.</p><p>The situation seemed favorable, but Qin Sang knew that this wasn't the time for a protracted battle.  The powerful auras were getting closer. He couldn't delay any longer and had to make a decision quickly.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang glanced coldly at the Fish Demon.  Seizing the opportunity as it dodged the demonic fire, he unhesitatingly unleashed his trump card, the Star Conch.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A brilliant light flashed, and the astonishing aura startled the Fish Demon.</p><p>"What is this…"</p><p>The Fish Demon screamed in terror.</p><p>The Star Conch rapidly enlarged in its vision. The Fish Demon finally recognized it as the conch-shaped magical treasure the Leopard Demon had displayed earlier, but it hadn't warned them of its terrifying power!</p><p>By now, it had no time to complain about the Leopard Demon.</p><p>As the Star Conch grew larger before its eyes, the Fish Demon's pupils constricted. A whirlpool appeared beneath it, and it plunged into it, its scales flashing with blue light like armor.</p><p>Bound by the contract, the two-headed Flood Dragon immediately charged forward to stop the Fish Demon.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Star Conch struck the Fish Demon's right chest.</p><p>Its scales were pierced, and almost its entire right side exploded. The Fish Demon's shrill cry made the surrounding demonic beasts instinctively tuck their tails.</p>
