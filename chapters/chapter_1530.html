<h1>Chapter 1521: Old Friend</h1><p>Chapter 1521: Old Friend</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the stele, gazing for a long time before looking up at the sky.</p><p>He raised his arm, as if to touch the celestial beings above.</p><p>Looking back, he recalled his youthful arrogance and bold pronouncements.  He never imagined he would actually reach this point. Though he hadn't yet reached the pinnacle of this realm, he was not far off.</p><p>“Now, I take another step forward…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his palm loosely clenched, pulling down a wisp of cloud to reveal the clear sky.</p><p>Pausing, he muttered, “I am about to embark on a long journey. This path ahead is unpredictable; I do not know whether it leads to an abyss or helps me ascend another level, closer to the unattainable celestial realm.”</p><p>Saying this, he took out his wine flask and offered a toast to the Empress.</p><p>A gentle shake produced a gurgling sound from within the flask.</p><p>Throughout his journey, Qin Sang had visited the tombs of Wu Chuanzong, Bai Jianglan, and others to pay his respects, nearly emptying the flask.</p><p>He drained the remaining wine.</p><p>Qin Sang set up stronger protective barriers, gave the stele one last deep look, then turned and descended from the Sacred Mountain, gradually disappearing into the distance.</p><p>…</p><p>Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>After Jing Yu assumed leadership, she hadn't made many changes.</p><p>Except for her own cave dwelling, everything remained largely the same, including the practice of Yunyouzi protecting the spirits of the plants and trees—a practice she continued.</p><p>Inside the main hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was addressing his companions.</p><p>A white cat sat on a cushion, completely engrossed.</p><p>The old monkey scratched its head and ears in confusion.</p><p>The white crane appeared respectful, but its eyes darted around; Yue'er nestled beside it.</p><p>Having cultivated the "Celestial Demon Transformation Scripture" and received guidance from Jing Yu, their transformations were remarkable, and their cultivation had significantly improved.</p><p>The willow spirit offered spiritual tea.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it and took a sip. Sensing something, he rose to look towards the entrance as Jing Yu walked in.</p><p>“Did I disturb your meditation?”</p><p>Jing Yu shook her head slightly, a slight smile on her lips. “I didn’t expect Daoist Qin to return from the North Sea so soon. You seem full of energy; your gains must be considerable?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t show false modesty. He dismissed the assembled demons with a wave of his hand, his expression turning serious as he explained his decision to Jing Yu.</p><p>“Relocating the sect?”</p><p>Jing Yu was startled.</p><p>Even greater shock followed when she heard Qin Sang's decision to travel to the Central Plains. Jing Yu exclaimed aloud.</p><p>“Your cultivation hasn't reached its peak, your lineage is intact, and you haven't encountered any insurmountable bottlenecks. Why take such a risk now?” Jing Yu found it hard to understand.</p><p>Travel isn't always a good thing.</p><p>Many only see others gaining opportunities and changing their destinies.</p><p>But such instances are rare.  Countless cultivators die far from home; even Yuan Ying masters are always in danger.</p><p>Jing Yu had a profound understanding of this.</p><p>Unless one's path is completely blocked or there is an irresistible opportunity, the wisest course of action is to dedicate oneself to cultivation.</p><p>“Without the琉璃 and the Ten Directions Earth-Opening Shuttle, I would only have patience and diligent cultivation. Since there's a way, there's no reason not to go, even if I return after obtaining a chance encounter.”</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully weighed the pros and cons.</p><p>Cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," refining demonic fire, and its relation to spiritual cultivation, was a crucial step in his path, something he had to do sooner or later.  Traveling wouldn't delay it; it wouldn't be a waste of time, just an advancement of the timeline.</p><p>Jing Yu no longer tried to dissuade him.</p><p>At Qin Sang's level of cultivation, any decision he made would have been carefully considered and impossible for others to influence.</p><p>“How is Chi Lei doing?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jing Yu replied, “I'm using bloodline secret techniques to purify and refine its blood essence.  We're not rushing its breakthrough. Once the secret techniques are complete, the benefits after its transformation will be immense.”</p><p>Among the demons, the fat chicken had the best talent and the highest chance of transforming quickly.</p><p>Beasts below the transformation stage could no longer help him.</p><p>Since the fat chicken hadn't transformed yet, Jing Yu wouldn't leave.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing more, handing Jing Yu a jade slip containing a map of the Central Plains.</p><p>After examining it in surprise, she exclaimed, “The journey is truly long. Daoist friend, please be careful! If I ever have the chance to break through to the later stages of transformation, I'll consider going to the Central Plains.  However, hearing you talk about the North Sea scenery has piqued my interest.  There are still too few demon clans in the Northern Star Realm.  More interaction with others would benefit Bai He and the others.  When the Qingyang Sect relocates, I will go with you.”</p><p>“With the Qingyang Sect divided, Tan Hao alone will struggle to manage everything. I'll need your help,” Qin Sang bowed politely.</p><p>Jing Yu blinked, smiling. “Isn't that something I already promised?  Besides, your trip to the Central Plains is paving the way for us. We naturally need to look after your rear!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I'll leave a map at the Qingyang Sect. If anyone comes looking, don’t hide it; simply give them the map.”</p><p>Jing Yu carefully took note of Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>After a brief stay, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was in quiet cultivation.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light flew into his cave. Mu Yifeng slowly opened his eyes, drew the light into his palm, and his expression immediately brightened. He hastily rose and personally went to greet the visitor at the Jianmen Pass.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, it’s been many years! You’ve become even more impressive!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng said with a bow and a smile.</p><p>“Senior Brother Mu, when did you become so smooth-talking?”</p><p>Qin Sang teased, following him into Shaohua Mountain.  Passing Jianmen Pass, he paused slightly, gazing intently for a long time.  Peach blossoms bloomed on either side of the mountain, young girls playing amongst them, a scene reminiscent of the past.</p><p>The two entered Mu Yifeng’s cave and sat down.</p><p>“I saw Dongyang Bo in the North Sea. He’s dead now.”</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Mu Yifeng stiffened, his mouth slightly agape.</p><p>“When I met him, he was weak and dying, only barely clinging to life. He gave me this…”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't keep him in suspense, producing the Yang Kui crystal. He briefly recounted the events.  “Senior Brother Qiu is still alive. Dongyang Bo carefully paved the way for him; he’ll likely reach the Nascent Soul stage in the future. I’ve decided to move some Qingyang Temple disciples to the North Sea.  Senior Brother, please don’t spread this. If you have time, you could come with me to the North Sea. If you encounter Senior Brother Qiu, perhaps you could persuade him to return.”</p><p>Mu Yifeng stared at Qin Sang. “Junior Brother…”</p><p>Qin Sang said, “Dongyang Bo is dead. Our grievances are settled. I won't hold it against innocent people.  I’ve also found joy in Shaohua Mountain, and I am happy to see it prosper.”</p><p>“Thank you for your magnanimity, Junior Brother Qin!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng sighed.  “If only Master hadn’t done those things…”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. “Let’s not talk about that!  I see your cultivation is stable, Senior Brother. Your next hurdle is the Nascent Soul stage. The North Sea is far vaster than Beichen Region; there might be opportunities there…”</p><p>“I’m still far from it.”</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head repeatedly. “My cultivation was forcibly advanced. Before I reach the Nascent Soul bottleneck, I’ll face many more trials.  Yu Fu will probably get there before me.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu possessed dual spiritual roots, yet his progress was unremarkable.</p><p>Qin Sang founded Qingyang Temple, fulfilling Yunyouzi’s wishes.</p><p>Li Yu Fu resolved his inner conflicts, and after breaking through to the mid-Golden Core stage, his progress didn't stop.</p><p>While Qin Sang was in seclusion, Li Yu Fu also made rapid progress, now unexpectedly breaking through to the late Golden Core stage. At this rate, he has the potential to become Qingyang Temple's next Nascent Soul cultivator!</p>
