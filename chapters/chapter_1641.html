<h1>Chapter 1632: Sword, Drum, Painting</h1><p>Within the Lang Huan Blessed Land, the truly useful item for Qin Sang was only the latter half of the *Essence Soul Sword Nurturing Scripture*.</p><p>The other scriptures didn't seem to have any immediate use.</p><p>This was normal; the easily comprehensible parts had already been divided amongst the Five Branches.</p><p>The *Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art* wasn't here.  However, Qin Sang still spent some effort memorizing all the scriptures in this place, regardless of their usefulness.</p><p>Qin Sang was a bit puzzled by the relationship between Xiao Xiangzi and the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Based on all the clues obtained previously, Qin Sang believed that Xiao Xiangzi likely originated from the Formless Immortal Sect, but was forced to flee to the Northern Lands. Disheartened, he was unwilling to mention his former sect.</p><p>Yet, the latter half of the *Essence Soul Sword Nurturing Scripture* was placed within the Lang Huan Blessed Land for people to comprehend. If the Killing Sword fragments were discovered alongside the cultivation method, they should have been placed in the Cloud Pool back then.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi valued the Killing Sword fragments so much, yet his notes didn't mention the cultivation method, as if he was unaware of the connection between the two.</p><p>Unless he hadn't qualified to ascend the Jade Pavilion's peak back then and only obtained it by chance outside, after the Formless Immortal Sect was destroyed and the Killing Sword fragments scattered.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>The truth from back then had been lost to the passage of time. Only Xiao Xiangzi himself knew his own experiences.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped dwelling on these inconsequential matters. His mind withdrew from the sphere of light, and he continued to meditate for a while longer, organizing his newfound knowledge.</p><p>The cultivation method was now in hand, and there was plenty of time in the future.  There was no rush.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang rose from the meditation mat and descended to the lower level, intending to search the Cloud Pool for any other treasures that might interest him.</p><p>After that, he'd consider rejoining his Avatar at the Ice Palace, or perhaps continuing to act separately, with his true body going directly to the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>Returning to the corridor,</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked around.</p><p>Myriad lights shimmered within the legacy land.</p><p>He naturally paid the most attention to the cliff face, wondering if any further changes would occur.</p><p>The unusual phenomena on the cliff had subsided, and there were no signs of fighting.</p><p>“The Formless Immortal Sect and the Eight Sceneries Sect clashed.  I wonder who won and who lost?  With the Immortal Palace ascending, are they still determined to fight to the death? My understanding of the Formless Immortal Sect is still too limited. I should consider carefully which side to approach...”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, unable to guess the future direction of the situation.</p><p>Fortunately, the cultivation method was already in his possession, which would allow him to act with much greater ease.</p><p>The emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect was a momentous event that occurred only once in ten thousand years.  The legacy land contained countless treasures that had never been unearthed.  He certainly wasn't willing to leave just like that.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the Cloud Pool, searching for his next target.</p><p>He couldn't see the treasures within the jade cages.</p><p>However, the broken blades and swords outside were clearly visible.</p><p>Despite their current dormant state and diminished power, when intact, they were at least pseudo-spiritual treasures.  Ordinary magical treasures weren't qualified to be placed within the Cloud Pool by the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He also cultivated the Dao of Artifact Refinement. If he could glean some insights from these fragmented treasures, he would undoubtedly benefit greatly, aiding Cloud Wanderer in developing its spiritual nature.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang focused on a broken sword.</p><p>Quite the opposite of the Killing Sword, this sword had a hilt but no tip.</p><p>The sword's body was transparent, flickering in and out of existence under the reflection of the Cloud Pool, resembling an illusory sword shadow.  Without a second thought, Qin Sang named it the Chengying Sword!</p><p>The Chengying Sword was broken in the middle, the fracture smooth, as if it had been severed by an even sharper weapon.</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>Qin Sang settled on the Chengying Sword and, repeating his previous trick, summoned four fire figures.</p><p>Since the Chengying Sword couldn't respond to him, retrieving it was noticeably more difficult than the last time. Qin Sang failed three times in a row before managing to extract the Chengying Sword just before it vanished.</p><p>“It's still too difficult for just one person…”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Grasping the Chengying Sword, he discovered, to his surprise, that both his true essence and divine sense passed directly through it, as if the sword didn't exist.</p><p>Controlling the spiritual sword was a pipe dream.</p><p>“The treasures in the Cloud Pool are indeed strange, one after another. If they were so easily understood, they wouldn't have waited for me…”</p><p>He maintained a positive attitude, played with it for a bit, then stored the Chengying Sword within his Thousand Jun Ring and continued his treasure hunt.</p><p>After resting for a while, he made further intermittent attempts, successfully fishing out a small drum with a hole in it, as well as a tattered scroll.</p><p>The small drum was intact, with only a hole in the center of the drumhead. Qin Sang initially thought it might be repairable, but upon obtaining it, he realized it wasn't that simple.</p><p>The scroll depicted a boundless stretch of water, constantly flowing, its source and destination unknown. Holding it close, one could hear the murmuring sound of flowing water.</p><p>These three were the most conspicuous of the fragmented treasures in the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Without exception, no matter what method he used, the fragmented treasures remained unresponsive.</p><p>Having obtained the three fragmented treasures, Qin Sang shifted his attention to the jade cages, wanting to fish out a few more to see what treasures they contained, testing his luck.</p><p>Just then, an unusual phenomenon appearing in the distance caught his attention!</p><p>While fishing for treasures, Qin Sang hadn't neglected his vigilance.</p><p>The whereabouts of the Formless Immortal Sect remnants and the Daoist cultivators were unknown. Both sides were stronger than him, so he couldn't afford to lower his guard.</p><p>Firstly, to prevent anyone from approaching the Lang Huan Blessed Land unnoticed, and secondly, to keep an eye on the Ice Palace, in case his Avatar encountered a powerful enemy.</p><p>The unusual phenomenon originated from the Ice Palace!</p><p>Qin Sang strained his eyes and could see faint, ethereal blue light fluctuating between the mountains. Under the celestial light, several illusory images of ice palaces were faintly reflected, interspersed with the glow of restrictive formations, but he couldn't see the complete Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>After his Avatar entered, due to possessing the Ice Disk, the restrictive formations and the ethereal blue light within the Ice Palace had remained stable.</p><p>Now, several beams of white light suddenly erupted from within the Ice Palace, quickly causing the surrounding restrictive formations to flicker incessantly.</p><p>The white light shot out but didn't ascend to the sky.</p><p>Moreover, the area experiencing the disturbance was located in the central part of the Ice Palace, relatively insignificant compared to the entire structure.</p><p>Those too far away likely wouldn't notice it, but Qin Sang, standing within the Lang Huan Blessed Land on higher ground and possessing the Heavenly Eye, naturally saw it clearly.</p><p>“My Avatar has been inside for a while. If all went smoothly, it should have already entered the Ice Palace's core hall, or even come out… Why is the disturbance in the central area?”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p>He and his Avatar had an agreement.  If trouble arose, the Avatar would send a signal to alert him.</p><p>No signal had been received, but the timing of the unusual phenomenon was clearly abnormal.</p><p>There were no essential items for him in the Cloud Pool either.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the unusual phenomenon and, making a swift decision, withdrew the Demonic Fire, left the Lang Huan Blessed Land, and rapidly flew towards the Ice Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>Strange Face and Weeping Wraith Cave Master arrived together in front of the Ice Palace.</p><p>“Back in the day, any randomly chosen branch of the Formless Immortal Sect wouldn't have been inferior to today's top sects. Now, look at this…”</p><p>Looking at the dilapidated Ice Instrument Palace, Weeping Wraith Cave Master lamented, especially after hearing from Strange Face that Fire Rhinoceros Island was even more damaged, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>“Can you still sense the Wood Spirit Qi?” He turned to ask Strange Face.</p><p>Strange Face didn't reply immediately, closing his eyes to sense for a moment.  Then, he said, “The treasure wood is still here, but I can't sense its precise location. Perhaps it's being interfered with by the residual formations. I can only pinpoint the general direction.  It should be in the deepest part of the Ice Instrument Palace.”</p><p>“Such a treasure wood will definitely be heavily guarded,” Weeping Wraith Cave Master summoned a magical treasure for protection and urged, "Even if it’s only a residual formation, breaking it will be no easy task. Let’s move quickly.”</p><p>Strange Face naturally had no objections and stepped forward to follow.</p><p>Entering the Ice Instrument Palace, they first saw the dried-up small lake.  Then, they discovered three paths in the forest.</p><p>With a clear objective, they headed straight down the middle path.</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master was about to enter the forest when Strange Face suddenly called out to him.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Strange Face stood before the forest, arms outstretched. The grass and trees at his feet suddenly grew wildly.  His ten fingers danced delicately, and specks of green light separated from his fingertips, drifting into the forest.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew through the trees.</p><p>The canopy swayed gently, a wave of green rippling forward.</p><p>But in Weeping Wraith Cave Master’s eyes, these plants felt completely different from before, as if they had been brought under Strange Face's control, becoming a part of him.</p><p>Then, Strange Face signaled Weeping Wraith Cave Master to follow him into the forest.</p><p>With each step he took, the green wave flowed forward a certain distance.</p><p>The branches of ancient trees automatically bent downwards, weaving a path of branches for them within the forest. Once they passed, the branches returned to their original positions.</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master followed behind Strange Face.  Halfway through their journey, he asked, "Any discoveries?"</p><p>The surrounding plants were Strange Face’s eyes. If someone had left markings in the forest, they wouldn't escape his perception.</p><p>Strange Face shook his head.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see. We might be the first,” Weeping Wraith Cave Master said with a relaxed tone, constantly surveying their surroundings, appearing quite interested.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall's path wasn't suitable for him.</p><p>However, back in the day, the five branches of the Formless Immortal Sect were equally renowned.  If the Wood Phase Hall had such a top-tier secret art, the Water Phase Hall definitely had its own unknown secrets!</p><p>This was a good opportunity to search around.</p><p>They passed through the forest smoothly.</p><p>The two saw the garden and the Qilin Shadow Wall!</p><p>Before the Qilin Shadow Wall was activated, it showed no abnormalities whatsoever, so the two inevitably repeated the mistake of Qin Sang’s Avatar.</p><p>Approaching it, just as they were about to go around,</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Shadow Wall erupted in a cold light, and the Ice Qilins instantly detached from the wall, pouncing towards them.</p><p>Strange Face's expression changed slightly.  He shouted softly, "Be careful!"</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master's reaction wasn't slow at all.  Simultaneously with Strange Face's warning, he flicked his sleeve, and a flash of silver light appeared, a silver chain flying out from his sleeve.</p><p>The silver chain was soft as if it were nothing, unfurling mid-air, tightening into a single line, shooting straight towards the first Ice Qilin.  The angle was extremely precise, appearing in a flash beneath the Ice Qilin's neck, instantly entangling it.</p><p>At the same time, Strange Face spread his five fingers wide, and a green light appeared in the void. Dozens of vines sprouted out of thin air, twisting and writhing like snakes.</p><p>An Ice Qilin happened to pounce from above the vines.  The vines, sensing the enemy's presence, scrambled to grab the Ice Qilin, binding it tightly.</p><p>There were eight Ice Qilins in total.  But seeing two Ice Qilins subdued so easily, Strange Face and Weeping Wraith Cave Master relaxed.</p><p>Without needing to communicate, they worked in perfect harmony, each choosing three of the remaining Ice Qilins.</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master uttered the word "Freeze," not needing to use his Red Flower.  He flicked his fingers, and three beams of spiritual light shot towards the three Ice Qilins.</p><p>The spiritual light transformed into rings mid-air, landing precisely on the heads of the Ice Qilins, like collars around their necks.</p><p>Strange Face appeared even more relaxed.</p><p>After the mass of vines bound the first Ice Qilin, more vines continued to grow, quickly forming a large net in the air, surrounding the remaining three Ice Qilins.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, all the Ice Qilins were captured!</p><p>“There are still restrictive formations ahead.  It seems we need to be careful…”</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master didn't pay much attention to the Ice Qilins, glancing towards the depths of the garden as he spoke.</p><p>Unexpectedly, mid-sentence, Weeping Wraith Cave Master suddenly stopped talking, looking at the silver chain in surprise.  The Ice Qilin that had been entangled by the silver chain had vanished without a trace!</p><p>Immediately after, the two discovered that the Ice Qilins they had controlled were becoming illusory, disappearing from their restraints.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Strange Face had a premonition of danger and darted forward.</p><p>In the next moment, the scenery around them abruptly changed.</p><p>Cold wind howled.</p><p>The garden was right in front of them, yet it was rapidly receding. Only the Qilin Shadow Wall remained standing before them.  The dilapidated Shadow Wall was like a tall wall, blocking their path.</p><p>This wasn't an illusion.</p><p>The two felt themselves being isolated from reality by a strange force.</p><p>Experienced as they were, they immediately moved closer together and saw the vanished Ice Qilins reappear around them.</p><p>The eight Ice Qilins, in identical crouching positions, surrounded them, opening their mouths wide and continuously spewing cold air.</p><p>The white cold air swirled around them, its energy connected to the Qilin Shadow Wall, emitting a strange power. It was this power that trapped them here!</p><p>The cold air intensified, threatening to freeze them solid.</p><p>“Strange!”</p><p>Strange Face frowned deeply, stamping his foot heavily. A green halo burst forth from him.</p><p>Weeping Wraith Cave Master, on the other hand, pointed with his finger.  The Red Flower flew high into the air and then flipped upside down.  The Red Flower’s petals fluttered, seemingly gentle, yet possessing an immense suction force, actually drawing the streams of cold air into itself.</p><p>He resisted the cold air.</p><p>Strange Face's target was the true bodies of the eight Qilins.  Wherever the halo passed, vines grew wildly, and the eight Ice Qilins were instantly engulfed in a vibrant jungle of vines.</p><p>In the next moment, the vines withered!</p><p>Death Qi erupted.</p><p>If the Avatar were here, he would recognize it at a glance as the Forest of Withering Hell that Strange Face had used against them before.</p><p>Using it now, Strange Face was clearly much more composed than last time, limiting the range of this divine ability to the area around the eight Ice Qilins.</p><p>In an instant,</p><p>The Ice Qilins were assaulted by the Death Qi, their crystalline bodies coated in a layer of gray, chunks of ice falling away.  They seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><p>However, before the two could devise a way to escape the confinement,</p><p>The Qilin Shadow Wall flickered with cold light, and new Ice Qilins emerged.</p><p>Moreover, the cold air left behind by the previous Ice Qilins hadn't dissipated.  As soon as these new Ice Qilins appeared, they were able to manipulate the vast amount of cold air, as if they were fish in water, far surpassing the previous batch in strength.</p><p>At this moment, Strange Face and Weeping Wraith Cave Master finally realized they were in trouble.</p><p>As long as the Qilin Shadow Wall remained, the Ice Qilins were immortal, appearing endlessly, their power growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>The two were confident in protecting themselves from the Ice Qilins' siege, waiting for the Qilin Shadow Wall's power to be exhausted. But this was clearly not feasible; it would take far too long. They had to find a way to resolve their current predicament!</p><p>…</p><p>Deep within the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The Taiji Immortal Platform.</p><p>The Avatar memorized the restrictive formations of the Taiji Immortal Platform and returned to the outer formation, placing the Ice Disk on the ice platform to replenish its energy while analyzing the platform and the residual formations.</p><p>The Qilin Shadow Wall shook the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The Avatar’s expression shifted slightly, and he darted out of the hidden chamber.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you, Red Dust Old Nine, for the generous Alliance Leader donation!</p>
