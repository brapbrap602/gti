<h1>Chapter 2118: First Battle</h1><p>“Greetings, Grand Preceptor.”</p><p>Si Lu appeared at the edge of the Thunder Marsh, offering respects only to the Grand Preceptor, completely disregarding the others.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor scrutinized Si Lu, saying, “A thousand years ago, when King Yan brought you to my manor, we met once.”</p><p>Si Lu nodded. “I was young and naive then. My father requested your guidance, Grand Preceptor.  I still vividly remember that scene, but alas, things have changed.”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor smiled, but offered no reply.</p><p>King Lu, displaying remarkable patience, did not react to Si Lu's disregard.  Only now did he speak.  “Why has Chamberlain Xia not shown himself? Could it be that he is aware of his grave sins and is too ashamed to face anyone?”</p><p>Si Lu’s gaze turned icy.  “Chamberlain Xia has important matters to attend to. What qualifications do you have, a treacherous and deceitful villain who relies only on schemes and conspiracies, to demand an audience with Chamberlain Xia?”</p><p>King Lu gave a faint smile, cupping his hands towards the heavens, his righteousness overflowing.  “The principles of Heaven and Earth reside in the hearts of the people!  All that I have done is selfless. Preventing your rebellion is solely to avoid internal strife within our clan, so that our Si You Clan can enjoy lasting stability! Fortunately, King Yan met an untimely demise before his treacherous plot could succeed, preventing a grave disaster. I cannot allow this lingering poison to harm future generations, and thus I had no choice but to resort to this course of action. This time, I have come under the decree of the Si Emperor to subdue the remaining rebels! Surrender now!”</p><p>As he reached the end of his speech, King Lu’s voice boomed like the shattering of heaven and earth, echoing through the void.</p><p>This earth-shaking roar greatly boosted the morale of the Si You Clan army, who erupted in shouts.</p><p>“Surrender!”</p><p>“Surrender!”</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, their clamor almost overwhelmed the rumbling of the Thunder Marsh.</p><p>Accused so unjustly by King Lu, Si Lu flew into a rage, his teeth gritted. “My father never plotted rebellion!  You coveted the Mirage Tower and poisoned my entire clan! Yet you dare deceive the Si Emperor and slander my father! Your crime deserves death!”</p><p>King Lu remained unmoved, calmly stating, “King Yan’s treason is undeniable. Cease your futile denials!  If you have a clear conscience, why don’t you return with us to the clan and defend your father before the Si Emperor?”</p><p>Si Lu looked towards the Grand Preceptor.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor nodded.  “Indeed. I am acting on the Sacred Decree to bring you and Chamberlain Xia back to the palace. If you feel you have been wronged, come with me. If your innocence is proven, the Si Emperor will surely uphold justice for you. Right and wrong will be revealed!”</p><p>King Lu wore an expression of absolute righteousness as he continued to persuade.  “The masterminds are Chamberlain Xia and King Yan. If the investigation reveals your involvement is minimal, considering the Yan Shan Si family is one of the four great royal families, you may yet be spared. However, if you remain stubbornly defiant, you will face utter destruction, and your remaining clansmen will suffer as well! The Si Emperor, in his benevolence, has not implicated too many.  They still await your return!”</p><p>“Utter destruction!”</p><p>“Utter destruction!”</p><p>…</p><p>The cries of the Si You Clan army surged like a tsunami, assaulting Si Lu’s mind. King Lu’s threat, using the surviving members of the Yan Shan Si family, was undeniably ruthless.</p><p>At this moment, the Qin Sang manifestation, formed from the power of thunder, interjected. “When King Yan’s body was still warm, the Lu family secretly administered poison, plotting to annihilate the entire Yan family. This demonstrates their venomous hearts!  If we were to believe you two, we would likely be ambushed and killed before even reaching the Si You Clan.  Then, with no witnesses left, the Lu family could do as they pleased!”</p><p>Si Lu clenched his fists, his rage sharpening his mind.</p><p>Their appearance served two purposes: to assess the strength of the Si You Clan army and to observe the Grand Preceptor’s stance.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor’s few words revealed crucial information.</p><p>The Si Emperor hadn't publicly condemned the Yan Shan Si family. The Grand Preceptor’s presence here didn’t necessarily mean he would side with the Han Jiang Lu family.  Of course, if they were easily defeated, or even just at a disadvantage, the Grand Preceptor would certainly join forces with King Lu to eliminate the remnants of King Yan’s faction, solidifying the accusation of rebellion against the Yan Shan Si family.</p><p>With this crucial information confirmed, the pressure on Si Lu lessened considerably.  He spoke coldly. “I swore an oath that I would repay the Lu family tenfold, a hundredfold, for what they have done!  I will avenge my father and clear his name with my own hands.  This blood feud is not for others to settle!”</p><p>With that, Si Lu, without hesitation, turned resolutely and disappeared into the depths of the Thunder Marsh, leaving behind a resolute figure.</p><p>The smile on King Lu’s face faded, and he uttered a chilling remark. “He courts his own destruction.”</p><p>“King Lu speaks with such grandiosity, treating this humble Daoist as if I were nothing!”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed loudly, his voice resonating with power. “This humble Daoist is eager to experience King Lu’s methods.  If you wish to take away these two Daoist friends, you must first get past me!”</p><p>'Crack!' The manifestation suddenly shattered, dissolving into several bolts of lightning.</p><p>'Rumble!' The lightning flashed faster, the thunder roared louder.</p><p>In the eyes of the Si You Clan army, the void was filled with countless bolts of lightning, endlessly roaming. From their birth to their extinction, they carried terrifying power.</p><p>If they forced their way in, no one was confident they could escape unscathed. Those with weaker cultivation might not even withstand a single bolt.</p><p>The dazzling radiance of the lightning stung their eyes.  It was as if nothing else existed between heaven and earth, all destroyed beneath the might of the thunder.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh became an insurmountable chasm, lying before the Si You Clan army, blocking their path.</p><p>King Lu took a long look before turning to the Grand Preceptor. “Can we first anchor the Eight Extremes Diagram of Unending Stability here?”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor immediately grasped King Lu’s intention.  It seemed he wasn't planning a direct assault, but rather intended to rely on the Eight Extremes Diagram, advancing steadily and methodically breaking the formation.</p><p>After surveying the surroundings and sensing the area, the Grand Preceptor nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>Until now, the Grand Offering had remained silent.  He finally spoke, asking, “Grand Preceptor, when you activate the Eight Extremes Diagram, how far can its power extend? If any of our men encounter danger within the formation, could we request you to activate the diagram to rescue them from within the formation?”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor’s lips moved slightly, but no sound emerged. He communicated with the Grand Offering through sound transmission.</p><p>The Grand Offering nodded repeatedly, finally cupping his hands. “I'll trouble you then, Grand Preceptor.”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor returned the gesture, then, after a brief appearance, vanished into the shadows.</p><p>A moment later, the land trembled slightly, rapidly descending before hovering three hundred zhang above the sea.</p><p>Following this, the land radiated a profound yellow light, penetrating the seabed.  Waves surged on the sea’s surface, water churning, as if something was about to erupt from the depths.</p><p>‘Splash!’  A massive wave soared into the air, and a mountain peak emerged from the sea.  The peak continued to grow, eventually connecting with the land, becoming a celestial pillar supporting it.</p><p>Subsequently, mountain peaks rose from the sea one after another, until a total of eight extraordinary peaks stood tall above the waves.</p><p>Instantly, everyone felt a sense of stability. The land beneath their feet became much firmer. However, this wasn't due to the support of the celestial pillars but rather an indescribable feeling.</p><p>King Lu didn't act rashly, leading everyone back to the imperial carriage.</p><p>Yuan Miao knew that the subsequent discussions would involve military strategy and the Lu family's secrets, and he wouldn't be allowed to listen.  He flew towards a mountain peak where he had a cave dwelling.</p><p>After the Grand Preceptor deployed the Eight Extremes Diagram, he could no longer leave freely. As long as King Lu didn't break the agreement, he could do nothing but observe.</p><p>From within the imperial carriage, they could clearly see the lightning dancing across the horizon.</p><p>King Lu looked around at the assembled cultivators. “The enemy has set up their formation. Who is willing to venture forth and probe the formation’s depths?”</p><p>They intended to advance step by step, but that didn't mean they could truly afford to be slow.</p><p>This expedition had a time limit. The Zhu Yan Clan wouldn't permit another clan's army to remain indefinitely within their territory.</p><p>The ancient covenant included time restrictions.</p><p>The time limit began the moment they set foot on Zhu Yan Clan territory. As of today, they had only three years remaining.</p><p>They had to defeat their opponents within three years.  This was their only chance.</p><p>If Si Lu escaped from Zhu Yan Clan territory within these three years, he couldn't return and would no longer be under the Zhu Yan Clan's protection. Similarly, if they couldn't capture or kill Si Lu here, they would have to cease their efforts after three years. Otherwise, the Zhu Yan Clan would have grounds to intervene.  They would then have to wait for Si Lu to leave Zhu Yan Clan territory before acting outside.</p><p>Three years – neither long nor short.</p><p>This was a confrontation between armies, not a duel between two individuals.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators could manipulate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. As long as they weren't isolated from heaven and earth, they wouldn't run out of true essence.  Two Void Refinement cultivators of equal strength could fight for a year or two without a decisive outcome.</p><p>Wars between mortals often lasted for years, let alone when both sides possessed peak experts.  Of course, cultivators could fly and teleport. In the world of cultivation, once one side fell into a disadvantage, victory or defeat could be swift.</p><p>Three years might not even be enough to decipher the patterns of the enemy's formation.</p><p>King Lu and the Grand Offering suspected that Si Lu dared to remain because he intended to employ this strategy.</p><p>Chamberlain Xia hadn't appeared yet, and his fate was unknown. Based on the intelligence from their informants and the Grand Offering’s assessment of Chamberlain Xia, despite their apparent confidence, Si Lu and that Daoist Qin might not actually possess the strength to contend with them.</p><p>However, precisely because of this uncertainty, the Grand Offering couldn’t be certain that Chamberlain Xia had perished.  This ambiguity, combined with a sufficiently complex formation, could delay them for three years, forcing the army to retreat and allowing Si Lu to rest easy.</p><p>“I am willing to go!”</p><p>Before the words had fully faded, a figure leaped forward. It was Lu Gan.</p><p>Lu Gan had been forced to retreat by Qin Sang, who was a realm lower than him, and had been compelled to use the Mutual Transformation Technique, escaping injured.  This was a great humiliation for him.</p><p>At the time, one of his four companion beasts was missing, greatly diminishing the power of his ultimate move. Otherwise, the outcome of the battle was uncertain.  This time, with the Eight Extremes Diagram of Unending Stability providing external support, he could finally unleash his full power and avenge his previous disgrace.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as he stepped forward, the Grand Offering shook his head, saying, “Not suitable!”</p><p>Lu Gan dared not question the Grand Offering and bowed his head respectfully to listen. The Grand Offering continued, “Among our ranks, those who surpass you in strength are few.  If you are sent for the first battle, who should we choose next? Moreover, the Grand Preceptor will not personally participate. Someone must preside over the Eight Extremes Diagram, ready to rescue anyone at any time. This task is most suitable for you. The outcome of a single battle is inconsequential. A gradual approach is the best strategy…”</p><p>As he spoke, the Grand Offering turned his gaze to the side.</p><p>Two figures sat there, both in elegant robes, with dignified appearances.</p><p>Their appearances were dissimilar, one delicate and the other robust, yet their auras were remarkably similar, like a Daoist couple.</p><p>In reality, they weren't Daoist partners and had no blood relation, but they were closer than family.</p><p>They cultivated the same cultivation method, yet unexpectedly developed two distinct temperaments, and discovered they complemented each other.  They had been inseparable ever since, changing their names to Shi Mu and Shi Ying, which sounded like siblings.  Their true names were unknown.</p><p>Later, both broke through to the second level of the Void Realm, achieving considerable renown.</p><p>They weren’t subordinates of King Lu but more like rogue cultivators.  They had come at the Grand Offering's invitation.</p><p>There were several others like them.  The cultivators were divided into two circles.  The innermost circle naturally consisted of King Lu’s confidants, while Shi Mu and the others were in the outer circle, not voicing their opinions.</p><p>The Grand Offering looked at the two. “For the first battle, could I request the two Daoist friends to take action?”</p><p>Shi Mu and Shi Ying exchanged glances, then rose and spoke in unison.  “Very well!  We shall undertake this first battle!”</p><p>If the enemy intended to prolong the conflict, the first battle was often the safest.  They readily agreed.</p><p>King Lu was delighted.  “Then I'll have to trouble the two of you. Lu Gan!”</p><p>“I am here!”  Lu Gan knew he wouldn't be able to fight for the time being, so he set aside those thoughts and bowed in response.</p><p>“By my decree, the Nine Jade Division shall be placed under the command of Daoist friends Shi Mu and Shi Ying. Follow them into the formation and obey their commands!  Anyone who dares to defy this order will be executed without mercy!”</p><p>“By your command!”</p><p>Lu Gan immediately withdrew from the imperial carriage.</p><p>The Lu family army was divided into divisions named after the Lu family’s territories.  Aside from the two divisions serving as King Lu’s personal guard, each division possessed comparable strength.</p><p>Since they were going to assault the formation, they couldn't send Shi Mu and Shi Ying alone. They needed men under their command.</p><p>In a short while, banners fluttered outside the imperial carriage, a vast expanse of black.</p><p>The Nine Jade Division was clad in black helmets and armor, their morale high and discipline impeccable.  Even the lowest-ranked soldier was at the fourth level of the Origin Realm. They were fully equipped with magical treasures and proficient in various battle formations, capable of handling diverse situations.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Shi Mu and Shi Ying felt a pang of envy.  It wouldn't be difficult for them to train a division like the Nine Jade Division, but the Nine Jade Division was just one of many under King Lu's command. The foundation of these aristocratic royal families was truly profound.</p><p>It was no wonder that among rogue cultivators, those who made a name for themselves were often absorbed into the imperial family or the four great royal families.</p><p>“I wish you a triumphant return!”</p><p>King Lu raised a flask of spirit wine in a toast to their success.</p><p>The two drained their flasks in one gulp.  With a single command, the army set off like a black torrent, surging out from the land and advancing towards the Thunder Marsh, fearless and resolute.</p><p>Lu Gan also began to act, flashing towards the highest peak at the center of the land. There, a clear pool existed, its water reflecting the sky like a mirror.</p><p>Arriving above the clear pool, Lu Gan sat cross-legged in mid-air, his clothes untouched by the water.  His reflection appeared in the pool. Then, the water rippled slightly, and the reflection shattered into countless fragments, vanishing abruptly.</p><p>At the same time, in other corners of the land, cultivators from the various divisions of the Lu family began to cast spells.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Gan clearly sensed a vast and mighty force. This force didn't belong to him, yet he could control it.</p><p>There was no need for familiarization. This power was incredibly obedient, submitting to his will.</p><p>Quickly mastering this power, Lu Gan directed his will forward, and Shi Mu and the others appeared within his 'vision.'</p><p>With a thought, an invisible wave spread outward, remotely empowering Shi Mu and the others, establishing a connection between them and the Eight Extremes Diagram.  This would allow their locations to be pinpointed within the enemy formation, enabling timely rescues.</p><p>The cultivators of the Nine Jade Division were completely unaware.  Only Shi Mu and Shi Ying's expressions shifted slightly, sensing a subtle change. To ensure their safety, they each left behind a companion beast.  Furthermore, with the protection of the Eight Extremes Diagram, their lives were certainly secure. They then charged into the formation with confidence.</p><p>Within the Thunder Marsh, Qin Sang gazed westward, calmly stating, “They've come.”</p>
