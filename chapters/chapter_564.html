Chapter 557: Nascent Soul Gathering


Outside the Pass.

Qin Sang followed the sound and immediately saw Chen Yan in her cloak.
Chen Yan stood alone at the edge of a restrictive barrier, gazing at the surging spiritual tide outside.  She exuded an aloof aura, her expression hidden beneath the cloak. No one dared approach her.

To Chen Yan's left, a man in brocade robes and a Daoist priest with a long beard were conversing.
These two showed no signs of spiritual power, easily mistaken for ordinary mortals.

With Qin Sang's current cultivation, even when facing Golden Core cultivators, he could sense faint traces of True Essence unless they deliberately concealed it.
It was impossible to encounter mortals here.  This could only mean their cultivation far surpassed his own!

The moment he saw them, Qin Sang's heart tightened, feeling an inexplicable pressure.
They stood before the barrier, the terrifying spiritual tide causing it to tremble incessantly, as if it would burst through at any moment. Yet, the two remained calm and collected, seemingly oblivious to the tide.

It was the brocade-robed man who spoke.
Grand Patriarch Dongyang!
Qin Sang's heart stirred with emotion.  Nearly a century after joining the sect, he finally saw his Grand Patriarch in person.

The other person, able to stand as an equal with Grand Patriarch Dongyang, must also be a Nascent Soul Grand Master.  He wondered if it was Grand Patriarch Chongyi of the Taiyi Pill Sect, or perhaps Tie Guanzi, the Palace Lord of the Shangyuan Serenity Palace.

With Grand Patriarch Dongyang having spoken, the Golden Core cultivator surnamed Liu dared not cause further trouble. He obediently responded and immediately granted passage.

Qin Sang and the others followed Master Fengming, quickly stepping forward and bowing deeply to Grand Patriarch Dongyang.  "Disciple greets Grand Patriarch!"

"Rise."
Grand Patriarch Dongyang nodded slightly and said indifferently, "Fengming, take them to the side and wait."

"Yes!"
Qin Sang obediently retreated to the side, discreetly observing those present.
Yun Youzi hadn't arrived yet. Besides Grand Patriarch Dongyang, Chen Yan, and the mysterious Daoist priest, the rest were Golden Core cultivators.

Among them were a few he had seen in the Chaotic Isles, some from the Taiyi Pill Sect, and more from other sects stationed at the Hanging Skull Pass.

Surprisingly, only Master Fengming was present from Shaohua Mountain, and none from the Shangyuan Serenity Palace, which puzzled Qin Sang.
Qi Yuan Shou had only recently formed his Golden Core, so it was understandable that he wasn't at the Violet Firmament Palace.
But the other Masters were all established Golden Core cultivators.  Were none of them going to the Violet Firmament Palace?

While Qin Sang was observing the situation, the Daoist priest also glanced at them with some confusion. However, he didn't directly question Grand Patriarch Dongyang's intentions.  Instead, he asked indirectly, "Fellow Daoist Dongyang, with so many Pseudo Core disciples, do you still have the energy to protect other disciples? The Shangyuan Serenity Palace disciples, and those from the sects under your command, also need your protection, right?  Have they all found Violet Firmament Tokens?"

Grand Patriarch Dongyang smiled faintly.
"Fellow Daoist Chongyi, haven't you noticed I only brought two disciples?
"To ensure fairness, powerful sects like ours cannot excessively participate in the competition for Violet Firmament Tokens. I wouldn't put myself in the crosshairs.
"Fellow Daoist Tie Guanzi wishes for his sect to recuperate and cultivate.  He will be venturing into the Violet Firmament Palace alone this time. With his strength, I need not worry.
"I have a way for these five to combine their powers, exceeding their individual cultivation levels.
“As for the juniors from other sects, there won't be too many. I'll do my utmost to protect them."

Grand Patriarch Chongyi nodded, then suddenly seemed to recall something. He said in surprise, "Fellow Daoist Tie Guanzi leaving the Shangyuan Serenity Palace alone... is it almost time...?"

Grand Patriarch Dongyang sighed softly. "Indeed, Fellow Daoist Chongyi remembers correctly."

Grand Patriarch Chongyi lamented, "Fellow Daoist Tie Guanzi's chances of forming his Nascent Soul were originally quite high, especially with the Shangyuan Serenity Palace's unique talismans.  Certainly no less than ours back then.  Yet, to protect his sect, he chose to sever his path to Nascent Soul, resolutely sacrificing himself to nourish the talisman puppet.  Admirable indeed.  Venturing alone into such a dangerous place, he must be determined to succeed or die trying.  But what are his chances?"

Grand Patriarch Dongyang shook his head. "From what I know, Fellow Daoist Tie Guanzi has embraced death. Before leaving, he passed the position of Palace Lord to his junior brother, Gong Liangyu..."

Before he could finish, a streak of azure light suddenly arrived.
Cultivator Liu stood respectfully at the city gate, not daring to obstruct it. Instead, he said respectfully, "Greetings, Senior Tie Guanzi."

The azure light dispersed, revealing a thin figure with an abnormally pale complexion.  Such a pallor on a cultivator of such high standing was truly unexpected.

Tie Guanzi nodded to Cultivator Liu and walked towards the two Nascent Soul Grand Masters, cupping his hands in greeting. "Tie Guanzi greets the two seniors."

Qin Sang discreetly observed Tie Guanzi, filled with curiosity.
Judging by Tie Guanzi's words and actions, he didn't seem like he was facing two cultivators of the same realm, but rather like a junior. Could it be that Tie Guanzi wasn't truly a Nascent Soul Grand Master?
The secrets within this were beyond his comprehension.


"Palace Lord Tie, there's no need for formalities."
Grand Patriarch Chongyi and Grand Patriarch Dongyang both returned the greeting.

After Tie Guanzi arrived, more people gradually appeared, most holding Violet Firmament Tokens.

Finally, Qin Sang saw Yun Youzi hurrying over.
Yun Youzi seemed to be quite well-known within the Taiyi Pill Sect. His appearance not only surprised Cultivator Liu and the others but also attracted Grand Patriarch Chongyi's attention, who called him over.

"Are you a disciple of my sect? Why aren't you diligently cultivating within the sect, preparing for Golden Core formation, instead of putting yourself in danger?"

Yun Youzi bowed respectfully and replied calmly, "Responding to Grand Patriarch, this disciple wishes to seek a certain spiritual herb in the Violet Firmament Palace."

Grand Patriarch Chongyi frowned slightly but didn't pursue the matter further. He simply said, "Stay by your Master Liu's side.  There's no need to stand with those rogue cultivators."
…
After Yun Youzi arrived, significantly fewer people came.
Soon after, Granny Jing also arrived.

Qin Sang, who had been anxiously waiting, finally relaxed.
Granny Jing still appeared as an elderly woman, very inconspicuous. None of the cultivators present seemed to recognize her.

Granny Jing displayed her Violet Firmament Token, glanced at Qin Sang, and then found an unoccupied corner, leaning on her cane with her eyes closed.

After another hour, as dusk approached and it was past the first half of the You hour (5-7 pm), two more Golden Core rogue cultivators arrived late.
Grand Patriarch Dongyang surveyed everyone and said in a deep voice, "The time has come!  If any of you are still hesitant, now is your last chance. Once we leave the Hanging Skull Pass, there is no turning back!"

A murmur went through the crowd, but no one spoke.
Grand Patriarch Dongyang nodded to Grand Patriarch Chongyi.  Grand Patriarch Chongyi gently raised his hand, and a jade ruyi flew out from his sleeve. The ruyi spun in the air, growing larger and larger until it was the size of a flying ship.

Grand Patriarch Chongyi's figure flickered and vanished.
Then, Grand Patriarch Chongyi's voice came from above.
"Come aboard!"
Everyone was astonished by Grand Patriarch Chongyi's exquisite teleportation technique. They didn't dare hesitate and flew into the air.  The jade ruyi, despite holding everyone, still seemed quite spacious.

"Fellow Daoist Dongyang, I will lead the way at the front. How about you take charge at the rear?" Grand Patriarch Chongyi asked.
