<h1>Chapter 385: Until We Meet Again</h1><p>Chapter 385: Until We Meet Again</p><p>This flying night yaksha, corresponding to the description in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, is a flying night yaksha that has evolved from a Foundation Establishment-level corpse.</p><p>Ghost Hand's sudden pause was Qin Sang attempting to influence its actions using the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>A flying night yaksha is equivalent to a Golden Core-level corpse.</p><p>Of course, a flying night yaksha is certainly weaker than a true Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>The *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* forcibly elevates Foundation Establishment cultivators into flying night yakshas, resulting in inherent deficiencies.</p><p>But it can definitely easily defeat cultivators at the Fake Golden Core stage.</p><p>The previous encounter demonstrated this. Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's combined sword attack was easily shattered by the flying night yaksha's punch—the difference in strength was too vast.</p><p>Despite being prepared, their escape was perilous, several times narrowly avoiding being knocked from their flying boat within the passage.</p><p>Facing this level of corpse, Qin Sang wasn't certain he could still influence it with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>After testing, Qin Sang found that when fully concentrating his spiritual sense to control the talisman, he could indeed slightly impede the flying night yaksha's movements.</p><p>Although this effect was very limited, and Qin Sang couldn't use it consecutively, it proved to be a crucial tactic in intense combat.</p><p>The Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat landed in a safe place, and the flying night yaksha didn't pursue them.</p><p>Yun Youzi waited expectantly, not daring to disturb Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang formed a plan.  "Senior, this being does indeed have some connection to the secret technique I possess, and I can influence it, but I need to test it a few more times…"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Yun Youzi implicitly trusted Qin Sang and had no objections. The two rested briefly before returning to the entrance of the ice palace.</p><p>After several more attempts, Qin Sang understood the flying night yaksha better.</p><p>The flying night yaksha's most notable ability was its mastery of Five Elements Escape Techniques, making it elusive. However, due to the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Qin Sang could use it to detect the yaksha's movements as it approached.</p><p>Furthermore, its physical body was incredibly strong and resilient, with exceptional regenerative abilities.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword could only inflict minor wounds, instantly healed by the surging earth煞 energy. Qin Sang couldn't possibly deplete the flying night yaksha's earth煞 energy.</p><p>However, his goal wasn't to kill it, so this didn't matter much.</p><p>What was most terrifying was the corpse poison. Qin Sang was determined not to be injured by it.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally rehearsed countless times, thinking that delaying for fifteen breaths might be feasible, but surpassing the flying night yaksha to reach the inner chamber to find the corpse and relics would be a suicidal mission.</p><p>The inner chamber containing the flying night yaksha was deep within the ice palace, its depth unknown.</p><p>Such a long distance meant Qin Sang couldn't simultaneously fight the flying night yaksha and use the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman to escape. Even if he managed to get inside, he would be trapped and killed.</p><p>Unless he found another way...</p><p>Qin Sang immediately thought of the two remaining corpses in his Corpse Puppet Pouch: one煞 corpse and one living corpse.</p><p>Within a certain range, he could sense their surroundings through his soul imprint, allowing them to enter the chamber as substitutes.</p><p>However, this meant certain death for the corpses, impossible to escape the flying night yaksha's clutches.</p><p>The煞 corpse was fine, but living corpses were incredibly difficult to cultivate—losing one was painful.</p><p>This was a gamble using precious corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate long.  There was gain in sacrifice. Obtaining the secret technique to create a flying night yaksha was worth losing a living corpse.</p><p>Returning here wasn't easy; Yun Youzi's preparations were exceptionally complex, and Qin Sang had no confidence in replicating them.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang made his decision, nodding to Yun Youzi, signaling his readiness.</p><p>Yun Youzi, though resolute, felt a tremor of anxiety. He bowed slightly and said gravely, "Brother Qin, I've left a message with my sect. If I don't return, take this token to the Taiyi Danzong. I leave you these few belongings as a token of my gratitude.  I hope you won't refuse… I entrust my future to you!"</p><p>"Senior, rest assured, I'll do my utmost!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was solemn, suddenly feeling an immense weight on his shoulders.</p><p>Yun Youzi turned, gazing at the end of the passage, at the silent ice palace, which resembled a beast's gaping maw, waiting to devour any intruder.</p><p>Lost in thought.</p><p>Yun Youzi was lost in thought for a moment, then smiled with relief. He raised his hand, and a flawless pearl flew out, emitting a bright light.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed a surge of powerful demonic energy from the pearl, secretly wondering if this peculiar artifact had other abilities.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's curiosity, Yun Youzi explained, "The Nine-Flower Frost Grass isn't entirely useless. My improved cultivation allows me to utilize the pearl's abilities more effectively.  With the pearl and these artifacts, we should be able to evade the creature's senses for a short time."</p><p>Yun Youzi then produced two strange, silver, cone-shaped artifacts.</p><p>"Qin, I'll go ahead!  May we meet again!"</p><p>Before his words faded, Yun Youzi vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally calculated the time.  Moments later, Yin energy surged from his palm, and ten ghost banners slowly materialized.</p><p>As Qin Sang changed his hand seals, the Ten Directions Yama Banners unfolded, spinning rapidly around him, emitting ghostly wails.  Finally, they formed an array, gathered before him, ready for deployment.</p><p>Only the Ten Directions Yama Array could restrain the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>He had tested the effectiveness of the Yin Soul Threads against the living corpses in the Heavenly Corpse Cave. Now, with all ten Yama Banners assembled, the array's power was greatly enhanced, and its effect would be even more significant.</p><p>This array, combined with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, was the source of Qin Sang's confidence.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang slapped his corpse puppet bag.  The煞尸 (sha shi) and living corpses stood behind him, following closely.</p><p>They were too fragile to engage the Flying Night Rakshasa directly. Qin Sang didn't plan to use them to fight it, but to send them in to search for the corpses and belongings of the Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivators once an opportunity presented itself.</p><p>After Qin Sang set up the Ten Directions Yama Array, the front remained silent.</p><p>This timeframe should have been enough for Yun Youzi to infiltrate the Ice Palace, reach the side chamber, and prepare.  Clearly, Yun Youzi's methods had worked; the Flying Night Rakshasa hadn't detected him.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Sang pushed off the ground, unhesitatingly charging towards the Ice Palace.  In a few flashes, he reached the entrance.</p><p>Before he could steady himself, Qin Sang's expression tightened, a warning flaring in his heart.  He couldn't see through the Flying Night Rakshasa's concealment technique, but through the faint aura of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, he sensed its proximity.</p><p>He deliberately created a commotion to attract the Flying Night Rakshasa, and it worked.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his mouth and let out a long howl, signaling Yun Youzi that he had encountered the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>They had to work together, every second counted!</p>
