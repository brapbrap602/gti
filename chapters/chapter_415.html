<h1>Chapter 408: Escape</h1><p>The great array, though unfinished, brewed a vast and ancient aura.</p><p>The wind and sea were forced back by the array, revealing a large hole.</p><p>This aura transcended anything a Xuan Turtle bloodline could possess, prompting suspicion that the array's final form might evolve into the legendary divine beast, Xuanwu!</p><p>The Thunder Hawk sensed the danger and grew even more frenzied, its lightning mixed with faint blood energy as it burned its life essence!</p><p>Its wings spread wide, feathers bristling, bathed in thunder, it transformed into a thunderbird, its wings commanding thunder, even drawing upon the boundless Xuanfrost killing wind.</p><p>The killing wind and thunder intertwined, ever-changing, countless wind blades and thunderbolts blotting out the sun, raining down on the two masters of the Wuji Sect.</p><p>The robed man focused all his energy on completing the array, unable to move.</p><p>The Wuji Sect master couldn't dodge, raising his sword to his chest, the sword energy forming a giant wall to defend.</p><p>The sword energy wall held only for a moment before being shattered. The Wuji Sect master continued to condense a new wall, but the sword energy grew thinner, unable to hold for long.</p><p>Fortunately, the robed man's Xuan Turtle Shell array was nearing completion.</p><p>The battle's impact was vast; the power of Yuan Ying stage cultivators clashing at full strength was terrifying.</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>Especially on the ice mountain, countless cracks spread visibly, growing denser and denser. The ice mountain shuddered violently, with large and small chunks of ice constantly falling and rolling down.</p><p>Qin Sang reluctantly withdrew his gaze. He longed to witness firsthand the spectacle of a Yuan Ying cultivator's meticulously prepared array clashing with a Thunder Hawk burning its life essence.</p><p>He yearned to see who would ultimately prevail.</p><p>But he dared not stay. Even if the ice mountain hadn't collapsed yet, it was surely doomed, and his escape route would be cut off.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed towards the ice mountain, finding the ice cave he'd entered.  He saw that it had already partially collapsed.</p><p>Turning to glance at the distant battlefield, Qin Sang showed an envious expression, staring intently for a while, committing the scene to memory, before turning and rushing into the ice cave.</p><p>The ice cave was riddled with large cracks. Qin Sang moved nimbly, passing the place where the Nightfall Lilies grew, seeing that the spirit array had been broken and the Nightfall Lilies taken by Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Continuing to flee, he finally reached the ice wall sealed by the restriction.</p><p>With the ice mountain on the verge of destruction, under the pressure of immense natural power, the restrictions on the ice wall were revealed, their light flickering uncertainly, about to be destroyed with the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the restriction, easily breaking it and darting into the ice palace, finding it empty. Yun Youzi hadn't rested there.</p><p>It was likely that Yun Youzi had also sensed the ice cave's changes, unwilling to stay, preferring to find a safer place to refine the Nightfall Lilies.</p><p>This was good; it saved him the trouble of explaining.</p><p>Just as he was about to step into the teleportation array, Qin Sang paused, a sudden thought striking him. He quickly summoned the Five Elements Breaking Spell Sword, stabbing several weak points in the ice wall's restriction.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A fissure suddenly appeared in the ice wall. Qin Sang sheathed his sword and entered the teleportation array.</p><p>After he left, the cold wind finally destroyed the ice wall, sweeping in and destroying the teleportation array as well.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's figure appeared in the side chamber.</p><p>Having left the flying night fork's range, Qin Sang didn't rush to leave. He felt no tremors here, indicating that the great battle wasn't nearby.</p><p>Moreover, the ancient restrictions within the Wuyaya Valley were dense, the space erratic and defying common sense.</p><p>He wondered what methods that senior cultivator had used to leave a teleportation restriction here, capable of traversing the inner valley of Wuyaya Valley, secretly reaching the unknown location of the Thunder Hawk's nest, to steal heavenly treasures.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the ice path, Qin Sang cultivated to restore his Qi Sea. After emerging from meditation, he eagerly opened his storage pouch, taking out the Interminable Blood Mulberry to examine.</p><p>His divine sense probed into the storage pouch, and Qin Sang's expression suddenly froze.</p><p>Along with the Interminable Blood Mulberry, several pieces of spirit wood, which Qin Sang had purchased at a high price in Yinshan Pass and hadn't yet had the Ebony Sword absorb, were also taken out.</p><p>These spirit woods, originally of various shapes and colors, were quite diverse.</p><p>At that moment, two spirit woods, originally green, had turned blood red!  Not only had they become blood-colored wood, but their spiritual essence was completely destroyed, rendering them useless.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had hastily stolen the Blood Mulberry, only managing to toss it into his storage pouch, where it landed between these two spirit woods.  In such a short time, the spreading crimson light had corroded them.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished by the heavy losses, yet simultaneously thrilled by the Blood Mulberry's power.</p><p>He enveloped the Blood Mulberry with spiritual energy.  After a careful examination, he cast numerous seals to contain the crimson light before safely storing it in his pouch.</p><p>He dared not use the Ebony Sword to immediately absorb the Blood Mulberry.  Once refined by the sword, it would transform into a magical artifact, potentially undergoing unpredictable changes and becoming uncontrollable.  He needed to settle down, conduct thorough research, and plan carefully.</p><p>After putting away the Blood Mulberry, Qin Sang checked his storage pouch, a wry smile appearing on his face.  His assistance to Yun Youzi had been unexpectedly fraught with peril, a series of setbacks resulting in significant losses.</p><p>Several useful magical implements were destroyed, his pills almost depleted, and his pouch was almost empty, looking quite meager. His corpse puppet bag was also empty.</p><p>Fortunately, his gains were astonishing. He had learned to wield magical artifacts, gaining a powerful means of self-defense.  The Blood Mulberry resolved his worries; at least until he formed his Golden Core, he wouldn't need to expend resources or search for spirit wood to enhance the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Of course, Wu Shang's letter was also incredibly important. Whether the method worked or not, Wu Shang's guidance at least provided Qin Sang with a path to Golden Core cultivation.</p><p>Thinking of Wu Shang's letter, Qin Sang remembered the Celestial Corpse Talisman still within his soul.  He looked inward.</p><p>Around his soul, a faint yellow light still shimmered. The Heart-Eating Insect lay quietly dormant.  His soul itself seemed unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, then a thought struck him. A Buddha image suddenly appeared, and bright yellow light bloomed within his soul.  Then, wisps of gray energy were expelled and vanished.</p><p>The Celestial Corpse Talisman had been banished by the jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from his soul space, released the seals on his body, opened his eyes, and clenched his right hand. He felt the changes in his body; the corpse transformation had stopped.</p><p>The bloodthirsty urge had lessened, although a faint impulse remained, easily suppressed. Due to the short duration, his corpse transformation was superficial.  According to Wu Shang, a few commonly found herbs with abundant yang energy would restore him.</p><p>Qin Sang thoroughly examined his body, finding no insurmountable problems.  He finally let out a long sigh of relief, relaxed, stood up, and darted towards the outside.</p>
