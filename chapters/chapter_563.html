<h1>Chapter 556: The Hour Has Come</h1><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Myriad-Year Camphorwood to be so rare. It would be difficult to obtain it through trade alone.</p><p>Old Man Eight Swords was right. Obtaining the jade slip opened up another possibility.</p><p>Qin Sang was tempted, but his tone remained reluctant, and he forced a smile. “Senior, you have quite the persuasive methods. I'm almost swayed. However, Senior is only offering a piece of Sky Capital Rock and a jade slip in exchange. Even if the contents of the jade slip are true, I would still have to travel far and wide to find it, and there's no guarantee of success… Senior needs to add something more.”</p><p>“How about adding a Soul-Guiding Herb?”</p><p>Old Man Eight Swords produced a jade slip and a jade box. Inside the box was indeed a complete Soul-Guiding Herb.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and smiled wryly. “Senior seems to know my needs very well.”</p><p>Old Man Eight Swords stroked his beard. “Fellow Daoist, you don't know how long I've been searching for a Purple Star Secret Map. I've spent a great deal of effort to gather the items you need. This is my limit.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, lost in thought.</p><p>It was rare for someone to have all the items he needed. Such an opportunity was not to be missed.</p><p>Judging by Old Man Eight Swords' tone, this was his bottom line. Further haggling might lead to losing out on the bigger picture.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang pushed the Purple Star Secret Map forward and said readily, “Alright! I agree to exchange it for these three items!”</p><p>After the exchange, both parties were satisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang took the items and hurried back to his residence.</p><p>The Sky Capital Rock wasn't large, but it was more than enough to refine the Concentric Rings of Harmony.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully stored the Sky Capital Rock and the Soul-Guiding Herb. Then, he extended his divine sense into the jade slip and examined it carefully.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, thinking that the exchange for the jade slip was worthwhile.</p><p>Old Man Eight Swords, likely fearing Qin Sang's suspicion, had given him the original jade slip. Its contents were complete.</p><p>The jade slip contained not only information about the Myriad-Year Camphorwood but also records of the growing environments and characteristics of dozens of precious spiritual materials.</p><p>For Qin Sang, who had decided to continue studying the art of refining, this jade slip was also a treasure.</p><p>The jade slip mentioned that the companion beast of the Myriad-Year Camphorwood was a type of demonic beast called the Frostfire Sparrow.</p><p>The Frostfire Sparrow resembled a swallow with icy, crystalline feathers. It possessed unique abilities, adept at manipulating ice. With a flap of its wings, it could generate chilling winds that could pierce the soul and erode the bones. Ordinary flames couldn't approach it; they would be extinguished upon contact.</p><p>However, flames that exceeded their capacity became their nemesis.</p><p>The essence of the Myriad-Year Camphorwood was a type of cold jade. The Frostfire Sparrows were drawn to the cold aura it emitted and could sense it from a great distance.</p><p>If they consumed it over a long period, the cold aura of the Myriad-Year Camphorwood could cause the Frostfire Sparrows to undergo a transformation and greatly increase their power.</p><p>Legend had it that the Phoenix would only perch on the Chinese parasol tree, eat bamboo seeds, and drink from sweet springs.</p><p>The relationship between the Frostfire Sparrow and the Myriad-Year Camphorwood was similar.</p><p>Learning that the companion beast of the Myriad-Year Camphorwood was the Frostfire Sparrow, Qin Sang felt cheated.</p><p>The Myriad-Year Camphorwood was rare, and the Frostfire Sparrow was no less so. Qin Sang had never heard of it before.  Only after Old Man Eight Swords mentioned that Frostfire Sparrows had been sighted in the inner valley of the Boundless Valley did Qin Sang relent.</p><p>Qin Sang began to worry again.</p><p>He had gone to the inner valley of the Boundless Valley with Yun Youzi and knew how dangerous it was.</p><p>Moreover, a mature Myriad-Year Camphorwood could easily attract Core Formation stage Frostfire Sparrows. The Nine Nether Demon Fire within the Ten Kings Yama Banner might not be enough to subdue them.</p><p>Fortunately, he had no shortage of magical treasures. He wasn't worried about lacking magical treasures after reaching the Core Formation stage. Refining the Concentric Rings of Harmony wasn't urgent.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang stayed in his residence, studying the art of refining by combining the jade slip and the Wu family's refining insights.</p><p>…</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin!”</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Someone knocked on the door.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Qiu Mubai outside and a glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The Purple Star Palace was finally about to open!</p><p>A month ago, Flying Night Devil's injuries had completely healed, and his strength had returned.</p><p>Opening the door, Ji Qing and the others had also finished their closed-door cultivation. They nodded to each other and headed towards the depths of the residence.</p><p>Arriving at the cave, they didn't see Che Yutao. Instead, a withered old man in a gray-white robe walked out.</p><p>It was Uncle-Master Feng Ming!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the first time he was invited to assist after forming his foundation. Uncle-Master Feng Ming's disciple, Li Zai, had died in the Corpse Cave. Yu Daiyue, as the organizer, incurred Uncle-Master Feng Ming's wrath and was almost expelled from the sect, which led to the later tragedy.</p><p>“Disciple greets Uncle-Master Feng Ming!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to suffer any unwarranted misfortune. He bowed with the others and, seeing that Uncle-Master Feng Ming ignored him, felt relieved.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>Uncle-Master Feng Ming said indifferently, then summoned clouds beneath his feet and transformed into a streak of light, heading straight for the city gate of Skull Ridge Pass.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others quickly followed.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang approached Ji Qing and asked curiously, “Senior Brother Ji, isn’t Uncle-Master Che going to the Purple Star Palace?”</p><p>Ji Qing responded, “Master will remain to guard Skull Ridge Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. For cultivators like Che Yutao, whose path was clear and bright, there was indeed no need to take risks.</p><p>He wondered how many other Uncle-Masters besides Uncle-Master Feng Ming were going with them and if Qi Yuanshou had arrived.</p><p>Uncle-Master Feng Ming's speed was extremely fast. Qin Sang and the others chased with all their might, finally reaching Skull Ridge Pass.</p><p>Arriving there, they saw that the city gates, which had been closed for most of the year, were wide open. The barrier outside the pass bulged outward in a semicircle. In the distance, they could see more than a dozen figures standing there.</p><p>A Core Formation cultivator from the Taiyi Pill Sect stood before the gate.</p><p>At that moment, a sword light flew from the east city wall, arriving at the city gate before them. It was Old Man Eight Swords.</p><p>The sword light dissipated, revealing the true forms of eight small flying swords, neatly circling Old Man Eight Swords' dantian. The swords formed a lotus shape, then quickly closed and were absorbed into his body, a very impressive display.</p><p>“Eh? Fellow Daoist Eight Swords, what are you doing here?” The Golden Core guarding the gate recognized Old Man Eight Swords.</p><p>Old Man Eight Swords took out the Purple Star Secret Map and said with a bow, “Fellow Daoist Liu, I came for the Purple Star Secret Map. Fortunately, I didn't make this trip in vain.”</p><p>After inspecting the Purple Star Secret Map, Fellow Daoist Liu allowed Old Man Eight Swords to enter.</p><p>Feng Ming also arrived.  After Qin Sang and the others caught up, they walked towards the gate, but Fellow Daoist Liu stopped them.</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>Fellow Daoist Liu seemed to have a strained relationship with Feng Ming. He sneered and taunted, “Brother Feng Ming, what is the meaning of this?  Now is the peak of the spiritual tide. Sending your disciples out to their deaths can wait, can't it?”</p><p>Feng Ming snorted and replied, “Nothing good ever comes out of a dog's mouth! They are all going to the Purple Star Palace.”</p><p>“So many Pseudo Core Formation disciples, all going to the Purple Star Palace? Aren't you afraid of losing both your men and your resources?” Fellow Daoist Liu was surprised.  He scrutinized Qin Sang and the others, still unwilling to let them pass easily. “Show me your Purple Star Secret Maps.”</p><p>Just then, a gentle voice came from outside the pass.</p><p>“They don't need Purple Star Secret Maps. I will protect them.”</p>
