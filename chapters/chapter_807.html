<h1>Chapter 799: Celestial Demon Refining Form</h1><p>“Before that, there's something else to do. Given the phenomenon caused by the bone flute, it's best to stay away from other cultivators, find a deserted island…”</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of Thunderclap Island, chose a direction, flew for a long distance, and found a deserted island.</p><p>There were no traces of cultivator activity nearby. Qin Sang landed on the island silently, set up an isolation barrier, and then took out the items.</p><p>Storage pouch, spiral shell, armband…</p><p>Qin Sang was also very interested in the hooked-nose man's wings, but they disappeared when the man died.</p><p>He casually grabbed the storage pouch, swept it with his divine sense, and a surprised expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Given the hooked-nose man's strength, his wealth should have been abundant.</p><p>In fact, there were only some spirit stones in the storage pouch, and then some miscellaneous items, mostly various demon bones. Although they were valuable, they didn't match his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang most wanted to find the hooked-nose man's body refining cultivation method. The fact that this person could cultivate his physical body to such a powerful level was enough to illustrate the value of this method.</p><p>As long as the method was suitable for him, cultivating his body alongside his other practices wouldn't be a bad path.</p><p>But Qin Sang searched everywhere, yet neither the body refining method nor the secret technique for cultivating wings could be found.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed deeper and deeper. Suddenly, he looked up at the spiral shell and grabbed it.</p><p>He discovered a common point: the items in the storage pouch were similar to the spiral shell, all raw materials, without any traces of refinement.</p><p>“This person doesn't rely on magical treasures at all. Could it be that he imitated the ancient body refiners, taking the pure physical cultivation path, not relying on any external objects, and focusing all power within the physical body?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>In ancient times, a hundred schools of thought contended, countless paths competed, and all could achieve amazing results.</p><p>He recalled the giant palm print he saw in the Violet Palace that annihilated the immortal city. Wanderer Yun suspected it was the work of a top-tier body refiner who mastered the great divine power of manipulating heaven and earth.</p><p>Human cultivators are not like demons, without the inheritance of powerful bloodline power.</p><p>In ancient times, secret techniques were numerous, and immortal medicines were readily available. Now, it's very difficult to find even slightly valuable spiritual herbs. The difficulty of taking the pure physical cultivation path has more than doubled.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the spiral shell, figuring out this treasure, and realized his previous guess was correct. The spiral shell was indeed a unique treasure that needed to be charged before use.</p><p>The spiral shell was not artificially refined; it seemed to be the shell of some strange spiral demon.</p><p>By keeping the spiral shell within the body, continuously refining it, and constantly pouring true essence into it, when encountering an opponent, throwing out the spiral shell would unleash astonishing power.</p><p>The power of the spiral shell was closely related to the cultivator's level and the refining time. It wasn't just a matter of pouring true essence into it; it required a complex process, consuming a great deal of effort and refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the spiral shell into his Qi Sea, sensed it for a moment, and immediately felt a wave of fear.</p><p>The hooked-nose man must have used it once before. The refining time this time wasn't long, otherwise, it might have done more than just destroy the Golden Yao Lock.</p><p>Of course, the power of the spiral shell was limited. Even if Qin Sang fully refined it to the maximum extent he could control, it couldn't reach the level of the fire pearl, but it was still astonishing. In a surprise attack, it could directly kill a late-stage cultivator.</p><p>Because the spiral shell was naturally formed, it was difficult to measure its grade, but its value definitely surpassed that of a mid-grade magical treasure.</p><p>The only drawback was that it could only be used once per battle. If it missed, it wouldn't be of much use in the short term.</p><p>Precisely because the spiral shell was naturally formed, Qin Sang encountered no obstacles and easily controlled this treasure, leaving it in his Qi Sea to slowly refine his true essence.</p><p>Besides the spiral shell, a tortoise shell plaque also caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The tortoise shell plaque was the size of a palm. The front had natural lines, while the back was engraved with a few strange runes, clearly added later.</p><p>These runes were strange. Qin Sang couldn't decipher them. Sensing the aura of the tortoise shell plaque, it didn't feel like a human artifact, and this object clearly didn't possess powerful energy, so he put it away.</p><p>In addition, the other materials were also quite valuable. There were several rare items. As a refining master, these things could be put to their greatest use in his hands.</p><p>Putting away the useful items, Qin Sang took a deep breath and grabbed the armband.</p><p>The armband was woven from demon bones and was very hard. Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, channeled sword Qi, and slashed directly at the thickest part of the armband.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The armband shattered, and a cylindrical bone flute fell out.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled silently, took out the original two sections of the bone flute, and brought the two ends close to each other.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The bone flute fused automatically, flashed with flowing light, and then fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed a suspicious look, wondering if he hadn't collected all the fragments yet. He thought for a moment and tried to channel his divine sense and true essence into it.</p><p>The next moment, an astonishing scene occurred.</p><p>The bone flute trembled suddenly, then shone brightly like stars, extremely dazzling, almost breaking through the isolating spiritual formation.</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Before he could do anything, the starlight suddenly condensed.</p><p>A text composed of starlight appeared in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qin Sang moved the bone flute, and the text rippled like water, moving along with it, while the bone flute itself still didn't display any powerful energy. He understood that the bone flute wasn't some supreme treasure, but something similar to a jade slip, with this text sealed inside.</p><p>A jade slip, divided into three fragments, thousands of miles apart, was quite strange.</p><p>Since it wasn't a supreme treasure, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. He focused his gaze on the text and soon discovered with surprise that this text was actually written in demon script!</p><p>After the Boundless Sea connected with the Demon Sea, human cultivators had also found demon secret realms and ancient treasures in the Demon Sea, so they were no strangers to demon script and had studied it in depth in conjunction with ancient texts.</p><p>For convenience, Qin Sang had also learned some, although very superficially. Understanding the entire text was difficult, but he could barely make out a part of it.</p><p>“Called Celestial Demon Refining Form… borrowing the power of the celestial stars to temper oneself… bloodline power refines stellar煞, also has a refining effect… This is a cultivation method for demons!”</p><p>Qin Sang finished reading the entire text, understood its content, and couldn't help but feel greatly disappointed.</p><p>No wonder the bone flute contained stellar power. The cultivation method was related to the celestial stars, and the bone flute could serve as a guide, helping practitioners get started and draw the power of the celestial stars into their bodies.</p><p>A demon cultivation method, and it required bloodline power to cooperate; humans naturally couldn't cultivate it.</p><p>He never expected that the treasure he obtained after several twists and turns would be a cultivation method that couldn't be cultivated.</p><p>*Celestial Demon Refining Form*, the name itself sounded extremely imposing.</p><p>In ancient times, Celestial Demons were top-tier existences on par with Grand Completion stage cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through it, but he could also confirm that this cultivation method was definitely a top-tier demon cultivation method left over from ancient times, a secret that was once never passed down!</p><p>No matter how good a cultivation method is, if it can't be cultivated, it's no different from a piece of waste paper.</p><p>“Eh? Wait…”</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have discovered something. His gaze suddenly focused, staring intently at the text.</p>
