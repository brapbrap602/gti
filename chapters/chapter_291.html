<h1>Chapter 284: Suspicion</h1><p>Sheng Yuanzi had white hair and beard, his age comparable to Wanderer. He looked like an immortal, ethereal Daoist priest, but his expression and tone held a hint of scorn that belied his demeanor.</p><p>Before Yu Kong could even respond, someone else interjected, “You’re no better than that old ghost Yu, old fella. Fellow Daoists, be wary. Don’t end up getting sold out by these geezers and even counting the money for them.”</p><p>It was Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. According to the information he had obtained, although Yu Kong, Sheng Yuanzi, and Luo Xingnan had left Autumnsky Market together the last time, they had never worked together again afterward. This time, they had arrived separately, acting like they were too old to even bother having anything to do with each other. Yet, their feud ran so deep that they were publicly undermining each other at a crucial moment.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi scoffed and retorted, “You, old ghost Luo, are both the most insidious. From my observations, Daoist Shaw and the others’ deaths last time couldn’t be unrelated to you!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan sneered, “You’re always the first to play thief who cries thief, old fella! And that old ghost Yu is even more like an old dog that barks without biting! If I wasn’t born cautious, I would’ve suspected you two long ago. I might’ve even been swallowed whole by you two!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi’s forehead veins bulged after the exchange. When people pointed at Yu Kong’s nose to insult him, he didn’t show much anger, his tone remaining calm, like he wasn’t the one being called an old dog.</p><p>“Before Daoist Shaw and the others died, I was the only one who had never met with Daoist Shaw. I’m also confused about just what kind of treasure would make you forsake the relationship fellow Daoists should have and ruthlessly kill!”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed. “No matter how much you talk, Yu will no longer trust any of you. Whoever the murderer is, it has nothing to do with Yu. Yu is not young, and he only wants to focus on cultivation to form a golden core as soon as possible. May we all become strangers once again.”</p><p>Yu Kong cupped his hands and turned to speak to Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>“The Spirit Treasure Pavilion that Yu has chosen excels in defensive and trapping techniques, but its offensive power is only medium, so there won’t be any fall guys.</p><p>Of course, the treasures in this Spirit Treasure Pavilion will be inferior to those in the other, more dangerous ones. You’ll have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Fellow Daoists, don’t be swayed by their words. Focus on breaking the formation. When we’re close to the Spirit Treasure Pavilion, You’ll know the truth of Yu’s words. If any fellow Daoist decides to leave then, Yu definitely will not stop them.”</p><p>After speaking, Yu ignored Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, forming a cloud beneath his feet and flying toward the celestial beast pack.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan glared, finding this dull. They each flicked their sleeves and left.</p><p>Having watched a good show for nothing, everyone had different thoughts. Some had worry in their eyes, others remained contemplative, and their thoughts were hard to discern.</p><p>Qin Sang, Wanderer, and Ge Yuan exchanged glances from afar, having gleaned a lot of information from the conversation.</p><p>It seemed that thirty years ago, these three really had had some kind of incident with Shaw Chunhui and the others, resulting in Shaw Chunhui’s death and the three old guys suspecting each other. It was just uncertain if the incident had started over the herb garden or not.</p><p>Unfortunately, the three of them were pretending very well. There was no way to tell who was genuine and who was false.</p><p>It was even possible that neither of them were guilty. The true murderer could be someone else.</p><p>If that was the case, then Qin Sang and Wanderer could only reluctantly accept reality, grab a few random items, and then return to Hanging Sky Pass.</p><p>Under the leadership of an elder, the Foundation Establishment中期 and above experts formed a formation and charged straight into the celestial beast pack.</p><p>The den instantly erupted like a hornet’s nest.</p><p>Flying in the air and running on the ground, countless strange celestial beasts rushed out with a clamor. Qin Sang and his companions didn’t dare slack off either, swiftly brandishing their own artifacts and steeling themselves.</p><p>The battle lasted eight days, and many arriving later joined the fray. An unexpected Foundation Establishment expert even made an appearance, playing a major role.</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s first time experiencing such a large-scale hunt. He collected a number of spirit monsters, which would earn him a tidy sum upon his return.</p><p>At long last, all the celestial beasts were exterminated.</p><p>The cave had shown obvious signs of change three days before. The light was growing dimmer and narrower. Now, at most, it could only shine out about ten feet, completely incomparable to its original aura.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment expert flew to the cave and did a little probing before flashing in. The formation reacted, and the light knifed at him, but it couldn’t harm him. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p><p>So many people can only watch outside, whose could blame them for not being as skilled?</p><p>So they waited for another half a day, until the evening, when the low point of the guarding matrix came!</p><p>Accompanying a roar that shook heaven and earth, trails of meteor-like escape light rose into the sky, competing to fly towards the cave, illuminating it like daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang and others tightly circled around Yu Kong, and before entering the cave, they set up their Origin Return Formation, and others did the same.</p><p>“Everyone, be careful!”</p><p>The cave was close at hand, dark and lightless inside.</p><p>Yu Kong shouted and led everyone to jump into the cave.</p><p>At the moment they fell into the cave, Qin Sang’s eyes were suddenly filled with dazzling white light, and he couldn’t even see the Xiu sisters who were right in front of him. He could only rely on the presence of the Origin Return Formation to sense that the formation was not chaotic.</p><p>Then, a strange force suddenly appeared from all directions, pressing down on them. Qin Sang felt like he had fallen into a swamp, and could hardly move a step.</p><p>Yu Kong was indeed experienced and prepared. The moment the pressure appeared, he released the power that everyone had gathered on him. This power turned into a several-zhang long Qi blade, cutting a path forward.</p><p>At this time, it was impossible to see what was ahead, but everyone could only choose to trust Yu Kong, follow him along the path cut by the saber Qi, and after flying not far, they felt their bodies lighten, and the pressure and light suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Their vision finally returned, and before everyone could look around, Yu Kong’s voice transmission was heard, “We are now in the formation, take the Spirit Pills immediately!”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone took the pills in a hurry, recovering their spiritual power that had just been consumed, then looked around.</p><p>This was a boundless space, where they stood in the void, with no objects up, down, left, or right, and surrounded by hazy cyan Qi. The cyan Qi below seemed a little dim, but was brighter above.</p><p>The entire space was dead silent.</p><p>However, Yu Kong’s expression was solemn, and he said in a deep voice: “This is a wind formation. The cyan Qi may seem calm, but it is likely to be bone-蚀ding wind!”</p><p>“Why can't we see anything?”</p><p>Yue Ya Xian’s slightly wrinkled eyebrows were also a bit charming, and she asked coquettishly: “Senior Yu, what kind of formation did you encounter when you entered the Immortal Mansion last time?”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and said: “No, last time I encountered a fire formation. As soon as I entered the formation, endless flames swept in, as if they were going to burn us to ashes. I’ve also heard that the wind formation is equally violent. I don’t know why, but it is so calm here. It seems that there are new changes.”</p><p>Chapter 284: Suspicions</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi, with his white hair and beard, looked like a Daoist priest with an immortal air, similar in age to Yun Youzi. However, his mocking expression and tone clashed sharply with his otherwise dignified appearance.</p><p>Before Yu Kong could respond, another voice interjected, “Old bull-nose, you’re no better than Old Ghost Yu.  I advise you all to be cautious, lest you be sold by these two old ghosts and still help them count their money.”</p><p>Luo Xingnan had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised.  His previous investigation had revealed that after their last departure from Autumn Firmament Market, Yu Kong and the other two had never collaborated again. Even this time, they were each acting independently, seemingly determined to never cross paths again. He hadn't expected their animosity to be so deep.</p><p>With such a critical situation at hand, they were openly undermining each other.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi snorted coldly, retorting, “Old Ghost Luo, you are the most insidious.  In my opinion, the deaths of Fellow Daoist Shao and the others can't be separated from you!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan scoffed, “Old bull-nose, you always point fingers at others. And Old Ghost Yu is a silent, biting dog! If I hadn't been cautious and suspicious of you two, I would have been swallowed whole and skinned alive by you long ago!”</p><p>…</p><p>After a heated exchange, Sheng Yuanzi's forehead bulged with veins. Despite being insulted to his face, Yu Kong's expression remained calm, and his tone even, as if the “old dog” they were referring to wasn't him.</p><p>“Before Fellow Daoist Shao and the others met their demise, I was the only one who never had any contact with them. I also don't understand what kind of treasure could make you disregard the bonds of fellowship and resort to murder!”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed, “No matter how eloquently you speak, I trust none of you now. Regardless of who the culprit is, it has nothing to do with me.  I'm not young anymore, and I just want to focus on my cultivation and strive to form my Gold Core soon. Let's all forget about each other.”</p><p>Yu Kong cupped his hands, ceasing his argument. Turning to Qin Sang and the others, he said,</p><p>“The Spirit Treasure Pavilion I've chosen specializes in defensive and trapping formations. Its offensive capabilities are only average. There's no possibility of a scapegoat.</p><p>Of course, the treasures within this pavilion are inferior to those in the most dangerous ones.  You all can weigh the pros and cons yourselves.</p><p>Fellow Daoists, don't be swayed by their words. Focus on breaking the formation. When we reach the Spirit Treasure Pavilion, you'll see whether my words are true or false. If any of you decide to withdraw then, I certainly won't stop you.”</p><p>With that, Yu Kong ignored Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, summoning a cloud beneath his feet and flying towards the swarm of Cloud Beasts.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan glared at each other, finding the situation pointless, and flicked their sleeves as they departed.</p><p>Having witnessed this spectacle, everyone had different thoughts. Some showed worry in their eyes, while others appeared unfazed, their thoughts unreadable.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged glances with Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan in the distance. They had gleaned quite a bit of information from the previous conversation.</p><p>It seemed that thirty years ago, something had indeed happened between these three and Shao Chunhui and his companions, leading to Shao Chunhui's death and mutual suspicion among the three old men.  They just didn't know if the catalyst was the medicinal garden.</p><p>Unfortunately, all three of them were putting on a good act, making it impossible to discern who was telling the truth.</p><p>It was even possible that none of them were the culprit, and the killer was someone else entirely.</p><p>If that were the case, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi could only accept reality, grab a few items, and return to Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>At that moment, led by the elder, the cultivators at the mid Foundation Formation stage and above formed a battle formation and charged directly into the swarm of Cloud Beasts.</p><p>The nest erupted into chaos.</p><p>Countless bizarre Cloud Beasts, flying and running, poured out. Qin Sang and the others didn't dare to hesitate, quickly summoning their magical artifacts and bracing themselves.</p><p>The fierce battle lasted for eight days.  Many newly arrived cultivators joined the fray, including a Gold Core cultivator who unexpectedly appeared and played a crucial role.</p><p>It was Qin Sang's first time experiencing such a large-scale hunt. He obtained a considerable number of spirit-infused demonic materials, enough to earn a decent profit upon his return.</p><p>Finally, all the Cloud Beasts were eliminated.</p><p>The subterranean passage had undergone noticeable changes three days prior. The light within had become increasingly dim and weak. Now, it could only reach a height of about ten feet, a far cry from its previous imposing presence.</p><p>The Gold Core cultivator flew to the entrance of the passage, briefly probed it, and then flashed inside. The formation reacted instantly, emitting blade-like rays of light, but none could harm him.  In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p><p>So many people outside could only watch, lamenting their own inferiority.</p><p>After waiting for a long while, until evening, the protective formation finally weakened!</p><p>Accompanied by a deafening roar, streaks of light, like meteors, shot into the air, racing towards the cavern, illuminating the area like daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others, closely surrounding Yu Kong, formed the Guiyuan Formation before even entering the cavern.  Others did much the same.</p><p>"Everyone, be careful!"</p><p>The cavern's entrance loomed, dark and ominous.</p><p>Yu Kong shouted, leading everyone in a leap into the cavern.</p><p>The instant they entered, Qin Sang's vision was filled with blinding white light. He couldn't even see the Xiu sisters right next to him, only sensing their presence through the Guiyuan Formation's energy.</p><p>Immediately after, a strange force pressed in from all directions. Qin Sang felt like he was sinking in quicksand, every movement a struggle.</p><p>Yu Kong, experienced and prepared, channeled everyone's combined power the moment the pressure hit. This power transformed into a massive blade of energy, cleaving a path forward.</p><p>Unable to see what lay ahead, they could only trust Yu Kong, following the path carved by the energy blade. After a short flight, they felt a sudden lightness as the oppressive force, along with the blinding light, vanished.</p><p>Their vision returned, but before they could take in their surroundings, Yu Kong's voice echoed in their minds, "We're inside the formation! Take the spirit pills immediately!"</p><p>Everyone quickly consumed the pills, replenishing their depleted spiritual energy, and then looked around.</p><p>They were in a vast, empty space, standing in the void. Above, below, and all around, there was nothing solid, only a hazy green mist, darker below and brighter above.</p><p>The entire space was deathly silent.</p><p>Yu Kong's expression was grave. "This is the Wind Formation," he said, his voice low. "That green mist may seem calm, but it's likely a corrosive wind!"</p><p>"I can't see anything," Yueya Xian said, a slight frown somehow adding to her allure.  "Senior Yu, did you encounter this formation the last time you entered the Immortal's Abode?"</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head. "No, last time it was the Fire Formation. As soon as we entered, we were engulfed in flames that threatened to incinerate us. I've heard the Wind Formation is just as violent. I don't know why it's so calm here. It seems something has changed."</p>
