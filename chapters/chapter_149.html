<h1>Chapter 142 In Daiyue</h1><p>Three years of nurturing the spirit, two years of refining sword.</p><p>The black iron sword has changed significantly in shape, the sword jaw and sword hilt disappeared. All the impurities on the sword body have been slowly refined by Qin Sang, turning it into a pure sword embryo.</p><p>The sword embryo suspended before Qin Sang, appearing emerald green. The sword body was slender and graceful, extremely exquisite and pure, like a piece of jade, captivating to the eyes.</p><p>This piece is the essence of the magic treasure fragment. It had already been refined by the Golden Core through ritual fire. Qin Sang used his intent to kill and painstakingly polished it for nearly two years. He finally met the requirements of ‘Nurturing Spirit Sword Scripture.'</p><p>The first level of the technique was not difficult, only laying the foundation for cultivating the technique.</p><p>Once the spirit sword was refined, one could inscribe a death talisman on the sword body, and then enter the genuine path of cultivation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not expect to get stuck at the last step.</p><p>In the past two years, he had memorized every stroke of the death talisman. He could imagine it in his mind and it was exactly the same as the one in the scriptures, but he was unable to inscribe it on the sword body. He always felt like something was missing.</p><p>He secluded himself in his cave府for a whole two months. Qin Sang tried everything, but he still made no progress.</p><p>He could not advance in the technique, so his cultivation stagnated. He could not improve.</p><p>Because he had been taken advantage of, his current cultivation was even worse than when he had just broken through the Foundation Establishment period.</p><p>‘Hum hum...'</p><p>As if sensing Qin Sang's restlessness, the black iron sword trembled slightly, emitting a light sword cry. The sword body also emitted a layer of blood-colored light.</p><p>After cultivating ‘Nurturing Spirit Sword Scripture,' the sword Qi of the black iron sword had surprisingly turned into a shocking crimson, bright as blood, with a murderous aura.</p><p>The main body of the black iron sword seemed to have become smaller than before. However, after being refined by the intent to kill, apart from getting rid of impurities, both its power and quality had advanced a level.</p><p>Sword Qi crisscrossed, divine light flashed.</p><p>The sword Qi of the black iron sword was condensed to the extreme. If it erupted completely, then the black iron sword would transform into a blood-red flying sword and completely disappear from view. The outer layer was actually formed by illusory sword Qi. It not only contained a soul-stirring killing intent, the sharpness of the sword Qi was also far greater than before.</p><p>After breaking through the second level of ‘Nurturing Spirit Sword Scripture,' the technique also came with a divine ability: man and sword as one, escaping without a trace.</p><p>Since he had not been able to break through the second level yet, Qin Sang could only guess the effect of this divine ability. It sounded like a kind of sword escape technique, rather than a killing move.</p><p>The flying shuttle could be used for long-distance travel, but its speed was not fast. If he fought with a cultivator of the same level, and the battle turned unfavorable, it would be difficult to use it to get rid of his opponent.</p><p>After the ‘Indicating Profoundness Sword,' was cultivated to completion, one could fly with the sword. Among the various escape techniques, the escape technique of sword cultivators was top-notch.</p><p>In the past five years, Qin Sang had taken advantage of his spare time to cultivate ‘Indicating Profoundness Sword' to success. He had already mastered the sword escape technique from the sword scriptures and hoped that it would not conflict with the divine ability of ‘Nurturing Spirit Sword Scripture.'</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang suddenly remembered his senior brother Gong's exhortation: this technique required an extremely strong intent to kill. Just visualizing the death talisman was not enough. One had to enter the path of killing to be able to gain insight.</p><p>Qin Sang understood somewhat vaguely that visualizing it out of thin air was like fighting a battle on paper, there was always a gap.</p><p>Did he have to gain insight into the path of killing in the midst of battle before he could cast a true death talisman?</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to go out and try it, but he had to choose his opponent carefully.</p><p>If his opponent was too weak, he would be overwhelmed and it probably would not be effective. However, if his opponent was another Foundation Establishment cultivator, his qi sea was not as good as other people's. He had been refining and nurturing his sword for the past five years and had not improved. Even if he had a few magic treasures, it would be difficult to win.</p><p>Furthermore, he could not run into the street and challenge just anyone he met.</p><p>Thinking about this, Qin Sang spent a few days carefully sorting out the few magic spells he mastered. Then he sealed his cave府and returned to Shaohua Mountain for the first time in five years.</p><p>The peach blossoms at Jinguanguan were still in full bloom. Several female disciples greeted him from afar. Qin Sang did not recognize any of them. He did not know if they were new disciples.</p><p>Fortunately, his senior brother Wen was still the manager of Daomenfeng.</p><p>“You've provoked Zhuang Yan.”</p><p>Senior brother Wen poured Qin Sang a cup of spirit tea. When he heard Qin Sang ask about Zhuang Yan, he smiled and said: “The cave府at Dianyun Mountain is not bad. I asked him to go there and look after the medicine garden. He has figured things out and become calmer. For a cultivator, if one cannot even reach Foundation Establishment, even if they can have fun for a while, how long can it last? He himself said that he was embarrassed to see you. He's been in seclusion diligently for the past few years, living in seclusion. A bit like you when you were in the Qi Refining period.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart went to the time in the Earth Hollow, a more deserted time, he shook his head and sighed.</p><p>Who knew that these five years of spirit suffering would give him a sliver of a chance.</p><p>"Senior-apprentice-brother Wen, the purpose of my visit this time is to hone my skills in battle. The best place to do so would be the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, but the place is dangerous for a cultivator at the beginning of the Foundation Establishment stage. Senior-apprentice-brother Qin, you should understand clearly and prepare a few life-saving methods before you go. If you want to do so within the sect, you can go to the Sect Leader and see if he has any demon-slaying missions. In the Cloud Ocean Marshland, there are some beasts in the early Demon Spirit stage that have just gained sentience and unrestrained wildness. They are driven by instinct and occasionally come out to cause trouble. They would be appropriate for you to practice on."</p><p>Senior-apprentice-brother Wen's words matched Qin Sang's thoughts. That was also what he was considering. Magical beasts do not have the strange magical artifacts that human cultivators possess, and even if they have inherent magical abilities, they are usually very simple.</p><p>Qin Sang drank tea with Senior-apprentice-brother Wen for a while, and the two talked about cultivating experiences, which benefited Qin Sang greatly. Qin Sang was about to get up and leave when his expression suddenly changed, and he turned to look at the door of the hall.</p><p>"Swish!"</p><p>A sound of air being torn apart could be heard, then a beam of escape light could be seen rushing forward with great speed. A middle-aged cultivator, in a hurry, with an anxious look on his face, entered the hall with long strides. When he saw Qin Sang, his expression relaxed.</p><p>Senior-apprentice-brother Wen stood up and pushed away his cup, saying with a smile, "Junior-apprentice-brother Yu, you never come here unless you need something. Why do you have the free time to come visit me today?"</p><p>Surnamed Yu?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. When he saw the person, he was slightly shocked as well because he had seen this person before.</p><p>At the time, seven people had entered the Treasure Gourd Illusion. Aside from Qin Sang, Wen Jian, He Mu, Senior-apprentice-brother Gong, and the elder surnamed Zhao, there were also two other middle-aged cultivators.</p><p>However, at the time, only Sect Leader Yu spoke with them using sound transmission, and Qin Sang had not learnt their names. This cultivator with the surname Yu was one of them.</p><p>When Qin Sang saw this person, he thought about the Yu Daiyue that had sent him several sound transmission symbols over the last two years. Could it be him?</p><p>"Senior-apprentice-brother Wen's words are as sharp as ever."</p><p>The cultivator with the surname Yu seemed to be quite familiar with Senior-apprentice-brother Wen. He joked, then looked at Qin Sang without hiding his intentions and said, "You guessed right. I came here this time for another purpose. Junior-apprentice-brother Qin, we haven't seen each other for years. Do you still remember me?"</p>
