Chapter 406: A Calculated Risk


(Happy New Year everyone! Wishing you all good health and happiness!
Unexpectedly, I'm even busier and more chaotic back home.
Updates may be irregular for the next few days, but I'll definitely try to post twice daily.  Thank you for your patience!)

Qin Sang's gaze darted between Pang Ji and Lei Qiu. Pang Ji was already incredibly strong, and could also control Lei Qiu.  A direct assault to snatch the Blood Mulberry would be impossible under Pang Ji's watchful eye.

After a moment's thought, a daring plan formed in Qin Sang's mind.

He activated the Ten Directions Yama Banner, the threads of Yin souls weaving a massive net, waves of black fire surging towards Pang Ji.

Facing the menacing Yin threads, Pang Ji showed no fear.  Its round eyes gleamed with excitement, like a child who'd finally found a new toy.

Standing at the edge of the jade pool, Pang Ji remained unmoving, a miniature general.  It raised a small fleshy wing and pointed at Qin Sang.

Silver light flashed from the wing, and a ball of thunder erupted.

‘Boom!’

The thunder and black fire collided.

Even without using Lei Qiu's power, the peak Yao Ling stage strength was formidable.  Qin Sang exerted all his strength to maintain the formation. The black fire flared, slowly and painfully consuming the thunder.

Just as Qin Sang finally extinguished the thunder, he discovered that Pang Ji had vanished from the edge of the jade pool.

Qin Sang remained calm, instantly and decisively redirecting the Yin threads and black fire to his left.

‘Pop!’

A round figure was blasted from thin air by the black fire, tumbling through the air before landing awkwardly, flapping its small fleshy wings.

Lightning crackled around Pang Ji's feathers; its lightning escape hadn't fully prepared, giving Qin Sang the upper hand.

The black fire intensified, pursuing Pang Ji relentlessly.

Forced to dodge the black fire in mid-air, Pang Ji let out a loud cry.

Countless bolts of lightning suddenly shot from Lei Qiu. But instead of attacking the black fire to rescue Pang Ji, they aimed directly at the Ten Directions Yama formation, targeting Qin Sang.

Pang Ji wasn't stupid; it was employing a strategy of attacking Qin Sang's defenses while he was focused on Pang Ji.

Qin Sang sighed inwardly; his attempt at a flanking maneuver had failed.

The speed of the lightning released by Lei Qiu was incredible. In an instant, it was upon him. Qin Sang was no slouch, however. He decisively abandoned his plan to infiltrate the jade pool and retreated.

Pang Ji, having escaped danger, cocked its little head, seemingly puzzled as to how Qin Sang had discovered its location.

In reality, Qin Sang had observed the Thunder Swallowing Falcon's battle with two Yuan Ying cultivators and fully understood its capabilities. He had anticipated Pang Ji's actions.

Qin Sang’s combat experience far surpassed Pang Ji's. However, the difference in their strength was vast. Pang Ji possessed the cultivation of a powerful beast, with strong innate fighting instincts.

Coupled with Lei Qiu, which disrupted the balance, even superior combat experience couldn't guarantee victory.

Instead of using Lei Qiu to directly attack, Pang Ji tilted its head, spewing a column of lightning before disappearing again.

Qin Sang cursed inwardly. Pang Ji was using him as training, honing its combat skills.

The Red Pill in his hand burned relentlessly, a constant reminder that he couldn't engage Pang Ji indefinitely.

With a thought, Qin Sang stopped dodging and directly used the black fire to clash with Pang Ji.

‘Bang! Bang!’

Loud booms echoed through the cave.

Pang Ji was elusive, living up to its name. Although still a young beast, its control over thunder was masterful – a talent Qin Sang envied.

The Ten Directions Yama formation trembled. Qin Sang stood his ground, acting as a target, enduring Pang Ji’s attacks.

While not using Lei Qiu, Pang Ji's strength was immense.  After only a few blows, the black fire thinned significantly, revealing the core array flags, all of which were violently shaking. The formation was clearly on the verge of collapse.

Pang Ji seemed to be having the time of its life, its calls growing more joyous, its little wings flapping faster as it darted around the Ten Directions Yama formation. However, it remained cautious, keeping a safe distance from Qin Sang.

Just as Pang Ji became overconfident, a phantom sword shadow suddenly appeared from thin air – the Ebony Sword.

Qin Sang had secretly controlled the Ebony Sword, lying in wait. He had finally found his opening, launching it from a treacherous angle.

The flying sword's speed was astonishing. In a flash, it appeared behind Pang Ji’s neck.


A razor-sharp sword energy was about to pierce the soft fluff.

At this critical moment, Fat Chicken remained surprisingly calm. Its round eyes darted around, flashing a cunning glint.  Suddenly, it twisted its head, opened its little yellow beak wide, and unleashed a bolt of lightning that had apparently been building up.

Fat Chicken's timing was impeccable.  The distance was so close that the ebony sword had no way to avoid the lightning, and it was engulfed.

*Boom!*

The ebony sword was knocked away, its spiritual light dimming.  But as the ebony sword was Qin Sang's soul-linked spiritual weapon, its damage affected Qin Sang as well.

A cry of pain was heard. The already weak black fire dissipated significantly, nearly extinguishing.

Qin Sang's figure emerged from the black fire, his face ashen, his breath ragged.  Clearly affected by his weapon's injury, he seemed to struggle to maintain the Ten Directions Yama Formation.

Qin Sang stumbled, glanced at Fat Chicken with a terrified expression, gritted his teeth, hastily gathered his remaining strength, enveloped himself in the Ten Directions Yama Formation, and fled.

Fat Chicken had not only countered the sneak attack but had also turned the tables.  Just as it was basking in its victory, it couldn't let its toy get away so easily.

Without hesitation, it transformed into a lightning bolt, intercepting Qin Sang at a speed even greater than his own.

Almost the moment Fat Chicken materialized from the lightning, the black fire of the Ten Directions Yama Formation spontaneously dispersed.  The bird and the man were very close, their eyes met.

Fat Chicken suddenly realized that the terror on Qin Sang's face was gone, replaced by a playful smirk. His complexion seemed even paler, but his breathing was perfectly steady.

The ebony sword, being a magical artifact meticulously controlled by Qin Sang, wouldn't be so easily damaged. It had all been a feint.

Instinct warned Fat Chicken of impending danger.

But before it could react, a ghostly wail erupted from the black fire, followed by a surge of Nine Nether Demon Flame, far more intense than the black fire, striking Fat Chicken directly.

Fat Chicken, its already large round eyes widening, felt the terrifying aura of the Nine Nether Demon Flame, and an uncontrollable panic spread across its face.

*Whoosh!*

The Nine Nether Demon Flame engulfed Fat Chicken.

Fat Chicken could only manage to activate its lightning power, coating its body.

The Nine Nether Demon Flame, feared even by the Flying Night Yakshas, was far too much for a peak Spirit Transformation stage Fat Chicken to withstand.  Fat Chicken shrieked repeatedly, its cries laced with a whimper.

Qin Sang showed no mercy.  As Fat Chicken cried out, he felt an incredibly powerful and violent force approaching from behind, very close.  If struck by this force, Qin Sang had no doubt he would be instantly obliterated.

Qin Sang was horrified, but thankfully he was prepared. He hastily sidestepped to evade.  But his hands didn't stop moving.  The Sky Poison Gauze appeared in his palm.

Time was of the essence. Qin Sang made a drastic decision, pouring all his spiritual energy into the Sky Poison Gauze, shattering the top-grade artifact.
