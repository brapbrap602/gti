Chapter 433: Uprising


The fleeing figure chose a path that brought him closest to Qin Sang.


As the figure lunged, a blade of energy, faster than the figure himself, sliced towards Qin Sang's face.


This energy was like a tangible blade, a true treasure, reflecting Qin Sang's face on its surface.


Those remaining behind paled.  They hadn't sensed any disturbance and were shocked to find someone hiding underwater.


The blade's power and speed were remarkable.  Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, his gaze unwavering.


Qin Sang watched the approaching energy with a cold stare. He had been the first to detect the figure's presence and was prepared.  His cautious nature wouldn't allow him to be caught off guard without a countermeasure.


*Whoosh!*


Qin Sang moved, easily dodging the energy.  Simultaneously, he spun his left hand, unleashing a dark energy from his Yin-Yang compass towards the fleeing figure.


The figure reacted swiftly, raising his treasured blade to meet the attack.


Unexpectedly, the blade struck the dark energy without shattering, and was still hit by it.


The figure felt a strange repulsive force, his heart sinking. He stumbled, his momentum halted, outwitted by the Yin-Yang compass.


He quickly regained his balance, but the best chance to escape was gone.


Qin Sang put away the Yin-Yang compass and drew his Cold Gold Sword.  Fan Zhen arrived at the same time, deploying his twig-like magical artifact.  Fan Zhen disliked Qin Sang but understood the situation; this wasn't the time for internal conflicts.


The figure's speed plummeted; escape was impossible, now trapped between Qin Sang and Fan Zhen.


During the brief exchange, Qin Sang sensed the figure's high cultivation, possibly at the False Core stage, but also that he was severely injured; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so easily detected.


The Cold Gold Sword moved powerfully, unleashing waves of cold energy.


Fan Zhen's twig artifact transformed into countless tree shadows, closing in on the figure.


*Bang!*


The figure struggled to defend against both attacks. Just as Qin Sang and Fan Zhen were about to subdue him, they heard Cang Ling's cry.


"Brother Xiong, it's you?"


Cang Ling darted between the three, urgently saying, "He's with us!  Fellow cultivators, hold back!"


Qin Sang paused, lowering his sword. Fan Zhen did the same.  Their eyes fell on the figure.


They could now see clearly. The figure wore a black robe, a concealment artifact, though damaged.  He was tall and powerfully built, appearing to be in his forties, with a frighteningly pale complexion and extremely weak aura. Qin Sang's earlier assessment was correct:  he was severely wounded.


"Cough…"


The figure was at his wit's end, barely able to hold his blade.


"He's my fellow cultivator, Xiong Li!"


Cang Ling rushed forward, supporting Xiong Li. "Brother Xiong, how did you get so hurt?"


"Daoist Xiong, my apologies!"


Qin Sang sheathed his sword and bowed slightly.


Initially, they hadn't ruled out the possibility that the figure was a fellow cultivator from the Little Cold Region, but given the dangerous situation, subduing him for interrogation was the safest option.


Xiong Li waved to Qin Sang, questioning, "Junior Brother Cang, why are you here? I thought you were the Celestial Path Alliance's thugs. If only I'd known…"


Cang Ling offered a brief explanation.


"...We were dispatched by Pei Qin and had no choice but to come.  Brother Xiong, were you with Master Fang and the others? Why were you ambushed by the Celestial Path Alliance?"


"It's a long story…"


Xiong Li took a breath.


"We received a secret order to go south on an important mission with Master Fang, but the Celestial Path Alliance discovered our return and laid a trap, pursuing us here.  The enemy was strong, we were outmatched. Master Fang found an opportunity to set up an array, barely holding our ground, but it wouldn't last long. Pei is utterly reckless. The earlier battle was far beyond the capabilities of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Master Fang ordered everyone to scatter and seek reinforcements.  I was targeted by several of the Celestial Path Alliance's thugs, fighting until my energy was completely depleted before barely escaping…"


"So that's it!"


Qin Sang and the others cursed Pei Qin inwardly for his irresponsible actions. Master Fang had already dispersed the Foundation Establishment disciples, yet he had deceived them into a suicidal mission.


With so many Nascent Soul cultivators present earlier, their arrival would have undoubtedly meant certain death.


"We can't stay here. The Celestial Path Alliance is still hunting our fellow cultivators.  Master Fang ordered us to ignore Pei Qin, go quickly!"


Xiong Li glanced at the crimson cloud, urging them repeatedly.


Everyone had long since wanted to leave, and without Xiong Li urging them, they turned and fled.

Qin Sang followed Cang Ling, but he was concerned about what Xiong Li and the others had done, and why it had provoked such a strong reaction from the Tianxing League.

However, Xiong Li was evasive and refused to answer directly.

Seeing this, Qin Sang felt increasingly uneasy. After a moment of contemplation, he bowed slightly to Cang Ling: "Daoist Cang, Qin has important responsibilities to my sect and must return. I must leave now. Farewell."

Those present were jolted back to reality.

Most of them, like Qin Sang, had been assigned here by their sects.

Previously driven by Pei Qin, fearing for their lives, they had been anxious and had forgotten their original tasks.

Now that they were finally safe, Qin Sang's words reminded them of their missions, and they hurriedly took their leave of Cang Ling.

Just as they were about to separate, Xiong Li suddenly opened his eyes and said gravely, "Fellow Daoists, heed my words.  It's best not to remain in this area for the foreseeable future. Get as far away as possible!"

Xiong Li then closed his eyes again and said nothing more.

Qin Sang looked at Xiong Li intently, nodded slightly to Cang Ling, then summoned his cloud steed and sped away to the east.

Even without Xiong Li's warning, he sensed that something was amiss.  The medicinal garden was definitely unsafe; he had to retrieve the herbs and leave immediately.

Many herbs were still unripe, but Qin Sang couldn't afford to be picky.  If this place became a battlefield, even the strongest protections wouldn't save them.

Thinking this, Qin Sang increased his speed, flying as quickly as possible across the water while concealing his presence.

He dared not fly recklessly.  Judging by Xiong Li's tone, they had been pursued by the Tianxing League cultivators after scattering, and the League's forces had also dispersed.  If he was too conspicuous, he might run into them.  Given their superior numbers, if he were surrounded, even his magic treasures wouldn't guarantee his survival.

It seemed a major conflict was imminent.

Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Unfortunately, his cultivation had not yet reached the False Core stage, making it difficult for him to remain safe amidst the chaos. He could only hope Qi Yuan Shou would offer some protection.

After flying for quite some distance, the surrounding waters remained calm, and he encountered no Tianxing League cultivators.

However, at that moment, Qin Sang suddenly heard a piercing shriek in the distance.
