<h1>Chapter 1654: Firefly Dharma Chain</h1><p>“Fire Rhinoceros Seal!” Lan Kun Dao also saw the crimson immortal pendant, her breath suddenly growing heavier.</p><p>She had just heard her senior brother mention the most valuable treasures of the Fire Lineage, among which was the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.  This treasure's most astonishing function was its ability to establish a Tribulation Transcendence Formation.</p><p>After the annihilation of the Formless Immortal Sect, the Fire Rhinoceros Seal's whereabouts became unknown. It turned out to have been brought into the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction by the Fire Lineage Ancestor.</p><p>Kun Dao was eager to try, but seeing her senior brother motionless, she didn't dare to act on her own.</p><p>“Junior Sister, don't rejoice too soon.  Establishing the Tribulation Transcendence Formation requires not only the Fire Rhinoceros Seal but also a supreme treasure of the Water Lineage, whose whereabouts remain unknown.  Moreover, we don't know the formation method.  Restoring the formation is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist gently shook his head, pouring cold water on Kun Dao's excitement.</p><p>Kun Dao wasn't particularly discouraged.  She turned to look eastward.  “The Water Lineage's supreme treasure might also have been brought into the mountain by the Water Lineage Ancestor. Senior Brother, after obtaining the Fire Rhinoceros Seal, why don't we go to the Waterborne Divine Restriction?”</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restrictions were arranged around the mountain according to the Five Elements' generative cycle.</p><p>Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire.  Judging by this, the Woodborne Divine Restriction still lay between them and the Waterborne Divine Restriction.  The best path was to exit the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction first and then circle around from the outside.</p><p>Wandering around outside carried the risk of being discovered.</p><p>The biggest problem wasn't this.</p><p>They could move freely within the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction thanks to the Blazing Sun Dharma Sword, but they didn't even know what kind of Divine Restriction was used for the Waterborne direction. If its power was comparable to the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction, it would be difficult for the two of them to find the Water Lineage Ancestor's cave abode.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist knew that his junior sister must also be aware of these difficulties, but the allure of the Tribulation Transcendence Formation was too great.</p><p>“It's still too early to talk about tribulation transcendence.”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist offered a comforting remark, then shifted his tone.  “The Tribulation Transcendence Formation is only one of the Fire Rhinoceros Seal's functions.  Several great divine abilities within the sect can be cultivated much more easily with the aid of the Fire Rhinoceros Seal. Even without the Tribulation Transcendence Formation, this trip won't be in vain…”</p><p>Hearing her senior brother mention the names of those divine abilities, Kun Dao's eyes lit up.</p><p>While conversing, they didn't forget to observe the cave abode.</p><p>Seeing that the cave abode was quiet and peaceful, the old man sat withered and motionless, truly extinguished.  He likely resembled the other corpse, having long since decayed.  Protected by the fire bell, he hadn't turned to ash on the spot.</p><p>The two no longer hesitated, entering the cave abode one after the other.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist headed straight for the fire bell.  Approaching, he didn't rashly reach out. His gaze swept over the old man's lifeless face as he observed the formation beneath him.</p><p>Kun Dao followed closely, continuously surveying the cave abode.  Her gaze passed over the previous location of the corpse.  Her expression shifted slightly, as if she'd made a new discovery. Suddenly, she flashed over.</p><p>The corpse sat cross-legged at the edge of the fire bell's spiritual formation.  Beneath it was a stone platform, also enveloped by the formation's energy, but not within the fire bell itself.</p><p>Judging by his and the old man's positions, there appeared to be a hierarchy between them.</p><p>Only a pile of white ash remained of the corpse on the stone platform.</p><p>Kun Dao glanced at it twice, then unexpectedly reached out and grasped at the white ash.</p><p>Her spontaneous action startled the white-robed Daoist.  His expression changed slightly, worried that she might trigger the spiritual formation. He was about to stop her when he saw the white ash bulge.  An object flew out and landed in Kun Dao's hand.</p><p>This object was a bracelet. At first glance, it lacked dazzling spiritual light, but after brushing away the ash, one could see the exquisite craftsmanship of the dharma chain.  Any female cultivator would be captivated by its beauty.</p><p>The most eye-catching feature was the three dragon-eye-sized red crystals embedded within.</p><p>Each crystal contained a spark of firefly light, holding pure fire elemental essence.  It reflected a faint brilliance within the crystal. Though not dazzling, it was exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>“Firefly Dharma Chain!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>This was another precious treasure of the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>“Senior Brother,” Kun Dao looked up, her face filled with joy, fondly playing with the Firefly Dharma Chain.</p><p>“Keep it.  After we return, I'll teach you several符印, which, combined with the chain, will surely double your strength!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist couldn't very well snatch his junior sister’s treasure. He took it, examined it, and confirmed that it was indeed the treasure described in the ancient texts before returning it, envying her good fortune.</p><p>Then, he cautioned Kun Dao, emphasizing that she must not act impulsively again!</p><p>He had been observing the fire bell’s spiritual formation and had already discerned some clues.</p><p>The cave abode drew Heavenly Fire from the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction outside, channeling it into the formation to suppress its violent nature and manifest the fire bell.</p><p>It seemed that the Blazing Sun Divine Restriction was the source of the formation’s power, but the Fire Rhinoceros Seal also played an indispensable role, occupying a crucial position.</p><p>Rashly taking the Fire Rhinoceros Seal would, at best, cause the spiritual formation to destabilize and the fire bell to collapse, and at worst, it could cause the Heavenly Fire to erupt.  The boundless Heavenly Fire outside would instantly surge in, easily obliterating this pure land.</p><p>In that case, even the Blazing Sun Dharma Sword wouldn’t protect them.</p><p>Hearing her senior brother describe the severe consequences, Kun Dao felt a shiver of fear and repeatedly said she wouldn’t dare.  She hid behind the white-robed Daoist, avoiding his stern gaze, happily admiring her new chain.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist understood his junior sister's nature and smiled helplessly.</p><p>The Jade Platform Sect was a secluded sect. Its disciples rarely had the opportunity to train in the outside world.  His junior sister was the most pampered.  After joining the sect, she had barely descended the mountain.  Inexperienced in worldly affairs, she was as innocent as a young girl.</p><p>He collected his thoughts, carefully observing the spiritual formation, pondering how to retrieve the Fire Rhinoceros Seal and the old man’s belongings.</p><p>Kun Dao hid behind him, her eyes fixated on the dharma chain. The more she looked, the more she liked it. After playing with it for a bit, she couldn’t wait to wear it on her wrist.</p><p>The Firefly Dharma Chain complemented her fair wrist.  Even if it weren't a treasure, it would still be an exquisite ornament.</p><p>The instant she put on the chain, Kun Dao’s movements paused almost imperceptibly, then immediately returned to normal.</p><p>She herself was completely unaware.  She kept turning her wrist, admiring the chain endlessly. Her other hand unconsciously stroked the crystals. The firefly light within flickered gently, seemingly responding to her touch.</p><p>A long while passed.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist finally unravelled the complexities and identified the crucial points.</p><p>“Junior Sister, step back!”</p><p>He reminded her in a deep voice.</p><p>Kun Dao obediently retreated three steps.  She was no longer as captivated by the Firefly Dharma Chain as before, quietly watching her senior brother's movements, her fingers still silently stroking the crystals on the chain.</p><p>“Disciple offers his respects. Ancestor, forgive my transgression!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist bowed to the old man and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Then, he raised a hand and brushed it over his head. A crimson light flew out from his crown. Simultaneously, the Crimson Fire Sword vibrated and plunged into the crimson light.</p><p>In an instant, the crimson light dissipated.  Dense, intricate patterns, composed of countless runes, appeared on the Crimson Fire Sword's blade.</p><p>The patterns flickered, and a special power flowed within them, circulating through the sword.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Crimson Fire Sword paused briefly, then flew above the fire bell, its tip pointed directly at the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>At the same time, the white-robed Daoist became busy. His hands flew, fingers moving like wheels.  One after another, runes materialized out of thin air and were continuously driven into the fire bell.</p><p>The spiritual sword hummed resonantly.  Drawn by the runes, wisps of sword intent seeped into the fire bell.  In essence, he was using the runes to merge with the spiritual formation.</p><p>During this process, the Crimson Fire Sword’s physical form became increasingly ethereal, almost transforming into a beam of sword light. It descended bit by bit, finally making contact with the fire bell.</p><p>The fire bell trembled slightly, but the anticipated counterattack didn't come.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist was secretly delighted, knowing he had done it correctly. He immediately accelerated his actions.</p><p>The sword light gradually merged into the fire bell until it disappeared.  Within the fire bell, a finger-sized sword shadow appeared, slowly moving towards the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>At this moment, light converged within the sword shadow, and a rune shimmered faintly.</p><p>This rune was meant to replace the Fire Rhinoceros Seal. The Fire Rhinoceros Seal wasn't the source of the fire bell formation's power.  Replacing it with a rune would lose the True Yang Demonic Refinement effect but would allow the formation to maintain a semblance of stability for a certain period, preventing its collapse.</p><p>This way, he could easily retrieve the treasures.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The sword shadow attempted to pry loose the Fire Rhinoceros Seal, as if stirring up a hornet's nest.  The fire bell shook violently, its energy in disarray.</p><p>This was within the white-robed Daoist’s expectations.</p><p>However, what made his heart clench was that the Daoist within the fire bell was also affected by the tremors.  His body swayed, his features shifted, as if he were about to awaken.  The scene was quite eerie.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the white-robed Daoist relaxed.  Just like the previous corpse, the old man turned to dust.  Years of being tempered by the Blazing Sun Heavenly Fire meant that even a Soul Formation cultivator’s remains couldn't last.</p><p>Besides, it wasn't even certain whether the old man had been a Soul Formation cultivator in life.</p><p>The old man was dead.</p><p>As the corpse turned to dust, an object within was revealed, a corner peeking out, resembling a thumb ring.</p><p>Apart from this, there seemed to be no other belongings.</p><p>“A spatial storage treasure?”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist had this thought, his heart burning with excitement.</p><p>Both corpses in the cave abode had decayed completely, so he had even less to worry about. His gaze returned to the Fire Rhinoceros Seal, manipulating the Crimson Fire Sword to continue prying, causing the cave abode to tremble violently.</p><p>After countless attempts, the white-robed Daoist finally grasped the intricacies completely.  He no longer hesitated. His hands swiftly formed a hand seal, and he shouted in a low voice: “Fall!”</p><p>The sword shadow stopped struggling with the Fire Rhinoceros Seal and suddenly descended, intending to pierce the fire bell and retrieve the thumb ring inside first.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Crimson Fire Sword pierced into the fire bell. Sword light scattered the white ash and swept up the single thumb ring, turning upwards, about to return the way it came.  Unexpectedly, the formation suddenly shifted.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The fire bell shuddered violently, as if a bell toll resonated from within the white-robed Daoist’s heart, making his vision blur.</p><p>Flames erupted from within the bell, and several fire dragons lunged towards the Crimson Fire Sword.</p><p>“This formation allows entry but not exit?”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist's thoughts raced.  He quickly changed his hand seals. The Crimson Fire Sword flickered rapidly, evading the fire dragons’ attack, and continued to surge upwards.</p><p>In the next moment, the scene within the spiritual formation became complete chaos.  A sword shadow darted and weaved within, in extreme peril.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist’s mind was taut, focused on the Crimson Fire Sword, as if he had become one with it, searching for a way out of this predicament.  The only good news was that the fire bell formation was targeting the Crimson Fire Sword and showed no signs of attacking them for the time being.</p><p>“Junior Sister, assist me!”</p><p>As the battle reached its most intense point, the white-robed Daoist finally devised a plan, but he alone might not be able to pull it off.  He hurriedly called for Kun Dao’s assistance.</p><p>Kun Dao obediently stepped forward and, following the white-robed Daoist's instructions, summoned a phoenix hairpin.  A hairpin shadow flashed, sharp as a sword, piercing into the fire bell with perfect timing.</p><p>Internal and external forces resonated, creating an opportunity.</p><p>The Crimson Fire Sword, like a swimming fish, seized the fleeting chance and leaped through the dragon gate!</p><p>Simultaneously, the rune manifested, intending to replace the Fire Rhinoceros Seal, attempting to retrieve both treasures in one fell swoop.</p><p>A breathtaking moment in a confined space.</p><p>It could be said that the situation was settled. The white-robed Daoist was about to laugh triumphantly when a sudden premonition of danger arose in his heart. He felt a powerful gust of wind strike his side, aimed directly at his vital point. He was utterly shocked.</p><p>“Junior Sister, you…”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist turned his head in alarm, only to see his junior sister looking at him, her movements stiff, her expression dazed, her eyes vacant.</p><p>Her familiar, charming face sent a chill down his spine.</p><p>“Demonic corruption?”</p><p>These two words flashed through the white-robed Daoist’s mind, but it didn't feel right!</p><p>The sect’s ancient texts clearly stated that when a cultivator suffered demonic corruption, it wouldn’t manifest immediately.  The higher the cultivation, the stronger the resistance. Otherwise, the cultivation world would have been overturned long ago.</p><p>His junior sister was a Nascent Soul cultivator, after all. It was impossible for her to be silently controlled by demonic corruption.  Moreover, the corpses in the cave abode had already turned to ash.  What was the source of the demonic corruption?</p><p>His junior sister’s symptoms weren't right either.  Demonic corruption transformed its victims into terrifying demonic creatures, not like this.</p><p>These texts were written by an ancestor who had personally experienced the demonic tribulation. There couldn't be a mistake.</p><p>Countless questions raced through his mind in an instant, but they were destined to remain unanswered.</p><p>The sneak attack landed.  His protective spiritual energy was instantly activated, and the robe on the white-robed Daoist billowed, a green ring flying out – a rare, automatically activating protective treasure.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the green ring appeared, it was devoured by dazzling Heavenly Fire.</p><p>“Heavenly Fire…”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist almost groaned inwardly. The fire bell formation had been targeting the Crimson Fire Sword, yet at this critical juncture, it turned on him, its master.</p><p>Something wasn’t right!</p><p>As danger descended, a realization dawned on the white-robed Daoist. It wasn't that the fire bell formation couldn't target him before, but that an invisible hand was manipulating the Heavenly Fire here, misleading his judgment.</p><p>It must also be controlling his junior sister!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Heavenly Fire instantly tore through his robe’s defenses, and the ensuing searing pain brought the white-robed Daoist back to reality.</p><p>The sudden change and Kun Dao’s coordination with the Heavenly Fire were impeccably timed.  The white-robed Daoist had no time to react.  He lowered his head with difficulty and saw his junior sister’s delicate hand plunging a jade sword into his chest.  Blood gushed forth.</p><p>“I was the one who taught Junior Sister swordsmanship…”</p><p>Memories of the past flashed before his eyes.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist smiled tragically, the light in his eyes rapidly fading.</p><p>In the next moment, a brilliant light erupted from the white-robed Daoist's crown.  His Nascent Soul left his body, looking around in confusion.  His pained gaze swept over his junior sister, and he turned, intending to teleport out.</p><p>Heavenly Fire was everywhere outside.  He didn't know if he could escape, but this was his only option.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Heavenly Fire's momentum didn't stop. The flames suddenly exploded outwards, instantly sealing the entire cave abode and easily trapping the white-robed Daoist’s Nascent Soul in place.</p><p>Then, Kun Dao blinked, seeming to regain some consciousness.  She smelled the pungent scent of blood.  Opening her eyes, she saw her senior brother lying dead at her own hand, his lifeless, bloodshot eyes staring fixedly at her.</p><p>The immensely shocking scene stunned Kun Dao.</p><p>A piercing scream, filled with anguish, echoed through the cave abode.</p><p>Soon, the scream faded, replaced by a sucking sound.</p><p>Before Kun Dao could escape the cave abode, she lost herself again, pouncing on her senior brother’s corpse like a hungry tiger, greedily devouring his vital essence and blood.  This scene was truly like that of a demon.</p><p>Blood flowed down her chin and onto her body, staining her clothes crimson. Kun Dao paid no attention. After draining the vital essence and blood, she set her sights on the Nascent Soul, beckoning it into her hand and stuffing it whole into her mouth, chewing vigorously.</p><p>The sound of grinding teeth, combined with the occasional piercing scream, was bone-chilling.</p><p>Gradually, the screams became less frequent, and the cave abode returned to silence, leaving only a mangled corpse and a blood-soaked female cultivator, slumped on the ground.</p>
