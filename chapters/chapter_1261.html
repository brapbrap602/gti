<h1>Chapter 1253: The Prison</h1><p>Chapter 1253: The Prison</p><p>The large array contained more than just flesh puppets; various other transformations lurked within, each harboring deadly intent.  However, firstly, the array was ownerless, and secondly, the black tower was heavily damaged. While still powerful, it also had many weaknesses.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Having just passed through a soul-chilling gale, he was instantly attacked by a crimson beam of light.  The sky above resembled a starfield, filled with bloody stars that shot out malevolent beams of light.</p><p>Qin Sang consistently managed to avoid danger, skillfully navigating the gaps between the beams.</p><p>The black tower array was incredibly complex, vast, and unpredictable.  It was difficult to decipher the entire array's structure in a short time, so Qin Sang could only follow the guidance of the Thunder Bead.</p><p>Even now, he couldn't tell where he was.</p><p>The Thunder Bead grew increasingly brighter, to the point of being blinding.</p><p>Just then, Fatty Chicken suddenly pointed towards a distant black tower and yelled urgently, "Master, my mother might be trapped inside that black tower!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed Fatty Chicken's gaze and saw a black tower intermittently appearing and disappearing within the beams of light.</p><p>He had Fatty Chicken re-check, confirming its location before swiftly pursuing the tower.</p><p>Knowing that even powerful figures like the former Demon King had been imprisoned here, Qin Sang remained cautious.  He ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to fully activate its Sky Eye ability for careful observation.</p><p>Guided by the Thunder Bead, Qin Sang drew closer to the black tower.  Strangely, the area around the tower was no different from elsewhere; everything seemed normal.</p><p>There were no flesh puppets blocking the entrance, nor were there any powerful ancient prohibitions.</p><p>"Could the danger be inside the black tower?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He had never entered any of the black towers before and had no idea what to expect inside.</p><p>The tower before him was well-preserved, with only a few small cracks at the top.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the black tower and discovered a partially open stone door on the lowest level, revealing a wide black stone passage.</p><p>Standing before the stone door, Qin Sang felt an even more chilling aura emanating from within.</p><p>After listening intently for a while, he heard nothing.</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang ordered Fatty Chicken to follow close behind, summoned his Ebony Sword and eighteen demonic banners to protect himself, and stepped inside.</p><p>Entering the passage, Qin Sang was suddenly struck by a gust of wind. His expression changed, and he instantly swung his Ebony Sword, unleashing a dazzling sword beam.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening roar echoed repeatedly through the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely and saw a humanoid figure, clad in black armor, its face completely concealed.</p><p>The armored figure was of normal human size, wielding a black chain that clattered loudly, exuding a heavy aura of ferocity.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang distinctly felt nothing was there. The sudden appearance of the armored figure caught him off guard.  Even with the full force of his sword, he only managed to sever the chain in two and crack its faceplate.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the faceplate was empty, containing only a mass of blood energy.</p><p>The armored figure swayed, and continued its attack with the chain.</p><p>"A puppet? Or something else?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, his movements remaining swift.  He unleashed over a dozen sword strikes, but discovered the armored figure seemed to lack any discernible weaknesses, forcing him to sever its limbs and body.</p><p>With a clatter, the black armor fragments fell to the ground, then silently melted away.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, noticing rows of stone chambers along the walls.</p><p>Entering the interior revealed that the tower's damage was far more extensive than it initially appeared.  Spiderweb-like cracks covered the walls, and most of the stone doors were completely shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the stone chamber nearest the passage entrance; it was a perfectly ordinary room, nothing special.  Then he noticed another relatively intact stone chamber, which looked different.</p><p>As he was about to examine it, a rumbling sound echoed through the passage, followed by a swarm of armored figures charging out, each wielding a variety of weapons.</p><p>He quickly prepared for battle, using his Sky Eye ability to carefully observe the intact chamber. Inside the stone door, it seemed as if an endless darkness consumed his vision.</p><p>Faint crimson runes briefly appeared on the stone door, then vanished.</p><p>Clearly, there were hidden Xuanmen prohibitions and talismans. Qin Sang also noticed that within the stone door was a complex illusionary realm and numerous symbols he didn't recognize.</p><p>The ancient prohibitions and talismans on the stone door were not only outward-facing; half of them were inward-facing as well, equally powerful.</p><p>"This is a prison cell?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, recalling his experiences in the Abyssal Ruins.  He realized this was a massive prison, and the armored figures were its guards.</p><p>No wonder the black tower was laid out as an array.</p><p>Even with a powerful magical array constantly shifting and changing, and the relentless pursuit of the flesh golems outside, escape from the Black Tower would be nearly impossible, even for the most fortunate prisoner.</p><p>It seems the Abyssal Pit, Blood Lake, and the Prison of the Sinful God are all interconnected, all prisons.  Itâ€™s hard to imagine the power of the Zi Wei Palace back then to have built so many terrifying jails.</p><p>This stone door is sealed shut, the air within still and lifeless.</p><p>Could any prisoners still be alive in here?</p><p>However, the power of the barrier on this door is far weaker than the Demon-Subduing Formation jointly laid down by the three races.  The prisoners here would have been far weaker than the Demon Lord, and certainly less powerful than the mysterious individual imprisoned in the Tian Shi Sect's main hall.  The odds of anyone surviving to this day are slim.</p><p>They were probably just minor henchmen back then.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the ferocious Demon Lord imprisoned in the Seven Kills Hall. The prisoners held here are unlikely to be benevolent.</p><p>These black-armored men are likely manifestations of the Black Tower's barrier. With the tower damaged, their power is diminished, yet they remain formidable, able to withstand several sword strikes.</p><p>If it were only these black-armored men, it would be troublesome, but not insurmountable.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  Her ebony sword flashed towards the enemy, splitting into countless sword lights mid-air.</p><p>In an instant, the black-armored men were swallowed by a rain of swords.  A cacophony of clashes followed, and before they could get close, they all met the same fate as the first.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as these black-armored men died, more emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately charging forward with Fat Chicken. After a fierce battle, they reached the end of the corridor and saw the stairs leading to the second level.  Without stopping, they ascended.</p><p>The ebony sword carved a path through the crowd, slaying countless black-armored men.</p><p>The black-armored men seemed endless.  If trapped here too long, Qin Sang would be worn down.</p><p>They reached the sixth level in one breath.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>As soon as they reached this level, Fat Chicken suddenly pointed at the first stone chamber by the entrance, excitedly shouting.</p><p>This level, like the ones below, was a monotonous series of corridors and cells. Fat Chicken stared intently at this chamber, the thunder bead clearly indicating the inside of the stone room!</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and dashed over.</p><p>The chamber was no different from the others; the stone door was completely shattered, with several broken stones scattered on the floor.  Qin Sang scanned the room, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>But the thunder bead's guidance couldn't be wrong.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a sword array in front of the door to hold off the black-armored men, carefully examining the stone chamber. Finally, she noticed a subtle anomaly on the floor.</p>
