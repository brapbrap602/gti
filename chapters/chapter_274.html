<h1>Chapter 267: The Unexpected</h1><p>Chapter 267: The Unexpected</p><p>In addition, the "Celestial Symphony of all Demons" also comes with a spell that excites Qin Sang even more than the "God Seizing Curse," titled "Void Essence Seal." This seal is not for use on others, but on oneself, making it an effective life-saving technique. If someone implants a soul mark, a curse, or something like a venomous insect, one can use this seal to obscure the other's senses and suppress the outbreak of the curse or venom, thus protecting oneself to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that while he was in the Earth Abyss, the Burrowing Old Man claimed to have methods to conceal insect poison and obscure other people's senses, likely referring to the Void Essence Seal technique. He did not cultivate the Celestial Symphony of all Demons and could only use his spiritual force to simulate the demonic sound, unable to fully activate the Void Essence Seal's power, so he could not completely conceal the Soul Devouring Insect's undulations, but he could still suppress their emission.</p><p>Now, if he entered the range of the Kuiying Sect's senses, he would be detected immediately. After implanting the Void Essence Seal on the Soul Devouring Insect, it was only when encountering it face-to-face or encountering someone with extremely powerful spiritual senses that the Soul Devouring Insect's existence could be detected. The Void Essence Seal had more or less resolved this largely hidden threat of his, which naturally elated Qin Sang, so he resolved that once he escaped, he would first cultivate the Void Essence Seal. Though the Kuiying Sect had been almost exterminated, its luck had run out, the existence of the Soul Devouring Insect still hung over his heart like a heavy stone; being able to remove it would be the best outcome.</p><p>He collected everything in the Burrowing Old Man's mustard bag, finally throwing the mustard bag into the magma to burn. The Burrowing Old Man was a loose cultivator, and Qin Sang did not fear anyone avenging his death. Although this experience had been fraught with danger, his harvest could only be described as remarkable.</p><p>The family wealth of a Core Formation cultivator certainly suited Qin Sang's tastes, and besides those jade slips, the spiritual objects that the Burrowing Old Man had prepared to refine the Mixed Yuan Heart-Joining Ring greatly increased Qin Sang's wealth. Though there was no spiritual wood among them, in a moment of crisis, he could exchange these other spiritual objects for it. Obtaining the Black Flame Camphor would be enough to support his breakthrough into the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment realm, allowing for instant relief.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had not managed to obtain Immortal Profound Universe's relics, which must have contained an even greater and deeper depth than the Burrowing Old Man's.</p><p>"Though treasures are good, life is heavier, do not be overly greedy," Qin Sang silently reminded himself. When he intervened in the fight between Core Formation cultivators, framing the Burrowing Old Man, his intent had not initially been to seize any treasures but to save himself, and it was for that reason that he had succeeded. If he had been swayed by the treasures, he likely would have ended up dying for nothing.</p><p>As an aside, after Qin Sang put his own household in order, he found it was truly desolate. Most of his spirit stones had been used to buy soul-refining magic objects, and now, he had less than a thousand low-grade spirit stones left.</p><p>He had lost his best trump card in using the Profound Yin Thunder to escape.</p><p>His three evil corpses had been destroyed, and all that remained in his corpse puppet bag were a few zombies, good for nothing more than tying someone up.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede he had meticulously brought up had been taken back by the Burrowing Old Man and was likely killed along with the other strange insects in the spirit beast bag by the Sky Breaker Sword Talisman's saber energy.</p><p>The several powerful magic objects he had collected over the years had all been tossed away when he fought to defend against the Burrowing Old Man's counterattack before his death and had been completely wasted, so now all that remained in his mustard bag were a few items that had auxiliary effects.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner had also been heavily damaged from the battle's aftermath, and after going back, he would still need to nurture it for a while before it could be restored. Fortunately, it had not been utterly destroyed; otherwise, with fewer than 6, he would be unable to form a great formation.</p><p>He had lost the possessions he had accumulated for the past twenty years, returning him to the starting point. If he had not been able to make up for these losses with the Burrowing Old Man's relics, he would have no choice but to return to the old road, beginning his arduous struggle.</p><p>After clarifying his gains and losses, Qin Sang calmed his thoughts and communicated with the Flood Dragon Soul, learning that he had already come very close to the other half of the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Talisman.</p><p>Not long afterwards, his field of vision suddenly widened, and he looked ahead to see a wide lake of magma; it was the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Talisman, which had not moved for a long time. Qin Sang glanced at his surroundings and discovered a magma whirlpool in the center of the lake. Several dark streams flowed in from every direction, gathering together in the center of the lake, slamming into each other, the dark red magma mixing together to form an extremely rapidly spinning whirlpool. Upon looking closely, he saw a white light floating along with the dark streams at the whirlpool's center—it was the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Talisman, the Flood Dragon Soul struggling with might and main, looking as if it was at its wit's end. The white light was extraordinarily dim and could not shake free from the whirlpool, and in a moment, it would be swallowed up by the whirlpool. Upon seeing this, Qin Sang did not hesitate to swallow a handful of spirit pills, his figure flashing repeatedly as he jumped into the whirlpool without hesitation.</p><p>Strands of darkness twisted into a killing aura, and the suction from the whirlpool was enormous. Qin Sang could not help but follow the whirlpool's spinning, his line of sight fixed on the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Talisman in the center.</p><p>The medicinal power turned into spiritual power, and Qin Sang used it to protect his body without reservation, to resist the engulfing lava and the suction of the whirlpool, getting closer and closer to the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Token, and finally grabbing the secret token in his hand.</p><p>The Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Token trembled slightly, and the Jiaolong essence was about to struggle. After sensing the other half of the essence on Qin Sang's body, it immediately became docile.</p><p>Qin Sang's body suddenly burst out with dazzling spiritual power, and with a "boom", he broke free from the dark current and escaped from the whirlpool.</p><p>In the palm of his hand were two jade tablets, each containing a mass of Jiaolong essence, one large and one small.</p><p>Qin Sang released his spiritual power, and the two jade tablets automatically closed together, and the two essences merged into one, which was much stronger than before, but still very weak compared to when it was at its peak.</p><p>The cracks on the Nine Dragon Heaven Carriage Token were very obvious.</p><p>If it were a cultivator at the Nascent Soul Stage, he would only need to use the alchemy fire to heal it, and the cracks would be repaired soon.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have time to take a closer look. He put away the secret token and immediately urged his body technique, turning it into a遁光 and returning along the original path.</p><p>Halfway through the journey, Qin Sang suddenly stopped遁光, looked at the stone walls on both sides of the lava, and frowned slightly.</p><p>Since he jumped into the lava river, the lava had been surging and surging. Qin Sang initially thought it was because of the turbulent current, but now he found that it seemed not that simple.</p><p>The earth was also shaking!</p><p>'Crash! '</p><p>The torrent surged and the waves surged.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure moved quickly, flashing between several peaks, his brows furrowed even tighter, and a ominous premonition suddenly rose in his heart. He suddenly remembered that when he was climbing the mountain, there was a sudden earthquake on the Heavenly Peak.</p><p>Now the frequency is obviously faster, there will be an earthquake every dozen or so breaths, and the amplitude of the earthquake is also greater than that time.</p><p>Could it be that an accident happened to the ancient remains?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. There was a Golden Core Cultivator sitting in the ancient cultivator's remains, even if an accident occurred, he could save people.</p><p>And he was trapped in the lava river, and no one could save him. In case the ancient cultivator's remains collapsed, he would have nowhere to return and could only go with the flow, and eventually he would not know where he would end up.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang couldn't delay any longer. He had to at least go up and see what happened to the ancient cultivator's remains before deciding where to go.</p><p>But before long, Qin Sang came back in a panic, his face extremely ugly.</p><p>Behind him, the lava roared, the waves surged, and the waves were monstrous.</p><p>Figures in red danced gleefully in the lava.</p><p>Fire Monkey, Fire Bird, Human Phantom...</p>
