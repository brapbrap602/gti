<h1>Chapter 945: Escape from the Jaws of Death</h1><p>Chapter 945: Escape from the Jaws of Death</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of fear.</p><p>This top-tier ferocious beast was likely the leader guarding the purple crystals.</p><p>Fortunately, she had been prudent last time, taking only one crystal before leaving. Otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you’ll get your share!”</p><p>Qin Sang offered a word of comfort.</p><p>Purple crystals were difficult to obtain, but there were two toxic lands in the Seven Kills Hall, and the Flower Fairy Lake might contain herbs that attracted fat silkworms.</p><p>The fat silkworm, sensing the pressure from the top-tier ferocious beast, trembled on Qin Sang’s shoulder, no longer daring to make a sound.</p><p>…</p><p>The impact lessened.</p><p>Mou Laomo stood at the canyon entrance. The array was damaged, with some of the bone talismans shattered.  He ignored it, his gaze fixed on the depths of the ghost land.</p><p>Seeing no one emerge, Mou Laomo grew restless.  His lips moved, and a wisp of blue spiritual flame flew from his brow – the Winter Subdue Cold Flame.</p><p>The flame condensed before him, reflecting in Mou Laomo’s eyes like two icy daggers.</p><p>He glanced down at the flame and murmured, “Winter Subdue Elder was on the verge of breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage, becoming a Grand Cultivator, yet he perished in a Heavenly Tribulation. His body wasn’t discovered in the Demon Sea Island until centuries later.  It truly is a twist of fate.  Unfortunately, this secret technique is incredibly difficult to cultivate.  I’ve spent decades and only achieved a rudimentary level, failing to fully refine the Winter Subdue Cold Flame. Otherwise, my strength wouldn’t be inferior to a Grand Cultivator, and I wouldn't be threatened by the Demon Lord and that old geezer, wasting precious time! Oh well, let the Demon Fire dissipate! Even if I succeed in obtaining it, taming it would be a long shot. Refining the Winter Subdue Cold Flame would greatly increase my chances of breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage and dominating the two regions. The difficulty of reaching the Divine Transformation stage is unimaginable; it's uncertain whether one will appear in thousands of years…”</p><p>Despite his words, Mou Laomo felt a pang of regret thinking about the Demon Fire.</p><p>He dashed to the entrance of the ghost land, finding it in ruins.</p><p>Then, Mou Laomo carefully re-established the bone talisman array, even using several drops of his essence blood to enhance it. The array’s power was now as strong as ever.</p><p>He then used his divine sense to probe the area. The ghost mist did affect his senses, but as the souls were being purified and the demonic restrictions were dissolving, the mist was continuously dissipating. Now, he could see more than a dozen meters clearly.</p><p>Mou Laomo’s divine sense was far stronger than that of other cultivators at his level, making this interference negligible. He muttered an incantation, condensed the cold flame with his divine sense, and created several cold fire puppets to thoroughly search the ghost land.</p><p>The cold fire puppets quickly swept through the ghost land, leaving no corner unexplored.</p><p>The ghost land was limited in size, and the puppets easily covered the entire area, finding traces of the altars.</p><p>The altars and light pillars had shattered during the soul purification process.</p><p>Mou Laomo’s physical body appeared above the altars, his eyes flickering. It was difficult to determine their purpose, but it was clear they were not from this era, and the strange phenomenon was definitely triggered by the altars.</p><p>The altars had remained undisturbed in the ghost land for countless years. The accident only occurred after the mysterious person entered, clearly indicating that someone had deliberately triggered something.</p><p>Unfortunately, only these faint traces remained, with no sign of the person.</p><p>Besides the five altars, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>The mysterious person had vanished without a trace. Apart from the five altars, there was no sign of any ancient cultivator’s relics, and certainly no treasure.</p><p>This place was arguably the most desolate secret realm in the entire Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Mou Laomo furrowed his brow, filled with doubt.</p><p>Did the person accidentally trigger a powerful restriction and be completely destroyed without a trace?</p><p>“No! Even if the person died, there should be some remains.”</p><p>Mou Laomo realized the impact in the ghost land was less intense than what he experienced, “There must be something I missed. Could it be…?”</p><p>Before he could figure it out, a loud boom and shrill bird cry echoed from outside.</p><p>After listening for a moment, Mou Laomo’s face changed drastically, and he immediately ran out of the ghost land without looking back.</p><p>…</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang was in disarray, fleeing in desperation.</p><p>Sensing the presence of a top-tier ferocious beast in the ravine, Qin Sang didn't dare to linger. She used all her strength in her escape technique, flying straight up towards the sky.</p><p>Just as she left, the beast arrived.</p><p>The purple mist was incredibly thick. Qin Sang, using his unique vision, glimpsed shadowy figures. On one side, a single creature, dog-like but not quite; on the other, a pack of dragon-like beasts.  </p><p>An ancient feud seemed to simmer between them; they snarled and growled at each other repeatedly.</p><p>Fortunately, both groups were distracted by each other and the commotion in the Ghostlands, oblivious to Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>Then, unexpectedly, a terrifying aura descended from above.  A ferocious wind buffeted him as a colossal, monstrous bird swooped down.</p><p>Warned by his Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang reacted swiftly, flattening himself against the cliff face. He ordered his Fat Silkworm to strengthen its protective shell and activated his Crimson Silk Veil to mask his presence.</p><p>But the bird was exceptionally alert, sensing his presence.</p><p>While Qin Sang had successfully avoided detection by Old Master Mu, the Crimson Silk Veil was only part of the reason; Bai's contribution was significant.  He might have deceived an ordinary transformed demon or Yuan Ying cultivator, but these apex predators were different.  They lived in the Purple Mist Wasteland for years, their strength comparable to Yuan Ying cultivators, intimately familiar with their environment, and possessing extremely keen senses.  He was discovered.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A powerful gust of wind tore past.  The monstrous bird, propelled by a gale, let out an ear-splitting shriek and unleashed a beam of black light, a deadly arrow aimed at Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang was terrified.  He had hoped for respite after evading Old Master Mu, but the chasm held so many apex predators, one of which had been perched on the cliff all along—a surprise even Bai hadn't foreseen.  He had been lucky to avoid detection until now.</p><p>With the monstrous bird blocking his path, other beasts watching, and Old Master Mu lurking, Qin Sang's heart pounded.  His mind raced, and with a powerful thrust of his foot, he narrowly evaded the attack. The blast’s shockwave, however, struck him, slamming him hard against the cliff face, forcing a pained groan.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black light crashed into the rock, sending a shower of debris flying and creating a large crater.  The sight sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>The monstrous bird shrieked, its wings beating furiously, preparing to pursue, when a roar erupted from the bottom of the chasm—a clear warning laced with hostility, clearly aimed at the bird.</p><p>The bird paused, its fierce eyes fixed on the valley floor, responding with a retaliatory shriek.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been secretly activating his summoning lightning technique, ready to fight to the death, felt a wave of relief.  As he’d expected, the apex predators, though slightly more intelligent than other beasts due to the influence of the Seven Killing Temple, were not immune to interspecies rivalries.  Encountering a sworn enemy instantly diverted their attention.</p><p>This was his chance.</p><p>Feigning weakness, Qin Sang tumbled away, disappearing from the bird's sight and escaping in another direction.</p>
