<h1>Chapter 144: The Method</h1><p>Qin Sang and Ming Wei huddled together, tense.</p><p>Shielded by the Life Talisman, others couldn't sense their presence, but they could clearly see what was happening outside.</p><p>Venerable Ye's gaze, cold and sharp like a blade, swept over them.</p><p>Ming Wei pursed her lips tightly, cold sweat beading on her forehead, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>Qin Sang clutched the jade bottle containing the Three Lights Jade Liquid. If anything went wrong, he would have to consume the liquid and fight Venerable Ye to the death. However, Venerable Ye might not have much strength left, so Qin Sang remained relatively calm.</p><p>Seeing Venerable Ye and his group leave, Qin Sang and Ming Wei breathed a sigh of relief. The crisis had passed.</p><p>Afterward, a few more cultivators entered, following Venerable Ye and the others.</p><p>These individuals had secretly colluded, intending to seize the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>The other three bottles had been taken by a mysterious person who had disappeared.  It was unclear whether the Nascent Soul cultivator had truly lost track of the person, or if it was a deliberate ploy. They could only target the last bottle.</p><p>The group formed an alliance and pursued.</p><p>Just then, fighting suddenly erupted within the cavern.</p><p>Blood Bat and the others had been severely injured by Venerable Ye.  Their rivals, seeing an opportunity, along with allies attempting a rescue, created chaos. The ultimate fate of those involved remained unknown.</p><p>Bloodshed once again filled the cavern.</p><p>Unconcerned, Qin Sang and Ming Wei remained where they were, keeping the Life Talisman active.  They waited until all the cultivators had disappeared into the depths of the passage, ensuring no one else entered from outside, before quietly revealing themselves.</p><p>All was clear.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance and headed back, choosing a different tunnel at random and swiftly moving outward.</p><p>They navigated the complex network of caves.</p><p>As before, Qin Sang led the way and kept watch, while Ming Wei remained ready to activate the Life Talisman. The danger hadn't completely passed.  Only after leaving the Labyrinthine Caverns would they truly be safe.</p><p>Finally, they emerged from the caves into the interior of the ring-shaped mountain.</p><p>Ming Wei looked up at the sky, shrouded in dark mist, and asked nervously, "Fellow Daoist Qin, that old ghost wouldn't try to ambush everyone up there for the Soul Cleansing Liquid, would he?"</p><p>"If he were at his peak, he might actually do something like that."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the old devil Mu, who had dared to block the entrance to the Seven Kills Palace and slaughter countless Core Formation cultivators.  "His strength is diminished. Those people would be delighted if he stayed.  Being too overbearing would be suicidal.  Besides, I sense they've already gone far…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Ghost Seal Su Nu had given him, which allowed him to sense her location.</p><p>To be safe, they didn't rush to reveal themselves, remaining hidden in the shadows to observe.</p><p>After a while, a cultivator flew out from the exit of the Labyrinthine Caverns' barrier.</p><p>He sighed. This time, he had truly lost both his wife and his troops.  He hadn't managed to get any Soul Cleansing Liquid, and the treasures in the Treasure Pavilion had likely been divided up.</p><p>However, witnessing such a spectacle, and seeing one of his rivals suffer a great misfortune, made the trip worthwhile.</p><p>The corner of his mouth curled up slightly as he summoned his flying light and headed towards the stone peak, preparing to leave the Trial Grounds.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang and Ming Wei emerged from the Labyrinthine Caverns.</p><p>Their figures flashed as they disappeared into the forest.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ming Wei, this is yours."</p><p>True to his word, Qin Sang took out a bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid and handed it to Ming Wei.</p><p>Ming Wei was overjoyed, examining the Soul Cleansing Liquid repeatedly.</p><p>She knew Qin Sang had snatched three bottles but wisely didn't ask any questions.  Receiving one was enough.</p><p>Without Qin Sang, she would likely have returned empty-handed, wasting her ancestor's efforts.</p><p>Putting away the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Ming Wei hesitated slightly. "Fellow Daoist, you know how to refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid, right?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Is there a specific method for refining the Soul Cleansing Liquid?"</p><p>He had assumed it could be consumed directly.</p><p>It seemed he would have to ask Ning Wu Hui, Qin Sang thought to himself.  As expected, Ning Wu Hui hadn't participated in the fight for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  He didn't know where she had gone.  Otherwise, they would have had a better chance.</p><p>Ming Wei nodded. "The most valuable aspect of the Soul Cleansing Liquid, besides increasing the chances of Nascent Soul formation, is its ability to purify the soul and greatly enhance spiritual sense.  Direct consumption wastes some of its potency.  I have a refining method passed down from my ancestor. Fellow Daoist Qin can take it as a reference."</p><p>Ming Wei handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>A hint of curiosity flickered in the depths of her gaze as she looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>In the battle within the cavern, Qin Sang had displayed various techniques, each beyond the reach of cultivators of the same rank. It was strange that such a person was unknown in the Demon Sea.</p><p>In Ming Wei's view, none of the cultivators who had entered the Trial Grounds, including the renowned Blood Bat and Daoist Xiao Yun, could compare to Qin Sang.  He might be the one with the highest chance of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>It would be good to establish a positive connection with him.</p><p>"Purifying the soul… I wonder how that differs from the Soul Nourishing Wood's soul light…"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  He accepted the jade slip without hesitation and bowed.  "Thank you, Fellow Daoist. I won't stand on ceremony."</p><p>Ming Wei smiled. "I have finally lived up to my ancestor's expectations.  I am preparing to leave the Seven Kills Palace. What are your plans, Fellow Daoist Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Ghost Seal and shook his head. "That warning wasn't sent for nothing.  I made a promise and can't go back on my word. I still have something to do here."</p><p>Ming Wei hummed in acknowledgment.</p><p>She also understood that Qin Sang's prior knowledge of the Nascent Soul cultivator's infiltration must have had a reason.  Seeing that he didn't want to elaborate, she didn't press further.  She passed the method of using the Life Talisman to Qin Sang, saying, "The Life Talisman has one more use. I shouldn't need it.  Fellow Daoist Qin, take it. It might be helpful. I am a disciple of the Mu Family Village.  My ancestor is easygoing and a dedicated cultivator. As such, the Mu Family Village doesn't have many disciples and isn't well-known in the cultivation world. However, we can still offer protection to a few fellow Daoists.  After leaving the Seven Kills Palace, if you have the time, Fellow Daoist Qin, feel free to visit the Mu Family Village…"</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>He had offended the East Pole Alliance this time. If he couldn't return to the Small Cold Region, having a connection with a Nascent Soul ancestor would be beneficial.</p><p>Ming Wei bid farewell to Qin Sang and flew towards the stone peak.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Life Talisman, pondered for a moment, and followed the guidance of the Ghost Seal to pursue Su Nu.</p><p>His deal with Su Nu was simple.  He only needed to activate the Ghost Seal from a distance and could retreat immediately if things went south. He didn't need to rescue her from Venerable Ye, so there wasn't much danger.</p><p>"This method is feasible, but the process is slow. You have to refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid's potency bit by bit. Keep the Soul Cleansing Liquid. I won't refine it yet. So much has happened in the Trial Grounds. Who knows what we'll encounter in the inner palace.  I might still be needed."</p><p>Bai's voice transmitted to him.</p><p>Qin Sang had just given the method Ming Wei gave him to Bai.</p><p>"Alright, then I'll safeguard it for now."</p><p>With no time to refine it at the moment, Qin Sang stored the two bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid in his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>To avoid being detected by Venerable Ye, Qin Sang dared not use his escape technique, traveling alone through the forest.  Venerable Ye was scouting ahead, so there was no need to worry about being exposed by disturbing the earth spirits.</p>
