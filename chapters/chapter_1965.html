<h1>Chapter 1956: The Man on the Mountain</h1><p>Noon.</p><p>The hurried beat of hooves echoed along the main road, kicking up a cloud of dust as three swift horses galloped into view. The villagers of Qipai Village, seeking respite from the heat beneath the shade of the trees, couldn't help but recall the previous commotion upon seeing this scene.  It was said that Scholar Chen had been confronted by an enemy at his doorstep and nearly imprisoned.</p><p>The villagers immediately tensed, rising to their feet and peering across the river.  They saw the three riders rein in their horses just outside the bamboo grove, seemingly about to turn into it.</p><p>"Oh no! Something's happening again!" An elder exclaimed, slapping his thigh anxiously.</p><p>The others shared his concern.  Their respect for Chen Zhenqing was genuine, not solely due to his character. Chen Zhenqing had established a school in Qipai Village, bringing tangible benefits and a glimmer of hope to generations of farmers.</p><p>Just then, one of the riders raised a gong high and struck it with force.  The three dismounted, tethering their horses by the roadside.  Beating the gong, they walked and shouted, "We beseech Master Chen to come forth! Congratulations on your success in the examinations!"</p><p>Their cries carried across the river.</p><p>"Success? What success?"</p><p>"Oh! I remember a few days ago, Sangouzi mentioned that Scholar Chen went to take the exams again. This means he succeeded! He's going to be an official!"</p><p>"What official rank is above a scholar?"</p><p>...</p><p>The villagers chattered excitedly, the gong's clangor drawing more and more people, who hurried towards the school to join the commotion.</p><p>Outside the school:</p><p>"Auspicious news for your esteemed household! Master Chen Zhenqing has achieved the highest rank in the county examination, the Jieyuan!  He has plucked the laurel from the Gui List and topped the Golden List!"</p><p>The three messengers presented the official announcement with beaming smiles.</p><p>Chen Zhenqing accepted it, his expression as impassive as it had been after previous failures.  He merely sighed softly.</p><p>Madam Chen, who had accompanied him, understood her husband's heart.  She gently grasped his hand and softly instructed their servant, "Mingyan, bring out the celebratory coins."</p><p>"Yes!" Mingyan went off, overjoyed.</p><p>It seemed they had anticipated Chen Zhenqing's success this time, as the Chen household was already well-prepared.</p><p>The school grounds quickly filled with a jubilant crowd, jostling and clamoring for the celebratory coins.  Not only the villagers of Qipai Village but also gentry and prominent families from Qinggui Town and Jinyan County arrived to offer their congratulations. Even the magistrate himself came in person.</p><p>Even without the connection to the Grand Secretariat, Chen Zhenqing's status as Jieyuan practically guaranteed his success in the metropolitan examination.</p><p>The festivities continued late into the night.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The newly appointed Jieyuan, however, did not stay home to entertain guests. Instead, he ordered food and wine to be sent to Green Ram Temple.</p><p>In the upper floor of the temple:</p><p>The food and wine were laid out. Xiaowu and Yulang attended.</p><p>"Now we can't call you Scholar Chen anymore, but Master Chen." Qin Sang raised his cup to Chen Zhenqing with a smile.</p><p>"Daoist, please don't tease me.  I know how much water there is in this Jieyuan title." Chen Zhenqing drained his cup and sighed deeply.</p><p>"Success in the examinations is never a bad thing.  This is a stepping stone to advancement. You finally have the opportunity to realize your ambitions, why be so downcast?" Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Ambitions?"  Having drunk little, Chen Zhenqing seemed somewhat intoxicated, his eyes glazed over. "My teacher is advanced in years. Although he has returned to the court, he feels the pressure of time. Among his disciples, I am not exceptional, and having been out of office for many years, I am far inferior to others in official matters and governance. I can't assist my teacher much."</p><p>He paused, then said in a low voice, "I have decided, if I am fortunate enough to succeed in the metropolitan examination, I will request a posting to a border county.  To govern a region and benefit the people.  I only hope that after a hundred years, there will still be people who remember the name Chen Zhenqing!"</p><p>He glanced at Yulang and Xiaowu. "I will soon be taking my family to the capital for the examination. After this farewell, I fear it will be difficult to return. The only thing I'm concerned about is these students."</p><p>Yulang's eyes reddened.</p><p>Xiaowu sat quietly beside Qin Sang.  Over the years, they had spent countless days with Chen Zhenqing. This bond was not easily severed.</p><p>Qin Sang discerned Chen Zhenqing's thoughts and smiled faintly.  "Brother, if you have something to say, speak plainly."</p><p>"Could Yulang take over the school?"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing's words startled Yulang.</p><p>"Ah? Me?"  Yulang hadn't expected his teacher to entrust the school to him.  He stood up abruptly, pointing at himself.</p><p>"There are many who wish to succeed me, some truly talented. However, their intentions cannot be hidden from me.  I fear they would not be content to remain in the countryside as a teacher. Yulang's character, knowledge, and talent are evident to all. He is more than capable of being a teacher! If he weren't averse to officialdom, we, master and disciple, could have ascended the Golden List together, creating a legendary tale!"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing looked at Qin Sang expectantly.  Qin Sang was Yulang's true master.  If Qin Sang didn't agree, everything was moot.</p><p>At that moment, someone seeking medicine entered the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, supporting himself on the table. He addressed Yulang, "Your master will not interfere. Think carefully about whether you can shoulder this responsibility."</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Midsummer.</p><p>The sound of reading resonated within the school.  A cool breeze rustled through the bamboo grove, mitigating the summer heat. Yulang, now a teacher himself, completed his rounds in the beginners' class and ascended the bamboo tower.</p><p>The sounds of debate drifted down from the tower. Not quarreling, but a group of scholars discussing the classics.</p><p>Scholar Chen had left, but the number of students at the school had not diminished.  In fact, scholars from the county seat now favored this place for composing poetry and practicing calligraphy.</p><p>"Brother Yulang is here! Come and judge our debate!"</p><p>Seeing Yulang, the group surged towards him.  Yulang, though a teacher, was of similar age to most of them, so they addressed each other as brothers.</p><p>Finally extricating himself from the crowd, Yulang walked to the window.  Xiaowu sat there, chin resting on her hands, gazing outside.  She exuded a cold aura that kept others at bay.</p><p>After that incident, Yulang had noticed a distinct distance in his senior sister's interactions with outsiders. And since the Yan Kingdom forbade women from taking the imperial examinations, her old friends had gradually left the school, leaving fewer and fewer behind.</p><p>Fortunately, his senior sister had not become disheartened and withdrawn as she had before. She still remained at the school.</p><p>He hoped she could move on.</p><p>Yulang sighed inwardly and produced a letter. "Senior Sister, a letter from Teacher has arrived. He requested a posting and has gone to Danyang County, Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou."</p><p>"Danyang County, bordering the Great Liang Kingdom?" Xiaowu took the letter and read it carefully.</p><p>"Yes! After that devastating war decades ago, the Yan Kingdom and the Great Liang Kingdom nearly fell prey to the surrounding nations.  Recognizing the situation, they agreed to a truce and focused on recovery.  Now, the rulers of both nations are not warmongers. Although Danyang County is on the border, there shouldn't be any major issues.  Besides, Teacher carries the protective jade pendant we gave him.  I plan to ask the City God to contact the spirits of Zhongning Prefecture, so they can assist if necessary."</p><p>Hearing that Yulang had already considered everything thoroughly, Xiaowu said no more.</p><p>When classes ended, the two, as usual, slung their book bags over their shoulders and walked back to Green Ram Temple, bathed in the setting sun.</p><p>As they passed through Qipai Village, the villagers greeted them warmly, some asking Yulang when he planned to take the imperial examinations.</p><p>Yulang hesitated, only speaking after they had left the village.  "Senior Sister, I heard news about Meng Yusu today."</p><p>"Oh?" Xiaowu looked over, her expression unchanged.</p><p>"Meng Yusu seems to have gone mad. The Meng family moved out of Qinggui Town.  I don't know where they went. Master has cured many cases of madness, the Meng family must be too ashamed to ask Master for medicine." Yulang scoffed.</p><p>After that incident, they hadn't specifically inquired about Meng Yusu's whereabouts. Meng Yusu was said to have been taken away by the authorities and hadn't appeared at the school again.  It was unknown when he had been released, but he had likely suffered greatly.</p><p>"Oh." Xiaowu responded indifferently.</p><p>Yulang wanted to ask his senior sister what she now thought of Meng Yusu, but his lips moved without uttering the words.</p><p>Back at Green Ram Temple.</p><p>The temple was empty.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the underground chamber, sitting cross-legged on the main altar.  Lightning crackled around him, arcs of electricity snaking through the air.  Most striking was the main altar beneath him, which had become transparent, its interior a swirling vortex of lightning, flashing brilliantly.</p><p>Within this tempest of lightning, a single point of light shone most intensely. From the outside, it appeared only as a small, dragon-eye-sized dot. Yet, this dot seemed to possess infinite transformations.</p><p>This dot was the mysterious lightning rune that Qin Sang had been unable to decipher, the very heart of the main altar!</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>...</p><p>The main altar, along with the entire underground chamber, trembled.  Within the altar, in the world of lightning, bolts collided and consumed each other, a scene of unending apocalyptic chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang formed a hand seal, silently reciting an incantation. A bolt of lightning shot from his fingertip.</p><p>The lightning struck the altar beneath him, penetrating deep within.</p><p>Like pulling a single hair and affecting the whole body, with this intruding lightning bolt, the already chaotic lightning force erupted into complete pandemonium.</p><p>After being discharged, the lightning bolt did not dissipate. One end remained connected to Qin Sang's fingertip, the other churning the sea of lightning within the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang held the lightning as a musician plucks the strings of a zither.  The force in his hand changed rhythmically, causing the lightning to fluctuate.</p><p>In this manner, the trembling lightning slowly probed towards the core of the altar, gradually approaching the dot of light.</p><p>As the lightning drew closer and closer to the dot, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  Without hesitation, he dispersed the lightning at his fingertip with a sharp ‘crack’.</p><p>Simultaneously, the main altar shuddered violently. The lightning force, as if finally finding an outlet, surged out of the altar along the path of the dissipated lightning bolt!</p><p>Qin Sang bore the brunt of it, but he was prepared.  His body floated into the air, his hands transforming into lightning palms.  His palms met the onrushing lightning, the two forces converging in his hands, becoming indistinguishable.</p><p>Slowly but firmly, his palms pressed downwards, finally making contact with the main altar, suppressing the surging lightning force.</p><p>The lightning vanished abruptly, plunging the chamber into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang drifted down, gazing at the altar, lost in thought for a moment. He murmured, "Still needs more refinement."</p><p>Then, his lips moved slightly.</p><p>Above ground.</p><p>Luo Hou curled up on a large cushion.  For years, it had been mostly dormant, but today, Qin Sang had awakened it.  Tai Yi, also imitating Luo Hou, had been cultivating in seclusion in a side hall, consolidating its cultivation. It too was roused.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The two demons descended into the underground chamber and bowed in unison.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Greetings, Lord Envoy!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, appraising the two demons. Tai Yi's aura was mostly stable, no longer fluctuating wildly.</p><p>As for Luo Hou, having possessed a new body and refined it from scratch, the process would normally take a considerable amount of time. However, with the pills bestowed by Qin Sang, pills from the reserves of a Void Refinement demon, Luo Hou's progress had been remarkably swift.  It was changing daily, and it wouldn't be long before it fully recovered.</p><p>"Go down the mountain and do something for me."</p><p>Qin Sang flicked a finger, sending forth a bolt of lightning.  The lightning exploded before the two demons, revealing a diagram composed primarily of dots of light.</p><p>This was the diagram of the altar formation that Qin Sang had deduced by studying the main altar.  The most prominent dot represented this main altar, while the others indicated the locations of the branch altars.</p><p>"Split up and use this diagram to locate all the branch altars!"  Qin Sang commanded gravely.</p><p>His deductions were not entirely accurate and there might be omissions.  The two demons would need to verify each location, while he continued his deductions here.</p><p>The reason he couldn't access the 'dot of light' was the incomplete formation diagram. Once he obtained the complete diagram, Qin Sang was confident he could begin repairing the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sending several streaks of light flying towards them.  "Some of these branch altars might be located within Cloud Capital Mountain and Twilight Fall Mountain.  Luo Hou, you are not adept at traversing the earth, take the Earth Travelling Boat.  Tai Yi, your true form is a rune.  By activating a lightning rune, you should be able to control the power of all lightning runes. With these for protection, you can handle any situation unless you encounter a Void Refinement cultivator."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's seriousness, the two demons dared not show any negligence. They memorized the formation diagram and departed to carry out their orders.</p><p>Flying out of Green Ram Temple, the two demons briefly conferred, then separated, one heading east, the other west.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled out of the main hall.  Yulang was closing the temple gates and quickly greeted his master.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "These past two years, as a teacher, your character has become much more composed."</p><p>Yulang, surprised by his master's praise, was almost speechless.  He blushed slightly, his shy grin momentarily shattering his composed demeanor.</p><p>Of all his disciples, Qin Sang had invested the most in Yulang.  Since entering the Immortal Sect, Yulang had been constantly by Qin Sang's side. Qin Sang had even specially prepared medicinal baths for him.</p><p>To a certain extent, Yulang had benefited from his association with Xiaowu; otherwise, he wouldn't have fared much better than his senior brothers.</p><p>The drawback was that Yulang had mostly interacted with mortals.  He had never experienced the trials and tribulations of the cultivation world, the life-and-death struggles and the deceitful schemes among cultivators.  His experiences were the polar opposite of Qin Sang's.</p><p>Constantly sheltered under Qin Sang's wings, he retained a childlike innocence and was easily distracted.  If not for the medicinal baths, his cultivation speed would not have been so rapid.</p><p>Qin Sang had intentionally allowed him to settle down, which would be beneficial for Yulang.</p><p>"This is a Foundation Establishment Pill, enough for you to breakthrough. During this time, settle the affairs of the school and focus on establishing your foundation." Qin Sang produced a jade bottle.  "After you break through, I may be in seclusion frequently.  You and Xiaowu will manage Green Ram Temple."</p><p>Yulang was first overjoyed, then startled. He accepted the jade bottle solemnly. "This disciple will not disappoint Master's expectations."</p><p>"Go."</p><p>Watching his disciple leave, Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>After establishing his foundation, he would need to choose a cultivation method for Yulang.  He had observed Yulang's journey over the years.  He hadn't discouraged Yulang's passion for martial arts, wanting to see if he could eventually forge his own path.</p><p>Of course, not now.</p><p>Only after achieving a certain level of cultivation, if Yulang's enthusiasm remained undiminished, would there be a sliver of possibility.</p><p>However, with Yulang's obsession with martial arts, would the path of body refinement be more suitable?</p>
