<h1>Chapter 1698: Passing on the Dao</h1><p>At that moment,</p><p>The entire galaxy seemed to shimmer for them.</p><p>Those who gazed upon the night sky might have witnessed the strange phenomenon, yet unaware that someone was traversing the void, dismissing it as a mere illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the star-studded night sky, then at the empty altar.</p><p>Logically, resolving this five-hundred-year obsession should have brought immense relief. Yet, Qin Sang felt as if in a dream, silent for a long while.</p><p>That chilling sensation lingered, refusing to dissipate.</p><p>The feeling of this moment would likely never be forgotten.</p><p>Recalling Gui Mu's final message, Qin Sang murmured,</p><p>"Fireflies..."</p><p>She had truly transformed into fireflies and flown away!</p><p>And Fei Can...</p><p>Now, only the venomous pearl remained by his side, the sole connection to this five-hundred-year bond, a testament to the bygone years.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the altar step by step.</p><p>The altar itself seemed largely unchanged.  Only then did Qin Sang realize that the altar formation's power had been exhausted during the ritual dance, leaving behind only an ordinary earthen platform.</p><p>The spiritual liquid within the spring had also lost all its essence.</p><p>Gui Mu's physical body remained, frozen in her final posture.</p><p>Gui Mu hadn't given any specific instructions regarding her body.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely, noticing the rapid loss of luster in the skin.  Witch Clan divine markings appeared on the drying flesh, suggesting a process more complex than mere possession; it seemed Gui Mu had refined her body using a Witch Clan secret art.</p><p>Unable to discern anything further, Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards. The ground rumbled, and the altar, the spring, and Gui Mu's body sank into the earth, all traces erased.</p><p>After a final glance, Qin Sang flew away, returning to Deer Field. His avatar soon followed with the others.</p><p>The Nether Moon Guards, completely unaware of what had transpired, were somewhat bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang left orders for their return to the Northern Wastelands and then retreated into secluded cultivation.</p><p>This time, he didn't enter meditative trance. He intended to meticulously organize the gains from the Formless Immortal Sect. After leaving the sect, he had been preoccupied with healing and Liu Ying's ascension and hadn't had the opportunity to properly梳理 them.</p><p>First were the scriptures, techniques, and pills obtained from the Scripture Depository in Lang Huan Blessed Land. Naturally, he disdained these, but since he had conceived the idea of establishing the Green Goat Temple in the Central Continent, they would be perfectly suitable for his disciples' cultivation.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang retrieved some blank jade slips and inscribed all the other scriptures he had acquired.</p><p>Among them were the inheritances of the Water, Metal, and Wood Phases.</p><p>The Water Phase inheritance was the most complete, encompassing both the Ice Instrument Palace and the Snowy Plains tomb, with some overlap, naturally.  It also included alchemical inheritances, such as the Boiling Snow Pill formula.</p><p>Next was the Wood Phase lineage, containing several inheritances and the supreme cultivation method, the *Wood Sovereign Canon*, along with the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele* divine ability and a complete refining inheritance.</p><p>The Golden Sword contained the Metal Phase lineage sword formation.</p><p>Additionally, there were the miscellaneous cultivation methods and techniques obtained from Lang Huan Blessed Land.</p><p>Most of these cultivation methods and Daoist techniques didn't align with Qin Sang's path, serving only as references. However, they would greatly enrich the Green Goat Temple's inheritance, as they were all top-tier in the world.</p><p>Coupled with the several superior inheritances from the Northern Sea, he wondered if future disciples would be spoiled for choice.</p><p>Qin Sang belatedly realized that inheriting so much from the Formless Immortal Sect almost made the Green Goat Temple a "Little Formless Immortal Sect."</p><p>After categorizing and setting these aside, Qin Sang retrieved the treasures he had fished out from the Treasure Pool: the crude jade, the Chengying Sword, the broken drum, and the picture scroll, all related to the *Yin Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art*.</p><p>Obtaining these four treasures was purely accidental. Whether damaged or of unknown origin, Qin Sang now had the time to comprehend them thoroughly. Yet, he remained clueless and decided not to waste further energy, storing them away.</p><p>Perhaps there would be a breakthrough when his refining realm advanced significantly.</p><p>Most important, of course, were the eleventh and twelfth layers of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, corresponding to the Deity Transformation and Void Refinement realms, respectively. Qin Sang's cultivation hadn't reached that level, so he could only gain a superficial understanding.</p><p>What astonished Qin Sang the most was the transformation of the seven Killing Talismans with the improvement of his cultivation.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, a cultivator's primary task was to condense Killing Talismans and then, during late Golden Core, divide them into a total of seven sword lights, which Qin Sang called Sword Souls.</p><p>Upon entering Nascent Soul, one needed to project the Killing Talismans on their natal spirit sword onto the seven Sword Souls, then fuse these Sword Souls with their own seven Hun Po (Spiritual and Corporeal Souls).</p><p>And all of this was preparation for what came next.</p><p>With further cultivation advancement, a cultivator could gradually separate seven Sword Po, each born from sword intent, purely embodying the Sword Dao.</p><p>The seven Sword Po, coordinating with the main body wielding the natal spirit sword, formed the *Seven Po Killing Formation*, the true Sword Dao killing formation!</p><p>Of course, these were still quite far off for Qin Sang.</p><p>Filled with anticipation, Qin Sang shifted his attention to other treasures.</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc, the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, and the Icefire Token, all related to the tribulation-crossing grand formation.</p><p>With a thought, his avatar entered, taking the Ice Instrument Divine Disc, the Fire Rhinoceros Horn, and a large quantity of spiritual materials, preparing to set up the spirit array for nurturing treasures.</p><p>These two formations weren't complex, and Qin Sang had already chosen suitable locations in Deer Field.</p><p>Then there were the gains from the battle with the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>He wasn't planning to use the Heavenly Exquisite Spirit Embryo for now.</p><p>The Wooden Armor had been given to his avatar for refinement as a protective treasure.</p><p>The Gu King, pacified by Gui Mu's secret art, had fallen into slumber, requiring no constant vigilance. Qin Sang would refine the poison pill anew before having the Gu King devour it.</p><p>Lastly, there were the fragments of the Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree.</p><p>This treasure was severely damaged, unusable for cultivating the *Postnatal Wooden Figure Stele*. It would be kept for future refining.  Qin Sang couldn't abandon his external avatar and would need to find another medium to cultivate this technique.</p><p>The fewest treasures came from Fire Rhinoceros Island, yet they were the most helpful at Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The Mani Pearl was undoubtedly a supreme defensive treasure, currently holding the origin of Demonic Fire.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had been in slumber since leaving the estate. Once it devoured all the frozen fire spirits, its cultivation would surely soar.</p><p>Despite the numerous twists and turns, the gains at Emperor Bestowal Mountain were undoubtedly substantial.</p><p>The Fire Rhinoceros Horn, the Deity Transformation legacy, the Dao韵, the Five Elements Pills...</p><p>With the legacy of the Witch Clan Deity Transformation as a foundation, future cultivation of the *Panhu True Scripture* and enhancing Tianmu Die's realm would be much easier.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, the Five Elements Pills' value was second only to the subsequent cultivation method, though future transactions might still be complicated.</p><p>Su Zinan's legacy also brought Qin Sang a windfall.  Worthy of a Deity Transformation descendant, his treasures were numerous. The spirit stones alone were enough to support the development of an entire sect.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man seemed rather impoverished in comparison, but with his cultivation, he had also collected some heavenly and earthly treasures.</p><p>Valuable items were kept, while the rest were given to the avatar for future sect development.</p><p>Not everything he kept would be used. Some could be exchanged for treasures he needed to support his cultivation.  After handling these trivial matters, Qin Sang would enter secluded cultivation, focusing on breaking through to late-stage perfection.</p><p>The Wordless Jade Wall's Dao韵 and the Buddha Bone Sarira had cleared many obstacles on his path.</p><p>The Three Corpses Death God Banner, perhaps more aptly called the One Corpse Death God Banner now, with Su Zinan's demonic soul integrated within and still recovering, was being refined by Qin Sang, who planned to give it to his avatar along with the Thousand Illusions Mirror once it was repaired.</p><p>The Thousand Illusions Mirror had minor damage, easily repairable.</p><p>In the future, the avatar would possess three powerful treasures: the Wooden Armor, the Thousand Illusions Mirror, and the Demonic Banner.  Its strength would surge dramatically, likely surpassing ordinary Grand Cultivators.</p><p>And this was assuming the avatar hadn't broken through yet.</p><p>Before the battle at the Formless Immortal Sect, the avatar had already reached a bottleneck, sensing the opportunity for a breakthrough.  Advancing to late Nascent Soul was just around the corner.</p><p>The avatar's breakthrough, aiding Tianmu Die's advancement, and refining the origin of Demonic Fire for his main body.</p><p>These were Qin Sang's next goals.</p><p>Other matters, such as comprehending the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance, refining the Taiji Immortal Platform, and the Icefire Token, were also essential.</p><p>Overwhelmed by tasks, even with his avatar sharing the burden, Qin Sang felt stretched thin.</p><p>There was one more crucial matter: trading the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit with Mo Xingdao!</p><p>Su Zinan controlled some subordinates in the Northern Wastelands through the Nether Moon Guards. Qin Sang consolidated these subordinates, and during his time wandering in the Northern Wastelands, a steady stream of intelligence flowed in.</p><p>Qin Sang closely monitored the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery's movements, attempting to find clues and ascertain Mo Xingdao's whereabouts.</p><p>Yet, he didn't know what Holy Venerable Huiguang was plotting. Since Sect Master Yu entered the Ghost Rock Plateau, Holy King Qing Hu and the three major Daoist, Buddhist, and Demonic sects hadn't left.</p><p>Fan Laomo, Poison King, Yue Lingtian, and others who participated in the Demon Subduing Battle hadn't appeared outside either.</p><p>Mo Xingdao might still be in the legacy estate.</p><p>Qin Sang had dispatched a Nether Moon Guard to infiltrate their agreed-upon trading location, awaiting Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Everything was organized.</p><p>The avatar put away the treasures and turned to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body paused for a moment before also exiting the cave.</p><p>His cave was situated deep within the bamboo forest, in the place where Su Zinan used to refine the Three Corpses Death God Banner.  Now cleansed of its sinister atmosphere, it was wreathed in immortal mist, possessing the aura of a true immortal's abode.</p><p>After a few steps, Qin Sang heard a hissing sound.</p><p>The snake den remained in its original location. Some of the Earthbound Dragons raised by Su Zinan possessed decent strength. Qin Sang didn't intend to extract their tendons and refine treasures. They would make good guardian spirit beasts, but their ferocious nature needed to be addressed first.</p><p>Emerging from the bamboo forest,</p><p>The sea of flowers outside remained, but after Shen Chen's meticulous modifications, it had lost its artificiality and gained a natural harmony, much to Qin Sang's liking.</p><p>Did this opportunistic disciple also know how to anticipate his master's wishes?</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and flew towards the other side of the flower sea.  Soon, he saw several newly built thatched cottages at the foot of the mountain, from which Shen Chen's voice, expounding on the Dao, emanated.</p><p>Inside a bamboo pavilion, Shen Chen sat cross-legged at the head, lecturing on extremely elementary content, the kind beginners would listen to.</p><p>Xie Yi and Zhou Li were listening attentively.</p><p>Behind them sat several beautiful women, all appearing equally earnest.</p><p>Qin Sang landed beside the bamboo pavilion, unnoticed by those within.</p><p>At this moment, a woman carrying a bamboo tray with a pot of spiritual tea and jade cups hurried along the path.  Seeing Qin Sang, she was startled, letting out a cry.  Her arm trembled, and the items on the tray nearly tumbled off.</p><p>"This servant greets Master!"</p><p>The woman knelt, her voice trembling.</p><p>The lecture within the pavilion abruptly ceased. Shen Chen rushed out and, seeing Qin Sang, hastily knelt to pay his respects.  Xie Yi, Zhou Li, and the women also poured out, kneeling en masse. Some addressed him as Grandmaster, others as Master, a chaotic scene.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang glance at the women, Shen Chen appeared somewhat embarrassed and quickly explained, "Reporting to Master, not all of Su Zinan's concubines were willing. After careful discernment by this disciple, most have had their memories erased and been sent home safely. The remaining few are homeless, confirmed to have been forcibly abducted by him. They pleaded with this disciple, wishing to remain in Deer Field for the rest of their lives.  Remembering Master's instructions, this disciple didn't dare abandon them, fearing it might invite calamity. However, I also didn't dare presume to keep them without your permission, intending to await your emergence from secluded cultivation before deciding."</p><p>"You are rather chivalrous."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone betrayed neither pleasure nor anger.</p><p>Shen Chen felt uneasy.</p><p>"Deer Field can afford to support a few more people. It's fine to keep them.  The mundane affairs of the Dao field also require people to manage.  As for these..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the women who had been listening to the lecture.</p><p>The concubines chosen by Su Zinan had a remarkably high proportion of spiritual roots. These were newly brought in, their cultivation time short, their realms low.</p><p>The women were filled with fear and anxiety.</p><p>If they harbored ulterior motives, they couldn't escape Qin Sang's discerning eyes.</p><p>"If there are any with excellent character and talent, they can be selected as registered disciples as appropriate."</p><p>Dismissing the women,</p><p>Qin Sang took Shen Chen and his two grand-disciples towards the mountaintop, where a Daoist temple had already been built according to his instructions.</p><p>The temple's furnishings were simple, and the altar held no spirit tablets. Shen Chen and his disciples watched curiously as Qin Sang walked to the altar and reverently placed three spirit tablets: Yun Youzi, Daoist Jixin, and Mingyue.</p><p>Quick-witted, Shen Chen immediately led his disciples in paying their respects.</p><p>"The Green Goat Temple was founded by Senior Yun Youzi. This master was once indebted to Daoist Jixin and Mingyue.  Later, following Senior Yun Youzi's last wishes, I inherited the Green Goat Temple's Dao lineage, vowing to carry it forward..."</p><p>Hearing these words, Shen Chen was somewhat surprised. He searched his knowledge of the Central Continent, but the name Green Goat Temple seemed unfamiliar. Then he heard Qin Sang continue, "The Green Goat Temple is located in the Northern Sea.  This master, in search of the Dao, came from a foreign land, traversing the Storm Belt for decades before finally reaching the Central Continent..."</p><p>Shen Chen's jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p>They hadn't personally experienced the Storm Belt, but they had heard countless terrifying tales.  Their master actually came from a foreign land, no wonder he was previously unknown.</p><p>Once he emerged, he made a name for himself in the Central Continent!</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't fathom what it meant to traverse the Storm Belt for decades.  His respect and awe for his master deepened.</p><p>"This master now re-establishes the Green Goat Temple in the Central Continent. Though separated by two realms, the Dao lineage remains unbroken.  In the future, if fate allows, and you encounter fellow disciples from the Northern Sea, you must not fight amongst yourselves..."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was stern as he laid out the sect rules one by one.</p><p>Shen Chen, Xie Yi, and Zhou Li bowed their heads, engraving his words in their hearts.</p><p>"Shen Chen, you are this master's direct disciple, thus the second-generation disciple of the Green Goat Temple.  Above you are Li Yufu, Mei Gu, Shangguan Lifeng, Zhao Ying, Tan Yien..."</p><p>Speaking these names, Qin Sang's voice lowered, uncertain how many still lived.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the chances of the two Green Goat Temple branches meeting were slim.</p><p>But the necessary procedures had to be meticulously completed.  Moreover, if a Grand Cultivator emerged from either branch and ventured out, an encounter was still possible.</p><p>While the main body instructed his disciples,</p><p>The avatar had already arrived behind the bamboo forest, entering a deliberately excavated cave. He laid out spiritual materials like flowing water, setting up a spirit array, then placed the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Horn within for nurturing.</p><p>Next, the avatar didn't leave, entering secluded cultivation beside the Ice Instrument Divine Disc.</p><p>...</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>With the new Green Goat Temple established, Qin Sang became a hands-off leader, letting the Nether Moon Guards assist Shen Chen in management, gradually bringing it onto the right track.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was immersed in diligent cultivation,</p><p>News finally arrived from the Northern Wastelands: Mo Xingdao had appeared at the agreed-upon location!</p>
