<h1>Chapter 1174: A Marriage Alliance</h1><p>The Serpent King flashed into the battlefield, stopping the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King. Seeing this, Qin Sang temporarily halted his attack and turned his gaze toward the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Thousand Mechanisms?"</p><p>The Thousand Mechanisms Demon King was seething with anger, clearly unwilling to admit defeat, believing he still had the strength to fight and was not so easily subdued.</p><p>The Serpent King extended his hand, and the bone blade that had been flung away earlier circled in the air before landing in his palm. "Even my Netherbone Blade couldn't do anything against Fellow Daoist Mingyue. Your strength doesn't seem like that of someone who has just advanced to the Transformation Stage! You've been so composed, countering every move, and have been suppressing Thousand Mechanisms the entire time. You must still be hiding some great divine ability, haven't you? It seems Fellow Daoist Zhu is not only powerful in cultivation but also exceptional in teaching disciples. Admirable! Admirable!"</p><p>The Serpent King was straightforward, openly admitting in front of Qin Sang that the Netherbone Blade was something he had lent to the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised. He would have done the same in their position.</p><p>From their brief exchange, Qin Sang could tell that the Netherbone Blade was indeed an extraordinary ancient treasure. If the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King's final serpent shadow hadn't been destroyed by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and had instead merged with the Netherbone Blade, it would have been a formidable challenge.</p><p>However, they had underestimated his strength.</p><p>Even if the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King had gone all out, Qin Sang would have had no fear as long as he summoned the Twelve Demon Banners.</p><p>The Serpent King's demeanor was impressive.</p><p>Despite the conflict, it was hard to feel any animosity toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang modestly declined the praise, then stepped out of the black mist, storing away his demon banners and other treasures. He glanced into the distance, sensing a subtle gaze retreating. A glint of light flashed in his eyes, but he calmly averted his gaze.</p><p>His duel with the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King, though confined to the space between the two mountains, had been no less spectacular in its display of divine abilities and treasures.</p><p>If any demon kings had passed nearby, they would have easily noticed the battle.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, the fire banner formation you used seems somewhat familiar. I believe I've seen it somewhere before. I recall that among the humans, there was once a formidable demonic cultivator known as the Nether Yin Daoist, who wielded the Ten Directions Yama Banners with great renown."</p><p>The Serpent King, with his long lifespan, had actually seen the Ten Directions Yama Banners and recognized the origin of Qin Sang's demon banners.</p><p>Since the banner pole was in the hands of Senior Sister Qingjun, Qin Sang saw no need to hide the fact that he possessed the demon banners. "My master accidentally obtained the treasure-refining secret method of the old demon Nether Yin. This treasure was crafted by me, modeled after the Ten Directions Yama Banners, with some modifications to better suit me."</p><p>"The power of the demonic flames is no less than the original. It seems Fellow Daoist is also a master of artifact refinement..."</p><p>The Serpent King nodded, not pressing further.</p><p>The Thousand Mechanisms Demon King stood to the side, his face dark, remaining silent throughout.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him.</p><p>The Thousand Mechanisms Demon King snorted, absorbing the black mist, and muttered, "A bet is a bet. I concede."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Resolving things this way was for the best.</p><p>Just as he was about to bid them farewell, he noticed a group of lesser demons flying in from the distance.</p><p>The demons had witnessed the entire battle. Though the black mist had obscured their view, the sheer intensity of the clash between the two great kings had left them in awe, deepening their reverence.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways.</p><p>Beside the White Crane and Fat Chicken was a petite, elegant spirit bird at the Core Formation stage, leaning close to the White Crane, speaking softly with a shy expression in her eyes.</p><p>Seeing the two leaders shake hands and make peace, the spirit bird became even more affectionate with the White Crane, their intimacy on full display.</p><p>Here I am, fighting for my life, and this guy is busy courting!</p><p>This fellow is becoming more and more audacious, not even considering the other party's background. To be brought to the Ten Thousand Demons City by the Serpent King, her status must be extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang shot the White Crane a glare.</p><p>The White Crane slightly restrained himself, shaking his white feathers, unable to hide the pride in his eyes.</p><p>The Serpent King, however, was not angered by this. Instead, he smiled at the sight.</p><p>The spirit bird fluttered over to the Serpent King's side, her expression shy as she whispered something to him.</p><p>After listening, the Serpent King burst into laughter. "I never thought today would bring about such a delightful turn of events. Fellow Daoist Mingyue, is this young White Crane already betrothed?"</p><p>At these words, the White Crane froze, his entire body stiffening.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. Was the Serpent King actually considering pairing the two of them?</p><p>He glanced at the White Crane and shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Just now, the young White Crane confessed his love at first sight for Yue'er. Yue'er has always been very selective and has yet to find a suitable partner, but she has also developed genuine feelings for the young White Crane. Yue'er is the daughter of my wife's younger sister, and I treat her as my own. She should be a worthy match for the young White Crane. I cannot bear to separate these two lovebirds. What does Fellow Daoist Mingyue think?"</p><p>The Serpent King was genuinely considering having them become cultivation partners and was seeking Qin Sang's opinion.</p><p>"Master, please, no!"</p><p>The White Crane looked as if he had just lost his parents, panicking and pleading, "Brother, save me!"</p><p>He was a notorious flirt, always chasing after married women, never wanting to commit. The idea of being tied down to one partner had never crossed his mind.</p><p>With Yue'er backed by the Serpent King, becoming her cultivation partner would mean being under constant supervision. How could he ever go out and enjoy himself freely again?</p><p>To his dismay, his so-called brother didn't hesitate to sell him out.</p><p>"Master, marriage alliances have always been an excellent method for resolving conflicts and strengthening ties between two major forces, even among demons."</p><p>Fat Chicken didn't even glance at the White Crane, instead sending a voice transmission to Qin Sang, quietly urging, "Brother Crane's heart is still unsettled, which might hinder his future cultivation. Having a cultivation partner to keep him in line would be good for him."</p><p>The White Crane had often flaunted his romantic conquests in front of Fat Chicken, who had long grown tired of it.</p><p>Even your own brother can't stand you.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment before saying, "How does Fellow Daoist plan to arrange this? Our Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea is not as vast as your territories, and we have only a handful of Core Formation juniors..."</p><p>"That's no problem at all!"</p><p>The Serpent King waved his hand magnanimously. "From now on, we'll be family. Let Yue'er go to the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. I can see she's quite willing. It would be her fortune to receive guidance from Fellow Daoist Zhu and Fellow Daoist Mingyue. With the current turmoil in the cultivation world, it's not the time for grand ceremonies. Fortunately, we demons are not bound by such trivial formalities. I've already prepared Yue'er's dowry. We'll choose an auspicious day and send it to the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea..."</p><p>Yue'er was overjoyed.</p><p>The White Crane, on the other hand, looked utterly lifeless, as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang was left speechless.</p><p>The Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea would gain a Core Formation expert for free, and this alliance with the Serpent King would also bring a powerful ally. There was no reason to refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang had long wanted to teach the White Crane a lesson and make him behave. Now that the White Crane had brought this upon himself, it was his own fault.</p><p>On the way back, the atmosphere was noticeably different due to this new relationship. Even the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King was less hostile toward Qin Sang.</p><p>In the cheerful atmosphere, both sides quickly finalized the arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Serpent King were both needed at the frontlines, so the wedding preparations were left to the Willow Demon and the Serpent King's trusted aides, with the Thousand Mechanisms Demon King and the Bamboo Demon serving as witnesses.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hold back, providing a generous betrothal gift on behalf of the White Crane.</p><p>Yue'er clung tightly to the White Crane, her eyes overflowing with sweetness.</p><p>Everyone was in high spirits, except for the White Crane, whose heart was filled with despair, especially after Qin Sang's warning.</p><p>"If you dare mistreat Yue'er and anger the Serpent King, I'll break your legs!"</p><p>******</p>
