<h1>Chapter 605: The Path of Evil Ghosts</h1><p>Wavy blue light flickered and swayed within the tunnel.</p><p>Looking up, they saw a dark blue lake above their heads, like a curtain of water, seemingly within reach. They realized they were now beneath the small lake, the tunnel hidden at the bottom.</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Once inside the tunnel, Elder Dongyang no longer held back.  Taking Qinsang and the others, he used his movement technique and swept towards the front of the tunnel.</p><p>The tunnel was very long and winding, yet unobstructed. There were no barriers. Elder Dongyang flew with them for a full fifteen minutes and still hadn't reached the end.</p><p>Qinsang silently calculated their direction.  Based on the location of the small lake outside, they should have been deep within the mountain. However, the tunnel walls shimmered with a strange glow, clearly indicating the presence of restrictions.  It likely wasn't aligned with the outside world.</p><p>Otherwise, at Elder Dongyang's speed, fifteen minutes would be enough to circle Tianshan Mountain countless times.</p><p>After almost another fifteen minutes, the tunnel suddenly opened up.</p><p>Standing at the tunnel exit, Qinsang and the others were dumbfounded, staring at what lay ahead in shock.</p><p>Chenyan also seemed somewhat lost in thought.</p><p>Before them was an exceptionally wide passage, several dozen feet high, leading to darkness.  The walls, floor, and ceiling of the passage seemed to have a glaze, incredibly smooth.</p><p>What shocked everyone was that on this glaze, countless ferocious evil ghosts were painted!</p><p>Vengeful spirits, skeletons, pale eyeballs, scarlet tongues,森森 white bones, scattered flesh and blood…</p><p>Countless grotesque evil ghosts covered the entire passage. Any imaginable image of an evil ghost could be found here, vivid and lifelike, as if they truly existed.</p><p>They were sealed beneath the glaze, seemingly ready to break free at any moment, devouring souls and blood!</p><p>This was clearly a path of evil ghosts!</p><p>If it weren't for the absence of the legendary Yellow Springs Road, they would have thought they had descended into hell.</p><p>A chill ran down Qinsang’s spine. The moment he stood here, he felt as if countless ferocious gazes were fixed upon him, coveting his life force and flesh.</p><p>This feeling originated from the nearby evil ghosts. Though sealed beneath the glaze and motionless, their eyes seemed to truly be watching him.</p><p>In fact, not only Qinsang, but also Qiumubai and the others felt similarly.</p><p>Locked onto by thousands of ghosts, their bodies stiffened, their souls and blood seemingly congealing. They dared not move.</p><p>Elder Dongyang pointed to the Path of Evil Ghosts ahead and addressed Chenyan.</p><p>“The reason for going through so much trouble to bring these five in, instead of having Golden Core disciples control the Five Elements Beast Seal, is because of this Path of Evil Ghosts.</p><p>“I don't know if it's the unique restrictions of this place, or if evil ghosts were truly sealed here.</p><p>“Stepping onto the Path of Evil Ghosts will immediately alarm them.</p><p>“Once the evil ghosts awaken, we will be surrounded by thousands of them, making it difficult to move. We will have to fight our way out. Although their individual strength isn't exceptionally high, their numbers are vast. Even Nascent Soul cultivators can only protect themselves and would struggle to protect others.</p><p>“However, this Path of Evil Ghosts has a peculiar characteristic. It only reacts to those with a sufficiently strong life force, and there's no way to block this sensitivity.</p><p>“These five are only at the Foundation Establishment stage and haven't undergone the spiritual power infusion of Golden Core formation.  They can actually deceive these evil ghosts and walk through unharmed. Che Yutao and the others couldn't.</p><p>“Let them go through first, and then the two of us will break through.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qinsang and the others were amazed. Such a strange place existed in the world.</p><p>Not having to experience the slaughter of evil ghosts, their worried hearts finally eased. However, the thought of walking through this path alone still filled them with apprehension and worry, fearing some unforeseen event might occur, leading them to be devoured by the myriad ghosts.</p><p>“Ancestor, are these evil ghosts alive?  Could they be ancient cultivators who hunted ghosts and sealed them here?”  Qiumubai, emboldened by Elder Dongyang’s favor, dared to ask.</p><p>Elder Dongyang shook his head. “They are not living beings. What emerges are merely ghostly shadows. Whether they are formed by restrictions or are remnants of true evil ghosts annihilated here is hard to say. Alright, you all go ahead. Walk forward boldly, don't be afraid. They wouldn't even consider your flesh and blood worthy.”</p><p>To be scorned by evil ghosts.</p><p>Qinsang and the others felt a mix of emotions, yet dared not disobey Elder Dongyang’s command.</p><p>The five exchanged glances, gathering around Qiumubai. Ji Qing led the way, tentatively stepping onto the passage, one foot landing squarely on a ghost's face.</p><p>Ji Qing felt a chill run up from the sole of his foot. He took two more steps and, seeing no change in the passage, continued walking forward boldly.</p><p>They strode forward, entering the depths of the Path of Evil Ghosts, into the heart of hell.</p><p>By now, they could no longer see Elder Dongyang and Chenyan behind them. If anything unexpected happened, no one could save them. Their hearts pounded, and they broke into a run.</p><p>‘Thump, thump, thump…’</p><p>Their footsteps echoed in the passage as they ran across the glazed floor, like a death knell chasing them.</p><p>Time had never felt so slow. The passage seemed endless, and the darkness stretched on before them.</p><p>“Finally out!”</p><p>Qiumubai exclaimed softly as they finally reached the end.</p><p>This Path of Evil Ghosts was terrifying. Even someone as composed as him was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Qinsang let out a long breath. In reality, he was the most worried about something happening.</p><p>Although he hadn't undergone the spiritual power infusion, he had a Flying Night Demon within his Corpse Puppet Sack, currently undergoing transformation, and it was more powerful than a true Golden Core expert.</p><p>Qinsang feared the Flying Night Demon's aura might provoke the evil ghosts, but fortunately, nothing happened.  It was likely due to the Flying Night Demon being a dead creature with weak life force.</p><p>Ahead of the Path of Evil Ghosts were two giant stone doors.</p><p>Qiumubai stepped forward and pushed the doors open. They filed in and found themselves in a large hall with a path leading further ahead. They dared not wander around in such a place, so they obediently hid behind the stone doors, waiting for Elder Dongyang and Chenyan.</p><p>At first, there was no movement.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground shook violently, and even the thick stone doors couldn't block the terrifying ghostly wails.</p><p>On the other side of the stone door, thousands of ghosts manifested!</p><p>Countless ghostly cries, weeping, and laughter, all strange and eerie, filled their ears, affecting their minds even through the stone door.</p><p>Qiumubai and the other three paled slightly, their thoughts wavering, disturbed by the ghostly cries, struggling to maintain composure. They quickly entered meditation to stabilize their minds.</p><p>Qinsang, naturally unafraid of these, pretended to be affected and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>This chaos continued, and they couldn't hear any sound from Elder Dongyang and Chenyan.</p><p>Not long after, the stone door creaked open, pushed by Elder Dongyang. At the same time, the ghostly wails abruptly stopped, and all the evil ghosts vanished instantly.</p><p>Elder Dongyang and Chenyan entered, one after the other. The auras of both were unstable, indicating that traversing the Path of Evil Ghosts was indeed not easy.</p><p>However, they were uninjured. After consuming a spirit pill and briefly adjusting their breath, they recovered.</p>
