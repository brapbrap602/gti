<h1>Chapter 1368: The Outsider</h1><p>Chapter 1368: The Outsider</p><p>“Ghost Mother…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Tan Hao claimed to be under the Ghost Mother.</p><p>The Ghost Mother must be the mysterious person Tan Hao rescued from the water dungeon.</p><p>The Ghost Mother, trapped in the water dungeon, had her own bones extracted to create a bone formation, allowing her to survive until the present day.</p><p>Even if the Ghost Mother possessed power comparable to the Jade Bone Demon, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised. He overestimated the mysterious person as much as possible, hence his caution.</p><p>Among the Yuan Ying cultivators he knew in Bei Chen, there was no such person.</p><p>Over the past century, several major events had transpired in Bei Chen: the inter-region wars, the ascension of Zi Wei Palace, and the establishment of the Bei Chen Alliance. Almost no one in the cultivation world could have been unaware of them.</p><p>Behind these events, Qin Sang hadn't detected any sign of a mysterious force.</p><p>“A rather strange title. Since she allowed Tan Hao to save someone, she shouldn't be an utterly vicious person…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>But this single incident was too one-sided to draw a conclusion.</p><p>Tan Hao had been missing for too long, with no news, and his situation was uncertain.</p><p>The good news was that Tan Hao was still alive.</p><p>Mei Gu and Li Yu Fu stood silently to the side, not daring to disturb Qin Sang.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, activating his spiritual sense to cover the entire village, carefully searching but finding no trace left by cultivators.</p><p>The demonic disturbance occurred over a hundred years ago. The eyewitnesses were ordinary people who had long since passed away, leaving only orally transmitted legends.</p><p>Qin Sang questioned several people using Mei Gu's method, and the stories were similar.</p><p>The legends were undoubtedly exaggerated, describing collapsing mountains, darkened skies, and so on.</p><p>It was impossible to determine Tan Hao's strength at the time.</p><p>Qin Sang searched the island again thoroughly, confirming that no cultivator would choose to cultivate here.</p><p>“It seems that Tan Hao must have been in the right place at the right time, witnessing injustice and intervening. I wonder if they were cultivating nearby or merely passing through. If it was the latter, where were they headed?”</p><p>Qin Sang flew into the air.</p><p>The sea was vast and unobstructed.</p><p>He first glanced north, then turned his gaze towards the storm belt.</p><p>“Could it be that they have already left Bei Chen? That would explain why the Ghost Mother didn't appear at Zi Wei Palace. Otherwise, with the appearance of the Ascension Platform, the Ghost Mother would certainly have been eager to escape this prison, just like Bai and the Jade Bone Demon.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu and Mei Gu flew up.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Mei Gu, “Where is the senior’s cave?”</p><p>After discovering Tan Hao's statue, Mei Gu had been guarding it, neglecting her own affairs.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was startled, smiling and bowing, “Congratulations, junior sister!”</p><p>Mei Gu also showed a delighted expression; with the master taking action personally, everything would surely go smoothly.</p><p>The next day, the three arrived at a deserted area of the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang held a Xuan Huang jade.</p><p>The jade glowed faintly, clearly visible in the night, the Xuan Huang light being drawn to something beneath the sea.</p><p>It took Qin Sang a full day to pinpoint the location of the senior's cave; it would likely have taken Mei Gu several months.</p><p>They dived into the sea and descended rapidly.</p><p>Soon, they saw a mountain peak protruding from the water.</p><p>The mountain was covered with seaweed, desolate, but the Xuan Huang jade pointed to this mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Sky Eye Butterfly, and soon located a section of mountain wall covered with algae.</p><p>Landing in front of the wall, Qin Sang examined it for a while, then flicked out a beam of lightning.</p><p>The lightning struck the wall, causing a section of stones to fall, seemingly nothing unusual, but after a while, the damaged area suddenly showed a subtle ripple and returned to its original state!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then suddenly summoned the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>In an instant, the sword light was dazzling, and the seawater boiled.</p><p>Mei Gu and Li Yu Fu simultaneously narrowed their eyes, sensing the power of this sword, their eyes filled with admiration and envy, but then they noticed something was wrong.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, their expressions showing surprise and astonishment.</p><p>“Congratulations, senior uncle…”</p><p>“Congratulations, master…”</p><p>Amidst their congratulations, the Jin Chen Sword struck the wall hard.</p><p>The expected collapse of the wall did not occur; after a ripple, a black barrier appeared. The Jin Chen Sword directly pierced the wall, leaving a crack.</p><p>Black light surged from the crack, seemingly a vortex.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>Qin Sang said softly, flashing inside. Li Yu Fu and Mei Gu suppressed their excitement and quickly followed.</p><p>The Xuan Huang jade was not a token; they could only forcibly break through the protective formation of the cave.</p><p>‘Rumble… Boom…’</p><p>Heavenly thunder and earth fire, stone knives and ice arrows.</p><p>Overwhelming.</p><p>The power of the Spirit Array was formidable. Mei Gu and Li Yu Fu were secretly shocked; if they had entered alone, they could have lasted only a few breaths at most, with no chance of breaking through.</p><p>However, the array's attacks didn't harm them in the slightest.</p><p>The Jin Chen sword hung above their heads.</p><p>Qin Sang walked with his hands behind his back, his expression calm.</p><p>Sword energy formed a barrier around the three, protecting them firmly.  No matter how the array changed, Qin Sang’s path remained unimpeded as he altered his direction.</p><p>Soon, all attacks ceased, and the surroundings fell silent.</p><p>The area was filled with abundant spiritual energy, a hidden paradise.</p><p>They stood in a courtyard, clearly long abandoned, though the entire cave dwelling was intact, its doors closed.</p><p>Qin Sang dispelled the restrictions, searched, and found several magical artifacts and jade slips, as well as a medicinal herb garden, though it lacked precious herbs.</p><p>“The Tidal Induction Scripture…take it back to the inner sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang examined a jade slip, recognizing a promising cultivation technique, and gave it to Li Yu Fu.</p><p>The artifacts were unworthy of Qin Sang's attention, so he bestowed them upon his two disciples.</p><p>“Thank you, Master!”</p><p>Mei Gu, delighted, received a pair of fire charms and a set of needle-like artifacts, bowing respectfully.  Li Yu Fu also received a golden sword of considerable power.</p><p>After dismissing his disciples, Qin Sang cleaned the cave dwelling, making it a temporary residence.</p><p>Over the next few months, Qin Sang investigated secretly, concealing his identity. He explored the waters around the island countless times, later expanding his search to the various markets in the desert, but found nothing.  Tan Hao and the Ghost Mother had vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Tian Xing Plateau.</p><p>It was the day of the Beichen Alliance meeting, held in rotation among various regions.  This time, it was on the Tian Xing Plateau.</p><p>Within the Ice Crystal Palace,</p><p>Brothers Yue Kui and Yue Wu presided over the meeting.  Yuan Ying cultivators from other regions were present, including the Snake King and Jing Yu from the Yao race, but only Qiu Zhi Xianzi, a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, represented humanity.</p><p>Discussions revolved around the same old topics: the Ascension Platform, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and the Abyssal Ruins, along with a small trade fair for mutual exchange.</p><p>Representatives from various prominent sects were also present, representing their elders.</p><p>Laughter echoed through the Ice Crystal Palace as they conversed amicably.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light, unrestrained, arrived instantly, landing before the Ice Crystal Palace.</p><p>Everyone sensed it, their gazes drawn to the arrival.  Seeing Qin Sang, they were greatly surprised.</p><p>“Master Qin!  Welcome, honored guest…”</p><p>Yue Wu greeted him with a smile, then froze, his expression unfathomable.</p>
