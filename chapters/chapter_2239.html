<h1>Chapter 2229: A Desperate Struggle</h1><p>“No good! Run!”</p><p>Qing Hong and Miss Shuang were still reeling from the shock, unable to fully process what they had just witnessed.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, noticed the change in the celestial fire. As the others retreated, the fire began to subside, only to abruptly stop. His keen eyes caught the subtle signs, and an immediate warning filled his heart. He urged them to flee.</p><p>Though the two women didn't understand the reason, Qin Sang's urgency left no room for hesitation. They immediately carried him out of the valley.</p><p>The three golden eagles, having been thoroughly frightened, had fled in panic. Seeing the powerful figures depart, they dared to return, circling high above.</p><p>To avoid detection by the eagles, Qing Hong could only move on the ground.  Firstly, the jade pendant given to her by the Divine Master Tong needed constant spiritual energy to activate. Secondly, golden eagles possess exceptional eyesight, and eagle cultivators often cultivate abilities related to their vision. Any trace of their presence might be detected.</p><p>Unfortunately, they ran out of time.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The celestial fire ceased its contraction and exploded.</p><p>The horizon was like a giant firework, with streams of fire erupting in every direction.</p><p>The mountain range directly beneath the fire was the first to be hit, instantly leveled by the devastating force.  Then, countless flames descended, transforming the land into a fiery inferno.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>Each torrent of fire created a terrifying spectacle, shaking the earth relentlessly.</p><p>Countless streams of fire rained down, spreading in all directions.</p><p>Qing Hong, Miss Shuang, and the three golden eagles were all struck by terror at the horrifying sight.</p><p>They had assumed they were far from the battlefield, but after the celestial fire erupted, the fire rained down upon them, a deluge of unimaginable power, easily capable of annihilating them.</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>One of the golden eagles shrieked.</p><p>The three eagles frantically turned, their wings beating furiously, wishing they had been born with an extra pair.</p><p>Qing Hong and Miss Shuang, experiencing such a thing for the first time, were panicked.  They ignored the risk of exposure and desperately fled with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, despite his lower cultivation, was the calmest. Judging by the scale of the explosion, he figured that not many fire streams would reach their location. With caution, they could evade them.  But this didn't mean they were safe. The real danger was the impact of the fire streams—the aftershocks of the battle between those at the Void Refinement stage, an energy they couldn't resist or avoid.</p><p>If hit by the aftershock, Qing Hong wouldn't be able to maintain the jade pendant, exposing them to the eagles.</p><p>The true danger came from the three golden eagles!</p><p>Moreover, the immense scale of the battle between Void Refinement masters could attract other eagles. Qing Hong and Miss Shuang were outnumbered and outmatched. How could they escape?</p><p>They had flown for days, nearing the edge of the golden eagle territory, about to leave the range of the patrolling demon soldiers. Then, this unexpected incident occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darted around, quickly scanning the surroundings.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A stream of fire fell from the sky, crashing behind them, its inferno becoming their backdrop.</p><p>Qing Hong and Miss Shuang couldn't help but look back.  A fiery crater had appeared on the ground, the mountain peaks instantly vaporized.  A visible wave of intense heat blasted out from the sea of fire.</p><p>Where the heat wave passed, explosions rang out, mountain after mountain collapsing.</p><p>As Qin Sang anticipated, the aftershocks of the fire streams were terrifying. Qing Hong and Miss Shuang cried out in fear.</p><p>At that moment, they forgot their caution and hastily deployed their protective artifacts.</p><p>Miss Shuang's necklace flew up on its own. A crystal-clear heart-shaped pendant, like carved ice, appeared, forming a white protective shield around her.</p><p>Qing Hong flicked her sleeve, releasing several golden pages that swelled in the wind, transforming into golden screens, shielding her and Qin Sang.</p><p>They had barely activated their artifacts when the shockwave was upon them.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The shockwave slammed into their defenses, causing both women to groan.  They couldn't withstand the force, and were flung away.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>They were carried a great distance by the shockwave, until its force weakened and they crashed into a mountainside, finally brought to a halt.</p><p>The three were embedded in the mountain, but thankfully, their artifacts had protected them from injury. However, the jade pendant could no longer conceal their presence.</p><p>They leaped from the pit, immediately sensing several pairs of eyes watching from afar.</p><p>"We've been spotted!"</p><p>Qing Hong said in a low voice, a little agitated.</p><p>"Let's go another way, avoid them first," Qin Sang pointed in a direction.</p><p>Qing Hong and Miss Shuang had no better option than to follow Qin Sang's suggestion, hoping the three golden eagles would be deterred by the falling fire and wouldn't bother them.</p><p>Since they were already exposed, they flew at full speed.  The three golden eagles, indeed fearing the falling fire, didn't dare to pursue them directly.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Falling fire rained down behind them; they dodged repeatedly, narrowly escaping. The three golden eagles disappeared from their sight.  But Qing Hong and Miss Shuang's faces remained tense. The golden eagles wouldn't give up easily.  Once targeted by the Golden Eagle Clan, escape would be extremely difficult.</p><p>As the falling fire thinned, Qing Hong seized the opportunity to activate her jade pendant, concealing them.</p><p>Soon, three black dots appeared on the horizon—the three golden eagles had caught up!</p><p>Immediately, they found the three golden eagles, without hesitation, heading straight for them. The jade pendant was ineffective.</p><p>Clearly, the golden eagles possessed superior reconnaissance skills; perhaps they had been locked onto using an unknown method from the moment of their exposure.</p><p>Qing Hong cried out, pushing Qin Sang away.  "Junior brother, go!  Frost and I will hold these beasts off. If we get separated, meet us at Dongliang Mountain!"</p><p>Miss Shuang immediately summoned a jade sword, showing no fear.</p><p>Qing Hong thought her junior brother, experiencing this for the first time, might be overwhelmed or hesitant. She was about to offer more encouragement, but Qin Sang proved far more decisive than she expected, turning and running, only calling back, "Senior sisters, please be careful!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's retreating back, Qing Hong was slightly taken aback.</p><p>The golden eagles noticed their movements. One eagle separated from the others, apparently to pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>"You vile creatures, get down here!"</p><p>Qing Hong yelled, her golden screen transforming into several golden mountains, swinging down at the eagle.</p><p>This was a feint, to deter the eagle. Qing Hong charged towards the other two, leaving this one to Miss Shuang.</p><p>The three golden eagles varied in strength; the one chasing Qin Sang was of middling power.</p><p>Miss Shuang soared into the air, her body enveloped in frost, icy vapor swirling around her.</p><p>She made hand seals, silently chanting incantations.  The cold air solidified beside the eagle, instantly forming a head-sized piece of ice.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The ice shattered, releasing two ice phoenixes that cried out softly, attacking the eagle together.</p><p>The cold air enveloped the eagle.  Frost spread rapidly across its wings, its flapping producing cracking sounds.</p><p>"You dare defy me!"</p><p>The eagle, enraged, abandoned the pursuit of Qin Sang and engaged the ice phoenixes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang reached the riverbank.</p><p>A large river cut through the mountains, its waters rushing powerfully toward the outside of Lingkong Mountain. The deep, unfathomable river was rare in this desolate region.</p><p>Without hesitation, he leaped into the river, instantly swallowed by the waves and sinking beneath the surface, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>On the other side, Qing Hong faced two eagles, one being the strongest leader.  She had a treasure given by her master, so she wasn't afraid.  Miss Shuang was the weakest, but she was cherished by Mr. Lu and naturally had her own treasures.</p><p>Holding off the three golden eagles wasn't difficult; the problem was how to escape.</p><p>"Who are you? What's your connection to those people? What's your purpose in entering Lingkong Mountain!" the golden eagle leader roared.</p><p>Qing Hong scoffed. "If I were connected to them, a single finger from any of them could crush you. We're just passers-by, leaving Lingkong Mountain. We have no wish to fight the Golden Eagle Clan. Let us go, and we'll leave peacefully!"</p><p>"Stubborn fools!"</p><p>The eagle leader was arrogant. "Once we take you to the Golden Slaughter Platform, you'll stop talking so boldly!"</p><p>Qing Hong's face paled slightly. She had heard of the Golden Slaughter Platform's reputation; it was a brutal form of punishment in the Golden Eagle Clan, a sentence worse than death.</p><p>"Frost, once the junior brother is far away, we need to find a way to escape. These feathered beasts are overconfident; I suspect there are more of them nearby!"</p><p>Qing Hong knew they couldn't fight for long and secretly sent a message to Miss Shuang.</p><p>"Before we left, Master gave me a talisman…"</p><p>Hearing Miss Shuang's reply, Qing Hong rejoiced. The two women immediately devised an escape plan.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Qing Hong, assuming Qin Sang was far away, distanced herself from her opponent and threw the jade pendant from her palm.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The jade pendant shone brightly, emitting waves of sound like crashing tides.  Water spread out, forming a large blue hand with outstretched fingers.</p><p>The three-headed golden eagles felt a sudden darkness above them as a giant hand blotted out the sky and pressed down.</p><p>Meanwhile, as planned by the two women, Miss Shuang lured her opponent close, then lightly plucked a charm with her finger and sent it flying.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The charm transformed into a gust of freezing wind, instantly turning the surroundings blinding white with swirling snow. The piercing cold reached their very bones.  The wind spun into a massive vortex, pulling the three-headed golden eagles towards its center.</p><p>With the giant hand above and the blizzard around them, the two women, knowing they were about to leave Ling Kong Mountain and beyond the reach of the enemy soldiers, unleashed their master’s gifts without reservation, hoping for a swift victory.</p><p>A scream cut through the blizzard; one golden eagle was struck by the blue hand, spitting blood and falling grievously wounded.</p><p>In this critical moment, the golden eagle leader’s eyes flashed with ferocity. He let out a high-pitched, piercing cry that echoed far and wide, recalling his companions.  He crushed a gold charm, causing a strange energy to connect the three eagles, even the injured one.</p><p>The golden edges on their feathers flared, emitting a dazzling golden light that seemed almost solid. Then, a gigantic golden eagle emerged.  It resembled the leader but was entirely golden-feathered, majestic and defiant.</p><p>The giant golden eagle let out a powerful cry, raised itself, sheltered its companions under its wings, and used its head to block the blue hand.</p><p>Qing Hong, noticing the hand was stalled, looked uneasy.  Normally, such a combined attack would kill or severely injure ordinary golden eagles. The gold charm was clearly something extraordinary, suggesting the leader had a powerful backing.</p><p>Unwilling to let their hard work go to waste, the two women attacked with all their might. The blizzard raged, and the blue hand pressed down relentlessly.</p><p>*Crack… crack… crack…*</p><p>The giant golden eagle’s proud head was slowly forced down.  The previously injured eagle's flesh was torn, spraying blood, another was spitting blood, and bloodshot eyes and blood flowing from the feathers stained the leader’s face.</p><p>Suddenly, the golden eagle leader let out a cruel laugh, making the two women’s hearts leap into their throats.</p><p>*Screech!*</p><p>The next instant, an urgent eagle cry came from the horizon, accompanied by a burst of golden light that seemed to resonate with the giant eagle – reinforcements.  Despite the distance, the leader seemed to have received aid, gaining strength as golden markings spread across his body. A small golden eagle separated from him and flew into the larger one.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The giant eagle forced a crack in the blue hand. Its fierce eyes fixed on Miss Shuang, firing a golden bolt of lightning.</p><p>*Sizzle!*</p><p>Miss Shuang, focused on controlling the charm, watched helplessly as the golden lightning struck her protective barrier.  The pendant-formed shield shattered.</p><p>“Miss Shuang!”</p><p>Seeing Miss Shuang flung away by the lightning, Qing Hong cried out, rushing to catch her.  Relieved to find her still breathing, only injured by the strike, she hesitated only a moment.  Clutching Miss Shuang, Qing Hong fled.</p><p>Her face was filled with anxiety. The situation was dire; the leader was still alive, and their allies had arrived. Survival now seemed a long shot.</p><p>Just then, Qing Hong heard a familiar voice, a look of surprise flashing in her eyes. After a moment's hesitation, she leaped into the river.</p><p>With reinforcements arriving, the golden eagle leader would not let them escape.  He snorted coldly, suppressing the turmoil within him, and swooped down.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The wind ripped across the river's surface, sending water soaring into the air, forming two towering walls of water, as the eagle leader pursued them into the depths.</p><p>“Junior Brother?”</p><p>Qing Hong, holding Miss Shuang, escaped underwater, but saw no sign of Qin Sang, yet heard his command.</p><p>“Don’t move!”</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Qing Hong heard a sharp sound and noticed a transparent pill beside them, exploding in the water.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!*</p><p>More than one pill exploded simultaneously.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>When the other group of golden eagles arrived, they only saw the receding river water, the humans and eagles having vanished without a trace.</p><p>Then, a surge of black river water rose from the river's heart, rapidly spreading throughout the river, releasing a strange odor.  Instinctively, all the golden eagles backed away from the water's surface, where a golden eagle corpse floated.  It was shriveled, strangely contorted, its eyes still showing traces of agony, a gruesome sight.</p>
