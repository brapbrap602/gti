<h1># Chapter 1436: Gains and Losses</h1><p>The ice box rested in his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang, following his previous experience, attempted to break the seal.</p><p>Within the cave, pale white light intermittently erupted, the chilling air assailing him and forming a layer of frost on the walls.</p><p>The ice box vibrated frequently, but showed no signs of opening.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang ceased his efforts, frowning as he gazed at the ice box.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even with his transformed divine sense, he remained helpless against the seal on the ice box. Just now, he had tried every method he could think of.</p><p>Holding the ice box, Qin Sang sat motionless, his gaze distant, as if contemplating something.</p><p>His divine sense was no weaker than that of a Grand cultivator.</p><p>If he couldn't open the ice box even with this level of power, and still had no clue, there were only two possibilities: either his divine sense was still insufficient, or some special requirement had to be met.</p><p>If even a Grand cultivator couldn't open it, Qin Sang feared that he could only place the ice box in the Thousand Jun Bracelet (Thousand Jun Ring) and treat it as non-existent for the foreseeable future.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang's thoughts ran wild, connecting the theft of the ice box with the white-clothed man and the Myriad Demons Assembly.</p><p>As expected, he would personally attend the assembly.</p><p>"Old Devil Hunmo (Old Devil of Chaos) killed so many Nascent Soul cultivators of Xuantian Palace (Profound Sky Palace), forging a deadly feud. Will Xuantian Palace still participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly? As the largest event in the North Sea, it's the biggest exchange fair among Nascent Soul cultivators. If the white-clothed man is alive, he might appear on Hunmo Island (Chaos Devil Island). If Xuantian Palace wants to find the traitor and retrieve the ice box, they should send people to investigate in secret. I wonder if they have a way to sense the ice box; should I leave the ice box in the cave before going to Hunmo Island?"</p><p>As Qin Sang considered this, a flash of inspiration struck him.</p><p>He decided to do the opposite and take the ice box to Hunmo Island to test Xuantian Palace!</p><p>This Myriad Demons Assembly was the best opportunity.</p><p>Xuantian Palace was at odds with Old Devil Hunmo. Entering the Demon Path's (Demonic Path's) territory, they certainly wouldn't dare to act recklessly on Hunmo Island.</p><p>Furthermore, Ghost Mother (Guimu) had said that the state of the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace was unusual, possibly undergoing healing. With the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace unable to act, it would be difficult for others to restrain Qin Sang.</p><p>There were only two possible outcomes.</p><p>If he wasn't exposed, it meant that Xuantian Palace had no way to sense the location of the ice box, or Qin Sang's Demonic Flame Seal (Demonic Fire Seal) could isolate Xuantian Palace's detection.</p><p>He would then have no further worries.</p><p>He could slowly consider leaving the ice box for research or other uses.</p><p>If Xuantian Palace locked onto Qin Sang, it meant that the Demonic Flame Seal was ineffective.</p><p>He had no better way to hide the ice box.</p><p>Even if he could hide it for a while, as long as Xuantian Palace persistently searched, they would eventually lock onto him with their strength and vast power. Bringing it back to Beichen Realm (North Star Realm) wouldn't be safe either. Once the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace recovered and came knocking across the Storm Belt (Gale Belt), the trouble would be even greater.</p><p>It was unwise to antagonize the foremost power in the North Sea for an ice box that couldn't be opened.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't even clear about what was inside the ice box. It was likely a treasure related to the Ice Path (Way of Ice), which might not be useful to him.</p><p>If that was the case, it would be better to negotiate a deal with Xuantian Palace.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang didn't steal the ice box. As long as he expressed this intention, Xuantian Palace wouldn't need to offend a top expert and would definitely be eager to agree.</p><p>Taking advantage of the Palace Master of Xuantian Palace's weakness, Qin Sang could extract more benefits.</p><p>'Ding! Ding!'</p><p>Qin Sang gently tapped the ice box with his finger, carefully considering the matter. What could he get from Xuantian Palace?</p><p>First, undoubtedly, was the sea chart to the Central Province (Zhong Province).</p><p>Thinking of the sea chart, Qin Sang felt some doubt.</p><p>The sea chart wasn't a shameful treasure. With Ghost Mother's strength, if she wanted the sea chart, she could directly request to view it, and Xuantian Palace had no need to hide it.</p><p>Could it be that Ghost Mother's target was not just this?</p><p>Qin Sang secretly nodded, believing that the possibility was very high. Unfortunately, Tan Hao knew very little about Ghost Mother, otherwise he could make demands in this regard.</p><p>Second, the white-clothed man's cultivation technique (cultivation art).</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the white-clothed man was a rare Spirit Cultivator (Soul Cultivator) and was very interested in this kind of technique.</p><p>Third, Xuantian Palace had a long heritage, dominating a region. Their sect must have treasured countless ancient books, perhaps including secrets to breaking through to the Nascent Soul Late Stage (Nascent Soul Later Stage) and even the Transformation Stage (God Transformation Stage).</p><p>It depended on how valuable the ice box was and how much he could exchange for.</p><p>At the very least, he wanted some spirit pills (spiritual pills/elixirs) and magical artifacts (magic treasures), which Xuantian Palace could definitely provide.</p><p>Instead of risking making countless enemies and holding onto an ice box that he didn't know when he could open, it was better to exchange it for something that could help him in his cultivation.</p><p>For cultivators, the Great Dao (Grand Dao) was fundamental!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was weighing the pros and cons, he sensed that the restrictions of the cave had been triggered; Tan Hao had returned.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the ice box and incidentally took out the Divine Sun Tree (Godly Sun Tree) to take a look. He found that the aura of the flames on the tree was gradually turning deep red. Once it condensed into a Divine Sun Bird (Godly Sun Bird), it could be used by him.</p><p>He tried to subdue the Nanming Departing Fire (Southern Brightness Separating Fire) with the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, but as expected, the result was still a failure.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his magical artifacts and stood up to walk out of the cave, calling out to Tan Hao.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you've finally come out of seclusion."</p><p>Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>With the Myriad Demons Assembly approaching, he was worried that Qin Sang would miss it, but he didn't dare to disturb his secluded cultivation and was becoming anxious.</p><p>"Recently, the Myriad Demons Assembly has been the talk of the town, and many fellow cultivators have already set off. What have you decided, Brother Qin?"</p><p>"No rush."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "Did you find any information?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. He had long recorded the information he had gathered and handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang plunged his divine sense into it, quickly skimming over the less important details, focusing on the matter of Huang Longshi's (Yellow Dragon Hermit's) Traveling Palace's emergence.</p><p>Below the Nascent Soul Stage, Tan Hao already had few opponents.</p><p>He couldn't possibly know all the secrets, but he could find out six or seven tenths of them.</p><p>This matter had spread like wildfire.</p><p>Not only because of the appearance of Huang Longshi's Traveling Palace, but also because it was related to the feud between the largest sect in the North Sea and the foremost expert in the Boundless Sea (Endless Sea).</p><p>The location where Huang Longshi's Traveling Palace appeared was in a sea area in the eastern part of the Boundless Sea. Many people had suspected this before and searched there countless times, but without success.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo had likely been closely monitoring the area, so he noticed the signs as soon as they appeared.</p><p>The ones who discovered Huang Longshi's Traveling Palace were four Nascent Soul cultivators from Xuantian Palace, including an elder, who were tragically killed by Old Devil Hunmo when vying for treasure. Including Qi Wang and his companion, Old Devil Hunmo had brutally murdered several Nascent Soul cultivators in a short time.</p><p>There were also other rumors that several other demonic figures (devilish figures) participated in the massacre.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo and the others were willing to offend Xuantian Palace, so they must have obtained great benefits.</p><p>The Cold Bone Demonic Hand (Chilling Bone Demonic Hand) on the list likely came from Huang Longshi's Traveling Palace.</p><p>It was no secret in the Boundless Sea that Huang Longshi had once discovered a secret realm of the ancient Demonic Sect of Cold Bone Path (Chilling Bone Way) and obtained the Cold Bone Path's inheritance.</p><p>"It is said that there are more Cold Bone Path treasures at the Myriad Demons Assembly. Why is that old devil so eager to sell them? Could he really be in a hurry to exchange them for something? Tan Hao can't find out about these things; True Person Yinquan (Hidden Spring True Person) should know something, and it just so happens that I have something to look for him about."</p><p>Qin Sang put away his divine sense, pondered for a moment, and left the cave with Tan Hao.</p><p>After sending Tan Hao to a safe place near Hunmo Island, Qin Sang agreed on a method of contact with him, then changed direction and headed to Pearl Island (Mingzhu Island) alone.</p>
