<h1>Chapter 1445: The Ancient God Altar</h1><p>Chapter 1445: The Ancient God Altar</p><p>Qin Sang trailed far behind, noticing that Elder Ye seemed to be searching for something.  He led Su Nu and the others in a large circle around the area before stopping in front of an unremarkable hill.</p><p>Elder Ye stopped and examined the hill.  The hill was lush with vegetation, shaded by green trees, and a few ferocious beasts roamed its slopes. The scenery was pristine, untouched by human hands.</p><p>Looking down at the talisman in his hand, after a moment of careful sensing, Elder Ye nodded slightly and said, "This should be the place!"</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others were puzzled, unsure of what their master was searching for.</p><p>"Take these!"</p><p>Elder Ye produced several talismans.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they found that each talisman depicted a black dragon.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Ye turned his head and said, "Su Nu, come here."</p><p>Su Nu's heart tightened.  She suppressed her unease, stepped forward to greet him, and asked in a questioning tone, "Disciple is here. What are your instructions, Master Ye?"</p><p>"We need to break a restriction shortly. Your cultivation method is unique. Follow my commands…"</p><p>Elder Ye gave a few instructions.</p><p>Su Nu, though suspicious, nodded silently.</p><p>After giving his instructions, Elder Ye stepped forward, casually slaying the beasts within the area, then circled the hill before finally stopping in mid-air on the western side.</p><p>He lowered his head slightly, staring intently at the hill. Suddenly, he began to make hand seals, unleashing a series of incantations.</p><p>Spiritual energy vibrated.</p><p>In an instant, countless runes floated in the air above the hill, forming an exceptionally complex restriction. After much effort, Elder Ye finally stopped. He then produced over a dozen array flags, inserting each one into the restriction.</p><p>He was breathing heavily, visibly exhausted.</p><p>By now, the outline of the restriction was visible—a complex array floating in the void, majestic in appearance.  Without activation, its function remained unknown.</p><p>"You three, go there."</p><p>Elder Ye pointed towards the edge of the restriction.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and two others positioned themselves at three points around the restriction. Su Nu, as instructed by Elder Ye, also moved forward to the edge of the restriction.</p><p>Then, Elder Ye took out a jade pendant and suddenly unleashed his suppressed cultivation base!</p><p>An astonishing pressure instantly appeared in the void, bearing down on Elder Ye.  The very air seemed to warp.</p><p>Elder Ye stood in mid-air, unsupported.</p><p>His aura surged as his cultivation base was restored, but the pain he endured intensified. His bones cracked, and fissures appeared on his skin, worsening his injuries.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Elder Ye gritted his teeth and forcefully crushed the jade pendant.</p><p>A burst of brilliant light erupted.</p><p>Elder Ye bathed in the radiant light, his expression instantly easing. This light seemed to help him withstand the pressure from the restricted area.</p><p>However, he only had one jade pendant, and its power was limited.  Elder Ye dared not delay.  He dashed to the center of the array, sat cross-legged, and rapidly formed hand seals.</p><p>‘Hum…hum…’</p><p>The restriction was activated, and the spiritual array began to operate.</p><p>"Act!"</p><p>Elder Ye gave a light shout.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others had already prepared themselves. At his command, they immediately activated the talismans in their hands.</p><p>In an instant, dragon roars echoed through the mountains and forests.</p><p>Four black dragons roared out, each tens of meters long, their eyes full of power, majestic and imposing. Their powerful aura created a gale that raged through the mountains.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, hidden on a distant mountain, witnessed this scene.</p><p>His eyes flashed, recognizing the familiar scene.</p><p>Quickly, he recalled the memory.</p><p>During his first entry into the Seven Killing Hall, when he undertook a task for the East Pole Alliance, he had followed Xiang Yi into the Purple Mist Desolate Land.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had also used talismans to conjure black dragons to suppress the backlash of the Ancient God Altar's restraints, ultimately breaking the restriction.</p><p>The current situation was remarkably similar.</p><p>Only now, the black dragons were far larger and more powerful in aura than the black serpents used before.</p><p>The black dragons were wild and untamed.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others struggled greatly, finding it difficult to control them even with all their might.  Only Su Nu seemed completely at ease; the black dragon circled above her head, docile and obedient.</p><p>"The talismans are sealed with True Demon Qi?"</p><p>Su Nu sensed the familiar energy from the black dragon—the same True Demon Qi she cultivated.  Then, she heard Elder Ye’s voice, “Activate your cultivation technique, do as I say…”</p><p>Su Nu dared not disobey Elder Ye and meticulously followed his instructions.</p><p>With Su Nu’s participation, the other three black dragons calmed down considerably.</p><p>Finally, all the black dragons let out a mournful cry before plunging into the great array.</p><p>A thunderous boom echoed.  The great formation blazed with light, merging with the black dragon to form a colossal light sword that plunged towards the hills!</p><p>Piercing the hills with such a sword would have been easy.</p><p>But then, something astonishing happened.</p><p>Without warning, intense golden light erupted from within the hills, dazzlingly bright, forming a semi-circular shield.  Within the golden glow, the outline of a massive divine altar became visible.</p><p>“An ancient divine altar!”</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently. “No! It only resembles one. This is far grander than the one in the Purple Mist Wasteland, and the runes are far more complex. But it's certain these two altars are connected…”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Elder Ye roared, bringing his palm down forcefully.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The light sword struck the golden shield.</p><p>The shield was a kind of seal. The golden light was blinding, the mountains trembled, yet the ancient stone altar within remained unmoved.</p><p>The seal was incredibly strong, resisting the light sword.</p><p>But as they were locked in a stalemate, Elder Ye flicked his other hand, sending a talisman down. It moved slowly yet swiftly, lightly settling onto the shield's surface.</p><p>Simultaneously, the black dragons, formed from demonic energy, surged towards the talisman.</p><p>A humming sound. The black dragons, coiled around the talisman, pierced the light shield from the tip of the light sword.</p><p>Inside the shield, the altar’s seals were triggered. Four iron chains transformed into silver-white, countless lightning bolts striking upwards. The chains were also thundering restraints, but far more powerful than those of the Purple Mist Wasteland altar.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The black dragons were engulfed in lightning, the demonic energy dissipating, their size shrinking visibly, but they successfully protected the talisman.</p><p>Finally, the talisman landed on the altar.</p><p>Elder Ye breathed a sigh of relief, made a hand gesture, and the light sword shattered.  The flags forming the great formation were also heavily cracked, their power exhausted, unusable.</p><p>The golden light and the altar's image vanished.</p><p>Only a ravaged landscape remained, a testament to the extraordinary events that had taken place.</p><p>“This matter is concluded. We can go.”</p><p>The radiant light around Elder Ye faded as he sealed his cultivation.</p><p>He coughed a few times, his face flushed, his stance unsteady.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Su Nu stared blankly.</p><p>She thought the Merchant Guild was against her, that she might be used as a sacrifice again, so she desperately tried to escape and save herself. She colluded with outsiders to steal the Soul Cleansing Liquid and even killed her senior brother to extract information.</p><p>It turned out none of that was true. The Merchant Guild merely used her demonic power to suppress the black dragon.</p><p>Her frantic efforts seemed utterly ridiculous.</p><p>Su Nu felt a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
