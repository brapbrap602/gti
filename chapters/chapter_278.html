<h1>Chapter 271: An Invitation</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to comfort him.</p><p>Wanderer didn't need Qin Sang's
    sympathy either. He quickly put away his melancholy and smiled, "A moment of nostalgia, I've made you laugh, Brother
    Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>"Senior's unwavering Dao Heart is admirable."</p><p>Wanderer chuckled,
    then suddenly declared with heroic spirit, "The Dao is merciless! We cultivators must possess the unyielding spirit
    of never giving up. Otherwise, with so many talented individuals in the world, how many achieve Gold Core? Why
    should it be you or me? Only with this spirit can we face the heavens without shame and face the earth without
    guilt. Even if we die on the path, we can still smile on our way to the Yellow Springs."</p><p>(The original
    sentence is from Mencius: I face the heavens without shame and face the earth without guilt.)</p><p>He tilted his
    head slightly, his eyes bright. Though deep underground, his gaze seemed to pierce through the ancient ruins and fix
    upon the blue sky.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, recalling the past forty years. His journey to this point wasn't
    exactly as Wanderer said, seizing every opportunity and never giving up?</p><p>Just four words.</p><p>Never forget
    your original aspiration!</p><p>"Brother Qin, I'm not being alarmist. The two words 'Gold Core': 'Gold' represents
    an enduring, indestructible substance; 'Core' represents completeness, purity, and flawlessness. Brother Qin, your
    Qi Sea is injured, and I fear it may hinder your path to completeness. You should seek healing as soon as possible.
    Otherwise, if you wait until the Pseudo Core Realm to treat your injuries, time will be against you, and you will
    regret it."</p><p>Wanderer withdrew his gaze and offered this advice.</p><p>Qin Sang asked with a serious tone,
    "Senior, are there any examples of this?"</p><p>He had researched ancient texts at Shaohua Mountain but found that
    everyone's cultivation journey is unique. It's hard to determine the impact of his damaged foundation on forming a
    Gold Core.</p><p>Twenty years of practice has confirmed the feasibility of the "Spirit Refinement Sword Scripture,"
    which might be his most suitable cultivation method.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happens, he's confident in reaching
    the Pseudo Core Realm and attempting to form a Gold Core before his lifespan runs out. Even without Wanderer's
    reminder, Qin Sang knew he must start considering Core Formation now.</p><p>Prepare for the unexpected.</p><p>
    Wanderer slowly shook his head and said, "It's hard to say. The path of cultivation is like thousands of soldiers
    crossing a single-plank bridge, vying for a sliver of life. Fewer than one in ten Pseudo Core cultivators succeed in
    forming a Gold Core. Failure is common, making it difficult to determine the exact impact of a Qi Sea injury.
    However, every cultivator seeking the Gold Core will move heaven and earth, sparing no effort to improve their odds
    of success, even by a fraction. They would never miss a chance. Especially in our situation, we must find ways to
    compensate and strive for complete recovery."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then said, "To be honest, Senior, I've also
    been inquiring about healing methods. I've learned about the Harmony Pill, Five Mushroom Divine Paste, and Snow
    Ginseng Jade Life Pill. These might be effective for my injuries. They were all auctioned at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion
    by your sect. Do you know anything about them?"</p><p>"These..."</p><p>Wanderer glanced at Qin Sang. "The pills you
    mentioned, Brother Qin, are indeed top-tier for nurturing foundations. However, it won't be easy to buy them at the
    Taiyi Pill Pavilion. The main ingredients for these pills were reportedly discovered in an ancient medicinal garden
    and were limited. My sect only refined a small quantity to improve their alchemy skills. Since the auction,
    countless people, including major sects and rogue Gold Core cultivators, have sought these pills. It's unlikely any
    remain available. You can inquire at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, but those auctions were decades ago."</p><p>Qin Sang's
    heart sank. Twenty years ago, when he inquired at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, he'd noticed the auctions were long past
    and had a premonition, now confirmed by Wanderer.</p><p>Spiritual herbs are scarce in the current cultivation world,
    especially those required for pills like the Harmony Pill, which are born from the essence of heaven and earth and
    almost never appear outside ancient battlefields. Hence their rarity.</p><p>If he were to personally request
    them...</p><p>Qin Sang also understood the implication in Wanderer's words. The Taiyi Pill Sect doesn't just
    consider the price; they also aim to build connections. How could a Foundation Establishment cultivator compete with
    major sects and Gold Core masters?</p><p>Unless he's willing to bleed dry and be exploited, offering something truly
    enticing to the Taiyi Pill Sect.</p><p>Elder Earth Scarcity had gathered precious spiritual materials to refine the
    Primordial Unity Ring. Each one was incredibly valuable. Offering some might persuade the Taiyi Pill Sect.</p><p>
    However, unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to give these things up.</p><p>Elder Di Que meticulously
    collected these rare spiritual materials for so long; once given away, they might be impossible to find again.</p>
<p>Qin Sang had studied the refining method of the Hunyuan Tongxin Ring and discovered he only needed two more spiritual
    materials. This meant that after forming his Gold Core, he would only need to find these two materials to have
    another powerful magical treasure. The temptation was immense.</p><p>Of course, if he couldn't form his Gold Core,
    everything would be a pipe dream. In the end, if necessary, he'd have to trade them. But Qin Sang was only at the
    early stage of Foundation Establishment; he still had plenty of time to prepare.</p><p>"Thank you for your guidance,
    Senior. I understand."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, silently pondering his future path.</p><p>At this
    moment, Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment, then said, "Brother Qin, if you are interested in searching for such
    spiritual herbs, I know of a place, but I'm not sure if you'd be willing."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi in
    surprise.</p><p>"Senior, please tell me."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded. "Brother Qin, do you remember our first encounter
    at Changyang Market six months ago? I was preparing to travel west because I'd investigated a rumor about an ancient
    cultivator's cave. It was said that someone discovered a hidden passage inside, possibly leading to the cultivator's
    medicinal garden. I've spent six months investigating and believe there's a good chance it's true. The garden has
    just been discovered, so the spiritual herbs within likely haven't been harvested yet. Perhaps we can find what we
    need there. However, I'm afraid I'm not capable enough to do this alone, so I returned to find help. I wanted to
    mention this when we met in the Tianjing Secret Realm, but the mission delayed me. If you're interested, Brother
    Qin, I'd be happy to have you join me."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his first meeting with Yun Youzi at Changyang
    Market. Yun Youzi had indeed mentioned receiving information about a potential opportunity and needing to
    investigate.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't ready to immediately accept or refuse Yun Youzi's sudden invitation.</p>
<p>He still wanted to inquire at the Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion whether the three ingredients for the Heyun Pill were truly
    unavailable for auction.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's hesitation, Yun Youzi didn't press him, adding, "Brother Qin,
    there's no need to rush. Entering that cave isn't easy, and it won't open for another two or three years. We can
    discuss this further after we've escaped this dangerous situation."</p>
