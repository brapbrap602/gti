<h1>Chapter 620: The Pretty Boy</h1><p>Chapter 620: The Pretty Boy</p><p>After consuming the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, Qin Sang's foundational injuries healed, but his brow remained tightly furrowed.  </p><p>In the dimly lit cave, Qin Sang looked down at his dantian, silent for a long time.</p><p>His foundation had been restored, but his dantian and meridians were sealed by a forbidden spell.  He couldn't use or absorb spiritual energy, and couldn't replenish the missing trace of spiritual energy through cultivation techniques.</p><p>Taking pills or absorbing spirit stones was also ineffective; the forbidden spell blocked them outside his dantian.</p><p>It was like having a larger bottle, but the cap was welded shut.</p><p>If he formed the Golden Core first, then, when his spiritual energy surged during the process, and the Golden Core was nearly formed, would it affect the Golden Core if he then broke the forbidden spell and repaired the missing spiritual energy?</p><p>This order of events couldn't be taken lightly.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang wasn't entirely certain that the surge of spiritual energy would definitely break the forbidden spell.</p><p>After several unsuccessful attempts, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, opened his storage ring, and took out the jade bottle containing the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>If Yun Youzi hadn't exaggerated, the Three Lights Jade Liquid was unlike any other elixir.  Collected from the Gathering Spirit Bowl, the essence of heaven and earth was transformed into this jade liquid, nourishing the very source, from the inside out.</p><p>It provided an extremely abundant vitality, affecting the fundamental level, and should be able to bypass the forbidden spell.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid was extremely precious. Before finding the Gathering Spirit Bowl, it couldn't be replicated. Qin Sang only had half a bottle left, and he needed to save some for the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid.  Every drop was precious.</p><p>This divine medicine was reserved for critical life-or-death situations.</p><p>This was a pivotal moment for forming his Golden Core, not much different from a life-or-death struggle.  Without a breakthrough, there would be no future; regardless of how much he cherished it, he had to try.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The bottle cap opened.</p><p>Qin Sang had never been so careful.  He slowly poured out a single drop from the jade bottle.</p><p>The green liquid emitted an extraordinarily abundant vitality.  Qin Sang took a light sniff; his entire body felt relaxed and comfortable.</p><p>At that moment, in the corner of the cave, several stalks of grass grew in the crevices of the rocks. One, previously withered, quickly straightened its stem and leaned towards the center of the cave, as if yearning.</p><p>The other grasses were even more vibrant and full of life.</p><p>Once again sensing the aura of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel. Finally, he used his spiritual sense to guide the drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid into his mouth.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The jade liquid entered his body; the rich vitality instantly exploded.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a moan, and even felt like dancing. He felt every cell in his body throb with joy, restoring itself to its peak state.</p><p>An unprecedented sense of comfort spread throughout his body.</p><p>This feeling came too quickly, too violently, taking him completely by surprise and captivating him.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed himself, immediately inspecting his dantian.  To his surprise, after the Three Lights Jade Liquid entered his body, the spiritual energy in his dantian mysteriously increased slightly, repairing the deficiency.</p><p>His dantian was truly full!</p><p>However, the effects of the Three Lights Jade Liquid hadn't ended; the abundant vitality still flowed through Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly felt an intense itch on his left shoulder.</p><p>Feeling the change in his left shoulder, Qin Sang quickly withdrew his attention from within, lifted his clothes on his left shoulder, and saw a faint green light shimmering where the closed wound once was.</p><p>This green light represented the power of the Three Lights Jade Liquid!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly activated his body regeneration technique. The inexplicable obstruction at the wound disappeared, and flesh buds began to wriggle.</p><p>Simultaneously, the jade liquid energy accumulated in his body finally found its purpose, converging towards his left arm, accelerating the regeneration of his severed arm.</p><p>For cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage or higher, body regeneration wasn't difficult.</p><p>However, before this, Qin Sang had tried various body regeneration techniques and consumed many healing elixirs, all to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the aftereffects of the 'Severing Body Puppet Secret Technique' would certainly be very difficult to deal with, and couldn't be resolved overnight, so he had given up.  Elder Di Que was a Golden Core cultivator, and his methods were surely more numerous than his own.  Even he couldn't regenerate his limb, resulting in his name 'Di Que' (meaning 'Earth Lack').</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid truly could counteract the aftereffects of the 'Severing Body Puppet Secret Technique'!</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed a look of delight, but he wasn't too surprised; he had actually had a premonition.</p><p>However, he hadn't thought of using the Three Lights Jade Liquid to treat his left arm.</p><p>He wasn't a body cultivator, and he didn't have a suitable body refinement method for the time being.  An incomplete limb wouldn't significantly affect his strength; missing an arm was just missing an arm.</p><p>A mere severed arm wasn't worth wasting a precious drop of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, so Qin Sang hadn't considered it before.</p><p>If it hadn't been for the limitations in forming his Golden Core, this arm might have had to wait until he faced life-threatening danger, and was forced to consume the Three Lights Jade Liquid, before it could be restored.</p><p>The regrowth of his left arm was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Fueled by abundant life energy, the arm regenerated quickly, a pristine white limb emerging.  During this process, a green bioluminescence shimmered, benefiting the wild plants in the cave; they grew wildly, their stems and leaves becoming exceptionally thick.</p><p>Among them, a medicinal herb called the Blue Dan Fruit rapidly sprouted, its branches reaching almost to the cave ceiling, eventually bearing dozens of fruits.  The abundant harvest bent the branches, the fruits hanging down.</p><p>Blue Dan Fruit is a decent spirit fruit, aiding Qi Condensation cultivators in their practice.  Beasts also enjoy it; it was likely a black eagle that ate the fruit and left the pit here.</p><p>Then, a sudden change occurred.  The wild plants, having reached their peak, began to wither and die, their life force dissipating; this included the Blue Dan Fruit tree.  In an instant, they experienced the full cycle of growth and decay.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the strange state of the plants, his gaze sharpening. He looked up at the Blue Dan Fruit tree, picked a fruit, and took a bite.  It remained sweet and juicy, but lacked any medicinal properties—mere appearance.</p><p>It seemed only the medicinal herbs nurtured within the Immortal Ban of the Purple Micro Palace's Hanging Garden could withstand the accelerated growth from the Three Lights Jade Liquid and undergo transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, cleared the debris from the cave, and raised his restored left arm, testing its grip. The new arm felt somewhat unfamiliar.  While he hadn't practiced any body refinement techniques, his cultivation from Qi Condensation to False Core had strengthened his body, though not to the level of a body cultivator.</p><p>His regenerated left arm was as soft as a baby's, noticeably different from his right.  Qin Sang conjured a mirror of ice, discovering his skin was exceptionally fair, making him look at most twenty years old, even younger than his age after forming the Core.</p><p>Time had left some marks on his face before, but they were now gone. This was thanks to the Three Lights Jade Liquid, and likely also due to the restoration of his foundation.</p><p>"Turned into a pretty boy," Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>The arm wasn't a major issue; some time spent refining it with spiritual energy would make it identical to his right arm.  Since his spiritual sense also needed time to recover, he could work on both at once.</p><p>His foundation was healed, his arm had regenerated.  All that remained was the final push.  Qin Sang's worries vanished, and he once again entered a state of deep meditation, focusing on his recovery.</p>
