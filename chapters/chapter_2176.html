<h1>Chapter 2166 The Thunder General</h1><p>The energy within the Golden Book was activated, and Qin Sang immediately sensed something unusual.  Before he could react, the energy spread rapidly, extending outside the hut.</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert, his spiritual sense spreading out.  His eyes flashed.</p><p>“There’s an array hidden here!”</p><p>As he suspected, a concealed spirit array, triggered by the Golden Book, became visible.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly activated the array he had previously set up, creating an invisible barrier that enveloped the entire mountain peak, preventing the energy fluctuations from spreading.  Unless someone possessed extremely sensitive perception or used powerful detection techniques, they wouldn't detect any changes here.</p><p>Inside the hut:</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the stone platform, his eyes closed, a look of surprise on his face.  He could sense the power of the spirit array, yet he couldn't determine its origin.</p><p>If he were to try breaking the array now, he would be at a loss.  This was partly because the array didn't pose a threat; it showed no signs of hostility.</p><p>Logically, the hut should be the core of the array.  After careful sensing, Qin Sang felt as though something was missing.</p><p>He looked at the Golden Book.  It had opened itself, revealing glowing golden runes, vibrant and luminous.</p><p>Gradually, the Golden Book began to melt, and the golden runes materialized, swirling before Qin Sang.</p><p>Countless golden runes danced before his eyes, a dazzling spectacle.  After waiting a moment, Qin Sang noticed that the runes weren't merging with the array.  He extended his right hand.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The golden runes spiraled towards his palm.  In an instant, the golden light converged, forming a golden mark imprinted on his palm.</p><p>The mark consisted of extremely intricate runes and patterns.  Qin Sang examined it, unable to decipher its meaning, but he could sense a connection between the mark and the array.</p><p>This mark was precisely what the array was missing!</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to activate the mark.  The array’s configuration shifted; the surroundings blurred, and everything began to distort.</p><p>The hut, the stone platform—everything seemed like an illusion, capable of being broken and reassembled. Yet Qin Sang was certain of their reality.  The changes originated within him; he was being affected by the array.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang realized that he was enveloped by the array's power, a force with a pulling sensation, as if drawing him into an unknown realm.</p><p>This made Qin Sang hesitate.  Entering might lead to treasure, or it might lead to danger.</p><p>He summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly and together they activated their Sky Eye ability, focusing on the center of the spirit array, attempting to penetrate the illusion and see its true nature.</p><p>Despite their combined efforts, all they saw was a bright silver light—likely lightning.</p><p>Although they couldn't see what lay ahead, the presence of lightning eased Qin Sang’s concerns somewhat.  He possessed the legacy of the Five Thunder Academy and considered himself proficient in the Way of Thunder.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, ceasing his resistance. He felt himself being drawn in.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang disappeared.</p><p>The hut returned to normal, the spirit array's power vanishing without a trace, as if it had never existed.</p><p>The stone platform was empty; the Golden Book was gone.</p><p>…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Upon arriving, Qin Sang immediately heard deafening thunder.  The scene before him grew clearer.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s feet landed on solid ground.  He gazed ahead in astonishment.</p><p>Dark clouds filled the sky, completely obscuring the heavens, leaving not a single gap.  Lightning flashed and thunder boomed; countless serpents of lightning danced in the clouds, ferocious and menacing.</p><p>The lightning seemed endless, illuminating the earth.  Through the flashes, Qin Sang saw a magnificent palace, towering into the clouds, its peak almost touching the sky, surrounded by countless thunderbolts.</p><p>It seemed to be a thunder palace, a majestic structure, with lightning striking it constantly, yet causing no damage.</p><p>This was clearly not the original island. Qin Sang didn't know where he’d been taken.</p><p>He touched the mark on his palm, sensing its power, confirming that he could leave whenever he activated it. Reassured, he focused on observing his surroundings.</p><p>Dark clouds obscured the sky, shrouding the land in gloom.  The earth seemed paved with black stone, vast and empty, save for the Thunder Palace.  It wasn't just a single hall; rather, a complex of grand halls and towering walls, separating the inner and outer sections.</p><p>The main gate, directly facing him, was centrally located, its golden roof and vermillion paint gleaming.  The gate remained firmly shut.</p><p>The Thunder Palace exuded an otherworldly aura.  Anyone could see its extraordinary nature, sensing the potential for great opportunity within.  However, entry was far from easy.  Powerful restrictive energies emanated from the palace, their vibrations palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the gate.  A reckless charge would be suicidal; the proper approach was through the main entrance.</p><p>The thunder continued relentlessly.  Inside the palace, a deathly silence reigned; it felt uninhabited.</p><p>Qin Sang darted towards the gate.  As he neared, his expression changed, and he abruptly halted.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A bolt of lightning descended from the heavens, landing before the gate, transforming into a colossal figure.</p><p>The being was imposing, towering sixty feet tall, almost matching the gate's height.  It was clad in shimmering silver armor, seemingly forged from lightning itself, making it appear all the more majestic.</p><p>Its enormous, copper-bell eyes blazed with the intensity of lightning, exuding an intimidating aura. It stood guard before the gate, resembling a thunder god.</p><p>Beside this thunder general, Qin Sang looked minuscule.</p><p>The general looked down upon Qin Sang, its eyes filled with fierce malice, roaring, "Who dares trespass?!"</p><p>With the roar, lightning converged in the general's palm, instantly forming a spear over thirty feet long.  The general gripped the spear firmly, and with a forceful thrust, the earth shook violently.</p><p>Qin Sang, eyes narrowed, remained cautious.  He bowed and said, "I found a token that led me here; I am unaware of the situation.  May I ask, esteemed General, where is this place?"</p><p>He waited for a moment, receiving no reply.</p><p>Frowning, Qin Sang looked up at the general.  It stood rigid as a statue, spear in hand, glaring but motionless.  </p><p>The rage in its eyes seemed almost real, yet Qin Sang sensed no life force emanating from it.</p><p>"So, it's an inanimate construct…"</p><p>Qin Sang peered through the general's legs at the archway, thinking to himself.</p><p>Seeing the general's immobility, Qin Sang attempted to take a step forward.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A silver lightning bolt shot from the spear's tip, striking towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared for this, quickly retreated, the lightning narrowly missing him.</p><p>The general remained poised, but didn't attack again. This strike was a warning; further intrusion would provoke a full assault.</p><p>The ground trembled, unharmed save for a white mark that was slowly fading. Qin Sang’s expression grew grave.</p><p>That attack possessed the power of a late-stage Transcendent cultivator!</p><p>Anyone lacking sufficient strength should turn back; even this initial guardian was insurmountable.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was no ordinary mid-stage Transcendent cultivator, and he wasn't alarmed. The situation was clear: he needed to defeat the general to enter the palace, and likely face even greater challenges beyond.</p><p>The sacred ground was a trial created by the Yi Ren clan to test their descendants. The greater the risk, the greater the reward—a rule that usually held true.</p><p>This battle was unavoidable.  A blue light flashed behind Qin Sang, revealing his phoenix wings.  With a gentle flap, he soared into the air, matching the general's height.</p><p>Their eyes met.  Qin Sang secretly activated his Dantian, summoning the third-order Taiyi Lei Gang Talisman.</p><p>Years ago, to aid Taiyi's transformation, he had thoroughly mastered this talisman, creating a divine talisman imprint within his Dantian. Now, he could conjure the talisman without external materials or tools, making it essentially a mastered lightning technique.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang prepared to attack, the general's eyes widened, letting out a furious roar.  Raising its spear, it pointed it at Qin Sang.</p><p>"So, it doesn't attack just from proximity; it only acts aggressively once the intruder shows hostility."</p><p>This thought struck Qin Sang; an ominous feeling washed over him.  Lightning flickered at the spear's tip. The spear shot out like a dragon, transforming the general into a streak of blindingly fast silver lightning.</p><p>He poured all his energy into activating the talisman imprint. The Taiyi Lei Gang Talisman materialized instantly, forming a halo above him. The halo blazed with light, unleashing an unending torrent of lightning power. Lightning and dark clouds intertwined, the heavens seeming to boil.</p><p>At that moment, it was impossible to distinguish between the existing lightning and the power Qin Sang commanded.  The lightning coalesced into eight thunder dragons, roaring heavenward, thrashing their tails, charging at their enemy.</p><p>The next instant, the eight thunder dragons collided with the silver lightning.  The impact was earth-shattering; even the lightning in the clouds seemed to pause for a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated, dodging the attack.  His expression changed slightly as he sensed something amiss.</p><p>A massive ball of lightning appeared at the point of impact, filled with raging thunder power.  Half of it belonged to Qin Sang, but he found that the lightning was slowly slipping from his control.</p><p>He stared at the center of the ball. The thunder general was engulfed in lightning, yet its momentum increased instead of decreasing. The lightning striking it and its spear was actually being absorbed.</p><p>The lightning talismans Qin Sang had cast, instead of killing his opponent, became nourishment for it, only delaying the enemy for a moment!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning ball was torn apart by the spear, and the thunder general charged out.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an extremely sharp energy lock onto his forehead, its power immense!</p><p>He remained calm, instantly using the lightning escape technique, transforming into blue lightning and retreating at high speed, but the threat behind him persisted.</p><p>The thunder general pursued relentlessly.  Though its speed wasn't as fast as his, it was still astonishing.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang could escape using the mark; the thunder general probably wouldn't follow him. But there was a delay between activating the mark and leaving, however short, and in a fight between experts, it was enough to determine life or death.  If someone else, overestimating themselves, had provoked the thunder general, they very likely would have died here!</p><p>Many cultivators from the Otherworld Race perished this way each time the Sacred Ground opened.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't flee. Although the thunder general was strong, it wasn't a threat to him.</p><p>His mind moved swiftly, and the power of lightning reappeared. The Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman was easily broken, and Qin Sang again used lightning magic.</p><p>The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal emerged, its power far surpassing the Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman; moreover, it was forged with Azure Phoenix True Lightning!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Blue lightning descended, striking the thunder general squarely.</p><p>Sensing the threat, the thunder general raised its spear and thrust it at the blue lightning.  A blinding silver light flashed, and a thick bolt of lightning shot from the spear.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The blue and silver lightning collided. The tip of the silver lightning instantly shattered, then crumbled piece by piece.</p><p>The thunder general's spear moved rapidly, using some unknown lightning technique, instantly transforming into countless spear shadows, with lightning power surging.</p><p>The next moment, the spear shadows continually shattered against the blue lightning, the battlefield filled with blue and silver lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang closely watched the battle. He wanted to verify something, and after a moment, he made a discovery.</p><p>The thunder general still tried to absorb the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, but not as smoothly as before. After a moment, a distorted roar echoed, and the thunder general fled in panic, looking exceptionally clumsy even with its ability to reduce the power of the lightning; cracks appeared on its spear.</p><p>This showed that the thunder general's ability to absorb lightning had a limit. Otherwise, wouldn't a cultivator who only used lightning magic be helpless against it?</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang believed there was more than one way to counter the thunder general's ability. A pure lightning cultivator, with sufficient mastery of the Way of Lightning, might find other methods to restrain it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't need to go to such trouble, nor did he want to waste too much time on this thunder general; lightning magic was only one of his many skills.</p><p>Having verified his guess, Qin Sang noticed the thunder general's spear gradually repairing itself.  He immediately stopped holding back, flicking his sleeve, and sending sword light flying out!</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword flashed, its sword shadow disappearing, the surroundings instantly plunged into darkness, the lightning vanishing, transforming into a boundless star sea.</p><p>The thunder general was surrounded by sword stars, isolated and helpless, but its ferocity remained undiminished; it raised its spear and attacked the nearest star.</p><p>Previously, the thunder general's wild attacks might have broken the sword formation.</p><p>Now, however, Qin Sang had deduced the Eastern Azure Dragon Sword Formation, its power incomparable to before.  Sadly, the Vermilion Bird was absent, and the southern star field was not as brilliant as before.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Sword stars left their positions, transforming into meteors, smashing towards the thunder general.</p><p>The thunder general wielded its spear with unparalleled power, deflecting and exploding sword stars, but more continued to attack.</p><p>After a series of attacks, Qin Sang had thoroughly investigated the thunder general. It possessed the power comparable to a late Nascent Soul cultivator, but only superficially.</p><p>A true late Nascent Soul cultivator possessed great wisdom and uncanny abilities, while the thunder general's attacks were blunt and reckless, only knowing how to fight desperately.</p><p>The sword technique suddenly changed!</p><p>Three star seas shifted, their starlight overlapping. Seeing the moment was right, Qin Sang finally used the stacked formation technique.</p><p>Dragon's roar, tiger's howl, phoenix's cry shook the heavens!</p><p>Three star fiends manifested, circling above the thunder general, then merging into a single holy beast which plunged down.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The spear shattered.</p><p>The thunder general roared repeatedly, resisting fiercely for a while, but was finally cut down.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword returned to Qin Sang's sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards where the thunder general had fallen. He saw a bolt of lightning fly into the sky and into the clouds, leaving behind a thunder crystal that floated towards him.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>This was yesterday's chapter. Today's chapter will be late.</p>
