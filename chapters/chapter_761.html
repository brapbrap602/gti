<h1>Chapter 753: The Third Transformation</h1><p>A halo drifted towards Qin Sang, flickering before transforming into a magnificent suit of iridescent armor, fitting him perfectly.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had successfully completed its third transformation.</p><p>However, its appearance remained unchanged â€“ round, plump, with iridescent skin.</p><p>Spirit insects typically undergo some visible change with each transformation. For instance, the Skyeye Butterfly's wings would reveal open eyes after its third transformation, granting it new powers.</p><p>Only this Fat Silkworm was peculiar. It had devoured numerous poison pills and demon cores, seemingly to no effect.</p><p>After its second transformation, the insect could emit an iridescent halo capable of neutralizing poisons, raising Qin Sang's expectations. Yet, the third transformation didn't appear to grant any new abilities.</p><p>Only the iridescent halo had become more substantial, now capable of forming shimmering threads and condensing into a tangible poison-repelling armor, fulfilling Qin Sang's dream.</p><p>Although the Skyeye Butterfly's innate power wasn't exceptional, it could control lightning, possessing considerable combat strength, and becoming a valuable asset after its transformation.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, however, remained comically plump and vulnerable.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had slumbered for a long time, and its transformation was recent. Qin Sang wondered if its abilities were too subtle for him to detect, or if there was another reason.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Fat Silkworm wasn't his natal insect but had chosen Ya Gu as its master. He couldn't communicate directly with it, and no matter how intelligent it was, it couldn't accurately express complex ideas.</p><p>Notably, the Fat Silkworm's transformation wasn't without merit; it was even a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt the connection between Ya Gu and the silkworm strengthen. If the bond was once a spider's thread, it was now as thick as a rope.</p><p>Ya Gu remained a sleeping beauty, but her primordial spirit was more stable than before.</p><p>After the transformation, the Fat Silkworm often slept in his hand, its instinctive intimacy and dependence, pure and untainted, giving Qin Sang the illusion of being with Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how long Ya Gu's condition would last, but the Fat Silkworm had bought him precious time to solve the Heavenly Corpse Talisman problem, a significant boon.</p><p>The difficulty of a spirit insect's third and fourth transformations was vastly different, comparable to a cultivator forming their core and nascent soul.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly's transformation wasn't as easy as the Fat Silkworm's. After consuming the Redfire Gold Liquid for its third transformation, little would be left, and its effectiveness for the fourth transformation was uncertain.</p><p>Further troubling Qin Sang, after the Fat Silkworm's third transformation, the effectiveness of demon cores from poisonous beasts, like the poison pills before, drastically diminished.</p><p>He had traded for a core from a mid-Core Formation stage poisonous fish at a market, and the result was the same.</p><p>He didn't know if the core's grade was too low or if the Fat Silkworm's tastes had changed.</p><p>He might be able to hunt late-stage demon beasts in the future, but a core from a Transformation stage demon was beyond his reach.</p><p>In short, nurturing the Fat Silkworm would remain challenging, let alone facilitating its fourth transformation. He couldn't place all his hopes on it.</p><p>Of course, the Fat Silkworm had undoubtedly improved after its transformation.</p><p>Before, the poison-repelling armor would likely have struggled against the pervasive poisonous fog. Now, as Qin Sang withdrew his protective true essence, the fog touched the armor and was effortlessly repelled, his skin feeling no sting.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm crawled into his sleeve, comfortable and unburdened.</p><p>Protected by the armor, Qin Sang withdrew his true essence, feeling much lighter.</p><p>He then commanded the Fat Silkworm to keep the armor tightly adhered and concealed, undetectable to casual observation.</p><p>Being surrounded by Purple Star Eagles wasn't the greatest threat; the astonishing energy drain from resisting the poisonous fog was what truly terrified cultivators.</p><p>With the fog no longer a threat, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, contemplating his escape.</p><p>His position was precarious, facing the brunt of the beasts' assault, deep within the eagle swarm, with potentially more eagles approaching. Charging forward would be unwise.</p><p>The situation was chaotic, and he couldn't grasp the full extent of the unfolding events.</p><p>Their initial scattered formation for the ritual had been completely disrupted. He couldn't hear any sounds from elsewhere, and he assumed others were in the same predicament.</p><p>He didn't know the whereabouts of the subterranean beast and feared a chance encounter.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected their breach of the stone hall's restrictions had triggered the beasts' sudden appearance. If so, there would undoubtedly be more, with countless beasts converging on their location from the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>The thought of being engulfed by a sea of beasts sent chills down his spine.</p><p>The wisest course of action was to regroup with the others and escape the forbidden zone.</p><p>Surrounded by eagles, the Purple Weasel corpses he had collected were useless.</p><p>Time was of the essence. Qin Sang made his decision, his sword angled, carving a bloody path.  In his hand, the Ebony Sword danced like a dragon, flashed like lightning, its song echoing constantly.</p><p>Unburdened by the poisonous fog, Qin Sang unleashed his full power, advancing rapidly.</p><p>He chose not to deploy the Ten Yama Banners yet, as this would clearly be a protracted battle, and the banners consumed far more energy than the Ebony Sword.</p><p>He could still hold his own for now.</p><p>Eagle carcasses piled up at his feet, blood flowing, pooling into rivers, each step leaving a bloody imprint.</p><p>Qin Sang, consumed by the fight, focused on the stone hall's direction, charging towards it.  He had retreated a considerable distance to avoid the subterranean beast's initial charge, but returning proved unexpectedly arduous.</p><p>'Buzz...'</p><p>The Ebony Sword, sensing its master's ferocity, vibrated, drinking its fill of blood.</p><p>Blood couldn't stain the pure blade, but after slaying so many eagles, it shone brighter, its thirst for slaughter growing.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind remained calm, unaffected by his cultivation technique or his natal sword, his gaze fixed ahead, forging a bloody path.</p><p>After some distance, the encirclement thinned, and he saw a pale white glow.</p><p>"The Bone Lotus's protective shield!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. "Xiang Yi is out?"</p><p>He immediately channeled his full power into the sword, its aura exploding, cleaving through the eagles with wide, sweeping strokes.</p><p>The figure opposite also noticed the commotion and moved towards Qin Sang, coming to his rescue.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two more eagles were decapitated, opening a path between them, and Qin Sang finally saw the person shielded by the Bone Lotus.</p><p>"Cui Ji?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it wasn't Xiang Yi under the white light, but Cui Ji!</p><p>The Bone Lotus was somehow in Cui Ji's possession, while Xiang Yi was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Cui Ji held the Bone Lotus in one hand and the Purple Nether Orb in the other, the orb's light thick and substantial, clearly charged and ready.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Cui Ji grinned.  "Demon Daoist, I've been waiting for you! This time, I'll see where you run!"</p>
