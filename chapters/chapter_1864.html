<h1>Chapter 1855: Divine Light Reappears</h1><p>Seven tapir demons formed a crescent, blocking Qin Sang from the mountain.  </p><p>Though their appearances differed, their gazes towards Qin Sang were identical, their strength and auras indistinguishable.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>The adult tapir demon in the center raised its head, emitting a bellow that resonated with strange vibrations.  The seven tapir demons' eyes glowed crimson, radiating malevolent energy.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang charged.</p><p>Before him lay a scene of deceptive realism: mist shrouded a lush mountain, a river like a jade ribbon winding below.</p><p>Were it not for these ferocious tapir demons, it could almost be mistaken for a fairyland.</p><p>The scene was all a manifestation of Ding Xiang Hou's dream.</p><p>Yet, the malevolence was palpable, Qin Sang's senses acutely registering the reality of it all, then flashes of white filled his vision.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The seven tapir demons instantly surrounded Qin Sang.  Only seven streaks of white light were visible to the naked eye, their forms obscured.</p><p>A blinding white surrounded Qin Sang, the tapirs seemingly attempting to disorient him. The seven white lights moved at incredible speed, weaving a white ball.</p><p>Within the ball, Qin Sang felt the chaotic energy around him, attacks potentially coming from all directions, impossible to defend against.</p><p>However, through the eyes of the Heaven-seeing Butterfly, the demons' movements were perfectly clear, their attempt to cloud Qin Sang's mind futile.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, charging forward, disregarding the number or position of the tapirs. Raising his right palm, he channeled his Buddha Seal power, a golden giant hand smashing outwards.</p><p>Piercing roars assaulted Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The seven tapir demons attacked simultaneously.</p><p>Two on Qin Sang's flanks lunged for his ribs, while the three behind him advanced in unison, all in their physical forms, their claws aiming to rip through his back, to pierce his heart.</p><p>Those directly in front, a young tapir and a humanoid one, stood rigidly together, ready to meet the Buddha hand and momentarily obstruct Qin Sang.</p><p>This coordinated assault seemed inescapable.</p><p>But Qin Sang unexpectedly retreated, spinning around, his gaze fixed on the three tapir demons behind him, his strike following his body's turn, one palm descending!</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The three tapir demons were struck squarely on the forehead, a dull thud echoing as they crumbled, turning into three wisps of white smoke dissolving into the surrounding mist.</p><p>The remaining four tapir demons momentarily froze, the flanking demons having also missed their target.</p><p>Seven demons attacking, yet not a single scratch on Qin Sang, three instantly annihilated.</p><p>The surviving four retreated, Qin Sang relentlessly pursuing, several more palms eliminating two more.</p><p>Within the mountain, Ding Xiang Hou’s eyelids fluttered slightly, but he did not awaken.</p><p>The final two tapir demons surrendered, falling under Qin Sang’s power.</p><p>The path was clear, yet Qin Sang remained unconvinced, continuing his relentless advance through Ding Xiang Hou's dream, charging towards the mountain peak.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang silently formed a thunder incantation, the Divine Thunder Seal in his dantian radiating light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderclap shook the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Thunder illuminated the entire dream, a Heavenly Thunder Seal forming, the sky awash in silver light.</p><p>Under the thunder's might, all evil was subdued. The misty, dreamlike landscape momentarily cleared.</p><p>The thunder's power reached its zenith, a heavenly thunderbolt striking the mountain peak, followed by a rain of thunder and lightning, obscuring the sky, a terrifying spectacle seeming to obliterate Ding Xiang Hou's dream.</p><p>At that moment, the surrounding scene distorted. The mountain and all its scenery vanished, replaced by a massive thundercloud.</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou’s true form was hidden within the cloud, seemingly floating in the sky, the cloud itself echoing with thunder, lightning constantly flashing, lightning serpents intertwining with the external lightning.</p><p>The thundercloud merged with the surrounding lightning and thunder, or rather, Ding Xiang Hou proactively altered the dream, blending with the environment rather than resisting.</p><p>Because of this, the power of Qin Sang's thunder talisman was undiminished, but its destructive effect on the dream was greatly reduced, making it impossible to destroy the dream and harm Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the profound mystery of dream cultivation, capable of adapting to any attack with infinite imagination.</p><p>No divine power is perfect; it always has limitations.  However, Qin Sang didn't have the time to unravel Dingxiang Hou's dream bit by bit.</p><p>Amidst the thunder, swirling clouds in the sky morphed and the seven monsters reappeared, identical to before.</p><p>As expected, no matter how many illusory forms were slain, as long as Dingxiang Hou wasn't exhausted and could continue to manipulate the dream, the illusory forms would regenerate.</p><p>'Moo!'</p><p>The seven monsters lunged forward, preventing Qin Sang from approaching the thundercloud.</p><p>Having learned from previous encounters, they acted with far more coordination this time.  Instead of immediately surrounding Qin Sang, they spread out before her, forming a formation, their unity enabling exceptionally close cooperation.</p><p>Undeterred, Qin Sang showed no hesitation, charging directly into the formation.</p><p>A strange glint flashed in the eyes of the seven monsters, their actions frenzied as they unleashed a furious assault on Qin Sang.</p><p>The dream world descended into chaos.</p><p>The battlefield was awash with white light, obscuring Qin Sang and the seven monsters. Only the continuous roars, impacts, and the shrill scraping sound—like fingernails on armor—were audible.</p><p>Within moments, the white light expanded by almost double, and the tapir monster's roars became increasingly urgent.</p><p>Clearly, even with the seven monsters' formation, they couldn't contain Qin Sang.  They themselves were frequently in danger, forced to widen their encirclement.</p><p>At this point, the power of the thunder talismans waned, and the lightning and fire in the dream were fading, nearing their end.</p><p>The thundercloud hung motionless, Dingxiang Hou within unharmed, his eyelids fluttering rapidly.</p><p>Sensing something, Qin Sang abruptly looked up at the thundercloud, a look of surprise crossing her face.</p><p>A mass of white energy was gathering at the edge of the thundercloud, forming a new jade bottle.</p><p>The shape of the new jade bottle was indistinguishable from the magical treasure she already knew, which was currently locked in combat with the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>"Could there be two jade bottles?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face grew grave.</p><p>If this were a dream manifestation, could it conjure a magical treasure of nearly equal power?</p><p>In a flash of thought, the dream jade bottle drifted towards the battlefield, mirroring the actions of the real treasure. Its spout tilted, spilling white smoke.</p><p>The smoke billowed, forming a vast white mist river in the air, its momentum no less impressive than the river created by the real jade bottle.</p><p>"Such potent dream-weaving power!"</p><p>Abandoning any remaining hope for an easy victory, Qin Sang flicked her sleeve, sending a cold glint flying. In mid-air, it manifested as a four-headed dragon seal.</p><p>Four dragons unfurled from the seal, surrounded by soaring icy flames.</p><p>Their massive bodies writhed in the flames, their fierce eyes fixed on the white mist river as they swooped down.</p><p>Unflinching, the four dragons, harnessing their endless icy flames, charged into the heart of the river.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The river roared, deafeningly loud.</p><p>The mist thrashed, and giant waves crashed, with the shadows of the dragons faintly visible beneath the surface.</p><p>The collision of icy flames and white mist was earth-shattering.</p><p>In an instant, wave after wave exploded in the air, eclipsing the thunder.</p><p>At the same time, the four dragons, their bodies undulating, rode the waves, their icy flames carving a path upstream.  Wherever they passed, the river collapsed, the dissipating white mist resembling a bursting dam.</p><p>The scene was reminiscent of a legendary dragon traversing the waters!</p><p>The dream jade bottle continued to tilt, relentlessly pouring its contents into the river, resisting the dragons and their icy flames.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's eyelids fluttered even faster.</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed by Dingxiang Hou's power.  She couldn't help but be surprised: not only did he surpass her in the Way of Buddha-images, but he could casually produce two magical treasures – who knows what other tricks he had up his sleeve.</p><p>"Luckily, dream-conjured items are ultimately inferior to real treasures.  The four-headed dragon seal isn't perfectly attuned to me, and even though my cultivation is lower than this monster’s, I can still hold my own…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, then sensed several gusts of wind approaching.  Her eyes flashed coldly as she flapped her phoenix wings and unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p>The next moment, she appeared before a young tapir monster.</p><p>The young tapir, surprisingly lifelike, showed a human-like expression of surprise, desperately dodging.</p><p>The surrounding tapir monsters rushed to its aid.  With the formation's enhancement, they should have immediately shifted their formation to rescue the young tapir, but the resulting formation felt strangely awkward.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly stepped aside, placing himself directly on a pressure point in the formation, causing a momentary pause.  Before the formation could recover, Qin Sang moved, striking the nearest tapir demon with a palm strike, his hidden blade piercing its brain.</p><p>The tapir demon's eyes lost their light, turning into white mist as the others had.  With one demon eliminated, the formation crumbled. The remaining six were doomed.</p><p>However, they didn't give Qin Sang the chance to pick them off individually. The moment the formation broke, they retreated, forming a line before him.  With roars, their eyes blazing, the six tapir demons charged at each other, seemingly to kill one another. In a blink, they merged, along with a barely visible wisp of white mist.</p><p>Seven demons became one – a large, adult tapir demon!  Simultaneously, a larger, shadowy tapir demon appeared behind it, clearly Ding Xiang Hou's dharma image.  Whether he projected it into the dream or manifested its power within it, the image merged into the demon.</p><p>"Moo!"</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed as the demon vanished on the spot.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Two figures clashed and separated. Qin Sang stumbled back, his face grave. Ding Xiang Hou was far more formidable than anticipated. The dream-tapir, infused with the dharma image, possessed nearly the same strength as its original, truly deserving its title as the top demon marquis under Ling You Wang.</p><p>The tapir demon was sent flying back, appearing far more dishevelled than Qin Sang, though unharmed. It shook its trunk and relentlessly charged again.</p><p>The two engaged in a brutal melee, a life-or-death struggle between two Nascent Divinity cultivators that boiled down to raw power, a strangely primal battle.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang discerned a pattern: this tapir demon was essentially Ding Xiang Hou himself.  Manifesting this dream-tapir was no easy feat; destroying it might not harm Ding Xiang Hou directly, but likely prevent any more from appearing.  Yet, while he held the upper hand using heavenly power, he couldn't kill the demon quickly.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>Seizing an opening, Qin Sang pressed a palm to the tapir demon's chest, his fingers piercing its hide and tearing downwards.</p><p>The tapir demon roared, its foreleg smashing towards Qin Sang's head.  Anticipating this, Qin Sang blocked the blow with his arm, twisting his body and unleashing incredible force to flip the demon.  He then delivered a devastating blow to its abdomen.</p><p>The tapir demon, however, reacted with impossible contortions, its legs bracing against the attack at the last moment. Still, the impact reverberated through its body, sending it flying.</p><p>"Cough… cough…"</p><p>A heart-wrenching cough racked its body.  Its breathing grew ragged.  Just as it felt darkness closing in, Qin Sang pressed his attack.  The tapir demon lashed out with its trunk, shrouding itself in white mist and curling into a ball, seemingly trying to withstand the blow.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  His fist became a palm, pinning the demon.  Noticing Qin Sang's expression, Ding Xiang Hou's eyelids twitched; an inexplicable unease washed over him.</p><p>Sensing something, the dream-tapir was about to break free.</p><p>Suddenly, blinding golden light erupted!</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the tapir, stared at the dark clouds in the distance. Behind him, a golden sun slowly rose, illuminating everything.</p><p>The dark, hazy dream was suddenly bathed in golden light, dispelling the shadows.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal!</p><p>Since receiving this Buddhist seal, Qin Sang had been practicing with monks from Jingtai Temple. While not fully mastered, he could summon a golden sun.</p><p>His Qi and essence surged, flowing into the golden sun, merging within it.  This technique, based on the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, combined his essence and physical strength, unleashing unimaginable power.</p><p>The golden sun hung in the sky, its light growing more intense.  Qin Sang stood beneath it, resembling a Buddha with a halo, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>The snow-white tapir was bathed in gold, as was everything else, including the dark cloud concealing Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>Ding Xiang Hou trembled in his sleep, his face showing shock. His eyes squeezed shut, seemingly struggling to stay awake.  The dream landscape shifted: mountains, rivers, lava deserts, night skies, even a sun battling the golden sun.</p><p>All to no avail!</p><p>The golden light, with its power to melt all things, swept through the dream.  The dream's landscape, like ice and snow under a scorching sun, melted away. The dark cloud itself began to dissipate.</p><p>At that same moment, Yun You Sword and the Spirit Treasure Jade Pot, battling nearby, underwent a transformation.  Seizing an opportunity, the sword pierced the smoke, rushing towards the jade pot. Its blade suddenly turned crimson.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A beam of blood-red light shot from the sword, striking the jade pot.  Then, the sword tip turned, pointing directly at Ding Xiang Hou!</p><p>(End)</p>
