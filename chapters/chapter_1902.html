<h1>Chapter 1893: A Risky Gambit</h1><p>The demonic intent descended!</p><p>Qin Sang's body was already under the control of the shadowy figure; he was unable to move.  Inviting the celestial demon—a risky gamble, a desperate attempt to use one enemy against another—was fraught with peril. It could easily prove to be self-immolation.</p><p>One celestial demon, one Yang Shen—two incredibly powerful and unpredictable beings coexisting within him.  Qin Sang wasn't sure he could survive this ordeal, but he had no choice but to fight for his life!  The jade Buddha's performance against the Lei Zu's power had given him some confidence.</p><p>The reality, however, was far more severe than he'd anticipated.  This was no longer simply demonic intent; it was more akin to a demonic thoughtform, or even a fragment of a celestial demon's soul! The demonic intent he'd initially summoned was insignificant compared to this.</p><p>Faced with such terrifying demonic power, most cultivators would have lost their minds, falling into an endless hellscape of mental illusions. Fortunately, Qin Sang remained conscious.  Realizing the danger, he immediately dismissed the altar, ending the summoning ritual to sever the connection.</p><p>He sensed an incredibly wicked and dangerous presence looming, something far more terrifying than his current enemy. If he truly summoned the celestial demon's main body, his enemy might die, but he certainly wouldn't survive.</p><p>The shadowy figure's actions proved that even the jade Buddha had limitations against top-tier cultivators!</p><p>Had his action been effective?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know. He dared not release any spiritual sense to perceive the outside world.</p><p>Few, if any, could have endured a celestial demon's intrusion while remaining conscious and analyzing the changes caused by the demonic intent as Qin Sang had.  However, it was an experience he wouldn't want to repeat.</p><p>A chilling coldness enveloped him, his blood seeming to freeze, losing all feeling.  A strange aura hovered just outside the jade Buddha's protective light, unable to penetrate it.</p><p>Some rejoiced, some despaired.  The moment the ritual concluded, both the shadowy figure and Qin Sang sensed the celestial demon's presence.  The shadowy figure was all too familiar with this aura.  He never imagined that Qin Sang, not a celestial demon devotee, could summon one, and one far from ordinary!</p><p>In his prime, he might have resisted the demonic invasion.  But now, he was exceptionally weak.  Before infiltrating the Divine Court, he'd already suffered severe injuries, abandoning his original body.  Forced into the Divine Court, he'd endured unimaginable pressure traversing its barriers. The one who had forcibly sent him in lacked the power to protect him any further. The passage created by the palm strike held dangers far greater than a void storm, adding insult to injury.</p><p>Having entered the Divine Court, desperate to seize the Emperor's Sword and its secrets before anyone else reacted, the shadowy figure had no time to recover or adjust.  He'd seized Qin Sang while still grievously wounded.</p><p>The celestial demon was insidious. The Yang Shen's severe injuries and eagerness for success had created a vulnerability in his mind, providing the perfect opening for the demon.</p><p>Within the Purple Mansion…</p><p>The shadowy figure stood motionless before Qin Sang's primordial spirit, his expression shifting from shock to hatred, then to ecstatic joy, pain, happiness…  a thousand emotions in a single moment.  It was as if he had lived a thousand lifetimes in an instant.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the shadowy figure, too, possessed remarkable resilience. A look of agonizing struggle flashed in his eyes. He let out a silent roar, fighting for clarity amidst the turmoil. His face contorted in agony as he retreated desperately.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were wide, his expression rigid, like a corpse unwilling to close its eyes.  Suddenly, his face was covered in blood.</p><p>Thick veins of blood erupted from his eyebrows and pupils, and a distorted figure became faintly visible.</p><p>The shadowy figure had entered Qin Sang's body; now, it was emerging.  However, as the bloody light left his body, a chilling demonic intent clung to it like a parasitic growth.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>A scream echoed through the Divine Court.  Even after escaping Qin Sang's Purple Mansion, the shadowy figure couldn't shake off the celestial demon's intent!</p><p>The scream was excruciating and utterly strange, a single sound containing countless emotions and an inescapable terror…</p><p>The immortal clouds trembled.  The scream pierced the ears.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke to find he had regained control of his body. The chilling cold receded like a tide.  His eyes flickered, and he saw a horrifying sight: a mass of blood, floating before him, writhing and shapeless, utterly inhuman.</p><p>The scream emanated from the ‘blood,’ confirming it to be the shadowy figure that had attacked him.</p><p>However, the plasma contained the aura of a celestial demon!</p><p>“The celestial demon’s intent couldn’t break through the Buddhist light barrier, so it changed targets, locked onto the figure, and pursued it out?”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t sure of the specifics, only able to guess.</p><p>“If the figure is so weak, is it merely a celestial demon’s intent, or is the demon itself trying to corrupt it?  If the celestial demon is using the figure as an avatar to descend, what should I do?”</p><p>He might have attracted something even more formidable, adding fuel to an already chaotic situation.  When the crisis hit, Qin Sang couldn't think much; now, he felt a chilling aftereffect.</p><p>However, regardless, this was the best possible outcome he’d anticipated!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang’s heart suddenly leaped, a strong sense of unease washing over him.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively retreated, his vision instantly filled with a bloody light.</p><p>The blood plasma transformed into a distorted human-like outline, its body composed of countless blood threads.</p><p>At the core of the threads, a single point of blood light shone, strikingly unique.</p><p>This blood light was exceptionally pure, sharply contrasting with the chaotic blood light emanating from the figure.</p><p>With the appearance of this blood light, the figure became even more twisted.</p><p>The blood light seemed to possess an absorptive ability; the blood threads within the figure frantically converged towards it, then were absorbed.</p><p>The figure, which had been able to maintain a humanoid outline, quickly reverted to a mass of blood plasma.</p><p>The blood light grew brighter and more dazzling, eventually transforming into a blood-red crystal the size of a fingernail.</p><p>The blood crystal was pure and flawless, drawing the eye.</p><p>This object was the source of Qin Sang’s unease.</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face changed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The blood crystal shattered, fragments scattering and transforming into balls of bloodfire, filling the sky and earth.</p><p>In an instant, the blood crystal turned its surroundings into a sea of bloodfire. The raging inferno painted the Divine Court a monstrous crimson.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Bloodfire surged skyward.</p><p>Endless bloodfire erupted.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted quickly enough to narrowly escape the bloodfire’s range. Even from the edge, he could feel a power that sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>The figure vanished within the bloodfire.</p><p>The celestial demon’s intent was similarly swallowed by the flames.</p><p>A faint, disgruntled roar seemed to emanate from the depths of the sea of blood.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Qin Sang gasped, his scalp tingling. He was thankful that such power hadn't erupted within him; otherwise, he would have been reduced to dust.</p><p>He stared intently at the heart of the bloodfire, noticing that the eruption lasted only an instant, and its dissipation was equally rapid.  The sea of fire quickly contracted inward.</p><p>“It seems…the celestial demon’s aura has disappeared?”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t sense the peculiar chilling intent. The figure was far stronger than he'd imagined.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt that the blood crystal wasn't the figure's own power. It was either a magical artifact, or there was something even more terrifying behind it.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the annihilation of the celestial demon’s intent wasn’t necessarily good news.</p><p>The best outcome would have been the mutual destruction of the figure and the celestial demon’s intent; otherwise, the crisis remained unresolved.</p><p>Alas, things rarely go as planned.</p><p>As the bloodfire subsided, the scene within gradually revealed itself—the mass of blood plasma was still churning!</p><p>“It’s not dead!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, nearly despairing.</p><p>In this situation, where could he possibly escape to?</p><p>Having lost his divine chariot, he couldn't escape the South Heavenly Gate in the short term, nor could he seek refuge in any of the divine halls.</p><p>Against the figure’s uncanny abilities, his lightning escape technique was useless.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang didn’t make any futile attempts. He continued to observe the blood plasma, soon noticing something unusual.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the plasma’s aura was much weaker than before; the blood crystal had severely depleted it.</p><p>Clearly, detonating the blood crystal and annihilating the celestial demon's intent had come at a steep price for the figure.</p><p>The plasma couldn’t reconstitute itself into a humanoid form.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang sensed an aura and intent that remained incredibly chaotic, bordering on madness.</p><p>“It’s a demonic illusion! The celestial demon’s intent triggered its inner demons, and it's still trapped within a demonic illusion!”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood.</p><p>“Opportunity!”</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hesitate. He raised his hand and pointed towards the sky, and thunder rolled, deafeningly loud.</p><p>He once again cast the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal.</p><p>Thunder techniques are effective against evil spirits, and might prove effective.</p><p>While the scale was far less than before, Qin Sang felt an unprecedented ease and smoothness.  This was one of the benefits of having the power of the Thunder God flow through him; Qin Sang’s understanding of the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal had vastly improved.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder transformed into a seal, its light illuminating the heavens.</p><p>A thunderbolt descended from the sky, striking the blood plasma.</p><p>The plasma was pierced by the thunder, emitting a shrill roar, but after twisting for a moment, it recombined, not destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  He hadn't expected the shadowy figure, even trapped within its own inner demons, to be so difficult to kill.  Worse, the heavenly thunder seemed to have backfired, the figure showing signs of breaking free from the illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with killing intent.  He had to act before the figure escaped; who knew what other sinister abilities it possessed?</p><p>With a whoosh, the Nine Netherworld Inferno left his body, transforming into a sea of black flames that enveloped the blood pool.  Simultaneously, sword intent filled the air as the Cloud Wanderer Sword formed a Seven Souls Killing Array, its sword light poised to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang braced himself, his body enveloped in Buddhist light, ready to unleash the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to unleash a furious onslaught of attacks, he was startled by another phenomenon.  A palm print!</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards it in alarm.</p><p>The void and the God Court barrier were repairing themselves.  The force behind the palm print was waning, the blood pool shrinking with time, smaller than before.  Yet the pulsations from within the pool grew increasingly violent.  The scene within was utterly sickening.</p><p>Upon seeing the source of the disturbance deep within the blood pool, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically once more.  There were two sources.</p><p>One was vaguely visible: a yellow aura surging towards the edge of the blood pool, creating a vortex.  Within this yellow aura, countless heads floated, constantly shifting, like ghostly smoke forged from countless souls, reminiscent of the legendary Yellow Springs.  Strangely, all the faces were identical. Yet each displayed a different emotion: laughter, tears, screams. As the aura surged, heads continually vanished, the yellow energy shrinking visibly, severely weakened.  Still, it showed no sign of stopping, the heads seemingly inexhaustible.</p><p>The other source was even more alarming.  A black mystical light, sharp as an arrow, also aimed towards the God Court. Within the light was a single figure, naked, with skin smooth as jade.  Their hands were clasped to their chest. Every so often, cracks would appear on their skin under immense pressure, like shattered porcelain.  At such moments, the figure would impassively insert their fingers into their body, tearing off the cracked skin like a snake shedding its old hide.  The discarded skin turned to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see clearly into the blood pool, but he sensed both auras attempting to breach the God Court.  Judging from what he saw, neither showed any sign of weakening.  Their entry into the God Court was inevitable!</p><p>To traverse the blood pool and survive, their strength must rival that of the shadowy figure.  Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a chill.  One shadowy figure had already pushed him to his limits. How could he possibly cope with two more?</p><p>Should he summon another celestial demon? Even if he killed the shadowy figure, he himself would likely still perish.  The situation was utterly hopeless.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around in despair.  Rolling clouds and misty peaks of the immortal mountains were partially visible.  There was no sign of the Daoist Court Sovereign or Tian Yue. No reinforcements whatsoever.  In this vast God Court, everyone except him was an enemy, and those enemies were overwhelmingly powerful, their strength utterly despairing.</p><p>He looked up at the sky, where layers of celestial clouds blocked his path to the Lei Zu Temple.  He longed for that unbelievably powerful force once again.  Maybe he should just die with the shadowy figure, taking at least one down with him!</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes hardened, yet a firm belief counteracted his negative thoughts.  He couldn't give up!  He was striving for immortality, his pursuit of the Dao. Even if he dragged his enemies down with him, what good would it do?</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and stopped attacking. The heavenly thunder seal vanished, the lightning dissipating. The Nine Netherworld Inferno paused momentarily, then swiftly retreated, merging into Qin Sang's brow. His blood calmed. A golden sun's outline appeared behind him, then faded.</p><p>Only the Cloud Wanderer Sword remained, though the Seven Souls Killing Array was replaced with a Seven Mansions Stellar Array.  In an instant, darkness and stars enveloped the area. The blood pool was drawn into the array, resembling a beating heart, the shadowy figure still lost in its inner demons.</p><p>Qin Sang was running out of time. He had only time to evoke the Western White Tiger's Seven Mansions, temporarily trapping the figure within the array.</p><p>With a whoosh, Qin Sang turned his attention to the side.  Two charred corpses floated in the clouds – the remains of the Azure-scaled Serpent and the Black Roc.  Too close to Qin Sang, they had been charred beyond recognition by the residual force of the Lei Zu Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>He raised his hand, pointed at one of the corpses, and used his hand to pull at it remotely.  The corpse's head split open, and a demon pill flew out.</p><p>With a whoosh, Qin Sang caught it.</p><p>The pill was multicolored, vibrant and exquisitely beautiful.  Yet it contained a deadly poison!  This was the demon pill of a Nascent Soul stage demon king.  For anyone else, merely smelling it would cause dizziness.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, steeled his resolve, and swallowed it down.</p>
