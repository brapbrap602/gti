<h1>Chapter 1661: Taking Turns</h1><p>Ultimately, they determined that only the High Priest and Venerable Fang could enter the Venomous Lake.  The others remained outside.</p><p>The High Priest and Venerable Fang took turns employing their methods to ward off the venom, searching extensively within the lake.</p><p>Suddenly, the High Priest's expression shifted slightly. He rushed directly to the lake bottom, finding an ancient stone platform!</p><p>As his palm touched the platform, a burning sensation surged through his arm, and divine runes flickered faintly.</p><p>“Ancient Divine Restrictions!”</p><p>The High Priest gasped.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the Spiritlock Domain.</p><p>Among the mountains, within a stone forest on one peak, two figures, one standing, one sitting, remained silent.  They were the East Zenith Alliance Leader and Su Nü.</p><p>Su Nü's eyes darted about, filled with intense fear. She was immobilized, unable to move.</p><p>After being forced by the East Zenith Alliance Leader to consume the Soul Cleansing Solution and a spirit pill, she was brought into the secluded valley, where they had remained for a long time, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Su Nü was in utter despair.</p><p>Venerable Ye hadn't acted against her during the Trial Realm, and she thought she was safe.  She hadn't expected her true ordeal to come later.</p><p>Her premonition was correct. The East Zenith Alliance had cultivated her for another purpose, but the East Zenith Alliance Leader was one of the most powerful figures in the world, leaving her with no chance of resistance.</p><p>*Swoosh! Swoosh!*</p><p>With a rush of wind, two figures arrived one after the other. They were the West Gloom Alliance Leader and the North Star Alliance Leader.</p><p>Seeing these two, Su Nü's fear and despair intensified.</p><p>The East Zenith Alliance Leader rose to greet them, eagerly asking, “Have you two fellow Daoists been successful?”</p><p>The other two Alliance Leaders had gone to break the seals on the other two main altars.  Although not as complicated as the one within the Trial Realm, they were more dangerous.</p><p>Both were located deep within the inner halls, areas rife with spatial rifts and inaccessible to human cultivators.</p><p>The two Alliance Leaders appeared slightly pale, evidently having suffered some internal injuries, though the effects seemed minor.</p><p>“We have fulfilled our mission!”</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader smiled faintly, then countered with a question, “Judging by Fellow Daoist Bai Li’s expression, you have succeeded as well?  We owe it to your brilliant idea to come up with this method.”</p><p>“We must also thank Fellow Daoist Ye.”</p><p>The East Zenith Alliance Leader spoke humbly, “For the sake of our immortal paths, naturally, we must do our utmost.”</p><p>“I’m just afraid you’ve been *too* devoted!”</p><p>The West Gloom Alliance Leader, named Qing Yun, snorted coldly.  Her gaze shifted to Su Nü, her expression unkind, her tone mocking, “Five Yin Mystic Physique. You actually found one! Taking my disciple with the Yin Meridian physique up there would have been better than her!”</p><p>“If we could take them both, it would naturally be best, but the three of us, in activating the secret technique, can only barely protect one to ascend Mount Reaching Heaven. Fellow Daoist Qing Yun needn't worry, the three of us have already agreed to share the gains and losses equally.  Regardless of who we bring, it is the achievement of all three of us.  Moreover, that old fiend isn't a fool.  If we can't find the best Nine Revolutions Yin Body to serve as his vessel, we can't deceive him with a simple Yin Meridian physique.  Otherwise, he'll think we haven't been diligent, and that would be disastrous.  The Five Yin Mystic Physique is just right…”</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader looked Su Nü over, a hint of regret in his voice, “It's a pity she's only at the Core Formation stage.”</p><p>Su Nü had consumed the丹药 and Soul Cleansing Solution, her cultivation soaring, but ultimately failed to break through to Nascent Soul.</p><p>“Her cultivation time is too short, her foundation insufficient.  Forcing a breakthrough with pills and the Soul Cleansing Solution results in an unstable foundation. The ancient demonic cultivation techniques are equally arduous at this stage. The chances of Nascent Soul breakthrough are already slim, so failure is normal.  Peak Core Formation barely meets the requirements and shouldn't anger the old fiend…”</p><p>The East Zenith Alliance Leader explained.</p><p>The three discussed such terrifying matters right in front of Su Nü.</p><p>“What, you really intend to give the old fiend a Nascent Soul stage body?”</p><p>The West Gloom Alliance Leader’s expression was impatient, “Less nonsense, quickly release the restrictions on her. I need to plant my safeguards.”</p><p>The East Zenith Alliance Leader didn't take offense, raising a hand and withdrawing the restrictive force on Su Nü.</p><p>Su Nü turned to flee, but before her foot could land, she was frozen in place.</p><p>“Quite bold!”</p><p>The West Gloom Alliance Leader snorted coldly, reaching out and grabbing Su Nü, pulling her back.</p><p>Then, the West Gloom Alliance Leader flicked her fingers repeatedly.  Runes formed the shape of a talisman in the air, slowly descending towards Su Nü’s forehead, only to be stopped by the North Star Alliance Leader.</p><p>“No! The forehead is too conspicuous. It might be detected by the old fiend!”</p><p>The West Gloom Alliance Leader glanced at the North Star Alliance Leader, her brows furrowed slightly.  After a moment of thought, she shrunk the talisman and finally embedded it into Su Nü’s left wrist, where it vanished from sight.</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader and the East Zenith Alliance Leader also took turns employing their methods.</p><p>The East Zenith Alliance Leader left an illusory sword shadow hidden in her other arm, while the North Star Alliance Leader placed a ring-shaped restriction around Su Nü’s waist.</p><p>After carefully inspecting her once more, the three were finally satisfied.</p><p>Su Nü was utterly helpless, forced to watch as her own body was treated like a pawn, manipulated at their whim.  Despite the restrictions entering her body, she felt nothing, but she knew this certainly wasn't a good thing!</p><p>Having placed their safeguards, the three Alliance Leaders flickered, positioning themselves around Su Nü.  True Essence surged from their palms, runes appearing and disappearing, finally coalescing into a transparent protective sphere, enveloping Su Nü.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>The three, along with Su Nü, flashed towards Mount Reaching Heaven.</p><p>Upon entering the Spiritlock Domain, a powerful pressure descended, causing the protective sphere to creak and distort. The three continued to infuse True Essence, eventually stabilizing it.</p><p>Su Nü remained unharmed.</p><p>They then proceeded directly towards Mount Reaching Heaven.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side of the Spiritlock Domain.</p><p>Within a cave sat several figures, all in meditative states, as still as corpses, without a sound.</p><p>One of them was unexpectedly the Demonic Monarch!</p><p>Just then, the Demonic Monarch suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within.  He rose to his feet, “They’ve finally arrived! Fellow Daoist Mou, it’s time for us to move.”</p><p>A black shadow stirred at the edge of the cave, accompanied by a strange laugh, “After waiting for so long, I thought your plan was going to fall through.”</p><p>“This Monarch has been preparing for so long, how could I return empty-handed? I was merely waiting for a few more players to enter the scene…”</p><p>The Demonic Monarch turned to the others, “Fellow Daoists, please wait on the periphery.  If there are any unforeseen circumstances, I will lure the opponents down the mountain. Be ready to activate the Five Elements Reversal Slaughter Formation at any time.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The Demonic Monarch and Old Fiend Mou exited the cave, concealing their auras as they stealthily approached Mount Reaching Heaven.</p><p>“This time, I will need your full assistance, Fellow Daoist Mou.”</p><p>The Demonic Monarch transmitted his voice.</p><p>Old Fiend Mou replied coldly, “I am now a fugitive, my foundation severely injured by you and that old bull-nose.  I've spent all my resources to recover to eighty or ninety percent. If this injury isn't healed, forget about breakthroughs, even maintaining my current cultivation will be difficult.  I still have to rely on you for healing, so how dare I disobey?”</p><p>The Demonic Monarch smiled faintly, “Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, after this matter is concluded, I will take full responsibility for your grievances.  Spirit Master won't trouble you, and I will assist you with all my might in breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage.”</p><p>“And that brat from the瓊宇 Trading Company, I don't care if you have to search high and low, you must find him for me!”</p><p>Old Fiend Mou gritted his teeth.</p><p>He had fallen to this state all because of his search for Qin Sang. What enraged him even more was that after paying such a heavy price, he still didn't even know what the fellow looked like.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch's expression was strange, “He's probably hiding in fear after being scared off by you. As long as he’s still alive, he can’t hide forever. I will mobilize all the power of the Demonic Path to find him.  I want to see what kind of person can force a renowned Demonic Path giant to such a state.”</p>
