<h1></h1><p>Having departed from Nine Precepts Island, he made a detour to Ghost Mother's cave dwelling.</p><p>Tan Hao was in the midst of secluded cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the place where the roots of the Myriad Spirits Fruit Tree were being nurtured. Carefully probing with his divine sense, he could clearly perceive its vitality.</p><p>There was a high probability that the Myriad Spirits Fruit Tree could be revived, but it was unknown how long it would take to grow and bear fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully dug up the tree roots, using a restriction to prevent the spiritual energy from dissipating, preparing to bring them back to the Northern Reaches Realm.</p><p>The mountain gate in the Northern Reaches Realm was, under no circumstances, to be abandoned.</p><p>In the event that Green Goat Temple could no longer maintain a foothold in the Northern Sea in the future, there would at least be a way out.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang dug up the roots, the door creaked open, and Tan Hao emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang looked him up and down, cupped his hands, and said with a smile, "Congratulations, Brother Tan!"</p><p>The aura within Tan Hao's body was exceptionally stable, like the water of a deep pool, without any ripples.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang could see that within Tan Hao's body, there was actually an undercurrent surging, a certain momentum was building.</p><p>When it was full, it would overflow, and that would be the time to break through to the Nascent Soul Stage!</p><p>It was estimated that it wouldn't be too long!</p><p>Tan Hao smiled slightly: "I also didn't expect it to go so smoothly. The effect of the Morning Bell and Evening Drum was better than expected, otherwise, I'm afraid I would have needed at least ten more years of secluded cultivation!"</p><p>"This is a secret of the Pure Sea Sect, it is Brother Tan's fortuitous encounter..."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke of the origin and secrets of the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Tan Hao said in surprise: "Brother Qin, these days, I seem to have missed many major events?"</p><p>He had been wholeheartedly in seclusion, paying no attention to worldly affairs, and had no idea that the Boundless Sea had undergone a complete transformation. He was completely unaware of Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly and said with a smile, "No major event is as important as Brother Tan's breakthrough. I will personally stand guard for Brother Tan. During this time, I need to find a residence for Green Goat Temple, and then you and your son can be reunited."</p><p>"Hong, Yi'en..."</p><p>Thinking of his closest relatives, Tan Hao was lost in thought.</p><p>Reviving Tan Jie was his previous obsession, for which he had neglected many things, and endured the pain of separation from his own flesh and blood.</p><p>Now Tan Jie was dead, Shi Hong had aged prematurely, and fortunately, Tan Yi'en had met Qin Sang.</p><p>There was still one of his closest relatives alive.</p><p>"Brother Qin intends to relocate Green Goat Temple here?"</p><p>Tan Hao was lost in thought for a while before he realized the key to the problem.</p><p>"Brother Tan doesn't know yet, the Boundless Sea is no longer the Boundless Sea it used to be..."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a brief explanation.</p><p>Tan Hao's mouth fell open in disbelief. He had only been in seclusion for a little over ten years, and he no longer recognized the outside world. It was like a lifetime had passed!</p><p>Although Qin Sang's words were always understated, Tan Hao could tell that Qin Sang seemed to have played an important role in this upheaval.</p><p>Having been shocked by this fellow disciple time and time again, Tan Hao was already numb, and unexpectedly accepted this fact easily.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Tan Hao hesitated for a moment and said, "Brother Qin, if I am fortunate enough to break through successfully, may I ask for a place to settle down in Green Goat Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed to hear this, and feigned reproach, saying, "Why is Brother Tan being so formal? We were fellow disciples before, and the Demonic Flame lineage of Green Goat Temple were disciples deceived by Daoist Jiupao. Speaking of which, you are still their elder. Moreover, Yi'en now manages all affairs of Green Goat Temple. These connections, Brother Tan, you can't cut them even if you wanted to!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded: "I was able to establish my Foundation Establishment thanks to the pills given by Brother Qin and Senior Cloud Wanderer, otherwise, how could I be where I am today? After returning, I must go to Green Goat Temple to pay respects to the senior."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, and then spoke of his plans to find the ancient path and to travel to the Central Province.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed, "Brother Qin's ambitions lie in all directions. It's a pity that I cannot follow Brother Qin's footsteps. I have received your kindness many times, and there is never enough time to repay it before we part again. The sky is high and the waters are long, I can only wish Brother Qin success in the Great Dao in the future! Rest assured, after you leave, I will help you take good care of Green Goat Temple."</p><p>"With Brother Tan's words, I am relieved!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded.</p><p>Bidding farewell to Tan Hao, Qin Sang began to search everywhere according to his original plan.</p><p>Traveling and stopping, the several islands he passed by were not very satisfactory.</p><p>It was not because the islands were occupied.</p><p>Qin Sang did not deliberately conceal his whereabouts, and when he visited fellow cultivators along the way, he was invariably greeted with courtesy.</p><p>Various forces took turns to show off, and there were even some hidden sects, which gave Qin Sang a lot of insight.</p><p>Most of the islands were newly occupied by them, and giving them up would not be a loss. They were very happy to form a good relationship with Qin Sang and Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>It was not terrible for a person to be strong, what was terrible was that he also had the backing of the number one sect in the Northern Sea!</p><p>To some extent, Qin Sang and Profound Heaven Palace had achieved mutual success.</p><p>It was just a pity that Qin Sang's requirements were too high. These islands either lacked sufficient spiritual energy, were too remote, or there were too few islands nearby, lacking strategic depth.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang still chose one of the four islands he had initially selected, Yellow Heaven Island.</p><p>Yellow Heaven Island was located in the southeast of the Boundless Sea, but it maintained a certain distance from Profound Heaven Palace. It was originally the mountain gate of the Boundless Sea's demonic sect, Yellow Heaven Gate. Yellow Heaven Gate had three Nascent Soul cultivators, and held a pivotal position in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>It was only that Yellow Heaven Gate's luck was too bad, and two of the sect's Nascent Soul cultivators were suppressed by the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>At the time of the incident, the third person who stayed behind to guard the sect happened to be out. After receiving the news, he was shocked and hurried back, but disappeared halfway.</p><p>Yellow Heaven Gate acted in a perverse and ruthless manner, making countless enemies. No one knew which force had struck ruthlessly, and no one cared.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived at Yellow Heaven Island, Yellow Heaven Gate was leaderless, the tree had fallen and the monkeys had scattered. Outsiders took advantage of the situation, and the sect was tragically divided. The chaos on Yellow Heaven Island had not yet subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared, suppressed the situation, and after friendly negotiations, all parties returned fully loaded, and Qin Sang obtained Yellow Heaven Island.</p><p>There were thousands of islands, large and small, around Yellow Heaven Island, enough for Green Goat Temple to develop. Qin Sang renamed it the Emerald Bright Archipelago, and Yellow Heaven Island was renamed Green Goat Island.</p><p>He planned to only control some of the core islands, and not prohibit other cultivators from cultivating nearby.</p><p>"Senior, this will be a new beginning!"</p><p>Qin Sang erected a jade stele engraved with the character 'Qin' on Green Goat Island, patted it lightly, summoned the Cloud Wanderer Sword, and said softly.</p><p>Then, he deployed a set of formations he had obtained from Heavenly Mountain, and got busy again, refining formation implements and setting up the island-protecting grand formation!</p><p>When the spirit formation was completed, the date agreed upon with Tan Hao was also approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed off Green Goat Island and returned to Ghost Mother's cave dwelling. After waiting for another two months, Tan Hao finally began to break through the bottleneck!</p><p>To overcome the Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Sang brought Tan Hao back to Green Goat Island.</p><p>Tan Hao stayed on the island alone, activating the grand formation, while Qin Sang guarded him outside.</p><p>At first, it was an anxious wait.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang sensed the aura of the Heavenly Tribulation, which indicated that Tan Hao had successfully formed his Nascent Soul!</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation followed closely, and the sky above Green Goat Island changed suddenly, with dark clouds gathering and thunder rumbling.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the tribulation clouds. Tan Hao's tribulation process seemed to be going quite smoothly, and he couldn't help but nod secretly.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly focused, and he took out an object. It was the Yang Puppet Crystal that Earl Dongyang had given him before his death.</p><p>The puppet crystal flickered slightly, the amplitude was weak, but this induction was real!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang looked up at Green Goat Island, waved his hand to send out the Python Flag and the captured Snow Python, and ordered the Snow Python to guard Tan Hao.</p><p>His own figure flashed repeatedly, moving at lightning speed, and in the blink of an eye, he flew over an island on the periphery of the Emerald Bright Archipelago.</p><p>This island was among the top three in size in the Emerald Bright Archipelago, and there were countless mortals on the island, who were formerly the blood sacrifices raised by Yellow Heaven Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang had a clear target, heading straight for one of the cities, his gaze firmly fixed on a young man in front of the city gate.</p><p>At the same time, the young man raised his head and happened to meet Qin Sang's gaze.</p><p>The next moment, his body suddenly exploded, flesh and blood flew everywhere, and the remains instantly covered the ground. The people around him were unfortunately implicated, resulting in countless deaths and injuries.</p><p>A foul-smelling bloodstain rushed towards Qin Sang, sickening.</p><p>A black light flew out from the flesh and blood, shooting towards another direction.</p><p>Inside the black light was actually a palm-sized figure, but it was clearly not a Nascent Soul. Its facial features were quite similar to General Gui's.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this was the puppet that General Gui had taken refuge in.</p><p>Back at the Exquisite Pagoda, General Gui saw that there was no hope of escape, and was forced to use his life-saving神通(divine ability), burning himself, and merging his soul with the puppet.</p><p>He obtained the puppet crystal from Earl Dongyang, partly by force and partly by exchange. After refining it, the puppet's divine ability greatly increased.</p><p>With the puppet's characteristic of being a dead object, he actually managed to deceive the heavens and escape.</p><p>But this divine ability was a double-edged sword. Once merged, he could not separate from the puppet, and his temperament would be affected by the puppet. As time went on, it would become increasingly difficult to control his emotions, and his cultivation would likely not improve further.</p><p>General Gui hated Qin Sang, the culprit, to the core. He secretly joined forces with the demons and devils who had escaped from the holy land, wanting to gradually form a revenge alliance.</p><p>Unfortunately, these demons and devils did not suffer such great losses as he did. They all agreed on the surface, but in their hearts, they did not want to provoke Qin Sang again.</p><p>Of course, if General Gui could really find an opportunity, they would not refuse.</p><p>Feeling the perfunctory attitude of the other demons and devils, General Gui was secretly angry. Not long ago, he learned that Qin Sang had appeared in the Boundless Sea, and the flames of revenge drove him to follow the trail.</p><p>He still remembered that in front of the Exquisite Pagoda, Qin Sang had seen through the puppet's whereabouts. Therefore, he carefully maintained a distance, always controlling low-level cultivators to spy, intending to see what tricks Qin Sang was up to.</p><p>Just now, when Tan Hao was undergoing the tribulation, General Gui sensed the tribulation lightning and couldn't resist. He self-sealed, and the puppet body hid among low-level cultivators, trying to get closer.</p><p>As long as he didn't make a move, the puppet was a dead object and presumably wouldn't be exposed. However, he didn't expect to be locked onto by Qin Sang before even approaching Green Goat Island.</p><p>At this moment, General Gui finally understood that Qin Sang had seen through his whereabouts not by relying on keen spiritual sense, but for another reason. But it was too late, and he was filled with shock and anger.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. He had not deliberately concealed his whereabouts, partly with the intention of luring the snake out of its hole. He didn't expect to catch a big fish.</p><p>Profound Heaven Palace focused on taking care of the demon race, but not only did Old Demon Hun escape with his soul, but General Gui had also escaped.</p><p>Seeing his state, he was probably not quite right, clearly taking refuge in the puppet's body.</p><p>The puppet's body swelled rapidly during its flight, and in the blink of an eye, it became the size of an adult.</p><p>Its facial features were vivid, the expression on its face was lifelike, and its flesh was no different from that of an ordinary person. It was hard to imagine that this was actually a puppet.</p><p>Encountering his enemy, General Gui's eyes were filled with raging fire, unable to suppress the anger in his heart, but there was also fear and regret.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The puppet's escape technique was truly extraordinary, breaking through the void like a meteor.</p><p>He was affected by hatred, but he did not completely lose his reason. He had set up a backup plan at his hiding place. As long as he escaped to his hiding place, there was hope of getting rid of Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing the target in sight, General Gui's eyes showed deep joy.</p><p>At this moment, a cold snort suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p>"Humph! Ha!"</p><p>General Gui felt as if his primordial spirit had been hit by a heavy hammer. A sharp pain struck, his body trembled, and his face was full of pain.</p><p>It was precisely the *Soul-Seizing True Incantation* that Qin Sang had used.</p><p>After obtaining this secret technique, he pondered it constantly. Because of the Soul-Nourishing Wood, his speed in cultivating soul secret techniques was faster than others, and it didn't take long for him to master this secret technique.</p><p>Having cultivated for a short time, Qin Sang was still unable to modify the secret technique like Yin Changsheng. He honestly uttered the true incantation of 'Humph Ha', and felt a little strange every time he used it.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated that General Gui was taking refuge in the puppet, and without the support of a physical body, he used the *Soul-Seizing True Incantation*. As expected, it worked with one strike.</p><p>General Gui was also quite capable. His body trembled, but he forcibly suppressed the pain and focused on escaping.</p><p>But for Qin Sang, this little time was enough.</p><p>A bolt of lightning surpassed General Gui and blocked his path.</p><p>Qin Sang was not polite. A red light flashed in front of him, and he directly summoned the Sun Divine Tree.</p><p>General Gui was so frightened that his soul flew out of his body. He turned to flee, but found that his path was blocked by Qin Sang's incarnation.</p><p>The Sun Divine Tree was of course just a decoy.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the intention of capturing General Gui alive, shot out the Golden Sinking Sword, and the sword formation enveloped him from above!</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>General Gui clashed head-on with the incarnation.</p><p>All his treasures and his physical body were buried in the space of the stone stele. After coming out, he didn't dare to act too conspicuously, and he still didn't have a suitable magical treasure, so he could only use the puppet's own divine ability.</p><p>The puppet's flesh was as strong as iron and gold. He punched out with a heavy fist, runes flashed, and it turned into a bloodthirsty ghost face, with astonishing killing intent.</p><p>The incarnation was not to be outdone, changing hand seals and using divine abilities one after another, firmly blocking General Gui's retreat.</p><p>With one strike, General Gui failed to break through the blockade. Just as he was about to make another move, he felt darkness before his eyes and fell into the sword formation.</p><p>Once he was pulled into the sword formation, it was much easier to deal with him.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeves and summoned the demonic fire, slightly integrating it into the sword formation.</p><p>The sword formation trapped and killed, and the incarnation attacked from all sides.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang had left sword wounds and ice marks on the puppet's body. Although he had not injured the vital points, he could clearly feel that General Gui's aura was beginning to decline.</p><p>General Gui roared repeatedly, but he seemed powerless, strong on the outside but weak on the inside.</p><p>Qin Sang originally wanted to deal with General Gui like he had dealt with Hall Master Yin, wearing him down. When the time was right, he would make an all-out effort to capture him alive.</p><p>Unexpectedly, General Gui showed a cold smile, his eyes suddenly dimmed, but the aura in his body was rising rapidly, extremely violent.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He used the *Soul-Seizing True Incantation* and demonic fire together to forcibly interrupt the puppet's self-destruction, but he could not stop General Gui from seeking death.</p><p>In the last moment before his death, General Gui stared at Qin Sang, his hatred overwhelming, as if to say that he would never reveal the whereabouts of the other demons and devils.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, summoned the puppet into his hand, and found that this puppet was very special, following a completely different path from his senior sister. It was somewhat similar to a natal magical treasure.</p><p>After General Gui's death, even if it fell into the hands of outsiders, it could not be controlled.</p><p>Qin Sang searched around for a while, but did not find any other demons and devils. Amidst countless shocked gazes, he returned to Green Goat Island and examined the puppet carefully.</p><p>He wanted to take a step back and separate the Yin Puppet Crystal from the puppet's body, but found that the Yin Puppet Crystal had already merged with the puppet. He looked for a long time but had no clue, so he had to temporarily put it together with the Yang Puppet Crystal.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew out of Green Goat Island. It was Tan Hao, who had successfully overcome the tribulation!</p>
