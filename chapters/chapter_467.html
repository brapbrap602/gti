<h1>Chapter 460: A Comparison</h1><p>Qin Sang felt apprehensive as he spoke.</p><p>Fortunately, Granny Jing didn't get angry.</p><p>"This is indeed a problem for you."</p><p>Granny Jing pondered for a moment, then said to Qin Sang, "Follow me."</p><p>Before her voice faded,</p><p>Qin Sang felt his body tighten, enveloped by a spiritual force.  Before he could react, his vision blurred. After a brief, dizzying rush, he heard the sound of crashing waves.</p><p>It was nightfall. A faint, lingering glow remained where the water met the sky in the west.</p><p>A few stars twinkled above.</p><p>The moon was still faint.</p><p>Below him stretched a boundless expanse of water.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned his head. Behind him, an endless sea of fog stretched to the horizon.</p><p>How much time had passed?</p><p>They had left Qin Sang's cave and arrived outside the True Water Mirage Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was in a whirl. He hadn't seen anything, completely unaware of how Granny Jing had brought him through the formation without alerting anyone!</p><p>If everyone in the Heavenly Alliance was as powerful as Granny Jing, the Small Han Domain would have been crushed long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang was still shaken.</p><p>Granny Jing said calmly, "You want to know if I can conceal myself from Nascent Soul cultivators?  Seeing is believing."</p><p>Qin Sang swallowed involuntarily. "Where are you taking me, Senior?"</p><p>"You'll know when we get there."</p><p>Granny Jing said simply, taking out another wooden carving.</p><p>The carving was of a Qingluan, a mythical bird. Like the previous carving of the woman, it was incredibly lifelike, capturing the bird's essence, as if it would take flight at any moment.</p><p>Indeed, when Granny Jing extended a finger and gently touched the Qingluan carving, it came to life.</p><p>A clear, melodious cry rang out, and the Qingluan's wings suddenly began to flap. Sparkling motes of light scattered as its wings moved, creating a breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>The Qingluan chirped sweetly, showing great affection for Granny Jing, and then began to dance around her. As it danced, its body grew larger, rapidly transforming into a true divine bird, stretching its wings to their full extent.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen descriptions of the ancient divine bird Qingluan in ancient texts, and this was exactly like them!</p><p>Now, the Qingluan bore no resemblance to a wooden carving.</p><p>Puppetry?</p><p>Or some other magic?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened, stunned by Granny Jing's seemingly miraculous technique. Then, he felt a lightness beneath him as the Qingluan lowered itself to carry them both.</p><p>It spread its wings and soared into the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>At the gates of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Mist and clouds swirled.</p><p>He could vaguely see the familiar sight of his sect's verdant peaks.</p><p>The Qingluan soared across the vast Cloudsea, carrying them to the gates of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang turned to look at Granny Jing.</p><p>"I'll wait for you on Mount Shaohua."</p><p>Granny Jing looked at the Qingluan with a fond smile, beckoning it with her hand. The Qingluan let out a reluctant chirp, its body rapidly shrinking until it landed in Granny Jing's palm, once again becoming a wooden carving, exactly as it had been before.</p><p>Granny Jing nodded slightly at Qin Sang, then her figure faded, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>Her voice lingered.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly used a movement technique to stabilize himself, fully extending his divine sense, but he couldn't sense her at all. Granny Jing had completely disappeared.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He suddenly realized that the Mount Shaohua Granny Jing referred to wasn't the entire sect, but the main peak of Mount Shaohua itself.</p><p>The cave of the sect's Nascent Soul ancestor, Lord Dongyang, was located at the summit of Mount Shaohua!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood what "seeing is believing" meant.</p><p>He was intimidated.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered, then he made up his mind and flew towards the sect's gates on his Stygian Cloud.</p><p>"Who goes there..."</p><p>As he approached the sect's formation, patrolling disciples spotted him.</p><p>The sect's security had been tightened considerably.</p><p>The mist stirred, and one male and two female Qi Refining disciples emerged from the formation. Their gazes swept around, landing on Qin Sang. Their wary expressions relaxed, and they bowed in unison.  "So it's Elder Qin! We greet Elder Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang's reputation in the Cloudsea had reached the sect.</p><p>Many inexperienced disciples admired him greatly.</p><p>Qin Sang grunted in acknowledgment.  "I have an important matter to attend to. I'll be leaving shortly. Open the formation."</p><p>The three disciples exchanged glances, hesitating.  "Please forgive us, Elder Qin, but recently, the Sect Master decreed that anyone entering must present their identification token or a decree from the Sect Master..."</p><p>This order must have come from Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>It seemed the conflict between the Small Han Domain and the Heavenly Alliance wasn't over yet; the emergence of Skyward Peak was just a small interlude.</p><p>He wondered when it would all end.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, then took out his identification token and tossed it into the formation.</p><p>After verifying his token, the three disciples opened the formation.</p><p>Although anxious, Qin Sang maintained a calm demeanor. He first returned to his cave before heading towards Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Mount Shaohua was no longer forbidden to Foundation Establishment disciples. The sect's Golden Core cultivators sometimes held lectures there, and there were also training grounds for disciples to practice and discuss the Dao. It wasn't Qin Sang's first time there.</p><p>However, with the current unrest in the Small Han Domain, Foundation Establishment disciples had been dispatched to various locations, leaving the training grounds deserted.</p><p>How would she prove it?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, his light landing quietly on the celestial steps.</p><p>As Qin Sang reached the white jade archway, his expression changed slightly. Glancing to the side, he noticed a woman in flowing white robes standing beside a jade pillar.</p><p>She seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. Qin Sang hadn't missed a single spot, and just a moment ago, that area had been empty.</p><p>"Are you Granny Jing? Or..."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>He couldn't blame himself for not recognizing her.</p><p>This woman bore no resemblance to Granny Jing. Instead, she was identical to the wooden carving Granny Jing had given him.</p><p>The real person was even more captivating than the carving. Her hands were as white as snow, her black hair flowed like silk to her waist, and she wore a simple white robe without any ornaments. Her beauty was easily comparable to Fairy Chenyan's.</p><p>Her eyebrows were delicate, her eyes deep and serene, conveying aloofness and coolness.</p><p>She possessed the same ethereal, otherworldly aura.</p><p>Before, Fairy Chenyan had been the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, with no comparison.</p><p>Seeing this woman, Qin Sang couldn't help but compare the two, finding a significant difference in their temperaments.</p><p>He recalled his impression of Fairy Chenyan. A faint, lingering melancholy had clouded her brow, and her eyes held an unwavering determination, bordering on stubbornness.</p><p>That night, a hint of confusion Qin Sang couldn't understand had flickered in her eyes, bringing Fairy Chenyan down to earth from the heavens.</p><p>This woman, however, was a true moon goddess, untouched by the mortal world.</p><p>Her gaze was cool and indifferent, as if nothing in the mortal realm could stir her emotions.</p>
