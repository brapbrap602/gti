<h1>Chapter 1101: Reforging the Path</h1><p>---</p><p>"My focus from now on must remain on cultivation and forming the Nascent Soul," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Two jade slips lay before him. One recorded the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, while the other contained the second part of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. </p><p>There was no need to rush into comprehending the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*. Taking a deep breath, Qin Sang directed his divine sense into the second jade slip.</p><p>To this day, he still hadn’t uncovered the true name of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. Beneath the Nether Valley, he had obtained the latter five layers, which allowed cultivation from the mid-Golden Core stage to the late Nascent Soul stage. At the time, he had skimmed through it hastily, feeling both excitement and unease.</p><p>The excitement came from the fact that the subsequent techniques remained incredibly powerful. The sixth and seventh layers, as expected, contained two new Killing Talismans, vastly different from the ones created by Green Bamboo. These were more profound and grand in scale. Even a genius like Green Bamboo couldn’t escape the limitations of his own era and personal understanding. This cultivation method was the culmination of countless predecessors’ efforts, refined through endless trial and error, far beyond what a single individual could achieve.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he would have to abandon the Killing Talismans he had learned and start anew with the sixth layer. Fortunately, Green Bamboo’s creations were based on this very method, so the two types of Killing Talismans shared the same origin. Even if he had to start over, he could quickly regain his current level of cultivation. Reaching the peak of the Golden Core stage wouldn’t take too long. The true Killing Talismans would further enhance his cultivation speed.</p><p>Once he mastered all seven Killing Talismans, Qin Sang estimated that his cultivation speed would surpass that of dual-spiritual-root cultivators. Whether he could rival the true prodigies—those with heavenly spiritual roots—remained uncertain, given his inherently poor foundation. However, after forming his Nascent Soul, there would be no new Killing Talismans to acquire. The *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* only contained seven Killing Talismans! At that point, his cultivation speed would remain constant, having reached its limit.</p><p>This led to Qin Sang’s greatest concern. Before the Nascent Soul stage, as long as he could condense a new Killing Talisman, he could easily break through minor realms without encountering bottlenecks caused by cultivation. This advantage would vanish after forming his Nascent Soul. Every bottleneck would have to be overcome through his own efforts.</p><p>"Killing Talismans…" Qin Sang murmured softly.</p><p>The true purpose of the Killing Talismans would only reveal itself after forming the Nascent Soul, and it was closely tied to the new divine ability, the *Seven Souls Slaughtering Array*. During the Golden Core stage, the sword techniques would naturally split into sword rays from the Ebony Sword. In the early Golden Core stage, one ray would split off; in the mid-stage, two more would emerge; and in the late stage, four additional rays would form, totaling seven sword rays. Each of these rays carried a trace of soul energy—what Green Bamboo had referred to as sword souls!</p><p>If Qin Sang failed to form his Nascent Soul and had no further ambitions, he could use these seven sword souls to create seven external avatars. With seven late-Golden Core avatars, he could dominate anyone below the Nascent Soul stage. These seven sword souls were intricately linked to cultivation after forming the Nascent Soul. The method required the cultivator to project the Killing Talismans from their lifebound spirit sword onto the sword souls, then refine these seven sword souls into their own primordial spirit, gradually merging them with the seven souls!</p><p>This was why the technique was named the *Seven Souls Slaughtering Array*!</p><p>Reading this, Qin Sang couldn’t help but gasp. The three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls were profound and mysterious. While many cultivation methods in the immortal realm involved the soul, most were vague and general. This was the first time Qin Sang had encountered a method that clearly distinguished between the three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls and used them for cultivation. The *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* sought to merge the seven souls with sword rays and Killing Talismans—something unheard of. Was it aiming to refine the seven souls into sword souls?</p><p>"Nurturing the sword with the primordial spirit… or perhaps, forging the sword with the primordial spirit?" Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the method is incomplete. I don’t know where this path leads. Sword cultivators truly are madmen!"</p><p>Regardless, at least until he formed his Nascent Soul, there was no possibility of switching cultivation methods. After forming his Nascent Soul, he could focus on comprehending it further. Perhaps his current low cultivation level was skewing his understanding.</p><p>"With the sword spirit and the fragments of the Slaughtering Sword, it’s foreseeable that I’ll have the opportunity to gather the complete method and sword in the future. Abandoning it midway would be a great loss. Judging by the aura of the Purple Micro Palace and the Seven Slaughter Hall, they must have been top-tier forces in ancient times. Countless sword cultivators poured their hearts into creating this method—there must be a reason for it…"</p><p>Qin Sang set these doubts aside for now. He observed the sixth layer’s Killing Talisman in the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* and connected his mind to the Ebony Sword. Dispelling the Killing Talismans created by Green Bamboo would cause his cultivation to drop back to the early Golden Core stage. Although it wouldn’t be difficult to rebuild, it would still take some time.</p><p>The immediate priority was to return and retrieve the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, handle various trivial matters, and find a safe place to settle down. Then, he could go into seclusion and push through to the peak of the Golden Core stage in one go, preparing to form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang left the cave and continued southward.</p><p>"Xuangu Pass is under the control of Shaohua Mountain. I wonder if Dongyang Bo and Shaohua Mountain are still there. It’s been three months since the Purple Micro Palace emerged. The cultivators in the Seven Fortresses should have all come out to search for treasures. I’ll find someone to ask. If Xuangu Pass is still in Shaohua Mountain’s hands, I’ll have to enter through Yinshan Pass…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these thoughts as his figure swiftly darted southward. Unexpectedly, he didn’t encounter any other cultivators along the way.</p><p>"Have the cultivators of the Cold Domain stopped coming to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?" Qin Sang landed atop a desolate mountain peak and gazed southward. The spiritual tide was nearing its end, and Foundation Establishment cultivators should have been out searching for treasures by now, yet there was no sign of anyone. Even though the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was vast and sparsely populated, this situation was unusual.</p><p>This made him even more hesitant to enter the pass recklessly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly recalled something. Years ago, while cultivating in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he had been taken by Dongyang Bo’s disciple, Che Yutao, to explore an ancient cultivator’s ruin. It was there that he had been captured by the Crippled Elder, narrowly escaping death before turning the tables and killing him. From the Crippled Elder, he had obtained the art of insect control, the Crimson Fire Flowing Gold, and the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman. After being transported to the Witch God Continent, these treasures had played crucial roles in cultivating his lifebound insect gu and subduing the Fat Silkworm and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>In many ways, his current achievements were deeply tied to that experience. The incident had been triggered by the Crippled Elder’s desire for the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman of the Supreme Origin Pure Palace’s Daoist Xuanyu, which was said to aid in forming the Nascent Soul. However, after both the Crippled Elder and Daoist Xuanyu perished, Qin Sang had never found the talisman. Later, a disturbance had erupted deep within the ancient cultivator’s ruin, and the area around the mountains had become riddled with spatial cracks. Che Yutao and the others had been forced to retreat, and Qin Sang, only at the Foundation Establishment stage, had been unable to explore further. He had never had the chance to return.</p><p>"I wonder who controls the ancient cultivator’s ruin now. Perhaps I should take a look?" Qin Sang pondered for a moment before deciding to investigate on his way. He still remembered the location of the ruin’s entrance.</p><p>In truth, he knew the chances were slim. Even if the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman was still there—unharmed and untouched—it was uncertain whether it could truly aid in forming the Nascent Soul. Otherwise, why would the Supreme Origin Pure Palace struggle to produce Nascent Soul cultivators?</p><p>---</p><p>This chapter makes up for the two missed yesterday. Today’s update will be very late, so don’t stay up waiting. You can read it tomorrow.</p>
