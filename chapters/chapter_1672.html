<h1>Chapter 1663:  A Glimpse of the Elixir</h1><p>Chapter 1663:  A Glimpse of the Elixir</p><p>The two exchanged a glance, and the Poison King, understanding the situation, narrowed his eyes.</p><p>A violent wind swirled, forming a vortex.  The poisonous insects, like ethereal serpents, shifted direction with fluid movements.  Simultaneously, the wind darkened, and a black droplet condensed within it, instantly dispersing into a small cloud of black smoke. It grazed past Master Huaiyin and hurtled towards Kun Dao.</p><p>The smoke billowed, moving with astonishing speed, accompanied by a whistling sound.</p><p>Protected by the Poison King, Master Huaiyin was free to retreat swiftly from the battle.</p><p>Kun Dao opened her eyes at some point, fixing her gaze on Master Huaiyin's retreating figure.  Seeing that Master Huaiyin had received help, and that despite his labored breathing, he seemed perfectly fine—his wounds not only not worsening, but visibly healing with new flesh sprouting—Kun Dao stared intensely at him before closing her eyes again.</p><p>Su Zinan and Qin Sang cursed inwardly.</p><p>The smoke appeared to be aimed at Kun Dao, but who could guarantee the Poison King wouldn't have ulterior motives?  They were approaching Kun Dao, placing them within range of the attack.</p><p>The smoke had no unusual odor, seeming ordinary, but considering the Poison King's reputation, it was undoubtedly a potent poison.</p><p>Qin Sang, aided by his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, had some spare attention to observe. He noticed that the smoke originated from a particular insect within the wind vortex.  It was a long, slender insect covered in fine hairs—a caterpillar.</p><p>Such an appearance was too common. Qin Sang could instantly recall dozens of similar insects, but couldn't identify the species in such a short time.  Furthermore, the insects of Wan Du Mountain were notoriously modified by the art of raising and training poisonous insects, making identification even more difficult.</p><p>However, the insect's hairs evoked a sense of familiarity, similar to the hairs given to him by Wan Du Mountain, yet subtly different: finer, lacking the same luster.</p><p>According to the leader of the Seven Fragrant Pavilion, the hairs were taken from a sacred object of Wan Du Mountain, indicating a strong connection between the insect and this object.</p><p>The Faceless Man, poisoned by the sacred object, had been unable to cleanse the poison for hundreds of years, proving its potency. The Poison King's insect would surely be equally dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless.  He diverted a portion of his spiritual energy, activating the poison bead to create a protective layer around his body. With a flick of his wrist, three divine birds spread their wings, taking flight from the trunk, merging into one.</p><p>The breath of the Nan Ming Li Fire clashed with the Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic light and spiritual fire collided, then intertwined, forming towering flames around the Sun God Bird, creating a spectacular scene of breathtaking power.</p><p>Though Su Zinan appeared motionless, his robe billowed, revealing an additional layer of faint blood light.  He stared at Kun Dao, his lips moving as he muttered incantations.</p><p>As he chanted, the death mark on Kun Dao's chest glowed an even deeper crimson, sinking into her body, seemingly attempting to imprint itself onto her inner organs.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Su Zinan saw Kun Dao close her eyes, appearing to give up the struggle.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Sun God Bird blazed a trail of surging flames, its power awe-inspiring.</p><p>Just as Kun Dao was about to be engulfed in the flames, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He saw the cracks beside Kun Dao rapidly expanding, instantly transforming into a black hole with immense suction, pulling Kun Dao down!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The black hole was just the beginning. The Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism went haywire, releasing an astonishingly violent force that caused the void to collapse!</p><p>In an instant, magnetic light formed a storm, countless cracks spawning within it like giant serpents, rushing in every direction. Qin Sang and Su Zinan felt their bodies tense. When they recovered, they found themselves surrounded by the magnetic storm.</p><p>Kun Dao escaped from the Godly Restriction through self-destruction, triggering the violent outburst of the Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Kun Dao had many options within the Five Elements Godly Restriction; even trapped in a deadly situation, she found a way to escape. Knowing the situation was hopeless, Qin Sang withdrew his control of the Sun God Bird.</p><p>The Sun God Bird subsequently exploded, its spiritual flames shooting skyward, quickly swallowed by the chaotic magnetic storm.  The Poison King's poisonous smoke was also dispersed.</p><p>Su Zinan also felt the death mark slip from his control, and he ceased his incantations.</p><p>Qin Sang, at the heart of the magnetic storm, found himself surrounded by cracks. Though perilous, escaping was not impossible.  He decided to follow the flow, choosing a crack to break free from the Godly Restriction.</p>
