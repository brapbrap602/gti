<h1>Chapter 911: Dual Breakthrough</h1><p>While his avatar consolidated its cultivation, two days passed. Qin Sang opened his eyes slightly and looked at Qin Sang, who was sitting cross-legged in front of him. At this time, Qin Sang had already summoned his Corpse Pill, ready to refine it anew.</p><p>The "Seed Devil Fetus" technique allowed for the Corpse Pill to be refined and passed onto an avatar, saving a significant amount of time. This was a path even Senior Qingzhu hadn't trodden, and Qin Sang only had one chance. Failure could destroy the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Over the past two years, he had meticulously planned this countless times.</p><p>With each increase in his avatar's cultivation, Qin Sang gained new insights. After countless revisions, he felt there was little room for further improvement and decided to begin the process.</p><p>The Corpse Pill floated between the two of them, imbued with baleful and auspicious energy, displaying a bluish-black hue.</p><p>The avatar focused intently, circulating its cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang also performed the secret art from the "Seed Devil Fetus," forcing out his lifeblood, transforming it into streams of incantations that he infused into the Corpse Pill.</p><p>Although the Corpse Pill was an external elixir, it had been nurtured within Qin Sang's body for decades and was essentially a part of him. He hadn't found a way to improve it due to a lack of resources and focus, causing its progress to stagnate.</p><p>The "Seed Devil Fetus" was an opportunity; the refined Corpse Pill could break the bottleneck and advance further.</p><p>However, by using the Corpse Pill, the avatar's chances of achieving Nascent Soul would become almost zero. But that was a problem for the future. Even Qin Sang's own Nascent Soul breakthrough was a distant prospect, so he couldn't afford to worry about that now.</p><p>This step proceeded smoothly. The Corpse Pill was docile, absorbing Qin Sang's lifeblood and turning into a blood-red pill.</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled slightly due to the excessive loss of lifeblood.</p><p>Next, the avatar shouted, activating the secret art and rapidly sending out incantations that transformed into demonic light, falling onto the Corpse Pill and attempting to merge with it, subduing it.</p><p>The Corpse Pill immediately began to resist violently.  Spiritual energy fluctuated, and the once stable baleful and auspicious energy showed signs of instability.  Qin Sang, seemingly anticipating this, intervened and suppressed the turbulence.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the Corpse Pill, not daring to relax. This was the most crucial step. As long as the avatar could successfully complete the secret art, given the inherent connection between them, subduing the Corpse Pill wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The Corpse Pill continued to resist, but due to Qin Sang's intervention, the secret art finally infiltrated it.</p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p>The avatar opened its mouth wide, and the Corpse Pill, transformed into a streak of crimson light, shot into its body.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang appeared in front of the avatar, pressing his palm against its abdomen.  Spiritual energy surged into the avatar's core, helping it suppress the Corpse Pill.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang slowly withdrew his hand, deep in thought. "The first step was a success. Now, both the avatar and I need to use blood refinement and the secret techniques from 'Seed Devil Fetus' to gradually refine the baleful and auspicious energy within the Corpse Pill, transforming it into the avatar's own Demonic Core. This process will likely take several months. I can also begin preparations for breaking through to the third level of the 'Celestial Demon Refining Form'..."</p><p>The avatar sat motionless. Qin Sang glanced down and left the cave.</p><p>One year later.</p><p>An open area outside the cave, separated by a spirit array.</p><p>A flash of blood-red light appeared as two figures clashed and separated instantly. One figure stumbled back several steps, trembling before regaining its footing.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his hand, narrowing his eyes and suppressing the churning blood within him.  He thought with surprise, "The avatar's cultivation technique can actually affect the opponent's blood. I wonder if it's because of the continuous blood refinement..."</p><p>The two figures were Qin Sang and his avatar.</p><p>Now, the avatar had successfully formed its Demonic Core, stepping into the Core Formation stage!</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang had been careful with every step, ensuring complete certainty before proceeding.  This was why the entire refinement process had lasted a year.</p><p>There had been two close calls, but because the Corpse Pill originally belonged to Qin Sang, he successfully resolved them and helped his avatar form its Demonic Core.</p><p>The avatar's strength was now truly at the early Core Formation stage. Due to the demonic nature of its cultivation, it could catch opponents off guard.</p><p>After testing the avatar's strength, Qin Sang showed a satisfied expression and instructed the avatar to return to cultivate. He then began his own preparations.</p><p>Shortly after the avatar's breakthrough.</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a large spirit gathering array, filling it with mid-grade spirit stones. Beside him were several jade bottles containing healing elixirs and pills for quickly restoring spiritual energy, as well as jade boxes containing Bloodburst Fruits and Azurefrost Roots.</p><p>The Star Platform was placed before him, and the avatar sat cross-legged opposite him.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly, the Fat Silkworm, and the Twin-Headed Serpent also gathered around.</p><p>Five Core Formation level entities were present in the cave simultaneously. Of course, the Fat Silkworm and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly were more powerful in their unique abilities rather than raw strength.</p><p>Qin Sang had already cultivated the "Celestial Demon Refining Form" to the peak of the second level and was waiting for the influx of stellar energy. To maximize his chances of success, he had waited until the avatar's breakthrough before proceeding.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and said softly, "Let's begin!"</p><p>With that, he landed on the Star Platform and sat cross-legged. The avatar, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, and the other spirit beasts moved closer to the platform, pouring their spiritual energy into it.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't idle either. Multitasking, he prepared the technique while also injecting spiritual energy into the Star Platform, increasing the power of the starlight.</p><p>'Puff! Puff!'</p><p>The Fat Silkworm and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly were the first to exhaust their energy.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly hugged its wings, seemingly asleep. The Fat Silkworm rolled over, lying on the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>Next was the avatar, its spiritual energy depleted, sitting motionless.</p><p>Only Qin Sang and the Twin-Headed Serpent remained.</p><p>The strongest among them was actually the Twin-Headed Serpent. Qin Sang soon felt his own energy depleting. He quickly grabbed a jade bottle and poured the pills into his mouth.</p><p>The Star Platform was like a bottomless pit, greedily devouring all the spiritual energy.</p><p>A faint light flickered on the surface of the Star Platform.</p><p>The power of the constellations was drawn down by the platform.</p><p>The moment the Twin-Headed Serpent exhausted its energy and stopped, a beam of light suddenly appeared above the island, connecting to the starry sky. Stellar energy poured down. Fortunately, the island was remote; otherwise, the phenomenon would surely be noticed.</p><p>Bathed in starlight, Qin Sang quickly circulated his cultivation technique.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a tremor in his heart. A profound and ethereal power descended from the heavens, pouring into him through the top of his head. It surged through his body, carrying with it a dark and mysterious stellarç…ž.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his body trembling as a grimace appeared on his face. He forced himself to remain steady.</p><p>His entire body turned crimson, veins bulging as if blood would seep out.</p><p>Even more terrifying was the state within his body.  Under the impact of such immense stellar energy, his flesh felt as if it were being shredded, cut open bit by bit with a small knife. Inside his bones, it felt as though countless ants were gnawing at his marrow.</p><p>The pain he experienced this time was far more intense than when he broke through to the second level.</p>
