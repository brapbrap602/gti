<h1>Chapter 1556  The Void Immortal Paradise</h1><p>Chapter 1556  The Void Immortal Paradise</p><p>“Is Daoist Friend Qin nearby? Can you contact him now?”</p><p>Lu Zhang’s first question was about Qin Sang’s main body.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. He couldn’t directly take Lu Zhang to meet his main body, so he vaguely replied, “Daoist Friend Qin has been in seclusion for many years, at a crucial stage.  I can only send a message to his cave abode. When he might have free time is hard to say.  Even if Daoist Friend Qin receives the message and comes, it will take some time… Is Lu Daoist’s matter very urgent?”</p><p>It wasn't yet the crucial moment for his main body to break through, meaning he could leave seclusion, but only for something extremely important.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s words, Lu Zhang's expression showed clear disappointment. “Time is what I lack most now; there’s no time to lose. Otherwise, I could return to the mountain gate and ask the headmaster to come out. I thought that Daoist Friend Qin might be traveling with you, and I could rely on his ability to see through illusions.”</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an “Oh,” understanding his implication.</p><p>His main body had defeated Cheng Huanzi of the Six Void Sect, his swordsmanship breaking through the Six Void Mountain’s defenses.  But anyone with discerning eyes could see that other divine abilities must have been used to dispel the illusions and pinpoint Cheng Huanzi’s true form.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi was the sect master, his cultivation no weaker than any of them.  There couldn’t be many people capable of easily breaking through the defenses of the Six Void Mountain.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the ability of the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly, as his main body's life-bound insect Gu, was intrinsically linked to his main body’s cultivation and breakthroughs. Even though the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly itself possessed the ability to hide and protect itself, it was impossible to let the avatar take it around.</p><p>Lu Zhang sighed and explained, “I've cultivated a Daoist technique that, if perfected, can improve my cultivation methods. But I've been stuck at the final stage for years.  To complete the technique, I need to find at least one of several extremely rare objects in the world and refine it into my body.  My sect once knew the location of one of these objects, but an accident prevented us from obtaining it. For years, my sect has been helping me search, and after so many disappointments, I've almost given up on this path. Unexpectedly, I got a lead on Chan Nan Island chain, but the opportunity is fleeting. I must act quickly; I don't have time to ask my sect for help…”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang roughly understood. “Is this object adept at illusionary techniques?”</p><p>“Yes.  Divine objects conceal themselves. These rare treasures naturally possess a self-protective instinct. Even if you know their location, it's not easy to find them. I have a magic treasure called the Baose Bell, a unique magic weapon capable of dispelling illusions, but it's not specialized in that, unlike Daoist Friend Qin’s abilities, and it's somewhat cumbersome to use.”</p><p>Saying this, Lu Zhang’s hand swept across his waist; golden light flashed in his palm, revealing an object.</p><p>In appearance, the Baose Bell didn't look like a bell; it resembled a tower.</p><p>The Baose Bell was square, with concentric rings around it, like layers of a tower, gradually narrowing upwards.</p><p>The inside was empty and had no clapper.</p><p>Lu Zhang infused it with true essence; the Baose Bell remained motionless, yet a clear bell-like sound rang out.  With the sound, visible ripples of precious light spread outwards.</p><p>“This treasure uses this precious light to dispel illusions. As you see, to ensure sufficient power, the range is limited, and it must be constantly activated with true essence. When activated, the Baose Bell's fluctuations cannot be hidden.  If we can find that object quickly, that's good; but if it takes too long, I'm worried that my consumption will attract trouble,” Lu Zhang closed his fingers, putting away the Baose Bell. “Can you accompany me on this trip? The object is hidden deep in Nan Zhou, close to Man Zhou. The Unremitting Mountain rarely ventures there, and I'm unfamiliar with the area; I need a helper.”</p><p>Nanman (Southern Barbarian) and Bei Di (Northern Land) are very far apart, located at the southernmost tip of Zhongzhou Continent.</p><p>Qin Sang had never been to Nanman either.</p><p>Going directly west from the Chan Nan Island chain would lead straight to Nan Zhou.</p><p>Man Zhou is located southwest of Nan Zhou. It is said to be the largest and most sparsely populated state among the Nineteen Rain-swept States.</p><p>Lu Zhang couldn’t find a better helper, so to persuade Qin Sang, he offered a significant reward.  “Daoist, you are skilled in ice-type divine abilities. My headmaster happens to have a peculiar ice crystal containing an extremely yin-cold chilling煞 energy. If you refine it, your divine abilities will gain an added chilling aura. Whether we succeed or not this time, I will ask the headmaster for the ice crystal as a reward. If you don't need the ice crystal, just tell me your requirements, and I will do my best.”</p><p>After hearing Lu Zhang’s description, Qin Sang became somewhat tempted.</p><p>For many years, his Ice Soul Divine Light had progressed slowly, the righteous path likely a dead end.</p><p>Qin Sang had long had an idea, to follow in Liuli's footsteps, find another path, and use extremely cold and yin treasures to forcibly enhance it until it reached perfection.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light was one of the strongest divine abilities Qin Sang had ever seen. Even after his main body advanced to the later stages, it would provide great assistance.</p><p>Yin Lizhu and the molts of the eight-winged cicada are rare treasures.</p><p>Other artifacts may not be suitable for the Ice Soul Divine Light, and Qin Sang wasn't sure, so he could only try them one by one.  Hanjing, this special treasure, was exactly what he needed.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then asked Lu Zhang about the details, weighed the pros and cons, and decided to accompany him.</p><p>Lu Zhang was overjoyed, immediately stood up, and eagerly said, "If you have no other business, Daoist, shall we leave now?"</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his quiet room, summoned the Zhou family couple, and instructed them to remain in the East Sea to observe.  After subduing the blue sharks, as long as they didn't provoke Yuan Ying cultivators, their safety would be guaranteed.</p><p>After an incense stick's time, Qin Sang and Lu Zhang left the market town and headed for Nan Zhou.</p><p>…</p><p>Shonan Port.</p><p>The largest seaport in Nan Zhou.</p><p>The Buling Mountain sect has a base here.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang arrived at Shonan Port almost without stopping, found their base, rested briefly, obtained a map of Nan Zhou, and set off again.</p><p>This time, they headed southwest.</p><p>Deep in the Nan Zhou hinterland, the sights they saw gave Qin Sang a familiar feeling.</p><p>He quickly recalled the source of this feeling – it was the western border of the Canglang Sea Witch God Continent, where he had fallen after being teleported from the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>It was the same desolate and harsh terrain.</p><p>Ordinary people lived in small settlements, transportation was inconvenient, the environment was isolated, and there was little contact with the outside world. Only the northern region, closest to the six states of Jiangzuo, was considered normal; most of Nan Zhou's sects were concentrated there.</p><p>The difference was:</p><p>This place wasn't barren; rather, it was filled with colorful miasma, and dangers lurked everywhere, even threatening cultivators.</p><p>Lu Zhang laughed, "Daoist, do you think Nan Zhou doesn't live up to its reputation among the Nineteen States of the Misty Rain?  When you have the chance to go to Manzhou, you'll see that Nan Zhou is a good place compared to it. In Manzhou, there are often tens of thousands of miles of uninhabited land, more desolate than the Northern Wastelands.  Someone has suggested that Nan and Man should be excluded from the seventeen states. However, legend says that Nan and Man weren't always like this…"</p><p>Lu Zhang couldn't say exactly what it was like before.</p><p>Along the way, they passed several market towns.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the further they went into the Nan Zhou interior, the more proficient Nan Zhou cultivators became in the art of Gu poison, similar to the methods of the Cold Family Three Masters.  They most likely hailed from the Nanman two states, and this area was likely the origin of the Gu God Cult.</p><p>Qin Sang shared this discovery.</p><p>Lu Zhang agreed, "The Gu God Cult's development in the Nanman two states wouldn't attract much attention. After we get the treasure, we'll stay for a few days and investigate the origins of the Gu God Cult."</p><p>When they reached the border between Nan Zhou and Manzhou, it was indeed as Lu Zhang had said – even sparser in population.</p><p>Lu Zhang held several maps, comparing and verifying them for a long time before confirming a direction.</p><p>They flew through the towering mountains for half an hour.</p><p>As they neared their destination, Qin Sang inadvertently glimpsed a village below and, with a light exclamation, lowered their speed.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's action, Lu Zhang, who was ahead, also stopped and followed his gaze.</p><p>The village was large, built at the foot of a river, with tiered bamboo buildings extending to the top of the mountain, almost covering the entire slope.</p><p>The mountaintop was a large, flat, naturally formed stone platform.</p><p>There were no buildings on the stone platform, only a wooden carving placed on the north side, and a fire pit dug in the center.</p><p>Night was falling. The fire pit was piled high with firewood, burning brightly.</p><p>The wind on the mountaintop fanned the flames, sending sparks flying high into the air, like a starry river, drifting far away.</p><p>It seemed to be a special festival in the village.</p><p>Inside the village, men, women, and children had all gathered on the stone platform.</p><p>The night was cool.  Perhaps the fire pit dispelled the chill; they didn't seem to feel the cold, circling the fire pit, performing a strange dance, and chanting rhythmically, as if performing some kind of ritual.</p><p>Soon, they all knelt down, facing the northern statue, and chanted in unison.</p><p>"Vacuum Immortal Land."</p><p>"Vacuum Immortal Land."</p><p>…</p><p>Their cries and expressions were full of fervor.</p><p>This was a world with cultivators.  Even a Qi Condensation cultivator could lord it over mortals. If they wished, a few pills or talismans could alleviate their suffering, and deceiving the ignorant was all too easy.</p><p>They could easily gain the worship of the mortals and enjoy themselves.</p><p>Central State, with its strict regulations across all sects, leaves no room for evil to fester.  The situation is quite different in the remote Southern Barbarian Provinces.  Such occurrences are common in the mortal world.</p><p>However, it was a statue that caught Qin Sang's attention.  The craftsmanship was crude; the figure was thin and gaunt, utterly disproportionate.  Its face was a smooth, featureless plane, utterly bizarre.  The strangest aspect was the crown atop its head, adorned with five jade pieces.  These were clearly not fine jade; they were dull and rough, yet their shape and color precisely matched the pattern on the back of the Gu God's Token.</p><p>“Is this the Gu God Cult?” Qin Sang exclaimed, surprised.  He hadn’t expected to discover the cult’s presence so easily, much less in an ordinary mortal village.  If the Gu God Cult only preached in the mortal world of the Southern Barbarian Provinces, it’s no wonder few noticed them. But what benefit could a cult with a Nascent Soul protector gain by influencing these mortals?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Gu God's Token. He hadn't revealed this to Lu Zhang.  The whereabouts of the Central State Nascent Soul cultivator are unknown, and the future of the cultivation world is uncertain.  Once he achieves a higher cultivation level, he'll be perfectly capable of establishing his own sect and observing the world's trends. There’s no need to tie himself to Mount Bu Nian so early.  There might even be opportunities to cooperate with the Gu God Cult later.</p><p>Qin Sang offered an excuse, pointing to the crown on the statue’s head and telling Lu Zhang it might be related to the Gu God Cult. Lu Zhang, equally puzzled by the cult's motives, used his spiritual sense to scan the statue repeatedly. It was just an ordinary wooden carving, not a magical artifact, possessing no special power.</p><p>“Void Immortal Paradise.”</p><p>“Void Immortal Paradise.”</p><p>…</p><p>The mortals continued chanting, seemingly lost in a fantasy world.  Only this phrase was repeated again and again, with no mention of the Gu God.</p><p>Toward the end of the ceremony, an elder, presumably the village chief, lit a pile of yellow talismans, mixing them into talisman water which was distributed among the villagers. Afterward, everyone contentedly returned home.</p><p>“Not magical talismans, completely ineffective. They just drank a bellyful of ash water,” Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>One village didn’t prove much. The two cultivators didn’t linger, flying onward to a mountain peak. The terrain was extremely rugged, but common in the Southern Barbarian Provinces. Before them lay an unusually flat basin.  For miles around, not a single normal plant could be found; a pervasive smell of decay filled the air, devoid of any life.  Night air rose, wisps of miasma emanating from somewhere, already forming a thick layer in the basin and rapidly spreading upward.  It was easy to imagine that by nightfall, the area would be completely sealed off by miasma.</p><p>“This must be the place,” Lu Zhang said, gazing ahead.</p><p>He held a green bead, jade-like but not transparent, soft to the touch, resembling a certain type of plant seed.</p><p>“You can't find the Stone Toad using this Spirit Illusion Seed?” Qin Sang asked, looking at the bead.</p><p>Lu Zhang was searching for a peculiar object called a Stone Toad.  These creatures were born of heaven and earth, supposedly forming from stone, possessing innate shapeshifting abilities.  Stone Toads absorb the celestial purple energy over time, maturing and eventually transforming into Purple-Veined Toads. At this stage, they develop intelligence and become true living beings. Purple-Veined Toads are elusive and even more effective, but nearly impossible to capture. This urgency on Lu Zhang’s part stemmed from his need to find a nearly mature Stone Toad.</p><p>The Stone Toad's absorption of purple energy causes unique phenomena. When threatened, it disperses spores that mimic the seeds of a plant called Spirit Illusion Flower—the Spirit Illusion Seed.  Their appearance and effects are nearly identical; even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't notice the difference.  Without refinement, true energy can be infused to create illusions, useful in combat and highly attractive to low-level cultivators.  Obtaining a Spirit Illusion Seed is considered a great treasure, unknowingly bypassing the true prize.</p><p>The closer the Stone Toad is to maturity, the more potent its dispersed spores.  The one Lu Zhang possessed could already conjure houses and courtyards—among the most powerful.  A Nascent Soul cultivator had shown it off, but Lu Zhang recognized it as a Stone Toad spore, not a Spirit Illusion Seed, prompting him to subtly learn more.</p><p>Lu Zhang shook his head. “Once the Stone Toad disperses its spores, it sheds its outer shell and completely breaks the connection.”</p>
