<h1>Chapter 690: Golden Radiance Armor</h1><p>The newcomer's attire resembled the young man in black robes, but he looked considerably older.  </p><p>He had lost his target but remained determined, releasing his spirit insect to search.  At that moment, a streak of light approached from afar, a middle-aged man in similar black robes rushing towards him.</p><p>The middle-aged man landed, his gaze sweeping the area.  Seeing only the elder, he frowned and asked,  "Fifth Brother, why are you alone? Where's the youngest brother and the person they were tracking?"</p><p>"Third Brother, the youngest brother…"</p><p>The elder stammered, unable to speak.</p><p>Seeing the elder's expression, a foreboding feeling washed over the middle-aged man. His face darkened, and he roared, "Speak! What happened?!"</p><p>The elder's face was ashen.  "I don't know exactly what happened. I heard the Imperial Thunder Talisman activate and rushed over immediately. When I arrived, the youngest brother was already dead…"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes instantly filled with blood, glaring at the elder. "You just stood there and watched him get killed, letting the murderer escape?"</p><p>The elder shrank back, whispering, "The murderer's escape speed was no less than that of the eldest brother. I only saw a red blur before being easily outrun. Though my cultivation is a realm higher than the youngest brother's, he possessed a treasure and was stronger than me. He'd already used the Imperial Thunder Talisman, yet the attacker was unharmed…"</p><p>"Was it only one person?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, the middle-aged man's pupils constricted. He said solemnly, "The Imperial Thunder Talisman and Golden Radiance Armor, both gifts from Master, were meant to protect the youngest brother. We rushed here upon receiving his signal. Even against a late-stage Core Formation cultivator, he shouldn't have died so quickly. This person could withstand the Imperial Thunder Talisman, easily break the Golden Radiance Armor, and escape as fast as the eldest brother… Could it be a top expert from Duoyan Island? But those individuals were brought under Lin Lao Gui's command. Now that Lin Lao Gui is unwilling to get involved and has sealed the island, they are all confined there in seclusion… Who else could it be?"</p><p>The elder grew increasingly fearful, his face a picture of despair. "Third Brother, the youngest brother was Master's favorite. Now he's dead in the Demon Sea. How will we explain this to Master when we return?"</p><p>The middle-aged man was clearly also afraid. After hesitating, he sighed, "It's done now. We can only wait for the eldest brother to decide…"</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had fled some distance before going into hiding, but he remained cautious.</p><p>Though he couldn't hear the black-robed brothers' discussion, Qin Sang knew they wouldn't give up easily.  He shouldn't reveal himself for a while.</p><p>The black-robed youth's cultivation was low, but his treasures were astonishing. The Imperial Thunder Talisman was incredibly powerful, and Qin Sang was still recovering from the shock.  If not for the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, even with his own sturdy inner armor, Qin Sang would have been in serious trouble; he probably wouldn't have managed to kill the youth before his accomplices arrived.</p><p>It was conceivable that his accomplices were also strong.  Encountering others again, Qin Sang lacked confidence in defeating them and preferred to avoid confrontation.</p><p>Once certain he wasn't being followed, Qin Sang finally relaxed, taking out several items to examine.</p><p>First were several fragments of the Dark Water Mirror.</p><p>Hit directly by the Imperial Thunder Talisman, the mirror's core was pierced, and the central part of the treasure was purified by the divine thunder. The frame shattered into several pieces, which Qin Sang had collected.</p><p>He hadn't held out much hope, and now it was confirmed—the spiritual energy was completely gone.  The surviving fragments were also destroyed internally by the Talisman's power, rendering them useless.</p><p>A top-quality treasure, used for only a few years, destroyed. Qin Sang felt the pain, but the black-robed youth's spoils should compensate for his losses.</p><p>Instead of checking the pouch immediately, Qin Sang first took out the black-robed youth's inner armor.</p><p>"He called it the Golden Radiance Armor,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, raising his hand to examine it carefully.</p><p>Once separated from the body, the Golden Radiance Armor became a palm-sized golden suit.  Soiled and heavily damaged, only a very faint golden glow flickered.</p><p>"Only a top-grade low-level treasure… I wonder what materials were used, it's as hard as a mid-grade treasure."</p><p>The armor wasn't as high-grade as he'd imagined, but Qin Sang wasn't disappointed.</p><p>As a refiner, he knew how rare such inner armor was.  After being soiled by the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, its spiritual energy was severely depleted. Yet, after consecutive strikes from the Ebony Sword and the Flying Night Yaksha, the Golden Radiance Armor wasn't destroyed, demonstrating its exceptional durability.  Among inner armors, it was a top contender.</p><p>Even late-stage Core Formation cultivators only rarely possessed such armor.</p><p>The golden armor provided excellent protection, significantly increasing his chances of survival in emergencies, unless faced with a devastating counter-spell like the Blood-Tainting Light.</p><p>It was unclear whether the young man in black robes had acquired it as spoils of war or received it from his sect.</p><p>The defilement from the Blood-Tainting Light was relatively easy to cleanse with some time and cultivation; however, the cracks in the armor itself were more problematic.  Improper repair could diminish its power.</p><p>The situation had been urgent, so Qin Sang hadn't had time to consider this carefully.</p><p>After examining the cracks for a while, Qin Sang developed a plan.  He first removed the young man's aura, refined the armor slightly, and then stored it in his dantian for cultivation.</p><p>"This inner armor alone compensates for my losses. I wonder what else is in the storage pouch."</p><p>Qin Sang probed the young man's storage pouch with his spiritual sense.  He found four damaged magical artifacts, clearly acquired through killing and plunder.</p><p>This didn't necessarily mean the young man had only killed four people.  In life-or-death struggles between cultivators, they rarely give up until their final breath, often self-destructing their artifacts as a last resort.</p><p>The number of artifacts recovered was a testament to the strength of the young man and his accomplices.</p><p>Two were other cultivators' soulbound artifacts, usable but with reduced power.  Qin Sang focused on the remaining two.</p><p>One was a jade tablet, the other a scroll, both low-grade artifacts.</p><p>These would be much easier to repair. Qin Sang had ample materials and, after refining them, planned to find a safe place to begin the repairs.</p><p>Besides the artifacts, he also found numerous pills, monster cores, and a large collection of talismans of various functions.  Unfortunately, he didn't find a second Thunderbolt Talisman; having one would have been reassuring.</p><p>The young man's possessions were substantial, enabling Qin Sang to continue his training without needing to return for resupply.</p><p>However, the appearance of the Wu people left Qin Sang uneasy.  He worried about hunting demonic beasts near Duyan Island.</p><p>Ignorance was not an option.  Waiting until the trouble reached him would be disastrous.</p><p>"First, I need to find a place to lie low, repair my artifacts, and then investigate what happened on Duyan Island."</p>
