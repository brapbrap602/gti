<h1>Chapter 420: The Burning Ember Sect</h1><p>Chapter 420: The Burning Ember Sect</p><p>The ebony sword coiled around the silver-robed man's corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang soared into the sky, leaving before the others could react.</p><p>The auras in the mountain range had just surfaced, hesitated for a moment, exchanged a few words, then retreated.</p><p>Firstly, the battle ended too quickly. By the time they reacted, Qin Sang was already far away.</p><p>Secondly, the ebony sword's killing of the silver-robed man was truly shocking.  These people couldn't fathom Qin Sang's background and dared not make an enemy of him.</p><p>Qin Sang, certain he wasn't being followed, landed in a secluded spot. He stumbled slightly, then inwardly examined his dantian. His spiritual energy was almost depleted.</p><p>Clearly, consecutively wielding two magic treasures had taken a heavy toll.</p><p>Fortunately, he only used both treasures for short periods. Furthermore, the ebony sword was his natal spirit sword, attuned to his will, allowing for precise control.</p><p>As long as he controlled it well, choosing to unleash only a portion of the ebony sword's power, the consumption wasn't as terrifying as the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Of course, to unleash the ebony sword's full power, he needed to reach the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade bottle, swallowed a blood-enriching pill he'd prepared beforehand, then sat cross-legged. After his dantian recovered, he opened his eyes and looked at the silver-robed man's corpse.</p><p>Fake Golden Core cultivators, regardless of their fighting prowess, combat experience, or decisiveness, were top-notch.  Those who cultivated to this realm were all exceptional among cultivators.</p><p>Killing them might not be difficult, but capturing them alive requires careful planning and favorable circumstances.</p><p>Seeing that capture was impossible, Qin Sang killed him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't regret it much, because whether he killed the silver-robed man or not, the outcome would likely have been the same.</p><p>"The fourth one."</p><p>Qin Sang knelt down, pressed his spiritual energy onto the wound on the silver-robed man's chest, and murmured.</p><p>The silver-robed man was the fourth Kuiyin Sect remnant he'd killed in recent years.</p><p>After learning about the Kuiyin Sect remnants from Yu Hua, Qin Sang had been secretly investigating them. Now, he understood their disguised sect, "Burning Ember," quite well.</p><p>The Burning Ember Sect wasn't weak, but it didn't have many members.  With the Yuanzhao Sect watching closely, they dared not openly recruit disciples.</p><p>The sect leader is Jiupao Daoist, whose alias is Burning Ember.</p><p>This might be related to the magic treasure, Nine Nether Demon Flame.</p><p>Jiupao Daoist has four disciples, known as the Four Burning Ember Envoys. The silver-robed man was one of them, using the alias Silver Ember.</p><p>Two of these Four Burning Ember Envoys were at the Fake Golden Core stage, and the other two were not far behind. Three of them, including the silver-robed man, were Kuiyin Sect remnants.</p><p>However, among these three, only the silver-robed man was Jiupao Daoist's direct disciple. The other two were Yi Tiannie and another Golden Core disciple.</p><p>Only the strongest survived the Yuanzhao Sect's relentless pursuit.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't recognize the last one. After investigating, he suspected this person joined the Burning Ember Sect after its founding and rose to become one of the Four Burning Ember Envoys.</p><p>Whether this person knew the sect's true identity, Qin Sang wasn't sure.</p><p>All four disciples rarely appeared. Although Qin Sang knew their identities, it was difficult to find them alone. The three he had killed previously were ordinary disciples, not Envoys.</p><p>Of course, these three were carefully chosen by Qin Sang, and he left considerable time between each assassination. His aim was to silently cripple Jiupao Daoist, delaying his recovery.</p><p>Discovering Silver Ember's whereabouts was related to the Blood Yuan Essence.</p><p>In recent years, with the changing situation in Xiao Han Domain, the Yuanzhao Sect became less aggressive, allowing the Burning Ember Sect to breathe and secretly become active. The sect's disciples were diligently searching for healing herbs.</p><p>They wouldn't miss the chance to obtain the Blood Yuan Essence, a miraculous healing medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang had been active near Qingyang City recently.  He noticed Silver Ember's movement, connected it to the news of the Blood Yuan Essence auction at Tianyou Pass, and thus devised this assassination plan.</p><p>This also indirectly proved that Jiupao Daoist's injuries hadn't healed, which was excellent news for Qin Sang.</p><p>Even more exciting was that Silver Ember was the one who came to buy the Blood Yuan Essence.</p><p>Eliminating Silver Ember would complete most of his mission.</p><p>Among the Four Burning Ember Envoys, Silver Ember was Jiupao Daoist's favorite and most loyal, so killing him was like severing Jiupao Daoist's arm.</p><p>However, this was the first time using the Heart-Eating Insect Gu to lure his target in the four assassinations.</p><p>It seems that there aren't many Kuiyin Sect disciples proficient in poison and Gu techniques.</p><p>Unlike Silver Ember, the previous three were captured alive.</p><p>When Qin Sang attempted to restrain their spirits, without exception, all of them inexplicably experienced a sudden spirit decay, dying instantly.  Qin Sang couldn't cast the Soul-Seizing Spell in time, nor could they prevent it.</p><p>One could be an accident.</p><p>But three in a row?  Definitely not a coincidence.</p><p>There's only one explanation: the leader of the Jiupao Sect had implanted restrictions within their spirits to prevent soul-searching and revealing his hideout.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by this discovery.</p><p>Yu Hua, besides knowing about the Heart-Eating Insect Gu, seemed to have complete knowledge of the Jiupao Sect remnants' movements, even with the leader's precautions. His identity clearly went beyond that of a mere Yuanzhao Sect traitor.</p><p>This person coveted the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid and also the Jiupao Sect leader; his ambitions were vast. However, with Yu Hua becoming a living corpse, these details became inconsequential.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be sure if the Four Demon Flame Envoys had similar restrictions.  Given the leader's caution, even without restrictions, he would likely use other methods to control them.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang dared not act rashly and proceeded with extreme care.</p><p>Dealing with the other disciples was simpler. Before assassinating the Four Demon Flame Envoys, a careful plan and strategic layout were needed, along with a plausible "reason" to avoid suspicion from the Jiupao leader.</p><p>Alerting the Jiupao leader and causing them to change hiding places would make apprehending him much harder.</p><p>That's why Qin Sang adopted an aggressive stance at the previous auction, deliberately creating animosity with the man in silver robes.</p><p>After the silver-robed man disappeared, the 'Demon Flame' investigation would have a 'reasonable' explanation.</p><p>The cultivation world is fraught with danger; unexpected incidents are commonplace.</p><p>Qin Sang placed a mask on Yin Yan's corpse, transforming him into a corpse puppet, preparing to refine him later, then checked his storage pouch.</p><p>Inside, the Blood Yuan Essence was the most striking item.</p><p>Difficult to sell, it was best kept for personal use.</p><p>With the situation in Yun Cang Great Marsh becoming increasingly tense, healing medicines were essential.</p><p>Having spent fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones on the Blood Yuan Essence, Yin Yan also possessed nearly ten thousand more spirit stones.  The Jiupao leader truly went to great lengths for the Blood Yuan Essence.</p><p>Imagine the Jiupao leader's fury upon learning that his most trusted disciple was assassinated and the Blood Yuan Essence stolen.</p>
