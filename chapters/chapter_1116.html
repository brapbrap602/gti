<h1>Chapter 1108: Karmic Ties</h1><p>"Uncle-Master, I've brought everyone," Tan Yi'en returned and whispered, "I just found out that the two sides fighting are the noble houses of the Great Sui Dynasty—mainly the Qin, Wu, and Bai families—and the other side is an external enemy. The Great Sui is already showing signs of defeat..."</p><p>As he spoke, Tan Yi'en glanced furtively at Qin Sang.</p><p>As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he had easily captured the cultivators behind both sides and halted the battle.</p><p>Upon hearing about the Qin family of the Great Sui and learning that these families still possessed blood-sealed jade pendants left by their ancestors, Tan Yi'en immediately connected the dots. Qin Sang's deliberate stay in the Great Sui and his visit to the mountain to pay respects must have had a reason.</p><p>When he intervened, Tan Yi'en deliberately favored the Great Sui side, treating them kindly and carefully inquiring about the situation before coming to report.</p><p>"The Qin, Wu, and Bai families?" Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. "What about the Great Sui royal family?"</p><p>"It's said that the chaos in the Great Sui began with the fall of the Crimson-Haired Ancestor. The Pure Yang Sect fell into turmoil and had no time to care for the mortal world. Cultivators, now unrestrained, entered the mortal realm, wreaking havoc and abusing their power.</p><p>"Not only the Great Sui, but all the nations within the Pure Yang Sect's territory were plagued by this.</p><p>"These cultivators were still somewhat cautious, fearing retribution, so they supported puppet rulers to wage wars. However, they were not united, leading to widespread chaos in the mortal world and countless deaths among the common people.</p><p>"Until one day, the Qin and other families accidentally revealed their blood-sealed jade pendants. The rogue cultivators discovered that the pendants were left by a cultivator and realized that the Qin family had a cultivator ancestor. This made them hesitant and more restrained.</p><p>"After that, the situation in the Pure Yang Sect stabilized, and the cultivators no longer dared to act recklessly. The situation remained this way for a long time.</p><p>"The cultivators stayed behind the scenes, enjoying offerings, and handed over the Great Sui to the Qin and other families to govern. These families had close ties, and the royal family gradually faded into obscurity, though the nation's strength continued to grow.</p><p>"In recent years, for some reason, the Pure Yang Sect experienced internal strife, likely because no one could command respect after the fall of the Crimson-Haired Ancestor. Hearing this news, the rogue cultivators began to stir again. With the Qin family's ancestor having been silent for many years, the current chaos erupted..."</p><p>Tan Yi'en briefly recounted what he had discovered.</p><p>"Through a series of coincidences, the Qin family has grown to such prominence?" Qin Sang chuckled wryly.</p><p>If it were just the Qin family alone, he might have doubted. But with the Wu and Bai families—likely descendants of Wu Chuanzong and Bai Jianglan—it was almost certain that this Qin family was the original family of his current body. Once mere farmers, they were now just one step away from ruling a nation.</p><p>As Qin Sang and Tan Yi'en conversed, a group of figures stood in the distance, divided into two distinct groups—the cultivators behind both sides.</p><p>They were adorned with jewels and dressed in luxurious garments, having enjoyed immense wealth and status in the mortal world.</p><p>Now, however, they had no desire to fight. The Great Sui side was slightly better off, while the other side was filled with anxiety, their faces pale as if facing imminent disaster.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was more than enough to deal with them.</p><p>Although some of these rogue cultivators had connections that could vaguely link them to Foundation Establishment cultivators, no Foundation Establishment cultivator would risk offending a peer for their sake.</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that the Tan Yi'en they feared was showing utmost respect to another person.</p><p>The identity of this person was self-evident.</p><p>The cultivators were filled with terror.</p><p>"If we had known that the Great Sui had a Golden Core expert behind it, we would have preferred to grow old in the mountains and never set foot in the Great Sui!"</p><p>The same thought flashed through all their minds, filled with regret.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang looked over.</p><p>When their eyes met Qin Sang's gaze, they instinctively shivered, and a wave of unease spread through the group.</p><p>Qin Sang walked over and asked, "I recall that the Great Sui and other nations were once overseen by the Han Family Fort. Aren't you afraid of the Han Family Fort coming after you for causing trouble in the mortal world?"</p><p>After a moment of silence, an elderly man from the Great Sui side stepped forward bravely, bowed respectfully, and replied, "Esteemed Senior, after the Sin Abyss invasion, the Han Family's experts were all recalled to the Pure Yang Sect. The remaining members have since sealed off their mountain and have not interfered in worldly affairs for a long time."</p><p>So that was the case.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the Han Family's patriarch, an old acquaintance.</p><p>"Your name is Bai Hanqiu?" Qin Sang's gaze fell on a young girl behind the elderly man. "What is your relation to Bai Jianglan?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was startled that this mysterious figure had noticed her. Her heart raced with anxiety as she bowed respectfully and said, "Esteemed Senior, Bai Jianglan is my ancestor."</p><p>Her mind was in turmoil.</p><p>Her ancestor was a mere mortal, yet this Golden Core expert knew of him!</p><p>So, she was indeed of Bai Jianglan's bloodline.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, glanced at the elderly man and the others, and continued, "I didn't expect the Bai family to produce a descendant with spiritual roots. Who is your master?"</p><p>Before the girl could answer, the elderly man hastily bowed and said, "Esteemed Senior, Hanqiu has not yet taken a master. As a recipient of the Great Sui's offerings, I made an agreement with several princes that if any of their descendants possessed spiritual roots, I would provide them with cultivation techniques and guide them onto the path of immortality. Over the years, only Bai Hanqiu from the Qin and other families has shown any talent for cultivation."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was stunned, noticing the elderly man frantically signaling her with his eyes.</p><p>"Four spiritual roots..." Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said to Bai Hanqiu, "Since you have no master, and I have some connection with your ancestor, having received his kindness, would you be willing to take me as your master and follow me into the world of cultivation?"</p><p>The debt of Bai Jianglan's life-saving grace would be repaid now.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had considered this, but none of the descendants of the families had shown any talent.</p><p>With only four spiritual roots, Bai Hanqiu might not achieve much in the future.</p><p>However, she would be a seed.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu stood frozen.</p><p>When she first began her cultivation journey, the elderly man had warned her that her chances of reaching Foundation Establishment were slim and that she shouldn't waste too much time on cultivation, squandering her youth.</p><p>Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine that, thanks to her ancestor's legacy, she would have the opportunity to become a disciple of a Golden Core expert.</p><p>Upon hearing this, all the cultivators were filled with envy.</p><p>The elderly man, seeing Bai Hanqiu standing motionless, was frantic with anxiety, wishing he could take her place.</p><p>Tan Yi'en also felt a pang of envy. He stepped forward, took out a short sword artifact, and handed it to Bai Hanqiu, saying, "Congratulations, Junior Sister. As your senior brother, I have little to offer, but this sword is a gift to wish you great achievements in your cultivation... Hurry and thank your master!"</p><p>Only then did Bai Hanqiu snap out of her daze. Tears streamed down her face as she knelt and kowtowed.</p><p>"Disciple thanks Master!"</p><p>"Rise. Since your senior brother is so generous, it seems I must also offer something. This bottle of pills will aid your breakthroughs. Remember to focus on your cultivation in the future. There's still a chance for you to reach Foundation Establishment..."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade bottle and tossed it to Bai Hanqiu, offering a few words of encouragement. He then handed a sword pendant to Tan Yi'en and transmitted a message: "Take Hanqiu down the mountain and settle her mortal affairs. Hang this pendant in the palace. I will go ahead and wait for you at Cuiming Mountain."</p><p>The sword pendant contained a strand of sword energy. Any cultivator approaching would sense the aura of a Golden Core expert.</p><p>Though not a treasure, it was enough to intimidate petty troublemakers.</p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu accepted their orders and left.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the others, his figure flickering as he vanished into the vast night.</p>
