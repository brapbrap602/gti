<h1>Chapter 550: The Summons</h1><p>Qin Sang flew into the black cloud with them. Seeing that most of Qiu Mubai's Skull Guard were disciples of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace and Shaohua Mountain, Qin Sang greeted them one by one and then consciously obeyed orders, acting in unison with the group.</p><p>This kind of dark cloud turned out to be a special type of magical tool that could stabilize spiritual energy.  Relying on the cloud for battle, everyone didn't need to worry about being affected by the chaotic spiritual energy.</p><p>However, it was said that the power of this type of magical tool was limited, effective only during the low tide of the spiritual tide.</p><p>Skull Pass naturally had Golden Core cultivators who took action to clear out large numbers of cloud beasts.</p><p>Their Skull Guard merely filled in the gaps or relayed messages. The danger was not great, but there were exceptions, like the unfortunate demise of Yu Yangzi.</p><p>It was evident that Qiu Mubai was very curious about Qin Sang. The two chatted happily.</p><p>Qin Sang was also skilled at slaying cloud beasts. With him joining in, the group quickly completed their mission and returned to Skull Pass.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, you should go register your merit at Military Roster Mountain first. We'll talk again another day."</p><p>Qiu Mubai thought for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "Junior Brother Qin, with your temperament, you shouldn't be afraid of outside gossip. If any fellow disciples act inappropriately, tell your brother, and I will deal with them."</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, then cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Qiu."</p><p>Bidding farewell to Qiu Mubai, Qin Sang went to Military Roster Mountain to report his success. He also rented a cave dwelling in the city at a considerable price, which made him wince.</p><p>There were free cave dwellings in the military camp, but he needed to treat the Flying Night Devil's injuries, which would be inconvenient there.</p><p>Then he went to find Yun Youzi.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang recalled his conversation with Qiu Mubai.</p><p>When he asked about Duke Dongyang, Qiu Mubai's words were very cautious, and Qin Sang didn't gain much. The image of Duke Dongyang in his mind remained blurry.</p><p>"Let's wait and see..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and activated the restriction on Yun Youzi's cave dwelling.</p><p>…</p><p>"After the opening of the Violet Palace, the three Sect Masters will all arrive at Skull Pass. At that time, they will lead us to the inner layers of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to meet up with the others. All those who hold the Violet Secret Talisman will receive protection."</p><p>Yun Youzi had already gathered the information, and all the necessary preparations were complete.</p><p>"Won't we be too conspicuous?"</p><p>Those who possessed the Violet Secret Talisman were basically all Golden Core cultivators. The two of them, at the pseudo-Golden Core realm, mixed in with them...being noticed by Duke Dongyang might be good or bad.</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "Even if we go to other fortified passes, we'll have to meet up eventually and still be discovered. It's better to stay with our own Sect Master, who can truly protect us. The Violet Palace is in the deepest part of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and the journey there might not be peaceful."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The Violet Palace was imperative; other things couldn't be helped.</p><p>The two discussed the matter together for a while, then went their separate ways to prepare.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang patiently waited at Skull Pass.</p><p>He didn't follow his original plan to be an idle freeloader. Whenever he had free time, he would join Qiu Mubai's team and go out with them to hunt cloud beasts.</p><p>…</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>A pitch-black hand appeared out of thin air, leaving a deep claw mark on the wall of the cave dwelling, before the Flying Night Devil's figure materialized.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, contemplating the claw mark left by the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Nearly half a year had passed, and the healing process had been remarkably effective.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil's strength had already recovered to the level of a pseudo-Golden Core cultivator. The subsequent recovery speed would be faster and faster, and he would definitely be healed before the Violet Palace opened.</p><p>"Fortunately, I refined a lot of Lesser Yin Magnetic Vials. The consumption is truly enormous."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, retrieving the Flying Night Devil into the Corpse Puppet Pouch. He took out a jade pendant, opened the cave, and strolled towards an auction house.</p><p>With countless experts gathered at Skull Pass, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity. He had attended several auctions, hoping to encounter Myriad Ages Camphor, Celestial Capital Rock, and Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>Unfortunately, the first two spiritual materials had never appeared, and even if Soul-Guiding Grass did, it was sent to the Devil Cultivator territory.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had gained nothing.</p><p>This time was no exception. After the auction ended, Qin Sang walked out of the auction house with a disappointed look.  Noticing the flashing of his Skull Guard token, he flew directly towards Military Roster Mountain.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin."</p><p>Qiu Mubai had already assembled his men. "This might be our last chance to go outside the pass before the spiritual tide ends. I figured Junior Brother Qin wouldn't want to miss it, so I took the liberty of calling you over."</p><p>Qin Sang asked in surprise, "Are they closing the pass?"</p><p>"More or less," Qiu Mubai nodded. "The spiritual tide is about to reach its peak. I heard that this might be the last waning period.  After this, going outside would be a death sentence. We’ll likely seal the pass and hold on, enduring this period until the spiritual tide passes."</p><p>Thank goodness I came early!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced.  After a moment of thought, he asked, "The Violet Palace is about to appear, isn't it? With the pass being sealed now, have the Patriarchs already arrived?"</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Qiu Mubai shook his head and gave the order to move out immediately.</p><p>When the city gates opened and they exited, Qin Sang looked back.</p><p>On both sides of Skull Pass, and in the sky above, a seemingly thin yet boundless barrier firmly blocked the spiritual tide, protecting the countless lives behind it.</p><p>High in the sky, the spiritual tide, easily capable of crushing them into dust, surged wave after wave, continuously impacting the barrier, yet appearing so feeble.</p><p>Compared to the primordial barrier, the protective spiritual formation on Skull Pass, which had accumulated the efforts of countless Nascent Soul experts over countless years, seemed extremely dim.</p><p>This barrier...who created it?</p><p>And when?</p><p>Qiu Mubai noticed Qin Sang's gaze and said with emotion, "Thinking back to ancient times, a celestial being could wave their hand and set up this barrier, easily blocking the spiritual tide and protecting all living beings. Such grace...makes one yearn for it...in our lifetime, I wonder who among us will be fortunate enough to reach such a realm!"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then slowly nodded.</p><p>This waning period of the spiritual tide was unusually short. Not long after Qin Sang and the others went out, they noticed something amiss and hurried back, finally returning to Skull Pass before the waning period ended.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as they entered the pass, they heard someone calling their names. Looking towards the voice, they found it was Zhan Yi, Che Yutao's personal disciple.</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhan, what's the matter? Why are you calling us so urgently?"</p><p>Seeing Zhan Yi's anxious expression, they walked over and asked.</p><p>Zhan Yi was already a pseudo-Golden Core cultivator, and also Che Yutao's personal disciple, yet he showed no arrogance. He bowed to them before saying, "Senior Brothers, Master just issued an order, summoning all Late Foundation Establishment cultivators in Skull Pass. I couldn't find you three, and only then learned that you had gone outside the pass."</p><p>"Martial Uncle Che has summoned us? What important matter is it?"</p><p>The three exchanged glances and asked hurriedly.</p><p>Zhan Yi said urgently, "Only a few Senior Brothers are missing. You'll know when you get there."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others didn't dare delay. They immediately selected two Late Foundation Establishment fellow disciples from their team and hurried off with Zhan Yi.</p><p>The group rushed on their way. After entering Che Yutao's residence, Qin Sang quickly glanced around.</p><p>At one glance, he saw it.</p><p>Che Yutao was sitting in the main hall, but in a side seat.</p><p>In the main seat sat a woman wearing a cloak.</p>
