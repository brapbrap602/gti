<h1>Chapter 1179: The Invasion</h1><p>These days, he had also been keeping an eye on the situation.  </p><p>Perhaps due to the emergence of the Purple Palace, it seemed that the Abyss of Sin was truly preparing to lower its banners and cease hostilities. Not only at the Triple Pass, but information from other regions also suggested the same—only minor skirmishes remained.  </p><p>However, the more it seemed so, the more one could not afford to let their guard down.  </p><p>...  </p><p>Inside the tall tower.  </p><p>Qin Sang remained utterly focused.  </p><p>The process of mapping the killing talisman onto the sword soul had already been completed. The next step was to fuse the sword soul with the seven corporeal souls.  </p><p>Soul and corporeal souls...  </p><p>Though these terms were often casually mentioned, to modern cultivators, they were synonymous with the divine soul and the primordial spirit. Some soul-splitting secret techniques merely involved splitting a fragment from the divine soul.  </p><p>But to truly delve into the distinctions of the three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls was, for Qin Sang, a realm of profound mystery.  </p><p>Qin Sang had read various interpretations in the profound texts of the Daoist canon.  </p><p>Some Daoist scriptures recorded: The three ethereal souls are named Tai Guang, Shuang Ling, and You Jing. The seven corporeal souls are Shi Gou, Fu Shi, Que Yin, Tun Zei, Fei Du, Chu Hui, and Chou Fei—all considered the turbid spirits within the body.  </p><p>However, these were merely theoretical and mythological, with no actual cultivation methods associated with them.  </p><p>The idea of fusing each sword soul with the seven corporeal souls was something Qin Sang had never even heard of.  </p><p>He himself did not know where to begin, so he could only concentrate his mind to comprehend, repeatedly circulating his cultivation techniques. Through this, he gradually sensed a connection and, guided by the techniques, began to fuse the sword souls bit by bit.  </p><p>This process was slow and fraught with complications.  </p><p>But Qin Sang had ample patience.  </p><p>Days passed like this.  </p><p>Without any disturbances, Qin Sang remained in the tower, wholly absorbed in comprehending the techniques. Finally, he made progress—one sword soul showed signs of fusing with his primordial spirit.  </p><p>After that, the pace quickened, and the second sword soul also began to show similar signs.  </p><p>"It seems that both are fusing with my primordial spirit, but the energies involved in fusing with these two sword souls feel subtly different..."  </p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  </p><p>He had an ineffable sense of this, though he couldn't quite articulate it.  </p><p>"Unless this technique is merely borrowing the name, it's possible that the three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls truly exist! If so, then the Netherworld, the Yellow Springs, the King of Hell, and even the Six Paths of Reincarnation and reincarnation itself—could these be more than just legends?"  </p><p>Qin Sang thought for a long time before slowly shaking his head. Even if they existed, such matters were beyond his current reach.  </p><p>He set aside these distracting thoughts and was about to continue his cultivation when he was suddenly startled by a sharp ringing sound. His expression shifted slightly.  </p><p>The sound of the Cold Bell signaled that something was amiss.  </p><p>Qin Sang quickly halted his cultivation and pushed open the door to his meditation chamber. He found Si Di and Jing Lin already there, both wearing grave expressions.  </p><p>"Several watchtowers have reported signs of large-scale activity from the Abyss of Sin. This time, it doesn't seem like a feint. I've already ordered them all to withdraw..."  </p><p>Jing Lin explained softly, sharing all the intelligence with Qin Sang.  </p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the tower, where streaks of light flickered incessantly—the army was already mobilizing.  </p><p>"Are the two of you planning to hold the Triple Pass?"  </p><p>Qin Sang asked in return.  </p><p>"Exactly," Si Di nodded. "Right now, we still can't discern the Abyss of Sin's intentions. Whether they're preparing for a desperate strike before the Purple Palace emerges, as Daoist Zhen Yi speculated, or if they're acting as usual, the safest choice is to hold the pass and wait for news from Stone Song Mountain. Once the situation becomes clear, we can decide our next move."  </p><p>Jing Lin added, "We're also concerned that if we act rashly, we might fall into a trap set by the Abyss of Sin. Daoist Si Di will go and organize the troops. Originally, I would have been the one to control the Cold Bell Formation, but with Daoist Ming Yue here, I can remain hidden for now. When the time is right, we can give the enemy a surprise!"  </p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang roughly understood their strategy.  </p><p>The Triple Pass was second only to Stone Song Mountain in importance. The Cold Bell Formation was exceedingly complex, and only a Nascent Soul cultivator could unleash its true power.  </p><p>With two Nascent Soul cultivators—one holding the central command and the other leading the army into battle—they now had an extra hand. If they could seize the opportunity to ambush and severely injure one of the Abyss of Sin's Nascent Soul cultivators, it would essentially secure their victory.  </p><p>This had been the agreement before Qin Sang's arrival.  </p><p>However, after some thought, Qin Sang proposed an idea, "Do you have any way to operate the Cold Bell Formation without my direct control? I would also like to venture out and witness the abilities of the Abyss of Sin's Nascent Soul cultivators."  </p><p>"Daoist, you're willing to join the battle personally?"  </p><p>The two were overjoyed.  </p><p>They were well aware of the terms of their agreement and had not expected these demon kings to offer assistance without any benefit.  </p><p>Qin Sang's declaration was unexpected.  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "If the Abyss of Sin succeeds, our demon race will find it difficult to remain unscathed. I have long wanted to contribute. I believe I have some skill in escape techniques, so even if I can't defeat them, I should be able to preserve my life."  </p><p>The two exchanged glances.  </p><p>Si Di pondered, "I will go out first to draw out one of their leaders. The two of you can remain hidden and strike unexpectedly. If we act simultaneously, we might even be able to destroy their Nascent Soul along with their body!"  </p><p>Throughout the three-domain war, very few Nascent Soul cultivators had fallen in battle.  </p><p>Each Nascent Soul cultivator was a cunning and cautious individual. More importantly, once a Nascent Soul left the body, it possessed the ability to teleport and had extraordinary speed, making it extremely difficult to restrain.  </p><p>The leaders of the three major merchant alliances of Canglang Sea were unlucky to encounter the enigmatic ancient demon. Otherwise, even if they lost their physical bodies, their Nascent Souls could have escaped.  </p><p>"Even if we can't kill the Nascent Soul, destroying their physical body would still weaken the Abyss of Sin's strength! Finding a suitable body wouldn't be easy for them, and their power would inevitably diminish. If we succeed, we will certainly commend Daoist Ming Yue for his contribution!"  </p><p>Jing Lin's face was filled with joy.  </p><p>Si Di, however, remained calm and thought of a difficulty, "Although the formation artifacts can be handed over to Golden Core juniors to control, the formation is too complex. Whether it's us or Golden Core cultivators operating it, the power difference is significant. Over the years, the Abyss of Sin has become very familiar with the Cold Bell Formation. It won't be easy to deceive them. If they notice anything unusual about the formation, they will surely be on guard."  </p><p>"Daoist, you make a valid point. This indeed requires careful consideration."  </p><p>Jing Lin set aside his joy and pondered for a moment before saying, "At the beginning, the Cold Bell Formation will primarily be in a defensive stance. The Abyss of Sin won't commit all their forces immediately, so the formation's performance won't show any obvious differences."  </p><p>Si Di hesitated, "This window of time is too short. It will likely be difficult to find an opportunity."  </p><p>"Regardless, it's worth a try. Even if we can't kill their Nascent Soul, I can eliminate a few Golden Core cultivators without affecting the overall battle. Then I can return to control the Cold Bell Formation and assist you..."  </p><p>Qin Sang said.  </p><p>His main goal was still to get close to the Abyss of Sin's Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>The shadow of the ancient demon with three heads and six arms, which had ambushed him before, still lingered in Qin Sang's mind.  </p><p>If the Abyss of Sin truly had any connection to the ancient demon, he would need to prepare an escape route and plan for the long term.  </p><p>The three of them discussed many details and finalized their strategy.  </p><p>Jing Lin secretly summoned a Golden Core peak cultivator, a junior from his sect, and handed the formation artifacts over to him, giving detailed instructions to ensure that the disguise was maintained.  </p><p>Afterward, Si Di went out to deploy the troops, awaiting the arrival of the Abyss of Sin's forces.  </p><p>******</p>
