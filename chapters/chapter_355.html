<h1>Chapter 348: The Trap</h1><p>Liang Yan sealed the restriction, stepped out of the courtyard, paused slightly, and a flash of spiritual energy enveloped him as he changed into a black robe, his face hidden beneath the hood.  He glanced at Feng Cang Market, pondered briefly, and then swiftly headed down the mountain.</p><p>The pulsation of the Heart-Eating Insect had already left Feng Cang Market, and then its speed suddenly increased, clearly indicating the person had used a magical artifact or escape technique.  This allowed Liang Yan to roughly gauge the person's strength. The speed wasn't particularly fast. Based on this, he estimated the person's cultivation to be only at the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Liang Yan's ideal scenario was to control a late Foundation Establishment cultivator; this would allow him to navigate dangerous situations with ease and gather better cultivation resources.  An early Foundation Establishment cultivator was also a significant asset, far stronger than someone at the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Liang Yan reached the foot of the mountain. He slowed his pace, cautiously scanning his surroundings out of habit.  Finding nothing unusual, he silently activated his escape technique, his figure disappearing on the spot as he stealthily pursued his target.</p><p>Having broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Liang Yan felt confident in directly pursuing the target. Without the aid of any magical artifacts, he could easily keep pace.</p><p>From a distance, he saw a white light streaking across the sky, heading straight towards the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. He could vaguely sense the spiritual energy fluctuations, confirming his earlier guess—it was indeed an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>The white light emanated from a shuttle-shaped flying artifact of low quality, a mere high-grade artifact, consistent with the cultivator's strength. Liang Yan nodded subtly but didn't rush to attack. He maintained a maximum distance from the Heart-Eating Insect's pulsation, silently trailing behind while observing the surroundings and the target's movements.</p><p>After some time, Liang Yan patiently followed. No one was trailing them; the person remained alone throughout.  They were now far from Feng Cang Market, and the terrain had begun to change, with mountains rising and falling, and the swamps shrinking. The mist, already thin near Feng Cang Market, had almost completely disappeared here. The lingering smell of decay was also significantly weaker.</p><p>Suddenly, the light ahead flickered and vanished without warning. Liang Yan showed no urgency, as he could easily sense the person's location through the Heart-Eating Insect. He instantly changed direction, heading towards the left front.</p><p>"This direction… Tianfeng Mountain, Hui Valley, Wan Shou Ridge…"</p><p>Liang Yan muttered to himself. These were places in that direction, all sharing a common trait: while lacking any significant secret realms, they were teeming with cloud beasts. Many cultivators hunted cloud beasts there, collecting spirit-infused demonic objects to earn spirit stones; with good luck, they might even find spirit mines.  Liang Yan himself had spent time in the area during his early Foundation Establishment days.</p><p>Everything pointed to it.</p><p>Liang Yan abruptly accelerated. The person, having abandoned their conspicuous flying artifact and significantly reduced their escape technique speed, was quickly overtaken.</p><p>Liang Yan became invisible, silently appearing atop a mountain, observing the area ahead. The desolate mountain range appeared unremarkable. Liang Yan focused his spiritual energy, staring in one direction. Although he couldn't see the person, his sharp spiritual senses detected subtle spiritual energy fluctuations emanating from that spot.</p><p>The person was speeding through the mountains, seemingly oblivious to the impending danger.</p><p>A cold smile played on Liang Yan's lips. He decisively activated his insect control technique, awakening the insect.</p><p>A scream suddenly echoed from ahead, and a somewhat translucent figure tumbled out of thin air, falling headfirst into the swamp at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>A wave of mud churned.</p><p>Liang Yan didn't intend to kill the person, so he only ordered the Heart-Eating Insect to severely injure their primordial spirit, rendering them incapable of resistance.  He would capture them alive and deal with them later.</p><p>The poisonous insect worked its magic! This was a secret technique created by a Nascent Soul ancestor; Liang Yan had never considered the possibility of the Heart-Eating Insect failing. As he awakened the insect, he moved.</p><p>In an instant, Liang Yan arrived, his palm glowing with azure light as a rope-like artifact, one of his most trusted, the Soul-Binding Rope, shot out like a serpent.</p><p>The Soul-Binding Rope transformed into a streak of azure light, incredibly agile.  Just as it was about to enter the swamp and bind the person, a burst of light shot out from the swamp.</p><p>This light alternated between black and white, dazzling the eyes.  Strangely, upon colliding with the strange light, the Soul-Binding Rope faltered, twisting into a knot, losing its control.</p><p>Before Liang Yan could react, a cold wind swept through the valley, and an endless black mist surged forth.</p><p>Black mists surged from the swamp, within which six ghostly banners materialized, their movements unleashing a relentless torrent of malevolent spirits and dark energy.</p><p>Instantly, the entire valley became a horrifying realm of ghostly cries and wails.  Countless strange, ethereal threads, hidden within the mist, silently lunged towards Liang Yan.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Formation was activated!</p><p>The person Liang Yan was tracking was Qin Sang!</p><p>A month had passed since Yun Youzi's departure.  After seeing Yun Youzi off, Qin Sang had left Tan Hao to break through at Yin Mountain Pass while she infiltrated the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Tan Hao, familiar with the Yin Mountain Pass area, had briefed Qin Sang thoroughly.</p><p>Expecting a difficult search, Qin Sang unexpectedly located Liang Yan's secluded dwelling in Feng Cang Market Town within days, thanks to Tan Hao's connections.</p><p>In recent years, Liang Yan, perhaps feeling the pressure had lessened, had become less cautious about concealing his whereabouts, especially since he was always with Shi Hong, making him easy to find.</p><p>Since Liang Yan was cultivating in the market town and unlikely to act within its confines, Qin Sang began operating nearby, waiting for an opportunity to strike as he left.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liang Yan, a dedicated cultivator, proved remarkably patient, remaining in seclusion for a full month without any sign of leaving.  At this rate, it was uncertain when he would emerge.</p><p>Just then, good news arrived from Tan Hao.  Guided by Yun Youzi, Tan Hao had experienced a breakthrough during his seclusion.</p><p>Aware that the longer he waited, the slimmer his chances of achieving Foundation Establishment would become, Tan Hao decided to gamble everything, immediately consuming a Biying Pill and a Foundation Establishment Pill.  Miraculously, he succeeded!</p><p>This surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators often spend ten or more years in seclusion, a wait Qin Sang couldn't afford.  Upon Tan Hao's arrival, she immediately altered her plan, deciding to break the Xu Yuan Seal on her soul and unleash the Heart-Eating Insects.</p><p>If Liang Yan was familiar with this type of venomous insect technique, it should lure him out!</p><p>Yin Mountain Pass bordered righteous forces; the probability of finding remnants of the Kui Yin Sect in Feng Cang Market Town was low.  Even if a late Foundation Establishment cultivator were present, Qin Sang, with her treasures – particularly the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman – could easily escape, even if she couldn't kill them.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang stationed Tan Hao at the entrance to Feng Cang Market Town to alert her to any unusual activity, giving her time to react.</p><p>This strategy proved effective!</p>
