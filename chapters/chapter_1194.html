<h1>Chapter 1186: Soul-Extinguishing Cone</h1><p>Chapter 1186: Soul-Extinguishing Cone</p><p>Outside the Cold Bell Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Lin appeared.</p><p>One after the other, a green light shone before Jing Lin, emanating from a green jade bracelet, the magical artifact, the Wind-Calling Bracelet.</p><p>Twelve demonic banners surrounded Qin Sang.</p><p>Against Lao Mo Pei, sheltered by the Youjing Tower, there was only one chance. Qin Sang directly summoned the twelve demonic banners to ensure success.</p><p>Now a Yuan Ying cultivator, he no longer needed to hide his strength.  Revealing some of it at the right time could even deter those with ill intentions.</p><p>Moreover, his trump cards went beyond the twelve demonic banners.</p><p>Their plan was simple: while Jing Lin distracted Lao Mo Pei on another battlefield, they would break through the Youjing Tower's protective barrier, and Qin Sang would unleash the demonic fire to kill Lao Mo Pei.</p><p>Lao Mo Pei was participating in the siege of Si Di; at that time, the Youjing Tower's protection would be at its weakest.</p><p>Jing Lin led the charge.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he pushed forward with both hands. The Wind-Calling Bracelet emitted a whistling sound, transforming into a green gust of wind, rushing towards the Youjing Tower at incredible speed.</p><p>This was no ordinary wind; it was a spiritual wind created by Jing Lin using his full power, its visual impact less impressive than a gale, but its power was undeniable.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, the Wind-Calling Bracelet reached the barrier.</p><p>The Youjing Tower trembled, the barrier flashing with black light. Lao Mo Pei couldn't react in time; the Youjing Tower launched a counterattack.  Thick black light surged towards the point of impact, resisting the spiritual wind's assault.</p><p>Jing Lin had planned this meticulously and used his full strength. If it were that easily stopped, it would have been a waste of his Yuan Ying status!</p><p>At this moment, the Wind-Calling Bracelet shone brightly, like a giant vortex, constantly releasing spiritual wind from the artifact, instantly transforming into a terrifying hurricane.</p><p>With a slight tremor, the Wind-Calling Bracelet gathered all the spiritual wind and slammed into the barrier.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The thunderous roar that Chan Ling and Old Devil Tan heard was this sound!</p><p>The three Youming Towers violently shook. The impact sent shockwaves in all directions, causing low-level cultivators to tumble.</p><p>The barrier shattered.</p><p>The Youming Towers were tougher than expected; the Wind-Calling Bracelet failed to completely destroy the barrier, which began to repair itself.</p><p>However, the demonic fire that followed was too much for the barrier, and it finally shattered completely!</p><p>A gaping hole tore through the barrier, and the gale and demonic fire surged inside.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly changed his hand seals. The twelve demonic banners fluttered, the demonic fire raging; the banners seemed to ignite.  The Nine Netherworld Demonic Fire transformed into a black dragon of flame, roaring wildly, and with unstoppable force, charged towards Lao Mo Pei's hiding place, under the horrified gaze of countless onlookers!</p><p>The change was too swift.</p><p>Lao Mo Pei was caught completely off guard. He had been outmaneuvered!</p><p>From the appearance of Qin Sang and Jing Lin to the breaking of the barrier and the demonic fire dragon reaching Lao Mo Pei, it all happened in an instant. By the time he reacted, it was too late; the crisis was imminent!</p><p>No, it was despair!</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Netherworld Demonic Fire, Lao Mo Pei's face was filled with terror.</p><p>The demonic fire’s power was terrifying; none of his available means could withstand it. Lao Mo Pei had no doubt about his fate.</p><p>This was almost a certain death situation!</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh!’</p><p>The demonic fire arrived.</p><p>Lao Mo Pei’s protective aura was instantly shattered, the demonic fire overwhelming him; even escaping with his Yuan Ying was impossible.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lao Mo Pei did not give up, a look of resentment and intense hatred flashing in his eyes. He suddenly let out a fierce roar!</p><p>The shriek was sharp and piercing.  Lao Mo Pei, surrounded by demonic fire, hair dishevelled, looked like a madman. This roar was Lao Mo Pei's desperate cry before death.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and Jing Lin felt a sense of foreboding!</p><p>Without using any secret technique, a strange shadow suddenly appeared behind Lao Mo Pei.  The shadow split into three, shooting out and instantly sinking into the crystal balls atop the Youjing Towers.</p><p>The next moment, Lao Mo Pei suddenly aged by several hundred years, his hair turning white and his face wrinkling.</p><p>The dignified Yuan Ying Grandmaster transformed into a decrepit old man!</p><p>His Yuan Qi had been drained by the shadow, sacrificed to the Youjing Tower.</p><p>Simultaneously, the three Youjing Towers shone brightly with black light, the endless black light rushing towards the crystal balls at the top, instantly turning pitch-black, like three demonic eyes.</p><p>The bizarre sight made one's hair stand on end.</p><p>The Youjing Tower emitted a faint, strange fluctuation.  Black light erupted, transforming into two black, needle-like projectiles that appeared before Qin Sang and Jing Lin as if teleporting.</p><p>Sensing the tower's emanation, Qin Sang's expression drastically changed.  He had never encountered this type of fluctuation or these projectiles before, yet they felt strangely familiar.</p><p>"Watch out for the Soul-Extinguishing Cones!" Jing Lin urgently warned.</p><p>Without hesitation, he crushed a talisman, its power forming a small, round shield.  The Soul-Extinguishing Cones were one of the tower's attack methods, specifically targeting the soul and incredibly difficult to defend against.  They had caused significant losses among the Two Realms Alliance's Yuan Ying cultivators.  Eventually, the alliance developed a talisman called the Profound Shield Charm, which changed the situation.</p><p>Having anticipated all possibilities in their attack on Old Man Pei, they naturally had these talismans ready.  Qin Sang instinctively crushed one as well, but his eyes remained grave, his mind a tempest.  He knew the source of that familiarity.</p><p>Seven-Kill Hall, beneath Yi Tian Peak, the Sealed Demon Space.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace elder escaped using the Sky Phoenix Feather.  While everyone was besieging the Demon Lord, and the situation seemed favorable, the Demon Lord suddenly merged with his soul fragment, using an unknown technique to instantly reverse the tide.  Ling Zhuzi, the Demon Master, the Grand Shaman, Old Man Fang, and others – all top-tier cultivators from the Canglang Sea – were all severely wounded, none escaping unscathed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the technique's name – the "Splitting Yuan, Slaying God".  The reason for their swift defeat was this technique's ability to directly harm the soul; it was extremely unpredictable, especially since it was wielded by the ancient Demon Lord.  The scene of utter despair remained vividly etched in Qin Sang's memory.</p><p>The Youjing Tower and its Soul-Extinguishing Cones, both in appearance and aura, were completely different from the "Splitting Yuan, Slaying God," and their power was far inferior.  Although Qin Sang had studied the tower's data, he never connected the two.  Now, experiencing the tower's fluctuation firsthand, he still couldn't find definitive proof of their common origin, yet his intuition screamed that the cones and the Demon Lord's technique were related.</p><p>This was terrifying.  He wondered if "Splitting Yuan, Slaying God" was a unique technique only the Demon Lord possessed. Could there be a Demon Lord behind the Abyss of Sin?  But if so, conquering the entire Northern Star Realm would be child's play, not just for the Heaven's Path Alliance.</p><p>Countless thoughts flooded Qin Sang's mind.  But the current situation allowed no time for reflection.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A Soul-Extinguishing Cone reached Jing Lin.  The shield formed by the Profound Shield Charm was pierced!  Jing Lin suspected Old Man Pei's last stand wasn't simple, but he never imagined the charm would break so easily.  The cone then hurtled towards him, leaving Jing Lin shocked and speechless.</p>
