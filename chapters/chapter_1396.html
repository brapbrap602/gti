<h1>Chapter 1388: Deceiving the Heavens</h1><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang felt suspicious.</p><p>The others were fiercely competing with each other.</p><p>Instead of fighting for the Ice Box, the Rainbow Rat secretly left the desolate island at this crucial moment, deceiving not only the human cultivators, but seemingly also keeping its movements hidden from all the Demon Kings.</p><p>When things are abnormal, there must be something strange!</p><p>Moreover, the Rainbow Rat had transformed into an Ice Rat, hiding in the ice explosion with its aura perfectly concealed, seamless.</p><p>The ice explosion triggered by the white-robed man seemed to be prepared specifically for it.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.</p><p>His gaze swept between the white-robed man and the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>He was certain that the white-robed man he had locked onto was the true body!</p><p>This was somewhat strange.</p><p>However, the situation was about to erupt, unpredictable. Qin Sang had too little information and no time to carefully sort out all the reasons, so he instinctively made a decision.</p><p>He remained calm, his true body still pursuing the white-robed man, but he harbored his own intentions and did not alert anyone to the Rainbow Rat’s unusual movements.</p><p>At the same time, a faint ripple appeared in the void around Qin Sang.</p><p>The other Nascent Souls and Demon Kings were focused on the white-robed man and the Ice Box, and did not notice that an invisible butterfly, leaving Qin Sang, gently flapped its wings and flew off the desolate island in the direction the Rainbow Rat had taken!</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly fluttered, its figure light and nimble.</p><p>Its innate invisibility was its most fundamental means of self-preservation.</p><p>However, the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s body was too fragile compared to cultivators and demonic beasts of the same realm, and Qin Sang rarely allowed it to leave his sight for fear of accidents.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat was clearly weakened.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly had high intelligence, and there was also a Nascent Soul puppet stationed near the desolate island as backup. Dealing with a Rainbow Rat should be foolproof, so there was no need to worry about the Celestial Eye Butterfly’s safety.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Rainbow Rat had secretly taken something away, preparing to deceive the heavens and carry out a clandestine assassination. (lit. to deceive the heavens and cross the sea)</p><p>Even if he guessed wrong, there would be no loss.</p><p>Outside the desolate island.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat succeeded, turning its head to glance back.</p><p>Its eyeballs were eerily pale white, like two snowballs embedded in its head, its gaze appearing empty, but then a hint of struggle emerged.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat suddenly turned its head and fled quickly along the surface of the sea, its target the Storm Belt!</p><p>After the Rainbow Rat had left a certain distance.</p><p>A black shadow emerged from under the sea surface, silently.</p><p>Immediately, the Celestial Eye Butterfly flew over and landed lightly on the black shadow's shoulder. A puppet and a butterfly followed the direction the Rainbow Rat had left.</p><p>On the desolate island.</p><p>The fighting became more intense.</p><p>The white-robed man's true body was finally exposed.</p><p>In an instant, everyone's eyes focused on the white-robed man.</p><p>The white-robed man seemed to know that he was in a dead end. Without turning his head, he desperately charged forward, making a final struggle.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was not the closest to the white-robed man, he had locked onto the white-robed man's true body early on with the help of the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>His figure flashed continuously, and in the blink of an eye, he swept past several mountain ranges. At the same time, he summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, facing the white-robed man from afar. He impolitely slashed out a sword towards his back.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation, unexpectedly discovering that a crystal clear round shield had appeared out of thin air behind the white-robed man.</p><p>The round shield was not large, cast entirely from Xuan Ice (Dark Ice), looking very thin and fragile, and shattered in response, but it successfully blocked Qin Sang’s sword.</p><p>The white-robed man was impacted by the force, his body lunging forward abruptly, then immediately leaping up and continuing to flee.</p><p>"Something's wrong!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Although the exchange was brief, Qin Sang keenly felt that the white-robed man was somewhat strange.</p><p>However, Bi Fang and the other demons were only half a beat slower than Qin Sang, because after the white-robed man activated the great formation, they received a sound transmission from the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat had left a mark in the white-robed man's body, and illusions could not erase it.</p><p>On the other hand, Feng Shangshi (Master Wind) and the others, started out like headless flies. Qin Sang did not remind them, causing them to determine which one was the white-robed man's true body last, and their attacks were the slowest.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators, every second counts.</p><p>In a moment.</p><p>Behind the white-robed man, rays of light chased relentlessly, some ahead, some behind.</p><p>Qin Sang was almost keeping pace with Bi Fang.</p><p>The Frogfish was originally the closest to the white-robed man, and followed up in time. The other Demon Kings were left behind, some simply went to fight for the Ice Box.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was about to face a situation of fighting two enemies alone.</p><p>Fortunately, Feng Shangshi did not disappoint Qin Sang, transforming into a clear wind, stepping forward and closely following behind them.</p><p>"Please, friend, stop them for a moment! After Feng succeeds, you will have a share of the treasure!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi was secretly anxious, and sent a sound transmission to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, and he snorted coldly: "Just who is he? It seems that you already knew the inside story? But I am still kept in the dark!"</p><p>Feng Shangshi had no sense of shame, and directly pointed out the main point, "This person comes from the Xuan Tian (Profound Heaven) Palace and carries a treasured item of the Xuan Tian Palace, which is why the demon race covets it!"</p><p>A strange color flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>Since he came to the North Sea, the name of Xuan Tian Palace had been like thunder in his ears.</p><p>Monopolizing a territory, the Palace Lord is a Grand cultivator, a colossal entity.</p><p>Now that Senior Sister and Old Demon Ye have ascended, there is still no Grand cultivator stationed in Bei Chen (North Star) Territory. The experts of the Xuan Tian Palace alone are enough to overwhelm the entire Bei Chen Territory.</p><p>Even in the North Sea, the Xuan Tian Palace is the universally acknowledged first power of the human race!</p><p>The white-robed man actually came from the Xuan Tian Palace, crossed the ocean, appeared near the Crescent Moon Territory, and possessed a treasure of the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>No wonder these Demon Kings and Nascent Souls were so crazy.</p><p>Once this news spread, I am afraid that the experts of the Crescent Moon Territory will not be able to sit still.</p><p>Thoughts flashed rapidly in his mind, Qin Sang suddenly slashed out a sword fiercely at the Frogfish, and with a flick of his sleeve, the demonic fire (devil fire) was unleashed without reservation, turning the half of the sky into a sea of fire, burning the mountain peaks, his target actually Bi Fang.</p><p>Bi Fang was exasperated and wanted to curse Qin Sang loudly.</p><p>However, after feeling the power of the demonic fire, Bi Fang's heart tightened, and he could not help but be horrified.</p><p>During the sea battle just now, this person did not use his full strength, and still had reservations.</p><p>If he had used his full strength to control the demonic fire to stop him at that time, even if he used this blood flame transformation divine ability, I am afraid it would not have been so easy to escape!</p><p>The demonic fire pressed over.</p><p>Bi Fang's figure was shrouded in shadow, raising its head and letting out a long howl.</p><p>The howling was like thunder, deafening.</p><p>Bi Fang had been maintaining the form of a blood flame divine bird. Under the pressure of the demonic fire, it completely erupted, displaying another transformation of the divine ability. The blood flame actually began to shrink inward, turning into blood-colored crystal feathers.</p><p>Covered in blood flame feathers, Bi Fang was like an arrow shot from a bow, as if it had the momentum to penetrate the void, and charged into the demonic fire with a bang!</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The Frogfish forcibly withstood Qin Sang's sword, and a large piece of fish scales on its body shattered, but they were only some skin injuries. It ignored other battlefields, with only the white-robed man in its eyes.</p><p>Feng Shangshi was overjoyed when he saw that Qin Sang had been persuaded by him, and his figure was like the wind, rushing to the front.</p><p>At this time, the closest to the white-robed man were Feng Shangshi and the Frogfish.</p><p>In the midst of the battle, the human and the demon looked at each other.</p><p>Feng Shangshi snorted coldly, ignored the Frogfish, and prepared to leave the white-robed man behind first, so as to prevent this person from having any other tricks, and to avoid accidents as time went on.</p>
