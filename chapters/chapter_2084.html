<h1>Chapter 2075: Refining the Void - Mid-Stage</h1><p>Somewhere in the East Sea.</p><p>Dark clouds filled the sky, and demonic Qi surged towards the heavens.  Amidst the demonic Qi, ranks of fully armored demon soldiers patrolled back and forth, their killing intent palpable.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu arrived quietly, standing amidst the clouds. Li Yufu released a wisp of his spiritual essence. Moments later, a subtle ripple appeared within the demonic Qi below, and a burly figure flashed before them, letting out a hearty laugh.</p><p>"If Sect Master Li has any instructions, sending a message talisman would suffice. Why the trouble... uh..."</p><p>The newcomer was none other than the Great Sage Black Lion, now the Lion King.  He had only sensed Li Yufu's aura within his cave dwelling and hadn't expected another person.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, the Lion King froze, his eyes widening like bronze bells. Quickly regaining his composure, he rolled in the clouds, transforming into his black lion form and prostrating himself at Qin Sang's feet, roaring,</p><p>"This humble demon pays respects to Master!"</p><p>This series of actions flowed smoothly, leaving Li Yufu in awe, marveling at the adaptability of the Lion King.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Li Yufu, the Lion King was drenched in cold sweat, immensely grateful for his wise decision years ago to leave the Green Goat Sect and never antagonize them, maintaining a semblance of past loyalty.</p><p>His large, furry head nearly buried itself in the clouds, practically wanting to rub against Qin Sang's feet, his tone fawning, "This humble one knew that Master, blessed by fortune, would certainly..."</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted the Lion King, a flash of spiritual light pushing him back. "Since Yufu has undone the restrictions on you, you are no longer this poor Daoist's mount.  Considering your relatively peaceful conduct these years, this poor Daoist will not make things difficult for you.  Continue being your Lion King."</p><p>Hearing that Qin Sang no longer considered him his mount, the Lion King's heart initially fluttered with unease before finally settling down. Transforming back into his human form, he bowed deeply to Qin Sang, still addressing him as Master.</p><p>"Thank you for your leniency, Master!"</p><p>He then added, "Without Master and Fairy Liu Li, there would be no me today.  If Master has any commands, this humble one will do his utmost to fulfill them."</p><p>"You're quite astute."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "What is your standing within the demon race?"</p><p>The Lion King understood that Qin Sang was asking about the entire demon race, not just the East Sea. Several speculations arose in his mind. His eyes shifted, and he began to complain, "Master, you are discerning.  All demon races under heaven know that this humble one is closer to the human race, closer to the Green Goat Sect. They have always been wary of me, openly and covertly, excluding me from every important discussion.  Those fellows from the Demon Sea are even more hostile towards me.  If not for the need to contact Sect Master Li through me, the Dragon Whale King would have likely driven me out of the East Sea long ago!"</p><p>He painted himself as utterly miserable.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, knew that with the Lion King's diplomatic nature, his situation wouldn't be too bad anywhere.</p><p>"This poor Daoist is just passing through. Today, I only wished to see an old acquaintance. There might be tasks for you in the future, but there's no need to make it known for now."</p><p>"This humble one understands!"</p><p>The Lion King bowed formally.  Suddenly, his vision blurred, and Qin Sang and Li Yufu vanished without a trace. Only then did he relax.</p><p>He gently rubbed his chin, a thoughtful expression on his face. Although Qin Sang hadn't given any specific orders, it wasn't difficult to guess his intentions. It would be best to start making arrangements and preparations.</p><p>By handling matters flawlessly and pleasing Master, not only could he dispel any lingering resentment, but he would undoubtedly receive rewards.</p><p>Thinking of this, the Lion King glanced towards his cave dwelling, a sneer appearing on his face. That was where one of the Dragon Whale King's palaces was located, deliberately built near his own territory.</p><p>...</p><p>Disregarding Liu Li, the Central Continent remained the most powerful among all the regions. The Tri-Sect Alliance formed by the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, the Eight Sceneries View, and the Skyhawk Tower hadn't disbanded but had instead strengthened their ties. Other factions in the Central Continent could only look up to them.</p><p>Among these Central Continent experts, the ones Qin Sang had the most contact with and was most familiar with were the current Mountain Lord of Mount Bu Nian, Lu Zhang, and the Poison King of the Myriad Poison Mountain.</p><p>It was said that the Poison King had survived the Heavenly Tribulation by relying on the sect's sacred artifact, the corpse of a Five Transformations Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit Insect. However, the sacred artifact was destroyed in the process, shielding him from the disaster.  Now, while the Myriad Poison Mountain still held a sinister image in the eyes of the world, its power was gradually waning.</p><p>Qin Sang only had a general understanding of the Central Continent's situation and hadn't met with anyone. The reason was that the Central Continent was complex, requiring careful consideration.</p><p>Several major sects in the Central Continent, especially the three Buddhist, Daoist, and Demonic sects, had produced ascended cultivators, even more than one. Any day, those ascended individuals from the past might come looking.</p><p>Qin Sang was accustomed to leaving a way out and wouldn't sever these sects' lineages.  Allowing their continued existence was also due to this consideration. Otherwise, if the ascended individuals discovered their lineages were broken, he would needlessly gain an enemy.</p><p>Of course, if the ascended individuals wanted to take their descendants away, Qin Sang wouldn't stop them.  Perhaps he could even gain an ally. But if they had any designs on the Storm Realm, a confrontation would still be unavoidable.</p><p>Crossing the Central Continent, they arrived at the former edge of the storm. The magma and flames were gone, replaced by a vibrant and fertile land.</p><p>From the Central Continent to the Western Lands was a continuous landmass. After relocating, the Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea were placed south of this landmass, between the Central Continent and the Western Lands.</p><p>The Central Continent landmass now, from west to east, consisted of the Western Lands humans, the Demon Sea demons, the Boundless Sea humans, the Witch Clan, and the Central Continent humans.</p><p>This arrangement was carefully considered. Since the Long Right Clan army couldn't bypass the defenses and attack silently from the north of the landmass, the primary defense was against attacks from the south. Placing them here also meant they would form a long defensive line, guarding this area.</p><p>The demon race and the Witch Clan were separated by the Boundless Sea humans, preventing them from colluding secretly.  At the same time, being sandwiched between the human races meant that any unusual activity would be noticed.</p><p>The leader of the Witch Clan was still Old Devil Fang.</p><p>Old Devil Fang, with his soul residing in an insect body, shouldn't have been able to cultivate without hindrance, yet he had actually broken through to the Nascent Soul realm.  Qin Sang was somewhat surprised by this.</p><p>During their time in the Boundless Sea, the Witch Clan, unable to contend with the human race, could only retreat to the Witch God Continent. The Long Right Clan's attack was another significant blow. Among the three races, the Witch Clan was the weakest, but they were the most united. Over ninety percent of their people were concentrated in one place, centered around Witch God Mountain.</p><p>Within the Witch Clan, Old Devil Fang's prestige was unparalleled, and his commands were absolute.</p><p>As long as Old Devil Fang was persuaded, the Witch Clan would be the easiest to deal with.</p><p>Qin Sang kept the Witch Clan around because he still had use for them. Both he and the Celestial Eye Butterfly were about to break through, getting closer and closer to the Body Integration stage. Before breaking through to Body Integration, he definitely needed to find the Ghost Mother and seek the secret technique to help the Celestial Eye Butterfly transform.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang didn't go to see Old Devil Fang but only visited the Four Saints Palace and met with Palace Master Bao Zhengnan.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace's position was increasingly unstable. Firstly, they were sandwiched between the Witch Clan and the demon race, with whom they had a blood feud. Secondly, after relocating here, the righteous and demonic paths, originally suppressed by the Four Saints Palace, along with remnants of the three merchant alliances, had become restless, secretly connecting with forces in the Central Continent, each harboring their own agendas.</p><p>The Central Continent forces didn't fear the Four Saints Palace. Bao Zhengnan was powerless to stop them and had sensed the crisis early on.</p><p>Because of this, the Four Saints Palace, like the Profound Heaven Palace, firmly stood by Liu Li and the Green Goat Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang's arrival gave Bao Zhengnan reassurance.</p><p>With the Four Saints Palace and the Profound Heaven Palace cooperating with him, it was sufficient. Too many people knowing would only complicate matters.</p><p>"Palace Master Bao, there's no need to see me off. This poor Daoist will visit again another day," Qin Sang bid farewell with a cupped-hand salute and continued westward.</p><p>...</p><p>The Western Lands.</p><p>The Great Compassion Zen Temple's gate had been reduced to scorched earth.</p><p>Back then, the Western Lands had also suffered fierce attacks.  Master Huaiyin had led the Western Lands cultivators in a strategic retreat, abandoning most of the Western Lands and falling back to the teleportation formation. With support from the Central Continent, they held the Long Right Clan back here. (Last time, I mistakenly stated that it was Master Xingji of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery who fell during the Heavenly Tribulation.)</p><p>The situation remained the same. The two sides were at a standstill in the Western Lands, which had become one of the most devastated battlefields, reduced to ruins.</p><p>Standing on a sand dune, Qin Sang looked out at the Long Right Clan army opposite him, feeling a wave of ferocious煞 energy wash over him.</p><p>With this, he had essentially toured all the major regions of the Storm Realm and had a clear picture in his mind.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang slowly turned and, summoning his escaping light, returned to Deer Wilderness.</p><p>Sensing his return, Si Lu emerged from his meditation chamber.</p><p>Ji Hong was nowhere to be seen, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Si Lu had been healing his injuries and stabilizing his foundation. He had only suppressed his injuries previously, and complete recovery required a period of recuperation.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a cupped-hand salute. "The time is about right. This poor Daoist can't leave for a while, so I'll have to trouble fellow Daoist to make a trip and bring Su Nu and the others back."</p><p>Si Lu simply agreed and departed without hesitation.</p><p>After seeing Si Lu off, Qin Sang ordered the relocation of Deer Wilderness. After drifting eastward for a while, they stopped above a vast expanse of mountains and wilderness.</p><p>The vast land was crisscrossed by rivers.</p><p>Towering peaks and undulating mountain ranges stretched as far as the eye could see, like dragons and snakes slithering across the landscape.</p><p>This place was located west of the Northern Wasteland of the Central Continent and was originally within the storm zone.</p><p>Due to the extremely treacherous terrain, no mortals had been willing to migrate here, and it remained uninhabited.</p><p>After the Storm Realm returned to the Great Thousand World, spiritual Qi revived, but its concentration varied in different locations. The Central Continent remained the area with the richest spiritual Qi, a true cultivation paradise.</p><p>Nourished by the world's spiritual Qi, even the desolate Northern Wasteland had transformed into a land of beautiful mountains and clear waters. The Nine Calamities of the Northern Wasteland had vanished, and the demonic sects of the Central Continent were living comfortably.</p><p>This place was not much different. Its impressive scenery clearly indicated it was a blessed land with immortal mountains.  The Green Goat Sect had a branch sect established here.</p><p>However, the spiritual veins here were too dispersed, and the spiritual energy was chaotic. To establish a sect, one had to relocate the spiritual veins and reorder the spiritual energy.  This was undoubtedly a massive undertaking that smaller sects couldn't afford. Since it was already occupied by the Green Goat Sect, larger sects were unwilling to compete with them, so it remained deserted.</p><p>Li Yufu had claimed this place, considering that Deer Wilderness was only a temporary measure. After the Green Goat Sect expanded, it would definitely need to re-establish its main sect, and this place was one of the options.</p><p>"From now on, the Green Goat Sect's main sect will be here!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the land, his words final.</p><p>Li Yufu bowed in acknowledgement and returned to Deer Wilderness, summoning the sect's disciples and issuing a series of commands.</p><p>Qin Sang stood quietly in place, his divine sense spreading out, sweeping across countless mountains and rivers, penetrating the ground, bringing every spiritual vein into his perception, reaching the minutest details, extending into the endless distance.</p><p>An image formed in his mind. Even the smallest spiritual veins were reflected within it. Countless spiritual veins were first dispersed and then reorganized time and time again.</p><p>Qin Sang devoted himself to his deductions, losing track of how many times he reorganized them, still dissatisfied.</p><p>If it were just for establishing a sect, it wouldn't require so much trouble. However, he also wanted to build the main altar of the Thunder Hall here.</p><p>He chose this location, firstly because it was considered the center of the entire Storm Realm, and secondly, it could deter the Central Continent factions. Future Green Goat Sect disciples wouldn't lack opponents.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed before Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He finally stopped his deductions, a hint of fatigue in his eyes.</p><p>Li Yufu had been waiting patiently beside him for a long time. Qin Sang took out a blank jade slip, inscribed the results of his deductions onto it, and instructed, "Relocate the spiritual veins according to this. You can start setting up the first layer of the protective formation. Entrust the refining of this part of the formation artifacts to Shen Chen."</p><p>Li Yufu's divine sense probed into the jade slip.  Seeing the protective formation, he felt it was incredibly complex, experiencing slight dizziness when he tried to comprehend it.  He couldn't help but feel both shocked and delighted.</p><p>Just the first layer of the protective formation was superior to any sect in the Storm Realm. What kind of power would the complete formation possess!</p><p>He didn't know that Qin Sang had integrated formations like the Heavenly River Reverse Slaughter Formation into it, far surpassing anything the small Storm Realm could compare to.</p><p>This wasn't just the Green Goat Sect's main sect; it would also be his future cultivation ground, so it had to be perfect.</p><p>This was enough to keep the Green Goat Sect busy for a while. Qin Sang instructed Li Yufu to withdraw.  Not rushing to do anything else, he flew alone into the North Sea, landing on a deserted island and setting up formation flags around it.</p><p>During his travels throughout the Storm Realm, Qin Sang hadn't neglected his cultivation.</p><p>During this time, his comprehension of the sacred statue's divine intent deepened, and he sensed a faint stirring within him.</p><p>He realized that this might be an opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p>The spiritual power obtained from the Witch Clan's incantation was also almost completely refined. Once his foundation was completely stabilized, he could attempt to break through to the mid-stage of Refining the Void!</p><p>After setting up the restrictive formation, Qin Sang released the Vermilion Bird and the two demon marquises to stand guard around him.</p><p>He sat down cross-legged, sinking into meditation, his aura only occasionally fluctuating slightly.</p><p>The island was peaceful.</p><p>Gradually, even the slight fluctuations disappeared. Qin Sang felt the last trace of disharmony within him smooth out, indicating that he had completely absorbed the Witch Clan's incantation!</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A fierce wind suddenly arose as Qin Sang devoured the world's spiritual Qi with a voracious appetite, gradually pushing his cultivation to its peak.</p><p>After another period of stillness, Qin Sang had completely sorted out his own Dao and could attempt the breakthrough!</p><p>He awakened the Celestial Eye Butterfly to assist him. Soon, a slight fluctuation appeared on his body, vanishing in an instant, then reappearing.  This repeated continuously, and with each appearance, the fluctuation grew stronger.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird and the two demon marquises had been keeping watch, and sensing the anomaly, they all looked over.</p><p>In an instant, the world's spiritual Qi erupted, surging towards the small island. The void here seemed to have been punctured, the speed of absorption so terrifying that a massive spiritual Qi vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the Vermilion Bird and the others vaguely saw a shadowy figure within the spiritual Qi vortex, which was Qin Sang's Dharma Body!</p><p>Qin Sang was completely oblivious to everything. He felt that there was only a thin membrane ahead. As long as he charged through it with all his might, a brand new world awaited him.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The clouds dispersed, and the vortex vanished abruptly, seemingly swallowed instantly by the shadowy figure. The Dharma Body stood firm in the void, its entire body radiating with multicolored light, which then vanished in a flash, returning to normal and merging back into his main body.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.  He had finally broken through to the mid-stage of Refining the Void! (End of Chapter)</p>
