<h1>Chapter 1477: Breakthrough (4k)</h1><p>Yinming Earth.</p><p>Yuanyin Water.</p><p>Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang had various spiritual materials laid out before him.</p><p>To prepare for the Spirit Ascension Ceremony, the first step was to refine an altar. Yinming Earth and Yuanyin Water were core components, indispensable.  Combined with the Seven-Colored Spirit Fruit, they would produce a miraculous effect.</p><p>Refining an altar shared similarities with refining artifacts, something Qin Sang was quite adept at.</p><p>He mentally reviewed the method for refining the altar.</p><p>Worried that the overwhelming power of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire might affect the altar's efficacy, Qin Sang decided to use only the Infant Fire. He placed his hands on his knees, palms upward, and the Infant Fire floated out, gathering into a ball before him.</p><p>His gaze swept over all the materials. Without any visible movement from Qin Sang, a clump of something resembling rotten roots spontaneously lifted and fell into the Infant Fire.</p><p>In an instant, the material was engulfed.</p><p>Under the Infant Fire's burning, it didn't melt or turn to ash. Instead, impurities were burned away, refining it until it became as hard as iron.</p><p>One by one, it formed the skeletal frame of the altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang continuously gathered other materials, refining some into liquids, others into powder, continuously merging them into the frame.</p><p>As Qin Sang worked, various colored lights flashed across the frame's surface. Each flash signified the birth of new runes, changing its essence.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>The frame was complete. Qin Sang took a moment to regulate his breath, then continued to refine the altar with other materials.</p><p>Before him, a square altar, narrower at the top and wider at the bottom, gradually took shape. Before activation, it was only the size of an inkstone, a plain, dark-grey black, inconspicuous.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The Infant Fire continued refining the altar.</p><p>Sweat dripped from Qin Sang's brow, his true energy heavily depleted, but he remained oblivious, for this was the crucial moment.</p><p>He intently watched the rotating altar, striving to see every subtle change.</p><p>Finally, the time came.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A piece of Yinming Earth flew into the air. A sharp ‘snap’ sounded as the greyish-white stone shattered, transforming into a cloud of even paler dust.</p><p>Qin Sang worked on two tasks simultaneously: refining the altar while simultaneously changing hand seals, infusing the Yinming Earth with various runes.</p><p>The Yinming Earth soon underwent a strange transformation. White light flickered within the dust, composed of countless tiny points of light, shining brightly.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the Yinming Earth flowed into the altar like a river of light, silently merging within.</p><p>Every part of the altar was infused with the Yinming Earth.</p><p>This wasn't the end.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately drew on a drop of Yuanyin Water. This drop, suspended in Qin Sang's palm, resembled a pearl with a tiny vortex inside.</p><p>He flicked it with a finger, and the Yuanyin Water fell above the altar, slowly dripping.</p><p>At this moment, one could see the fine streams spreading along the altar's surface patterns. Upon contacting the Yinming Earth's power, it underwent further changes, various runes converging to form an extremely mystical pattern on the altar's surface.</p><p>One moment it was mountains and rivers; the next, the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning appeared.</p><p>Behind these phenomena, shadowy insect forms flickered faintly.</p><p>The altar seemed to come alive, radiating a dazzling light that illuminated the entire cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly retracted the Infant Fire, his eyes narrowed as he gazed at the altar.</p><p>Soon, the altar's light faded, and it gently fell into Qin Sang's palm. Qin Sang activated his spiritual sense, carefully examining it for any flaws, then replicated the process to refine two altars in total.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang cultivated to adjust his condition, then, carrying the altars and the spirit insects, quietly departed from the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>According to the Mu Valley Master, the Spirit Ascension Ceremony was quite boisterous; they relied on the sect's protective formation to conceal it.</p><p>Cultivators were common near the Listening Snow Tower, so Qin Sang flew for a while before heading directly out to sea; he'd already selected an island.  With the demons attacking the border, cultivators dared not remain overseas, and those on the island were forced to abandon their caves and flee back to the mainland.</p><p>This island had been occupied by a horde of demonic beasts, making it a chaotic mess.</p><p>Qin Sang eradicated all the demonic beasts, summoned his external avatar to stand guard, then flew to the highest peak at the island's center, where he began his work.</p><p>This location also boasted the island's most concentrated spiritual energy, where the spirit vein lay.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang completed the spirit formation needed for the Spirit Ascension Ceremony. With a raised finger, an altar flew straight towards the formation's eye.</p><p>In mid-air, the altar radiated light, its size swelling rapidly, transforming in the blink of an eye into a massive high platform that landed on the ground.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The mountain trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the altar, surveyed the surroundings, nodded in satisfaction, patted his spirit beast pouch, and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>"Whether you can break through depends on your luck," he murmured, stroking the centipede's back.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede gently rubbed against Qin Sang's finger.  At his urging, its thousand legs moved simultaneously, transforming into a red streak that landed in the center of the altar, where it remained motionless.  It wasn't very intelligent, still quite naive, and didn't understand what its master intended to do.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky. After waiting an hour, the sky had grown completely dark, the moon hanging high. He then sat cross-legged beside the Fire Jade Centipede, closed his eyes, and attempted to communicate with its consciousness.  The centipede wasn't his soul-bound insect; there was always a barrier between them, unlike with his Sky Eye Butterfly. But after eating a Myriad Spirits Fruit, its intelligence had noticeably improved.</p><p>"Let's begin…"</p><p>Qin Sang crushed a Seven-Colored Ganoderma fruit, feeding all the juice to the Fire Jade Centipede while activating the formation and the altar.</p><p>After consuming the fruit, the Fire Jade Centipede's body went limp, as if drunk, swaying unsteadily. However, Qin Sang could sense that its consciousness was clearer than ever before.</p><p>‘嗡!’</p><p>The altar trembled.</p><p>A strange light shot into the sky.</p><p>Around the Fire Jade Centipede, the light formed the shape of a jade bowl, incredibly mystical.  The surrounding environment was also affected by the altar's power.</p><p>The wind picked up!</p><p>Though there were no clouds visible in the high sky, the sound of thunder rumbled faintly.  A violent wind swept across the entire island, bending and breaking plants, leaving everything in disarray.  This wasn't a sea breeze; it was a natural phenomenon caused by the altar drawing in spiritual energy, which flowed continuously towards the altar.</p><p>The altar's light grew increasingly dazzling. The silver moon shone brighter, as if within reach.</p><p>The cool moonlight, along with the spiritual energy, converged into the jade bowl. The light within rippled like water.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the runes flickering on the altar's surface, his eyes gleaming with curiosity. These runes were perfectly integrated, in harmony with nature, giving him a sense of familiarity.  </p><p>Wu tribe runes!</p><p>Moreover, as the runes appeared, the previously indistinct insect-like shadows became increasingly clear. They danced on the altar like the female shaman who performed the ritual dance in Winged Viper Village.  Even though these shadows weren't real, their strange shapes were strangely beautiful and profoundly mysterious.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed a wavering in the Fire Jade Centipede's consciousness.  Unable to be distracted, he focused his mind into the centipede's body to comfort it.</p><p>Under the influence of the altar, the moonlight and spiritual energy, transformed into the 'water' of the jade bowl, extremely pure, gradually filled, submerging the Fire Jade Centipede.  In this process, the centipede's potential was stimulated as it absorbed and endured the energy contained within the 'water', its aura rising.</p><p>This energy had both advantages and disadvantages. While it flowed into the Fire Jade Centipede, it also impacted its consciousness, causing unspeakable pain.  Given the centipede's current level, it wouldn't easily lose itself, but this energy was too vast, a powerful force capable of helping it break through its bottleneck.  However, forcibly stimulating its potential would also affect it.</p><p>If it had been a soul-bound insect, Qin Sang would have had various ways to help it, but now his assistance was limited. He used all his strength to activate the altar, trying to make the power in the jade bowl as gentle as possible, while soothing and calling to the Fire Jade Centipede to prevent its consciousness from dissipating.</p><p>As time passed, the Fire Jade Centipede's aura grew stronger, steadily advancing towards its fourth transformation.</p><p>But Qin Sang's expression turned grave because the centipede's consciousness was becoming increasingly hazy. If it hadn't consumed the Myriad Spirits Fruit, it would have already collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense the Fire Jade Centipede's unwavering determination; it was struggling to persevere. Even an ant has the will to become stronger; it's an instinct, especially for spirit insects.</p><p>Its body curled into a ball, emitting a deep red light, expanding and contracting, unstable and on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious, his mind tense.  He hesitated, risking letting the Fire Jade Centipede persevere a little longer, but ultimately, fate couldn't be defied.</p><p>"Enough,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, forcibly ending the ascension ritual.</p><p>The jade bowl shattered, the energy within exploding outwards, destroying the altar below.</p><p>Qin Sang snatched up the Fire Jade Centipede at the last moment, appearing in the distant void.  The Fire Jade Centipede clung tightly to Qin Sang's finger, letting out a weak cry filled with immense reluctance.</p><p>"Though you didn't break through, you gained much, a kind of opportunity. Just consider it not yet your time, there will always be another chance."</p><p>Qin Sang transmitted his thoughts, soothing the Fire Jade Centipede. This wasn't false; even if the Ascension Ritual failed, the process of stimulating potential and pushing against bottlenecks would bring certain benefits to the spirit insect.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede seemed to understand, its body gradually relaxing as it fell into a deep sleep. Qin Sang put it back into his spirit beast pouch, looked around the island, and found the waves churning, with shadows of demonic beasts appearing from all directions, all drawn by the earlier phenomenon.</p><p>However, these beasts didn't dare approach the island because the external avatar emitted a Nascent Soul-level aura, causing them instinctive fear. Qin Sang quickly erased his traces, withdrew his external avatar, and left.</p><p>Arriving at another island rich in spiritual energy, Qin Sang did the same, setting up a second altar, but summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly instead of the Fat Silkworm. During the previous ascension, Qin Sang had gained some insights.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was inferior to the Fire Jade Centipede, not even his spirit insect; he could barely provide any help or precise control. The Fat Silkworm's endurance was limited, and it wouldn't gain much benefit.  Furthermore, Qin Sang worried that the impact on the Fat Silkworm's consciousness might affect Ya Gu, who had improved significantly thanks to the Fat Silkworm's role. He decided against attempting an ascension for it.</p><p>He sat quietly for over an hour, reflecting on his successes and failures, summarizing lessons learned, before summoning the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>"It's up to you…" Qin Sang whispered gently, his gaze filled with affection, a hint of nervousness in his heart.  The ascension opportunity was only once, and the Sky Eye Butterfly wasn't even at the peak of its early fourth transformation, making the attempt somewhat risky. Its advantage was having consumed two Wanling Fruits, giving it far greater spirituality than its kind. It had undergone two transformations, merging with Azure Luan thunder power; it could not be simply called a spirit insect.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated orthodox Witchcraft techniques, giving him a higher chance of success than cultivators from the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly flew before Qin Sang, its wings gently touching his face, as if reassuring its master, then landed in the center of the altar, spreading its wings.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, no longer hesitating, feeding it a Zhiguo fruit to activate the altar.  Every step went smoothly. The 'water' in the jade bowl condensed much slower than before, because the Sky Eye Butterfly absorbed it far faster than the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The familiar sensation returned. The Sky Eye Butterfly's consciousness began to fluctuate. Qin Sang's heart tightened; he quickly employed his Witchcraft techniques, giving his full support.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly's aura rose steadily; the situation looked promising. Soon, its cultivation was pushed to the peak of the early fourth transformation—a combination of stimulated potential and infused spiritual energy, temporary, reverting unless it broke through the bottleneck.  At this point, the Sky Eye Butterfly was still at ease, far from its limit.</p><p>But the next step was crucial; the impact of the breakthrough would be far greater than before.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’ A ripple spread through the jade bowl; the Sky Eye Butterfly's wings trembled slightly as it began its assault on the bottleneck! Qin Sang used all the techniques he knew, aiding it with all his might, yet he couldn't stop the Sky Eye Butterfly's consciousness from slipping into the abyss. The impact was unlike anything the Fire Jade Centipede had experienced.</p><p>Its body trembled, its wings tightly clasped. Qin Sang could deeply feel its suffering.  Like the Fire Jade Centipede, even though its consciousness was hazy, it remained firm and unyielding.  But this wasn't enough to help it break through.</p><p>Time passed.  The Sky Eye Butterfly's condition worsened, but there was still no sign of a breakthrough.  Qin Sang felt a growing anxiety.  He didn't know when he had opened his eyes, but he stared intently at the Sky Eye Butterfly in the jade bowl. He had done everything he could; now he was like a rope, holding onto the butterfly's consciousness, desperately calling out to it.  He couldn't accept the Sky Eye Butterfly suffering root damage; once it reached its limit, regardless of the outcome, he had to stop.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes grew dim; the Sky Eye Butterfly was nearing its limit, still no sign of dawn.  Then, a sudden change occurred.  The Sky Eye Butterfly's wings suddenly spread wide.</p><p>Was it an illusion? The eyes on its wings seemed to blink.</p><p>‘Crack!’ A lightning bolt suddenly illuminated the jade bowl.  The instant he sensed the lightning, Qin Sang felt a primal, instinctive fear. This lightning contained the true meaning of tribulation thunder, stronger and more real than before.  This was heavenly might, yet appearing on a tiny butterfly.</p><p>"This…" Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.  He saw the tribulation thunder spreading in the jade bowl, countless threads of electricity moving through the 'water'.  The next moment, the tribulation thunder was suddenly drawn into the Sky Eye Butterfly's body, and the 'water' in the bowl seemed to encounter a funnel. The Sky Eye Butterfly drank it dry in an instant!</p><p>‘Boom!’ Thunder and lightning echoed in the sky, harmonizing with the tribulation thunder. The jade bowl and the altar simultaneously collapsed.  The Sky Eye Butterfly, trailing a long phoenix-like tail, took flight, its aura rising rapidly.</p><p>Fourth Transformation, Mid-Stage!</p>
