<h1>Chapter 391: The Magical Treasure</h1><p>A yellow sand banner enveloped the entire ice cave.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, more than 90% of the banner's power surged towards Yu Hua, disrupting his senses, alarming the Flying Horned Dragonfish, and guiding them.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted quickly; with a slight nudge, the Flying Horned Dragonfish immediately found Yu Hua.</p><p>Yu Hua was again attacked by the Flying Horned Dragonfish, but this time he was prepared.</p><p>Furthermore, this group of Flying Horned Dragonfish had been through a battle, suffering heavy losses and battered by the storm, with many injured. They couldn't hold Yu Hua back as effectively as before.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, summoning the corpses to block the front, while simultaneously manifesting a flag in his palm, releasing billowing Yin energy to set up the Ten Directions Yama Array, working against the clock.</p><p>He had considered luring Yu Hua in, using the Flying Night Rakshasa to counterattack, but upon closer thought, it was too difficult. The Flying Night Rakshasa ignored the corpses, not him.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Hua could sense his location through the Heart-Eating Insects.</p><p>Using corpses to lure Yu Hua while hiding himself was also impossible.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner was powerful, and he also had the Flying Horned Dragonfish assisting. All he needed was the chance to set up the formation; he shouldn't resort to desperate measures unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A lightning bolt pierced the yellow sand, hurtling towards him. Yu Hua, sensing Qin Sang through the Heart-Eating Insects, used the same tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang released the corpses precisely to counter Yu Hua's sneak attack. The corpses were weak; using them to stall Yu Hua would only lead to the same fate as the Soul Binding Rope and the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>The stagnant corpse suddenly opened its eyes, grabbed Qin Sang, and swiftly dodged.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after this sneak attack, Yu Hua made no further move.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised and felt uneasy, but his hands didn't stop. The Ten Directions Yama Banner spun rapidly around him, the formation taking shape.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Wind and sand mixed with Yin energy, creating a dim scene.  The Ten Directions Yama Array was finally complete!</p><p>Ten ghostly banners stood tall, revolving slowly around Qin Sang, Yin threads floating.</p><p>Qin Sang, exhausted, breathed a sigh of relief, but dared not hesitate. He exerted all his strength to activate the Ten Directions Yama Array. Black fire erupted from the Yin threads, forming a spear that pierced the air.</p><p>However, the Yin threads suddenly stopped mid-flight, unable to advance.</p><p>The yellow sand dispersed.</p><p>Seeing what was before him, Qin Sang's heart sank to his stomach.</p><p>Blocking the Yin threads were identical black flames!</p><p>Looking at Yu Hua, he was using the same method to defend against the Flying Horned Dragonfish's attack, except the plasma under the protective barrier was several times thinner.</p><p>Around Yu Hua, Yin energy surged, obscuring his figure.  Intermittently visible within the Yin energy were… Ten Directions Yama Banners!</p><p>Ten of them!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Yu Hua to possess a complete Ten Directions Yama Array!</p><p>At Yuanzhao Gate, from certain details and conversations with Meng Ruhuai and others, Qin Sang had guessed Yu Hua's identity. He wasn't likely a spy planted by the Kuiyin Sect, but rather a disciple of Yuanzhao Gate who, after failing to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, had been tempted by the demonic sect, becoming an inside agent in exchange for opportunities.</p><p>Such a person wouldn't gain Yi Tiannie's trust before the plot was completed, and his status in the Kuiyin Sect wouldn't be high, possibly even lower than Zhao Yan's.</p><p>Through several encounters, Qin Sang observed that Yu Hua always consulted Zhao Yan before making decisions, lacking the demeanor a Foundation Establishment cultivator should exhibit against a Qi Condensation cultivator, confirming his suspicion.</p><p>Logically, he shouldn't have been given so many Ten Directions Yama Banners.  Even Yue Wu, who diligently worked for Yi Tiannie, only had four.</p><p>This situation completely exceeded Qin Sang's expectations, disrupting all his plans.</p><p>Upon discovering the array around Qin Sang, Yu Hua said in surprise, "A complete Ten Directions Yama Array? Even at the Kuiyin Sect's height, few possessed it. No wonder that Zhao Yan kid couldn't beat you! Fortunately, I didn't underestimate you!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Yu Hua, making no reply, exerting all his effort to activate the Ten Directions Yama Array, hoping to divert Yu Hua's attention and provide an opportunity for the Flying Horned Dragonfish.</p><p>His spiritual energy was visibly depleting. The Yin threads couldn't advance, and the Flying Horned Dragonfish couldn't break through the protective barrier.</p><p>Yu Hua fought against two opponents without losing ground but couldn't escape the predicament.</p><p>However, continuing like this wouldn't defeat Yu Hua; instead, Qin Sang would run out of spiritual energy and be unable to maintain the Ten Directions Yama Array.</p><p>The situation was extremely critical, yet Qin Sang remained unprecedentedly calm.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the Ten Directions Yama Banner alone wouldn't defeat Yu Hua.  A resolute look flashed in his eyes. He suddenly struck his dantian, pouring all his spiritual energy from his qi sea into the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>He then swallowed a handful of pills, and retrieved a talisman from his pouch – the silver blade treasure from Luo Xingnan's belongings.</p><p>Fueled by Qin Sang's overexertion, the main spirits of the Ten Directions Yama Formation became incredibly powerful, operating independently.</p><p>Qin Sang's meridians throbbed with excruciating pain, feeling like knives slicing through him.  Despite the agony, he endured, refining the pill's energy to gather some spiritual power before immediately channeling it into the treasure.</p><p>"Faster! Faster!"</p><p>His eyes bloodshot, Qin Sang stared intently at the talisman, its glow intensifying. He urged it silently.</p><p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl.  A single instant felt longer than a previous day.</p><p>Finally, the talisman vibrated slightly, leaving his grasp. It shattered with a ‘pop,’ transforming into a small silver blade.</p><p>In this critical moment, Qin Sang couldn't afford to conserve the blade's power. He unleashed its full might without hesitation.</p><p>He pointed the blade towards Yu Hua, its tip trembling.</p><p>Just as he was about to launch the attack, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Yu Hua was shrouded in a thick miasma, obscuring the view. But as Qin Sang readied the blade, ghostly howls erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the howls – the cries of the Ten Directions Yama Banner's main spirits.  There was no joy, no pain, only the immense pressure forcing involuntary roars.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>He'd used the banner for so long, he understood it intimately; he'd never heard these sounds before.</p><p>"Could there be an unknown aspect to the Ten Directions Yama Formation?"</p><p>As the thought crossed his mind, a violent gust of dark wind swept from Yu Hua's direction, the miasma churning restlessly.  Then, ten ghostly figures of the main spirits slowly emerged.</p><p>Their appearance was horrifyingly grotesque, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen.  Their bodies, translucent and bathed in blood, contained undigested blood clots and a network of crimson veins.  And on their shoulders, they carried a gigantic banner.</p><p>Seeing the banner, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>The true Ten Directions Yama Banner! A genuine magical treasure!</p>
