Chapter 697: The Path

Having learned a lesson from his teleportation ordeal, Qin Sang now kept a small pouch at his waist, filled with a few items to deceive prying eyes.  This was to prevent a repeat of the floating river incident, where his Qianjun Ring was snatched.

Sensing the subtle, lingering gaze behind him disappear, Qin Sang sneered inwardly. He quickly returned to his stone dwelling and meticulously set up several layers of defensive formations.

Holding the bone flute, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment. Finally, he tied a string to it and hung it around his neck, concealing it beneath his inner armor. He dared not let the two sections of the flute touch here. The marketplace was teeming with powerful cultivators; it was not a safe place.  The peculiar power within the flute was linked to the celestial forces of the stars. If the two pieces connected and triggered some phenomenon, it might attract unwanted attention and covetous gazes.

To be safe, Qin Sang suppressed his curiosity, deciding to wait until the trade fair concluded. Over the next two days, Qin Sang frequently strolled around but found no more remarkable treasures.

Qin Sang was startled from his meditation when he felt the restrictions outside his stone dwelling being triggered.  A sweep of his divine sense revealed a marketplace attendant standing outside. Knowing that the trade fair was about to begin, Qin Sang opened the door.

Seeing Qin Sang, the attendant bowed. "Senior, the trade fair is about to commence. I will escort you there now."

Reflecting on his acquisitions of the past few days, Qin Sang walked towards the largest stone dwelling in the inner area.  He had already purchased almost everything he needed. Even without attending the trade fair, he could consider this trip a resounding success.  His primary goal at the trade fair was to inquire about a route through the Thousand Demons Sea.

The Hun Yuan Concentric Ring wasn't essential, but without it, he wouldn't have peace of mind in the demon-infested sea. He could choose to ignore the ring and hunt demons elsewhere for now.  However, the increasing chaos outside Primal Heaven Island indicated that finding a peaceful haven in the already explored sea regions would become increasingly difficult.

Unless the two factions ceased their conflict, he would inevitably be affected sooner or later. At that point, if he wished to avoid being embroiled in the chaos, his only option would be to venture into uncharted waters.  Then, the Hun Yuan Concentric Ring’s value would be undeniable.

Qin Sang had to plan ahead. Of course, if there truly was no way to cross the Thousand Demons Sea, Qin Sang wouldn't force the issue.

Guards stood before the stone dwelling, but upon seeing Qin Sang and the attendant approach, they not only didn't obstruct them but respectfully bowed.

Qin Sang pushed the door open and saw that the vast stone dwelling contained over thirty chairs, most of which were already occupied.

"So many Golden Core cultivators here?"  Qin Sang was inwardly surprised. Glancing around, he recognized several familiar faces – stewards from some of the most renowned trading houses. It turned out that the major trading houses had also sent representatives.

Then, Qin Sang spotted a few other familiar figures. They exchanged nods. Under the scrutiny of several gazes, Qin Sang walked to a corner, found a chair, and sat down, quietly awaiting the start of the trade fair.

Han Cuo wasn't present.  Two days prior, Han Cuo had reportedly exhausted his savings to acquire a long-sought treasure.  He had departed the marketplace early, bidding farewell to Qin Sang.  Before leaving, Han Cuo had hinted at inviting Qin Sang to join his group, but Qin Sang politely declined. He didn't want too many ties with Primal Heaven Island cultivators for now. He and Han Cuo agreed to meet again on the island later.

Qin Sang waited for a quarter of an hour.  A few more people arrived, and the chairs were almost full.

At that moment, an elderly man sitting at the far end, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly stood up, drawing everyone's attention.  In a clear voice, he announced, "Today, I am honored to have so many fellow Daoists gracing us with their presence, including several new faces.  I'm sure you're all eager to begin, so I won't belabor the point. The rules of the trade fair are simple: take turns presenting your treasures, then state your desired terms of exchange. Once a trade is agreed upon, it cannot be reversed. I, though unworthy, can serve as a witness…"

The elder briefly explained the procedure, then sat back down.

Everyone was clearly familiar with the process. They exchanged glances. A female cultivator sitting near the entrance retrieved two items from her pouch and displayed them to everyone. "A demon core and a damaged magical treasure. I seek spiritual water or similar spiritual objects. The terms of exchange are negotiable depending on the value of the spiritual water…"

The magical treasure was clearly damaged in battle, and quite severely, but no one seemed to mind. They all focused their divine senses on the treasure. After a moment, some began to discuss with the female cultivator.

Besides the magical treasure, the demon core belonged to an early Core Formation Black Sha Porpoise.  For a cultivator of her level, hunting such a demon wasn't easy.  Although demons were numerous in the Demon Sea, demon cores remained highly valuable.  Many were interested.

Not everyone was like Qin Sang, able to come and go freely, easily hunting demons of the same rank.

Uninterested in the magical treasure and demon core, Qin Sang sat quietly.

Soon, the female cultivator obtained what she desired, and it was the next person's turn. Time passed, and treasures were presented one after another. Some achieved their goals, while others left disappointed.

Qin Sang hadn't seen anything that piqued his interest until a Thunder Crane demon egg caused a ripple of excitement within him.

Demon eggs were also highly prized treasures here.  Hatching a demon egg and raising the demon oneself, training it into a personal spiritual pet, eliminated the risk of betrayal.  However, raising a spiritual pet was no less challenging than raising spiritual insects.

Qin Sang already had two spiritual insects to care for.  Adding another spiritual pet would demand too much of his attention.  The Hun Yuan Concentric Ring, on the other hand, could directly control a demon, eliminating the need for lengthy training.

There was a reason why the Hun Yuan Concentric Ring required so many exceptionally rare spiritual materials despite its resulting lower-grade ranking.  Much of it had to do with this ability.  It wasn't without reason that the Spirit Controlling Sect regarded it as a secret treasure.

Unfortunately, the Hun Yuan Concentric Ring could only control demons up to the early Core Formation stage. Once Qin Sang reached the late Core Formation stage, this function would become less significant.

After a while, someone unexpectedly offered a Poison Fish demon core.

Qin Sang had been searching for this type of demon core, hoping to see if the Fat Silkworm could devour it, but to no avail.  Finally finding one, he immediately joined the bidding.  After some bargaining, he traded another demon core and a demon corpse for it.

Finally, it was Qin Sang's turn.

Under everyone's gaze, Qin Sang calmly produced three demon cores and a magical treasure.

Seeing Qin Sang present so many demon cores, the gazes directed at him shifted, tinged with apprehension.

"I require Soul-Guiding Grass, Eternal Camphorwood…"  Qin Sang listed several spiritual materials and medicinal pills, then added, "In addition, I'm seeking information on a route through the Thousand Demons Sea. The price is negotiable."

Upon hearing this, everyone's attention shifted from the treasures before Qin Sang, and they looked at him with astonishment.

"Fellow Daoist, are you planning to venture into the Thousand Demons Sea now? Aren't you afraid of being ambushed by the rogue cultivators there?"  someone exclaimed.

Qin Sang chuckled. "I didn't say I'm going now.  Even if things calm down later, that route will likely become treacherous. I have compelling reasons to go in the future, so I must secure an alternative route."
