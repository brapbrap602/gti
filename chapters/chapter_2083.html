<h1>Chapter 2074: The Foul Primordial River</h1><p>Yuan Miao was momentarily stunned.  Previously, Qin Sang had consistently adopted a defensive stance. This was perfectly normal; facing the relentless assault of the Zhu Yan clan, most people could only barely parry blows. It wasn't that they didn't want to counterattack, but they simply didn't have the opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, their opponent had been playing with them all along!</p><p>As the last word left Qin Sang's mouth, the sound echoed almost directly in Yuan Miao's ear.  Only then did Yuan Miao sense the imminent danger. A streak of green lightning appeared in his vision, impossibly fast, seeming to pierce the void in an instant and rush towards him. He reacted instantly, raising his crimson magic staff to his chest.  A powerful impact followed, as if he had been struck by a mountain. His body trembled, and his vision went black.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit tablet, like a massive stone slab, pressed down on him, firmly countered by the crimson staff. The two magical artifacts collided with immense force, causing the fighting platform to shake again. Strange lights flickered across the battlefield.</p><p>Yuan Miao, with his extensive combat experience and sharp spiritual senses, reacted almost instinctively, managing to parry the blow.  Anyone else might not have been defeated outright, but they would likely have lost the initiative instantly.</p><p>He channeled his energy with all his might, forcefully pushing the spirit tablet away with both arms, and retreated to gain some breathing room. However, before he could regain his footing, pressure descended from above.</p><p>With no other choice, Yuan Miao raised his staff to block.</p><p>With a resounding boom, Yuan Miao was slammed to the ground. Though he managed to remain relatively steady, his feet sank deeply into the earth.</p><p>The Zhu Yan clan placed great importance on the fighting platform. It was constructed from an exceptionally hard material, inscribed with powerful restrictive spells, and reinforced by a great formation. Despite the fierce battle, it hadn't suffered a scratch; now, however, it bore two deep footprints.</p><p>Yuan Miao was about to repeat his previous tactic when he felt the spirit tablet yield, only to find a new attack coming from behind.  He had no time to move, so he twisted his staff to deflect the blow.</p><p>The following scene evoked a sense of deja vu in the onlookers, Si Lu and the others. They had just witnessed the same thing, only with the roles reversed.</p><p>Now it was Yuan Miao's turn to be on the receiving end. Facing Qin Sang's relentless onslaught, Yuan Miao could only defend, his feet sinking deeper and deeper into the ground, unable to pull them free as Qin Sang hammered him again and again, his legs practically swallowed by the earth.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Miao felt immense frustration. This was his preferred fighting style, and now his opponent was using it against him.</p><p>Qin Sang's combat skills were even more formidable than he had anticipated.  Having mastery of evasion techniques was one thing, but combining evasion and combat was quite another.</p><p>Especially in a physical confrontation between two cultivators specializing in strength, subtle changes could occur in an instant. No matter how good one's evasion techniques were, they wouldn't always be effective. Misuse could lead to a loss of coordination and expose openings, and this was precisely the opportunity Yuan Miao had been waiting for.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't seem to have such concerns.  He hadn't even used any advanced techniques, relying only on his lightning-fast evasion and the spirit tablet to suppress Yuan Miao.</p><p>Yuan Miao had sensed when Qin Sang used the Vajra Wheel Seal, but he never imagined it possessed such power.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Yuan Miao knew he'd sunk another inch. He felt like a stake, and Qin Sang, the hammer.</p><p>This situation had to change!</p><p>Finding no openings, Yuan Miao decided to create one. His mind shifted, and the blood flames engulfing his body erupted violently.</p><p>He threw his head back, his hair standing on end as he seemed to transform into a raging inferno.</p><p>Points of blood light emerged from the flames, coalescing on his forehead to blossom into a blood flower.  After a strange transformation, this formed a small blood seal that flashed into his brow.</p><p>A low growl echoed across the battlefield, like the roar of a demonic ape from ancient times.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhu Yan warrior heard the roar and felt their hearts pound, their fighting spirits ignited. The Zhu Yan warrior leaped to his feet, scratching his head anxiously, his eyes glued to the fighting platform, wishing he could take Yuan Miao's place.</p><p>Fortunately, he had not lost his senses. He glanced at Ji Hong, his eyes filled with eagerness and a burning desire to fight.</p><p>Sensing danger, Ji Hong quickly hid under Si Lu's collar.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle had shifted. Yuan Miao abruptly opened his eyes, his pupils crimson, radiating a ferocious intent, truly seeming to have become a demonic ape.</p><p>A crimson rod, tipped skyward, pulsed with a fleeting,妖艳 blood-red glow before dissolving into countless afterimages.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  To him, only one crimson rod existed, hurtling directly towards his face.</p><p>The attack was unnervingly precise.  How had Yuan Miao achieved this? Had he anticipated Qin Sang's position, or was this strike inevitable, regardless of Qin Sang's location?</p><p>The rod was already upon him, leaving no room for evasion.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang abandoned his offensive, his phoenix wings beating hard, pulling him from the fray.</p><p>A fierce gust of wind sliced past him. Yuan Miao had missed, but his goal was accomplished.  He launched himself from the pit, cartwheeling in mid-air, ready to counterattack.</p><p>Faced with the crimson rod again, Qin Sang retreated, this time to create distance.  Then, like a streak of lightning, he reappeared at Yuan Miao's side, using a cunning angle.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Their weapons clashed, sending tremors through both men. Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  Yuan Miao seemed far more composed now. Suppressing him as before, before the blood-mark’s power faded, would be impossible.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s afterimage shattered under the rod, he reappeared elsewhere, his spirit-tablet flashing once more.</p><p>Their battle raged, no longer confined to a single spot.  Their figures darted across the entire arena.  Were it not for the arena's boundary, their fight would have surely extended into the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his aggressive yet evasive tactics, but his strategy had shifted.  He no longer sought to overpower his opponent, instead maximizing his escape techniques while searching for openings.</p><p>Yuan Miao matched him blow for blow.  He might not be able to catch Qin Sang, but Qin Sang would always return to attack. By perfectly timing his defenses, Yuan Miao rendered Qin Sang's skill useless.</p><p>On the north side of the main arena stood a smaller, slightly lower peak, with its own smaller arena.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the combatants, this arena's barrier had also been deactivated, revealing a lone figure.</p><p>Clad in white robes, this individual possessed golden eyes, his gaze piercing the air with a golden light as he stood, arms behind his back.</p><p>The barrier was no match for his gaze. He observed the duel with a strange, intense focus.</p><p>Unnoticed by Qin Sang and Yuan Miao, both locked in their intense struggle, neither gained a decisive advantage, but both continued their search for an opening.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Another clash, mirroring countless others.  They separated.</p><p>Then, Yuan Miao's eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>The opportunity!</p><p>Finally!</p><p>At the same moment, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable shift, a sense of something amiss. He glanced at Yuan Miao, who, bathed in blood-flame, appeared unchanged, yet that unsettling feeling persisted.</p><p>He was certain the blood-flames had altered, but couldn’t understand how.</p><p>The next moment, his eyes widened in shock.  Two new heads, identical to Yuan Miao's, had sprouted from his back.  They came with arms and even the crimson rod had tripled.</p><p>"Three heads, six arms?"</p><p>The legendary technique was before him at last.</p><p>The new limbs were somewhat translucent, not yet fully solidified, but Yuan Miao's power had undeniably reached a new level.</p><p>*Swish swish swish!*</p><p>Three rods descended upon Qin Sang, allowing him no time for reflection.</p><p>Three streaks of blood-red light tore through the air, each potent enough to shatter mountains, before coalescing into a single, devastating blow.</p><p>The looming shadow of the rod engulfed the entire arena. Nothing could escape its destructive force. Even Qin Sang’s unparalleled escape techniques seemed useless.</p><p>The rod hurtled towards him.  Qin Sang’s expression hardened as he formed a hand seal, instantly summoning a golden light that formed a golden sun behind his head.</p><p>The Sun Seal, a secret technique of the Buddhist Vajrayana school, fundamentally manifested the physical body as a weapon. But Qin Sang, a master of both body and spirit, had taken its power to new heights.</p><p>Even without utilizing his divine body, the raw power of his cultivation amplified this seal's force.</p><p>The golden sun shone, repelling the encroaching blood-red energy.</p><p>Yuan Miao felt a sudden, chilling premonition, but his attack was unstoppable.  The outcome now rested on their skills.</p><p>The golden sun met the crimson rod, their immense power colliding.</p><p>Wow!</p><p>A blinding wave of golden light swept across the entire arena, engulfing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao, Jin Ri, and the magic staff.  The arena was bathed in a brilliant golden glow.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson staff shadow suddenly appeared at the heart of the golden light, looking like a crack in Jin Ri itself.  Suddenly, both Jin Ri and the staff shadow shattered. The remaining energy was still immense, with waves continuously impacting the protective barrier.</p><p>Only a transparent barrier separated the viewing platform from the main barrier.  Under the impact of the residual energy, the barrier trembled, seemingly on the verge of collapse, with the golden energy threatening to burst forth.</p><p>Ji Hong shrank his small head into Si Lu's collar, and the Zhu Yan warrior shrunk his neck, his fighting spirit completely gone.</p><p>The powerful residual energy lingered, yet booming sounds echoed from within, clearly indicating the battle had resumed.</p><p>Yuan Miao, still in his three-headed, six-armed form, wielded the magic staff flawlessly, giving Qin Sang no opportunity, but he couldn't subdue Qin Sang either.</p><p>After a few more exchanges, Yuan Miao suddenly retracted his divine powers, leaped out of the combat circle, and shouted, "No more! No more!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  His spirit tablet returned to the size of his palm, his phoenix wings folded, and he slowly landed on the ground.</p><p>"I can't hurt you, but you could hurt me!  Consider this a win for you! No more! No more!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his hands repeatedly, looking somewhat dejected.</p><p>It was true that if the fight continued, neither would likely prevail.  However, as he said, Qin Sang could potentially injure him, and he hadn't found a way to counter Qin Sang's escape technique.  Therefore, saying he was slightly inferior wasn't unreasonable.</p><p>The Zhu Yan tribe were warriors, but once they recognized the situation, they accepted defeat or victory without pointless struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, "Daoist friend, you have my respect."</p><p>He had hidden his strength, but this certainly wasn't all of Yuan Miao's power; some techniques were simply unsuitable for use in the arena, as this wasn't a fight to the death.</p><p>"I'll find a way to counter your escape technique eventually!" Yuan Miao grumbled, still unconvinced.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, he didn't dislike this temperament. He bowed, "I await your next challenge, Daoist friend."</p><p>"You just wait!"</p><p>Yuan Miao issued a threat, waved his sleeve, and dispelled the spirit array.</p><p>Si Lu flew over, looking at Qin Sang with a hint of amazement.  He knew Qin Sang's strongest ability was his dharma body, yet he had defeated Yuan Miao using only physical strength and divine powers.</p><p>Ji Hong's eyes shone brightly, his small face full of admiration, "Qin Guard, you're so strong!"</p><p>"I'll keep my word.  Except for a few forbidden areas of our tribe, the three of you may come and go freely; no one will trouble you..."</p><p>Yuan Miao flicked his sleeve, sending out three streams of light that transformed into three jade pendants.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend Yuan."</p><p>Feeling Yuan Miao's energy on the jade pendants, the three bowed their thanks and each kept one.</p><p>Yuan Miao looked towards the mountain pass, "Let's be clear, there are still dangerous places near our tribe, even nearby tribes rarely dare to approach. If you venture in and die, don't blame others."</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, we understand the dangers," Si Lu bowed.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, Yuan Miao knew they hadn't taken his warning seriously. He snorted, "Don't think I'm exaggerating. Our tribe is unlike others. To the east, there's a place where foul energy gathers—avoid it at all costs."</p><p>Ji Hong and Si Lu hadn't reacted yet, but Qin Sang's eyes flashed, "Foul energy?"</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded, "The origin of this energy is unknown.  It corrupts everything it touches, leaving nothing unaffected. It's extremely dangerous for cultivators like us. It fluctuates; don't be fooled by its apparent calm. Once the foul energy surges, it devours everything. Even powerful cultivators might not survive!"</p><p>Corrupts everything, leaves nothing unaffected...</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt the foul energy resembled the Six Heavenly Malignant Qi from the River of Woe.</p><p>Having been in the Great Thousand World for so long, Qin Sang had traveled through several celestial states but hadn't heard any rumors of the River of Woe.</p><p>He suspected the River of Woe existed in another form, usually hidden from the world, invisible to ordinary people, detectable only by powerful cultivators.</p><p>Could this be a manifestation of the River of Woe?</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the Storm World's Abyss might be located on the River of Woe. If the Storm World appeared and was expelled by the River of Woe, it makes sense for it to end up here.</p><p>"I've said all I need to. Please do as you wish!"</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his sleeve, gesturing for them to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged glances, unwilling to press further, and bowed their farewells.</p><p>After the three figures disappeared into the mountains, Yuan Miao withdrew his gaze, looked towards a nearby peak, flickered, and vanished into it, asking, "When did you arrive, Brother Yuan?"</p>
