<h1># Chapter 1437: The Beginning of the Grand Assembly</h1><p>After activating the Dan Cauldron Token on Pearl Island, Qin Sang soon met Real Person Yinquan.</p><p>Real Person Yinquan sized up Qin Sang, feeling that he was somewhat different from four months ago, but couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.</p><p>He would never have imagined that refining a single Hidden Fragrance Pill could allow Qin Sang's divine sense to manifest.</p><p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>"There are indeed rumors that Old Demon Hunmo is seeking certain items, said to be all related to the Demonic Path; we have not yet obtained definite news,"</p><p>Real Person Yinquan said without reservation, his tone somewhat grave.</p><p>The more anxious Old Demon Hunmo became, the greater the benefit would be upon success.</p><p>Perhaps, in the future, Old Demon Hunmo would be the number one person in the North Sea.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt even more justified in his consideration of the mysterious Ice Box. Having already offended Old Demon Hunmo, he shouldn't antagonize Xuantian Palace as well.</p><p>For Old Demon Hunmo and the Palace Lord of Xuantian Palace, the storm belt was not an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p>But he was not alone.</p><p>Thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he said cautiously, "I plan to participate in the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly, if only to broaden my horizons; I also have three ancient formulas in my possession…"</p><p>Real Person Yinquan's eyes lit up. Hearing that Qin Sang was willing to sell the pill formulas, he was overjoyed and said, "Fellow Daoist's decision is correct; only our Dan Cauldron Mountain is interested in such ancient formulas, can afford them, and is willing to offer a price that will satisfy Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>These sects that specialize in alchemy are indeed wealthy!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly and asked, "Real Person should also be participating, right? After all, it is a gathering of demons; Qin is somewhat uneasy. I wonder what backup plans Dan Cauldron Mountain has arranged for Real Person to guard against accidents?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Real Person Yinquan frowned.</p><p>Before he could speak, Qin Sang said, "To be frank, Qin has some enemies and is worried about running into them at the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly. I would like to borrow the power of Dan Cauldron Mountain to guard against any unforeseen events. After the Assembly, even if nothing happens, Qin will still offer the ancient formulas. If trouble arises, the reward can be negotiated separately. I believe Dan Cauldron Mountain wouldn't collude with those demons."</p><p>Qin Sang himself had sufficient strength and confidence.</p><p>He would also leave his own backup plans.</p><p>Dan Cauldron Mountain was only a last resort, a precaution, and most likely wouldn't be needed.</p><p>Real Person Yinquan understood Qin Sang's intention, pondered for a long time, and smiled, "Just helping Fellow Daoist escape is enough? This poor Daoist doesn't know whether to hope Fellow Daoist encounters danger or not."</p><p>For him, being able to befriend a Core Formation middle stage cultivator, and one who seems to possess many ancient formulas, was worthwhile even without a reward.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and laughed heartily, "Real Person is not afraid of attracting demons because of me?"</p><p>"Do they dare to attack Dan Cauldron Mountain?"</p><p>Real Person Yinquan chuckled and then thoughtfully said, "Fellow Daoist's words remind me; I will make arrangements!"</p><p>Next, Qin Sang exchanged all the unused items in the Thousand Jun Ring for spirit stones, preparing to give them to Tan Hao to participate in the auction in the next few days.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Pearl Island, with a more intricate Dan Cauldron Token in his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>…</p><p>Hunmo Island.</p><p>Thanks to Old Demon Hunmo's reputation, Hunmo Island can be called the most famous island in the boundless sea today.</p><p>Hunmo Island is vast.</p><p>Unlike other Core Formation cultivators, who use great formations to seal off the islands where their caves are located, forbidding outsiders from entering,</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo only occupied a piece of immortal mountain in the northern part of Hunmo Island, shrouded in a sea of clouds, as his Daoist site. The rest of the area was open to cultivators and mortals, and there were many bustling cities on the island.</p><p>No one knows Old Demon Hunmo's lineage.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo did not establish a sect, and the number of his disciples was small, similar to rogue cultivators.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly was held in the largest city on Hunmo Island, and the name of this city was changed to Ten Thousand Demons City when the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly was first held.</p><p>Ten Thousand Demons City was bustling with activity.</p><p>The streets were crowded with people.</p><p>Cultivators were no longer a rare sight here. Golden Core cultivators could be encountered from time to time, and even Nascent Soul Ancestors could occasionally be seen.</p><p>Many low-level cultivators also came to join in the fun, or to broaden their horizons with their elders. Fortunately, the city was large enough, or it might not have been able to accommodate so many cultivators.</p><p>On every street, there were guards in armor, radiating baleful aura, patrolling back and forth, their eyes filled with killing intent, like killing machines, making people shudder.</p><p>No matter how unruly a cultivator was, they wouldn't dare to cause trouble here.</p><p>If friction occurred, they would at most argue a few words, and upon noticing the gazes of those guards, they would tacitly disperse.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly had not yet begun, but private trade fairs were already being held in the corners of the city.</p><p>At this time, a burly figure walked into the city.</p><p>It was Tan Hao.</p><p>He did not completely conceal his aura. The people in front sensed the Core Formation aura and changed their expressions, subconsciously making way for him.</p><p>Tan Hao sensed the fearful gazes around him and remained indifferent, without any emotion of self-satisfaction.</p><p>Thinking of the junior apprentice brother who had joined the Kuiyin Sect with him, who was now a Core Formation middle stage expert, daring to snatch food from the mouths of Great Cultivators, no one could be proud.</p><p>Tan Hao pressed the Mustard Seed Pouch at his waist.</p><p>It was filled with spirit stones.</p><p>The map of Ten Thousand Demons City appeared in his mind, and Tan Hao strode forward, turned a few streets, and came to a magnificent wooden building, quickly walking inside.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly would begin in three days.</p><p>The most important auctions would be held here, and they would be held separately according to the value and type of the treasures.</p><p>Not long after, Tan Hao walked out of the wooden building and wandered around the city again. According to his past experience, he contacted various large and small trade fairs, seeking the things that he and Qin Sang needed.</p><p>Soon, three days had passed.</p><p>The atmosphere in Ten Thousand Demons City became increasingly lively. Countless cultivators gathered in the city, and strong cultivators, rarely seen on ordinary days, frequently appeared. Those fierce guards also felt the pressure and dared not relax for a moment.</p><p>The first auction was about to begin.</p><p>Tan Hao wore a hood and returned to the wooden building, looking up at it.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly had not yet begun, but he had already bought several kinds of spiritual objects that Qin Sang had named. If he was lucky, it shouldn't be difficult to collect them all.</p><p>Stepping inside, Tan Hao did not conceal his cultivation.</p><p>Immediately, a charming girl came up, her expression respectful, and asked a few questions in a low voice, then led Tan Hao up the stairs.</p><p>Strangely, as soon as he stepped on the stairs, the light suddenly dimmed.</p><p>The stairs seemed endless. Tan Hao patiently followed the maidservant, walking for an unknown distance, and his eyes lit up, entering a hall.</p><p>In the center of the hall was a high platform.</p><p>There were already many people here. Tan Hao found a seat and waited quietly for the auction to begin.</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Inside an unknown room in Ten Thousand Demons City, several white-clad people, who had concealed their auras, sat upright.</p><p>Two people sat at the head of the table.</p><p>One of them opened his mouth in a hoarse voice, "Has the Grand Elder not returned yet?"</p><p>The person next to him nodded and said, "That news was too ambiguous to be true. However, the Grand Elder insisted on going. After verifying its truth, he'll have to rush back from the Demon Realm; it is estimated that he won't make it to the final trade fair."</p>
