<h1>Chapter 1725: Journey West</h1><p>The turmoil in Central Plains need not be detailed.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Yan Yue Temple and then went to the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>He planned to travel west to the Western Lands, inform the cultivators there about the Ascension Platform, and personally visit Master Huaiyin.</p><p>He had learned from the Ganlu Zen Monastery that Master Huaiyin hailed from the Great Compassion Zen Temple in the Western Lands, a temple with many ascetic practitioners and a rare tradition of physical cultivation.</p><p>He also needed the Western Lands' help in searching for fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword.</p><p>He suspected that not all the fragments had been collected.</p><p>Firstly, each region has corresponding celestial palaces, all of which store fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword and incomplete cultivation techniques.</p><p>Secondly, given the cultivation technique, the creator of the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Primal Spirit," must be an unparalleled genius. Could they have truly stopped at the Void Refinement stage?</p><p>However, the Central Plains and Western Lands Buddhist sects have always had exchanges. Master Xingji confirmed that in the past, no celestial palace had been discovered in the Western Lands.</p><p>It’s possible that a cultivator or sect found a celestial palace but kept it secret, enjoying the benefits alone.</p><p>Qin Sang alone couldn't visit every place in the Western Lands; he needed the help of the local forces. If the fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword and the incomplete cultivation technique were found, he naturally wouldn't take them without compensation.</p><p>For this journey, Qin Sang only took his external avatar, leaving the Black Lion Sage in the Central Plains.</p><p>After the Western Lands business was settled, he would go to other regions. Unlike the Western Lands, which has ancient teleportation arrays, he would have to travel through the storms, making the Black Lion a burden.</p><p>Leaving the Black Lion Sage behind served two purposes: as his mount, guarding the Central Plains in his stead, and as the great protector of the Qingyang Temple, assisting Shen Chen.</p><p>Except when in Qin Sang's presence, the Black Lion Sage could roam anywhere in the Central Plains. Any faction, regardless of the two races, would treat him with the utmost respect.</p><p>Even without considering Qin Zhenjun's influence, the Black Lion Sage was a top-tier powerhouse; no one would dare to offend him.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the Black Lion lived a rather carefree life.</p><p>Qin Sang only took his external avatar on this trip.</p><p>External avatars consume significant energy, and his second Nascent Soul was weak.  Returning to his main body would allow for quicker recovery.</p><p>Since he couldn't cultivate while traveling through the storm, it wouldn't affect his main body's cultivation.</p><p>Taking the avatar was also a precaution against unforeseen dangers in the storm zone, such as encountering incredibly powerful beasts.</p><p>The Western Desert was filled with swirling sand.</p><p>Qin Sang flew westward alone across the sea of sand.</p><p>The closer he got to the storm zone, the higher the temperature became.  Dry, hot wind blew in his face, carrying scorching heat waves. He could even see the void distorting.</p><p>After flying for a while, a patch of red appeared on the horizon, like the most brilliant sunset.</p><p>Only upon seeing the "sunset's" true nature could one understand its terror. It wasn't sunset; it was a raging inferno!</p><p>That was the storm zone, but not the familiar ocean storm; this was land.</p><p>On the land, flames soared into the sky.  Raging flames formed a firestorm. Countless tongues and sparks of fire floated in the heavens, covering the sky and stretching endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly see that the normally invisible barrier was dyed crimson, as if countless fire spirits danced on it, firmly preventing the firestorm from invading the cultivation world.</p><p>The invisible barrier separated the storm zone into two worlds: on one side, a world of fire, the earth cracked, fissures everywhere, lava spread across the land, and fiery jets continued to surge from the ground fissures, forming towering pillars of fire everywhere.</p><p>It was a miracle that this land had held together until now, not shattered into pieces.</p><p>The storm swept up, with a lava storm below and a firestorm above, both equally scorching and boundless, capable of burning everything. It was far more terrifying than the ocean storms.</p><p>Low-level cultivators, while daring enough to explore the ocean storm zone, would never dare venture too deep into the firestorm.</p><p>Qin Sang saw two monks standing outside the barrier from afar.</p><p>They saw Qin Sang as well and immediately flew towards him.  Upon reaching him, they bowed, saying, "Greetings, Qin Zhenjun. We have received the Abbot's message, and will now take you to the ancient teleportation array."</p><p>The three of them flew into the firestorm without stopping.</p><p>The two monks’ robes glowed with a faint blue light, as if water ripples emanated from the robes, circling them, repelling the flames. These were clearly specially refined to cope with this environment.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, showed no sign of action, the flames unable to approach him.</p><p>Looking down at the landscape below, Qin Sang thought to himself, this land has been like this for years; I wonder if it might nurture a unique kind of spirit fire.</p><p>Such naturally formed spirit fires are extremely rare. If its grade is high enough, it could be used to cultivate the "Golden Lotus of Fire Seed."</p><p>However, this land is vast and boundless.  It's said that this landscape stretches all the way to the Western Lands, both regions situated on the same landmass.  Cultivators at the late Yuan Ying stage cannot withstand the constant scorching flames.  To search the fiery storms thoroughly, only Qin Sang could undertake such a perilous mission.</p><p>Let's prioritize the main task. We can look for it again later.</p><p>Shortly after, the two monks who were leading the way stopped.</p><p>Beneath them lay a boundless lava lake, the magma churning like ocean waves, indicating its immense depth.  The scenery was monotonous, yet Qin Sang keenly sensed a difference from other areas.</p><p>"Venerable Master, the ancient teleportation array is at the bottom of the lake,"</p><p>one monk pointed downwards.</p><p>It turned out this lava lake was unique; it housed an ancient array, the teleportation array’s existence relying on this formation.</p><p>But after countless years, the ancient array was severely damaged and almost impossible to repair.  Extensive work might even accelerate its destruction.  The Buddhist sect could only perform minor repairs; the same was true on the other side.</p><p>Because prolonged stay in the lake was impossible, the monks guarding the teleportation array had to remain outside, thus giving Gui Mu the opportunity to strike.</p><p>They only realized this when the teleportation array was activated by Gui Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang delved into the magma, quickly found the ancient teleportation array, inserted spirit stones, a flash of light, and he disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>Western Lands.</p><p>Above a certain lava lake, several figures stood in mid-air, all Buddhist monks.</p><p>One figure in the front, slender and old, was a benevolent white-haired elder monk.  Beside him stood a tall and imposing monk, Master Huaiyin.</p><p>The monks silently watched below, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A figure suddenly flew out of the magma.  Seeing the monks above, the figure paused slightly, then flew directly towards them.</p><p>"Greetings, Venerable Master Qin."</p><p>The elder monk clasped his hands together and chanted a Buddhist hymn; Master Huaiyin and the others followed suit.</p><p>"Greetings, Master Zhitang," Qin Sang returned the greeting. "I apologize for the intrusion, disturbing your meditation."</p><p>This Master Zhitang was the abbot of the Great Compassion Temple, the top expert in the Western Lands.</p><p>Even Master Huaiyin showed him deference as a disciple.</p><p>"Venerable Master, please don't say such things.  I've heard of your actions in Central State and am filled with admiration.  You are noble and compassionate, and we shall offer our full support," Master Zhitang's tone was gentle yet possessed a compelling authority.</p><p>Qin Sang then turned to Master Huaiyin.  "It's been many years since we last met, Master, you are as impressive as ever."</p><p>Observing Master Huaiyin, Qin Sang was secretly astonished.</p><p>His complexion was excellent; his injuries were fully healed, and he appeared younger and more valiant than before.  Qin Sang noticed his flesh was as translucent as jade, seemingly with a faint golden glow, extraordinary and unusual, suggesting enhanced strength, possibly due to refining the Xinjin source crystal.</p><p>"Back then, Venerable Master, your astounding debut at the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remains etched in my memory," Master Huaiyin spoke cordially, a stark contrast to his ferocity in battle.</p><p>"This isn't the place for pleasantries; let's talk as we walk?"</p><p>Master Zhitang interjected.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I wish to visit your sacred temple and experience the local customs."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Zhitang shook his head. "There's no need to rush to the temple. I'll first take you to a place, for your identification."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, wondering what he needed to identify.</p><p>They flew north with Master Zhitang.</p><p>During the journey, Qin Sang learned the truth, feeling both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Their destination was a suspected site of an immortal palace ruin!</p><p>The Buddhist sects of the Western and Central Lands had long-standing ties.  Before his departure, Saint Huiguang informed the Great Compassion Temple of the situation.</p><p>Upon learning about the Central State immortal palace's ascension, Master Zhitang surmised that if an immortal palace existed in the Western Lands, it might have ascended as well.</p><p>The topography of the Western Lands differed from that of Central State—it was all land.  An immortal palace's ascension might leave traces.  He secretly dispatched disciples to investigate.</p><p>Recently, a discovery was made.</p><p>A small family from an oasis revealed that an ancestor, while traveling, had entered a storm zone and unexpectedly witnessed a celestial phenomenon.</p><p>At that moment, fiery red light filled the sky, like a red dragon erupting from the earth, tearing through the void and ascending.  The ancestor was terrified and fled in a panic.</p><p>The timing coincided with the ascension of the immortal palace.</p><p>Master Zhitang and Master Huaiyin had just returned from that location.  A bottomless pit remained, already filled with magma, erasing the conspicuous marks.  However, remnants of immortal restrictions seemed to persist deep within the pit.</p><p>Two masters ventured deep into a stormy region, but the chaotic elemental energies forced them back.  They summoned Qin Sang to investigate.</p><p>After explaining the situation, everyone arrived at the location.  The surface appeared unremarkable.  Leaving the other monks above, Qin Sang and the two masters descended into the magma.  Soon, Qin Sang, shielded by his fire lotus, outpaced them, delving deeper.</p><p>Reaching the deepest point, he used his celestial eye to examine the area for a long time.</p><p>After half a day, the three returned.</p><p>"The remaining celestial prohibitions below are as strong as those in the Celestial Palace!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, his voice filled with excitement. He had discovered fragments of celestial prohibitions in the pit, comparable to those in the inner sanctum of the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>The blood lake of Xiao Han Domain, the Abyssal Ruins of Zui Yuan, and the protective formations of Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds were no match for the Celestial Palace prohibitions.</p><p>This place could be where another Celestial Palace fell!  The person from that time saw a Celestial Palace vanish into the sky.</p><p>"So there really was a Celestial Palace in the Western Lands!  To think it was hidden underground."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced south; he had already learned the geography of the Western Lands and knew this area was in the north.  This landmass was vast, with the Central Plains at its eastern edge, but the Western Lands weren't on the western edge—they were surrounded by land on all sides.</p><p>"I think this place isn't far from the cultivation world.  At least Yuan Ying cultivators could reach the vicinity.  Is it possible no one noticed anything unusual, or entered the Celestial Palace?"  Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>A Celestial Palace meant potential cultivation techniques and fragments of the Slaughter Sword!  If any faction obtained them, he had to acquire them, no matter the cost.</p><p>Master Zhi Tan said solemnly, "We don't know what this place looked like before the Celestial Palace ascended, but our temple has no relevant records. My predecessors and I, along with other temples, have repeatedly searched for the Celestial Palace, all to no avail.  To my knowledge, no sect has suddenly prospered from an extraordinary inheritance."</p><p>After a pause, Master Zhi Tan continued, "Before leaving, I sent messages inviting the abbots of other temples and fellow cultivators to a gathering. They're waiting for True Cultivator Qin at the temple now. If any sect secretly occupies the Celestial Palace, now that it has ascended, they no longer need to keep it a secret.  True Cultivator Qin has brought news of the Ascension Platform, so we can use this to inquire."</p><p>Even without Qin Sang prompting him, Master Zhi Tan would investigate.  This wasn't out of greed for treasures.</p><p>All signs pointed to a connection between the Heavenly Demon's Sound and the Celestial Palace's ascension. Perhaps someone in the Celestial Palace had obtained something that could lead to the source of the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>The Three Teach Alliance of the Central Plains was already doing this. When Qin Sang returned to Cang Lang Sea and the Northern Sea, he would also begin his investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I've been collecting cultivation techniques and secret arts from the Celestial Palace; even fragments would be helpful.  If you have any news, please have someone inform me."</p><p>Master Zhi Tan readily agreed.</p><p>They didn't stay long, flying together towards the cultivation world.  While discussing the upcoming gathering and exchanging ideas with the monks, Qin Sang pondered the Celestial Palace.</p><p>In the entire Lesser Thousand World, Bei Chen Realm and the Northern Sea were close and could be considered one entity.  In fact, Bei Chen Realm has always been considered one of the four realms of the Northern Sea.</p><p>The Northern Sea, Central Plains, Western Lands, and Cang Lang Sea all had Celestial Palaces.</p><p>This correspondence was no coincidence.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Celestial Palaces and the various regions of the cultivation world?  Which came first?</p><p>Did the shelters exist first, attracting the Celestial Palaces? Or did the Celestial Palaces exist first, allowing the creation of an invisible barrier to protect nearby creatures when the world was on the brink of destruction?</p><p>Where was the Demon Sea? Were there Celestial Palaces and Slaughter Sword fragments there?  If so, where was the Slaughter Sword?  Were there more than one such sword?</p><p>Also, when he and Liuli traveled through the storm, they encountered a dead cultivation world, much smaller than the other realms.  Was there a Celestial Palace there?</p><p>Qin Sang had asked Master Huai Yin about it.  Apparently, the Central Plains had always known about that place. For great cultivators, the two places weren't that far apart.</p><p>It was said that there had been life and cultivators there, but a great plague had occurred. When Central Plains experts went there again, they discovered that all life was extinct, leaving behind a dead zone.</p><p>Some suspected that local cultivators had accidentally brought it from an ancient secret realm. No plague in the mortal world could be so terrifying, but no one dared to investigate further.</p><p>As he considered these questions, they reached the edge of the storm region.  Passing through the invisible barrier, Qin Sang subconsciously raised his hand and made a fist, sighing, "I only hope the ascension of the Celestial Palace doesn't affect the barrier of the cultivation world and leaves a glimmer of hope for the creatures here."</p><p>At this moment, Master Huai Yin, who had been quiet, spoke, breaking Qin Sang's thoughts.  "I observe True Cultivator Qin's Qi and blood to be extraordinary, and you are skilled in the way of body refinement?"</p><p>(End)</p>
