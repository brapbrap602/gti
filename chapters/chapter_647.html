<h1>Chapter 639: The Poison Spring</h1><p>Chapter 639: The Poison Spring</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Elder Lei Gui kicked open the door to the main hall, his gaze sweeping across the room. He suddenly saw a young man calmly sipping tea, and froze.</p><p>Outside the hall, he hadn't sensed the slightest trace of the young man's presence.  Unless the hall had some special restriction…</p><p>Elder Lei Gui took a step inside, but as he lifted his other foot, his body stiffened, unable to advance or retreat.</p><p>The others, seeing Elder Lei Gui’s imposing entrance abruptly halt, were puzzled.  They were about to urge him forward when they heard a sharp *crack*.</p><p>A phantom hand slapped Elder Lei Gui hard, sending him spinning backwards like a top. In the blink of an eye, he crashed into a mountain peak at the edge of the Five Insects Gate.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Dust and debris erupted as rocks shattered.  Elder Lei Gui’s screams ripped through the air, lingering like a mournful song.</p><p>“Not good! An ambush!”</p><p>The others were shocked, quickly summoning their weapons and magical tools.  For the first time, the area before the Five Insects Gate’s main hall blazed with magical energy.</p><p>They had assumed Cui Xuanzi was, as usual, playing tricks. Believing that with so many experts present, Cui Xuanzi couldn’t possibly pose a threat, they hadn't been particularly vigilant.</p><p>The sudden attack on Elder Lei Gui threw them into chaos.  Some cautiously retreated, others unleashed their weapons and spirit insects toward the hall, while most attacked Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>An instant later, a figure materialized before the hall.  Qin Sang.  Weapons and insects were about to strike him.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, extending a hand. Powerful true energy surged forth, instantly sealing off the space before him.  The weapons and insects, trapped like fish in a net, struggled in vain.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A flash of sword light.</p><p>*Bang bang…*</p><p>A series of impacts. The sword light, like a silken thread, pierced through weapons and insects, destroying them all in an instant.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>Their spirit insects destroyed, their masters cried out in pain.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, his ebony sword flashing, accompanied by a low rumble of thunder.  He charged into the crowd. Splashes of blood blossomed as bodies fell.</p><p>The aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator was undeniable.</p><p>In an instant, the Five Insects Gate fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze, sharp as a knife, swept across the trembling survivors.</p><p>Even Cui Xuanzi was shocked.  He never expected Qin Sang’s swordsmanship to be so terrifying, like chopping vegetables.  A newly-minted Nascent Soul cultivator, yet stronger than their former senior uncle.</p><p>Qin Sang spared the subordinates of the Jing Lei Stronghold and Hundred Flowers Palace, needing them for future tasks. Their bases remained intact; he didn't fear their disobedience.</p><p>The invited independent cultivators, however, were mostly notorious bandits, rebellious, cruel, and bloodthirsty.  Killing them wouldn’t weigh on his conscience.  They were not essential, and stability was the priority.  Their bodies could be made into corpses for later use in his explorations.</p><p>Qin Sang only possessed four Heavenly Corpse Talismans: one remaining from before, and three more crafted using the Soul-Guiding Herb obtained in exchange for the Purple Micro Secret Technique.  Until the true situation in the Canglang Sea region was clear, he wanted to conserve them.  These bandits didn’t include any False Core cultivators, so he wouldn’t waste the talismans on them.</p><p>The forces around Xiong Shan region would surely rejoice if they knew that these troublesome bandits were wiped out.</p><p>…</p><p>In the main hall, Qin Sang sat on the top seat, while Cui Xuanzi, Elder Lei Gui, and the alluring woman stood below.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, seeing that Qin Sang hadn't destroyed the Jing Lei Stronghold and Hundred Flowers Palace as he hoped, felt a surge of resentment, but dared not speak.</p><p>The other two were still shaken, never imagining that Cui Xuanzi wasn't playing games. The wolf had truly arrived.</p><p>“…The stronghold and sect are still yours. But if anyone uses my name to cause trouble, don't expect my help. I merely need some hands to do my work. I won't stay long in the Western Frontier and don't intend to interfere in your disputes.  But I don't want chaos and internal strife to affect my plans.”</p><p>"Since the Five Insects Sect has established the rules, we shall abide by them from now on. Do you understand?"</p><p>Hearing this, the Old Man Jing Lei and the alluring woman exchanged a glance, their worries lessening somewhat.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, though still slightly resentful, recognized this outcome was far better than a humiliating surrender.</p><p>The three of them bowed in agreement.</p><p>The alluring woman composed herself, gazed at Qin Sang with enchanting allure, and smiled sweetly, her voice exceptionally soft and captivating.  "Whatever the master commands, the Hundred Flowers Palace shall obey. My followers have long yearned for a leader like you, to guide our palace.  When might you grace us with your presence...?"</p><p>As she spoke, a faint floral fragrance emanated from her, intoxicating those nearby.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort, like thunder, exploded in her ear.</p><p>The alluring woman, struck dumb, turned pale, her beautiful face drained of color, unable to utter another word.</p><p>*To dare use seduction techniques in front of him—she didn't know her place!*</p><p>Qin Sang coldly regarded the alluring woman. He possessed a jade Buddha; such childish tricks were utterly ineffective against him. After warning her, Qin Sang returned to the main topic.</p><p>"If you complete these tasks satisfactorily, you will be handsomely rewarded."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and talismans, magical artifacts, and elixirs appeared before them.  He looked at them with an enigmatic smile, a blend of intimidation and enticement to ensure their full cooperation.</p><p>...</p><p>Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Located between the Five Insects Sect and two other factions, it had always been a fiercely contested territory. A ten-year rotation agreement had brought a period of stability, shattered only after the Five Insects Sect produced a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang and Cui Xuanzi stood at the entrance, peering inside.</p><p>Towering mountain ranges flanked Black Wind Valley, blocking out the sunlight, creating perpetual darkness within.</p><p>A chilling wind constantly blew through the valley, indicating its considerable depth. Cui Xuanzi explained that it hadn't always been so treacherous; the valley's current state resulted from extensive spirit stone mining.</p><p>"Take me to the Poison Spring first," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>He was searching for an ancient teleportation array and wouldn't overlook any anomaly.</p><p>Having searched the Xiong Mountain region without success, Qin Sang knew he couldn't remain stagnant. He had already made arrangements with Cui Xuanzi and the others, preparing to delve into the Western Frontier to hunt for insects and investigate the secret realm.</p><p>Passing by Black Wind Valley, he decided to take a look.</p><p>Due to the strong winds, the valley could only be entered through the main entrance, heavily guarded by the Five Insects Sect with intricate defensive formations.</p><p>Without waiting for Cui Xuanzi, Qin Sang used his superior movement techniques to descend directly to the valley floor.</p><p>Soon, he sensed the presence of the Poison Spring, situated in a corner of Black Wind Valley; a large expanse, resembling an underground lake, with crystal-clear waters.</p>
