<h1>Chapter 1315  A Waste of Heaven's Bounty!</h1><p>Chapter 1315  A Waste of Heaven's Bounty!</p><p>A white figure flashed, appearing behind the Yuan Ying spirit puppet.</p><p>He stared intently at the puppet, silent, his eyes shining with a strange light, his gaze seemingly penetrating the puppet's body, unusually profound.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing this, ceased questioning, suppressing his curiosity, and quietly watched Bai's actions.</p><p>After a moment, Bai suddenly raised a hand, placing it against the puppet's back. A strange fluctuation emanated from his palm, entering the puppet's body.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet let out a sharp roar.</p><p>Whatever Bai had done, the seals on the puppet were released.</p><p>The runes on its body flickered, its expression instantly becoming ferocious, it suddenly turned its head, filled with madness and bloodlust, about to pounce on Bai.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, but he refrained from acting.</p><p>Bai's strength should be enough to handle the Yuan Ying spirit puppet.</p><p>Qing Jun opened her mouth, about to speak, to warn Bai to beware of the puppet's backlash, when she suddenly heard Bai let out a cold snort, and jabbed his fingers heavily into the puppet's forehead.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A beam of blood shot into the puppet's body.</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet's figure suddenly stiffened, its ferocious expression still lingering on its face, but the madness in its eyes receded like a tide, calming down in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A hint of surprise flashed in Qing Jun's eyes.</p><p>She could sense that the restless spirit within the Yuan Ying puppet had suddenly fallen silent, whether soothed or suppressed, she couldn't tell what secret technique Bai had used.</p><p>She and Qin Sang needed to use puppet seals to achieve this, far less effortlessly than Bai.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, equally unable to fathom Bai's intentions.</p><p>The two watched and waited.</p><p>After subduing the Yuan Ying puppet, Bai pressed his palm downwards, and the puppet obediently obeyed his command, sitting cross-legged on the ground. Then, Bai sat in front of the puppet, his fingers pressed against its forehead, his eyes closed.</p><p>An hour passed.</p><p>Bai and the Yuan Ying puppet remained motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang drank several pots of peach blossom wine, its sweetness refreshing and exhilarating, not noticing his senior sister glaring at him.</p><p>Later, Qing Jun directly opened the restriction on the wooden house where the wine was stored, preventing him from drinking any more.</p><p>They dared not disturb Bai, only able to sense the fluctuating aura of the puppet. For so long, Bai had been searching within the puppet.</p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p>Bai withdrew his finger, opened his eyes, and glared fiercely at the puppet, angrily scolding, “Ignorant! A waste of Heaven's bounty! A waste of Heaven's bounty!”</p><p>This was the second time Bai had lost his composure over a Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>He snorted, stood up, and tossed the puppet back to Qin Sang, plopping down onto a wooden chair, muttering, "Bai has lost his composure, I apologize for the display."</p><p>The sealed Yuan Ying puppet was only palm-sized.</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his hand, playing with it, understanding that Bai's scolding was directed at the creator of the puppet.</p><p>The ancestor of the Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace had crafted a puppet with the strength comparable to a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, yet in Bai's eyes, it was deemed “ignorant.”</p><p>"Brother Bai values it so highly, it seems the materials of this puppet must be very special."</p><p>Qin Sang said, having made that guess beforehand.</p><p>Bai nodded. "It was only upon seeing the puppet that my memory was triggered. I never expected to encounter such a thing here. If it truly is the legendary treasure, I could easily shed this corpse cultivator's body and become a normal person again!"</p><p>Qin Sang was completely shocked.</p><p>He knew Bai had always wanted to escape the Corpse Dao, considering it a crooked path.  But first trapped by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, then pursuing advancement to Corpse King, practicing bone curses, he was already hopelessly entrenched, unable to turn back.</p><p>No wonder Bai was so agitated.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet had such an incredible effect!</p><p>"This puppet was crafted using an extremely rare heavenly spirit root, a complete divine tree."</p><p>Bai's eyes were complex as he explained. "This divine tree is called the Yan Dao Tree. Though not among the top ten divine trees, according to Daoist legends, it surpasses them!"</p><p>"Yan Dao Tree?"</p><p>Qin Sang turned the little figure over in his hands, neither wood nor not wood, its surface had a glazed sheen, smooth to the touch.</p><p>It didn't look like a tree at all.</p><p>The Yan Dao Tree, even its name sounded extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the figure, an idea forming in his mind – could it be incorporated into the Ebony Sword?</p><p>Bai saw Qin Sang’s thought and snorted, “Even amongst the top ten divine trees, not all are for refining weapons. Legends of the Yan Dao Tree are vague, because few have seen one.”</p><p>Legend says a mature Yandao tree is the ultimate medium for powerful Daoist techniques, amplifying their effects tremendously.  Its value is unimaginable! But it has another use, one I've always longed for.  A Yandao tree is a rare celestial treasure.  Lost souls can use it for rebirth without losing their cultivation, gaining a spiritual body made of the tree's wood, and many other unforeseen benefits! That's why this spirit puppet can contain souls.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun were stunned, staring at the spirit puppet. They never imagined this unassuming figure had such an incredible origin.</p><p>Bai spoke of Daoist techniques far beyond the Yuan Ying level; something beyond their comprehension.</p><p>A celestial treasure – they'd never even heard of such a thing.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that his attempt to foil Dongyang Bo's scheme would lead to such a fortuitous discovery.</p><p>Where did the Shangyuan Quiet Palace obtain the Yandao tree?</p><p>Qin Sang guessed it wasn't from the Ziwei Palace, but perhaps excavated from the ruins of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.  It couldn't have grown naturally in the present day.</p><p>Using it to make a spirit puppet was truly a waste of such a treasure.</p><p>The treasure didn't cloud Qin Sang's judgment. He understood Bai's implication and asked, “This is an immature Yandao tree?”</p><p>Bai nodded. “A fully mature Yandao tree is three feet tall. Yours is far from that.”</p><p>“Can it be cultivated further?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, regretting that his San Guang Jade Liquid was gone; otherwise, he could have tried.</p><p>“Don't even think about it.”</p><p>Bai's tone was still resentful. “Do you know that the Yandao tree possesses another unique characteristic, called the 'Immaculate Body'? Its essence is the purest substance in the world.  If its body is touched by any other secret technique or power, even a trace, it will be permanently altered, irreversibly.  Heavenly treasures are often cursed! Throughout history, countless Yandao trees may have been born, but how many have reached maturity?  We don't know.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, finally understanding Bai's rage.</p><p>The spirit puppet was first imprinted with seals, then infused with countless souls, and now altered by him and Qing Jun. It's been utterly defiled.</p><p>A celestial root, reduced to a mere puppet. A terrible waste.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the spirit puppet, his expression complex, unsure of his level of disappointment.  He couldn't fathom the value of a mature Yandao tree or the benefits it could bring, given his current level of cultivation.</p>
