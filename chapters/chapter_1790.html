<h1>Chapter 1781: Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning</h1><p>Thunder Right Mansion.</p><p>Unlike the Thunder Left Mansion, which was scattered across a thousand islands, the entire Thunder Right Mansion sect was located on a single large island.  It was said that this island ranked among the top three in size within the Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Today was the day for the bestowal of the divine talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the thunder talisman bestowed by Elder Li, arrived here to be granted the second-tier Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman.</p><p>Upon presenting the thunder talisman, he was immediately led into the sect by a Thunder Right Mansion disciple, and then proceeded with other cultivators who were also receiving their talismans to the Bestowal Courtyard.</p><p>The tradition of the Thunder Right Mansion was to bestow talismans upon disciples first.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others waited until the last disciple had received their talisman before they were permitted to enter.</p><p>Seeing the Thunder Right Mansion's ancestral altar, Qin Sang thought he had returned to the Thunder Left Mansion.</p><p>The Thunder Ancestor Hall, the sacred image of the Thunder Ancestor, even the style of the incense burner before the hall were identical to those of the Thunder Left Mansion.</p><p>The bestowal ritual was also largely the same as the Thunder Left Mansion's.</p><p>When it was Qin Sang's turn, he entered the Thunder Ancestor Hall, knelt upon a meditation mat, and awaited the ritual master to burn the memorial and offer it to the heavens. The Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman then entered Qin Sang's brow, automatically finding its place.</p><p>At the center of the altar, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal shimmered faintly, and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman submerged within it, disappearing from sight.</p><p>None of the three masters noticed that Qin Sang's altar-protecting divine general was of the Inner Truth and not a deity of the Thunder Department.</p><p>In fact, even if Qin Sang summoned his altar directly, he didn't need to worry about exposure.</p><p>The altar-protecting divine general wasn't a true deity, but a wisp of divine intent, perceptible only to cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, bowed, and retreated, receiving a jade slip like the others. He then departed the Thunder Right Mansion that same day.</p><p>Only upon returning to his cave dwelling on Pot Island did Qin Sang carefully examine the changes before and after the bestowal.</p><p>He first scanned the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>It also contained three parts: key points for altar forging, the Myriad Gods Thunder Department Immortal Guide, and the "Jade Talisman Mantra of Ascending Truth."</p><p>The Myriad Gods Thunder Department Immortal Guide differed from the one he received previously; the number of divine images on it was fewer, but their ranks were higher.</p><p>Flowing Gold Fire Bell Great General, Left Commander General of the Thunder Chariot, Registrar of Thunderclap Records, Fire Bell Heaven-Aweing Official, Jadelight Gold Essence Superior Official, Wind and Thunder Divine Official, Record-Keeping Judge…</p><p>One divine name after another flowed past Qin Sang's eyes, finally settling on the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Great General.</p><p>This deity's image was the only one illuminated amongst the gods!</p><p>"Can I only visualize this one Thunder Department deity?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised but didn't dwell on it, as he wouldn't be contemplating these deities.</p><p>He shifted his attention back to the technique itself. Within his altar, the two techniques had already merged into one.</p><p>The divine talisman carrying the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman was the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of an ancient divine seal in the Daoist tradition called the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Divine Seal, possessing powerful abilities such as summoning dragons and thunder, refining the soul to ascend to truth, slaying water monsters, and dispelling yin spirits.</p><p>He wondered if there was a connection between the two.</p><p>It was said that the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning could subdue all demons, which was certainly an exaggeration.</p><p>However, this talisman did possess the ability to intimidate demonic creatures.  As for the effect, it depended on the disparity in cultivation levels and the strength of the demonic beast's bloodline.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the Golden-Winged Thunder Hawk royal blood, still more than half a bottle remaining, and began to forge his altar.</p><p>The talismanic form of the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning was far more complex than the Jade Clarity Thunder Summoning Talisman.</p><p>Both divine talismans belonged to the High Divine Firmament lineage, and their spiritual apertures could be perfectly superimposed.  All Qin Sang needed to do was continue to "lay bricks and tiles."</p><p>As Qin Sang gradually perfected his altar, the Jade Clarity Thunder Summoning Talisman also received enhancements. The power of the divine talisman would increase with Qin Sang's cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, when the Jade Clarity Thunder Summoning Talisman and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning were used simultaneously, there were wondrous changes, a benefit of their shared lineage.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The jade bottle opened, and drops of blood essence continuously flew out, forming dispersed talismanic shapes and merging into the altar.</p><p>Although he had only recently obtained the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman, Qin Sang's movements were smooth and unhindered.</p><p>For two years, Qin Sang had been studying the Dao of Talismans in addition to cultivating his spirit, and he had purchased numerous brushes, paper, and cinnabar, personally drawing and crafting talismans.</p><p>In a sense, the Dao of Talismans shared commonalities with the Dao of Artifacts and the Dao of Formations and Restrictions. Qin Sang was proficient in both, and thus didn't find comprehending the Dao of Talismans particularly difficult.</p><p>Now, as long as he had the appropriate paper, brushes, and cinnabar, Qin Sang could craft Nascent Soul realm spirit talismans with a reasonable success rate.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed tireless, repeatedly superimposing apertures and merging forms, using up the entire bottle of Thunder Hawk blood essence. The Thousand Jun Ring flashed, and several demon bones flew out.</p><p>These demon bones were Thunder Turtle bones.  When Qin Sang had dissected the demonic corpse, he had kept only the essence.</p><p>The demon bones contained rich Thunder Turtle origin essence.</p><p>As long as these demon bones could be used, he could use Thunder Turtle demon cores for altar forging in future ascensions.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experience fighting the Thunder Turtle, its innate divine abilities were incredibly pure.</p><p>Amongst all the treasures used for altar forging, the blood, bones, and demon cores of demonic beasts occupied the largest proportion. The purer the bloodline, the higher the chance of success.</p><p>Some cultivators in this realm ventured deep into the Demonic Wastelands, hunting ferocious beasts for altar forging.</p><p>Ferocious beasts were corrupted by the Six Heavens Ancient Qi, making them not only mentally deranged, but also physically affected, the corruption seeping deep into their bones and marrow.  It was said that this didn't affect altar forging, but ferocious beasts with pure bloodlines were rare.</p><p>The demon bones gradually melted in Qin Sang's palm, eventually transforming into a pool of thunder plasma, seemingly containing faint blood streaks within.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred, and he drew out a strand, sketching a talismanic form.</p><p>As this dispersed form gradually took shape, showing no signs of collapsing, it finally completed its construction and merged into the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. Without hesitation, he continued forging his altar.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle was a Transformation stage ferocious beast with abundant bloodline power, more than enough to support the completion of his altar!</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his true essence at the peak of the Nascent Soul realm. He didn't need to isolate it with his divine sense and didn't need to worry about any backlash.</p><p>He tested several Daoist techniques, circulating his true essence and absorbing spiritual energy, all flowing smoothly and unimpeded. He couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang's divine sense reached into his spirit beast pouch and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede, simultaneously summoning the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was in deep slumber, emitting invisible fluctuations.</p><p>This slumber wasn't due to an impending breakthrough.  Qin Sang had "sealed" it to protect its intelligence!</p><p>The primordial spirits of spirit insects were extremely fragile.</p><p>After following Qin Sang to this realm, the Fire Jade Centipede lacked protection, and its intelligence gradually deteriorated.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed the signs and immediately forced the Fire Jade Centipede into slumber.</p><p>On the other hand, the Skyeye Butterfly had shown no signs of confusion.</p><p>Ever since devouring the Azure鸾's thunder power and undergoing its transformation, the Skyeye Butterfly had displayed increasingly higher intelligence.  Both it and the Fat Silkworm possessed exceptionally high intelligence amongst spirit insects of the same rank, far surpassing the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>He didn't know if this was the reason, or…</p><p>Qin Sang examined the jade Buddha within him, suspecting that the Skyeye Butterfly, as his natal spirit insect, also benefited in some way.</p><p>The Divine Firmament Thunder Seal glowed faintly, shooting out a seal-shaped mark that embedded itself into the Fire Jade Centipede's forehead.</p><p>The sleeping Fire Jade Centipede trembled slightly, becoming Qin Sang's first insect general!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede transformed into a streak of red light and entered the altar, residing within a spiritual aperture.</p><p>It would still take some time for his altar-protecting divine general to be enhanced, so he would let it continue to slumber.</p><p>"With the altar, I won't need the spirit beast pouch anymore, which is quite convenient."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the now empty spirit beast pouch and casually tossed it aside.</p><p>The spirit beast pouch had originally contained some spirit insects he had collected in the Storm Belt, all auxiliary spirit insects with unique divine abilities.  Due to their low cultivation realms, they hadn't survived until now.</p><p>As for the Skyeye Butterfly, it didn't require such measures.  As his natal spirit insect, it could share Qin Sang's altar field without entering the altar itself.</p><p>After several more months of secluded cultivation, Qin Sang was awakened by a talisman message. He quickly left his cave dwelling and arrived at Master Qi's residence, meeting him in the fire chamber.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Master Qi asked directly, "How is your cultivation of divine abilities progressing? I plan to open the furnace in six months!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>He had been summoned by Master Qi several times before, assisting him in trying various artifact refining techniques, all of which had failed.</p><p>Judging by Master Qi's tone, this time it wasn't an experiment, but a true artifact refining session!</p><p>"How confident are you?"</p><p>Master Qi shook his head slightly, sighing, "I've done my best.  My skills end here. Even if I were given decades more to comprehend, I wouldn't be any better than I am now."</p><p>Qin Sang understood, replying in a deep voice, "This humble Daoist will control the fire for you, Master!"</p><p>With his altar complete, he could assist Master Qi in refining treasures.</p><p>For the next two months, Qin Sang remained at Master Qi's residence, preparing for the upcoming artifact refining.</p><p>Qin Sang controlling the fire was initially a pretext.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang demonstrated his extraordinary fire control abilities before Master Qi, the master was stunned and immediately decided that they would collaborate to refine this treasure.</p><p>Master Qi first refined the Returning Wind Armor, then continuously practiced with Qin Sang until their coordination became seamless.</p><p>Since Master Qi was leading the process, they continued to use his familiar fire chamber and spiritual fire.</p><p>Master Qi tirelessly explained everything to Qin Sang, even more diligently than if he were the student.</p><p>For six months, the two remained inseparable from the fire chamber.</p><p>Finally, the day arrived. Master Qi ordered his attendant to close the doors and refuse all visitors, and he used formations and restrictions to seal off the residence and the fire chamber.</p><p>Only Qin Sang and Master Qi remained in the fire chamber. A square cauldron sat atop the spiritual fire, placed between the two.</p><p>Beside them were neatly arranged true treasure fragments, the Returning Wind Armor, and various spiritual materials.</p><p>Master Qi nodded at Qin Sang and retrieved the new Returning Wind Armor, holding it before him. He rubbed his fingers together, and a white flower sprouted from his fingertips.</p><p>The white flower floated gracefully towards the Returning Wind Armor and immediately took root upon it.  Its slender roots grew wildly, some even piercing through the spiritual armor, weaving in and out, instantly covering it in a layer of roots.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Master Qi's actions intently.</p><p>This was done to implant the white flower into the spiritual armor's energy channels, using its roots to manifest the channels. During the later stages of refining, every subtle change could be precisely observed.</p><p>There were similar techniques within the Wood Aspect Hall's inheritance of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor was placed into the square cauldron.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm and pressed down virtually.  The flames intensified, nearly engulfing the cauldron. They appeared violent, yet every inch and every degree of change was under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>The firelight transformed.</p><p>The flames danced, turning into fire talismans in mid-air, floating into the cauldron and enveloping the Returning Wind Armor layer by layer.</p><p>The green color on the Returning Wind Armor gradually faded, as if it were a red-hot iron. Even the patterns on the armor became faint, though the white flower and its roots remained.</p><p>Master Qi wasn't idle either.  He retrieved the spiritual materials one by one, continuously changing hand seals as runes merged into them.</p><p>After finishing each one, he would send it into the square cauldron, leaving the refining to Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, it was time for the true treasure fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang focused intently, completing his task.  Only the Returning Wind Armor and several orbs of varying colors remained within the cauldron.</p><p>He looked up at the opposite side.</p><p>Master Qi was still busy, the true treasure fragments floating before him, rolling back and forth.</p><p>The more Qin Sang watched, the more amazed he became. Master Qi seemed to be treating the true treasure fragments as talisman paper, occasionally drawing upon the orbs of light within the cauldron as ink, inscribing divine talismans onto the true treasure fragments.</p><p>At first, they only rested on the fragments' surface. Gradually, they seemed to merge into the ripples of water.</p><p>Integrating the Dao of Talismans into the Dao of Artifact Refining – such a profound technique gave Qin Sang a novel experience, leaving him captivated.</p><p>A loud shout startled Qin Sang. Master Qi's eyes widened abruptly, and he pushed both hands forward with force.</p><p>Ripples spread across the true treasure fragments, which then fell into the square cauldron like a waterfall.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly regained his focus, controlling the fire with all his might.</p><p>Master Qi formed hand seals with one hand and pressed the other against the cauldron's body.</p><p>This cauldron was also a treasure.  Runes and restrictions flashed continuously from within, drawing the true treasure fragments and the Returning Wind Armor towards each other.</p><p>It was unclear whether the true treasure fragments were merging into the Returning Wind Armor or vice versa.</p><p>Amidst the blinding light, the two merged into one. The true treasure fragments disappeared, and a layer of ripples seemed to spread across the Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>This was only the first step. The most challenging test had just begun.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber.</p><p>The two sat on opposite sides of the square cauldron, motionless. The firelight flickered erratically, intermingling with the spiritual light within the cauldron.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>The square cauldron trembled, and a clanging sound echoed through the fire chamber.</p><p>As if awakened by the sound, both men opened their eyes simultaneously and exchanged a glance, true essence surging within their palms.</p><p>A strange light shot up from the cauldron, blocked by the fire chamber's restrictions.</p><p>The Returning Wind Armor could be seen slowly rotating within the cauldron, sometimes illusory, sometimes solid.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the most crucial and difficult step had arrived.</p><p>Channeling the energy pathways, infusing the spiritual armor with Qi!</p><p>The two were fully focused, but as time went on, the Returning Wind Armor began to tremble, the tremors growing increasingly violent.</p><p>Master Qi's expression shifted slightly.  He changed hand seals repeatedly and retrieved several spirit talismans, unhesitatingly sending them into the cauldron.</p><p>Qin Sang cooperated fully.</p><p>But despite their best efforts, they couldn't stabilize the situation. The Returning Wind Armor's spiritual light gradually dimmed, and a splashing sound echoed from within the cauldron, filled with unease.</p><p>Master Qi's eyes were bloodshot, and he let out a low growl, but no matter what he did, it was to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, "It's no use, Master.  There's no need to force it."</p><p>As if jolted awake, Master Qi stared blankly at the cauldron, his eyes filled with disappointment. But then, he seemed to realize something, his eyes suddenly lighting up. He abruptly retrieved the Returning Wind Armor from the cauldron and flicked his fingers repeatedly, sending streaks of spiritual light into the armor.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang also seemed to understand something, a joyful expression appearing on his face as he attempted to cooperate with Master Qi.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his hand first. Master Qi's figure flickered and appeared above the Returning Wind Armor, forming a hand seal with one hand and pressing it against the chest plate.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A dazzling spiritual light filled the cave dwelling, silencing all other sounds.</p><p>When the light dissipated, Qin Sang saw Master Qi fiddling with a palm-sized set of spiritual armor, his face filled with delight.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, Master Qi reluctantly tossed the armor over. "It's a pity my cultivation is insufficient. It's slightly inferior to what I envisioned."</p><p>Despite his words, his tone was filled with pride and excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the armor and immediately understood the changes within.  With a thought, the chest plate transformed into a pool of clear water, the true treasure fragment manifesting itself.</p><p>They had originally intended to fully merge the two treasures, but in the end, they only managed to embed the true treasure fragment within the Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>Fortunately, the power of the true treasure fragment could be drawn out through the Returning Wind Armor, albeit only in a small area.</p><p>The true treasure fragment could move freely across the Returning Wind Armor.  Wherever the fragment was located, the defensive power would be far superior to other areas, testing the user's ability to seize the right moment.</p><p>"What a treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded repeatedly.</p>
