<h1>Chapter 1100: Secluded Cultivation</h1><p>After succeeding, the two immediately left the Corpse King's lair.</p><p>They successfully exited the Immortal Tomb, passed through Corpse Vulture Mountain, and arrived at the palace complex at the entrance of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang found a secluded courtyard near the entrance and waited quietly for the Immortal Array to falter.</p><p>After a short while,</p><p>a series of piercing sounds came from deep within the palace. Qin Sang awoke, leaned back to look, and was surprised to find a large group of cultivators approaching together.</p><p>These cultivators did not conceal their auras; among them were several Nascent Soul Masters!</p><p>“So many Nascent Soul Masters are traveling together in Ziwei Palace?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Recalling the confrontation outside the Demon Cave, he knew that a major upheaval might have occurred in the cultivation world.</p><p>The group of cultivators headed straight for the entrance of Ziwei Palace. Fortunately, the palace complex was vast, and Qin Sang hid discreetly in a corner, avoiding encountering his old enemies.</p><p>He carefully withdrew, suppressed his aura, and waited silently.</p><p>Then, other cultivators gathered sporadically.</p><p>Finally, the fluctuations in the Immortal Array's cloud sea began to weaken, until the cloud sea stagnated, and the entire Ziwei Palace began to tremble, about to plunge into the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>In an instant, streaks of escaping light soared into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang was not to be outdone. He activated his protective treasures and rushed into the cloud sea.</p><p>He still vividly remembered the dangers he encountered when entering Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Leaving was much safer.</p><p>Qin Sang successfully passed through the Immortal Array and finally returned to the familiar Ancient Immortal Battlefield!</p><p>At this time, the spiritual tide had not yet completely subsided, and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was in chaos. Ziwei Palace was located deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield; its danger level was no less than the storm zones on the outer edges of the two great seas.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, his feet on the sand, and looked back at the cyclone. He did not want to contact anyone here and immediately moved away.</p><p>Before flying out of Ziwei Palace, he had already summoned the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn. This treasure could still guide him on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, so he wasn't worried about getting lost.</p><p>No one noticed Qin Sang leaving alone.</p><p>The power of the spiritual tide was no longer as strong as before. Qin Sang dodged and weaved, successfully flying out of the desert, and then spatial cracks began to appear in the void, causing a frightening sight.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Sky Eye Butterfly and, using its Sky Eye ability, headed towards Qiongxiong Pass.</p><p>He traveled alone through the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, his speed sometimes fast, sometimes slow, often maneuvering to avoid danger.  After several days, he finally found that the spatial cracks were becoming sparse, and the spiritual tide was weakening day by day.</p><p>At this time, he unexpectedly discovered an unusual phenomenon in the mountains ahead: seven-colored lights flickered, very much like the sign of a secret realm emerging.</p><p>The speed of Nascent Soul Masters was certainly far superior to Qin Sang's, but because he deliberately took a detour, no one should have discovered this phenomenon earlier than him.</p><p>Qin Sang climbed mountains and crossed valleys, arriving at a bare stone mountain.</p><p>The strange light was emanating from inside the stone mountain, from the crevices of the rocks.</p><p>After a brief investigation, Qin Sang confirmed that the light was the manifestation of the secret realm's restriction, weakened by the spiritual tide, revealing itself to the world.</p><p>However, it was less a secret realm and more a cave, filled with the scent of decay.</p><p>After a thorough search, he did not find any treasures. Qin Sang cast a spell to clear the cave, repaired the restriction, concealed the anomaly, and decided to close himself off for a period of time.</p><p>Since entering the Seven Killing Hall, he had experienced constant turmoil and many changes, never having a moment's rest.</p><p>He needed to carefully review his experiences this time.</p><p>Furthermore, various signs indicated that a major upheaval had occurred in the cultivation world here. He needed to carefully consider what to do and how to do it upon his return.</p><p>Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Do you have any leads on the Corpse Soul Pearl?"</p><p>Bai flipped his palm, revealing a round pearl in his palm – the Corpse King's Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>After Qin Sang helped Bai severely injure the Corpse King,</p><p>Bai attempted to subdue the Corpse King but failed. In the end, he could only kill the Corpse King and take the Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>The Corpse Soul Pearl is formed when a corpse cultivates to become a Corpse King, its essence merging with the Corpse Pill, ultimately transforming. It can be compared to the Nascent Soul condensed by cultivators.</p><p>Its surface is greenish-black, flowing with alluring luster, and from time to time, mysterious runes emerge, the restrictions Bai placed on the Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>Within the pearl, corpse energy condenses, like swirling clouds.  Occasionally, a terrifying face appears, extremely ferocious, trying to break out of the Corpse Soul Pearl and silently roaring at the two.</p><p>The Corpse Soul Pearl is extremely rare.</p><p>Neither Qin Sang nor Bai knew how to refine it.</p><p>Bai gently shook her head, hesitating, "The Corpse Talisman is fused with its essence into the Corpse Soul Pearl. I dare not act rashly; it might take a long time. However, if I can refine this Corpse Soul Pearl, even if I don't fully understand the secrets of the Corpse Talisman, I should have a chance to break through to Corpse King…"</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted upon hearing this, "It wasn't all for nothing! After we return, once Daoist Friend achieves Corpse King, we'll work together to search for the remnants of the Sky Corpse Sect. We'll surely find something."</p><p>Bai chose a stone chamber for seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the restriction, and silence descended.</p><p>Inside the cave abode.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense probed into the Qianjun Ring, checking his gains one by one.</p><p>He temporarily lent the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle shell to Bai to use as a shield.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that refining the turtle shell into a purely defensive treasure would be a waste.</p><p>Because the shell contained extremely pure Xuan Water power, Qin Sang had a faint idea, but he needed to wait until he formed his Nascent Soul and further refine his alchemy skills before he could determine its feasibility.</p><p>Four items appeared before him: a transparent lotus seed, fragments of a killing sword, and two jade slips.</p><p>The sword fragments were unchanged from a few days ago; the sword spirit's awakening remained unknown. Qin Sang checked them and put them away.</p><p>Next, his gaze fell on the transparent lotus seed.</p><p>The seed contained the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang chose to cultivate here largely because of this treasure.</p><p>He had hastily condensed the fire seed without time to thoroughly comprehend the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," and he hadn't used the lotus seed, worrying about potential hidden dangers.</p><p>Picking up the transparent lotus seed, Qin Sang activated his divine sense, comprehending the secret technique while simultaneously purging the mark left by Old Devil Mu.</p><p>Days and nights blurred in the cave abode.</p><p>It took two full months.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditative state, gazed at the lotus seed for a moment, then didn't absorb it but returned it to the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>During this time, he had studied the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" and investigated the lotus seed.</p><p>He finally confirmed that the lotus seed only had two uses: recording the secret technique and assisting in the initial stages of cultivation to prevent cultivators from being consumed by fire. There were no other functions.</p><p>He now felt that after some time, once he refined the fire lotus seed to a certain extent, he would reach his limit. Refining more Nine Nether Demon Fire into his body would become unsustainable.</p><p>Neither the jade Buddha nor the lotus seed could help him; it was due to his insufficient cultivation.</p><p>Clearly, the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" wasn't meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>To continue improving, he must form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The current fire lotus seed lacked power, and the increase to his divine sense was insignificant.  The "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" could only temporarily serve as a supporting technique for controlling the demon banner.</p>
