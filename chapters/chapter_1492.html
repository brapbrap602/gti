<h1>Chapter 1483: The Son-in-Law</h1><p>The magical mirror bought Shang Lu precious time.  His attention was focused on the Serpent Banner, and he hadn’t anticipated that Liuli had perfected the Ice Soul Divine Light.  Caught completely off guard, he couldn’t dodge in time.  If it weren’t for this treasure protecting him, the battle would have already been decided.  Because he was facing not only the Ice Soul Divine Light, but also Qin Sang’s Golden Sinking Sword—attacked from both front and back.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A series of loud bangs came from the magical mirror in front of Shang Lu.  Cracks quickly spread across the surface, which became coated in frost.  Before the treasure could fully unleash its power, it froze, losing its effectiveness.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light surged forward silently.</p><p>Liuli no longer concealed her power; the piercing chill made Shang Lu’s heart pound. The Listen Snow Tower’s number one divine ability truly lived up to its reputation.</p><p>Simultaneously, a sword cry echoed through the heavens. A beam of sword light tore through the night sky, leaving a brilliant arc, radiating extreme sharpness as it aimed straight for Shang Lu!</p><p>Outside the arena, Master Yin and the others watched with grave expressions, mobilizing their true energy, ready to intervene at any moment.  In a battle between Yuan Ying cultivators, victory could change in an instant.</p><p>Shang Lu, having failed to see through the trap and taken advantage of by his opponents, had lost the initiative.  Defeat seemed almost certain unless he had a way to turn the tables.</p><p>With the Ice Soul Divine Light in front and the Golden Sinking Sword behind, Shang Lu was in extreme danger.</p><p>However, Shang Lu’s cultivation wasn’t achieved by chance.  Remaining calm under pressure, he didn’t even look at the approaching Golden Sinking Sword, immediately recalling his jade ruler.</p><p>Originally heading towards Liuli, the jade ruler reversed mid-flight, passing Shang Lu and transforming into a white light, rushing towards the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Ruler and sword clashed.  Countless sword energies and white lights scattered, streaks of light and radiant colors like a dazzling firework blooming in the night—incredibly beautiful.</p><p>The hastily deployed jade ruler was undoubtedly knocked away by the sword.  However, the sword light’s momentum was also deflected.</p><p>The pressure on Shang Lu lessened considerably.  He forcefully patted his waist pouch, from which a ten-foot-long snow scarf flew out.</p><p>The moment it appeared, the scarf shattered into pieces, dispersed by the shockwave from the sword and ruler collision, vanishing without a trace, appearing incredibly fragile.</p><p>Just as everyone was curious…</p><p>A white mist inexplicably rose around Shang Lu, enveloping him.</p><p>‘Clack, clack, clack…’</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light followed closely, freezing the surface of the mist into ice. Shang Lu was surrounded by an ice sphere, with the Ice Soul Divine Light continuing to spread inward.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side,</p><p>Qin Sang flashed over.  This was his first time seeing Liuli unleash the full power of the Ice Soul Divine Light—no wonder she was confident in facing Shang Lu. If it weren't for that self-activating protective treasure, they would have already subdued Shang Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered.  He recalled the Golden Sinking Sword, turning to head straight for the Serpent Banner, not cooperating with Liuli to attack Shang Lu.</p><p>Numerous Yuan Ying cultivators outside the arena were watching intently, ready to intervene at any moment.  Even if they won, they wouldn't be able to seriously injure or kill Shang Lu.</p><p>Shang Lu's defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>Since that was the case, it was better to just teach him a lesson.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang ignored Shang Lu, his figure suddenly appearing above the Serpent Banner, his finger pointing downwards.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword shot down.</p><p>Pressed by the sword energy, the Serpent Banner swayed precariously.  Its task was to suppress Liuli, but in the blink of an eye, the situation changed drastically, leaving it no time to adjust. The three snow pythons hadn’t even recovered from the impact of the Ice Soul Divine Light, emitting fearful roars.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The Serpent Banner rose from the ground, violently pulling up the jade-white light, charging towards the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Due to the haste, the three snow pythons were violently shaken from the banner's surface, dazed and disoriented, but their ferocity was ignited, turning to charge back.</p><p>However, the moment they appeared, the pythons saw a blur, and a figure appeared out of nowhere—Qin Sang.</p><p>Their intelligence was not low.  Their demonic eyes flashed with fierce light, emitting sharp roars. Their long bodies writhed, their three tails slamming towards Qin Sang with terrifying force.</p><p>A Yuan Ying cultivator without defensive measures would suffer serious injuries, at minimum, from such a blow.</p><p>A demonic wind blew in their faces.</p><p>“You dare, vile beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. Focusing his mind on the Buddhist seal, his steps like lotus blossoms, his figure moved like a phantom, easily bypassing the python's tail.  He suddenly appeared above the snow python's head, incredibly close!</p><p>He had completely mastered the first four seals of the *Seven Master Buddhist Seals*, including the Demon-crushing Seal, reaching the realm of mindful application.</p><p>He lightly extended a palm, pressing it against the forehead of one snow python.</p><p>The snow python couldn't react.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Brains splattered, skull cracked.</p><p>Even with only the early stages of the fourth level of *Celestial Demon Transformation*, Qin Sang's physique was equivalent to a nascent-stage demon king.  Using the Demon-crushing Seal, a mere minor demon at the Core Condensation stage was no match.</p><p>The light in the snow python's eyes quickly faded, and it died instantly!</p><p>The guests' attention, previously focused on  Liuli and Shang Lu, finally turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Body refinement?"</p><p>The crowd was astonished and uncertain.</p><p>The groom's spirit sword was blocked by the python banner and the jade-white Xuan light. He had no magical treasures in hand, nor any visible magical fluctuations. Yet he had instantly killed the beast with his bare hand!</p><p>The realm of *Celestial Demon Transformation* was understated; his physical body was Qin Sang's least significant means, perfectly serving to distract attention.</p><p>The remaining two snow pythons, hearts and courage failing, turned and fled.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out, seizing a snow python's long tail.  With a powerful tug, scales flew, the snow python's bones exploded with a sickening crunch, terrifying power erupting within its body, shattering its internal organs.</p><p>The last one, more alert, rolled up the python banner and charged desperately towards its master.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Jin Chen's sword dispersed the jade-white Xuan light, striking westward, piercing the snow python's skull.</p><p>*Thwack!*</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue dropped his jade cup, abruptly standing. The composure on his face vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were too fast. One palm strike, one grip, one sword thrust – three snow pythons fell instantly. Those outside the arena couldn't react, watching helplessly as three precious snow pythons were slaughtered.</p><p>After the last snow python died, the first one's corpse hadn't even begun to fall.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the tails of the three snow pythons, extracted their demon cores, and with a flick of his wrist, tossed the corpses to Shi Xue, laughing heartily, "I hear snow python meat is tender and delicious, a rare treat.  My friends, you're in for a feast!"</p><p>Shi Xue cheerfully caught the snow pythons.</p><p>Shang Lu, disregarding the norms of his sect, had attacked during the wedding ceremony. Shi Xue, no longer concerned with Tian Shan's reputation, felt Qin Sang had done well, venting her anger, proclaiming loudly, "Thank you, Shang Zhangzuo, for this grand gift!"</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>On the other side, Shang Lu finally broke free from the Ice Soul Divine Light with difficulty.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice sphere shattered.</p><p>Shang Lu dashed out, his face slightly pale, offering a wry smile, "Shimei Liuli is truly a prodigy, having cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light to such a level."</p><p>Having personally experienced the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light, Shang Lu no longer doubted its strength.</p><p>Liuli didn't respond, her eyes glowing a幽蓝 again, ready to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang darted to Liuli's side, toying with the python banner.</p><p>"No need to continue. Shang admits defeat."</p><p>Shang Lu was quite composed; he understood that losing the python banner made even facing Liuli alone difficult, let alone fighting two.</p>
