Both were victims of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>“Do you know where Liang Yan’s cave is located? Is he cultivating alone, or with remnants of the Kuiyin Sect? Can we contact Shi Hong, senior apprentice sister, now?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked a series of questions in a low voice.</p><p>Liang Yan might have broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, but Qin Sang wasn’t afraid. He not only possessed six Ten Directions Yama Banners, but also a talisman treasure. Few cultivators at the same level could contend with him.</p><p>Even if Liang Yan also had Ten Directions Yama Banners, the Yin soul threads would be greatly weakened, unable to harm Qin Sang’s primordial spirit.</p><p>If Liang Yan could be found, a surprise attack would make killing him and rescuing Shi Hong relatively easy.</p><p>“After killing a Kuiyin Sect Foundation Establishment cultivator, Liang Yan, fearing exposure and being caught by the Yuanzhao Sect, has been hiding and cultivating, rarely appearing. His whereabouts are unpredictable, his cave is extremely hidden, and he frequently changes locations.</p><p>“Later, as his cultivation improved, he felt the pressure lessen and gradually relaxed his vigilance, slowly starting to operate in Yinshan Pass and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>“Several years ago, I encountered Shi Hong, senior apprentice sister, in the Feng Cang Market within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>“Although Shi Hong has gained some of his trust over the years, it's very limited. Liang Yan is inherently deceitful, and to avoid detection, she and I have contacted very rarely.</p><p>“Actually, I've been trying to lure Yuanzhao Sect members to kill Liang Yan and rescue Shi Hong, but I haven’t found an opportunity. Doing so would certainly endanger her life, although she…”</p><p>Tan Hao paused, letting out a long sigh.</p><p>A cold light flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes. He coldly snorted, “Finding Liang Yan is good enough! Did Shi Hong, senior apprentice sister, mention what kind of weapons or methods he usually employs?”</p><p>“She did.”</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. “Liang Yan possesses two powerful top-grade artifacts. One is called Black Dragon Stone, capable of changing size and weighing a ton.  Most cultivators have fragile bodies, and one careless moment could get them smashed into pulp. The other is the Soul Binding Rope, which can restrain opponents, sealing their spiritual energy and energy sea. These two artifacts complement each other perfectly. If he weren't afraid of the Yuanzhao Sect, Liang Yan wouldn't be so low-key and would have made a name for himself in Yinshan Pass.”</p><p>No Yama Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang silently nodded. This made killing Liang Yan even more feasible.</p><p>It makes sense.  While the Yin煞渊 (Yinsha Yuan) swallowed countless lives, refining a single Ten Directions Yama Banner isn't that easy.</p><p>One must wait for the sacrificial offerings to slowly cultivate to the tenth level of Qi Condensation, a lengthy process.  Not to mention the increasingly powerful backlash from the Yama King; very few can withstand it until the end.</p><p>Sun De's father, a direct disciple of the Kuiyin Ancestor, only helped him collect six banners, barely enough to form an array. The rest he had to obtain himself.</p><p>Yue Wu is not a direct disciple of Grandmaster Yi, so his status is certainly lower than Sun De’s father.</p><p>Even though Liang Yan inherited from two Foundation Establishment demons, he may not have managed to gather six Ten Directions Yama Banners.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had Tan Hao thoroughly detail his understanding of Liang Yan.</p><p>Killing Liang Yan was certain, but given his unpredictable movements, how and where to kill him needed careful consideration. Ideally, contact Shi Hong first for a coordinated attack.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang agree to help and display his true strength, Tan Hao was overjoyed. He enthusiastically and meticulously recounted his knowledge of Yinshan Pass to Qin Sang, allowing him to deepen his understanding.</p><p>As the two discussed the matter, they returned to Yinshan Pass.</p><p>Then they left Yinshan Pass and journeyed southwestward towards the edge of the swamp, then entered the Ten Thousand Mountains, arriving at a remote and desolate snow mountain.</p><p>Two figures quietly landed in a secluded valley at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Tan Hao cautiously surveyed his surroundings, moved an inconspicuous stone deep within the valley to reveal a narrow opening, and explained to Qin Sang with shame.</p><p>“The area outside the swamp isn't under Yinshan Pass's jurisdiction, and it’s always chaotic, with killings and lootings commonplace.</p><p>“The caves under Yinshan Pass's control are safe, but the rent is too expensive, I can't afford it.</p><p>“I was fortunate enough to discover a small spirit vein here and opened a cave. Although the spiritual energy is thin, it's sufficiently hidden…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in understanding. Most independent cultivators are as impoverished as Tan Hao, struggling for cultivation resources.</p><p>Entering the cave, Tan Hao carefully replaced the boulder, meticulously wiping away any trace of their passage. He hadn't set any protective formations outside; weak formations are useless and only attract unwanted attention from other cultivators.</p><p>The cave was deep and winding, their footsteps echoing.</p><p>Qin Sang followed, and after a while, she heard the sound of a stream ahead and felt a wave of warmth.  The spiritual energy grew noticeably stronger, and numerous plants, thriving without sunlight, sprouted from the crevices in the rock.  The vibrant green vegetation grew thicker and thicker, forming a lush carpet, creating a surprisingly spring-like atmosphere.</p><p>There was clearly a hot spring within the cave, making for a pleasant environment, though the spiritual energy was rather thin.  Even for Tan Hao's cultivation level, it was barely sufficient.</p><p>At the end of the passage was a protective array. After Tan Hao deactivated it, a neatly hewn stone chamber appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The chamber was quite large, its ceiling adorned with a dozen or so night pearls.  It was clean and well-maintained, with a warm underground river flowing through it from the mountain's depths.  The riverbanks were covered in flowers and plants, and the only furniture was a simple stone bed, likely Tan Hao’s meditation spot.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find Tan Jie, but she saw a jade coffin floating motionless in the center of the stream.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang's heart sank. She turned to Tan Hao.</p><p>Tan Hao approached the coffin softly, his hand tracing the edge of the jade container.  He chuckled wryly, "Brother Qin, I'm not afraid of death. When I die, Tan Jie won't be far behind. In the afterlife, we brothers will be reunited.  And he'll be far better off then…If there's a next life, I will certainly advise him against the path of cultivation."</p><p>The jade coffin was filled with a type of spiritual liquid.  Inside, lying perfectly still, was Tan Jie!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Tan Jie. He was still young, exactly as she remembered him, but he lacked his former vitality. His face was deathly pale, bearing no resemblance to a living person.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense a faint pulse in Tan Jie, indicating that he wasn't entirely dead. But he was barely clinging to life, his breath as weak as a flickering candle, on the verge of extinction.</p><p>Tan Jie was, in essence, living death.</p><p>"All these years…"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was rough, "Has Brother Tan Jie been like this the whole time?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, his tone heavy with sorrow. "Yes, for forty years."</p>
