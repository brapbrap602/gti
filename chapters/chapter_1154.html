<h1>Chapter 1146: Crossing the Tribulation</h1><p>Of course, it was clear to him that Qin Sang's life hung in the balance.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was fast, he wasn't fast enough to easily shake off the Qianji Yao Wang.  There was a significant difference in their cultivation levels. Unless something unexpected happened, the only outcome would be Qin Sang's depletion of true essence and capture by the Qianji Yao Wang.</p><p>"This guy actually let me go. He doesn't seem like a cruel and bloodthirsty type. The Azure Bird phantom actually triggered a reaction in my bloodline. If I miss this chance, there won't be another…"</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, the falcon demon couldn't resist the temptation and, circling around, secretly followed.</p><p>In the night.</p><p>Two streams of light, one in front of the other, flew out of the Myriad Serpents Abyss – Qin Sang and the Qianji Yao Wang.</p><p>The other lesser demons were far behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the second stream of light appeared,</p><p>a thick white fog suddenly enveloped the canyon, instantly sealing off the surrounding space and forming a massive illusionary array, trapping the Qianji Yao Wang inside.</p><p>The Qianji Yao Wang wasn't unprepared. His light stopped abruptly, and a strange light burst forth, dispersing the white fog. But instantly, it closed in again.</p><p>"An illusionary array?"</p><p>The Qianji Yao Wang was secretly annoyed.  This illusionary array was one even he couldn't instantly see through, indicating that the array master's strength was probably no less than that of the thief from before.</p><p>Such anomalies are rarer than Nascent Soul cultivators; two appeared at once.</p><p>Outside the illusionary array,</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, falling from mid-air. He was on the verge of exploding.</p><p>Fortunately, Bai arrived in time, catching Qin Sang. Discovering the abnormality in Qin Sang's body, he asked with surprise, "What did you do in there?"</p><p>Everything had been normal when he went in.</p><p>The power within Qin Sang's body was unusually violent, possessing an extraordinary power that even made Bai tremble.</p><p>"It's a long story!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly. "I need to use all my strength to forcefully break through. As long as I break through to the fourth level of the cultivation technique, I won't fear the Yao Wang.  Brother Bai, please take me away first."</p><p>Bai, assisted by a white cloth formation, escaped into the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>Knowing the urgency of the situation, Bai didn't ask further. He nodded, took Qin Sang, and without looking back, fled towards the distance.</p><p>This was only the first layer of insurance.</p><p>The fluctuations of the illusionary array were extremely subtle, deceiving even the perception of transformed demons, but correspondingly, its power was limited.</p><p>If they couldn't escape the Qianji Yao Wang, the spirit of the willow tree, Old Monkey, and the other major demons of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea had already been dispatched, setting up a large array in a hidden location as a precaution.</p><p>They wouldn't be used unless absolutely necessary, to avoid exposing them.</p><p>Bai, having absorbed the power of the Corpse Soul Pearl, had greatly increased his strength and speed. Corpse Qi transformed into a black stream of light, speeding across the night sky.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on cultivating without distraction.</p><p>The situation was still perilous.</p><p>This power, once inside his body, was like a malignant tumor, impossible to remove.</p><p>If he could seize the opportunity to break through, he and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly would both benefit greatly. If he failed, he might be blown apart by the Azure Bird's power, his cultivation ruined.</p><p>The short chase had almost led to his demise.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inside his body and found that the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was still absorbing the Azure Bird's power.</p><p>The emotions it transmitted also carried a clear sense of pain.</p><p>However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly was quite intelligent. It understood this was an unparalleled opportunity, and, like Qin Sang, was very resilient, persisting no matter how much pain it endured.</p><p>Absorbing this power, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's wings mutated into green, and the patterns on its eyes shimmered with silver light, with lightning flashing within.</p><p>The green light on its body became increasingly intense, gradually showing signs of pupation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt both joy and worry.</p><p>Whether it was a transformation or a mutation, it would certainly not be a bad thing for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. But once the Sky-Eyed Butterfly fell asleep, there would be no one to help him share the impact. He had to break through before then!</p><p>"Heavenly Demon Dharma Manifestation…"</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed all distracting thoughts, the entire cultivation technique flashing through his mind.</p><p>He was urgent but not chaotic.</p><p>Having seen a real Azure Bird and personally felt its aura, Qin Sang now knew where he had gone wrong in his previous visualization of the Azure Bird.</p><p>He began by correcting this step.</p><p>Then, he started from the first level, to the second, to the third.</p><p>At this point, he discovered that there were many omissions and even errors in his previous cultivation, only able to forcibly advance with the help of star energy infusion due to his low cultivation level.</p><p>Now, with things straightened out and corrected, his cultivation technique underwent a qualitative change, and Qin Sang's physical body became even stronger.</p><p>“So that’s how it is!”</p><p>Qin Sang had an epiphany, overjoyed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Bai outside was nearly frantic.</p><p>As expected, the illusionary formation didn't hold the Demon King for long.</p><p>Once the formation was broken, the Demon King pursued again. Bai kept glancing at Qin Sang, seeing no sign of a breakthrough.  Finally, he dashed towards their ambush point.</p><p>“Brother Bai! Put me down!”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly called out.</p><p>Bai paused slightly, glanced at the approaching Demon King, and ultimately chose to trust Qin Sang.  He moved in a blur, landing on a mountaintop.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, eyes closed.</p><p>His cultivation technique reached its final step; the first three layers were refined.  As if it were effortless, Qin Sang immediately sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough!</p><p>He had already been on the verge of breakthrough after infusing himself with stellar energy and merging with the Azure Luan's power.</p><p>It was no wonder it was so easy.</p><p>“Azure Luan Dharma-image!”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind replayed the image of the Azure Luan soaring through thunderclouds.</p><p>Every movement, every nuance of the Azure Luan was deeply imprinted in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>In the void, the wind and clouds stirred!</p><p>Qin Sang’s body glowed intensely with azure light, exceptionally bright in the night, illuminating the entire mountain.</p><p>Suddenly, this azure light furiously converged toward the center of the storm.</p><p>Moments later, a phantom image of an Azure Luan emerged from nothingness, raising its head proudly, facing the stars and moon, its divine might undeniable—a true divine beast!</p><p>The Azure Luan Dharma-image was complete!</p><p>The Dharma-image was still somewhat illusory compared to the shadow on the stone tablet and needed further refinement by Qin Sang to solidify.</p><p>However, it was already enough!</p><p>The moment he comprehended the Dharma-image, Qin Sang's bones crackled, finally breaking through the barrier and advancing to the fourth level!</p><p>His body transformed, expelling impurities.</p><p>Qin Sang’s aura surged, his wings instantly solidified, the tables turned. He greedily absorbed the Azure Luan’s power, it gradually transforming into a tangible form.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai pondered.</p><p>In the distance, the pursuing Demon King’s expression shifted, his brows furrowed in contemplation. The thief’s emanating aura was a palpable threat.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed triumphantly, his chest swelling with relief.</p><p>“Rumbling…”</p><p>Suddenly, thunderous claps shook the heavens, abruptly cutting short Qin Sang’s laughter.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up sharply, horrified to discover dark clouds gathering overhead, lightning flashing—not ordinary thunder, but tribulation clouds!</p><p>“It’s just my body getting stronger, why a tribulation? And a lightning tribulation at that!”</p><p>Qin Sang's joy turned to sorrow; he wasn't prepared to face a tribulation now.</p><p>Then, he noticed something amiss—the tribulation didn't seem to be targeting him.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, after forming its light cocoon, was still absorbing the Azure Luan’s power, when it suddenly flew out, a crack appearing on its surface!</p>
