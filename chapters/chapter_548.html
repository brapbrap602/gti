Chapter 541: Condensed Essence, Refined罡, Parting Clouds to See the Sun!


The Flying Night Devil's power was only equivalent to a pseudo Gold Core.
But at least it wasn't the worst outcome. Even possessing power comparable to the Flying Night Devil far surpassed other Foundation Establishment cultivators, greatly benefiting his search for Core Formation treasures.
Qin Sang didn't deliberate for long before making up his mind.
He withdrew the Ebony Sword into his Nascent Soul, his mind connecting with the Killing Talisman on the sword; the familiar feeling returned.
Qin Sang was about to circulate his cultivation technique and absorb spiritual energy when a thought suddenly struck him. He tried to use the technique to draw on the True Essence in his Qi Sea, but found the two completely incompatible.
The "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" could only cultivate using Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi.
The True Essence itself remained unresponsive.
If the "Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter" could utilize True Essence, he might be able to control the Corpse Core, refine it into his own Gold Core, and thus undergo a transformation.
His intentions were ruthlessly shattered by reality.
"Thinking too much!"
Qin Sang laughed self-deprecatingly. "I'll just treat this Corpse Core as an external elixir from now on."
Absorbing Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi was too slow, and this wasn't a place abundant in spiritual energy.
Delay meant trouble.
Qin Sang quickly set up a simple Spirit Gathering Formation around himself, then held a mid-grade spirit stone in each hand, rapidly absorbing spiritual energy into his body.
At this time, the spiritual energy in his body had long been exhausted during the罡and Sha Core Formation attempt. Later, after forming the Corpse Core, he could only use True Essence.  His Qi Sea could be said to be completely devoid of spiritual energy, thoroughly drained.
Abundant spiritual energy surged into his meridians, following familiar paths. After circulating for a full cycle, it gathered in his Qi Sea.
"Eh?"
Qin Sang was surprised to find that there was actually some spiritual energy in his Qi Sea.
The moment the new spiritual energy entered his Qi Sea, amidst the turbulent waves of True Essence, an extremely fine, almost imperceptible trace of spiritual energy quietly emerged and swam out.
It was so minuscule, hidden within the True Essence, that it was no wonder he hadn't sensed it at all before.
Even now that it had revealed itself, it was almost like it didn't exist, barely perceptible.
Strangely, Qin Sang felt an extreme thirst emanating from this wisp of spiritual energy, a sensation he had never experienced before.
It was like a starved and dehydrated young beast, emaciated to the bone, finally encountering water and food, eagerly and joyfully gulping it down.
Under Qin Sang's astonished gaze, this wisp of spiritual energy began to devour the new spiritual energy.
Compared to the incoming spiritual energy, this wisp was insignificant, the two not on the same scale at all. Yet, Qin Sang felt like the new spiritual energy was being 'devoured.'
The scene of a snake swallowing a whale played out before his eyes.
Qin Sang continuously absorbed spiritual energy from the two mid-grade spirit stones. This energy flowed into his Qi Sea and was completely swallowed by that single wisp.
Like a seed, after receiving nourishment, it took root and sprouted, beginning to grow on its own.
Qin Sang didn't stop it, patiently waiting until it gradually grew larger and became clearly perceptible.
When he tried to guide this wisp of spiritual energy...
Silence descended upon the cave.
In the next moment, Qin Sang abruptly stood up, his eyes wide, staring fixedly at his dantian. He seemed to have witnessed something incredibly unbelievable, utterly shocked and incredulous.
After a moment of stunned silence, Qin Sang suppressed his excitement, took a deep breath, and hurriedly sat down cross-legged, immersing himself in meditation to carefully examine this wisp of spiritual energy again.
The previous fleeting sensation was completely gone.
Incredibly dense!
Incredibly solid!
Exceptionally thick, like liquid mercury!
No wonder it had devoured so much external spiritual energy to grow this much.
Qin Sang could hardly believe it, repeatedly confirming countless times before daring to believe that his spiritual energy had truly transformed into this state!
If he remembered correctly, the experiences and records left by the predecessors in the Treasure Pagoda Peak of Mount Shaohua indicated that when this phenomenon occurred, it was a sign of imminent Core Formation!
Moreover, their spiritual energy hadn't reached the level of density his had before they successfully formed their cores.
According to their descriptions, most people hadn't even reached half of his current level of density and still had a decent success rate in Core Formation. Those with denser spiritual energy, while still not comparable to his, could basically form their cores without issue!
Why had this happened? What had caused his spiritual energy to change?
Amidst the ecstasy, Qin Sang couldn't help but ponder the reason.
He was certain that before infiltrating the Qingyang Demonic Sect, there hadn't been any signs. Back then, spiritual energy still existed in his Qi Sea, equally balanced with Earth Sha Qi.
There was only one possibility: the罡and Sha Core Formation attempt!
Qin Sang carefully recalled that on Divine罡Peak, in order to prevent the Earth Sha Qi and Dry Heaven罡Qi from colliding prematurely, and to allow them to impact his Gold Core simultaneously, he had been forced to envelop them with his spiritual energy.
During this process, his spiritual energy had constantly endured the impact and refinement of both forces.
At the time, Qin Sang was solely focused on ensuring the success of the罡and Sha Core Formation. He hadn't had time to pay attention to any changes in his spiritual energy. Moreover, after his spiritual energy was exhausted, being refined down to this single wisp, it had been impossible to detect.
Later, his Qi Sea was occupied by the True Essence of the Corpse Core, suppressing this wisp of spiritual energy, preventing it from revealing itself.
"Yin and Yang, Yin and Yang..."
A flash of lightning struck Qin Sang's mind.
That was it!
The Kan-Li Gold Core, named after Kan and Li, though a single spiritual core, contained both Yin and Yang properties.
The Iris Flower and Snow Spirit Lotus were representative Yin and Yang spiritual herbs, even growing together at the root, one thriving in ice and snow, the other in magma, with extremely demanding environmental requirements.
Including the Profound True Pill and other spiritual items, as far as Qin Sang knew, all possessed both Yin and Yang powers.
As the saying went, lone Yin cannot give birth, lone Yang cannot grow.
The path of Gold Core Formation aligned with the principle of Yin and Yang harmony.
Earth Sha Qi was the ultimate Yin Sha Qi in the world, while Dry Heaven罡Qi was the ultimate Yang罡Qi. The two were opposites, Yin and Yang, the ultimate Yin and Yang substances in the world!
Could they also have an auxiliary effect on Core Formation?
Condensed Essence, Refined罡!
Wu Shang's ingenious idea had actually manifested here!
Qin Sang didn't know if anyone in the ancient cultivation world had discovered that condensing essence and refining罡could aid in Core Formation, as he had read very few ancient texts, and most of them were incomplete.
But at least in the records of more recent cultivators he had seen, including the many fellow cultivators he had encountered in the Chaotic Islands, no one knew about this.
The reasons for this were not hard to imagine.
Firstly, these two wondrous substances were too rare.
Earth Sha Qi could at least be found on the ground with patience and was relatively easy to obtain.
Dry Heaven罡Qi, however, resided in the Nine Heavens, separated by a罡Wind Belt that even Nascent Soul Grandmasters dared not trespass. Who among them, mere Foundation Establishment cultivators, would dare to ascend to the Nine Heavens to retrieve罡Qi?
They could only wait for罡Qi to descend from the heavens, transforming into罡Crystals.
And throughout the Small Cold Region, in such a vast territory, there were only two locations where罡Jade existed: one in the cave dwelling of the Small Cold Region's most powerful cultivator, and the other occupied by a long-established demonic sect.
Forget about attempting it, they couldn't even come into contact with Dry Heaven罡Qi.
