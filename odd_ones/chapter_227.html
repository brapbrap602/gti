      The slashing slime could not corrode the mechanical suit. Shadow
                Stalker Viper’s carapace cracked all over its body, covered in
                blood and slime. Pressed on the floor by Han Xiao, its health
                decreased steadily.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The herd charged toward them one after another like they had
                lost their minds. Han Xiao used the Beast King’s body as
                protection and dodged most of the attacks with his agility. The
                vision on the tactical display screen was jumping all over the
                place. Normal people would have a headache by looking at it for
                just a few seconds, but Han Xiao was completely used to it and
                was not affected at all.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Every punch, every kick, was sent out with incredible power that
                the surrounding terrain looked like it had been destroyed by a
                tornado.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With his basic combat skills all being at max level and the
                performance enhancement from Viper, Han Xiao’s close-range
                combat ability was way above average, the Beast King’s health
                very soon arrived at the killing line, as it was unable to eat
                waste materials and regenerate. Han Xiao’s energy flew into
                Compounded Magnetic Chain Split Blades and formed a high speed
                spinning pointy cone around his arm like a drill, piercing right
                into the Beast King’s head.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ignoring the wail, Han Xiao grabbed onto the wound to not get
                dropped by the struggling Beast King, he then turned on the
                Sunworm and sprayed at the bloody brain of the Beast King. A
                smell of burnt meat spread in the air, the Beast King’s body
                suddenly became stiff, like a fish out of water, giving his last
                struggle before death.

     <p class="calibre5">
      As soon as the Beast King died, the surrounding Shadow Stalker
                Vipers growled in agony and pounced toward Han Xiao dauntlessly,
                wanting to shatter this enemy that was harder than iron,
                submerging Han Xiao instantly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      But the next moment, a strong repel force pushed all of the
                Shadow Stalker Viper away at a speed even quicker than when they
                attacked. They hit against the wall of the nest as the Field
                Repulsive Machine on Viper’s arms made a buzzing sound.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This repulsion force caused a chain reaction, and the nest
                started crumbling down piece by piece. The ground was shaking so
                rapidly that it was like an earthquake.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao did not want to be buried alive, so he concentrated all
                the power in his legs and jumped up. The floor cracked open from
                the strength of his jump, and he flew up in the air. He then
                turned on the Mini Maneuvering Equipment to give him further
                boost in speed. With the combined forces of the jump and the
                Mini Maneuvering Equipment, he rocketed up and burst through the
                mud above his head.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The next second, the ground exploded, and a black figure bolted
                out of the ground. The vision became obstructed, and the night
                sky came into sight.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The West City Area collapsed. Cracks opened from the sunk
                ground, and dust splashed out from within. Some players got
                buried and died; some players escaped and watched the scene,
                stunned.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “The entire city collapsed because of the fight. Such strong
                destruction power!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Isn’t that Black Phantom? Did he do it‽”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He’s got to be a max level BOSS with such strength!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “All the Shadow Stalker Vipers are buried alive. Does that mean
                our mission is completed? There’s no notification though.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The players were shocked and confused. They looked at Han Xiao
                at the side who was wearing the mechanical suit with fire in
                their eyes. They had seen the video of the mechanical suit in
                action on the forums, and now they had finally witnessed that
                themselves. It was even more impressive than in the videos.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Jade Green Sky trotted over after he revived and was shocked by
                the completely different scene than before. He hastily asked
                about the situation, then contemplated and said, “The mission is
                not completed yet. There are chances to make use of the
                situation.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the same time, signs of life appeared within the ruins,
                Shadow Stalker Vipers that were still alive crawled out with
                struggle. Only a small half of the nest had collapsed, but all
                the tunnels were blocked, so all the beasts had nowhere to
                escape.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Seeing this, the players dashed over in a hurry to get the last
                hit.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was only responsible for dealing with the Beast
                King—the other small monsters were to be dealt with by the
                players. The sound of cracking came out of his neck as he
                twisted it to relieve his tight nerves.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Yu brought some people over and waited on the side.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “When the Inhumans are done the cleaning, you guys go dig
                through the ruins. Bring the radiation crystals and the
                carcasses into the warehouses, especially the Beast
                King’s—that’s rare material. Although I broke quite many parts
                of it, it should still be of some use,” Han Xiao said casually.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Yu took a look at the sunk ground, gulped, and nodded
                hastily.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Half an hour had yet to even pass since Black Phantom came, and
                he had already settled the problem. Even though the West City
                Area had almost been destroyed, this astonishing efficiency left
                Huang Yu in complete awe.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After returning to his room, Han Xiao took off Viper and
                repaired its damage.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At around midnight, Huang Yu finally came with the information
                that the cleaning of the ruins was completed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “We have stored 846 Shadow Stalker Viper carcasses. 27 of them
                are mutated, and one is the Beast King. More than 300 undamaged
                eggs have all been stored in the frozen warehouse. Also, we have
                collected about two tons of radiation crystals—the 300 pounds
                that were collected near the center of the nest seem to have a
                higher concentration.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “By the way, Coney Fury has discovered the source of the
                crystals. These Shadow Stalker Vipers have been consuming high
                energy waste as their food source. The slime secreted in their
                bodies has gone through special reactions, which caused them to
                harden and thus become crystals.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was stunned for a second. “So… these radiation crystals
                are actually Shadow Stalker Vipers’ feces?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You could say that.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao scratched his head and thought of Frenzied Sword.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Never mind. The truth is too cruel for me to tell him. I
                  don’t think he can take it.

      The players on the leaderboard were delighted. Although it was
                unfortunate for those who did not make it, they did not make a
                lose anyway as the experience from killing the Shadow Stalker
                Viper was more than enough to cover the experience spent to take
                part.

     <p class="calibre5">
      “We’re first!” Jade Green Sky and the people of the Sky
                Territory Core Team One were filled with joy. The players beside
                them looked over with envy, focusing their eyes on Jade Green
                Sky’s Heavy Mechanical Arm.

     <p class="calibre5">
      “Sky Territory really is steady.”

     <p class="calibre5">

                god-tier weapon for Pugilists. It can both tank and deal damage,
                but it is very expensive, and only Black Phantom sells it.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Seeing the effect of the Heavy Mechanical Arm, many players
                started to desire it. Desire would create demand, and demand
                meant potential customers.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The ruins needed reconstruction. The head of West City Area gave
                out more missions, and the players rested for a while before
                starting to help once again.

      The next day, Han Xiao woke up to the construction noise
                surrounding him in all directions, and he rubbed his temples
                helplessly. It was indeed much quicker to have the players help
                to build the city, but there was one tiny flaw of that, the
                players didn’t sleep or rest and worked throughout the day—this
                non-stop noise pollution almost made him mentally fatigued.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The secret base, however, had very good noise reduction
                measures, and it was in a rural area where no one had done any
                construction. Han Xiao had gone there secretly a few times and
                brought some supplies over for storage. He had also enhanced the
                security measures.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the surface, Han Xiao did not work in the base.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao came to the boisterous workshop then walked to his VIP
                room, which he had entered many times. Inside were many neatly
                arranged boxes emitting a magnificent, beautiful, but strange
                aura.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, knowing that these are the feces of monsters, Han Xiao
                could not appreciate their beauty no matter how magnificent they
                were. He made sure his gloves were on tightly.

       Radiation Crystal—can be turned into energy block after
                  purification, non-elemental pure energy. Although it says
                  these are of high concentration, these should be of the low
                  tier in the standard of the universe. The conversion rate is
                  roughly 100:1, so two tons of it should probably be able to
                  produce 45 pounds of energy blocks. These can be used as
                  emergency energy storage; it is a surprising but welcome
                  income.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There were many types of energy—magnetic, electrical, nuclear,
                light, planet, antimatter, dark, psionic, and many more. If
                these were psionic energy blocks, they would be as valuable as
                the entire Planet Aquamarine. However, only very advanced
                civilizations could acquire, convert, and make use of psionic
                energy; low-class civilizations would not be able to use it even
                if they were able to acquire psionic blocks. Those civilizations
                that had discovered psionic energy too early had all destroyed
                themselves. To research and experiment on psionic energy without
                the required technology was suicide—thus, their entire planet
                was vaporized.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There were also 300 pounds of dark-blue crystals with higher
                concentration. Han Xiao guessed that it was the feces of the
                Beast King. The Beast King owned the most amount of high energy
                waste, so it produced crystals with the highest concentration
                compared to the others. It could barely be considered
                middle-tier concentration. The purification rate would be much
                higher, and they should be able to produce 10 pounds of energy
                blocks with higher Ona.

      Han Xiao’s [Basic Extraction] was at max level. The knowledge
                from the energy brunch could be infused into the Energy Block
                Extraction Device, which was a rather precise device. Han Xiao
                contemplated for a while and remembered the knowledge
                combination. He had plenty of experience points, so he
                successfully gambled out the blueprint after a few infusions and

      This thing was very steampunk. The input port was in a funnel

                Block Extraction Devices were most common in crystal
                civilizations where magic and technology were both present, and
                energy blocks were the main energy resource. The headquarter of
                Japan, Planet Lonnie, was one of such civilizations. It was a

      Han Xiao patted his hands. All that was left were the carcasses
                and eggs in the frozen warehouses. These could be used to make
                drugs, but he was not a Pharmacist.
