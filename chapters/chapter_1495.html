<h1>Chapter 1486: The Ruyi Lingzhi</h1><p>The senior disciple took the jade slip, hesitated, and asked, "Master previously said that the Xuan Tian Palace Master may be unable to act. With so many experts gathered on the ship, can't we still hold off Xuan Tian Palace and create an opportunity for us?"</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder seemed to be in a good mood. He said leisurely, "Xuan Tian Palace, such a behemoth, even without its Palace Master, is not something a group of rabble can shake. That Grand Elder is no pushover either.</p><p>"We can't determine the Palace Master's condition, nor how much control Xuan Tian Palace has over the Sacred Grounds. We must be cautious.</p><p>"Persuading that fellow who can use lightning escape might have some chance, but this person is timid, appearing once in the Hundred Flowers Valley before disappearing without a trace.</p><p>"However, even so, we need the help of the demon race to contain Xuan Tian Palace from the outside and weaken their power in the Sacred Grounds."</p><p>The senior disciple, having learned, said worriedly, "Tian Peng Great Sage's confidants are all seasoned old demons, powerful and cunning. Master, inviting Tian Peng Great Sage, I'm afraid they harbor ill intentions."</p><p>Hun Mo Elder wasn't worried. "That's why I only allowed Tian Peng Great Sage to come along. We'll just borrow a few subordinates from the Nine-Headed Great Sage to create a show of force, putting pressure on Xuan Tian Palace.  I have the initiative; one demon race Great Sage can't make any waves."</p><p>"Master is wise!"</p><p>The senior disciple's doubts were resolved, and he bowed respectfully before returning to the cabin.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder's expression turned serious, his brows furrowed as he gazed at the storm zone.  He was quite confident, but his failed test at the Great Demon Assembly made him suspicious. However, it was too late to turn back; he could only wait.</p><p>Suddenly, Hun Mo Elder's face changed slightly. He patted his pouch, and a white light flew out—the Ruyi Lingzhi.</p><p>The moment it left the pouch, a faint white aura rippled from the Ruyi Lingzhi.</p><p>Seeing this, a look of intense joy flashed in Hun Mo Elder's eyes, his worries vanishing. He laughed heartily, "So it is! So it is!"</p><p>Hun Mo Elder grasped the Ruyi Lingzhi, stamped his foot, and the Black Dragon Ship set sail towards the storm zone.</p><p>The others on board were immediately alerted.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Streams of escaping light flew to the bow.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun, Gui General, Yue Mo, Chi Jie Zhenren…</p><p>Usually rarely seen demons flew out of the cabins, as well as some Nascent Soul cultivators who lived in seclusion in the Boundless Sea, both righteous and evil.</p><p>There were even several Xuan Yue-level independent cultivators.</p><p>Yet, in Hun Mo Elder's mouth, these many Nascent Soul cultivators were just a rabble.</p><p>Just then, an overwhelmingly powerful aura surged forth, causing everyone along the way to change color and quickly clear a path.</p><p>A golden light arrived in a flash, landing unceremoniously on the bow, standing side-by-side with Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>As Tian Peng Great Sage appeared, the Black Dragon Ship entered the storm zone and was immediately surrounded by hurricanes.</p><p>He glanced at the Ruyi Lingzhi in Hun Mo Elder's hand. "Old Demon, is this the Ruyi that can guide us to the Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Grounds?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Hun Mo Elder was full of spirit, "I accidentally obtained this treasure and unexpectedly learned that it is connected to the Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Grounds. The Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Grounds are the place that sustains the prosperity of a giant sect for generations; I have long admired it!"</p><p>Hun Mo Elder deliberately raised his voice for the last sentence.</p><p>Everyone else heard it clearly.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were moved.</p><p>As Hun Mo Elder said, the Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Grounds were well-known, the undisputed number one treasure land in the three regions of the North Sea. It's just that Xuan Tian Palace was too powerful, always occupying the Sacred Grounds, and no one dared to challenge them.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace's secrecy was also excellent. Countless people had tried to find the location of the Sacred Grounds and sneak in, but all had failed.</p><p>Countless seemingly true rumors circulated, whether deliberately released by Xuan Tian Palace to mislead people.</p><p>Those Nascent Soul cultivators didn't come alone; they also brought their own favorite disciples.</p><p>Because most of the opportunities in the Sacred Grounds were meant for low-level cultivators.</p><p>This was the real secret behind Xuan Tian Palace's abundance of geniuses.</p><p>Legend said that, starting from the Foundation Establishment stage, similar opportunities existed for every small realm, even reaching the Nascent Soul stage, forming a complete system that was astonishing.</p><p>Many suspected that this was the remnant of an ancient immortal sect, a place to cultivate disciples.</p><p>Information about the Yuan Ying stage is hard to come by, but rumors below that level are plentiful, suggesting that Yuan Ying cultivators also benefit greatly.</p><p>The jade slip Hun Mo Lao Ren gave them contained incredibly detailed information, surpassing anything anyone had previously found.  It's unclear how long the old cultivator spent gathering it.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng detected a flaw and countered, “I've long heard of Xuan Tian Gong's sacred site. But even if I obtain the magical lingzhi, I wouldn't know where to wait for them. By the time we follow the lingzhi’s guidance, Xuan Tian Gong will have closed the site and left. How did you know the site was nearby beforehand? Did you bribe someone, or was this plotted three hundred years ago, or even earlier?”</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren smiled but said nothing.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng snorted but didn't press further.</p><p>The Black Dragon Ship, though seemingly massive, was incredibly agile and fast.</p><p>Soon after entering the storm zone, Hun Mo Lao Ren abruptly changed course, heading west.</p><p>Shortly after, everyone on board felt something and simultaneously looked upward.</p><p>Above them, a gigantic rift had appeared in the void, relentlessly devouring the surrounding hurricane and slowly expanding.</p><p>Like an ancient beast opening its maw to look down on a swarm of ants.</p><p>The astonishing sight left everyone stunned and speechless.</p><p>Simultaneously, Hun Mo Lao Ren and Tian Peng Da Sheng sensed something and looked ahead, towards the heart of the hurricane, following the extension of the rift.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren suddenly stopped the Black Dragon Ship.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng frowned slightly, pointing ahead. “The energy fluctuations there are strange.  The entrance to the sacred site should be ahead. Why stop here?”</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren looked up and said calmly, “A direct assault on the entrance would allow Xuan Tian Gong to prepare, and they would certainly use the terrain to their advantage. Even if we forced our way in, it would waste a lot of time. If Xuan Tian Gong were to fight to the death, the outcome would be unpredictable. Look at these dark clouds…”</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren pointed to a section of the rift.</p><p>Tian Peng Da Sheng followed his gaze.</p><p>He saw several thinner patches in the thick dark clouds, noticeably weaker than the surrounding areas.  It was likely possible to enter the sacred site from there, though resistance would still be significant.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren glanced back. “If we cooperate, we should manage it. Once inside the sacred site, it will be too late for Xuan Tian Gong to stop us.”</p><p>This proposal received unanimous agreement.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren retracted the Black Dragon Ship.  The Yuan Ying cultivators protected their disciples, forming a battle formation.</p>
