<h1>Chapter 1268: True Face</h1><p>The jade skeleton, pulled by the aura of the treasure, moved involuntarily, like an inanimate object. Shackles bound it, their aura still connected to the Blood Pool's seal. The crowd couldn't sense the skeleton's presence, unable to tell whether the ancient cultivator was trapped by the shackles or already dead.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>At that moment, Old Demon Ye and Qing Jun almost simultaneously flew out of the Blood Pool. Qing Jun rode out on her Azure Phoenix, the landscape of the Hidden Moon Diagram swirling around her. The puppet Azure Phoenix let out a series of angry cries. Jing Yu landed last, her feathers disheveled and her aura weak. She had expended a great deal of energy breaking the blood threads and had been injured in the battle. After dispelling the blood curse on the skeleton and obtaining the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, she rushed over to assist Qing Jun with her Thunder Beads, only to find that Old Demon Ye had already opened the cage and released the jade skeleton.</p><p>Old Demon Ye, the foremost figure of the North Star Realm, lived up to his reputation. Even with Qing Jun and Jing Yu joining forces, they couldn't gain the upper hand against him. Jing Yu dared not engage in close combat with the two, so she stayed on the periphery, unleashing her innate divine abilities to summon thunderbolts, striking at Old Demon Ye with lightning pillars.</p><p>Old Demon Ye fought against both of them. Wherever he passed, heavy snow fell, and the blood froze. Beside him, a white shadow, formed from the merging of several previous shadows, sometimes lashed out like a living creature, pouncing at Qing Jun to prevent her and the Azure Phoenix puppet from approaching the jade skeleton. At other times, it transformed into a mist of ice. Jing Yu's thunder pillars and Qing Jun's attacks were absorbed by the icy mist, unable to harm Old Demon Ye in the slightest.</p><p>The white shadow was a piece of Ten Thousand Year Profound Ice that Old Demon Ye had unintentionally obtained from the Abyss Ruins. It had been refined by ancient cultivators, and after years of contemplation, Old Demon Ye had found a way to utilize it. He secretly refined the Nascent Souls of others, merging them with the Profound Ice to create an Ice Demon. Although the Ice Demon appeared to be a puppet controlled by Old Demon Ye, its consciousness was chaotic, unable to act independently. It was more like a treasure, capable of both offense and defense, and had played a crucial role in breaking the seal earlier.</p><p>However, even with the Ice Demon, Old Demon Ye dared not ignore the attacks of Qing Jun and Jing Yu. Several times, he was forced to retreat when trying to approach the jade skeleton. The three of them were conflicted, wary of the jade skeleton yet also worried that it might be too fragile, destroyed by the aftermath of their battle, leaving them with nothing. Thus, they fought cautiously, moving from the depths of the Blood Pool to its surface.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Finally, one of the shackles on the jade skeleton was shattered by the residual energy of a treasure. The crowd's pupils constricted sharply. The jade skeleton swayed unsteadily in their vision, still showing no signs of revival.</p><p>Qing Jun let out a sharp cry, and the landscape of the Hidden Moon Diagram manifested in reality. Her expression remained calm as she gazed at the jade skeleton, silently reciting an incantation. A beam of moonlight illuminated the skeleton, and the moonlight opened a path for the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>"Screech!"</p><p>The Azure Phoenix let out a long cry, using the moonlight's power to swiftly pounce forward. Old Demon Ye's expression darkened as he also reached out to grab the jade skeleton. At this moment, there was still some distance between him and the skeleton. The Ice Demon transformed into a mist of ice, flying into his palm, then turned into a massive hand of Profound Ice, instantly appearing beneath the jade skeleton.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Blood Demon Avatar was struggling to hold on under the onslaught of the Demonic Fire. Qin Sang held nothing back, fully displaying the power of the Demonic Fire before everyone. The Blood Moon Wheel's blood light had been suppressed to its limit, barely protecting the Blood Demon Avatar. The blood light was as dim as a candle flame, nearly invisible in the sea of black fire. The blood light was on the verge of collapse, ready to shatter at any moment.</p><p>The three blood shadows, unable to dodge, had no chance to catch their breath, and their energy consumption was terrifying. Seeing that Qing Jun and Jing Yu were unharmed, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He knew that victory or defeat hung by a thread.</p><p>Looking at the Blood Demon Avatar desperately trying to block him, Qin Sang's eyes flashed with a cold light. He snorted, and the endless Demonic Fire suddenly converged toward the center, forming a fiery dragon that roared and charged forward.</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar's face showed a look of shock, realizing that it might not be able to withstand this attack. Old Demon Ye glanced over, his lips moving slightly.</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar's expression suddenly stiffened, and the three blood shadows rushed toward the center, merging into one. However, they did not return to their original form but instead became a fist-sized blood pearl, charging straight at Qin Sang instead of retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, sensing danger. Without hesitation, he summoned his Tortoise Shell Shield.</p><p>The next moment, an earth-shattering explosion erupted from the center of the Demonic Fire.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Old Demon Ye had detonated the Blood Demon Avatar!</p><p>The Demonic Fire was directly impacted, torn apart by the shockwave. In an instant, countless streams of Demonic Fire scattered in all directions, the waves of fire covering the sky. The Blood Demon Avatar and the blood pearl vanished, leaving the battlefield in chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Old Demon Ye to sacrifice his Blood Demon Avatar and was caught off guard. He and his Demonic Banner were engulfed by the rebounding Demonic Fire, their fate unknown.</p><p>The crowd's attention had been drawn to the struggle over the jade skeleton, but the brutal outcome of Qin Sang's battle with the Blood Demon Avatar shocked them. Old Demon Ye's Blood Demon Avatar, fighting alone against Qin Sang without any assistance, had been forced to self-destruct!</p><p>Everyone gained a new understanding of the power of the Demonic Fire and the strength of the Moonlight Demon King. Their faces showed fear, and some even wondered if the Feather Demon King had disguised himself.</p><p>The Cold Domain faction was both shocked and delighted. The self-destruction of Old Demon Ye's avatar was equivalent to cutting off one of his arms, severely weakening him. Even if they didn't reclaim the jade skeleton, their efforts were not in vain. However, they were worried about the Moonlight Demon King's condition. The center of the Demonic Fire was eerily silent. Had he perished in the explosion?</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Suddenly, the scattered Demonic Fire began to flow back. The scene at the center of the Demonic Fire was revealed to the crowd.</p><p>The eighteen Demonic Banners were askew. The Demonic Banner Formation had been impacted, but most of the damage had been absorbed by the Demonic Fire. Among the banners, a figure appeared behind the Tortoise Shell Shield. His breathing was ragged, his hair disheveled, and his face pale, but he still stood tall and unyielding!</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Someone noticed that the Moonlight Demon King's mask had disappeared, destroyed in the explosion of the Blood Demon Avatar, revealing his true face. Since his emergence, the Moonlight Demon King had always worn a mask. Seeing his true appearance, the crowd was puzzled. Although he looked unusually young, almost like a teenager, there was nothing strange about his features. Why had he hidden behind a mask, shrouding himself in mystery?</p><p>However, a few who had attended the Cangheng Island meeting felt a sense of familiarity upon seeing his face, suddenly recalling a past event. This man, named Qin Sang, had unexpectedly appeared, demanding the reward promised to him by the Two Realms Alliance two hundred years ago. He was originally a disciple of Shaohua Mountain but stood beside Leng Yuntian, also known as Qing Jun, and seemed to have some unresolved conflict with his ancestor, Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>"This man is a human cultivator, not a demon king. This is a blessing for our race, a blessing for the Cold Domain!"</p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p>...</p><p>These people were all shrewd, quickly understanding why Qin Sang had hidden his identity, and they were enlightened.</p>
