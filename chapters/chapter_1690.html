<h1>Chapter 1681:  Remains of a Transcendent Being</h1><p>Someone!</p><p>Entering the stone house, Qin Sang's eyes fell upon a figure facing the stone door.  His heart quickened, instantly alert.</p><p>"No living aura…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression relaxed slightly. He'd been mistaken.</p><p>The Witch Clan mark was clear: this person was the Transcendent Witch cultivator the Ghost Mother sought.  A Transcendent cultivator couldn't possibly live this long.</p><p>However, once connected to ancient demons, nothing could be judged by ordinary standards.</p><p>My main body can sense the outside situation through my avatar.  That demonic body radiates an overwhelming demonic aura; it's certainly not a cultivator. It's most likely an ancient demon sealed by the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect on Emperor's Summit Mountain, and far stronger than the Jade Bone Demon.</p><p>I'm truly cursed by ancient demons!</p><p>I still remember Elder Qingzhu falling at the hands of an ancient demon. Even now, Qin Sang deeply regrets it.</p><p>No amount of caution is too much.</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his protective罡火 (energy shield), observing carefully.</p><p>The corpse was remarkably well-preserved.</p><p>The person sat cross-legged, but appeared short and slightly hunched. Their face was gaunt, their eyes closed, their expression serene, like a man in his fifties.</p><p>They wore a brightly colored robe adorned with strange patterns and distorted designs. To human cultivators, it would seem quite bizarre.</p><p>But Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>In the Canglang Sea, Witch Clan cultivators, regardless of gender, often dressed similarly. Some even painted themselves with colorful oils or tattoos.</p><p>He felt no powerful aura from a Transcendent cultivator.  If he had encountered this person outside, he likely would have mistaken them for an ordinary person and ignored them.</p><p>Perhaps they had reached a state of returning to simplicity.</p><p>Or perhaps it was due to the nature of the remains.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense, scanning the body.  He confirmed it was indeed a corpse, and nothing more.</p><p>He straightened his posture, bowed to the corpse, and examined the surroundings. He noticed a spirit array beneath the body – clearly a Witch Clan secret formation.</p><p>There were no other markings or inscriptions.</p><p>This Transcendent Witch cultivator had perished here silently.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang looked at the corpse's waist. A small, fist-sized wooden gourd hung there, exquisitely carved and lifelike.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.  He used his Jin Chen sword to lift the gourd, supporting it with the blade while extending a thread of spiritual sense to examine it.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang's face lit up. As expected, it wasn't a magical treasure, but a magical artifact similar to a spatial pouch.</p><p>A Transcendent cultivator's relic!</p><p>The Ghost Mother used this to tempt him into taking the Mute Girl away.</p><p>He had actually obtained it.</p><p>Regardless of his current predicament, this was a significant gain and brought him some solace.</p><p>However, obtaining the relic wasn't easy.  Qin Sang sensed that the gourd contained restrictions left by the original owner; a careless move could prove disastrous.</p><p>Gazing at the gourd, Qin Sang fell into thought. He then looked up. Since he couldn't leave for the moment, he decided to focus on analyzing the restrictions.</p><p>The Sky Eye butterfly flew from his dantian and landed on his shoulder, its eyes fixated on the gourd, emitting a brilliant glow.</p><p>"It's a spiritual sense restriction…"</p><p>After a short time, Qin Sang murmured, his expression considerably more relaxed.</p><p>The spiritual sense restriction was formed by the Witch cultivator infusing a strand of their spiritual sense into it.  Since the cultivator's death, the spiritual energy in the restriction had weakened with time, making it relatively easy for Qin Sang to break.</p><p>With the Sky Eye butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang quickly understood the restriction's structure. Progress accelerated, and soon he was confident.  He transformed his spiritual sense into a needle and pierced the gourd.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A green light illuminated Qin Sang's face, bathing him and the entire cave in green.</p><p>When the light subsided, the gourd had transformed.  Its material had become jade, crystal clear and translucent.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly extended his spiritual sense into the gourd, then looked surprised.  A green light shot from the mouth of the gourd, drawing something out with spiritual energy.</p><p>A half-moon shaped stone slab!</p><p>Its surface was rough and scarred, covered in chaotic marks, making it impossible to decipher any pattern.</p><p>It looked like an ordinary stone, but its placement within the gourd's space was unique.  The Transcendent Witch cultivator seemed to have highly valued this item.</p><p>From the stone platform, Qin Sang sensed a familiar fluctuation.</p><p>Not only that, but the platform's shape was also strangely familiar.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand, and another stone platform appeared in his palm.</p><p>He had always called it the Star Platform. He had seized it from a Wu cultivator in Lan Dou Gate.  Breaking through the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" had relied entirely on it channeling stellar energy into his body.</p><p>The two platforms were remarkably similar, differing only in the subtle details of their surface patterns; their overall shape was almost identical!</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>The familiarity stemmed from the new platform's almost identical energy signature to his old Star Platform—it was another Star Platform!</p><p>The old Star Platform had absorbed a sufficient amount of stellar energy at Zhi Tian Peak, undergoing a transformation. Although it had returned to its ancient appearance, it possessed an indescribable aura.</p><p>This new Star Platform also held this aura, the Wu cultivator having already infused it with sufficient stellar energy.</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands together.</p><p>Clearly, the two Star Platforms could be perfectly joined to form a complete, circular platform.</p><p>It was obvious they were once a single entity, somehow splitting apart and becoming separated.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  This explained why, in the years since the Star Platform's transformation at Zhi Tian Peak, it had remained unresponsive to his attempts—the treasure had been incomplete!</p><p>One half had been brought by him to Bei Chen Realm, the other by the Wu cultivator to Zhongzhou.</p><p>By a stroke of luck, he had now reunited them.</p><p>Qin Sang separated his hands, not intending to join the platforms there. He hadn't forgotten the Star Platform's ability to directly draw stellar energy from the cosmos.</p><p>A complete platform would undoubtedly unleash a much greater power.</p><p>If he couldn't control it, he risked revealing his location, which would be disastrous.</p><p>He recalled obtaining the first Star Platform from Black Serpent Mountain, wresting it from the jaws of danger. Black Serpent Mountain's ancestor had once sent a true disciple to infiltrate Lan Dou Gate to steal this treasure.</p><p>Now, the Wu cultivator had also highly valued it, carrying it with them.</p><p>It was clear that the Star Platform was an extraordinary treasure of the Wu clan.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't overly excited by having reunited the platforms.</p><p>The more precious a treasure, the more limitations it possessed, such as spirit treasures, let alone the huge difference between the two clans' bloodlines. Wu treasures might not offer him much benefit. If it helped him quickly advance in the "Heavenly Demon Transformation," he would be satisfied.</p><p>Dismissing such thoughts, Qin Sang stored both Star Platforms in his Qian Jun Ring before checking the other treasures within the gourd.</p><p>His previous assessment proved correct.</p><p>The Wu cultivator's remains held many precious treasures, but those artificially refined all bore strong Wu markings.</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea Wu clan's legacy was incomplete, borrowing heavily from human practices. Qin Sang could only barely discern the uses of these treasures, concluding that most would be unusable.</p><p>However, some treasures were recorded in the "Pan Hu True Scripture."</p><p>Having obtained this scripture from Gui Mu, Qin Sang hadn't had time to study it thoroughly. He would have to cultivate this method in the future to further enhance his Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Regardless of whether he recognized them, Qin Sang collected them all.</p><p>Finally, only miscellaneous items, a pile of spirit stones, and a jade box remained.</p><p>From the jade box, Qin Sang felt an extremely pleasant energy.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The jade box opened.</p><p>A faint blue light shone forth, extremely dense spiritual energy practically surging out like a tangible tide.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively took a deep breath, his breathing becoming lighter.</p><p>Inside the box was a water-attribute spirit stone, purer than any he had ever seen.  Tiny vortices of spiritual energy swirled on its surface, forming a stream of the purest water-attribute spiritual energy.</p><p>"A top-grade spirit stone!"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He had heard of top-grade spirit stones, but this was his first time seeing one.</p><p>He was a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, and a former sect leader who had travelled extensively. That illustrated just how rare top-grade spirit stones were.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones were already exceptionally rare in the cultivation world, and transactions between Nascent Soul cultivators weren't always barter-based; high-grade spirit stones often served as currency.</p><p>Many situations called for high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>However, nobody used top-grade spirit stones as currency; they were regarded as incredibly precious treasures.</p><p>Excavating an enormous spirit stone vein might not even yield a single top-grade spirit stone.</p><p>Top-grade spirit stones were not only essential for some ancient immortal formations, but also possessed extraordinary significance for cultivators.  Their spiritual energy was so pure that it could be directly converted into true essence without refinement.</p><p>Improving cultivation efficiency and saving time on arduous training were undeniably important.</p><p>A high-grade spirit stone, if obtained when one is on the verge of death, could be lifesaving, unlike the Boiling Snow Pill which carries severe side effects.</p><p>Of course, these two treasures cannot be simply compared. Absorbing a high-grade spirit stone takes time, while the Boiling Snow Pill instantly transforms into immense True Yuan.</p><p>Those who obtain a spirit stone compatible with their attributes consider it a precious treasure and would rarely trade it.</p><p>Qin Sang's five-elemental roots proved advantageous here. He could use all five types of spirit stones, and the *Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter* had no elemental requirements.</p><p>He gazed at the spirit stone in the jade box, reluctant to let it go. He tried to draw a trace into his body and found the sensation vastly different from before, astonishing him.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>the stone hut violently shook.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang quickly put away his belongings and extended his spiritual sense. Outside the hut, the five-elemental divine prohibitions were in utter chaos, seemingly originating from the center of the seal.</p><p>He then saw through his avatar that a demonic body burst out of the mountain, exuding terrifying demonic power.</p><p>Witnessing this, Qin Sang pondered, "I wonder how strong this ancient demon is? If the ancient demon can hold the two Nascent Soul cultivators back, preventing them from interfering, I might have a chance to escape..."</p><p>On the other hand, Qin Sang worried about the ancient demon being too powerful.</p><p>The number of Nascent Soul cultivators now is far less than the former Wuxiang Immortal Sect. If the Central Plains falls to the demonic calamity, even if he escapes back to the North Sea, can he truly remain unaffected?</p><p>…</p><p>High above,</p><p>the Qinghu Saint King spoke, but her actions were swift.</p><p>She was well aware of the significance of this ancient demon, possibly the only one remaining in this realm.</p><p>Her three long tails gently swayed.</p><p>Tilting her head slightly, the vixen's face displayed a saintly aura.  The chaotic sky above the legacy mansion then calmed, becoming unprecedentedly serene.</p><p>The next moment, a cool moonlight descended.</p><p>A moon appeared in the sky, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>It was undoubtedly an illusion, but no one could detect any flaws, believing it was the real moon piercing through the formation and shining into the legacy mansion.</p><p>The moonlight illuminated only one person.</p><p>Bathed in the moonlight, the Qinghu Saint King's robes fluttered, her demeanor cold and elegant, like a celestial maiden from the moon palace, performing a graceful bow to the moon.</p><p>A fox worshipping the moon!</p><p>The next moment, a moon, large as a silver disc, appeared above the demonic body.  The moonlight, like water, merged with the tidal waters below, becoming one.</p><p>Everyone saw the celestial and terrestrial waters connecting, a dreamlike scene, seemingly forming a barrier that sealed the demonic body and everyone within.</p><p>The demonic body, at the center, felt immense pressure, its roars growing increasingly frenzied.</p><p>Seeing the Qinghu Saint King's action, the doubts of Fan Laomo and others lessened.</p><p>At this time, the Hui Guang Saint spoke again, "To suppress the ancient demon, I will join all of you in exploring the legacy mansion. The treasures within, excluding the scriptures, will belong to those who are destined.  Beyond that…"</p><p>He glanced at everyone, taking out a jade bottle, "Those who make great contributions in this battle, I have a separate reward."</p><p>The jade bottle in Hui Guang Saint's hand attracted everyone's attention.</p><p>Inside was a strangely colored pill, resembling a failed alchemy product.</p><p>Even the widely experienced Fan Laomo immediately recognized it, his face showing shock and dawning realization.</p><p>Noticing Fan Laomo's reaction, everyone was curious.</p><p>The situation was urgent, so Hui Guang Saint didn't play coy, "This is the Five Elements Pill. You must have heard legends of this pill. After the fall of the Wuwang Hall, this pill disappeared from the cultivation world. As its name suggests, when one is at the threshold of Nascent Soul, taking this pill allows instantaneous attunement with Heaven's Dao, to a certain extent mimicking the effects of five-elemental roots…"</p><p>Qinghu Saint King glanced at Hui Guang Saint, a hint of irony flashing in her eyes.</p><p>"Five Elements Pill!"</p><p>"Wuwang Hall!"</p><p>…</p><p>So the Nascent Soul cultivators were truly trapped in the Wuwang Hall!</p><p>Upon learning the origin of this pill, everyone except Qin Sang's avatar was moved. Even Hegao Zhenren's gaze was captivated by the pill.</p><p>They knew that celestial resonance was the key to Nascent Soul ascension.</p><p>While secret techniques and treasures existed to supplement one's elemental roots, most could only supplement one element. The Five Elements Pill might be slightly weaker than a single element type but could simultaneously supplement all five, providing far greater assistance than other treasures!</p><p>Everyone stared intently at the pill in the jade bottle, no longer finding it ugly.</p><p>Great rewards attract brave warriors.</p><p>Yet they were all battle-hardened and not easily swayed by rewards.</p><p>The old bald monk dared to offer such a precious pill as an incentive, showing how dangerous the demonic body was, that the pill had to be bought with one's life!</p><p>But no one could deny the immense temptation of the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>Legend held that the Five Elements Pill was the top-tier elixir for Nascent Soul breakthrough, perhaps even surpassing the Immortal Palace's Sword Tomb.</p><p>Among those present, probably only Qin Sang could resist the temptation of the Five Elements Pill.</p><p>However, the appearance of the Five Elements Pill gave Qin Sang a sudden idea.</p><p>His avatar approached Mo Xingdao, "Daoist Mo, if I obtain the Five Elements Pill, can I exchange it for the Lingxi Immortal Fruit?"</p>
