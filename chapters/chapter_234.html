<h1>Chapter 227 Stele</h1><p>Chapter 227 Stele</p><p>Qin Sang sorted out his belongings and carried them all with him, including the Fire Jade Centipede. </p><p>It was only after he made sure that there were no marks left by others on the Fire Jade Centipede and after he bought a new spirit beast bag that he dared to do so. Qin Sang was not sure if the mark dissipated because Yin Xingge died or if there was no mark to begin with. </p><p>He had heard that this strange insect was difficult to recognize as its master, unless cultivation began when it was in the egg form. Generally, it could only be driven using the Insect Control technique. Qin Sang learned the most superficial Insect Control technique, which was barely enough to control the Fire Jade Centipede. Only, he had to keep the Fire Jade Centipede within a certain range. </p><p>After flying out of the vortex, the first thing he saw was a giant dragon chariot! </p><p>The shape of the chariot was a little strange. It did not look much different from a mortal's carriage, it was square, there were no decorations on it, and it was very crude. </p><p>Oddly enough, the body and the four sides of the chariot were made of clouds and mist, and not of a solid material. </p><p>Three Flood Dragons were tied up with a wisp of clouds and mist, pulling the chariot in front. The clouds and mist appeared very thin and weak, yet they were able to bind the three Flood Dragons tightly. </p><p>Among them were one White Flood Dragon and two Azure Flood Dragons. Their forms were like a serpent, and they had four claws and scales. There were no horns on their heads, only a bump. It seemed as though a single horn could grow out at any time. </p><p>The Flood Dragons bared their fangs and claws, their eyes were fierce and their expressions were ferocious. </p><p>The clouds and mist around their bodies were faint, as if they were walking on clouds. </p><p>The three Flood Dragons gave Qin Sang a strange feeling. Careful observation revealed that they were neither beasts nor beasts, and just like the chariot, they gave him a strange sense of unreality. But the ferocity and the coercion they brought with them were real and comparable to that of a master at the False Core realm. </p><p>In other words, these evil Flood Dragons were most likely at the peak of the Monster Spirit realm, and were about to form a Monster Core and enter the Monster Core realm as great monsters! </p><p>Staring at the three Flood Dragons' cold gazes, everyone was trembling with fear, standing still beside the chariot, not daring to move. </p><p>Even these evil Flood Dragons could be subdued as mounts, and there were three of them. This was the strength of a Golden Core Master! </p><p>Standing in the crowd, Qin Sang felt very envious in his heart. </p><p>After everyone came out, Xuan Yu's voice came from the chariot, "Come up." </p><p>Before the sound of his voice faded, the clouds and mist on the chariot suddenly rolled over. Qin Sang only felt a lightness beneath him and he was already inside the chariot. </p><p>The next moment, the reins of the chariot suddenly tightened. The evil Flood Dragons roared up to the sky, their long tails suddenly swung, and the chariot turned into a beam of flowing light, sliding through the sky at an astonishing speed, and disappearing at the end of the field of vision in the blink of an eye. </p><p>Through the clouds and mist, Qin Sang could clearly see the desolate scene below receding rapidly. The speed was astonishing, and his body did not feel the slightest bump. </p><p>Having a Golden Core Master with him, and not having to worry about safety, Qin Sang watched for a while before sitting cross-legged on the ground to adjust his condition and prepare for the upcoming secret realm journey. </p><p>He did not know how long had passed before Qin Sang suddenly felt the chariot beneath him shake gently and woke up from meditation, opening his eyes. </p><p>He saw that the chariot had dissipated into a wisp of clouds and mist, and the three dragons had also rapidly shrunk, disappearing into the clouds and mist. Finally, this wisp of clouds and mist twisted, as if it had turned into a text-like form, and was then taken into the palm of an old man in a Taoist robe, and then disappeared. </p><p>This old man was Xuan Yu. </p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang secretly wondered, could the dragon chariot be a magic tool? </p><p>It was already late at night, and the light was dim. Qin Sang opened his eyes wide to look around, and found that there was a vast plain in front of them, on which there were countless broken stones. They seemed to be in a mess, but upon closer inspection, he could see that these broken stones had their own rules, forming a rather inconspicuous ring shape. </p><p>In the middle of the ring-shaped rubble area, it was as if there were a black hole, and all the light was absorbed by the black hole, causing the space there to look a little distorted. </p><p>At this time, four figures were suspended around the black hole, separated into four directions. </p><p>One of them was Che Yutao, the familiar Car Master Uncle Che, whom Qin Sang knew. Qin Sang had never met the other three people, but their auras were all similar to Che Yutao's, showing that they were all Golden Core Masters. </p><p>Including Xuan Yu who had just arrived, there were actually five Golden Core Masters gathered! </p><p>At this time, the four Golden Core Masters suddenly attacked the black hole together. </p><p>Che Yutao was in the due west, holding a Red Dust Gourd and spraying out a rainbow light. </p><p>In the due north was a woman in a palace dress. She pulled out the Phoenix Jade Hairpin on her head and gently tapped it inward. A phantom of a phoenix flew out from it and plunged into the black hole. </p><p>In the east was a middle-aged scholar. He held up a round-shaped treasure mirror and shot out a beam of mirror light.</p><p>The most extraordinary person standing to the south was an old man. As a Daoist at the stage of Golden Elixir, one of his legs was broken. For unknown reasons, he did not repair his body. He was leaning on a crutch, standing still. After the other three people took action, he suddenly opened his mouth. A visible soundwave spread out like ripples in water.</p><p>The four attacks fell on the black hole at the same time, but they were all silently absorbed by the black hole.</p><p>The four slightly frowned, then their faces changed. They all flew backwards together.</p><p>In the next moment, a ball of black light suddenly burst out from the black hole. It seemed like it was angered by those people. The black light fiercely rushed out and engulfed all directions. It reached the edge of the rubble zone before it was blocked by unknown power and retracted.</p><p>Then the black light disappeared together with the black hole. That place looked like a pile of rubble, with no strangeness at all.</p><p>However, in the moment when the black light erupted, they could vaguely see an antiquated stone tablet within the black hole. The space was bent, so they were unable to tell the size of the stone tablet.</p><p>But on the stone tablet, the mottled traces left by long years were clearly visible, exuding a sense of antiquity.</p><p>The four people stood at the edge of the rubble zone, calmly watching the black light rush in front of them. They were very close and then it retracted. It was obvious that it was not the first time they had done this.</p><p>The woman in palace dress said in a deep voice: "Several attempts have failed. It seems that forcefully breaking the ban is unfeasible. We can only follow the rules set by the ban, and then send people to try it one by one."</p><p>"Luckily, the old nitpicker brought people here..."</p><p>A ball of red light flashed in Che Yutao's palm. The red jade gourd suddenly shrank, automatically hanging on his waist. He then turned his head and looked at it. He jokingly said loudly, "The old nitpicker knows how to slack off and watch a play. Why don't you let these young people come over?"</p><p>Elder Xuan Yu waved his long sleeve and brought people to the edge of the rubble zone. He said, "I am an old Taoist who worked hard to get here. I have contributed and toiled. You say I slack off..."</p><p>Che Yutao's eyes swept over the crowd, and he said in a deep voice: "You twenty seven people are divided into three groups, with nine people in each group. You decide how to divide it."</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. Under the command of Daoist seniors, they did not dare to hesitate. Brothers and sisters of the same school subconsciously gathered together.</p><p>The most people came from Mt. Shaohua. Qin Sang, Mu Yifeng, and Yu Daiyue stood together with two other senior brothers.</p><p>Yun Qiong and her fellow Taoist, as well as two acquaintances, came over. She had once worked with Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng, so she persuaded her friends to join.</p>
