<h1>Chapter 1556:  The Spirit-Subduing Realm, Yitian Peak</h1><p>Chapter 1556:  The Spirit-Subduing Realm, Yitian Peak</p><p>“The Poison Valley is vast; it stretches far inward.  The terrain isn’t just a monotonous desert…”</p><p>Ning Wuhuidrew out a jade vial and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>“The poison within Poison Valley is colorless and odorless, very difficult to detect. You’ll be affected before you even realize it. This vial contains Snow Toad Pills; they’re an antidote.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and opened the vial.</p><p>The pills were snow-white, but he smelled a pungent aroma.</p><p>“The deeper you go into Poison Valley, the stronger the poison becomes. Initially, you can use your spiritual energy to resist it, but later you’ll need antidotal treasures; otherwise, you won’t be able to move an inch.  You must have made preparations, right?”</p><p>Ning Wuhuinquired.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>After his exchange with Ning Wuhuimany years ago, he had been preparing ever since.  Although he had the Fat Silkworm’s anti-poison armor as a precaution, he still purchased several antidotal treasures and pills when he passed Tianxing City.</p><p>However, the quality of his antidotal pills was certainly inferior to the Snow Toad Pills.</p><p>Ning Wuhuinodded slightly, brought out a magic treasure to protect himself against the potent poison, and said with some apprehension, “If you feel anything unusual, if the poison invades you, take a Snow Toad Pill immediately. I have a few more antidotal treasures here that should suffice…”</p><p>“Thank you for the warning, I understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Fat Silkworm and tucked it inside his inner armor.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, clutching a poisonous algae fruit, was happily munching away, completely unconcerned with Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>The anti-poison armor’s power was undeniable, but to prevent the Fat Silkworm from overexerting itself, Qin Sang didn’t plan to have it use its armor for a while. He could handle things on his own.</p><p>Then, he took out a purchased antidotal pearl and put it in his mouth. Once activated, a transparent, invisible water-like layer formed around his body.</p><p>Having made their preparations, the two entered Poison Valley.</p><p>Initially, they felt nothing. After a while, the effects of the poison began to manifest, and the antidotal pearl started working.</p><p>They had expected the Night Owl to have escaped from Poison Valley after being severely injured, anticipating some upheaval.  Unexpectedly, they found no signs of chaos after entering.</p><p>Perhaps the path they chose was too secluded.</p><p>Regardless, avoiding trouble was always a good thing.</p><p>Ning Wuhuiformed his external Nascent Soul and didn’t dare to act recklessly in Poison Valley.  Those who could reach this place were basically Nascent Soul masters, and they were the weakest among them.</p><p>Every so often, Ning Wuhuireleased his external Nascent Soul to scout ahead.  Even the slightest anomaly would cause them to detour. Qin Sang followed closely behind Ning Wuhuisecretly using his Celestial Eye to maintain vigilance.</p><p>With every step forward, the poison in the air intensified.</p><p>The antidotal pearl was beginning to falter.  A faint grayish-black haze appeared on the water-like layer around Qin Sang's body; the poison was about to break through the barrier, and the pearl’s glow was dimming.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared new antidotal treasures.  Sensing the pearl's imminent failure, he replaced it.</p><p>They proceeded in this stop-and-go manner, venturing deeper and deeper into Poison Valley.</p><p>Ning Wuhuishowed no signs of stopping.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that as they journeyed, the terrain of Poison Valley gradually, but steadily, rose, like a vast slope.</p><p>The ground, initially a desert-like expanse of gravel and stones, was becoming harder, with exposed rocks and sharp edges.</p><p>“Daoist Ning, how much longer?”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>They had traveled so far, enough to traverse the Purple Mist Wasteland, yet the end of Poison Valley remained unseen.</p><p>Ning Wuhuiremained tight-lipped.  Initially, he only informed Qin Sang of their Poison Valley trip and instructed him to prepare antidotal items. All other secrets were withheld.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had sought out Ning Wuhuifol­lowing Qingzhu Elder’s instructions, he had no token of identification.  Ning Wuhuialready being willing to bring him along was fortunate.</p><p>He suspected that Ning Wuhuimight be a contingency left by Qingzhu Elder to suppress the incarnation of a demonic soul; the matter was of great importance, so he hadn’t pressed for answers.</p><p>Ning Wuhuistoped, gazing into the distance. After a moment, he said, “This is only the middle section of Poison Valley. We need to reach the deepest part.”</p><p>“The deepest part?”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. That was the furthest point the human cultivation world could currently explore, and they were going there.</p><p>What was Elder Qingzhu planning, and what was its connection to the ancient teleportation array?</p><p>“Correct,” Ning Wuhuinodded, then changed the subject. “Deep inside Poison Valley lies an area called the Spirit-Subduing Realm. Have you heard of it?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said helplessly, “No. I only interact with Foundation Establishment cultivators, and I’ve inquired with them. Very few Foundation Establishment cultivators have ever been to Poison Valley, let alone its deepest reaches, the Spirit-Subduing Realm.”</p><p>Ning Wuhuai wasn't surprised.  He explained, "The Zhen Ling area is a peculiar place.  Whether it's an ancient hidden formation or something else, cultivators who enter feel a strange suppression. It's said only powerful cultivators, at least at the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage, can resist it and enter. Others can only watch from afar."</p><p>"Such a place exists?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized something. "Friend Ning, are you going into the Zhen Ling area?"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai nodded. "Friend Qin, don't worry. I know another path, one that allows us to avoid the Zhen Ling area's effects."</p><p>"Another path…"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, realizing this path must have been shown to Ning Wuhuai by Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>So many Yuan Ying masters in the Cang Lang Sea didn't know this secret, yet Elder Qingzhu found it.  It seems Elder Qingzhu understands the Seven Killing Hall better than anyone imagined.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai offered a brief explanation, then fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang could only suppress his curiosity and follow Ning Wuhuai.</p><p>They continued for an unknown distance.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai suddenly changed direction, no longer following the edge, but veering towards the center of the valley. After a while, Qin Sang noticed the valley's terrain changing.</p><p>Rolling hills transformed into mountains, still barren stone mountains.</p><p>The mountain shadows ahead became denser and taller.</p><p>The roars of ferocious beasts echoed between the mountains.</p><p>They climbed mountain after mountain.</p><p>They stood atop a mountain as high as those flanking the valley.</p><p>Peaks rose all around, some appearing forested from afar, but the vegetation had long turned to stone.</p><p>"We've finally reached Yi Tian Peak!"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai pointed towards a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the indicated direction, seeing an unprecedentedly majestic peak, standing tall among the others, piercing the clouds, its height lost in the celestial prohibitions.</p><p>In terms of height, Yi Tian Peak was probably comparable to the Outer Hall's Heavenly Tower!</p><p>"Yi Tian Peak is in the heart of the Zhen Ling area.  Seeing it means the Zhen Ling area is close!" Ning Wuhuai breathed a sigh of relief; the journey had been intensely demanding.</p><p>"What's the next step?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked urgently.</p><p>"Follow me," Ning Wuhuai leaped down the mountain.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I owe two chapters.</p><p>The plot is at its most critical point.  Now I need to figure out how to write out the plot in my head completely and avoid making it messy. My experience is lacking, it's a bit strenuous, so I'm deliberating every sentence, which makes my writing speed incredibly slow.</p><p>Rest assured, I always keep my word. Even if I can't finish this volume, I'll definitely make up for it in the next one! (≧∇≦)/</p>
