<h1>Chapter 418: Sword Qi and Thunderous Sound</h1><p>After a brief pause, the silver-robed man raised his arm. From his palm flew ten small, sinister ghost banners. With practiced ease, he arranged them into the Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>He set up the formation swiftly. The ghost banners crisscrossed, and the formation was completed in an instant.</p><p>Black flames ignited but were immediately suppressed by the silver-robed man's hand, dissipating with a rumble. The ten ghost banners floated in the air, and a terrifying, devouring darkness pervaded the formation, but all fluctuations were perfectly concealed by the silver-robed man.</p><p>Next, with a wave of his arm, the silver-robed man withdrew the Ten Yama Formation into his sleeve, his figure melting into the shadows as he silently approached the mountains.</p><p>Shortly after, the silver-robed man arrived at the foot of a solitary peak.</p><p>The peak was as sharp as a sword, exceptionally steep and a rare sight in this vast, gentle mountain range.</p><p>The spiritual energy here wasn't particularly dense, but this wasn't unusual.  Some places concealed their spiritual veins, their true richness hidden unless carefully investigated.</p><p>The silver-robed man tightly sealed his aura, his gaze sweeping across the solitary peak before settling on an inconspicuous grey stone halfway up the slope.</p><p>In the next moment, the silver-robed man appeared before the grey stone. He stared intently at it for a moment, a mocking smile appearing on his face. With a flick of his sleeve, the Ten Yama Formation spun out, the ghost banners unfurling in the wind.</p><p>Instantly, the Ten Yama banners transformed into enormous flags, each ten feet tall. They plunged directly into the mountain, encircling the grey stone. The flags fluttered, countless malevolent spirits seeming to emerge from within, spectral ribbons swirling amidst the black flames, blotting out the sky and the sun.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The black flames exploded, surging layer upon layer towards the grey stone in the center.</p><p>A flash of purple restrictive light shimmered on the grey stone, but it was instantly overwhelmed by the endless black flames.</p><p>A muffled sound echoed.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The grey stone shattered, revealing a deep opening. Among the flying debris, remnants of the restrictive spell could still be seen, forcibly broken!</p><p>The silver-robed man remained cautious, standing behind the formation. He extended a wisp of divine sense, constantly vigilant of his surroundings.</p><p>He turned his gaze towards the depths of the opening.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The passage darkened abruptly. Then, a black, fluid-like substance surged out—identical to the black flames outside.</p><p>Within the black flames, another Ten Yama Formation stood already deployed. And within this formation, a shadowy figure flickered.</p><p>"The Ten Yama Formation!"</p><p>The black flames obscured the figure's face, but the silver-robed man could clearly sense a gaze piercing him from within, carrying a bone-chilling coldness that sent shivers down his spine. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>A trap!</p><p>In an instant, numerous thoughts flashed through the silver-robed man's mind.</p><p>Who possessed another set of Ten Yama banners? Could it be one of his treacherous "fellow disciples," targeting him?</p><p>Which one?</p><p>Very few in his sect knew this venomous Gu technique, and even fewer survived.</p><p>The silver-robed man abruptly extended his divine sense, but finding no other ambushers, he felt a slight relief. Then a cruel smile appeared on his face as he unhesitatingly activated the Heart-Devouring Gu.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Unexpectedly, the figure opposite remained perfectly still, not even flinching, let alone screaming.</p><p>The silver-robed man's expression froze, contorted into a strange grimace.</p><p>He had a premonition that anyone bold enough to lay a trap and lure him in would have a way to counter the Heart-Devouring Gu. Killing him with the Gu alone was unlikely.</p><p>But he only needed the Gu to take effect, hindering the opponent's movements. Even if they knew how to dispel the Gu, it wouldn't be instantaneous.  Any vulnerability exposed would be exploited, allowing him to turn the tables and make his opponent regret their actions.</p><p>However, the silver-robed man hadn't anticipated the Gu having no effect whatsoever on the opponent.</p><p>At the same time, he suddenly noticed something amiss about the black flames flowing from the passage. Behind them, a deeper, more profound flame emanated an aura that made him tremble.</p><p>Sensing this terrifying aura, a flash of inspiration struck the silver-robed man. His pupils dilated in sudden horror as he exclaimed,</p><p>"Nine Nether Demonic Flame! A magical treasure!"</p><p>Of the five sets of Ten Yama banners passed down by their ancestor, aside from the one held by their master, the whereabouts of the others were unknown. They had suspected they had fallen into the hands of the Yuanzhao Sect, but unexpectedly, they appeared here.</p><p>What was this person's identity?</p><p>The silver-robed man was filled with questions, but he had no desire to seek answers. At this moment, he was certain this was a trap targeting him. The opponent possessed a magical treasure, and their strength far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Fortunately, there was only one of them!</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Flame advanced with astonishing speed, about to burst from the opening and engulf him.</p><p>Through their connection, the silver-robed man could sense his own Ten Yama Formation trembling, the main spirits within the banners screaming in terror.</p><p>The situation was dire.</p><p>With a twitch of his eye, a pained expression flashed across the silver-robed man's face. He made a decisive move, slamming his palm onto the Ten Yama Formation. His spiritual sea churned, squeezing out every last bit of spiritual power into the formation. The black flames surged, and he forcefully extracted the main spirits, driving them into the black flames.</p><p>Then, he manipulated the black flames, launching them without reservation towards the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, like a moth to a flame.</p><p>After this, his face pale, he didn't even glance at the Ten Yama Formation, choosing to abandon this powerful formation. He turned, stomped his foot, and transformed into a streak of blood-colored light, fleeing at top speed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The black flames of the Ten Yama Formation were shattered by the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, and all the main spirits within were annihilated. The ten ghost banners trembled violently, shattering into nothingness.</p><p>As the Nine Nether Demonic Flame dissipated, a figure emerged from the cave. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>He stood at the entrance, gazing towards the horizon. The blood-colored streak of light was astonishingly fast, nearly disappearing from view.</p><p>The silver-robed man was clearly fleeing with all his might.</p><p>His caution and decisiveness were unlike anything Qin Sang had ever witnessed. Even with the advantage of the Heart-Devouring Gu, he had prepared the formation in advance, foiling Qin Sang's ambush. When danger approached, he didn't hesitate to abandon the Ten Yama Formation to buy himself time to escape.</p><p>No wonder this man had earned the favor of Daoist Jiu Pao, becoming his direct disciple, and had managed to not only survive the Yuanzhao Sect's pursuit but also successfully cultivate to the Pseudo Core Realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, all his efforts were in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the escaping streak of light, a cold smile on his face. With a thought, a green glow flew from between his eyebrows, circling before him and hovering, revealing its true form.</p><p>An exquisitely crafted small sword.</p><p>This sword was Qin Sang's natal spirit sword—the Ebony Sword!</p><p>The Ebony Sword's form hadn't changed much, except its blade had become more translucent and clear, without a single impurity, resembling glazed glass.</p>
