Chapter 629: Refining with Demonic Fire (Bonus chapter for league leader Yuesheng's mom Jingjing!)

Not all souls retain their sentience. The soul-refining demonic artifacts Qin Sang found in the ancient cultivator's ruins had long lost their spiritual essence.

The Ghost Banners seized from the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect were made from recently harvested souls, which made it possible for some sentience to remain.

Ultimately, Qin Sang released the souls that still had some awareness, extracting the pure soul energy from all the Ghost Banners and refining it into threads to repair his magical treasures.

Three Ten Yama Banners hovered in the air, forming a banner formation, slowly rotating before Qin Sang.

In the center of the treasures, black demonic fire coalesced.

With the three banners forming a formation, the power of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire more than doubled, possessing the might of a mid-grade magical treasure. This was no exaggeration.

However, the demands on the cultivator were also higher!

Although they were part of the same banner formation and closely connected, eliminating the need for divided attention, simultaneously controlling three treasures placed a significant burden on the cultivator.

When using the Nine Nether Demonic Fire against enemies, the consumption of True Essence was extremely fast, and the demands on the cultivator's divine sense were exceptionally high.

Qin Sang had a Corpse Pill to supplement his True Essence, allowing him to sustain it for a longer period.

However, due to his insufficient cultivation and weak divine sense, it was still very strenuous.

Qin Sang tried to activate the banner formation, and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fire dragon, roaring out from the formation.  Suddenly, with a 'crack', the fire dragon collapsed, the demonic fire scattering and filling the entire cave.

The banners trembled, their surfaces fluttering wildly.

Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly withdrew the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.

"Several attempts have failed. I must practice diligently in the future and master the banner formation as soon as possible. After all, this will be my trump card for a long time to come."

Qin Sang murmured.

Then, he stored two of the Ten Yama Banners into his Qianjun Ring and retrieved the body of the cave's original owner, the Black-winged Eagle.

This was a mid-Spirit Severing Stage great demon. Its iron feathers still carried an untamed aura even in death.

Demon beast corpses could be used to refine magical artifacts.

For Qin Sang, the Black-winged Eagle's cultivation was too low. Even if it were refined into an artifact, he wouldn't value it.  Qin Sang planned to use this demonic corpse to refine Soul-Devouring Cones.

The Soul-Devouring Cone was something shopkeeper Wu taught him in the Asking Moon Market.  It was a single-use artifact, very effective in the early Foundation Establishment stage, but its usefulness diminished as cultivation increased.

Qin Sang rarely refined them anymore.

He happened to have a Black-winged Eagle corpse. If refined properly, he should be able to obtain two Soul-Devouring Cones.

Qin Sang kept one Ten Yama Banner, firstly to experiment with whether the Nine Nether Demonic Fire could be used for refining, and secondly, to refine Soul-Devouring Cones for Ya Gu's protection.

That was assuming Ya Gu possessed spiritual roots and could cultivate.

Two Soul-Devouring Cones were enough to guarantee Ya Gu's safety before the Foundation Establishment stage, a way for Qin Sang to repay her for saving his life.

The Nine Nether Demonic Fire flew out of the Ten Yama Banner, floating before Qin Sang. Under his control, it constantly changed, sometimes converging, sometimes dispersing, finally gathering into a ball.

Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, sensing the aura of the flames, attempting to manipulate the demonic fire with refining techniques.

The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was a rare and unique flame. If it could be used for refining, it would be more efficient than alchemical fire, and the success rate of refining would also be higher. This was an advantage other refiners didn't possess.

With the Flying Night Devil guarding the entrance, Qin Sang could focus on sensing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.

Unconsciously, an entire night passed.

At dawn, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze falling on the demonic corpse beside him.  With a wave of his hand, his True Essence transformed into a claw, grabbing the corpse and throwing it into the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.

A wave rippled through the demonic fire, then gradually stabilized.

Qin Sang stared intently at the demonic corpse within the demonic fire, his expression slightly tense.  Then he saw the iron feathers on the Black-winged Eagle melt away, seemingly incinerated by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, leaving behind only two drops of ink-black molten iron.

Within the molten iron resided an extremely violent demonic Qi, but it was firmly sealed within by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.

Qin Sang's expression relaxed, a smile appearing on his lips. The formation of these two drops of molten iron indicated that his prediction was correct. He could indeed use the Nine Nether Demonic Fire for refining.

Then, without hesitation, Qin Sang boldly proceeded to refine the demonic corpse.

In a short time, the large demonic corpse was completely incinerated by the demonic fire, and two palm-sized black horns, shaped like the Black-winged Eagle's beak, appeared within the flames.

A slender needle, crafted from the venomous fangs of the Black Flood Dragon, was inserted into the tip of each horn, carrying a potent venom.

Qin Sang had slain the Black Flood Dragon in Bottomless Cliff Valley and preserved its corpse, but he hadn't decided what to refine from it.

It was a peak Spirit Severing Stage Black Flood Dragon, very rare in the Small Cold Region and a precious material for refining.  However, it didn't seem as valuable in the Boundless Sea.

It was said that in the Storm Demon Sea, Core Formation stage great demons frequently appeared, and Spirit Severing stage demonic beasts were countless.

Qin Sang was already considering visiting the Storm Demon Sea after finishing his current tasks to gather the Flood Dragon souls needed for his Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, further enhancing his life-saving abilities.

The Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman was one of the Four Great Secret Talismans of the Supreme Pure and Tranquil Palace.  After gathering the Flood Dragon souls, its escape speed was astonishing, a treasure coveted by Core Formation cultivators.

Unfortunately, demonic beasts were rare in the Small Cold Region, and Daoist Xuan Yu never managed to gather nine Flood Dragon souls in his lifetime.

The Soul-Devouring Cones were refined.

Qin Sang stored the Ten Yama Banner and other items, put the Flying Night Devil back into the Corpse Puppet Bag, and then left the cave, flying towards the Thousand Households Village.
‘Swift!’
Wilderness.
Sword cries resonated like thunder, shaking the mountains and forests.
Immediately after, two meteor-like lights sped from afar, chasing each other in the air.
A moment later, one of the lights suddenly vanished, and the remaining one stopped, revealing its true form – an exquisitely beautiful flying sword.
A figure appeared out of thin air, taking the flying sword into his palm.
Qin Sang looked down at the Ebony Sword, recalling the process of the sword light splitting.
After reaching Core Formation and breaking through the fifth level of the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, Qin Sang could now use the Sword Light Splitting divine ability.
Sword Light Splitting was a more profound divine ability than Sword Qi Thunder Sound, and a sword dao realm countless sword cultivators dreamed of.
After mastering Sword Light Splitting, the split sword shadows were almost indistinguishable from the real thing and could inherit a portion of the spiritual sword's power, making them incredibly difficult for opponents to defend against.
Qin Sang had read records in ancient texts of some sword cultivators who mastered Sword Light Splitting being able to split into several sword shadows.  Even stronger cultivators could borrow sword intent to create momentum and deploy powerful sword formations with sword light.
One sword forming a formation, daring to call themselves a match for ten thousand enemies!
This was the true embodiment of a sword cultivator.
However, the divine ability that came with the cultivation method could only split into one sword shadow.  Unless Qin Sang could comprehend it on his own, he would be unlikely to reach that level.
Qin Sang speculated that the original cultivation method, as the realm increased, should allow for more split sword lights. It was currently unclear whether Senior Qing Zhu's self-created cultivation method would enhance the Sword Light Splitting divine ability.
His current task was to master the use of Sword Light Splitting.
