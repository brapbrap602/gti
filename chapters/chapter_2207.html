<h1>Chapter 2197: The Screen Fairy</h1><p>Panlong Cave gets its name from its shape, resembling a coiled dragon, winding and twisting through nine turns.  Inside, ancient prohibitions and wonders are scattered, creating a perilous and extremely complex environment.</p><p>Before the Heart Lake's anomaly, many of the cave's ancient prohibitions had been dormant for years.  As long as one didn't recklessly charge through, it wasn't as dangerous as imagined; from the surface, it appeared as an ordinary cave.</p><p>The current state of Panlong Cave is drastically different.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, upon entering, immediately detected a pungent smell of blood, as if a million-strong army had engaged in a bloody battle within, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>They had been here before, sensing the blood, though they hadn't ventured deep. They had some understanding of its origin.</p><p>At the cave's entrance are two diverging paths. One leads to a strange cavern, vast in size, densely overgrown with vines.  These vines, resembling snakes, blanket the ground, their surfaces rough and withered like old bark, appearing completely dead.  The cavern is deathly still.</p><p>However, if anyone cuts the vine's bark, blood flows freely.</p><p>The vines' peculiarity piqued curiosity.  Samples of the blood were taken, but no special powers were discovered; it was like the blood of ordinary creatures.  Once removed from the cavern, even if the vines continued to grow, they no longer produced blood.</p><p>Eventually, the worthless vines were ignored.  But after the Heart Lake's change, the vines displayed an unprecedented ferocity, not recorded in any ancient texts.</p><p>These vines acted like awakened beasts, bursting from the cavern, growing wildly within Panlong Cave, even attacking each other.</p><p>The walls of that passage are covered with thick, old vines, blood forming rivers on the ground.  The scene is overwhelmingly crimson, the red light bleeding out of the cave.</p><p>Unaware of the vines' nature and unwilling to provoke them, Qin Sang and Liuli immediately chose the other path.</p><p>Panlong Cave's interior is spacious enough to allow for flight.</p><p>Entering the other passage, the smell of blood gradually lessened.  But they were met with fierce winds, countless wind blades slicing through their protective energy.  Even with their cultivation, they were forced to remain alert, unable to relax.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>…</p><p>The wind, mixed with the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind, increased the pressure.  Their pursuers were close behind; they dared not stop, plunging deeper into the storm.</p><p>The sounds of cutting and hewing were incessant.  The wind blades, solidified into tangible weapons, danced wildly everywhere.</p><p>Like the vines in the other passage, these wind blades emanated from a cavern, formed from the power of an ancient prohibition.</p><p>Fortunately, while powerful, the wind blades lacked the vines' strange properties.  Enduring the cutting wind, they finally broke free.</p><p>Beyond the wind blades lay an area that was once relatively safe, now thrown into chaos.  Ignoring the danger ahead, Qin Sang and Liuli pressed on relentlessly.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator and the insect cloud pursued them, witnessing the scene, their expressions darkening.</p><p>Clearly, the greater the chaos, the more advantageous it was for Qin Sang.</p><p>The wind blades at the entrance possessed such power; the cave's depths were unimaginable.  If time dragged on, Qin Sang might use the terrain to escape.  They had to keep him in their sights, allowing no slip-up, lest they lose their target.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was injured before fleeing into Panlong Cave. The black-robed cultivator was confident in his magic treasure's power; the blow landed squarely, and even with Qin Sang's body cultivation, he wouldn't be unscathed.</p><p>The tide was turning; as long as the celestial child maintained the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind, Qin Sang would be trapped.</p><p>The celestial child also entered Panlong Cave and immediately encountered problems.</p><p>The cave's ancient prohibitions and secret realms, such as the wind blades, not only harmed Qin Sang and Liuli but also disrupted the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind.</p><p>The celestial child frowned slightly, gathering the power of his four companion beasts, using all his strength to control the Annihilation Gourd, repeatedly condensing the wind and fire of the Nine-Turn Annihilation Wind, preventing its dissipation.</p><p>Because of this, he, who had almost caught up, fell behind again, though not by much.  His two companions ahead constantly sent messages, warning him of dangers he could avoid, allowing him to escape calmly.</p><p>Ahead, Qin Sang and Liu Li had to forge their own path.  Finally, they broke through the chaos, and immediately Qin Sang felt a wave of intense cold wash over them.</p><p>Feeling this chill, both Qin Sang and Liu Li's eyes lit up. This was one of the advantageous locations they had been searching for!</p><p>According to the records, there was a cave ahead leading to a vast, icy plain.  The plain was constantly swept by fierce, unrelenting winds, a region of extreme cold.</p><p>It was said that over countless years, an astonishing amount of cold energy had accumulated on the plain. Liu Li cultivated the way of ice, making her more adaptable to this environment and able to use the plain's cold energy against her enemies.</p><p>This icy plain was a crucial part of their plan.  If the enemies remained together, they wouldn't stand a chance. They needed to separate them.  If Liu Li could hold one of them, Qin Sang would only face two, and with the help of the Thunder Beast Guards, he could at least remain undefeated.</p><p>However, all three powerful enemies were late-stage Void Refinement cultivators, each far stronger than Liu Li.  She could play a crucial role beside Qin Sang, as he always handled the most dangerous situations. But separated from him, she would have to face a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator alone – a world of difference.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor's Talisman allowed her to wield power far beyond her cultivation level, but it couldn't enhance her perception or elevate her inherent abilities, which were also vital in combat.</p><p>To have her face a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator alone was incredibly dangerous. Only by using the icy plain to her advantage could she prolong the fight.</p><p>Of course, it was still a dangerous undertaking for Liu Li.</p><p>Their eyes met, and a resolute expression flashed across Liu Li's eyes. She had made her decision.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The sound of air breaking behind them signaled the arrival of their pursuers.</p><p>The next moment, the aura of magical treasures rapidly approached.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his Grey Warbler Sword to defend, and the two fought and retreated, but didn't flee directly to the icy plain.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Sword and blade clashed, sparks flying, sharp energy sweeping across all directions.</p><p>The sounds of impact echoed deafeningly through the cave.</p><p>The cloaked cultivator summoned the spirit drum again.  Its booming sound, like a war drum, stirred the enemies' blood.</p><p>The silver eyes beneath the cloak were fixed on Qin Sang.  By observing the changes in Qin Sang's aura, he could gauge the severity of his injuries.</p><p>The drum's reverberations seemed to echo in Qin Sang's heart.  A flush rose to his face, quickly suppressed as he launched a thunder talisman at the drum.</p><p>The cloaked cultivator maneuvered the drum to dodge, but the drumming didn't cease.  Secretly, he relayed his observations to the man in green robes.</p><p>They instantly formulated a plan.</p><p>The cloaked cultivator transformed into a black phoenix again, his attack three times more ferocious than before.</p><p>Simultaneously, a jade fan-shaped magical treasure flew from the insect cloud.</p><p>Spirit drum, silver blades, jade fan, black phoenix, insect cloud…</p><p>Even with Qin Sang and Liu Li's numerous skills, they were overwhelmed, struggling to defend.</p><p>The insect cloud, originally arranged in a long, serpentine formation within the cave, suddenly curved, its ends connecting to form an oval torso.  Shimmering images on its back resembled transparent wings, transforming it into an unknown spirit insect.</p><p>The transparent wings fluttered silently, and the giant insect's light suddenly became blindingly bright.</p><p>“Careful! It’s a Moon Shadow Ephemeral!”</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly warned Liu Li.</p><p>The next moment, their vision was filled with dazzling white light, like water, like moonlight, but far from gentle, filled with murderous intent.</p><p>This spiritual light was the Moon Shadow Ephemeral's innate ability, incredibly powerful.  The moment the light exploded, Qin Sang recognized it and was about to act, but the cloaked cultivator, having planned this, urged the spirit drum towards the silver blades and the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The spirit drum tore through the air.  The two silver blades moved to meet it, flying to either side.</p><p>The blade's light shone like silver wings.  With a deafening roar, the void trembled violently.</p><p>The sword light of the Grey Warbler Sword dimmed instantly.  Qin Sang felt a terrifying force slam into him, triggering his suppressed injuries; his face turned deathly pale.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Moon Shadow Ephemeral's light arrived in an instant. Qin Sang was half a beat too slow and could only rely on Liu Li to defend.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the light was aimed directly at Liu Li.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light and the spiritual light collided, the power earth-shattering.</p><p>A powerful blow sent Liuli reeling, separating her from Qin Sang for the first time in their battle.  The black-robed cultivator and the man in green robes had achieved their goal.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He tried to reach Liuli, but a second beam of light from the Moon Shadow Ephemera shot towards him.  Simultaneously, two dark glows erupted above his head, two black phoenix claws aimed at him.  Forced to evade, Qin Sang missed his chance to rejoin Liuli.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the black-robed cultivator's target wasn't Qin Sang. The seemingly terrifying phoenix claws merely grazed him before the black phoenix swooped towards Liuli.  This was their prearranged strategy: eliminate Liuli first, then besiege Qin Sang.</p><p>The Moon Shadow Ephemera positioned itself between Qin Sang and Liuli.  Then, a whistling sound announced the arrival of the celestial boy and his mount.  Seeing the scene, a gleam of delight flashed in the celestial boy's eyes as he ordered his mount to attack Qin Sang.</p><p>The battlefield was now split. One section saw Qin Sang besieged by the insect swarm and the celestial boy. The other showed Liuli relentlessly pursued by the black-robed cultivator. Outmatched, she had no choice but to flee into the ice plains.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were completely separated, with no chance of reunion.  Wounded, Qin Sang’s attempts to break through were thwarted by the combined forces of the insect swarm and the celestial boy, worsening his predicament.</p><p>Desperately, Qin Sang abandoned Liuli, fleeing towards the depths of the Panlong Cave. The celestial boy pursued relentlessly.  This gambit successfully lured one of them into the ice plains.  The only drawback was that Liuli drew off the strongest cultivator, the black-robed one.  It remained uncertain how long she could hold out, but they had no other options.</p><p>During his escape, Qin Sang constantly monitored his pursuers, fearing they might turn and attack Liuli.  Fortunately, the celestial boy's hatred for Qin Sang, coupled with his lack of confidence in capturing him single-handedly, kept him focused on the chase.  He and the man in green robes showed no sign of turning back.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief; half their plan had succeeded. The rest was up to him. He focused solely on escaping.</p><p>…</p><p>In the ice plains, the intense cold condensed into visible white mist, swirling in the biting wind. Two streaks of light pursued each other.</p><p>The black-robed cultivator said calmly, "Since you and that Qin Zhenren are not a couple, why die together? Leave now, and I, Qi, will not trouble you further."</p><p>Liuli was a problem.  If left unchecked, she could ambush them while they attacked Qin Sang.  Killing her wasn't easy, so the best approach was to dissuade her or severely wound her.  Their earlier encounters had revealed Liuli’s limitations; the talismans granted her immense power, but she lacked complete control.  To a top-tier expert, these were fatal flaws.</p><p>Despite the black-robed cultivator's offer, Liuli remained silent.  Time was precious, and the black-robed cultivator didn't want to waste any more time. Sensing Qin Sang's escape, he attacked with full force.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>A silver-winged spirit drum materialized above Liuli's head.  The small drum, heavier than a mountain, crashed down.  The black-robed cultivator expected Liuli to defend herself, revealing weaknesses with repeated attacks.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Liuli didn't fight back, falling towards the ground.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>An ominous feeling washed over the black-robed cultivator as he plummeted, his phoenix claws aimed at Liuli.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>A hurricane erupted across the ice plains. From above, one would see endless cold surging towards them, forming towering waves of mist. The ice plains roared.</p><p>Liuli’s ability to wield the Heavenly Emperor Talisman was limited. She could only control a fraction of its immense power. Now, she didn't need precise control;  she unleashed the full might of the talisman, drawing the ice plains’ cold into the storm.</p><p>The talisman revealed its true power, unleashing a blizzard. The black-robed cultivator was instantly enveloped, his vision a blinding white.</p><p>…</p><p>As the battle raged in the cave, two streaks of light arrived at the island's edge, transforming into two women.</p><p>"This is it! Sister Ping, we're here!" one of the girls exclaimed.</p><p>The other woman, gentle and composed, nodded and surveyed the surroundings. "Let's go in and have a look…"</p><p>Before she finished, she gasped, catching a stream of light.</p><p>"Sister Ping, who's sending a message? Someone's arrived before us?" the girl asked curiously.</p><p>"It's Daoist Si, the one who invited me to help. They're here, and they want us to join them," the gentle woman mused.</p>
