<h1>Chapter 711: Chain Reaction</h1><p>“A strict hierarchy, truly deserving of its name! If all the Emberhawks in this nest could cooperate like this, guided by a Core Formation stage king, and combine the Cold Wind power of hundreds of Emberhawks, how terrifying would the combined force be?”</p><p>Qin Sang shuddered.</p><p>It seemed that obtaining the Eternal Camphorwood from the Emberhawk nest wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Watching the Emberhawks fly farther and farther away, Qin Sang pondered briefly, suppressed his thoughts, and quickly activated his movement technique, chasing after them.</p><p>Emberhawks weren't large, but their endurance was exceptional. Carrying sea beast carcasses many times their own weight, they flew continuously for a full hour without showing any signs of stopping.</p><p>Following behind them, after flying for another four or five hours, Qin Sang finally saw a towering mountain shadow appear on the sea surface ahead.</p><p>From afar, a touch of snow-white caught his eye.</p><p>“A snow-capped mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Snow mountains were rare in this area, but considering the Emberhawks' power and the properties of Eternal Camphorwood, its presence on a snow mountain made sense.</p><p>The Emberhawks flew higher and higher, finally reaching the top of the snow mountain and disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped at a distance and discovered that the top of the snow mountain was a structure similar to a volcanic crater. He didn't know how deep the bottom was, but the Emberhawks' nest was clearly within the mountain.</p><p>Having witnessed the Emberhawks' cooperative hunting, Qin Sang decided it was best not to rush into the nest. He would first find a nearby location to observe their habits and determine the size of the flock before making a decision.</p><p>The size of an Emberhawk flock was usually related to the strength of its king. If there were tens of thousands of Emberhawks, their king might be a peak Core Formation demon.</p><p>However, the entrance to the snow mountain seemed small, suggesting there might not be that many.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang circled the snow mountain several times and selected an inconspicuous small island far from the mountain. He carved out a cave dwelling and set up several concealment restrictions and spirit arrays.</p><p>After completing these preparations, he ventured out again and finally found another team of Emberhawks heading out to hunt.</p><p>This time, he didn't conceal himself but directly attacked, killing all the Emberhawks in the group. To experience the power of their Cold Wind power, he patiently engaged them before delivering the final blow.</p><p>“The power is indeed quite strong. The combined Cold Wind of these Emberhawks can exert several times the strength of their leader. However, combining the Cold Wind requires a process and prior preparation. This might be a weakness to exploit. However, the leader is a Core Formation demon and might have stronger abilities... The good news is, the Nine Nether Demonic Flame is indeed very effective against Emberhawks. By unleashing the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, even if the Emberhawk king is at the mid-Core Formation stage, there's a good chance of killing it, provided I can force it out of the nest and away from the flock.”</p><p>Qin Sang collected the demon corpses and even remained hidden underwater for a while before leaving.</p><p>“The other Emberhawks didn't immediately come searching. It seems they don't have the ability to sense death within their flock…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, a plan gradually forming in his mind.</p><p>He returned to his temporary cave and, while cultivating, observed the snow mountain's activity. After about twenty days, he had gathered a considerable amount of information.</p><p>The weakest members of the flock almost never left the nest, likely dedicated solely to breeding.  Every so often, Spirit Severing stage leaders would take turns leading small teams out to hunt and bring food back to the nest.</p><p>The food also varied, sometimes being sea beasts, other times ordinary sea fish.</p><p>“Based on the hunting frequency, there should be about ten thousand Emberhawks. Their king is quite patient, never having been seen outside…”</p><p>Qin Sang grumbled to himself, deciding to proceed with his plan.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang ambushed a small team of Emberhawks south of the snow mountain. The next day, he repeated the tactic, hunting down another team to the west.</p><p>He intended to force the king out of the nest using this method.</p><p>On the second night, the unexpected happened.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived early on a deserted island north of the snow mountain, awaiting a team of Emberhawks that he knew had just left the nest and were heading in his direction.</p><p>He hadn't killed enough yet for the Emberhawks to notice anything unusual.</p><p>However, shortly after Qin Sang arrived on the island, with the bright moon hanging high in the sky, a beautiful night, Qin Sang, meditating on the grass, suddenly sensed an unprecedentedly terrifying aura sweep past from the far north, instantly jolting him out of his meditative state.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up, his expression drastically changing as he stared intently at the northern night sky.</p><p>In the next moment, a fiery red light streaked across the sky like a meteor, heading west.</p><p>The distance was too great, allowing him to see only the red light.</p><p>But the aura emanating from the red light, even from such a distance, still sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine, leaving him somewhat panicked.</p><p>“A Transformation stage demon!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in shock. Such a terrifying aura, not even possessed by the Man-Faced Porpoise near the Coldflame, could only belong to a Transformation stage demon or a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Coupled with the demonic aura surging from the north, there was only one possibility!</p><p>Although Qin Sang had encountered Transformation stage demons in the Small Cold Realm, those demons had agreements with the humans and wouldn't casually kill, making them less terrifying.</p><p>The Demon Sea was different. Demons and cultivators were sworn enemies, and they would never hesitate to kill a cultivator on sight.</p><p>“There's actually a Transformation stage demon near Skyfire Island. Why has it appeared at this time?”</p><p>In his alarm, Qin Sang quickly thought, while his body had already sprung into action, leaving the deserted island without hesitation and fleeing directly south.</p><p>“Judging by the direction of the Transformation stage demon's flight, it seems to be heading straight for the Thousand Demons Sea. Could it be attracted by the Coldflame…?”</p><p>A possibility suddenly occurred to Qin Sang, and the more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p>For cultivators to establish a foothold on a large island, they must have an understanding with the nearby Transformation stage demons. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't intrude on each other's territory, unless there was something of immense attraction.</p><p>Only a treasure of the Coldflame's caliber could attract a Transformation stage demon.</p><p>“Even a Transformation stage demon is tempted; the Coldflame can't be hidden…”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile, staring at the northern night sky as he watched the red light fly farther and farther away. He inwardly breathed a sigh of relief; the demon was heading straight for the Coldflame and at least wouldn't interfere with his acquisition of the Eternal Camphorwood for now.</p><p>However, after obtaining the Eternal Camphorwood, he would have to stay far away. Returning the same way was impossible; he would have to continue south.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Just as the red light was about to disappear from the western night sky, several extremely powerful auras appeared consecutively from the distant east, all moving at incredible speeds, seemingly following the red light.</p><p>Without exception, they were all Core Formation demons!</p><p>One of them, directly east of him, was heading straight in his direction.</p>
