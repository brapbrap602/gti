<h1>Chapter 729: Minor Troubles</h1><p>Chapter 729: Minor Troubles</p><p>Sensing it, Qin Sang found the thunder cocoon very stable and could be safely stored in his dantian without fear of explosion.</p><p>However, the results of the mutation were unknown, potentially good or bad.  It could grant new abilities, or it could impair his bloodline abilities, rendering him useless.</p><p>Fortunately, such mutations generally don't affect the final transformation.</p><p>Since it was the Skyeye Butterfly that actively consumed the rare thunder power, the final result shouldn't be too bad.</p><p>"Will it gain thunder abilities and become a Thunder Butterfly?"</p><p>Qin Sang was expectant.</p><p>The thunderclouds above the cave still lingered, but the most refined white mist had been consumed by the Skyeye Butterfly. Qin Sang looked around, confirming nothing was left behind, retrieved the Flying Night Rakshasa, and returned the way he came.</p><p>Leaving Red Leaf Island, he felt much more at ease.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Green Warbler Island, waited for a merchant ship, and boarded it, heading straight for his chosen base – Five Element Island.</p><p>Five Element Island is actually five small islands, not far apart. Cultivators simply named them using the five elements, such as Gold Element, Wood Element, and so on, collectively known as Five Element Island.</p><p>The cultivators on the five islands help each other, barely managing to maintain their foothold in that sea area.</p><p>The reason the cultivators are separated across the five islands is due to frequent beast tides. As a precaution, if one island is attacked, cultivators from the others can go to assist, waiting for the tide to subside before attempting to retake the lost island.</p><p>It sounds dangerous, but according to the merchant guild, the Five Element Island cultivators are very adept at dealing with beast tides; the casualties are actually less than expected, and many cultivators are still willing to stay.</p><p>The sea journey continued.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated while observing the Skyeye Butterfly's changes daily.  It was his life-bound insect, and despite the thunder cocoon's obstruction, he could vaguely sense its state.</p><p>The thunder power on its wings became increasingly intense. At this rate, it might really mutate into a Thunder Butterfly.</p><p>However, the Skyeye Butterfly showed no signs of waking up.</p><p>It seemed the mutation process would be very long.</p><p>……</p><p>Gold Element Island.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and saw the island's peculiar scenery, his expression changing.</p><p>Gold Element Island was quite large, but it was all wild mountains and forests. The coastal area was enclosed by stones; it was more of a village than a city.</p><p>The city was filled with crude houses built of stones and timber, and two intersecting wide avenues looked exceptionally rough-hewn.</p><p>The most striking feature was the dozen or so stone pillars outside the city, each six or seven zhang high and thick enough for two people to embrace.  Countless runes were carved on their surfaces.</p><p>"Are these stone pillars the island protection formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless. The island protection formation was so crude and openly displayed.</p><p>The pillars were not made of any special materials, just ordinary stones, albeit slightly harder than common stones. Once the formation was activated, it certainly wouldn't last long.</p><p>Probably, before the beasts could break through the formation, the pillars themselves would crumble first. Clearly, the island's cultivators were already prepared to flee.</p><p>Cultivators could be seen moving about the streets, indicating that the Two Races' conflict hadn’t greatly affected the place.</p><p>Qin Sang tightened his cloak and quickly walked into the city. He soon found the Qiongyu Merchant Guild's shop, showed his token, and entered.</p><p>Only a Foundation Establishment stage old man was in the shop; he enthusiastically greeted him, "Senior, what animal hides do you wish to sell? Our small shop guarantees high prices…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned at this and shook his token.</p><p>The old man paused, then overjoyed, hastily bowed, "It's Senior Qingfeng!  Forgive my poor eyesight, I greet Senior!"</p><p>"Get up!"</p><p>Qin Sang dismissively raised his hand, looking around the shop. He discovered the shelves were filled with various animal hides; there were no other artifacts or pills.</p><p>Just as he was about to ask, he heard the angry voices of the Wang sisters outside the hall.</p><p>The Wang sisters: the older sister is named Wang Shi, and the younger is Wang Xiang.</p><p>It was the younger sister's sharper voice speaking.</p><p>"Sister, that scoundrel was so rude, he dared to insult you to your face.  Once Daoist Master arrives, we'll make him pay…"</p><p>Wang Xiang scolded while stomping her feet.</p><p>Her sister, Wang Shi, sternly stopped her, "Be careful what you say! He's a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator; don't talk nonsense. If someone with ulterior motives hears you, it will bring trouble to Daoist Master."</p><p>Wang Xiang looked wronged, "He not only insulted us publicly but also tried to touch us. Are we just going to let it go?"</p><p>"Someone with such high cultivation wouldn't be driven by lust."</p><p>He insulted us, but ultimately it's for the benefit of Wu Yuan Island. Let's endure it for now. We'll discuss this when Daoist Master returns. Don't let a moment of anger ruin the bigger picture," Wang Shi persuaded gently.</p><p>As they spoke, two women entered the shop.  Seeing Qin Sang, their faces lit up with surprise.</p><p>Before they could curtsy, Qin Sang stopped them, saying calmly, "Wang Daoyou, who insulted you?"</p><p>Wang Shi glanced at her sister, silencing her with a look.  "Daoist Master, please don't listen to Wang Xiang's exaggerations. I was merely discussing business with several large trading houses of the Dongji League, and a minor disagreement arose with Daoist Cui Ji."</p><p>"It wasn't that simple, was it? Since it involves business with our trading houses, you needn't have endured it."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to her sister, Wang Xiang. "Tell me, who is this Cui Ji, and what happened?"</p><p>Wang Shi looked helpless.</p><p>Finally given the opportunity to speak her mind, Wang Xiang, who had been simmering with anger, chattered incessantly, filling Qin Sang in on the details.</p><p>It turned out that Cui Ji was a manager sent by the Nine Stars Assembly to oversee affairs on Wu Yuan Island.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with the Nine Stars Assembly; she had arrived in the Yao Sea aboard one of their ships.  They were a powerful organization, holding considerable sway within the Dongji League.</p><p>Cui Ji, however, had been acting out of line since his arrival. He had gathered the Dongji League's trading houses on the island and demanded that all other factions conduct business according to his dictates.</p><p>Houses like the Qiongyu Trading House, which only had a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and lacked strength, were particularly oppressed.  </p><p>This explained why Qin Sang had seen so many animal hides in the shop.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, unconcerned. "A mere mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator dares to act so arrogantly here?"</p><p>The elder sighed, "Senior, you don't understand.  There are a few cultivators on Wu Yuan Island stronger than Cui Ji, but he's relying on the Nine Stars Assembly's power. They're afraid of antagonizing the Dongji League.  Cui Ji, meanwhile, is adept at flattering his superiors and avoids directly offending them, allowing him to maintain a precarious peace. The Xiyou League isn't interested in this island, and the Beichen League's influence is comparable to ours. They've divided the island into respective territories and avoid interfering with each other. Wu Yuan Island is less important than other larger islands; the managers sent by our various trading houses are weaker than Cui Ji, so we can only endure this injustice..."</p><p>"Cui Ji must have heard some rumors and wanted to give us a warning. I knew Elder Zou and Manager Ran weren't being entirely truthful when they told me to focus on cultivation and not worry about late-stage masters…."</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head, sat down, and said, "Tell me everything you know about this Cui Ji."</p>
