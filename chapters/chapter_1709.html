<h1>Chapter 1700: Distinguished Guest</h1><p>“Compensation?”</p><p>The avatar let out a cold laugh.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint and Qing Hu Saint King didn't respond to his reaction.  They believed that given Qin Sang's cultivation, he wouldn't lose control of his emotions, and there was no need to waste words.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint clasped his hands together. Sha Ying's expression and eyes seemed somewhat dull and lifeless, but anyone who met his gaze would feel an inexplicable pressure.</p><p>The avatar remained silent for a moment, seemingly aware that this tactic was ineffective. He didn't feel the pressure from Sha Ying, nor did he ask what exactly had attracted the Qing Hu Saint King's covetousness.  He was merely curious and asked,</p><p>“Why does the Saint Monk involve himself in this muddy water?”</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>Hui Guang Saint chanted a Buddhist salutation. “The grievances between the two donors have not yet reached the point of irreconcilability. Although Qin Donor hasn't reached the stage of Transcending Divinity, he is still a top-tier expert standing at the peak of this world. A conflict between the two donors will inevitably have far-reaching consequences. This monk is unwilling to see the two donors' hatred deepen, implicating innocent beings and causing the cultivation world to be eternally restless, so I first persuaded the Saint King, and then discussed with Qin Donor.”</p><p>Hearing this, the avatar's eyes turned icy.</p><p>He didn't hear compassion from Hui Guang Saint's words, but a threat. Of course, this threat didn't originate from Hui Guang Saint himself, but was conveyed to Qin Sang through him, representing the intentions of the Qing Hu Saint King.</p><p>No goal unmet!</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King had her eyes fixed on him; if he failed to meet her demands, he would face endless pursuit and killing from her and the Saint King's Palace.</p><p>After refining the source of the demonic fire, Qin Sang might have the power to fight a Transcending Divinity cultivator, but that was all.</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King still had the Saint King's Palace and countless great demons under her command, while his own forces were too weak; only his external avatar could hold its own.</p><p>The Moonlit Guards were not enough to fill the gap in the demonic forces' teeth.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang ignored the threat of the beasts in the Storm Belt and hid in the North Sea or the Cang Lang Sea. Going to the Western Lands was the easiest, but after Gui Mu's success, the Buddhist forces would surely guard it strictly, and it wouldn’t be safe either.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang must ensure that he leaves no trace. Most of this world is the Storm Belt; there are only so many safe places.  Does he really think the Storm Belt can stop a Transcending Divinity cultivator's pursuit?</p><p>Who can say for sure if the Central Plains forces don't have a map of this world's seas?</p><p>Of course, this was the worst-case scenario.</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King might not be willing to waste so much effort on him, relentlessly pursuing him to the Outer Regions.</p><p>But it was certain that he couldn't stay in the Central Plains any longer.</p><p>Even if Lu Ye was secluded enough to ensure Qin Sang's safety, they certainly wouldn't dare let the Moonlit Guards out. Once their minions were eradicated and their contact with the outside world was cut off,</p><p>Mo Xing Dao was willing to be a pawn for a Transcending Divinity cultivator.  Their deal had probably been exposed.</p><p>Not only were the Lingxi Immortal Fruits a pipe dream, it would be difficult for him to go out in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang's future cultivation, and the Spirit-Nourishing techniques of the *Pan Hu True Scripture*, would certainly require external materials.</p><p>Even worse, if Qin Sang ignored Hui Guang Saint’s advice, and Hui Guang Saint, to prevent the demonic race from disrupting the cultivation world, might have the Buddhist sect secretly cooperate with the Qing Hu Saint King to quickly quell the disturbance.</p><p>At that time, the whole world would be his enemy!</p><p>Hui Guang Saint, maintaining his status, did not explicitly issue a threat, but Qin Sang had to consider this possibility.</p><p>The avatar flew into a rage, and roared fiercely, “Isn't the Saint King afraid that Qin will infiltrate the East Sea and slaughter the Saint King’s Palace?”</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King, who had remained silent since her appearance, spoke for the first time.</p><p>“This King was originally a wild fox from a mountain in the land, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon to become enlightened. Unexpectedly, it attracted cultivators, and this King barely escaped with her life, while all her close relatives in the cave perished. I heard that the demonic race has a vast presence at sea, so with nowhere to go, this King boarded a piece of driftwood and drifted to the East Sea alone.  But I found that the demonic race's internal affairs are even more bloody.  Without the protection of my own kind, I hid and evaded, repeatedly pursued and killed, finally understanding the law of the jungle. Before ascending to the position of Saint King, blood was always with me, countless demonic souls under my hand. There were only enemies, no relatives and friends. So what if you slaughter the demonic race of the East Sea?”</p><p>Her tone was slightly languid, as if she were telling a story unrelated to herself.</p><p>Anyone hearing these words would feel a chill in their heart, even through the transmission talisman.</p><p>Transcending Divinity cultivators weren't scary; what was scary was a Transcending Divinity cultivator with no scruples.</p><p>Sects were the soft underbelly of the Daoist and Buddhist Transcending Divinity cultivators. Although they could dominate the Immortal Palace, they would always leave a way out.</p><p>Especially for Transcending Divinity cultivators, no matter their origin, even an old demon like Lu Lao Mo, whose hands were stained with blood, would always be given a polite send-off.</p><p>Even Hui Guang Saint would give such a Qing Hu Saint King a wide berth.</p><p>These are Qinghu Shengwang's words alone; they might be an empty boast, but his attitude is clear.  Such an opponent renders any threat meaningless.</p><p>"How do I know that Qinghu Shengwang isn't using the Saint Monk to lure me out? And how will the Saint Monk guarantee my safety?"</p><p>The avatar ceased their verbal sparring and directly questioned Huiguang Shengzhe, hitting the heart of the matter.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe had been waiting for this question.  With practiced ease, he spoke rapidly, "Qin Shizhu's concerns are known to me.  Today, I wish to discuss this matter with you. First, Qinghu Shengwang and I will make a sworn oath, bound by our inner demons, never again to attack your true form, your avatar, or your family. If the Shengwang breaks this oath, I will not stand idly by.  I will draft the oath, and you both may add to it..."</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe quickly recited the proposed oath.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't concerned with the oath's detail. He calmly stated, "Honourable Monk, I've always been wary of oaths sworn by inner demons.  Regardless of methods to circumvent such oaths, even Buddhist vows can be broken or abandoned – what is a single oath?"</p><p>Seeming to anticipate this, Huiguang Shengzhe replied without hesitation, "Since I am vouching for this, the resolution of your conflict with the Shengwang will take place at our temple. I intend to invite Qingfeng Daochang to Ganlu Temple to engage in philosophical discussion.  With such a distinguished guest arriving, our temple gates will be flung open to welcome him!  Then, I will set up an altar for the Shengwang to swear the karmic oath, and you will witness it."</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe deliberately emphasized the words "Qingfeng Daochang."</p><p>"Qingfeng Daochang?"</p><p>The avatar's heart stirred, sensing Huiguang Shengzhe's intention.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Xie family had arrived at Ganlu Temple on the Dragon Abode Celestial Boat, under the watchful eyes of many.</p><p>The Dragon Abode seemed eager to see Ganlu Temple's misfortune, escorting the boat right to the temple gates.</p><p>The entire Xie family disembarked and knelt before the temple.</p><p>Master Xingji personally intervened, persuading them and bringing them into the temple where they were comfortably settled. They remain at Ganlu Temple to this day.</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe said gravely, "Ganlu Temple, together with the Eight Scenic Spots and Tianhao Tower, will publicly announce that the Xie family ancestor, Qingfeng Daochang, played a crucial role in the recent demon-subjugation, saving countless lives by contributing the crucial Demon-sealing Stake.  To that end, I've already contacted the headmaster of the Buling Mountain sect and am preparing to discuss with other parties the transfer of Fudou and Hongping Counties, along with Ningzhou's Bo County, to the Xie family."</p><p>Hearing this, the avatar was astonished.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe had proactively cleared his name before the entire world, and had even granted significant benefits to the Xie family.</p><p>Fudou and Hongping Counties were secondary; Qin Sang had conquered them from Liuhuxumen. Without this incident, once Qin Sang had the chance, he would eventually subdue Liuhuxumen and reclaim them.</p><p>The key was Ningzhou Bo County!</p><p>Ningzhou was one of the six central states, bordering Zhuozhou. It was the wealthiest region in central China. Bo County was located on the border of the two states, connected to Hongping County.</p><p>The six central states had long been divided amongst the top sects like Ganlu Temple – a complex situation, virtually impenetrable.</p><p>A single county in the highly valuable central region was substantial, offering the Xie family unimaginable wealth, far beyond their previous dreams.</p><p>The Xie family’s resurgence was imminent, catapulting them back into the ranks of prestigious clans!</p><p>For Qin Sang, the most immediate benefit was Huiguang Shengzhe publicly clearing his name.  He could now claim the moral high ground and openly act as the Xie family ancestor in the cultivation world, even if only as an avatar.</p><p>As for why Huiguang Shengzhe was separating his true form and avatar…</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood.</p><p>Clearing the name of the avatar and the Xie family was a way to pacify things and silence public doubts.</p><p>But Qinghu Shengwang had attacked his true form in front of Huiguang Shengzhe.  Without separating Qin Sang’s true form and avatar, suspicions would inevitably arise. If Huiguang Shengzhe claimed he had been focused on fighting the demons and hadn't noticed the connection between the avatar and true form, few would believe him.</p><p>"The Saint Monk must have requests of me as well," the avatar countered.</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe had already compensated him for the Demon-sealing Stake with the Five Elements Pills.  Qin Sang hadn't planned to leverage his merits to coerce the Buddhist sect; otherwise he’d offend both factions' Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Since Huiguang Shengzhe was personally vouching for him and publicly clearing his name, he must have ulterior motives!</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe didn't hesitate, "Qingfeng Daochang will remain the Xie family ancestor, but Qin Shizhu must not leave behind any Wu Xiang Xianmen heritage within the Xie family."</p><p>Furthermore, the donor's true self must not secretly communicate with the Central Plains sects, nor participate in their disputes.  Future disciples must also refrain from spreading the teachings in the Central Plains…”</p><p>The repeated prohibitions caused the avatar to laugh silently.</p><p>While not explicitly forbidden from entering the Central Plains, it was nearly so.  The restrictions placed on the inheritance of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect were particularly suspicious – did they suspect him of being a descendant of the Huo Xiang Hall? He certainly didn't want to unjustly bear such a burden.</p><p>"Whether the Saint believes it or not, Qin is not a descendant of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect," the avatar stated plainly.</p><p>Saint Huiguang continued, regardless, "As long as the donor can comply, once you reach the Apotheosis realm, we will treat you equally.  All secrets regarding Apotheosis and ascension will be shared without reservation."</p><p>Whether Qin Sang was a remnant of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect was no longer important.  Saint Huiguang had initially planned a comprehensive purge, but after such a significant event, even a fool would understand the need for a reckoning. Remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect were hiding and concealing themselves; they couldn't be captured in a short time.</p><p>Therefore, Saint Huiguang changed his strategy.</p><p>Using the reappearance of the ancient demon as a pretext, he spread the rumor that the ancient demon was awakened by remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  The sect's destruction was attributed to its upper echelons being corrupted by demonic influence, becoming servants of the ancient demon.  The cultivation world paid a heavy price to prevent the spread of this demonic influence, but the threat lingered.</p><p>So much time had passed, even if someone knew the truth, they couldn't produce evidence, so there was no need for further concealment.</p><p>Simultaneously, the "Calming Mind Incantation" was circulated throughout the cultivation world, allowing cultivators to self-examine. This created widespread fear and fueled the persecution of any descendants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Most importantly, Saint Huiguang was running out of time.</p><p>Witnessing the tragic fate of the spirit demon, the Qinghu Saint King had lost patience. He wouldn't wait for Saint Huiguang to gain complete control before acting. This time, he intended to monopolize the Soul-Calming Incense, potentially causing future trouble.</p><p>Because of this, Saint Huiguang's arrangements for the Ganlu Zen Monastery differed from his initial plan. He intended to forge long-term alliances with the Eight Scenic Spots, Tianhao Tower, and other forces, the specifics of which still needed discussion.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, Saint Huiguang's offer was undeniably sincere.</p><p>He had no ambition for dominance, no desire for the Qingyang Sect's prosperity, nor any intention of interfering in the Central Plains. With the Luye Daoist haven under their control, the Qingyang Sect could easily secure territory in the Northern Wasteland, eliminating the need to compete for resources in the Central Plains.</p><p>Once Daoist Qingfeng's name spread far and wide…</p><p>The avatar could openly visit, and while absolute safety couldn't be guaranteed, if Saint Huiguang intended to turn hostile, why go to such great lengths, especially since only an avatar had been deceived?</p><p>Indeed, despite Saint Huiguang's promises, Qin Sang had no intention of revealing his true self.</p><p>"I wonder what the Saint King desires?"</p><p>Sensing Saint Huiguang's sincerity, the avatar's thoughts raced before asking what exactly the Qinghu Saint King coveted.  If it were treasures like the Vermillion Bird's True Feather, there would be no chance of agreement.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King said, "The Soul-Calming Incense."</p><p>"Soul-Calming Incense?"</p><p>The avatar was incredulous, nearly spitting blood.</p><p>Such a storm over the Soul-Calming Incense.</p><p>If he had known, he would never have put it up for auction!</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The avatar hesitated.</p><p>This Qinghu Saint King was a madman.  The incense was useless to him, but if the Saint King had simply asked politely, a trade – or even offering the incense to save his life – wouldn't have been impossible.</p><p>"Is the Soul-Calming Incense something the Saint King absolutely must have?"</p><p>The avatar was puzzled.  "Does this treasure have any effect on Apotheosis cultivators?"</p><p>The Soul-Calming Incense was likely created by Xiao Xiangzi during his Nascent Soul stage to overcome his karmic tribulation. Its effectiveness for Apotheosis cultivators would be greatly diminished, unless Xiao Xiangzi was an unparalleled genius.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King replied, "The effect is minimal, but I need a large quantity of Soul-Calming Incense."</p><p>"A large quantity…"</p><p>The avatar suddenly understood – the other party wanted the formula.</p><p>However, the Qinghu Saint King's tone changed.  "If you are willing to trade the spiritual flame you possess, I would be delighted. I guarantee your satisfaction."</p><p>"That spiritual flame is my greatest asset. If the Saint King covets it, there's no need for further discussion," the avatar's tone turned cold.  No wonder he went straight to killing; he also had his eyes on the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Saint Huiguang quickly interjected, "I have already advised the Saint King; we only seek the formula, not the flame. The exchange will be conducted according to the donor's wishes."</p><p>The avatar coldly snorted, "I wonder what treasures the Saint King is willing to offer as a sign of good faith?"</p><p>"Most of the treasures I possess are Yaozu artifacts, but I have a few related to humanity.  Humanity cannot access the East Sea, unaware of its abundance."</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's voice was full of temptation.  "For instance, an ancient spirit-gathering array used for human cultivation…"</p>
