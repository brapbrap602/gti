Chapter 1879: Riding a Dragon to the Moon


Having returned empty-handed from the Phantasmal Tempest, Qin Sang estimated that with his current strength, reaching the location of the Crimson Gold Spirit Needle was nearing his limit, making further exploration difficult.  There was no need to waste more time before repairing the Taiyi Star Chariot.

The three retreated, Qin Sang choosing another route, stopping at the edge of the azure light sea.

“Having journeyed so far, I ask for your help in finding a treasure, Fellow Daoist,” Qin Sang said, pointing at the light sea, informing Mo Xingdao of the possibility of the Vajra Bodhi Tree and Vajra Fruit being hidden within.

The light sea was vast, and one person’s efforts were insufficient. If the Vajra Bodhi Tree could be found, Qin Sang wouldn't mind sharing.

Mo Xingdao's expression shifted slightly, repeatedly asking, "Is there truly the Vajra Fruit, one of the Ten Great Divine Trees, here?"

Seeing Mo Xingdao's expression, Qin Sang’s heart stirred. "Could this treasure be of assistance to you, Fellow Daoist?"

After Mo Xingdao's explanation, Qin Sang learned that the Vajra Fruit could be refined into his puppet body, supposedly offering considerable benefits. Unfortunately, both Vajra Fruits had been devoured by the Cloudroaming Sword.

Hope rekindled in Mo Xingdao, the previous gloom swept away, and he eagerly prepared to enter the light sea.

Qin Sang released Luo Hou’s spirit as well, informing them of the fluctuating characteristics of the Vajra Bodhi Tree. They split into four directions and began a meticulous search.

Due to insufficient preparation, coupled with the excessive exhaustion from the Phantasmal Tempest, they withdrew after a month of searching, having found nothing.

Qin Sang searched the location of the previous secluded valley over a dozen times, finding no trace whatsoever.

Logically, the tremors caused by the Phantasmal Tempest were no less intense than the Ghostfang Kingdom's Primordial Embryo Formation, yet the azure light sea hadn't exhibited the same anomalies as before.

To understand the reason, one would have to ascertain the unique aspects of the Ghostfang Kingdom’s Primordial Embryo Formation.

Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao discussed the matter, undeterred. Exploring the Phantasmal Tempest couldn’t be accomplished overnight. They would return frequently to explore; there would be plenty of opportunities.

"Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment. I have something to attend to. I’ll be back shortly," Qin Sang said, leaving Mo Xingdao behind and flying towards his cave dwelling alone.

Back then, Qin Sang had brought Mo Xingdao back to the flower field, confining him to the cave dwelling. Mo Xingdao was still unaware of the Flower Spirits' existence.

Everything in the flower field remained as usual.

Qin Sang landed in a flower bed, carefully examining the condition of the Flower Spirits. He walked through each flower bed, finally picking up the jade bottle in his hand, looking at it, and sighing softly.

The collected flower nectar was scarce, far from its peak abundance.

Over the years, the Flower Spirits had gradually revived, but the process was slow. Those uprooted were only just regaining a sliver of vitality.

Predictably, the flower nectar in the future would definitely be insufficient to sustain his cultivation needs.

"From now on, I must cultivate, comprehend the Dharma Manifestation, and regulate the Five Elements concurrently. Perhaps that will barely suffice…" Qin Sang pondered, inspecting the flower field formation before returning the way he came and leaving the Administrative Altar with Mo Xingdao.

Arriving at the Star Island Immortal Lake, the two parted ways. Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling on Swordheart Island. After adjusting his breath, he retrieved the Taiyi Star Chariot.

Moonlight filled the chamber.

The radiance, like flowing water, clear and intoxicating, flowed through Qin Sang's fingers, permeating the quiet chamber.

Since entering this realm, Qin Sang hadn't touched this treasure; it remained as he first saw it.

The Taiyi Star Chariot resembled a jeweled carriage, yet also a divine palace, carved from white jade, unfortunately covered in cracks, a heartbreaking sight.

Qin Sang held the Taiyi Star Chariot, his eyes slightly closed, his divine sense enveloping it, perceiving the treasure.

After a long while, he raised his other hand, drawing talismans in the air, striking them towards the Taiyi Star Chariot.

The talismans hovered around the chariot like eight screens. A faint blood-colored energy flowed between them, forming a strange blood ring. This was a talisman formation of the Profound Mystery Sect, aiding cultivators in analyzing treasures of unknown origin.

The Taiyi Star Chariot had been with Qin Sang for many years. He would occasionally take it out to admire and comprehend.

However, his cultivation was now vastly different, his artifact refinement skills far surpassing the past. Looking at it now, he had many new discoveries.

Gradually, the radiance in the cave fluctuated, and the Taiyi Star Chariot emitted crisp sounds like colliding jade pendants.

Qin Sang remained seated, motionless, but his hand seals had changed several times.

Now, the Taiyi Star Chariot floated before him on its own.

Qin Sang sometimes drew talismans, sometimes fell into deep thought, his left hand unconsciously gesturing.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, murmuring in surprise, "Unexpectedly, the Four Saints of the Boundless Sea possessed such high artifact refinement skills back then!"

From Qin Sang's current perspective, the difficulty of repairing the Taiyi Star Chariot was no less than the war drum. In its complete state, it might have been a True Treasure or a Postnatal Spirit Treasure.

This time, without the insights of Master Gu and True Person Yuan, just analyzing it would require a considerable amount of time.

Unexpectedly, Qin Sang discovered that the restoration approach left by Bao Gu was actually feasible.

Of course, completely restoring the Taiyi Star Chariot was impossible. It was more like Master Gu's first repair of the war drum, only capable of restoring partial power.

This was a remarkable achievement, considering that Bao Gu, the most powerful of the Four Saints, had only just stepped into Nascent Soul.  Unless they had received an artifact refinement inheritance in the Seven Kill Palace.

From Qin Sang's current perspective, Bao Gu's approach inevitably had limitations, with errors and omissions. But Qin Sang could continue along Bao Gu's path, saving himself much effort.

Just like the process of restoring the war drum, he would conduct preliminary repairs first. Even if the restored power was not entirely satisfactory, it would help in analyzing the Taiyi Star Chariot, ultimately striving for perfection.

By doing so, Qin Sang could complete it himself without needing to ask for help.

With this in mind, Qin Sang made his decision almost immediately. He set aside his own cultivation, sent a message to Sword Slave, sealed his cave dwelling, and entered seclusion once more.

Progress was smoother than anticipated.

Qin Sang was essentially refining and expanding upon Bao Gu's approach, making it much easier than starting from scratch.

Many of Bao Gu's unattainable ideas, Qin Sang could achieve, and he could further develop and extend them.

Limited by her vision, the spiritual materials chosen by Bao Gu weren't of high grade, posing hidden dangers during refinement. Qin Sang substituted them with purer, higher-grade materials with similar properties, increasing the probability of success.

Later, Qin Sang also made alterations based on his own understanding and the current situation.

In just two years, Qin Sang had a clear plan. The next step was to gather spiritual materials.

‘Creak!’

For the first time in two years, Qin Sang opened the quiet chamber.

Sunlight, filtering through the gaps in the leaves, fell upon him, bringing a sense of warmth. Qin Sang extended his divine sense, detecting that True Person Wielding Sword’s cave dwelling had activated its protective formation.

Sword Slave wasn’t in seclusion. Sensing the fluctuation of divine sense, he flew over.

“Has Fellow Daoist Wielding Sword returned to the island?” Qin Sang asked.

Sword Slave nodded. "Master returned half a year ago. Seeing that True Person was cultivating, he didn't disturb him and instructed this old slave that he would be in seclusion for a period."

Qin Sang glanced towards True Person Wielding Sword’s cave dwelling. In recent years, True Person Wielding Sword had been frequently traveling, entering seclusion upon his return. The two had few opportunities to meet. He wondered what kept him so busy.

After asking a few questions and understanding the current situation from Sword Slave, Qin Sang summoned his flying light and headed towards Kettle Island.

The atmosphere at Star Island Immortal Lake remained tense. Qin Sang dutifully landed on the island and went to the Qi Residence first.

Several days later, Qin Sang and Master Qi's disciples left the Qi Residence separately, seeking ways to gather spiritual materials.

Qin Sang's wealth was considerable. Merely the preliminary repair of the Taiyi Star Chariot wouldn't deplete his resources.

However, the spiritual materials he selected were all rare treasures, difficult to gather even after searching all of Star Island Immortal Lake.

Over the next six months, Qin Sang proactively contacted old acquaintances like True Person Youhuang, frequently attending various auctions and trade fairs. When encountering his targets, he wouldn't hesitate to pay a premium.

If he received news that someone might possess a certain spiritual material, he would also find ways to persuade them.

During this period, many cultivators on Star Island Immortal Lake heard rumors of a wealthy and mysterious expert.

Six months later, Master Qi's disciples had gathered the less rare materials.  Seeing that he had nearly "plundered" Star Island Immortal Lake, Qin Sang decided to travel west.

Where were the most abundant treasures in the world? Naturally, the Dao Court!

Returning to the Administrative Altar.

The Golden Armored Guards all recognized Qin Sang.

Qin Sang entered the Administrative Altar, chatting and laughing with a Golden Armored Guard. Learning that True Person Yuan was still in seclusion, he asked the guard to take him to the treasury.

It was worth mentioning that the government office managing the treasury of the North Pole Evil Warding Court was called the Grain and Provisions Department, a rather fitting name, considering the Dao Court army.

True Person Yuan had personally taken him to the treasury before, explaining the properties of various spiritual materials. This is how Qin Sang became acquainted with True Person Miao, the Director of the Grain and Provisions Department.

True Person Miao, in charge of the Grain and Provisions Department, held the official rank of Fourth Grade, his cultivation comparable to Qin Sang’s. The two interacted as equals.

Learning of Qin Sang's arrival, True Person Miao welcomed him warmly. Qin Sang got straight to the point, stating his purpose.

True Person Miao didn’t refuse, pondering, "Fellow Daoist wishes to exchange meritorious deeds?"

Here, spirit stones were useless.

Qin Sang nodded, then asked, "Would bartering be possible? They are all rare treasures of the world, and they certainly won’t cause you any trouble."

Saying this, Qin Sang brought out several items from Spiritfiend King’s legacy.

True Person Miao quickly glanced over them, his expression relaxing. Exchanging high for low, or equal exchange, he could make the decision. He was most afraid that Qin Sang's requests would be too high, and he wouldn’t be able to offer comparable items.

Multiple low-grade spiritual materials couldn't necessarily be exchanged for a single high-grade one.

That day, Qin Sang walked out of the Administrative Altar with a light step, having acquired most of the required spiritual materials.  The Dao Court had records of the missing items, and True Person Miao had pointed him in the right direction.

Qin Sang was naturally grateful, but thinking of the treasures he had given away, he couldn't help but feel a pang of pain.

After paying a visit to Master Gu, Qin Sang used the Minor Transference Formation, transferring several times, arriving at the southernmost tip of White Stone Administrative Region. He entered the Sea of Calamity, searching for spiritual materials on the islands within the sea.

For the next six months, Qin Sang traveled to all the islands mentioned by True Person Miao.  On his return journey, he personally visited the Yellow Springs Dao to investigate the situation.

While the outside world hadn’t been affected by the war, the Yellow Springs Dao was already awash with blood, having witnessed countless fierce battles.

Qin Sang didn’t intend to reveal himself for now, and because of this, his understanding of the situation was like peering through a fog, unclear.

However, there were no signs of a large-scale confrontation between the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom. He still had time.

With the complete set of spiritual materials, Qin Sang hurried back to the Qi Residence without stopping, immediately sealing the fire chamber and ordering that no one disturb him.

Inside the fire chamber.

Nine Nether Demonic Fire and Earth Vein Flame Fire shone brightly together.

Qin Sang’s divine sense guided the spiritual materials, refining them one by one.  Then, he tossed the Taiyi Star Chariot into the fire, using spells to stimulate its energy channels.

The process was largely similar to repairing the war drum.

Compared to before, Qin Sang appeared much more at ease. Firstly, he had improved, and secondly, the requirements for this repair weren't as high.

As clumps of refined spiritual essences were driven into the spiritual fire, the Taiyi Star Chariot didn’t transform into a spiritual embryo. At this point, Qin Sang resembled a mender, repairing cracks one by one.

However, the Taiyi Star Chariot still underwent noticeable changes, some of its power activated, its form also shifting, as if gradually unfolding.

‘Whoosh!’

A blinding light suddenly erupted within the fire chamber.

Qin Sang's eyes widened. Without hesitation, blood energy surged from his palms, flooding into the spiritual fire. The Taiyi Star Chariot was enveloped in a cocoon formed by the fusion of flames and blood energy.

‘Boom!’

A pure beam of light burst forth from the cocoon.

Qin Sang's fatigued face couldn't conceal his joy. He stabilized the underground fire veins with a flip of his hand, gazing at the clear, white light before him.

Within the white light was an object, undoubtedly a jade chariot.

The chariot was small and exquisite, with a jade seat inside. The front was open, the left and right sides only half-height, the back a jade wall with intricate openwork carvings depicting profound talisman diagrams. Above was a canopy with hanging tassels, truly exquisite.

Some details appeared unharmonious. Qin Sang knew this was because he hadn't fully repaired it.

Gazing at the chariot for a long time, Qin Sang’s expression turned strange.  He initially intended to try activating it, but he stopped.

Having personally refined it, Qin Sang already had a certain understanding of the chariot.

But for some reason, when his divine sense touched the chariot, a peculiar feeling arose, yet he couldn't pinpoint its source. Clearly, there were secrets he didn't understand.

Intuition told him it was best not to activate this treasure here.

With this in mind, Qin Sang patiently entered meditative tranquility to recover. Afterwards, he hastily left the Qi Residence, transferring to the outer lake, finding an uninhabited area of water.

…

It was the dead of night.

The moon hung high in the sky, large as a silver platter.

Qin Sang retrieved the jade chariot under the moonlight. As he infused it with true essence, it immediately radiated a brilliant light, transforming into the size of a normal chariot.

The treasure’s radiance resonated with the moonlight, adding a touch of nobility. A celestial chariot, nothing could surpass it.

Qin Sang tentatively boarded the chariot, sitting on the jade seat, stroking the armrest, focusing his senses on the chariot, the peculiar feeling becoming clearer.

The next moment, Qin Sang’s expression drastically changed!

A terrifying roar emanated from the chariot, a sound like a dragon’s roar, shaking heaven and earth, causing Qin Sang’s mind to tremble.

A brilliant golden light erupted from the front of the chariot. Within the dazzling light, a slender phantom took shape, its body writhing, with dragon horns on its head and golden scales covering its body, majestic and awe-inspiring—it was a golden dragon!

Its form was illusory, resembling a dragon soul.

The roar was indeed a dragon’s roar!

Qin Sang’s face was filled with shock, still unsure of the reason. Suddenly, a feeling arose in his heart, and he abruptly looked up, staring directly at the bright moon in the sky.

He felt a power within the moon resonating with the chariot beneath him.

Two golden chains bound the golden dragon to the chariot. Without waiting for Qin Sang’s command, it roared, its tail swaying gently, its claws treading the air, pulling the chariot, carrying Qin Sang towards the nine heavens, straight towards the Lunar Palace.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’

The night wind howled.

A dragon soared through the nine heavens!

The moon grew increasingly brighter, or rather, the center of the full moon.

Upon entering this realm, Qin Sang had noticed that the moon in this world seemed like two overlapping moons, one large and one small.

Qin Sang had a feeling that the smaller moon in the center was rapidly enlarging in his eyes.

Within the moon seemed to be a strange space, small as a mustard seed, yet seemingly vast and boundless.

Before the entrance, a celestial archway was faintly visible.

Deep blue, crafted from glazed tiles; brightly shining, adorned with precious jade.

Inscribed upon it—Southern Heaven Gate!

At the very moment the golden dragon appeared…

…

Central Lush Administrative Region, Administrative Altar.

Inside the golden hall, a Daoist abruptly awoke from his meditative trance.

…

White Stone Administrative Region, Administrative Altar.

Within a bamboo forest, a female cultivator sat in meditation, a brass bell slowly rotating before her, each rotation producing a clear chime.

The chiming abruptly ceased.

…

Ghostfang Kingdom, Great Saint’s Mansion.

A man sat in meditation on a high altar. He possessed a dignified air, wearing an imperial crown and dragon-embroidered robes. Above his head, a fragmented diagram slowly rotated.

Around the altar, figures sat within the shadows, each exuding a powerful aura.

Suddenly, as if struck by some force, everyone swayed, looking at the figure on the altar with astonishment and uncertainty.

…

Swordheart Island.

Inside the quiet chamber, True Person Wielding Sword sat with his eyes closed, a white cloth-wrapped sword planted in the ground before him. The sword vibrated, emitting a deep hum.

True Person Wielding Sword abruptly stood, stepping outside.

…

Tonight, within this realm, if anyone were outside admiring the moon, they would see a startling streak of light across the night sky, heading straight for the heavens beyond.

An immortal, riding a divine chariot, drawn by a dragon, ascending to the moon!
