<h1>Chapter 760: Completion</h1><p>A demonic water dragon appeared.</p><p>The four people holding the Black Dragon Talismans sensed the demonic energy emanating from the water dragon, and were both surprised and shocked.</p><p>This demonic energy was rarely seen in the world; though not abundant, it was extremely pure, comparable to ancient demonic energy.</p><p>They wondered what kind of expert could seal such demonic energy within a talisman.</p><p>The demonic cultivators they had encountered before had never possessed such pure demonic energy. The water dragon circled before them, creating the illusion that they were about to be eroded by the demonic energy.</p><p>The Liu couple and others were secretly alarmed.  Without hesitation, they hurriedly urged the water dragon, according to Xiang Yi's instructions, to attack the iron chains before them.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The water dragon roared wildly.</p><p>The Liu couple and others were tense, finding it extremely difficult to control the water dragon.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The four water dragons, almost simultaneously, lunged at the chains.</p><p>‘Clang…Clang…’</p><p>The chains shook violently.  The water dragon’s entire body flung itself onto and wrapped around the chains, while surging demonic energy erupted from its body, engulfing the chains.</p><p>The water dragon's true form was actually composed of demonic energy.</p><p>The chains, originally overflowing with heavenly thunder, transforming them into thunder chains, were now submerged in demonic energy.</p><p>Only the demonic energy was visible from the outside.  Occasionally, flashes of silver light could be seen within, but as the demonic energy grew denser, even the heavenly thunder could not break through.</p><p>This completely enraged the restrictions on the chains.</p><p>The chains shook wildly, with flashes of lightning and thunder.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>In an instant, the crowd's ears buzzed, and they could only hear the earth-shattering thunder.</p><p>The demonic energy began to show signs of instability, swelling repeatedly, clearly the result of the restrictions on the chains.</p><p>The heavenly thunder had erupted, but it couldn't break through the demonic energy for now, being firmly sealed within.</p><p>These four Black Dragon Talismans truly suppressed the restrictions on the chains!</p><p>However, it was clear that this suppression could not last. With the impact of the heavenly thunder, the demonic energy was being consumed at an alarming rate, gradually thinning, and would soon be completely depleted.</p><p>Xiang Yi glanced at the thunder chains. Seeing this, his expression became somewhat anxious. He whispered something to the richly dressed fat man, and the two suddenly exerted themselves simultaneously.</p><p>The jade cone struck the ancient altar's restriction, emitting a teeth-grinding sound.</p><p>Black light and golden light collided, neither yielding, locked in a stalemate.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the richly dressed fat man attacked with all their might. The jade cone suddenly spun rapidly, the black light converging towards the center, specifically targeting a point in the golden light.</p><p>The jade cone changed, and the golden light began to fluctuate frequently, becoming dimmer.</p><p>Xiang Yi muttered "Opportunity," his tiger eyes wide, and roared, “Break!”</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade cone suddenly exploded. The remaining black light, like sharp swords, pierced through.</p><p>The golden light responded, shattering, finally opening a large hole.</p><p>Xiang Yi's face lit up with joy. Without hesitation, he stomped his foot, and in a flash appeared before the golden light.</p><p>The golden light writhed; the ancient restriction was automatically restoring itself.</p><p>Through the golden light, the full view of the ancient altar inside could be seen.</p><p>As expected, the golden light was merely a manifestation of the ancient restriction. The altar itself was very simple, built of the most basic stones, without even any carvings.</p><p>Although the ancient restriction had been broken, the damaged areas still possessed extraordinary power. Xiang Yi was well aware that their success in breaking the restriction wasn't due to their strength, but to these strange talismans.</p><p>Xiang Yi's heart pounded, but he steeled his resolve and rushed in.</p><p>Outside the ancient altar, everyone nervously watched Xiang Yi's actions.</p><p>Once the task was completed, they could leave. The defection of the Pan cultivator had wasted some time, but fortunately, the task was relatively easy, and the time spent was still more than enough.</p><p>After Xiang Yi entered, he stood on the first step of the altar.</p><p>The four iron chains vibrated even more violently. Heavenly thunder fell like rain. The increasingly thin demonic energy was gradually becoming difficult to contain, but otherwise, no other unusual phenomena occurred.</p><p>The ancient altar was quiet.</p><p>Xiang Yi looked up, then quickly rushed towards the top of the altar.</p><p>At this moment, everyone suddenly turned to look behind them, hearing the roar of a beast.</p><p>The emergence of the altar had already caused quite a stir. The suppression of the chains and the resulting eruption of heavenly thunder must have alarmed even more beasts.</p><p>However, the number of beasts was far smaller than expected. Everyone immediately understood the reason: the previous battle caused by the Pan cultivator had drawn many beasts away.</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone's faces brightened, feeling a significant reduction in pressure.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The first beast entered everyone's sight, shaped like a lion, its roar shaking the heavens, comparable to sonic-wave magic.</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Liu, his gaze slightly clouded, produced a bell from his palm.  He gently shook it, a clear, crisp chime echoing out, spreading in visible waves.</p><p>The bell’s sound wasn't loud, but the moment it rang, the beasts’ roars were abruptly suppressed.</p><p>A beast, enraged, bared its claws and teeth, preparing to pounce.  The bell’s waves reached its body.</p><p>With a “poof,” the beast’s eyes bulged, two streams of blood spurting out before it collapsed, lifeless.  Its body was unmarked except for its eyes, yet it died instantly.</p><p>Similar scenes played out elsewhere.  A large group of beasts surrounded the five cultivators, who simultaneously activated talismans and hunted the creatures, all while keeping a close eye on Xiang Yi’s actions.</p><p>Xiang Yi had already reached the top of the ancient altar. He crouched there for a moment, then retrieved an item from his pouch.</p><p>Those below couldn't see clearly, but it looked like another talisman.</p><p>Xiang Yi grasped the object, aimed it at the center of the altar, and muttered incantations.  Dark energy surged from his palm, then receded.</p><p>Xiang Yi then shouted, flipped his hand, and pressed it firmly against the ancient altar.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The ancient altar trembled.</p><p>Xiang Yi withdrew his hand, anxiously watching below.  Noticing no further changes to the altar, a smile spread across his face. He swiftly descended, burst through the barrier, and announced, “Mission accomplished!  Fellow cultivators, prepare to retreat!”</p><p>The others were astonished.  They looked up at the top of the ancient altar.  “It’s already done?”</p><p>No one had seen Xiang Yi retrieve any treasure; it seemed he had left something behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the final stage was not only without complications, but remarkably easy.</p><p>Had they deployed so many people, entered the Purple Mist Wilderness, and lured out the ancient altar, only to not retrieve a treasure?</p><p>Xiang Yi chuckled, “Did you think it would be so difficult? The Merchant Guild would have assessed our cultivation levels before assigning the task. They wouldn’t send us to a place only Yuan Ying masters could enter.  Retreat carefully, then activate the Black Dragon Talisman. The heavenly thunder on the Lightning Rope will deal with the beasts.”</p><p>“Daoist Xiang makes a good point.”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Liu visibly relaxed, a relieved smile gracing his face.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they slowly retreated. Once a safe distance was achieved, they gave the command, and fled without looking back, regrouping outside the Purple Mist Wilderness and making a swift exit.</p>
