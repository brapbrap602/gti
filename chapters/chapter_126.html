Chapter 119: Blood Core Pill


Before Gu Tiannan and his disciple could capture the Black-robed Youth, Qin Sang heard roars coming from the mountains. They did not sound human, but like the cries of a wild beast.


He dashed behind a rock and saw what was happening in the mountain pass, and he could not help but feel a chill.


The Black-robed Youth was covered in wounds and was at the end of his rope. The flying needle he had was broken, and could only be used to obstruct Gu Yuan.


Additionally, Gu Tiannan’s appearance was terrifying. His face had contorted until he was unrecognizable, and his flesh and blood had swollen. He towered over his previous height, grotesque veins protruded from his thick limbs, and his hands and feet resembled animal paws. He had turned into a beast of pure ugliness.


Gu Tiannan let out a horrible roar from his throat, and his bloodshot eyes glared at the Black-robed Youth, filled with endless madness and devoid of any reason.


Based on his appearance, there was no way to tell that he was once Gu Tiannan. His humanity was completely gone.


Not only were Gu Tiannan’s movements swift, his body was also incredibly tough. His ten fingers were like knives and easily crushed a boulder. His physical strength alone overwhelmed the Black-robed Youth.


The Black-robed Youth’s offense was unable to impede him in the slightest. It was like attacking iron; there was not even a scratch.


It was just as the Cat Monster said. Right now, Gu Tiannan’s destructive power was comparable to a Qi Refining Stage Thirteenth Layer cultivator. He did not know what method he used to conceal it, but he had not revealed any traces of it at all!


The Black-robed Youth was utterly suppressed by Gu Tiannan and could no longer persevere. Before he died, he looked in the direction where Qin Sang and the White Cat were hiding. Despite being so far away, Qin Sang could still feel the thick yearning in his eyes.


‘Bang!’


After being struck in the back by Gu Tiannan’s claws, the Black-robed Youth heavily collapsed on the ground. He had just started to stand up when Gu Tiannan used one hand to crush his throat, snuffing out his life.


‘Hehehe…’


Gu Tiannan arched his back and gasped for air, holding the Black-robed Youth’s neck tightly. His arms trembled intensely, as if he were desperately trying to suppress his murderous instincts.


When he saw this, Gu Yuan hastily sheathed his short sword, and dashed behind Gu Tiannan. He flicked his wrist and launched several silver needles into Gu Tiannan’s scalp, and shouted, “Master!”


Awakened by Gu Yuan, the bloodshot in Gu Tiannan’s eyes gradually faded, and he regained a bit of clarity. Reason eventually won out, and his body emitted a series of cracking sounds. He returned to his human form, but his face was even paler than before.


Gu Tiannan stumbled and nearly collapsed to the ground, but Gu Yuan caught him.


“Cough cough… Quick!”


Gu Tiannan coughed several times violently, and his voice was extremely weak and urgent. “Quick! Quick, get his heart!”


Gu Yuan replied immediately, supported Gu Tiannan as he sat on the ground, and crouched down beside the Black-robed Youth. He reached inside the Youth’s chest, pulled out his bloody heart, and handed it to Gu Tiannan.


The heart leaked bright red blood, but was covered in an eerie blue-black color.


Gu Tiannan grabbed the heart and gazed at it with incomparable greed. His eyes burned with desire, and he suddenly coughed violently several times. His expression changed greatly, and he infused his spiritual energy into his fingers, and quickly tapped several times on the heart.


The heart convulsed, and suddenly, black magic flames arose and flickered. Afterwards, they melted into a dark, liquid form, and finally condensed into two pills—one large and one small.


They looked like two medicinal pills.


Gu Tiannan threw the smaller one to Gu Yuan, and then immediately swallowed the one in his hand.


Gu Yuan received the pill with excitement and swallowed it as well.


The master and disciple duo sat in meditation to refine the pills, and after a while, a faint ruddy glow appeared on Gu Tiannan’s face. His previous weakness had completely vanished, and his overall complexion had improved.


Gu Yuan let out a satisfied moan, opened his eyes, and asked, “Master, how do you feel?”


Gu Tiannan gave a sound of affirmation, checked his body, and nodded. He said with great relief, “Fortunately, I got this Blood Core Pill in time. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.”


Gu Yuan said with resentment, “This kid is too difficult to deal with!”


Gu Tiannan snorted coldly. “If it were not for that Cat Monster who came from nowhere, and whose methods are too strange, they would have escaped several times already. How could we have let him run free for so long! By the way…”


Gu Tiannan suddenly looked up towards the path they came from. There were gigantic waves within the intense azure light, and it was extremely turbulent. It was obvious that the battle inside was intense.

"Any movement from the Qin?"
"Rest assured, Master," Gu Yuan stretched his muscles and bones, "Your disciple has been keeping an eye on the place. That Qin fellow doesn't seem very strong, yet he's managed to keep that cat demon occupied. The blue light has been constant, they have been fighting without pause and wouldn't have noticed our actions."
Gu Tiannan nodded, scanning the chaotic battlefield, "Good. Let's clean up here first to avoid detection. Don't underestimate him. I believe this man is cunning and deceitful, we mustn't reveal any flaws."
Master and disciple sprang into action, Gu Tiannan meticulously erasing the traces on the black-robed youth's body.
Using his short sword to slash and obscure the view, Gu Yuan concealed the claw marks left by Gu Tiannan on the battlefield. He asked in a probing tone, "Master, what about that situation? It seems as though the Qin fellow and the cat demon might end up mutually wounded."
Gu Tiannan glared at him fiercely, "This is Mount Shaohua. No matter how careful we are, we cannot possibly remove all traces. We almost had an accident this time. Do you still dare to touch someone from Mount Shaohua? Do you seek death?"
Gu Yuan forced a smile, "Master, you said earlier that we should change locations. It would be a shame to leave without making some gains. If the Qin fellow were to kill the cat demon, we naturally wouldn't provoke him. If he were to be killed by the cat demon, that would be considered a common occurrence, we could only say that his abilities were inferior. Mount Shaohua couldn't possibly blame us for that. I reckon that the Qin fellow has a strong foundation. After we leave the protection of Mount Shaohua, that flying shuttle could be extremely useful..."
...
At this moment, the man and the cat retreated quietly.
The white cat spoke with lingering fear, "In our previous encounters with Gu Tiannan, he wasn't as terrifying or frenzied. My Lord should believe it now. We do not request for you to kill him, we only wish for you to have compassion for those可怜 people harmed by Gu Tiannan and report this incident in detail to your sect. Any righteous immortal sect should not tolerate such a fiend harming the mortal world, right?"
Qin Sang had a contemplative expression on his face. At these words, he glanced at the white cat and said, "None of the villagers from Black Tiger Ravine died. Gu Tiannan would have definitely noticed the discrepancy unless he were a fool. By the time I return from requesting aid from my sect, he would have long since fled."
The white cat sighed softly, "Hei Wa was not able to bring himself to kill him, he only killed those who were evildoers."
Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly as he thought about Gu Tiannan.
Without a doubt, Gu Tiannan's realm was indeed Qi Condensation, 13th Layer.
When Gu Tiannan left his sect, he was only Qi Condensation, 8th Layer. At his age at the time, it could be considered fortunate if he was able to break through the 9th Layer bottleneck. Otherwise, he would not have had to hide his true realm out of fear of suspicion.
His cultivation at Qi Condensation, 13th Layer was highly abnormal. It could definitely be attributed to that demonic technique!
