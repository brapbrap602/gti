<h1>Chapter 1372 The Old Ghost Feng</h1><p>Azure light, scarlet radiance, and a shadow beneath the sea surface.</p><p>In pursuit.</p><p>The distance between them gradually widened.</p><p>The three demon kings' expressions changed slightly.</p><p>Among the three demons, the Toadfish possessed unique divine abilities.</p><p>The One-legged Divine Bird was not only highly cultivated, but its escape techniques were also rarely matched among the demon race.</p><p>If a lone human Nascent Soul cultivator were entangled by them, the chances of escape would be slim, yet now they encountered a fellow whose speed surpassed even theirs.</p><p>"Thunder Escape Technique!"</p><p>The Little Fox cried out coquettishly, "There's no mistaking it! It's definitely Thunder Escape!"</p><p>"Thunder Escape, among the human race, this divine ability is not common. The difficulty of cultivating it far exceeds the similarly swift Wind Escape Technique. Among the major top forces of the human race, I've never heard of any hiding such a secret art. What is this guy's background?"</p><p>The Toadfish transmitted its voice over.</p><p>Its tone was somewhat urgent, barely keeping up, and with great difficulty.</p><p>The One-legged Divine Bird pondered, "It's not necessarily that they don't have treasures. Perhaps it's been passed down without anyone being able to cultivate it, left gathering dust on a high shelf. Now, a sufficiently talented individual has appeared, and it has only now reappeared. You also said that Thunder Escape Technique is difficult to cultivate. Among our demon race, even those with bloodlines naturally attuned to thunder and lightning often fail to comprehend Thunder Escape… That thunder art just now, and the Thunder Escape divine ability, indicate that this person may be a pure Thunder Cultivator. Human Thunder Cultivators mostly come from General Thunder Mansion, but General Thunder Mansion is quite far from here. Why did he appear here? Moreover, his aura is weak, as if he had just fought a great battle with an enemy?"</p><p>The Little Fox said, "This person is a mid-stage Nascent Soul. Besides our demon realm, where can't one go in this vast world? It's rumored that General Thunder Mansion cultivators are fierce and quick-tempered, making enemies everywhere. I just wonder what kind of opponent he encountered. Could it be other fellow cultivators?"</p><p>The One-legged Divine Bird was startled, its expression changed slightly, "No warning messages have been sent from elsewhere, could it be…"</p><p>The Toadfish transmitted its voice again, reassuring, "The other fellow cultivators are all acting in groups, they shouldn't be easily killed by one person. However, such an expert appearing in this sea area for no reason, whether passing through, or invited by Old Ghost Feng as a helper, we must not let him leave! Otherwise, Old Ghost Feng will have such a strong ally, making him even harder to deal with! Encountering him when he's weak is a godsend."</p><p>The Little Fox and the One-legged Divine Bird both agreed with the Toadfish's judgment.</p><p>Seeing the azure light flying further and further away.</p><p>The Toadfish's tone became increasingly urgent, "Friend Hu, how long before your injuries heal? I can burn my true blood to greatly increase my speed for a short time, but I need your help."</p><p>The Little Fox looked down at its hind leg, the wound already showing signs of healing.</p><p>The three demons had deep friendship.</p><p>The Little Fox understood the Toadfish's intention.</p><p>The Little Fox had a secret art that perfectly matched the Toadfish's innate divine ability. The combination could enhance the power of the Toadfish's divine ability, but it required prior preparation and full concentration to perform.</p><p>However, the Little Fox's expression was hesitant, "It would be unwise for you to pursue him alone… The human race is accustomed to using magical treasures. This person has only displayed one top-tier thunder art, we don't even know what his Natal Magic Treasure is. Moreover, he has a Nascent Soul-level puppet protecting him. I've always been acutely aware of danger. Just now, I faintly felt a threat to my life from this person, not just from that thunder art…"</p><p>The Little Fox was still fearful.</p><p>If not for its companion's timely rescue, it might have already fallen under the heavenly thunder!</p><p>The One-legged Divine Bird also echoed, "I alone would probably be uncertain of victory against this person. A cornered beast will still fight. Even if this person is in a weakened state, he should not be underestimated. It's better to just hang back and see how long he can last. When his True Essence is exhausted, we can slaughter him at will."</p><p>The Toadfish was silent for a moment, its tone not optimistic, "The commotion is too great, if we continue chasing, I fear we'll attract Old Ghost Feng. We only need to entangle him for a moment, until Friend Bifang catches up. As long as I'm careful, I can still protect myself. From the earlier exchange, we can see that his Nascent Soul puppet is nearing its limit, it's not a threat…"</p><p>Bifang was the One-legged Divine Bird's Dharma name.</p><p>Its appearance was far from the mythical Bifang Divine Beast. The only similarity was that it had only one leg, a far-fetched association, thus it took that honorific.</p><p>In the end, the Bifang and the Little Fox were persuaded by the Toadfish.</p><p>Before long, the black Qi in the Little Fox's wound was completely expelled, gradually healing.</p><p>Exhaling a mouthful of foul air.</p><p>The Little Fox let out a low growl.</p><p>The Bifang lowered its altitude, flying almost skimming the surface of the sea, the Toadfish desperately closing in.</p><p>Only to see a faint golden light flashing in the Little Fox's demon eyes, strange runes weaving in its pupils, ultimately transforming into a '卐' character seal, flashing and imprinting on the Toadfish's forehead.</p><p>The seal left its body, the Little Fox revealing a deep sense of exhaustion, clearly this secret art consumed a great deal of energy.</p><p>The Toadfish didn't resist in the slightest, allowing the seal to enter its body.</p><p>In an instant, a layer of golden light flowed around the Toadfish's body, transforming it into a dazzling golden fish.</p><p>The next moment, the golden light subsided.</p><p>The Toadfish's belly swelled, a muffled thunder-like sound coming from within its body, pushing off with its hind legs, its mouth wide open, spitting out a ball of light interwoven with green and gold, transforming into a layer of transparent thin clothing, closely adhering to its body.</p><p>Strangely, its speed didn't increase. The shadow beneath the surface of the water was clearly visible, still trailing behind the Bifang.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was racing, escaping while contemplating ways to break free.</p><p>Noticing the enemy gradually falling behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind slightly eased, but he did not relax his vigilance.</p><p>Just then, the Celestial Eye Butterfly suddenly detected an anomaly coming from beneath the surface of the water.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned cold, and the palm hidden in his sleeve tightly gripped the Demon Banner.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Without warning, the sea surface exploded, a figure soaring into the sky.</p><p>It was the Toadfish!</p><p>Giving Qin Sang no time to react, the void ahead was a green and glittering expanse, filled with green light. Qin Sang was caught off guard and plunged headfirst into it.</p><p>Struck by the green light, Qin Sang's escape technique was affected, and his expression showed a hint of absent-mindedness, his gaze dull.</p><p>The Toadfish cackled strangely.</p><p>The green light was its most prized divine ability, not only able to restrict enemies, but also containing potent poison. Using this method alone, it didn't know how many opponents stronger than itself it had ambushed to their deaths.</p><p>This fellow was eager to escape, in such haste, how could he withstand such a sneak attack.</p><p>The Toadfish swung its body, swimming into the green light, its eyes containing a fierce light, about to take advantage of Qin Sang's mental lapse to deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>The next moment, the fierce light suddenly turned into shock.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Demon Banner shot out from his sleeve.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Flame followed closely behind, transforming into a fire dragon.</p><p>When the Demon Flame appeared in the world, the green light was unable to hinder the Demon Flame in the slightest.</p><p>In a destructive manner, the Demon Flame broke through the green light, its momentum fierce, rushing towards the Toadfish.</p><p>Through the Demon Flame, the Toadfish saw Qin Sang's mocking gaze, noticing a layer of poison-repelling armor on Qin Sang's body, its heart filled with endless regret.</p><p>During the earlier exchange, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet had experienced the power of the green light. Qin Sang knew that the green light contained poison, so he awakened the Fat Silkworm in advance to guard against the Toadfish.</p>
