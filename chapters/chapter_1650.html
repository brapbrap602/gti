<h1>Chapter 1641: The Wordless Jade Disc</h1><p>Chapter 1641: The Wordless Jade Disc</p><p>Demonic flames swirled around the Gu King, forming a small ring of fire to contain it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Gu King was extremely ferocious.</p><p>Without its master's control, its true savagery was unleashed.</p><p>Blocked by the demonic flames, the Gu King flew into a rage.</p><p>Its wings vibrated furiously, producing a piercing buzzing sound.</p><p>Unafraid of the demonic flames, it opened its mandibles and spewed a torrent of venom, countering the fire.</p><p>"The venom is incredibly potent, almost too ferocious!  It seems rather unintelligent.  This thing truly is a terrifying creation!"</p><p>Qin Sang, having encircled the Gu King with demonic flames, didn't immediately attempt to subdue it. Instead, he quickly moved to the near-corpse of the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>Upon seeing the man's condition, Qin Sang's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>In such a short time, the grotesque-faced man's condition had become extremely critical. His nascent soul was ashen, and showed almost no signs of life.</p><p>The Gu King's venom was even more terrifying than Qin Sang had imagined!</p><p>"Wait... that's not right..."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his spiritual sense across the body and unexpectedly discovered that only one type of poison was ravaging the man's body. The poison's destructive power was terrifying, capable of killing instantly!</p><p>The grotesque-faced man had been poisoned by both the Wan Du Mountain poisons and the Gu King's venom; his body should contain two distinct poisons.</p><p>"Could it be... the two poisons have fused?"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang.</p><p>The Gu King's aura was very similar to the Gu insects cultivated from the Wan Du Mountain's Gu Scripture.  Wan Du Mountain viewed the grotesque-faced man as an enemy and gave a seemingly unrelated person a treasure to subdue him, their main target being the Gu King!</p><p>It was even possible that the Gu King was specifically cultivated by Wan Du Mountain.</p><p>Once the Gu King matured, the fusion of its venom with the Wan Du Mountain's most potent poison would result in a venom of unimaginable potency, arguably the most deadly poison in the world.</p><p>The two poisons were drastically different, and if not for the confluence of circumstances - the Gu King's counterattack and the subsequent fusion of the poisons within the grotesque-faced man - Qin Sang wouldn't have discovered this secret.</p><p>"Once this potent venom is perfected, I wonder if it could even threaten a Nascent Divinity cultivator. At the very least, a Nascent Soul cultivator would have to retreat..."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed. The various sects of Central Plains were truly not to be underestimated; their foundations ran deep.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang prepared to use the poison pearl, hoping to use its purifying aura to suppress the poison and prolong the grotesque-faced man's life, even for a short time.</p><p>However, before he could act, the light in the nascent soul rapidly faded, as if a ferocious beast was rapidly devouring its life force.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man had been severely injured by a lightning strike, and the new, potent poison fused and erupted within him, resulting in such a tragic outcome.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang discovered that the new poison was attempting to spread along his spiritual sense.  Alarmed, he quickly withdrew his spiritual sense.</p><p>At this point, he had already activated his spiritual sense to forcefully break the restrictions on his pouch, saw its contents, and decided against further action.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Seven Souls Killing Formation had successfully sealed the remnant soul of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, which was another reason Qin Sang gave up on rescue efforts.</p><p>In an instant, the grotesque-faced man's nascent soul was tortured beyond recognition, emitting a foul stench before finally exploding into a cloud of blood mist, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>With a major threat eliminated, Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings.</p><p>"Devastated" wouldn't even begin to describe the state of Bing Yi Palace. While initially chaotic, the main structure had remained; now, everything was leveled and frozen solid by the frigid air emanating from the azure light, forming an ice sheet even larger than the palace itself, and still spreading.</p><p>The wind was bitterly cold.</p><p>The azure light, having released its energy, still persisted, a long-lasting pillar of light.</p><p>Such a conspicuous phenomenon would surely be visible throughout the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, and reinforcements would be on their way.</p><p>"We can't stay here!"</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly moved, attempting to erase any traces of the battle. The residual shockwaves of the formation had already largely destroyed the battlefield, so the cleanup wasn't too difficult.</p><p>His clone was also busy.</p><p>Using the remaining true essence, he rushed into the remains of the palace, pushing through the azure light and into the ruined underground hall.</p><p>The location of the Dark Hall was now a deep crater, the hall above completely leveled.  However, although the ice platform was heavily fractured, the mysterious ice disc remained undamaged.</p><p>Before the ambush, the avatar had identified several key nodes in the spirit array, deducing that the mysterious ice disc would not be affected by the destruction of the array.  Such an important treasure—the person who set up the array must have considered this, ensuring the disc wouldn't be destroyed here.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ice disc was recalled.</p><p>The avatar examined it carefully and clicked his tongue.</p><p>While the disc was intact, the cold energy within was significantly depleted, requiring a long time to replenish.</p><p>However, my main body is still far from achieving the Divine Transformation stage.  Besides, I've memorized the ice platform's structure. Finding a suitable cave to re-establish the array and help the disc recover is the priority.</p><p>Nothing to linger on.</p><p>The avatar completely destroyed the Dark Hall, returning to the battlefield with the mysterious ice disc. The second Nascent Soul retreated into the main body for cultivation and recovery.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had subdued the remnant soul of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and returned to the side of the Gu King.  Finding the Gu King too ferocious to subdue immediately, he simply wrapped it in demonic fire and took it away.</p><p>After Qin Sang left,</p><p>the azure celestial light shifted from its peak intensity to decline, the pillar gradually dissipating and slowly disappearing.</p><p>The aftershocks left a thick layer of ice on the Ice Instrument Palace ruins, leaving it uncertain when it would all melt.</p><p>Soon after,</p><p>a figure appeared at the edge of the ice sheet's southeastern side, gradually becoming clearer—Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan surveyed the area, unable to discern anything significant. Raising his right hand, he forced out a ball of blood mist, transforming it into a blood shadow, about to release it to investigate beneath the ice.</p><p>At that moment, he sensed something and abruptly looked towards the northwest.  Seeing two figures approaching swiftly and without concealment, his expression darkened, but surprise quickly flickered in his eyes.</p><p>“Two esteemed masters, what brings you here?  Impressive techniques!”</p><p>As the figures drew closer, Su Zinan said with a smirk, whether in praise or sarcasm, it was unclear.</p><p>The arrivals were Zi Lei Zhenren and He Gao Zhenren.</p><p>With his intelligence, seeing the two masters from the Eight Scenic Views here, he immediately understood the reason.</p><p>However, having not participated in the battle for the array, he was unaware of some details, leaving him with many questions.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The two masters also stopped at the edge of the ice sheet, facing Su Zinan from afar.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren looked down at the ice sheet, observing it carefully.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren, seemingly harboring an old grudge with Su Zinan, unceremoniously threatened: "Su, you dare collude with the remnants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. Aren't you afraid of depleting the legacy of Old Master Lu?"</p><p>Su Zinan responded with a cold laugh, "Su has long desired to witness the divine powers of the Daoist sect…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Su Zinan's right ear twitched, his expression becoming remarkably expressive as he clicked his tongue in admiration several times, his gaze sweeping across the scene: "Where is Sect Master Yue?  Could he have been killed by the Old Devils?"</p><p>He Gao Zhenren's face darkened, suddenly turning to stare at a distant mountain peak, shouting: "Who dares to hide? Show yourself!"</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Su Zinan chuckled coldly, not intending to stay long. He retracted the blood shadow and disappeared, leaving behind a few sarcastic remarks before leaving: "Su awaits to see how you will control everything here!"</p><p>Seeing Su Zinan flee, He Gao Zhenren looked to Zi Lei Zhenren.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren ignored Su Zinan, flying to the original site of the Dark Hall and staring for a long time.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren did not pursue him.</p><p>The shadows in the forest swayed.</p><p>Su Zinan flew to this point and entered the woods, seeing a figure emerge from behind a tree—Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"Daoist Friend Mo!"</p><p>Su Zinan clasped his hands in a greeting. He didn't explain his actions, and Mo Xingdao didn't ask.</p><p>The two exchanged a few brief words.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was somewhat surprised, "The one who destroyed the Water Phase Hall wasn't Daoist Friend Su?"</p><p>Su Zinan denied, "I was also drawn here by the light pillar…Su doesn't cultivate water-type divine abilities; what use would I have for the Water Phase Hall's inheritance? I assume it was that man in white robes and another fellow who clashed. Now they're both gone, the battlefield traces erased by the remnants of the array.  It’s unclear what treasure they were fighting over, or who won."</p><p>After a pause, Su Zinan countered, "Besides me, who else wasn't at the top of the cliff?"</p><p>"The centipede-faced one who traveled with the Weeping Spirit Cave Master is also missing…"</p><p>Mo Xingdao spoke freely, "However, during the struggle for the teleportation array, besides the Daoist sect, there was an uninvited guest, not aligned with them.  He was skilled in sword arrays, his swordsmanship almost suppressing Yue Lingtian…"</p><p>Upon hearing Mo Xingdao's description, Su Zinan's pupils constricted slightly, "Could it be him?  The Old Devils thought their actions were secretive, but they had obvious flaws, already noticed by the Daoist sect.  A few more yellow sparrows wouldn't be surprising."</p><p>I've long suspected Huo Mo is a descendant of the Fire Clan…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Mo Xingdao interrupted, "In my humble opinion, friend, it's best to put aside your grievances for now."</p><p>Su Zinan paused, then continued listening to Mo Xingdao's explanation. He learned that Zhu Wu Dao had traded secrets of Di Shou Mountain for help.  The mountain not only held countless treasures, but also a chance at transcendence!</p><p>"The Wordless Jade Tablet!"</p><p>Su Zinan murmured, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Su Zinan suddenly said, "This opportunity is precious, but there are many rivals.  Securing it won't be easy, no need to rush. I have a secret treasure that needs refining beforehand. Once a fight breaks out, it will greatly increase our chances! I hope Daoist Mo will wait a moment and protect me."</p><p>Mo Xingdao frowned, but ultimately agreed.</p><p>The two Daoist masters and Yue Lingtian were undoubtedly the strongest. The Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the Centipede-Faced man acted together. Zhu Wu Dao seemed to be a lone wolf, but he knew many secrets of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's strength alone was limited; joining forces with Su Zinan was the wise choice.</p><p>Su Zinan was overjoyed and immediately created a cave.</p><p>He set up restrictions to prevent detection.</p><p>Su Zinan sat cross-legged and summoned the Three Corpses Death God Banner.</p><p>The demonic banner fluttered.</p><p>The light within the banner became more subdued.</p><p>He gazed at the banner, his mind stirred, and two figures floated from its surface: Lao Wu and Yan Shan Old Man. Yan Shan Old Man ultimately couldn't escape, becoming the banner's main spirit.</p><p>Su Zinan gently beckoned to Yan Shan Old Man.</p><p>The transformed Yan Shan Old Man obediently flew before Su Zinan, his expression vacant, staring blankly as Su Zinan raised his hand and pressed it against its brow.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Yan Shan Old Man's features suddenly contorted.</p><p>Simultaneously, Su Zinan felt resistance from Yan Shan Old Man. Under Yan Shan Old Man's influence, Lao Wu also showed signs of unrest.</p><p>It wasn't that Lao Wu hadn't been refined by the banner, but that the three main spirits of the banner were closely connected, instinctively resisting. Each time a new spirit was subdued, this process had to be repeated.</p><p>Therefore, refining the second main spirit was more difficult than the first, forcing Su Zinan to retreat for cultivation.</p><p>Su Zinan wasn't worried about the main spirit turning against him.  He simply strengthened the cave's restrictions several more layers, and then, amidst Yan Shan Old Man's screams, firmly pressed down on its brow.</p><p>…</p><p>"The Wordless Jade Tablet!"</p><p>These four words echoed in another cave.</p><p>After leaving Bing Yi Palace and confirming no pursuers, Qin Sang also found a secluded spot, creating a cave to rest and recover.</p><p>Before he could inventory his spoils, he discovered that the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's remnant soul was unstable.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master had been severely harmed, finally forced into the spirit wood body by the strange-faced man, already at the end of his rope. After being imprisoned by Qin Sang, his soul energy rapidly decayed.</p><p>Having no choice, Qin Sang immediately used the soul-searching technique.</p><p>Soul-searching a powerful cultivator's remnant soul was still no easy feat. Qin Sang relied on his powerful consciousness; he wasn't searching for overly detailed information, allowing him to succeed.</p><p>He was most concerned with Di Shou Mountain's opportunity for transcendence, and he successfully obtained information.</p><p>"Di Shou Mountain is a must-go, but…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the tribulation array.</p><p>He had the ice disk and some ice-fire tokens, and he had memorized the Taiji Immortal Terrace array, but he was still missing a crucial item: the fire-attribute treasure corresponding to the ice disk.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that this treasure was held by the Fire Aspect Hall, and he would definitely have to go to Huo Xi Island.</p><p>"We have to separate again…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at his clone, who was diligently cultivating.</p><p>He didn't want to miss either opportunity, so he could only separate again, sending his clone to Huo Xi Island. Qin Sang took out two jade bottles containing two Boiling Snow Pills.</p><p>He already knew the effects of these pills.</p><p>"I'll have the clone take one Boiling Snow Pill. Even if they encounter a powerful cultivator and can't escape, as long as they reach the foot of Di Shou Mountain, I can rescue them."</p><p>Qin Sang prepared for the worst, giving one to his clone.</p><p>At this moment, the ravaged remnant soul finally dissipated.</p><p>He killed two powerful cultivators and didn't even use a single Boiling Snow Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the soul dissipate, feeling both satisfaction and a touch of melancholy.</p><p>During the soul-searching, he also learned some of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's secrets.</p><p>This person was adept at ghost arts, excelling in deception; his escape techniques were particularly outstanding, but unfortunately, Qin Sang pulled him into the flag array, preventing him from using many of his abilities.</p><p>If the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the strange-faced man had switched places, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to guarantee that he could have captured him.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's belongings were destroyed in the flag array. At the time, to quickly deal with a strong enemy, Qin Sang couldn't afford to hesitate for external objects; letting the strange-faced man escape would have been a huge loss.</p><p>However, Qin Sang unexpectedly learned that the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was skilled in nurturing spirits. In his cave, he had a large medicinal garden with many rare herbs, thriving impressively.</p><p>This man took a unique approach, using refined souls to cultivate the herbs, calling them blood medicines.  His current cultivation was inseparable from these blood medicines; he was truly a genius.</p><p>He controlled several "disciples," scattered throughout various places, collecting refined souls for him.  But his nurturing spirit techniques were closely guarded secrets, always personally managed.</p><p>With the Weeping Spirit Cave Master dead, the medicinal garden was ownerless, a windfall for Qin Sang.</p>
