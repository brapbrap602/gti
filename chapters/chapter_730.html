Chapter 722 Suppression


A circular mirror phantom appeared above the black-armored man's head.  The phantom spun rapidly, its surface finally facing the Twin-Headed Serpent, light flickering.
"No strong demonic aura. It seems to have wandered here on its own, attracted by the Coldflame..."
The black-armored man relaxed, withdrawing the mirror phantom. His aura fluctuated violently.  Activating the mirror phantom seemed to consume a lot of energy, even he appeared strained.

His tension vanished, replaced by amusement as he sized up the Twin-Headed Serpent.  He sneered, "A Twin-Headed Serpent. It's been a long time since I've seen one outside... Since you've come to my doorstep, don't even think about leaving!"

His voice still echoing, he stomped his foot, leaving phantom images on the water as he lunged forward.  He swung his arm, and the black spear's tip shot out streaks of dark light.  In moments, these lights formed the shape of a black phoenix, lifelike and vivid.

The phoenix cried out, its tail trailing long plumes, its form incredibly elegant. It swooped down from midair, charging towards the Twin-Headed Serpent.

The Twin-Headed Serpent hissed, its dual pupils blazing with fierce light as the cyan light intensified.

Two whirlwinds merged into one, countless sharp wind blades spinning within, like a meat grinder.

The black phoenix, undeterred, plunged into the whirlwind.

At that moment, its wings spread wide, its body becoming ethereal.  A black ring burst from within, rapidly expanding.

The phoenix almost disappeared, leaving only the giant black ring.

With perfect timing, the ring exploded at the whirlwind's center.

Booming sounds echoed, waves surged, cyan and black light quickly merging.  Black light clearly dominated, easily tearing through the cyan, sweeping away the wind blades.

Seeing the black light penetrate the whirlwind and about to hit it, the Twin-Headed Serpent revealed a look of shock and terror.  It flapped its wind-like wings and retreated frantically.

Dodging the attack, the Twin-Headed Serpent glanced at the Coldflame, then turned to flee.

The black-armored man snorted, his speed suddenly increasing.

The fleeing Twin-Headed Serpent abruptly split into six incredibly realistic phantoms. Seven identical Twin-Headed Serpents scattered, each escaping in a different direction.

Each serpent moved with nearly identical speed and agility, making it difficult to distinguish the real one from the phantoms based on their aura.

For a moment, Twin-Headed Serpents seemed to be heading east, north, and south.

The black-armored man seemed unfazed by the serpent's trick.  His black spear trembled, splitting into seven identical copies.

With seven spears floating before him, the black-armored man glanced at them, flicking his fingers. Each spear unerringly targeted a Twin-Headed Serpent.

'Boom, boom...'

Giant waves erupted.

Four Twin-Headed Serpents were pierced by the spear phantoms and shattered, proving to be illusions. But the other three nimbly dodged the attacks.

The black-armored man had anticipated this, but he hadn't expected to lose track of the real serpent amongst the remaining ones.

As the three Twin-Headed Serpents flew further away, the black-armored man frowned, sweeping his hand across his waist and retrieving an arm-thick bamboo tube.

The foot-long tube was fresh and vibrant, as if newly cut.

The black-armored man muttered an incantation.  The sound of rushing water came from the tube, followed by a stream of water that flowed out.  Writhing and shifting, the water transformed into strangely shaped water birds.

With a point of his finger, the flock divided into three groups.  The water birds shot out like arrows from a bowstring.

'Bang, bang, bang...'

The water birds exploded like cannonballs upon impact with the Twin-Headed Serpents.  The struck serpents' movements became erratic, quickly revealing the real one to the black-armored man.

He sneered and pursued the middle serpent.

As the Twin-Headed Serpent desperately fled towards the Coldflame Island, Qin Sang, submerged beneath the surface, silently approached, reaching the vicinity of the Winter Nether Coldflame undetected.

Even underwater, he could sense the Winter Nether Coldflame's violent aura.

Qin Sang looked up. The shimmering water surface was dotted with blue lights. He chose one, surfaced, and cautiously approached it.

From his previous encounter, Qin Sang knew the Winter Nether Coldflame's nature.  If his True Essence touched it, it would erupt, exposing him.

It all depended on whether the Nine Nether Demonic Flame could suppress the Winter Nether Coldflame.

Qin Sang spread his hand, placing the miniature Ten Directions Yama Banner around him and drawing out the Nine Nether Demonic Flame.

Worried that the Nine Nether Demonic Flame would provoke all the Winter Nether Coldflames, he carefully concealed its aura, lifting his hand as the flame moved towards one of the Coldflames.

He watched nervously, ready to flee at any moment.

The Nine Nether Demonic Flame drew closer and closer.

As if sensing something amiss, the Winter Nether Coldflame began to flicker violently, a sign of imminent eruption.  Qin Sang's heart leaped into his throat.

When the Nine Nether Demonic Flame reached the Winter Nether Coldflame, Qin Sang watched as the latter's fluctuations intensified, its center surging with an intense blue light, reaching a critical point!

Qin Sang almost gave up.

The Nine Nether Demonic Flame suddenly enveloped the Winter Nether Coldflame, its powerful aura instantly revealed.

At that moment, the Winter Nether Coldflame stopped flickering, as if encountering something terrifying, and began to shrink rapidly, curling into a ball.

But the signs of eruption hadn't disappeared. While the Winter Nether Coldflame feared the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, Qin Sang sensed it hadn't truly submitted.  His flame was mostly for show; if the Winter Nether Coldflame saw through the bluff, it could still erupt.

Qin Sang quickly channeled True Essence into the Ten Directions Yama Banner, drawing out another wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Flame.

With this added strength, the Winter Nether Coldflame finally settled down, returning to its harmless appearance.

"It's truly suppressed!"

Qin Sang's anxiety finally faded, replaced by elation.

However, suppressing the Winter Nether Coldflame didn't mean he could take it.

"Suppressing just one small flame is this difficult. It seems I can't take more with my current strength."

Qin Sang looked regretfully at the other Winter Nether Coldflames. After a moment of thought, he slowly closed his hand, the Nine Nether Demonic Flame clinging to the Winter Nether Coldflame as he gently pulled it down.

Looking at the spiritual flame, Qin Sang hesitated, then reached out and carefully cupped it in his hand.

He was naturally apprehensive. He knew the Winter Nether Coldflame's power firsthand.  If it erupted in his hand, the consequences would be dire.

Having secured it, Qin Sang didn't leave immediately.  He left a few thin wisps of Nine Nether Demonic Flame behind before quietly retreating.

The black-armored man's strength was even greater than he'd imagined.  The Twin-Headed Serpent had no chance of escape.
