<h1>Chapter 1283: The Fiend</h1><p>“Whose disciples are you?  How dare you act so recklessly on the battlefield?”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly shouted.</p><p>The group, led by Fat Chicken, were about to escape their own battle lines. Even if others noticed the danger, it would be too late to rescue them.  Fat Chicken finally understood the gravity of his mistake, feeling a chill of fear.  He was speechless under Qin Sang's reprimand.</p><p>Everyone else fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang waved her hand, recalling the Kirin hairpin. She thrust it suddenly at empty space.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A dark shadow was knocked out of thin air.  Qin Sang then changed her hand seal, and the Kirin hairpin transformed into a Kirin, swallowing the shadow in one gulp before viciously attacking the Cultivators of the Abyss.</p><p>The Abyss cultivators, seeing a Nascent Soul cultivator arrive, were terrified. They hurriedly formed a formation, and their leader activated a blue jade bead, retreating swiftly under the formation's protection.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang pursued them, disappearing into the waves.</p><p>Fat Chicken and the others exchanged glances, silently reforming their formation.  After the near-disaster, they dared not act rashly again.</p><p>A short while later…</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure appeared in a wide-open area, surrounded by swirling gusts of wind that entangled with the lake water. She had abandoned the pursuit at some point, coming here and standing motionless.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang’s face showed vigilance. She pointed a finger, summoning the Kirin hairpin back before her. She looked towards a patch of dark blue lake water on her left, and coldly snorted: “Hiding in plain sight!  Such a rudimentary concealment technique, and you think it can fool me?”</p><p>The water rippled, but there was no one there, not even a shadow.</p><p>After Qin Sang spoke, the water suddenly parted in the middle, and a figure slowly walked out, licking their lips. “Madam Luo remains as vigilant as ever. It seems I need to learn more concealment techniques… It’s been months, Madam, I trust you are well?”</p><p>The newcomer, holding a folding fan, was a cultivator dressed in fine silk robes and leather boots. He was strikingly handsome, but possessed an unnatural pallor that was unsettling. His tone was frivolous, his eyebrows carrying a hint of lechery and eagerness. He walked out nonchalantly, unconcerned about his exposed location.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, her face full of disgust.</p><p>She had heard Madam Luo mention several Abyss Nascent Soul cultivators she had clashed with before, to avoid revealing her identity if they met. This was one she had encountered most frequently.</p><p>This person, calling himself Moon Scatterer, was a demonic cultivator from the Abyss, skilled in a nefarious technique of draining others’ essence.</p><p>The women he drained were not only completely depleted of their spiritual energy but were permanently unable to recover. After draining them, he would transform the most beautiful ones into lifelike puppets, until he found a more perfect one.</p><p>This person was notorious within the Abyss.  If the Abyss hadn't invaded other territories and forced a temporary alliance between righteous and demonic cultivators, he would have likely been dealt with long ago.</p><p>His preferred victims were those with high cultivation bases. After the war started, Moon Scatterer set his sights on the female Nascent Soul cultivators of the allied forces, becoming fixated on Madam Luo and reportedly pursuing Bing Han as well.</p><p>Fortunately, Madam Luo was strong enough to avoid being harmed.  However, over the years, countless female cultivators of the allied forces had been abducted by this person, suffering terrible fates.</p><p>Madam Luo had said that if Moon Scatterer was at Double Mirror Mountain, he would likely seek her out – and she was right.</p><p>Encountering an opponent familiar with Madam Luo carried risks of being discovered, but there were also advantages. Madam Luo knew Moon Scatterer's methods intimately, and Qin Sang quickly formulated a plan.</p><p>Moon Scatterer's abilities were mediocre, but he possessed an extremely powerful treasure: his folding fan, refined day and night with his nefarious technique, imbued with a potent aphrodisiac, making it difficult to guard against. Against female cultivators, its effectiveness was even greater.</p><p>If Fat Chicken hadn't been asleep, would he have been able to withstand the aphrodisiac?</p><p>Qin Sang inexplicably had this thought, and then heard Moon Scatterer’s taunting voice.</p><p>“My heart is filled with joy at the memory of such a beauty!”</p><p>Moon Scatterer lightly shook his fan, leering, “Madam, why not yield to me today, and spend this night together…"</p><p>“You're courting death!”</p><p>The words were cut short by a furious shout.</p><p>A brilliant green light exploded in Moon Scatterer's vision. A hairpin, swift as lightning, shot towards his face, transforming into a fierce Kirin with gaping maw as it approached.</p><p>Without panic, he brought out his folding fan. The treasure soared into the air, the fan facing the Kirin. The fan depicted alluring female figures, and a pink cloud of aphrodisiac erupted from it, forming a naked woman.</p><p>The woman's features were contorted, screaming wildly and fearlessly, blocking the Kirin.</p><p>While activating his folding fan, Moon Scatterer secretly pinched a jade bead in his other hand, multitasking to quietly manipulate the power of the formation.</p><p>Suddenly, a torrent of water fell from the sky above Qin Sang, transforming into a roaring white dragon.  Unexpectedly, Qin Sang remained unmoving, offering no resistance as the water dragon engulfed her, trapping her within the spirit formation.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>Waves crashed, submerging Qin Sang.</p><p>Yue Sanren was stunned by the ease of the attack, sensing something was amiss.  Before he could understand, he saw Madam Luo within the water, suddenly disintegrate.</p><p>Her chest shattered first, revealing a gaping hole—but no blood flowed.  The lower half of her body remained eerily intact, its curves still alluring.</p><p>“What fiend!”</p><p>Yue Sanren’s face paled.  He finally saw Qin Sang’s true form, his expression changing drastically as understanding dawned.  A chill ran down his spine, a terrible premonition seizing him.</p><p>He hadn't anticipated such a despicable tactic!</p><p>Simultaneously, a piercing scream echoed.</p><p>The female demon fighting the Kirin was suddenly marked by a black blotch. Her body froze, revealing a wisp of black flame that instantly consumed her.  The Kirin’s phantom had vanished, revealing a hidden array of demonic banners.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Infernal Fire engulfed the female demon, its flames raging relentlessly towards Yue Sanren.</p><p>The Zu Yuan cultivators were well aware of Qin Sang’s reputation.  Her demonic fire banners, capable of killing even Ye Laomo's blood-demon avatar, were terrifying and something no one wished to face.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The black infernal fire radiated a horrifying aura.</p><p>Terror gripped Yue Sanren.  He finally understood why Ye Laomo's blood demon had resorted to self-destruction!</p><p>Desperately, Yue Sanren forced out a mouthful of refined blood, launching it towards his fan.  The blood solidified into a crimson sigil mid-air, vanishing into the fan.</p><p>The fan trembled, radiating crimson light, as a torrent of intense pink energy erupted, like a cloud of pink mist.  A space seemed to open within the fan, and several naked women from the fan’s surface, propelled by the pink energy, burst into the real world.  But before they could do anything, the infernal fire engulfed them.</p><p>Their potent poison, usually so feared, offered no resistance against the infernal fire, burning away instantly without affecting Qin Sang in the slightest.</p><p>The female demon, having consumed her master's blood essence, shrieked in a frenzy, her grotesque appearance further emphasized by her wild cries.</p>
