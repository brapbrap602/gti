<h1>Chapter 726: A Trial of the Heart</h1><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Ran Luo, however, appeared completely at ease.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel suspicious.  She didn't seem like she was threatening him with this matter.</p><p>Even if it was a threat, Qin Sang wasn't afraid.</p><p>Hiding in the Demon Sea was easy. Most of the inner sea was occupied by humans, and even with the Black Serpent Mountain's strength, they couldn't stir up trouble in human territory.</p><p>As long as he wasn't on the Wu God Continent, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>“No wonder those people were so powerful. They were direct disciples of Nascent Soul Wu Tribe elders. Fortunately, this humble Daoist's escape techniques are passable, and I managed to escape their pursuit. I am eternally grateful to Fellow Daoist Ran and Elder Zou for cleaning up the mess for me.”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and cupped his hands in a respectful gesture.</p><p>Ran Luo smiled faintly. “Daoist, you are too polite.  Those who are not of our kind have different hearts.  Moreover, you are a guest elder of our Chamber of Commerce.  It's only right that we should help.”  She paused. “Have you considered Elder Zou's proposal?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. “I have two requests.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang relent, Ran Luo's face lit up with delight. “Please speak, Daoist.”</p><p>“First, the matter of the spirit herbs cannot wait any longer.  I must go and gather them first. Second, Fellow Daoist Ran, you also know how dangerous the Seven Killing Palace is. I dare not slack off and need to find a place to cultivate diligently, striving to break through to the middle stage of Core Formation before the Seven Killing Palace opens.  This will increase my chances of survival.  Furthermore, my cultivation technique is unique, requiring me to frequently hunt demonic beasts outside the island to comprehend the Dao of Slaughter. Therefore, I will have limited energy to deal with the trivial matters of the Chamber of Commerce…”</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice.</p><p>“As expected, Daoist possesses astonishing talent, confident in breaking through before the Seven Killing Palace opens.”</p><p>Ran Luo couldn't help but sigh with admiration. She had reached the bottleneck ten years ago and still hadn't found a way to break through. Seeing Qin Sang's confident tone, she felt envious.</p><p>“Daoist's cultivation progress is also beneficial to our Chamber of Commerce. Of course, I have no reason to hinder you. In that case, before the Seven Killing Palace opens, you can first take charge of some of the smaller islands along our shipping routes. Our Chamber of Commerce has just started operations in the Inner Sea. The affairs on those small islands are not complex, requiring you to only deal with potential crises.  The day-to-day matters will be handled by others. However, you are also aware of the chaos in the Demon Sea. Those small islands are not like Capital Rock Island, and their safety is difficult to guarantee. Moreover, once you accept, you cannot be too casual about going elsewhere.  You must be readily contactable…”</p><p>As she spoke, Ran Luo took out a sea chart and spread it out in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Several small islands with less important outposts were marked along the shipping routes.</p><p>However, the Chamber of Commerce was short-staffed in the Demon Sea. Except for large islands like Capital Rock Island, one person was responsible for several small islands. Though the affairs weren't complex, it was still quite demanding.</p><p>While Ran Luo pointed at the sea chart, Qin Sang focused on the environment surrounding these small islands. As long as there were suitable hunting grounds for demonic beasts, he could settle anywhere.</p><p>“I'm afraid it will be difficult for me to oversee so many small islands alone.  Could Fellow Daoist Ran assign me some assistants?”</p><p>Ran Luo smiled meaningfully. “If you can persuade other Daoists, I have no objections.”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, lost in thought.</p><p>The two discussed in private for a long time.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang boarded a ship heading towards Sky Witch Island, preparing to depart. The Wang sisters came to see him off.</p><p>They were scheduled to take a ship to Great Wilderness Island the following night, traveling ahead to the location Qin Sang had chosen to make arrangements. Qin Sang would join them after gathering the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet.</p><p>Apart from Ran Luo, Qin Sang only knew the Wang sisters on Capital Rock Island. After receiving Ran Luo’s promise, Qin Sang approached the Wang sisters to discuss the matter.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two sisters, who had originally planned to go out with their companions, readily agreed without hesitation after hearing Qin Sang's proposal, seemingly without even carefully considering the conditions.</p><p>Their relationship with the Chamber of Commerce was based on employment, and the Chamber of Commerce did not have much control over them. Ran Luo had no reason, nor would she, stop them.</p><p>With the two sisters assisting him, things would be much easier.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang wouldn't treat them unfairly. The elder Wang sister had just recently broken through to the Core Formation stage and still needed to help her younger sister gather Demonic Essence Pills. She didn't even have a magical treasure, and her strength among Core Formation cultivators could only be considered among the lowest. Qin Sang lent her the Green Jade Tablet to use, so she would have the strength to stabilize the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the Wang sisters a few instructions and boarded the ship.</p><p>The Wang sisters waved farewell.</p><p>They watched as the ship sailed away.</p><p>The younger sister playfully leaned forward in front of her elder sister and teased, “Congratulations, Sister!  You’ve finally gotten your wish!”</p><p>The elder sister glared at her younger sister and spat, pretending to reach out. “Stop your nonsense, or I'll pull your tongue out.”</p><p>The younger sister wasn’t afraid at all, waving her hands and hopping around.  “Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Still pretending!  Who was it that agreed before the other person even finished speaking, without even asking my opinion, afraid that they would go back on their word… Is your heart already flying away?”</p><p>“We haven't even seen the Daoist's true face.” The elder sister suddenly blurted out.</p><p>The younger sister froze, looking at her sister's expression and not daring to joke anymore.</p><p>The elder sister gave a self-deprecating smile.  “I never thought that, having lived as a hundred-year-old hag, I would suddenly develop girlish feelings, and I don’t even know where they came from.  Perhaps it's because in all those years in the Demon Sea, drifting like rootless duckweed, living day to day, I’ve long had the thought of finding someone to rely on. Then, after encountering the Daoist, these feelings couldn't help but burst forth.  These past few days, I’ve reflected carefully and realized it may not necessarily be love.”</p><p>The younger sister listened silently, leaning in and hugging her arm.</p><p>The elder sister patted her younger sister's shoulder and said softly, “This may not be a bad thing for me.  By understanding this, my state of mind has actually improved significantly.  Just treat it as a trial of the heart.  The Daoist possesses unfathomable strength and is a righteous person, willing to help us sisters.  This is a great fortune for us.  Your Demonic Essence Pills are definitely not a problem. Quickly break through to Core Formation, and we sisters can then walk the immortal path hand in hand, never to be separated.”</p><p>“We will never be separated,” the younger sister murmured.</p><p>……</p><p>On the ship.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the sisters' conversation.</p><p>He held a token in his hand, representing his status as a steward of the瓊宇 (Qiongyu, but let's call it) Azure Sky Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Joining the Azure Sky Chamber of Commerce, he still didn't know whether it was good or bad, but for the sake of qualifying for the Seven Killing Palace, he couldn’t afford to be picky.</p><p>Before departing, Qin Sang had exchanged the demonic cores and other items in his Thousand Jun Ring for spirit stones, barely managing to gather the required amount, which he had given to Ran Luo to secure his spot in the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>As for the East Pole Alliance's mission, he could improvise when the time came.</p><p>If the mission was extremely dangerous, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't sit still and wait for death.</p><p>The ship sailed smoothly on the sea.  With the protection of spirit arrays and many powerful cultivators on board, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the restrictions in his room and then set up several layers of his own prohibitive restrictions. He took out a jade box from his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Opening the jade box, a dazzling blue light immediately filled the entire room.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was bathed in blue.</p>
