<h1>Chapter 281: Matching Pendants</h1><p>After seeing Yu Kong off, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a cushion, lost in thought.</p><p>In Westwaste Town, especially among the cultivators active in the vicinity, almost no one believed in the existence of the herb garden. Or rather, most were skeptical; they wouldn't mind searching for it if they entered the ruins, but they wouldn't consider it their primary objective.</p><p>After all, some vital areas within the Autumn Firmament Market still held treasures, and the window of vulnerability in the protective formation was extremely short.  Once the market sealed itself, dangers abounded, and no one dared to stay inside for thirty years.</p><p>Rather than wasting energy searching for an illusory herb garden, it was better to focus on competing for visible treasures.</p><p>If it weren't for the image displayed by the jade pendant that Wanderer presented, Qin Sang would have also doubted the truth of this matter.</p><p>The image on the jade pendant was shown to Wanderer by Ge Yuan, and Ge Yuan's identity was somewhat special.</p><p>The person who discovered the herb garden was named Shao Chunhui. Ge Yuan could be considered Shao Chunhui's friend. They had collaborated a few times, both being pragmatic individuals. Their interactions were generally harmonious, with no friction arising, fostering a foundation of trust between them.</p><p>――――――</p><p>Yu Kong and the others were unaware of Ge Yuan's existence.</p><p>Before Shao Chunhui's demise, he sought out Ge Yuan and revealed the image of the garden to him, inviting him to join in the search for spirit herbs. However, out of caution, Shao Chunhui only revealed the tip of the iceberg and didn't offer much explanation.</p><p>Based on the trust established through their previous collaborations, Ge Yuan readily agreed.  Unexpectedly, Shao Chunhui disappeared without a trace afterward.</p><p>However, Ge Yuan wasn't the one who initially spread the rumors.</p><p>Ge Yuan had long since forgotten about this matter until two years ago when rumors about the Autumn Firmament Market’s herb garden suddenly surfaced, jogging his memory.</p><p>After conducting a discreet investigation, Ge Yuan suspected that Shao Chunhui's killer was likely one of his companions who entered the market together, ultimately narrowing his suspicions down to Yu Kong and his two associates.</p><p>Only these three attempted to re-enter the market and were actively recruiting others.</p><p>Ge Yuan had neither the ability nor the intention to avenge Shao Chunhui.  Their friendship wasn't deep enough to warrant such a sacrifice.</p><p>Ge Yuan knew that Yu Kong and the other two were all exceptionally powerful. Regardless of which one was the killer, he was no match for them.</p><p>But Ge Yuan was deeply interested in spirit herbs.</p><p>The image Shao Chunhui showed him was too alluring. Whether it was an ancient cultivator's herb garden or the spirit herbs planted by the former owner of the market, they were undoubtedly invaluable. Even obtaining one or two would greatly benefit his cultivation.</p><p>As Ge Yuan was alone and unable to pinpoint the killer, he decided to stir up the situation, adding fuel to the fire by leveraging the spread of rumors.</p><p>Rather than having someone quietly harvest all the herbs, creating chaos might offer an opportunity to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ge Yuan acted carelessly.  His initial actions nearly exposed him. Luckily, at a critical moment, Wanderer happened upon him and saved his life.</p><p>After learning the whole story, Wanderer halted Ge Yuan's crude plan. After all, countless experts were entering the Autumn Firmament Market. If the herb garden were exposed, the spirit herbs wouldn't be enough for everyone.</p><p>Finally, they decided to infiltrate the ranks of the three suspects separately to uncover the location of the secret passage. As long as they could get inside, they were sure to get a share.</p><p>Ge Yuan remained in Westwaste Town to observe the situation, while Wanderer returned to Skull Gorge to bring in Qin Sang.</p><p>……</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang went out again early in the morning and encountered Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong hadn't yet assembled enough people to practice the formation.  Over the past few days, Qin Sang had gone out almost every day, making inquiries in Westwaste Town. Sometimes, he would sit idly in teahouses all day, other times he would shuttle between various shops, using spirit stones to purchase information.</p><p>Yu Kong had become accustomed to this and didn't press Qin Sang for a response to his invitation.</p><p>"Daoist Priest, you're always coming and going in a hurry.  Have you discovered anything?" Yu Kong inquired with feigned curiosity, a confident smile playing on his lips, clearly convinced that Qin Sang's efforts were futile.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a dry laugh and cupped his hands. "Just so-so…"</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Yu Kong chuckled and shook his head dismissively.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his usual routine. Upon passing a dark alleyway, his gaze suddenly sharpened. He inconspicuously entered the alley and slipped into a shop.</p><p>The person inside the shop was Wanderer.</p><p>"Senior, isn't this hasty meeting risky?  Could it expose us?" Qin Sang frowned, his tone laced with不满.</p><p>He had been extremely cautious to gain Yu Kong's trust, and this meeting posed a significant risk.</p><p>Friend Qin, rest assured, I've been right behind you, no one's following," Wanderer led Qin Sang into the back room, whispering, "You haven't met Ge yet... Shengyuanzi has assembled everyone, and Ge is about to leave West Wasteland Town.  Any later and we might miss our chance. I need to give you the Harmony Pendants first."</p><p>Besides Yu Kong, the other two were named Luo Xingnan and Shengyuanzi. Like Yu Kong, both were at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Ge Yuan had been recruited by Shengyuanzi, and Wanderer seemed to have successfully infiltrated Luo Xingnan's team.</p><p>In the back room, Qin Sang met Ge Yuan for the first time.</p><p>He looked about Qin Sang's age, handsome and dignified, with a hint of arrogance between his brows.  Qin Sang keenly noticed a flicker of disdain in Ge Yuan's eyes as he looked him over.</p><p>In the cultivation world, strength reigns supreme.</p><p>Ge Yuan's cultivation was even higher than Wanderer's, comparable to Yu Daiyue, and not far from breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment. If Wanderer hadn't saved his life, he might not even respect him.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly. "Greetings, Fellow Cultivator Ge."</p><p>"No need for formalities, Daoist."</p><p>Ge Yuan nodded casually, scrutinizing Qin Sang, and warned bluntly, "Your cultivation level seems rather low. However, Senior Wanderer speaks very highly of you.  Surely you won't disappoint him?"</p><p>As long as the plan succeeded, Qin Sang didn't mind being looked down upon. He replied calmly, "Rest assured, Fellow Cultivator Ge. I will follow Senior Wanderer's instructions.  If I discover anything, I'll immediately inform you two. I won't act rashly."</p><p>Ge Yuan finally turned his attention away from Qin Sang and looked at Wanderer. "Senior, time is of the essence. Let's distribute the Harmony Pendants."</p><p>Wanderer nodded and took out three identical ivory round pendants.</p><p>"These three Harmony Pendants were refined from the tusk of a single Celestial Net White Elephant.  It took me a great deal of effort to acquire them.</p><p>Legend says the Celestial Net White Elephant carries the bloodline of the divine beast, Titi. These pendants have the ability to transmit messages. Though their range isn't vast, it's sufficient within Autumn Goose Marketplace.</p><p>The three of us will drip our blood onto the pendants. If anything is discovered, immediately crush your pendant, and the others will be notified.</p><p>The pendants possess a unique property, emitting no spiritual energy fluctuations. They're undetectable.</p><p>However, be warned, once crushed, they cannot be restored. There's only one chance, so make sure the information is accurate, or we'll have wasted our efforts."</p>
