<h1>Chapter 773: Revenge is a dish best served cold.</h1><p>Chapter 773: Revenge is a dish best served cold.</p><p>Qin Sang sent the Flying Night Rakshasa to scout, anticipating various scenarios.</p><p>If a powerful ghost king was present, and he was outmatched, he would abandon the Rakshasa and flee.</p><p>If the opponent was weaker, his speed would allow for swift reinforcement.</p><p>But he never expected this.</p><p>Flying Night Rakshasas, these Foundation Establishment-level corpses, are rare treasures. Even skilled necromancers would expend countless efforts to cultivate one.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to further refine his necromantic techniques and enhance the Rakshasa's power, but this unexpected incident occurred.</p><p>The Rakshasa was severely injured, its wounds unhealed, and its power diminished.</p><p>If the opponent were powerful, the Rakshasa wouldn't have even had a chance to fight back; it would likely have been subdued upon entering the ghostlands.</p><p>The opponent's actions suggest it wasn't particularly strong, but perhaps it had a specific counter to corpses.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang wasn't afraid and dared to continue the pursuit.</p><p>He suspected the opponent had taken the Rakshasa, painstakingly concealing its soul mark, rather than destroying it, possibly because it coveted the body.</p><p>The opponent was most likely a lone, wandering ghost.</p><p>"If my own cultivation was low, they would have taken my body," he thought, his anger escalating.</p><p>Soon, he stopped where the soul mark connection broke, looking around but finding nothing.  The opponent was cunning, leaving no trace.</p><p>Qin Sang chose a direction and continued flying, eventually reaching a cliff face, completely losing the opponent's trail.</p><p>The opponent was not only extremely cautious but also adept at concealment; Qin Sang discovered nothing.</p><p>He hadn't even seen the opponent's face, yet his powerful subordinate had been taken.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang resolutely began searching the ghostlands.</p><p>For a time, dazzling遁光 crisscrossed the ghost mist as he searched frantically, almost turning the place upside down, meticulously examining even the cliff edges.</p><p>After spending a considerable amount of time, he found nothing.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa had seemingly vanished into thin air. No matter how Qin Sang activated the soul mark, it was like a stone dropped into the ocean, eliciting no response.</p><p>"I can't continue wasting time here..."</p><p>Standing at the exit of the ghostlands, Qin Sang stared at the heavy ghost mist, somewhat helpless.</p><p>He hadn't obtained the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, and he had already lost a key subordinate.</p><p>His search in the ghost mist had cost him too much time; he had to leave and go to the Heavenly Pagoda.</p><p>"If only my Sky-Eyed Butterfly had undergone its third transformation. Under its gaze, those ghosts and demons would have nowhere to hide...  If you've got the guts, go through the Nine Nether Infernal Fire and escape. Otherwise, when I return, I will find you!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted, only able to console himself with, "Revenge is a dish best served cold."</p><p>Shrouded in the dense ghost mist, he felt powerless.</p><p>He possessed a Corpse Pill but wasn't a true necromancer.  His spiritual senses were severely limited within the ghost mist.</p><p>His opponent, however, could move freely. With its uncanny escape techniques, Qin Sang likely wouldn't even notice it following him.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's mutation had caused it to fall into a deep sleep, delaying its transformation and preventing its third metamorphosis. Otherwise, Qin Sang could have easily seen through the deception.</p><p>A violent disturbance erupted in the ghost mist, and a large group of vengeful spirits surged out, a vast, dark mass.</p><p>These were the spirits he had disturbed during his search.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>Qin Sang, expressionless, gave a cold shout.</p><p>A violent wind arose, his true energy surging, forming a rainbow light that swept the vengeful spirits back.</p><p>Qin Sang took one last look at the ghostlands, erased his tracks, restrained his true energy, donned a fire shield, and flashed to the Infernal Fire.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the vengeful spirits, having lost their target, gradually calmed down. The ghostlands returned to silence; the ghost mist, its ripples subsiding, flowed gently, appearing unchanged.</p><p>He passed through the Infernal Fire and returned to the canyon exit.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, stood for a moment, summoned the fat silkworm, and quietly left.</p><p>Leaving the canyon, instead of returning the way he came, Qin Sang secretly approached the Purple Crystal Lake, hoping to steal another crystal to provide more food for the silkworm.</p><p>However, before he neared the lake, Qin Sang sensed a powerful aura lingering nearby, causing his hair to stand on end.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang dared not approach any closer, carefully retreating.</p><p>"The beast leader has been alerted and come to guard it personally.  The entire pack must have moved; the number of beasts around the lake is more than ten times greater than before."</p><p>It seems we can't get the purple crystal this time.  We only have these two.  Save them, okay?”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fei Can, who mirrored his frustrated expression.</p><p>With no other option, Qin Sang retreated. He returned to the cliff base, located his landing spot, and climbed back up the same way.</p><p>On his return, he passed the site where the ancient divine altar had appeared; the ground was smooth, all traces gone.</p><p>The melee at the first stone hall hadn't subsided, so Qin Sang chose to detour, easily traversing the Purple Star Carved Canyon before finally leaving the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground.</p><p>Free from the poisonous mist, Fei Can retracted its anti-toxin armor, scurried into its insect basket, and immediately fell into a deep sleep clutching the demon core.  The journey had nearly depleted it.</p><p>Without the poisonous mist, the view opened up, easing Qin Sang's tension.  However, this didn't mean the outside was safer than the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground.  Out there, he had to avoid not only various ferocious beasts but also other cultivators.</p><p>“The Sky Tower is to the north. The forest is fraught with danger. It's better to return the way we came and then cross the wasteland to reach the Sky Tower.”</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, determined his direction, and ventured into the forest with his two-headed… creature, disappearing amongst the ancient trees.</p><p>…</p><p>In the canyon.</p><p>Magic fire hung in the air, seemingly eternal.</p><p>Some time after Qin Sang’s departure.</p><p>A ripple disturbed the poisonous mist, and then a figure emerged, slowly approaching.</p><p>He showed no visible protective barrier yet moved freely within the poisonous mist. The mist, touching his black robe, was repelled effortlessly, unable to penetrate.</p><p>This was the heart of the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground, where the mist was incredibly potent.  His ease of movement suggested either an exceptional anti-toxin treasure or incredibly high cultivation.</p><p>The person emerged fully from the mist, revealing his face.</p><p>He appeared to be around forty, tall and imposing, but his deep, intimidating eyes belied his outward appearance and suggested a far greater age.</p><p>Upon seeing the Netherworld Magic Fire, his gaze became intensely fervent and captivated.</p><p>“This time, I refuse to believe I can't subdue you…”</p><p>He muttered to himself, but mid-sentence his expression changed drastically. He flickered, disappearing instantly.</p><p>Reappearing, his gaze swept the canyon, finally fixing on the gap between the magic fire and the cliff face.  A moment later, his face was etched with utter shock.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>He exclaimed inwardly, disbelief etched onto his features.  “Even I couldn’t withstand the erosion… how could anyone traverse the canyon!  No, he not only entered, but he emerged alive…”</p>
