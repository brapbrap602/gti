Chapter 390: The Cost


Thunder roared, and lightning flashed brilliantly.
Above the dark pool, Yu Hua hovered in the air, besieged by a swarm of winged fish-dragons.
Clearly, he lacked the Drunken Demon Saliva refined by Yun Youzi, and his arrival had disturbed these ancient beasts.
Beneath Yu Hua, a large, semi-circular pale blue protective barrier shimmered, fending off the winged fish-dragons' attacks.
Enraged, the winged fish-dragons let out sharp cries, continuously unleashing lightning from their horns, assaulting the barrier.  The surface of the barrier had accumulated a layer of lightning, resembling a pool of thunder, appearing extremely precarious.


Even with Yu Hua's cultivation, he was entangled by the winged fish-dragons, temporarily unable to break free.
The power of the winged fish-dragons' abilities was truly terrifying.
Thankfully, he had the Drunken Demon Saliva; otherwise, if he and Yun Youzi had disturbed the winged fish-dragons, their chances of survival would have been slim.


“Zhao Yan fell at your hands?”
Recognizing Qin Sang, Yu Hua instantly understood something, piecing together many things, his eyes flickering darkly. He said coldly, “That good-for-nothing!  Controlling the Heart-Eating Insects, yet still killed by you. Truly unexpected. No wonder I've never found him all these years.”


“Wait!”
“So…the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid is in your possession!”
A look of ecstatic joy suddenly appeared on Yu Hua's face.
He knew of the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid!


Qin Sang's heart tightened, killing intent flashing in his eyes.  He stared coldly at Yu Hua, remaining silent, suddenly waving his hand to unleash a golden light.


The Soul Binding Rope, like a dragon emerging from water, instantly darted towards Yu Hua, about to bind him.
At this moment, Qin Sang was effectively teaming up with the winged fish-dragons. Even if Yu Hua was at the False Core Stage, he might not necessarily be able to defeat him.  This was a rare opportunity, and Qin Sang naturally wouldn't miss it.


Unexpectedly, Yu Hua didn't dodge but instead sneered.
‘Crack!’
The protective barrier trembled, the thunderous liquid vibrating, creating waves. A surge of lightning was actually repelled by the barrier, transforming into several incredibly violent bolts of lightning, incredibly swift and strikingly accurate, striking the Soul Binding Rope.


Qin Sang was caught off guard, unable to retract the Soul Binding Rope in time.
With a ‘boom’, the Soul Binding Rope was engulfed by lightning, its light directly dissipated by the powerful lightning, its body dimming, falling to the ground, covered in cracks, clearly unusable.


Qin Sang's face turned pale. Fortunately, he reacted quickly, withdrawing his spiritual sense from the Soul Binding Rope in time, avoiding being affected.
But a top-grade high-quality magical artifact was destroyed so easily, especially such a useful binding artifact, causing Qin Sang considerable pain.


It turned out that the lightning that had just attacked him came from this.  Although Yu Hua hadn't escaped, he was able to use the situation to his advantage, cleverly manipulating the thunderous liquid to counterattack.


Trying to ambush Yu Hua at this moment would be difficult.
No wonder Yu Hua was so confident.


However, Qin Sang hadn't expected the Soul Binding Rope to truly bind Yu Hua.
The moment the Soul Binding Rope was destroyed by lightning, not far from Yu Hua, a phantom sword image slowly emerged.


The moment Yu Hua was forced out of hiding, Qin Sang had already secretly deployed the Ebony Sword, laying a trap, silently moving it into position.
Due to the vast difference in strength between the two, even with Qin Sang's 'Human-Sword Unity, Formless Stealth' abilities, he was afraid of being discovered and only dared to carefully approach with the Ebony Sword.


The Soul Binding Rope was merely a diversion, attracting Yu Hua's attention and concealing the Ebony Sword, although the cost was high—the Soul Binding Rope was completely destroyed.
Fortunately, the Ebony Sword successfully infiltrated Yu Hua's vicinity.


‘Whoosh!’
The moment Yu Hua vibrated the protective barrier, the Ebony Sword seized the opportunity to approach Yu Hua.  Getting closer would easily be noticed and would lose the element of surprise, so Qin Sang chose this moment to unleash the spiritual sword with full power.


The sword energy burst forth, stabbing towards Yu Hua!
By the time Yu Hua discovered the Ebony Sword, it was too late to avoid it. Sensing the exceptionally sharp aura of the Ebony Sword, he immediately realized this was no ordinary spiritual sword.


The sneer on his face vanished, and he coldly glanced at Qin Sang, suddenly striking out two black orbs.


Dark Yin Thunder!
Qin Sang recognized it immediately.


Although the Dark Yin Thunder was powerful, the Ebony Sword was no longer an ordinary weapon. While it might be damaged by the Dark Yin Thunder, it wouldn't be severe, at most requiring a longer refinement period.
Compared to killing Yu Hua, this cost was insignificant.


Thinking this, Qin Sang hardened his resolve. The Ebony Sword not only didn't dodge, but instead increased its speed by a third.


Unexpectedly, Yu Hua didn't aim the Dark Yin Thunder directly at the Ebony Sword, but towards the protective barrier.


Just as Qin Sang was puzzled, there was a deafening ‘boom’ as the Dark Yin Thunder exploded before the barrier.


At that moment, the protective barrier was locked in a stalemate with the thunderous energy.  Suddenly, the Xuan Yin Thunder exploded, shattering the balance.

The instant the barrier broke, Yu Hua roared, his hand seals shifting dramatically.  The barrier fragments instantly transformed into a swirling vortex, drawing in some of the thunderous energy and hurtling it towards the Wumu Sword.

This wasn't just ordinary Xuan Yin Thunder; the vortex was a terrifying amalgamation of Xuan Yin Thunder, a swarm of Flying Horned Dragonfish, and the power of a False Core Realm expert.

If the Wumu Sword continued its pursuit of Yu Hua, it would be struck directly by this furious energy.

Qin Sang's face fell.  The Wumu Sword was his life-bound spirit sword, intrinsically linked to his killing talismans and cultivation techniques; it absolutely could not be destroyed.

Abandoning the pursuit of Yu Hua, Qin Sang urgently recalled his Wumu Sword.  Unexpectedly, Yu Hua, relentless in his pursuit, forcefully redirected the vortex, continuing his attack on the returning sword.

Although the Wumu Sword was fast, the vortex was faster.  Seeing his spirit sword about to be consumed, Qin Sang's eyes widened, and with a roar, he unleashed a black stone with a powerful palm strike.

The Black Dragon Stone rapidly expanded, narrowly intercepting the Wumu Sword just before the vortex struck, miraculously blocking the blast.

All that remained was blinding white light.

Qin Sang felt a sharp pain in his chest, a powerful impact slamming into him.  He grunted, crashing heavily into the ice wall behind him, the pain excruciating.

When the light subsided, the passage, including the Black Dragon Stone, had vanished completely, replaced by a gaping chasm.

‘Whoosh… whoosh…’

Water surged in, expanding the pool’s size tenfold.

Clutching his chest, Qin Sang's face was pale. Fortunately, the Black Dragon Stone had detonated the vortex, and he had only suffered the aftershock.  The consequences could have been far worse.

However, the cost was immense.  He had lost the Spirit Binding Rope and the Black Dragon Stone, two top-grade artifacts, and all he gained were two of Yu Hua’s Xuan Yin Thunder, failing even to injure him.

Conversely, Yu Hua had decisively detonated two precious Xuan Yin Thunder to escape the crisis.

By any measure, Qin Sang was at a loss.

This… this was the power of a False Core Realm expert?

Qin Sang was shocked.  His gaze sharpened, noticing a grey shadow flash into view, charging directly at him.

The Flying Horned Dragonfish in the pool were also reeling from the blast.

Qin Sang quickly swept his hand across his spatial pouch, planting a large banner in the ground.

Endless yellow sand instantly filled the ice cave.
