<h1>Chapter 346: Bottomless Valley</h1><p>“This person is very strange. He stays in a dark and gloomy place within Bottomless Valley, wandering like a lost soul.  It's unknown how long he's been there. He has a human form and seems to retain some consciousness. His power is considerable. What's even stranger is that this person is proficient in遁术, appearing and disappearing at will, and can use incantations, but he doesn't seem alive…”</p><p>Yun Youzi carefully recounted what he knew about the strange person, his tone filled with uncertainty. “I initially thought this person might have provoked some strange restriction in Bottomless Valley and become trapped. But then I discovered that the fluctuations in Tan Jie's aura are somewhat similar to this strange person's…”</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt that the person Yun Youzi described resembled a living corpse.</p><p>Moreover, judging by Yun Youzi's description, this living corpse was very powerful. Even if it wasn't a Sky Demon, it must have been refined from a Core Formation realm cultivator.</p><p>Could it be that a Heavenly Corpse Sect expert met with an accident, and his living corpse became trapped in Bottomless Valley?</p><p>Bottomless Valley is located deep within the Broken Sky Mountains, surrounded by demonic sects. Legend has it that the valley is like a hellish underworld, filled with danger, but also containing incredible opportunities.</p><p>It wasn't unusual for Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivators to appear in Bottomless Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then cautiously said, “If this strange person is related to this peculiar technique, I do possess some methods that could influence him. However, this influence is limited. I cannot completely control him.”</p><p>Back in the Heavenly Corpse Cave, he couldn't even control a Foundation Establishment stage living corpse.</p><p>This is because each Heavenly Corpse Talisman is meticulously refined by the corpse refiner. During the refining process, the refiner's spiritual imprint is infused into the talisman. Although the person is dead, the spiritual imprint remains.</p><p>Unless the original refiner willingly relinquishes control, it's almost impossible for an outsider to take over.</p><p>The owner of that living corpse was definitely dead. Faced with an unclaimed Heavenly Corpse Talisman, although Qin Sang couldn't control it, he could use the secret techniques of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* to restrict the living corpse's actions.</p><p>However, if the living corpse was too powerful, Qin Sang couldn't be certain how effective these restrictions would be.</p><p>If it truly was a Sky Demon, Qin Sang felt it best to avoid provoking it.</p><p>Yun Youzi frowned silently, contemplating for a long time before speaking to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Brother Qin, I know of a few other places, some of which are almost as dangerous as Bottomless Valley, and even if I were to enter them, I might not be able to cure my hidden injuries.</p><p>“At least I have reliable information that there is indeed a spiritual herb within Bottomless Valley that would be beneficial to me.</p><p>“Although Bottomless Valley is fraught with peril, I know a route that allows safe entry. I've traveled it before, and it won't be too dangerous.</p><p>“Once we reach the location, I only need Brother Qin's help to see if you can restrict that strange person. There’s no need to kill him, just buy me a little time, and that will be enough.</p><p>“If it doesn't work, I won't force the issue. We'll immediately retreat.</p><p>“If we manage to get in, I'll handle the rest of the journey myself. Brother Qin needn't continue to risk your life; you don't have to wait for me. You can quietly leave Bottomless Valley.</p><p>“Regardless of success or failure, I will be indebted to you, Brother. After returning to my sect, even if it costs me my reputation, I will ask my martial uncles for a Harmony Pill for you.”</p><p>Since Yun Youzi had already said so much, Qin Sang couldn't refuse. He shook his head and said, “What are you talking about, Senior? Since you are determined, I will naturally accompany you.”</p><p>Bottomless Valley was in the Broken Sky Mountains, and he was planning to return to Mount Shaohua to retrieve the Earthly Yin Qi. On his way back, it wouldn't take much extra time to make a detour to Bottomless Valley.</p><p>Moreover, Yun Youzi had made it clear that it wasn't too dangerous, and he could leave at any time.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang was also quite interested in the living corpse.</p><p>If the living corpse's owner had died nearby, perhaps his remains were still there, and he might find clues to the second half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*. Even without Yun Youzi's promise, it was worth the trip.</p><p>“When do you plan to depart, Senior?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang agree, Yun Youzi was quite pleased. He pondered for a moment and said, “Within Bottomless Valley, apart from that strange person, there are many other bizarre entities and restrictions. I need to prepare a few things to increase our chances of success. It's unlikely I'll be ready in the short term. How about this, I will return to my sect now to prepare. Let us agree to meet at the entrance of Bottomless Valley in one year.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “So soon? Aren't you going to wait for the Violet Viburnum auction?”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. “I can't afford the Violet Viburnum. I only planned to attend for the excitement. Naturally, healing my injuries is more important. After entering the Broken Sky Mountains, Brother Qin, remember to be cautious. It's best to disguise yourself as a demonic cultivator and avoid revealing your identity as a Mount Shaohua disciple.”</p><p>Qin Sang was quite confident about this and wasn't worried at all.</p><p>As long as he revealed his corpse refining skills, he wouldn't need any disguise. He would appear even more like a demonic cultivator than the real ones.</p><p>The two discussed further, finalizing their plan. Yun Youzi left Yin Mountain Pass that night to return to his sect and make preparations.</p><p>#Send 888 Cash Red Envelope# Follow vx.

In such a short time, there wasn't enough time to return to Hanging Skull Pass. Fortunately, nothing was amiss at Hanging Skull Pass, so it didn't matter if he didn't return.</p><p>While he had used the ancient teleportation formation of the Shangyuan Serenity Palace to arrive, he would have to travel back the conventional way.</p><p>After rescuing Shi Hong, he would head directly south back to Mount Shaohua. Once he finished refining the living corpses, he would set off for Bottomless Valley, traversing almost the entire Small Cold Region.  The timing would be just about right.</p><p>He was grateful for the newly acquired Nether Cloud artifact; otherwise, the timeframe would have been quite tight.</p><p>…</p><p>Windswept Market.</p><p>There were three safe routes from Yin Mountain Pass to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Each route had a town or market situated at roughly the same distance from Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>Windswept Market was one of them.</p><p>Although called a market, its prosperity rivaled that of some towns.</p><p>Similar to West Wasteland Town, it wasn't built within a secret realm but was exposed to the outside. Only when the celestial phenomenon arrived would the protective formation be activated.</p><p>However, the terrain of Windswept Market was completely different from West Wasteland Town.</p><p>Windswept Market was built on a mountain that rose from a swamp. It wasn't particularly tall, a consequence of the unusual terrain of Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>The protective formation could encompass the entire mountain. From the foot to the summit, rows of houses were built, densely packed with almost no gaps.</p><p>Many cultivators frequented Windswept Market, and numerous figures could be seen on the streets.</p><p>On the back of the mountain, rows of small courtyards appeared rather crowded.</p><p>There were no lush bamboo groves, no flowing springs, and no scenic beauty whatsoever. Its only merit was tranquility.</p><p>Unbeknownst to many, these small courtyards and their surroundings were considered prime real estate in Windswept Market.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was very rich, suitable for Foundation Establishment cultivators to use as cultivation caves.  The courtyards appeared unassuming, but they concealed powerful restrictions, allowing cultivators to cultivate within, safe and undisturbed.</p><p>Of course, ordinary cultivators couldn't afford to live in such a place.</p><p>In one of these small courtyards, there were only three wooden huts, appearing very simple.</p><p>Silence reigned within the main hall.</p><p>A young man sat cross-legged on a wooden bed, immersed in cultivation.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize him at a glance. It was Liang Yan!</p>
