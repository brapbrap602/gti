<h1>Chapter 1946: Transformation</h1><p>“I won't go back!”</p><p>“Help! Murder! Bird murder!”</p><p>A heart-wrenching shriek shattered the tranquility above Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had cast a soundproofing spell; otherwise, the patients inside would have been startled.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar sat in the main hall, attending to patients.</p><p>His true body stood high in the sky, watching the Vermillion Bird below flapping its wings frantically, shrieking as if its life were on the line, desperately trying to escape the temple.</p><p>Just a moment ago, Qin Sang had simply mentioned taking it back to his mountain, and the Vermillion Bird had reacted like this.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird couldn't help its agitation.</p><p>Even if it stayed at Qingyang Temple, it would still be restricted by Qin Sang. While it was a bit boring, it could see different people every day and watch Qin Sang treat patients in the main hall, listening to their stories.</p><p>More importantly, the future held great promise.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird had been planning to endure a little longer, until Yu Lang grew up and his cultivation base improved enough to descend the mountain for worldly experience.</p><p>Once Qin Sang was preoccupied with restoring the Thunder Altar, it could use the excuse of escorting Yu Lang to descend the mountain openly and legitimately.</p><p>It would be like a dragon returning to the sea, a tiger returning to the mountains!</p><p>Just as it felt the future was bright, Qin Sang unexpectedly wanted to take it back.</p><p>“Your broken Daoist field has nothing! It's all fire, utterly boring! Is that a place for a bird to stay?!”</p><p>Bubbles of Qi formed in the void, imprisoning the Vermillion Bird. No matter how it struggled, it couldn't break free.</p><p>The bubble carrying the Vermillion Bird floated towards Qin Sang, accompanied by the bird's desperate wails.</p><p>“Have you forgotten you're a Vermillion Bird?”</p><p>Qin Sang was almost exasperated.</p><p>He wasn't taking the Vermillion Bird back to his Daoist field to restrict it.</p><p>Rather, while comprehending the sword formation, Qin Sang had gained some insights, and the Vermillion Bird might be able to assist him.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to emulate the Seven Constellations Sword Formation and create his own Four Symbols Sword Formation.</p><p>The Seven Constellations Sword Formation corresponded to the seven constellations of the White Tiger of the West, ultimately condensing the White Tiger's baleful aura.</p><p>Using this as a reference, the other three sword formations would condense the baleful auras of the Vermillion Bird, Azure Dragon, and Black Tortoise, respectively, until the baleful auras of the Four Saints appeared together, completing the sword formation!</p><p>The celestial stars, the Three Enclosures, the Four Symbols, and the Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>The Four Symbols were named after four sacred beasts, concealing profound mysteries.</p><p>Recently, Qin Sang had been observing the stars at night, feeling the starlight, and experiencing the power of the stars.</p><p>Somehow, it seemed as if it should be this way, that the four symbolic star regions should be named after the White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, Azure Dragon, and Black Tortoise.</p><p>Although cultivating the "Celestial Demon Body Tempering," he also needed to draw upon the power of the stars for body refinement, but previously, limited by his realm and perspective, he hadn't had this feeling.</p><p>It was an indescribable feeling, without any reason. Qin Sang simply had this feeling, as if sacred beasts would leap out from the starlight when his mind sank into the void, startling him awake.</p><p>He didn't know if it was due to preconceived notions, like daytime thoughts manifesting in nighttime dreams, creating a psychological suggestion.</p><p>This was the difficulty of seeking the Dao!</p><p>The Great Dao was ethereal and illusory. On the path of seeking the Dao, one faced countless trials, detours, temptations, illusions, as well as self-generated hallucinations and mental barriers.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but reflect on himself. His true body cultivated, his avatar experienced the world, and though he had gained quite a bit, his understanding of the Dao hadn't progressed significantly, remaining like viewing flowers in fog or the moon in water.</p><p>Regardless of right or wrong, Qin Sang had indeed grasped something, and it happened to align with the true meaning of the Seven Constellations Sword Formation.</p><p>He had a real Vermillion Bird by his side!</p><p>Perhaps, as he corresponded with the stars and created the Southern Vermillion Bird Sword Formation, the Vermillion Bird could offer assistance.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Sang collected the noisy Vermillion Bird and his figure gradually faded away.</p><p>……</p><p>The evening of the second day after Qin Sang's true body left.</p><p>A white cloud drifted slowly from the direction of Jinyi County.</p><p>Several people stood atop the cloud.</p><p>Two of them were the Yin family's young mistress and Lin Baoshan.</p><p>At this moment, the young mistress had a rosy complexion, bright eyes, and a radiant spirit.</p><p>This was a sign of advanced cultivation that hadn't yet stabilized.</p><p>Even the Kingfisher on her shoulder seemed more spirited than before, its gaze full of intelligence.</p><p>The young mistress stood behind a middle-aged man dressed in brocade robes with an extraordinary demeanor. This man was the current head of the Yin family, Yin Heqian.</p><p>“Patriarch, Qingyang Temple is just up ahead.”</p><p>One of the people behind him pointed forward, reminding him.</p><p>Yin Heqian hummed in acknowledgment. "Let's descend."</p><p>The cloud dispersed, and they landed on the roadside outside Qipai Village.</p><p>“Who could imagine that two exalted individuals, one telling stories in a teahouse, the other treating mortals in an old temple.  I've only read about powerful beings experiencing mortal life in books before, but I never expected to see it with my own eyes,” a Yin family disciple said, craning his neck to look ahead.</p><p>“Indeed! Those ghosts and spirits stammered, but we easily learned from the mortals…”</p><p>As they spoke, everyone looked towards the bamboo grove by the roadside.</p><p>Sounds of footsteps and laughter emanated from the grove. As evening approached, the students were returning home.</p><p>“It's that young Daoist priest!”</p><p>Lin Baoshan whispered, looking at Yu Lang emerging from the bamboo grove.</p><p>“He's clearly a cultivator, yet he studies in a mortal school,” a Yin family disciple said, puzzled.</p><p>Yin Heqian snorted. “I've long told you all to read more! Though mortals lack the power to move mountains and fill seas, they also have sages with vast minds, exploring the limits of heaven and earth, who can serve as teachers for generations to come.  We study their classics, comprehend their thoughts, and it greatly benefits our cultivation!”</p><p>While admonishing the disciples, Yin Heqian maintained a calm expression and walked towards Yu Lang.</p><p>Yu Lang, alerted by Xiao Wu, knew in advance that a group of cultivators had arrived outside the bamboo grove. He looked over as soon as he stepped out.</p><p>“Are you Young Daoist Yu Lang? I am Yin Heqian, head of the Yin family.  I've come with my unworthy daughter to visit your master.  We apologize for this unannounced visit, but would it be convenient?” Yin Heqian asked affably.</p><p>“Oh! It's you!”</p><p>Yu Lang recognized the girl and scratched his head. “Master never said cultivators weren't allowed up the mountain.”</p><p>The group ascended the mountain together. Arriving at the gate, Yin Heqian instructed the others to wait, taking only his daughter and Lin Baoshan into the temple.</p><p>There were still a few patients inside. Yu Lang and Xiao Wu went to help.</p><p>Yin Heqian didn't directly enter the main hall. Instead, he honestly lined up at the end, glanced at Qin Sang, and calmly surveyed the temple.</p><p>The young mistress pouted but didn't dare express any dissatisfaction, obediently following her father.</p><p>By the time all the patients were seen, it was nearly the hour of Xu (7-9 pm).</p><p>The three walked to Qin Sang. Yin Heqian bowed slightly. “Yin Heqian greets Daoist Priest.”</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head. "Are you here to see a doctor?"</p><p>Yin Heqian was taken aback, then quickly said:  "Daoist Priest misunderstands! We’ve come to express our gratitude.  You saved Qiao’er and bestowed upon her a great opportunity.  Qiao’er!"</p><p>“Qiao’er greets Senior!  I will forever remember Senior’s kindness.”</p><p>Yin Qiao’er bowed deeply, performing a respectful curtsy.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, packing his medicine box as he spoke.  "I've already said, you were implicated because of me, a true case of unwarranted disaster. I stepped in because it was the right thing to do. Moreover, it was Fellow Daoist Qingyuan who granted you the opportunity. What kindness is there to speak of between us?  It's getting late. If you're not here to see a doctor, please leave."</p><p>Yin Qiao’er was at a loss. Her usual wit and cleverness seemed useless in front of this Daoist priest.</p><p>Fortunately, Yin Heqian remained composed.</p><p>“We’ve been presumptuous, disturbing your cultivation.  We’ll take our leave.  The Yin family resides in the south of Yan Kingdom, near the border of Nanshu Province, in Yinping Mountain.  Should Daoist Priest ever require anything, please let us know, and I will do my utmost to assist you.”</p><p>Yin Heqian decisively took his leave.</p><p>Seeing them come out of the main hall so quickly, the Yin family disciples were surprised.</p><p>“Patriarch?”</p><p>“We’ll talk later!”</p><p>Yin Heqian whispered.  Reaching the foot of the mountain, they rose into the air on a cloud, flying away.</p><p>As they neared the Yin family estate, someone couldn't resist asking, “Patriarch, did you discern that Temple Master’s cultivation level?”</p><p>Yin Heqian furrowed his brow, pondering for a long time.  "His aura is elusive, difficult to probe with secret techniques. However, he’s at least late Nascent Soul. Qingfeng, Qingyuan…  I've never heard of such figures…"</p><p>After a pause, Yin Heqian instructed someone beside him.  “Send a message to Fellow Daoist Qi, have him try to find out if they’re from Yundu Mountain. However, they’re likely using aliases. Tell Fellow Daoist Qi that it doesn’t matter if he can’t find anything, and he mustn't leave any trace.  Even if he discovers something, he shouldn’t act rashly. Treat them with a normal attitude.”</p><p>“Understood,” the person replied, comprehending the implied meaning.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Yin Heqian nodded.</p><p>“Father, why don't you send me to study too? I've never been to school,” Yin Qiao’er said eagerly.</p><p>Yin Heqian glanced at his daughter. "It’s good that you have this thought, but your intentions are too obvious.  Such overtness will be counterproductive. Moreover, their origins are unclear, and who knows what karmic entanglements they carry.  It’s best to maintain a detached yet cordial attitude for now. There will be opportunities in the future.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>……</p><p>Winter passed, and spring arrived.</p><p>Before they knew it, the scorching summer season had begun.</p><p>It had been half a year since their encounter with Qingyuan.</p><p>During this time, the Yin family hadn't returned, and the ghosts and spirits of Jinyi County were cautious, trying their best to avoid disturbing Qin Sang.</p><p>Little had changed at Qingyang Temple. Patients continued to arrive daily, drawn by Qin Sang's reputation.</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu attended school during the day.</p><p>In the evening, they closed the temple gates, and the master and disciples cultivated individually.</p><p>On this day,</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu asked the teacher for leave.</p><p>The patients who came for treatment found that Daoist Priest Qingfeng wasn't at the temple, only his two disciples were attending to them.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang was in the underground chamber.</p><p>Before him, a talisman hovered, radiating arcs of lightning – it was Taiyi's true form.</p><p>Over the past year, Qin Sang's comprehension of the main altar had yielded significant gains, his progress nothing short of meteoric.</p><p>This, in turn, had accelerated the process of Taiyi's enhancement and transformation, far exceeding expectations.</p><p>Feeling the time was ripe, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, deciding to begin working on Taiyi's true form today!</p><p>"Taiyi!"</p><p>Qin Sang called out in a low voice.</p><p>The talisman flickered with lightning – Taiyi's response, indicating he was ready.</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang flew down to the main altar and sat cross-legged.</p><p>What followed were actions and procedures similar to those Qin Sang had used when crafting the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman.</p><p>However, there were subtle yet profound differences.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>……</p><p>Thunder rumbled within the underground chamber.</p><p>The thunder carried a sense of resolve, like Taiyi's roar.</p><p>Taiyi placed complete trust in Qin Sang, fully opening his mind and true form, obeying every command.</p><p>Qin Sang encountered no obstacles, everything proceeding smoothly, yet he remained cautious.</p><p>An entire day passed, and less than ten percent of the work was complete.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang saw the patients off, closed the temple gates, finished their homework, and then cultivated, just as they did when Qin Sang was present.</p><p>This continued until the ninth day.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly emerged from the underground chamber, informed his disciples, left Qingyang Temple, and flew swiftly for a while, arriving at a deserted wilderness.</p><p>While flying, he kept the talisman clutched in his hand.</p><p>Reaching the wilderness, Qin Sang set up formation flags, isolating the area from the outside world.  He gently tossed the talisman into the air, then with lightning speed, extended a finger and pressed it firmly onto a specific inscription point on the talisman.</p><p>Suddenly, the talisman erupted with countless bolts of lightning, striking out in all directions.</p><p>This was the final stroke, the one Qin Sang had contemplated the longest.  Finally, at this moment, it was executed!</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang watched the center of the lightning.  After a moment, a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>Success!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>……</p><p>Thunder roared and lightning flashed.</p><p>The light radiating from the talisman grew increasingly blinding, obscuring Taiyi's true form. The lightning began to distort, faintly outlining a humanoid figure, only the limbs and head visible, the facial features still indistinct.</p><p>However, the aura emanating from the humanoid lightning was undoubtedly Taiyi's!</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Deafening thunder echoed as dark, thick clouds gathered in the sky, blocking out the sun.</p><p>“As expected, the Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky, a glint of intrigue in his eyes. With a flash, he retreated beyond the range of the tribulation clouds.  Overcoming the tribulation was up to Taiyi alone.</p><p>However, Taiyi's true form had transformed into the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman.  Passing the Three Disasters Tribulation shouldn't be a problem. The key was overcoming the heart demon.</p><p>The Three Disasters arrived one after another, and the tribulation lightning within the clouds was golden.</p><p>In the Great Thousand World, when demon creatures underwent tribulation, the lightning was also golden.</p><p>It seemed the Heavenly Dao regarded Taiyi as a talisman demon!</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the mountaintop, watching the tribulation lightning rain down like raindrops until the very end, when the tribulation clouds dispersed. He hadn't moved a muscle.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, a bolt of lightning shot out from where the tribulation had taken place, landing before Qin Sang. Taiyi manifested.</p><p>His appearance remained the same, but he was filled with excitement. He bowed deeply.  "This junior has finally reached Deity Transformation, living up to Master’s expectations!"</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Your cultivation isn’t stable yet. Continue your secluded cultivation at Qingyang Temple. After your cultivation stabilizes, go out and search for the other Thunder Altars, locating all the branch altars.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>Returning to Qingyang Temple, Taiyi resumed his secluded cultivation in the underground chamber.</p><p>Master and disciples returned to their normal lives.</p><p>……</p><p>“…Knowing when to stop, then there is stability.  With stability, then there is tranquility.  With tranquility, then there is peace.  With peace, then there is contemplation.  With contemplation, then there is attainment…”</p><p>Behind the bamboo grove, the sound of reading echoed.</p><p>All the students exerted themselves, studying diligently, not daring to slack off.</p><p>It wasn't that they were suddenly driven by a thirst for knowledge, but rather, they had heard that their teacher had failed the autumn imperial examinations again!</p><p>Yu Lang didn't dare provoke his teacher at this time, so he swayed his head back and forth, reciting the scriptures he had already memorized by heart.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat beside him.</p><p>“Teacher says that if you read a book a hundred times, its meaning will reveal itself.  But I've even read and memorized the various commentaries from different schools of thought.  I wonder how much more I can glean…”</p><p>Lost in thought, Yu Lang noticed his senior sister suddenly lift her head and glance out the window.</p><p>“Senior Sister, what is it?”</p><p>Yu Lang looked but saw nothing.</p><p>“Someone… fell from the sky.”</p><p>Xiao Wu raised the book in her hand, her other small hand discreetly pointing towards the sky, then towards the window.
