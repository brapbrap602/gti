<h1>Chapter 715: The Two-Headed Wolf</h1><p>A single realm's difference carries immense significance.  </p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang pondered the reason. Most likely, it was due to the unique properties of the Nine Ghosts Demonic Flame.</p><p>The Nine Ghosts Demonic Flame could directly assail the primordial spirit, effective against both humans and demonic beasts. Combined with the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings' ability to bind demonic beasts, it was a perfect match.</p><p>Other types of magical treasures might not have yielded such a significant improvement.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, examining them repeatedly.</p><p>The rings' rank hadn't changed, but their value had clearly transcended such simple measures.</p><p>Truly a worthy secret treasure of the Spirit Controlling Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang marveled once again. By a stroke of luck, this treasure had reached its full potential in his hands.</p><p>Some demonic beasts possessed formidable bloodlines and powerful divine abilities, capable of holding their own even against late Core Formation cultivators. If he could subdue such a beast, Qin Sang's strength would surge dramatically.</p><p>Typically, Core Formation cultivators spent years in arduous cultivation, only reaching the late stage before their natal magical treasures could be elevated to mid-grade. Possessing a mid-grade treasure in the early or mid-stage was exceedingly rare.</p><p>Among Qin Sang's treasures, the Nine Dragons Celestial Chariot Talisman certainly qualified, and the Golden Radiance Armor could arguably be considered one as well.</p><p>This meant he now had four treasures comparable to mid-grade magical treasures!</p><p>Of course, reality often fell short of expectations.</p><p>To fully utilize the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, he first needed to find and subdue a mid-stage Nascent Soul demonic beast.</p><p>Subduing a demonic beast was no easy feat.  He had to defeat and capture it alive, then exploit its weakened state to impose his will. Even then, he'd have to constantly suppress the beast's resistance throughout the process.</p><p>The stronger the demonic beast's power and will, the higher the chance of failure.</p><p>When encountering those truly powerful demonic beasts, Qin Sang's only option was to flee, let alone attempting to subdue them.</p><p>Furthermore, the limitations of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings couldn't be ignored.</p><p>Forcibly subduing a demonic beast with the rings differed greatly from a beast willingly submitting or pledging allegiance. A subdued beast would harbor resentment, constantly seeking to break free and even retaliate against its master.</p><p>Controlling a demonic beast with the rings was also different from Qin Sang's own refined Flying Night Devil.</p><p>The beasts were bound by the power of the rings themselves, not Qin Sang's soul imprint. The Jade Buddha likely wouldn't be of much help.</p><p>Therefore, when using a subdued beast in combat, he had to recall it before his spiritual energy was depleted. He couldn't rely on them entirely, lest they turn against him.</p><p>The stronger the beast, the more cautious he had to be.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings still brought Qin Sang immense joy.</p><p>His heart surging with excitement, Qin Sang stored the Yang Ring, then flashed out of his cave, choosing a direction and vanishing into the depths of the azure sea.</p><p>...</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Fifteen years passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>It was the early hours of the morning. The stars hadn't yet faded, their light shimmering on the ocean surface, while a veil of white just began to spread across the distant eastern horizon.</p><p>Before the world fully awakened, this area of the sea remained utterly tranquil, disturbed only by the gentle whisper of the wind and the soft lapping of the waves.</p><p>The area was remarkably empty, with no islands visible in any direction.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of azure light shot from the west at astonishing speed. With a splash, it plunged into the sea and vanished.</p><p>A moment later, in another part of the ocean, a figure the size of a horse quietly emerged.</p><p>Under the starlight, its appearance was vaguely discernible.</p><p>It was a two-headed demonic beast, its wolf-like heads sprouting from its shoulders, far more imposing than any ordinary wolf.</p><p>Even more peculiar were the vertical pupils located at the center of each forehead. Its true eyes remained tightly shut, leaving only these pupils open, flashing with eerie azure light.</p><p>Now, those pupils were filled with anxiety.</p><p>Two azure wings sprouted from its flanks, but upon closer inspection, they weren't physical but formed from some strange energy.</p><p>The beast had an elegant, elongated body, and combined with its wings, its movements possessed a certain grace. Unfortunately, its injuries severely hampered its mobility.</p><p>A bloody wound gaped in its abdomen, likely inflicted by some powerful demonic beast's bite. The teeth had pierced so deep that its internal organs were almost visible.</p><p>Moreover, its front leg was limp and broken.</p><p>Due to these injuries, its wings were unsteady, causing it to wobble as it flew.</p><p>The beast surfaced, glanced back, and noticed a white line pursuing it from the west. Panic flooded its eyes.</p><p>It licked its abdominal wound, both heads letting out a low growl in unison. Then, its form flickered, splitting into three identical figures that fled in different directions.</p><p>Soon, a thunderous roar echoed from the west.</p><p>The white line turned out to be churning waves, parted by a ferocious shark.</p><p>Atop the shark stood two figures. One was Qin Sang, the other his Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang, riding the shark, stopped where the two-headed wolf had split. His gaze swept across the area, then he pointed in one direction. The Flying Night Devil immediately shot off.</p><p>Qin Sang then patted the shark's head, pointing in another direction, and muttered, "You chase this one."</p><p>The shark's tail flicked, sending up a splash, seeming reluctant.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. With a thought, a ring-shaped shadow appeared on the shark's head.</p><p>The shark thrashed in pain.</p><p>After this lesson, Qin Sang said coldly, "Azure Shark, if you help me capture that Two-Headed Wolf today, considering our time together, I'll grant you freedom. Otherwise, you'll be my battle pet forever!"</p><p>Over a decade ago, Qin Sang had refined the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings.</p><p>After subduing a demonic bird, fulfilling his dream of riding a crane down south, he'd chosen this Azure Shark, finding it quite useful.</p><p>The Azure Shark was an early Nascent Soul demonic beast, proficient in water-type divine abilities, a true overlord of the sea. Though captured by Qin Sang, it never truly submitted, yet it had proven its worth in numerous battles.</p><p>Man and beast shared a unique bond, forged through conflict.</p><p>If not for encountering this Two-Headed Wolf, Qin Sang wouldn't have considered replacing the Azure Shark so soon.</p><p>For over a decade, Qin Sang had stirred up trouble in the Demonic Sea, always searching for a mid-stage Nascent Soul demonic beast to subdue, but without success.</p><p>Three days ago, by chance, he'd encountered this Two-Headed Wolf.</p><p>The Two-Headed Wolf resembled the ancient divine beast, the Gale Wolf, hence its name.  However, it was far weaker than the true Gale Wolf.</p><p>This type of demonic beast excelled in wind manipulation. The wings on its flanks were wind wings, granting it exceptional speed and a unique shadow splitting technique capable of creating incredibly realistic illusions.</p><p>This particular Two-Headed Wolf possessed mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivation. After splitting its image, even late Core Formation cultivators would struggle to distinguish the real one.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to target it. However, this Two-Headed Wolf had just fought a fierce battle with another demonic beast, leaving it severely injured.</p><p>Qin Sang tracked it for two full days, finally finding an opportunity to launch a sneak attack, further worsening its injuries and greatly diminishing its power, affecting both its shadow splitting and escape techniques.</p><p>What followed was a night-long pursuit.</p>
