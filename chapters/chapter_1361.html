<h1>Chapter 1353: Upheaval in Bei Chen</h1><p>Within the Demon Sea resided myriad races of demon beasts, and he had explored less than one ten-thousandth of its area.</p><p>What attracted Qin Sang the most was the Four Sages Palace of Canglang Sea.</p><p>The Four Sages Palace inherited the Dao lineage of the Transformation Stage.</p><p>Qin Sang was already a Nascent Soul cultivator and was qualified to anticipate the Transformation Stage. Although it was unknown whether he could break through to the mid or late Nascent Soul stage, it was always good to prepare early.</p><p>During the Battle of Relying Heaven Peak, Qin Sang formed a connection with the descendants of the Four Sages Palace and received a token as a gift.</p><p>He originally intended to visit them personally after the Ziwei Palace stabilized, but he didn't expect such a change to occur. In the future, the hope of finding the Canglang Sea within the boundless storm was extremely slim.</p><p>...</p><p>On the way back.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were all heavy-hearted.</p><p>Qin Sang, True Person Cang Hong, Feather King, Lu Boyuan, and the Netherworld Demon Lord, among the remaining top experts, gathered to discuss, and then stopped the other Nascent Souls.</p><p>"Regarding today's events and the news of the Ascension Platform, it's best for everyone to make a Demonic Heart Oath not to spread it, so as not to cause turmoil in the Three Realms and unrest in Bei Chen... What do you all think?"</p><p>True Person Cang Hong spoke.</p><p>The matter of ascension was of great importance.</p><p>Bei Chen was separated from the Three Realms by storms, and they minded their own business.</p><p>Once the news spread, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Three Realms in the North Sea would probably not be able to sit still, and they would definitely come to Bei Chen to see for themselves no matter what.</p><p>At that time, Bei Chen, facing the experts of the Three Realms after the ascension of its top masters, might cause a great disturbance, and their situation would be very dangerous.</p><p>Fortunately, only Nascent Soul cultivators were present this time, so it was not difficult to block the news.</p><p>The Nascent Souls looked at each other; their families and businesses were large, and they didn't want to see Bei Chen in chaos.</p><p>"True Person's words are reasonable! If we tell others about the destruction of the Ascension Platform, they may not believe us, but instead think we are hiding something, causing more trouble. It's better to keep it buried in our stomachs."</p><p>A female Nascent Soul echoed.</p><p>The internal strife in Bei Chen had just ended not long ago, and people were yearning for stability. She didn't want to be drawn into the war again.</p><p>"But..."</p><p>An old man showed a hesitant look, "This Ascension Platform was destroyed, but there may be other Ascension Platforms. In any case, this is our only chance to escape the storm. If we have the opportunity to travel abroad in the future and seek help, we can't be restricted by the Demonic Heart Oath, right?"</p><p>These words expressed the inner thoughts of some people.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace had disappeared, but there were still other secret realms in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Even if they couldn't find it in Bei Chen, there were also the other Three Realms, whose territories far exceeded Bei Chen, and there must be many secret realms and forbidden lands.</p><p>"Old Devil Ye said that even with the Immortal Palace paving the way, it still requires at least the strength of a Grand Cultivator to gain a glimmer of hope in the spatial storm. If we find an Ascension Platform in the future, I'm afraid there won't be a second Ziwei Palace, I'm afraid..."</p><p>The one who spoke was dressed as a Taoist. He tsked twice, paused, "It's better for us to focus on painstaking cultivation, otherwise, even if we encounter an opportunity, we can only be spectators like today."</p><p>The old man chuckled dryly, "Fellow Daoist suspects that we need to reach the Transformation Stage to 'ascend'? At the Transformation Stage, we can go further in the storm belt than we can now, maybe we can directly escape the storm, so we don't necessarily need to take such a big risk."</p><p>The Taoist shrugged, "Who can say for sure? In the most optimistic scenario, we need at least the late Nascent Soul stage. How many of us can achieve that?"</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>Among the Nascent Souls present, True Person Cang Hong, Feather King, and others had the greatest hope, but they didn't have much confidence. They were very optimistic about Qin Sang, this rising star, but only Qin Sang knew his own difficulties.</p><p>"If we can't do it, it doesn't mean our descendants can't. Geniuses who appear once in a millennium, ten of them can appear in ten thousand years, and their achievements may not be much worse than Old Devil Ye. When making the oath, we need to consider our descendants, and we can't really keep it buried in our stomachs, cutting off their hope..."</p><p>Someone spoke.</p><p>They understood the unspoken meaning.</p><p>The Nascent Souls revealed a look of understanding.</p><p>This was exactly what Qin Sang and the others had just discussed.</p><p>"All regions of Bei Chen reconcile their differences, without being bound by the disputes between righteous and demonic, human and demon, and form the Bei Chen Alliance!"</p><p>...</p><p>The Nascent Souls reached a consensus, but the details needed careful consideration.</p><p>The distribution of benefits was crucial.</p><p>They discussed while flying towards the nearest Hanging Head Pass.</p><p>On the way, everyone gradually felt something was wrong.</p><p>In the past, after the Ziwei Palace closed, the spiritual tide of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would gradually subside until the next time the Ziwei Palace opened, and only occasional celestial phenomena would appear in the meantime.</p><p>This time, however, there was an anomaly.</p><p>They had already flown halfway, and the spiritual tide not only showed no signs of subsiding but was instead intensifying.</p><p>The Nascent Souls noticed the abnormality, landed on the ground, and observed for a while, their expressions becoming increasingly solemn.</p><p>If it continued, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would become like the storm belt overseas, a forbidden zone for life! What was even more terrifying was that the barrier here was not perfect, and there were seven gaps, which were the Seven Heroic Passes!</p><p>In the past, they appeared once every few hundred years, and the Small Cold Region alone could withstand the erosion of the spiritual tide.</p><p>If it happened every day, the Seven Heroic Passes would definitely not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>The former treasure land would become a shadow looming over Bei Chen!</p><p>"So that's how it is! It was always the Ziwei Palace suppressing the spiritual tide that made the Ancient Immortal Battlefield so special, different from other places," the Netherworld Demon Lord's tone was unusually grave.</p><p>The faces of the other Nascent Souls and demon kings of the Small Cold Region were also very unsightly.</p><p>If the Seven Heroic Passes fell, the Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Demon Hills would bear the brunt!</p><p>The impact of the Ziwei Palace's ascension was far greater than they had imagined.</p><p>"It seems that the Bei Chen Alliance is imperative."</p><p>Lu Boyuan sighed.</p><p>When the lips are gone, the teeth are cold; the spiritual tide doesn't show mercy.</p><p>The Bei Chen Great Desert was the farthest from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and had not received many benefits, but now that the Seven Heroic Passes were in danger, they had to contribute to defending them, which was really depressing.</p><p>"Let's go to the Seven Heroic Passes to see the situation first..."</p><p>The Nascent Souls set off again.</p><p>When they were about to reach the Seven Heroic Passes, True Person Cang Hong suddenly received a message, and his face became even more gloomy than those of the Nascent Souls of the Small Cold Region.</p><p>The message was from Fairy Qiu Zhi.</p><p>She didn't enter the Ziwei Palace but led people to guard outside the Immortal Gate to prevent Old Devil Ye from escaping.</p><p>True Person Cang Hong sighed and said, "The Sin God Palace, like the outer hall, was destroyed by the aftershock of the Immortal Palace's ascension, and the Abyss Ruins... were also affected! The Immortal Gate collapsed, the Abyss Ruins sank, and the bottom of the Sky Trace became an abyss in the blink of an eye, with spatial cracks densely packed, becoming a forbidden land! Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Qiu Zhi and the others were alert and evacuated in time, nearly falling there."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"The Abyss Ruins were also destroyed because of this?"</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone was shocked to hear this.</p><p>This time, Bei Chen's losses were truly great.</p><p>The two most mysterious secret realms were destroyed one after another, and it was unknown how the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would evolve. Although there were other secret realms and forbidden lands in other places, their scale and the preciousness of their treasures could not be compared.</p><p>The difficulty of finding opportunities had become even greater.</p><p>Xiang Qing suddenly exclaimed, "Not good! Boundless Cliff Valley!"</p><p>The Blood Lake in the inner valley of the Boundless Cliff Valley was connected to the Abyss Ruins, and it was even suspected to be a part of the Abyss Ruins.</p><p>Qingyang Demonic Sect's mountain gate was close to the Boundless Cliff Valley, how could Xiang Qing not be anxious?</p>
