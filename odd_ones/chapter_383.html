      After Hesitating for a while, Peggy felt that he would rather
                believe than not. He explained earnestly, “There was a Silver
                who claimed to be the emissary of DarkStar. I found a black bead
                on him. I don’t know what it was, but I thought it was valuable,
                so I kept it with me. But a few days ago during the scrimmage at
                the dock, the bead was lost. It might have been picked up by
                someone…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Since the bead was no longer in his possession, telling the
                truth would cost him nothing. The other party was likely
                DarkStar, not to mention his idol—just based on DarkStar’s style
                of doing things, if he refused to disclose information, the end
                could be imagined. According to the risk estimation,
                compromising was the safest.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao narrowed his eyes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Bead? What is that? I’ve never heard of this event before in
                  my previous life.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Could it be a hidden storyline?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao thought it was seemingly possible. The fact that
                DarkStar had sent Ember meant that it was a very important
                matter. Perhaps it was a large-scale secret mission that no one
                had triggered in his previous life.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You are very cooperative; I will pay a reward for the
                information.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      ( NovelFull )  “I don’t need to be paid.” Peggy rubbed his hands
                and said, “I just want to be able to join the DarkStar.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Then it occurred to Han Xiao suddenly. No wonder Peggy did not
                bargain before revealing the information—he turned out to be a
                hidden supporter of the DarkStar. At first, when Han Xiao saw
                Peggy’s information as a hybrid Godoran, he had already guessed
                as much. The reason that he had chosen to act as DarkStar was
                not only just to cause trouble—he also wanted to try his luck.
                As it turned out, he had hit the target.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In fact, the reasoning was not difficult. Peggy was a hybrid
                Godoran and a wanted criminal, so he was likely to be supporting
                DarkStar.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had dared to use the name of DarkStar because he
                considered that Ember would use another identity and keep his
                identity a secret even if he came to ask about it first. If they
                used the identity of mercenaries, Peggy would definitely hate
                them. They might not necessarily get the information, and they
                also might expose themselves.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With a cough, Han Xiao said seriously, “I’ve seen your
                convictions. You’re a Godoran with resolve. Our great cause is
                in need of hot-blooded men like you…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Before Peggy was happy about it, Han Xiao’s words took a turn.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “However, we have strict screening procedures for new people. To
                prevent spies from getting in, there is one thing that needs
                your help. There’s another force on this floating island. Before
                me, did anyone ask the same questions?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Uh, no.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Great, we’re one step ahead. This is your chance to do
                something for the organization. Just like me, they might very
                likely find you in a while, asking the same questions, and you
                should tell them that the bead has been thrown into space.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao held back his laughter and said, “After you complete
                this, DarkStar will accept you at the right time, taking you to
                the secret base for formal training.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Got it.” Peggy was convinced, his face solemn.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He did not think that the Silvers would be involved in so much
                and could not help but be curious about what secret that bead
                had, attracting these large organizations to secretly compete
                for it!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the same time, Peggy was also annoyed. If he had detected how
                special the bead was back then, he might have benefitted even
                more from it… However, it was too late to regret.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The communication ended. Han Xiao turned away from the pier and
                changed to his original clothes when there was no one around.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “So, what DarkStar wants is a black bead, but its whereabouts
                are unknown.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Although he did get something, the intel was still not enough.
                If he used normal methods, the trail would end here…
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, Han Xiao did not use normal methods.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Since the goal is known, I can try to use Destiny’s Child’s
                  card. Hopefully it will give me some valuable information.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Since he at least needed to know what the target was, Han Xiao
                decided to use the foreseeing card. Although the intel from
                Peggy was very little, it happened to just meet the
                requirements.

      The familiar hazy fog appeared, like a dream scene. Han Xiao’s
                line of sight passed through the fog, and a black bead appeared
                in front of his eyes, caught by a palm. Looking up along the
                arm, a handsome face fixed in the eyes of Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After a full two seconds, the image shattered. Han Xiao was back
                to the original environment, as if he had experienced an
                illusion.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Li Ge‽
      </em>
      Han Xiao’s eyes opened wide.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He really did not think that a bead would have been picked up by
                the players and picked up by this naughty kid at that. No wonder
                it had not been given to him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Just twenty minutes after Han Xiao left, Ember rushed to the
                pier and looked for Peggy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Peggy remembered Han Xiao’s advice, and his expression slightly
                changed. These DarkStar competitors did indeed come very
                quickly.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Who are you? What do you want?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I am a mercenary—my employer is one of the Silvers. The
                prisoners have been rescued, so you are no longer our enemy. Now
                I want to ask you something, did you kill two Silvers? We want
                to know the details; I can pay a certain intel fee for it.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ember chose to impersonate a mercenary. Only mercenaries knew
                about the two dead Silvers, so the motive of asking about it was
                reasonable. Otherwise, it would have caused a lot of suspicion,
                and they might have gotten reported as the people who attacked
                the slave market. In his mind, he had not been exposed, so no
                one would know their DarkStar identity.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      But his choices happened cause a coincidental phenomenon; Han
                Xiao and Ember’s identities switched!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Peggy was convinced. He thought that Han Xiao was ‘DarkStar’,
                and Ember, who really belonged to DarkStar, became regarded as
                DarkStar’s enemy!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      More coincidentally, because everyone only had a part of the
                intel, both Peggy and Ember were kept in the dark. Only Han Xiao
                could barely see the truth, and the actions that he took led the
                two of them to deviate further from the truth!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Are you a mercenary‽” Hatred appeared in Peggy’s eyes. It was
                the mercenaries who had made him make such a huge loss, yet they
                wanted intel‽
      <em class="calibre7">
       If not for that DarkStar agent’s advice, I wouldn’t even talk
                  to you!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “As long as you are willing to answer,” Ember said, “I can pay
                50,000 to make up for your loss. This is a large sum of money.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      DarkStar had deep pockets. Ember directly transferred 10,000
                deposit, and he had confidence that he could make Peggy talk.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Even though Peggy was not a money slave, he was also shocked by
                this generosity—it did not look like mercenaries at all.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      His eyes turned around, pretending to be moved by the money, and
                started talking about the process of capturing the Silvers, only
                hiding the Secret Message Bead.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As expected, Ember listened to the very end and found the
                information that they wanted was missing. He had no choice but
                to make his goal clear. “Did you get a black bead from these two
                people?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What bead? Never seen before, I threw them out of the ship and
                was too lazy to waste time frisking. The thing you’re talking
                about is probably drifting in the universe.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Peggy sneered in his heart and lied, following Han Xiao’s
                advice.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A flash of disappointment flickered in Ember’s eyes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This was the worst result!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      If the carrier’s corpse had accidentally been caught by a star’s
                gravity, the Secret Message Bead would have turned to dust as
                well. If absorbed by a black hole, it would also not ever be
                found.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “By the way, has anyone ever asked you the same question?” Ember
                suddenly asked.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “No.” Peggy denied it immediately.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ember frowned and transferred the rest of the reward to Peggy
                before leaving with a heavy heart.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Now, the trail had been broken. Their task force had no use, so
                they could only report it to the headquarters.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the spaceship, Peggy looked at the black communication screen
                before smiling, full of anticipation.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Joining DarkStar had always been his goal, but because DarkStar
                was too mysterious, he had not had an opportunity to contact
                them. That had always been a great regret for him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      And now, the opportunity that he had been dreaming of had fallen
                from the sky!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I have made a contribution for DarkStar! After waiting for so
                  long, I’ve finally caught the opportunity. I finally, finally,
                  can join DarkStar…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Near the ruins of the slave market, the players did not have to
                return to the guards. They were temporarily settling the Volga
                brothers and Aroshia down.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They surrounded Aroshia like butterflies. Aroshia’s beauty was
                over the top, so it was very pleasant to the eyes. Furthermore,
                she was a beauty suffering from amnesia. With Bun-Hit-Dog as the
                representative, the hormones of most of the males were flooding,
                and they chatted with Aroshia excitedly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Aroshia was very calm. She did not have any interest in the
                surroundings, so she was only replying from time to time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the side, the god players of the various clubs kept their
                distance, maintained their reserve, and chatted with each other.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this moment, all the Black Star Mercenary Group players
                triggered a new mission simultaneously.
