<h1>Chapter 965: The Wasteland</h1><p>“Is this Flower Fairy Lake?”</p><p>Jiufeng Wang didn’t say anything more.  Glancing outside the stone hall, she vanished in a flash, leaving behind a faint remark, “There are still some things you need to do. Follow me.”</p><p>The demons exchanged glances. They had thought the task was easily completed, but it seemed there were further complications.</p><p>No one dared disobey Jiufeng Wang’s order, and they quickly followed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt helpless and could only continue to endure. He noticed Yuan Zhu lagging behind, his expression unusual.</p><p>“Daoist Yuan, what happened?”</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked.</p><p>Yuan Zhu shook his head, forcing a smile. “I had an important matter to attend to, but I don’t know if I’ll have time…Alas!”</p><p>The two also followed closely, returning above the hills.</p><p>Jiufeng Wang sent out several streams of light, and the entrance instantly returned to its original state, reinforced with a strong barrier to prevent accidental intrusion by cultivators.</p><p>“Caiyi, where are the Yuan Ying cultivators among those cultivators now?”</p><p>After setting up the barrier, Jiufeng Wang asked Caiyi Xianzi beside her.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi replied, “Reporting to Ninth Aunt, after the Qisha Hall opened, Gu Heng Daoist and I immediately entered and carefully investigated. We found that a portion of the Yuan Ying cultivators from both clans entered the seventh level of the Heavenly Tower, including the Heavenly Dao Sect's Lingzhuzi and the Wu Clan's Grand Shaman. They haven't come out yet. The other Yuan Ying cultivators dispersed to various locations.  Human cultivators openly followed most of the Wu Clan's Yuan Ying cultivators.  Ninth Aunt, if you want to go to the Heavenly Tower, you must be careful.”</p><p>“We’re not going to the Heavenly Tower.”</p><p>Jiufeng Wang’s gaze was cold. “Lingzhuzi and the Grand Shaman being in the Heavenly Tower is better; it avoids affecting this Wang's plans.”</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi led the way, walking alongside Jiufeng Wang.</p><p>Jiufeng Wang deliberately slowed her speed. She took out a map and occasionally asked Caiyi Xianzi, seemingly confirming something.</p><p>The demons remained silent, following closely behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after they flew, a muffled sound like an earthquake came from ahead.  Moments later, a slight tremor spread from the front through the poisonous algae.</p><p>All the demons were startled.</p><p>“Did you notice anything when you came in?”</p><p>Jiufeng Wang stopped her flight, her beautiful eyes narrowed, staring ahead.</p><p>“No,” Caiyi Xianzi shook her head, puzzled. “It was normal when we came in, and we didn't encounter any cultivators.  Perhaps a restriction was accidentally triggered. Ninth Aunt, should we go and take a look?”</p><p>Jiufeng Wang shook her head.  “Forget it, the important thing is to proceed. Let's not cause unnecessary trouble.”</p><p>The demons moved again, but more cautiously.</p><p>Aside from that tremor, there were no further anomalies.</p><p>Soon, they returned to the outskirts of Flower Fairy Lake and flew towards its exit.</p><p>At this moment, Jiufeng Wang seemed to sense something.  She suddenly stopped, frowning towards another direction of Flower Fairy Lake.  Only then did Qin Sang and the others notice the distant commotion – faint roars and sounds of something breaking through the air.</p><p>Surprisingly, after staring in that direction for a moment, Jiufeng Wang flashed, changing direction and flying towards the source of the sounds. Her flight technique was astonishing; she easily left Qin Sang and the others behind.</p><p>The demons hurriedly followed.</p><p>When they finally caught up, they saw Jiufeng Wang holding a cultivator by the throat. Below her, amongst the poisonous swamp, lay the corpse of a ferocious beast.</p><p>The cultivator was still alive.</p><p>The terror on his face hadn't subsided. Seeing so many people suddenly appear, he became even more uneasy, struggling to speak, “Thank you, senior, for killing the beast and saving my life. I am willing to…”</p><p>Before he could finish, the cultivator’s eyes rolled back, his limbs convulsed, and he showed a pained expression.  A gurgling sound escaped his throat, and then he was lifeless.</p><p>“So it is!”</p><p>Jiufeng Wang dropped the cultivator’s corpse, muttering to herself, a trace of joy on her face. Without another word, she flew forward again.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were full of questions. They quickly glanced at the bodies of the cultivator and the beast before pursuing her. Qin Sang didn’t recognize the cultivator, but the beast’s corpse caught his attention.</p><p>The beast looked like a black wolf, fierce and terrifying. It was the first time he had seen such a creature.</p><p>In a short while, they crossed two mountain ridges and saw an unexpected sight.</p><p>On a raised ridge, several ancient wooden towers stood there, half-submerged in the sea of poisonous algae, only their peaks visible.</p><p>Among these towers were also some ancient wooden halls, scattered among them, also submerged by the poisonous algae.</p><p>“This place was once quite well-known.  What’s remarkable is that it’s located on the outskirts of Flower Fairy Lake, where the potency of the poison is limited. Many cultivators explored it, but eventually it was abandoned…”</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi, who had carefully studied Flower Fairy Lake, recognized the place.</p><p>But she couldn't understand why the Nine-Phoenix King had suddenly changed targets and come here.</p><p>Her gaze swept across the scene, and the Rainbow-robed Fairy pointed to a wooden hall. "There!"</p><p>The demons filed in.  The ancient hall's protective barrier had been broken. The Nine-Phoenix King stood inside, hands behind her back, gazing at a bare wall.</p><p>The wooden hall was empty, completely ransacked.  If it weren't for ancient protections, the walls themselves would have been demolished.</p><p>"Ninth Aunt," the Rainbow-robed Fairy said, looking at the wall with a puzzled expression, "Is there some hidden mechanism here?"</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King nodded slightly. "We celestial phoenix descendants are extremely sensitive to spatial fluctuations.  I sensed something unusual a moment ago. After soul-searching the cultivator, I learned he was lucky enough to open an ancient restriction, discovering a place that seems never to have been explored."</p><p>"A restriction never before opened! Here?"</p><p>The Rainbow-robed Fairy was incredulous, her face alight with excitement. "Ninth Aunt is blessed with incredible fortune; she discovered a treasure trove upon entering the Seven-Kill Palace. If the cultivator hadn't gotten there first, there must be many treasures inside. I wonder what kind of secret realm it is? Did that ferocious wolf come from the restriction?"</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King opened her palm, revealing a white jade seal. She pressed the jade gently against the center of the wall.  Ripples appeared on the surface, and a moon-shaped gate materialized, leading to an unknown wasteland.</p><p>The wasteland was also overgrown with poisonous algae, the scenery similar to the outside, stretching endlessly to the horizon.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King stepped through the moon gate, her expression shifting slightly. She warned, "It's all poisonous algae!  And far more toxic than outside. Be careful not to go too deep."</p><p>The demons were startled, activating their protections before cautiously entering the moon gate.</p><p>To their shock, the poison at the wasteland's entrance was comparable to the depths of the Flower Fairy Lake. Several demons, who only had thousand-year viper pills and no other antidotes, proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>Only Qin Sang, Gu Heng, the Rainbow-robed Fairy, and Yuan Zhu remained unaffected.</p><p>Qin Sang stood behind the moon gate, her gaze sweeping across the vast expanse of poisonous algae.  A look of surprise crossed her eyes.  After entering the wasteland, the Fat Silkworm suddenly became agitated, transmitting a feeling of intense longing.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm hadn't reacted since entering Flower Fairy Lake.  She had thought there were no herbs of interest here, but it seemed she was wrong.</p>
