<h1></h1><p>As the middle-aged man walked, he took out ice mirrors one after another from his Mustard Seed Pouch, without turning his head, he said, "I am condensing an ice key to sense the Sacred Object. Excessive evil brings self-destruction. In case that fiend dies in someone else's hands and the Sacred Object falls into another's possession, if that person doesn't understand the Sacred Object, perhaps they will bring it to the Myriad Demons Assembly. Hehe… we would obtain it without lifting a finger."</p><p>The old woman sighed softly, "The Ice Demon Physique isn't so easy to perish."</p><p>However, she didn't stop the middle-aged man.</p><p>After all, they had spent too much effort searching for the Sacred Object; all situations had to be considered.</p><p>The old woman withdrew her gaze, falling into contemplation, considering how to find the traitor without fail, and how to guard against Hunmo (Mixed Demon) Senior.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Myriad Demons City.</p><p>Within the mountains shrouded in Immortal Clouds.</p><p>Inside a slightly sinister cave dwelling.</p><p>At this moment, the door of the cave dwelling was wide open, a black-robed man with slightly high cheekbones and a cold aura was standing respectfully in front of the cave dwelling, looking at the figure sitting with their back to him.</p><p>"Have you found the person who controls the Demonic Fire?"</p><p>The seated figure didn't move at all, and Hunmo Senior's voice came out.</p><p>Hearing the voice, the black-robed man's mind involuntarily tightened.</p><p>The expression on his face became even more respectful, "Master, no one who controls this kind of Demonic Fire has been found in the Boundless Sea. This disciple is preparing to expand the search area and look for them in the Crescent Moon Realm and other outer territories. Also, many fellow cultivators from the outer territories have come to participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly, and this disciple is trying his best to contact them and gather information."</p><p>There was an unsettling silence inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Just as the black-robed man was feeling uneasy, Hunmo Senior finally spoke, "Has the Valley Master of Hundred Flowers Valley shown any unusual activity?"</p><p>The black-robed man thought for a moment and replied, "This junior brother sent people to secretly monitor Hundred Flowers Valley and discovered that the Valley Master of Hundred Flowers Valley completely sealed off the mountain after returning, and no one has entered or left since. However, since Hundred Flowers Valley is located in the Black Swamp, which is rarely visited, it is difficult to hide. Those juniors have low cultivation levels and dare not get too close to Hundred Flowers Valley. After the Myriad Demons Assembly ends, this junior brother will go there in person."</p><p>Hunmo Senior's voice softened a little, "Forget it, you don't need to expend too much effort on this person anymore. Leave a few people behind to pay attention to the movements of Hundred Flowers Valley. When this person was contending for treasures, he didn't hesitate to go to great lengths, covering himself with that kind of black spirit fire throughout the process, shielding my senses, which may not be that person... Hehe, concealing and hiding, maybe it's an acquaintance."</p><p>The black-robed man raised his eyelids and pondered, "Yu Yi Yuanjun (Feathered Robe Primordial Lord) suspects it's General Gui (Ghost General), or someone from Bamboo Courtyard."</p><p>General Gui, a demonic powerhouse in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>It is said that he was a general in the mortal world, so he took a very strange Dharma name.</p><p>This person is good at refining puppets, but the materials are the bodies and nascent souls of cultivators. His actions are ruthless, making his enemies wish they were dead, his demonic reputation is second only to Hunmo Senior.</p><p>Bamboo Courtyard is the most famous sect in the Northern Sea in the way of puppets. It belongs to the righteous path, and its disciples mostly use puppets to walk outside, hiding themselves in the dark.</p><p>Their puppets are realistic enough to be confused with real people, so they are very mysterious.</p><p>Hunmo Senior recalled the puppet that snatched the Seven-Story Pagoda in the Buddha Hall and grunted in agreement, "Puppets comparable to the Nascent Soul Middle Stage are not common, Yu Yi Yuanjun's speculation is not without reason. However, just two magical artifacts. Since what he took was not a spirit treasure, there is no need to delve into it, you have more important things to do. How would he have thought that the most precious treasure on the offering table is actually this item he abandoned?"</p><p>As he spoke, Hunmo Senior stroked the Lingzhi (Reishi Mushroom) Scepter in his hand, his tone with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>After Qin Sang escaped.</p><p>Hunmo Senior and Yu Yi Yuanjun divided the remaining magical artifacts in the Buddha Hall. The Lingzhi Scepter undoubtedly fell into Hunmo Senior's hands.</p><p>The black-robed man listened carefully, curious about what the remaining treasure was and why it was precious.</p><p>But Hunmo Senior didn't intend to explain, and he didn't dare to ask further.</p><p>Hearing Hunmo Senior mention that there was something more important, the black-robed man was stunned for a moment, then recalled something and said excitedly, "Is Master talking about Huang Longshi's (Yellow Dragon Master) cave dwelling? Have you found it?"</p><p>Hunmo Senior's transaction with the Xuantian (Profound Heaven) Palace was not hidden from him.</p><p>He knew very well that Hunmo Senior had obtained an important relic of Huang Longshi from the Xuantian Palace, pointing to Huang Longshi's cave dwelling.</p><p>Hunmo Senior disdained, "The Xuantian Palace, like you, thought that Huang Longshi's cave dwelling was immensely attractive to this venerable one. Hehe…"</p><p>After a pause, Hunmo Senior said lightly, "Little do they know that this venerable one's true purpose is hidden in another inconspicuous condition, otherwise, why would this venerable one agree to them so easily without asking why? I have basically confirmed a previous guess, and there are still some things that need to be verified. Focus your efforts and secretly pay attention to the movements of the people from Xuantian Palace in Myriad Demons City, I want to see what they want to do…"</p><p>"This disciple obeys!"</p><p>The black-robed man respectfully bowed and exited the cave dwelling.</p><p>The cave dwelling closed silently, swallowed by darkness.</p><p>After a long silence, a barely audible sigh came from the darkness.</p><p>"Transformation Spirit (God Transformation) Realm ah…"</p><p>…</p><p>Myriad Demons City.</p><p>Evening time.</p><p>The first day of the assembly ended perfectly.</p><p>Several auctions were wonderful.</p><p>As soon as it ended, the entire list of treasures spread throughout Myriad Demons City.</p><p>Low-level cultivators looked at the treasures on the list, each one more eye-catching than the last, unable to take their eyes off them, only hating that they didn't have enough spirit stones in hand, watching the treasures fall into the hands of others.</p><p>The flow of people in front of the Myriad Demons City gate was like a weave, some left satisfied, some entered the city with expectations.</p><p>Tan Hao walked out of the wooden building.</p><p>Recalling his extravagant actions just now, and the treasures in his Mustard Seed Pouch, his heart became even more vigilant. He inconspicuously observed his surroundings and strode away.</p><p>Confirming that he was not being followed, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief, also knowing that he was being a bit of an alarmist, after all, the things he bought now, although precious, were not enough to make a Nascent Soul cultivator take risks.</p><p>However, that may not be the case in the last few days.</p><p>The number of spirit objects required for the Soul Ascension Ritual is extremely large, in total, the value is not low, especially the three most important ones, all of which are rare treasures in the world.</p><p>Fortunately, these three are likely not to appear at the auction.</p><p>Returning to the rented cave dwelling, Tan Hao rested briefly and began to busy himself again.</p><p>In the following days, Tan Hao did not have a moment of leisure.</p><p>He frequently shuttled between trade fairs and auctions, the spirit stones in his Mustard Seed Pouch were consumed like flowing water, but gradually became fuller in another way.</p><p>The Myriad Demons Assembly continued until noon on the ninth day.</p><p>Tan Hao, wearing a new disguise, appeared in front of the Myriad Demons City gate.</p><p>Luckily, he was able to gather Qin Sang's requirements at the auction just now. He inquired about the afternoon auction and found that there were no treasures that met Qin Sang's requirements, so he decided to leave the island immediately.</p><p>It is really stressful to carry so many treasures.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed secretly, strode out of Myriad Demons City, and was slightly relieved to see guards flying over the island from time to time. He changed direction several times in succession and quietly left Hunmo Island from the south.</p><p>After leaving the island, regardless of whether he was being followed, Tan Hao activated the sound transmission talisman to notify Qin Sang and flew away through the air.</p>
