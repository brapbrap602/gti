<h1>Chapter 1815: Hunting the凶物, Enlightenment in the Dao</h1><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>The two men were enjoying their drinks.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren, feeling inspired, casually broke off a long leaf from a Jianxin orchid. Using the leaf as a sword, he instantly produced a sword image in the air, yet devoid of any killing intent. The ethereal feeling harmonized perfectly with the moonlit night; it was truly exquisite.</p><p>Qin Sang watched intently, and with Zhijiejian Zhenren's guidance, it was arguably the first time he received such insightful instruction in swordsmanship.</p><p>The Qingzhu elder was a good teacher and friend, unfortunately they met too late, leaving Qin Sang only a sword manual.</p><p>Qin Sang could only occasionally interject, even though their current discussion concerned the Chengying Sword lineage.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren, despite not having received the lineage, could instantly grasp and expand upon Qin Sang's descriptions and demonstrations, offering Qin Sang various inspirations. His mastery and talent in swordsmanship left Qin Sang feeling inferior.</p><p>They finished the last cup of fine wine.</p><p>Qin Sang was still immersed in the world of swordsmanship when the sword servant approached to refill his cup, startling him awake.</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren waved his hand, dismissing the sword servant.  He looked at Qin Sang and smiled, "My friend, you too are a sword fanatic."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile, bowing deeply, "Thanks to your guidance, brother, I have glimpsed the beauty of the sword Dao."</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren stepped aside, lightly flicking the orchid leaf, producing a clear ringing sound.  "I await the day, my friend, when you master the sword Dao and we can fulfill our agreement to duel."</p><p>With that, he waved his sleeve and gracefully walked towards his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Zhijiejian Zhenren's back, then said, "Any command you give, I will not hesitate to fulfill."</p><p>Zhijiejian Zhenren laughed heartily, "I would never be so formal with you."</p><p>The moonlit night was quiet.</p><p>There was nothing important in the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang bid farewell to the sword servant and left Jianxin Island, heading east. He took a small teleportation array from Zuodai Pass and entered the territory of the Yao Kingdom.</p><p>Among the many Yao kingdoms in Jushan, one was ruled by the White-tailed Wolf Clan. Located in the northeast of Jushan, its remote location meant it rarely clashed with humans, living in peaceful seclusion.</p><p>Entering the Yao Kingdom, Qin Sang finally reached a giant rock atop a barren mountain, sat cross-legged, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Outside the mountain, in the forest, a small figure darted swiftly.  It was a beast, resembling a dog and a fox, with extraordinary stealth; its movements were completely undetectable.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The beast leaped onto the mountaintop, meeting Qin Sang's gaze. It shivered, then showed a fawning expression, prostrating itself.  Its voice was excited, "Little demon pays respects to the Celestial!"</p><p>"It seems you've obtained the divine power," Qin Sang said calmly, "Why don't you transform into human form?"</p><p>The visitor was the Bei Yao.</p><p>Years ago, he had let the Bei Yao go, letting it seek its own fortune. The beast was cunning, and it indeed succeeded.</p><p>The Bei Yao knelt, not daring to rise, "This one's transformation is incomplete, my form is ugly, I fear it would offend the Celestial's eyes."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at it with a wry smile, "Shouldn't I call you Lord Bei Shen now?"</p><p>The Bei Yao raised its head, suddenly showing an indignant expression, "Those wolf demons are nepotistic, only their own kin are eligible for temple worship and deification. This one is not trusted, and deeply resents being unable to obtain secrets for the Celestial!"</p><p>"Oh? Is that so."</p><p>Qin Sang had previously been unaware of the intricacies of the Yao god's appointment. The more the demons valued this, the more important the Yao god was.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang still didn't understand what the Guifang Kingdom was plotting, and the Heavenly Court remained tight-lipped about it.</p><p>The Bei Yao explained, confirming that once demons were deified, they would reside in temples and enjoy offerings and incense, at least for now there seemed no change from before their deification.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained impassive.</p><p>Unable to guess Qin Sang's thoughts, the Bei Yao was anxious.  Suddenly remembering something, it quickly said, "Celestial, this little demon has been in contact with the snake demon. It has now become a demon general under a demon marquis, very imposing.  It is said that it will be sent to the Nie Yuan. Perhaps now is the time to order it to come and see the Celestial…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  He had originally intended to contact the two demons this time.</p><p>He had already suspected that the snake demon's heritage was extraordinary, and his guess proved correct.</p><p>"Summon it, I'll wait for you here," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The Bei Yao bowed and withdrew, its face showing disappointment.</p><p>It had tried everything, but couldn't remove the poison hidden within its body.  It was constantly anxious, fearing Qin Sang would forget it, and it would suddenly die from the poison.</p><p>Finally, when Qin Sang arrived, he didn't mention giving it medicine to cure the poison.</p><p>The Bei Yao sighed in its heart and hurried away.</p><p>…</p><p>On the barren mountain.</p><p>The Huying Sword hung in the air, the surrounding void seemed to twist slightly.  Suddenly, the spiritual sword disappeared into the void, and then its shadow appeared and disappeared intermittently.</p><p>Rustling sounds came from below the mountain.</p><p>A wolf demon and a snake demon arrived together.</p><p>Outside the mountain, they revealed their true forms as demons, showing their submission. They obediently climbed to the mountaintop and respectfully stood beside Qin Sang as he practiced his swordsmanship.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang slowly sheathed his sword.</p><p>The two demons immediately prostrated themselves.</p><p>"Rise," Qin Sang said calmly.  He looked at the snake demon. Before he could speak, the snake demon voluntarily recounted its experiences over the years.</p><p>Qin Sang listened and then asked, "The Demon Marquis wants to send you to the Nìe Wasteland to establish a temple and become a god, to teach the ghost people? Becoming a demon god allows you to remain in the Nìe Wasteland indefinitely, without your mind becoming muddled?"</p><p>It turned out that the snake demon, using a token, had entered the Gui Fang kingdom and quickly gained an audience with a Demon Marquis under a Demon King.</p><p>He learned that the inheritance was actually a divine seed spread by the Demon Marquis while traveling on the orders of the Demon King.</p><p>Demon cultivators who received this inheritance were more likely to transform into demon gods.</p><p>These cultivators were scattered across various locations. When the Gui Fang kingdom acted, they would issue commands via the token, with all of them becoming gods to bolster their strength.</p><p>However, the Demon King valued talent highly and thus ordered the Demon Marquis to leave a message: any exceptionally talented demons could travel to the Gui Fang kingdom to serve him.</p><p>The snake demon relied on Qin Sang to successfully reach the Gui Fang kingdom.</p><p>Its talent was acceptable but not enough to attract the Demon King's attention; it didn't even see the Demon King's face.</p><p>The Demon Marquis appointed it as a demon commander and bestowed many treasures upon it. The snake demon's injuries were fully healed, and it successfully broke through to the mid-stage. Without the threat of Qin Sang, it felt it had reached the peak of its life.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it recently learned that it would be sent to the Nìe Wasteland to become a demon god.</p><p>Demon gods in the Nìe Wasteland and those in the interior were not comparable. If the Heavenly Court launched an operation to destroy temples and purge demon gods, it would certainly begin in the Nìe Wasteland; they would be the first targets, essentially equivalent to exile.</p><p>The snake demon immediately felt a sense of foreboding and uncertainty; those benefits were clearly not free.</p><p>"I don't know the details," said the snake demon, "but it's said that after becoming a demon god, one can stay longer, but still needs to return to the Gui Fang kingdom periodically…"</p><p>The snake demon did not hide anything, recounting everything honestly.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, then, seeing he could learn no more, stopped questioning. His gaze swept over the two demons, and he flicked his fingers, sending two beams of light towards their foreheads.</p><p>The two demons trembled but dared not resist.</p><p>The light entered their minds, revealing a body-tempering secret technique.</p><p>"Enter meditation," Qin Sang said sternly.</p><p>The two demons immediately obeyed, circulating the secret technique. Qin Sang raised his hand and pressed it lightly on their heads.</p><p>Then, the two demons felt a portion of the dormant poison within their bodies being drawn out, spreading throughout their bodies, and being refined using the secret technique.</p><p>After a long time, the two demons awakened, surprised to find their physical bodies significantly strengthened. They couldn't help but show their joy.</p><p>"In the future, you can also collect poison to refine your bodies, but remember not to be greedy. If I cannot detoxify you in time, you can use this technique to suppress it for a while, but…"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted coldly, "Do not try to refine the poison within your bodies, or you will trigger a poisonous outburst, and even a god cannot save you!"</p><p>"We dare not!"</p><p>The two demons prostrated themselves and cried out, "Thank you, Immortal, for bestowing this technique!"</p><p>This secret technique came from the *Poison God Scripture*. Qin Sang had extracted a portion of it.  The effect wasn't as good as the original, but it was safer; he slightly modified it to suit demon cultivators.</p><p>A combination of kindness and severity ensured the demons' submission.</p><p>"Alright, from now on, serve me diligently, and I will not mistreat you. I have more tasks for you…"</p><p>Qin Sang instructed them, then parted ways with the two demons, returning the same way to the Flask Island.</p><p>He first went to the rented mortal dwelling.</p><p>Old Chen, who looked after the dwelling, appeared even older, but thanks to the medicine Qin Sang had given him, his hidden injuries were healed, and he was strong and healthy, his spirit even better than before.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the inner hall's quiet room.</p><p>The spirit array in the quiet room remained unchanged, with no message from Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Ten years had passed. Qin Sang had been in seclusion on Sword Heart Island, never leaving Ju Shan Prefecture, and he didn't know Mo Xingdao's current situation.</p><p>He took out a blank spirit talisman, pondered for a moment, inscribed a new communication method, and flicked it with his finger.</p><p>The talisman shot towards the spirit array, like a stone thrown into water, creating ripples before disappearing.</p><p>He was going to Ju Shan Prefecture to cultivate, unable to frequently check on things, and so the previous communication method couldn't be used anymore.</p><p>The snake demon's assignment to the Nìe Wasteland to establish a temple and become a god would be convenient for relaying messages.</p><p>He had made his arrangements: Mo Xingdao would send a message to the Hyena demon, which would then be passed on to the snake demon. Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao had already established secret markings; even if intercepted, others would not understand the true meaning.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang also gave the snake demon and the hyena demon a task: to collect the necessary spirit herbs for him in the Gui Fang kingdom.</p><p>He waved his sleeve, erasing all traces, and left the quiet room. Seeing Old Chen respectfully waiting outside, Qin Sang asked, "Old Chen, do you have any living relatives?"</p><p>Old Chen was startled. "Reporting to Master, I have a nephew who settled down in Hongdong Island, but we haven't been in contact for many years."</p><p>"I won't be returning,"</p><p>Qin Sang said, producing some silver and spirit stones. "I leave you this courtyard and these, enough to see you through your old age. Remember to use the spirit stones sparingly."</p><p>Old Man Chen felt his arm suddenly heavy, utterly bewildered.  When he looked up again, Qin Sang was gone, leaving him to prostrate himself in prayer.</p><p>Leaving the courtyard, Qin Sang went to Master Qi's mansion, explained his intentions, and soon flew off from Hu Island, leaving emergency contact information on Sword Heart Island as well.</p><p>His basic arrangements were complete; there was no need to stay longer.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his flying light and headed north.</p><p>Returning to the Vile Origin, Qin Sang flew relentlessly, reaching the vicinity of the altar at Mount Ju but did not stop, continuing north.</p><p>Gradually, he ventured deeper.</p><p>Few people ever came this far; even late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators only visited when hunting ferocious beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose was precisely that – hunting beasts.</p><p>Firstly, to acquire beast corpses and cores to exchange for medicinal herbs, and secondly, to test his recent understanding of the Dao of Killing.</p><p>Whether due to the aftereffects of the previous tremor at Mount Ju's altar or some other reason, Qin Sang searched for a long time without finding a single Nascent Soul-stage beast.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Qin Sang went even deeper, finally landing on a mountaintop.  He saw before him a boundless forest teeming with dense wood spirit energy.</p><p>"A good place," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The wood spirit energy here was sufficient to sustain a major battle.</p><p>He circled the forest, made some preparations, and began searching its perimeter.</p><p>Further north, Qin Sang stopped after a short distance, frowning at what lay ahead. After a moment's contemplation, he changed course to the left.</p><p>Continuing deeper might quickly lead to his target, but according to rumors Qin Sang had heard, the deepest parts of the Vile Origin harbored not only ferocious beasts, but also unpredictable, ghostly creatures, far more terrifying than the beasts.</p><p>These specters roamed the depths of the Vile Origin, rarely venturing out, and were seldom seen.  Encountering them supposedly meant terrible danger; nobody wanted to face them.</p><p>Some said they were malevolent ghosts from the underworld, even associating the legends of hell from Daoist scriptures with the Vile Origin.</p><p>Much of the talk about these specters was hearsay.  Unaware of their abilities, Qin Sang naturally preferred to avoid them.</p><p>Using the forest as a center, he steadily widened his search.  Finally, he found his target near a stream!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang released his aura, the stream erupted in a massive splash.  A silver light, carrying an overwhelmingly ferocious momentum, shot towards him.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly saw clearly: the silver light was a strange beast resembling a small calf, with antlers and nine fleshy lumps along its spine.</p><p>The monstrous bull sensed fresh flesh, its eyes greedy, its mouth watering.</p><p>"Mid-stage Nascent Soul!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>Typically, late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators here had to dedicate some attention to resisting the erosion of Heaven and Earth, and even then would carefully consider engaging a mid-stage Nascent Soul beast.</p><p>Qin Sang had no such reservations.  He immediately used Thunder Escape, vanishing into the distance.</p><p>The bull, of course, would not let its prey escape and pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Lightning and silver light raced, causing a commotion in the surroundings. Qin Sang controlled his speed, toying with the bull.</p><p>Before long, the forest was in sight.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed, the ground trembling violently. He glanced back, his eyes filled with killing intent, and his body instantly transformed.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A tree-man, as tall as ancient trees, rose from the ground. Compared to it, the bull seemed somewhat small.</p><p>The bull sensed the threat, let out a low roar, and swelled up as well, becoming a mountain-sized bull.  Its head lowered, it charged fiercely at Qin Sang.</p><p>As long as the wood spirit energy was sufficient, Qin Sang dared to confront late-stage Nascent Soul experts.  Even before recovering his full cultivation, he could slay Li Hou; a monstrous bull was nothing.</p><p>'Whizz!'</p><p>Sword light appeared, shrouding the forest in night.  Stars hung high, witnessing the clash between the two.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly, at its leisure, perched on a sword star, acting as a lookout to prevent attracting other beasts or specters.</p><p>'Dong! Dong! Dong!'</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang, not to be outdone, charged forward, sprinting towards the bull, determined to face it head-on.</p><p>At the very moment of impact, the bull roared, its brow flashing.  A silver vortex rapidly expanded, instantly engulfing the heavens and earth, intending to devour everything – only to hit empty space.</p><p>Qin Sang had vanished, reappearing from behind the bull, emerging from an ancient tree. He grabbed the bull's long tail and swung it violently.</p><p>The bull lurched to the side, flung far away, smashing a nearby stone peak in two.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The bull burst from the rubble, roaring like thunder. But a brilliant starlight descended from the sky, striking it squarely on the head, sending it flying backward again, landing on its back.</p><p>As it struggled to rise, a shadow enveloped it.  A withered hand, imbued with strange force, pressed down on its chest and abdomen.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The bull desperately dodged the vital points, its silver light erupting, bursting through the ground to escape.  When it emerged from another part of the earth, its chest and abdomen were covered in blood.</p><p>Having lost the first strike, it was already injured.</p>
