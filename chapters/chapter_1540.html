<h1></h1><p>As they rewatched the image of the ferocious beast displaying its might, everyone instinctively held their breath.</p><p>The image abruptly stopped when the purple lightning appeared.</p><p>"I wonder who is stronger, the Grand Elder or this ferocious beast!"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist exhaled a turbid breath from his chest and sighed with emotion. With a reminiscent look, he asked, "How long has it been since we last saw the Grand Elder take action?"</p><p>"Since the Mid-Year Dharma Assembly that year, when the Grand Elder's sword suppressed all the Buddhas, who has dared to act presumptuously in front of the Grand Elder? In this world, how many are worthy of the Grand Elder's personal intervention?"</p><p>A nearby Daoist, whose hair and beard were all white and who looked to be the oldest among them, stroked his beard and smiled, sharing in the glory.</p><p>"I was still young at that time and not qualified to participate in the Dharma Assembly. It remains a regret to this day," the female Daoist priest, who had originally intended to sit in meditation, chimed in upon hearing this.</p><p>Mentioning their Grand Elder, who was no weaker than the mysterious ferocious beast, diluted the oppressive atmosphere brought about by the beast.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist looked at the purple-robed elder and said, "Now it seems that the ferocious beast is merely naturally frenzied, but its combat power is in no way inferior, and its awareness of danger is extremely acute. It's very difficult to lure it into a trap. The Sword Jade Thunder Resonance Formation and the Vajra Demon-Subduing Formation, two grand formations specialized in trapping and killing, cannot suppress the ferocious beast. In the storm belt, the combat power of us cultivators will be limited. The ferocious beast can come and go as it pleases. With just the few of us, it's difficult to achieve effective results."</p><p>The purple-robed elder frowned, remaining silent.</p><p>Seeing this, the long-bearded Daoist inquired, "If it's inconvenient for the Grand Elder to take action, why not request the Grand Elder to issue a decree and gather the strength of all the sects to jointly hunt the ferocious beast?"</p><p>In fact, the Eight Views Temple had enough influence within the Daoist sects.</p><p>The problem was that they were not dealing with the same ferocious beast.</p><p>No one knew how strong the next ferocious beast they lured would be, or whether there was a limit to the barrier of the cultivation world.</p><p>If they lured in a beast at the late stage of Soul Transformation or even more terrifying, everyone would be doomed, without even the chance to escape into the cultivation world.</p><p>Through the purple handkerchief, they could activate the mysterious ancient restriction on the small island, which could instantly teleport people back near the island. However, the purple handkerchief had a limited capacity for people, and the few of them were already at the limit.</p><p>For other sects, as long as the barrier of the cultivation world didn't collapse, they wouldn't need to worry about the storm belt.</p><p>The greatest benefit of hunting ferocious beasts might be obtaining spiritual materials from their flesh and bones.</p><p>Ferocious beasts grew in the chaotic storm belt, where spiritual energy was in turmoil. No one knew what mutations they had undergone, and they might be useless to cultivators.</p><p>If the sects united, the share they would receive would be even smaller, with the Eight Views Temple taking the lion's share.</p><p>Under these circumstances, only the Grand Elder could persuade the various sects to take the risk.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked over.</p><p>The purple-robed elder picked up the crystal.</p><p>The current Temple Master of the Eight Views Temple, who always acted decisively and swiftly, unusually hesitated for a moment before saying, "The Grand Elder is not in the temple at this time."</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>The Grand Elder was a supreme figure in the world. It was normal for him to leave the Eight Views Temple and roam the mortal realm, and there was no need to inform them, his juniors.</p><p>But judging by the Temple Master's expression, it seemed it was not that simple.</p><p>"After that upheaval a hundred years ago, the Grand Elder first went to the Dewdrop Chan Temple, and then disappeared without a trace."</p><p>The purple-robed elder's tone was solemn.</p><p>The pressure he had faced over the years was unimaginable.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, their expressions serious.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist whispered, "The message-transmitting sword from before..."</p><p>The purple-robed elder glanced at his uneasy fellow disciples, his expression softening, and he chuckled, "It was indeed the Grand Elder, but it wasn't sent to the temple. A disciple stationed in the Immortal Mountains overseas received it."</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and they all gave the elder condemning looks.</p><p>They never expected that the dignified Temple Master would deliberately try to scare them.</p><p>However, they were not truly relieved.</p><p>The Grand Elder had been missing for a hundred years, which was unprecedented. His recent appearance was only to hastily send a message-transmitting sword to the overseas base.</p><p>He had been held back by something for over a hundred years, without even the time to send a message.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist recalled what the Temple Master had just said, "Wait, the Grand Elder specifically went to the Dewdrop Chan Temple before leaving. Could it be that the Sage Huiguang also..."</p><p>"It's possible, but it's not appropriate to inquire of the Dewdrop Chan Temple."</p><p>The purple-robed elder looked around at everyone. "To the outside world, we will still claim that the Grand Elder is in seclusion. We will do our best to gather information about the ferocious beasts and wait for the Grand Elder to return before making a decision."</p><p>...</p><p>When the ferocious beast achieved a great victory, Qinsang had already fled far away.</p><p>He didn't see the final result, but he could make a rough judgment.</p><p>He just didn't know if the Eight Views Temple had suffered any losses in this battle.</p><p>Daring to hunt Soul Transformation stage ferocious beasts, even if the Eight Views Temple didn't have a Soul Transformation stage Ancestor, its strength was probably no less than that of the Profound Sky Palace at its peak. It was a colossal entity anywhere.</p><p>"Zhongzhou is not only prosperous and has complete inheritances, but its understanding of this world far surpasses other places. In the North Sea and the Canglang Sea, I have never heard of hunting ferocious beasts in the storm."</p><p>Qinsang felt that he had come to the right place, finally able to lift a corner of this world's mystery.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to contact the Eight Views Temple.</p><p>Firstly, the timing was not right.</p><p>Secondly, his cultivation was still shallow. His priority was to find the Buddhist bone relics and improve his realm. Other information could be gathered slowly, step by step.</p><p>His thoughts surging, Qinsang continued to fly, finally exiting the storm belt and arriving at Zhongzhou!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Inside and outside the barrier were two completely different worlds.</p><p>"It doesn't look much different from the North Sea!"</p><p>After traveling thousands of miles, Qinsang finally arrived. He hovered above the sea, speaking to himself in a relaxed tone, "I wonder where Liuli is now."</p><p>He hadn't expected to shake off the ferocious beast so easily. If he had known, he would have agreed on a closer location.</p><p>Qinsang looked back.</p><p>Having learned his lesson in the North Sea, he concealed his aura and slowly flew south. Soon, he left the area affected by the storm belt, and the sea gradually became calm.</p><p>The salty sea breeze blew.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly emerged for some air, landing on Qinsang's shoulder. Its wings opened and closed, seemingly enjoying itself, but it was actually helping Qinsang stay alert to his surroundings.</p><p>As he traveled, Qinsang passed several small islands.</p><p>Due to the unpredictable weather nearby, the islands were not suitable for habitation, but there were obvious traces of human activity. Qinsang thought he was lucky not to have landed in a desolate sea area.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qinsang finally saw signs of human life on an island, although they were all mortals.</p><p>From the mortals, he learned about the most prosperous large island nearby. Qinsang rushed over without stopping, and sure enough, he found some cultivators on the island.</p><p>Qinsang used some simple techniques to inquire about many things, gaining a general understanding of the situation and forces in the nearby sea area.</p><p>However, these low-level cultivators had limited horizons. Qinsang still needed to find a large force or a Golden Core stage cultivator to learn the information he wanted.</p><p>The sea area near the storm belt was very barren.</p><p>Qinsang needed to continue south, to a place called White Raven Mountain.</p><p>White Raven Mountain referred to a city on an island.</p><p>Because the city was more famous than the island, the island's name was forgotten.</p><p>White Raven Mountain had the largest cultivator market within a thousand miles, and it was said that Golden Core Supremacies often appeared there. The city lord was extremely mysterious, appearing and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Having clarified the direction, Qinsang set off immediately.</p><p>Although he was only disguised as a Golden Core stage cultivator, no one dared to provoke him. He traveled smoothly, and soon after, he saw an island protruding from the sea.</p><p>This island was comparable in size to Green Sheep Island.</p><p>The docks were filled with sails, and the crowds were bustling, a scene of prosperity.</p><p>Having not seen such a scene for a long time, Qinsang paused for a while, then walked towards White Raven Mountain, strolling leisurely, but his speed was deceptively fast.</p><p>Some mortals vaguely saw a figure in a green robe pass by. They rubbed their eyes, but there was nothing there, thinking they had seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p><p>Before long, Qinsang appeared at the gate of White Raven Mountain City.</p><p>At this time, an old man hurriedly walked out of the city gate. He looked old, but he was full of energy. He was a cultivator at the late stage of Foundation Establishment. Sensing the Golden Core aura released by Qinsang, he smiled and bowed respectfully, "Senior, your presence brings great honor to our humble city! I am here by the city lord's order, stationed at the city gate. If you have any instructions, Senior, I can handle them for you."</p><p>Qinsang glanced at him, threw him a bag of spirit stones, and said淡淡ly, "Take me to the best cave dwelling in the city."</p><p>He planned to rest properly for a while.</p><p>The old man squeezed the pouch. Seeing that Qinsang was generous, his smile grew even brighter. "The best cave dwellings in the market are three, and one of them happens to be vacant. Senior, please follow me!"</p><p>The old man bowed and led the way, with Qinsang following behind.</p><p>Seeing that Qinsang was purely walking and looking around with great interest, the old man did not dare to rush him. He knowingly and appropriately introduced the local customs and practices near White Raven Mountain.</p><p>While speaking, the two arrived at the cultivator market.</p><p>The market was built on the top of the mountain.</p><p>On one side was the city lord's mansion, and the cave dwellings on the other side were reserved for outsiders.</p><p>The old man's status in the city was clearly not low. The cultivators they encountered along the way treated him with great respect. He was at least a steward of the city lord's mansion.</p><p>Qinsang was a little curious. Why was such a person sent to guard the gate?</p><p>The closer they got to the cave dwelling, the more serene the environment became.</p><p>Qinsang made no attempt to hide his gaze, looking in the direction of the city lord's mansion, pondering inwardly. He did not sense the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>White Raven Mountain was not worthy of a Nascent Soul stage dojo.</p><p>At this time, the old man, seeing that there was no one around, slowed down and asked in a low voice, "Dare I ask if Senior is from the Northern Barrens?"</p><p>"Northern Barrens?"</p><p>Qinsang immediately recalled the fragmented words in the jade slip.</p><p>The Northern Barrens referred to the vast area located north of the Zhongzhou cultivation world. Many years had passed, and it was still called by this name, indicating that the customs of Zhongzhou had not changed much.</p><p>This island was not far from the Northern Barrens. He had not deviated from his direction.</p><p>"Why do you ask?"</p><p>Qinsang narrowed his eyes slightly, feigning anger, and stared coldly at the old man.</p><p>The old man felt his whole body tighten, his heart chilling. He quickly said, "Senior, please don't misunderstand. I have no intention of prying into your affairs. In recent years, many experts like you, Senior, have been attracted by the rumors of ferocious beasts appearing in the storm, traveling thousands of miles from the Northern Barrens. Because of this, the city lord specifically ordered me to guard the city gate, to prevent any ignorant people from offending you, Senior."</p><p>Ferocious beast rumors!</p><p>In recent years!</p><p>Qinsang keenly noticed the key points in these words and snorted, "Why can't this old man come from the Western Desert?"</p><p>The Western Desert was similar to the Northern Barrens.</p><p>The Buddhist bone relics, and the place where he and Liuli agreed to meet, were in the Western Desert.</p><p>The old man smiled apologetically, "Senior, you jest. Legend has it that the Western Desert is the westernmost extreme of the world, and the edge of the extreme west is also an endless storm. To see ferocious beasts, why bother taking the risk of traveling all the way here?"</p><p>Qinsang nodded, appearing as if he couldn't be bothered to argue with him, and said淡淡ly, "This old man has been in secluded cultivation for many years, and I have only recently emerged. I have traveled to this vicinity. Why have I never heard of any ferocious beasts in the storm belt before?"</p><p>The old man suddenly understood, "I was presumptuous! To be honest, ferocious beasts have only appeared in recent years. I don't know which senior saw them first, causing widespread panic. There are rumors that the ferocious beasts' lair has always been nearby, but they were afraid of the world's barrier, cowering and not daring to show themselves. Now that the ferocious beasts are causing trouble, it means that the barrier is about to collapse, unable to suppress them, and the world will... will face doomsday..."</p><p>Speaking of doomsday, the old man's tone could not hide his fear. This was a fear stemming from his instincts.</p><p>The storm, the barrier, the cultivation world, these were the inherent cognitions he had had since birth, and they had existed for countless years.</p><p>Now, they might be broken, ushering in a drastic change.</p><p>These words, however, brought Qinsang a lot of information.</p><p>So he had misunderstood before!</p><p>Based on his experience in the storm belt, the ferocious beasts' lair was definitely not near the cultivation world, but rather, they wandered from an unknown place.</p><p>Ferocious beasts had only appeared in recent years.</p><p>No wonder Xiaoxiang Zi didn't mention them at all on the sea chart.</p><p>Qinsang smiled bitterly to himself. He and Liuli had chosen a very "good" time to set off, just in time to encounter such a thing. Fortunately, they were lucky, encountering only two ferocious beasts along the way, both of which they managed to escape.</p><p>It could also be that the upheaval had just begun, and there were not many ferocious beasts wandering outside.</p><p>How could he return to the North Sea in the future?</p><p>He didn't believe he would always be so lucky.</p><p>"Fleeing, or being attracted by something? What happened in the depths of the storm belt?"</p><p>Qinsang pondered in silence, his mind racing through countless thoughts.</p><p>In his understanding, the biggest upheaval in the past hundred years was the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace, which was unheard of.</p><p>Was there any connection between them?</p><p>Qinsang couldn't be sure. His understanding of the cultivation world was still too limited.</p><p>Zhongzhou had numerous Immortal Sects, and they might know the reason.</p><p>The old man observed his expression. Seeing that Qinsang remained silent for a long time, he said to himself, "If Senior is curious, you must not go looking for ferocious beasts yourself. Ferocious beasts are the most terrifying things in the world. They move like thunder, can swallow the sun and moon, and destroy everything. Legend has it that a Nascent Soul stage Great Expert once perished in the mouth of a ferocious beast, with no power to resist. Now, the storm belt has become a forbidden zone. Senior, you must not test the limits!"</p><p>The old man racked his brains, trying his best to describe the terror of the ferocious beasts.</p><p>Qinsang knew very well that this rumor was not false.</p><p>If a Nascent Soul cultivator were to be arrogant and encounter a ferocious beast head-on, they would surely die.</p><p>"If Senior is truly curious about ferocious beasts, I have a good method," the old man paused, "My city lord was fortunate enough to obtain an Image Fluorite Stone, on which a segment of a ferocious beast's image is imprinted. Rest assured, Senior, the source is absolutely reliable."</p><p>Qinsang glanced at him and directly threw him another bag of spirit stones.</p><p>The old man weighed it, his face blooming with a smile. He gently rubbed his thumb and forefinger, casting a spell. From the city lord's mansion, a black shadow soared into the air. It was a black eagle.</p><p>The black eagle held a crystal in its beak, flapped its wings, and landed on the old man's shoulder, cocking its head to observe Qinsang.</p><p>Inside the Image Fluorite Stone, an image was looping.</p><p>It was a skeletal bird with its entire skeleton exposed, without any flesh or blood. In its hollow eye sockets were two scarlet dots, flashing through the storm in an instant.</p>
