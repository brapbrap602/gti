<h1>Chapter 1335: The Sacred Beast's True Feather</h1><p>Avoiding the red foxes, Qin Sang moved to his right.  He soon found a shattered illusionary formation ahead, sensing an intense sharpness that intensified as he approached.  He was still some distance from the sword marks.</p><p>The air throbbed with crisscrossing sword energy, a howling gale forming a veritable sword domain – extremely dangerous, making further advance impossible. Qin Sang had no doubt that if he carelessly entered the domain, he'd be instantly killed.</p><p>He observed the sword energy, testing it.  Finding that it didn't target anything outside the formation, he devised a plan. His gaze swept around before his Qianjun Ring flashed, producing a small triangular blue flag.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned many methods for refining magical artifacts and treasures from the Xuling Sect's texts. Some were of low quality but had peculiar uses. He had refined several of these useful items, the blue flag being one.</p><p>The flag was only palm-sized.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed it up, and quickly performed several hand seals.  A ripple, faint as a mirage, appeared, and the flag vanished.</p><p>The next moment, a fluctuation appeared in the void, and a water qilin leapt out, walking on the waves, its horns sharp and imposing.</p><p>The water qilin was entirely blue, composed of water.  Its eyes flashed with ferocious light, emitting a low growl. It seemed incredibly violent, though it possessed no true intelligence, being merely a phantom beast conjured by the flag.</p><p>While not strong, it had one advantage: as long as the water remained, it could regenerate at will, useful for luring unintelligent insects and beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the water qilin, glanced towards the forest, and retreated.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The water qilin, imposing and majestic, paced back and forth, occasionally roaring towards the sky.</p><p>After waiting, Qin Sang surprisingly found the forest silent.  He realized the shattered formation had limited the red foxes' sensory range.</p><p>He considered this, then retreated a short distance, raised his ebony sword, and sent a sword energy blast towards the forest.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Several towering trees were cut in half, collapsing with a thunderous crash.</p><p>Such a loud noise would undoubtedly alert the foxes.</p><p>That thought barely crossed Qin Sang's mind when several red streaks appeared in his vision, shooting from the forest with incredible speed.</p><p>Astonishing speed!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Even with his cultivation, he couldn't clearly see the foxes' forms; they were faster than his Thunder Escape technique!</p><p>If he were discovered, escape would be impossible.</p><p>Even more alarmingly, the startled foxes let out piercing cries, and a rustling filled the entire forest. Red shapes surged from the depths.</p><p>These seemingly cute foxes were now ferocious, their killing intent piercing the heavens.</p><p>"Good thing I was careful, or those little things would've shredded me."</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, immediately glancing at the water qilin.</p><p>The foxes, upon emerging and encountering the qilin, their eyes blazing red, went into a frenzy, pouncing amidst their screams.</p><p>As the foxes closed in on the water qilin...</p><p>The sword energy floating in the void seemed stimulated, suddenly glowing brightly and emitting a buzzing sound; an astounding burst of sword intent erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was shaken by the sword intent. Before he could see clearly, the foxes' bodies were severed, falling to the ground before dissipating into mist.  More foxes continued their attack, only to meet the same fate.</p><p>He sensed a strange power brewing within the forest after the foxes' deaths.</p><p>Sure enough, these foxes were inexhaustible, the formation continuously generating new ones.  The brief lull was his opportunity.</p><p>The sword energy was expended, and the blue flag destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from hiding, transforming into a streak of lightning as he dashed through the forest, flitting between ancient trees.</p><p>Mist swirled around him, but he dared not look, focusing all his attention on his Thunder Escape technique. He burst from the forest; as he left, he caught a glimpse of a red shadow, newly formed.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, his heart having been in his throat the whole time. He had succeeded.</p><p>The red foxes played amongst themselves, and the forest returned to its quietude.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, glanced back, then looked towards the stone hall ahead.  The Nanming Lihuo was inside.</p><p>A sword scar ran through the stone hall. The impact of the sword energy had expanded, thankfully without completely destroying the hall; the entrance remained intact.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed the distressed thoughts of the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>"It's finally back to normal."</p><p>Qin Sang reassured the butterfly, then summoned his Nascent Soul puppet and walked towards the stone hall.</p><p>Stepping inside, a wave of heat washed over him.</p><p>"This aura…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. It was the Nanming Lihuo!</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo was sealed deep within a hidden passage. Previously, one had to open the passage to sense its aura; now, it was affecting the area outside.</p><p>"The Xianjing's revival is affecting the Nanming Lihuo.  Hopefully, nothing unexpected happens,"</p><p>Qin Sang prayed silently, quickly walking towards the passage's entrance and activating the inscription on the floor tile.</p><p>The passage opened.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>An astonishingly powerful demonic fire aura, pent up within the passage, finally broke free and erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, dodging as a fiery dragon burst forth, narrowly missing him before exploding in mid-air.</p><p>After the blast subsided, Qin Sang looked down at the passage.</p><p>"If it's just a demonic fire eruption, it shouldn't affect its subjugation. Regardless, I need to take a look…"</p><p>After a moment's thought, he sent his Nascent Soul puppet ahead to absorb the initial impact, while deploying the Eighteen Demon Banners and donning his demonic fire armor.</p><p>With these layers of protection and his robust physique,</p><p>Qin Sang felt somewhat reassured.  He prepared the artifact he'd crafted for subduing the demonic fire and stepped into the passage.</p><p>The Nanming Lihuo's aura continued to emanate, thankfully not exceeding his cultivation limit. Even so, Qin Sang felt the intense heat, sweating profusely, his true essence depleting rapidly.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the end of the passage and saw the Nanming Lihuo's core, his heart sinking.</p><p>It was no longer just a ball of flame; it had expanded into a gigantic fireball. This wasn't an illusion created by the aura; its core had erupted!</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached, staring at the core.</p><p>Yun Youzi, when he immersed himself in the Nanming Lihuo for rebirth, made a new discovery: the Nanming Lihuo was stored in a stone chamber resembling an alchemy furnace, containing remnants of ancient restraints that could suppress it.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see thin golden threads covering the walls, emitting strange fluctuations that exerted a certain degree of control over the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>The demonic fire's eruption was clashing with these ancient restraints!</p><p>However, what captivated Qin Sang's attention most wasn't the restraints, but an intensely concentrated red light emanating from deep within the demonic fire's core.</p><p>A single feather.
