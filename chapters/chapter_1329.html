<h1>Chapter 1321: The Spirit Embryo</h1><p>Chapter 1321: The Spirit Embryo</p><p>Deep within the mountain.</p><p>The nature of the fiery energy undergoes a transformation here.</p><p>The mountain is almost transparent, revealing the flickering flames within its heart.</p><p>Strangely, these flames are blue.</p><p>They seemed to be walking through a sea of fire.  The ice amulet could no longer block the fire poison, so Qin Sang activated the Fire Lotus Seed, forming a fiery armor around his body.</p><p>The aura of demonic fire emanated, causing the blue flames to recoil.</p><p>Seeing this, Bing Han's heart leaped with joy; the demonic fire's deterrence on the flames was even stronger than she had anticipated.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw the Fire Jade.</p><p>This was the heart of the inner mountain, a small space where the fiery energy was thick as paste, like a pool of blue spring water—quite peculiar.</p><p>However, the water in this spring was incredibly pure fiery energy.</p><p>In the center of the spring, there was a blue jade stone about the size of a person's head—the Fire Jade Bing Han had mentioned.</p><p>The Fire Jade was flat and round, floating on the surface of the spring, constantly tempered by the flames.</p><p>Its surface rose and fell rhythmically; the fluctuations Qin Sang had sensed from outside were emanating from it. It appeared very soft.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a shadowy square cauldron around the Fire Jade, perfectly encompassing it.</p><p>The cauldron was clearly not naturally formed.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and indeed found a spirit formation nearby; the cauldron was a manifestation of the formation's power.</p><p>“This Spirit-Nurturing Formation was personally laid down by our ancestor. It serves two purposes: to absorb the fiery energy from the underground veins, accelerating the Fire Spirit's gestation, and secondly, to suppress and subdue the Fire Spirit. But this Fire Spirit is too unique; it cannot be suppressed by the formation…”</p><p>Bing Han said as she walked forward.</p><p>She pointed a finger at the void, lightly touching it; the cauldron trembled slightly.</p><p>The Fire Spirit immediately reacted.</p><p>The spring churned, the underground fiery veins shifted, waves surged, and the inner mountain shook, like the roar of the Fire Spirit.</p><p>This was the fluctuation Qin Sang had sensed outside; here, it was even stronger, with fiery energy assaulting them from all directions.</p><p>Bing Han immediately withdrew her hand, and the Fire Spirit calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Fire Jade and asked, “How confident are you, Daoist Friend? If we found a similar Fire Spirit elsewhere, could we use this method to refine a spirit treasure?”</p><p>Bing Han didn’t hide anything, explaining in detail: “We dare not be certain until the spirit treasure is formed! Even if Daoist Friend finds a Fire Spirit, it would be difficult to replicate this.  The unique terrain of the inner mountain, combined with the various arrangements made by our ancestor, are what gave birth to this special Fire Spirit.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in disappointment.</p><p>The Xu Ling Sect had been planning this since the founding ancestor, a very long time; he couldn't wait that long.</p><p>Instead of using this method, he should focus on refining techniques to ensure the safe integration of Yun Youzi's true spirit into the ebony sword and hope for its transformation.</p><p>“Once Daoist Friend Xiang recovers, we'll begin. During this time, Qin Daoist Friend should study the refining techniques in this jade slip.  If any unforeseen circumstances arise during the refinement process, we will need the assistance of both of you.”</p><p>Bing Han produced a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade slip and smiled, “So, even if I hadn't asked, I still get to learn refining techniques. I'm quite fortunate this time.”</p><p>Bing Han said seriously, “These refining techniques are only a fraction of our sect's collection. After the matter is settled, I will make all the classics available to Daoist Friend; you will surely feel your journey was worthwhile then.”</p><p>After inspecting the Fire Jade, the two flew out of the mountain pass.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the Yan Huo Pavilion to study the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>After a cursory first reading, Qin Sang felt a sudden enlightenment. He sighed inwardly, realizing the vast difference between his solitary exploration and the accumulated knowledge of generations.</p><p>He had started learning refining techniques from the Xu Ling Sect's Golden Core cultivator’s notes. After arriving at Cang Lang Sea, although he collected related texts, they were not systematic and it was difficult to obtain the core techniques treasured by other sects.</p><p>When encountering problems, Qin Sang could only rely on himself, using his cultivation and powerful demonic fire to achieve some success.  Seeing the contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang realized how far he still was from a master refiner.</p><p>Bing Han had given specific instructions for no one to disturb him.</p><p>For the next few days, Qin Sang devoted himself to the jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip opened up a wider world for Qin Sang, solving many problems and captivating him. In just a few days, Qin Sang discovered several flaws in his previous plan to subdue the Nan Ming Li Fire.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang was still unsatisfied, eager to immediately explore the Xu Ling Sect's scripture repository.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Qin Sang, immersed in the world of refining, was awakened by a restriction.</p><p>Bing Han and Xiang Qing were waiting outside.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the Yan Huo Pavilion, exchanged a few words with them, and then they headed towards the mountaintop together.</p><p>They returned to the inner mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing stood on either side of the spring, while Bing Han flew above the cauldron.</p><p>Three people exchanged a glance, sat cross-legged, and closed their eyes.</p><p>They remained motionless.</p><p>Fire Spring was silent, only the Fire Jade gently pulsating.</p><p>After some time, Bing Han abruptly opened her eyes, gazing at the Fire Jade. Her fingers moved with incredible speed, weaving hand seals that flowed towards the cauldron like water.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing also moved simultaneously.</p><p>They had a prearranged plan and acted independently without communication.</p><p>A Fire Lotus Seed flew from Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the spirit array.  A strand of demonic fire separated from the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>These demonic flames, subdued by the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," were docile in Qin Sang's presence, resembling a wisp of black silk as they gently settled upon the spirit array.</p><p>Soundlessly, the demonic fire merged with the array, spreading towards the cauldron along the inscribed runes.</p><p>This process demanded extreme precision; otherwise, a clash between the demonic fire and the array would undo all their efforts.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xiang Qing extended his hands towards the array.  Qingyang demonic fire emanated from his body, flowing towards his hands, mirroring Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Any Qingyang Sect disciple present would recognize that Xiang Qing's Qingyang demonic fire had changed after fusing with the Ancestor Saint Fire.</p><p>The two types of spiritual flames occupied opposite halves of the spirit array.</p><p>The instant the flames neared the cauldron, they simultaneously stopped, looking towards Bing Han.</p><p>The next moment, Bing Han completed her final hand seal, pressed her hand against the cauldron, and gently tapped it.</p><p>*Tap!*</p><p>The faint sound marked the beginning of a transformation.</p><p>The Fire Spirit, sensing unease, instantly counterattacked.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>The surrounding fire veins were activated by the Fire Spirit, surging towards them, creating powerful waves that shook the earth!</p><p>Bing Han trembled slightly, but the impact was minimal, as Qin Sang and Xiang Qing blocked the brunt of the force.</p><p>Unheeding the external turmoil, she kept her palm pressed against the cauldron, using it as a furnace to refine the Fire Jade!</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing multitasked, repelling the fire's power while fully channeling their spiritual flames.  The two flames converged beneath the cauldron, burning fiercely, their power unmistakable.</p><p>The cauldron had become a fiery furnace.</p>
