<h1>Chapter 767: Purple Crystal</h1><p>Chapter 767: Purple Crystal</p><p>Ahead lay a deep pit, resembling a small lake.</p><p>However, instead of water, it was filled with a thick purple mist forming a purple ‘lake’, even extending above ground level.</p><p>Even more peculiar was a large whirlpool at the lake’s center.  The purple mist continuously flowed into it, and the object attracting the Fat Silkworm lay at the bottom.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the lake's edge, his brow furrowed as he stared at the center.</p><p>The poisonous mist in the lake was incredibly dense, like real water. The Fat Silkworm had already exerted itself bringing him here and dared not take a single step into the lake.</p><p>Even if there were treasures within, it wouldn't dare enter.  A single wave, and both he and the Fat Silkworm would be lost.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm hung its head, clearly aware of this. The alluring treasure was within reach, yet unattainable.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing something amiss, suddenly looked up, his gaze fixed on the sky across the lake.  He slowly retreated, then circled the lake, silently approaching the other side.</p><p>Only then did he realize that the far side of the lake was at the base of a cliff.</p><p>Qin Sang hid himself, hardly daring to breathe.  On the cliff, numerous agile figures were crouched, and he could even see their cold, dark eyes through the purple mist.</p><p>These were ferocious beasts!</p><p>Each was about the size of a mastiff, similar in build, except for the pair of wings sprouting from their ribs.</p><p>They clung to the cliff upside down, their limbs gripping tightly, shoulders hunched, tails tucked in, wings spread like fans, thin as cicada wings, a mere membrane tightly clinging to their bodies.  Their eyes were fixed on the lake, seemingly awaiting something.</p><p>Even these creatures, inhabitants of the purple mist wasteland, dared not enter the lake, indicating the danger within.</p><p>So many beasts here!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He hid in a crevice, stifling his breath, observing the beasts above, lost in thought.</p><p>Judging by the beasts' posture, a treasure of interest to them seemed to be emerging from the lake’s center—almost certainly the same thing attracting the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>In other words, there was no need to dive into the lake; obtaining the treasure could be done by waiting.</p><p>However, what kind of treasure was it? How much commotion would its emergence cause? How could it be obtained? These were all unknown.</p><p>What concerned Qin Sang most was the beasts' strength.</p><p>A group of beasts guarding the area without making a sound clearly indicated the treasure’s vital importance to them; they wouldn't easily relinquish it.</p><p>The number of beasts was considerable, covering the visible cliff face.</p><p>If only these were present, the odds of snatching the treasure were high.</p><p>He vaguely sensed that these beasts were slightly stronger than the Purple Star Eagle. With his superior speed, escaping after obtaining the treasure seemed plausible.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't dare approach too closely.  He hadn't seen a leader and wasn't sure how many were up there.</p><p>“Let's wait and see.”</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait a while, observing what would happen at the lake.</p><p>Of course, his time was limited. If nothing changed at the lake for a long time, he would have to leave and attend to other matters, returning later for another attempt.</p><p>Qin Sang released the two-headed… and he and the beast hid in the shadows, waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated, leaving ample time for his search for the spiritual fire and the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>Suddenly, the Fat Silkworm raised its upper body, its eyes burning with eagerness.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred; his gaze shifted to the lake.</p><p>Moments later, the whirlpool in the lake’s center showed unusual fluctuations. Deep within the whirlpool, a purple light seemed to be spiraling upwards, erupting from within.</p><p>Simultaneously, the beasts on the cliff stirred, raising their heads in unison, staring at the purple light with excitement, mirroring the Fat Silkworm's reaction.</p><p>The purple light's true form became clear: a crystal-like object. This crystal was an arm’s length long, a crystalline pillar, one end perfectly formed, the other with a clear break.</p><p>Pure and flawless, it emitted a dazzling purple glow.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm and the beasts both desired this purple crystal!</p><p>“Could this purple crystal be the most refined crystallization of the accumulated poisonous mist?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, somewhat surprised. He had expected poisonous fruit at the lake bottom, not this unprecedented purple crystal.</p><p>The center of the whirlpool was the calmest area. Qin Sang and the beasts watched as the crystal was drawn into the whirlpool, yet strangely ascended rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that despite their excitement, none of the beasts dared to jump down.</p><p>As the crystal rose higher, nearing the surface…</p><p>With a sudden ‘click’, a crack appeared in the purple crystal as a purple mist surged against it.  Fragments fell into the mist, swirling and disappearing.</p><p>The crystal was unexpectedly fragile!</p><p>At that moment, the beasts on the cliff face moved.</p><p>‘Swish… swish… swish…’</p><p>The beasts launched themselves from the cliff, their fleshy wings unfolding as they glided down. One beast, significantly larger than the others with noticeably stronger wings, was clearly the leader.  It led the charge, diving towards the center of the small lake.</p><p>The other beasts followed, but as they reached the lake's edge, they suddenly flapped their wings, sharply ascending. They seemed wary of the lake's vortex. Only the leader plunged directly into the lake's heart.</p><p>Another impact struck the crystal; the crack widened, and a smaller piece broke off.  This fragment, even lighter, shot upwards, riddled with tiny cracks, appearing ready to disintegrate.</p><p>The leader let out a low roar, opening its mouth to unleash a burst of purple flames.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The flames struck the crystal.  The crystal shattered, exploding into crystalline fragments that scattered.</p><p>Some smaller pieces dissipated in the purple mist, but the larger fragments successfully escaped. The beasts, gliding into the area, immediately began vying for the crystals.</p><p>Their scramble was surprisingly ordered.  The stronger beasts claimed the larger fragments.  The weaker ones dared not compete, only snatching the smallest pieces, while the leader swallowed the largest one.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a pattern. The crystal must be highly toxic, both attracting and repelling the beasts.</p><p>Having assessed the beasts’ strengths, he felt confident of stealing some crystals.  The leader was powerful, but not a fully transformed demon; its speed was moderate, though its wings granted agility.</p><p>Some beasts, having secured their crystals, flew off to their nests to refine them.  The leader, however, remained, continuing to acquire more crystals for its kin.  Otherwise, before the crystals could escape the vortex, they would dissipate into the mist, lost to all.</p><p>The next appearance of the crystals was uncertain; Qin Sang wouldn't wait. He decided to act immediately and seize the remaining fragments.</p><p>Fei Can, exerting its full strength, helped the two-headed… (The original text uses obscure terms for the creature.  We will avoid attempting a direct translation that wouldn't be meaningful in English.) …to emerge from the crevice.  It created several illusions, launching them at the beasts, instantly diverting their attention.</p>
