<h1>Chapter 1114: The Mysterious Stone Slate</h1><p>"Recently, the Abyss of Sin has gone silent, and it's related to the Purple Palace. The Divine Palace of Sin and the Purple Palace not only share the same origin for their immortal formations, but the cultivators of the Abyss of Sin can directly enter the Purple Palace through the demonic cave at the entrance of the inner hall..."</p><p>Qin Sang learned more secrets from Qing Jun.</p><p>Only then did he understand why there was a confrontation of spiritual formations at the edge of the demonic cave.</p><p>The cultivators of the Abyss of Sin could actually enter the Purple Palace through the demonic cave. During this treasure hunt, both sides were wary of each other, engaging in schemes and even fighting several battles on the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful for his vigilance; otherwise, he might have fallen right into the Abyss of Sin's trap.</p><p>Qing Jun's tone shifted as she sneered, "It's laughable how some think the Abyss of Sin is running out of steam and that they're safe, secretly stirring up trouble. The internal strife within the Pure Yang Sect has their fingerprints all over it. Seeing the new sect leader's unstable foundation, they tried to split the Pure Yang Sect. Little do they know, I've always felt something was off about the Abyss of Sin. Previously, it seemed like a back-and-forth, but the Abyss of Sin might not have been attacking at full strength. When they will strike again remains unknown. For now, you don't need to worry and can focus on cultivating in Peach Blossom Valley. Of course, once the war reignites, you can't stay hidden forever. You cultivate the Sword Scripture of Slaughter, excelling in combat, and will thrive on the battlefield..."</p><p>"I am also a cultivator of the Cold Domain. If needed, I will certainly do my part!"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke solemnly, not shirking responsibility.</p><p>He calculated in his heart that by the time the Abyss of Sin mobilized their forces, he would at least have regained his late-stage Golden Core cultivation. With his array of divine abilities, as long as he didn't face a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Abyss of Sin alone, he would have few rivals.</p><p>Disguised as an elder of the Yuan Shen Sect, with his senior sister helping to cover for him, he wasn't worried about being exposed by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The rare peace in the cultivation world was a precious opportunity to focus on cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>If the Abyss of Sin moved a bit slower, he might even achieve Nascent Soul formation by then.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something he had been pondering and asked, "Senior Sister, is the Azure Phoenix puppet still with you? Could I take a look?"</p><p>He had been cultivating his physical body, and now his "Heavenly Demon Refinement" had reached the late stage of the third layer. It was only a matter of time before he reached the peak of the third layer.</p><p>From Senior Qing Zhu, he had learned that strengthening his physical body and divine sense might aid in forming a Nascent Soul. This had planted the idea in Qin Sang's mind. If possible, he wanted to break through to the fourth layer of "Heavenly Demon Refinement" before attempting Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>However, there was always a lingering concern.</p><p>The technique Qin Sang cultivated involved visualizing the Azure Phoenix puppet crafted by Qing Jun. Its divine essence couldn't compare to that of a true Azure Phoenix. Although he could manage to cultivate, his foundation was unstable, and Qin Sang wasn't sure how far he could go.</p><p>According to the technique's description, breaking through to the fourth layer required a crucial Heavenly Demon manifestation.</p><p>Merely visualizing the Azure Phoenix puppet, he wasn't sure if he could comprehend the true Azure Phoenix manifestation.</p><p>Qing Jun had once mentioned that she had seen a real Azure Phoenix and felt its aura, which was why the Azure Phoenix puppet was so lifelike, imbued with the true divine essence of the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang finished speaking, he saw the tea mist in front of Qing Jun ripple. From the coalescing mist, an Azure Phoenix spread its wings and flew out.</p><p>Its phoenix cry was clear and melodious.</p><p>The wooden hut was limited in space, so the Azure Phoenix puppet didn't reveal its true size.</p><p>Even so, its form was breathtakingly beautiful. Its phoenix wings shed divine light as it flew around above their heads, its voice tinged with joy, as if it were alive.</p><p>"It probably still remembers you..."</p><p>Qing Jun's gaze softened as she looked at the Azure Phoenix, speaking softly.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a weight on his shoulder as the Azure Phoenix landed on him, comfortably preening its feathers, as if greeting an old friend without any hint of unfamiliarity.</p><p>From the Azure Phoenix, Qin Sang actually sensed a hint of danger.</p><p>It was clear that the Azure Phoenix puppet wasn't just a beautiful facade. Its master's cultivation had grown significantly, and its strength had also improved.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the Azure Phoenix closely.</p><p>Disappointingly, the transformed Azure Phoenix puppet's divine essence wasn't much different from before.</p><p>"I was fortunate to see the true form of the Azure Phoenix, but it wasn't the actual divine beastâ€”just a fleeting image. Although the Azure Phoenix left a deep impression on me, in that brief moment, the image I could remember was far from the true divine essence of the divine beast. When crafting the Azure Phoenix puppet, I added many imagined elements..."</p><p>Qing Jun called the Azure Phoenix puppet back, indicating she couldn't help further.</p><p>"Senior Sister, where did you see that image? Is it still there?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked urgently, seeking Qing Jun's guidance.</p><p>Qing Jun recalled, "The phantom of the Azure Phoenix came from a mysterious stone slate discovered in a secret realm. When the slate appeared, I wasn't the only one there. At the time, my cultivation was too low to participate in the struggle for it. The slate likely ended up in the hands of a demon king."</p><p>"A demon king?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected it to involve a demon king. "A demon king from the Demon Domain?"</p><p>"Indeed. To demon beasts, a slate containing the phantom of an Azure Phoenix is no less than a treasure. As for what exactly is within the slate, only that demon king knows..."</p><p>Qing Jun nodded.</p><p>The two chatted for a while longer before Qing Jun hinted it was time for Qin Sang to leave. She mentioned she would be traveling soon and wasn't sure when she'd return, instructing Qin Sang to take good care of the peach grove.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press further and left the wooden hut, returning to his cave.</p><p>"The mysterious stone slate is in the hands of a demon king from the Demon Domain... That's quite troublesome."</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on his meditation mat, feeling a headache coming on.</p><p>Although the demon race had formed an alliance with humans and contributed to the fight against the Abyss of Sin, they remained wary and even hostile toward humans.</p><p>During the alliance meetings, demon kings rarely showed up.</p><p>Most of the time, communication between the two sides was relayed through the Spirit Taming Sect.</p><p>How could such an important treasure be easily lent to humans for observation?</p><p>"Given the current situation, Senior Sister wouldn't risk offending a demon king. Senior Yunyouzi frequently travels to the Demon Domain and must have connections with some demons. Perhaps he knows the temperament of that demon king..."</p><p>Qin Sang considered the possibilities.</p><p>"There's no rush. The Star Essence Baptism has an ideal location at the Peak of Heaven. Breaking through to the fourth layer might not require observing the slate. For now, I should focus on reaching the peak of the third layer in 'Heavenly Demon Refinement.'"</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind.</p><p>As an elder of the Yuan Shen Sect, he didn't need to rush to subdue the Demon Flame Sect. He could focus solely on cultivation. Before seclusion, he would commission various merchant guilds and factions to acquire the necessary items.</p><p>He would take as many cultivation-enhancing pills as he could get.</p><p>Then there were the demonic fruits like Tyrant Blood Fruit, Green Mist Root, and Scorpion Venom Grass, which aided in "Heavenly Demon Refinement."</p><p>Qin Sang had learned about the effects of these demonic fruits from the ancient texts of the demon race in the Demon Sea.</p><p>The demon race in the Cold Domain lived in isolation, and their heritage was likely less complete than that of the demons in the Demon Sea. They might not fully understand the effects of those demonic fruits, leaving some overlooked.</p><p>Additionally, there were the spiritual medicines needed to feed the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede, which shouldn't be hard to obtain in the Cold Domain.</p><p>...</p><p>All in all, he needed quite a few things, each of considerable value.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had brought back many demon cores and bones from the Canglang Sea. Selling them would provide enough funds to cover his expenses.</p>
