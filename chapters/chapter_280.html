<h1>Chapter 273: Return</h1><p>Excluding the Nascent Soul cultivators, twenty-seven individuals had entered the Ancient
    Ruins. Now, only sixteen had gathered by the stone monument.</p><p>Of course, it was possible that some people, such
    as Scattered Immortal Yunqiong, had given up halfway through the trial and left the Ancient Ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang
    arrived and, upon finding Mu Yifeng and Yu Daiyue present, he approached them.</p><p>"Fellow-uncle Che and the
    others still haven't come out?" Qin Sang asked in a low voice.</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head, his gaze fixated on
    the west with a solemn expression. "After the change, Venerable Sikong ordered us to leave and wait, while he
    personally went to meet Fellow-uncle Che and the others."</p><p>The collapse accelerated, with some spatial rifts
    merging to form an enormous one, over a thousand feet wide. It resembled the gaping maw of a monster, ready to
    devour any intruder.</p><p>With space being torn apart, it presented an extremely bizarre sight. Some lava rivers
    suddenly stopped flowing, while in other areas, vast tracts of land and mountains were inverted, defying all logic.
    This phenomenon became more severe the closer one got to the four celestial peaks.</p><p>Yet, the Nascent Soul
    cultivators had still not emerged. Elder Dique and Daoist Xuanyu were unlikely to appear, but the other three had
    also not shown themselves.</p><p>Surely, all five Golden Cores couldn't have perished? Qin Sang thought to himself,
    gazing at the apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Losing five Golden Cores would be a major blow to the various sects. Even the
    Eight Righteous Paths had limited Nascent Soul cultivators in their ranks.</p><p>The Green Luan Sect had been dealt
    the worst blow of all, as their Sect Master was among those missing.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, the lava
    and Fire Spirit Beasts invaded in full force, drawing closer and closer to the stone monument. The Golden Core
    cultivators remained out of sight, and the others began to grow restless and anxious.</p><p>Just then, someone
    suddenly exclaimed, "Look there!" and pointed to the distance.</p><p>Upon straining their eyes, they saw three small
    lights flickering between the spatial rifts. The space was far from stable and was still in constant flux, with some
    rifts expanding or even drifting about.</p><p>The lights were moving cautiously among them, managing to avoid being
    devoured by the spatial rifts just in the nick of time. Though they were too far away to make out any details, it
    was still a thrilling sight.</p><p>Finally, the lights managed to emerge from the spatial rifts, only to be met by a
    horde of raging Fire Spirit Beasts.</p><p>Despite their numbers, the Fire Spirit Beasts were still relatively sparse
    compared to the vast expanse of the ruins. For Nascent Soul cultivators, they weren't a significant problem and were
    easily brushed aside.</p><p>Before long, three figures materialized before the others, revealing themselves as Che
    Yutao and his companions.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue and Elder Du Yi looked fine, but Che Yutao appeared
    disheveled. There was a large gash on his left arm, where a substantial chunk of flesh had been torn away.</p><p>Che
    Yutao ignored his wound for now, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. His expression darkened, and he demanded,
    "Where's Daoist Xuanyu?"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator's aura descended upon the others, leaving them breathless
    and feeling like mountains were pressing down on them. Horrified, a Foundation Establishment latter-stage cultivator
    forced out the words, "Reporting to Fellow-uncle Che, after the change, we have not seen the two Masters. They...
    they seem not to have come out yet..."</p><p>Che Yutao and his companions' faces changed drastically upon hearing
    this. They exchanged glances, and Venerable Sikong Muyue said in a low voice, "When the change began, I sent them
    out, then returned to meet you. I didn't encounter the two Fellow Daoists."</p><p>Elder Du Yi looked around and
    asked in surprise, "Fellow Daoist Xuanyu and I ascended the celestial peak and became trapped after encountering
    danger. That's understandable, but why hasn't Elder Dique come out yet? Could he also be trapped in a
    restriction?"</p><p>By this time, the Fire Spirit Beasts were getting closer and closer. Lava was even starting to
    seep out of the ground near the stone monument.</p><p>Venerable Sikong Muyue shook her head and said to Che Yutao,
    "This is not a place to stay for long. We should leave first. I think the collapse is beginning to slow down. This
    place should not be completely destroyed. The two Fellow Daoists are protected by fate, and as long as they can find
    a hiding place, they should be fine. We can think about a way to rescue them after the ruins stabilize."</p><p>Che
    Yutao remained silent, his expression dark and inscrutable.</p><p>Elder Du Yi spoke up, "Venerable Sikong's
    suggestion is sound. We must first ensure our own safety before we can spare resources to rescue our Fellow Daoists.
    Failing that, we can send someone back to Hanging Pass for reinforcements."</p><p>Seeing that the two were of the
    same mind, Che Yutao had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Before entering the stone monument, Qin Sang
    glanced back before returning his gaze forward. He stepped into the monument.</p><p>The world spun, and when his
    vision returned, he found himself standing on the rubble outside the ruins. Aside from Scattered Immortal Yunqiong,
    three people had also given up on the trial and were waiting there.</p><p>In total, six Foundation Establishment
    cultivators had lost their lives within the ruins.</p><p>Their disheveled appearances naturally startled Scattered
    Immortal Yunqiong and the others. After hearing what had happened, they were filled with relief.</p><p>Che Yutao and
    his companions conferred briefly, then planted themselves by the entrance, showing no intention of leaving.</p><p>
    Qin Sang and the others waited for orders. They didn't dare to leave without permission, so they sat on the ground
    nearby. Some of them regulated their breathing, and others treated their injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang looked inward at
    the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm in his Qi Sea. Despite his impatience, he didn't use his Divine
    Understanding to probe it. Instead, he let it recuperate on its own.</p><p>Qin Sang then laid several restrictions
    in his Qi Sea, completely hiding the aura of the Charm.</p><p>Just as Old Man Dique said, the Charm didn't belong to
    anyone, so as long as no one forcibly searched his Qi Sea, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm wouldn't be
    exposed.</p><p>After sealing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Charm, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes. He saw Che
    Yutao and the other two standing in a triangular formation near the entrance. They would occasionally release their
    Martial Arts to stimulate the appearance of the Black Hole and observe the changes within.</p><p>The stone tablet
    inside the Black Hole was initially calm, but it suddenly trembled violently. The Black Hole emitted a large amount
    of black light, as if it had transformed into a black sun.</p><p>The three Core Formation Cultivators quickly
    released their Martial Arts, creating a large restriction to block the black light. They wanted to prevent the
    strange phenomenon from attracting Cloud Beasts.</p><p>This continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, the Black Hole
    disappeared completely. The black light dispersed, and the stone tablet appeared, standing in the middle of the
    circular rubble. Everyone was astonished.</p><p>Though the stone tablet was covered in cracks, it was still intact.
    It had managed to avoid being crushed.</p><p>They waited for another three days. It remained calm, and there were no
    abnormalities.</p><p>It seemed that the ancient ruins were stable on the inside.</p><p>Sikong Muyue cautiously
    walked up to the stone tablet and placed her palm on it. Spirit Power surged from her palm, as if she was
    investigating it. After a long while, she said, "The Testing Grounds have been destroyed. That's why the entrance
    has been exposed."</p><p>Che Yutao and the others discussed it and summoned everyone. They wanted to re-enter the
    ancient ruins.</p><p>No one knew what dangers lurked within the ancient ruins. Qin Sang and the others were
    reluctant, but they had no choice but to obey. They formed a massive Nine Radiance Star River Formation, with the
    three Gold Core Cultivators leading it. As a group, they entered the Black Hole and walked towards the stone
    tablet.</p><p>After they entered, it was just as Sikong Muyue expected. They were not sent into the Testing Grounds
    but entered the ruins directly.</p><p>Excluding Nascent Soul cultivators, twenty-seven people entered the Ancient
    Cultivator's Ruins, but now only sixteen were gathered by the stone tablet.</p><p>Of course, some, like Recluse Yun
    Qiong, might have given up midway through the trial and left the ruins.</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived, he saw that Mu
    Yifeng and Yu Daiyue were both there, so he approached them.</p><p>"Are Martial Uncle Che and the others still
    inside?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked softly.</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head, staring gravely westward. "After the anomaly
    occurred, Senior Sikong ordered us to leave and wait, while he personally went to retrieve Martial Uncle Che and the
    others."</p><p>The collapse intensified. Some spatial rifts joined together, forming a gigantic crack thousands of
    feet long, resembling a monstrous maw, waiting to devour all intruders.</p><p>Space was torn apart, presenting an
    incredibly bizarre scene.</p><p>Some lava rivers suddenly stopped flowing. In other places, the earth and mountains
    were upside down, defying logic. This phenomenon worsened the closer one got to the four celestial peaks.</p><p>
    However, the Nascent Soul cultivators were still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Elder Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu were
    impossible to have appeared, but the other three hadn't shown themselves either.</p><p>Could all five Nascent Soul
    cultivators have perished?</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the apocalyptic scene, muttering to himself.</p><p>The loss of
    five Nascent Soul cultivators at once would be a significant blow to the major sects. Even the eight righteous sects
    had a limited number of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The Azure Firmament Sect suffered the most, as their sect
    leader was among them.</p><p>After waiting for a while longer, with the lava and fire spirits encroaching closer and
    closer to the stone tablet, and still no sign of the Nascent Soul cultivators, everyone began to grow restless.</p>
<p>Just then, someone suddenly exclaimed in delight, pointing into the distance. "Look over there!"</p><p>Looking in
    that direction, they saw three points of light appear among the spatial rifts. Space was far from stable, constantly
    fluctuating. Some rifts were expanding, while others were even drifting.</p><p>The points of light maneuvered
    precariously among them, narrowly avoiding being swallowed by the spatial rifts. Although they were extremely far
    away and indistinct, it was still a breathtaking sight.</p><p>Finally, the points of light emerged from the spatial
    rifts, only to be greeted by a swarm of raging fire spirits.</p><p>However, although numerous, the fire spirits
    appeared sparse compared to the vastness of the ruins. They weren't a major problem for Nascent Soul cultivators and
    were easily shaken off.</p><p>Soon, three figures materialized before everyone. It was Che Yutao and the other
    two.</p><p>Sikong Mu Yue and Du Yi seemed alright, but Che Yutao looked much more disheveled. His left arm had a
    noticeable wound, a large chunk of flesh seemingly torn away.</p><p>Che Yutao didn't immediately attend to his
    wound. His gaze swept over everyone, his face darkening abruptly. He demanded angrily, "Where is Daoist Xuan
    Yu?"</p><p>The pressure of a Nascent Soul cultivator's aura descended upon them, making it difficult to breathe.
    They felt as if a mountain was bearing down on them, utterly shocked. A cultivator at the late Core Formation stage
    managed to speak with difficulty, "Reporting to Martial Uncle Che, after the anomaly occurred, we haven't seen the
    two seniors. They… seem to still be inside…"</p><p>Che Yutao and the other two changed color upon hearing this. They
    exchanged glances, and Sikong Mu Yue said solemnly, "When the anomaly began, I sent them out and then returned to
    retrieve you. I didn't encounter the two Daoists."</p><p>Du Yi turned to look around, puzzled. "Daoist Xuan Yu and
    we ascended the celestial peaks. It's understandable if they were trapped by danger. But why hasn't Daoist Di Que
    escaped? Could he have been confined by some restriction as well?"</p><p>By now, the fire spirits were getting
    closer and closer. Lava was even seeping out of the ground near the stone tablet.</p><p>Sikong Mu Yue shook her
    head, looking at Che Yutao. "This is no place to linger. We'd best retreat first. I've noticed the collapse starting
    to slow down. This ruin shouldn't be completely destroyed. The two Daoists are fortunate souls. As long as they find
    a place to hide, they should be fine. We can try to rescue them after the ruins stabilize, which won't be too
    late."</p><p>Che Yutao's face was grim, and he seemed lost in thought.</p><p>Du Yi spoke impatiently, "Daoist
    Sikong's suggestion is good. We must ensure our own safety first before we have the capacity to rescue the two
    Daoists. If all else fails, we can send someone back to Skull-Hanging Pass for help."</p><p>Seeing that both of them
    agreed, Che Yutao had no choice but to nod in agreement.</p><p>Before entering the stone tablet, Qin Sang glanced
    back, then withdrew his gaze and stepped inside.</p><p>After a dizzying spell, his vision cleared. He was standing
    on the rubble outside the ruins. Besides Recluse Yun Qiong, three others had also given up on the trial and were
    waiting there.</p><p>In total, six Core Formation cultivators had perished within the ruins.</p><p>Seeing their
    disheveled state, Recluse Yun Qiong and the others were naturally astonished. After learning what had happened
    inside, expressions of relief appeared on their faces.</p><p>Che Yutao and the other two discussed amongst
    themselves through voice transmission for a moment, then stood by the entrance, showing no intention of leaving.</p>
<p>Qin Sang and the others, without receiving orders, dared not leave on their own. They also sat down nearby, some
    meditating, some tending to their wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang looked within, glancing at the Nine Dragons Chariot
    Talisman in his Qi sea. Suppressing his eagerness, he didn't probe the talisman with his divine sense but let it
    recover on its own.</p><p>He then placed several restrictions within his Qi sea, completely sealing the talisman's
    aura to prevent any leakage.</p><p>Just as Elder Di Que had said, the talisman was ownerless. As long as no one
    forcibly searched his Qi sea, there was no need to worry about the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman being exposed.</p>
<p>Having sealed the talisman, Qin Sang quietly opened his eyes. He saw Che Yutao and the other two standing in a
    triangular formation around the entrance, occasionally activating the black hole to observe the changes within.</p>
<p>The stele inside the black hole was initially calm, but then it suddenly trembled violently. The black hole erupted
    with dark light, resembling a black sun.</p><p>The three Foundation Establishment cultivators quickly reacted,
    setting up a large restriction to conceal the dark light and prevent the phenomenon from attracting cloud
    beasts.</p><p>This continued for three days.</p><p>Finally, the black hole vanished completely. The dark light
    dissipated, and the stele was clearly revealed, standing amidst the rubble, much to everyone's surprise.</p><p>
    Although covered in cracks, the stele remained intact, luckily not shattered.</p><p>After another three days of
    quiet, the stele showed no further anomalies.</p><p>It seemed that the ancient cultivator's legacy site had
    stabilized.</p><p>Si Kong Muyue cautiously approached the stele, touching it with her palm. Spiritual power surged
    from her hand, seemingly probing the stele. After a long while, she said, "The trial space has been destroyed, which
    is why the entrance is exposed."</p><p>Che Yutao and the others discussed briefly, then summoned everyone. They
    intended to re-enter the ancient cultivator's legacy site.</p><p>At this point, no one knew what dangers lurked
    within the legacy site. Although reluctant, Qin Sang and the others had no choice but to obey. They formed a large
    Nine Radiances Star River Formation, led by the three Foundation Establishment cultivators, and entered the stele
    together.</p><p>Inside, as Si Kong Muyue had predicted, they were not separated into trial spaces but directly
    entered the legacy site.</p>
