<h1>Chapter 1925: Demon Extermination</h1><p>Qin Sang explained the stakes.</p><p>Taiyi naturally had no objections; on the contrary, he felt more at ease. The more cautious the Lord was, the more he cared.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang perused all the ancient texts Taiyi had collected.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of them recorded the Dharma name or identity of the Thunder Altar's master. They only knew this person originated from the Penglai Island Water Division and likely wasn't the Lord.</p><p>Within the texts, Qin Sang also discovered some details overlooked by Taiyi, giving rise to new ideas.</p><p>He suspected these Thunder Altars might not be the sacrificial altars he'd envisioned. Their usefulness to him remained uncertain. The key lay in the main altar, which he hoped was still intact.</p><p>By this time, Xiao Wu and the others had also arrived. Taiyi settled them in the hall, entertaining them with spiritual fruits from the mountain, homemade Hundred Flowers Wine, and preserved fruits.</p><p>Cultivating in seclusion in the mountains, Taiyi had honed these crafts in his spare time, and his skills were quite impressive. Xiao Wu and the others ate with relish.</p><p>Inside the quiet chamber,</p><p>Qin Sang and Taiyi sat facing each other, legs crossed.</p><p>At Qin Sang's request, Taiyi elaborated on his understanding of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman.</p><p>Among the talismans Qin Sang had previously selected to cultivate, neither the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman nor the Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman were included. He needed to thoroughly comprehend them before attempting cultivation.</p><p>Taiyi himself was the embodiment of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman; no one in the world understood it better than him.</p><p>In a few concise sentences, he pointed directly to the essence.</p><p>Taiyi still regarded Lord Qin Sang as a Body Integration stage grandmaster.  He couldn't fathom that the Lord had never cultivated this talisman before. He assumed Qin Sang was using him to discern the differences between himself and an ordinary Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, ensuring absolute certainty.</p><p>With Qin Sang's cultivation level, he quickly gained a profound understanding of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman. Building on this foundation, he then began to comprehend the Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman.</p><p>Having finished his explanation, Taiyi quietly awaited Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>At that moment, the forms of the two talismans appeared in Qin Sang's mind, repeatedly deconstructing and recombining.</p><p>Indeed, Taiyi could not be equated with an ordinary Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman.</p><p>Redesigning the talisman's form without damaging its spiritual essence, instead allowing it to undergo a complete transformation, required more than just comprehending the two talismans. The brushstrokes for drawing the talisman, the method for channeling spiritual energy—all required careful consideration. This posed a significant challenge for Qin Sang.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang ceased his deductions and said to Taiyi, "From now on, follow me."</p><p>The process of refinement required Taiyi's full cooperation. Qin Sang intended to take Taiyi with him. Judging by his previous behavior, he wouldn't refuse.</p><p>Taiyi was overjoyed at first, then a flicker of hesitation crossed his face as if remembering something.</p><p>"Do you have any unfinished business?" Qin Sang saw through his thoughts.</p><p>"Reporting to Lord, this junior has no family or relatives, so there shouldn't be anything to hold me back. However, I have been cultivating here for many years and have received help from some fellow Daoists, such as Sect Master Su. When demonic beasts attack the surrounding area, I also help them slay demons and eliminate evil. Shamefully, Sect Master Su and others regard this junior as a reclusive righteous cultivator. Now, demonic beasts are rampant, and it's said powerful demons frequently appear in the west. I fear that after my departure, with demonic beasts running amok, Sect Master Su and the others will struggle alone. Also, the mountain folk around here…"</p><p>As Taiyi spoke, his gaze penetrated the cave dwelling, sweeping across the mountains, revealing a trace of melancholy.</p><p>Mountain folk also lived here.</p><p>Taiyi had awakened here, cultivated here, and developed a deep affection for this land and its people.</p><p>"This is nothing difficult."</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and immediately summoned Luo Hou and Zhu Que. "Let them accompany you down the mountain and clear out the powerful demonic beasts in the vicinity. This should be enough to deter the wicked and ensure at least a century of peace. As long as there's no major upheaval, the mountain spirits and earth deities will be sufficient to protect the mountain folk. Go!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang handed the Earth Travelling Boat to Luo Hou and waved his hand.</p><p>Luo Hou obeyed Qin Sang without question. Zhu Que, thrilled at the rare opportunity for freedom, followed joyfully.</p><p>The three demons flew out of the mountain.</p><p>"Thank you, two Demon Generals, for your righteous assistance."</p><p>Taiyi knew that the Demon Generals under the Lord were extraordinary, and he was deeply respectful.</p><p>Zhu Que looked back, making sure they were far from Qin Sang, then immediately puffed up, indignantly saying, "Bah! Who's a Demon General! I am the ancient divine beast Zhu Que! That surnamed Qin... even that old Daoist Qing Feng has relied on me to save his life multiple times! I only see a bit of potential in him, granting him the privilege to serve me. You dare to address me so disrespectfully!"</p><p>Taiyi was dumbfounded. He couldn't imagine anyone daring to speak to the Lord with such irreverence, nor could he tell if Zhu Que was telling the truth. He could only stammer in agreement.</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>Zhu Que extended a wing, slapping Taiyi's shoulder carelessly.</p><p>"I heard you're a Talisman Demon? I've never seen a talisman become a demon before. Quickly transform back to your original form and let me see!"</p><p>Saying this, Zhu Que stretched out her beak towards Taiyi's forehead, a flicker of crimson fire appearing, intending to force Taiyi to reveal his true form.</p><p>Taiyi was terrified. This Zhu Que's aura was clearly similar to his, yet he sensed an immense threat.</p><p>Fortunately, Luo Hou intervened, "Tell us, how many powerful demons are there nearby? Don't keep the Lord waiting too long."</p><p>Taiyi felt as though he had just escaped death, hurriedly hiding behind Luo Hou, keeping his distance from the unruly Zhu Que.</p><p>"I don't know much about the mortal world. Let's go to the Kong He Sect first and visit Sect Master Su. Incidentally, we can gather the righteous forces and destroy the demon lairs in one fell swoop!"</p><p>As they spoke, they flew north.</p><p>Arriving at the Kong He Sect, Sect Master Su welcomed them into the sect, puzzled by Taiyi's sudden visit.  He then heard Taiyi introduce, "This is Fellow Daoist Luo, a Soul Formation stage expert."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>Sect Master Su, just about to sit, abruptly stood up, utterly shocked.</p><p>That Daoist's mount was a Soul Formation expert. What cultivation level was he himself?</p><p>"And me! And me!"</p><p>Zhu Que hopped onto Taiyi's shoulder, eager for an introduction, staring at Sect Master Su's face, wanting to see his shocked expression.</p><p>Taiyi's face was troubled. He knew he couldn't reveal Zhu Que's identity to outsiders, so he could only say, "This is Lord Shen Que."</p><p>Could it be another Soul Formation expert?</p><p>No, Taiyi's address was even more respectful!</p><p>Sect Master Su stared blankly at Zhu Que, his mind reeling, unable to comprehend it.</p><p>Zhu Que was satisfied and whistled triumphantly.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng travels the world, experiencing mortal life, and doesn't wish his identity to be known. Sect Master Su, remember this," Taiyi cautioned.</p><p>"I understand! I understand! I will definitely keep it a secret!"</p><p>Sect Master Su finally regained his composure, nodding repeatedly. "May I ask the reason for your visit today?"</p><p>"This old one will be following Daoist Qing Feng and leaving this place," Taiyi said.</p><p>"What? Fellow Daoist is leaving?"</p><p>Sect Master Su was shocked again.</p><p>Demons were encroaching upon the Duzhi Kingdom, but Sect Master Su had never felt anxious precisely because of the presence of Taiyi, this great expert.</p><p>"Indeed! Don't worry, Sect Master Su. I've expressed my intentions to Daoist Qing Feng. Before I leave, I will help you slay demons and eliminate evil. Daoist Qing Feng has also agreed and sent Fellow Daoist Luo and Lord Shen Que to assist. Time is of the essence. Sect Master Su, quickly contact the other fellow Daoists and determine the locations of the demon lairs…"</p><p>Previously, Taiyi had been wary of exposing his origins and reluctant to act. Now, following Qin Sang, he no longer had this concern.</p><p>Sect Master Su, worthy of being a sect leader, recovered from his shock and decisively said, "Please wait a moment. I'll immediately send messages to the fellow Daoists from all sides and join forces to subdue the demons! As for the locations of the demon lairs, we've already dispatched spies…"</p><p>As he spoke, Sect Master Su was about to go out and send messages.</p><p>He had no doubts about their ability to vanquish the demons.</p><p>Over the years, the strongest demons causing trouble hadn't surpassed the Soul Formation stage. Perhaps the Soul Formation experts in the depths of the Mu Luo Mountains looked down upon them and were unwilling to descend.</p><p>Luo Hou alone was enough to sweep away the demons!</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Luo Hou stopped him. "We can't keep the Lord waiting too long. This time, only summon the experts to eliminate the powerful demons. As for the lesser demons, you'll have to find a way to deal with them yourselves."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Sect Master Su took the order and left, sending swift messages in all directions.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they left the Kong He Sect and flew west.</p><p>On the way, Sect Master Su explained the current situation to them.</p><p>"The largest demon lairs are primarily in three locations, all national capitals! Among them, the capitals of the Tang Ting Kingdom and the Miao Kingdom are mainly occupied by evil cultivators. They drive the mortals of nearby kingdoms into war, making them slaughter each other. The two sides have no real animosity; their purpose is to make mortals kill each other, aiding their cultivation of evil arts. I've personally infiltrated the battlefield. Corpses litter the ground, rivers flow red with blood. They build platforms with flesh and blood, forests of macabre trophies, turning them into a paradise for demons. It's truly horrific."</p><p>Sect Master Su sighed deeply. "The third one is furthest from us. It was originally called the Zhuo Guang Kingdom, but now it's called the Wan Ling Kingdom. I think Wan Yao Kingdom, the 'Ten Thousand Demons Kingdom,' would be more fitting. Those demons have usurped the court, wearing human clothes like monkeys, enslaving mortals, and feeding on them. They often devour entire cities, resulting in a devastating loss of life…"</p><p>He was speaking with righteous indignation when he suddenly remembered that the three beside him were all demons. He froze for a moment.</p><p>Fortunately, the three demons showed no reaction.</p><p>Luo Hou, after inquiring about the strength of both sides, mused, "The three demon lairs should be interconnected. If we attack one, the other two will quickly be alerted and flee the city. This way, we won't be able to catch them all in one net and won't achieve the desired deterrent effect."</p><p>She had been a Demon Marquis of the Gui Fang Kingdom, skilled in military strategy and formations. Compared to the great war between the Dao Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom, this was a small matter. She quickly devised a plan.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Su, Fellow Daoist Taiyi, each of you lead a group and launch surprise attacks on the capitals of the Tang Ting Kingdom and the Miao Kingdom, respectively. Don't be greedy for merit or advance recklessly. Focus on encirclement, not killing. Don't let a single one escape! After Lord Shen Que and I eliminate the demons in the Wan Ling Kingdom, we'll come to assist you…"</p><p>Arriving at the designated location, some had already arrived ahead of time, and more continued to arrive, all experts or powerful figures from nearby kingdoms.</p><p>Luo Hou manifested her human form in advance and demonstrated her strength before everyone, and none of them objected.</p><p>Speed was essential in war. They immediately split into three groups and headed straight for the three demon lairs.</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Hou stood on a mountain peak outside the capital of the Wan Ling Kingdom. Zhu Que perched on her shoulder, and behind them were a group of human cultivators.</p><p>Everyone looked down at the capital below. Demonic Qi soared into the sky within the city, and the city walls were patrolled by all sorts of demonic beasts.</p><p>"A disorderly mob!"</p><p>Contempt flashed in Luo Hou's eyes. These demon soldiers were poorly trained, their patrols haphazard. Their demonic nature made them difficult to discipline. Compared to the demon soldiers of the Gui Fang Kingdom, they were like heaven and earth.</p><p>The demon cultivators within the city were clearly only interested in playing the role of officials. They had never considered properly managing the place. The city was dilapidated, with little light at night, and the mortals inside were almost devoured.</p><p>A place like this naturally wouldn't have the aura of deities.</p><p>Glancing at the sky, Luo Hou shouted, "Attack!"</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Everyone swooped down from the mountaintop, the whistling wind instantly echoing through the capital.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>A roar erupted from within the imperial palace, bursting with purple-gold light.</p><p>Within the light, a nine-foot-tall, handsome man flew into the air.</p><p>He held two enchanting women in his arms.</p><p>He wore a purple-gold imperial crown and imperial robes, revealing his identity: the most powerful demon in the city, the self-proclaimed Demon Emperor, a late-stage Transformation expert.</p><p>"How dare you! I haven't gone looking for you, yet you dare to attack my imperial capital! Perfect, I'll capture you all at once!"</p><p>The Demon Emperor laughed wildly, pressing his hands on the heads of the women in his arms. *Bang!* Their heads exploded like watermelons.</p><p>The blood transformed into bloody arrows, shooting towards everyone.</p><p>At the same time, figures with powerful auras rose into the air from various parts of the capital, some in human form, some in beast form.</p><p>The Demon Emperor pointed ahead and roared, "Kill them all!"</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Demons, die!"</p><p>The cries of both sides resounded through the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, the sky above the capital was filled with spells and demonic light, a dazzling display of colors.</p><p>The Demon Emperor stood majestically, motionless, coldly watching his subordinates attack the enemy.</p><p>Purple profound light steamed from the imperial palace, enveloping him.</p><p>Just then, the Demon Emperor suddenly frowned, an ominous premonition arising. From the corner of his eye, he saw a yellow light shoot out from the ground. A small boat with pointed ends flew out, and a sturdy woman, built like an iron tower, appeared.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>The Demon Emperor was startled. He hadn't sensed her at all. This woman must be an extremely powerful expert!</p><p>Making a swift decision, the Demon Emperor abandoned his subordinates and fled back into the imperial palace.  The sound of a raging tide followed close behind.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>Silver-white waves appeared out of thin air in the void.</p><p>Towering waves, layer upon layer, carrying immense force, crashed down on the purple light above the imperial palace.</p><p>Among the waves, a striking red line stood out—a streak of crimson fire unleashed by Zhu Que.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, water and fire clashed, the sky filled with earthen yellow, crimson red, and silver-white, easily suppressing the purple light.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The imperial palace trembled violently as Luo Hou and Zhu Que, aboard the Earth Travelling Boat, shattered the purple profound light.</p><p>The Demon Emperor hadn't expected the imperial palace to be so fragile. He was horrified. His figure flickered, transforming into a purple-gold divine eagle, letting out an ear-splitting shriek, flapping his wings powerfully.</p><p>But the attack from behind was even faster.</p><p>The waves surged, condensing into a silver-white giant hand, slamming down on the purple-gold divine eagle.</p><p>The divine eagle plummeted as if a mountain had fallen on it.</p><p>Zhu Que seized the opportunity, transforming into a streak of crimson light, shooting towards the back of the divine eagle's head.</p><p>With Luo Hou and Zhu Que joining forces, even with the Demon Emperor's great power, his demise was only a matter of time.</p><p>Just then, more escaping lights shot out from the imperial palace.</p><p>Luo Hou snorted coldly. The waves split into several streams, striking repeatedly, leaving behind ruins.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the waves were about to suppress one of the demonic beasts, they suddenly froze.</p><p>The demonic beast, shaped like a black demonic horse, had cloud-like markings on its back. It had been in despair, but now, seeing a chance, it fled.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Zhu Que turned her head.</p><p>Luo Hou watched the demonic beast's retreating figure, hesitating. "It has the bloodline of the Ghost Cloud Steed!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>At the start of the new year, I wish everyone a happy new year. May 2024 bring happiness and prosperity to your families, and may all your wishes come true!</p>
