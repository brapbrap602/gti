<h1>Chapter 182: Capturing</h1><p>Unbeknownst to them, the body of the black tiger was able to refine two Devouring Yuan Cones, an unexpected windfall. Shopkeeper Wu also admitted that it would have been impossible to create them without the recent progress he had made in his refinement techniques.</p><p>These new Devouring Yuan Cones had similar power to the old one, but without the poisonous snake fangs, they were no longer unpredictable killers.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was very satisfied with this result.</p><p>After this, Qin Sang stayed in Wen Moon Bazaar for a few more days, attending a private gathering. The members of the gathering didn’t all attend every time. With Qin Sang included, there were only 11 people present on this occasion. Including Qin, there were three Foundation Establishment cultivators present, one being a casual cultivator, and two being members of other Immortal sects. The Qi Refinement cultivators were mostly like Shopkeeper Wu, having only been able to attain one presentable skill.</p><p>Qin Sang became acquainted with the others’ faces. After asking for Shopkeeper Wu’s opinion, he found that each of them was quite well-reputed and had no negative background. Strangely, Old Granny Jing had apparently let him in without thinking twice.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu explained, “Out of all the major or minor sects of the Cloud Expanse Swamplands, Mount Shao Hua is renowned as one of the Eight Great Orthodox Sects. Old Granny Jing perhaps felt that since you have a sect backing you, you definitely wouldn’t dare cause trouble.”</p><p>Qin Sang gave it some thought and decided that he was right. His background was clear, and could be immediately checked.</p><p>Mount Shao Hua had always been recognized as an orthodox sect. If a disciple behaved atrociously, it was possible for their sect to remain indifferent as long as the matter was cleanly dealt with. However, if the disciple damaged the sect’s reputation in the Immortal world, Old Granny Jing wouldn’t have to lift a finger. Mount Shao Hua itself would take the initiative to clean house.</p><p>In the private gathering, some attendees were seeking helpers for monster hunting or treasure hunting, while others were inquiring about treasures or magical equipment. One Foundation Establishment cultivator invited Qin Sang to join him on a monster hunting expedition in the depths of the Cloud Expanse Swamplands, which Qin Sang politely declined.</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang asked the gathered Immortals to help him find information about a depleted spiritual spring, promising them a reward. After this, he left Wen Moon Bazaar and returned to his sect to do some business. He finally saw Senior Martial Brother Wen, and like last time, asked him to inquire among his fellow sect members for any relevant information. He would pay any price.</p><p>…</p><p>Earth Collapse Hole.</p><p>The thick baleful Yin energy was still incessantly attacking the various restrictions, but the atmosphere inside Earth Collapse Hole was filled with an air of desolation and abandonment.</p><p>Qin Sang was well-acquainted with the territory. He bypassed the restrictions and entered through an unremarkable crevice in the ground, silent as could be. A single sweep of his divine consciousness revealed that the cave mansion inside Earth Collapse Hole had implemented its restrictions, indicating that someone was cultivating inside.</p><p>His goal was to collect Earthly Yin energy for corpse refining. He would rather not disturb others if possible, and so deftly concealed himself, gliding towards the most secluded corner of his memory.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang arrived in front of a rock face. On it were several fine cracks, almost indiscernible to the naked eye. Qin Sang pressed his hand on the rock, and after confirming the location, silently activated his technique, his body becoming blurred, then ‘squeezing’ through the crack to enter the cave.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the crack enlarged as it went deeper into the cave, eventually becoming wide enough for two to three people to walk through. The crack continued to go deeper underground. Having surfaced, Qin Sang didn’t hesitate for a moment and quickly descended.</p><p>The further down he went, the more concentrated and bone-chilling the baleful Yin energy became. However, he was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator after all, and was able to withstand the cold.</p><p>When he finally emerged from the baleful Yin energy, he found himself in a vacant space between the baleful and Earthly Yin energy, the realms of the two diametrically opposed chilling energies clearly separate.</p><p>After all, baleful Yin energy was merely a gathering of extreme quantities of dead energy, grievances, and Yin energy, evolving over long periods of time. In essence, it was merely a more deadly type of Yin energy. On the other hand, Earthly Yin energy was the extremely Yin and deadly energy produced by the heavens and earth themselves. The two types were vastly different, and if baleful Yin energy encountered Earthly Yin energy, it would be devoured without resistance.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the surroundings, and found a rock platform to land on. He activated his Warming Sun Pearl and several other warming magical tools, and after feeling some warmth return to his body, retrieved ten or so long-necked silver vials from his Mustard Seed Sack.</p><p>These silver vials were called Lesser Yin Magnetic Vials, a special kind of magical tool that could not be classified by grade. They contained magnetic light that would collect and pacify violent Earthly Yin energy, preventing it from destroying the vial.</p><p>Of course, Lesser Yin Magnetic Vials weren’t just used to collect Earthly Yin energy. They had many other uses as well.</p><p>Qin Sang had found the Lesser Yin Magnetic Vial refinement method on Pagoda Peak. Only one particular magnetic stone was rather difficult to find, but the other materials weren’t rare. He had bought out all the magnetic stones in the Ascending Heaven Pavilion, and asked Shopkeeper Wu to refine about ten of them, all so he could collect as much Earthly Yin energy as possible.</p><p>After returning from Earth Rift, Qin Sang had read through scripts and texts to thoroughly understand Earthly Yin energy. Only then did he discover that this deadly energy was in fact quite rare, and its birth must have been due to special circumstances. This made it even more difficult to find than the Five Elements Yin Objects.</p><p>Without preparations for some earth spirit energy, Qin Sang would have to hunt some down after entering the ancient battlefield. But where to find the energy would be another question.</p><p>Arranging the lesser Yin magnetic bottles in a row in front of him, Qin Sang reached out and grabbed one, opened the stopper, and a spiritual hand formed behind it, reaching toward the pitch black abyss below.</p><p>A wisp of earth spirit energy was grabbed by the spiritual hand and, like a living creature, struggled violently. The energy slammed against the hand and followed with a terrifying chill, invading Qin Sang’s body through the connection.</p><p>Qin Sang’s complexion changed. Experiencing the terror of earth spirit energy firsthand, he hurriedly activated the Warm Sun Pearl and other items at full power. Without hesitation, he launched attack after attack at the earth spirit energy, suppressing it with layers of restriction. The energy was finally subdued, transforming into a mass of black smoke.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still didn’t dare to come into direct contact with the earth spirit energy. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the lesser Yin magnetic bottle. Aiming the opening at the energy, he collected it into the bottle.</p><p>A silver magnetic light flashed inside. The bottle shook slightly when the energy entered but quickly calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently for a while, confirming that the lesser Yin magnetic bottle could suppress the earth spirit energy, before repeating his actions, collecting the earth spirit energy bit by bit.</p><p>Time passed slowly, and Qin Sang remained motionlessly upon the stone platform like a statue. Half a day passed before he suddenly opened his eyes and reached out to retrieve the lesser Yin magnetic bottle.</p><p>Looking into it, he saw silver magnetic light that faintly revealed a dense black smoke. Though the bottle wasn’t full, Qin Sang decided to stop collecting the energy to avoid accidents.</p><p>His expression was slightly pale, and he quickly flew up to expel the coldness from his body before returning to collect more earth spirit energy.</p><p>Ten days later, an illusory shadow suddenly flashed out from a crevice in the Ground Collapse Cave. The disciples guarding the cave were still cultivating in seclusion in their caves and didn’t notice.</p><p>Qin Sang had filled more than ten lesser Yin magnetic bottles. After his corpse refining technique became skilled, each bottle of energy could refine two to three corpse soldiers. If he didn’t refine living corpses, they would last for a long time. After all, it wasn’t easy to obtain the bodies of Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p>
