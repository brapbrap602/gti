<h1>Chapter 279: A Stunning Sword</h1><p>Yun Youzi, based on Qin Sang's conditions, selected Yu Kong as his target among the three.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yu Kong once entered the Autumn Market and safely exited its guardian formation. He understands the formation very well, an advantage others lack.  His requirements aren't stringent. After entering the formation, if you wish to continue cooperating, that's excellent. If not, Fellow Daoist Yu Kong won't force you. Of course, during the formation breaking, working together wholeheartedly is essential. There can be no selfishness. What are your thoughts, Daoist?”</p><p>The teahouse owner said expectantly.</p><p>A look of hesitation appeared on Qin Sang’s face. His gaze shifted to the owner, seemingly indecisive.</p><p>Seeing this, the owner clapped his thigh and stood up. “It was my presumption.  Please enjoy your tea, Daoist. I won't disturb your leisure.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly stood up and stopped the owner. “You misunderstand, fellow Daoist. I don't distrust you. I’ve just heard the Autumn Market's guardian formation won't reach its weakest point for over a year. It seems there’s no need to rush.”</p><p>Warmly invited by Qin Sang, the owner sat back down. “The longer the preparation, the more proficient the coordination, the higher the chance of breaking the formation. You understand this, Daoist. It's better to plan early. My teahouse happens to have a vacant upper room. You can stay here and inquire around town. You'll know if I'm telling the truth.”</p><p>That night, Qin Sang stayed at the teahouse.</p><p>The next day, after leaving the teahouse, Qin Sang pretended to stroll through West Waste Town. He vaguely sensed someone watching him, but he ignored it.</p><p>Whenever he encountered places recruiting help, he would proactively inquire. Sometimes he was politely refused, sometimes warmly invited. Qin Sang didn't rush to accept.</p><p>For two consecutive days, Qin Sang thoroughly investigated West Waste Town, putting on a good show. Then he found the owner again and asked him for an introduction.</p><p>The owner wasn't offended and personally took him to meet Yu Kong.</p><p>Yu Kong, wealthy and influential, rented a cave dwelling in West Waste Town. The dwelling was a small two-courtyard residence. Qin Sang followed the owner and met Yu Kong in the main hall.</p><p>Yu Kong was tall and thin, with a feather fan and silk scarf, possessing a calm demeanor. Dressed in brocade, he resembled a scholar more than a cultivator. He appeared to be around forty years old.</p><p>However, he had already been a Foundation Establishment cultivator thirty years ago and had entered the Autumn Market. His real age was certainly much older.</p><p>Including Yu Kong, all three were mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators. They had remained in West Waste Town, gathering people and practicing formations.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang and his companions only wanted to find the secret passage through Yu Kong and the others, not to kill and steal. Otherwise, their chances of success would be slim.</p><p>Of course, after finding the herb garden, the competition for the spiritual herbs would depend on their individual abilities.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang enter the hall, Yu Kong immediately stood up and spoke with a joyful tone, “This must be Daoist Qing Feng! The old owner has mentioned you many times.  Seeing you today, you truly possess an extraordinary presence!”</p><p>The owner smiled. “See? Have I ever lied to you?”</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen Yu Kong's portrait, and the difference in their cultivation levels was enough for him to adopt a respectful attitude.</p><p>“I am Qing Feng. Greetings, Fellow Daoist Yu! I've recently arrived and have nowhere to turn.  Fortunately, the old owner recommended me.  I’ve heard of your righteous heart, Fellow Daoist Yu, willing to lead us casual cultivators into the Autumn Market. Though my strength is meager, I’m willing to be at your command. I hope you won't find me unworthy.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's respectful words and lack of arrogance, Yu Kong nodded inwardly, smiling with satisfaction. “Daoist Qing Feng, you are too modest. I’ve merely been to the Autumn Market once and have some understanding of the guardian formation. That's why I dared to take the initiative. Breaking the formation requires all fellow Daoists to work together. How could I possibly reject you?”</p><p>After some pleasantries, the matter was settled.</p><p>After the owner left, Yu Kong led Qin Sang to the back courtyard. “Follow me, Daoist Qing Feng. The spiritual energy in this courtyard is relatively rich. You can find a room here, cultivate, and practice formations. There are also a few other fellow Daoists you should meet. Close cooperation is necessary for breaking the formation.”</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Kong released his divine sense, touching the restrictions on three rooms.</p><p>Soon, the doors of the rooms were pushed open, and four people emerged. All were early Foundation Establishment cultivators, of varying heights, but generally similar in strength.</p><p>Two sisters emerged from the first room, quite similar in appearance, but with drastically different temperaments.</p><p>“These are the Xiu sisters. They are skilled in a cooperative sword technique, the Flowing Wave Sword, which can be both firm and gentle, adaptable and powerful.”</p><p>After introducing Qin Sang to them, Yu Kong introduced them to Qin Sang.</p><p>Of the Xiu sisters, one was alluring and named Xiu Zhirui. She curiously examined Qin Sang, and seeing him look back, she covered her mouth with a smile, her almond-shaped eyes shimmering.</p><p>Another one was rather aloof, named Xiu Zhiying. She glanced at Qin Sang indifferently and then ignored him.</p><p>"This is Fellow Daoist Shangguan Lifeng. His treasured saber can cut through anything. He's quite renowned among the local itinerant cultivators," Yu Kong said, pointing to a man with a long saber in his arms who emerged from the second room.</p><p>The saber was entirely black. Although its edge wasn't facing Qin Sang, he could still sense its extreme sharpness. It was clearly no ordinary magical tool.</p><p>Within the town, magical tools could be stored inside one's body or a storage pouch.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew that Shangguan Lifeng wasn't just putting on an act. He likely practiced a profound saber technique that required constant contact with his treasured saber to achieve a state of unity between man and blade, further enhancing his saber skills.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Yu Kong was about to introduce the last person to Qin Sang when he was suddenly interrupted.</p><p>"I am Yan Wu, a practitioner of the Talisman Dao, and I dare say my skills are no less than those old fogies from the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace! Daoist Qingshan, even if Elder Yu Kong brought you, you still have to pass our test. Show us what you're capable of.  Don't drag us down later."</p><p>This man was a tall, powerfully built man with a rough appearance. He pointed at Qin Sang unceremoniously, his words blunt and unsparing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yan is a straightforward man. Please don't take offense, Daoist..."</p><p>Yu Kong tried to smooth things over, but he didn't stop Yan Wu.  He looked at Qin Sang, also waiting for him to demonstrate his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. He chuckled, and suddenly a light flashed between his eyebrows.</p><p>――――</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A dazzling sword beam shot out, its energy instantly expanding several dozen meters.</p><p>The sword flashed like a startled swan, accompanied by a faint dragon's roar. If not for the restrictive formation above the courtyard, it would have likely alarmed half of West Wasteland Town.</p><p>Then, as several shocked gazes watched, the sword energy suddenly dispersed and reformed into a sword formation.  Its power pressed down without restraint, aimed mostly at Yan Wu.</p><p>*Stagger...*</p><p>Caught off guard, Yan Wu stumbled back a few steps.</p><p>"Is my natal flying sword, coupled with this formation, sufficient?"</p>
