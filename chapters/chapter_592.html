<h1>Chapter 585: Three Lights Jade Liquor</h1><p>Qin Sang looked puzzled.</p><p>He wondered where Yi Tiannie had heard the outdated information, assuming that he needed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit to form his core, unaware that the fruit was no longer a necessity.</p><p>After entering the Violet Citadel, with a Nascent Soul cultivator nearby, Yi Tiannie was likely afraid of being detected and didn't dare to eavesdrop recklessly, thus remaining ignorant of recent events.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't offer any reminders.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, lurking close by, had already learned too many secrets. Qin Sang had decided that he would eliminate him, even if it meant forgoing the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>"Old Devil Yi, you don't know that the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid recently completed its eighth transformation. It needs at least another five hundred years to mature. Even I can't wait for it to mature to refine the Tribulation Avoidance Pill. Your lifespan is almost exhausted. You've turned to ghost cultivation and rely on evil techniques to prolong your life. How much longer can you linger? Whether you want to become a Ghost King or a Celestial Corpse King, you certainly won't live to see that day. What use is it to you?"</p><p>Yi Tiannie remained unmoved and snorted coldly.</p><p>"My affairs are none of your concern!</p><p>Since the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid still needs five hundred years to mature, even if you form your core, you only have four hundred years left.  Be smart and trade it for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>Otherwise, if you fail to form your core, everything is for naught!</p><p>Hand over the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, and I'll not only return the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, but I'll also swear a Heart Demon Oath to keep all your secrets. You killed Jiu Pao, seized his Qianjun Ring, and slaughtered my entire Kuiyin Sect.  I can let bygones be bygones.</p><p>You should know that what ghost cultivators fear most is the Heart Demon.  I seek the Great Dao; there's no need to risk my life harming you.</p><p>Otherwise, once I spread the word, how could Mount Shaohua tolerate you!"</p><p>Failing to ambush Qin Sang, Yi Tiannie tried to threaten him and propose a deal.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred upon hearing this.  He became suspicious. Yi Tiannie's tone suggested he had long known the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid wasn't mature.</p><p>Yet, he still risked his entire sect to seize it. Could there be a way to refine the immature Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid into a pill?</p><p>Could there be something else going on?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, Yun Youzi beside him suddenly exclaimed, "Three Lights Jade Liquor! There's Three Lights Jade Liquor in the Violet Citadel?"</p><p>Yun Youzi was hiding at the base of the stone wall behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Earlier, to repel the Shadow Devouring Leopard, he had secretly used his lifeblood to activate the Flawless Pearl, triggering the Demon King's Blood Restriction.  It was easy to see that his aura was extremely weak.</p><p>When the Flying Night Devil mutated, Yun Youzi had prudently taken refuge within the Demon King's Blood Restriction. He could now only activate a small portion of the blood restriction's power for protection, with no spare energy to assist Qin Sang.</p><p>If Yi Tiannie attacked him, Yun Youzi would certainly be doomed.</p><p>However, Yi Tiannie couldn't guarantee he could break through the Demon King's Blood Restriction and kill Yun Youzi in one blow. If Yun Youzi delayed him even for a moment, Qin Sang would catch up.</p><p>In Yi Tiannie's view, Qin Sang was the same kind of person as him.</p><p>Trying to threaten someone like Qin Sang with friends and family was a fool's errand; the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was certainly more important. Thus, he ignored Yun Youzi entirely and headed straight for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>Yun Youzi, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke during their confrontation.</p><p>"Old man, who are you! How do you know about the Three Lights Jade Liquor?"</p><p>Qin Sang was still wondering what "Three Lights Jade Liquor" was when he saw Yi Tiannie's expression change dramatically after Yun Youzi spoke, staring intently at him with murderous intent.</p><p>Ignoring Yi Tiannie's threat, Yun Youzi quickly explained to Qin Sang, his voice laced with barely suppressed excitement.</p><p>It was the first time Qin Sang had seen Yun Youzi so agitated.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you should know about the Three Lights Divine Water, right?"</p><p>In many myths and legends, the Three Lights Divine Water was renowned, so famous that it was practically a household name.  How could he not know about it?</p><p>Legend had it that the Three Lights Divine Water was created by immortals, who gathered the primordial light of the sun, moon, and stars and transformed it into divine water. It possessed boundless wonders, capable of neutralizing all poisons and healing all injuries, making it the ultimate healing elixir in the world.</p><p>Resurrecting the dead and regenerating flesh and bones were no exaggerations!</p><p>But legends were just legends.  The texts that mentioned the Three Lights Divine Water were all mythical stories conjured by human imagination, embellished with mystical and fantastical elements.</p><p>They were completely different from ancient texts containing cultivation techniques, spells, or recorded facts that could be verified.</p><p>These stories were meant for entertainment, not to be taken literally!</p><p>When Qin Sang read about them in Pagoda Peak, he merely treated them as interesting anecdotes, marveling at the ancients' romanticism and imagination, envisioning treasures of immortals despite never having seen one.</p><p>Yun Youzi suddenly mentioning the Three Lights Divine Water... Could it truly exist?</p><p>"Whether the Three Lights Divine Water is a figment of imagination or a true treasure of this world is unknown.</p><p>As far as I know, within the Violet Citadel, there's a supreme treasure called the Spirit Gathering Bowl, capable of imitating the Three Lights Divine Water.  It gathers the essence of heaven and earth, fuses it with the power of the Yin, Sun, and the constellations, and refines it into divine water called the Three Lights Jade Liquor.</p><p>Although the Three Lights Jade Liquor doesn't possess the miraculous effects of resurrecting the dead and regenerating flesh and bones like the Three Lights Divine Water, it contains the essence of heaven and earth. Consuming it not only rapidly nourishes the body and restores true essence, with effects no less than Ten Thousand Year Spirit Milk,</p><p>but it's also a miraculous healing medicine.  After consuming it, one can quickly recover from poisoning or severe injuries.</p><p>However, what the Violet Citadel valued most was another magical property of the Three Lights Jade Liquorâ€”it can transform heavenly materials and earthly treasures, making their medicinal properties even purer!</p><p>However, this effect requires the Spirit Gathering Bowl and a specific Immortal Restriction to work together.</p><p>This Immortal Restriction exists only in the core of the Ancient Medicine Garden, a celestial realm called the Hanging Garden Palace.  Within it grow all sorts of rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures. The lowest grade spirit herbs are no less valuable than the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>These spirit herbs grow in the Hanging Garden Palace, bathed day and night by the Immortal Restriction.  Over time, after being nurtured for a certain period, they are watered with the Three Lights Jade Liquor, helping them transform and mature ahead of time.</p><p>Once, when the Violet Citadel appeared, an ancient ruin within the inner palace was opened. It was a fragment of the Hanging Garden Palace. It's said that nearly ten types of heavenly materials and earthly treasures grew inside, causing a great battle, and were divided amongst the Nascent Soul cultivators and Great Demons present.</p><p>If Brother Qin's Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid came from the Hanging Garden Palace, it must have been retrieved then, and it must have already received sufficient refinement.</p><p>There's no need to wait another five hundred years. Watering it with the Three Lights Jade Liquor can directly transform it into the Heavenly Phantasmal Orchid, and its medicinal properties will far surpass the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid!</p><p>The Tribulation Avoidance Pill refined from the Heavenly Phantasmal Orchid can increase the pill's Nascent Soul formation rate from 20% to 30%!</p><p>However, the Spirit Gathering Bowl has long since vanished, whether it was stolen or destroyed during the Violet Citadel's calamity is unknown. So, no one has ever obtained Three Lights Jade Liquor within the Violet Citadel.</p><p>I thought the Three Lights Jade Liquor was gone forever.  Could it be that there's still some remaining within the Violet Citadel, and you found it?"</p><p>This last question was directed at Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Although it seemed lengthy, Yun Youzi and Qin Sang communicated through divine sense, quickly explaining the whole story.</p>
