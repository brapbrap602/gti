<h1>Chapter 554: Yuan Ying</h1><p>Chapter 554: Yuan Ying</p><p>Going to them directly is impossible.</p><p>Unless a way can be found to make Dongyang Bo or Chenyan voluntarily give up.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and carefully examined the Xuanwu beast seal.</p><p>The beast soul roared, still restless.</p><p>He couldn't tell what materials the beast seal was made from, and the method of sealing the beast soul was extremely exquisite, exceeding Qin Sang's knowledge.</p><p>Enduring the impact of the beast soul, Qin Sang probed his spiritual sense into the seal, finally seeing the beast soul's full appearance.</p><p>It was actually a real Xuanwu beast soul, identical to the carving on the seal!</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly shocked.  Could the beast souls in the other four seals be the same? Where did Dongyang Bo find these legendary divine beasts?</p><p>However, upon closer observation, Qin Sang discovered an anomaly in the beast soul; it certainly wasn't extracted from a real divine beast.</p><p>Using some unknown method, it was artificially refined into a peculiar ferocious soul, devoid of intelligence, possessing only pure aggression – no wonder it was so frenzied.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Xuanwu beast seal in both hands, activating the incantations to refine it.</p><p>Although the beast soul was unruly, Qin Sang, relying on the Jade Buddha, could complete the refinement within half a month at most, without delaying the treatment of Feitian Yecha.</p><p>Che Yutao was cultivating in the deep recesses of the manor, so caution must be exercised when treating Feitian Yecha.</p><p>While subduing the beast soul, Qin Sang considered whether it was possible to do something with the seal.</p><p>Patiently waiting until late at night, there was an auction tonight.</p><p>Che Yutao hadn't strictly confined him, so Qin Sang stored the seal within his body, preparing to sneak out to see Yunyouzi and ask for his advice.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang reached the door and pushed it open, his expression suddenly changed, and he turned abruptly to see a figure in the room that hadn't been there a moment before.</p><p>It was Granny Jing!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief, his face brightening.  He quickly stepped forward, bowing, "Greetings, senior. Did you just arrive at Xuanlu Pass today?"</p><p>He had thought Granny Jing was still in Jiuyong Pass, investigating the Yuan Shen Sect and Leng Yuntian.</p><p>Granny Jing still used a cane, her old womanly image the same as when they first met at the Wenyue Market.</p><p>Having already seen Granny Jing's true appearance, Qin Sang found this image strangely unsettling, wondering why she wouldn't show her true face.</p><p>Granny Jing shook her head. "I've been in Xuanlu Pass for a while, but some matters delayed me from meeting you.  Seeing Dongyang Bo unexpectedly leave his seclusion and learning that you were summoned here, I guessed something had happened."</p><p>"Indeed, something unexpected happened..."</p><p>Seeing Granny Jing, Qin Sang felt relieved, nodding repeatedly, and hastily recounted the events of the day.</p><p>Granny Jing asked Qin Sang to summon the seal, examining it in her hand.</p><p>After a moment, Granny Jing looked up. "There are five of these seals?"</p><p>"That's right," Qin Sang pointed to the adjacent room. "They have the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Gouchen seals, forming a complete set of Five Elements beast seals with mine."</p><p>"Five Elements seals, Five Elements, ferocious souls..."</p><p>Granny Jing fell into thought.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up.  "So that's it! They're going to that place!  That's why they need the Five Elements seals. Dongyang Bo has a clever plan.  It's a bit risky, but if those two work together, they might succeed."</p><p>Saying this, Granny Jing returned the seal to Qin Sang.  "Che didn't deceive you. You only need to use the seals to break the restriction; there's no danger. Besides, with two Yuan Ying cultivators protecting you, what's there to fear?"</p><p>"Two?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then realized Granny Jing was referring to Chenyan.  He exclaimed, "Miss Chenyan has actually successfully formed her Yuan Ying? Why hasn't there been any news?"</p><p>Granny Jing said, "That's something you should ask your sect's ancestor. Over a decade ago, that woman chose a barren and remote location to undergo her tribulation. Dongyang Bo also used a significant amount of spiritual materials to set up a large formation to conceal it.  If I hadn't been near your sect at the time and accidentally discovered something, no one would have known that Shaohua Mountain now has two Yuan Ying cultivators! If the news got out, the various sects of the Xiao Han domain would be in an uproar. However..."</p><p>Granny Jing's tone shifted, her voice laced with doubt.  "After discovering this, I secretly investigated, but I couldn't find out anything about this woman's background. 'Chenyan' is probably an alias. After the Ziwei Palace closed, she was suddenly brought back to Shaohua Mountain by Dongyang Bo; she must have been quite young then."</p><p>The last time the Ziwei Palace appeared was only over two hundred years ago.  She's probably not even three hundred years old now. Even with a heaven-grade spiritual root, it's extremely rare for someone so young to reach the Yuan Ying stage.  Her background must be extraordinary.”</p><p>Old Madam Jing knew nothing of Chen Yan's cultivation methods.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew that Chen Yan's ascension to Yuan Ying wasn't as easy as it seemed.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang was incredibly envious of her speed. At three hundred, he wasn't sure he'd even reach the late Golden Core stage, while Chen Yan was already a genuine Yuan Ying master.</p><p>But why would she, so young, rush to use forbidden techniques to ascend?</p><p>Learning this from Old Madam Jing calmed Qin Sang somewhat. He'd seen plenty of backstabbing and intrigue in the cultivation world; his biggest fear was being used as a pawn and discarded.</p><p>However, when Qin Sang asked for details, Old Madam Jing pleaded ignorance.  “All I know is that many Yuan Ying cultivators consider that place a sacred site of the Ziwei Palace; I've never been inside myself. You just need to follow orders when you get there. Lord Dongyang has a good reputation among righteous cultivators; he's not like those heartless demons.  With your current cultivation, what good would deceiving you do? Here…”</p><p>Old Madam Jing tossed Qin Sang a wooden bracelet and showed him how to use it.</p><p>“Before entering the inner hall, just stick with them. I've found out that Leng Yuntian will go to the inner hall; that's where we'll make our move!  Put this bracelet on the moment you enter the inner hall; it will temporarily mask your mark. If Lord Dongyang finds you, just say you accidentally stumbled into an ancient temple and were trapped by a restriction.”</p><p>Of course Old Madam Jing had a solution!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of relief, picking up the bracelet to examine it.</p><p>The craftsmanship was incredibly simple, just like the most ordinary wooden ring, with sharp edges and no ornamentation whatsoever.</p><p>Yet, it possessed a unique charm, making one marvel at Old Madam Jing's skill, so refined and natural as to be almost Daoist in its simplicity.</p><p>“Senior, how long will this bracelet last?”</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, and he looked up to ask.</p><p>“What else do you want to do?”</p><p>Old Madam Jing looked at him strangely.  “You just need to release the Blood-Soiled Divine Light; you won't be needed after that; it won't take long.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly explained, “I still need to go to the place where Senior Qingzhu fell. I don't know what the situation is there, and I'm afraid it might take too long, and the bracelet will wear off.”</p><p>If the bracelet lasted long enough, Qin Sang decided he'd risk punishment and go with Yunyouzi first to take care of his own business before rejoining Lord Dongyang.</p>
