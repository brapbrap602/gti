<h1>Chapter 1469: A Secret Meeting (4k)</h1><p>The Deer Demon King patted the restless black shark and let out a strange chuckle. "I am the Great Immortal Deer! You don’t even recognize me? Have you just recently taken human form?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The Great Immortal Deer took Qin Sang’s silence as a sign of timidity. It was common for newly ascended demon kings to act cautiously in the presence of seasoned ones. For demon cultivators, innate talent was even more crucial than for human cultivators.</p><p>Before taking human form, unless blessed by a demon king with the divine nectar of the Celestial Stream to awaken their intelligence, most demon cultivators remained in a state of ignorance, relying solely on instinct to cultivate. Unlike human cultivators, they couldn’t meticulously plan to seize opportunities.</p><p>However, some demons were fortunate enough to experience mutations in their bloodline or consume rare spiritual treasures. These lucky ones didn’t need to join sects or schemes to obtain cultivation techniques and secret arts. They could simply retreat to secluded caves, absorb the essence of heaven and earth, and cultivate their innate abilities until they achieved human form.</p><p>Such newly emerged, unknown demon kings weren’t uncommon in the demon realm.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yuan, meeting me is your good fortune. I serve under the Great Sage Heavenly Roc. If I put in a good word for you, you’ll soar to great heights—prime caves, rare treasures, immortal medicines, and even demon soldiers under your command will all be within your reach!"</p><p>The Great Immortal Deer had taken a liking to Qin Sang and wanted to recruit him. A demon king who had achieved human form without guidance must possess extraordinary talent. What was even more valuable was that this demon didn’t seem to belong to any faction.</p><p>As for whether Qin Sang was lying, the Great Immortal Deer wasn’t concerned. If there were any issues, they wouldn’t escape the Great Sage’s discerning eyes. Once brought before the Great Sage, any deception would be exposed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly flapped his wings and retreated a thousand feet in an instant, his face filled with wariness.</p><p>The Great Immortal Deer quickly understood Qin Sang’s concerns. The demon realm operated on the law of the jungle, where the weak were devoured by the strong. Qin Sang, having just awakened his intelligence, relied on instinct and feared that the Great Sage Heavenly Roc might devour him.</p><p>The Great Immortal Deer couldn’t help but laugh. "The Great Sage Heavenly Roc is a figure of immense stature. Do you think he would covet your flesh? The Great Sage is the sovereign of our demon race, with a heart as vast as the heavens and countless powerful subordinates under his command. Don’t measure the heart of a noble with the mind of a petty one!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment before saying, "I’ve heard that you’re about to go to war with the humans. It’s too dangerous. I don’t want to get involved."</p><p>"Coward!" The Great Immortal Deer’s eyes flared with anger. "For years, we’ve been confined to the demon realm while the humans slaughtered our kin, piling up blood debts! Now that the Great Sage Heavenly Roc has raised the banner, we finally have a chance to strike back, and you want to retreat? To feast on their flesh, drink their blood, devour their nascent souls, seize their caves, and enslave their descendants—wouldn’t that be satisfying?"</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang remained unmoved, the Great Immortal Deer changed his tone. "You don’t necessarily have to go to the front lines. You can assist the Great Sage from the rear. That’s what I’m doing now. If you’re worried about your safety, why not follow me for a while and see how things go?"</p><p>"Yuan truly has no interest in this. Farewell!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, turned, and flew away, disappearing into the horizon in no time.</p><p>The Great Immortal Deer didn’t give chase. Instead, he rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I offered him a chance to access secrets, and he still wasn’t tempted. It’s unlikely he’s a spy. Hmph, with my network of informants nearby, let’s see where you can run. I’ll have the other old demons keep an eye on him and observe him further. His wings are a bit unusual—I wonder what bloodline he possesses."</p><p>Human cultivators often kept spirit beasts, and it was possible that the Profound Heaven Palace had spirit beasts that had achieved human form. These spirit beasts, having been tamed, willingly served as traitors to the demon race. The demon race had suffered losses before, so they naturally remained vigilant against unknown demon kings.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang, having confirmed that the Deer Demon King wasn’t following him, slowed his pace and flew at a leisurely speed.</p><p>His earlier act was precisely to avoid being suspected as a traitor and subjected to excessive scrutiny. By deliberately interacting with nearby demon kings a few times, he could gradually build relationships. With these demon kings as witnesses, even a fabricated story could become convincing, making it easier for him to operate within the demon realm.</p><p>Over the following days, Qin Sang occasionally ventured out, diligently playing the role of a cautious, newly ascended demon king. He traveled to broaden his horizons and met several other demon kings, including the Great Immortal Deer twice.</p><p>He adhered to his principles, maintaining a low profile and concealing the lightning power in his wings to make his phoenix wings less conspicuous. He claimed to possess the bloodline of the Azure Bird.</p><p>Through repeated interactions, he gradually dispelled the suspicions of the other demon kings.</p><p>For the next half year, Qin Sang remained active in the border regions, patiently laying the groundwork. He searched for fragments of the Slaughter Sword while gathering information about the power structure within the demon realm.</p><p>...</p><p>On a vibrant, lush island teeming with life, the dense jungle echoed with the chirping of birds.</p><p>Suddenly, a small yellow spirit bird flew in from the horizon. Its eyes sparkled with intelligence, a clear sign of its awakened spirit, far surpassing the ordinary birds on the island.</p><p>The spirit bird flew high above, its eyes darting around to ensure there were no anomalies. Then, it suddenly dove down, descending rapidly into the jungle.</p><p>Once inside, the bird seemed guided by some unseen force, accurately locating an ancient tree. It extended its wing and brushed against the bark, causing a faint glow to emanate. In its mind, a series of messages appeared.</p><p>This spirit bird had grown up in the Profound Heaven Palace, where it had been awakened and could speak human language. Its ancestors had also been spirit beasts of the palace, but they had not been oppressed. Instead, they were well cared for, living comfortably and considering themselves part of the palace. It had willingly infiltrated the demon realm as a traitor.</p><p>Not long ago, a mark within its body had been activated, leading it here.</p><p>These messages were left by Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn’t deliberately sought out secrets but had pieced together clues from various observations. How much this would help the Profound Heaven Palace was beyond his concern.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had entered the demon realm.</p><p>His excuse to the Great Immortal Deer was that he wanted to avoid the war and preferred to seek refuge under the Nine-Headed Great Sage, much to the Deer Demon King’s disappointment.</p><p>...</p><p>In the southern part of the demon realm, the terrain was rugged, with towering mountains shrouded in miasma and teeming with demonic beasts.</p><p>At the center of these mountains lay a vast lake, eerily silent. The water was a dull gray, perfectly still, as if it were a lifeless zone. The surrounding demonic beasts dared not approach.</p><p>Suddenly, with a splash, a figure emerged from the dead lake unscathed. After scanning the surroundings, the figure flapped its wings and soared into the sky.</p><p>This was Qin Sang.</p><p>Since entering the demon realm, he had been focused on exploring the so-called demonic secret realms and demon king caves.</p><p>After nearly two years of arduous travel, he had traversed most of the demon realm but had found nothing.</p><p>This dead lake had also failed to yield any surprises.</p><p>Confirming that there were no fragments of the Slaughter Sword in the lake, Qin Sang left without hesitation, though he sensed that the lake’s depths still held secrets.</p><p>Looking south, Qin Sang murmured, "Next, I’ll head to the Heavenly Roc Mountain, the cave of the Great Sage Heavenly Roc. I’ve heard that Bi Fang, that wretch, was so terrified by Tong Lingyu that he sought refuge under the Great Sage and has been recuperating at Heavenly Roc Mountain. It’s not wise to force my way in, but I can wait outside for him to emerge."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered his next steps. Among his remaining targets, the caves of the two great sages were the most important. The likelihood of finding Slaughter Sword fragments elsewhere was slim.</p><p>"First, I’ll head north to the Ten Thousand Demons Cave of the Nine-Headed Great Sage, and then to Heavenly Roc Mountain. Once I kill Bi Fang, I’ll leave the demon realm. I’m almost done comprehending the fourth seal of the 'Seven Master Buddha Seals.' While waiting outside Heavenly Roc Mountain, I can consolidate my understanding of the first four seals. Also, the Sun God Tree has already taken the form of a divine bird. It won’t be long before it fully materializes, faster than I initially expected..."</p><p>With this plan in mind, Qin Sang turned north.</p><p>As he approached the caves of the great demon sages, Qin Sang became even more cautious.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Cave of the Nine-Headed Great Sage was easy to identify. Outside the cave was a cold pool, with immortal vines hanging down and rare herbs growing nearby. Mist swirled around, making it seem like a paradise.</p><p>The entrance to the Ten Thousand Demons Cave lay at the bottom of the cold pool.</p><p>The area around the pool was eerily quiet.</p><p>The Nine-Headed Great Sage was known for his reclusive nature, rarely taking action. He was more like a hidden master of the demon race, and the forces under his command couldn’t compare to those of the Great Sage Heavenly Roc.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his presence and suppressed his aura as he cautiously approached the cold pool. Without needing to force his way into the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, he confirmed that the sword spirit showed no reaction and left in disappointment.</p><p>After exploring the remaining areas, Qin Sang finally arrived near Heavenly Roc Mountain.</p><p>In contrast to the serene Ten Thousand Demons Cave, Heavenly Roc Mountain was a place of overwhelming demonic energy, with countless demons gathered there. Even though most of the demon soldiers had been dispatched to the front lines, Heavenly Roc Mountain still possessed formidable power.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly approached a small hill near Heavenly Roc Mountain. Standing under a tree, he gazed at the towering peak, where thick demonic energy coalesced into dark clouds that blotted out the sky.</p><p>The sword spirit still showed no reaction. Neither of the great sages’ caves contained fragments of the Slaughter Sword.</p><p>After assessing the strength of Heavenly Roc Mountain, Qin Sang concluded that it would be impossible for him to infiltrate and assassinate Bi Fang without alerting the demons. With numerous demon kings present, a direct assault would be unwise.</p><p>He glanced around and, just to be safe, retreated further, selecting a mountain where he carved out a hidden cave. There, he kept an eye on Heavenly Roc Mountain while continuing to comprehend the 'Seven Master Buddha Seals.'</p><p>He knew that the chances of encountering Bi Fang by simply waiting were slim.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that Bi Fang, having sought refuge under the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, would have been rewarded with spiritual medicines. Calculating the time, Bi Fang’s injuries should be nearly healed. The Great Sage Heavenly Roc wouldn’t keep idle hands. With the war raging, Bi Fang would likely be summoned once he regained his strength.</p><p>Having been hunted so ruthlessly by Tong Lingyu, Bi Fang would surely seek revenge against the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for half a year.</p><p>During this time, many demon kings came and went, but Bi Fang was nowhere to be seen, nor was the Frog Fish.</p><p>"The closer the divine bird gets to taking form, the faster it materializes. At this rate, it will fully form in a few months. I had hoped to test the power of the Sun God Tree on Bi Fang! But that turtle-like Bi Fang refuses to show himself. I can’t waste time here forever..."</p><p>Standing at the entrance of his cave, Qin Sang gazed at Heavenly Roc Mountain. After some thought, he decided to wait two more months. If Bi Fang still didn’t appear, he would change his target.</p><p>Another twenty-plus days passed.</p><p>While Qin Sang was immersed in comprehending the 'Seven Master Buddha Seals,' consolidating his understanding of the first four seals, he suddenly jolted awake. His expression changed, and he stood up abruptly, looking toward Heavenly Roc Mountain.</p><p>At that moment, he suppressed his aura to an extremely faint level, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderous sound echoed through the air, deafening.</p><p>Qin Sang then saw a cloud appear in the east, racing toward Heavenly Roc Mountain at an astonishing speed.</p><p>From Heavenly Roc Mountain, figures emerged one after another, forming a welcoming formation. Using his Heavenly Eye technique, Qin Sang caught his first glimpse of Bi Fang.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt no joy. Instead, he immediately retracted the Heavenly Eye technique and remained on high alert.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc had unexpectedly returned to Heavenly Roc Mountain.</p><p>In an instant, the cloud reached the summit of Heavenly Roc Mountain and dispersed, revealing a figure exuding arrogance and dominance—the Great Sage Heavenly Roc, one of the two great sages of the demon race!</p><p>Bi Fang and the other demon kings stepped forward to pay their respects.</p><p>Surprisingly, after a few words, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc dismissed them and remained suspended in mid-air, unmoving.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a sense of unease. He was glad he had kept his distance, or he might have been exposed.</p><p>Though he couldn’t see the Great Sage Heavenly Roc’s expression, Qin Sang could vaguely sense that the great sage was facing south, as if waiting for someone.</p><p>Before long, a black light appeared on the horizon, streaking like a meteor.</p><p>Upon seeing the black light, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc’s eyes snapped open, shooting out two beams of nearly tangible light, exuding an intimidating aura. The black light paused briefly but continued to approach Heavenly Roc Mountain without fear.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, his expression shifting.</p><p>Although the newcomer had concealed his aura, Qin Sang felt a familiar presence—one he had encountered many times before.</p><p>It was none other than the Old Demon of Chaos, who had hunted him on multiple occasions!</p><p>The Old Demon of Chaos had entered the demon realm alone to secretly meet the Great Sage Heavenly Roc.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected that while waiting for Bi Fang, he would stumble upon such a scene.</p><p>"What is this old demon planning? Is he representing the forces of the Boundless Sea? Are the demonic factions conspiring with the demon race to divide the Profound Heaven Palace?"</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, but something felt off.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace’s leader was still alive, and they had a grand elder with late-stage cultivation. With so many powerful figures, it was unlikely they would be easily subdued unless the demonic factions were willing to risk mutual destruction.</p><p>Moreover, if they were truly colluding with the demon race, the Old Demon of Chaos would have taken greater precautions when meeting the Great Sage Heavenly Roc in secret.</p><p>Unable to discern the reason, Qin Sang dared not act recklessly. He held his breath and watched intently.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Old Demon of Chaos flew to the Great Sage Heavenly Roc and landed, his body shrouded in black mist, obscuring his features. He smiled and bowed slightly. "Great Sage, it’s been a while."</p><p>His demeanor was entirely different from the confrontational stance he had taken at the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc’s voice rumbled like thunder, but his words didn’t carry far. "Old Demon, what are you scheming? You sought an audience with me but refused to meet at sea. If you don’t provide a reasonable explanation and disrupt our plans, I’ll make sure you never leave Heavenly Roc Mountain!"</p><p>The Old Demon of Chaos showed no fear at the threat. He replied calmly, "If I were to appear on the battlefield and meet with you, it would cause a stir. I have no desire to become your pawn, used to demoralize the Profound Heaven Palace and sow discord. Since I’ve come to you, it’s for a matter of great importance. I had intended to discuss this at the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly, but an unexpected incident disrupted my plans. It’s only recently that I’ve confirmed certain things."</p><p>As he spoke, the Old Demon of Chaos glanced around. "Is this how the Great Sage treats his guests?"</p><p>"If you have the courage, come inside!"</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc snorted and vanished into Heavenly Roc Mountain. The Old Demon of Chaos, unafraid, followed leisurely.</p>
