<h1>Chapter 1501: Spirit Offering Technique </h1><p>The tribulation clouds hung suspended overhead.</p><p>The tribulation lightning could strike at any moment.</p><p>The first wave of tribulation lightning was the weakest. It had been blocked successively by the ancient restriction and Yin Changsheng, and the aftermath hadn't completely destroyed the Blood Pool of Slaughtering Gloom.</p><p>However, the second wave of tribulation lightning would surely raze the blood pool to the ground, and Tong Lingyu would not be spared.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Tong Lingyu, her face filled with anxiety, furiously struck at the blood pool.</p><p>She had been sealed into the blood pool, her five senses blocked. She hadn't seen the subsequent battle and still couldn't see clearly outside, unaware of the situation.</p><p>However, even through the blood pool, the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation was so clear that it terrified her.</p><p>The blood pool cracked, and the sealing power weakened considerably. But Tong Lingyu was seriously injured, and most of the restrictions on her body had not yet been lifted. She had only recovered a small part of her strength.</p><p>The barrier that she could have easily broken in the past now seemed as impenetrable as a wall of bronze and iron.</p><p>Seeing this scene.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. As he swiftly flew towards the top of the sinkhole, he pointed at the Golden Shen Sword, sending a stream of sword energy remotely slashing towards the edge of the blood pool.</p><p>The reasons for doing this.</p><p>First, Qin Sang knew Tong Lingyu's condition. Even if he rescued her, she wouldn't pose a threat to him.</p><p>His main body still had strength remaining, and he was refining medicinal pills to recover his true essence.</p><p>By the time Tong Lingyu emerged, undid the restrictions on her body, and stabilized her injuries, he would also have recovered some of his strength. Moreover, the Four-Multiply Serpent Seal was in his hands.</p><p>Secondly, after Yin Changsheng's death, Tong Lingyu was still needed to handle the aftermath.</p><p>All traces of the sinkhole would be erased by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu and Yin Changsheng both died here, and only he and Liuli walked out alive, what would the cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace think?</p><p>He himself could come and go as he pleased and didn't fear the Profound Heaven Palace's resentment. But there was also his enemy, Old Demon Hun, outside, along with the Great Sage Heavenly Roc and many other demons.</p><p>He still needed to remain in the Holy Land to seek the fragments of the Killing Sword, and at the very least, he couldn't let the Profound Heaven Palace become an obstacle.</p><p>Additionally, the Profound Heaven Palace had occupied the Holy Land for many years and knew its secrets. Perhaps he could learn something from Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Tong Lingyu had to be saved!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sword energy arrived in an instant, precisely striking a crack.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The sword energy pierced in, and a brilliant light suddenly burst forth.</p><p>The crack exploded on impact, and blood surged wildly.</p><p>Inside the blood pool, Tong Lingyu had already felt some despair when she suddenly sensed a sharp intent approaching. Then, the sealing power on her body drastically decreased, and she saw a blurry image of the outside through the blood pool.</p><p>She was overjoyed and immediately mustered all her remaining strength to rush out of the blood pool!</p><p>Before she could even see the situation clearly, she heard Qin Sang's voice transmission, "The tribulation lightning is imminent, Fellow Daoist Tong, hurry up!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't dare to hesitate. At the last moment, she didn't forget to reach back and grab Luo Yun, who was sealed in a block of ice, and hurriedly followed Qin Sang out.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang successfully escaped the sinkhole.</p><p>Above the sinkhole was a circle of open space, surrounded by black mist.</p><p>There were no other figures in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. He flew to the edge of the black mist, feeling safe before stopping. He gently placed Liuli down, then turned to look at the sinkhole and the tribulation clouds.</p><p>"Many thanks to Fellow Daoist Qin for saving my life."</p><p>Tong Lingyu followed him out.</p><p>Her face was pale, and there were two long, narrow wounds on her beautiful face that were still bleeding, adding a touch of tragic beauty. Her aura was also very chaotic.</p><p>She didn't know that it was the Heavenly Eye Butterfly that had attracted the lightning, and thought that Qin Sang had followed her plan, delaying until Yin Changsheng entered his demonic state and triggered the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang's aura also proved that his true essence was greatly depleted, and he must have experienced a fierce battle.</p><p>"This is the Profound Heaven Palace's Flying Snow Pill. It can quickly replenish true essence. I hope Fellow Daoist Qin won't disdain it."</p><p>There was no need to hide behind the identity of Reverend Qingfeng now.</p><p>Tong Lingyu took out a bottle of pills and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Then, she couldn't hold on any longer and sat down on the spot, closing her eyes tightly, taking the medicine to heal her injuries and break through the restrictions in her body.</p><p>The Flying Snow Pill, one of the Profound Heaven Palace's top-grade spirit pills, Qin Sang had heard of it long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the jade bottle, confirmed there was no trickery, and poured out two pills to swallow. He immediately felt a coolness penetrate his heart and spleen, and the recovery speed of his true essence increased severalfold. The quality was indeed much better than the pills he had prepared.</p><p>He glanced at Luo Yun beside Tong Lingyu.</p><p>Luo Yun was no different from an ice sculpture.</p><p>His aura had become even weaker, almost imperceptible. It was unknown how much strength he would have left after being unsealed, but he would definitely need a long period of rest to recover.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>Inside the tribulation clouds, there were terrifying waves.</p><p>The azure lightning bolts were like enormous thunder pythons, emitting a terrifying aura of destruction.</p><p>Deep within the Holy Land.</p><p>Some figures were moving between the darkness and turbulence, their speed fluctuating. Occasionally, they were forced to change direction by the turbulence, but their target was very clear, and they would quickly return to course.</p><p>Before long, they felt that the speed of the turbulent flow had significantly slowed down. They immediately increased their speed and finally saw something that truly existed.</p><p>A stone stele!</p><p>The base was intact, in the shape of a lotus, a thirteen-petaled lotus platform supporting the stele.</p><p>There were no words or runes on the stele, and its surface was smooth and flawless.</p><p>It was fixed in the void, unmoving. The chaotic forces around it, such as the ancient restrictions, seemed to inexplicably avoid this area, bypassing the stele.</p><p>In the endless darkness, only this stone stele existed, which was enough to prove its extraordinary nature.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Old Demon Hun took the lead, rushing to the front of the stele, his face filled with joy.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc and the others followed closely behind.</p><p>Seeing the stele, everyone's eyes flashed, and they all showed expressions of anticipation.</p><p>"We've found the stele. The Profound Heaven Palace won't be able to pursue us here for a while. Fellow Daoist, you can unseal the Ruyi now!"</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc stared at Old Demon Hun.</p><p>Old Demon Hun remained calm, but he felt a pang of regret in his heart.</p><p>He had invited the Great Sage Heavenly Roc and other demons, intending to use them to deal with the Palace Master and the Grand Elder of the Profound Heaven Palace. He hadn't expected the Profound Heaven Palace to ignore them, showing no intention of stopping them, allowing them to easily find the stele.</p><p>The demons were unharmed, and he was now in a difficult position.</p><p>If he had known this would happen, he would have brought fewer people.</p><p>Now that things had come to this, Old Demon Hun couldn't do anything, otherwise he would become the target of everyone.</p><p>However, the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi was still in his hands, and he had the greatest chance of obtaining the benefits.</p><p>Old Demon Hun nodded slowly, took out the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi, and was about to unseal it when his expression suddenly froze. He turned to look in the direction of the Holy Land's entrance.</p><p>The others also sensed something.</p><p>They were currently located in the deepest part of the Holy Land, far from the floating mountain where the tribulation clouds were, and separated by the dark turbulence. Their perception of the Heavenly Tribulation was not as clear.</p><p>"It seems to be your human race's Heavenly Tribulation? Someone is undergoing tribulation here?"</p><p>A Demon King spoke in surprise.</p><p>"Could the Profound Heaven Palace's Holy Land also be a holy land for tribulation transcendence? No wonder Yin Changsheng could live for so long!"</p><p>Feather-Clothed Yuanjun's eyes were filled with a strange light, and many associations instantly arose in her mind. Her breathing became heavier.</p><p>Even if one could find longevity-prolonging spirit medicines, Heavenly Tribulations were not so easy to overcome. Their power increased with each wave, like a death warrant.</p><p>The others also showed expressions of surprise and greed.</p><p>Old Demon Hun chuckled softly and said, "I've been investigating for many years and have never heard of any holy land for tribulation transcendence. Perhaps my information is not well-informed. If you are interested, you can go and investigate. However, I can't wait any longer. I will unseal the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi now."</p><p>With that, Old Demon Hun raised his hand and gently tapped the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Finally breaking free from its restraints, the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi trembled continuously, and an incomparably rich white light burst forth.</p><p>The light was dazzling.</p><p>Like a white sun, it illuminated the universe.</p><p>The demons subconsciously narrowed their eyes, feeling surprised.</p><p>Old Demon Hun had anticipated that releasing the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi might cause a commotion, but he hadn't expected it to be so astonishing.</p><p>Fortunately, he was cautious enough to find the stele before unsealing it.</p><p>Then, everyone felt a strange, unprecedented fluctuation appearing within the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi. Before they could react, it rushed towards the stele at an astonishing speed.</p><p>They had no time to stop it, nor would they.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>The Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi embedded itself deeply into the lotus platform, seamlessly.</p><p>The next moment, the stele creaked and slowly sank, retracting into the lotus platform. Then, mist rose, parting the darkness and revealing a vast space shrouded in white mist, filled with ethereal immortal energy, like a fairyland.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The light suddenly dissipated.</p><p>Everyone stared fixedly at the space behind the stele, not expecting that there was truly another world here.</p><p>The Holy Land had been searched countless times by the Profound Heaven Palace, and the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi had been brought in by Old Demon Hun. The space within the stele seemed to be opened for the first time.</p><p>A secret realm that had never been entered by anyone!</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone's breathing became heavier.</p><p>The treasures on those floating mountains alone were enough to make the Profound Heaven Palace prosperous for a long time. The space within the stele was clearly even more mysterious.</p><p>An emotion called greed began to brew in everyone's hearts.</p><p>Old Demon Hun's expression, however, was somewhat gloomy. His gaze shifted from the space within the stele to the lotus platform.</p><p>The Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi had embedded itself, becoming a pattern on the lotus platform, extremely fitting, as if it should have been there all along. Old Demon Hun tried various methods, but he couldn't pry the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi loose. This treasure was now out of his control.</p><p>This result was unexpected. The Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi seemed to be just a key. He didn't know if he had to wait for the space within the stele to close again before he could retrieve it.</p><p>Old Demon Hun also didn't know how to close the stele.</p><p>Losing the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi, his advantage was completely gone.</p><p>The Great Sage Heavenly Roc quickly noticed this and burst into laughter, "Fellow Daoist Hun, whether we can obtain treasures here seems to depend on our own fortunes now, haha..."</p><p>Before his voice faded, the Great Sage Heavenly Roc transformed into a golden light and rushed into the mist.</p><p>Old Demon Hun snorted and followed closely behind, and the others also entered one after another.</p><p>...</p><p>The phenomenon created by the Spirit Ganoderma Ruyi could also be seen on the floating mountain.</p><p>Shang Lu, Hall Master Jiang, and the others also noticed the white light that suddenly bloomed and then abruptly extinguished in the depths of the Holy Land.</p><p>However, due to the obstruction of the dark turbulence, they couldn't see the scene of the stele space opening, nor could they spare any attention, because the next wave of tribulation lightning was about to brew in the tribulation clouds.</p><p>They wished they could pass through the ancient restriction and personally witness the scene of the Palace Master undergoing tribulation.</p><p>The tribulation lightning surged.</p><p>The azure light dispelled the darkness.</p><p>The thunder pythons frantically converged towards the center of the tribulation clouds.</p><p>Just then, a figure rushed out from the ground.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's face was unrecognizable, completely demonized.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning was so dense that it poured down like a river, and the azure light illuminated the sky.</p><p>The sound of thunder was even more earth-shattering.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was awakened, looking at Yin Changsheng battling the Heavenly Tribulation, her eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p>He was once the stabilizing force of the Profound Heaven Palace, an unparalleled genius, hailed as the person in the Northern Sea with the greatest hope of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His divine abilities were overwhelming, he commanded respect throughout the sea, causing the demons of the Boundless Sea to avoid the Hidden Sun Realm, and making the Nine-Headed Great Sage not dare to step out of the demon realm to this day.</p><p>Tong Lingyu, Luo Yun, Bing Yao, and the others had grown up listening to Yin Changsheng's legends and admired him greatly.</p><p>But at some point, Yin Changsheng changed...</p><p>Her thoughts swirling, Tong Lingyu suddenly noticed the Hanging Sword Tower above Yin Changsheng's head. Her distracting thoughts instantly vanished, replaced by a deep shock.</p><p>The Hanging Sword Tower actually possessed the power of a Spirit Treasure!</p><p>Tong Lingyu was not only shocked by this.</p><p>How did Qin Sang and Liuli survive in front of the Hanging Sword Tower?</p><p>Liuli's state was a bit strange, not quite normal, but Qin Sang looked unharmed, only his true essence depleted.</p><p>This person's strength... was unfathomable!</p><p>Tong Lingyu simply couldn't imagine it.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning, like a torrential storm, rushed towards that unyielding figure.</p><p>Yin Changsheng spread his arms, roaring肆意 in the midst of the thunder, his demonic might overwhelming, as if he had the momentum to charge into the tribulation clouds.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Hanging Sword Tower finally shattered.</p><p>The tinkling sound stopped abruptly.</p><p>The afterglow turned into a brilliant, radiant glow, blocking a wave of tribulation lightning for its master one last time.</p><p>With his Intrinsic Dharma treasure destroyed, Yin Changsheng inevitably suffered heavy damage. His entire body trembled, his aura greatly diminished, and he was already at his end.</p><p>Perhaps it was a final burst of clarity.</p><p>The madness on Yin Changsheng's face dissipated, his eyes regained clarity, and his entire demeanor underwent a drastic change, returning to the person Tong Lingyu was familiar with.</p><p>The thunder was like a sea.</p><p>Yin Changsheng didn't look at the thunderclouds in the sky.</p><p>The events of the past flashed through his mind.</p><p>Whether they were truly from his own heart or influenced by the evil technique, those things had already been done and were irreversible. He wouldn't regret them.</p><p>Only a trace of melancholy remained in his eyes.</p><p>His eyes stared blankly at the entrance of the Holy Land, as if he wanted to take one last look at this vibrant world.</p><p>Then, without looking back, he flicked his wrist, sending a stream of light towards Tong Lingyu.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The tribulation lightning engulfed him.</p><p>Tong Lingyu reached out and grabbed the stream of light, discovering it was a token with the words 'Profound Heaven' written on it. It was the Profound Heaven Token of the Profound Heaven Palace's Palace Master.</p><p>Sweeping her divine sense across the token, Tong Lingyu's face showed a look of surprise, followed by a hint of understanding.</p><p>At this moment, she noticed Qin Sang's gaze and hurriedly handed the Profound Heaven Token over.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense penetrated, and he saw that the Profound Heaven Token contained a secret technique called the "Spirit Offering Technique". To be precise, it was more like a refinement technique.</p><p>Through the Spirit Offering Technique, using one's own divine sense to nourish and refine an supreme-grade Dharma treasure, one could artificially cultivate the treasure's spirituality until it advanced to become a Spirit Treasure.</p><p>During this process, the power of the Dharma treasure would surpass that of a supreme-grade Dharma treasure, but it would not be as powerful as a true Spirit Treasure. It was called a Pseudo-Spirit Treasure.</p><p>The power of a Pseudo-Spirit Treasure varied, depending entirely on the material of the Dharma treasure and the degree of refinement of the Spirit Offering Technique.</p><p>However, the requirements and difficulty of using the Spirit Offering Technique were extremely high.</p><p>First, the Spirit Offering Technique could only be used on one's Intrinsic Dharma treasure, which was one of the special features of Intrinsic Dharma treasures.</p><p>Second, the cultivator must at least reach the realm of divine sense manifestation to have a chance of success. Generally, only cultivators in the late Nascent Soul stage dared to attempt it.</p><p>Third, refining an Intrinsic Dharma treasure into a true Spirit Treasure was an extremely long process, and Yin Changsheng was still far from it.</p><p>Seeing that it was such a secret technique, Qin Sang was initially somewhat disappointed, but then his heart stirred.</p><p>If he used the "Spirit Offering Technique" on the Ebony Sword, could it help stabilize Yun Youzi's true spirit and accelerate the process of nurturing spirituality?</p>
