<h1>Chapter 1965: A Jest</h1><p>Guanyang Mountain, the Bai Li Clan.</p><p>A renowned Immortal Cultivation family in the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>For centuries, the family's power had steadily grown, and in the past two hundred years, two geniuses had emerged in succession, achieving Nascent Soul.</p><p>With three Nascent Soul Patriarchs presiding over the clan, albeit all in the early stages of Nascent Soul, they were considered a rare exception among the numerous Immortal Cultivation families.</p><p>Such a powerful overlord was now besieged, enemies having stormed their mountain gate.</p><p>Sha Jiayu stopped in the distance, gazing at Guanyang Mountain. Winds howled, and clouds churned; the fluctuation of spiritual energy was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Even from afar, Sha Jiayu felt the violent tremors emanating from Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>Multicolored lights constantly burst forth from the mountain, illuminating the dark clouds above, forming patches of radiant mist.</p><p>This was the extraordinary phenomenon created by the collision of Daoist techniques and magical treasures.</p><p>Amongst these phenomena, the most striking were eight Crimson Fire Dragon Pillars, forming the Bai Li Clan's protective formation.</p><p>Nearly a hundred zhang tall, the Crimson Fire Dragon Pillars stood at the eight cardinal directions of Guanyang Mountain. A fire dragon coiled around each pillar.</p><p>Fierce and formidable, the fire dragons clawed and snapped, weaving through the flames like living creatures. Every so often, they would spew fire towards the heavens.</p><p>The flames spread across the sky, merging into a sea of fire, concealing Guanyang Mountain below.</p><p>However, under the ferocious onslaught from outside, layers of the sea of fire were instantly scattered.</p><p>The flame barrier weakened at a visible pace.</p><p>Once the sea of fire dispersed, it would signify the breaking of the Bai Li Clan's protective formation, leaving the mountain gate and the entire clan exposed to their enemies!</p><p>“The Soul Locking Blade of the Qisha Sect!”</p><p>“The Lion’s Roar Sword of the Dongjian Mountain!”</p><p>“The Yinluo Nine Spirit Banner of the Kuang Family…”</p><p>“Elder Qi’s Earth Origin Thunder Drum!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sha Jiayu grew increasingly alarmed as he watched.</p><p>The Qisha Sect, Dongjian Mountain, the Kuang Family…</p><p>These were all renowned clans and sects near the Yan Kingdom, some not inferior to the Bai Li Clan at its peak.</p><p>Elder Qi and the others were well-known rogue cultivators of high standing.</p><p>What heinous acts had the Bai Li Clan committed to provoke such a joint siege from Immortal Sects, prominent families, and rogue cultivators?</p><p>Against so many powerful enemies, the Bai Li Clan was fighting a losing battle. Even if Bai Li Qingkong hadn't died at his hands, it wouldn't have changed the outcome.</p><p>The area around Guanyang Mountain was completely sealed. Someone had even set up a larger formation to prevent escape, a clear demonstration of their intent to annihilate the Bai Li Clan.</p><p>The situation facing the Bai Li Clan was even more desperate than that of the Sha Family back then.</p><p>Sha Jiayu couldn't imagine how the Bai Li Clan could possibly break through this predicament.</p><p>Despite witnessing the imminent demise of his enemies, Sha Jiayu's face held no joy, his eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p>Just then, a deafening roar resounded from Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>A beam of azure light pierced the dark clouds above.</p><p>The cultivators hovering above Guanyang Mountain scattered to avoid it.</p><p>The azure light descended from the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, the mountains were bathed in an emerald glow.</p><p>Like a sword, the azure light, with the momentum of a thunderbolt, streaked towards the main peak of Guanyang Mountain, the center of the eight dragon pillars.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Fiery flames billowed.</p><p>Flames surged thousands of zhang high, painting the sky crimson.</p><p>The timing of the azure light’s descent was impeccably precise, arriving just before the fire dragons spewed fire, when the sea of fire was at its weakest.</p><p>Under this astonishing display of power, the Bai Li Clan's protective formation instantly became fragile.</p><p>In this moment of crisis, figures flew out from beneath the fire pillars, surrounding them and frantically pouring their True Essence into the formation.</p><p>Their expressions varied: some were wooden, some despairing, some furious. Yet, they could only engage in this final, futile struggle.</p><p>“Bai Li Yuanying, come out! Are you going to be a coward until your death? Today is the day your clan is annihilated! Hahaha…”</p><p>Someone laughed maniacally, their voice filled with malicious glee, clearly harboring a grudge against the Bai Li Clan.</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying was the current head of the Bai Li Clan, a brilliant strategist, and the architect of the clan's rise in the Immortal Cultivation world.</p><p>The annihilation of the Sha Family was his handiwork.</p><p>Most simply watched Guanyang Mountain in silence, offering no taunts. Some eyes flickered with a sense of shared misfortune, but they could only sigh inwardly, their hands showing no mercy.</p><p>The maniacal laughter finally provoked Bai Li Yuanying.</p><p>From the main peak of Guanyang Mountain, a jade-white palace, its doors wide open, emerged an elder.</p><p>The elder's hair was silver, yet he showed no signs of aging.</p><p>Facing such a situation, he remained composed, standing tall, gazing at the sky, and speaking slowly and deliberately: “Where has my Bai Li Clan offended you fellow Daoists? If our crimes warrant annihilation, I will die without complaint! Otherwise, shouldn't you give me an explanation?”</p><p>Hearing these words, the person who had been laughing maniacally added a touch of mockery and amusement to their laughter.</p><p>“Old Ghost Bai Li, you are cunning and deceitful. Do you truly not understand the hearts of the people? Think about all the evil deeds your Bai Li Clan has committed!”</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying disdained to respond to this person. Seeing the silence of the others, he turned to familiar faces.</p><p>“Sect Master Gu, one hundred and fifty-six years ago, a true disciple of the Qisha Sect fought with a junior of my clan. If I recall correctly, my junior was ambushed, one dead and one injured. I only demanded that the culprit cripple their cultivation and that their accomplice pay respects at their grave. I then let the matter rest, preserving both our faces. Has Sect Master Gu harbored resentment ever since?”</p><p>On the western side of Guanyang Mountain, a burly man with copper skin and ringed eyes stood atop a peak.</p><p>Hearing this, his expression hardened slightly, and he avoided Bai Li Yuanying's gaze, offering no answer.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai Li Yuanying turned to a woman.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Kuang, back then, my third brother wronged you. I ordered him to meditate in seclusion for a hundred years, never to enter within a thousand li of the Kuang Family. The clan members who were beaten and injured by Fellow Daoist to vent your anger, that debt was written off. Since then, my Bai Li Clan has actively avoided Fellow Daoist. My third brother failed in his Nascent Soul tribulation and has long since perished. Can Fellow Daoist still not let go?”</p><p>The woman was graceful and charming, appearing to be only around forty years old, yet she was from the same generation as Bai Li Yuanying.</p><p>She let out a cold laugh, "Don't mention those past events. I'm not so petty as to hold onto a youthful indiscretion."</p><p>“Then there must be another reason.”</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying's eyes flashed. “Although I have been in seclusion for many years, I am aware of all the major events within the clan. Which unfilial descendant dared to offend the Kuang Family and conceal it from me!”</p><p>His eyes flashed with killing intent as he swept over all his clan members.</p><p>The cultivators outside the mountain felt a chill in their hearts upon meeting his gaze.</p><p>No one doubted that if Bai Li Yuanying found the culprit, they would be executed on the spot.</p><p>Still, there was no response.</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying then looked towards a patch of thunderclouds outside the mountain.</p><p>Drumbeats resonated from within the thunderclouds, and a large drum could faintly be seen, upon which sat an old man.</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying spoke in a deep voice: “Elder Qi…”</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>Elder Qi let out a long sigh. “Brother Bai Li, even though I am a rogue cultivator, I understand the difficulties of managing a family. I respect your dedication to the Bai Li Clan. However, do you not yet understand, Brother Bai Li?  This world is no longer a time for playing both sides! The Immortal Cultivation world has changed, and this time, Brother Bai Li, you’ve been somewhat slow to react…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>For the past three years, the Bai Li Clan had been fully focused on investigating the truth behind Bai Li Qingkong's death. Could they have overlooked something?</p><p>"My master and your ancestor were, shall we say, acquainted through conflict. I know how your Bai Li Clan rose step by step.</p><p>"It was nothing more than taking advantage of the chaos in the Immortal Cultivation world, appearing neutral on the surface, but actually profiting from the chaos in secret, accumulating resources and foundation.</p><p>"Every time such an opportunity arose, the family's strength would leap forward, coupled with the frequent emergence of outstanding talents among your descendants, leading to a period of prosperity.</p><p>"Even when the various factions reviewed the situation and discovered the truth, they were hindered by the Bai Li Clan's strength and couldn't afford to turn hostile, so they had to endure it.</p><p>"With Brother Bai Li's acuity, you must have already sensed the undercurrents stirring in the Immortal Cultivation world, the coming of chaotic times.</p><p>"This time, Brother Bai Li, you and the Bai Li Clan indeed acted as you always have, wishing to sit on the sidelines, observing the changing situation, preparing to seize the opportunity.</p><p>"However, did Brother Bai Li not consider that everyone has long been wary of the Bai Li Clan and is no longer willing to tolerate it?</p><p>"More importantly, someone will not allow neutrality!"</p><p>Out of some concern, Elder Qi transmitted the last few sentences using a secret technique, not daring to speak them openly.</p><p>At least let Bai Li Yuanying know how they were going to die.</p><p>Admittedly, the successive heads of the Bai Li Clan were all exceptional individuals, their grasp of the situation and their application of strategy were unparalleled.</p><p>As long as they seized another opportunity and a Nascent Soul mid-stage or even late-stage expert emerged, the Bai Li Clan would leap to become a top-tier family.</p><p>Now, the opportunity had arrived.</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying had also acted accordingly. If it weren't for Bai Li Qingkong's sudden death, the entire clan would have already been making their arrangements.</p><p>The Bai Li Clan was already a powerful force, capable of playing both sides.</p><p>Logically, no one would want to offend the Bai Li Clan and push them into the enemy camp. Instead, they should strive to win them over.</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons, even knowing the Bai Li Clan’s intentions, they would choose to tolerate them.</p><p>But no one could have predicted that this time, it was different from the previous chaotic periods in the Immortal Cultivation world.</p><p>Whether it was the Bai Li Clan or other Immortal Cultivation sects, prominent families, or rogue cultivators, they were all just grains of sand before the vast tide, the rolling torrent.</p><p>In the face of such a force, no one could be the fisherman; self-preservation was a luxury.</p><p>Either be swept along, or be crushed!</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying had not realized this, bringing about the destruction of himself and his family.</p><p>Someone needed to be made an example of, and the Bai Li Clan was chosen, and both sides were surprisingly unanimous.</p><p>No one can always be the winner.</p><p>The rise and fall of powers in the Immortal Cultivation world was commonplace. It was simply the Bai Li Clan’s misfortune.</p><p>Two hundred years of prosperity, like a blazing fire, a tapestry of vibrant flowers.</p><p>One miscalculation, and it was all over!</p><p>These words struck Bai Li Yuanying like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Suddenly, he understood.</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying was shrewd and decisive. He bowed to Elder Qi and shouted, “I am willing to lead the Bai Li Clan to charge and fight for our benefactor, even if the entire clan perishes, I will not regret it! I hope Elder Qi will have pity on my clan, young and old, and recommend us!”</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>The person who had laughed maniacally before burst into loud, mocking laughter again.</p><p>A moment later, all Bai Li Yuanying received was a sigh.</p><p>“Too late.”</p><p>There was no further response.</p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky, pressing lower and lower.</p><p>The protective formation faced an even fiercer assault.</p><p>Heavenly thunder and earthly fire, rain, snow, wind, and frost…</p><p>Outside Guanyang Mountain, extraordinary phenomena filled the sky, intermingled with flashes of sword light, the might of magical treasures.</p><p>A storm that originated in the Luohun Abyss and Yundu Mountain was sweeping across the Immortal Cultivation world, reaching Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>Once renowned throughout the Immortal Cultivation world, Guanyang Mountain now appeared so small and fragile.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A clap of thunder shook heaven and earth.</p><p>A large hole was finally blasted open in the sea of fire, waves of flames surging in all directions.</p><p>Even with Bai Li Yuanying leading his clan in desperate resistance, they couldn't retrieve the flames and mend the breach.</p><p>In an instant, dozens of attacks shot through the opening.</p><p>Screams echoed from Guanyang Mountain as over a dozen clan members were killed instantly.</p><p>The eight fire dragons detached from the pillars, filling the gap with their true forms, but they could only delay the inevitable for a moment.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The fire pillar in the south abruptly shattered.</p><p>The fire dragon let out a mournful cry and dissipated into the world.</p><p>For the protective formation, this was a devastating blow. Even with the combined efforts of the entire Bai Li Clan, it was too late to repair it.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Thunder, fire, lightning, and rain fell upon the southern foothills of Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>The mountain, once dotted with palaces and scenic beauty, was instantly ravaged. The Bai Li Clan members there perished on the spot.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>One after another, the Crimson Fire Dragon Pillars shattered.</p><p>The annihilation of the Bai Li Clan was a foregone conclusion, there was no turning back!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Bai Li Yuanying roared at the heavens, his hair and beard bristling, looking like a madman.</p><p>He was not reconciled.</p><p>Generations of ancestors had exhausted their efforts, leading the Bai Li Clan step by step to greatness, only for it to be destroyed in his hands.</p><p>From this day forward, the Bai Li Clan would cease to exist in this world of Immortal Cultivation!</p><p>In the underworld, how could he face his ancestors, how could he face his clan?</p><p>He didn't even know who had given the order to annihilate his entire clan!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Guanyang Mountain.</p><p>Sha Jiayu stood frozen, motionless, witnessing the demise of the Bai Li Clan with his own eyes.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>“Hahahahaha!”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Sha Jiayu suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>He laughed until he doubled over, tears streaming down his face.</p><p>He laughed at the annihilation of his enemies, laughed at Bai Li Yuanying's meticulous calculations throughout his life, only to be outsmarted by fate!</p><p>He laughed at himself, burdened by hatred for two hundred years, his sole focus on revenge.</p><p>He had reunited with his former love, only to try to manipulate her into avenging him.</p><p>He had willingly harmed himself, depleted his lifespan, and cultivated demonic arts, finally seeing the hope of revenge, only to witness his enemies annihilated in an almost comical fashion before his success.</p><p>No matter what he did, the Bai Li Clan would have been destroyed.</p><p>What meaning did his two hundred years of hatred hold?</p><p>Had his two hundred years of life been nothing but a jest?</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Sha Jiayu laughed wildly, hunching over, squatting down, pounding the ground with his fists, unable to stop.</p><p>His laughter became increasingly desolate.</p><p>Finally, he had laughed enough. He stopped, staring blankly at Guanyang Mountain, now reduced to ruins.</p><p>Having annihilated the Bai Li Clan, the cultivators began to withdraw.</p><p>Sha Jiayu's eyes flickered, noticing that they weren't retreating together, but splitting into two distinct groups.</p><p>He suddenly recalled that during the siege of Guanyang Mountain, these groups hadn't been united either, maintaining a wary distance from each other.</p><p>“Why did they level Guanyang Mountain?”</p><p>Sha Jiayu also harbored this question.</p><p>His rationality returned.  Gazing at the directions the two groups departed, his figure flickered, and he too vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Sha Jiayu, having travelled throughout the various kingdoms, returned to the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>He was travel-worn and unkempt. No one would guess he was a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Compared to before, his expression had become much more indifferent.</p><p>Unconsciously, he arrived at the capital of the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Sha Jiayu's expression shifted slightly, a spark returning to his eyes.  He entered the capital and arrived at the Qingyang Teahouse by the Jade Waist Lake.</p>
