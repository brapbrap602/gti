<h1>Chapter 1748: Troops and Horses</h1><p>Bai Long Ferry was in chaos.</p><p>Although the River God Temple was built outside Bai Long Ferry, it wasn't far from the ferry.  Standing at the ferry dock, one could clearly see what was happening there.</p><p>The deceased held some local status, and the funeral procession was quite grand, attracting many onlookers.</p><p>Upon seeing the corpse reanimate, screams erupted from the ferry.</p><p>A green-haired zombie burst from the coffin, immediately releasing a foul stench that drifted on the river breeze, making people want to vomit.</p><p>It lunged towards a man in mourning clothes, the zombie's eldest son.  The man had been kneeling before the coffin during the Taoist's ritual, closest to the coffin.  He scrambled to his feet, his legs numb, and stumbled, falling behind.</p><p>Despite the close blood relation, the green-haired zombie didn't recognize him, only recognizing its prey, emitting a screech like scraping metal.</p><p>This zombie was not only covered in green hair, but its eyes were also a sickly green, fierce and vicious. Its fingernails had grown abnormally long and black, clearly carrying corpse poison; its appearance was terrifying.</p><p>The man, a mere mortal, if pierced by those nails, with the corpse poison entering his body, would likely die instantly.</p><p>Paper charms scattered on the ground were trampled and muddied, their features unrecognizable. The man, terrified, his legs unsteady, tripped and fell into the pile of charms, his desperation finally prompting him to shout.</p><p>"Father! It's your son!"</p><p>The man's voice was filled with terror, attempting to awaken his father's remaining consciousness.</p><p>Behind him, a woman cried out for her husband, being pulled back by others.</p><p>Everyone was filled with fear.</p><p>The Taoist had calculated an auspicious time for the funeral, originally scheduled for an hour later.  The more distant relatives and friends hadn't yet arrived; the rushed funeral was because of the corpse's strange behavior.</p><p>Last night, the family noticed the corpse had a green face and bared fangs. They hastily summoned a Taoist priest to chant a calming incantation, driving seven star-shaped stakes into the coffin, supposedly appeasing the White Dragon Lord to prevent reanimation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the corpse turned into a zombie before the ritual was complete.</p><p>The stench was overwhelming.  The man, his nostrils filled with the corpse's miasma, became disoriented, collapsing, his body weak.</p><p>Just as the man was about to be attacked by the zombie, a faint light suddenly shone from the River God Temple.  The characters on the White Dragon Lord's shrine flickered, and the sound of rushing water echoed from within, the water appearing as a dark pool.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the White Dragon Lord Temple, surprised.</p><p>His spiritual sense was suppressed, his perception greatly reduced, but the temple wasn't far from the ferry.  When disembarking, he had noticed it, secretly observing it along with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly; there had been no magical fluctuations, it was clearly an ordinary stone temple.</p><p>Now, the temple suddenly came ‘alive,’ a magical force appearing out of nowhere, descending upon a token.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the fleeing Taoist priest.</p><p>The priest, agile and strong, was the quickest to react, not fleeing in panic, but as he ran, continuously shaking a golden bell and throwing a cinnabar-painted talisman. The talisman ignited spontaneously without fire, transforming into a fireball, drifting down with the urgent bell ringing.</p><p>After the talisman ignited, the temple changed.</p><p>Rippling water emitted a white stream, condensed water vapor forming a misty, azure chain, clearly formed by magical power, shooting towards the green-haired zombie.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The chain pierced the zombie's shoulder blades, instantly wrapping around it like a spirit snake.</p><p>The zombie, recently reanimated, driven by instinct and lacking intelligence, had been fixated on its prey before the chain arrived, offering almost no resistance.</p><p>Only then did it realize something was wrong, roaring upwards. The wound seemed to have no effect on it, it raised its arms, attempting to grab the chain with its iron-like grip, trying to break free.</p><p>But the chain, magically formed with a layer of mist, was impenetrable.  Its surface was smooth, providing no grip.</p><p>With several ‘whizzing’ sounds, the chain bound the zombie's limbs, tying it up before pulling it back, its face almost touching the man's.</p><p>A man saw a pair of glowing green eyes, his neck twisted, and he fainted on the spot.</p><p>The green-haired zombie, captured and bound by chains, roared and struggled in vain as it was dragged to the temple, its feet gouging deep furrows in the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, was watching the river.</p><p>Suddenly, the river surface churned without reason.</p><p>Shortly after the temple seemingly showed its divine power, Qin Sang sensed two auras rapidly approaching from downstream.</p><p>Using his enhanced vision, he saw that they were two crab demons, one green and one black.</p><p>The black crab possessed a pair of foreclaws almost as large as its body, like two iron hammers.</p><p>The green crab's claws were slender and pointed like forks, smaller than the black crab, yet still as large as a calf.</p><p>They emerged from the water, arriving at the river section behind the temple just as the green-haired zombie was being brought back.</p><p>With a splash, a thick fog enveloped the river, instantly obscuring the entire stretch.  Then, a white dragon burst from the water, circled briefly in the mist, its massive eyes sweeping over the ferry, fixing on the zombie bound before the temple.  It swooped down, seized the zombie with its claws, and, with a flick of its tail, returned to the river.</p><p>After the dragon took the zombie, the temple returned to normal, devoid of any spiritual energy.</p><p>“The Dragon King has shown himself!”</p><p>“The Dragon King has shown himself!”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers witnessed this scene, their fear turning to joy. They knelt, bowing repeatedly before the water temple, their faces filled with awe, chanting the name of the Dragon King.</p><p>But Qin Sang saw through the illusion. There was no Dragon King; it was the handiwork of the two crab demons, using their ability to conjure fog and mist.  The white dragon was actually a transformation of the crab demons, their claws forming the dragon's claws, holding the zombie in a vise-like grip.</p><p>Ordinary mortals, unable to discern the truth, mistook the dragon for the Dragon King.</p><p>The crab demons, having taken the zombie and performed a public display of their power, were satisfied.  They prepared to return to the river, but they failed to notice two dark gleams in the zombie's green eyes, a flash of malice.</p><p>‘Aoo!’</p><p>The green-haired zombie's limbs tensed, letting out a howl like a wolf's. Its bones rattled like thunder, and it expelled a cloud of black smoke.</p><p>This smoke fell on the magical chains, melting them like snow in the sun, causing them to shatter.</p><p>The two crab demons were startled. Before they could react, they felt an immense force on their claws.</p><p>Two cracking sounds echoed.</p><p>In the mist, the white dragon's body convulsed before dissolving into water vapor. Two severed crab claws fell into the river, staining the water with demonic blood.</p><p>Silence fell on the shore.  The villagers, having just thanked the Dragon King for capturing the evil spirit, were stunned by this turn of events.</p><p>“Could the Dragon King not defeat the zombie?”</p><p>This thought filled their minds, causing them to panic.</p><p>The next moment, two giant crabs plummeted from the sky, fleeing towards the river.  But the green-haired zombie, capable of flight, chased the black crab, its black smoke swirling in the air.  With a powerful thrust, its five fingers pierced the crab's carapace, cracking the hard shell.</p><p>The zombie roared wildly, about to kill and feast on its prey, when a huge wave rose on the river surface, and a white figure emerged from the water.</p><p>The figure, long and slender, emerged from the waves. It was a white dragon, seeing its crab minions about to be destroyed by the zombie, glared and condensed a water arrow, which shot towards the zombie's forehead.</p><p>The zombie, its intelligence seemingly enhanced, looked up, its dark eyes fixed on the dragon, and released another puff of corpse gas towards the arrow.</p><p>But the dragon’s power far exceeded the crab demons. The water arrow pierced through the corpse gas effortlessly, impaling the zombie through the forehead before it could evade.</p><p>“This is the River God, the White Dragon King, isn’t it?”</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the dragon.</p><p>He was certain that this dragon was a demon, not a deity.</p><p>Its power was considerable—roughly at the Spirit Transformation stage. Yet, Qin Sang observed that its intelligence was unusually high, its eyes possessing a human-like gleam.  Dragons usually don't attain such intelligence at the Spirit Transformation stage, unless blessed by divine essence.</p><p>Qin Sang was most surprised by the Bai Jiao's calm and peaceful aura; it lacked any aggressive energy.</p><p>The Bai Jiao's attack had been successful, but it hadn't killed the green-haired zombie.  It was strange; this zombie had only recently become one, hadn't cultivated in a place of concentrated yin energy, yet possessed such strength.</p><p>The Bai Jiao's eyes flashed, and it conjured a pair of shackles to capture the zombie. Then, it created a wave, sweeping up the zombie and its injured subordinate before retreating to the riverbed.</p><p>At that moment, a cannon fired from the riverside reeds, shaking the dry grass and sending up a large plume of black smoke.</p><p>The smoke billowed, revealing a three-tiered altar within. The smoke split into three streams in mid-air, rapidly approaching the Bai Jiao.</p><p>A shrill cry came from the central stream of smoke, "My minions, help me flay this scaled beast!  Let's storm this city god's water palace and feast!"</p><p>"Aoooo!"</p><p>Excited screams echoed from all three streams of smoke, their power growing.</p><p>In an instant, black smoke filled the sky above Bai Long Bridge, accompanied by monstrous cries, as if countless demons were attacking.</p><p>The ordinary people were terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the smoke, a look of surprise on her face.</p><p>Within the smoke were three groups of demon soldiers—all were wolf demons.  On the flanks were white wolf demons, each group numbering dozens, slightly smaller in size. In the center was a group of more than ten large black-furred wolves. The leader was exceptionally large, with sleek, shiny fur; standing upright, it towered like a two-story building, majestic and imposing.</p><p>The giant wolf could not only speak but also commanded its troops with impeccable discipline and unified energy. Their movements were precise and orderly, clearly the result of rigorous training.</p><p>Qin Sang had sensed a lurking presence in the reeds, but there was only one—where did these numerous soldiers come from?</p><p>The giant wolf was extremely cautious. The white wolf soldiers flanked the Bai Jiao, blocking its escape up and down the river, while the giant wolf personally led its troops straight towards the Bai Jiao.</p><p>Surrounded on three sides, the Bai Jiao's eyes flashed with shock. It had come alone for reconnaissance; its army was still behind. How could it possibly defeat these wolf demons alone?</p><p>The green-haired zombie was a lure!</p><p>In a moment of desperation, the Bai Jiao opened its mouth wide and let out a deafening dragon roar.</p><p>The roar shook the river's surface. The Bai Jiao frantically fled to the riverbed.</p><p>Seeing this, the giant wolf let out a strange laugh and unleashed a black beam of light. Its soldiers imitated it, and a mass of black lights converged into a dark cloud above the wolf.  Instantly, three black beams shot down: one towards the Bai Jiao's neck, one at its belly, and one at its tail.</p><p>Then, waves surged in the lower reaches of the river, and in the distance, flags could be seen like a forest. Another neatly organized army of demon soldiers was crossing the river.</p><p>Furthermore, the city god temple in Fu Long City, having received the Bai Long Jun's call for help, shot out a brilliant light into the sky.</p><p>These demon soldiers were aquatic creatures like shrimp soldiers, crab generals, and fish demons—the Bai Long Jun's palace guards.</p><p>Seeing reinforcements arrive, the black wolf was not alarmed but delighted.  Calmly, it howled an order, and the white wolf soldiers immediately changed direction and charged towards the palace guards.</p><p>They didn’t neglect manipulating the black lights, preventing the Bai Jiao from escaping.  Finally, the three black lights formed three hoops, tightly binding the Bai Jiao from head to tail.</p><p>The black wolf laughed triumphantly.</p><p>"My minions, scatter their formation!"</p><p>The Bai Long Jun and its troops were inseparable.  By capturing the Bai Long Jun, losing the commander would demoralize the palace guard, leaving them vulnerable. Then they could focus on dealing with this city's city god.</p><p>The black wolf stopped laughing, its eyes fierce as it stared at the struggling Bai Long Jun, opening its mouth full of fangs, ready to pounce.</p><p>At that moment, a sharp cry rang out in its ears.</p><p>Across the river,</p><p>a beam of light suddenly rose from a lone peak.</p><p>A graceful woman, dressed in Daoist robes and with her hair piled high, flew across the river. A green light flashed from her, and instantly, her robes enveloped her.</p><p>She wore a seven-star crown, adorned with a rhinoceros hairpin, and a light yellow Daoist robe.</p><p>The colors of her robe and outer robe were similar. She wore a light yellow five-panel skirt, decorated with three-colored clouds, a bronze waist pendant, and black shoes.</p><p>As her light shimmered, a Dharma altar appeared beneath her.</p><p>This altar was not made of earth or stone.  Under the sunlight, it was clear and translucent, like flowing starlight and moonlight, ethereal and real.</p><p>As the altar appeared, the spiritual energy between the two banks of the river seemed to be cleansed.</p><p>The altar had three tiers: a round top tier, an octagonal middle tier, and a square lower tier, symbolizing the three heavens and three realms. Four pillars stood around it, representing heaven, earth, sun, and moon. Eight gates and ten directions were also established.</p><p>A palm-sized seal floated within the altar. The seal's pattern was intricate, bearing the four thunder-patterned characters '昭告万灵' (Announcing to all creatures), emitting a dazzling light.</p><p>The altar having formed, the woman stood on it, surveying the situation from above, her movements light and graceful.</p><p>Soft incantations echoed in the sky.</p><p>"Heaven clear, earth spirit, troops obey,</p><p>Troops follow the seal, soldiers obey the order."</p><p>With a single incantation,</p><p>the seal in the altar trembled slightly.</p><p>Two gates among the eight gates burst open. A sound like water and thunder echoed, spewing forth two streams of silver mist. Silver light flashed within the mist, and two lines of silver-scaled water serpents emerged, each with a powerful body, four legs, five fingers, and wearing soft armor.</p><p>The city god's troops and wolf soldiers were well-organized, but compared to the water serpent soldiers, they appeared somewhat chaotic.</p><p>The water serpent soldiers were like celestial soldiers, forming their ranks on the river and blocking all directions.</p><p>"Announcing to all creatures seal!"</p><p>The black wolf was shocked. It hastily recalled its wolf soldiers to its side, exclaiming, "Who are you from the Heavenly Pivot Academy!"</p><p>"I am the ninth sub-altar master of the Xuanmiao Yingzhen altar. Who are you, to dare injure the river god under my jurisdiction!"</p><p>The woman's eyes were like lightning as she demanded an answer.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
