<h1>Chapter 1394: The Legacy of Hundred Flowers Valley (4k, Two-in-One)</h1><p>Chapter 1394: The Legacy of Hundred Flowers Valley (4k, Two-in-One)</p><p>The Black Swamp.</p><p>Grim, decaying.</p><p>Everywhere, mud oozed, emitting a strange, nauseating odor.</p><p>Black miasma blotted out the sun.</p><p>Even at midday, the Black Swamp was dark.</p><p>Some of this miasma was the accumulated stench of decay, while other areas contained deadly poisons that could kill even cultivators.</p><p>Toxic and other miasmas mixed together, making them difficult to distinguish and impossible to guard against.</p><p>Strangely, the Black Swamp was not barren; it wasn't devoid of plants.  But these trees were black, like dead wood, yet strangely thrived, exhibiting a perverse vitality.</p><p>Black trees, like evil spirits, lurked in the murky miasma, constantly waiting to devour intruders.</p><p>Few people ever came here; cultivation sects were scarce.</p><p>The Black Swamp was vast, the largest landform in the Crescent Moon Realm, occupying its very heart. Yet, this enormous area was lacking in spiritual veins and unsuitable for medicinal herbs, making it truly desolate.</p><p>Cultivators searching for treasures wouldn't come to such a place, unless they needed something unusual.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>The miasma churned, accompanied by faint, whooshing sounds.</p><p>After a moment, several points of light appeared faintly in the depths of the miasma, some green, some blue, their colors varied.</p><p>The light points flew closer, revealing six cultivators.</p><p>Five of the six were Qi Condensation Stage cultivators, around the tenth level.  Some were young, others clearly old.</p><p>They surrounded a young man in black robes.</p><p>The young man was the only Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Compared to the others, he moved effortlessly through the miasma, standing on a silver disc-shaped flying artifact, a faint protective aura shielding him from the miasma.</p><p>The others were not so fortunate. They flew, activating crude protective talismans, constantly alert to the dangers lurking around them.</p><p>They seemed to have been flying for a long time and were beginning to tire, but seeing the black-robed youth show no sign of stopping, they gritted their teeth and persevered.</p><p>"Yue, where exactly are we going?  It's so far!"</p><p>The only female cultivator, drenched in sweat, complained.</p><p>A long-bearded man beside her chuckled, "Sister Ming, just hold on a little longer; we're almost there. That place is one of the few areas in the Black Swamp rich in spiritual energy. If it were easy to find, it wouldn't be available to us."</p><p>The female cultivator was unconvinced, "If such a good place exists, why hasn't anyone else discovered it?"</p><p>"Those mountains nearby are shrouded in miasma denser than the deepest parts of the Black Swamp, naturally imbued with illusionary power. I stumbled upon it by accident, but my cultivation is too low to venture in. So I called upon Elder Huang and you all.  If we can secure this place and establish a cave dwelling…"</p><p>He was suddenly interrupted by the black-robed youth, "Is this it?"</p><p>The group slowed their flight, and before them lay miasma as thick as clouds, filled with chilling Yin energy.</p><p>The long-bearded man nodded repeatedly, "This is it! Senior, please follow me."</p><p>He found a mark he had previously left, took a moment to adjust his breath, and entered the miasma first.</p><p>The black-robed youth put away his silver disc, summoned a short sword, and the others, taking out their own artifacts, followed the man inside.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Having just entered the miasma, the black-robed youth suddenly stopped everyone, listening intently. His expression changed slightly. "What's that sound?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a buzzing sound filled the air.</p><p>The next scene made them gasp in shock.</p><p>The miasma within swirled violently, and swarms of strange insects burst from the miasma, attacking them frenziedly.  These insects resembled mosquitoes, but each was the size of an infant's fist, their long mouthparts like steel needles, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>"Blood Poison Mosquitoes!"</p><p>The youth exclaimed, his face paling.</p><p>The others showed expressions of terror. Blood Poison Mosquitoes were notorious insects of the Black Swamp. A single one was nothing to worry about, but encountering swarms meant even Foundation Establishment cultivators had to flee.</p><p>Now, hundreds of Blood Poison Mosquitoes were emerging from the miasma, with countless more appearing behind them, a dark, overwhelming mass.</p><p>If they were surrounded by thousands of these mosquitoes, they would all perish, instantly becoming mummies.</p><p>"This is a Blood Poison Mosquito nest! Run!"</p><p>The black-robed youth cursed the long-bearded man silently, but didn't hesitate; he turned and fled.</p><p>The long-bearded man, realizing the trouble he had caused, his legs turned to jelly, stumbled and fell as he fled.</p><p>For a moment, everyone was thrown into chaos, wishing they had a pair of wings.</p><p>Fortunately, the Blood Poison Mosquitoes seemed unwilling to stray far from the miasma.  Having narrowly escaped death, shaken and exhausted, they finally stopped to catch their breath.</p><p>They didn't know...</p><p>After their escape, two figures, a man and a woman, flew out of the miasma.</p><p>Both wore similar robes.  The man's left arm bore an embroidered insect resembling a snake and earthworm with two horns. The woman's robe featured a seven-petaled flower.</p><p>"Junior Brother, your Starlight Insect's illusionary powers are becoming increasingly refined,"</p><p>The female cultivator praised, looking down at the insect in the man's palm.</p><p>The insect resembled an ordinary firefly, but its body was completely transparent, its interior pulsing with a cool starlight glow.</p><p>The Starlight Insect rested in the man's palm, exceptionally docile and affectionate towards him.</p><p>These two were disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>The Blood Poison Mosquitoes that had driven away the black-robed youth and his companions were mostly illusions created by the Starlight Insect.  Only a small number were real.</p><p>The man chuckled with self-satisfaction, but complained, "The sect doesn't want people to know this is Hundred Flowers Valley's entrance.  They've sealed the area with a large formation, forcing us to patrol constantly.  It's all very secretive.  Driving away intruders is just a waste of time. Relying on natural miasma and a few strange insects won't stop determined individuals."</p><p>The female cultivator rolled her eyes.  "It's clearly your fault for slacking off last time and not dealing with that person promptly. You caused the problem and now you blame the sect? The protective formation safeguards Hundred Flowers Valley, but these mountains are vast!  It would cost an enormous amount to seal them all with spirit formations. Besides, the sect just doesn't want to be disturbed by low-level cultivators.  We can't stop determined experts, even if they are powerful."</p><p>"Senior Sister is right."</p><p>Unfazed by the reprimand, the man grinned, looking towards the direction the youth had fled.  He winked. "That guy's short sword was impressive! Very nimble. I heard Junior Sister's been wanting one like that."</p><p>The female cultivator glared.  "What are you planning?  If Master hears about this, you'll be guarding the Snake Cave for ten years!  Go patrol. If you dare slack off again, I will report you to Master!"</p><p>The man mumbled something, unable to argue, quickly storing the Starlight Insect into his dantian before flying back into the miasma.</p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p>Two streaks of light sped through the miasma with astonishing speed.</p><p>"Hundred Flowers Valley is just ahead,"</p><p>one of the streaks of light, Feng Shangshi's voice, announced.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed ahead, delighted.  "Finally!  Thank you, Daoist Friend Feng, for accompanying me and introducing me to so many Daoist friends along the way."</p><p>They had stopped at several Yuan Ying cultivators' residences along the journey, all acquaintances of Feng Shangshi.  Qin Sang had learned many rumors and secrets from Feng Shangshi, a highly rewarding trip.</p><p>"Since you need Black Gang Soft Gold, why didn't you accept Old Ming's invitation? If you asked, he'd surely be willing to delay for a few days until you return,"</p><p>Feng Shangshi curiously asked.</p><p>They had just left another Yuan Ying cultivator's cave dwelling.</p><p>Black Gang Soft Gold was a material needed to refine the Golden Sinking Sword, satisfying another of Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly.  "Daoist Ming is preparing to delve into the Bottomless Demon Cave! I heard several Yuan Ying cultivators once entered together and all perished.  Even ten thousand years ago, a Grand Cultivator disappeared there.  Whether the stories are true or not, it's clear how dangerous it is.  I'm not risking my life for a piece of Black Gang Soft Gold…"</p><p>The Bottomless Demon Cave…</p><p>Known as the most dangerous forbidden area in the Xuan Yue Realm.</p><p>Located northwest of the Black Swamp, near the coast.</p><p>It was said that the entrance was an ordinary-looking stone cave, but the deeper one went, the more dangerous it became. No one has ever reached the end.</p><p>Black Gang Soft Gold was rare, but...</p><p>After weighing the options, Qin Sang decided to give up.</p><p>As they approached Hundred Flowers Valley, they witnessed the earlier scene, including the disciple putting away the Starlight Insect.</p><p>"Did you see that, Daoist Friend?"</p><p>Feng Shangshi asked pointedly.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before nodding slightly.  "Indeed, very unique!"</p><p>Unbeknownst to Feng Shangshi, a flash of shock crossed Qin Sang's eyes!</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley disciple's method of controlling the insect, the fluctuation between them...</p><p>It felt incredibly familiar to Qin Sang. It was strikingly similar to the Witch Clan's life-bound insect-gu technique!</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley disciples were clearly human!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't heard any rumors about the Witch Clan in Bei Chen Realm or the Three Seas Realms.</p><p>It's almost certain there's no trace of the Witch Clan in the North Sea's four regions.</p><p>Could the Soul-linked Insect Gu technique not be unique to the Witch Clan?</p><p>Or perhaps the Witch Clan's ruins were discovered in the North Sea's three regions, and Hundred Flowers Valley inherited it from those ruins?</p><p>Humans don't possess the Witch Clan's innate abilities.  I only dared cultivate thanks to the Jade Buddha's power. How do they solve the problem of their Soul-linked Insect Gu turning against them?</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Regardless, this trip was definitely worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang never expected to find something unexpected in the Crescent Moon Region, given the Canglang Sea route was severed.</p><p>However, it was just a fleeting glimpse. Qin Sang still couldn't confirm whether Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was truly the authentic Witch Clan Soul-linked Insect Gu secret technique.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, Daoist friend," Feng Shangshi landed outside the miasma, flicked his finger, sending a stream of light into the miasma.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, suddenly remembering something. He pretended to be casual and looked around, "Daoist friend said Hundred Flowers Valley's founder came from the Boundless Sea.  I wonder from what part of the Boundless Sea?"</p><p>After carefully recalling, Feng Shangshi said, "…It seems to be from a place called Jinghu.  I can't say exactly where it is; Feng wouldn't dare ask more. Why do you ask?"</p><p>"Jinghu…"</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated the words. It didn't sound like a large geographical area's name; it would likely be difficult to find.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley probably won't easily reveal the secrets of its inheritance.  I need a two-pronged approach, starting with the founder's origin.  Perhaps I can find something out.</p><p>"I'm wondering, does Hundred Flowers Valley consider itself a force of the Boundless Sea, or of the Crescent Moon Region?" Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>"Do you suspect Hundred Flowers Valley is a pawn placed in the Crescent Moon Region by the Boundless Sea?"</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed heartily, "Daoist friend is overthinking. The Boundless Sea is a scattered mess, intricate and complex. Even a Grand Cultivator couldn't subdue all the forces and make them serve him…"</p><p>Before he could finish.</p><p>The miasma in front suddenly churned violently, parting to reveal a path.  A clear voice, like a girl's, echoed from within, "Distinguished guests have arrived. I apologize for not greeting you properly. I hope you two Daoist friends won't mind."</p><p>Feng Shangshi gave a light exclamation, "Is it Daoist Lan?  Is Daoist Mu not in the valley?"</p><p>He then explained to Qin Sang, "Daoist Lan is Daoist Mu's junior sister, named Lan Jingsi. She's exceptionally talented.  Before turning three hundred, she successfully formed two Yuan Ying, achieving the feat of dual Yuan Ying."</p><p>A silvery laugh came from the other side, "Daoist Feng is too kind…"</p><p>Before she finished, a gentle breeze swept past the two, and a girl appeared.  She was fresh and natural, without makeup, possessing innate beauty.</p><p>Lan Jingsi's beautiful eyes turned, sizing up Qin Sang, then looking at Feng Shangshi, "Senior brother mentioned your extraordinary abilities many times on his last visit. I've admired your reputation for some time. Unfortunately, I was guarding the valley then and couldn't accompany him, and didn't get to witness it for myself."</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed heartily, repeatedly saying he didn't deserve such praise, then pointed to Qin Sang, "This is Daoist Mingyue. His abilities far surpass mine; even the Bi Fang is no match for him.  I'm here at Daoist Mingyue's request to meet Daoist Mu."</p><p>Lan Jingsi was greatly surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, "Greetings, Daoist Lan."</p><p>Lan Jingsi returned the bow, withdrawing her scrutinizing gaze.  Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, giving her a truly girlish charm, "You two have come at an unfortunate time.  Senior brother just left the valley and won't be back for a while…"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Feng Shangshi and Qin Sang exchanged glances, feeling at a loss.  He had some acquaintance with Valley Master Mu, but only just met Lan Jingsi, and some things weren't suitable to discuss with her directly.</p><p>Then, Lan Jingsi changed her tone, "This isn't the place to talk.  Please come back to the valley with me, Daoist friends, and have some flower tea.  Since my senior brother is away, I can make decisions on any matters."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Passing through the miasma, they found an inner world.</p><p>Mountains stretched endlessly, the waters were clear and the scenery beautiful, devoid of any decaying or gloomy atmosphere.</p><p>In the Black Swamp, this was like a fairyland from another world, undoubtedly a rare treasure.</p><p>The three flew towards Hundred Flowers Valley's gate. In a short time, they saw some Hundred Flowers Valley disciples practicing and sparring on a mountain.  Most of them were female disciples, their cries echoing.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but look more closely.</p><p>He discovered a few more disciples with Soul-linked Insect Gu.</p><p>This time, he saw more clearly.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, none of these disciples' Insect Gu were of the extraordinary level, fairly ordinary.</p><p>Others would easily overlook the unique aspect of their Insect Gu control techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang, possessing a Soul-linked Insect Gu himself, immediately understood the crux.</p><p>It shared origins with the Witch Clan's inheritance, but wasn't entirely the same!</p>
