Chapter 95: Sword Qi


The moment Yun Qi revealed his figure, Qin Sang immediately rang the Purple Soul Bell.
‘Ding-a-ling-ling…’
The crisp ringing echoed in the cave. Qin Sang was about to seize the opportunity to condense Yin Thunder, kill Zhao Yan, and snatch the Four Cloud Divine Restriction, but a deep unease suddenly arose in his heart.
He frowned, his gaze sweeping over Zhao Yan, finally settling on his left hand.
Zhao Yan's right hand gripped the jade box containing the mysterious orchid, the transparent jade floating before his chest. His left hand, however, stealthily reached towards his storage pouch.  A black bead was faintly visible in his palm.
Qin Sang had never seen this inconspicuous bead before, yet it gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. The moment he saw the bead, all the hairs on his body stood on end, and an unspeakable fear churned in his heart!
“No good!”
Qin Sang's heart pounded.  Unwilling to gamble with his life, he immediately dispersed the Gui Water Yin Thunder spell without hesitation. Transforming into a gust of wind, he fled towards the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation with all his might.
Immediately afterward, he heard Zhao Yan's furious roar, and something whizzed straight towards him.
Qin Sang's scalp tingled. Desperately urging his spiritual power to control the Windwalk technique, just as he was about to crash into the formation, he hurriedly threw out the Green Silk Canopy, a magical artifact obtained from the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Ground, towards the pursuer. Simultaneously, he activated the Ice Silkworm Armor.
‘Boom!’
A thunderous explosion erupted behind him. Qin Sang's ears rang, and he felt a terrifying force slam into his back. The ice armor formed by the Ice Silkworm Armor emitted a cracking sound before shattering instantly, along with the Ice Silkworm Armor itself.  The Green Silk Canopy was also completely obliterated.
The force of the impact threw Qin Sang into the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation. His back was a bloody mess, the bone visible beneath.
The cave shook violently, and the dazzling white light lingered for a long time before dissipating.
Zhao Yan tightly protected the jade box containing the mysterious orchid in his arms, supporting himself with one hand. He was nearly knocked over by the fierce aftershock that rushed towards him, but managed to stabilize himself.
The anger on his face hadn't subsided.  He glared fiercely at the large crater that had abruptly appeared on the ground. The bodies of Ruan Nanfeng and the other two had been reduced to dust along with the surrounding earth.
Zhao Yan spat fiercely, cursing in a hoarse voice, “Wasted one of my Xuan Yin Thunderbolts!”
Then, a deep confusion surfaced on Zhao Yan's face.  He couldn't understand why the usually infallible Heart-Devouring Insects had failed against Qin Sang.  He urged Yun Qi, creating a gust of wind that blew away the rubble in the crater. There was nothing underneath.
The storage pouches of everyone present had also been shattered by the Xuan Yin Thunderbolt.
Zhao Yan made a mental note to ask his sect leader about it later.
“Phew!”
Zhao Yan let out a long sigh of relief, picked up the jade box in his arms, glanced at it, and laughed wildly. After carefully storing it in his storage pouch, he immediately sat cross-legged to recover his spiritual power.
This unexpected event had caught Zhao Yan off guard.  He was most afraid of alerting the Golden Core cultivators of the Yuanzhao Sect.  Faced with a Golden Core cultivator, even countless Xuan Yin Thunderbolts wouldn't be enough to save his life.
It seemed that the Yuanzhao Sect cultivators were already fully engaged by the experts from his own sect.
However, unsure of the situation outside, Zhao Yan still decided to leave this dangerous place as quickly as possible. The mission assigned to him by his sect leader had been successfully completed, and upon returning, he would receive a handsome reward.  His breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage was just around the corner!
While Zhao Yan was circulating his cultivation technique to recover his spiritual power…
Inside the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation…
Qin Sang lay motionless on the ground, the injuries on his back a horrifying sight. If he were an ordinary mortal, he would likely be dead.
Suddenly, a weak groan escaped his lips. Gripping the ground with both hands, Qin Sang endured the excruciating pain in his back and managed to sit up.  The movement aggravated his wounds, and he couldn't help but gasp.
Qin Sang hurriedly retrieved some spirit pills from his storage pouch. He had consulted Senior Brother Meng in the Flowing Cloud Valley. The spirit pills obtained from the man in the bamboo hat were all healing pills, though their efficacy varied. Some were of high quality, like the Water Dew Pill, while others were merely mundane injury medicines. Qin Sang didn't care and swallowed two of each type.
A cooling sensation immediately spread across his back. Some minor wounds began to scab over, and the pain subsided considerably.
The destruction of his two defensive artifacts hadn't been in vain.  He couldn't help but feel a surge of relief.
Recalling the perilous situation he had just faced, Qin Sang still felt a lingering fear and horror.


What was that bead?

The mere shockwave from the explosion had destroyed two of his defensive talismans and left him severely injured.  Luckily, he reacted quickly. Sensing danger, he'd immediately fled using the Ethereal Wind Escape technique.  Otherwise, he would have been vaporized, just like the Green Silk Canopy.

Qin Sang didn't wait for his injuries to stabilize before looking around to assess his surroundings.  The ground was cold, and everything was shrouded in a grayish-white mist, limiting his visibility to only a short distance.

Even though he was now inside the Three Disasters Soul Eater Formation, his mind remained clear. He felt neither mental confusion nor the influence of any heart demons, a testament to the Jade Buddha amulet effectively protecting his Nascent Soul.

However, Qin Sang was worried about being trapped within the formation. Without the Four Cloud Divine Restriction, his current cultivation level was insufficient to pass through the initial three disasters.  To escape, he had to seize the Four Cloud Divine Restriction, and his only hope lay with the Ebony Sword.

With this thought, Qin Sang couldn't focus on healing.  Enduring the pain, he climbed to his feet and cautiously took a step back.  The surrounding grayish-white mist remained unchanged, and no danger appeared.

Qin Sang took a few more steps, and the mist suddenly thinned. He stopped immediately, lest Zhao Yan discover him and throw another bead.

Activating the Cloudfall Wings to conceal his figure, Qin Sang silently moved forward.  At a glance, he spotted Zhao Yan.

Zhao Yan was sitting cross-legged, recovering his spiritual energy.  He clearly didn't expect Qin Sang to be alive and had no defenses in place.

Qin Sang quietly retreated back into the Three Disasters Soul Eater Formation, checked the wound on his back, and felt it wasn't too serious.  He sat cross-legged on the ground, summoned the Ebony Sword, and retrieved a long-cherished mid-grade spirit stone from his storage pouch. Grasping it with both hands, he took a deep breath and focused his mind.

The Ebony Sword floated before Qin Sang, its surface flickering with an inconspicuous dark light.

Qin Sang connected his divine sense to the sword and began frantically absorbing the spirit energy from the stone. As the energy surged into his dantian, his normally stable spiritual sea became turbulent, and searing pain shot through his meridians.

"As expected of a mid-grade spirit stone," Qin Sang thought to himself.

If this had been a year ago, when he was only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, he doubted he could have endured it. Forcing himself to absorb any more would have resulted in his own self-destruction before he could even kill Zhao Yan.

As time passed, the spirit stone's luster gradually dimmed.  At the same time, a green sword aura appeared on the Ebony Sword, flickering at the tip, accompanied by a faint ringing sound.

This sword aura was a manifestation of the sword's material, the Ebony Sword having been refined from spiritual wood.

Gradually, the sword aura enveloped the entire Ebony Sword.
