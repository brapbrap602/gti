<h1>First Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty-Ninth Chapter A Crescent Moon, Ten Thousand Stars (6k, a Triple Update!)</h1><p>Her lucid, jeweled eyes shifted, gazing at the ice box in Qin Sang's hands, and she stated candidly, "Firstly, before you return the sacred object, I wish to borrow it for one day, to draw out the power of the Ice Demon Crystal."</p><p>It seemed there was a second.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated her first request regarding Liuli, not asking what she would use the Ice Demon Crystal for, and instead, somewhat surprised, inquired, "Would doing so affect the seal, or damage the Ice Demon Crystal?"</p><p>"It will not."</p><p>Liuli's tone was completely even as she said, "My master once imparted to me this type of seal. Ice Soul Divine Light can seep into the seal and extract the Ice Demon Crystal's power. It will not cause damage, only weaken the Ice Demon Crystal's might. It will need to be placed back in the Perpetual Ice Spring to nurture for more than a decade, causing the opening of the Sacred Land to be delayed."</p><p>The environment within the Sacred Land was conducive to the cultivation of Xuan Tian Palace disciples.</p><p>Within the Xuan Tian Palace, there were many people trapped at bottlenecks, eagerly awaiting the opening of the Sacred Land. Even waiting an extra year would be extremely difficult to endure, intolerable.</p><p>Shi Xue was the Master of the Listening Snow Pavilion lineage.</p><p>As the Junior Sister in charge, her status was not low.</p><p>However, factions within the Xuan Tian Palace were complex. The Listening Snow Pavilion was merely one of the four main lineages of the Xuan Tian Palace, and currently the weakest of the four. Outside of the four lineages were aristocratic families and various functional halls, above which were elders and the Palace Lord.</p><p>With so many eyes watching, under normal circumstances, she, who was considered mediocre, would not be allowed to use the sacred object. She could only seize this opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "When Fairy extracts the Ice Demon Crystal, it must be done in my presence."</p><p>Firstly, to prevent the sacred object from being monopolized, and secondly, he wanted to take this opportunity to peek at the Ice Demon Crystal.</p><p>As for Liuli's actions causing the Ice Demon Crystal's power to weaken, it wasn't a big deal and could be blamed on that traitor.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be happier if the opening of the Sacred Land was delayed by ten years.</p><p>Once this matter was settled, he planned to visit Hundred Flower Valley.</p><p>If all went as planned, in ten years, he would likely complete the spirit ascension ritual for the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. If the ascension succeeded, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could advance to the mid-stage of the Fourth Change, with greatly increased supernatural powers.</p><p>Furthermore, the Solar Divine Bird might also take shape by then, adding another powerful magical treasure.</p><p>Before entering the Sacred Land, he needed to be fully prepared to deal with any possible variables.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment, "Alright."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded lightly, agreeing to this request, "What is the second condition?"</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt Liuli's gaze suddenly change, becoming more serious and solemn.</p><p>She looked directly at Qin Sang, her tone grave as she said, "When you break through to the Nascent Soul late stage, I hope you will go to Purple Micro Palace with me to help rescue my master. When the time comes, I will pay you accordingly."</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang was somewhat stunned.</p><p>Mainly because there were too many questions in this statement, he didn't even know where to begin.</p><p>Having said that, a glimmer of anticipation flashed deep within Liuli's eyes. To her, rescuing her master was more important than stealing the Ice Demon Crystal.</p><p>With his Five Elements spirit root aptitude, Qin Sang had achieved such accomplishments before the age of four hundred, which was astonishing. Those self-important geniuses of the Xuan Tian Palace were not as dazzling as him.</p><p>In Liuli's eyes, Qin Sang was the most promising cultivator of this era to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, perhaps without rival.</p><p>After a moment of愣怔 [lèngzhēng] (staring blankly), Qin Sang looked at Liuli, his gaze somewhat strange, "That time at Purple Micro Palace, after I left, were you still threatened by Dongyang Bo, and failed to rescue your master?"</p><p>Liuli first shook her head, then nodded.</p><p>"After you escaped, he lost his bargaining chip and couldn't coerce me. I agreed to participate in the Three Regions War, fighting for Shao Hua Mountain, and promised to ask my master to teach him a Tribulation Transcendence secret art. Then, we joined forces and entered the Demon Cave. I sensed my master's aura, but we were not strong enough to free her."</p><p>Recalling the scene at the time, Liuli's expression was somewhat黯然 [ànrán] (dimmed).</p><p>Clearly her master was within reach, but she was powerless, only hating that her cultivation was too low.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Liuli's emotions, and thinking back to the past, Liuli, who was so proud, was willing to practice evil cultivation methods to save her master, and put in so much effort, but ultimately failed.</p><p>Now...</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Purple Micro Palace that had already ascended, and his gaze touched Liuli's firm eyes. He was silent for a while, and could only sigh at the cruelty of the world.</p><p>Gathering her downcast emotions, Liuli revealed a hopeful look, "Fortunately, my master's condition is still good. She sent a telepathic message, ordering me to return to Xuan Tian Palace, cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light, and wait until the Ice Soul Divine Light is mastered, then invite a great cultivator to help. Together, enter the Demon Cave to have a chance to open the Demon Cave's ancient restriction."</p><p>Hearing "Ice Soul Divine Light," Qin Sang remembered that it should be the strange supernatural power she used to deal with him before. It was indeed a peerless great supernatural power.</p><p>He thought for a moment and asked, "Why don't you ask the Palace Lord of Xuan Tian Palace to act? And the Great Elder, she is definitely more likely to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage than I am."</p><p>Liuli's eyes flickered slightly, and she said, "The Palace Lord...it is inconvenient for him to act. The Great Elder was injured during the previous great chaos, damaging her foundation, and causing the hidden dangers of cultivation deviation to almost erupt. Adding insult to injury, before the hidden dangers are removed, I'm afraid..."</p><p>The Palace Lord's condition was even worse than imagined!</p><p>No wonder Liuli didn't ask the Palace Lord to rescue her master, and had not returned to North Chen Region all along.</p><p>The Great Elder should have been injured by the Ghost Mother. The Ghost Mother after recovering her strength was so powerful that the Great Elder wielding a spiritual treasure was no match for her.</p><p>How strong must Celestial Master Tianyue have been to force the Ghost Mother in her prime into a desperate situation and seal her until now.</p><p>Thoughts flashed quickly through Qin Sang's mind, and he said, "I remember, Dongyang Bo said in the Bronze Hall that he wanted to take some treasure?"</p><p>Liuli told him everything she knew, "Perhaps because my master broke into the Demon Cave, the restrictions on the Bronze Hall changed. We didn't find it in the end."</p><p>A glimmer of light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He had long suspected that the sword spirit of the Murderous Sword possessed him in the Bronze Hall. Hearing Liuli's words, he became more certain.</p><p>Perhaps it was because Liuli's master broke into the Demon Cave that caused the sword spirit to accidentally escape from the seal. It had been wandering in the Bronze Hall. When it saw him, someone who practiced the *Mystic Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, it possessed him.</p><p>Of course, these were just guesses.</p><p>What was the origin of the sword spirit, and why was it sealed, was still a mystery.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, "His breakthrough to the mid Nascent Soul stage, and surviving the last Heavenly Tribulation, was thanks to your master? Did he go to the Xuan Tian Palace to look for you later?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo's whereabouts were currently unknown.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo had visited her, even if he couldn't reveal the ascension platform due to his heart demon oath, he could have revealed the disappearance of the Purple Micro Palace, cutting off her thoughts.</p><p>It seemed that although the two had made another deal, the gap between them was already deep, and Dongyang Bo didn't want to embarrass himself.</p><p>"My master taught him a breakthrough secret art that required a great price. Coincidentally, during the Three Regions War, Dongyang Bo tried his best to gather all the conditions. After forcibly breaking through, the yuan qi [yuán qì] (primordial energy) in his body will accelerate its decay. Even if he has methods to solidify his foundation and nourish his origin, he will die the next time the Heavenly Tribulation descends. Calculated, he only has a few decades left."</p><p>As she spoke, Liuli couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang.</p><p>She suspected that Dongyang Bo had already died at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was no match for Qin Sang now, and the conflict between them was almost irreconcilable. After all, Qin Sang was plotted against so deeply and almost suffered eternal doom.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang remembered his Senior Sister's previous evaluation of Dongyang Bo and suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder Dongyang Bo had been retreating all along. It turned out that he didn't have many years to live.</p><p>He had left North Chen Region, it seemed, to hold on to a glimmer of hope for recovery, traveling everywhere, or helping Qiu Mubai find a chance to form a Nascent Soul.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo should be in the North Sea now, I wonder why he didn't visit you. How did you recognize me when we fought before?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously. He was wearing a mask and had made enough disguises, and thought that Dongyang Bo would tell Liuli about his deeds, and Liuli would already know that he had a pair of phoenix wings and was proficient in Thunder Escape.</p><p>Liuli was silent for a moment, then her lips parted slightly, "Sword Intent."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The sword intent of the *Mystic Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* was unique and unparalleled in the world.</p><p>Since Liuli had looked for him later, she must have known that he was cultivating this technique. He didn't expect Liuli to recognize the sword intent so quickly and associate it with him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looked at Liuli, hesitated a little, and mumbled, "There is something you may not know. In just two hundred years, the Purple Micro Palace has been opened twice again, with each interval being shorter than the last."</p><p>He paused slightly.</p><p>Liuli seemed to have sensed something. Her lips were tightly pursed, and her eyes were fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Being stared at by Liuli like this, Qin Sang felt a lot of pressure, and sighed lightly in his heart, "The last time, the Purple Micro Palace...for some reason, the inner hall turned into the original appearance of the immortal palace, and ascended as a whole. It has already left this realm, including Tian Mountain, including the Bronze Hall, all of it...Even if your master survived that change, she is no longer in this realm."</p><p>Having said that, he smiled bitterly, "You must remember to take an oath not to leak this matter, otherwise the North Chen Region will not be at peace from now on."</p><p>He himself was not afraid of heart demon backlash.</p><p>After Qin Sang finished speaking, he did not hear a response.</p><p>There was dead silence.</p><p>Liuli's lips were without any blood, her face pale.</p><p>At this moment, her eyes seemed to have lost all their splendor, and she looked blankly to the north.</p><p>There were no tears, but Qin Sang felt a deep sadness.</p><p>He didn't know much about Liuli, but he could deeply feel the feelings between her and her master, as if rescuing her master was her only obsession in this life.</p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p>The Heavenly Dao was merciless, as always.</p><p>Liuli didn't move for a long time, almost like an ice sculpture.</p><p>Worried that she would suffer cultivation deviation from his words, Qin Sang coughed lightly, "Your master's own cultivation is profound, trapped in the Demon Cave. The outside has the Demon Cave's ancient restriction, the Bronze Hall's ancient restriction, the Black Tower's ancient restriction, and the layers of immortal restrictions on Tian Mountain. These were originally restrictions, but at that time they were equivalent to four layers of protection. Your master may not only be unscathed, but also turn misfortune into blessing, take the opportunity to escape, and see more beautiful scenery and a broader great path in the upper realm! This is an opportunity against the heavens. Compared to her, we are all in a cage, the great path is cut off, and the future is uncertain. I don't know when we will have the day to break free from the shackles..."</p><p>Although it was a word of comfort, it did contain some of Qin Sang's true thoughts.</p><p>After all, the Purple Micro Palace did not shatter on the spot. When it ascended, most of the immortal palace was preserved. Perhaps there were some special places where one could hide to escape the impact and take the opportunity to stow away.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ascension of the immortal palace came too suddenly, and everyone's energy was drawn to the Jade Bone Demon Head and the ascension platform, and there was no opportunity to explore it.</p><p>Liuli's stiff eyes finally moved, suddenly adding a bit of brilliance.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Her voice was somewhat astringent, but it contained hope.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "You can change a condition."</p><p>Liuli looked up at the sky, as if talking to herself, and as if confiding, her voice was a bit飘渺 [piāomiǎo] (ethereal), "I had no one to rely on. My master took me away, like a teacher and a mother. I clearly remember that night, a crescent moon, ten thousand stars..."</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly, without saying a word.</p><p>He looked up at the sky.</p><p>"The shadows of the stars move closer to the galaxy, the moon is bright and spotless." (This is a very liberal and poetic interpretation of the phrase. It captures the essence of the scene being described.)</p><p>"Huff!"</p><p>Liuli took a light breath, reinvigorated her spirits, "In addition to watching the ceremony in the Sacred Land and the *Nine Underworld Return to Yin Jade Chapter*, what other requests do you have?"</p><p>"Let me think about it...it would be best to enter the Xuan Tian Palace's treasure vault and let me choose."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. Seeing that Liuli was not going to mention any more conditions, he simply handed over the ice box, "Fairy, please begin! I can be considered to be borrowing flowers to offer to Buddha. This way, I can exchange for Ice Soul Divine Stellar Energy, already taking advantage."</p><p>"You deserve it."</p><p>Liuli replied.</p><p>She did not refuse, took the ice box, and looked left and right.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>Qin Sang led Liuli into the center of the island, opened up a cave abode, set up a restriction formation after entering, and then sat opposite Liuli.</p><p>Liuli sat cross-legged, placed the ice box flat in front of her.</p><p>Then, she took out an object from her Mustard Seed Bag and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang took it, and felt a chill run from his fingertips straight to his internal organs, and his meridians were almost frozen. Looking down, it was a white pouch-like object, woven from transparent ice threads, with something heavy inside.</p><p>Liuli explained, "This is the Ice Soul Pouch woven from ice silkworm silk refined by my master using Ice Soul Divine Light. It can store Ice Soul Stellar Essence. My master didn't leave much Ice Soul Stellar Essence behind. Half of it is here, enough for you to build the foundation for your external incarnation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, and put it away unceremoniously, then quietly watched Liuli's actions.</p><p>The cave abode was quiet.</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes, her breath calmed, and finally there was only a faint, imperceptible fluctuation. She opened her palms and placed them flat above the ice box.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently.</p><p>He didn't know how long had passed. The sky outside was already bright. Liuli looked tired, as if she had consumed a lot.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang inexplicably felt a chill.</p><p>He lowered his head and looked intently at Liuli's fingertips.</p><p>The void there was calm as before, but he really knew that Liuli had already activated the Ice Soul Divine Light supernatural power and noticed subtle fluctuations.</p><p>"What a unique supernatural power! It sounds like this supernatural power of hers has not yet been fully mastered. After it is fully mastered, I am afraid that it will be difficult for me to detect it before being hit. How sharp. She hasn't broken through to the mid Nascent Soul stage for so long, could it be that she has spent most of her energy on cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light?"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed secretly.</p><p>At this time, he noticed that the seal on the surface of the mysterious ice box was loosening. With Chen Yan's movements, strands of transparent, water-like aura seeped out from the gaps in the seal.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang啧啧称奇 [zézé chēngqí] (ticked his tongue in wonder).</p><p>If that traitor had Liuli's methods, he would have already obtained the sacred object and would not have ended up in such a miserable situation.</p><p>Eventually, these auras gathered into a drop of water.</p><p>Liuli held it in her hand, concentrated and comprehended it for a while, and remained still.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the clue and asked in a low voice, "This...is not suitable?"</p><p>Liuli nodded, her tone without waves, "It doesn't fit."</p><p>Qin Sang scratched his head a little. He didn't know what Liuli wanted to do and couldn't offer any good suggestions.</p><p>However, he could see that Liuli should be looking for some kind of treasure of the Ice Cold Way, probably preparing for a cultivation technique.</p><p>"Bring it, let me take a look."</p><p>Qin Sang reached out.</p><p>Liuli did not hesitate and handed the 'drop of water' to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed it back and forth, but couldn't find any clues.</p><p>He knew very little about the Ice Cold Way, but he also knew that even spiritual objects with similar properties were essentially different. The requirements were even more stringent at the Nascent Soul level, and there could be no mistakes.</p><p>For example, when he refined the Gold Sinking Sword, if he required it to be extremely compatible with himself like others did, I'm afraid that of the three spiritual objects on his body, only the Fallen Phoenix Jade barely met the requirements, and the Blue Spot Gold and the Celestial Crown Heavy Liquid were not suitable.</p><p>A hair's breadth of difference, a thousand miles of error.</p><p>This was also the reason why top-grade magical treasures were difficult to refine.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the 'drop of water'. He already believed eight or nine points of what Liuli had said before.</p><p>Because Liuli did not know about the ascension of the Purple Micro Palace before, and her purpose was to ask him to save her master, it was impossible for her to lie about this kind of thing and antagonize him.</p><p>After thinking about it, Qin Sang asked, "Regarding the rumors of Huang Longshi's 行宫 [xínggōng] (temporary palace), did the Xuan Tian Palace and Old Devil Hunmo join hands to release it to confuse the line of sight, and secretly promote the advance of the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly?"</p><p>Liuli didn't know about it before.</p><p>Later, Shi Xue learned about this matter from the elders, and they then understood. Now that things had reached this point, whether this matter was true or false was no longer important. Liuli nodded and defaulted to it.</p><p>"Sure enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart had a little more assurance, and he determinedly said, "They didn't expect the sacred object to be in my hands before. The real purpose was to lure the traitor to show up."</p><p>Liuli nodded again, her eyes moved slightly, and she vaguely grasped something.</p><p>Qin Sang said lightly.</p><p>"That guy is not a fool. Knowing that Xuan Tian Palace can sense the sacred object, how could he be as ignorant as I am, openly bringing the sacred object to participate in the assembly."</p><p>"Xuan Tian Palace must have another way to lock him!"</p><p>"You don't dare to take action on Hunmo Island, indicating that the connection with Old Devil Hunmo is not deep. The forces behind the Ten Thousand Demons Assembly can't possibly let you search extensively, breaking the rules."</p><p>"In this case, the best approach is to let him expose himself."</p><p>Qin Sang was just making reasonable deductions based on the information he had learned, comparing his heart to his.</p><p>He raised his eyes, "Your Great Elder should have prepared an extremely rare treasure, one that the traitor would risk exposure to obtain."</p><p>Liuli stopped nodding and looked at Qin Sang instead.</p><p>This kind of treasure was very likely what she needed.</p><p>However, with her status in Xuan Tian Palace, it was impossible to exchange for it so easily.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "After seeing the Great Elder, I will tell her that Fairy did not hesitate to risk herself, explaining with reason, moving with emotion, and persuading me bitterly, before resolving my anger and vigilance, and promising to return the sacred object. The sacred object is returned, and Fairy has a three-point credit. As for how you say it to the Great Elder, I don't care."</p><p>Liuli stared at Qin Sang fixedly, and said, "Thank you."</p><p>"You've said thank you twice, can't you change the word?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but joke, and then said seriously, "It's just a matter of lifting a finger! If you hadn't come forward to mediate, I and the Xuan Tian Palace would not have been so smooth, and there would have been a fight, accumulating many grudges for nothing. Maybe I would have been secretly plotted against by the Great Elder with a spiritual treasure, this is really your credit! Moreover, we both get what we need, don't need to take it to heart."</p><p>From beginning to end, he and Liuli tacitly did not mention the matter of采补 [cǎibǔ] (sexual cultivation).</p><p>Liuli didn't mention it, and he wasn't convenient to say anything.</p><p>Qin Sang originally wanted to ask her if she had cultivated *Stone Bridge Zen*, but seeing that she was serious and didn't seem to have participated in this evil Zen, it was not good to ask.</p><p>He remembered Dongyang Bo had said that the *Mystic Womb Jade Cauldron True Scripture* had endless hidden dangers.</p><p>He himself was fortunate to have been protected by the Jade Buddha, avoiding this disaster, causing the hidden danger to befall Liuli instead.</p><p>From the time he met Liuli, Qin Sang had been silently observing, and did not feel that the other party's emotions fluctuated because of him, which made him suspect that Dongyang Bo might have been exaggerating back then.</p><p>Liuli was silent for a long time, and finally said, "Thank you."</p><p>Qin Sang looked helpless.</p><p>On the eve of parting, Qin Sang handed Liuli a transmission talisman, and instructed, "If your Great Elder agrees, crush this talisman near Pearl Island, I will send her the location and talk in detail. Well, tell the Great Elder, it is best not to bring too many experts, I am very胆小 [dǎnxiǎo] (timid)."</p><p>Liuli's gaze quickly swept across Qin Sang's face, seeming to say, 'You're timid?'</p><p>She didn't say much, silently put away the transmission talisman, and flew away.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the shore and watched her leave.</p><p>After Liuli's escape light disappeared, he meditated for a long time, sighed softly, and also turned back on his own.</p><p>He first took back the formation, then went to visit True Master Yin Quan, made friends with a few fellow Daoists through him, stayed for a day and bid farewell to the others, and returned to Pearl Island with True Master Yin Quan.</p><p>Qin Sang was now considered a honored guest. He proposed to rent the Dan Ding Association's fire room, but angered True Master Yin Quan, so he had to reluctantly occupy it for free.</p><p>He knew in his heart that the other party valued him so much, partly because of those ancient prescriptions. In addition, Dan Ding Mountain might already be suspecting his origin.</p><p>Regardless of whether Qin Sang knew the path to North Chen Region, even if he did, he would not leak it.</p><p>Through this period of traveling, Qin Sang deeply realized the strength of the North Sea cultivation world, which was far superior to the North Chen Region. Fortunately, the human and demon races in the North Sea were at odds, and the human race was a plate of loose sand, restraining each other.</p><p>The North Chen Region had just recovered from the chaos, and the strong had ascended, just when it was weak.</p><p>At this time, restoring the connection between the two regions would have more disadvantages than advantages for the North Chen Region's sects. It was not a wise move, it was best to wait until a great cultivator appeared.</p><p>Therefore, he had been feigning ignorance, not revealing any hint.</p><p>After thanking True Master Yin Quan, Qin Sang entered the fire room, took out the Gold Sinking Sword and the three spiritual objects such as the Fallen Phoenix Jade together, preparing to upgrade it to the level of a top-grade magical treasure before meeting the Great Elder.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he could completely use his own infant fire and Nine Nether Devil Fire to refine weapons.</p><p>However, doing so would consume too much.</p><p>Refining a magical treasure cannot be accomplished overnight. In the process, such strong spiritual fire is not needed most of the time. The underground fire vein is enough, and he can be relaxed, why not do it?</p><p>He also added several layers of restrictions outside the fire room.</p><p>Then, with a wave of his single hand, he grabbed the Fallen Phoenix Jade, and the infant fire flickered in his palm.</p><p>The Fallen Phoenix Jade slowly rotated in his palm, and when it showed signs of melting, Qin Sang stopped his movements, gently shook his palm, and threw it into the fire furnace to be calcined by the ground fire.</p><p>He didn't know how long had passed. The Fallen Phoenix Jade melted into a mass of spiritual liquid, with all the impurities removed.</p><p>Qin Sang placed it above the fire furnace, maintained this state, and then grabbed the other two spiritual objects one after another, applied the method accordingly, and refined them all.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to re-refine the spirit sword. He first grabbed the spirit sword and used his divine sense to comprehend the characteristics of the spiritual materials and the spirit sword respectively, and after confirming that there was nothing wrong, he summoned the Nine Nether Devil Fire and threw the Gold Sinking Sword into it.</p>
