<h1>Chapter 2076 Escape Route</h1><p>Think of defeat before victory.</p><p>Facing a Nascent Soul Ancestor, one couldn't afford the slightest carelessness.</p><p>Qin Sang's first consideration was how to safely retreat and avoid pursuit if the treasure snatch failed and enraged Venerable Ye.</p><p>Ming Wei and the Life Talisman she held were the safest escape route. However, even the Life Talisman might not fully protect them, and he needed to carefully consider how to use it effectively.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist means…"</p><p>Ming Wei hesitated.</p><p>She didn't fully believe Qin Sang's words.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Ancestor breaking through Immortal Restrictions and traversing the Trial Realm was too fantastical, unprecedented.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's cautious demeanor forced her to consider the possibility.</p><p>Within the secret cavern, various factions intertwined in complexity, and there was no shortage of top experts like Blood Bat and Daoist Xiaoyun. Each of them posed a greater threat than herself.</p><p>Qin Sang deceiving her wouldn't benefit him; it would be akin to severing his own arm.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and glanced at the cave entrance at the edge of the secret cavern. "Once Venerable Ye acts, everyone else will be stunned, their reactions delayed. Our opponent will only be him. As long as we can shake off Venerable Ye, we'll be safe. Fellow Daoist, guard a concealed spot with the Life Talisman. Once I retrieve the treasure, activate the Life Talisman immediately…"</p><p>Ming Wei remained silent.</p><p>She understood that if they did this, Qin Sang would bear the greatest risk, directly facing the wrath of a Nascent Soul Ancestor, while she merely observed from the rear.</p><p>If the situation turned sour, she could easily retreat. The danger was indeed minimal.</p><p>However, this way, she would be too far from the Soul Cleansing Liquid, leaving her no choice but to trust in Qin Sang's strength and place all her hopes on him.</p><p>Ming Wei raised her head, staring into Qin Sang's eyes. "By then, Fellow Daoist wouldn't just grab your own bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid and leave, would you?"</p><p>"Since we've chosen to offend Venerable Ye, what's the difference between one bottle and two?  With the Life Talisman in Fellow Daoist's hands, I naturally have to seize a bottle for you. Otherwise, if you tear up our agreement in anger, with no escape route left, wouldn't I be left to weep with regret? If Fellow Daoist is worried, I'll swear a Heart Demon Oath."</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid was a shared interest for both him and Ming Wei, and also the reason Qin Sang could trust her.</p><p>Facing a powerful enemy, they could only bind themselves together tightly.</p><p>"Good! I only hope Fellow Daoist will keep your promise!"</p><p>Ming Wei knew the situation dictated her actions.  With so many monks and so little liquid, her hopes were already slim.  Having received Qin Sang's promise, she tapped her foot and retreated from the secret cavern.  However, she saw Qin Sang also following her out.</p><p>Noticing Ming Wei's puzzled look, Qin Sang said, "Venerable Ye is definitely aware of the Life Talisman's function. We can't use it under his nose. If he remains stationary, we'll be trapped. We need to make some arrangements to cover our tracks…"</p><p>The stone walls around the secret cavern were riddled with countless cave entrances. After searching for a while, they found an entrance with the most complex path, branching into several tunnels.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a diversion. With a pat on his Corpse Puppet Pouch, several Devil Corpses sprang out and entered the different tunnels, lying in wait under Qin Sang's command.</p><p>Then, with a flick of his sleeve, small, intricate demonic banners spiraled out, a total of nine!</p><p>Over the past decade, Qin Sang had been continuously attempting to master the Nine Banners Demonic Formation and had made considerable progress.</p><p>Ming Wei looked at the banners, surprised.</p><p>She could vaguely sense that these seemingly inconspicuous black banners were not simple. Having been by her Ancestor's side, her experience surpassed other cultivators of the same rank, yet she couldn't discern the banners' true nature for a moment.</p><p>They seemed like formation flags, yet also like magical treasures, very peculiar.</p><p>Ming Wei knew these treasures must be Qin Sang's secret. Suppressing her curiosity, she didn't ask any further questions.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The nine demonic banners flickered rapidly, in the blink of an eye forming a complex formation before Qin Sang.  Black demonic flames seemed to dance on the surface of the banners, ready to erupt.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the demonic formation, sensing its power, then pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>'Thump! Thump! Thump!…'</p><p>The nine demonic banners sank into the ground, disappearing completely.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to Ming Wei and turned back to the secret cavern.</p><p>Ming Wei had already vaguely guessed the purpose of Qin Sang's arrangements. Seeing Qin Sang's figure disappear into the Earth Spirit army, she thought for a moment, retrieved several puppets from her Mustard Seed Pouch, ordered them to enter the depths of the tunnels, and then, holding the Life Talisman, stared intently at the sealing light barrier at the center of the secret cavern.</p><p>Her palm tightened, her nerves on edge.</p><p>Returning to the secret cavern, Qin Sang flew on his sword into the Earth Spirit army, rapidly advancing forward.</p><p>The cultivators were besieging the sealing light barrier.  The ownership of the Soul Cleansing Liquid would soon be decided.</p><p>Along the way, Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Pouch. After exchanging a few words, he separated from Qin Sang. The situation within the secret cavern was exceptionally chaotic, and no one noticed Bai's identity as a Refined Corpse.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>With a sword strike, he sent an Earth Spirit flying, breaking through the encirclement.</p><p>Then, more Earth Spirits surrounded him. The closer he got to the sealing light barrier, the stronger the Earth Spirits became.</p><p>With his sword, Qin Sang drew closer and closer to the sealing light barrier, finally managing to clearly see the scene within.</p><p>A tall platform stood at the center of the light barrier.</p><p>Its surface was inscribed with strange patterns, resembling runes.</p><p>The platform was large, but only four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid rested upon it, making it appear rather empty.</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully but didn't find any mechanisms on the platform. He didn't know how these bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid appeared here or where they came from.</p><p>The seal remained unbroken; it wasn't time for the major battle yet.</p><p>However, each cultivator harbored ulterior motives, their positions carefully chosen, and undercurrents surged beneath the surface.</p><p>No one knew who had already formed secret alliances.</p><p>Without Venerable Ye, if things progressed naturally, it would surely unfold into a spectacular drama of trust and betrayal.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across Venerable Ye.</p><p>Like Blood Bat and the others, Venerable Ye was diligently attacking the seal, his presence unassuming. No one would imagine a Nascent Soul Ancestor had infiltrated their ranks.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't let the Skyeye Butterfly spy on Venerable Ye, fearing detection.</p><p>However, by observing Venerable Ye's actions, Qin Sang indeed noticed some peculiarities.</p><p>Facing the Earth Spirit army, Venerable Ye always gave off an air of effortless ease. Though disguised, he inadvertently displayed an incredibly precise control over his True Essence, which secretly startled Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind Venerable Ye, Su Nu and the others formed a battle formation, entangled with the Earth Spirit army.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes held no excitement, only deep worry.</p><p>She didn't know how much confidence Qin Sang had.</p><p>If Qin Sang perished at Venerable Ye's hands, she would have no hope of resistance, only submitting to her fate.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the other two had already begun transmitting their voices to each other, envisioning the future with a relaxed tone, full of confidence in Venerable Ye. Hearing their transmissions, Su Nu forced a smile and brushed them off.</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p>Sword Qi, Blade Light.</p><p>Daoist Arts, Magical Treasures.</p><p>One attack after another landed on the sealing light barrier.</p><p>The sealing light barrier trembled incessantly, its light gradually dimming, becoming increasingly thin.</p><p>The cultivators stared fixedly at the Soul Cleansing Liquid within, poised to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't choose to get too close to the seal.  In the outer perimeter, while warding off Earth Spirits, he also urged the Ebony Sword, sending streams of Sword Qi and Sword Light toward the seal.</p><p>His attention remained fixed on Venerable Ye.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
