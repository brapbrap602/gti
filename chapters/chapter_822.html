<h1>Chapter 814: The Steward</h1><p>Quheng Island.</p><p>Disguised and gathering intelligence, Qin Sang quickly identified a person of interest. Even on a large island like Quheng, late-stage Core Formation cultivators were rare. Unless they lived in complete seclusion, it was impossible for them to remain entirely unknown.</p><p>This person, Luo Daotong, wasn't cultivating on Quheng. He was the island lord of Liangqiu Island, matching the description of "Island Lord Luo" mentioned by the Hanhai Sect Master.</p><p>Strangely, Qin Sang couldn't find any information about Luo Daotong's background. He seemed to be a rogue cultivator.  This was clearly impossible; Luo Daotong was simply concealing his origins.</p><p>Qin Sang also learned that Quheng Island had two island lords, one from the righteous path and one from the demonic path, both powerful Nascent Soul ancestors.  Both sides recognized Quheng as the main island of the Liefeng archipelago and used it as a base to govern the region. This created a system of checks and balances between the two island lords, preventing any major conflicts.</p><p>After all, the Liefeng archipelago was far from stable.  Especially in the chaotic southern region, neither the righteous nor the demonic path could fully exert their influence. These external threats forced the two island lords to cooperate.  Otherwise, they risked not only losing potential gains but also destabilizing the already pacified areas. Their superiors wouldn't tolerate such a failure.</p><p>Despite his efforts, Qin Sang couldn't determine which island lord Luo Daotong was connected to. He was no longer a naive newcomer to the cultivation world. He understood that the line between righteous and demonic was blurred; both sides were driven by ambition, and whoever won would write history. It was best to view them simply as two competing forces.  He couldn't assume that the demonic path was solely responsible for the ambush on Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>He wouldn't dare to provoke the island lords of Quheng.</p><p>To uncover the truth, he had to focus on Luo Daotong.</p><p>Luo Daotong's cave was openly located on Liangqiu Island.  A direct confrontation was out of the question.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident that with the Star Conch, Bloodfiend Divine Light, and Two-Headed Serpent, he could likely subdue Luo Daotong with a surprise attack. However, attacking on Luo Daotong's home turf presented too many variables.</p><p>His opponent's mysterious origins suggested he possessed powerful treasures.  If Qin Sang failed or the fight became protracted, giving Luo Daotong a chance to call for help, things would become complicated.</p><p>Liangqiu Island wasn't far from Quheng. A Nascent Soul ancestor could arrive quickly.  Qin Sang risked not only failing to capture Luo Daotong but also being trapped himself.</p><p>He needed to wait for an opportunity when Luo Daotong was off the island.  A failed attack would allow for a swift retreat.</p><p>Such opportunities were rare. Qin Sang sat in a tavern, pondering for a long time.  He decided to find a cave and settle down, planning his next move carefully.</p><p>Leaving the tavern, Qin Sang used his movement technique to fly towards the mountain. The best caves on Quheng Island were at the summit.</p><p>He soon arrived at the cave rental area.  Several opulent pavilions stood on the mountainside, shimmering with restrictive formations. Cultivators entered and exited, with flying lights rising and falling.</p><p>This served as a boundary. Mortals weren't allowed to ascend any higher, where the cultivators' caves were located.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the pavilions, noting their signs, and finally entered one.</p><p>Inside the vast hall were a dozen sand tables, each displaying an identical miniature mountain peak, a replica of Quheng's main peak.  The peaks were dotted with countless lights of various colors. Qin Sang understood that these lights represented the caves.</p><p>Several cultivators were gathered around some of the sand tables.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, are you looking to rent a cave?"</p><p>A young cultivator approached.  Qin Sang was surprised to see that he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>"Indeed," Qin Sang nodded, his expression unchanged. "I'm new here and seeking a place to stay. What do these lights signify? How can I rent a suitable cave?"</p><p>The young cultivator sized up Qin Sang. "If you don't mind me asking, on which island did you previously cultivate, and do you have a jade token?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. "What? Do I need a jade token to rent a cave? I'm not from around here. I came from the south."</p><p>Given the gravity of his mission, he didn't want to reveal his identity. He activated the Spirit Concealment Technique, appearing as an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Only someone with higher cultivation could see through his disguise.</p><p>The jade token was a unique identification badge for Quheng Island.</p><p>The young cultivator's expression cleared.  "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstand. I didn't mean to offend. Since you've come from the south, I imagine you admire our prosperous lands.  It must have been arduous for you to travel such a distance, braving the dangers, with your level of cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression softened. He sighed, "Indeed, I only seek a safe haven for cultivation.  The risks are worth it."</p><p>"Well said, Fellow Daoist.  We small fry only seek stability."</p><p>The young cultivator, empathizing with Qin Sang's words, pulled him outside the pavilion and lowered his voice. "To be honest, Fellow Daoist, I've had a similar experience. You're new here, so you may not be aware. Renting a cave here isn't cost-effective. The caves on this island are expensive, and there's no income. I learned that the hard way. I quickly depleted my resources and nearly ended up on the streets.  If you intend to stay long-term, take my advice and don't limit yourself to the main island. I can point you in a better direction."</p><p>The young cultivator paused meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang, catching his drift, had a good idea of what he meant.</p><p>The young cultivator, trying to maintain an air of mystery, continued when Qin Sang didn't respond. "With your cultivation, you're qualified to be a steward on a smaller island nearby.  You'll have a cave and earn spirit stones.  It's a much better option. All it requires is some of your time, and you'll need to defend the mortals against storms and sea beasts. The spiritual energy on the other islands is weaker, but it's sufficient for cultivation."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  His plan for Luo Daotong wouldn't be accomplished overnight.  Taking on a legitimate role and staying near Liangqiu Island seemed like a good strategy.</p><p>"How can I become a steward? I'm very interested. Please enlighten me, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>"You could apply to the larger islands, but you'd have to wait for them to recruit stewards, and you'd be competing with others. It's uncertain."</p><p>The young cultivator lowered his voice further.  "I happen to know a senior with some influence. He can pull strings for most islands, except the core ones. However, he wouldn't do it for free..."</p><p>The young cultivator rubbed his fingers together.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled inwardly. He didn't care about a small amount of spirit stones as long as it got the job done.  He wasn't afraid of being cheated. He took out a small pouch of spirit stones and handed it to the young cultivator, whose face immediately lit up.</p>
