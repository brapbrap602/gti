<h1>Chapter 1206: The Abyssal Ruins</h1><p>The decaying bones were all carefully collected by him as if they were treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was still unwilling to give up. He wanted to search for more clues here, hoping to uncover Tan Hao's whereabouts and, if possible, find that mysterious person once and for all.</p><p>In this cave, aside from the bone array, there were no other traces.</p><p>Qin Sang explored every underwater peak, yet still found nothing. The underwater restrictions seemed to exist solely to seal this one person.</p><p>With no results from his search, Qin Sang looked up. "Let's go to the surface. Unless something unexpected happens, this should be the Abyssal Ruins..."</p><p>He activated the Ebony Sword to protect himself, suppressing the fluctuations of sword energy to the most subtle level. Remaining vigilant, he cautiously floated to the surface.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>What greeted him was a cataclysmic storm.</p><p>Above the water, the void was shrouded in gray darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself and looked around, realizing he was in what seemed to be a lake. The entire lake surface was enveloped by dark clouds, completely obscured.</p><p>The interior of the dark clouds resembled a chaotic realm, blocking both Qin Sang's vision and spiritual sense.</p><p>However, standing here, Qin Sang could sense the tremors more clearly. Back at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters, it felt as though there was a layer separating him, with only the faintest ripples reaching him.</p><p>Now, he could truly feel the waves of tremors, one after another.</p><p>"It's confirmed. The tremors are from the Sin God Palace. This is indeed the interior of the Abyssal Ruins!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the dark clouds and realized they were formed by powerful ancient restrictions. Though they appeared gray and dull, they were extremely dangerous, capable of devouring any intruder.</p><p>He then soared into the storm, reaching the edge of the dark clouds. He flew back and forth along the edge, as if searching for something.</p><p>"So that's it. Every time the Sin God Palace tremors, it impacts the ancient restrictions and seals, creating flaws. The power of the restrictions here has been slowly dissipating. Over the past few centuries, the Purple Star Palace has frequently appeared, and the Sin God Palace must have been trembling frequently as well, causing the sealing power to weaken significantly. In the era of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, the seals were far more stable. Even the sect leader, a Nascent Soul expert, might not have had the ability to break the seals."</p><p>Qin Sang roughly understood why the Heavenly Corpse Sect couldn't rescue the mysterious person.</p><p>He flew around, attempting to find flaws in the ancient restrictions, even considering passing through the dark clouds to enter the Abyssal Ruins!</p><p>This wasn't for the sake of finding Tan Hao.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that after Tan Hao rescued the mysterious person, he must have returned to the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters. Although the power within the dark clouds' ancient restrictions was fading, it wasn't easy to pass through.</p><p>He wanted to enter the Abyssal Ruins himself.</p><p>First, and most importantly, it was related to the fragments of the Slaughter Sword.</p><p>When he formed his Nascent Soul, the Slaughter Sword's spirit had conveyed a message, urging Qin Sang to search for other fragments. As long as he got close, the sword spirit could sense them and guide him.</p><p>The first two fragments were found in the Purple Star Palace and the Seven Slaughter Hall.</p><p>There was clearly a deep connection between the Sin God Palace and the Purple Star Palace. Qin Sang speculated whether the Sin God Palace, like the Seven Slaughter Hall, might also contain a fragment. However, the Sin God Palace was controlled by the Sin Abyss cultivators, and with the three domains at war, sneaking into the Sin God Palace would require considerable effort.</p><p>Still, the Slaughter Sword had shattered into an unknown number of pieces, and they might not all be in secret realms related to the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>In the vast North Star Realm, among the various forbidden lands and secret realms, only the Ancient Immortal Battlefield surpassed the Abyssal Ruins. Since he couldn't enter the Sin God Palace for now, he couldn't miss the opportunity to search the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>The Sin Abyss wasn't yet aware of this passage, but the power of the ancient restrictions in the dark clouds was continuously fading. Once it weakened to a certain point, this place would surely be discovered.</p><p>Second, Qin Sang sensed that the source of the tremors wasn't nearby but far away.</p><p>The core of the Abyssal Ruins was undoubtedly where the Sin God Palace was located, the most heavily guarded area of the Sin Abyss. Other areas would be much more relaxed.</p><p>The tremors from the Sin God Palace swept across the entire Abyssal Ruins, causing massive chaos. This was the perfect opportunity to use the tremors to mask his movements and infiltrate.</p><p>As long as he acted carefully, and with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's ability to warn him in time, the chances of being discovered were slim.</p><p>While thinking, Qin Sang circled the dark clouds, searching for weak points in the ancient restrictions. Finally, he chose a spot.</p><p>He stored the Twelve Demon Banners in his sleeve and activated the Ebony Sword, preparing to break through the restrictions with full force.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly stood on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings opening and closing as it focused on finding flaws in the ancient restrictions. Its Heavenly Eye ability was most effective here.</p><p>Its wings shimmered with light, flashes of Heavenly Eye radiance mingling with faint threads of thunder.</p><p>In truth, after breaking through to the fourth transformation, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly not only mastered the Heavenly Eye Divine Light but also gained self-defense capabilities. The thunder it wielded contained a trace of true tribulation lightning, making its power formidable.</p><p>But Qin Sang still habitually protected it, avoiding direct confrontations whenever possible. He also considered the need to prevent others from discovering the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's ability to devour tribulation lightning.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly itself was still fragile. If anything happened to it, Qin Sang would regret it deeply.</p><p>Sword energy surrounded the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, forming a dense, impenetrable barrier. The butterfly could feel its master's care, and the emotions it conveyed were not only affectionate but also filled with attachment and reverence.</p><p>Together, the man and the butterfly worked to break through the restrictions.</p><p>They soon found a flaw in the ancient restrictions, like a crack that extended deep into the dark clouds.</p><p>However, affected by the tremors from the Sin God Palace, the ancient restrictions were unstable, and the crack flickered in and out. After observing for a long time and confirming the pattern, Qin Sang determined the danger was minimal. With a swift movement, he entered the crack.</p><p>The Ebony Sword hung inverted above his head, its sword energy flowing like tassels to protect him. With each movement, it slashed out a sword light, striking the dark clouds repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't act randomly. Each sword light struck key points of the ancient restrictions. As Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly gained a deeper understanding of the restrictions, they followed the flaws, unraveling them like peeling a cocoon, and opened a path. Their figures disappeared into the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p>"The dark clouds are far thicker than I imagined..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, this thought flashing through his mind, before continuing his arduous task.</p><p>After breaking through countless restrictions, the dark clouds ahead finally thinned. He quickened his pace, and the Ebony Sword instantly slashed out dozens of sword lights, finally cleaving through the dark clouds!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang burst out of the dark clouds just as another tremor arrived, immediately feeling immense pressure bearing down on him.</p><p>The Ebony Sword vibrated gently, helping him dissipate the impact.</p><p>Beyond the dark clouds was an unknown land.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and found the place utterly barren. Outside, the dark clouds connected to another mass of dark clouds, with ancient restrictions scattered everywhere. The endless sea of gray clouds stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Within the sea of clouds, the shadows of mountain peaks loomed faintly, their hues matching the dark clouds. The Abyssal Ruins resembled a forsaken wasteland, dark and lifeless.</p><p>"This is the Sin Abyss. Its scenery is completely different from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and its danger level is second only to the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield where space is shattered. However, this terrain makes it easier to conceal my aura. The tremors from the Sin God Palace will continue for a long time, so I can search slowly."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed his surroundings and entered the gap between two masses of dark clouds.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Feeling that this wasn't sustainable, I tried going to bed early yesterday.</p><p>Today, my energy is great. It's been a long time since I've felt this good. I shouldn't need a nap at noon and can make up for the second chapter.</p><p>I hope to adjust well and turn my schedule around.</p>
