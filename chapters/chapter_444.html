Chapter 437: The Finger Pointing Peak


The man in white glanced back.  "Unfortunately, I'm injured, and Daoist Wu was ambushed. Otherwise, the three of us working together could have easily dealt with him. To comprehend Sword Qi and Thunder Sound at the Foundation Establishment stage… he'll be a major threat in the future. He's been keeping a low profile; I wonder if he's following us?"

The cultivator surnamed Luo coldly snorted, subtly altering the course of their covered boat. "Brother Liu and the others are just ahead. If he dares to follow, we'll leave him for dead!"


…

Seeing the boat retreat, Qin Sang paused slightly before continuing his own retreat.

The distance between them grew until the boat completely disappeared from his sight.

Qin Sang didn't choose to pursue them. There weren't many on the boat – two late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, one of whom was injured.  If the opportunity arose, he could eliminate them all.

But this wasn't the place for a protracted fight. If he couldn't subdue them quickly, and encountered another team from the Heavenly Walk League, he would be in a difficult position.  He could have tried if they hadn't been deterred by his earlier attack.

Since they chose to retreat, Qin Sang decided to let it go.

After observing for a while, confirming that the Heavenly Walk League had indeed left, Qin Sang surfaced, summoned his You Luo Cloud, and pursued Mu Yifeng.

Shortly after, he saw Mu Yifeng's erratic flight.

"Brother Mu!"

Qin Sang supported the exhausted Mu Yifeng, tossing him a bottle of spirit pills. "They've escaped. Quickly take these pills to recover; I'll protect you."

"Thank you, Junior Brother Qin, for saving my life!"

Mu Yifeng looked back; the boat was indeed gone.

Finally escaping death, Mu Yifeng felt utterly drained, his dantian and meridians in terrible shape, his survival due only to sheer will.  He knew this wasn't the time for pleasantries. He mounted the You Luo Cloud, took the pills, and entered meditation to recover.

Qin Sang flew low to the water's surface, speeding towards the medicinal garden.

As he flew deeper into the Xiao Han region, he encountered no enemies.

Unsure of the battle's outcome, Qin Sang sensed danger and decided that upon reaching the garden, he would take the herbs, seal the protective barrier, and flee the area. At the very least, he would wait until the situation stabilized before returning.

Qin Sang looked curiously at Mu Yifeng. He hadn't missed a single trade fair, diligently monitoring the situation and gathering information.  There had been no signs of a major battle beforehand; why the sudden chaos?

As they neared the garden, Mu Yifeng finally awoke, though his injuries were still unhealed.

"Junior Brother Qin!"

Mu Yifeng rose and bowed, solemnly saying, "I owe you a great debt."

Qin Sang stopped him. "Brother Mu, you're exaggerating!  The medicinal garden I guard is just ahead. Your injuries are serious; why not rest a little longer?"

Mu Yifeng realized. "So Junior Brother is stationed here! After returning to the sect from Xuanlu Pass, I was assigned here with Senior Brother Kuang to patrol the nearby waters right after my breakthrough to late-stage Foundation Establishment. Alas! If I had known, I would have visited you long ago."

"I've only been here for less than two years, attending only a few trade fairs, rarely interacting with the outside world. I didn't know Senior Brother was nearby."

Qin Sang then recounted the events of the trade fair. "How did you and Senior Brother Kuang get entangled with those Heavenly Walk League scoundrels? Were you with Senior Fang…"

Unlike Xiong Li, Mu Yifeng was forthright. "Yes, some time ago, we were ordered to act with Senior Fang and the others. They seemed to be searching for something called the Finger Pointing Peak.  Supposedly, there were signs of its appearance, but I don't know the specifics.  I don't know when our whereabouts were compromised, but the Heavenly Walk League secretly gathered forces and ambushed us as we were returning, our minds relaxed…"

Mu Yifeng told Qin Sang everything.

Still, Qin Sang was puzzled. He'd never heard of the Finger Pointing Peak. It sounded like a mountain, but he couldn't understand why it caused a clash between Gold Core cultivators.

Since the spiritual tide showed signs of change, both sides had only lost some Foundation Establishment cultivators; there had been no reports of Gold Core cultivators engaging.

Qin Sang pressed for more details, learning that besides Gold Core cultivators, Mu Yifeng's party included over ten False Dan realm experts.  If it weren't for the Heavenly Walk League's treacherous ambush, they wouldn't have been so badly defeated.


So many experts deployed!  That Zhi Tian Peak must be significant!

This further solidified Qin Sang's decision to leave.

Mu Yi Feng asked Qin Sang about the flight path, then said, "Junior Brother Qin, I have urgent orders to return to Stargazing Island to report the enemy situation."

Qin Sang had heard of Stargazing Island at the trading fair.

It's where the Golden Core cultivators of the major sects are stationed.  The situation in the Yun Cang Marsh is controlled from Stargazing Island, resisting the Tian Xing League.  Orders are issued from this island.

Despite many legends, its location is extremely secretive, known only to some members of the patrol guard.  Qin Sang only learned its precise location from Mu Yi Feng.

It's northeast of the medicinal garden, surprisingly close.

Mu Yi Feng's injuries hadn't healed, preventing solo flight. However, Qin Sang didn't intend to go to Stargazing Island immediately.

Once conflict erupts, the island will inevitably become a war zone.  Going there now is risky; he prefers a few more years of peaceful cultivation.

"After returning to the medicinal garden, I'll gather herbs with Junior Brother Jie Ying and leave.  Brother Mu, you could continue traveling with me. By the time we're near Stargazing Island, your injuries should be stable enough for you to go."

Mu Yi Feng readily agreed.

While recovering, Mu Yi Feng inquired about Qin Sang's experiences over the years.

Qin Sang omitted personal details, and after some casual conversation, they exchanged cultivation insights.

As the medicinal garden came into view, Qin Sang remembered Yu Yangzi and the others. They’d been close friends. He received considerable support from Yu Yangzi when he first arrived at Xuanlu Pass, helping him establish himself.

However, they both became engrossed in cultivation, and lost contact after parting ways.

He asked, "Brother Mu, how are Senior Brother Yu Yangzi and the others who remained at Xuanlu Pass?"

Mu Yi Feng's expression darkened. He sighed deeply, "Senior Brother Yu Yangzi has been a Xuanlu Guard. Twenty years ago, he led a group out of the pass to deal with cloud beasts… As you know the situation in the ancient immortal battlefield, after leaving the pass, he encountered a large group of cloud beasts and the whole squad… none returned…"

Qin Sang was stunned.

The news of Yu Yangzi was devastating.

A silence descended.  Neither Qin Sang nor Mu Yi Feng felt like talking.

After a long pause, a sigh escaped.
