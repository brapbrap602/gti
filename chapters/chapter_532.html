<h1>Chapter 525: The Beast Tide</h1><p>Chapter 525: The Beast Tide</p><p>“Junior Brother Liu?”</p><p>The elder’s expression softened slightly, his brow furrowed as he asked, “What happened to cause such alarm, Junior Brother Liu?”</p><p>Liu, the cultivator, gasped for breath, urgently saying, “Senior Brother Chai, I just received urgent news from Senior Brother Qi. A beast tide has suddenly erupted in the second level of the Wuyaya Valley!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The elder’s eyes widened in shock, exclaiming, “A beast tide in the second level? Wasn’t there one just two years ago? Why so soon?”</p><p>Not only the elder, but Qin Sang, who was eavesdropping nearby, was also startled.</p><p>A beast tide in the Wuyaya Valley!</p><p>What a coincidence, for a beast tide to erupt at this time?</p><p>In the Wuyaya Valley, a beast tide is comparable to a natural disaster. Only a major incident within the valley, or the rampage of a powerful demon beast, could trigger such an event.</p><p>Beast tides are unpredictable, but there’s always a time gap between them. Even the first level wouldn’t see two beast tides within three years.</p><p>Otherwise, who would dare to go in for training if the valley is destroyed before the cause can be investigated?</p><p>Few cultivators have the strength to enter the second level of the Wuyaya Valley; the situation is far more stable than the first level. Qin Sang has been in Qingyang Market Town for over twenty years, entering and exiting the second level countless times, and he's only encountered a small-scale beast tide once.</p><p>The Wuyaya Valley is the best training ground for disciples of the Qingyang Demon Sect.  Especially since the last beast tide two years ago, it's been considered the safest time to enter. Many must be there now, seeking treasures.</p><p>A beast tide now would result in heavy losses for the Qingyang Demon Sect. They'll certainly dispatch powerful cultivators to rescue those inside.</p><p>The second level is fraught with danger; weaker cultivators would be courting death.</p><p>Perhaps, even that Nascent Soul cultivator will intervene!</p><p>Could this be a stroke of luck?</p><p>Or…</p><p>Doubt flickered in Qin Sang's eyes.  The image of Yun Youzi flashed through his mind. Reason told him such a coincidence was impossible.</p><p>He knew Yun Youzi was powerful, but could a beast tide really be triggered by human intervention?</p><p>Liu shook his head.  “We don't know yet. Senior Brother Qi’s message said the beast tide appeared without warning. Senior Brother Qi and the others, who were training in the second level, are trapped. They're holding out, struggling to send a distress signal, but they've now gone silent!”</p><p>Liu opened his palm, revealing a very faint strand of Qingyang Demon Fire, wriggling like a small snake.</p><p>This type of fire-based communication is a unique method of the Qingyang Demon Sect, impossible to counterfeit.</p><p>He probed the fire with his spiritual sense.</p><p>After a moment, the elder's face changed drastically.</p><p>“Come with me to Shen Gang Peak to find Junior Brother Li…”</p><p>He grabbed Liu, soared into the air, and sped towards the inner sect like a shooting star, both figures disappearing into the sky in an instant.</p><p>After they left, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, his expression a mixture of surprise and delight. He quickly activated his body technique and followed.</p><p>He decided to stop pondering whether the beast tide was caused by Yun Youzi or was a coincidence.</p><p>For him, this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</p><p>All he needed to do was seize the chance; everything else could wait.</p><p>…</p><p>Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>A thick green mist filled the air, with the Qingyang divine energy manifesting in various forms.</p><p>Some condensed into large masses, resembling jade-like stones; some hung from cliffs, slender as tassels; others existed within valleys, soft as water, sometimes rippling on the surface.</p><p>At the foot of Shen Gang Peak, the Qingyang energy was more scattered, floating lightly and clinging to things, but denser than the mist.</p><p>Near the summit, mostly jade-like Qingyang energy predominated, but sparsely, with considerable distance between each piece.</p><p>In fact, this form was the true Qian Tian divine energy!</p><p>A fist-sized piece of Qingyang energy was embedded in the center of an unusually flat stone platform, clearly man-made.</p><p>A middle-aged cultivator sat cross-legged beside it, dressed in white, exuding an extraordinary air, his cultivation at an astonishing False Core stage!</p><p>His hands extended towards the Qingyang energy, a green flame emanating from his palms. A barely visible energy connection existed between the flame and the energy.</p><p>The cultivator was absorbing the Qingyang energy to refine his demon fire.</p><p>Not far from the peak, lightning flashed incessantly above him, hinting at the wild nature of the ancestral sacred fire.  His expression was serious; his movements extremely cautious, given his surroundings.</p><p>Some time later, the middle-aged cultivator retracted his demonic fire.  His gaze swept across a patch of radiant energy to his left; he was about to move when he frowned, looking down.</p><p>A green mist swirled, and figures were seen rapidly ascending the mountain.</p><p>Soon, Liu and Chai came into view.</p><p>Seeing the middle-aged cultivator, both their faces lit up with relief; they quickened their pace.  Liu, the cultivator with the lowest cultivation, showed a terrified expression, still shaken by the terrifying ancestral sacred fire and thunder.</p><p>“Liu, Chai, what happened at the sect?” the middle-aged cultivator asked calmly, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>“Master Li, a beast horde has erupted in the second layer of the Wuyagu Valley.  Master Qi and the others are trapped…”</p><p>The elder, noticing Liu's hesitant demeanor, handed the message from the demonic fire to the middle-aged cultivator, quickly explaining the situation.</p><p>“A beast horde?”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's expression changed. After receiving and reading the demonic fire message, his brow furrowed.  He pondered for a moment before sternly asking Liu, “Besides Master Qi and the others, who else entered the second layer of the Wuyagu Valley?”</p><p>Liu gulped, stammering, “Right now, only Master Qi managed to send a distress signal.  Master Wang and the others are completely out of contact; we don't know where they are.  We haven’t received any reports from the valley yet, so we don't know the scale of the beast horde…”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator shook his head.  “You two wait here. I'll go see Master Wu immediately.”</p><p>The elder exclaimed, “We need to trouble Master Wu?”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator snorted coldly, “The second layer of the Wuyagu Valley is vast, and now there’s a raging beast horde. They’re scattered everywhere.  Do you think just the few of us can rescue everyone, Chai? If this beast horde spreads throughout the second layer, by the time we find them one by one, they’ll all be eaten by the beasts! A bunch of fools, they didn’t even notice the signs of the beast horde. We have no choice but to ask Master Wu to come out of seclusion!”</p><p>…</p><p>Far from the Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang lay hidden in the tall grass, his eyes fixed on the mountaintop!</p><p>He needed to know how many people were going to the Wuyagu Valley to rescue them!</p><p>After waiting for quite a while, the mountain remained still. Just as Qin Sang was growing anxious, he saw a burst of light flame break through the green mist from the peak, radiating an awe-inspiring aura!</p><p>“I’ll go ahead. You follow on the flying vessel!”</p><p>A long roar echoed from the flame, which instantly vanished from Qin Sang's sight, leaving only its lingering sound.</p>
