<h1># Chapter 1453: Shifting Forms and Changing Shadows</h1><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang's eyes showed no fluctuation, and his figure did not pause in the slightest. He clenched his right fist, and a spiritual power-condensed gauntlet appeared on the surface of his fist, filled with barbs. He immediately swung it fiercely at the still-forming ice wall.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The ice wall shattered into countless pieces.</p><p>A bolt of lightning pierced through the flying ice shards.</p><p>In the midst of his frantic escape, Qin Sang did not forget to create a layer of disguise. He condensed a gauntlet of spiritual power, leading them to mistakenly believe that it was some kind of divine ability that shattered the ice wall, rather than the power of his physical body.</p><p>Especially in front of Old Devil Hunmo, hiding one trump card was still another, which might come in handy in the future.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and beckoned.</p><p>Just as he was about to recall the Jin Shen Sword, Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted slightly, his brow furrowing, his expression somewhat strange.</p><p>A ray of sword light flew back.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly put it away. In addition to the Jin Shen Sword, there was also a transparent ice bead the size of a mung bean, which was brought back beneath the Jin Shen Sword, unnoticed by the others.</p><p>He glanced sideways, subtly casting a glance at Chen Yan, but his figure did not pause in the slightest. Amidst the gazes of various expressions, he strode away.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang let out a sinister cold laugh, his voice low and containing anger.</p><p>"Hmph! Ambushing halfway, attempting to rob and kill this old man, yet claiming it was a misunderstanding. When did Xuantian Palace become so shameless? When I have time, this old man will definitely ask Yin Changsheng for an explanation in person!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng was the Palace Lord of Xuantian Palace.</p><p>This man was famous throughout the Northern Sea, and could be inquired about without much effort.</p><p>This kind of tone…</p><p>The Xuantian Palace cultivators were all stunned for a moment, and a thought emerged in their minds in unison.</p><p>"Could it be that he has some connection with the Palace Lord? Which old devil from the Boundless Sea is he?"</p><p>"Junior Sister, are you alright?"</p><p>Shi Xue felt relieved that the devil was finally forced away by the two elders and Chen Yan, and was filled with lingering fear.</p><p>This was the first time she had encountered such a dangerous situation.</p><p>Thinking of the oppressive feeling that the devil had brought her earlier, Shi Xue couldn't help but tremble.</p><p>At this time, she saw that her Junior Sister was standing in place, holding the Phoenix-shaped treasured sword in one hand, her eyes tightly closed, and her situation seemed a bit off. She hurried over to support her, her face full of worry.</p><p>Chen Yan shook her head, her eyelids trembled, and she opened them with some difficulty.</p><p>She turned her head to look south, her gaze sweeping over the lightning-like escaping light, her eyes flickering, and she fell into contemplation.</p><p>Another Xuantian Palace Nascent Soul cultivator flew over and was secretly shocked to find that Shi Xue and Liu Li were both extremely weak.</p><p>Elders Mei and Lan ordered this person to protect Shi Xue and Liu Li, and they chased after him.</p><p>This person briefly understood what had happened, and became even more shocked. He couldn't help but look up ahead, and then exclaimed in surprise: "The two elders have been left behind!"</p><p>Shi Xue opened her eyes to look, and it was indeed so.</p><p>That person's speed was too fast!</p><p>They couldn't defeat him in a fight, and they couldn't catch up to him. Such an opponent was truly terrifying.</p><p>…</p><p>On the sea.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo was leading his eldest disciple, who was wearing a black robe, and their figures were rising and falling with the waves, rushing over quickly.</p><p>They realized that the Xuantian Palace elders had disappeared, so they went out to the island to search. They were attracted by the strange phenomena and came closer to observe the situation, discovering the intense battle.</p><p>From afar, the black-robed man saw that the four Xuantian Palace Nascent Souls seemed to be helpless against one person, including the two elders. His mouth was slightly open, and his expression was somewhat dull.</p><p>He believed that his master also had this strength, but his master was the number one expert in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>No wonder Xuantian Palace wanted to cooperate with his master; they were actually hunting such a powerful opponent.</p><p>But what puzzled the black-robed man was why the Great Elder of Xuantian Palace was nowhere to be seen, otherwise it would have been impossible for this person to be so ostentatious.</p><p>"Master, the Great Elder of Xuantian Palace doesn't seem to be around?"</p><p>The black-robed man carefully transmitted his voice.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo 'hmmed' and glanced around. He had not sensed the aura of the Great Elder of Xuantian Palace along the way, so it was likely that there was another scheme.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang acted like a rabbit rising and a falcon falling, instantly shaking off the encirclement, unscathed, and striding away.</p><p>This made the black-robed man stare blankly again, and he couldn't help but evaluate the person's strength in his heart, using Old Devil Hunmo as his benchmark.</p><p>Although this person was a bit opportunistic, taking advantage of Xuantian Palace's eagerness to save people, and taking the initiative in everything, he was able to achieve this point, but it was also enough to prove how terrifying his strength was.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Old Devil Hunmo's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>Then, Old Devil Hunmo said in a concentrated voice: "He discovered me."</p><p>The black-robed man was stunned for a moment before he understood the meaning of his master's words.</p><p>That person was not forced away by Xuantian Palace, but discovered his master's trail and chose to escape.</p><p>In other words, this was not all of his strength.</p><p>"This person…"</p><p>A cold light flashed in Old Devil Hunmo's eyes.</p><p>The fact that the other party could see through his trail reminded Old Devil Hunmo of the failed sneak attack in front of the Thousand Buddha Wall in the Pure Sea Sect, which directly led to a series of subsequent changes.</p><p>Now, the other party was showing an astonishing escape technique.</p><p>Such a character could be counted on the fingers of one hand in the entire Northern Sea.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo also recalled the battle for treasures in the Buddha Hall. That person's speed was also top-notch. As soon as he chased into the secret passage, that person had already escaped into the depths and detonated the Chiyan's seal.</p><p>Although that person was wrapped in black spiritual fire, concealing his aura, it did not prevent Old Devil Hunmo from associating them.</p><p>How could there be so many coincidences in the world, and he happened to encounter them all? This information was enough for Old Devil Hunmo to make a judgment.</p><p>At least, it was worth a try!</p><p>The sound of air being torn apart came from behind.</p><p>More Xuantian Palace Nascent Soul cultivators arrived.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo glanced back and forth, seeing that the two elders of Xuantian Palace were so incompetent. He snorted, and his shoulders shrugged, and the ghost spirit floated out from behind him.</p><p>The black-robed man felt inexplicably frightened by the ghost spirit's eerie and indifferent gaze, and quickly lowered his head.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo forced out a drop of essence blood and fed it to the ghost spirit, shouting in a low voice: "Go!"</p><p>He no longer concealed himself. He tapped the black bamboo staff in his hand, and his body transformed into a black light.</p><p>Shi Xue was worried about the sacred artifact. Feeling the powerful aura suddenly erupting behind her, her body suddenly stiffened.</p><p>Elders Mei and Lan were helplessly watching the sacred artifact fly away. They were equally horrified that Old Devil Hunmo was spying nearby, and quickly made way to the side, uncertain and suspicious.</p><p>The situation had long been beyond their control.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that ghost spirit.</p><p>The ghost spirit transformed into a cloud of ghostly mist, faintly stained with a layer of blood, and its speed was even faster than Old Devil Hunmo and Qin Sang, leaving a conspicuous trajectory in the void.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>Qin Sang easily shook off the Xuantian Palace elders, and then sensed the movements of Old Devil Hunmo and the ghost spirit.</p><p>"This old devil has finally made his move!"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the ghost spirit was approaching at an unimaginable speed, and his mind was shaken.</p><p>Then he discovered that, while flying, the cloud of ghostly mist was gradually shrinking, and its aura was getting weaker and weaker, as if it was exchanging speed for burning its main body.</p><p>"What's the use of this?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, secretly forming a hand seal. When the ghost spirit flew into attack range, he decisively struck out a Heavenly Lightning!</p><p>But he instinctively felt something was wrong and did not use his full strength, only probing.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Divine lightning descended, hitting the ghostly mist directly.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo, who was originally behind, actually walked out of the exploded ghost mist!</p>
