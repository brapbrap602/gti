<h1>Chapter 916:  Cultivating Body and Spirit</h1><p>Chapter 916:  Cultivating Body and Spirit</p><p>The elders and others were utterly demoralized, their fighting spirit completely gone.  Even wielding the enchanted artifact, they couldn't muster much strength.  Qin Sang's external manifestation and two-headed…  [creature name unclear, leaving as is] captured them for interrogation, while the two-headed… [creature name unclear, leaving as is] provided support for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Cult Master of the Sacrifice Demon Cave were locked in a fierce battle, the scene chaotic.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A figure was knocked back, stumbling.</p><p>The Cult Master of the Sacrifice Demon Cave's surprised voice echoed, "You're a body cultivator? This is the first time I've faced a body cultivator of such a high level. However, to think you can stop me with this little strength is a fool's dream."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Indeed, relying solely on my physical body, I am no match for you."</p><p>Before his words faded, Qin Sang's aura changed.  A brilliant green light erupted from his back, magnificent phoenix wings unfurling. With a slight flap, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of light, blocking the Cult Master's path.</p><p>His intention in fighting the old demon alone was to test the fruits of his years of arduous cultivation.  He hadn't yet broken through to the mid-third stage of the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* technique.  Earlier, relying solely on his physical body against the old demon, he had felt severely strained, showing signs of defeat after a single exchange.</p><p>After activating the Celestial Demon Transformation, Qin Sang's strength surged, but to defeat the old demon, this alone wasn't enough. He needed to unleash the true power of cultivating both body and spirit.</p><p>"Demonic energy?"</p><p>The Cult Master of the Sacrifice Demon Cave was startled.</p><p>Among the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Canglang Sea, possessing demonic energy was nothing unusual. But this level of demonic energy was something he had never witnessed before.</p><p>He could confirm that the cultivator was human, not a beast.</p><p>What shocked him even more was Qin Sang's speed.  After the wings appeared, his speed increased dramatically, surpassing even the fastest Foundation Establishment peak cultivators he had ever seen.</p><p>The Cult Master realized that unless he killed this person, he couldn't escape.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his spirit beast providing support and his composed demeanor, made the Cult Master frown.  His cultivation was clearly a realm higher, yet he felt a strange sense of unease.</p><p>The Cult Master involuntarily looked towards the distance, his companions still absent.</p><p>"Are you looking for these?"</p><p>Qin Sang gestured to the side.  A beautiful butterfly appeared out of thin air, its wings fluttering as it landed on Qin Sang's hand. Before it, a sphere of lightning hovered, containing several mosquito-like spirit insects, flying about wildly.</p><p>The Cult Master, cunning by nature, had secretly released multiple communication insects, all captured by the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>"Celestial Eye Butterfly!"</p><p>The Cult Master exclaimed, "Your life-bound insect? No, you're not a member of the Witch Clan, how dare you…"</p><p>A flicker of unusual light crossed Qin Sang's eyes.  "It seems you're quite knowledgeable about insect control, recognizing my Celestial Eye Butterfly as my life-bound insect at a glance. This makes it even more imperative that you cannot be spared."</p><p>The lightning sphere easily annihilated the insects. The Celestial Eye Butterfly flew into Qin Sang's embrace. Qin Sang tapped his foot, his figure vanishing into thin air, reappearing in an instant above the Cult Master.</p><p>Thousands of fist shadows descended upon the old demon.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>An astonishing aura descended from the heavens.</p><p>"To keep me here, you'll need to see if you have what it takes!"</p><p>A ferocious expression appeared on the Cult Master's face.  Since he couldn't shake this person off, he immediately abandoned all other thoughts, opening his mouth to unleash a ball of dark demonic light.</p><p>The demonic light shot up, exploding the moment it touched the fist shadows. The demonic light swept across the area like a raging tide.</p><p>Countless fist shadows were annihilated by the demonic light, which itself rapidly dissipated.</p><p>The two forces cancelled each other out, evenly matched.</p><p>When the demonic light dispersed, a green light appeared, trembling slightly before slowly separating to reveal Qin Sang, encased within his phoenix wings, unharmed by the demonic light's impact.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's figure appeared before the Cult Master, twisting slightly before delivering a powerful blow to the Cult Master's chest.</p><p>While the demonic light had momentarily held Qin Sang back, the Cult Master had already summoned his magic treasure – a small, ancient bronze bell. It spun rapidly, emitting a brilliant yellow light, forming a yellow bell shadow that enveloped the Cult Master.</p><p>Simultaneously, a blood-red blade flashed from the Cult Master's dantian, a strong, nauseating smell of blood filling the air.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The bell shadow was struck by the powerful punch, a clang of metal resonating as the bell trembled violently.</p><p>The figure of the Si Mo Dongzhu retreated swiftly, secretly incanting a spell as a blood-red blade shot through the air, aiming directly for Qin Sang's forehead with astonishing speed.</p><p>The timing was impeccable, striking as Qin Sang's strength waned.</p><p>Though the blood-red blade hurtled towards him, Qin Sang showed no fear. A light flashed from his brow, and his ebony sword shot forth, colliding with the blade.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sharp sound echoed as the ebony sword and the blood-red blade flew back. The ebony sword, being a low-grade magical artifact, was weaker than the blood-red blade, which the Si Mo Dongzhu had refined to mid-grade power.</p><p>The Si Mo Dongzhu roared in fury.  Grabbing his blade, his face contorted with rage.  The blade, his life-bound artifact, was losing its luster, its spiritual essence greatly diminished.</p><p>"What did you do?!" he bellowed.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  The Si Mo Dongzhu dared to clash his life-bound weapon with the ebony sword; Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate to retaliate. He unleashed the Blood-Soiled Radiance, striking the blood-red blade.</p><p>Without a word, he beat his wings again, simultaneously incanting a spell. In an instant, fist shadows and the ebony sword converged, almost engulfing the Si Mo Dongzhu. Before he could react, the ebony sword flickered, countless glittering sword lights dispersing among the fist shadows, indistinguishable from the real.</p><p>"Sword Light Divergence," the Si Mo Dongzhu muttered, a sense of numb resignation washing over him. His fears were confirmed.  This person was not only a cultivator of both body and magic, possessing life-bound insect Gu, but also mastered the incredible Sword Light Divergence, a divine ability coveted by countless sword cultivators.  Such strength would make him a prized member of any faction, yet he was hiding in this remote place, only to be encountered by the Si Mo Dongzhu.</p><p>*Dong dong…*</p><p>A continuous tremor shook the bell-like image on the Si Mo Dongzhu's body. To his horror, it shattered into countless fragments, exploding outwards.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't fully mastered Sword Light Divergence,  he hadn't focused his energies solely on it. However, compared to ten years ago, his swordsmanship had undoubtedly deepened.</p><p>The Si Mo Dongzhu's strength was only slightly superior to the black-robed cultivator from Dong Ming Island. With his superior swordsmanship and the Sword Light Divergence, Qin Sang was more than a match for him. After activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, he might still fall short against the Lu Headmaster or the Fang young man without using artifacts like the Star Snail, but defeating the Si Mo Dongzhu was achievable.</p><p>Now, with the Blood-Soiled Radiance as well, the outcome was never in doubt. After the bell-like image was destroyed, the Si Mo Dongzhu unleashed more artifacts, talismans, and attempted escape techniques, all to no avail.  Unable to win, unable to escape, the Si Mo Dongzhu despaired.</p><p>A storm of chaotic True Qi erupted, radiating strange light, obscuring the figures within.</p><p>Then, a scream pierced the air.</p><p>The storm slowly subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang's right arm pierced the Si Mo Dongzhu's left chest, his bloodstained hand clutching the shattered heart.</p>
