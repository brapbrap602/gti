<h1>Chapter 453: Noon</h1><p>The melee was a chaotic free-for-all.  Qin Sang couldn't count how many opponents he'd faced. All he could do was stay clearheaded, remain calm and cautious, accurately assess the situation, and absolutely avoid getting too far from his team.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The sharp sound of shattering drew Qin Sang's attention.  He saw that a corner of an opponent's golden shield had been smashed by Mu Yifeng's Nine-Flame Divine Blade. Several other magic weapons had struck the shield, leaving a terrifying crack running across its entire surface. It looked like it would shatter any moment.</p><p>The opponent, terrified, let out a cry and retreated in a panic.</p><p>The Nine-Flame Divine Blade glowed crimson. Mu Yifeng was about to lead a pursuit, but Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. He shouted, "Don't chase! Fall back!"</p><p>The opponent's apparent panic was deceptive; their formation remained intact. More importantly, Qin Sang keenly sensed that some enemies around them were subtly watching, positioned with uncanny precision.</p><p>Silently, a small, inconspicuous gap had been left open in front of them.  The trap, set at some unknown point, was ready to spring shut.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.  These were decoys! If they pursued aggressively, blinded by victory, they would walk straight into an ambush.  Qin Sang remembered Teng Zhaogang falling victim to a similar trap; he had been right there, and the memory was still vivid.</p><p>"We retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to Mu Yifeng, and they withdrew in an orderly manner.</p><p>Sure enough, seeing their retreat, many Tianxing League cultivators showed disappointment. The fleeing opponent stopped, trying to lure them back.</p><p>Thankfully, Mu Yifeng and the others obeyed him implicitly; otherwise, the consequences would have been disastrous.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly realized the reason: his squad had attracted too much attention.  Previously, he prioritized survival.  In the chaos of battle, everyone fought their own battles, and no one focused on him. That’s why he instructed his teammates to act with discretion. When using the ebony sword, he only targeted major threats and then immediately moved to another location, never allowing himself to become the focus of a concentrated attack. His reputation was built slowly, not through one decisive battle.</p><p>Now, with the powerful Mu Yifeng by his side, they were impossible to ignore.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions thwarted the Tianxing League's plan.  For a moment, their part of the battlefield fell strangely silent.</p><p>"Regroup!"</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to contact the other squad leaders, tightening their scattered formation before another round of fighting began.</p><p>...</p><p>A ray of light fell on his face. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, suddenly realizing it wasn't the light from a magic weapon—it was the morning sun!</p><p>He turned his head.  In the distant east, where the sky met the water, a fiery red glow appeared. The rising sun, still shy and demure amidst the dawn, seemed to be emerging from the depths of the water.</p><p>Qin Sang realized it was dawn! The battle had started late at night; had it lasted several hours? His mind was still filled with the intensity of the battle, somewhat dazed, when a sudden realization struck him. He looked up at the sky.</p><p>The battle between the Foundation Establishment cultivators hadn't stopped!</p><p>And that beam of light was still there.  *Star Hidden, Moon Concealed*.  In the sunlight, it seemed even brighter, a remarkable sight. However, the battlefield had moved north of the beam, giving Qin Sang a bad feeling.</p><p>Normally, it would be time to call a halt by now.  A night of fighting until dawn had yielded no clear advantage to either side. The Tianxing League had a slight edge, but the Xiao Han Domain's formation remained intact.  Continuing the fight would likely lead to both sides being completely exhausted before a victor emerged.</p><p>Both sides were weary after a night of intense combat.</p><p>"There should be an order by now," Qin Sang muttered, gazing at the battlefield of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, his movements with the Frostgold Sword alongside Mu Yifeng lackluster.</p><p>He miscalculated.  After waiting some time, the sky above remained clouded, with thunder and lightning, showing no sign of stopping.</p><p>This made Qin Sang nervous.  The thought that they might actually fight to the death filled him with dread.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang's expression changed, and after looking around, he sent a voice transmission to Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was startled and looked at Qin Sang inquiringly.</p><p>Qin Sang, with a serious expression, nodded.  After a brief exchange, Qin Sang claimed Mu Yifeng was too exhausted and needed to rest, replacing him with another team member. Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng would alternate rest periods, maintaining the battle's flow. It appeared that their squad's strength was drastically reduced and facing imminent danger, but in fact, everything was under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>The battle raged on, the lines blurring, the disciplined formations dissolving into chaotic melee.  From a distance, cultivators fought individually, a disorganized mob more than an army.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, her gaze shifting between the two battlefields, especially the one where the Foundation Establishment cultivators clashed.  She could discern no discernible strategy.</p><p>The sun rose.</p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p>Many cultivators were exhausted. The fighting, though less intense than at the start, was now a brutal stalemate. Qin Sang grew more cautious as casualties mounted.  Despite her foresight in conserving her strength, she felt strained, grateful she hadn't used the Ebony Sword.  The others were even worse off.</p><p>Time crawled, each moment agonizingly slow.</p><p>Hour followed hour.</p><p>When the sun reached its zenith, just past midday, a change occurred.</p><p>A point of light descended from the heavens above the Foundation Establishment battlefield.</p><p>Initially insignificant, even Qin Sang, who was carefully watching, missed it.  Only when the light grew larger, descending towards the dark clouds, did she notice.</p><p>Within the light, a silver talisman shimmered.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.  Eyes wide, she watched intently.</p><p>This was the first time such a talisman had appeared in three years of conflict. Who had sent it?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't alone in noticing. More and more cultivators looked up.</p><p>The talisman accelerated, plunging into the clouds, rapidly expanding until it reached its limit and silently shattered.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Instantly, the clouds dispersed, the lightning vanished.  The Foundation Establishment cultivators were finally visible.</p><p>They continued their fierce battle, their power undiminished.  True Foundation Establishment masters, they showed none of the exhaustion of the others. Each spell, each clash of magical weapons, still held terrifying power.</p><p>The talisman’s appearance, unexpected by all, caused a momentary pause in the fighting.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>A gentle breeze blew, a force even the Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't ignore.</p><p>Involuntarily, the combatants separated, the Xiaohan Domain forces pushed to the west, the Tianxing Alliance to the south, the light having fallen between them.</p><p>They stared at each other, weapons lowered.</p><p>Simultaneously, several indistinct figures appeared in the air.</p>
