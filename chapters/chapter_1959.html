<h1>Chapter 1950: Achieving Success in the Examinations</h1><p>Noon.</p><p>The urgent clatter of hooves echoed along the main road, kicking up a cloud of dust as three swift horses galloped into view.</p><p>The villagers of Seven Rows Village, seeking respite from the heat beneath the shade of the trees, couldn't help but recall the previous commotion upon seeing this scene.</p><p>It was said that Scholar Chen had been confronted by enemies at his door and nearly imprisoned.</p><p>The villagers immediately tensed, rising to their feet as one and gazing across the river. They saw the three riders indeed rein in their horses outside the bamboo grove, seemingly about to turn into it.</p><p>"Oh no! Trouble again!"</p><p>An old man slapped his thigh, his face etched with anxiety.</p><p>The others shared his apprehension.</p><p>Their respect for Chen Zhenqing was heartfelt, not solely due to his character.</p><p>Since Chen Zhenqing had established the school in Seven Rows Village, the village had reaped tangible benefits, offering generations of farmers a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Just then, one of the three riders raised a gong high and struck it with force.</p><p>The trio dismounted, tethering their horses by the roadside.  Beating the gong, they walked and shouted, "Please ask Master Chen to come out! Congratulations on your success in the examinations!"</p><p>Their cries carried across the river.</p><p>"Success? What success?"</p><p>"Oh! I remember Three Dog mentioning a few days ago that Scholar Chen had gone to take the examinations again. This means he succeeded! He's going to be an official!"</p><p>"What rank comes after Scholar?"</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers chattered excitedly, the gong's reverberations attracting more and more people, who trotted towards the school to join the excitement.</p><p>Outside the school.</p><p>"Auspicious news for the esteemed Master Chen Zhenqing of this noble house! He has achieved the highest rank in the provincial examination, the Jieyuan, topping the Laurel List and ascending to the head of the Golden List!"</p><p>The three messengers presented the official announcement with beaming smiles.</p><p>Chen Zhenqing accepted it, his expression as impassive as it had been with previous failures. He merely sighed softly.</p><p>Madam Chen, who had accompanied him, understood her husband's heart. Gently grasping his hand, she softly instructed their servant, "Mingyan, fetch the celebratory coins."</p><p>"Yes, Madam!"</p><p>Mingyan departed, overjoyed.</p><p>Seemingly anticipating Chen Zhenqing's success, the Chen household had already made preparations.</p><p>The school grounds quickly filled with a throng of people, their faces radiant with joy as they crowded around, clamoring for celebratory coins.</p><p>Not only the villagers of Seven Rows Village, but also gentry and prominent families from Qinggui Town and Jinyuan County arrived, even the County Magistrate himself came to offer congratulations.</p><p>Even without his connection to the Assistant Grand Secretary, Chen Zhenqing, as the Jieyuan, was practically guaranteed to pass the metropolitan examination and become a Jinshi.</p><p>The festivities continued late into the night.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>The newly appointed Jieyuan, however, did not remain at home to entertain guests. Instead, he arranged for food and wine to be sent to Green Ram Temple.</p><p>In the upper pavilion.</p><p>The food and wine were laid out.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yulang attended them.</p><p>"Now we can no longer call you Scholar Chen, but Master Chen."</p><p>Qin Sang raised his cup to Chen Zhenqing with a smile.</p><p>"Daoist, please don't mock me. I'm well aware of how much water there is in this Jieyuan title."</p><p>Chen Zhenqing took a large gulp of wine and sighed deeply.</p><p>"Succeeding in the provincial examination is not a bad thing. This is a stepping stone to advancement. You finally have the opportunity to realize your ambitions, why be so disheartened?" Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>"Ambitions?"</p><p>Having drunk little, Chen Zhenqing seemed somewhat intoxicated, his gaze distant. "My teacher is advanced in years. Though he has returned to the court, there's a sense of time running out. Among my teacher's disciples, I am not exceptional, and having been out of office for many years, I am far inferior to others in terms of official duties and political affairs. I can't assist my teacher much."</p><p>He paused, then said in a low voice, "I've decided that if I am fortunate enough to succeed in the metropolitan examination, I will request a posting to a border county. To govern a region and benefit the people, I only hope that after a hundred years, there will still be people who remember the name Chen Zhenqing!"</p><p>He glanced at Yulang and Xiao Wu. "I will soon be taking my family to the capital for the metropolitan examination. After this parting, I fear it will be difficult to return. My only concern is for these students."</p><p>Yulang's eyes reddened.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat quietly beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Over the years, they had spent countless days with Chen Zhenqing. This bond was not easily severed.</p><p>Qin Sang discerned Chen Zhenqing's thoughts and smiled faintly. "Brother, if you have something to say, speak plainly."</p><p>"Could Yulang take over the school?"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing's words startled Yulang.</p><p>"Ah? Me?"</p><p>Yulang had never imagined his teacher would entrust the school to him. He abruptly stood up, pointing at himself.</p><p>"There are indeed many who wish to succeed me, some genuinely talented. However, their intentions cannot be hidden from me. They likely wouldn't be content to remain in the countryside as a teacher. Yulang's character, knowledge, and talent are evident to all, more than sufficient to be a teacher! If he weren't averse to officialdom, we, master and disciple, would surely ascend the Golden List together, a tale to be told!"</p><p>Chen Zhenqing looked at Qin Sang with expectant eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was Yulang's true master. Without Qin Sang's consent, all was for naught.</p><p>At that moment, someone seeking medicine entered the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed himself up from the table and addressed Yulang, "Your master will not interfere. Think carefully about whether you can shoulder this responsibility."</p><p>…</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Midsummer.</p><p>The sound of reading resonated from the schoolhouse.</p><p>A cool breeze rustled through the bamboo grove, mitigating the summer heat. Yulang, now a teacher himself, completed his rounds in the elementary school and ascended the bamboo tower.</p><p>From the tower came the sounds of lively debate.</p><p>Not quarreling, but a group of scholars discussing the classics.</p><p>Scholar Chen had departed, yet the number of students in the school hadn't diminished. Even scholars from the county town preferred to come here to compose poetry and engage in literary pursuits.</p><p>"Brother Yulang is here! Come and judge our debate!"</p><p>Seeing Yulang, the group swarmed around him.</p><p>Yulang, though a teacher, was of similar age to most present, so they addressed each other as brothers.</p><p>Finally extricating himself from the crowd, Yulang walked towards the window.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat there, chin resting on her hands, gazing out the window.</p><p>A cool aura emanated from her, keeping others at a distance.</p><p>After *that incident*, Yulang had noticed a subtle distance in his senior sister's interactions with outsiders.</p><p>And since the Yan Kingdom forbade women from taking the imperial examinations, her old friends gradually left the school, leaving fewer and fewer behind.</p><p>Fortunately, she hadn't become disheartened and withdrawn like before, but remained at the school.</p><p>He hoped she would eventually overcome it.</p><p>Yulang sighed inwardly, producing a letter. "Senior Sister, a letter from Teacher has arrived. He requested a posting and has gone to Danynag County in Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou."</p><p>"Danyang County, bordering the Great Liang Kingdom?"</p><p>Xiao Wu accepted the letter, reading it carefully.</p><p>"Yes! After the devastating war decades ago, the Yan Kingdom and the Great Liang Kingdom, nearly overrun by neighboring states, recognized the situation and agreed to a truce, each focusing on recovery.  Now, the rulers of both nations are not warmongers. Although Danyang County is on the border, there shouldn't be any major issues.  Besides, Teacher has the protective jade pendant we gave him, and I plan to contact the City God of Zhongning Prefecture through Yu Cheng huang. The local spirits can offer assistance if needed."</p><p>Hearing that Yulang had already considered everything thoroughly, Xiao Wu said no more.</p><p>When school was dismissed, the two, as usual, slung their book bags over their shoulders and walked back to Green Ram Temple, bathed in the setting sun.</p><p>As they passed through Seven Rows Village, the villagers greeted them warmly, some even asking Yulang when he intended to take the imperial examinations.</p><p>Yulang hesitated, only speaking after they had left the village.  "Senior Sister, I heard news of Meng Yusu today."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Xiao Wu looked over, her expression unchanged.</p><p>"Meng Yusu seems to have gone mad. The Meng family moved out of Qinggui Town, I don't know where they went. Master has cured many cases of madness, the Meng family must be too ashamed to ask Master for help."</p><p>Yulang snorted.</p><p>After *that incident*, they hadn't specifically inquired about Meng Yusu's whereabouts.</p><p>Meng Yusu had reportedly been taken away by the authorities and hadn't reappeared at the school.  He didn't know when he'd been released, but he'd likely suffered considerably.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Xiao Wu responded indifferently.</p><p>Yulang longed to ask his senior sister what she now thought of Meng Yusu, but his lips moved without uttering the words.</p><p>Returning to Green Ram Temple.</p><p>The temple was empty.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the underground chamber, meditating on the main altar.</p><p>Lightning crackled around him, arcs of electricity dancing around his form.</p><p>Most striking was the main altar beneath him, which had become transparent, its interior a swirling vortex of countless thunderbolts, sparking and flashing.</p><p>Within this tempest of lightning, a single point of light shone with blinding intensity. From the outside, it appeared only as a speck, the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>Yet, this speck seemed to hold infinite transformations.</p><p>And this point of light was the very same mysterious Thunder Rune that Qin Sang had been unable to decipher, the heart of the entire altar!</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>…</p><p>The main altar, along with the entire underground chamber, trembled.</p><p>Within the altar, in the world composed of lightning, bolts collided and devoured each other in a ceaseless, apocalyptic spectacle.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang formed a hand seal, silently reciting an incantation. A bolt of lightning shot from his fingertip.</p><p>The lightning struck the altar beneath him, penetrating deep within.</p><p>Like pulling a single hair and affecting the whole body, the intrusion of this lightning caused the already chaotic thunderous energy to erupt into complete turmoil.</p><p>After being discharged, the lightning bolt didn't vanish.</p><p>One end remained connected to Qin Sang's fingertip, the other stirring the sea of thunder within the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang held the lightning as a musician plucks the strings of a zither.  The power in his hand fluctuated rhythmically, causing the lightning to undulate.</p><p>In this manner, the trembling lightning gradually probed towards the core of the altar, inching closer to the point of light.</p><p>As the lightning drew nearer to the light.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. Without hesitation, he dispersed the lightning at his fingertip with a sharp 'crack'.</p><p>Simultaneously, the main altar shuddered violently.</p><p>The thunderous energy, as if finally finding a release, surged out of the altar, following the path of the lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang bore the brunt of it, but he had been prepared.</p><p>His body floated into the air, his hands transforming into palms of thunder. He met the surging energy, the two forces merging seamlessly in his palms.</p><p>Slowly but firmly, he pressed his palms downwards, finally sealing them against the altar, suppressing the rampaging thunderous energy.</p><p>The lightning vanished abruptly, plunging the underground chamber into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang drifted back down, gazing at the altar, lost in thought for a moment. He murmured, "Still not quite there."</p><p>Then, his lips moved slightly.</p><p>Above ground.</p><p>Luo Hou lay curled up on a giant cushion.</p><p>For years, it had been almost constantly asleep, but today Qin Sang had awakened it.</p><p>Tai Yi, mimicking Luo Hou, occupied a side hall for closed-door cultivation, consolidating its cultivation, was also roused.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The two demons descended into the underground chamber, bowing in unison.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Greetings, Lord Envoy!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, appraising the two demons.</p><p>He sensed little restless energy emanating from Tai Yi.</p><p>As for Luo Hou, having taken over a new body and refined it from scratch, the process typically required a considerable amount of time.</p><p>Thanks to the pills bestowed by Qin Sang, treasures hoarded by a Void Refinement demon, Luo Hou's progress had been remarkably swift, changing daily. He believed it wouldn't be long before it fully recovered.</p><p>"I have a task for you. Go down the mountain."</p><p>Qin Sang flicked a bolt of lightning from his finger.</p><p>The lightning exploded before the two demons, revealing a diagram composed primarily of points of light.</p><p>This was the Altar Formation diagram Qin Sang had deduced through his comprehension of the main altar.</p><p>The most prominent point represented the main altar, while the others indicated the locations of the subsidiary altars.</p><p>"Split up and use this formation diagram to locate all the subsidiary altars!"</p><p>Qin Sang commanded gravely.</p><p>His calculations weren't entirely accurate; there might be omissions. It was now up to the two demons to verify each location, while he continued his deductions here.</p><p>The reason he couldn't access the 'point of light' was the incomplete formation diagram.</p><p>Once he possessed the complete Altar Formation diagram, Qin Sang was confident he could begin repairing the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sending forth several streaks of light.  "Some of the altars might be in Cloud Capital Mountain and Duskfall Mountain. Luo Hou, you are not adept at遁术, earth escape techniques so take the Earth Travelling Boat. Tai Yi, your true form is a rune. By activating a Thunder Rune, you should be able to control the power of all the Thunder Runes.  With these for protection, you can handle any situation, unless you encounter a Void Refinement cultivator."</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Seeing the gravity of Qin Sang's demeanor, the two demons dared not show any negligence.  Memorizing the formation diagram, they accepted the task and departed.</p><p>Flying out of Green Ram Temple, the two demons briefly conferred, then separated, one heading east, the other west.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled out from the main hall. Yulang, who was closing the temple gates, quickly addressed him as Master.</p><p>Qin Sang remarked, "These past two years, as a teacher, your temperament has become much more composed."</p><p>Yulang, surprised by his master's praise, almost froze, a blush creeping up his cheeks. He could only offer a shy chuckle, completely shattering his composed demeanor.</p><p>This disciple was the one Qin Sang cared for the most. Ever since Yulang entered the Immortal Sect, he had been constantly by Qin Sang's side. Qin Sang had even specially prepared medicinal baths for him.</p><p>In a way, Yulang benefited from his association with Xiao Wu; otherwise, he wouldn't be much better off than his senior brothers.</p><p>The downside was that Yulang primarily interacted with mortals.</p><p>He'd never experienced the trials of the cultivation world, the life-and-death struggles and betrayals between cultivators. His experiences were diametrically opposed to Qin Sang's.</p><p>Constantly sheltered under Qin Sang's wings, he retained a childlike innocence and was easily distracted.  If not for the medicinal baths, his cultivation wouldn't have progressed so rapidly.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang let him settle down, which would be beneficial for Yulang.</p><p>"This is a Foundation Establishment Pill, enough for your breakthrough. During this time, settle the school affairs, then focus on establishing your foundation."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade bottle. "After your breakthrough, I may need to enter seclusion frequently. You and Xiao Wu will manage Green Ram Temple."</p><p>Yulang's initial joy turned to awe as he solemnly accepted the jade bottle.  "This disciple will not disappoint Master's expectations."</p><p>"Go."</p><p>Watching his disciple, Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>After Foundation Establishment, he would need to select a cultivation method for Yulang.</p><p>Qin Sang had observed Yulang's journey over the years. He hadn't discouraged Yulang's passion for martial arts, wanting to see if he could forge his own path.</p><p>Of course, not now.</p><p>Only after attaining a certain level of cultivation, if Yulang's enthusiasm remained undimmed, would there be a sliver of possibility.</p><p>However, given Yulang's fascination with martial arts, would the path of body refinement be more suitable?
