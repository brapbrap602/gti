<h1>Chapter 356: An Old Friend's Plight</h1><p>Suddenly, a voice echoed from within the room, "Not yet seventy, and you've worn yourself down like this?"</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>"Someone…"</p><p>A stranger suddenly appeared in the room.  Madam Wu's face turned pale, and she was about to call for guards, but Wu Chuanzong stopped her.</p><p>She looked at her husband in astonishment.  She had always known him as a powerful man, capable of concealing his emotions, yet now his face was flushed with excitement, his eyes brimming with tears!</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Wu Chuanzong rose abruptly and, to Madam Wu's shock, knelt down with a thud. "Master! Is it really you? Chuanzong is finally able to see you before he dies!"</p><p>Then, Madam Wu's vision blurred, and another figure appeared before her.</p><p>The man was remarkably young, appearing to be only in his twenties. However, his presence was commanding, making it impossible to dismiss him as merely a young man.</p><p>Madam Wu's mouth fell open in astonishment.</p><p>She suddenly remembered the portrait; the man in the painting looked exactly like this!</p><p>When they parted ways, he was twenty-one, and Wu Chuanzong was nineteen, both full of youthful vigor.</p><p>Upon his return, he remained young, while Wu Chuanzong was now grey-haired.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart warmed at Wu Chuanzong's heartfelt gesture. He gently helped the kneeling man to his feet, seeing the old man's tears.</p><p>"Get up!"</p><p>Qin Sang, touched by Wu Chuanzong's emotion, patted his shoulder gently.  He had so much to say, but didn't know where to begin.</p><p>"I hear you're now the Grand Tutor, attending court in full regalia, even exempt from bowing before His Majesty. Why kneel before a simple hermit like me…?"</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Wu Chuanzong grasped Qin Sang's arms firmly. "Without you, Master, Chuanzong wouldn't be where he is today! Your kindness is like a rebirth.  You are Chuanzong's parents in every sense of the word—of course I kneel!"</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang finally managed to calm the deeply moved Wu Chuanzong.</p><p>They sat facing each other. Wu Chuanzong sent his wife to bring tea.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang's youthful appearance, Wu Chuanzong expressed his heartfelt joy. "Master, are you already a celestial being?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly and shook his head. "I'm at most a cultivator. Only after entering the cultivation world did I realize it's no earthly paradise; it's not as beautiful as one imagines. There's deception, there's treachery. Cultivators are still people, dream chasers, pursuing an unattainable dream…"</p><p>Given Wu Chuanzong's experience, he wasn't too surprised to hear about the cultivation world, only remarking, "Indeed, the world is the same everywhere. However, Master is blessed, and you will surely transcend!"</p><p>"Let's hope so."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly. His spiritual sense swept over Wu Chuanzong, and he frowned. "You're covered in injuries, from years of campaigning? You've drained your body.  No matter how high your martial arts skill, it's useless; your inner energy has become a burden, depleting your remaining potential. Extend your arm…"</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised to discover Wu Chuanzong was a peak late-stage martial artist, on the verge of a breakthrough to the next level.</p><p>Given his position and responsibilities, the man still managed to maintain such skill, a testament to his diligence.</p><p>Wu Chuanzong obeyed. "No wonder I feel refreshed after every practice, yet my body deteriorates day by day.  I thought it was just old age…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then cautiously channeled a thread of spiritual energy into Wu Chuanzong's meridians.</p><p>His age and injuries were taking their toll.</p><p>To put it mildly, Wu Chuanzong's body was nearing the end; without treatment, he might not have two years left.  Even treatment had to be extremely cautious, lest it harm him further.</p><p>At this moment, Madam Wu entered with the tea, her face filled with anticipation and excitement. She slowed her steps, afraid to disturb Qin Sang, and carefully approached.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully guided his spiritual energy along Wu Chuanzong's meridians, gently repairing them.  Unfortunately, Wu Chuanzong's age and physical condition prevented a breakthrough.</p><p>An hour passed before Qin Sang finished.</p><p>The tea had long gone cold.</p><p>Madam Wu clasped her hands tightly, ignoring her husband's urging glances, anxiously watching Qin Sang, waiting for his assessment.</p><p>"Madam Wu, please sit."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a familiar look in Madam Wu's brow. He suddenly remembered—she was the girl who had almost been violated by Wang Liu. Wu Chuanzong's kindness had unexpectedly led to a happy marriage.</p><p>"Take this bottle of pills. Take one pill, divided into three doses, for three pills total. It should heal most of your old injuries."</p><p>Some losses are irreplaceable, and you are not young anymore.  Avoid excessive exertion of your inner energy in the future.  Mrs. Wu should also take one of these pills to improve her health and longevity...”</p><p>Qin Sang produced a vial of healing pills, similar in effect to the Water Dew Pills.  The Han family would bestow some health-tonifying pills, but to avoid disrupting the mortal realm's order, their quality was far inferior to the Water Dew Pills.</p><p>These pills, however, were now useless to him. He had obtained them from the man in the straw hat in the Bagua Forbidden Ground, and only a few remained.  Thankfully he had them, otherwise, a better pill might have overwhelmed Wu Chuanzong's mortal body.</p><p>"Thank you, sir!"</p><p>Wu Chuanzong and his wife rose and bowed.</p><p>After the treatment, Wu Chuanzong felt significantly lighter and was overjoyed.</p><p>"Sit down and talk!"</p><p>Qin Sang held Wu Chuanzong back, saying, "Tell me about the others.  How are Old Yue, Bai Jianglan, Shui Houzi, and the rest...?"</p><p>Wu Chuanzong handed the jade vial containing the pills to Mrs. Wu, who immediately clutched it as a precious treasure.</p><p>"Old Yue, during the night of the palace revolt, was seriously wounded saving the late Emperor and later retired.</p><p>"General Bai rose to become the commander of the Imperial Guard.  He retired at fifty-eight due to illness, lived in the secondary capital, and passed away at sixty-seven. The late Emperor, remembering his meritorious service, showed great favor to his descendants. However, Commander Bai strictly forbade his descendants from joining the military, encouraging them to pursue commerce or government service instead. The Bai family has prospered greatly.</p><p>"Shui Houzi, after your departure, achieved great merit, was ennobled as Prince Ning, and stationed to guard your hometown, formerly Ning State, now renamed Jiangzhou Prefecture by the late Emperor.</p><p>"Zhang Wenkui and the others, all benefited from your legacy and enjoyed the late Emperor's trust, each achieving considerable success.</p><p>"And the Qin family..."</p><p>Hearing Wu Chuanzong suddenly mention the Qin family, Qin Sang paused, but did not interrupt.</p><p>"Your parents and elder brother and sister-in-law all enjoyed a long and peaceful life. I did not reveal your whereabouts to them, but they must have suspected something.</p><p>"Your elder and second brothers each have a son.  Both are highly successful and now hold prominent positions, ensuring the Qin family's continued prosperity.</p><p>"The Qin family's descendants are exceptionally talented and have a bright future."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "You've worked hard!"</p><p>Having lived in the mortal world, he understood how difficult it was for a family like the Qins, with no initial foundation, to achieve such prominence in a few decades.</p><p>Without Wu Chuanzong's dedicated support, the Qin family would never have reached this level.</p>
