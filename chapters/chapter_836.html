<h1>Chapter 828: Freedom</h1><p>Qin Sang still had three immature Blood Fruits. Their combined potency was enough for a breakthrough.  Trading one for a late Core Formation stage demon beast's core was a good deal. He was eighty percent sure he could subdue the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>The Blood Fruit was right in front of it, incredibly tempting.</p><p>The opportunity for a breakthrough was fleeting. If missed, who knew how long it would take for the next one? Such a chance was hard to come by.</p><p>But something unexpected happened.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent, after failing to advance again, lay motionless on the ground and slowly closed its eyes.  It allowed its demonic power to wane, never once swallowing the Blood Fruit. It had resisted the temptation, preferring to forgo the breakthrough rather than submit.</p><p>"Freedom…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, somewhat stunned.</p><p>As a cultivator, Qin Sang was accustomed to seeing subdued demon beasts, especially those below the Transformation stage.  Their intelligence hadn't fully developed, so their own desires were never considered.</p><p>Most cultivators made young demon beasts submit from an early age, raising them as their own.</p><p>Only incredibly powerful cultivators, or those with special beast-taming techniques, could forcibly subdue adult demon beasts. Qin Sang lacked such a technique and could only entice the Twin-Headed Serpent with treasures.</p><p>After years together, Qin Sang knew the Twin-Headed Serpent was intelligent, far beyond ordinary beasts. But it had never consumed Emperor Flow Nectar. He never expected it to resist its instincts for "freedom."</p><p>Or perhaps, it was confident in its own ability to break through.</p><p>The Blood Fruit's potency gradually dissipated. The Twin-Headed Serpent's breathing steadied, showing signs of exhaustion as it lay there lazily.</p><p>Clearly, it had failed.</p><p>The bulge on its neck hadn't completely disappeared.  Though the breakthrough was unsuccessful, the momentary enlightenment brought significant benefits, boosting its strength considerably.</p><p>Including its innate abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Twin-Headed Serpent's aura. He secretly thought that demon beasts like the Twin-Headed Serpent, with powerful bloodlines, were already stronger than cultivators of the same realm. Now, it probably wouldn't fear even an ordinary late Core Formation cultivator in a one-on-one fight.</p><p>"Since you've made up your mind, I won't force you. This Blood Fruit can be yours for now.  When you agree to my terms, it's still yours."</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the fruit and said calmly.</p><p>If the Twin-Headed Serpent refused to submit, there was nothing he could do. You can't force affection.</p><p>With the breakthrough failed, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't let it go easily.</p><p>This highly talented, peak mid-Core Formation demon beast was the strongest his Mixed Essence Concentric Rings could control. Such beasts were incredibly rare, and even if found, difficult to subdue.</p><p>"It wouldn't still remember my earlier promise to release it after it reached late Core Formation… It's been fooled by my cultivation speed, overestimating my talent."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was a bit strange. Without the Ten Sacred Trees, his cultivation would soon stagnate. It was foreseeable that, at least until the next Seven Kills Palace opened and he found the ancient teleportation formation, the Twin-Headed Serpent's chances of advancement were slim.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, the Twin-Headed Serpent snorted, disdaining the allure of the fruit.</p><p>"Fine, may it help you break through sooner…"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the serpent, put away the fruit, and went about his own business.</p><p>As it turned out, the opportunity for a breakthrough was indeed elusive.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent wandered around the cave restlessly, even sneaking into Qin Sang's spirit gathering formation.  Six months passed in a flash, with no progress.</p><p>It was becoming increasingly frustrated, roaring at the moon and stars every night as if questioning the heavens.  Annoyed, Qin Sang stored it within the Mixed Essence Concentric Rings, forcing it into a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang's life was fulfilling.</p><p>Refining his external avatar, cultivating, body refinement, and nurturing spirit insects kept him busy.</p><p>A month ago, the Auspicious Peace Auction House delivered the spirit herbs he'd requested for cultivating Skyeye Butterflies.  Several herbs in the recipe were even more precious than Six-Petal Butterfly Violet.  Fortunately, he'd managed to find them all.</p><p>The price, of course, was exorbitant.</p><p>He'd already spent most of his savings gathering materials for the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterflies' appetites were bottomless. With these big spenders around, Qin Sang felt increasingly strained.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fat Silkworm could find its own food.  It ate slowly, falling into a deep sleep after each small bite. The amethyst would sustain it for decades.</p><p>"At this rate, it looks like I'll have to go back to my old trade and earn money through refining. Alchemist Yi keeps inviting me to join the auction house, but I haven't refined any magic treasures, and refining magic tools only earns meager profits.  Now, with a piece of high-grade spirit stone, I can try setting up a spirit array to refine a few Ten Yama Banners.  Once refined, my tool refining skills will also improve significantly…"</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang flipped his hand and retrieved a high-grade spirit stone.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he cleared the clutter from his cave and took out the materials for the array.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>A pile of various materials lay on the ground, all quite valuable.</p><p>Fortunately, a large portion consisted of various demon bones and beast hides, with stringent requirements for五行 (Five Elements) synergy. There were also demon beast spirit essences.</p><p>Sealing the spirit essences within the banner poles was crucial for later condensing spirit threads and weaving the soul banners.</p><p>These items were difficult to gather in the Small Cold Realm. Even Grand Ancestor Kui Yin, a Nascent Soul ancestor, had spent considerable effort back then.</p><p>But in the Boundless Sea, as long as one had enough spirit stones, anything could be bought.</p><p>The other materials were the difficult ones. It took the Auspicious Peace Auction House a long time to gather them for Qin Sang.</p><p>After checking the materials and confirming nothing was missing, Qin Sang took out the Profound Iron Pillars and set them aside. Then, he categorized the materials and began to work.</p><p>The spirit array was extremely complex, an ancient formation Grand Ancestor Kui Yin found in ancient texts.</p><p>Qin Sang first refined the various materials and then arranged them into the formation. After several hours of work, the array began to take shape.</p><p>Three days later, the array was finally complete.</p><p>His cave was now occupied by a five-colored formation.</p><p>The completed array appeared seamless, the original forms of the materials indistinguishable. It looked to be made of white jade, with openings around the edges for inserting mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p>However, the center required a high-grade spirit stone for activation.</p><p>Above the array, five-colored lights alternated, representing the Five Elements power emanating from the various materials. Once activated, these powers would converge towards the center according to the rules of the formation.</p><p>The Profound Iron Pillars would be placed there.</p><p>He would refine more Ten Yama Banners than Grand Ancestor Kui Yin.</p><p>The previous method of arranging ten banners might not unleash the full power of the magic treasure. It was best to find a more suitable formation, and the refining process should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Since returning from the Seven Kills Palace, Qin Sang had been pondering this matter and had some ideas.</p><p>However, this was something to consider when weaving the soul banners later. Now, he just needed to focus on refining the banner poles.</p>
