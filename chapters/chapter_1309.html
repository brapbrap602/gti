<h1>Chapter 1301: The Rendezvous</h1><p>In the void, seven-colored lights intertwined, obscuring everything else. This was the manifestation of a powerful restriction, not only blocking vision but also possessing formidable power.  Qin Sang, within the restriction, felt as if immersed in a world of neon lights.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards a mass of purple light ahead and launched a sword strike.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A Xuan Pagoda flew towards the purple light, transforming into a towering shadow that slammed down!  Sword and pagoda struck simultaneously.</p><p>The purple light shattered.</p><p>The rainbow light dissipated, and the scene before them changed abruptly as they broke through another layer of restriction. At the same time, Qin Sang felt a sudden warning and expertly dodged to the side.</p><p>The next moment, a tidal wave of attacks surged towards them.</p><p>Blades flashed, swords danced, and countless spells rained down.</p><p>Individually, none of these attacks posed a threat to Qin Sang, but with all of them arriving at once, amplified by the array, even he had to evade their sharp edges.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his tortoise shell shield, holding it in front of him.</p><p>*Dong dong dong…*</p><p>The tortoise shell shield vibrated, blocking all attacks.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang and Qing Jun simultaneously received a message from Daoist Zhenyi.  Braving the enemy's attacks, they flashed through the array to find Daoist Zhenyi.</p><p>Lord Tongyou was faster.</p><p>Once everyone assembled, Daoist Zhenyi urgently said, "I've just received word.  Our informant, intending to sabotage the city defenders and shut down the protective city array, was unfortunately exposed and is now being pursued.  The rest of you hold the array here; please come with me to provide support. He holds a high position and is intimately familiar with the secrets of the Abyss of Sin; he cannot be lost!"</p><p>"Daoist, your informant hidden in the Abyss of Sin…is actually a Yuan Ying expert?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked after hearing this.</p><p>Only a Yuan Ying cultivator could accomplish such things and escape even after exposure.  No wonder Daoist Zhenyi's intelligence was so well-informed; he could even buy off a Yuan Ying expert!</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi nodded.</p><p>"It's unnecessary to hide it now. The one infiltrating the Abyss of Sin is Daoist Qu Huan.  I secretly sent a group of children to the Abyss of Sin, to be accepted by various sects there.  Daoist Qu was the one who hid the deepest.  I never imagined he would endure hardship and humiliation in enemy territory, under immense pressure, yet still manage to break through to Yuan Ying."</p><p>"Him!"</p><p>Lord Tongyou frowned deeply, "I couldn't have guessed he had this kind of relationship with you, Daoist. One of my disciples died at Qu Huan's hands, utterly annihilated!"</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi's expression didn't change.  "Daoist Qu was also acting under duress.  He was constantly under the watchful eyes of countless people, risking exposure at any moment. I wouldn't contact this informant unless absolutely necessary; otherwise, he couldn't have remained hidden under Ye Laomo's nose for so long. The intelligence Daoist Qu provided was always crucial. For example, this time, if it weren't for him, we would only have received ambiguous information by now, just setting off from Caishi City."</p><p>Lord Tongyou coldly snorted, "This Lord naturally understands priorities. If Qu Huan truly has merit, let's forget about that incident!"</p><p>That disciple had been one of Lord Tongyou's most valued, lost due to a momentary oversight in battle, hence his lingering resentment.</p><p>However, compared to Qu Huan's secret, this grudge was insignificant.</p><p>The four of them briefly conferred, then their figures flashed, disappearing into the depths of the spirit array.</p><p>…</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A protective treasure shattered.</p><p>Qu Huan's figure flickered, his face flushed an unnatural red, which he forcibly suppressed.  Ignoring the pain of his broken treasure, he flew outward with urgency, inwardly cursing the delayed arrival of his support.</p><p>Though he had prepared, being pursued by so many cultivators, he was nearing exhaustion.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A gust of evil wind struck, sending a chill down Qu Huan's spine.  Without hesitation, he threw out a talisman.</p><p>The talisman shattered, bursting with green light, transforming into a large green bell that enveloped Qu Huan.</p><p>The next moment, a skull appeared in the evil wind, opening its maw to bite Qu Huan, but its teeth met the bell with a loud *dong*.  The recoil sent the skull reeling, letting out a shriek.</p><p>However, Qu Huan's face showed no relief; this was his last protective treasure. If the talisman's power ran out before his support arrived, his situation would become extremely perilous.</p><p>The skull wailed and flew into the sleeve of a tall, thin cultivator.</p><p>"Chase!"</p><p>Feng Laoguai and the others arrived, about to surround Qu Huan, when a wave of energy suddenly emanated from above, followed by thousands upon thousands of silver threads, raining down like a storm.</p><p>"Careful! That's Daoist Zhenyi's Qianyu Dust Whisk!"</p><p>The thin cultivator was startled, loudly warning the others.</p><p>Meanwhile, they heard a thunderclap and the whistling of swords, followed by ominous thunder from one side and a sword flash across the sky, its light as swift as a shooting star.</p><p>A tower's silhouette shimmered faintly amidst the silver threads.</p><p>"The Five-Element Pagoda, the Yin Thunder Gourd, the Ebony Sword…"</p><p>Feng Laoguai gasped.  Years of warfare had made them intimately familiar with these artifacts and their owners.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance's four top experts had arrived!</p><p>Seeing this, they knew they couldn't kill Qu Huan before these four, so they abandoned the pursuit, their figures flashing as they retreated to defend the city.</p><p>'Whizz! Whizz!'</p><p>The threads twisted, ensnaring Feng Laoguai.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi wanted to capture one more, and Qin Sang and the others understood, aiming their artifacts at Feng Laoguai, coordinating with Qian Yu's whisk to subdue him.</p><p>Feng Laoguai felt a sudden warning, his demonic body tensing.</p><p>Immediately, a huge demonic phantom detached itself, roaring to the heavens, ferociously powerful, but Qian Yu's whisk only entangled the phantom.</p><p>The others reacted swiftly, counterattacking with their artifacts to rescue Feng Laoguai and return to Yu City.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qing Jun seemed to have noticed something, showing a look of doubt.</p><p>"What is it?" Qin Sang asked, turning his head.</p><p>Qing Jun stared at Feng Laoguai's retreating back. "Feng Laoguai isn't quite right. I've fought him before, and his cultivation seems to have regressed…weakened."</p><p>"Maybe he was injured during the siege of Ye Laomo."</p><p>Qin Sang speculated.</p><p>"Doesn't seem so."</p><p>Qing Jun slowly shook his head.</p><p>In this clash, both sides disengaged quickly with no losses, but they knew the most brutal battle was yet to come.</p><p>Having driven off the pursuers, Qin Sang and the three others immediately went to see Qu Huan.  They had too many questions about this sudden turn of events; only Qu Huan could provide answers.</p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoists, for your assistance."</p><p>Qu Huan, relieved to be safe, bowed his thanks.</p><p>"Daoist Qu has rendered great service, and we naturally couldn't allow a meritorious individual to be harmed! Welcome back, Daoist Qu!" Daoist Zhenyi stroked his long beard, his tone subtly triumphant.</p><p>A hidden piece they had planted years ago, once thought to be lost, unexpectedly yielded such incredible power upon activation.</p><p>The group exchanged greetings with Qu Huan.  They were all familiar faces, some even having clashed on the battlefield before, requiring little introduction.</p><p>Since they were all allies, any past grievances were naturally forgotten.</p><p>Immediately afterward, they eagerly sought answers to their questions.</p>
