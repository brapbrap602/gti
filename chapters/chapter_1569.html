<h1>Chapter 1560: Strange Poison</h1><p>Chapter 1560: Strange Poison</p><p>When in danger, Shi Ma instinctively used a life-saving illusion, scattering spirit illusion seeds to escape.</p><p>The strange-faced man didn't understand Shi Ma's nature and accidentally made a mistake.</p><p>Seeing Shi Ma fall into his master's hands, and then turn into a flower seed, the man in grey robes was overcome with joy and sorrow, his newly revealed smile instantly freezing on his face.</p><p>At this moment, the Bao Se Bell shone again.</p><p>Qin Sang simply made the Bao Se Bell flash on and off, temporarily resolving the crisis.</p><p>The strange-faced man's expression didn't change, only his eyes darted around before fixing on Qin Sang, his pupils as red and bloodshot as the centipede-like red marks on his face.</p><p>Seeing the strange-faced man's appearance, Qin Sang felt a little uneasy. It was hard to imagine what a Yuan Ying late-stage cultivator had done to himself to end up looking like this.</p><p>The treasure light shone, and Shi Ma's figure was revealed again.  Caught between two Yuan Ying cultivators, weak and helpless, it could only flee in another direction.</p><p>Lu Zhang was first surprised, then delighted, exclaiming his approval.</p><p>He had received a prior warning from Qin Sang and was prepared before the strange-faced man noticed anything amiss. He immediately twisted his body, rapidly closing in on Shi Ma.</p><p>The strange-faced man's gaze swept over Qin Sang, a strange look flashing in his eyes. He suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a blood sword, which instantly transformed into a beam of blood light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A strong smell of blood spread.</p><p>The blood sword flashed, appearing behind Shi Ma, its tip pointed directly at it, its speed showing no sign of slowing down.  Judging by the strange-faced man's posture, he intended to destroy Shi Ma outright!</p><p>It was a purely self-destructive act.</p><p>Not only was Lu Zhang furious, but the grey-robed man was also greatly astonished.  They had simply lost the initial opportunity; it was still unclear who would ultimately obtain the treasure.  The master had destroyed Shi Ma without a word, even at the cost of his own essence blood.</p><p>The order he heard left him no time to think.</p><p>The grey-robed man quickly took out a five-colored whip.</p><p>It was a short whip, vibrantly colored, similar to his five-colored poisonous spider, made entirely of linked bone segments.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The grey-robed man swung the five-colored whip, a whip shadow striking at Lu Zhang like lightning.</p><p>Wherever the whip shadow passed, the miasma was absorbed as if into a funnel in the void, almost completely draining the area's miasma; only then did the miasma from outside rush in.</p><p>The whip shadow itself became even more substantial.</p><p>If hit, Lu Zhang would certainly suffer greatly.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang finally had a free hand.</p><p>A fierce blade slashed towards the whip shadow.</p><p>The grey-robed man's cultivation was just a step away from the mid-stage, a level below Qin Sang's clone; even with the advantageous environment, he could only at best close the gap.</p><p>The temperature plummeted.</p><p>Snowflakes danced.</p><p>A crackling sound echoed through the depths of the earth.</p><p>The Ta Xue Divine Blade displayed its power, slashing through the air. The whip shadow writhed like a snake, but each twist was intercepted by a blade, keeping it out of reach of Lu Zhang.</p><p>Lu Zhang kept his eyes fixed on the task.</p><p>Shi Ma was crucial to Lu Zhang's cultivation, and he couldn't bear to watch it destroyed.</p><p>Lu Zhang flicked his wrist, sending the jade bracelet on his arm flying.  It spun rapidly, transforming into a circle of white light in mid-air, precisely encircling the blood sword.</p><p>Concentric rings of illusory bracelet shadows rapidly contracted inwards, each ring exerting binding and suppressing force, squeezing towards the blood sword in the center.</p><p>The blood light on the surface of the blood sword began to dissipate, but the sword itself remained unmoved.</p><p>A series of 'bang bang bang' sounds rang out.</p><p>Despite the strange-faced man's hasty attack, the blood sword's power was still astonishing. It annihilated more than ten bracelet shadows before half its blade pierced the center of the jade bracelet, its momentum finally showing signs of weakening.</p><p>Seizing this brief opportunity,</p><p>Lu Zhang approached Shi Ma and threw a silver net, covering the air above.</p><p>Shi Ma was still desperately fleeing, its body transforming into various forms.  However, under the light of the Bao Se Bell, it was nowhere to hide and appeared about to fall into the net.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang felt something was amiss.</p><p>Especially the strange-faced man's gaze, like a poisonous snake, seemed to be constantly fixed on him, making him feel as if he had a thorn in his back.</p><p>At this moment, the blood sword failed to break through the jade bracelet's seal, and a white light suddenly appeared within it, faintly revealing the shadow of a jade-armored insect.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways, his expression slightly stunned.</p><p>It was a spirit insect he had never seen before.</p><p>No known texts describe this type of insect.  However, seeing the jade beetle's wings, identical to those of the corpse moths, and remembering the recent massacre of the corpse moths, a connection is obvious.</p><p>"Careful!" Qin Sang shouted.</p><p>At that moment, the jade beetle spread its wings, hovering in mid-air. Its tiny eyes, like those of the masked man, glowed with an eerie red light as it devoured the masked man's blood.  Then it expelled a stream of milky white light.</p><p>The light targeted not only the stone toad but Lu Zhang himself!</p><p>The light lacked any overwhelming aura. The jade beetle itself was even beautiful and cute. Yet, this combination hid a terrifying danger.</p><p>Lu Zhang brought his hands together, his silver net curling inward. He managed to capture the stone toad, quickly retracting the net and retreating, but the edge of the white light still grazed him.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The white light arrived instantly.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Lu Zhang's robes billowed, forming a protective energy shield, but it couldn't prevent the light's penetration.</p><p>Lu Zhang's nostrils flared, his face turning pale.  A greyish-white aura quickly spread across his face, draining his color.  His protective energy shield violently shuddered, showing signs of disintegration.</p><p>Lu Zhang tapped his chest several times, suppressing the greyish-white aura.  But it instantly surged back, even more fiercely.</p><p>Even more alarming, Lu Zhang's blood circulation began to stagnate.</p><p>"Haha!" the masked man laughed wildly. "Excellent!  Even better than I expected! Sadly, my Gu King isn't fully developed; otherwise, this single attack would send you straight to the afterlife!"</p><p>Laughing, the masked man's fingers curled into claws, his skin roughening like bark, his arms strangely transforming into long vines.  Like a hawk striking its prey, he lunged for Lu Zhang's forehead.</p><p>If he landed the blow, Lu Zhang's head would certainly have five bloody holes.  Whether his Nascent Soul could escape would be questionable.</p><p>In this life-or-death moment, Lu Zhang produced a vial of unknown pills, swallowing them all at once. A distorted yell escaped his throat.</p><p>*Buzz buzzâ€¦*</p><p>The green bell, entangled with the wooden bead, vibrated wildly and suddenly disappeared, breaking free to appear above Lu Zhang's head.</p><p>The green bell swung, aiming at Lu Zhang himself, and struck down.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The wooden claw hit the green bell.</p><p>A loud *dong* resonated. Ripples spread across the green bell's surface, but it remained incredibly strong and undamaged, only being knocked away to strike a nearby stone wall.</p><p>Lu Zhang's fate was uncertain.</p><p>The masked man narrowed his eyes, choosing not to pursue the green bell, but instead turning his gaze to Qin Sang, his eyes gleaming with greed. He hissed and chuckled, "Such pure wood spirit energy!"</p><p>--</p><p>Two thousand words for now --||</p>
