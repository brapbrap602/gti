<h1></h1><p>Sun God Tree.</p><p>This was the name Qin Sang had chosen for his new magical treasure.</p><p>Its form was inspired by a divine artifact from his previous life’s memories—the Bronze Divine Tree.  He'd once had the rare opportunity to witness this magnificent divine tree, and the awe it inspired remained etched in his mind.</p><p>When considering the form of his treasure, Qin Sang decided to emulate the Bronze Divine Tree, a sentimental gesture of sorts.</p><p>Upon a base refined from the Nine-Life Profound Turtle Shell, three roots supported the main body of the divine tree.</p><p>The trunk was perfectly straight, its branches divided into three tiers.  From each tier, three branches extended outward in different directions, resulting in a total of nine branches for the entire tree.</p><p>All the branches gently drooped, adorned with shimmering runes that resembled ancient decorative patterns.</p><p>However, these were not the main attraction.</p><p>Most striking were the short branches that extended upwards from each main branch, slightly upturned, each supporting a small, circular disc.  Atop each disc rested a flower bud.</p><p>Qin Sang envisioned that, after subduing the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather, the Southern Bright Emberfire would be channeled into the white-copper body of the tree.  Ultimately, the power of these flames would coalesce within the flower buds, transforming into nine majestic divine birds with heads held high and tails elegantly curled.</p><p>In this way, he could utilize the treasure to wield the Southern Bright Emberfire, rather than simply using it as a vessel to contain the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather.</p><p>Now, the first step was complete.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird’s True Feather had been drawn into the base refined from the Profound Turtle Shell.</p><p>Having lost its source, the Southern Bright Emberfire was no longer a match for the Golden Silk Ancient Restrictions.  The flames rapidly weakened, suppressed by the rich golden light, with the majority of the Southern Bright Emberfire following its source and surging into the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The full extent of the stone chamber was revealed.</p><p>At the center of the chamber was a circular stone platform.  The center of the platform was hollow, its surface covered in a dense network of Golden Silk Ancient Restrictions, glowing crimson within.</p><p>The remaining flames receded into the hollow, transforming into a furnace fire, its flames flickering gently, seemingly docile.</p><p>They were now rootless flames, destined to gradually dissipate.</p><p>As expected, this place had once been an alchemy chamber.</p><p>Only the chamber remained, the alchemy cauldron was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Nor were there any fire channels to draw upon earthfire, indicating that the spirit fire used by ancient cultivators for alchemy was the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to observe his surroundings.  He sat cross-legged, eyes tightly closed.</p><p>The Sun God Tree slowly rotated before him.</p><p>At the base of the Sun God Tree…</p><p>After the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather was pulled into the Profound Water Space, the Profound Water energy contained within the Profound Turtle Shell immediately surged forth.</p><p>The Profound Turtle Shell originated from a Transformation stage Nine-Life Profound Turtle.  While not on the same level as the Vermilion Bird, the Profound Water energy still possessed a certain degree of restraint against flames and could merge with the aura of the green copper fragment.</p><p>Of course, the green copper fragment deserved most of the credit.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his entire being, fully activating the treasure.  The green copper fragment materialized within the Profound Water Space, its green light intensifying.  The Vermilion Bird’s True Feather continued to tremble slightly, attempting to escape its natural enemy.</p><p>However, escape was no longer an option.  The green copper fragment slowly descended upon the main body of the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather, suppressing it.  The two treasures pressed tightly together.</p><p>Suppressing the main body of the True Feather was equivalent to completing half the task.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax, quickly shifting his attention to the divine tree.</p><p>Under his guidance, the power of the Southern Bright Emberfire flowed into the body of the tree.  The white-copper divine tree was immediately ‘dyed’ crimson, becoming highly unstable.  Its entire body glowed a fiery red, its surface shimmering with a glaze-like sheen that seemed to flow, making one worry that it might melt away.</p><p>This was another major hurdle. Until this moment, Qin Sang had no certainty of success.</p><p>The mysterious white copper had an unusual origin.  Existing records offered no relevant information, and no one knew for sure whether its material could withstand the powerful Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>Qin Sang could only do his best, employing all his knowledge and incorporating various precious spiritual materials to shape the tree's body.</p><p>The rest was up to fate.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was taut, not missing the slightest change in the divine tree.</p><p>The flames flowed slowly across the tree's body, which became transparent, revealing the fiery currents within.  While appearing calm on the surface, Qin Sang knew how violent its true nature was.</p><p>The impact and damage the Southern Bright Emberfire inflicted on the divine tree were within Qin Sang’s expectations.</p><p>The runes on the tree’s surface flickered, dimming in large patches.  Qin Sang was incredibly busy, desperately trying to repair the runes, but still struggling to keep up.</p><p>The situation appeared extremely precarious, the divine tree shaking violently.</p><p>Yet, the joy on Qin Sang’s face grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Living up to expectations, the tree body forged from the mysterious white copper did not collapse, it endured.  Moreover, in this process, the main body of the divine tree became even more refined.</p><p>Simultaneously, the fiery aura converged within the nine flower buds of the divine tree.</p><p>This fiery aura churned restlessly, gradually coalescing over time into balls of red fire.  The shaking of the divine tree also gradually subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, his gaze sparkling.</p><p>The crimson divine tree seemed to be perpetually enveloped in illusory flames.  With the slightest movement, it shed shimmering, crimson tassels, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>The fireballs within the flower buds shone even more dazzlingly, like nine miniature suns.</p><p>From this perspective, it did bear some resemblance to the legendary Fusang, the divine tree.</p><p>Appreciating it meticulously from top to bottom, Qin Sang felt deeply satisfied.  This was a magical treasure conceived and refined by his own hand, a remarkable feat in the present age.</p><p>Despite numerous twists and turns, he had finally succeeded.</p><p>He extended his divine sense, cautiously probing the Sun God Tree, attempting to manipulate the fireballs on the flower buds.  The divine tree abruptly trembled, the Southern Bright Emberfire showing signs of becoming violent.</p><p>If the fireballs collapsed, the balance would be broken, and all his previous efforts would be wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he quickly withdrew his divine sense.</p><p>His gaze fell upon the nine flower buds.  After condensing into fireballs, they had reached an impasse, somewhat different from his expectations.  After several unsuccessful attempts, Qin Sang realized it was due to his low cultivation level.</p><p>"It seems I'll have to wait until I refine these fireballs into the form of firebirds and stabilize them before I can control the Southern Bright Emberfire."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, a wave of exhaustion washing over him.</p><p>Every step since entering the secret passage had been like walking a tightrope.</p><p>Comprehending the Golden Silk Ancient Restrictions and suppressing the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather had taken a tremendous toll on his mind and spirit.</p><p>He gazed longingly at the Sun God Tree for a while longer, the joy on his face evident.  After expending so much effort, it had finally lived up to his expectations.</p><p>Storing the divine tree away, Qin Sang's gaze swept across the alchemy chamber.</p><p>Aside from the Golden Silk Ancient Restrictions, he found nothing else of use. Even if the ancient cultivators had left anything behind, it would have long been destroyed by the Vermilion Bird’s True Feather.</p><p>A remnant of the Southern Bright Emberfire still lingered in the furnace.</p><p>Lacking the ability to subdue it, Qin Sang could only leave it there to dissipate.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a chill.</p><p>Without the Southern Bright Emberfire to block it, the Sword Qi and evil wind seeped in.</p><p>This place was not safe to remain in for long.  Qin Sang turned and walked out of the alchemy chamber, not forgetting to glance into the other chambers before leaving.  They were even more damaged than this one, yielding no rewards.</p><p>There were no other treasures on Sword Scar Mountain worth Qin Sang's attention.  After resting and recovering his spiritual energy within the stone hall, he decided to leave immediately.</p><p>Employing the same tactic, he lured and killed a red fox, traversing the most dangerous part of the dense forest.</p><p>Qin Sang retraced his steps, flying towards the foot of the mountain. </p>
