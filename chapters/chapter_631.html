<h1>Chapter 623: Transaction</h1><p>“Talismanic treasures are universally valuable.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, realizing that although his teleportation destination was remote, it still had subtle connections to the Xiaohan Region's cultivation world, existing within the same realm.</p><p>While talismans are rare, Qin Sang possessed more than one.  From Qiu Pao Daoren's belongings alone, he had obtained two complete talismanic treasures.</p><p>During the years of intense battles against the Heavenly Alliance in the Chaotic Isles, the cultivators involved were all elite. Qin Sang had acquired talismans among his spoils of war, but they were mostly depleted of power and used immediately.</p><p>The one Qin Sang held now was a Flying Sword talisman, retaining about seventy to eighty percent of its power. It was also a war trophy.</p><p>After the treasure hunt at Finger Peak and his departure from the Chaotic Isles, he hadn't had the opportunity to use it in battle.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang had formed his Gold Core and could wield magical treasures freely, talismans were superfluous.  He might as well trade it for something he needed.</p><p>Sensing Cui Xuanzi's lack of confidence, Qin Sang decided to present this partially depleted talisman and gauge his reaction.</p><p>"I've already formed my Gold Core and am not particularly interested in your sect's cultivation methods. I'm only looking to observe your Insect Control techniques because I plan to find a natal insect."</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's gaze fixated on the talisman, his expression shifting, Qin Sang proactively softened his stance.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was indeed tempted.</p><p>Although the Five Insects Sect dominated the Bear Mountain region, their position wouldn't be secure without a Gold Core cultivator. Some of the larger settlements also had Foundation Establishment cultivators. While few in number, their combined strength could pose a challenge to the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's foundation wasn't deep. Cui Xuanzi's Martial Uncle was once their only trump card.</p><p>During his time at the sect, the Five Insects Sect enjoyed a period of prosperity. However, his Martial Uncle, still in his prime, wouldn't damage his own magical treasure to leave a talisman behind.</p><p>Now, with his Martial Uncle's prolonged absence, suspicions were growing, and some were becoming restless.</p><p>Possessing a talisman to protect the sect would not only solidify their position in the Bear Mountain region but also deter external forces with designs on the area.</p><p>After hearing Qin Sang's conditions, Cui Xuanzi's eyes lit up. "Senior, are you serious?  Just the Insect Control techniques in exchange for this talismanic treasure?"</p><p>Compared to the shamans of the larger settlements, the Five Insects Sect's Insect Control techniques were unique and a key reason for their continued dominance. Cui Xuanzi would never have considered sharing them with anyone else.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't a local cultivator. As a Gold Core expert, he would eventually leave. Sharing only the Insect Control techniques wouldn't significantly impact the power balance in the Bear Mountain region.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his hand. "Of course, that's not enough!"</p><p>As Cui Xuanzi's face fell, Qin Sang calmly added, "I'll also need you to do a few things for me."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi frowned inwardly, but the allure of the talismanic treasure proved too strong. He gritted his teeth and said, "Please tell me, Senior."</p><p>"Don't worry, I just need you to help me with some trivial matters, gathering information. I've only recently formed my Gold Core and need to consolidate my cultivation. I don't have the energy for distractions. If you perform well, I won't be stingy with other pills and artifacts, aside from this talisman.  Afterward, you'll remain the dominant force here. I'll return to my homeland and won't ask anything more of you."</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's interest piqued, Qin Sang tossed the talisman to him, then turned towards the depths of the Western Frontier. "I'm new here and unfamiliar with the Western Frontier. Find me a detailed map, including the wilderness areas."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi breathed a sigh of relief. "That's not difficult. My sect has an ancestral map, very detailed. My Martial Uncle further explored and updated it during his time here. It will certainly satisfy you, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him and pointed forward, speaking calmly.</p><p>"Don't rush to answer. The map I want isn't just for the Bear Mountain region. I believe you have ways to contact other regional powers. I want the map to cover as wide an area as possible, ideally encompassing the wilderness.</p><p>"These maps should not only mark the various powers but also the habitats of spirit insects, no matter how dangerous.</p><p>"In addition, gather information on any rumored locations of ancient cultivator ruins or secret realms in the surrounding regions, including the wilderness of the Western Frontier's heartland."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, adding, "Even the most perilous places, like demonic realms or deadly areas feared by cultivators, should be marked. If you need any resources in the process, just come to me."</p><p>"Secret realms? Ruins?" Cui Xuanzi was taken aback.</p><p>It made sense that Qin Sang, seeking a suitable natal insect, would inquire about spirit insect habitats.  The Western Frontier was indeed home to some precious spirit insects.</p><p>These insects were either uniquely gifted and elusive, immensely powerful, or lived in dangerous locations.</p><p>Cultivators from outside often entered the Western Frontier to capture insects, including Gold Core experts, mostly returning disappointed. Even with Qin Sang's strength, success wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>But why search for secret realms and ancient cultivator ruins?</p><p>Was he planning to leverage his power and scour the Western Frontier?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, "Are there any secret realms near the Bear Mountain region, riddled with restrictions and sealed by immortal formations, making them inaccessible?  If you're diligent, I wouldn't mind sharing a treasure or two from any discoveries."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shook his head. "To be honest, Senior, I've cultivated in the Five Insects Sect since childhood and have never heard of such places nearby."</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's sincere tone, Qin Sang frowned inwardly.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the most crucial task after forming his Gold Core was to find the ancient teleportation formation and establish a path back home, so he could cultivate here with peace of mind.</p><p>Now, with the Three-Light Jade Liquid and an alchemist found, the Salvation Pill was within reach, but he was separated from the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>Such wondrous items were incredibly rare.</p><p>Recalling the difficulties he faced during Core Formation, Qin Sang knew Nascent Soul formation would be even more challenging. He had to find a way to return to the Xiaohan Region and refine the Salvation Pill before then.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully observed the Western Frontier's complex and interconnected waterways.</p><p>The small river he drifted on was connected to others, merely a part of a larger network, its source impossible to trace.</p><p>More troubling was his uncertainty about how long he was unconscious after teleporting, making it difficult to estimate his location.</p><p>Searching for the ancient teleportation formation in such a vast area was like searching for a needle in a haystack. Qin Sang didn't even know whether the formation was above or below ground.</p><p>He was also completely baffled about why he woke up floating on the river.</p><p>Qin Sang reasoned that since the other end of the teleportation formation was in the Purple Star Palace, it was highly likely that this end was within a secret realm.</p><p>Searching for the ancient teleportation formation by exploring various secret realms would be far more efficient than wandering aimlessly.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks to Qianyu for the generous donation!
