<h1>Chapter 1676: Convergence</h1><p>The ethereal image of the wordless jade disc, towering several dozen feet high, was visible not only to those on the mountain, but also to the cultivators rapidly approaching.  The fleeting Daoist mark, swiftly vanishing, caused quite a stir.  At that moment, countless individuals lamented, wishing they could instantly teleport to Mount Disu.</p><p>The Daoist mark had been visible for such a short time, and was disrupted so often, that they gained almost nothing from it. Yet, its extraordinary nature and inherent Daoist resonance were undeniable, prompting sighs of regret.</p><p>This mood reached its zenith when the Purple Thunder Real Person ascended to the peak in nine strides, drawing down a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>This was a Daoist mark capable of assisting one in breaking through the Divine Transformation stage!</p><p>“Divine Transformation Tribulation!”</p><p>“Someone’s breaking through!”</p><p>…</p><p>The onlookers displayed a range of expressions, their emotions complex.  Nearly everyone present was witnessing a Divine Transformation Tribulation for the first time.</p><p>From afar, Mount Disu was enveloped in a storm cloud. Soon, vibrant clouds descended, circling the mountain and merging into a single, breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>The weather dramatically changed!</p><p>A terrifying aura descended, causing the cultivators of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect to change countenance and tremble with fear.  They had experienced this feeling during their Nascent Soul Tribulations, but a Nascent Soul tribulation was nothing compared to a Divine Transformation tribulation.</p><p>On Mount Disu, immense clouds surged, and colorful clouds swirled chaotically. In an instant, a tempest formed.</p><p>Thunder and lightning raged!</p><p>This was a terrifying storm wielding the power of Heaven and Earth. At this moment, the spiritual energy of the world was mobilized by an unknown force, causing the entire legacy site to tremble.</p><p>A spiritual tide surged, visible to the naked eye. During the Nascent Soul Tribulation, the spiritual energy had been drawn in layers from near to far. Now, however, it was less distinct. The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was mobilized simultaneously, forming a sea of spiritual energy suspended in the air.</p><p>The spiritual tide crashed down in towering waves, producing thunderous roars. Then, the spiritual tide, pressing down like collapsing mountains, crushed everything in its path. The figure standing on Mount Disu was engulfed in the heart of the spiritual tide!</p><p>The sight filled everyone with dread.  Without even waiting for the tribulation itself, they would have been severely injured by the impact of the spiritual tide.  Those with weaker cultivation would likely have been pulverized.</p><p>Gasps erupted, but were cut short by the unfolding scene. The center of the spiritual tide began to distort strangely, quickly affecting the surroundings, and a familiar fluctuation spread.  Cultivators who had undergone a Nascent Soul Tribulation were instantly reminded of their traumatic experiences.</p><p>“It’s Yin Fire!”</p><p>“The tribulation has arrived!”</p><p>…</p><p>Invisible Yin Fire descended from the heavens.  While the Divine Transformation and Nascent Soul Tribulations both involved three heavenly calamities and a subsequent karmic tribulation, their power was incomparable.  Anyone who came into contact with the Yin Fire would be incinerated from the inside out in an instant.</p><p>Under the oppressive weight of the tribulation, the cultivators were rendered speechless, holding their breath. Those who had been fastest to arrive near Mount Disu unconsciously slowed their speed, afraid of getting too close.</p><p>The effects of the Divine Transformation Tribulation did not end there. Though the phenomena within the legacy site were concealed by Mount Disu's protective formation, certain celestial events occurred in the surrounding Mount Tayue range.  Furthermore, due to the immense spiritual energy mobilized by the tribulation, the resulting fluctuations spread to even more distant places, catching the attention of those who were watching.</p><p>Northwest of Mount Tayue.</p><p>The river carved deep valleys through the towering mountains.  Steep cliffs lined the riverbanks, the current strong and swift.  Toxic miasma often formed dense fogs, blocking vast sections of the river valley, lingering perpetually.</p><p>At this moment, several streams of light sped through the valleys, heading toward Mount Tayue.  Similar scenes had been repeatedly occurring in the Nanman prefectures recently.  With news of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's emergence spreading, countless cultivators were lured by the prospect of treasure.</p><p>“A tribulation!”</p><p>The leading stream of light suddenly stopped, revealing the figure of an old monk.  The monk, with white eyebrows and beard, and a kind face, looked like a virtuous monk. However, he emanated no powerful aura; those behind him appeared much stronger.</p><p>The other stream of light beside him also stopped, revealing a seductive woman.  They were the Hui Guang Saint and the Qing Hu Saint King, who had come upon hearing the news.</p><p>The Qing Hu Saint King sensed the situation briefly, then smiled, “It's a Divine Transformation Tribulation!”</p><p>Her tone was tinged with amusement, almost gleeful.  She looked at Hui Guang Saint, “Old Monk, you had ambitions to net them all.  Didn’t expect someone would break through at the last minute, did you?”</p><p>They were far away in the Jin Yu Prefecture, their information lagging.  Even for Divine Transformation cultivators, by the time they reached Mount Disu, the event would likely have ended.</p><p>To save time, Hui Guang Shengzhe commandeered an ancient teleportation array controlled by Long Ju Dongtian.</p><p>Next, instead of rushing, Hui Guang Shengzhe gathered some Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang knew Hui Guang Shengzhe's intention: to lure more demons into Wu Xiang Xianmen and wipe them out in one fell swoop.  Unexpectedly, a variable occurred.</p><p>Based on the energy fluctuations, someone was undergoing the Divine Transformation Tribulation at Wu Xiang Xianmen!</p><p>Another Divine Transformation cultivator would be beneficial; they could gain more support against the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>However, Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Sheng Wang deduced that as long as the Heavenly Demon Sound remained, even the most steadfast cultivators in this realm would likely fail the final Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>During the Divine Transformation Tribulation, cultivators gradually comprehend and approach the Dao. By the time they survive the three calamities and the Heart Demon Tribulation arrives, they can already sense the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>At that point, the Demon Sound and the Heart Demon Tribulation would strike simultaneously, leaving no chance of survival.</p><p>This is fate, beyond human control.</p><p>Seeing Hui Guang Shengzhe's unprecedentedly serious expression, Qing Hu Sheng Wang understood his worry – not about a new powerful enemy.</p><p>The person undergoing the tribulation in plain sight, near death, might reveal a crucial secret, prematurely unleashing the Heavenly Demon Sound!</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe cared deeply for his sect. He aimed to lay the groundwork before chaos erupted, ensuring Gan Lu Chan Yuan's dominance and longevity.</p><p>The news spread, causing an uproar in the cultivation world.</p><p>With the hope of Divine Transformation ascension lost, this realm's cultivators would surely be thrown into turmoil, leading to a reshaping of the power structure!</p><p>Even with Hui Guang Shengzhe, how long could he suppress it? The undercurrents would not be stopped.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A spiritual wind arose spontaneously.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe suddenly vanished in a flash of light, leaving behind a lingering patch of colorful smoke – a remarkably subtle Buddhist light escape technique.</p><p>Qing Hu Sheng Wang chuckled, her figure like smoke, swiftly following.</p><p>The others exchanged glances, not daring to delay, flying with all their might.</p><p>The two remaining Divine Transformation cultivators in this realm, at full speed, traversed vast distances effortlessly.  In a short time, Mount Taiyue was before them.</p><p>Above the old site of Taiyue Gate.</p><p>The vortex created by Wu Xiang Xianmen remained, surrounded by people like ants or moths to a flame, risking everything for a sliver of illusory enlightenment.</p><p>As the cloud wall weakened, the Yuan Ying cultivators had entered the legacy abode; occasional latecomers simply needed to reveal their aura, and a path would automatically open through the crowd.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators had also mostly entered the vortex, rushing into the cloud wall.</p><p>The turbulence inside the passage gradually lessened, and Foundation Establishment cultivators began moving.  Outside, more ambitious but less powerful cultivators anxiously awaited.</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Sheng Wang didn't reveal their auras.  One after another, they entered the passage; the surrounding cultivators only felt a slight breeze, completely unaware that the peak figures of this realm had just passed by.</p><p>Facing the cloud wall before the mountain gate, Qing Hu Sheng Wang ignored it, rushing straight in.  But as soon as she entered the cloud wall, she sensed something, her expression shifting slightly as she changed direction.</p><p>In the deepest corner of the cloud wall.</p><p>A group of figures were carefully moving.</p><p>Their clothing looked ordinary, but their builds and attire were peculiar: some were extraordinarily strong, others as thin and short as monkeys; most wore cloaks, nearly concealing their entire bodies.</p><p>Though they suppressed their auras and avoided crowds, a certain aura lingered on some, different from humans – demonic energy!</p><p>Among these transformed demon kings, one stood out.</p><p>This demon was tall and thin, wearing a mask that hid his face; his striking white hair and white robe gave him a refined air.</p><p>His aura was the most concealed among them, similar to the Qing Mao Rat demon from the human trade fair years ago – even among human cultivators, it would be hard to recognize him as a demon.</p><p>While flying within the cloud wall, a fish demon approached, saying, “Great Saint, the end of the cloud wall is near. Why not stop for a while and hunt some Yuan Ying for our brothers to feast on?”</p><p>The White-robed Great Saint smiled gently, “You and Li Yuan discovered this secret realm, promptly reported it, and investigated its secrets.  A few Yuan Ying are not enough reward for such a great accomplishment. If we find our clan’s treasures in the Immortal Palace, you can choose first.”</p><p>The fish demon was overjoyed.</p><p>The bird demon was also extremely excited.</p><p>The other demon kings cast envious glances.</p><p>However, as they conversed, a wary look passed between them.  The celestial tribulation emanating from the ancient mansion felt like a dagger at their backs, urging them to investigate. If someone was truly undergoing the Ascension Tribulation, they knew they'd have to leave immediately.</p><p>Before he could finish, the white-robed Grand Sage suddenly looked up, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>Simultaneously, laughter echoed from above.  "Bai Xiao, you're quite bold, daring to stir up trouble in the heart of human territory. Don't you fear losing all of Bai Ming Mountain's elite forces here?"</p><p>The laughter was alluring and captivating, but all the demons present, including the white-robed Grand Sage himself, were terrified.</p><p>All the demon kings bowed deeply, respectfully chanting, "Greetings, Sacred King!"</p><p>The next moment, the mist before them roiled, and the Azure Fox Sacred King appeared.</p><p>Feeling the Sacred King's gaze, Bai Xiao's heart skipped a beat. He quickly explained, "Reporting to the Sacred King, the Sacred King Palace spread rumors of Your Majesty's disappearance, and my subordinates were worried…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the Azure Fox Sacred King impatiently waved him off. "This is the site of a human sect, teeming with powerful humans. What were you doing there?"</p><p>Bai Xiao, well aware of the Sacred King's temper, dared not ask where she had been.  He fell silent, glanced at the fish demon, and reported in detail:  "When this mansion opened, several of my subordinates were nearby.  Taking advantage of the chaos, they captured some human cultivators.  We learned that this mansion was once the mountain gate of a top-tier human sect, connected to the legendary South Sea Immortal Palace.  It may have a passage leading to the Palace."</p><p>Demonic legends of the South Sea Immortal Palace were not uncommon.</p><p>However, the Palace was located in the South Sea, under human control, far beyond the reach of the demons.</p><p>Only the demons' Ascension-level powerhouses had a chance of being invited into the Palace.  Learning of the connection between the Wu Xiang Sect and the South Sea Immortal Palace, Bai Xiao was greatly excited.</p><p>Out of caution, they waited until most of the human experts had entered before acting.</p><p>The Palace was vast, filled with powerful restrictions. Once inside, they wouldn't fear the humans' siege.</p><p>"The Immortal Palace,"</p><p>The Azure Fox Sacred King chuckled, a sound laced with an inscrutable meaning to Bai Xiao and the others.</p><p>"The Immortal Palace is out of the question, but I need manpower.  Come with me."</p><p>With that, the Azure Fox Sacred King turned and flew towards the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>The demons exchanged glances, slightly surprised but dared not disobey, and followed suit.</p><p>"It's the Ascension Tribulation…"</p><p>Passing through the cloud wall and entering the Wu Xiang Sect, even a powerful cultivator like Bai Xiao was utterly shocked by the sight in the direction of Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Thunder roared from deep within the ancient mansion.</p><p>Dark clouds blotted out the sky, lightning filled the heavens, and bolts of electricity fell like rain.</p><p>It wasn't just an Ascension Tribulation; the cultivator had already successfully overcome the Yin Fire and Gale Winds. Judging by the scale of the tribulation, the final calamity was imminent.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Demon King Bai Xiao looked at the Azure Fox Sacred King's back, hesitating to speak.</p><p>They were about to witness the birth of another human Ascension-level cultivator!</p><p>The Azure Fox Sacred King led her subordinates to a mountaintop where Hui Guang Saint was standing, gazing at the horizon.  Seeing the old monk, the demons fell silent, as quiet as cicadas in winter.</p><p>"It's Zi Lei,"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint sighed softly.  "This child is exceptionally gifted.  Dan Yu True Monarch once prophesied that among all the True Monarchs of the Eight Views, he would rank among the top three, destined for greatness…"</p><p>When the Azure Fox Sacred King looked at the figure within the tribulation thunder, her smile vanished, replaced by a solemn expression.</p><p>It wasn't anything personal, but respect and regret for a fellow cultivator.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint disappeared in a flash. The Azure Fox Sacred King gathered her demons and soared into the air, rushing towards Di Shou Mountain through the anti-flight restrictions and sword formations.</p><p>…</p><p>On Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren, clad in thunder robes, with the Eight Views Palace Lantern atop his head, was surrounded and protected by his Zi Lei forces.</p><p>Heavenly thunder descended, turning the surroundings into an endless sea of lightning, yet he remained unharmed.</p><p>Palace Lantern illusions spread across the void, displaying his divine abilities.  He effortlessly endured the three calamities, his momentum unyielding, showing no signs of weakness.</p><p>…</p><p>On the mountain, one ascended; below, another fought for ascension.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao suddenly pulled the statue back in front of him.</p><p>As the chains tightened, the demon child was yanked out.</p><p>This revealed the demon child covered in blood-red runes. Zhu Wu Dao, having orchestrated the blood sacrifice and personally forged the statue, knew its workings intimately, making subtle manipulation easy.</p><p>Of course, his greatest advantage was his profound understanding of the ancient demon.</p><p>His eyes, now black, radiated intimidating power as he stared at the demon child, seemingly seeing through its very essence. Countless runes flooded into the demon child's body, seemingly crude, yet precisely extracting its very source.</p><p>His timing was impeccable, his actions swift.  Before those above could react, he completed the process, suppressing it with a demonic seal.</p><p>His other reliance was the Spirit-Subduing Incense.</p><p>Consuming the demon child's essence with his Yuan Ying cultivation was like a snake swallowing an elephant.  The Spirit-Subduing Incense stabilized his soul, ensuring the ritual's success and withstanding the initial impact of the demon child's essence.</p><p>The demonic seal, carrying the essence of the demon child, merged with Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's aura surged!</p>
