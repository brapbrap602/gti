<h1>Chapter 1543: The Xie Family</h1><p>The fat silkworm, having advanced to the fourth stage—equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator’s level—hadn't seemed to develop any new abilities beyond its detoxification power.  Qin Sang had expected at least some poison-resistant combat capabilities.  Even something like the Sky Eye Butterfly's Sky Eye glow could have been useful in a fight.  Instead, the fat silkworm was only effective in special environments, like the three poisonous lands of the Seven Kills Hall, or against opponents using poison, such as the frog-fish.  How could such a spirit insect survive alone in the dangerous world of cultivation?</p><p>Forced by Qin Sang, the fat silkworm spat out several balls of multicolored light, its tongue hanging out, eyes glazed over in exhaustion.  All it could do was thicken its detoxification armor.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up, turning to check on Ya Gu.  A single glance gave her a feeling that Ya Gu was different. But the change wasn't outwardly visible.  She looked the same – rosy cheeks, eyelids closed, breathing steadily, a sleeping beauty. The change lay within her spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense that Ya Gu's spirit had become much more stable.  This was clearly connected to the fat silkworm's advancement. The 'anchor' was stronger; even facing the raging storms in the darkness, Ya Gu could tightly grasp the rope connecting her to the light.  Perhaps there were other reasons Qin Sang didn't know.  The connection between Ya Gu and the fat silkworm was far closer than he had imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu couldn't respond, her condition had clearly improved. If not for the incident at the Seven Kills Hall, she would undoubtedly be better, possibly even awake.  There was finally hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed the fat silkworm's head. If it could help wake Ya Gu, even if the silkworm had no other abilities, it wouldn't have been raised in vain.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Finally free, the fat silkworm eagerly darted into Ya Gu's forehead and fell fast asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, not rushing to leave.  He hadn't gone far from the tribulation site, intending to wait and see if any cultivators, alerted by the tribulation, would come to investigate. The silkworm's tribulation had been unexpected and rushed; it was hard to avoid being noticed.</p><p>A fourth-stage spirit insect was incredibly rare in the cultivation world.  Once the news spread, it could attract Nascent Soul cultivators hunting for it, even drawing the attention of major sects.</p><p>Qin Sang’s prediction proved correct.  Soon, two figures appeared in the distance – an old man and a young man, looking like grandfather and grandson.  However, their cultivation was anything but weak. The younger man's cultivation was higher, at the mid-Golden Core stage, while the elder was only slightly weaker.</p><p>"Just like that, two Golden Core cultivators are drawn here.  The influence of the Fudu County's sects isn't small…" Qin Sang observed their movements, thinking to himself.</p><p>The two headed straight for the tribulation site.  Though the tribulation clouds had dispersed, the power of Heaven and Earth from the thunderbolts hadn't completely dissipated. Qin Sang couldn't entirely erase this heavenly might.</p><p>The two cultivators were experienced enough. Before they got close, they sensed this heavenly might and immediately recognized it.</p><p>"A Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>They cried out, exchanging shocked glances. They had been busy with something else and hadn't witnessed the thunderbolts firsthand.  Sensing an unusual energy fluctuation from afar, they had come to investigate, never imagining that someone was undergoing a tribulation here.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul cultivators could trigger a Heavenly Tribulation – common knowledge.  Both felt a chill down their spines, regretting their rashness and instinctively wanting to flee.</p><p>But they had already seen the scene at the tribulation site.  Everything was scorched black, the mountaintop almost leveled by the thunderbolts; the entire mountain was in ruins – a result of the tribulation and Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>The devastation caused by the Heavenly Tribulation was evident, but there was no sign of the cultivator who had undergone it.  Considering the relatively short duration of the thunder, they reasoned that the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator might have failed.</p><p>They exchanged glances, unable to resist the immense temptation.  Bravely approaching, they searched thoroughly, but finding no Nascent Soul artifacts, they were greatly disappointed.</p><p>"Let's quickly report back to Master-Brother, the Sect Leader.  We don't know which Nascent Soul senior passed by and underwent a tribulation here.  Let Master-Brother report to the Six Emptiness Sect; perhaps they can find clues," said the young cultivator.</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing. "That's right.  Regardless of the senior's origin, it's none of our concern. What a pity!  Not a trace left after the tribulation!"</p><p>"That senior may not have truly failed; have either of us ever seen a real Heavenly Tribulation?" The young cultivator shook his head, sealing the area around the mountain peak with a formation before signaling the elder and flying away.</p><p>Qin Sang stood not far from them.</p><p>The two were completely unaware that their conversation was overheard.</p><p>Having confirmed that the two hadn't witnessed the silver tribulation lightning and were misled into believing it was a cultivator's ascension tribulation, Qin Sang decided against interfering and let them leave.</p><p>News of a Nascent Soul tribulation disrupting the situation in Fuding County wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing; it wasn't likely to spiral out of control.</p><p>“Six Emptiness Sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered the three words, his figure flickering before vanishing.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang returned to Fuding County and chose a refined residence at the Six States Hall, awaiting Zhou Jin's arrival.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as scheduled.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed, bowing deeply.  "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I never expected to be gone for nearly ten years. You've remained in Fuding County all this time. Have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Zhou Jin, worried about Ruan Yu's condition, had been anxious for ten years without news from Qin Sang, fearing the senior had met with an accident or forgotten the matter. He had been walking on eggshells, yet dared not slacken off.</p><p>Thankfully, his worst fears hadn't materialized.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke rapidly. "Following your instructions, Senior, I left Zezhou and came to this area, investigating information about Mount Pu and the Xie family…"</p><p>Mount Pu, the Xie family.</p><p>They were connected to the superior Daoist cultivation site recorded by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The cultivation site, Clear Void Realm, was located on Mount Pu.</p><p>The Xie family once boasted two Nascent Soul cultivators, holding a significant position even in the cultivator-rich Central State. Clear Void Realm was extremely hidden, always under the Xie family's control, unknown to outsiders.</p><p>Clear Void Realm served not only as a secluded cultivation site but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie family members had painstakingly studied it, unable to unlock the secret until one of their Nascent Souls met Xiao Xiangzi.  Impressed by his extraordinary abilities, they invited him into Clear Void Realm, where the secret was finally solved.</p><p>The jade slip didn't detail what the three gained within Clear Void Realm.</p><p>Ironically, as they were about to divide the treasures after unlocking the secret, the Xie family ancestor, overcome by greed, attempted to kill Xiao Xiangzi and seize everything for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi certainly hadn't reached the Divine Transformation stage at the time, otherwise, the Xie ancestor wouldn't have been so reckless.</p><p>Even so, both Xie family Nascent Souls were killed by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't exterminate the entire Xie family.  While furious, he didn't want to let them off easily either, personally sealing Clear Void Realm, preventing future Xie family members from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal were commonplace in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsurprised.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't see anything wrong with his actions either.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiangzi's killing intent, almost leading to the massacre of the entire Xie family, pushing him to the brink of demonic possession. This incident jolted him awake, making him aware of his inner demons.</p><p>His subsequent travels, refining Soul-Calming Incense, addressed the problem, allowing him to eventually reach the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Later, reflecting on his path, he realized that the other Xie family Nascent Soul hadn't initially intended to betray him, but had been coerced by the Xie family ancestor.</p><p>Since the other party had chosen to attack him, regardless of their true intentions, Xiao Xiangzi couldn't afford to show mercy.</p><p>However, the anger stemming from the betrayal had considerably subsided.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi recorded this event, hoping whoever obtained the jade slip would travel to Central State, find the Xie family, and, if the restriction on Clear Void Realm still existed, open it, returning it to the Xie family to settle the score.</p><p>Qin Sang sent Zhou Jin to find the Xie family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiangzi's request, and secondly, to allow him to cultivate in seclusion within Clear Void Realm.</p><p>Time and tide wait for no man.  Places change names, powers rise and fall.  Just as the destroyed cave abode in Sky Crack Valley and the renamed Zhurlan Temple, even if the Xie family no longer existed and Clear Void Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>"After arriving, I searched Fuding County and the surrounding three counties, unable to find Mount Pu. I later learned that after Zhuozhou was incorporated into the Nineteen States of Smoke and Rain,  Mount Unremembered had overseen a large-scale geomantic survey, redrawing the boundaries of Zhuozhou and changing many place names. I then sought out ancient texts…"</p><p>Zhou Jin’s tone was lighter, clearly indicating a breakthrough. “Three years ago, I finally saw ‘Mount Pu’ in an ancient text. After extensive verification, I confirmed that Mount Pu was within Fuding County, now known as Luoyan Mountain! However, the owner of Luoyan Mountain is no longer the Xie family, but the Luoyan Sect."</p><p>“Luo Yan Gate?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts stirred.  “Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character ‘Luo’ around their waists?”</p><p>The two individuals drawn by the Fat Silkworm Heavenly Tribulation had such tokens.</p><p>Mount Pu had indeed changed hands, but it was unknown whether Luo Yan Gate had discovered the Clear Void Illusionary Realm.</p><p>“Senior has met disciples of Luo Yan Gate?”</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded.  “Luo Yan Gate has many powerful cultivators. I dared not act openly, so I could only secretly investigate the relationship between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family.  I later discovered that Luo Yan Mountain was originally seized from the Xie family by Luo Yan Gate, forcing the Xie family to relocate and leading to their decline.”</p><p>The deaths of two Yuan Ying Grandmasters and the loss of the Clear Void Illusionary Realm had stripped the Xie family of its foundation, leading to its downfall.</p><p>That the family line had survived to this day was remarkable, thanks largely to the stability of the Central Plains.</p><p>Upon learning the Xie family's whereabouts, Zhou Jin immediately sought them out.</p><p>Now, the Xie family had become an ordinary cultivation family. The current clan head only possessed Foundation Establishment cultivation. Their ancestral lands on Mount Pu had been seized, their name changed, and they dared not protest.</p><p>“I deliberately approached the Xie family and learned something,” Zhou Jin paused. “When the Xie family relinquished Mount Pu, they made a deal with Luo Yan Gate.  The agreed-upon time has long passed, yet Luo Yan Gate shows no intention of returning it. Senior, if you wish to help the Xie family reclaim Mount Pu, you can start here.”</p><p>Zhou Jin mistakenly believes Qin Sang is a lost member of the Xie family, returning to their ancestral lands to seek justice.</p><p>“Luo Yan Gate is very powerful?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>From Zhou Jin’s tone, it seemed he couldn't force Luo Yan Gate to return Mount Pu to the Xie family through sheer power.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully said, “Luo Yan Gate’s sect leader is only at the late Golden Core stage; Senior could easily eliminate him. However, there's something else to be wary of: Luo Yan Gate is backed by the Six Void Gate. The transaction between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family was witnessed by someone from Six Void Gate. I've been investigating their connections and discovered that Luo Yan Gate's sect leader has a close relationship with Six Void Gate. Six Void Gate has three Yuan Ying elders, making them a powerful force, the overlords of the surrounding prefectures. Even the Unnamed Mountain finds it difficult to intervene, and the prefect of Fudu Prefecture cannot control affairs outside the city.”</p><p>Zhou Jin had done his due diligence, even researching the difficulties Qin Sang would face.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Qin Sang was quite pleased with Zhou Jin and, keeping his promise, produced the jade slip containing the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Zhou Jin was overjoyed. He quickly took them, opened the box, and saw a spiritual herb inside, causing him to look up in astonishment.</p><p>“This Black Essence Grass is the main herb in the formula. I discovered it unexpectedly in the Western Desert. This herb is incredibly valuable.  Finding it yourself would take at least ten years, which would delay your treatment.”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking at Zhou Jin. “My subordinates are short-staffed. If you're willing, you can bring Ruan Yu to Mount Pu to cultivate.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior!”</p><p>Zhou Jin knelt and kowtowed, deeply grateful.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang learned more details from Zhou Jin and pondered his next plan.</p><p>If it were only Luo Yan Gate, he could simply go there and drive them off the mountain, minimizing the impact.  But now that Six Void Gate was involved, he needed a more careful strategy.</p><p>Six Void Gate had three Yuan Ying cultivators, one of whom was at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>While attacking them with his clone would be satisfying, he had to consider the consequences.</p><p>In the Central Plains, no matter how high one's cultivation, one couldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Furthermore, it was unclear whether the Clear Void Illusionary Realm had been exposed.  If it involved a dispute over a Daoist site, things would become much more complicated.</p><p>After some thought,</p><p>Qin Sang instructed Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie family first.</p><p>…</p><p>The Xie family, driven from Mount Pu by Luo Yan Gate, lacked the strength to seize good spirit veins and settled for an inferior one.</p><p>This hastened their decline, and their accumulated resources were nearly depleted. Even the clan head had failed to break through to the Golden Core stage, remaining stuck at the False Core stage.</p><p>However, thanks to their previous foundation, the Xie family’s protective mountain array was still potent.</p><p>“Clan Head Xie, a friend has come to visit.”</p><p>Arriving at the Xie family’s stronghold, Zhou Jin channeled his true essence and shouted.</p><p>His voice carried into the Xie family compound.</p><p>Soon, the mist parted, and a figure emerged – Xie An, the Xie family head, who possessed a distinguished bearing.</p><p>“Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest,” Xie An quickly approached, his attitude extremely warm. Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, he was unable to sense his cultivation, causing him to feel a jolt of apprehension. “This Daoist friend is…?”</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed and said, “This is Senior Qin.”</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin was a Golden Core cultivator, so the senior he spoke of must be…</p>
