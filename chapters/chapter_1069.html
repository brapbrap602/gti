<h1>Chapter 1661: Taking Turns</h1><p>Finally, they decided that only the Great Shaman and Fang Laomo could enter the Poison Lake.</p><p>The others remained outside.</p><p>The Great Shaman and Fang Laomo took turns using their poison-dispelling techniques, searching extensively in the Poison Lake.</p><p>Suddenly, the Great Shaman's expression shifted slightly. He rushed straight to the bottom of the lake and found an ancient stone platform!</p><p>Upon touching the platform, the Great Shaman's arm felt a burning sensation, and the divine runes flickered faintly.</p><p>"Ancient divine runes!"</p><p>The Great Shaman exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>Edge of the Zhenling Domain.</p><p>Among the mountains, in a stone forest on a mountain, two figures stood, one standing and one sitting, silently.</p><p>These were the East Pole Alliance Leader and Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes darted around, filled with intense fear. She was immobilized, unable to move.</p><p>After being forced by the East Pole Alliance Leader to consume Soul Cleansing Liquid and spirit pills, she was brought into a secluded valley, where she had been waiting for a long time, unsure of whom she was waiting for.</p><p>Su Nu felt utterly hopeless.</p><p>Elder Ye hadn't attacked her in the Trial Realm, and she thought she was safe, but a greater danger awaited her.</p><p>Her premonition was correct.  The East Pole Alliance had ulterior motives in cultivating her, but the East Pole Alliance Leader was one of the top experts in the world, and she had no power to resist.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A strong wind arose, and two figures swiftly arrived, the West Desert Alliance Leader and the North Star Alliance Leader.</p><p>Seeing these two, Su Nu became even more terrified and desperate.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader rose to greet them, eagerly asking, "Did you two friends succeed?"</p><p>The other two Alliance Leaders were to break into the other two main sacrificial altars. While not as troublesome as the one in the Trial Realm, they were far more dangerous.</p><p>They were located deep within the inner chambers, areas filled with spatial rifts inaccessible to human cultivators.</p><p>The two Alliance Leaders looked somewhat pale, clearly having suffered minor injuries, but nothing serious.</p><p>"We succeeded in our mission!"</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader smiled slightly, asking in return, "Judging by Alliance Leader Bai Li's expression, you must have succeeded as well?  We owe you a debt of gratitude for your ingenious idea."</p><p>"We should thank Elder Ye,"</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader humbly replied, "For our immortal path, we must do our best."</p><p>"I fear you're *too* dedicated,"</p><p>Qing Yun, the West Desert Alliance Leader, coldly snorted, her gaze shifting to Su Nu with an unkind expression and a mocking tone. "The Five Yin Mystical Body.  You actually found one! Taking my disciple with the Yin Meridian would have been better!"</p><p>"It would have been best to take both, but the three of us can only barely protect one while ascending Yitian Peak, using our combined secret technique. Alliance Leader Qing Yun need not worry, the three of us have agreed to share the same fate, whoever we take up there is our collective accomplishment.  Besides, that old demon isn't a fool. If he can’t find the best Nine-Revolution Purple Yin Body to be his vessel, he won’t settle for a simple Yin Meridian body. If we don't find the best, he'll think we haven’t tried our best.  The Five Yin Mystical Body is just right…"</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader examined Su Nu, then added with a hint of regret, "Unfortunately, she's only at the Golden Core stage."</p><p>After taking the pills and the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Su Nu's cultivation soared, but her final breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage failed.</p><p>"Her cultivation time was too short, and her foundation wasn't solid enough. Forcibly breaking through with pills and Soul Cleansing Liquid left her base unstable. Ancient demonic cultivation techniques are already difficult at this stage; the chances of successfully forming a Nascent Soul are already extremely slim, so failure is normal.  A peak Golden Core stage is barely enough; it shouldn't anger the old demon…"</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader explained.</p><p>The three discussed this terrifying matter right in front of Su Nu.</p><p>"What, you really want to give the old demon a Nascent Soul body?"</p><p>The West Desert Alliance Leader impatiently stated, "Less talk, quickly remove the restrictions on her; I need to set up a backup plan."</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader didn't take offense, lifting his hand to dispel the restraints on Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu tried to escape, but before her feet left the ground, she was immobilized again.</p><p>"Quite audacious!"</p><p>The West Desert Alliance Leader coldly snorted, reaching out to snatch Su Nu back.</p><p>Then, the West Desert Alliance Leader flicked her fingers, and numerous restrictions formed a talismans in the air, slowly descending towards Su Nu's forehead, but the North Star Alliance Leader stopped her.</p><p>"No! The forehead is too conspicuous and might be noticed by the old demon!"</p><p>The West Desert Alliance Leader glanced at the North Star Alliance Leader, her eyebrows slightly furrowed.  After thinking for a moment, she shrank the talisman and finally implanted it into Su Nu's left wrist, where it disappeared from sight.</p><p>The North Star Alliance Leader and the East Pole Alliance Leader also took turns using their methods.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance Leader left a phantom sword shadow hidden on her other arm, while the North Star Alliance Leader placed a ring-shaped restriction around Su Nu's waist.</p><p>After carefully checking again, the three were finally relieved.</p><p>Su Nu was completely helpless, able only to watch her body being used as a pawn, manipulated at their will. Although she felt nothing from the restrictions entering her body, she knew deep down this couldn't be good!</p><p>After leaving their backup plans in place, the three Alliance Leaders' figures flickered, positioning themselves around Su Nu, their true energy swirling in their palms, runes flickering and finally condensing into a transparent protective dome, enveloping Su Nu.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>Three people, escorting Su Nu, swiftly moved towards Yitian Peak.</p><p>Upon entering the Zhenling Domain, a powerful pressure bore down, causing their protective barrier to creak and distort.  They continued to pour their energy into the barrier, finally stabilizing it. Su Nu was unharmed.  They then proceeded directly to Yitian Peak.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side of the Zhenling Domain,</p><p>Inside a mountain cave, several figures sat cross-legged, eyes closed, motionless like corpses. One of them was the Demon Lord!</p><p>Suddenly, the Demon Lord’s eyes snapped open, a gleam flashing in them. He stood up, saying,  "Finally!  Mou, let's go."</p><p>A shadowy figure stirred at the cave's edge, emitting a sinister laugh. "I waited so long, I thought your plan had failed."</p><p>"With my preparations, how could I fail? I was merely waiting for a few more players to enter the game…"</p><p>The Demon Lord turned to the others.  "Remain on the periphery. If anything changes, I will lure the enemy down the mountain.  Be ready to activate the Five Elements Reverse Chaos Formation."</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The Demon Lord and Mou Lao Mo left the cave, concealing their presence as they stealthily approached Yitian Peak.</p><p>"I need your help again, Mou,"</p><p>the Demon Lord transmitted his voice.</p><p>Mou Lao Mo replied coldly, "I'm a hunted dog now, gravely injured by you and that old geezer.  I spent everything to recover to eight or nine tenths of my strength. If I don't heal, I can't even maintain my current cultivation, let alone break through.  I’m dependent on you for healing, so what choice do I have?"</p><p>The Demon Lord smiled slightly. "Rest assured, once this is done, I will take full responsibility for your past grievances. Lingzhuzi won't trouble you, and I will help you reach the late Yuan Ying stage."</p><p>"And that kid from the Qiongyu Trading House! I don't care if I have to search heaven and earth, I must find him!"</p><p>Mou Lao Mo gnashed his teeth.</p><p>His current plight was due to his search for Qin Sang.  What infuriated him most was that despite the enormous cost, he didn't even know what the fellow looked like.</p><p>The Demon Lord looked puzzled. "He's probably hiding, scared by you. As long as he's alive, he won't stay hidden forever. I'll use all the power of the Demon Dao to find him.  I want to see what kind of person could force a powerful figure of the Demon Dao to this state."</p>
