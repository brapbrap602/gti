<h1>Chapter 327: The Violet Citadel</h1><p>The other cultivators, like Qin Sang, were afraid of incurring the displeasure of the Nascent Soul cultivator.  Glued to their seats, they craned their necks, staring intently at the parchment.</p><p>However, to the naked eye, the 'parchment' didn't appear unusual at all!</p><p>With the Golden Core cultivator present, the cultivators in the hall, though burning with curiosity, dared not probe with their spiritual power or divine sense.</p><p>"Commander Gao, what exactly is this?"</p><p>The woman in red couldn't contain her curiosity and asked.</p><p>Others also began to murmur.</p><p>"It looks like a piece of animal hide..."</p><p>"Could it be some kind of concealed magical artifact?"</p><p>"Perhaps it's a scripture similar to a jade slip?  Could it contain a cultivation technique left by a powerful being?"</p><p>"Maybe it's a seal of some kind..."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, observing carefully. He was almost certain.</p><p>This piece of 'parchment' was not only the same material as the one he possessed, but also the same size, perfectly square, as if they had been cut from the same larger piece!</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained his piece of 'parchment' along with the Ebony Sword and the Yama Banner when he first arrived in this world. He had tried to examine it countless times.</p><p>When he first stepped onto the path of cultivation and learned to use spiritual power and divine sense, he had tried using them on the parchment.</p><p>Later, when he acquired spells like the Object Manipulation咒 and could open storage pouches, he experimented with the parchment again, but it remained unresponsive.</p><p>After joining the Gloom Yin Sect and learning that the black-robed fiend might have been a sect disciple, he suspected the parchment might be related to the sect and investigated discreetly.</p><p>At the time, he was confined to the Yin Sha Abyss and later sent undercover, so naturally, his investigation yielded nothing.</p><p>After joining Lesser Hua Mountain and learning the secrets of the Gloom Yin Sect from Sun De, Qin Sang speculated that the black-robed fiend, like Shi Hong, was a sacrificial offering chosen by a Core Formation cultivator or true disciple of the Gloom Yin Sect.</p><p>But upon further reflection, he felt that the fiend might not have been a Gloom Yin Sect disciple after all.</p><p>The fiend's cultivation level wasn't high, and he was relentlessly pursued by Song Hua.  It was unclear whether he didn't possess a storage pouch or had lost it during the battle.</p><p>Severely injured, he could only rely on bandits to escape and used demonic arts to devour flesh and blood to survive.</p><p>Perhaps he was a rogue cultivator who had somehow obtained the *Netherworld Scripture* and the Yama Banner. Even if he hadn't perished by the Sinking Water River, he would have eventually succumbed to the Yama Banner's backlash.</p><p>Regardless of the fiend's identity, the Gloom Yin Sect was destroyed, leaving no leads to follow. Qin Sang didn't bother pursuing the matter further.</p><p>Qin Sang had wondered if the conflict between Song Hua and the black-robed fiend was not a battle between righteous and demonic forces, or a personal vendetta, but rather a struggle over this piece of parchment.</p><p>However, investigating through Song Hua proved equally impossible.</p><p>When he met Song Ying, Qin Sang asked to see the letter Song Hua had left before departing. The letter contained no hidden messages, and he found no relevant clues in the Asking Moon Market.</p><p>Years had passed, and no one knew Song Hua's whereabouts.</p><p>In the end, the matter was dropped.</p><p>After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm and organizing his storage pouch, Qin Sang remembered the 'parchment' and examined it again, confirming that his previous inability to understand it wasn't due to his low cultivation level.</p><p>Apart from its unusual durability, the parchment had no other special qualities. Perhaps it was the hide of some妖兽. Such inexplicable items were common in the cultivation world.</p><p>The items found on the black-robed fiend, including the Yama Banner and the *Netherworld Scripture*, weren't particularly valuable in the cultivation world.  The parchment was likely of little worth. Qin Sang's cultivation journey became increasingly challenging, leaving him no time for distractions. He tossed the parchment aside and forgot about it.</p><p>If it weren't for its reappearance at the auction, he would have completely forgotten about it!</p><p>What could the 'parchment' be?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, filled with curiosity and excitement.</p><p>A treasure deemed worthy of a Nascent Soul cultivator's care, stored in a wooden box and presented at an auction, must be extraordinary!</p><p>A fragment of a magical treasure?</p><p>A remnant of a cultivation technique?</p><p>A treasure map?</p><p>Or something else entirely?</p><p>However, Qin Sang was also wary, pondering why the Nascent Soul cultivator concealed in the darkness had chosen to auction the 'parchment' at this particular auction.</p><p>Was the parchment's value not as high as he imagined, perhaps insignificant to a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>Or was it...</p><p>A trap?</p><p>Assuming these two pieces of 'parchment' came from the same source, would one need to collect two or more pieces to unlock their true purpose and value?</p><p>Was the Nascent Soul cultivator, hidden in the shadows, observing the cultivators in the hall, watching to see who recognized the parchment?</p><p>A jolt of fear shot through Qin Sang, his hair standing on end as a sense of foreboding washed over him.</p><p>Fortunately, he was deeply guarded, keeping his wild thoughts to himself, his expression betraying nothing!</p><p>As Qin Sang's mind raced, Gao Yi took the parchment out of the wooden box, raised his arm, and said in a clear voice, "Please remain calm, fellow Daoists. Now, let the senior reveal the true nature of this treasure."</p><p>A golden ray shot out from the darkness, striking the center of the parchment.</p><p>Strangely, the seemingly sharp golden ray vanished upon contact with the parchment, as if absorbed, leaving the parchment unchanged.</p><p>Just as everyone was puzzled, a faint white light bloomed from the center of the parchment, slowly spreading outwards.</p><p>On the previously blank parchment, an image resembling a celestial gate appeared. At the center of the gate, three ancient characters were inscribed in bold strokes—Violet Citadel!</p><p>The three characters of Violet Citadel shone brightly, their strokes resembling coiling dragons and soaring phoenixes, exuding an awe-inspiring aura. The light radiating from them was as sharp as sword qi, making it difficult to look directly at them.</p><p>The image on the parchment appeared incredibly lifelike, with flowing auspicious clouds.</p><p>The celestial gate stood amidst layers of clouds, appearing and disappearing, adorned with intricate carvings of dragons and phoenixes, ancient and extraordinary.</p><p>Regrettably, the celestial gate was severely damaged, riddled with cracks and missing parts. Even the carved dragon's head was half-destroyed, greatly diminishing its grandeur.</p><p>One couldn't help but wonder if a gentle touch would cause the gate to collapse entirely.</p><p>The Violet Citadel revealed!</p><p>Most of the cultivators in the hall, including several suspected late-stage Foundation Establishment experts, were bewildered. However, the woman in red and the Daoist priest wore expressions of shock.</p><p>"The Violet Citadel!"</p><p>The woman in red gasped, covering her mouth. "Could this animal hide be a secret key to the Violet Citadel?"</p><p>Before she could finish, a deep, resonant laugh echoed through the hall.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, some of you juniors are aware of the Violet Citadel's secrets.</p><p>Indeed, the secret key to the Violet Citadel is the key to entering it.</p><p>The spiritual tide is approaching, and the secret key has appeared.</p><p>Once the spiritual tide arrives, the Violet Citadel will open.</p><p>Unless you find a Nascent Soul ancestor to protect you, only those holding the secret key will be eligible to enter the Violet Citadel.</p><p>You juniors may not have sensed it yet, but undercurrents are already stirring in the Lesser Cold Region. The struggle for the secret key is bound to ignite a conflict, and the competition will only intensify in the future."</p>
