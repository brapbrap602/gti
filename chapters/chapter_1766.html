<h1>Chapter 1757: Two Demons</h1><p>“A hundred bodies yield essence, seven spirits abound.</p><p>Infuse your five elements, radiant and pure!”</p><p>Shi Xuan's clear voice rang out.</p><p>As the incantation sounded, the talisman in front of him gradually completed itself. Light and pure, it floated in mid-air like rippling water.</p><p>Shi Xuan pointed at Shen Huo, who was charging ahead. The talisman trembled and shattered.</p><p>At the same time, a torrent of water descended from the heavens above Shen Huo's head, as if a section of the Milky Way had been cut off, pouring into the top of his head.</p><p>Shen Huo and Shi Xuan were close friends, and Shen Huo was prepared for this; his forward momentum did not falter.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang sensed that the water vapor in this area was being drawn towards Shen Huo at an incredible speed, and a blue aura gradually emanated from his body.</p><p>As more and more water vapor gathered, it formed a humanoid silhouette, like a suit of armor crafted from the essence of water, protecting Shen Huo within.</p><p>Simultaneously, Shen Huo's momentum increased dramatically. Like a tiger leaping through the forest, with a single bound he soared above the cliff top.</p><p>From his vantage point, Shen Huo looked down at the temple on the cliff, his face full of killing intent.  He gripped his heavy iron sword tightly, his muscles bulging, emitting a faint blue glow; under the empowerment of Shi Xuan's talisman, even stronger power seemed to infuse him.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>A roar like thunder shook the mountains.</p><p>Shen Huo raised his heavy sword high, moving like a thunderbolt, and struck down at the temple with all his might.</p><p>The temple was quite simple, with almost no noteworthy furnishings, far less grand and ornate than the temples under the Daoist court's jurisdiction; it looked little better than the villages of the ghost people below.</p><p>However, the stones used to build the temple were polished to a mirror-like smoothness, and its layout was square and neat.</p><p>Inside the temple:</p><p>A blue fox was lounging lazily on a soft couch.</p><p>This blue fox occupied the largest room in the temple, indicating its high status.</p><p>Beside the couch stood a jade statue of a fox-headed human, the very same idol worshipped by the ghost people below.</p><p>This statue, however, was far more exquisite and lifelike, clearly a depiction of the blue fox, though its fox body had been artistically transformed into a human form.</p><p>The blue fox seemed half-asleep, lazily watching a group of lesser demons below.</p><p>These lesser demons were sharing offerings presented by the ghost people.  Unenlightened and driven by instinct, they were inevitably squabbling messily.</p><p>The object of their contention were several baskets containing the offerings of blood and flesh from the ghost people.</p><p>These included the flesh of demonic beasts hunted at great risk by the ghost people.</p><p>A few baskets emitted faint cries; upon sensing the contents, the lesser demons could barely contain themselves and soon came to blows.</p><p>For them, the baskets contained exquisite delicacies.</p><p>But the ghost people lived in clusters and were not easy to provoke; these lesser demons normally lacked the ability to seize such offerings. Yet now, the ghost people had presented them willingly.</p><p>All thanks to the King's ingenious plan, they could easily enjoy such delicious blood food!</p><p>The lesser demons who secured the offerings devoured them greedily, their adoration for their King unbounded.</p><p>Then, a roar came from outside the temple.</p><p>The blue fox suddenly sat up, its eyes narrowing as it leaped back, crashing through the wall with a resounding boom.</p><p>The other lesser demons reacted a beat too late, turning their heads to stare blankly as a dark figure descended from the heavens, swinging its sword!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dust and debris erupted from the cliff top.</p><p>The heavy iron sword struck the temple's central axis directly, burying itself deep into the ground and leaving a deep gash.</p><p>An invisible wave spread from the gash outwards; all the stone buildings collapsed instantly. The sword wind swept through, pulverizing all the stones, along with the lesser demons inside, which vanished into smoke.</p><p>With a ‘crack’, the front edge of the cliff, unable to withstand the blow, broke off and plunged into the river below.</p><p>“Who dares to destroy my temple!”</p><p>An enraged scream came from the dust.</p><p>Instantly, the wind and smoke churned, revealing a flurry of claws; the wind was like blades, instantly engulfing Shen Huo.</p><p>“What kind of wild demon dares to call itself a god!”</p><p>Shen Huo retorted sarcastically, showing no fear. He lightly raised his arm, drawing the heavy iron sword from the ground, and with a flick of his wrist, sent three sword images slashing forth.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The seemingly heavy iron sword was wielded with incredible skill in his hands, shattering the flurry of claws, scattering them in defeat.</p><p>A muffled groan escaped Lan Hu's lips as he stumbled back, attempting a counterattack.  Upon seeing Shen Huo and the figures behind him, his expression changed drastically. He tilted his head back and let out a shrill, prolonged cry.</p><p>Shen Huo knew he was summoning reinforcements, but didn't interfere. He rotated his wrist, a cold smile playing on his lips: "It's best to call all the evil gods nearby. Let's take them all down at once!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Shen Huo vanished on the spot, reappearing next to Lan Hu in an instant. He swung his sword to strike.</p><p>Lan Hu's supernatural power was woven into his cry, instantly spreading throughout the mountains.</p><p>From deep within the mountains, dragon roars and tiger howls echoed almost simultaneously.  Demonic energy soared into the sky, bringing with it demonic winds and clouds that tore through the air.</p><p>Shen Huo ignored all this, his eyes fixed on Lan Hu.</p><p>Lan Hu dodged sideways, narrowly avoiding Shen Huo's thrust.  Undeterred, Shen Huo shifted his sword, bringing the flat of the blade down with a powerful blow.</p><p>Seeing the danger, Lan Hu tried to evade again, but a soft shout suddenly reached his ears—"Hold!"</p><p>An amulet appeared above Lan Hu's head, seemingly slow but swift, fluttering down to rest on his forehead.</p><p>Instantly, it felt as if ten thousand tons were pressing down on him. Lan Hu froze in place, unable to move, his eyes wide with terror.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The heavy sword struck with ferocious force, shattering Lan Hu's bones and reducing him to a bloody mess.</p><p>Shen Huo showed no satisfaction.  He abruptly shifted his gaze towards a nearby forest, letting out a cold snort. Before he could move, a figure darted past him, even faster.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled the Lotus Seal from the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" technique. His figure, like smoke, was ethereal and elusive.  In a flash, he appeared at the edge of the woods, reaching out to grasp something. He pulled a Lan Hu from thin air.</p><p>His hand was like an iron clamp, gripping Lan Hu's neck.</p><p>Lan Hu's eyes were bloodshot, struggling wildly.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>Qin Sang tightened his grip slightly, Lan Hu's eyes bulged, his body stiffened, and his breath grew shallow.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Shen Huo's eyes flashed with admiration, praising Qin Sang's sharp grasp of the battle's momentum. He rested his sword and looked towards the deep mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed Lan Hu to Shi Xuan in the rear and looked in the same direction. However, his attention wasn't on the demonic energy. His gaze subtly scanned the peaks.</p><p>In a distant mountain, a chamber had been carved into the mountainside.</p><p>Inside the chamber, a round jade orb emitted a faint glow, illuminating only a few feet around it.</p><p>A voice echoed from the darkness, "Brother Jiu, people from the Daoist Court are here."</p><p>A moment later, a figure approached the orb. It was a powerfully built man with a leopard's head and ringed eyes, comparable in size to Shen Huo before the incantation.  However, he had a striped tiger tail.</p><p>He looked down at the orb, which displayed the scene from the Lan Hu temple.</p><p>Soon, a tall and thin figure emerged from the darkness. This person had a hooked nose and a pair of wings on his back, covered in thick, smooth grey feathers, easily mistaken for a grey robe at first glance.</p><p>"Only a few junior officials of the Cave God rank have arrived; not even a Daoist Court Immortal Official," the strong man said, looking up.</p><p>Brother Jiu remained silent, staring at the orb for a while. Suddenly, he pointed at Qin Sang in the image, "I sense a threat from this person."</p><p>The strong man paused, scrutinizing Qin Sang for a moment, then frowned. "Brother Jiu's innate ability allows him to sense danger.  Lord Liu specifically sent you here; your intuition is unlikely to be wrong.  But does the Daoist Court now have Immortal Officials who practice the Dragon and Tiger Altar arts?"</p><p>"Who says the Daoist Court would necessarily send Immortal Officials?" Brother Jiu countered. "If we are complacent and try to deal with these juniors casually, wouldn't we be falling right into a trap?"</p><p>The strong man thoughtfully nodded. "If Brother Jiu senses a threat, this person is at least a capital-level expert.  A few minor demons disguised as evil gods among the ghost people, and the Daoist Court reacted with such force... We should report back to Lord Liu.  If other places are the same, it proves the path we've prepared for years is correct. Otherwise, they wouldn't react so strongly with such swift action."</p><p>While they conversed...</p><p>The battlefield shifted again.</p><p>Lan Hu's plea for help was cut short as he was captured. The demons who came to aid him weren't deterred.  Soon, seven or eight demonic winds converged, emitting strange howls.</p><p>Within the demonic winds, shadowy figures of jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards flickered. Most possessed stronger auras than Lan Hu, all being demon core stage beasts.</p><p>Sand and stones flew, dark clouds gathered.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shen Huo stood side-by-side.</p><p>Shi Xuan lagged slightly behind, and Luo Yin brought up the rear.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Yin also summoned her altar.</p><p>Unlike Shi Xuan, Luo Yin cultivated a military altar, and received troops from her sect upon entering the Dao.</p><p>The spirit soldiers raised in Jiuhua Cave Heaven were mostly aquatic creatures, all elite.</p><p>Luo Yin's troops were uniformly arrayed, all blue sharks about ten feet long.  The sharks formed their ranks high in the air.</p><p>There was no water in the void.</p><p>The blue sharks sprayed forth essence, which diffused in mid-air, as if creating a lake in the sky.</p><p>“The essence of mountain and river, the spirit of a hundred beauties.</p><p>Forming a canopy, exhaling into clouds.”</p><p>Luo Yin's voice was clear and melodious. Standing on the altar, she performed ritual steps, spinning lightly.</p><p>The blue shark formation shifted accordingly, revealing an array as they moved, the power of the many spirits influencing the heavens.</p><p>Layers of white clouds suddenly rose in the high sky.</p><p>At first, it was only thin vapor, but as the clouds gathered, they became overwhelming, like a canopy spread across the sky, covering everything below.</p><p>Just then, the group of demons arrived, and felt a sense of oppression weigh upon them. They all looked up at the sky, exchanged glances, and let out a simultaneous roar.</p><p>In an instant, the demons revealed their true forms and displayed their various abilities. They split up, all targeting Luo Yin!</p><p>They had only recently been enlightened, but their instincts told them that Luo Yin, who cultivated the military altar, was the greatest threat.</p><p>Shen Huo laughed, casually chose an opponent, and struck with his sword.</p><p>Shi Xuan dashed to stand before Luo Yin. The golden seal altar in front of him rotated slightly, and another talisman flew out.</p><p>“River Split!”</p><p>The talisman vanished in a flash, and a great river suddenly appeared in the sky, its source and end unknown.</p><p>The river acted as a barrier, flowing past Shi Xuan, separating the demons to the other side.</p><p>Luo Yin remained focused on her incantation, ignoring her ferocious opponents.</p><p>Soon, a crackling sound erupted, and torrential rain poured down on several surrounding mountain peaks.</p><p>Amidst the storm, water droplets connected like beads, transforming into sharp water swords.</p><p>In an instant, countless swords hung above the demons, a murderous aura piercing the sky.</p><p>Luo Yin opened her eyes slightly, revealing a killing intent as she glared at the demons.  Thousands of water swords swirled through the air and plunged downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang was not idle either. He chose his opponent, the white tiger at the rear of the demon horde.</p><p>This tiger possessed the highest cultivation; it had also been the one to devise the plan to attack Luo Yin.</p><p>Qin Sang, having observed everything, formed a lotus hand seal, and moved through the demons like a ghost.</p><p>The white tiger's eyelids twitched. It crouched slightly, roared, and shadows appeared on its flanks – two vengeful spirits.</p><p>Both vengeful spirits were wolf demons killed by the tiger, both possessing Spirit level cultivation during their lives, and they charged at Qin Sang together.</p><p>Qin Sang continued with his lotus seal, flashed through the two vengeful spirits, then quickly changed his hand seal to a Demon Crushing seal and pressed it towards the tiger's forehead with lightning speed.</p><p>The tiger was startled, howled, and dared not fight Qin Sang head-on. It turned to flee, and the two vengeful spirits frantically flew back to protect their master.</p><p>Having driven back the tiger, Qin Sang didn't change his target, nor did he try to capture it. He calmly pursued the tiger, always appearing to be about to catch it, yet always falling just short.</p><p>In the hidden chamber, beside the jade orb.</p><p>A strong man watched this scene, a look of confusion on his face.</p><p>“Brother Jiu, this person…”</p><p>Brother Jiu's brow furrowed as he intently watched Qin Sang. After a moment, he suddenly noticed the tiger's escape route, his expression changing drastically. He shouted, “Quickly, go!”</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang in the jade orb suddenly looked up in this direction, a smile on his lips. A spirit sword appeared before him; the sword light flashed and vanished.</p><p>The strong man reacted quickly.  Heeded his companion's warning, and without hesitation, retreated into the cave.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Gray Oriole Sword pierced through the mountain wall's formation barrier, striking the jade orb inside without deviation.</p><p>And its momentum was not exhausted; it continued to pursue the two demons.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely behind.</p><p>He had felt a strange sense of being watched and had the Sky-Eye Butterfly use its abilities to investigate. He discovered a highly concealed formation barrier hidden in the mountain. He sensed two powerful auras nearby.</p><p>In such a remote area, there were suspected demon kings at the Transformation stage lurking.</p><p>With Qin Sang's intelligence, it was not difficult to guess that he had stumbled into another conspiracy. He was already involved, and it was too late to withdraw. Furthermore, he wanted to make his mark in this mountain range. Unless the enemy was overwhelmingly powerful, he had no reason to retreat.</p><p>Even if there was no conspiracy, capturing two powerful demons would earn him merit.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>The two demons retreated hurriedly, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>The sword energy displayed by the Gray Oriole Sword chilled them to the bone. Fortunately, they had a contingency plan.</p><p>When they decided to set up their trap to test the Heavenly Court, they had prepared an escape route, constructing a small teleportation formation.</p><p>When they sensed danger, Brother Jiu immediately activated the formation.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Brother Jiu stepped onto the teleportation formation, reached for the strong man, and the formation's spiritual light flashed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang appeared at the cave entrance. Seeing this, he frowned slightly, and the speed of the Gray Oriole Sword increased dramatically.</p><p>The instant the two demons disappeared, the spirit sword pierced through the strong man's chest, carrying his corpse and embedding it into the stone wall behind.</p><p>The spiritual light dissipated, and Brother Jiu vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang walked over, looking at the now-useless teleportation formation, slightly frowning.  Thinking of the demon's final sinister gaze, he knew he had made another enemy.</p><p>However, he didn't care.</p><p>The other party was very alert, and he made a hasty attack, but being able to leave the tiger demon behind was already good enough; he only regretted not capturing it alive.</p><p>(End)</p>
