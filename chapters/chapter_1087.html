<h1>Chapter 1797: Upheaval</h1><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Nine Lives Mystic Tortoise warned.</p><p>The seal here and the stone gate seal shared the same origin, forming a whole.  Dragon King slowly moved forward, exhausting all his means to pass through layers of restrictions.</p><p>The closer he got to the crystal, the more astonishing the True Dragon's pressure became.</p><p>Dragon King’s Dragon Clan possessed True Dragon bloodline. He used a blood essence secret technique, covering his body in blood restrictions to prevent backlash from the seal, forcibly breaking through the restrictions to approach the crystal.</p><p>He gently touched it. The crystal was icy cold and exceptionally hard.</p><p>He didn't act rashly, carefully sensing and confirming that there were no abnormalities with the seal and the crystal.  He retreated to the ancient temple's entrance, exchanged glances with Nine Lives Mystic Tortoise, and summoned his golden spear.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The golden spear struck the crystal.</p><p>The crystal remained unscathed.</p><p>Suddenly, a dramatic change occurred. The ancient temple trembled, and a crack appeared on the ground beneath the crystal pillar, rapidly expanding and spreading towards their feet in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Within the fissure, an ancient restriction formed a curtain, faintly showing fine cracks.</p><p>A massive tremor erupted, and the crystal vibrated.</p><p>Just as the two demons were about to continue their attack on the crystal pillar, it suddenly became blindingly bright, and an overwhelming dragon's might pressed down.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful suction force erupted from the ancient restriction.</p><p>The sudden change shocked the two demons.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The suction force surged out of the stone temple, causing the Venom Lake to pour in and spread in all directions.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the dragon's might, they had no time to react, not even a chance to use the Heavenly Phoenix Plume, before being sucked into the crack in the curtain.</p><p>…</p><p>Another Venom Lake.</p><p>Grand Sorcerer and Old Devil Fang worked together to decipher the ancient divine rune restrictions.</p><p>There was originally a passage beneath the stone platform.</p><p>They reached the end of the passage and witnessed a breathtaking scene.</p><p>A fiery red divine furnace floated in mid-air.</p><p>The divine furnace was covered in dense ancient divine rune restrictions, clearly an ancient treasure of the Sorcerer Tribe.</p><p>Inside the furnace, a flame flickered, on the verge of extinguishing, yet it radiated a faint warmth.</p><p>The moment they saw the divine furnace, Grand Sorcerer and Old Devil Fang were stunned.</p><p>These were ancient divine rune restrictions they had never seen before, resonating with the natural order of heaven and earth, inspiring awe.</p><p>Generations of Sorcerer Tribe cultivators had searched for countless years, almost turning the Boundless Sea and the surrounding storm belt upside down, but ultimately found nothing, the path of divine runes lost.</p><p>They could only cultivate human cultivation methods.  The only thing left might be the Sorcerer Tribe's witchcraft and Gu techniques, and even those had lost many secrets.</p><p>Now, they finally saw a glimmer of hope!</p><p>After their initial elation, they discovered that the divine runes on the furnace were incomplete, likely due to the furnace's waning power causing the runes to fade.</p><p>Old Devil Fang's figure flickered as he rushed towards the divine furnace, but Grand Sorcerer stopped him.</p><p>“These ancient divine rune restrictions wouldn't appear here without reason. It's likely some kind of seal. Although we and the humans are sworn enemies, our foundations are both within the Inner Sea. We share the same fate. If we unleash a powerful demon, we won't be spared, and countless commoners won't be able to leave Sorcerer God Continent. If it leads to a great calamity, rivers of blood will flow!”</p><p>Grand Sorcerer said gravely, “We can't be reckless!”</p><p>Old Devil Fang snorted coldly, clearly impatient.</p><p>Grand Sorcerer stared intently at Old Devil Fang.</p><p>Finally, Old Devil Fang yielded.</p><p>They joined forces to decipher the ancient divine rune restrictions, progressing slowly. Every move was made with caution, carefully observing the fluctuations of the restrictions, ensuring there were no abnormalities before continuing.</p><p>Each time a restriction was broken, the divine furnace reacted, bringing with it a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Grand Sorcerer activated divine runes and Sorcerer Tribe secret techniques, using his Sorcerer Tribe bloodline to lessen the furnace's hostility.</p><p>To their delight, with each surge of activity from the furnace, more divine runes were activated.  The two were completely engrossed, memorizing every ancient divine rune restriction, hoping to comprehend the Dao of Divine Runes in the future.</p><p>Just then, the divine furnace suddenly hummed, and the flames within surged, becoming crimson.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ground cracked.</p><p>The curtain of ancient restrictions appeared, and then, similarly, a powerful suction force erupted.  The two were fully focused on resisting the might of the divine furnace, and were sucked in without any resistance.</p><p>…</p><p>On Mount Ethereal Peak.</p><p>Three Grand Cultivator level experts surrounded and attacked Ancient Demon. The elder from Four Saints Palace prepared the Demon Subduing Tablet while simultaneously dashing towards the fissure.</p><p>Qing Zhu remained motionless, seemingly calm, but a fierce battle was raging within her. The Demon Soul's resistance was incredibly strong, leaving Qing Zhu unable to divide her attention.</p><p>Ancient Demon frantically advanced towards the fissure.</p><p>The demonic restriction he placed on Demon Qing Zhu remained unresponsive no matter how much he tried to activate it. Either his main body had tampered with it, or Qing Zhu's true soul had used some method to suppress it.</p><p>Being outmaneuvered by his main body was truly frustrating.</p><p>Ancient Demon knew very well that he had only recovered this much strength after devouring the three Nascent Souls, and it couldn't last. Once the Demon Subduing Tablet was restored, or Lady Li and the others repaired the altar, his fate wouldn't be pleasant.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Demon Lord and the others attacked with all their might.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The battle was incredibly intense.</p><p>Heaven and earth darkened, the glow of the sky obscured, the ground shattered.</p><p>Within the fissure.</p><p>The crack in the curtain intersected the altar and seal set up by Four Saints. On the altar was an extraordinarily complex formation, which Demon Qing Zhu had set up while Four Saints Palace had taken away the Demon Subduing Tablet and the ancient restriction’s power had weakened.</p><p>The formation was active, tearing at the altar like iron shears.</p><p>The elder flew to the formation and, following Qing Zhu's instructions, worked to destroy it.</p><p>The altar trembled, debris flew, but it remained intact.  It required the combined efforts of Ancient Demon and Demon Qing Zhu to unleash its full power.</p><p>Currently, Demon Qing Zhu was suppressed by Qing Zhu's original body, leaving only Ancient Demon himself.</p><p>Ancient Demon endured the relentless attacks, using secret techniques to forcibly draw on the unrefined Nascent Soul power within him, even burning his origin.  He roared towards the heavens, gathering all his Demonic Qi, and slammed it into the formation.</p><p>The elder's heart skipped a beat as he dodged.</p><p>The Demonic Qi poured into the formation.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful surge erupted from the curtain, coordinating with Ancient Demon's split soul.</p><p>Astonishing fluctuations erupted.</p><p>The altar cracked, and the seal, unable to bear the strain, dimmed and revealed a weakness.</p><p>Ancient Demon laughed maniacally.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>After the seal was broken, a powerful suction force erupted from within, catching Demon Lord and the others off guard, pulling them into the curtain.</p><p>Ancient Demon's split soul, the elder, and Qing Zhu were also unable to escape.</p><p>In an instant, the fierce battle ceased.</p><p>Moreover, the suction force wasn't limited to this location, but spread throughout the entire crack in the curtain.</p><p>Within the ancient temple on the cliff.</p><p>After the elder left, he sealed the ancient temple, leaving two descendants of Four Saints Palace behind, instructing them not to leave.</p><p>The fissure appeared, the cliff split open, and boulders tumbled down.</p><p>This was the source.</p><p>With their ancestor still missing, the two were filled with anxiety. The young man went to inform their ancestor, while the young woman stayed behind to guard the ancient restriction.  Both were also swept away by the suction force.</p><p>Great change was imminent.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A section of Mount Ethereal Peak collapsed!</p><p>A thunderous roar suddenly echoed from the depths of the valley, causing the entire valley to tremble violently.</p><p>Outside the Spirit Suppression Domain, the Demon Kings and Nascent Soul Ancestors exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what was happening inside.</p><p>Phoenix King Nine initially thought the undercurrents in the Venom Lake might be normal, but now she realized that something unexpected had definitely happened on Mount Ethereal Peak.</p><p>She flew out of the Spirit Suppression Domain, turned to look at Mount Ethereal Peak, her expression shifting uncertainly.</p>
