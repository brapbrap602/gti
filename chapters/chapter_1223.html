<h1>Chapter 1215: The Blood Lake</h1><p>"This is the place!"</p><p>After a relentless chase, Qin Sang, relying on the divine abilities of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, finally managed to lead the Snake King to the Sealed Lake while being pursued by the Old Demon Ye. Qin Sang was intimately familiar with the ancient restrictions here. With a swift movement, he entered the dark clouds, effortlessly passed through the ancient seals, and arrived at the bottom of the lake. He then used the Ebony Sword to stir the lake's seal, reopening the passage.</p><p>At that moment, the figure of Old Demon Ye appeared above the dark clouds.</p><p>Throughout the journey, he had nearly lost track of his target several times. It seemed as though the other party was more familiar with the Abyssal Ruins than he, the supposed master of the land. By now, if Old Demon Ye still couldn't deduce that Qin Sang possessed a treasure specifically designed to break seals, it would be a waste of his years of cultivation.</p><p>After staring at the dark clouds for a moment, Old Demon Ye realized that the ancient restrictions here had already loosened. Breaking them wouldn't be difficult, but it would undoubtedly waste some time.</p><p>At the main altar of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King surfaced from the water.</p><p>"Brother Mingyue, so this is where you entered from. Had I known earlier, I wouldn't have hidden it from you that day. If we had come here together and explored the Abyssal Ruins first, perhaps none of this would have happened..."</p><p>After fighting side by side for so long, the Snake King and Qin Sang had shed some of their wariness and developed a mutual trust, addressing each other by name. The demonic aura around the Snake King had dissipated, and his injuries were severe.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "I also went through quite a bit of trouble to find this place..."</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the exit of the secret realm, only to find numerous cultivators from the Sin Abyss patrolling nearby. Clearly, they had received word and were searching for the exit.</p><p>Exchanging a glance, they both knew that Old Demon Ye would soon catch up, and they had no choice but to force their way through.</p><p>"After we get out, we'll split up and draw them away," the Snake King transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang had the same thought.</p><p>At the bottom of the Heavenly Scar, a patrol of four guards ventured into a black forest.</p><p>"Senior Feng sent us to find the entrance to the Abyssal Ruins. How come we've never heard of it before? Besides that cave, does the Sin Abyss have another entrance?" one of the guards asked, full of confusion.</p><p>"These secrets are not for us to know. Since both seniors mentioned it, it must truly exist. They probably want to take advantage of the tremors in the Sin God Palace to make it easier..."</p><p>The man suddenly trailed off, staring dumbfounded at a pile of rubble outside the forest.</p><p>The others followed his gaze and noticed unusual fluctuations emanating from the rubble. Then, they saw two figures emerge from the ripples.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A sword and a blade instantly ended the lives of the four guards, but a sharp bell sound still rang out in the distance. At the same time, they sensed the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator rapidly approaching.</p><p>"Sigh! We were a step too slow. They managed to send a signal," the Snake King sighed softly, summoning a demonic wind and soaring into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang fled in the opposite direction.</p><p>Chaos erupted within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>At that moment, Old Demon Ye finally caught up, following the trail. He spread his divine sense to its limit, locking onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Outside the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed his Thunder Escape technique to the limit, shaking off the other pursuers, but he still felt a faint, elusive divine sense locked onto him from afar.</p><p>"Sigh! The gap in cultivation is all-encompassing. Some things cannot be compensated for by treasures or divine abilities. After I return, I must find a way to obtain the Ancestral Sacred Flame as soon as possible and cultivate the 'Seed of Golden Lotus' to enhance my divine sense. At least then, facing such situations in the future, it will be easier to shake off divine sense locks."</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, combining sword and thunder escape, increasing his speed once more.</p><p>In broad daylight, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of heavenly lightning, cutting across the sky.</p><p>Mortals thought it was a falling star.</p><p>Only cultivators could sense the powerful aura within the lightning, trembling in fear.</p><p>Old Demon Ye assumed Qin Sang was using some透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支秘术透支</p>
