<h1>Chapter 1023 The Ancient Demons</h1><p>Chapter 1023 The Ancient Demons</p><p>“Have her demonstrate the changes in her demonic wings.”</p><p>Bai instructed.</p><p>Qin Sang complied.</p><p>Su Nu was secretly surprised, unable to fathom why Qin Sang was so persistent about the demonic wings, and seemed to understand them so well.</p><p>She dared not disobey Qin Sang’s order, steadied her breath, and activated the demonic wings.  They sometimes transformed into streaks of light, speeding across the expanse, and sometimes enveloped her body like bone armor.</p><p>…</p><p>“I remember now.  My enemies who sealed me away, many possessed similar demonic wings. They were called demons. Not demonic cultivators, but true demons.</p><p>“Demonic energy is to them what spiritual energy is to cultivators.</p><p>“The demon barrier, the demonic fire – these were left behind by the demons.</p><p>“The demons are our great enemy.</p><p>“To counter the demons, our human cultivators tried to analyze captured demonic techniques. We discovered that a portion of human cultivators with special constitutions could directly cultivate demonic techniques. But I don’t recall any ‘True Demon Technique.’ My memory may be incomplete, or it might have been distorted over time.”</p><p>Bai’s voice was low.  He paused, then continued, “However, the ancient demons of this world have long since vanished.  Any techniques are inconsequential. This girl likely possesses a special spiritual body, allowing her to directly cultivate demonic techniques using demonic energy. My mind is in turmoil. I need to sort things out…”</p><p>With that, Bai fell silent.</p><p>After breaking the demon barrier, Bai recovered more and more memories, until today, finally recalling the enemy who sealed him and his followers away.</p><p>“Ancient demons…”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>In his many years traversing the cultivation world, he seemed to have encountered very few rumors related to the ancient demons.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang suddenly recalled something.</p><p>“The Abyss of Sin! When I entered the Purple Micro Palace, the Abyss of Sin launched a surprise attack. A terrifying six-armed demonic shadow appeared, unimaginably large and incredibly powerful. Could it have been an ancient demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed, a sense of worry rising in his heart.</p><p>Returning to Xiaohan Domain, he wasn’t sure if it was a good or bad omen.</p><p>The ancient cultivation world was far different from the present.  Legends spoke of Mahayana cultivators transcending tribulation to become immortals. The cultivation and power of those cultivators were unimaginable now.</p><p>The ancient demons existed in Bai’s era.  To have been such a formidable enemy to the cultivators, a single demon barrier was enough to seal Bai and his subordinates, condemning them to eternal oblivion. This showcased their terrifying power.</p><p>If the Abyss of Sin colluded with the ancient demons, could the combined forces of Xiaohan Domain and the Skyward Alliance withstand them?  Upon returning, he might receive news of the destruction of both domains.</p><p>When the nest is destroyed, the eggs cannot survive.</p><p>If Xiaohan Domain suffered a catastrophe, his friends and acquaintances would likely perish.</p><p>Regardless, he had to return, to retrieve the Nine Phantasmal Heavenly Orchid. With his current strength, as long as he remained low-profile and focused on self-preservation, he shouldn't have to worry too much.</p><p>He would observe the situation and then decide whether to stay in Xiaohan Domain or return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, collected his thoughts, and noticed Su Nu looking at him timidly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak, but his brow furrowed slightly as he turned his head toward the distance.</p><p>The next moment, two streams of light appeared at the edge of the ice field, two people speeding towards them. Judging by their speed, they were both late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>“My senior brothers are here!”</p><p>Su Nu said joyfully.  Seeing Qin Sang’s frowning silence, her heart tightened, and she quickly suppressed her joy. “Friend, rest assured, they are my senior brothers, and they have always cared for me deeply.”</p><p>People from the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Su Nu intently.</p><p>Their purpose was clear, heading straight for this direction.  It seemed that there was something about this woman that guided them.</p><p>Since Bai had recovered some of his memories, there was no point in staying. To investigate the origins of this demonic technique, he would probably need to find the leader of the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t want to confront the people from the East Pole Alliance.  Without saying anything more, he slightly moved his phoenix wings, his figure transforming into a streak of light as he departed in the opposite direction.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang became a green speck, disappearing into the vast ice field.</p><p>Su Nu didn't expect Qin Sang to leave so silently and abruptly. She stared blankly at the direction of his departure, blinking her eyes, her expression unusual.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two figures sped towards her, landing on either side of Su Nu.</p><p>One was a large, burly man; the other seemed rather elderly, looking like a man in his fifties, with a long beard on his chin.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>The burly man let out a long breath, his breathing somewhat labored.  He complained, “Junior sister, you made us and my senior brother search for quite a while. Didn’t you say you’d find a safe place to wait for us to meet up, and not wander off on your own? Why did you run so far?”</p><p>The elder with the long beard narrowed his eyes, looking at the place where Qin Sang disappeared. He said sternly, “Junior sister, who was that person just now? Did they harm you?”</p><p>“Senior brothers, you misunderstand.  It was thanks to that cultivator that I managed to survive…”</p><p>Su Nu explained the situation.</p><p>The two were enlightened.</p><p>A strong man, still shaken, muttered, "So close! So close! I wonder which sect that brother belongs to. I must report this to my master and the alliance leader and thank him properly!"</p><p>Su Nu shook her head, regretting, "He wouldn't reveal his identity. I don't know his background."</p><p>"In the trial grounds, we are all rivals; caution is natural. We'll meet again someday, junior sister, just keep it in mind," the elder with a long beard comforted her, then seemed to remember something, "What? Third brother hasn't arrived yet?"</p><p>The third brother was the handsome young man who had died at Su Nu's hands.</p><p>Su Nu's expression remained unchanged, calmly saying, "I was chased by a ferocious beast and ran here without seeing Third brother. Perhaps something delayed him."</p><p>The two others didn't suspect anything and looked around, but saw no one.</p><p>The long-bearded elder said, "The three of us should be able to move freely in the Xuanbing Plain now. No need to wait here; let's go and wait for our brother to join us. Junior sister, heal your wounds first, we'll keep watch."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Su Nu replied obediently, glanced at the direction where Qin Sang disappeared, and then followed.</p><p>...</p><p>Regardless of what Su Nu and the others were discussing about him.</p><p>After flying some distance, Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword to clear the way and released the white crane.</p><p>The deeper into the Xuanbing Plain, the more difficult it became to travel.</p><p>However, Qin Sang successfully crossed the ice plain and completed the second trial.</p><p>Straight ahead,</p><p>a faint light screen blocked the way. Qin Sang paused, recalled the white crane, deactivated his transformation, and walked forward.</p><p>Passing through the light screen, the intense cold disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself in a square courtyard, with stone benches and chairs everywhere. Several cultivators were resting there.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's arrival, someone opened their eyes, looked at him for a moment, then looked away, concentrating on their recovery.</p><p>"These people... are the first echelon..."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed; indeed, each of them possessed a powerful aura, the best among the cultivators.</p><p>"No Nascent Soul masters are here. It seems the trials for both groups of cultivators are separate. That's only normal; otherwise, who would dare to compete with a Nascent Soul master?"</p>
