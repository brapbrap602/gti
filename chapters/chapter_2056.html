<h1>Chapter 2047: The Qilin Awakens</h1><p>Returning to Luohua Temple, after closing herself off to recover, Qin Sang didn't immediately emerge. She carefully recalled the details of the treasure refinement process, systematically organizing the sequence of events and verifying them against her understanding of the art of refinement. She felt she had greatly benefited from the experience.</p><p>Only after summarizing her insights did Qin Sang leave her seclusion, finding Master Yu Hong waiting outside.</p><p>"Have the other daoists left?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Master Yu Hong replied, "Master Tonghu is still in seclusion. The other elders are still guests in the mountains at the Abbot's invitation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, understanding that Madam Shuanghua and the others likely shared her intentions and hadn't departed.</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, I have selected several promising individuals from the Ju Fu clan for your consideration," Master Yu Hong continued.</p><p>Qin Sang responded, "Thank you for your efforts, Abbot and Master. Where are they now?"</p><p>Master Yu Hong pointed towards the foot of the mountain.  "They are all waiting at the dwellings at the foot of the mountain. If Elder Qin is interested, I can bring them up."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Qin Sang had a sudden idea and stopped Master Yu Hong from going down. "Let them come up themselves."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang waved her right arm, releasing a wisp of spiritual energy that transformed into a billowing mist in mid-air, enveloping the entire mountain.  She then sat cross-legged on a nearby rock.</p><p>Using his spiritual sight, Master Yu Hong saw several simple barriers set within the white mist.  Understanding Qin Sang's intention to test them, he remained where he was and used his magic to send a message to the foot of the mountain.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, amongst the bamboo forest, several rows of dwellings were built.  A dozen or so Ju Fu clan members, men and women, were cultivating within the dwellings. Qin Sang worried that the Ju Fu clan was too attached to Luohua Temple, so she had set a requirement for their cultivation—they were all roughly at the Golden Core stage of human cultivation, still with potential for improvement.</p><p>Since birth, they had been instilled with the idea that Luohua Temple was their superior sect, and being chosen by the Temple's masters to serve them was an honor.  The entire clan looked to the Abbot's elders as role models.</p><p>Now, an opportunity arose to follow a cultivator of the Abbot's caliber. The Ju Fu clan members saw this as the greatest opportunity of their lives, something they would strive for with all their might, not daring to be the slightest bit negligent.</p><p>While diligently cultivating, they heard Master Yu Hong's message.  Their spirits lifted. Pushing open the doors of their dwellings, they were surprised to find a white expanse outside, making it impossible to see.</p><p>Their dwellings were close together, their companions a stone's throw away, yet they couldn't sense their companions' auras.  Remembering the message's content, they suppressed their anxieties and individually headed towards the mountaintop. As they moved, they discovered something else unusual—an invisible pressure descended from the void, pinning them to the ground. Not only could they not fly, their blood circulation was hindered, and attempts to use their abilities felt obstructed, their consumption increased several times over. Their usual reliance was useless, making each step upwards incredibly arduous.</p><p>They didn't know what awaited them ahead. Some were apprehensive, while others quickly regained their composure, ascending step by step.</p><p>In the white mist, a dozen figures crawled towards the mountaintop, gradually widening the gap between them.</p><p>Master Yu Hong watched, pondering silently.  These Ju Fu clan members were the best of their clan, their talents varied, but judging by Qin Sang's barriers, she clearly valued their character and resilience more.  Even as servants, Qin Sang didn't want to have any misfits around.</p><p>The test lasted most of the day, before the first Ju Fu clan member broke through the mist and reached the summit.  Nearly collapsing, drenched in sweat, he was about to lie down and sleep when he saw Qin Sang and Master Yu Hong.  He was about to salute when he heard someone shout from behind, "Brother!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  With another wave of her hand, the mist instantly dissipated.  The others still struggling in the mist were gently sent back to the foot of the mountain, realizing they had been eliminated, their frustration needless to say.</p><p>The first to reach the summit were two brothers. They stepped forward together to pay their respects. "Greetings to the two Masters!"</p><p>Both brothers were nervous, afraid that the Master would only take one of them, separating them.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "What are your names?"</p><p>"My name is Qing Jia!"</p><p>"My name is Qing Yi!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Master Yu Hong, "Let's take these two. Would your Temple be willing to part with them?"</p><p>Master Yu Hong readily agreed, immediately saying to the two brothers, "Quickly pay your respects to Elder Qin!"</p><p>"I have several spirit beasts, all of whom call me 'Grandfather.' You will do the same. Your cultivation is too low. You must diligently cultivate, otherwise, you won't even be qualified to guard my cave," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>Two brothers, faces etched with apprehension, knelt and cried out, "We humbly obey your instructions, Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. He was about to inquire about the differences between the cultivation methods of the Yi people and the human race, when a sudden intuition caused him to pause.  His eyes flashed with surprise. Rising, he addressed Master Yu Hong, "I still haven't fully grasped the insights from my recent breakthroughs. Let's not disturb Madam Shuanghua and the other cultivators for now.  Please summon me again after Master Tong Hu emerges from seclusion."</p><p>He then ordered the brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi to guard the entrance before hurrying into his secluded chamber, where he sat cross-legged.</p><p>Just moments ago, he had sensed an unusual fluctuation emanating from the fire lotus in his Purple Mansion; the Kirin Primordial Seed seemed to be stirring!</p><p>Since incorporating the Kirin Primordial Seed into the lotus heart, following Zhuque's instructions, and incubating it within the fire lotus, approximately eight hundred years had passed. This was the first time the seed had shown any activity besides when Qin Sang actively manipulated it.</p><p>Initially, when refining the Kirin Primordial Seed, Qin Sang hadn't anticipated such a lengthy process, spanning the entire Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>And now, at last, he saw the dawn of success!</p><p>Qin Sang sealed his cave and erected a protective array before eagerly summoning the fire lotus.  A flash of firelight appeared between his brows, and the fire lotus slowly floated out, seemingly unchanged from before.</p><p>"Something's happening?"</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang summoning the lotus, Zhuque also flew out and gazed at the lotus heart with immense anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. With a thought, he caused the lotus petals to unfurl layer by layer, revealing the ‘lotus seed’—the Kirin Primordial Seed.</p><p>For centuries, Qin Sang had steadily drawn essence from the Kirin Primordial Seed.  Later, guided by Zhuque, he shifted his strategy to incubate the Kirin's true spirit. A deep connection had formed between him and the seed.</p><p>It still appeared as a lotus seed, but its inner essence was almost completely depleted. The current seed was essentially a reconstruction painstakingly woven by Qin Sang's spiritual sense.</p><p>In fact, as Qin Sang extracted the seed's essence, his spiritual sense had been steadily growing stronger. However, much of it was bound to the Kirin Primordial Seed, preventing him from directly benefiting. The external growth of his spiritual sense came solely from his cultivation advancements, giving him no advantage over other cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Fearing that the Kirin had left some hidden measure, a way to annihilate the Kirin true spirit's essence, Qin Sang proceeded with extreme caution. This portion of his spiritual energy, born from absorbing the seed's essence, could mimic a similar aura, thus deceiving the true spirit.</p><p>The Kirin Primordial Seed resembled a cocoon; the creature within was alive, but its shell had been subtly replaced.</p><p>Even with this accomplishment, Qin Sang dared not rashly disturb the Kirin true spirit, and his actions remained extremely cautious. He carefully transferred a small amount of essence to the seed periodically—better too little than too much.  The Kirin true spirit gradually grew stronger in this subtle manner, yet remained dormant.</p><p>The Kirin true spirit was much like Master Luo Hua's jade ruler—a mass of chaotic spirituality, failing to develop true consciousness, or perhaps its consciousness remained in a deep slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a better solution, so he allowed it to evolve naturally.</p><p>Now, the Kirin true spirit finally reacted!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the fire lotus.  He saw the lotus heart, affected by the fluctuations from the Kirin Primordial Seed, flickering erratically.</p><p>The fluctuations were extremely faint, and Qin Sang didn't perceive a true consciousness.  Yet after careful examination, a glimmer of understanding dawned on him. The Kirin Primordial Seed was intrinsically linked to the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique.  By fully activating this technique, he could perhaps induce a transformation.</p><p>Just as he was about to initiate the secret technique, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and stopped.</p><p>"Why'd you stop?!"</p><p>Zhuque squawked, extremely displeased.</p><p>It had long coveted the Kirin, as finding the Kirin's true essence was crucial for its own speedy recovery.</p><p>It also harbored a secret ambition—to one day call Qin Sang "Little Qin," a thought that filled it with immense satisfaction.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang’s hesitation enraged Zhuque.</p><p>Qin Sang's concern was their location within another sect's territory. Any disturbance, even attracting a Heavenly Tribulation and causing a major upheaval, was something he wanted to avoid.</p><p>This was not impossible.  He didn't know how long the Kirin had been dormant or what methods it had used to avoid Heavenly Tribulations.  Before proceeding, he needed to make thorough preparations.</p><p>Ignoring Zhuque's displeasure, Qin Sang waited a while longer.  Seeing that the fluctuations hadn't ceased, he withdrew the fire lotus into his Purple Mansion.</p><p>Investigating the Kirin Primordial Seed took several days.  Soon after, Master Yu Hong reported that Master Tong Hu had emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang left his chamber, and seeing brothers Qing Jia and Qing Yi diligently guarding the entrance, he said, "We'll be leaving soon. Go and bid farewell to your families."</p><p>These pills refine the body, strengthening and invigorating.  Your family should be able to absorb their essence. Consider them a gift from me.”</p><p>“Thank you, Master!”</p><p>The two brothers were filled with gratitude, knowing they had chosen a worthy master. Their joy lessened the sorrow of parting from their family.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the brothers and flew with Master Yu Hong to Lady Shuanghua’s private chamber.</p><p>“Elder Qin has arrived!”</p><p>Everyone present rose to greet them.  After working together to refine the treasure, they were all familiar with each other, dispensed with formalities, and took their seats.  Lady Shuanghua spoke, “Elder Qin, thanks to the Abbot’s invitation, we have all greatly benefited.  My fellow Daoists and I have discussed holding a small Daoist discourse to exchange insights on artifact refinement. What are your thoughts, Elder Qin?”</p><p>This coincided perfectly with Qin Sang’s own idea. He immediately agreed, "I would be honored!"</p><p>Lady Shuanghua nodded with pleasure. “Unfortunately, the spiritual treasure’s transformation failed, and it seems the Abbot and Master Quan have both entered seclusion due to important matters at Luohua Temple, so we cannot disturb them. In my opinion, since we have already troubled Luohua Temple for quite some time, perhaps we should choose a different location for our discourse?”</p><p>Everyone agreed and left the chamber, flying towards the main peak together.</p><p>The current head of Luohua Temple was a nun named Qiluo.  Master Qiluo invited them to stay a few more days, but they politely declined.</p><p>“We should wait for the Abbot and Master Quan to emerge from seclusion to bid farewell properly, but we have many matters to attend to and dare not stay any longer. Please convey our apologies to Master Qiluo, we must depart now!”</p><p>Master Qiluo opened the mountain gates wide, escorting the Daoists outside the temple.  After waiting a moment, the brothers QIngjia and Qingyi arrived hastily. Qin Sang summoned a cloud beneath his feet, gathering the brothers, and flew away with Lady Shuanghua and the others.</p><p>They flew towards Yanling City. Master Tonghu remembered an uninhabited island along the way with exceptional scenery, so he suggested they go there.</p><p>Upon arrival, the island truly possessed magnificent peaks and waters; if it weren't for the thin spiritual energy, it would have been occupied by cultivators long ago.</p><p>They found a mountain peak to land on, seated themselves by a stream, and each took out exquisite fruits and fine wines, placing them on the water's edge for a flowing drinking game. The brothers Qingjia and Qingyi, along with Lady Shuanghua’s daughter, stood by their side.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, you should still remember the secret technique the Abbot had us perform, correct?”</p><p>This was the true purpose of the discourse.  Barely settled, Master Tonghu couldn’t contain himself and brought it up.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances and nodded slightly.</p><p>By combining everyone's understanding of the technique, even if they couldn't reconstruct the complete technique, the combined strength of these master artifact refiners might allow them to comprehend a unique new technique.</p><p>Lady Shuanghua had the highest cultivation, so she presided over the discourse. She gently opened her lips and eloquently recounted her insights from the treasure refinement process.</p><p>Everyone listened intently.  After a while, realizing Lady Shuanghua had held nothing back, they were moved and listened with rapt attention.</p><p>Lady Shuanghua’s voice was like celestial music.  Everyone forgot to enjoy the spiritual fruits and wines before them. Even after she finished, the lingering resonance held them captive, and for a long time, no one spoke, only the sound of the clear stream could be heard.</p><p>They didn’t rush into discussion. Next, the unusual pair took their turn, the male and female heads speaking alternately, one sentence at a time, yet their ideas were exceptionally clear and unique.</p><p>With Lady Shuanghua as an example, others were less inclined to withhold information.  Even Qin Sang shared his own insights.  </p><p>It was crucial to understand that what they discussed included not only Luohua Temple’s secret technique but also their unique understanding based on their own lineages, proving very helpful for others.</p><p>After their individual presentations, they began to question each other, then further elaborated on their respective interpretations.</p><p>Days turned into nights.</p><p>They discussed profound Daoist principles, forgetting the passage of time, completely unaware that the wildflowers by the stream had bloomed, withered, and faded into autumn hues, only to be overcome by winter, their stems frozen above the snowline, preserving life in their roots until the spring.</p><p>They lost track of how many dawns and dusks passed.</p><p>Finally, Master Tonghu let out a long sigh and stretched enormously.</p><p>Everyone awoke as if from a dream, feeling the coldness of the stone beneath them.</p><p>A cultivator with the surname Yu reached out, melting the ice. He picked up his jade cup and drank deeply, exclaiming, “This was truly a worthwhile trip!”</p><p>Everyone deeply agreed, turning to Lady Shuanghua.</p><p>Lady Shuanghua used her finger as a pen, manipulating her true energy to draw in mid-air. One by one, luminous characters formed at her fingertips, eventually forming a mysterious scripture.</p><p>“We came here because of Luohua Temple. This scripture is born from the techniques of Luohua, like a dream, and I name it ‘Luohua Dream Interpretation.’ What do you all think?”</p><p>Lady Shuanghua’s beautiful eyes swept across the gathering, seeing everyone’s agreement. She then wrote the four characters at the top, took out five blank jade slips, and inscribed the scripture onto them, giving one to each person.</p><p>()</p>
