<h1>Chapter 1420 Xuan Tian Palace Master</h1><p>Held in Qin Sang's hand, it felt cool and heavy.</p><p>What Tan Hao handed over was not just the jade pendant, but also the hope he had placed in it.</p><p>Qin Sang squeezed it tightly.</p><p>Although he didn't know how many years he would have to wait before he had the chance to go to the Central Continent and the possibility of encountering the Ghost Mother was extremely slim, Qin Sang still solemnly thanked him.</p><p>Ya Gu's (Deaf Girl's) face was rosy and her breathing was steady.</p><p>To outsiders, it would seem she was simply asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and put away the jade pendant.</p><p>Then, Tan Hao spoke about their later experiences.</p><p>"Senior knew a path through the storm belt. We came to the North Sea, only to find that it was already the territory of the Demon Clan. We were almost chased and killed by a Demon King. After much difficulty, Senior obtained the contingency plan left behind previously. After his injuries improved and he regained some strength, he infiltrated the Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>Tan Hao was interrupted by Qin Sang when he mentioned the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>"What was that Senior's cultivation level?"</p><p>Qin Sang assessed the Ghost Mother's strength in his heart. She had been sealed by Heavenly Master Tian Yue, so she shouldn't be at the Deity Transformation stage, right?</p><p>However, not fearing the Xuan Tian Palace and wreaking havoc in the Xuan Tian Palace were two different things.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo, as well as some top experts in the mid-Nascent Soul stage, had the strength to not fear the Xuan Tian Palace, and the Xuan Tian Palace would try to avoid offending them.</p><p>Once they angered them, and they retaliated on the disciples of the Xuan Tian Palace, the Xuan Tian Palace would be in a terrible predicament.</p><p>But even Old Devil Hunmo could not act recklessly in the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Tan Hao said with shame, "My cultivation level is low. When Senior made a scene in the Xuan Tian Palace, I was only following instructions and doing a few small things outside. I didn't see Senior's full strength with my own eyes…"</p><p>As he spoke, Tan Hao paused, suddenly remembering something, "Senior seemed to vaguely mention that the Xuan Tian Palace Master was not quite normal, and had not appeared in public for a long time. I also heard some rumors that the Xuan Tian Palace Master rose to fame much earlier than Old Devil Hunmo."</p><p>"Not quite normal."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these four words.</p><p>From their brief exchange, Old Devil Hunmo displayed strength that was not simply that of someone who had just broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, but that of an old and powerful expert who had dominated the Boundless Sea for many years.</p><p>Let's assume that the Xuan Tian Palace Master was stronger than Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>There were many reasons for the abnormality of a cultivator.</p><p>For example, attempting to use a secret technique to break through and failing, suffering a backlash.</p><p>For example, a bizarre method of prolonging life.</p><p>For example, suffering serious injuries during tribulation.</p><p>…</p><p>"Yes, the possibility of serious injuries during tribulation is very high. The power of the Heavenly Tribulation is stronger each time. If one cannot break through to Deity Transformation, a Great Cultivator will eventually perish."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and muttered to himself, "This kind of injury is the most difficult to recover from. No wonder the Xuan Tian Palace was first infiltrated by the Ghost Mother, and then a treasure was stolen by the white-clothed man."</p><p>He thought of the ice box lying quietly in the Thousand Jun Bracelet.</p><p>Could it be a sea chart inside?</p><p>On second thought, he felt that the possibility was very small. The white-clothed man's strength was similar to that of the early Nascent Soul stage. He didn't have the ability to go to the Central Continent. The sea chart was of limited value to him.</p><p>If the white-clothed man was a cultivator of the Xuan Tian Palace, when his cultivation level reached a certain point, he would definitely have the opportunity to see the sea chart. There was no need to take such a big risk.</p><p>"Apart from the Xuan Tian Palace Master, others pose much less of a threat to me."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and signaled Tan Hao to continue.</p><p>Next was his experience in the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>The Ghost Mother seemed to have failed to obtain what she wanted in the Xuan Tian Palace, so she had to risk destroying the seal and infiltrate the Pure Sea Sect to obtain the sea chart here.</p><p>"Senior said that when the Pure Sea Sect was in crisis, they used the strength of the entire sect to form a seal. The Golden Peak and the Buddha Pagoda were like two pillars of the seal, and now they can only barely support it. Well, the medicine garden and other places will more or less affect the stability of the seal."</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at Qin Sang, knowing that he must have noticed it, "Destroying the restrictions in these places will cause the seal to collapse faster. Senior opened the Buddha Pagoda and took away the treasures inside. She only picked a few of the most precious spiritual medicines in the medicine garden. Several magical artifacts were placed in the Golden Peak, but Senior didn't take them. These things were originally waiting for me to reach the Nascent Soul stage before I went to take them myself. At that time, it would be the day of the Pure Sea Sect's destruction."</p><p>Tan Hao looked helpless and distressed.</p><p>These treasures were considered compensation from the Ghost Mother for not being able to save Tan Jie and fulfill the agreement.</p><p>When Tan Hao reached the Nascent Soul stage and obtained all the treasures, the wealth of an ordinary sect would not be comparable to his.</p><p>The duck that was about to be cooked flew away just like that.</p><p>However, recalling the benefits he had gained from the morning bells and evening drums during his time in the Pure Sea Sect, according to the Ghost Mother's guidance, Tan Hao felt slightly relieved.</p><p>The opportunity to form a Nascent Soul was more precious than any treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded upon hearing this.</p><p>He had noticed the abnormality before.</p><p>The light of the restrictions on the Buddha Pagoda was dimmer than that of the Golden Peak, so the Ghost Mother had already been inside.</p><p>Besides the sea chart, what other treasures were inside? Was there any Soul-Calming Incense?</p><p>However, Soul-Calming Incense was not something he absolutely had to have.</p><p>"Time is of the essence, let's quickly pick the most precious spiritual medicines and leave this dangerous place," Tan Hao sighed.</p><p>Knowing that Old Devil Hunmo had been attracted here, Tan Hao had completely given up on the magical artifacts in the Golden Peak. He didn't think Qin Sang had the strength to compete with Old Devil Hunmo either.</p><p>If Old Devil Hunmo found out that someone had beaten him to it, their situation would be dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal and looked pensive.</p><p>While communicating with Tan Hao, he constantly observed the outside world through the Nascent Soul Puppet, paying attention to Old Devil Hunmo's movements.</p><p>Now it was certain.</p><p>Five Nascent Souls had already entered the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Besides Old Devil Hunmo and Monk Chijie, they were all unfamiliar faces.</p><p>Valley Master Mu and Qi Wang were nowhere to be seen, probably meeting with misfortune.</p><p>Too far away, Qin Sang couldn't see their expressions clearly.</p><p>Of the three newly arrived Nascent Souls, one was in the mid-Nascent Soul stage and two were in the early Nascent Soul stage. On the surface, they had no conflict with Old Devil Hunmo. It was unknown whether they were afraid of Old Devil Hunmo or had already agreed on the terms of distribution.</p><p>So many people coming in at once was something Qin Sang had not expected.</p><p>"It seems that Old Devil Hunmo doesn't understand the Great Formation of the Pure Sea Sect as well as I previously thought. Without the guidance of the Fire Jade Centipede, perhaps that old devil took the initiative to find helpers and break the formation together."</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Old Devil Hunmo's intentions.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo ambushed them, but joined forces with others.</p><p>This also made sense.</p><p>After all, the four of them had already reached an agreement and would definitely unite against outsiders.</p><p>For Old Devil Hunmo, the three newcomers were not only fewer in number, but they also wouldn't completely trust each other, posing no threat to him.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's original plan.</p><p>If there were only Old Devil Hunmo and Monk Chijie, he would lie in ambush in the dark, waiting for an opportunity. If the Buddha treasure was born, he would seize the opportunity to strike and have a certain degree of confidence in escaping.</p><p>But in the current situation, without the opportunity to divide the other party.</p><p>Qin Sang had to consider his own safety first.</p><p>He wasn't so arrogant as to fight one against five.</p><p>Having obtained the Myriad Spirit Fruit, he had already achieved his goal. Weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang would most likely choose to retreat.</p><p>However, unexpectedly meeting Tan Hao gave Qin Sang new ideas.</p>
