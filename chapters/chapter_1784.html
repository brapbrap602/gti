<h1>Chapter 1775: Bestowal of the Talisman</h1><p>Outside Immortal Lake.</p><p>The sky was clear and boundless.</p><p>A white cloud sped southward, its speed clearly unnatural. Any cultivator would know at a glance that a fellow Daoist was employing a spell.</p><p>Dozens of figures stood atop the cloud. At the forefront was a middle-aged Daoist priest, manipulating the cloud.</p><p>Behind the Daoist were people of all ages, half of them vibrant young boys and girls. They stood on the cloud, looking around curiously. Only when they saw the hills below, the size of houses, did they realize they were high in the air, and moved closer to their elders.</p><p>Gazing at the Daoist's back, the young boys and girls all wore expressions of anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang was among them.</p><p>After befriending Master Qi, Qin Sang continued gathering information and occasionally visited Master Qi's residence for guidance.</p><p>Through days of investigation, Qin Sang had gathered more and more information and learned many secrets.  A plan gradually formed in his mind: to obtain the High Divine Firmament Talisman of the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions!</p><p>According to his findings, the talismans of the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions were of the same kind.</p><p>Like the talismans of Mount Tao Heng, the High Divine Firmament Talismans of the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions were also two-tiered: the Supreme Youthly Attendant, Spirit Officer, and General Talisman, and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Talisman.</p><p>Regardless of the Dharma lineage, even within the two branches of the Daoist sect and the Daoist Court, the initial-stage talisman was the Supreme Youthly Attendant, Spirit Officer, and General Talisman.</p><p>However, although the names were the same, the scriptures and methods differed, and the corresponding Spirit Officers and Generals were also distinct, not to be confused.</p><p>Due to the discord between the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions, with proper strategy, Qin Sang could obtain two talismans separately from each mansion. This would allow him to quickly construct the altar for his Ascension to Profundity Dharma Position and then seek ascension qualifications from the Daoist sect.</p><p>From then on, at least until he reached the Body Integration stage, he could cultivate peacefully without worrying about talismans.</p><p>Ascension was not easy, and Qin Sang planned to consult True Person Zhi Jian first.</p><p>However, he hadn't yet visited True Person Zhi Jian on Sword Heart Island, intending to wait until after receiving the High Divine Firmament Talisman before paying his respects.</p><p>But before seeking the High Divine Firmament Talisman, Qin Sang had one more thing to do.</p><p>For him, the biggest hidden danger now was the fear of being discovered for having an extremely high cultivation base without having undergone the talisman bestowal ritual, something he couldn't explain.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's original plan, he would first receive the talisman from a relatively weak sect.  In case of any unforeseen circumstances, it would be easier to handle. Once he possessed the altar, he could join a renowned sect and switch to his desired talisman without worry.</p><p>But after investigating, Qin Sang discovered things weren't so simple.</p><p>Switching talismans was called "Adding a Talisman" in the Daoist Court, jokingly referred to as "promotion."  The sects on Mount Ju seemed to lack the ability to perform the Adding Talisman ritual.</p><p>Moreover, ordinary people didn't have the need to add talismans.</p><p>In this world, scriptures and talismans were considered separately.</p><p>Especially outside the Daoist sect, the purpose of cultivators receiving talismans was primarily to resist the Six Heavenly Ancient Qi. Most still cultivated their own inherited techniques.</p><p>Therefore, as long as the talisman was similar to their inherited techniques and didn't cause conflict, there was generally no thought of switching talismans after receiving one.</p><p>If one developed animosity with the sect that bestowed the talisman, there was no need to switch.  Upon breakthrough, one could choose another talisman with similar properties and ascend within a different sect.</p><p>For instance, Mount Tao Heng specialized in Water element Dharma. If a disciple betrayed the sect, they could conceal their identity and, upon breakthrough, receive another Water element talisman.</p><p>The altar constructed this way might not be as stable as one built with a consistent lineage, posing potential risks in the future, but ninety-nine percent wouldn't live to see that day.</p><p>At least, Qin Sang had interacted with many experts and hadn't yet found any sect in Star Island Immortal Lake capable of performing the Adding Talisman ritual.</p><p>Following his original plan might ultimately lead him to seek the Daoist Court. It was better not to take the detour and settle it once and for all.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang decided to participate in a talisman bestowal ritual first to confirm whether his cultivation would be exposed during the process.</p><p>If exposure was unavoidable, Qin Sang didn't want to be targeted by the Daoist sect. Only by directly controlling the sect could he keep his secret. This would prevent him from choosing a target among the renowned sects.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang found a sect outside Star Island Immortal Lake and obtained the qualification for the talisman bestowal.</p><p>The Daoist piloting the cloud ahead was Dharma Master Yang Luo, a Golden Core cultivator from the Three Suns Sect.</p><p>The Three Suns Talisman bestowed by the Three Suns Sect's altar was a Fire element talisman. Most importantly, this sect would sell some of its talisman bestowal qualifications to outsiders each time.</p><p>Qin Sang had now dispersed all his true essence, leaving his Qi Sea empty. He disguised himself as a young boy who had just embarked on the path of cultivation, following Yang Luo to the Three Suns Sect for the talisman bestowal.</p><p>The others were accompanied by their teachers, while he was alone. The other young boys and girls stealthily cast curious glances at Qin Sang.</p><p>However, although Qin Sang came alone, Dharma Master Yang Luo dared not neglect him because Qin Sang's 'master' was a True Person.</p><p>The young boys and girls were still immature. After the brief novelty and excitement wore off, they began whispering amongst themselves, cautiously at first, then chattering away as they saw no one restricting them.</p><p>At this moment, Dharma Master Yang Luo, standing at the edge of the cloud, suddenly turned around.</p><p>Everyone instantly fell silent.</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo's gaze swept over the young boys and girls. He said coldly, "Your elders should have explained the rules of the talisman bestowal ritual to you. I will emphasize them again! Three masters will be present at the ritual. I am your recommending master.  If you offend me, I can still tolerate it. But if your behavior is improper and angers the Bestowing Master or the Supervising Master, you will be expelled. Even if your elders are present, there will be no leniency. Moreover, your spirit stones will not be refunded!"</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo's expression was stern.</p><p>The young boys and girls were all frightened, some even trembling slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang and their elders knew Dharma Master Yang Luo's words were true.</p><p>The Bestowing Master was the one presiding over the talisman bestowal ritual.</p><p>The Supervising Master held a higher position, occupied by a person of high virtue and prestige, at least an elder of the sect, responsible for overseeing the altar.</p><p>Both had the authority to expel or even kill those who disrupted the talisman bestowal ritual.</p><p>It was said that the Daoist sect also had Six Altar Protecting Masters to ensure the entire ritual strictly adhered to Daoist protocols.</p><p>Then, Dharma Master Yang Luo explained some more rules. The young boys and girls nodded vigorously, no longer in the mood for jokes.</p><p>...</p><p>The cloud descended rapidly, and everyone felt a jolt beneath their feet.  As the cloud dispersed, they found themselves on a stone platform atop a cliff.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo walked along the stone steps towards the summit, and everyone quickly followed.</p><p>After a short while, a young man approached them.</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo stopped and greeted him with a smile, "Third Senior Brother, where are you going?"</p><p>"Oh, Ninth Junior Brother is back."</p><p>The young man glanced over the people behind Dharma Master Yang Luo. "Is the sect holding another talisman bestowal ritual? How are the aptitudes of these disciples you've brought?"</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo shook his head slightly. "None of them are disciples of our Three Suns Sect.  Their aptitudes are irrelevant to us."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood behind, watching the two converse.</p><p>Hearing Dharma Master Yang Luo's words, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he scanned the group.</p><p>Since arriving in this world, Qin Sang had discovered there was no concept of 'spirit roots,' but aptitudes still varied.</p><p>He had discreetly examined these young boys and girls. They all possessed Fire spirit roots, clearly having connections.</p><p>After exchanging a few words with Dharma Master Yang Luo, the young man was about to leave when Dharma Master Yang Luo quickly called out, "Senior Brother, do you know which elder is serving as the Supervising Master for this ritual?"</p><p>The young man pondered for a moment, then said, "It should be Martial Uncle's turn this time."</p><p>"So it's Martial Uncle."</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo breathed a sigh of relief. Not only were they closely related, but Martial Uncle's reputation for leniency was also well-known. He didn't need to worry about being reprimanded.</p><p>Next, Dharma Master Yang Luo settled them in a dormitory and hurriedly left, not returning until seven days later to take everyone to the Three Suns Sect's Bestowal Courtyard.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang finally got to witness the Three Suns Sect's ancestral altar.</p><p>Unauthorized personnel were barred from entering the Bestowal Courtyard.</p><p>They were first led into a courtyard with a plaque bearing the inscription "Three Suns Ancestral Altar" hanging above the gate.</p><p>Inside the courtyard was a vast plaza, with a large, round, two-handled incense burner placed in the center, from which fragrant smoke curled upwards.</p><p>At the back of the plaza stood a grand hall, its roof enveloped in a purple haze, with a plaque hanging above – "Three Suns Hall."</p><p>By the time they entered, there were three groups of people in the plaza, all standing outside the incense burner, totaling several hundred.  These were the three types of disciples participating in the talisman bestowal.</p><p>The first were the disciples of the Three Suns Sect, the second were the vassals of the Three Suns Sect, and the third were outsiders like Qin Sang.</p><p>The doors of the Three Suns Hall were tightly shut. In front of the hall stood a few young Daoist priests, some holding banners, some pacing back and forth.  The atmosphere was somewhat solemn, yet there was a sense of crudeness.</p><p>"Didn't Father say the talisman bestowal ritual was very grand?"</p><p>Beside Qin Sang, a young girl looked disappointed, turning to the young man beside her, her older brother.</p><p>The young man behaved calmly, shaking his head slightly. "Father was referring to the Daoist sect's talisman bestowal ritual.  He was once fortunate enough to witness it. He said that not only was the ceremony magnificent, but the rules were also extremely numerous. From opening the altar and inviting water, altar presentation and rituals, submitting documents and making pronouncements, arranging the altar and offering incense, to receiving the divine presence, inviting the master, paying respects to the deities and ancestors, then submitting memorials, making vows, and concluding with gratitude to the sacred ones, and so on. It was incredibly elaborate. The Three Suns Sect is not a direct lineage of the Daoist sect, lacking their reverence. They simplify wherever possible. A few days ago, Dharma Master Yang Luo explained the ritual procedures to us in the air, and that counted as the altar presentation and rituals."</p><p>The girl nodded vaguely.</p><p>At this moment, a Three Suns Sect disciple walked over, glanced around, and shouted coldly, "Silence!"</p><p>Instantly, there wasn't a sound.</p><p>Suddenly, a chime rang out, and the doors of the Three Suns Hall slowly opened.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, taking in the scene within. At the back of the hall stood two statues, the founding ancestors of the Three Suns Sect.</p><p>A long table was placed before the statues.</p><p>The statues and the table occupied only a tenth of the hall's space. Inside the Three Suns Hall, the most striking feature was a Dharma altar.</p><p>The altar's structure resembled the altars Qin Sang had seen before, similarly divided into three levels: a circular altar on top, an octagonal altar in the middle, and a square altar at the bottom, symbolizing the Three Heavens and Three Realms.</p><p>This altar was the Three Suns Ancestral Altar!</p><p>At this moment, the Three Suns Sect disciples filed out, holding divine banners, and lined up in two rows in front of the Three Suns Hall.</p><p>Only two Daoist priests remained inside the hall. One was an elderly man, an Ascension to Profundity True Person, and the other, a Daoist priest with a high topknot, was also nearing Ascension to Profundity cultivation.</p><p>The two stood before the offering table, holding incense sticks, respectfully bowing to the ancestral statues and reciting scriptures.</p><p>Qin Sang listened carefully for a few lines and recognized they were reciting the Daoist sect's "Incantation for Inviting the Talisman," albeit altered beyond recognition.</p><p>The Daoist sect implored the deities for their talismans, while the Three Suns Sect attributed everything to their sect's ancestors.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and the others waiting for the talisman bestowal were also led by the Three Suns Sect disciples in chanting the "Incantation for Inviting the Talisman." The content was nothing more than beseeching benevolence and requesting the bestowal of the divine talisman.</p><p>The Three Suns Sect's ritual was indeed simple. After reciting the "Incantation for Inviting the Talisman," the bestowal could begin.</p><p>The first to receive the talisman were the direct disciples of the Three Suns Sect.</p><p>The young boys and girls on the far left side of the plaza stepped forward one by one.  At the very front was a slender young man.  After receiving permission, he entered the Three Suns Hall, his expression filled with nervousness.</p><p>"Kneel!"</p><p>The Daoist priest with the high topknot stood before the ancestral altar and barked, he was the Bestowing Master for this ritual.</p><p>The elderly Daoist priest was the Supervising Master, standing beside the altar.</p><p>The young man trembled and knelt down.</p><p>The Bestowing Master lightly waved his whisk, turned, and bowed to the heavens.  Without any visible action from him, the Three Suns Ancestral Altar suddenly erupted in golden light.</p><p>The golden light was dazzling, making it impossible to look directly at. If not for the Three Suns Hall's restrictive formations, the surrounding peaks would have been bathed in golden brilliance.</p><p>As the golden light subsided, Qin Sang saw a golden seal floating above the Three Suns Ancestral Altar.</p><p>There seemed to be inscriptions on the golden seal, but they constantly shifted, impossible to decipher.</p><p>The Bestowing Master turned to look at the Supervising Master.  Seeing the Supervising Master nod, he made a hand seal.</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. Although he couldn't directly probe with his divine sense, he had a feeling that after the golden seal appeared, the ancestral altar seemed to resonate with some unknown power.</p><p>A talismanic shadow flew out from the altar and transformed into a blank golden talisman before the young man's forehead.</p><p>"Channel your divine sense."</p><p>The Bestowing Master commanded, simultaneously slicing the young man's palm with his whisk and extracting a drop of blood essence.</p><p>Those who came to participate in the talisman bestowal had already entered the Dao, but their divine senses were extremely weak.</p><p>However, with the Bestowing Master's assistance, the young man successfully channeled a wisp of divine sense, merging it with the drop of blood essence into the blank golden talisman.</p><p>In the next moment, the golden talisman displayed an aura identical to the young man's.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The Bestowing Master formed a hand seal, and the golden seal on the altar shot out a beam of golden light into the talisman, leaving its mark.</p><p>The golden talisman split into two. One part drifted into the young man's forehead, while the other flew back to the ancestral altar, spontaneously combusting and instantly turning to ash.</p><p>This act was called "Burning the Talisman," reporting to the Divine Court and announcing to Yin and Yang.  Only after this step was the talisman bestowal complete, granting the disciple the qualification to summon ghosts and spirits.</p><p>A joyful expression appeared on the young man's face.</p><p>With the talisman integrated into his body, even without having constructed the altar, he felt an unprecedented sense of stability.</p><p>After entering the Dao, he hadn't dared to continue cultivating.  Now, he could finally cultivate normally.</p><p>The young man kowtowed and retreated, and the second disciple entered the hall.</p><p>In this manner, each disciple received the talisman one by one. After all the Three Suns Sect disciples were finished, it was the turn of the Three Suns Sect's vassals, and finally, the external cultivators.  At last, it was Qin Sang's turn.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand out.  Like the others, he knelt on the cushion, gazing at the golden seal on the altar.</p><p>Up close, the feeling was clearer. The Three Suns Ancestral Altar and the golden seal emitted a strange fluctuation he had never encountered before.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The blank golden talisman appeared before him.</p><p>Qin Sang softened his palm, having already separated a wisp of divine sense.</p><p>The Bestowing Master noticed nothing, merging his blood essence and divine sense into the blank golden talisman and stamping it with the seal. Immediately, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable connection form between himself and the talisman.</p><p>"No abnormalities…"</p><p>Qin Sang observed the Supervising Master with his peripheral vision.  The ancestral altar, the golden talisman, and those conducting the ritual were all normal.  They hadn't detected his true cultivation!</p><p>The Bestowing Master was about to burn the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped him. "Wait!"</p><p>Everyone stared at him in astonishment.</p><p>"I'm not receiving the talisman," Qin Sang said, shaking his head and standing up.</p><p>"What did you say?" The Bestowing Master was dumbfounded. He had never encountered such a situation.</p><p>"I've changed my mind. I don't want the Three Suns Talisman," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Insolent wretch!"</p><p>The Supervising Master flew into a rage, a murderous glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Opening the altar and bestowing talismans not only consumed vast amounts of spirit stones and materials, but the number of bestowals each time was limited.  Once confirmed, it couldn't be changed.  This was a wasted opportunity.</p><p>Dharma Master Yang Luo, outside the hall, was filled with anxiety, quickly transmitting a message to his Martial Uncle, explaining this person's background.</p><p>The Supervising Master's face twitched. He shattered the golden talisman in anger and struck Qin Sang with a palm, roaring, "Get out!"</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Under the gazes of varying expressions, Qin Sang spun out of the hall and flew out of the mountain.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
