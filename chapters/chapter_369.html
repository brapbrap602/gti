Chapter 362: Insights on Artifact Refinement


It turned out they were uncle and nephew. Qin Sang had thought Song Yi was Song Chengxian's son.
"How are they doing now?"
Song Yi said, "My grandmother is cared for by my mother and several elders.  She's still very healthy. My uncle passed away many years ago."
Song Chengxian was dead?
The last time they met, he was a newborn. Now, years later, he was gone.
Shopkeeper Wu was also quite old.
Qin Sang, having experienced the trials of the Great Sui journey, only sighed; she was hardly moved.
"My uncle was ambushed in Yun Cang Marsh and severely injured.  He deteriorated shortly after returning home. I was still young then.  He, despite his condition, guided me onto the path of cultivation, and thenâ€¦"
Song Yi's voice choked.
Qin Sang sighed softly. Song Chengxian's talent wasn't good. Although she had left him a Foundation Establishment Pill and some cultivation resources, his solitary path must have been incredibly difficult.
The path of immortality is cruel, and Song Chengxian was not alone in this.
Thinking this, Qin Sang asked, "Who was the culprit? Have you found them?"
Song Yi wiped away his tears, saying, "My uncle killed the assailant on the spot.  The person was a lone cultivator, and no one sought revenge. I haven't been affected."
Qin Sang nodded, dismissed Song Yi, and asked Shopkeeper Wu, "What's on your mind?"
She could guess why he had summoned her.
Shopkeeper Wu stood, took out a jade slip, and offered it to Qin Sang.
Qin Sang frowned, glanced at the jade slip, but didn't take it.  She stared into Shopkeeper Wu's eyes, displeasure evident on her face.  "Daoist Wu, what is the meaning of this?"
Shopkeeper Wu didn't retract the jade slip.
"When Song Yi first came, I recognized him as a Song family member. He bears a striking resemblance to the two Song children.
"This child is intelligent, kind-hearted, and possesses three spiritual roots. While his talent isn't top-tier, it's a true spiritual root, giving him a chance at Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare trouble Daoist Qin.
"I have no offspring, and this child is quite dear to me. All I can do is pass on my lifelong learning and give him as much help as possible; it would be a fitting end to our master-disciple relationship.
"Daoist Qin, this jade slip is an heirloom, containing the accumulated alchemic insights of several generations of my ancestors.  It may not interest you.
"However, the slip includes notes from an unknown senior who was once a disciple, a Daoist attendant, to a Golden Core cultivator of the Xu Ling Sect. He witnessed the entire process of that Golden Core cultivator refining artifacts.
"Later, this senior recorded his observations.
"My ancestor unintentionally obtained this jade slip and, using it as a guide, began to learn the way of artifact refinement.
"Seeing Daoist Qin's interest in artifact refinement, I wonder if the contents of this jade slip might be of use to you?"
Under Shopkeeper Wu's expectant gaze, Qin Sang considered it, then took the jade slip, and used her spiritual sense to examine its contents.
The first thing she saw were the alchemic insights of Shopkeeper Wu's ancestors.  Their cultivation was generally low, and they dedicated their lives to artifact refinement, with no hope of ascension.
Qin Sang quickly scanned it, finally reaching the message from the unknown senior.
After carefully reading it, Qin Sang fell into thought.
The contents of the jade slip, though not written by the Golden Core cultivator himself, provided a very detailed description of the artifact refinement process. Even more valuable were the instructions from that senior's master during the refinement process, recorded verbatim.
Being from the Xu Ling Sect, their insights into artifact refinement were unique compared to other sects.
Qin Sang had the method for refining the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring in her storage pouch, but the details required further contemplation.  This jade slip would be invaluable for future studies.
Once she broke through to the Golden Core stage, she would likely receive secret techniques from Mount Shao Hua, but that was for later.
What moved Qin Sang most was that this seemed to help with the Ebony Sword, especially the parts from the Golden Core cultivator.
She could only understand a small part of it now, yet she already sensed some gains. If she could fully comprehend it, the Ebony Sword's ability to absorb spirit wood would definitely improve significantly.
With that thought, Qin Sang opened her eyes and made a decision.
She still had an unused recommendation for a disciple.
With Song Yi's three spiritual roots and her recommendation, joining Mount Shao Hua should be a sure thing.
Moreover, Song Yi was a Song family member.
Shopkeeper Wu likely knew about her connection to the Song family, and approached her with a hopeful attitude.
"After joining Mount Shao Hua, Song Yi will be a disciple of the sect. If a senior later takes a liking to him and accepts him as a direct disciple, he'll have to choose a new master."
Qin Sang reminded Shopkeeper Wu.
Shopkeeper Wu replied calmly, "As long as it's good for him."


Wu Dianzhu having already thought it through, Qin Sang said no more.  She summoned Song Yi, produced a jade pendant, and gave it to him.  "When Shaohua Mountain next opens its doors to accept disciples, take this token. If questioned by the disciples of Daomen Peak, tell them the truth."

Song Yi hesitated, unsure whether to accept it. He looked to Wu Dianzhu, asking, "Master...?"

Wu Dianzhu urged him, "Hurry and thank Senior Qin!"

Only then did Song Yi accept the pendant and formally bow to Qin Sang.

"No need for such formality," Qin Sang said, smiling as she helped Song Yi to his feet. "Your master and I are of the same generation. You should call me Aunt Qin. Shaohua Mountain isn't overly strict, but after joining, you'll have to do some chores. The steward of Daomen Peak is friendly with me, and I've put in a good word; they should look after you.  But these are minor things.  You must focus on your cultivation. Once your skills improve, returning to your ancestral home will be easy."

When Song Ying left Wenyue Market, she voluntarily relinquished all Song family holdings there, signing the necessary documents.

When Qin Sang first reached the Foundation Establishment stage, she didn't act. Firstly, her foundation was still weak. Secondly, Song Chengxian was too young and had not yet entered the Dao, so there was no good reason to disrupt the rules of Wenyue Market.

Now, it's left for Song Yi to handle, as a test of his mettle.

With Qin Sang's promise, both Wu Dianzhu and his disciple were overjoyed.

Qin Sang chatted with Wu Dianzhu for a while longer, leaving some spiritual materials for him to refine into magical tools.  She was about to visit Old Lady Jing when she received unexpected news.

"Old Lady Jing closed her shop and left Wenyue Market over twenty years ago. Nobody's seen her since. With her gone, the members of the secret shop met a few times privately, but contact has dwindled. Her shop remains, however. You can leave a message charm; she'll see it upon her return."

Qin Sang was surprised. "Wu Dao You, do you know where Old Lady Jing went?"

Wu Dianzhu shook his head.  "She left no message before departing. I have no idea."

After bidding farewell to Wu Dianzhu, Qin Sang arrived at the secret shop to find the doors firmly shut, with no sign of Old Lady Jing.  A protective barrier was in place.

After some thought, Qin Sang took out a message charm, explained the situation, and sent it through the barrier before leaving the market.
