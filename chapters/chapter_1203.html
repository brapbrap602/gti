<h1>Chapter 1195: The Heavenly Scar</h1><p>The Abyss of Sin, anciently known as the Heavenly Scar, is the largest chasm in the North Star Realm. This Heavenly Scar stretches almost straight from north to south, cutting through the majority of the Abyss of Sin and dividing its territory into eastern and western halves. After cultivators discovered the Palace of the Sinful Deity deep within the Abyss of Sin, some began to refer to the Heavenly Scar as the Abyss of Sin. Over time, the name "Abyss of Sin" became the common term for the surrounding region and its factions.</p><p>On the geographical map drawn by Senior Sister Qingjun, most of the prominent sects of the Abyss of Sin are situated along the Heavenly Scar. To be as close as possible to the Heavenly Scar, some sects are even built in close proximity to one another, sharing a single major spiritual vein. Although spiritual veins can be moved, doing so requires significant effort to set up formations, especially for super spiritual veins that serve as the foundation of a sect. These cannot be moved too far, primarily due to the abundant cultivation resources found within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>It is said that the narrowest part of the Heavenly Scar spans hundreds of miles, while its widest point is immeasurable. To mortals, it is an insurmountable chasm. Within its depths, rare spiritual herbs and treasures abound, and those with great fortune may even stumble upon ancient relics left behind by cultivators of old, allowing them to ascend to greatness in a single step. However, opportunity is always accompanied by danger. The deeper one ventures into the Heavenly Scar, the more the terrain narrows, and the more ancient restrictions one encounters. These restrictions are incredibly perilous, having claimed the lives of countless cultivators.</p><p>The Heavenly Scar is somewhat akin to the Boundless Valley, though far larger in scale. Of course, it cannot compare to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. At the deepest and most dangerous core of the Heavenly Scar lies the Palace of the Sinful Deity. Since its discovery, the Palace of the Sinful Deity has always appeared simultaneously with the Purple Subtlety Palace, suggesting an intricate connection between the two secret realms. In the past, when relations between the regions were more amicable, cultivators from all three areas joined forces multiple times to explore these secret realms, hoping to uncover their mysteries and reveal the secrets of the Purple Subtlety Palace. Unfortunately, they returned empty-handed every time.</p><p>It wasn’t until the Demon Lord Ye led his forces to the immortal formation of the Purple Subtlety Palace and ambushed the cultivators of the two regions that it was confirmed the Palace of the Sinful Deity and the Purple Subtlety Palace were connected.</p><p>"...The Abyss of Sin is currently under heavy military pressure, with most of its experts stationed at the Celestial March Plateau. This makes it an opportune time to venture into the Abyss, as it is relatively less guarded than usual," explained the Serpent King.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that it was quite a coincidence that the Serpent King was also heading to the Abyss of Sin. The Serpent King had earlier mentioned that the ancient demon's cave was located deep within the Heavenly Scar, but this was still a vague description. Since Qin Sang was already planning to go to the Abyss, traveling with them would not only increase the chances of finding treasures but also provide mutual support in case of danger. However, Qin Sang did not immediately agree and decided to ask for more details first.</p><p>"Aside from the two of you, who else will be joining us?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>He assumed that, barring any surprises, the group would consist of other demon kings, as they were the only ones with the leisure to venture into the Abyss of Sin under such circumstances. To his surprise, the Serpent King shook his head and said, "To be honest, Qianji's strength is insufficient, so he cannot join us. The other companions are not demon kings from the Heavenly Demon Ridge but rather fellow cultivators I met during my travels in the desert."</p><p>"There are cultivators at the Transformation Stage in the desert as well?" Qin Sang asked, surprised.</p><p>Upon reflection, he realized that the vast North Star Desert, despite its barrenness, could naturally give rise to a few Nascent Soul or Transformation Stage demons.</p><p>The Serpent King nodded. "Indeed! The cave was actually discovered by another fellow cultivator. After the duel ended, I immediately sent word to them, hoping to invite Fellow Daoist Mingyue to join us. However, they were concerned that Fellow Daoist Mingyue, having just advanced to the Transformation Stage, might not have fully mastered his abilities and could become a liability. I was unable to convince them until news spread of Fellow Daoist Mingyue's recent slaying of the Demon Lord Pei, which shook the cultivation world. Only then did they confirm Fellow Daoist Mingyue's extraordinary strength and agree to the plan. If Fellow Daoist Mingyue feels that leaving now would be difficult to explain to the human faction, Qianji can temporarily take your place at the Triple Pass. After all, we are all one family..."</p><p>The Serpent King spoke at length, addressing all of Qin Sang's concerns.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang's expression turned hesitant, and he asked, "May I ask, Fellow Daoist, how confident are you about this treasure hunt? And where exactly is the location of the cave?"</p><p>He felt something was off.</p><p>Qianji Demon King's strength was not weak among early-stage Transformation cultivators. It was only because Qin Sang had the upper hand that he had been defeated so quickly. Yet, Qianji was deemed unqualified to join this expedition. Even with the assistance of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to break through restrictions, they were still being so cautious. This gave Qin Sang an idea of just how dangerous the venture would be.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang began to consider backing out.</p><p>The Serpent King hesitated for a moment. "I hope Fellow Daoist can understand. Only if you agree can I disclose all the information. Alternatively, Fellow Daoist could make a heart demon oath..."</p><p>Qin Sang had a good impression of the Serpent King and did not wish to deceive him with a heart demon oath. He waved his hand and said, "Let me name a few places, and you can simply answer whether the demon's cave is near any of them..."</p><p>Qin Sang listed several locations.</p><p>Without hesitation, the Serpent King replied, "I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Mingyue to be so familiar with the Abyss of Sin! Indeed, the cave is near one of those locations. Fellow Daoist should now understand why we are being so cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>The places he had mentioned were all the locations of the prominent sects in the Abyss of Sin, as well as some important secret realms similar to the Palace of the Sinful Deity. Some of these places were so dangerous that even Senior Sister Qingjun avoided them.</p><p>"I fear I may not be up to the task..." Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He was mentally calculating whether the potential rewards were worth the great risks of venturing into an ancient demon's cave.</p><p>Seeing this, the Serpent King quickly added, "In a few months, the ancient restrictions will enter a period of weakness. During this time, we have also gathered several methods to break through the restrictions. With the assistance of Fellow Daoist Mingyue and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, we will surely navigate the situation with ease and enter the demon king's cave without alerting the Abyss of Sin. The reason they have been hesitant is that they are reluctant to share the treasures with another person. After the mission is completed, Fellow Daoist Lu, who discovered the cave, will have the first pick of the treasures, and the rest will be divided equally. However, in my opinion, the most important things are the cultivation techniques and secret arts collected by the ancient demon. These will not be monopolized by anyone but shared among all of us!"</p><p>The Serpent King's tone was filled with temptation.</p><p>An ancient demon's cave that had never been opened before was an immense lure for any demon king.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was dealing with Qin Sang.</p><p>"Thank you for your kind offer, Fellow Daoist, but I'm afraid I cannot join you," Qin Sang said as he stood up and bowed, expressing his refusal.</p><p>"Won't you reconsider, Fellow Daoist?" the Serpent King asked, incredulous.</p><p>Before coming, he had never imagined that Demon King Mingyue would refuse.</p><p>Finding a cultivation technique or Daoist art in an ancient demon's cave that could provide inspiration for future cultivation would make the journey worthwhile. Obtaining an ancient tribulation-crossing secret art would be an even greater stroke of luck.</p><p>Demon King Mingyue was skilled in thunder escape techniques and possessed other divine abilities and treasures, giving him more than enough ability to protect himself. If even this level of danger could deter him, he would be unworthy of the title of demon king!</p><p>"I regret to disappoint you, Fellow Daoist..." Qin Sang did not elaborate further.</p><p>He couldn't very well say that he was a fake demon king and that the allure of demonic cultivation techniques and secret arts was not particularly strong for him.</p><p>The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique could only be used to cultivate the physical body, and while he had unexpectedly obtained the essence blood of a Green Luan, it could only be integrated into his wings.</p><p>If the risks weren't so great, he might have considered it. But stirring up trouble in the enemy's lair, going through immense hardship, and potentially obtaining secret arts that he might not even be able to cultivate—Qin Sang would not engage in such a futile endeavor.</p>
