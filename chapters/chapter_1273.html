<h1>Chapter 1265: Jade Bones and Brocade Skin</h1><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Crash...*</p><p>After being attacked, the cage shook violently, its black chains rattling as the inscribed runes flickered incessantly.</p><p>Jingyu sensed the danger and quickly summoned her Thunder Prayer Beads, conjuring a protective barrier.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>Dozens of crimson lightning bolts shot out, striking the barrier. The Thunder Prayer Beads trembled for a moment but soon stabilized, firmly blocking the blood-red lightning.</p><p>After testing the waters, a glimmer of delight flashed in Jingyu's eyes. However, she didn't rush to act. Instead, she continued to attack the seal while carefully observing the skeletal remains within the cage.</p><p>The skeleton was humanoid, with features resembling those of a human, but its frame was significantly larger than that of an ordinary person. It was unclear whether it belonged to an ancient race closely related to humans or if it had cultivated some unique technique.</p><p>The bottom of the blood pool didn't just seal this one being. There were several similar cages, each containing its own prisoner. Among them, the cage at the center of the blood pool had the strongest seal. The ancient cultivator that Elder Ye and Qingjun were searching for was imprisoned within that very cage.</p><p>This ancient cultivator had managed to survive until now, his skeletal remains suppressed alongside him at the bottom of the blood pool. In life, his cultivation had likely been on par with the ancient cultivator's.</p><p>This place was the core of the Blood Prison. Outside, there was the Black Tower Formation, and inside, the blood pool cages provided layers of defense. Yet, even this wasn't enough—the skeleton was also bound by shackles.</p><p>Corpse Flowers and Blood Amber had taken root in the crevices of the skeleton, drawing sustenance from the ancient corpse's power. They were eerily beautiful, exuding a tragic allure that was hard to look away from.</p><p>Now that the ancient corpse had turned to bone, the Corpse Flowers had transformed into Blood Amber.</p><p>The seal at the damaged part of the cage was the weakest. Jingyu successfully broke through it and slipped inside, the Corpse Flowers and Blood Amber now within her reach.</p><p>Facing the lifeless skeleton, Jingyu hesitated for a moment before using her Thunder Prayer Beads to create an illusionary clone.</p><p>The clone darted above the skeleton, its sharp claws reaching for a piece of Blood Amber on the skull.</p><p>The moment the clone touched the Blood Amber, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Without any warning, the skeleton erupted with a thick, bloody aura, followed by countless crimson threads.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The clone was instantly pierced by the threads, which wrapped around it and shattered it on the spot.</p><p>The crimson threads, relentless and seemingly sentient, followed the connection between the clone and Jingyu, shooting toward her.</p><p>The transformation of the skeleton happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The crimson threads reached Jingyu in an instant.</p><p>Jingyu was shocked. She had carefully inspected the area multiple times and hadn't detected any anomalies. Without time to think, she activated her Thunder Prayer Beads, her body glowing with lightning.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The crimson threads were finally blocked by the Thunder Prayer Beads and the lightning surrounding Jingyu. However, they clung stubbornly, spreading and forming a blood cocoon that enveloped her.</p><p>Jingyu's body trembled slightly as she looked toward the source of the threads. She noticed that the skeleton had turned into a blood-red bone, but aside from releasing the threads, it made no other movements.</p><p>Seeing this, she felt a sense of unease. This didn't seem like a typical corpse transformation.</p><p>As she resisted the encroaching threads, she focused her gaze on the blood-red bone. Finally, she noticed faint runes flickering within the bone—these runes were the source of the crimson threads.</p><p>"Was this a curse left by the blood-red bone in its dying moments, filled with resentment, to kill anyone who touched it? Or was it a trap set by the ancient cultivator?" Jingyu pondered silently.</p><p>Years ago, she had been lured to the edge of the blood pool by the ancient cultivator. Fortunately, she had seen through his scheme and avoided touching the blood-red bone.</p><p>"There's no sign of manipulation. If this were a trap set by the ancient cultivator, he must be in dire straits, weakened to the point of being unable to control the threads. Otherwise, I'd be in serious trouble. The fact that so many people have entered without any reaction from him speaks volumes," Jingyu thought to herself.</p><p>Reassured that this wasn't a corpse transformation, she felt more at ease.</p><p>Although the crimson threads were strange, they were ultimately masterless. With some effort, she should be able to find a way to break free—it would just take time.</p><p>With this in mind, Jingyu focused all her strength on countering the crimson threads.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side.</p><p>Qingjun, who had been tracking Elder Ye, had also arrived at the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>The scene before her was similar to what Jingyu had seen.</p><p>Dense black chains extended from all directions, converging on a massive cage. However, every pillar of this cage was intact.</p><p>Inside the cage sat a figure.</p><p>When Qingjun saw this person's face, she was momentarily stunned.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the cage, his face directly facing Qingjun.</p><p>His appearance was skeletal, his flesh and blood completely drained, leaving only bone and skin.</p><p>A thin, almost translucent layer of skin clung to his skeleton, stretched taut like brocade, smooth and delicate. All the internal organs, muscles, and blood vessels had vanished, leaving his body emaciated, no different from a skeleton.</p><p>Even his head was the same—deep-set eye sockets with a faint glow within, his teeth intact and visible through the thin layer of skin. His expression was a strange mix of a smile and a grimace.</p><p>What was truly eerie was that his bones were a deep, blood-red, not the usual pale white, and they emitted a jade-like luster. This was a set of jade bones!</p><p>He didn't look like a person but rather a statue crafted from jade and brocade.</p><p>Seeing such a bizarre sight, Qingjun couldn't help but feel a chill run down her spine. She was deeply wary of the jade bones.</p><p>Jingyu had insisted that this person had been alive, causing chaos here all along. But now, the jade bones were completely still, showing no signs of life.</p><p>Had this person transformed himself into this inhuman state to survive until now?</p><p>At that moment, she noticed that Elder Ye, who had arrived before her, was standing in front of the cage, examining the jade bones.</p><p>Elder Ye's pupils and whites had disappeared, leaving only pitch-black eyes that stared fixedly at the jade bones.</p><p>Sensing Qingjun's arrival, Elder Ye turned around. The blackness in his eyes faded, returning to normal as he spoke indifferently, "Are you here to stop me?"</p><p>Qingjun waved her hand, and the Five Directions Pagoda spun lightly before landing gently in her palm.</p><p>"We are enemies, not allies. Why ask the obvious? Unless you swear to withdraw your forces, end the war, and hand over the jade bones and all your knowledge to be jointly controlled by the three realms!"</p><p>Elder Ye sneered without responding. Suddenly, he flicked his sleeve, and a streak of light flew out. Within the light was a crystal-clear command arrow, as if forged from profound ice.</p><p>As soon as the command arrow appeared, it emitted a terrifying chill. The surrounding blood water froze instantly, and a layer of frost spread across the black chains, quickly reaching the cage.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The command arrow shattered, releasing several white shadows that pounced on the cage like starving tigers, spewing cold air at it.</p><p>The ice on the cage grew thicker, creaking under the pressure.</p><p>The seal seemed to have met its nemesis. The runes were frozen by the ice, unable to retaliate, their glow growing dimmer. Elder Ye had clearly planned this for a long time, preparing a treasure specifically to counter the seal.</p><p>Seeing this, Qingjun's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>The cage was a single, unbroken entity, its seal intact. For the moment, it was difficult to determine whether the jade bones were feigning death or if they had truly exhausted their life force, trapped by the seal.</p><p>Wasn't Elder Ye worried that once the seal was broken, the jade bones might escape while they were busy fighting each other?</p>
