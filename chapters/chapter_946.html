<h1>Chapter 938: Conditions</h1><p>“……As a condition, after you help me shake off my pursuers and ensure my safety, I require you to remove the soul imprint within the corpse, allowing this body to fully belong to me.” Bai stated solemnly.</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow at this, a mocking smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Though this man was an ancient monster who had lived for countless years, his cultivation had yet to fully recover.  Removing the soul imprint from the Flying Night Rakshasa corpse would still require considerable effort.</p><p>“Is this the deal you propose, fellow Daoist?  You help me shake off my pursuers, and you dare expose yourself to that person? This matter benefits us both, why the grand pronouncements? You lose nothing; you escape your confinement, fulfill your oath, and gain a powerful body. You'll be free as a bird. On the other hand, I help you break the demonic restrictions, save a wandering soul, and lose a Flying Night Rakshasa corpse that I've spent countless efforts cultivating…”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed at Bai’s condition, saying gravely, “Fellow Daoist, for a single oath, you have persevered in solitude. I admire that. But this condition, I cannot accept!”</p><p>Bai frowned deeply. “Although I haven’t yet refined the remaining primordial spirit in this corpse, fearing the dissipation of my soul, I’ve refined it day and night for decades. My soul and body are now inseparable.  Forcibly separating them would not only severely injure me, but also likely make my recovery hopeless, let alone finding myself again. Besides, even if I return it to you, it’s only a pre-Nascent Soul stage corpse. With your current cultivation, it's insignificant. Why are you so fixated on this trivial gain or loss…?”</p><p>Qin Sang simply shook his head in refusal.</p><p>He respected Bai, but he wouldn't be a sucker.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Bai was negotiating calmly primarily because he feared his strength.</p><p>If he didn't have the corpse, the two-headed snake, and the  “Control Thunder Technique”—a spell capable of threatening Bai's life—would Bai still speak to him so politely?</p><p>He would most likely capture him first and force him to agree to all conditions.</p><p>At best, Bai might show a little mercy and spare his life.</p><p>The initiative now lay with him, entirely gained through his overwhelming strength. If there weren't powerful enemies lurking outside, Bai would've long been his defeated subordinate, and wouldn't dare to make demands.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, offer a more sincere proposal.” Qin Sang said flatly.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's intense gaze, Bai's face was gloomy.</p><p>A Nascent Soul stage enemy was guarding outside, yet this fellow remained unfazed and negotiated terms.</p><p>But upon reflection, possessing such prowess at the Core Formation stage, capable of forcefully subduing him and forcing a surrender, he couldn't be a simple person.</p><p>Bai wanted to refute Qin Sang, but thinking this might be his only chance in life, and no one else could manipulate the demonic fire.</p><p>Even if he regained his body, his lifespan would be limited, certainly not enough to wait for the demonic restrictions to naturally dissipate.</p><p>Another point Bai hadn't explicitly mentioned:</p><p>He’d tried countless times but failed to break the corpse's primordial spirit and the soul imprint Qin Sang left behind.</p><p>Without removing the primordial spirit and the soul imprint, Bai's soul couldn’t perfectly merge with his body, and his cultivation would stagnate, preventing him from advancing to Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Though he was a remnant soul of an ancient immortal, his body decayed, his primordial spirit weakened, his memories faded, and what he had was just a corpse body, limiting him to the necromantic path.</p><p>Cultivation doesn't just recover; it requires gradual cultivation, no different from other cultivators.</p><p>His lifeline was in the other's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang's uncompromising attitude made Bai even more hesitant, suspecting he might have discovered the truth.</p><p>With his lifeline in someone else's hands, Bai felt discouraged and sighed, “I can grant you another condition.  As long as you help me refine the primordial spirit in the corpse, during that time, I will stay by your side as your bodyguard. That should compensate for your loss of the corpse, shouldn’t it? But after I fully recover, you cannot stop me from leaving. If you agree, we shall swear on our demonic oaths.  Having been forced to cultivate the necromantic path, you should know that a demonic oath is a great deterrent to us ghost cultivators. I absolutely dare not violate it.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>He hadn't expected Bai to propose such a condition.</p><p>After leaving the Ghostland, Bai couldn't manipulate ghost mist, greatly reducing his strength, but he was still comparable to a peak Core Formation stage cultivator.</p><p>Having Bai as an attendant would greatly increase his combat power.</p><p>Overlooking all Core Formation stage cultivators would not be an exaggeration.</p><p>Bai, unfortunately, couldn't accept being perpetually under someone's control.  Unless something unexpected happened, his cultivation speed was likely to surpass even Qin Sang's.  Reaching the Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation stages wouldn't be difficult for him.</p><p>Bai's origins were extraordinary, his future potential immeasurable.  Qin Sang should have tried his best to befriend such a person, yet he refused again.</p><p>This utterly enraged Bai.</p><p>Following Qin Sang wasn't entirely unacceptable, actually.  Times change. Bai had been trapped in the Ghostlands, completely unaware of the outside world.  Staying with Qin Sang would allow him to refine his physical form while gradually learning about the world. Once the time was right, he could part ways with Qin Sang and search for his lost memories – a sensible plan.</p><p>He hadn't expected Qin Sang to refuse again.  He suppressed his anger, his face unpleasant, and sneered, "My personally following you isn't enough?  Friend, you're truly insatiable! What exactly do you want?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed a thoughtful expression, his eyes flashing.  He said sternly, "In the Ghostlands, there are countless millions of lost souls, yet only you, friend, retain your spirit intact.  Don't you find that a little strange?  The time you've been trapped must be measured in tens of thousands of years, wouldn't you agree?  No matter how high your cultivation or advanced your techniques were in life, it's impossible for a single wisp of your soul to endure until now. Don't tell me it's solely due to your unwavering willpower, capable of resisting the erosion of time!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly shouted, staring intently into Bai's eyes, demanding an answer.</p><p>Bai's face stiffened, his expression shifting rapidly before he finally chuckled wryly.  "Friend, you already guessed, didn't you? What treasure could possibly keep a soul intact, preserving its essence?"</p><p>"Soul-Nourishing Wood!" Qin Sang's pupils dilated, he exclaimed in disbelief, "You actually have Soul-Nourishing Wood!"</p><p>Soul-Nourishing Wood, one of the ten divine trees, possessed the miraculous ability to nurture the soul and strengthen the primordial spirit.  Only this treasure could have allowed Bai to persevere until now.</p><p>Even so, Bai was left only with a wisp of a soul, barely clinging to existence, highlighting the immense length of his imprisonment.</p><p>Upon seeing Bai's remnant soul, Qin Sang had a vague suspicion, but he remained patient, observing Bai's actions, before finally revealing his hand.</p><p>Bai was destined for greatness.  Given the absence of a mortal feud, Qin Sang, by nature, wouldn't dwell on gains and losses, perhaps even proactively befriending Bai to forge a positive connection.</p><p>Only the Soul-Nourishing Wood could cause Qin Sang to react so intensely, to risk everything! His cultivation had stagnated, and only the fragments of the Abyssal Blood Mulberry in the Wuyag Valley of Xiaohan Domain could help him. He never expected to encounter Soul-Nourishing Wood!</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Some sharp-eyed individuals guessed correctly. Impressive!</p>
