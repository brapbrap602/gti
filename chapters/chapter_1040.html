<h1>Chapter 1332: Contact</h1><p>Radiant light filled the air.</p><p>The interior of the attic was completely empty.</p><p>Floating within the space were numerous orbs of light, each containing a magical treasure.</p><p>There were common flying swords, as well as various unorthodox magical artifacts.</p><p>Among them, some treasures were clearly damaged, remnants of ancient artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, examining the treasures within the light orbs.</p><p>With his discerning eye as a Refiner, he could roughly assess some of the treasures, but the damaged ancient artifacts were beyond his comprehension.  Some, like the Red Silk, might possess unique uses, but with their power diminished, they could only be used a few times before self-destructing.</p><p>He extended his hand, effortlessly summoning an orb.</p><p>After examining it for a moment, Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Unable to use his divine sense, he found it difficult to accurately judge the treasure's rank.</p><p>"Eh? Bring me that iron chain, let me see…"</p><p>Bai suddenly spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over, surprised to find that Bai wasn't pointing at a damaged artifact, but a complete one.</p><p>The complete treasures in the Treasure Pavilion were all crafted by the predecessors who established the trial grounds, not from Bai's era. Why would he be interested in such a thing?</p><p>Curious, Qin Sang summoned the orb containing the iron chain.</p><p>The chain was as thick as a baby's arm, each link identical, unassuming, entirely black, without a hint of luster or runes.</p><p>But since it was in the Treasure Pavilion, there must be a reason, appearances could be deceiving.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do you recognize this item?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Bai replied hesitantly, "It looks familiar. I seem to have seen a similar-looking treasure before, but I can't recall what it is… Perhaps it's a coincidence."</p><p>Then, Bai chuckled, "Which treasure have you taken a liking to?  Should I try to take it out for you?"</p><p>"Forget it, how could the Treasure Pavilion have such an obvious loophole?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "You being able to come in with me is likely related to the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, as you are considered my corpse puppet. If you take a treasure, it will ultimately be traced back to me.  Losing the Soul Cleansing Liquid because of this would be a grave mistake.  There's nothing more to see here, let's go back…"</p><p>Even the best treasures couldn't compare to the Ebony Sword and the Eighteen Demonic Banners; it wasn't worth the risk.</p><p>Qin Sang left the stone peak, found a secluded spot to meditate and recuperate, patiently waiting for Ming Wei.</p><p>…</p><p>Far from the stone peak.</p><p>Inside a hidden cave.</p><p>Su Nü and the others stood at the cave entrance, gazing towards the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>"Several streaks of light have already entered the stone peak.  Before this, there were definitely others even faster. Most of these people are core disciples of various sects who know about the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  With so many competing for it, the struggle will be fierce."</p><p>The charming woman's expression was grave as she turned to the elder with a long beard. "Senior Brother, how much longer should we wait? If we don't prepare soon, I'm worried we won't be able to compete with them.  Especially those from the righteous and demonic paths, they act so domineeringly, they might join forces to eliminate us first."</p><p>"Don't rush, there's still some time before the Soul Cleansing Liquid appears. Wait for another incense stick's worth of time. If Junior Brother Zuo still hasn't arrived, we'll leave without him."</p><p>The elder with the long beard said.</p><p>The others remained silent, quietly watching the stone peak.</p><p>Soon, the time of an incense stick passed.</p><p>Junior Brother Zuo still hadn't arrived.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>The elder said gravely, flying out of the cave first, followed closely by the others.</p><p>They went in the opposite direction, not towards the Treasure Pavilion, but flying for a long time in the other direction, until even the stone peak was out of sight, finally stopping in a deep valley.</p><p>"Before departing, Master instructed us to combine our powers to activate this token after entering the final trial…"</p><p>The elder with the long beard revealed no more secrets, taking out a token from his storage pouch, identical to the one held by the East Pole Alliance Leader outside.</p><p>"Junior Brother Zuo's strength is comparable to mine, so he also has one. However, we know nothing about the token's function or Master's plan. We can only find out by trying…"</p><p>The others exchanged glances, staring at the token, unable to discern anything unusual, and could only follow the order.</p><p>"Set up the formation and cast the spell!"</p><p>The elder with the long beard commanded, and everyone began to work according to their assigned tasks.</p><p>…</p><p>Another secret realm within the trial grounds.</p><p>This place was intensely hot, filled with smoke and dust blocking the sky above, yet incredibly bright and dazzling, a world of magma.</p><p>Magma surged, creating crimson waves, occasionally with fire spirits leaping out, swimming in the magma, surpassing both in size and power the fire spirits encountered by Su Nü.</p><p>Even more terrifying, spatial cracks crisscrossed above the magma, some even slowly moving, making it an extremely dangerous place.</p><p>In such a perilous environment, there was an isolated island, untouched by the magma.</p><p>On the island, a kind-looking old man in grey robes sat in meditation, seemingly undisturbed by the surrounding dangers.</p><p>The old man's aura was concealed.</p><p>Fire spirits swam in the nearby magma, unaware of his presence.</p><p>If anyone else were to witness this scene, they would immediately recognize him. This elder had stood behind the East Pole Alliance Leader in the plaza outside the inner hall and had chosen to enter the Nascent Soul cultivator's trial grounds when the inner hall opened.</p><p>The elder sat motionless on the island, indifferent to the surrounding dangers, seemingly not in any hurry to escape the trial grounds.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the elder suddenly opened his eyes, a glint flashing within them.  He flipped his hand, revealing another identical token.</p><p>At this time, Su Nü and the others were nearing the end of their preparations. A peculiar, large, and complex formation had taken shape, almost filling the entire valley.</p><p>The elder with the long beard took a deep breath and said gravely, "Begin!"</p><p>With that, he tossed the token into the air above the formation.</p><p>The others stood behind him, looking up at the token.</p><p>Su Nü stared at the elder's back, a flicker of urgency in her eyes, but with the strong man and others beside her, each more powerful than herself, she dared not act rashly.</p><p>"Fix!"</p><p>The elder with the long beard shouted, tossing the token and pointing a finger.</p><p>The token froze in mid-air, at the very center of the formation.</p><p>The formation's power activated, countless runes flashing, light flowing.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>If this place weren't so secluded, they would have been discovered.</p><p>Spiritual runes surged into the token, causing it to vibrate violently and begin to glow, becoming increasingly brighter and more dazzling, illuminating the entire valley.</p><p>Everyone stared nervously at the changing token.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>On the magma island.</p><p>The token in the elder's hand faintly glowed, like a flickering candle flame.</p><p>The elder's face lit up with joy as he quickly began to chant incantations.</p><p>Beneath the Immortal Restrictions of the inner hall.</p><p>The token in the East Pole Alliance Leader's palm trembled, awakening him.</p><p>After examining the token for a moment, a slight smile appeared on his lips. "Hiding the main altar, which requires a Nascent Soul cultivator to unlock, within the Core Formation trial, you think that would make it foolproof?"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Wishing everyone a happy new year, peace and joy, and a better life!</p>
