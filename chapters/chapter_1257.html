<h1>Chapter 1249: The Ruthlessness of the Great Dao</h1><p>Leaving aside how Old Demon Ye and his group broke through the gates, Qin Sang reunited with Si Di. Following Si Di, they walked a short distance to the left and encountered another person. This was none other than the demonic path Nascent Soul cultivator who had accompanied Qing Jun and Jiu Gu to guide Qin Sang to Zhitian Peak to refine the Star Origin Power.</p><p>This person was a trusted confidant of Tongyou Demon Lord, deeply trusted by him, and his Dharma name was Cangqing, which didn’t sound like that of a demonic cultivator. It was said that he wielded a pair of crescent hooks with unparalleled skill. Back when Qin Sang went to Zhitian Peak, Cangqing had not made things difficult for him, so Qin Sang had a favorable impression of him.</p><p>As it turned out, although Qing Jun and the others had been scattered by the Blood Souls, they were not completely defenseless. To avoid anyone being isolated and encountering danger, they had split into small groups, moving together as much as possible. Si Di and Cangqing, being closest to each other, had fled in the same direction. The Blood Souls were too troublesome, so to completely shake them off, they had split up again. Si Di had been on his way to reunite with Cangqing when he encountered Qin Sang halfway.</p><p>The conflicts between the righteous and demonic factions in the Cold Domain had been ongoing, but over the years, they had united against the Sin Abyss, greatly reducing their internal conflicts. They were now much more united than before, a silver lining in the midst of chaos.</p><p>The three of them quickened their pace to reunite with the others.</p><p>“I was delayed by an unexpected incident and only realized everyone had already set out after seeing the message left at the mountain peak. I assume the other fellow Daoists have mostly arrived by now…” Qin Sang asked as they walked.</p><p>Cangqing shook his head. “Dongyang Bo has yet to arrive. Tongyou Daoist originally wanted to wait for him a bit longer, but after noticing the strange phenomenon, he had no choice but to set out first.”</p><p>“Dongyang Bo?” Qin Sang feigned surprise. “He still hasn’t joined us?”</p><p>At the same time, he thought to himself. Dongyang Bo had only suffered a temporary setback; it was unlikely he was so afraid that he wouldn’t dare show his face. No matter how arrogant Qin Sang was, he wouldn’t dare act against Dongyang Bo in front of Qing Jun and Tongyou Demon Lord. Although Dongyang Bo’s scheming against Gong Liangyu was despicable, and Qin Sang had witnessed it, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was now in Qin Sang’s hands. If it came to a dispute, it would be hard to explain. Unless Qin Sang could resist the temptation of a Nascent Soul-level puppet and publicly return it to the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, the best choice was to remain silent.</p><p>When Dongyang Bo fled, he split into eight illusory figures, which even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly couldn’t see through. It was unclear what secret technique or treasure he had used. Could it be that the cost was so great that he needed to find a place to recuperate, neglecting the current urgent matter?</p><p>This was good news. Qin Sang had been troubled by Dongyang Bo’s divine ability. Now it seemed that the cost was so high that Dongyang Bo couldn’t use it freely.</p><p>Si Di snorted. “Even before we were scattered by the Blood Souls, that old ghost was nowhere to be seen. Although the outside is full of forbidden areas, with Dongyang Bo’s cultivation, he shouldn’t have been delayed this long. Unless he forgot the importance of the task, or knew something and deliberately entered a forbidden area, accidentally getting trapped there.”</p><p>Cangqing, standing nearby, smiled. “This is human nature. Who among us doesn’t have such thoughts? Even if there’s a minor mishap, it shouldn’t trap him for long. He might have already arrived by now.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in agreement, but his mind was racing with thoughts.</p><p>Along the way, Blood Souls roamed, but they were all slain by the group. After walking for an unknown distance, they finally arrived at the meeting point.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Mingyue has arrived!”</p><p>Qin Sang, following behind Cangqing and Si Di, had just appeared when he heard Tongyou Demon Lord’s voice, filled with pleasant surprise. The others also looked delighted.</p><p>He cupped his hands in greeting and scanned the area, noticing that his senior sister, Chongyi, Xiang Qing, and others were all present, with only Dongyang Bo missing. He roughly understood why they were so happy to see him.</p><p>“If it weren’t for my mastery of escape techniques, I would have almost died at the hands of Old Demon Ye. I must repay him in kind… Fortunately, I’m not late,” Qin Sang said casually.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was overjoyed, repeatedly saying it wasn’t late at all.</p><p>Qin Sang greeted everyone one by one and walked over to Qing Jun, noticing her inquiring gaze. Before entering, he had mentioned the matter of Fat Chicken searching for its relatives to Qing Jun.</p><p>“I haven’t found them yet. If the Thunder-Swallowing Hawk Demon King is still alive, he’s most likely trapped somewhere in the basin. After this matter is settled, I’ll need to take Fat Chicken around to search…” Qin Sang replied via voice transmission. He then briefly mentioned his earlier encounter and battle with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “I didn’t expect to clash with him here either. It’s a pity we’ve lost a helper. I wonder if this will affect our plans against the Sin Abyss.”</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Qin Sang with surprise, her gaze lingering on him for a while, making him slightly uncomfortable. “I knew your abilities were extraordinary, but I didn’t expect you to single-handedly force Dongyang Bo to retreat and nearly capture him. We know very little about Old Demon Ye’s schemes. Despite years of investigation, we’ve gained no concrete information. We’re doing our best and leaving the rest to fate. If not for Tongyou’s restraint, many fellow Daoists would have scattered in search of the Blood Mulberry. If we fail because of this, it’s simply destiny. It’s not your fault…”</p><p>Qing Jun comforted him.</p><p>She then added, “I’ve focused on the path of puppetry and have collected many secret techniques related to puppets. I have some understanding of Nascent Soul Talisman Puppets. Such puppets are fierce and cannot be tamed. Dongyang Bo’s ruthless killing of Gong Liangyu to seize the puppet might not have been for himself. He places great importance on Shaohua Mountain, yet none of his disciples have reached the Nascent Soul stage. He likely intended to leave the puppet to Shaohua Mountain to bolster its strength. Even if no disciple reaches the Nascent Soul stage in the future, the mountain would still have a Nascent Soul puppet to protect it.”</p><p>Qing Jun, with her sharp mind, pieced together the clues and quickly deduced Dongyang Bo’s plans.</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned. “Senior sister, what do you mean?”</p><p>“I’ve always found Dongyang Bo peculiar. Shortly after leaving the Purple Micro Palace, he suddenly broke through to the mid-stage, and during that time, his cultivation surged rapidly, allowing him to forcefully overcome the Heavenly Tribulation. But since then, his cultivation has nearly stagnated, with only his life-bound treasure improving rapidly. I thought he had misplaced his priorities, focusing most of his energy on refining his treasure and neglecting his cultivation. Now it seems there’s another reason. His next Heavenly Tribulation might be…”</p><p>Qing Jun spoke with deep meaning.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Qing Jun exclaimed, “Below the Nascent Soul stage, whether mortal or cultivator, all are bound by lifespan. After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, there are the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulations, and now there’s the added difficulty of the Dao path being severed. These calamities press upon us relentlessly—advance or perish! The Great Dao is ruthless. You are already on this path. Do you not understand?”</p><p>The Great Dao is ruthless!</p><p>The Great Dao is ruthless!</p><p>These words struck Qin Sang like a tolling bell, shaking him to his core.</p><p>If what Qing Jun said was true, Dongyang Bo had used a secret technique to forcefully break through, causing his cultivation to stagnate. Knowing he couldn’t survive the next Heavenly Tribulation, he had begun planning for the future.</p><p>In a little over a hundred years, his enemies would perish under the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Compared to the Heavenly Tribulation, what did a mere grudge matter?</p><p>Ever since Dongyang Bo’s schemes forced him to flee to the Canglang Sea, Qin Sang had kept his feelings hidden, but the matter weighed heavily on his heart, unresolved.</p><p>Even after reaching the Nascent Soul stage, he had meticulously hidden his identity, consumed by thoughts of revenge.</p><p>Revenge was acceptable, but it should not cloud his judgment or hinder his path!</p><p>The Great Dao is ruthless. Compared to the Heavenly Tribulation, what did a mere grudge amount to?</p>
