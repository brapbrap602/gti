<h1>Chapter 684: Searching for the Flood Dragon</h1><p>Qin Sang exited the cave and found all five people gathered in the outer hall, discussing something.</p><p>“One person must remain outside on watch at all times, keeping an eye on the movements of the sea beasts in the trench.  The rest of you should stay inside unless necessary. You have a good eye for location; this spot is well-chosen. Even if there's turmoil in the trench, we can detect it early and escape…”</p><p>Qin Sang made detailed arrangements.  Unnoticed, he also stationed one of his Skyfiend Night Stalkers outside as a sentry.</p><p>The elderly couple exchanged glances and said hesitantly, “Reporting to Daoist Master, we’ve just discussed the matter and believe last night’s phenomenon was an anomaly.  Even if a legendary Sea Beast Royal truly exists, it would only reside in the depths of the trench and not venture to such a remote location.  We once hunted a peak Spirit Severing Stage fish-demon nearby, and nothing happened afterward.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone grew serious. “Caution is the parent of safety.  I needn’t teach you this. I paid a high price to hire you to find Flood Dragons, not to lose your lives over a single Flood Dragon’s essence core. Follow my instructions and focus on the task at hand. Cultivate within the cave for a month.  If nothing occurs, then we’ll resume our search.”</p><p>The elderly couple straightened up, responding in unison, “Understood.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Just as he was about to turn back, he suddenly remembered something and asked, "By the way, do any of you possess demon beast inner cores?"</p><p>These five had hunted sea beasts for decades and possessed decent strength; it wouldn't be unusual for them to have acquired inner cores.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to test the Fat Silkworm using other inner cores to see if it was solely interested in poisonous cores or if other types would suffice.</p><p>“Demon beast inner cores?”</p><p>The five exchanged glances. The grey-robed man’s eyes flickered with hesitation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood their concern.  He said coldly, “If you take demon beast inner cores back, you'll just find someone to refine them into Fiend Transformation Pills, which would cost a fortune in spirit stones to hire a skilled alchemist. I can exchange them directly for top-grade magical artifacts or Fiend Transformation Pills.  I don’t currently have any pills, but I can promise you this: if you have the inner core I need, I'll have the Guild exchange it for a high-quality Fiend Transformation Pill upon our return.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, revealing two magical artifacts in his palm.</p><p>One was a bone sword, yet it had the texture of metal and emitted a faint, cold light.  The other was a bone spear with a slender tip, clearly razor-sharp.</p><p>These were artifacts he crafted while studying refining techniques, each possessing formidable power, created to test his theories.  In comparison, the ones he submitted to the Qiongyu Guild were rather ordinary.</p><p>However, like the gap between Foundation Establishment and Core Formation cultivators, there was an insurmountable chasm between magical artifacts and true treasures. Qin Sang was confident that few refiners surpassed his skill with artifacts, yet he still dared not attempt to forge treasures.</p><p>The five were discerning individuals. Upon seeing these weapons, their faces lit up with fascination.  Inner cores were precious, but such artifacts were even rarer.  Obtaining one would boost their strength by 30%, how could they not be tempted?</p><p>“We’ve long heard that the Daoist Master’s refining skills are among the best on Kyorin Island; today, we’ve finally witnessed it…” The old man exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>The grey-robed man stared intently at the bone sword, then stepped forward and retrieved a jade bottle from his storage pouch. "Senior, please take a look at this inner core. Would it be sufficient for the bone sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the bottle and saw a water-blue inner core within, brimming with potent water elemental energy, a common type in the Sea of Demons.</p><p>“Wait a moment…”</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the cave and presented the core to the Fat Silkworm. He found it showed no interest, clinging only to the Azure Flood Dragon's inner core.</p><p>“As expected, its talent is related to poison; only poisonous cores will do.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the core to the grey-robed man, explaining he needed only poisonous cores.  The man’s face fell with disappointment, yet he dared not complain, silently putting the core away. None of the others possessed poisonous cores, so Qin Sang had to put the matter aside for the time being.</p><p>Afterward, everyone began cultivating on the island.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang closely observed the Fat Silkworm's changes. A full month passed, and the inner core had only shrunk slightly, while the Fat Silkworm’s cultivation had improved significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated it would take at least several years for the silkworm to absorb the core fully, after which it should reach the middle stage of its second transformation.  This was far faster than his own cultivation speed back then.</p><p>Fortunately, the trench remained calm throughout the month, showing no signs of disturbance.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang divided them into three groups to search the trench for Flood Dragons. He paired with the grey-robed man in the center, while the elderly couple and the Wang sisters formed the flanks, maintaining a distance that allowed for quick support as they scoured the trench.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman’s requirements were extremely stringent. Even with the elderly couple's years of experience in the area, finding a suitable Flood Dragon essence core was no easy feat.</p><p>After over three months of searching, they finally hunted a Crimson Flood Dragon!</p><p>They encountered dangers along the way, but Qin Sang resolved them all. The elderly couple and the others grew increasingly convinced of his abilities and realized he wasn't a vicious fiend.  Their worries eased, and they dedicated themselves to assisting him.</p><p>Of course, their increasingly full storage pouches also played a role.</p><p>During their search, whenever they encountered huntable sea beasts, Qin Sang would take action, claiming only the most valuable parts and leaving the rest for the others to divide.  Qin Sang took the meat, and they had the broth.</p><p>…</p><p>Across the boundless sea, two figures flew silently.  They only landed to rest briefly when encountering reefs or islands before continuing their journey.  Maintaining a short distance between them, they vigilantly scanned their surroundings.  They were Qin Sang and the grey-robed man.</p><p>A month had passed since they hunted the Crimson Flood Dragon, and they were once again on their lengthy quest for Flood Dragons.</p><p>As they flew across the sea, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a message talisman flying towards them.  The grey-robed man intercepted it, and they immediately halted.</p><p>After reading the talisman, the grey-robed man quickly flew over.  “Senior, the Wang sisters just sent word that they discovered signs of Flood Dragon activity on an island. The tracks are fresh, and it seems the group is quite large.”</p><p>“Let’s go!  Take a look!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s spirits lifted. Aimlessly searching for Flood Dragons was incredibly tedious, and even the magnificent scenery of the Sea of Demons had become commonplace.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang and the grey-robed man landed on the island. The Wang sisters, who had been waiting, immediately approached them.</p><p>“Senior, please look.  These are the Flood Dragon tracks.  They appear to be only a few days old.  It seems the group is migrating. We found similar tracks on several nearby islands as well,” the Wang sisters reported.</p>
