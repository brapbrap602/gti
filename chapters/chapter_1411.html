<h1>Chapter 1403 Waiting</h1><p>"What do you seek?"</p><p>The Hunmo Elder withdrew his gaze, settling it on Chijie Zhenren.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren blinked, realizing the Hunmo Elder referred to the treasures within Jinghai Sect.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's eyes were cloudy, peaceful.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, a chill ran down Chijie Zhenren's spine. He clenched his fist, feeling the cool touch of his Nine-戒 ring, and said cautiously, "My greatest wish is to fulfill my master's last wish, obtain the complete legacy of Jinghai Sect, and revive Buddhism. Also, due to my cultivation method, I have never had a truly satisfactory treasure. I hope to find one or two protective Buddhist artifacts…"</p><p>The implication was clear.</p><p>Aside from these two requests, everything else could be offered to the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>After speaking, Chijie Zhenren bowed slightly.</p><p>He had made this decision the moment he decided to use the Hunmo Order.</p><p>Inviting other cultivators had less stringent conditions, but they were unlikely to be a match for Mu Guzhu and his associates. Success wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>It was better to directly enlist the Hunmo Elder, ensuring success.</p><p>Even if he received fewer treasures, it was better than coming away empty-handed.</p><p>As long as he remained honest and respectful, and with his master's legacy as a testament, the Hunmo Elder wouldn't turn on him over a few items.</p><p>After a moment, feeling the Hunmo Elder's gaze shift away, Chijie Zhenren felt a little relieved. Then he heard the Hunmo Elder ask, "How many are they? What are their backgrounds?"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren was overjoyed, understanding the Hunmo Elder had agreed. He quickly replied, "One is Qi Huanyu, who cultivates on Guilings Island, south of the Kongling Sea. I have a grudge against him. The other is a female cultivator surnamed Wang, his mistress, who only recently broke through to the Yuan Ying stage and is inconsequential. The third is a helper they brought in from outside, a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator with unique abilities, skilled in insect control. According to my information, she might be the current valley master of Baihua Valley from the Xuan Yue Realm."</p><p>"Only three?"</p><p>The Hunmo Elder was unimpressed.  "Two early Yuan Ying, one mid-Yuan Ying. They're in the open, you're in the shadows. Finding a helper, plus your knowledge of Jinghai Sect, making some subtle moves shouldn't be difficult, right?"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren replied affirmatively, respectfully saying, "If it were only the three of them, I wouldn't dare disturb your seclusion. However, they're having trouble breaking the formation and refuse to give up. They found another mid-Yuan Ying helper from somewhere. This person's background is mysterious, quite capable, and seems to be making progress shortly after arriving."</p><p>"Oh? Two mid-Yuan Ying…"</p><p>The Hunmo Elder became interested.</p><p>After inquiring about Qin Sang's appearance in detail, the Hunmo Elder pondered for a moment, "Not those troublesome old fellows! Take me there."</p><p>Hunmo Island was renowned in the Boundless Sea, but the Hunmo Elder was always a loner, more like a hermit cultivator, without even any attached Yuan Ying cultivators under him.</p><p>However, based on Hunmo Island's status alone, various forces in the Boundless Sea would give him face. If the Hunmo Elder intended to find help, it wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Seeing that he seemed prepared to go alone, Chijie Zhenren hesitated slightly but didn't ask further, assuming the Hunmo Elder had enough confidence to deal with two mid-Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Soon, the two entered the Kongling Sea.</p><p>They concealed their aura, flying close to the surface, quietly approaching Chijie Zhenren's previous hiding spot.</p><p>Chijie Zhenren took out a yellow orb to spy.</p><p>At the edge of the formation, a sacrificial altar suspended in the water was about 70-80% complete, nearing its final form.</p><p>"How fast!"</p><p>Chijie Zhenren gasped.</p><p>These people were probably about to make their move; calling for help now would likely be too late.</p><p>The altar was square, narrower at the top and wider at the base.</p><p>The entire altar was inscribed with countless strange symbols, which, upon closer examination, appeared to be various types of spirit insects, some of which were unknown to both Chijie Zhenren and the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>The image in the orb was blurry.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder glanced at it, lost interest, and dashed forward, approaching the formation.</p><p>Not far from the formation, the Hunmo Elder suddenly let out a soft gasp and stopped.</p><p>A glint of light flashed in his cloudy eyes.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder ordered Chijie to hand over the orb.  His gaze swept across Qin Sang and the others, and he nodded with a wry smile, "Interesting."</p><p>After a pause, the Hunmo Elder lightly tapped his black bamboo staff, "They must have advanced detection techniques. If I weren't always vigilant, with my divine sense far surpassing yours, I might have already been exposed."</p><p>Chijie Zhenren was startled, relieved by his own caution. "What do we do now?"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The Hunmo Elder said calmly, "Do they really think it's so easy to break into Jinghai Sect? Let them open the formation for us, why not? And let's see what they're capable of."</p><p>Chijie Zhenren was secretly amazed.</p><p>He and his master cultivated the Jinghai Sect's methods, yet their knowledge of the sect was limited.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder seemed to possess extensive knowledge of Jinghai Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Guzhu were finishing the final part of the sacrificial altar.</p><p>Amidst their work…</p><p>Qin Sang felt the Sky Eye Butterfly in her dantian flutter its wings before settling down again.  She checked for any abnormalities and found none, then calmed herself.</p><p>Until the secrets of Hundred Flowers Valley are uncovered, the Sky Eye Butterfly cannot be revealed.</p><p>Third day, before dawn.</p><p>The east of the Empty Spirit Sea remained dark.</p><p>The moon still hung high, casting its silvery light on the sea.</p><p>The altar was finally complete!</p><p>With the last rune etched, the altar glowed with a green light that quickly coursed through it, transforming its entire essence. It became a unified whole, resembling a bronze platform.</p><p>On the altar's surface,</p><p>the insect patterns were incredibly lifelike, giving the impression they could revive and crawl off at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu exchanged smiles and sat cross-legged to meditate and recover their energy.</p><p>An hour later,</p><p>both awoke. After discussion, they decided to immediately set up the insect formation, lest unforeseen complications arise.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>These past few days, she had fed it a Fire Melting Pill, and Valley Master Mu had generously provided several vials of elixirs beneficial to spirit insect cultivation, maximizing the centipede's potential.</p><p>Valley Master Mu also summoned his spirit insects.</p><p>One was his main spirit insect, a four-stage early-phase Tidal Crab.</p><p>The other was a three-stage late-phase Black Magic Ant.</p><p>The Tidal Crab, crab-like in shape, was about the size of Valley Master Mu’s palm. Its body was a sea-blue color, and one could even see the blue blood flowing within.  A long, sword-like tail extended from its rear, vibrating subtly with a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about the Tidal Crab, but every four-stage spirit insect possessed extraordinary abilities.</p><p>As for the Black Magic Ant, it looked like an ordinary black ant, but it had a pair of miniature bat-like wings.  Its innate ability was said to have some effect against demonic cultivators.</p><p>With the three spirit insects assembled,</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the Fire Jade Centipede, stroked its back, and gently placed it on the altar.</p><p>Valley Master Mu likewise placed his insects on the altar, then positioned himself in the center of the three insects, sat cross-legged, nodded to Qin Sang, and closed his eyes.</p>
