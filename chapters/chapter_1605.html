<h1>Chapter 1596: The Green-haired Rat Demon</h1><p>Chapter 1596: The Green-haired Rat Demon</p><p>The battle's aftermath ripped through the dark clouds above.</p><p>Sparse starlight pierced the gloom, illuminating the thousand-zhang crocodile.</p><p>In a short time, this monstrous beast solidified from a phantom into near-tangible form. Its black scales, tightly arranged, reflected an eerie sheen.</p><p>As the thousand-zhang crocodile shifted, its scales compressed rhythmically, like the movements of a living creature.</p><p>The starlight only reached half of the crocodile's body; the other half remained shrouded in shadow, its outline vaguely visible, exuding an unknown terror that chilled the soul.</p><p>Its massive maw opened to its fullest extent, aimed at Qin Sang, seeming to contain a black hole.  An incredibly powerful suction force created a clearly visible vortex in the air.</p><p>A gale raged overhead.</p><p>The vortex expanded relentlessly, its reach growing until it encompassed the lower Double Tiger Mountain.  A thunderous roar echoed from the mountain's left peak.</p><p>The massive, tiger-head-shaped rock at the summit shattered, its fragments instantly sucked into the vortex, torn to pieces in a fraction of a second, vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>The suction vortex was immense, seemingly poised to devour the entire void.</p><p>Concentric ripples, like water waves, formed at its edge, spreading outwards, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang, who flitted along the wave's crest.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. He had underestimated that crocodile bone; the vortex contained more than just suction—a strange, binding force.</p><p>If caught in the vortex or swallowed by the thousand-zhang crocodile, escaping would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Even daring to rob during the top-tier magical artifact auction! They really have some tricks up their sleeves!</p><p>A fire lotus phantom appeared on his forehead.  Nine Netherworld Magma flowed out like liquid, encountering the suction vortex and forming a black fire stream that was sucked into the crocodile's belly without resistance.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The thousand-zhang crocodile's belly swelled suddenly, its movements becoming frenzied.</p><p>It seemed to be in agonizing pain, its massive body rolling wildly, smashing mountain peaks one after another, sending rocks flying and wreaking havoc on the surrounding area.</p><p>As it rolled, its solid form blurred. The suction vortex stopped expanding, its edges collapsing and retracting inwards, losing its ability to pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>Ignoring the crocodile, Qin Sang flickered and merged into the sword array.</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation was filled with a murderous aura.  Dark sword threads, ubiquitous and thin as strings, played a deathly melody.</p><p>Qin Sang employed some unknown sword technique; the sword array trembled, its threads suddenly becoming finer, yet more powerful than before, slicing towards the misty clump at the array's center.</p><p>…</p><p>After falling into the sword array, the one-horned man was both shocked and enraged.</p><p>He still didn't understand what went wrong.</p><p>The one-horned man, remaining calm in the face of danger, lit the tip of his frontal horn, shooting a gray beam.  Its speed was no less than that of a sword beam; it pierced the array like lightning.</p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p>The sword threads swayed, not only unpierced by the gray beam, but dozens of them quickly counterattacked, instantly cutting the beam into fragments, its power gone.</p><p>Watching the beam dissipate, the one-horned man gasped.</p><p>This was his carefully honed supernatural ability; many opponents had been severely injured or killed by it.  Yet before this sword array, it was so weak.</p><p>Although his sneak attack failed, the one-horned man wasn't overly panicked.</p><p>His companions would arrive soon.</p><p>A few breaths’ time would bring reinforcement.</p><p>As a heavenly spirit beast, he possessed a robust body and great supernatural powers. He confidently believed that even if not a match for a human cultivator, he could withstand a few attacks.</p><p>However, witnessing the sword array's annihilation of his beam filled the one-horned man with unease.</p><p>His extensive experience led him to make the safest choice.  His throat rolled, uttering a low moan, and he expelled a cloud of grayish-white mist from his mouth, pouring out through the gaps in his helmet.</p><p>The grayish-white mist formed a dense fog within the sword array, obscuring the one-horned man's form, which flickered within the mist, making it difficult for his opponent to track his position.</p><p>Unfortunately, this tactic could not deceive the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the one-horned man's every movement, as if watching a monkey show.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Sword threads slashed towards the Horned One's true form.</p><p>The Horned One continued to dodge, horrified to find his enemy completely unaffected.  The power of the sword array's sudden eruption terrified him; his eyes wide with shock, he flickered, his body glowing with a bright gray light.</p><p>Within the intense gray light, the Horned One's body twisted grotesquely, losing its human form and revealing its true self – a crocodile with a single horn.</p><p>Simultaneously, a streak of green light shot down from the sky, breaking through the air with tremendous force and crashing into the sword array.</p><p>The green light dissipated, revealing a figure in green armor.</p><p>The Green-armored man's face was grim. He raised his hands, fingers slightly curved, and intense green light shot from his fingertips, transforming into two enormous green claws.</p><p>The claws were long and thin, unlike human hands, resembling more a pair of rat claws.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The claws plunged fiercely into the sword array.  Wherever the green light touched, the sword threads showed signs of stagnation, bound by an unknown force, transforming from intangible to solid before being grasped by the claws.  With an attack from both inside and outside, the array was forcibly ripped open!</p><p>Gray mist seeped out.</p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p>The Horned One, now revealed within the mist, was battered and bloody, his scales broken and covered in wounds from the sword threads.  He looked utterly wretched.</p><p>Seeing the Green-armored man, the Horned One was overjoyed, relieved, and rushed upward.</p><p>At that moment, the Green-armored man's pupils constricted sharply, reflecting a point of red light.  Shock registered on his stern face.  He blurted out, "Watch out!"</p><p>The Horned One was bewildered.</p><p>Then, his vision was filled with crimson firelight.</p><p>Before he could react, he felt a sudden tightening around his neck.  Completely unprepared, he was grabbed by a green hand, and flung violently towards the red glow!</p><p>"I've been waiting for you!"</p><p>Within the sword array, Qin Sang, supporting the Sun God Tree with one hand, slightly tilted his head, a cold smile on his lips. He'd feigned falling into a trap; his real target had always been the Green-armored man, whose aura was the most subtle of the three.</p><p>Eliminating this man would make dealing with the other two trivial.</p><p>Three branches of the Sun God Tree were bare. Three divine birds had been hidden within the sword array by Qin Sang, held back until this moment to strike!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The dark space created by the sword array was instantly illuminated by the blinding firelight.</p><p>From afar, a massive fireball appeared, hanging high in the sky like a red sun, even more dazzling than the white light emanating from the crocodile bones.</p><p>Two non-human roars echoed from within the fireball.</p><p>One was sharp and filled with furious rage.</p><p>The other was filled with pain and terror.</p><p>A green and a gray light flashed simultaneously with the eruption of the red fire.</p><p>The green light was above, the gray below.</p><p>Even from a distance, it was clear that the gray light contained a horned crocodile.  Smaller than the earlier colossal crocodile, it was nonetheless a rare and powerful demon beast.</p><p>At the same time, a stream of red fire shot skyward, wildly powerful.</p><p>The ferocious demon beast, facing this red light, reacted as if it had seen the most terrifying thing in the world, its eyes filled with terror and disbelief.</p><p>A deafening roar followed.</p><p>A crimson flower of flame bloomed in the air, the full power of the Southern Ming Li Fire erupting.  Flames blazed, creating an endless sea of fire in the high altitude.</p><p>The sky was consumed by fire; the green and gray lights were swallowed by the flames.</p><p>The cries of pain ceased abruptly.</p><p>After the Sun God Birds’ attack, the flames, having reached their peak, gradually dissipated and the firelight dimmed.</p><p>A black shadow fell from the sky – the charred remains of the crocodile – crashing to the ground.</p><p>In the end, the Horned One was used as a shield by his sworn brother and perished instantly!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light burst from the sea of fire, revealing a demonic figure – a green-haired rat demon.</p><p>The green-haired rat demon was barely half a person's height, its fur smooth, its appearance not much different from an ordinary rat.  Even in its true form, it still wore its armor, though now it was tattered and scorched. Its eyes, however, were sharp, fixed intently on the area below the sea of fire, radiating killing intent!</p><p>"They were all demon kings?"</p><p>Qin Sang's figure emerged from beneath the sea of fire, his expression grave.</p><p>Having discovered the Horned One was a crocodile demon, Qin Sang had assumed it was the Green-armored man's spirit beast, not associating it with the demon race.</p><p>After all, this was the heart of the Central Plains, where human power was strongest.  For demons to roam here, daring to ambush cultivators, seemed far too audacious.</p><p>He hadn’t expected them all to be demon beasts!</p><p>They must have relied on that armor to conceal their identities.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't noticed their true nature until their disguise was broken.</p><p>Qin Sang was dissatisfied despite instantly killing the Unicorn Man.  He had used the Unicorn Man's attack against him, setting a trap and deploying the Sun God Tree.  Unexpectedly, the Green-furred Rat Demon showed ruthless efficiency, sacrificing a comrade to shield itself.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon seemed uninjured.  Demon Kings possess formidable bodies; such wounds would barely affect them.</p><p>“You shall die!”</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon's voice was shrill, cold as ice.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He frantically activated his escape technique, his Phoenix wings beating rapidly.  The Jin Chen Sword, suspended above him, buzzed, aimed at his back.  A faint green glow appeared behind him.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon, seemingly teleporting, appeared silently behind Qin Sang, its claws aimed at his heart.  Even with Qin Sang's formidable physique, comparable to a Demon King, he would have been killed.</p><p>A thunderclap sounded.</p><p>Qin Sang had escaped hundreds of meters.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon, momentarily stunned, finally understood Qin Sang had been concealing his true escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang was also shocked. He hadn't sensed the Green-furred Rat Demon's approach until the moment it was about to strike. Only his powerful spiritual sense had alerted him in time.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Sword light erupted.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon wildly slashed with its claws, its nails akin to magical weapons, leaving trails of icy light to deflect the sword.</p><p>At that moment, the Grey-armored Man finally arrived, too late.</p><p>The battle had changed too rapidly.  The Grey-armored Man, wishing he had more legs, could only watch his comrade fall, letting out a mournful roar. He transformed into a crocodile demon, albeit hornless.</p><p>This crocodile demon lacked scales; its soft skin bore wave-like patterns.  The patterns came alive, rippling like water, producing a 'whooshing' sound around Qin Sang.</p><p>A vast expanse of water appeared beneath Qin Sang, massive waves surging upward.</p><p>But just as the water formed, a purple light shot from the nearby forest.  Inside the light was a drill-shaped crystal, its tip piercing toward the crocodile demon's belly.</p><p>The crocodile demon, unprepared for another attacker, desperately rolled away, narrowly avoiding the crystal, but interrupting its spell.</p><p>"Who! Show yourself!"</p><p>The enraged crocodile demon slammed its tail into the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed unsurprised.  He activated the Sun God Tree, its flames swirling, three Sun God Birds glowing, preparing to take flight.</p><p>Simultaneously, several figures appeared in the distant sky, drawn by the battle.</p><p>Someone cried out, "Great demons here!"  Their voice held a hint of ecstatic excitement.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon's expression shifted, it glanced at Qin Sang, vanished again, reappearing beside the crocodile demon, attempting to escape with it.</p><p>But the purple crystal returned, exploding with strange purple lightning, shattering the green light and overwhelming the crocodile demon.</p><p>The hidden attacker remained unseen.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Sun God Birds swiftly closed in.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to summon more birds.</p><p>The Green-furred Rat Demon, having experienced the Sun God Tree's power, its eyelids twitching, decided to abandon its companion and fled.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Another fiery flower bloomed in the void.</p><p>The crocodile demon, still battling the purple lightning, suffered a critical blow!</p><p>Qin Sang had adjusted his aim.  The crocodile demon, though critically injured but not killed, attempted to flee, only to be struck with a sudden, searing mental pain.  It screamed and fell.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword, appearing from nowhere, emitted strange light, circling the crocodile demon's neck. Its tough skin, ravaged by the Sun God Birds, offered little defense; its massive head rolled away.</p><p>As its head rolled, a translucent orb flew from its body – its demon core and spirit, a miniature, terrified crocodile inside.</p><p>The demon core shot away as a blue light.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword flickered, creating a small sword array, perfectly capturing the demon core.</p><p>The sword light enveloped the corpse and the core.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing in the air, watched the Green-furred Rat Demon flee, choosing not to pursue. His gaze shifted coldly to the approaching figures.</p><p>They stopped, their expressions varied, surprised by the swift victory. One hesitated, then turned to follow the Green-furred Rat Demon.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Shuang Hu Mountain, gathering the crocodile remains and the other corpse.</p><p>"Why not kill the rat demon?" Qin Sang asked, seemingly speaking to someone unseen.</p><p>"Heh, is a late-stage transformed demon so easy to kill?"  A sinister chuckle echoed from the shadows.  "Besides, I wouldn't want to be mistaken for your accomplice and hunted by Lu Ye!"</p>
