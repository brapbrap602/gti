<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang stood before the stone stele, gazing at it for a long time, then raised his head to look at the sky.</p><p>He lifted his arm, as if to touch the immortals in the heavens.</p><p>Thinking back to the past, he had been ignorant of the immensity of heaven and earth, and had made bold proclamations. He never imagined he would truly be able to walk step by step to this day, and although he had not reached the pinnacle of this realm, he was not far from it.</p><p>"Now, I have taken another step forward..."</p><p>Qin Sang whispered, his hand making a grasping motion, seizing a piece of cloud, revealing the clear, bright sky.</p><p>After a pause, he murmured, "I am about to embark on a long journey. The path ahead is unpredictable. I do not know if what lies before me is an abyss, or a stepping stone to help me ascend another level, to approach the unattainable Immortal Realm."</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a wine gourd and offered a toast to the Empress.</p><p>A gentle shake, and the wine gourd made a sloshing sound.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had visited the graves of Wu Chuanzong, Bai Jianglan, and others to pay his respects. The wine in the gourd was almost empty.</p><p>He drained the wine in one gulp.</p><p>Qin Sang set up an even more robust restriction, took a deep look at the stone stele, then turned and walked down Sacred Mountain, gradually receding into the distance.</p><p>……</p><p>Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea.</p><p>After Jing Yu took over, she did not make many changes here.</p><p>Apart from her own cave dwelling, other places remained almost as they were, including Yun Youzi's practice of sheltering the spirits of plants and trees, which she also continued.</p><p>Inside the main hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was giving instructions.</p><p>The white cat sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, listening intently.</p><p>The old macaque scratched its ears and cheeks.</p><p>The white crane appeared respectful, but its eyes darted around, with Yue'er nestled beside it.</p><p>They had cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, and with Jing Yu's guidance, their transformations were very obvious, and their cultivation levels had also improved.</p><p>The willow demon offered spiritual tea.</p><p>Qin Sang took it, took a sip, and, sensing something, rose and looked towards the entrance where Jing Yu was walking in.</p><p>"I hope I didn't disturb your secluded cultivation, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Jing Yu shook her head slightly, a faint smile on her lips. "I didn't expect Fellow Daoist Qin to return from the North Sea so soon. Seeing your high spirits, your gains must have been considerable?"</p><p>"Indeed, they were considerable!"</p><p>Qin Sang did not feign modesty. He waved his hand to dismiss the demons, his expression turning serious, and told Jing Yu of his decision.</p><p>"Relocate the sect?"</p><p>Jing Yu was startled.</p><p>An even greater shock followed. When she heard that Qin Sang had decided to travel to the Central Province, Jing Yu exclaimed.</p><p>"Your cultivation has not reached its peak, your legacy is complete, and you have not encountered any insurmountable bottlenecks. Why risk it now?" Jing Yu could not understand.</p><p>Traveling was not necessarily a good thing.</p><p>Many people only saw others obtaining opportunities and changing their fate against the heavens.</p><p>Have you not seen that those are only a very small minority? How many cultivators have died in foreign lands? Even Nascent Soul Ancestors could encounter danger at any time.</p><p>Jing Yu had a deep understanding of this.</p><p>Unless the path ahead was cut off, or there was an irresistible opportunity, the wisest course of action was to cultivate diligently in seclusion.</p><p>"If I didn't have Liuli and the Ten Directions Divine Shuttle of Earth Division, I would only be able to cultivate patiently. Since there is a way, there is no reason not to go, even if it's just to obtain the opportunity and return."</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully weighed the pros and cons.</p><p>Cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, refining the Demonic Fire, concerned the cultivation of his divine sense, and was an important part of his path. It was something he would have to do sooner or later. The journey would not delay him and would not be a waste of time; it was merely bringing this matter forward.</p><p>Hearing this, Jing Yu no longer tried to dissuade him.</p><p>Having cultivated to Qin Sang's level, everything he did must have been carefully considered and could not be swayed by others.</p><p>"How is Chilei?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Jing Yu said: "I am currently using a bloodline secret art to help him cleanse his blood and refine his marrow. There is no rush to break through. Once the secret art is complete, there will be many benefits after he takes human form."</p><p>Among the demons, the fat chicken had the best innate talent and was the most likely to quickly take human form.</p><p>Spiritual beasts below the Transformation realm could no longer help him.</p><p>The fat chicken had not yet taken human form, so Jing Yu would certainly not leave.</p><p>Qin Sang said no more, and handed the jade slip engraved with the sea chart of the Central Province to Jing Yu.</p><p>After reading it with surprise, she sighed: "Indeed, the journey is long. Fellow Daoist, please be careful! If one day I have the opportunity to break through to the late stage of Transformation, I will consider whether to go to the Central Province. However, hearing you talk about the scenery of the North Sea, I am indeed somewhat tempted. There are still too few Demon Clans in the Northern Star Region. Interacting with more of our own kind will also be helpful to Bai He and the others. When the Green Goat Temple relocates, I will go with you."</p><p>"In the future, the Green Goat Temple will be divided into two locations. Tan Hao alone will not be able to manage both, so I will have to trouble Fellow Daoist to look after things," Qin Sang cupped his hands in a salute.</p><p>Jing Yu blinked and smiled, "Isn't this something I already promised you? Moreover, Fellow Daoist's trip to the Central Province is equivalent to paving the way for us. Naturally, we must help Fellow Daoist take care of the rear!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I will leave the sea chart at the Green Goat Temple. If anyone comes looking for it in the future, do not hide it. Just give them the sea chart."</p><p>Jing Yu carefully noted Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>After a brief stay, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>……</p><p>Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was in secluded cultivation.</p><p>Suddenly, a stream of light flew into the cave dwelling. Mu Yifeng slowly opened his eyes, took the stream of light into his palm, and immediately his face lit up with joy. He hurriedly got up and personally went out to the Sword Gate Pass to welcome the visitor.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin, it's been many years, but your elegance is even more outstanding than before!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng cupped his hands and smiled.</p><p>"Senior Brother Mu, when did you become so glib?"</p><p>Qin Sang joked, and flew with him into Lesser Hua Mountain. When passing through Sword Gate Pass, his figure paused slightly, and he gazed at it for a long time.</p><p>Peach blossoms were in full bloom on both sides of the mountain, and young girls played among them, as if the old scene was reappearing.</p><p>The two entered Mu Yifeng's cave dwelling and sat down.</p><p>"I met Dongyang Bo in the North Sea. He is now dead."</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>Mu Yifeng's movements stiffened, his mouth slightly open.</p><p>"When I met him, his vital energy was failing, and he had only one breath left. He gave me this..."</p><p>Qin Sang did not keep him in suspense any longer. He took out the Yang Puppet Crystal and briefly recounted what had happened. "Senior Brother Qiu is still alive. Dongyang Bo carefully paved the way for him, so he will likely have hope of forming his Nascent Soul in the future. I have decided to relocate some of the Green Goat Temple disciples to the North Sea. Senior Brother, do not spread this matter. If you have free time, you can go to the North Sea with me. If you meet Senior Brother Qiu, you might persuade him to return."</p><p>Mu Yifeng stared at Qin Sang. "Junior Brother, you..."</p><p>Qin Sang said: "Dongyang Bo is dead. The grudges between us are settled. I, Qin, will not vent my anger on innocent people. I also have happy memories on Lesser Hua Mountain, and I am happy to see Lesser Hua Mountain prosper."</p><p>"Thank you, Junior Brother Qin, for your magnanimity!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng sighed softly. "If Master hadn't done those things back then..."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "Let's not talk about that! I see that Senior Brother Mu's realm has stabilized. The next step is to face the Nascent Soul bottleneck. The North Sea is far more vast than the Northern Star Region. Perhaps there will be opportunities..."</p><p>"I still have a long way to go."</p><p>Mu Yifeng shook his head repeatedly. "My cultivation was forcibly raised. Before I encounter the Nascent Soul bottleneck, I still have to go through many hardships. Yufu will probably reach it before me."</p><p>Li Yufu had dual spiritual roots, but his achievements were mediocre.</p><p>Qin Sang established the Green Goat Temple, fulfilling Yun Youzi's last wish.</p><p>Li Yufu resolved his inner demons, and after breaking through to the mid-stage of Core Formation, his momentum did not diminish.</p><p>During Qin Sang's secluded cultivation, Li Yufu was also advancing by leaps and bounds. Now, he has broken through to the late stage of Core Formation in one fell swoop. At this rate, he is expected to become the next Nascent Soul of the Green Goat Temple!</p>
