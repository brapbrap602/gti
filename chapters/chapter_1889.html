<h1>Chapter 1880: Patrolling the Heavens</h1><p>Southern Heaven Gate!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. During the Battle of the Governance Altar, Zuo Zhenren had shared some of the Daoist sect's hidden secrets with him.</p><p>"The Divine Court! The Divine Court is actually within the Lunar Palace!"</p><p>Through the moonlight, past the Southern Heaven Gate, Qin Sang vaguely glimpsed a vast expanse.</p><p>Beneath the Southern Heaven Gate, golden pillars supported the massive structure. Dragons and phoenixes intertwined, a Black Tortoise bore the weight of the heavens, and Qilins stood guard in a circle.</p><p>Beyond the gate lay a world seemingly crafted by immortals. Pure light and ethereal clouds, the celestial river and luminous haze, all formed a wondrous immortal landscape.</p><p>Long bridges spanned across the sea of clouds, some disappearing into the white depths, others connecting to divine mountains and cloud-wreathed ridges.</p><p>Atop the divine mountains, clouds drifted amidst white blossoms within spiritual gardens and immortal orchards.</p><p>The mountains were azure, the water emerald, the wind pure.</p><p>The pines were verdant, the bamboo jade-green, the grass vibrant.</p><p>Azure mists filled the air, obscuring a tapestry of wondrous flowers and embroidered grasses, eternally blooming, perpetually verdant.</p><p>Amongst the cloud-wreathed ridges stood jade palaces and multi-storied celestial halls.</p><p>Golden halls lined up behind golden halls, immortal palaces beyond immortal palaces.</p><p>Towering endlessly, reaching the very clouds, celestial bodies and sacred mountains, all formed a scene of magnificent completeness.</p><p>Truly, it could be said: A celestial palace emerged from the sea of clouds, and starlight converged upon floating rafts.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to see celestial beings treading upon clouds, riding dragons and phoenixes, soaring through the wind, drifting on floating leaves, feasting on immortal winds and divine dew, gathering the eastern purple qi.</p><p>Had he not known this was the Daoist sect's Divine Court, in this moment, in this fleeting trance, Qin Sang might have believed he was about to ascend to immortality, achieving true enlightenment in the celestial realm.</p><p>A sublime immortal landscape, lofty and grand.</p><p>However, these scenes felt unreal to Qin Sang, like viewing flowers in a mirror or gazing at the moon in water.</p><p>A deathly silence pervaded the celestial realm. Though the pines, cypresses, and green bamboos on the immortal mountains flourished, they exuded no vitality, appearing as mere illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang even began to doubt the existence of this 'Celestial Realm,' suspecting it all might be a mirage.</p><p>The bright moon hung high in the nine heavens.</p><p>From the ground, not only could the radiance of the Star Chariot be seen, but the moonlight also grew increasingly brighter, its halo expanding.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned against the jade throne, gripping the armrests tightly, his gaze shifting from the moon to the earth below.</p><p>The dragon soared through the sky.</p><p>Mountains, rivers, and valleys bathed in moonlight rapidly shrank within his field of vision. Qin Sang saw the island where Mo Xingdao was in secluded cultivation, Swordheart Island, the Isle of the Gourd, the northern and southern shores of Star Island's Immortal Lake, the eastern and western great rivers.</p><p>And the outlines of the vast land's mountains...</p><p>At this moment, his heart pounded with tension. The commotion caused by the Taiyi Star Chariot was too great, triggering a lunar anomaly and shaking the entire realm.</p><p>The instant the golden dragon appeared, Qin Sang sensed something was amiss, but it was too late to stop it.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chariot resonated with the bright moon. Such an anomaly couldn't be concealed from the spiritual senses of this realm's powerful beings.</p><p>Qin Sang could almost feel their gazes upon him.</p><p>Regardless, his secret would undoubtedly be revealed. Both the Daoist Court's True Monarchs and the Demon Clan's Great Sages would come seeking him.</p><p>He naturally leaned towards the Daoist Court, but this was not his decision to make.</p><p>What seemed like a distance of ten thousand miles might only be a blink of an eye for powerful beings. No one knew which side would arrive first.</p><p>If both sides arrived simultaneously, he would be caught in the crossfire of their conflict, a fate he wished to avoid.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his fate was uncertain, escape impossible. With a resolute heart, he allowed the Star Chariot to rush towards the Lunar Palace. If he could reach the Divine Court before the True Monarchs and Great Sages arrived, there might still be a chance.</p><p>In truth, he was powerless to stop the golden dragon.</p><p>Something within the Divine Court seemed to draw the golden dragon, urging it forward like a creature eager to return to its nest, pulling the jade chariot forcefully towards the Lunar Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to control the Taiyi Star Chariot, to communicate with the golden dragon, but only received resounding roars in response. He couldn't make it stop.</p><p>What connection did the Taiyi Star Chariot have with the Divine Court?</p><p>What was the relationship between the Seven Kills Hall and the Daoist sect?</p><p>Countless questions swirled in Qin Sang's mind, but he had no time to ponder them now.  He withdrew his gaze and nervously watched the bright moon in the sky.</p><p>During the Battle of the Governance Altar, the True Monarchs and Great Sages had only displayed a fraction of their power, yet their techniques could reach ten thousand miles. With the moon hanging high in the nine heavens, Qin Sang didn't know how long it would take to reach it, fearing he wouldn't have the chance to enter the Divine Court at all.</p><p>However, his worries were quickly dispelled.</p><p>Not only was the golden dragon faster than he imagined, but as Qin Sang rushed towards the Lunar Palace, the moon also drew closer to him.</p><p>The central moon, like a passage to the Divine Court, exerted an irresistible pull on the golden dragon, expanding in his vision at an incredible speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang found himself enveloped by the lunar halo, bathed in cool moonlight, as if traversing through space.</p><p>In such a short time, he couldn't possibly have flown to the moon. He hadn't even felt the impact of the罡 wind.</p><p>Yet, the Southern Heaven Gate was right before him!</p><p>…</p><p>Central Mao Governance Altar.</p><p>A Daoist priest appeared above the golden hall, gazing at the sky with a grave expression.</p><p>A glint flashed in his eyes. The Daoist raised his right hand, his fingers moving in mystical gestures. Before the incantation was complete, he saw the golden dragon pulling the jade chariot into the lunar halo.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The earth, mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas resonated with the bright moon.</p><p>……</p><p>Somewhere within the Ju Mountain Governance.</p><p>A caravan of carriages raced along the main road under the moonlight, their wheels leaving clear tracks on the ground, indicating a heavy load.</p><p>Guards on horseback patrolled the caravan's flanks, vigilant against any threats from the dense forests on either side.</p><p>At the front, two individuals were engaged in a hushed conversation within a lighter carriage.</p><p>"The information is reliable. If we reach Lin Yin City within three days, the value of our goods will increase tenfold..."</p><p>Their words were abruptly cut short by shouts from outside. Their expressions shifted as they felt the ground tremble, as if ten thousand horses were galloping.</p><p>One of them hurriedly peeked through a corner of the curtain.  All the guards were staring skyward, with no sign of bandits.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>He frowned, shouting a reprimand, then looked up at the sky himself, instantly stunned.</p><p>……</p><p>A certain spirit mountain with beautiful peaks.</p><p>A stone cave's entrance stood ajar. Before it, a stone table was set with celestial nectar and immortal fruits. Three Daoist priests sat around it, one singing and drinking, while the other two tapped their jade bowls in accompaniment.</p><p>At the height of their revelry, the singing stopped.</p><p>The three abruptly rose, overturning the stone table without a second thought. They soared into the air, gazing at the familiar moon, their faces etched with astonishment.</p><p>As cultivators, they saw more than ordinary mortals.</p><p>……</p><p>The Land of Calamity.</p><p>Roars and howls echoed ceaselessly, a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>Here, too, the lunar transformation was visible.</p><p>The ferocious beasts within the Land of Calamity were agitated by the lunar anomaly, growing restless.  Soon, skirmishes erupted in many places.</p><p>Deep within the Land of Calamity, powerful auras stirred.</p><p>……</p><p>The Sea of Calamity.</p><p>'Crash... Splash...'</p><p>Despite the absence of a storm, massive waves surged across the sea.</p><p>After the waves receded, mysterious shadows swam beneath the surface.</p><p>Chaos spread silently across the sea. In some areas, the water was stained crimson, gradually merging into a horrifying expanse.</p><p>Towering waves crashed, as if shattering the sea itself, emanating an aura that terrified other sea beasts.</p><p>……</p><p>The tranquility of the Governance Altar was shattered.</p><p>Figures flew out of the golden hall.  Celestial officials, startled by the anomaly, gaped at the celestial phenomenon, speechless with disbelief.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded at the Pacification Altar, the Capital Altar, various Daoist sects, the royal palaces and noble houses of the Ghostfang Kingdom, the sects and secluded cultivation caves of the Ju Mountain Governance…</p><p>……</p><p>The Daoist lowered his hand and withdrew his gaze, looking towards the east, in the direction of the White Stone Governance Altar.</p><p>At the same time, a female Daoist, her lotus feet resting on a bamboo leaf, looked back.</p><p>Their gazes met across the vast distance, each seeming to see the other's grave expression.</p><p>The anomaly was too sudden, without any warning.</p><p>No one had anticipated the Divine Court's emergence at this time. The Daoist Court was completely unprepared.</p><p>Two hundred years of meticulous planning, ruined in an instant!</p><p>The person who triggered the Divine Court's appearance was also beyond their expectations. Unexpected, yet somehow within reason.</p><p>The two True Monarchs seemed to have completed their silent communication, both shifting their gaze towards the Ju Mountain Governance.</p><p>Their eyes focused on Star Island's Immortal Lake, specifically Swordheart Island!</p><p>On Swordheart Island.</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren hovered above the island, gazing at the bright moon, the astonishment still lingering in his eyes.</p><p>His gaze was profound, filled with divine understanding.  Through the lunar halo, he saw the Divine Court, the jade chariot, and the figure upon it.</p><p>At this moment, Zhizhen Zhenren sensed distant gazes upon him. He glanced westward and crushed a spirit talisman.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhizhen?"</p><p>A Daoist's voice resonated in his ears. Although tinged with inquiry, it carried a hint of reproach.</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren sighed softly, his voice apologetic. "This matter was also beyond my expectations. It was my oversight."</p><p>The distant Daoist opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly his mind reeled. Focusing his divine vision, he looked beyond the Ju Mountain Governance, towards the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>He saw the Gang Mountain Governance Altar, also known as the Great Sage's Mansion of the Ghostfang Kingdom, now engulfed in demonic clouds, demonic qi surging skyward.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>A drumbeat resounded, shaking heaven and earth!</p><p>The Daoist's expression drastically changed.  His voice urgent, he asked, "Does the agreement you made with us still stand?"</p><p>The stale qi of the Six Heavens permeated this realm.</p><p>Trapped within, the Daoist sect's cultivators relied on the Divine Court for their cultivation, their power tied to the Merit Seal.</p><p>Bound by the Merit Seal, their cultivation and actions were restricted, yet they couldn't escape this realm.</p><p>This realm wasn't a naturally formed small thousand world, but a fragment of the greater thousand world, severed by Daoist ancestors during a time of crisis, using the Divine Court to seal off this realm and preserve the Daoist lineage.</p><p>Without finding the Divine Court, they couldn't return to the greater thousand world.</p><p>If all four Governance Altars were intact, and the four seals combined, the Daoist Court might still be able to produce a new Celestial Master, reactivate the Divine Court, and restore the Daoist sect's former glory.</p><p>Unfortunately, fate had other plans. The Ju Mountain Governance Altar was destroyed, the ghostly soldiers and gods rebelled, and the situation deteriorated to its current state.</p><p>Daoist Realized Ones and True Monarchs had tried countless methods to break the deadlock, but due to the inherent limitations of this realm, all attempts had failed.</p><p>Until two hundred years ago, a turning point arrived.</p><p>The Ju Mountain Governance Altar inexplicably trembled, and the two True Monarchs faintly sensed the Divine Court's fluctuations.  At the same time, an outsider sought out the Daoist Court – Zhizhen Zhenren.</p><p>They made a pact, agreeing to work together to help the Daoist Court return.</p><p>However, the Divine Court's emergence would inevitably shake the greater thousand world, potentially attracting other Celestial Master-level powerhouses.</p><p>The Daoist Court's Talisman Deities were the pinnacle of talismanic dao cultivation.</p><p>Talisman Deities above the 洞真 realm, such as the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable, were coveted treasures in the eyes of any cultivator.</p><p>Even if the Daoist Court's former enemies were gone, these powerhouses wouldn't hesitate to seize such a powerful Talisman Deity.</p><p>Returning to the greater thousand world presented external threats as well as internal strife.</p><p>The internal strife stemmed from the Ghostfang Kingdom. As expected, the Demon Clan's Great Sage didn't hesitate to sound the Demon Summoning Drum.</p><p>In their original plan, the Daoist Court had prepared for the Divine Court's reactivation while simultaneously using the concept of divinity as bait, luring the demons into a trap by offering fragments of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons map.</p><p>Once the Ghostfang Kingdom's Great Sage truly merged with divinity, stepping onto the path of godhood and becoming a Divine Spirit, the Daoist Court, after gaining control of the Divine Court, could easily subdue the Ghostfang Kingdom through the Divine Court's influence over Divine Spirits, resolving the internal strife and focusing on external threats.</p><p>During the Daoist sect's self-imposed isolation, the concept of divinity in the outside world had continued to evolve, diverging significantly from the Daoist sect's own interpretation of divinity, derived from talismanic dao.</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren brought the outside world's divine scriptures into this realm. After modifying them, the Daoist Court discreetly sent them to the Ghostfang Kingdom, providing the demons with new inspiration.</p><p>For countless years, both the Daoist sect and the Ghostfang Kingdom had relentlessly sought a way out, clinging to any glimmer of hope.</p><p>If the Great Sage gained enlightenment from these scriptures, he would undoubtedly pursue this new path of divinity, thus falling into their trap.</p><p>Meanwhile, to avoid alerting the demons, the True Monarchs couldn't act rashly. The task of finding the Divine Court fell to Zhizhen Zhenren.</p><p>He was a true sword cultivator, his dao foundation residing in the sword, not the Divine Court.  Embracing his sword and maintaining his unity of will, he was surprisingly able to enter the Ju Mountain Governance Altar.</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren ventured into the Ju Mountain Governance Altar multiple times, gradually gaining clues and successfully leading the Ghostfang Kingdom into the trap.</p><p>Everything was progressing favorably, but an unexpected event occurred.</p><p>The Divine Court's emergence, triggered by the divine chariot beneath Qin Sang, caught the Daoist Court off guard. Their preparations were far from complete.</p><p>Without the Celestial Master's decree, even True Monarchs couldn't immediately enter the Divine Court, despite locating the Southern Heaven Gate.  However, there was one exception.</p><p>The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons map fragments!</p><p>The Netherworld Capital had once been connected to the Divine Court, essentially becoming a part of it.  As long as one knew the Divine Court's location, they could use the fragments to send demon cultivators who had become Divine Spirits into the Divine Court.</p><p>Moreover, even if the Demon Clan's Great Sage hadn't yet achieved godhood, he could still use the fragments to force his way into the Divine Court!</p><p>If the demons were to occupy the Divine Court, the consequences would be dire. The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons map fragments they had offered would become their own undoing.</p><p>These were secondary concerns.</p><p>The Daoist gazed into the deep void, his brow furrowed. The Divine Court's unexpected appearance had sent tremors throughout the greater thousand world, impossible to conceal.</p><p>If Zhizhen Zhenren broke his pact and abandoned the Daoist Court, the sect, unable to cope with both internal and external threats, would face utter annihilation!</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren let out a long, resounding laugh. "We sword cultivators strive for the straight path, not resorting to crooked means. How could I break my word?  I would rather die than betray my principles!"</p><p>His laughter echoed.</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren stepped forward, treading upon empty air, ascending towards the heavens.</p><p>The Sword Slave stood on the island, his face filled with worry. Suddenly, Zhizhen Zhenren's voice boomed down.  "Tonight is the time for you to slay your enemies and achieve your breakthrough. Why do you tarry?"</p><p>The Sword Slave's heart jolted. He respectfully bowed, summoned his spirit sword, and flew north towards the Land of Calamity.</p><p>……</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived, riding the dragon, feeling as if he had crossed an invisible barrier, effortlessly passing beneath the Southern Heaven Gate without any hindrance.</p><p>Just as he passed through the Southern Heaven Gate, Qin Sang's vision blurred. A figure appeared, blocking his path.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhizhen?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was etched with shock.</p><p>The figure before him was indeed Zhizhen Zhenren, but his form was illusory, seemingly a phantom conjured from primordial spirit power.</p><p>"I am Tian Yue!"</p><p>Zhizhen Zhenren's voice was deep and resonant.</p><p>At this moment, his aura was completely different from the Zhizhen Zhenren Qin Sang knew.</p><p>Tian Yue?</p><p>The Tian Yue Shangren of the Northern Dipper Realm?</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression drastically shifted.</p><p>"I was entrusted to help you reach the Void Refinement Realm in this world."</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren looked at the divine chariot beneath Qin Sang, his eyes complex. "I initially thought it was the Phoenix Feather's doing, but it turns out to be the Daoist Court's Heaven Patrolling Chariot... No wonder you could break through the barrier and enter this realm!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
