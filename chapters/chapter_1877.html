<h1>Chapter 1868: Twenty-Four Days of Hell</h1><p>Two powerful Yokai manifested their true forms. One was a ferocious Earth-Armored Dragon, the other a humanoid figure radiating crimson light, a being seemingly forged from fire itself.</p><p>As the two sides clashed, the Yokai Kings silently manipulated their manifestations, linking them to a nearby illusory landscape.</p><p>This landscape was a fiery world, where rivers of magma crisscrossed the land, radiating intense heat. The ground was covered in black, metal-like rocks, hardened by eons of fiery refinement.  Countless flames danced in the void, ever-present.</p><p>A sea of fire, reaching to the heavens, consumed all within its reach!</p><p>The Yokai Kings' goal was this very place. The Earth-Armored Dragon manipulated the earth and rocks, while the Fire Spirit gathered the swirling flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A crimson hurricane swept through the illusory landscape.</p><p>The fire wind relentlessly absorbed surrounding flames, its color deepening, its power growing. Simultaneously, the earth rumbled, the ground cracked, and massive boulders were flung into the air.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The fire wind swept over the boulders, engulfing them. The sounds of collision echoed within the flames.</p><p>Rocks pierced the air, fire rained down.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, both the flames and the black stones underwent a strange transformation, their essence refined. The fire and earth power within the illusory landscape were being manipulated by the two Yokai Kings.</p><p>Soon, a massive black stone, engulfed in flames, appeared, suspended in mid-air.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The stone vibrated slightly, causing the entire illusory space to shake violently.</p><p>As the chaos intensified, the stone finally moved, instantly accelerating to incredible speed, shooting towards the edge of the illusion.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The barrier between illusory landscapes was pierced.</p><p>The adjacent landscape was a pitch-black void. A massive meteorite crashed in, shattering the silence.  The impact painted half the sky crimson, the light dazzling.</p><p>The fiery meteorite, like a comet, trailed a long tail, streaking across the void, leaving a persistent crimson scar in its wake.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The fiery meteorite pierced through numerous illusory landscapes, drawing closer to the battlefield.</p><p>The two Yokai manifestations retreated to the outer edges of the battlefield, tilting their heads slightly to watch the approaching fiery meteorite.  Divine light erupted from their bodies, merging, their power surging, their eyes filled with excitement and bloodlust.</p><p>The Daoist forces sensed danger and tried to disrupt the Yokai Kings' technique, but it was too late.</p><p>The Yokai, noticing the Daoist formation attempting to move towards the Yokai Kings, fought desperately to prevent them.</p><p>“There! What is that?”</p><p>A Daoist master looked up, witnessing the crimson sky, a faint crimson rainbow, his heart jolted, his expression changing dramatically, as he exclaimed.</p><p>More and more masters noticed the anomaly.  All felt the terrifying power that suffocated them.</p><p>The three Grand Masters’ faces were grim.</p><p>The old Daoist remained calm and collected, reaching into his robes, retrieving a golden rope. Secretly communicating with the other Grand Masters, he prepared to throw the rope.</p><p>At that crucial moment, the auspicious clouds experienced unprecedented violent tremors.</p><p>This tremor was not only intense, but also possessed a peculiar ripple emanating from the center of the clouds.</p><p>On the battlefield, even the lowest-ranking Yokai soldiers felt this unusual wave.</p><p>For a moment, all eyes were drawn to the auspicious clouds.</p><p>The White-robed Yokai King advanced ten more meters, but this did not obstruct their view, as the clouds had become significantly thinner during the tremors.</p><p>The imperial decree was gone.  The White-robed Yokai King stared intently into the depths of the auspicious clouds, ignoring the gazes behind him.</p><p>His gaze was fixed on the source of the tremors, where a multicolored vortex had inexplicably appeared.</p><p>The vortex stirred the clouds, initially tiny, but expanding rapidly. Half of the imperial decree was at its center, sinking deep into the vortex moments later.</p><p>This wave was clearly connected to the Heavenly Court, originating from the depths of the vortex.</p><p>The White-robed Yokai King seemed to have discovered some secret, as if he had opened a passage to the Heavenly Court.</p><p>The Gui Fang’s Yokai rejoiced, while the Daoist masters’ faces fell.</p><p>To make matters worse, the meteorite was now visible to the masters, its celestial might bearing down upon them.</p><p>The masters could only imagine the horrific fate of being struck by the fiery meteorite.</p><p>However, more urgent than the meteorite was breaking through the Yokai formation and stopping the White-robed Yokai King from entering the Heavenly Court first.</p><p>If the Heavenly Court fell into the hands of the demons, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p>Unable to handle both threats, the masters were desperate, turning to the old Daoist for guidance.</p><p>The old Daoist’s movements stiffened slightly, his expression shifting several times. He tucked the golden rope back into his robes and produced a small seal.</p><p>This seal, carved from black jade, measured only an inch and a fifth across.  Small and exquisitely crafted, it exuded an ancient aura, resembling an ancient divine seal.</p><p>Several noticeable cracks marred its surface, but the seal itself remained intact.</p><p>With a tremor in his palm, the Daoist launched the seal into the air, allowing the cultivators to see the inscription.</p><p>“The North Pole Divine Seal of Judgement!”</p><p>A demon king, recognizing the inscription, cried out in alarm, a flicker of fear crossing his eyes.</p><p>This fear wasn't true terror, but an instinctive dread, inherited from his ancestors.  This demon king’s ancestors had served as ghost gods under the Heavenly Court, belonging to the Fengdu Netherworld and under the jurisdiction of the North Pole Exorcism Bureau.</p><p>As the name suggests, the North Pole Divine Seal of Judgement possessed the power to subdue the ghost gods of both the Yin and Yang realms.  Whoever wielded it could oversee the deeds of ghost gods, holding the power of life and death over them; no ghost god dared disobey.</p><p>Countless years had passed, and the descendants of the ghost gods had long since severed ties with the Heavenly Court, yet the fear of this seal remained ingrained in their bloodline.</p><p>Its survival within the Heavenly Court, seemingly in good condition, suggested its power remained largely undiminished.</p><p>The demons were astonished, but also puzzled. Among the demon kings who had entered the altar, there were no divine path cultivators.  Contemporary divine path cultivators practiced a system independently developed by the Gui Fang Kingdom. Though derived from the ghost god path of the old Daoist schools, it differed significantly, and may not be susceptible to this seal’s suppression.</p><p>What was the old Daoist’s intention in revealing this seal?</p><p>Their confusion didn't last long.</p><p>The old Daoist, having presented the North Pole Divine Seal of Judgement without activating it, flicked his sleeve and produced another object: a yellow scroll.</p><p>The scroll unfurled slowly.</p><p>A Xuanhuang light, as thick and heavy as the earth itself, emanated from it.  At the heart of this light, a black aura swirled, radiating an icy chill, like the Yin energy of the Nine Netherworlds.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The scroll fully opened, slightly smaller than the altar beneath the old Daoist’s feet, its shape irregular, like a fragment torn from a larger piece of cloth.</p><p>‘Whooooosh…’</p><p>A howling wind swept through the battlefield, chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>“Could this be…?”</p><p>A demon king, recognizing it, showed a look of alarm. The other demon kings quickly understood.</p><p>Gasps of astonishment followed:  “The Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons Record! It's a fragment of the Yin Heavenly Palace’s Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons!”</p><p>As the exclamations rang out, the Xuanhuang energy within the scroll rapidly expanded, causing the scroll itself to grow. The small scroll seemed limitless.</p><p>In an instant, boundless Xuanhuang energy enveloped the cultivators.</p><p>They felt as though they stood beneath a vast expanse of Xuanhuang earth, their minds reeling in awe.</p><p>At the center of the Xuanhuang energy, the black aura persisted, expanding with the scroll.</p><p>The Yin energy roiled, dense and unyielding, resembling a mountain range on the Xuanhuang earth.</p><p>Within the Yin energy, a mountain truly existed, echoing with mournful cries and strange howls, as though containing myriad ghosts.</p><p>This mountain was a Celestial Prison!</p><p>This scroll was the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons Record, once crafted by the Houtu Grand Master to develop the divine path, used to capture demons and ghosts, refine them into ghost soldiers, judge their merits and demerits, and integrate those who submitted into ghost gods.</p><p>However, it was barely a fragment now, a scrap obtained by an ancestor of the Yin Heavenly Palace, who used it to found their sect and develop a new technique – the North Emperor Subduing Demons Secret Art.</p><p>Due to limitations in cultivation, the North Emperor Subduing Demons Secret Art had only reached its third stage.</p><p>The North Emperor Subduing Demons Secret Art connected to the fragment of the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons Record, not the Divine Court, making the Yin Heavenly Palace the most unique entity within the Daoist tradition.  The limitations of the fragment were also evident.</p><p>The fragment contained celestial prisons, could hold ghost soldiers, and featured talismans left by ancient masters.</p><p>In the past, Fengdu and the Divine Court coexisted, with neither realm completely dominant. Fengdu was a mix of ghost gods and talisman gods.</p><p>The Yin Heavenly Palace selected some ghost soldiers, merging them with certain talisman gods to create ghost gods.</p><p>Ghost gods commanded ghost soldiers, obeying the commands of the Yin Heavenly Palace's masters.</p><p>Yin Heavenly Palace cultivators had an advantage over Daoist cultivators; they could employ summoning techniques to command the talisman gods within the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons Record.</p><p>The Yin Heavenly Palace established their sect in the mountainous region of Ju Shan, rooted in the Yellow Springs, to capture and subdue beasts on the battlefield, replenishing the celestial prisons and training ghost soldiers.</p><p>In a sense, the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons fragment was also a treasure for gathering troops.</p><p>The special environment within the altar prevented the use of immensely powerful treasures, but the Twenty-Four Celestial Prisons fragment was perfectly suited to the situation. The Heavenly Court had secretly borrowed this treasure and brought it into the altar!</p><p>The Celestial Prison appeared!</p><p>The Yin energy surged, the ghost howls reverberated, chilling everyone to the marrow.</p><p>The howls grew sharper, more piercing.</p><p>Because the celestial prison's foundation was unstable due to only possessing a fragment of the map, the Yin Heavenly Palace established a large formation on Crane Song Mountain.  Placing the fragment within the formation stabilized the prison.</p><p>Now, brought into the execution platform, the ghost soldiers felt the restraints on them weakening.  Some of the more aggressive ones began to clamor.</p><p>Even the ghost commanders who had submitted to the Yin Heavenly Palace and were granted the title of ghost gods showed signs of wavering. They appeared above the celestial prison, exchanged glances, and looked beyond it.</p><p>Some eyes gleamed with ambition, others hesitated, but ultimately, they let the ghost soldiers' unrest grow unchecked. They made no attempt to control them, allowing the chaos to spread.</p><p>However, bound to the celestial prison, they couldn't easily escape and decided to wait and see.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The old Daoist, seeing through their intentions, flicked his whisk. The North Pole Execution God Seal transformed into light, shooting towards the celestial prison.</p><p>Instantly, the ghost gods felt a chilling fear, followed by the sight of six large crimson characters appearing above the prison.</p><p>It was the North Pole Execution God Seal!</p><p>They couldn't see the entire seal, only the inscription. The six characters, seemingly stained with blood, emanated a terrifying aura of slaughter, descending from the heavens.</p><p>The ghost gods were terrified, struck with fear, feeling that a single touch of the inscription would shatter their souls.</p><p>In their terror, they knelt, trembling, no longer daring to harbor any evil thoughts.</p><p>“By the North Emperor's command, descend and obey!</p><p>You ghost soldiers, reveal yourselves!”</p><p>The old Daoist roared.</p><p>“Obeying the divine decree!”</p><p>The ghost gods kowtowed, rose, and looked towards the celestial prison. They waved their command talismans.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The prison gates opened, and waves of black energy surged forth. The ghostly howls intensified tenfold.</p><p>The ghost gods flew into a rage, glaring at the rioting ghost soldiers, and fiercely swung their execution whips.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack! Crack!’</p><p>A chorus of ghostly wails followed. All the clamor ceased.  The formation reformed, and at the old Daoist's command, they charged from the celestial prison.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>“Hee hee hee hee…”</p><p>Eerie howls echoed. Though called ghost soldiers, most were ferocious beasts and demonic cultivators from Gui Fang, imprisoned in the celestial prison for years, their natures twisted, becoming even more bloodthirsty.</p><p>The ghost gods led the soldiers into a frenzied battle against the enemy.</p><p>The old Daoist continued his actions. He looked up at the fragment of the celestial prison map, fingers forming hand seals, feet stepping the celestial compass, reciting incantations.</p><p>“East Mountain incantation, summoning the nine heavens.</p><p>Crimson book decree, controlling Mount Feng.</p><p>Binding demons, sending ghosts, those slain without exception.</p><p>All shall arrive at the Wood Palace, let there be no delay!”</p><p>With the incantation finished, the old Daoist flicked his whisk towards the east.</p><p>Following the chant, the Xuanhuang energy within the fragment of the celestial prison map surged.  At the point where the energy condensed, figures seemed to appear.</p><p>Next, golden light suddenly shot from the Xuanhuang energy towards the direction the old Daoist's whisk pointed.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Golden light descended from heaven, landing on the eastern army's heads. Faintly visible within each golden ray was a shadowy talismanic deity.</p><p>The deities lacked sentience, like statues in a temple, each with different postures and expressions.  Their appearances weren't necessarily human; some were mighty gods with three heads and six arms, others were monstrous and terrifying fiends.</p><p>The incantation the old Daoist chanted was the Lingbao Red Scripture Secret Text Ghost Incantation, an ancient technique from the North Pole Exorcism Academy, used to summon talismanic deities from Fengdu.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The talismanic deities descended, transforming into golden light that enveloped the army.  In an instant, all the soldiers were clad in golden armor, feeling immense divine power infused within them, roaring repeatedly, their morale soaring.</p><p>Empowered by the deities, their strength was far beyond what it had been.</p><p>“Crimson text commands the spirits, North controls Mount Feng.</p><p>Binding and sending the demonic sect, destroying the evil root.</p><p>The Talisman Teachings decree, clearly listing the crimes.</p><p>South Mountain incantation, subduing the eight directions.</p><p>Annihilating demons, crushing them in ten thousand trials!”</p><p>The old Daoist continued his steps, his incantations ceaseless. He flicked his whisk, pointing towards the south.</p><p>“Crimson book jade characters, nine heaven true text.</p><p>Summoning myriad demons to return to the Emperor’s grace.”</p><p>His whisk pointed towards the west.</p><p>“North Mountain incantation, stimulating the sun, raising thunder.</p><p>Flowing bells, descending light, Heavenly authority.</p><p>The North Feng forces, destroying ten thousand demons.”</p><p>When the northern army was also bathed in golden light, nearly all the realists’ troops received the divine power.</p><p>Golden light shot up into the sky on the battlefield, the demonic soldiers seemingly transformed into true heavenly soldiers.</p><p>The summoning of heavenly deities was more than just an infusion of divine power.  The demonic soldiers, imbued with the power of the talismanic deities, were subconsciously guided by that power, even abandoning their instincts, allowing the realists to command them as if extensions of their own bodies.  </p><p>The cooperation between the soldiers reached an unparalleled level, and with the help of the talismanic deities, they could unleash incredibly powerful spells surpassing their inherent abilities.</p><p>“North Emperor’s decree, opening the ghost gate.</p><p>Exterminating the ominous, let none stand in the way!”</p><p>The old Daoist's eyes widened, his voice like thunder, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>All the soldiers roared in response!</p>
