<h1>Chapter 2029: Not Easy</h1><p>Who could have imagined that Patriarch Pei, having waited for so long, would lack such patience as to make a move here?</p><p>Third Elder’s eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Patriarch Pei, as if filled with bone-deep hatred. With a furious roar, the pupils within the illusory eye formed from grey Qi behind him abruptly dilated.</p><p>The pupils expanded to almost fill the entire eye, turning it pitch black and radiating an eerie light. Wherever his gaze fell, tiny black specks suddenly surged within the mist.</p><p>Initially minuscule, these black specks rapidly swelled and grew larger, writhing like countless maggots in the void. These 'maggots' were actually capable of devouring the surrounding mist, swarming towards Patriarch Pei in a dark, oppressive mass.</p><p>Third Elder’s intention was to directly attack Patriarch Pei’s true body while he was preoccupied with dealing with the Nether Spirit.</p><p>The maggots filled the sky. The Abyssal Yang Ultimate Formation that Patriarch Pei had deployed seemed unable to stop their advance. They easily pierced through layers of dense fog, pouncing towards him.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed Patriarch Pei’s face. It wasn’t because of the maggots’ abilities, but because Third Elder actually had the audacity to attack him, a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>While some family members might adhere to the principle of shared prosperity and ruin, most would scatter like birds at the first sign of disaster. Thanks to the prestige of the previous family head and Young Master Xin’s painstaking efforts, the Xin family remained united, but only because they hadn't yet faced a major catastrophe.</p><p>Had it been Great Elder Xin or Steward Luo here, Patriarch Pei wouldn’t have been so surprised. This Third Elder wasn’t even at the late Nascent Soul stage. His courage was commendable, nothing more.</p><p>Patriarch Pei merely glanced at Third Elder, the disdain and disregard in his eyes causing Third Elder’s face to flush crimson with humiliation.</p><p>Facing the onslaught of black maggots, Patriarch Pei remained motionless. The surrounding mist trembled, sending out ripples that expanded into a surging tide of fog.  The momentum of the incoming black maggots instantly faltered, the first wave flung back on the spot.</p><p>Their ability to devour mist now failed. The fog tide effortlessly swept through the black maggots, and with a series of popping sounds, they burst apart, leaving behind scattered wisps of black Qi that were instantly dispersed by the mist.</p><p>Third Elder was stunned, finally recognizing the vast chasm between himself and a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>When Third Elder had attacked, Young Master Xin had opened his mouth, intending to explain, but it was too late to stop him. Third Elder’s attack had pushed the situation beyond redemption.</p><p>Of course, even without Third Elder, Patriarch Pei wouldn't have shown any mercy. The Nether Spirit was already engulfed by a deluge of fiery rings.</p><p>The mist was dyed red by the firelight. Countless fire rings danced in the air, leaving trails of crimson. The flames radiated a terrifying heat, making the three feel as if they were submerged in magma.</p><p>The Nether Spirit shielded Young Master Xin and Third Elder beneath its form, its body swelling dramatically to transform into an abnormally large black giant.</p><p>The giant’s feet trod the ocean, its head brushing against the heavens as it looked down at Patriarch Pei, an image of immense power.  Its body continued to expand, seemingly intending to shatter the formation, to shatter this entire realm!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As the Nether Spirit grew, boundless Heavenly and Earthly Qi poured into it, surpassing even mountains in size. The Nether Spirit clenched its fists tightly and roared towards the sky.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The roar was like thunder, deafening, yet it couldn't penetrate beyond the formation.</p><p>With a slight movement, the Nether Spirit was about to unleash a punch.  Its fist wasn't aimed at Patriarch Pei but, as Third Elder had suggested, at the formation itself. If it could breach the formation's blockade and transmit the fluctuations of the battle outside, there was a chance of attracting help.</p><p>Unfortunately, Patriarch Pei had struck first, seizing the initiative. He had been anticipating this and wouldn't allow the Nether Spirit to succeed. As the Nether Spirit’s body swelled, it was enveloped by countless fire rings, which then began to bombard it relentlessly.</p><p>Compared to the Nether Spirit's enormous body, these fire rings were the size of bracelets, yet they contained terrifying power.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>The fire rings rained down, too numerous to count, coming from all directions.</p><p>Young Master Xin initially intended for the Nether Spirit to endure the fire rings and focus on breaking the formation, but the rings’ power exceeded his expectations. Each impact on the Nether Spirit erupted in a burst of firelight, quickly turning the surrounding area into a sea of flames.</p><p>Under the relentless barrage, the Nether Spirit’s body swayed constantly. Its growth was abruptly halted, and it was forced to shrink, its imposing aura drastically diminished.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Young Master Xin quickly commanded the Nether Spirit to swing its left hand.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Countless fire rings shattered under the force of the palm wind, but more continued to appear endlessly.</p><p>Both Young Master Xin and Third Elder knew this wasn’t a sustainable strategy.  This stalemate benefited Patriarch Pei and put them at a severe disadvantage. Moreover, Young Master Xin keenly noticed that the shattered fire rings didn’t seem to completely dissipate.</p><p>A faint red glow had appeared around the Nether Spirit's limbs, neck, and waist.  As more fire rings shattered, the red glow became more distinct, resembling shackles binding the Nether Spirit. Its movements were becoming noticeably sluggish.</p><p>Once the shackles fully formed, the consequences would be dire. Patriarch Pei's words were true; the Abyssal Yang Ultimate Formation could indeed suppress the Nether Spirit!</p><p>Young Master Xin paled, ordering the Nether Spirit to attack hastily.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Nether Spirit swung its right arm, unleashing a powerful punch. The force of the blow caused the clouds within the formation to disperse and the mist to surge, as if the heavens and earth were being overturned. Yet, as expected, it failed to break through the Abyssal Yang Ultimate Formation.</p><p>Seeing this, Young Master Xin could only change his hand seals, rapidly shrinking the Nether Spirit until it was only the height of two or three men.</p><p>Reduced in size, the Nether Spirit lost its world-conquering aura, but its body became more solid. With a sudden tremor, a cloud of smoke erupted from it, dimming the shackles somewhat.</p><p>This action alleviated the situation slightly, but the danger remained.</p><p>Young Master Xin and Third Elder flashed into the Nether Spirit's body.  Seated cross-legged within its abdomen, Young Master Xin’s expression quickly calmed, becoming as still as a well.  His mind merged with the Nether Spirit, becoming one with it.</p><p>At this moment, the Nether Spirit suddenly became still, slowly raising its head to face Patriarch Pei.</p><p>Strangely, the Nether Spirit's face was smooth as a mirror, devoid of features.  However, as it met Patriarch Pei’s gaze, ripples and undulations appeared on its surface, gradually forming facial features.</p><p>At first, they were rudimentary, merely outlines of eyes, nose, and mouth, completely uncoordinated, crooked, and incredibly ugly.  But they quickly became more defined, and the face began to resemble Patriarch Pei.</p><p>Staring intently at Patriarch Pei, the Nether Spirit’s features continued to shift, becoming increasingly similar.  Ignoring the difference in size, if someone claimed it was Patriarch Pei's brother, no one would doubt it.</p><p>Patriarch Pei, who kept his true body hidden within his Dharma Body out of caution, noticed something amiss with his physical form. His expression grew grave, realizing this must be another of the Nether Spirit's strange techniques.  But he showed no panic.  With a cold laugh, he quickly formed a hand seal, flipping his palm downwards.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The fiery rings ceased their bombardment, exploding simultaneously.</p><p>Crimson flames descended, transforming the ground beneath the three into an abyss of raging fire. Then, the flames converged, forming nine enormous fireballs, like nine great suns, only they sank into the fiery abyss instead of hanging in the sky.</p><p>Nine suns appeared, arranged in a peculiar formation.</p><p>Immediately afterward, an intensely hot and incredibly powerful suction force erupted from the depths of the fiery abyss.</p><p>Caught off guard, the Nether Spirit’s body plummeted hundreds of feet in an instant, its form stretched and distorted as it was pulled towards the fiery abyss.</p><p>Young Master Xin hurriedly manipulated the Nether Spirit to counterattack.  Its right foot stomped down heavily, unleashing a beam of black light that transformed into a long blade.</p><p>The blade slashed across the sky, seemingly splitting the heavens, striking directly at the fiery abyss!</p><p>As the blade struck, the suction force lessened, but at the cost of the Nether Spirit’s newly formed features becoming distorted once more.</p><p>Young Master Xin wanted to seize the opportunity and complete the secret technique, but a bizarre scene unfolded.  As the blade entered the fiery abyss, the flames below suddenly vanished, and the nine suns disappeared. Instead, intense heat radiated from above.</p><p>The same suction force erupted again, but this time from above.</p><p>Unnoticed, the heavens and earth had flipped, and the nine suns now hung high above.</p><p>Before the Nether Spirit could regain its balance, it was pulled upwards with immense force, forcing it to change its tactics once again, interrupting Young Master Xin’s secret technique a second time.</p><p>Next, the nine suns constantly shifted their positions, and Patriarch Pei appeared and disappeared unpredictably, as if this entire realm was under his control. He flipped his palm, and the heavens turned; he covered with his palm, and the earth shifted!</p><p>Such simple tactics, yet they consistently disrupted the Nether Spirit’s secret techniques.  Throughout this process, the shackles were silently strengthening.</p><p>Young Master Xin’s vital essence was rapidly depleting.  Her weakness was becoming undeniable, and the Nether Spirit’s counterattacks grew weaker.</p><p>Time was running out. Unless Young Master Xin had another trump card, they would be at Patriarch Pei’s mercy.</p><p>Third Elder was frantic. Patriarch Pei was too strong.  They had been completely outmaneuvered. If Patriarch Pei hadn't wanted to capture them alive, their situation might have been even worse.  Mutual destruction was impossible. He feared they were already defeated, and Recluse Zhong Liang hadn't arrived yet. This gamble might cost them dearly.</p><p>At this moment, the shackles on the Nether Spirit were extremely prominent – six shackles binding its body.</p><p>Young Master Xin had attempted various secret techniques, all of which were countered by Patriarch Pei.  Yet she didn't plead for mercy, gritting her teeth and persisting.</p><p>Just then, the void trembled slightly.</p><p>The tremor was almost imperceptible, difficult for those engaged in the fierce battle to detect. But as it occurred, a figure suddenly materialized at the edge of the battlefield, within the void.</p><p>The figure was the old man who had previously appeared at the tomb entrance.</p><p>The old man looked stunned, clearly not expecting to be exposed so suddenly. He believed he had concealed himself well, planning to wait patiently for a better opportunity to strike a decisive blow and become the ultimate victor.</p><p>His exposure was completely unexpected. It was too late to conceal himself again.</p><p>Caught off guard, the old man didn't have time to ponder why the void had trembled, leading to his exposure.  He reacted swiftly, his sleeves fluttering, and a golden light flashed.</p><p>It was a dagger-sized golden sword, its hilt encrusted with various gemstones, resembling an exquisite piece of art.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The moment the golden sword appeared, it erupted with terrifying killing intent and incredible speed, transforming into a golden lightning bolt. The sword light flashed like a golden dragon, fiercely tearing through the sea of mist, aiming directly for Patriarch Pei’s back.</p><p>If pierced by the golden sword, even a Void Refinement cultivator's Dharma Body would shatter on the spot, let alone Patriarch Pei’s true body hidden within. This was the killing move the old man had prepared, intending to unleash it at a more opportune moment.</p><p>“Zhong Liang!”</p><p>Patriarch Pei’s furious roar echoed through the mist, his voice filled with boundless rage.</p><p>The newcomer was indeed Recluse Zhong Liang, who had coveted the Xin family since the death of their old family head.  Moreover, this man was at the mid Void Refinement stage, his strength a cut above Patriarch Pei’s.</p><p>Only by joining forces could the Xin family and Patriarch Pei contend with him.</p><p>Recluse Zhong Liang’s sudden appearance was completely unexpected.  On the verge of success, yet thwarted by this unexpected turn of events, Patriarch Pei’s fury was understandable.</p><p>He had been locked in a struggle with Recluse Zhong Liang for many years and knew his strength well. At this moment, he felt immensely fortunate that, while dealing with the Nether Spirit, he had also devoted a significant portion of his attention to guarding against Elder Qin.</p><p>Unexpectedly, instead of Elder Qin, it was Recluse Zhong Liang who appeared.</p><p>Simultaneously with the arrival of the golden sword, a fire banner rose from within his Dharma Body.</p><p>The fire banner unfurled, flapping in the wind.</p><p>With a flick of the long banner, a vast torrent of flames surged forth.  With a ‘poof,’ the golden sword plunged into the torrent.</p><p>A river of flames stretched across the space behind Patriarch Pei.  The golden sword persevered, its golden light flickering within the river of fire.</p><p>Recluse Zhong Liang’s sneak attack was incredibly swift, but Patriarch Pei’s reaction was equally fast. Even if the golden sword ultimately pierced through the river of flames, the fire banner’s obstruction had bought Patriarch Pei a moment to breathe.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Recluse Zhong Liang’s laughter echoed within the formation.</p><p>Third Elder was ecstatic but kept his emotions hidden, glancing at Young Master Xin’s profile with a flicker in his eyes.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A gap was blasted open in the mist from the outside, and Recluse Zhong Liang flew in, a nine-storied pagoda hovering before him. It was this pagoda that had breached the formation.</p><p>He knew the golden sword wouldn't kill Patriarch Pei. Taking advantage of Patriarch Pei’s distraction, he headed straight for the Nether Spirit.</p><p>“Little girl, do you understand now how insidious and cunning that old ghost Pei is? Cooperating with him is no different from sleeping with a tiger. The Xin family will be left with nothing!”</p><p>As he spoke, Recluse Zhong Liang exchanged a glance with Third Elder.</p><p>Third Elder hesitated. He had pledged allegiance to Recluse Zhong Liang, but he hadn't betrayed the Xin family.  In his view, with the Xin family's current strength, this path wouldn't last. It was better to choose a powerful figure to rely on.</p><p>He had practically watched Young Master Xin grow up. Even if he harbored ambitions to usurp her position, he found it difficult to personally strike against her.  However, the current situation allowed no room for hesitation.</p><p>Just then, Third Elder saw Young Master Xin raise her head, her expression strangely calm.</p><p>For some reason, Third Elder’s heart skipped a beat, a sense of foreboding rising within him.</p><p>“Senior Zhong Liang, Senior Pei.”</p><p>Young Master Xin’s voice was as calm as her expression, as if oblivious to her current predicament.</p><p>“With your intelligence, it truly wasn’t easy to lure you both here. After all, I only have this one chance.”</p><p>These words caused both Recluse Zhong Liang and Patriarch Pei’s expressions to change.  They simultaneously turned to look at this seemingly frail young woman.</p><p>Without the Nether Spirit, they could crush Young Master Xin with a single hand. Now, with her vital essence drained and weakened, and the Nether Spirit’s strength greatly diminished, they still felt a sense of unease, and it was intensifying.</p><p>“I must also thank Third Elder for helping me lead Senior Zhong Liang here,” Young Master Xin turned and sincerely thanked Third Elder.</p><p>“Xin Sheng, you…”</p><p>Third Elder suddenly saw Young Master Xin seemingly crush something in her hand.  Her figure became illusory.</p><p>At this moment, the entire formation outside, along with countless islands and mountains, trembled violently.</p><p>“Seize her!”</p><p>Recluse Zhong Liang and Patriarch Pei roared in unison.</p>
