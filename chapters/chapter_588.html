<h1>Chapter 581: Void Thunder</h1><p>A black panther emerged from the shadows, its fur sleek and glossy, devoid of any markings.  A golden ring, not appearing to be a magical treasure, adorned its neck.  The panther blocked the entrance to the stone hall, its gaze playful as it observed the two men standing ready for battle.  It appeared relaxed, regarding Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, along with the Night Spectre, with the same indifference one might show to playthings.  For a demon beast at the mid-stage of the Core Formation realm, Foundation Establishment cultivators were negligible, and even the strongest among them, the Night Spectre, could be easily dispatched.</p><p>“Shadow Leopard!” Yun Youzi’s eyes turned cold, his expression hardening beneath his mask.  He warned Qin Sang, "The Shadow Leopard clan serves under the Feathered Demon King. This one is their king, and its ability to conceal its presence is unmatched even among demonkind. Be extremely careful."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  The Shadow Leopard's stealth was renowned, even among cultivators.  Furthermore, it was at the mid Core Formation stage, two full realms above them. It was no wonder Yun Youzi's tracking marks hadn't detected it.  Looking at the panther, a sense of dread washed over him.</p><p>He stood by the lake, frozen, his blood running cold. He could feel a faint, yet undeniable, aura lock onto him.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard paced leisurely, seemingly without any killing intent.  It ignored the Crimson Cloud Fruit on the other side of the lake, showing no interest in contesting for it.  But Qin Sang knew that if he made even the slightest move, he would face a swift and devastating attack.</p><p>If it were only an early-stage Core Formation beast, Qin Sang could have unleashed his Corpse Pill, combined with his treasures and the Night Spectre, and stood a good chance of victory. But against a mid-stage opponent, he had no confidence.</p><p>His only hope lay with the Void Thunder. Even with a demon beast's robust physique, a direct hit from the Void Thunder would at least inflict severe injuries.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard was unaware of the threat he possessed.  If he could catch it off guard, he might have a chance.  With this thought, Qin Sang clenched his hand, concealing the Void Thunder.</p><p>Instead of immediately unleashing the Corpse Pill, he flicked his wrist, and the Ten Yama King Formation flew from his fingertips.  Ten ghostly banners surrounded him, planting themselves firmly into the ground. After his spiritual power transformation, his strength had increased significantly, surpassing ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.  He could now deploy formations with ease, even without resorting to the Corpse Pill.</p><p>He swallowed several spirit pills and cut a wound on his palm. The gushing blood was devoured by the eagerly awaiting main soul, causing its aura to surge.  Meanwhile, he discreetly palmed the Ten Yama King banners.</p><p>Demons mostly relied on their physical strength. Even if they possessed magical treasures, they were primarily for support. The Ebony Sword’s Bloodfiend Divine Light would likely be ineffective.  In a fierce battle, the Ten Yama King banners would be more useful.  Powerful as it was, the Ten Yama King Formation was still only a set of magical instruments, not comparable to a true treasure.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard glanced at the formation, uninterested.  It looked at Yun Youzi with amusement.  “Old man, you seem to know a lot about the demon race. You even recognize me. If you honestly tell me who dared betray our kind and reveal the location of the Crimson Cloud Fruit, I might grant you a swift death.”</p><p>Having made connections with the Nascent Soul cultivators and knowing a reward awaited him upon his return, Qin Sang was less fixated on obtaining the Crimson Cloud Fruit.  He had been prepared to fail, to abandon the fruit if a powerful enemy appeared. His life was more important.  He hadn’t expected such a smooth journey.  He had easily trapped the Golden Eagle. Yet, just as he was about to succeed, a mid-stage Core Formation Shadow Leopard blocked his path.</p><p>With the panther guarding the single entrance to the stone hall, escape seemed impossible.  Qin Sang was no longer thinking about obtaining the fruit, but about how they could escape with their lives.  If giving up the Crimson Cloud Fruit meant a chance to survive, he wouldn't hesitate.</p><p>He was preparing for battle, about to share his decision with Yun Youzi, when he received a mental message from the older cultivator. His eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>“A mere beast dares to threaten me?” Yun Youzi scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. Such words from a Foundation Establishment cultivator directed at the Shadow Leopard seemed ludicrous. They would have been more fitting coming from a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>As expected, the Shadow Leopard was enraged.  Killing intent flashed in its eyes.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”  The Shadow Leopard crouched, then vanished.</p><p>In an instant, its presence, both physical and spiritual, disappeared from Qin Sang and Yun Youzi’s perception. They had no idea where it had gone.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart lurched. He immediately commanded his main soul to raise its weapon.</p><p>A fierce wind arose, whipping the calm lake into waves.  Nine Nether Demon Fire materialized into a fire dragon, enveloping Qin Sang without a gap.</p><p>All of this happened in a split second. Just as Qin Sang summoned the Nine Nether Demon Fire, he heard Yun Youzi roar, "Get out!"</p><p>A loud bang echoed. The walls of the stone hall glowed brightly, the light converging into a beam that shot down from the ceiling, striking the empty space in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang squinted against the blinding light and saw a dark shape being blasted out of the void. It was the Shadow Leopard, crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang was drenched in cold sweat.  The panther's speed was terrifying. It had been mere inches away from him in an instant, and even more frighteningly, he hadn't sensed its approach.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard bounced off the ground, seemingly unharmed. But its eyes were wide, its body poised to strike, reverting to the primal instincts of a wild beast.  It roared in rage and disbelief, “How can you control the blood restriction left by our King? Who are you?!”</p><p>The King it referred to could only be the Demon King of the Heavenly Demon Ridge.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yun Youzi in astonishment.  He had been skeptical of Yun Youzi’s message, but the evidence was undeniable.  A blood restriction left by a Transformation stage demon, controlled by Yun Youzi! Even though he had only activated a portion of its power, Yun Youzi's mastery of restriction formations was unfathomable.</p><p>Yun Youzi ignored the panther’s question.  His hands moved in a series of intricate gestures, sending streams of energy into the Flawless Pearl. The pearl shone brilliantly, activating numerous restrictions on the walls of the stone hall.</p><p>The hall became increasingly bright as more and more light converged on the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>The panther stared at the Flawless Pearl, a sense of foreboding washing over it.  It had thought it could easily dispose of these two "playthings," but it now sensed a threat, something it found both absurd and unreal.  Yet, the feeling emanating from the Flawless Pearl was undeniable, leaving it completely baffled.</p>
