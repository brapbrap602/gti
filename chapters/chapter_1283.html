<h1>Chapter 1275: Purification</h1><p>Chapter 1275: Purification</p><p>Jingyu was deeply protective of her child.</p><p>She asked Qin Sang to name the chick, hoping to maintain their connection.</p><p>But even though Qin Sang was no ordinary person, she didn't want her child to become someone's mount, controlled against its will.</p><p>In comparison, the position of a mountain guardian beast was more akin to an honorary elder, with far fewer restrictions. It only needed to appear when the mountain gate was in danger.</p><p>She had thoroughly investigated Qin Sang's background, learning that he had only recently formed his golden core.  He possessed such strong power at this relatively early stage that his future was limitless; who would dare to provoke Qingyang Temple?</p><p>Such a situation was unlikely to happen.</p><p>As long as it didn't interfere with its cultivation, and it could receive offerings from Qingyang Temple, it was perfectly acceptable.</p><p>Jingyu's suggestion aligned perfectly with Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially worried that Jingyu, after enjoying freedom for so long, wouldn't want to be tied down. Seeing her lack of resistance, he nodded silently, saying,  "It's a bit of an imposition to ask you to be the mountain guardian beast, friend. If you don't wish to return to Wuyagu, you could establish your domain in the Qianshan Bamboo Sea. As a human cultivator, I previously concealed my identity with secret techniques, but now that it's exposed, future involvement will be inconvenient. Once I establish Qingyang Temple, I will invite you to become an honorary elder. What do you think?"</p><p>Then, Qin Sang briefly explained Yunyouzi's origins and their relationship to Jingyu.</p><p>Jingyu was astonished.  "You and the senior Bamboo Demon have such a connection! I've long heard of the senior's illustrious name, but it's such a pity!  Very well, I will watch over the Qianshan Bamboo Sea for you from now on!"</p><p>Jingyu readily agreed, but she absolutely refused to be the ruler of the Qianshan Bamboo Sea; the demons there would continue to serve Qin Sang.</p><p>The relationships were complicated, but fortunately they had reached a satisfactory resolution.</p><p>Having successfully persuaded Jingyu to stay, Qin Sang was quite pleased.</p><p>Qin Sang, carrying out Yunyouzi's last wishes, would establish Qingyang Temple, but he himself needed to travel and search for fragments of the Killing Sword.  The newly founded sect had a weak foundation and could easily fail; with Jingyu's protection, he could rest easy.</p><p>The chick, seeing the matter resolved and its mother unaffected, was overjoyed.</p><p>Having followed Qin Sang for many years, it had long been completely loyal to Qin Sang, and considered becoming its master not to be a hardship.  Since its mother had decided, it could only obey.</p><p>"Chilei, go to the Qianshan Bamboo Sea and send a message to Sandie Pass, ordering Baihe, Baimiao, Lao Maohou and Liuyiao to return to the Qianshan Bamboo Sea to await my instructions," Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and, in front of Jingyu, unceremoniously ordered the chick.</p><p>Seeing its mother merely smiling at it, the chick immediately took its leave.</p><p>…</p><p>The cave's restriction was triggered again.</p><p>This time, it was Elder Xun from Yuanshen Sect.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Qin!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge, Elder Xun quickly performed a grand bow.</p><p>After returning from Wuyagu, Qingjun had summoned his disciples and publicly announced Qin Sang's true identity.</p><p>The entire Yuanshen Sect was shocked to learn that the mysterious Elder Qin was already a Yuan Ying master. Although Qingjun explained that Qin Sang was only temporarily residing in Yuanshen Sect, they were still incredibly surprised.</p><p>"Senior Qin, these are the spiritual materials you requested. I personally gathered them all."</p><p>Elder Xun presented a pouch.  Qin Sang scanned it with his spiritual sense and confirmed that it contained all the materials needed for the formation, all complete.</p><p>After obtaining the materials, Qin Sang called Jingyu and, through the Yuanshen Sect's forbidden area, went to the core of the mountain's spirit vein – also the heart of the sect's protective formation.</p><p>He borrowed the jade tablet controlling the formation from Qingjun, activated it, and entered the cave.  The spiritual energy was overwhelming and refreshing. The environment felt far from dark or oppressive.</p><p>Soon, they saw a spirit lake formed by the spirit vein, their destination.</p><p>Only he and Qingjun could enter this place within the entire Yuanshen Sect.</p><p>Outsiders could not possibly break in, so there was no need to worry about the Corpse Flower Blood Jade being stolen.</p><p>"Friend, what do you think of this place?"</p><p>Without damaging the spirit vein, Qin Sang carefully used his Golden Sinking Sword to carve a platform on the lake bottom and turned to ask.</p><p>Jingyu examined the surroundings and sensed it for a while before shaking her head.  "This spirit vein's quality isn't top-tier.  To purify the Corpse Flower Blood Jade here would likely take more than ten years, possibly up to twenty."</p><p>"Another ten years is acceptable,"</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, sighing.  "The world's spiritual energy is thin now; no spirit vein can compare to those of antiquity. Yuanshen Sect is a top sect in Xiao Han Region, and throughout Beichen Realm, few spirit veins surpass this one."</p><p>Those prominent sects, even if they didn't covet the Corpse Flower Blood Jade, certainly wouldn't damage their own spirit veins to help others purify pills.</p><p>Tianyao Hill was considered a remote area. Yunyouzi held a high position among the demons, but the Qianshan Bamboo Sea's spirit vein was not as good as Yuanshen Sect's.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's biggest challenge yet.</p><p>The best spirit veins in Beichen territory were all claimed.  To ensure the sect's prosperity, a top-tier spirit vein was essential.  The question was: where to build the Qingyang Temple?</p><p>After selecting a location, Qin Sang opened his pouch and took out the materials.</p><p>The two worked together, embedding the materials into the spirit lake.  The outline of a spirit array quickly appeared.</p><p>"Qin Daoyou, put in the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper,"</p><p>Jing Yu said.</p><p>With a flash of the Qianjun ring, three jade boxes flew out.</p><p>As agreed, Qin Sang received three.</p><p>These three Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers varied in size and shape, but their texture resembled amber. The spirit flowers within shone vibrantly, seemingly frozen at their most beautiful moment.</p><p>The blood essence enhanced their already striking beauty.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers flew into the spirit lake.</p><p>Jing Yu's hand seals changed rapidly as he quickly added the last few materials into the array, completing the secret technique.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A light flowed across the lake bottom.</p><p>The spirit array vanished, replaced by a vibrant green plant.  Its white, flexible roots clung tightly to the platform. The slender stem grew rapidly before their eyes, branching out and leafing until it became a small tree, eventually blossoming three flowers—the Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers Qin Sang had just added.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers appeared to grow naturally on the plant, flawless.</p><p>Spirit pearls shimmered in the lake, manifestations of the array's power.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the plant, waiting patiently until a faint trace of blood red appeared on the white roots.  It was barely visible to the naked eye.  The red gradually merged into the lake, quickly dissipating.</p><p>This was the plant's function: using the power of the spirit vein, it slowly cleansed the Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers of their toxic essence without diminishing their potency. The toxins spread into the lake, and the spirit vein, possessing a powerful self-purifying ability, would soon restore itself to normal.</p><p>They confirmed the secret technique's effectiveness.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jing Yu both breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers were extremely rare.  Even Jing Yu was using this method for the first time. Luckily, their clan's ancient knowledge was accurate.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang then deployed several small triangular flags, planting them around the plant.</p><p>This was a protective array Qin Sang had prepared.</p><p>Ripples spread across the water's surface as the triangular flags glowed brightly, then transformed into a protective dome, covering the entire platform and the plant, which then disappeared from sight.</p><p>They returned the same way, planning to retrieve the medicine in twenty years.</p>
