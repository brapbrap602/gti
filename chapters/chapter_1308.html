Chapter 1300: The Withered Essence Pill

*Whoosh!*

A figure sped through the air—it was none other than Old Freak Feng, who had sensed something amiss. His speed was astonishing as he rapidly closed the distance.

At this moment, his appearance had drastically changed. He no longer resembled a human. Eagle wings, snake scales, deer antlers, and a leopard tail adorned his body. Though his facial features remained, they were distorted, making him look utterly terrifying.

Seeing Old Freak Feng in this monstrous form, many cultivators were struck with fear, their faces paling. They couldn’t tell whether he was a man or a demon.

Little did they know, this was a result of a secret suturing technique Old Freak Feng had cultivated. From the very beginning of his training, he had fused parts of demonic beasts into his own body, forging a monstrous form. As his cultivation advanced and he reached the Nascent Soul stage, the demonic parts within him evolved, making his monstrous body even more powerful.

His true name was Feng Xuegan, and it was precisely because of this technique that he had earned the nickname "Old Freak."

Transformed into this demonic form, Old Freak Feng exuded an aura of ferocity, his eyes filled with malice and a terrifying killing intent as he glared at Qu Huan.

"Old Freak Feng's monstrous body has grown even more bizarre. While its power has increased, it seems that fusing too many chaotic elements into his flesh has hindered his cultivation progress for years. No wonder he’s been consuming so many Withered Essence Pills. Unfortunately, he’ll have to return them all," Qu Huan remarked with a light chuckle, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

Despite being on the verge of being surrounded by two Nascent Soul experts, Qu Huan showed no fear, his expression one of calm confidence.

The cultivator surnamed Qi, however, narrowed his eyes in suspicion. After staring at Qu Huan for a moment, he suddenly raised his hand and unleashed a claw-shaped shadow.

The claw shadow shot toward Qu Huan without hesitation. As it passed, the air around it distorted, radiating a scorching heat. The claw itself glowed a fiery red, as if molten lava flowed within it.

A blazing gust of wind swept through.

Qu Huan dared not face the claw shadow head-on and swiftly retreated.

At that moment, Old Freak Feng, who had been rapidly closing in, suddenly vanished. In the next instant, he reappeared behind Qu Huan, raising his claws—now fused with some unknown beast—and ruthlessly plunged them into Qu Huan's body.

*Rip!*

The claws tore out a spine with brutal force.

Qu Huan's eyes widened in shock, his body stiffening before being torn to pieces by Old Freak Feng. Flesh and bone fragments scattered in all directions.

It seemed Qu Huan was beyond saving.

Yet, instead of celebrating, Old Freak Feng and the cultivator surnamed Qi were filled with rage.

"Hmph!"

Old Freak Feng spat out a dark light, which swept away Qu Huan's remains and the invisible poison lingering in the air. His monstrous form leaped gracefully, landing on the city wall like a hunting leopard, his gaze fixed on the Lotus Formation.

At that moment, figures descended from the sky, landing beside them. They were the other Nascent Soul cultivators who had returned after failing to catch the Old Demon Ye.

While Canghong Zhenren and Qiuzhi Xianzi still had the strength to pursue, the others had no choice but to return.

Like Old Freak Feng, they had failed to intercept Qu Huan's true body.

"Even in the face of disaster, you’re still scheming against each other. A bunch of fools who don’t know their own mortality!" Qu Huan's mocking laughter echoed from outside the city.

It turned out that Qu Huan had prepared an escape route before making his move. When his sneak attack on the cultivator surnamed Qi failed, he sensed danger and immediately fled Yu City.

Fortunately, he acted swiftly. Had he hesitated even a moment longer, he would have been surrounded by the Nascent Soul experts, and no matter how capable he was, escape would have been impossible.

Qu Huan continued to taunt them.

"Kill him!"

Enraged, several cultivators, including Old Freak Feng, chased after him.

Qu Huan knew too many secrets of the Sin Abyss. If the Two Realms Alliance were to extract all the information from him, they would be in a dire position.

The cultivator surnamed Qi, in particular, was seething with humiliation.

The betrayal of Old Demon Ye and the ensuing massacre had plunged the situation into chaos, marking the most critical moment for the Sin Abyss. Under such circumstances, the presence of a traitor was absolutely unacceptable.

They had set a small trap, never expecting to uncover a high-ranking traitor. Yet, he had managed to escape.

"Qu has been lurking for so long and achieved such a high position, which shows just how cunning he is. Capturing him won’t be easy. Forcing him out into the open is already a success. Fellow Daoist Qi, don’t be too hard on yourself. Quickly deploy the city’s defenses and stabilize morale. If we work together, we will surely overcome this crisis!"

A beautiful female cultivator stepped forward, her voice gentle as she comforted the cultivator surnamed Qi.

The cultivator surnamed Qi nodded, his expression calming. He then asked, "Did Canghong Zhenren and Qiuzhi Xianzi not return? Did you fail to catch Old Demon Ye?"

The female cultivator’s expression darkened as she sighed. "Even severely injured, Old Demon Ye’s speed far surpassed ours. We were quickly left behind. Moreover, some of our fellow Daoists are suffering increasingly severe backlash, making it difficult to suppress. Fearing that Old Demon Ye might take advantage, Canghong Zhenren ordered us to return while they continued the pursuit."

As she spoke, her gaze shifted to the side, where several Nascent Soul cultivators sat in meditation.

Among them, a handsome young man stood out the most.

His black hair and beard were visibly turning gray, and wrinkles were beginning to creep across his face. His skin lost its luster, and in just a short while, he seemed to have aged decades.

During this process, his aura fluctuated wildly, and his vitality, essence, and spirit were all waning.

Their condition was somewhat similar to Old Freak Feng’s earlier state, though the severity varied.

Even though he had witnessed Old Freak Feng’s backlash earlier, seeing a similar scene now made the cultivator surnamed Qi’s hair stand on end. He couldn’t help but feel grateful that he hadn’t consumed any Withered Essence Pills.

"Where is Old Demon Ye trying to escape to?" the cultivator surnamed Qi asked, steadying his mind.

"Before we returned, we saw Old Demon Ye fly into the Heavenly Scar. Unless something unexpected happens, his destination is likely the Abyssal Ruins," the female cultivator replied gravely.

"Could it be…" The cultivator surnamed Qi’s eyes widened in shock. "Is he trying to open the Palace of Sin?"

Since its discovery, the Palace of Sin had always been synchronized with the Purple Palace.

It was certain that the Purple Palace’s emergence was not yet due. Unless Old Demon Ye was attempting to forcibly open the Palace of Sin.

"The root of all this lies in the demon that Old Demon Ye and Canghong Zhenren jointly killed within the Palace of Sin. Though we can’t fathom how Old Demon Ye managed it or what his intentions are, everything he’s done is undoubtedly connected to the Palace of Sin. His understanding of the Palace surpasses everyone else’s."

The female cultivator seemed to recall something, a flicker of regret crossing her face.

"Old Demon Ye, severely injured and having committed such atrocities, can only hope to survive by fleeing into the Palace of Sin. He wouldn’t dare do this unless he had planned it long ago and was confident in his escape. It’s a pity we were all blind to it for so many years."

Her words carried a tone of doubt regarding Canghong Zhenren’s ability to stop Old Demon Ye.

Noticing her unease, the cultivator surnamed Qi comforted her, "These are just our speculations. Old Demon Ye may not possess such capabilities. Canghong Zhenren will soon send word. For now, defending Yu City is our top priority."

...

At the same time, Qin Sang and the others were charging through the formation.

The Lotus Formation was composed of multiple layers of restrictions, each petal representing a barrier. To enter Yu City, they had to break through these layers one by one.

Now, they had realized that Yu City was vulnerable, presenting a rare opportunity. No longer holding back, they unleashed their full strength, breaking through half of the restrictions in a short time.
