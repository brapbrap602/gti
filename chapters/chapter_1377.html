<h1>Chapter 1369: Charting a Course</h1><p>Chapter 1369: Charting a Course</p><p>The jade Buddha remained unresponsive to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the unwavering Buddha light, helpless.  He recalled his three visits to the Purple Micro Palace, finding no anomaly in the jade Buddha.</p><p>“Sword spirit…”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the living being he'd brought back from the Purple Micro Palace—the Killing Sword's spirit! The spirit possessed independent consciousness and might know the palace's secrets. Perhaps its knowledge could shed light on the jade Buddha's origin.  This thought made Qin Sang even more eager to find the Killing Sword fragments and awaken the spirit.</p><p>…</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley, a cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, slowly opening his eyes.  His true essence pulsed gently before settling, his entire being radiating a deep, calm aura.</p><p>“Mmm, my cultivation is stable.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his dantian, his expression not one of self-satisfaction, but seriousness.  “There are no shortcuts ahead.  Self-cultivation is truly arduous.  Actually, my cultivation speed isn't slow. No wonder Great Cultivators are so rare…”</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't rush.  A period of travel wouldn't hurt; he was still young after all.  His first Heavenly Tribulation was still over two hundred years away.  With his current cultivation, the first tribulation wouldn't be a concern; there was no need to hurry.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang realized that to rapidly improve, he couldn’t rely solely on arduous cultivation. He needed to focus on other abilities.</p><p>For years, his dedicated cultivation had left him little time for the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and *Celestial Demon Transformation*, both of which were stagnant. The *Celestial Demon Transformation* was far from reaching the mid-fourth stage. After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang had mostly neglected *Celestial Demon Transformation*, resulting in exceptionally slow progress.  He could resume body refinement later.</p><p>However, Qin Sang planned to prioritize the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, aiming to break through to the second stage as soon as possible. The cultivation technique described a significant boost to spiritual sense upon reaching the second stage—an obvious advantage. His spiritual sense wasn't weak already.  Optimistically, breaking through would allow for spiritual sense embodiment, reaching a level comparable to Great Cultivators!</p><p>Even Mu Lao Mo, with only two layers at most, had escaped the siege of righteous and demonic cultivators and feigned death under the watchful eyes of a fragment of the ancient demon soul – a testament to his powerful spiritual sense.  </p><p>Qin Sang's ambitions were far greater.  Cultivating spirit, energy, and essence would aid his Nascent Soul cultivation and would undoubtedly be beneficial in breaking through to the next realm, and even reaching the Divine Transformation stage.</p><p>Solid foundations, built step by step, would lead to a powerful breakthrough.  And he had the resources to do so!</p><p>With his future cultivation path planned, Qin Sang summoned the Fire Lotus Seed.  The seed felt solid.  It required continued refinement of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to achieve a qualitative change and breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang took out his demon banner and attempted to refine the demon fire.  He was surprised to find the speed faster than in his early Nascent Soul stage, significantly reducing the time needed.</p><p>Without anyone to learn from, Qin Sang couldn't say how long it would take to see results.  He could refine the demon fire while traveling, without being confined to his cave dwelling.</p><p>After refining a wisp of demon fire, Qin Sang contentedly ended his cultivation and then attempted the *Celestial Demon Transformation*.  His improved realm would help body refinement, but it would require dedicated cultivation. The breakthrough would surely take much longer than the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned his treasures, the Cloud Touring Sword and the Solar God Tree.</p><p>The Cloud Touring Sword showed no change, remaining in its sword embryo form.  Qin Sang carefully probed it with his spiritual sense, perceiving a faint wisp of true spirit. After careful examination, he sighed.</p><p>After all these years, he sensed no growth in the true spirit.  Imbuing a spirit and forging a spirit treasure was truly a long and arduous process!  Qin Sang wasn't sure whether he would reach the late Nascent Soul stage or the sword's advancement first.</p><p>“As long as I can successfully nurture the senior's true spirit, it's worth the wait.”</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the sword embryo, then turned to the Solar God Tree.</p><p>The changes to the Solar God Tree were remarkable.  The moment he took out the treasure, the entire cave dwelling was illuminated, bathing Qin Sang in a reddish glow.  The Solar God Tree was entirely crimson, brighter than before, like a ball of fire, increasingly resembling the legendary Fusang Divine Tree. The air around the tree warped, radiating intensely scorching fluctuations.</p><p>For now, Qin Sang wouldn't attempt to subdue the Nanming Li Fire with the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, nor was there a need.  He would wait until he refined the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's focus was on the power of the flames contained within the nine flower buds on the Solar God Tree.</p><p>Unlike its previous form, the flames now coalesced into a dark red, contained mass.  Less dazzling, but far more imposing.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully cradled the Sun God Tree, examining it for a long time.</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  The artifact remained under his control, transforming as he'd anticipated.</p><p>Once these flames reach their peak density, forming nine divine birds, the artifact and the Southern Ming Li Fire will stabilize, ready for his use.</p><p>The Sun God Tree should complete its transformation even before Yun Youzi's, its power highly anticipated!</p><p>With these treasures in hand, facing powerful enemies or engaging in magical duels will hold no fear.  He no longer needs to exhaust himself searching for other artifacts; he can focus on cultivation, and on finding the fragments of the Killing Sword and the Conduction Platform.</p><p>Putting away the artifact, Qin Sang summoned his three spirit insects and Ya Gu.</p><p>The Fire Melting Pill provided a constant supply, the Fire Jade Centipede feasting heartily. It broke through to the mid-third stage twenty years ago, with the late-stage within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately, without a significant stroke of luck, the Fire Jade Centipede's advancement is unlikely.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly's potential vastly surpasses the Fire Jade Centipede, but its growth is far too slow.</p><p>Having experienced the benefits of his own spirit insects, Qin Sang naturally wanted to improve the Sky Eye Butterfly as quickly as possible. He'd tried everything, to little effect.</p><p>This trip to the North Sea Three Realms will include searching for advanced insect control techniques.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was fast asleep.  Qin Sang valued it no less than the Sky Eye Butterfly, but this creature was even more demanding.  Once its supply of poisonous algae fruit is gone, it will have to endure hunger.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm is Ya Gu's spirit insect, creating a layer of separation between it and Qin Sang.  Helping it advance remains a complete mystery to him; he can only proceed step by step.</p><p>Qin Sang snapped his fingers, awakening the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, forgetting all discomfort at the sight of food, devoured a poisonous algae fruit, flipped onto its back, and promptly fell back asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, his gaze settling on Ya Gu.</p><p>Following Bai's guidance, Qin Sang inscribed several more bone curses on Ya Gu's arm. Whether due to the bone curses or to the shared slumber with her spirit insect, Ya Gu seemed to have benefited somehow.</p><p>Ya Gu's condition was steadily improving.  Her breath was even, her cheeks flushed.  Except for her sleep, she was indistinguishable from a healthy person.</p><p>Even more astonishing, seven-colored light surrounded Ya Gu's spirit, forming a luminous cocoon that enveloped her, adding an air of mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand the light's function.  Undoubtedly, the changes stemmed from the Fat Silkworm.  He just didn't know if it was due to the Silkworm's unique abilities or to its having willingly submitted to Ya Gu's will.</p>
