<h1>Chapter 506: Green Cicada Coins</h1><p>Based on Wushang's experience, using both Earthly Yin and Heavenly Yang energies for Core Formation requires a living nascent soul to withstand the immense impact.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained Priest Jiupao's nascent soul a year ago.  It has nine years left before losing its vitality due to being separated from its body.</p><p>If he wants to try Wushang's method, he must do it within these nine years. Otherwise, he'll have to find another nascent soul or demon core.</p><p>Dealing with Priest Jiupao was already difficult; other Nascent Soul cultivators would be even more challenging.</p><p>The next nine years might be his only opportunity. Once the Purple Subtlety Palace matter is resolved and the spiritual tide recedes, the four Nascent Soul elders of the Azure Yang Sect will return to their sect and likely won't leave.</p><p>Although Qin Sang used Wushang's Core Formation method, he doesn't want to become a living corpse. Therefore, a living nascent soul and Heavenly Yang energy are essential.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked deeply at Qin Sang. "It seems you've thought this through… But have you considered that even if we are fully prepared and manage to deal with the remaining Nascent Soul cultivator, what about the Azure Yang Sect's protective formation? This formation was personally set up by the founding ancestor of the Azure Yang Sect, who spent decades on it. It has protected the sect until this day. Although the Azure Yang Sect has declined, other demonic sects have never dared to attack them, largely due to this formation."</p><p>Qin Sang had been undercover in the Azure Yang Market for so long that he had thoroughly investigated the Azure Yang Sect.  He was well aware of the sect's formidable protective formation.</p><p>It was said that when the last Infant Transformation elder of the Azure Yang Sect passed away and other demonic sects learned of this, two Infant Transformation cultivators joined forces to attack. The Azure Yang Sect was in imminent danger.</p><p>The newly appointed sect leader, only a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, didn't seek external help.  He simply activated the formation and successfully defended the sect, forcing the two Infant Transformation cultivators to retreat empty-handed.</p><p>After the two cultivators left, they remained tight-lipped about the battle.</p><p>Since then, the Azure Yang Sect's protective formation gained widespread notoriety.</p><p>Such a powerful formation couldn't be broken through by Qin Sang and a hundred Yun Youzis combined. That was precisely why Yun Youzi asked this question.</p><p>The Azure Yang Sect's protective formation posed the biggest obstacle.</p><p>Without access to the sect, everything was futile.</p><p>"We need to find a way for us to get in…"</p><p>Yun Youzi paced back and forth, racking his brains to help Qin Sang, but found it extremely difficult. "Now that the situation in the Cloudmire Great Marsh has stabilized, the various sects are no longer as tense as before, but they won't relax their vigilance either. Especially after the Azure Yang Sect leader left, they will definitely be even more cautious and won't easily allow outsiders into the mountain. Unless, little brother, you know someone close to the Azure Yang Sect who can bring us in. Once inside, we can find a way to avoid their eyes and infiltrate the inner sect…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Don't worry, senior. I've thought of a way, and there's a good chance it will work. If it fails, we'll think of something else.  And you don't need to infiltrate the Azure Yang Sect with me. I'd like to ask you to take a Green Cicada Coin to Boundless Valley…"</p><p>Qin Sang took two copper coins out of his storage pouch.</p><p>The two coins were of different sizes. The smaller one fit perfectly inside the larger one.</p><p>When the two coins were put together, one could see a large and a small green cicada insect engraved on them, a mother and a child, lifelike and detailed.</p><p>The mother was on the outside, the child within.</p><p>These Green Cicada Coins were special artifacts, refined using the blood of green cicada insects.  The mother's blood was applied to the mother coin, and the child's blood to the child coin.</p><p>Two cultivators, one holding the mother coin and the other the child coin.</p><p>When the holder of the child coin crushes it and activates the insect blood with spiritual energy, the mother coin senses it and generates a new child coin.</p><p>Of course, the distance between the two coins was limited, though the range was quite far. Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, one in the Azure Yang Sect and the other in Boundless Valley, could still sense each other.</p><p>The function of Green Cicada Coins was somewhat similar to the Heart-Linking Pendants Yun Youzi gave them in Western Wasteland Town, but not as versatile. They couldn't transmit messages, but they could also bypass various restrictions and formations.</p><p>As long as they were within a certain range, crushing the child coin would activate the mother coin.</p><p>The advantage was that Green Cicada Coins had a wider range than Heart-Linking Pendants and unlike them,  the child coin could regenerate before the mother's blood was depleted, allowing for multiple uses.</p><p>Find authorized novels in Webnovel，faster updates, better experience，Please click <a href="https://www.webnovel.com/book/martial-world_12172164305267805/chapter-506_38678580020501598">www.webnovel.com/book/martial-world_12172164305267805/chapter-506_38678580020501598</a> for visiting.</p><p>Green cicadas were spiritual insects.  Although not as rare as fire jade centipedes, they were still quite uncommon.</p><p>This Green Cicada Coin wasn't refined by Qin Sang. It was a trophy he obtained during his fierce battle with the Heavenly Alliance in the Chaotic Isles.  Finding its use unique, he kept it.</p><p>The coin had been used multiple times, and the mother's blood was running low, with only three or four uses remaining.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the mother coin to Yun Youzi and kept the child coin for himself. "The Azure Yang Sect is very close to Boundless Valley. Most of their disciples train there.  Once I crush the child coin, I'd like you to find a way to cause some trouble for the Azure Yang Sect disciples and divert their attention. If you can lure the Nascent Soul cultivator out of the sect, even better."</p><p>Qin Sang had faith in Yun Youzi's abilities.</p><p>His artifact, the Flawless Pearl, was quite extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the Flawless Pearl's power increased with Yun Youzi's cultivation. When Yun Youzi was only at mid-stage Core Formation, the pearl was already quite remarkable, and it must be even more potent now.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that this wasn't the full extent of Yun Youzi's strength.</p><p>Infiltrating the Fiend Mountain unscathed, Qin Sang found him increasingly unfathomable.</p><p>Qin Sang reckoned that without using the Flying Celestial Yaksha, he wasn't entirely confident in defeating Yun Youzi.</p><p>The Azure Yang Sect's Core Formation disciples were certainly no match for Yun Youzi.  This task could only be entrusted to him.  Mu Yifeng and Senior Brother Rong were not up to the task.</p><p>The most reliable choice would be Qi Yuanshou, but Qin Sang had no opportunity to ask, and Qi Yuanshou would definitely question him thoroughly and never allow him to fall into the path of the undead.</p><p>Yun Youzi took the Green Cicada Coin, clearly disapproving of Qin Sang's plan, and frowned. "Are you planning to cause chaos in the Azure Yang Sect? How will you escape then?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  "I won't force it unless absolutely necessary.  Luring away the Nascent Soul cultivator is to buy as much time as possible."</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression softened slightly. He pondered,</p><p>"A diversionary tactic…  At that time, with all three Nascent Soul cultivators absent, the Azure Yang Sect will be at its most vulnerable, and they will definitely be extremely vigilant. If I only target their disciples, it would be too obvious, leaving traces. If they discover someone is targeting them, they'll become even more alert. That Nascent Soul cultivator won't fall for it easily unless he's a fool."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "If it's not feasible, we can't force it.  As long as I can distract them, my purpose will be achieved."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, then suddenly his eyes lit up, and he mused, "Don't worry, little brother Qin, I know what to do…"</p>
