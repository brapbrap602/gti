<h1>Chapter 503 Unwilling to Close One's Eyes</h1><p>“You young Daoist, there’s no need to be so polite…”</p><p>The old woman chided Qin Sang, then turned and shouted, “Husband! Husband!  We have another mouth to feed, bring out another bowl of rice…”</p><p>“Where are all these people?”</p><p>From the woodshed, an old man poked his head out, glanced at Qin Sang, his eyes brightening slightly.</p><p>After looking Qin Sang over, he suddenly noticed the mud stains on his leg wrappings. A barely perceptible flicker of disappointment crossed the old man's eyes. He muttered an "oh" and turned back inside.</p><p>The courtyard was very small and dilapidated.</p><p>Such a rundown courtyard was a rare sight in Fairhaven City. Qin Sang, with his keen sense of smell, caught the aroma of food drifting from the woodshed. It was the same coarse grains and vegetable scraps he had eaten at Green Ram Monastery.</p><p>The old couple probably couldn't afford repairs.</p><p>Following the old woman to a small, two-room stone house, Qin Sang noticed the thick layer of thatch covering the wooden door. As soon as it opened, a strong smell of herbal medicine burst out, instantly overpowering the scent of food.</p><p>“Qiuxian, come greet the Daoist Priest.”</p><p>The old woman led out a young child. The child was very thin and frail, with a sallow complexion. Qin Sang could tell at a glance that the child was weak and must be suffering from some illness.</p><p>The room was dim. There was an eight-immortal table, one leg propped up with a stone. On it sat a bowl of dark, steaming medicinal soup, clearly prepared for the child.</p><p>The child was shy and hid behind the old woman, peeking at Qin Sang.  When their eyes met, he quickly ducked back, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>“This child…”</p><p>The old woman affectionately stroked the boy’s head, but didn't scold him. She then addressed Qin Sang, “Qiuxian is my grandson. His parents died young. He’s been frail since childhood, can't stand the wind, and I don’t dare let him go outside.  He’s timid and afraid of strangers.  Alas… Daoist Priest, please sit. Don’t mind the humble fare, it's enough to fill your belly.”</p><p>“I’m not picky,” Qin Sang replied earnestly, sitting down at the table without hesitation.</p><p>Qiuxian only dared to return to the table to take his medicine with his grandmother by his side.</p><p>The dark medicinal soup was difficult for a young child to swallow, but Qiuxian picked up the bowl and quickly drank it all, seemingly unaffected by the bitterness.</p><p>The old man brought out food even coarser than what Qin Sang remembered from Green Ram Monastery, but he ate with gusto, wolfing it down.</p><p>“Don’t rush, eat slowly, there’s more in the pot…”</p><p>The old woman, who wasn't eating herself, watched Qin Sang with a cheerful expression. Suddenly, she said, “Husband, if Qiuxian’s parents hadn't gotten sick, they would be this old now.”</p><p>The old man put down his bowl, reached for his pipe, took a puff, and muttered, “They insisted on practicing some ‘immortal’s diet’ of air and dew. They brought it upon themselves!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eating paused for a moment, then he finished his meal at a faster pace.</p><p>The old woman offered him more, but Qin Sang shook his head and declined. “It's getting late, I still have to travel…”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang glanced at Qiuxian and walked over.</p><p>Qiuxian wasn't as afraid of Qin Sang anymore. Though still a bit timid, he mustered his courage and looked at Qin Sang with bright eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang squatted down, patted Qiuxian's small head, took out a dull yellow jade pendant from his bosom, and hung it around Qiuxian's neck.  “Thank you for your hospitality. This small piece of jade is a humble gift for Qiuxian…”</p><p>Qiuxian had no spiritual roots.</p><p>#Send 888 cash red envelopes# Follow vx public account [Book Friends Base Camp] See popular masterpieces Draw 888 cash red envelopes!</p><p>The pendant was cut from a very unremarkable yellow stone, barely qualifying as jade.  However, Qin Sang had placed a simple restriction on it, not enough to attract the attention of other cultivators, but sufficient to help regulate Qiuxian’s health.</p><p>The child’s illness, incurable by mortal doctors, was something Qin Sang could easily treat.</p><p>The old couple, living with Qiuxian, would also benefit over time.</p><p>“This is too much…”</p><p>The old man quickly put down his pipe.</p><p>The couple only stopped their protests after they saw that it wasn’t a particularly valuable jade pendant.</p><p>Qiuxian played with the pendant, clearly delighted. He suddenly hugged Qin Sang’s leg, then ran off to hide it.</p><p>After further attempts to persuade Qin Sang to stay, the three were seeing him to the door when they suddenly heard hurried footsteps approaching from outside, followed by loud shouts filled with anxious cries.</p><p>“Doctor Wu! Doctor Wu…”</p><p>“It’s Liu’s eldest son!”</p><p>The old woman immediately recognized the voice and suddenly exclaimed, “Could it be Old Master Liu…”</p><p>The old man thought for a moment, then grunted in agreement, his tone flat.  “Most likely. He’s ninety-two, isn’t he?  He probably won’t make it past this.”</p><p>The old woman sighed. “His eldest daughter-in-law is due to give birth any day now, and he didn’t even hold on…”</p><p>“He’s already got five generations under one roof.  What’s there to regret?”  The old man turned and grabbed his thick cotton coat.  “I’ll go see if there’s anything I can do to help.  You stay home and watch Qiuxian. If you hear anything, don’t wait for me for dinner.”</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the courtyard, watching the old man’s hurrying figure. He suddenly knew what he wanted to see.</p><p>…</p><p>The Liu Household.</p><p>Five generations living together, a true extended family.</p><p>Outside Old Master Liu's room, dozens of people, young and old, stood gathered, a stark contrast to the quietness of the old couple's home.</p><p>The crowd outside was solemn, not daring to breathe loudly.  Even the children sensed the gravity of the situation and stood quietly beside the adults, refraining from any mischief.</p><p>The room was silent.</p><p>Doctor Wu hadn’t arrived yet.</p><p>Everyone anxiously waited.</p><p>Just then, shouts came from inside the room.</p><p>“Eldest Daughter-in-law!”</p><p>“Eldest Daughter-in-law! Come in quickly!”</p><p>…</p><p>The women hurriedly helped a heavily pregnant young woman inside.</p><p>An elderly man lay on the bed, his breathing extremely weak.  He was clearly nearing his end, yet he still stubbornly turned his head to look towards the door, his lips moving as if he wanted to say something.</p><p>The eldest daughter-in-law entered, clearly frightened.</p><p>At this point, propriety was disregarded. Those by the bed quickly made way, pulling the eldest daughter-in-law closer.</p><p>The old man's cloudy eyes suddenly brightened, his fingers twitching slightly.  Those around him understood and immediately guided his hand towards the eldest daughter-in-law's belly.</p><p>However, halfway there, his hand went limp.</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>A collective sigh filled the room.</p><p>In a corner of the room, unseen by the mortals present, stood a Daoist priest.</p><p>Qin Sang watched silently, his gaze fixed on the deceased old man's face, on his eyes filled with unwillingness, lost in thought.</p><p>“Ninety-two years old, five generations under one roof, a rarity in the mortal world, yet still unwilling to close his eyes?”</p><p>…</p><p>Old Master Liu had passed away.</p><p>The Liu household was filled with the sounds of weeping and bustling activity.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had already left. He extended his divine sense, sweeping across Fairhaven City, but found nothing. He quickened his pace, leaving the city and heading straight for the capital of the Ancient Abyss Kingdom.</p><p>It was already midday by the time he reached the capital on foot.</p><p>The city had guards, but they posed no obstacle for Qin Sang.</p><p>Entering the city, he was surprised to find that the steamed bun shop he used to frequent was still there, now run by the descendants of the original owner.</p><p>After ordering several baskets of meat buns and devouring them, Qin Sang paid and gestured towards a high pile of snow in the corner next to the shop. "There’s a person in there."</p>
