<h1>Chapter 1986: Trifles</h1><p>A mountain peak pierces the clouds, bathed in bright sunlight.</p><p>Majestic peaks and misty waters stretch far and wide.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the mountainside, and instantly, cracks appeared, rocks tumbled, some forming curious stones, others shaping sheer cliffs.  Then, gushing streams and cascading waterfalls appeared, transforming the mountain into a breathtaking wonderland.</p><p>A gentle breeze scattered grass seeds across the slopes.</p><p>Spiritual energy fell as sweet rain, nourishing the land.</p><p>Tender shoots sprouted from the barren earth, bursting with life.</p><p>Small animals, relocated from elsewhere, startled but quickly captivated by the rich spiritual energy, chirped and scampered excitedly through the mountains.</p><p>The entire scene came alive.</p><p>Qin Sang commanded the elements, effortlessly shaping nature.</p><p>Spiritual beasts gathered, auspicious clouds swirled, dispelling the gloomy aura of the former abyss.</p><p>A ghostly realm transformed into a paradise!</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers flickered, beams of light shooting forth, transforming into flags that plunged into the earth, forming a protective mountain array.</p><p>As the formation completed, a thin mist rose from the ground, obscuring the view. From outside, only a hazy, mysterious and dreamlike landscape could be seen.</p><p>The old cave dwelling of the Old Ancestor of the Dark Falcon was moved to the mountaintop; except for a few murals, almost nothing of the original remained.</p><p>Qin Sang refined the details, highly satisfied, then instructed Ling Shi and the others on how to enter and exit the mountain, ordering them to retrieve the demon soldiers from the previous Daoist compound in the Fire Domain. He then entered the cave dwelling himself, lost in contemplation before the murals.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Qingyang Temple now looked vastly different.</p><p>The mountain supporting the temple had been raised by tens of thousands of feet, becoming the main peak, with the main altar at its summit.</p><p>The surrounding terrain had also been altered, now possessing the grandeur of a great immortal sect.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled spiritual veins, setting up a powerful formation to establish the foundation for Qingyang Temple—a task requiring considerable effort.</p><p>This location had innate deficiencies, unlike the former abyss, but after centuries of cultivation, it could still become a sacred training ground.</p><p>The area below remained unchanged.</p><p>Qi Pai Village, the school, Qinggui Town, Jian County…</p><p>Ordinary people saw no changes; the old temple remained in the mortal realm. Yu Lang would frequently arrange disciples for charitable medical treatments.</p><p>A new temple would be built on the mountaintop, but for now, only a few huts stood there, housing Yu Lang's family.</p><p>Inside one hut, Yu Lang and Taiyi were studying blueprints of their envisioned temple, discussing and making adjustments.</p><p>Tao Teng sat by the door, leaning against the frame, gazing out at the distant landscape.</p><p>From the lofty peak, the view was extraordinarily expansive, showcasing the vast mountains and rivers. The scenery was spectacular.</p><p>Dressed in simple clothes, a blade of grass in his mouth, he appeared listless, a far cry from the powerful general he once was.</p><p>After finalizing a detail, Yu Lang noticed Tao Teng's expression and sighed inwardly, asking, "Have you made your decision?"</p><p>"Will Qingyang Temple accept me?"</p><p>Tao Teng looked up and asked in return.</p><p>"Master said he would no longer concern himself with the temple's affairs. You're homeless; how could I turn you away?"</p><p>Yu Lang walked to the door, looking towards the east, "But you're a personal disciple of the Cloud Immortal Master.  To change your allegiance without his permission… wouldn't that be betraying your master?"</p><p>"Disciple?"</p><p>Tao Teng gave a self-deprecating laugh, a rather cold smile. "Why didn't Master take me away?"</p><p>He didn't know that after the Cloud Immortal Master returned to his mountain and learned the truth, he was shocked, retreating to his secluded abode and never daring to set foot in the mortal realm again.</p><p>Understanding Tao Teng's unresolved feelings, Yu Lang said, "The Cloud Immortal Master taught you the Dao, guided your cultivation. While there might have been some ulterior motives, he had no ill intent towards you. He left you a communication talisman before leaving, showing he did acknowledge you as his disciple. To become a direct disciple of a Nascent Soul cultivator in the Cloud City Heavens... is something countless people only dream of."</p><p>Tao Teng gazed silently at the horizon, then at the lands of Yan, murmuring, "The Cloud City Heavens are too far from the mortal realm."</p><p>Yu Lang sighed inwardly.  "Birds of a feather flock together," he thought; perhaps that was it.</p><p>Tao Teng was his close friend, they shared the same aspirations, and Yu Lang hoped he would stay, but he didn't know which choice would be better for him. Only Tao Teng could decide.</p><p>"You should go meet the Cloud Immortal Master. Taiyi and I will visit the Cloud City Heavens soon; you can come with us," Yu Lang said.</p><p>Tao Teng nodded noncommittally.</p><p>At that moment, a streak of light descended from the mountain below, landing outside the temple. It was Sha Jia Yu.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu first greeted Taiyi respectfully, then handed Yu Lang a jade slip, saying, "While traveling the mortal realm these past few days, I found dozens of exceptionally gifted children. I've placed them in the temple below. You can test them and accept them as disciples."</p><p>The jade slip detailed the children's origins and Sha Jia Yu's assessments—a painstaking effort.</p><p>Yu Lang and Tai Yi exchanged a glance.  "Your tireless efforts have been invaluable in getting everything sorted out so quickly, Brother.  Tai Yi and I both wish to invite you to join the Qingyang Temple. What are your thoughts?  If you wish to revive the Sha family, you could also serve as a guest elder…"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu shook his head. "Do you remember what I said before?  Once you're settled, I'll be leaving on my travels.  It's time for me to go. I came here to say farewell."</p><p>He paused, then hesitated, "I hope you'll look after the Yin family in the future."</p><p>Asking a Foundation Establishment cultivator to protect a family with a Yuan Ying cultivator seemed ludicrous, but Yu Lang's identity as the current head of Qingyang Temple meant even the Cloud City Sect Master wouldn't dare slight him.</p><p>Qingyang Temple oversees the mortal world, without interfering in the immortal cultivation world, yet who would dare ignore them?</p><p>A single word from him would be enough to deter anyone from troubling the Yin family.</p><p>Yu Lang understood Sha Jia Yu's deep concern and felt a great reluctance to see him go. "The Yin family sent a message yesterday, they'll be visiting in three days.  Perhaps you could wait a little longer, Brother."</p><p>He knew that Sha Jia Yu felt guilty about using Nian Hui, and that Nian Hui still harbored feelings for him.</p><p>Lovers separated by circumstance and entangled grievances—a truly regrettable situation.</p><p>A face-to-face conversation might help them resolve their issues and move on.</p><p>"No need!"</p><p>Sha Jia Yu felt ashamed to face Nian Hui, bowed, turned, and soared into the sky on his flying light.</p><p>The light vanished on the horizon.</p><p>Yu Lang thought, "The love, hatred, and grievances of the mortal world are truly tangled and complex. Even cultivators are caught up in them, unable to escape."</p><p>"I wonder if Master can untangle this?"</p><p>"He'll come back once he figures things out, probably within a century," Tai Yi patted Yu Lang's shoulder, left the hut, and walked towards the mountaintop.</p><p>A stone palace had been carved into the peak, housing the main altar—the forbidden grounds of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Tai Yi arrived and saw the palace doors ajar.  His face lit up. He patted non-existent dust off his robes and bowed. "Greetings, Lord Envoy!"</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tai Yi, who had entered, and asked in a low voice, "Are you willing to join the Five Thunder Academy?"</p><p>Tai Yi was shocked, then overjoyed, prostrating himself. "Disciple is willing!"</p><p>After his spiritual awakening, he longed to join the Dao Court.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred, activating the altar. The Five Thunder Envoy's seal within the altar trembled slightly, shooting out a golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice echoed through the stone palace.</p><p>A voice like thunder, resounding with heavenly might.</p><p>"I, the Envoy of the Five Thunder Academy, holding the seal of the Five Thunder Envoy's Office, command the Five Thunder Academy. Today, disciple Tai Yi, having destroyed evil and protected the mortal world, in consideration of your merits, I hereby bestow upon you the rank of From Fourth Rank, Jade Mansion Upper Minister, Five Thunder Envoy!"</p><p>With each word Qin Sang uttered, the golden light vibrated, forming a golden character in mid-air, shining brightly.</p><p>As Envoy of the Five Thunder Academy, he had the authority to confer ranks.  Within the Dao Court, official positions of Fourth Rank and above were appointed by the Nine Heavens Golden Que, so Qin Sang could only bestow the From Fourth Rank.</p><p>In fact, during the Dao Court's peak, Tai Yi's cultivation level wouldn't have qualified him for a From Fourth Rank position; after all, even the Envoy of the Five Thunder Academy was only a Regular Third Rank.</p><p>The final golden character solidified. The golden light flowed, and the imperial decree transformed into a scroll, flying towards Tai Yi.</p><p>Tai Yi's long-cherished wish was fulfilled, he was overcome with emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang was the Envoy of the Five Thunder Academy appointed by the Celestial Master; his imperial decree was the legitimate authority of the Dao Court.  Other Dao Court cultivators would recognize Tai Yi's rank.</p><p>Tai Yi had received a title but no post or duties.  This was because the Five Thunder Academy was more in name than in reality; Qin Sang had no soldiers or officials under his command, no position to give him.</p><p>Qin Sang was still considering whether to establish a government here, build an altar, and teach.  He didn't know when the Dao Court would be revived, the chance of it becoming a proper government was slim.</p><p>"From now on, you will cultivate here. Take these; if you comprehend them thoroughly, your cultivation will greatly improve."</p><p>Qin Sang gave Tai Yi a jade slip and a pouch.  The jade slip contained his insights gained from the thunder altar, and the pouch held various spiritual objects to aid Tai Yi's cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang was preparing for his departure. He planned to leave Tai Yi behind. The two great demon lords must be by his side; if he took Tai Yi with him, the remaining forces would be too weak. Qin Sang wasn't sure when he would find the Dao Court again, and it would be better for Tai Yi to stay and guard Qingyang Temple, using the thunder altar to cultivate, rather than travel with him. Moreover, after Qin Sang left, no one else in Qingyang Temple could control the thunder altar.</p><p>Taiyi, naturally attuned to thunder due to his innate spiritual affinity, could potentially activate the Thunder Oath if he advances to the late Nascent Soul stage and takes up residence at the main altar.  </p><p>While its power wouldn't match Qin Sang's personal control, it should still pose a threat to cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, deterring evil and ensuring regional peace.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang must help Taiyi improve his cultivation.</p><p>Taiyi received the jade slip and was immediately captivated by its contents, completely absorbed in its study.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disturb him, instead summoning Yu Lang for a brief instruction before departing Qingyang Temple and heading north.</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the site of his old dojo, released his aura, and waited.  A purple streak of light swiftly approached.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou bowed slightly, saying, "Since the Panlong Heavenly Pillar is here, let's transfer the other remnants."</p><p>They immediately split up, Qin Sang heading west and Gu Yun Sou east.  Familiar with the location of each relic, Qin Sang reached the westernmost volcanic region of the Fire Domain, where the relic lay beneath a volcano.</p><p>Hovering above the crater, Qin Sang formed his hand into a claw, and with a forceful grasp, the volcano's magma erupted violently.</p><p>Once the eruption subsided, Qin Sang manipulated the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, uprooting several volcanoes.  The relic then slowly rose from the magma.</p><p>This relic was a stone disc larger than any mountain, its edges riddled with gaps, its surface inscribed with countless strange runes emitting the aura of ancient prohibitions.</p><p>After excavating the disc, Qin Sang journeyed north, the colossal disc trailing behind him like a floating mountain.</p><p>One by one, the relics were relocated to the old dojo. Gu Yun Sou, working faster, was already waiting. They secured the relics in the air, their immense shadows blotting out the sun, resembling a meteor shower.</p><p>Below, magma churned as the relics were moved. Qin Sang retrieved the Panlong Heavenly Pillar and inserted it into one of the relics.  </p><p>The core of this relic, destroyed during the battle with the Old Ancestor Ming Hu, had been salvaged by Qin Sang, but it was not an easy task to restore the ancient prohibitions he had transcribed.</p><p>Ignoring the Panlong Heavenly Pillar for now, Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou began to assemble the relics.</p><p>They sat cross-legged in mid-air, communicating through telepathy. While not masters of formations, both possessed unique insights into the Dao of prohibitions.</p><p>Their exchange yielded mutual inspiration, and they gradually began to discern patterns, jointly manipulating one of the relics.</p><p>The relic descended to the ground, settling beside another; the two didn't touch, maintaining a significant gap. But the moment it landed, subtle fluctuations in both relics' prohibitions appeared, resonating with each other.</p><p>This continued with the second, the third, and so on.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, five years had passed.  </p><p>For five years, they remained motionless, manipulating the relics' positions, akin to piecing together a fragmented puzzle.</p><p>When all relics were in place, scattered haphazardly across the landscape, the scene resembled a ruined city ravaged by war and flood.</p><p>Yet, to Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou, these fragments followed a pattern, forming a whole.</p><p>After five years, they moved for the first time, floating to the top of the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>With the relics as a reference, they finally glimpsed the Pillar's secrets.</p><p>After lengthy deliberation, they exchanged a look and flew towards opposite ends of the relics, jointly drawing upon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>The wind and clouds shifted dramatically.</p><p>The ancient prohibitions within the relics were triggered sequentially. Within the fiery hurricane, golden specks suddenly appeared.</p><p>More and more specks emerged, and the relic fragments transformed into gold, coalescing into a single entity.</p><p>A dull sound emanated from the relics. Suddenly, a golden light soared into the sky, and a golden dragon emerged within it.</p><p>To be precise, it was only a dragon-shaped outline.</p><p>This dragon, with formidable horns, lay dormant, its body coiled, poised to ascend to the heavens.</p><p>The relic fragments were part of its body, the golden specks its glittering scales.  Its fragmented form did not diminish its majesty.</p><p>Then, a golden dragon phantom took flight, its claws outstretched, charging towards the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.  </p><p>It coiled around the pillar, its head raised heavenward, its mouth open in a roar.</p><p>Sadly, this awe-inspiring spectacle lasted only a moment before the dragon shadow vanished.</p><p>This dragon phantom, revealing a certain transformation of the Panlong Ancient Array, held the key to its understanding, precisely what Ji Tian Sect required.  Qin Sang had recorded the entire process.</p><p>It would be presented to Ji Tian Sect along with the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou took his leave, saying, "I have an appointment with Daoist Yu of the Gu He Garden; I must depart."</p><p>…</p><p>After seeing Gu Yun Sou off, Qin Sang returned to his new dojo, sealed his cave, and retrieved the Old Ancestor Ming Hu's belongings.</p>
