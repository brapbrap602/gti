<h1>Chapter 310: Spoils of War</h1><p>Chapter 310: Spoils of War</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ice bed in the secluded cave, checking his body. The injuries he sustained in the Qiuhong Market had basically healed and would not affect his cultivation.</p><p>His Qi Sea was still the same.</p><p>He had long been certain that the damage to his foundation was irreversible. He could only hope that the Profound Rune Harmony Pill could resolve this hidden danger.</p><p>By the way, I wonder if the Nine-Flower Frost can cure the Divine Soul of Wanderer.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew from his meditation and looked up at the rough stone ceiling above him, lost in thought for a moment. He reached into his robe and retrieved Luo Xingnan's mustard seed bag.</p><p>Aside from the Blue Dew Lotus, the best two magical artifacts among Ge Yuan's belongings had been given to Shangguan Lifeng. The other miscellaneous items were not worth much.</p><p>The majority of the spoils were here with Luo Xingnan.</p><p>The first one was the silver knife talisman treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the cracks on the talisman treasure and carefully picked it up, sensing the remaining power within it.</p><p>Luo Xingnan had been very decisive. In his last desperate attempt, he had activated the talisman treasure with all his might, causing it to consume a significant amount of its power.</p><p>If the battle was not intense, it could still be used twice sparingly. If the opponent was too strong and the situation reached a stalemate, it would probably be destroyed after one use.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi had been destroyed, and now that he had obtained this silver knife talisman treasure, although it was severely damaged, it made up for some of his losses, which was better than nothing.</p><p>In contrast, Qin Sang felt that the Yin-Yang Compass was the most useful artifact.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Yin-Yang Compass was a superb-grade magical artifact, but its function was very special. Although the compass's yin-yang magnetic light had some defensive power, it was not purely used for killing or defense.</p><p>The compass was made of a strange magnetic stone. As the yin-yang magnetic light transformed, repulsive and attractive forces would appear alternately. The black magnetic light represented repulsion, while the white magnetic light carried attraction, both of which were very powerful, as evidenced by Ge Yuan's demise.</p><p>The yin-yang magnetic light could be controlled at will and manipulated freely, with endless uses.</p><p>Especially in a complex battle situation, it could disrupt the enemy's formation at any time, achieving unexpected effects.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally would not miss out on such an artifact. After a little refinement, he claimed the Yin-Yang Compass as his own. Then, he flicked his finger and knocked a piece of gravel off the stone wall.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Compass's light alternated, and the gravel flipped up and down in the air. At first, it was a little awkward, but he gradually became more proficient.</p><p>After playing with it for a while, Qin Sang retracted the Yin-Yang Compass into his body, where he could constantly nurture it.</p><p>Other than that, Luo Xingnan had some other magical artifacts, none of which were as good as the Yin-Yang Compass. He did not find the jade fork, which had probably been destroyed when he was besieged by the hook snakes. However, the other magical artifacts also had their unique uses. Qin Sang was short on magical artifacts, so he sorted and stored them away.</p><p>Luo Xingnan did not have much spirit stones, only a little over a thousand low-grade spirit stones. After all, he was a loose cultivator, and most of his savings were used to purchase magical artifacts, pills, and talismans to improve his strength.</p><p>Unless he had a fortuitous encounter and made a huge fortune, it would be impossible for him to save up any significant amount.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang took out two jade boxes and placed them in front of him.</p><p>One of the jade boxes contained the Bloodthirsty Mushroom, and the other contained the Blue Dew Lotus.</p><p>Qin Sang had already consulted with Wanderer and learned the effects of these two spiritual medicines.</p><p>Although they were both thousand-year-old spiritual medicines, in terms of value alone, the Bloodthirsty Mushroom definitely surpassed the Blue Dew Lotus. However, for Ge Yuan, the Blue Dew Lotus was a treasure that he refused to trade away.</p><p>This was because the Blue Dew Lotus, when combined with a few other spiritual medicines, could be used to refine a spiritual pill called the Cleansing Dew Pill. The other spiritual medicines required for the Cleansing Dew Pill were also quite valuable, but unlike the Blue Dew Lotus, they were not as rare and could be found with patience.</p><p>If a cultivator who practiced wood-attribute techniques consumed this pill, they could use the power of the pill to refine their spiritual power. When they encountered a bottleneck, it had the effect of aiding in breaking through the barrier.</p><p>This effect was most obvious during the Foundation Establishment stage. It was said that the Cleansing Dew Pill did not help much when it came to forming Golden Cores, but it was still enough to make cultivators covet it.</p><p>The cultivation techniques that others practiced were not like the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter.' They could only break through by comprehending the killing runes. Each time their realm improved, they had to spend a lot of effort breaking through bottlenecks.</p><p>Some cultivators were unlucky and could be stuck at a bottleneck for decades, such as Yu Daiyue.</p><p>If one could cultivate to the Pseudo-Golden Core realm earlier, they would have ample time to prepare for forming Golden Cores, so its significance could not be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang's foundation was laid by the water-attribute technique 'Netherworld Scripture.' The 'Profound Maiden Jade Cauldron Scripture' and 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter' that he had later cultivated were both attributeless techniques, but he still primarily relied on water-attribute spiritual power. Moreover, he did not need the Cleansing Dew Pill to help him break through bottlenecks.</p><p>Therefore, the Blue Dew Lotus was not of much use to him.</p><p>Blue Luodan is a must-have for fellow practitioners of Wood attributed techniques. Ge Yuanzheng practices Wood attributed techniques; thus, he is impatient to obtain the Blue Luodan, yet he is out of luck.</p><p>When the time is right, he will bring it out to exchange for what he needs.</p><p>Qin Sang silently nodded, then moved his gaze from the Blue Luodan to another jade box.</p><p>Di Xue Gui Gu, a hand-sized spirit mushroom, Lingzhi form, the unusual aspect of Di Xue Gui Gu is its color, an extreme blood red!</p><p>The veins crossed on the mushroom body, resembling blood vessels, full of blood, abnormally dense, seemingly as if it would overflow with blood with a slight touch.</p><p>These veins form a ghost-faced pattern on the surface, and paired with its color, it appears as if a blood-thirsty malicious ghost is about to emerge, seeming extraordinarily strange.</p><p>Di Xue Gui Gu is named due to this.</p><p>The value of this herb ranks highest amongst the seven spirit herbs and that's because it can be directly refined and absorbed, aiding the practitioner in improving their cultivation!</p><p>Furthermore, Di Xue Gui Gu, paired with five other spirit herbs such as Heartless Orchid, can be refined into the spirit herb called Wept Blood Pill, and it also has the effect of advancing the cultivation of Qi Condensation period practitioners!</p><p>However, every other spirit herb similar to Heartless Orchid is no inferior to Di Xue Gui Gu in terms of value, and they are also equally rare, in the current realm of immortal cultivation, completing the medicinal formula for Wept Blood Pill is nearly impossible.</p><p>Unless he meets a Qi Condensation practitioner who is preparing to refine Wept Blood Pill, then he can sell it for a high price.</p><p>Qin Sang's best option is to directly refine it, to advance his cultivation.</p><p>Based on Yun Youzi's analysis, directly refining Di Xue Gui Gu will definitely result in a great loss of medicinal efficacy, the effects will be slightly worse than Mysterious 紋合 Rhyme Pill, but should still be able to save ten years of cultivation time.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Di Xue Gui Gu, his face filled with pondering, and finally decided to hold off on refining this herb for now.</p><p>Whether or not Mysterious 紋合 Rhyme Pill can repair his foundation remains to be seen, if it has no effect, it can only be used to transform into power, to raise his cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation cannot be raised just because he says so, it will also be restricted by the killing talisman, if he used the Di Xue Gui Gu to raise his cultivation base, and he didn't have enough time to comprehend the killing talisman, then the medicinal efficacy of Mysterious 紋合 Rhyme Pill would be wasted.</p><p>Di Xue Gui Gu can be refined at any time, there is no need to rush.</p><p>Waving his hand, he put away the two spirit herbs, Qin Sang again retrieved Luo Xingnan's corpse, Shaoyin Magnetic Bottle, and Five Elements Yin objects, and prepared to refine them into a Corpse Fiend.</p><p>After refining the corpse of a Mid Foundation Establishment practitioner into a Corpse Fiend, it will be on par with Early Foundation Establishment practitioners.</p>
