<h1>Chapter 1173: Celestial Eye Divine Light</h1><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>The sword beams, though seemingly unconnected, each erupted with astonishing sword intent, forming a unified whole within the sword array, resembling the might of heavenly swords.</p><p>The demonic python’s face changed drastically.</p><p>He had witnessed Qin Sang deploying the sword array before, engaging in a brief fight.  The strength displayed then was far weaker than now!</p><p>Last time, the opponent likely held back, knowing they were at fault.</p><p>The Qieji Demon King realized he had miscalculated, underestimating his opponent. Even among humans, achieving such mastery in swordsmanship was exceedingly rare.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>The sword intent shook the heavens.</p><p>The demonic python roared, its scales rattling, a layer of black luster swirling as its body contorted abnormally, the surrounding area filled with chaotic energy.</p><p>The sword array's power was disrupted.</p><p>However, the sword array enveloped not only its true form; sword energy like a silver river descended from the heavens, accompanied by earth-shattering sword cries, engulfing two illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang's perception was correct; the demonic python illusions' combat power was not to be underestimated, they weren't mere phantoms, but the two illusions lacked the formidable defense of the true body.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Before the illusions could truly unleash their power, they were torn apart, shattering like mirrors into countless fragments that danced in the air.</p><p>Each fragment reflected the sword shadows and the demonic python's enraged eyes.</p><p>The demonic python broke free from the sword array, attempting to re-form the illusions, but Qin Sang wouldn’t give it the chance. With a single hand movement, a river of sword energy surged towards the demonic python!</p><p>The demonic python was fierce, its eyes flashing menacingly, confronting the sword array with its physical body. Some scales shattered, revealing crimson flesh, but it ignored the pain.</p><p>However, the demonic python miscalculated.  Its shadow clone technique was easily broken, losing its advantage and giving Qin Sang the upper hand.  Recovering the situation would not be so easy.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes remained calm; his true form also charged forward, coordinating with the sword array to deliver heavy blows, giving the demonic python no respite.</p><p>The demonic python made several attempts, but it failed to reconstitute the illusions, instead worsening its plight.</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>The Serpent King watched, witnessing the demonic python’s failing situation.</p><p>But his face showed no anxiety.</p><p>The seemingly defenseless demonic python finally seized its opportunity.</p><p>The python raised its massive body, roaring to the heavens, its fangs bared. From its gaping maw, a black gleam suddenly shot out, breaking through the sword energy blockade with blinding speed, targeting Qin Sang's true form!</p><p>“I knew it wasn't that simple!”</p><p>A sudden change occurred, yet Qin Sang showed no panic.</p><p>Demon Kings, Yuan Ying cultivators—none were simple foes. The Qieji Demon King couldn't possibly be a mere brute relying solely on close combat. Especially in a place like the Xiao Han region, they wouldn't lack treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite satisfied with forcing the Qieji Demon King to reveal a trump card using just the sword array. He decided to stop while he was ahead.</p><p>However, locked onto by the black gleam, Qin Sang felt as if his blood was being drawn by a bone knife, a subtle ache throbbing in his brow.</p><p>“A blade! A bone blade!”</p><p>Qin Sang saw the true form of the treasure.</p><p>The bone blade was only three inches long, lacking a hilt, entirely black, made from an unknown bone, quite eerie, and firmly locked onto Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>The black gleam was like a bottomless pit, absorbing the surrounding black mist while attacking Qin Sang, the bone blade's momentum rising steadily.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be negligent. He retracted his sword and retreated, simultaneously waving his sleeve, sending nine miniature spirit banners, including the three used earlier, spiraling out.</p><p>He was still concealing his strength, wary of the Serpent King.</p><p>Now a Yuan Ying cultivator, in his hands, the nine demon banners were far more potent than before, enough to handle the current situation.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The demon banners grew in the wind, becoming ten-foot-tall banners.</p><p>With a series of *bang* sounds, the nine demon banners were planted in the ground, forming a large array, and demonic fire erupted, instantly engulfing Qin Sang in a sea of flames.</p><p>The black mist around him, upon encountering the demonic fire, was like meeting its nemesis, instantly swept away.</p><p>The bone blade struck next.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally commanded the demonic fire to condense into a fireball, colliding with the bone blade without deviation.</p><p>A deafening boom echoed.</p><p>The fireball shattered, scattering burning embers, but as expected, it successfully blocked the bone blade's attack.</p><p>The bone blade was hindered, the black gleam momentarily dispersing, allowing a glimpse of the bone blade’s true form, faintly pulsating in midair.</p><p>On the bone knife itself, there were faint golden threads, barely visible to the naked eye, forming strange runes.  The artifact was ancient and looked like a relic.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to use magic to re-form the demonic fire when he noticed the demonic python moving.</p><p>Suddenly, the demonic python used some unknown power, and a gigantic black python phantom materialized behind it.  This phantom was several times larger than the real python, comparable in size to a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the phantom, confirming it wasn't a manifestation of magical power, yet it still felt threatening.</p><p>The next moment, the giant python phantom opened its eyes.  Its eyes were enormous, like stars in the sky.  The phantom let out a silent roar, its eyes blazing brightly as it unleashed two beams of light, targeting the bone knife!</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang wore a confident expression. Qin Sang's strength was beyond expectation, but the python phantom was his strongest ability, and the bone knife was a borrowed treasure from his father-in-law. The combination of the two, even if it couldn't severely injure Qin Sang, was enough to force him from the battlefield.</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The moment the python's eyes unleashed their beams, a ray of light shot out from Qin Sang, arriving first and striking the center of the giant python phantom's eyes.  The light was chaotic, mixed with countless thin, silver threads –  lightning threads.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Hit by the light, the giant python phantom froze, the light in its eyes rapidly fading.  Cracks appeared on its head and quickly spread across its body.</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang groaned, his eyes filled with shock and confusion.  He had been backlashed by his own power!</p><p>Qin Sang had a strange expression on his face. The light hadn't come from him, but from the Tianmu Butterfly!</p><p>This was a power the Tianmu Butterfly had gained after its fourth transformation. Qin Sang called it Tianmu Divine Light.  The Tianmu Divine Light had the power to break through magical techniques, targeting the weaknesses of spells and abilities. Though it had limitations, with precise timing, it could not only break through defenses, but potentially cause the opponent to be backlashed by their own powers.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if all Tianmu Butterflies developed this ability after their fourth transformation, or if this was a result of a mutation, a fusion of two powers.  This was the first time he had used it against an opponent, and the effect was even better than he expected.</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang, caught off guard, was indeed struck.  He desperately focused on maintaining the giant python phantom, resisting the backlash, unable to attend to the bone knife.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang immediately used the demonic fire to knock the bone knife away, then charged at Qianji Yao Wang, intending to finish him off.</p><p>Qianji Yao Wang still didn't understand how he had been defeated.  His face was filled with resentment as he tried to use a self-harming technique for a desperate counterattack.</p><p>Then, a sigh came from the distance, from the Snake King.</p><p>"Enough! No need to fight anymore.  Mingyue Daoist is clearly superior. We concede!"</p>
