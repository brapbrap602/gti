<h1>Chapter 1118: The Puppet Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1118: The Puppet Battle</p><p>“The Soul Cleansing Liquid is most effective only when taken for the first time, and before forming the Nascent Soul.  Its effects significantly diminish afterwards; giving you more would be useless.”</p><p>The elder produced two small jade vials, dividing the liquid between them and handing them to the young man and woman. He explained.</p><p>Then, the elder’s finger lightly tapped the stone cauldron.</p><p>Runes flickered within the cauldron, creating a vortex that swallowed the remaining Soul Cleansing Liquid.  Its destination was unknown.</p><p>The two young cultivators held the vials, reluctant to let go, carefully putting them away.</p><p>“Alright! Junior Sister, let's split up. You stay on the outer perimeter and re-check the state of the ancestral and immortal restrictions.  I’ll take these two to the inner hall and tell them the true ancestral teachings.”</p><p>The elder said.</p><p>The crone nodded, then seemed to remember something and said solemnly, “Brother, be careful. Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord are cunning and treacherous. It’s best not to encounter them. If they learn of the Four Saints Palace’s location, they certainly won't let it go. Since our ancestors, our palace has weakened, forced into hiding.  We’re not what we once were and can’t afford any trouble.”</p><p>The elder sighed softly, “I wish that someone among them could break through to the Divine Transformation stage and unlock our ancestor's legacy. It might contain a way to leave the Canglang Sea. Sadly, we later generations are incompetent; no one has ever broken through to Divine Transformation, forever trapped in this cage-like place.”</p><p>The crone fell silent.</p><p>Afterwards, the four were teleported back to the wooden hall and stepped out of the cloud.</p><p>The crone left alone.</p><p>The elder, with his two disciples, flew deeper into the inner hall.</p><p>……</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>He was vigilant, unsure what the first trial would be.</p><p>The moment he passed through the barrier, Qin Sang felt a tightening in his body, his vision plunged into darkness, and the other cultivators vanished, leaving him alone.</p><p>Suddenly, light filled his eyes. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, surveying his surroundings. He found himself in a circular hall, empty except for a circular arena at his feet.</p><p>In the back of the hall, a stairway led to an upper level, but it was sealed by a barrier of light.</p><p>“This is a puppet battle?”</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang’s mind stirred, recalling information he’d gathered.</p><p>The so-called puppet battle involved facing various puppets in the arena until the puppets were destroyed or the cultivator was exhausted. There was no surrendering.</p><p>Though the rules seemed cruel, it was considered one of the simplest trials.</p><p>The puppets were supposedly not overwhelmingly powerful, and there were rest periods.  Those daring enough to enter the inner hall, if they couldn’t even pass this, were simply overestimating themselves.</p><p>Moreover, the puppet battle was one of the most common of the first three trials.</p><p>However, that didn't mean entrants could be careless. The puppets weren’t static; some had strange abilities, and a single misstep could be disastrous.</p><p>Standing in the center of the arena, Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>The hall remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, wondering if he needed to trigger some mechanism, when the arena shook, and several dark figures leaped out, surrounding him.</p><p>“Six…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the puppets.</p><p>The puppets were ferocious in appearance, identical, resembling tigers, crouching in the arena, baring their fangs at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft ‘hmm,’ feeling a sense of familiarity.</p><p>These puppets were very similar to the puppet beasts on the first six levels of the Celestial Tower, even their method of appearance being almost identical.</p><p>“Celestial Tower, sixth level puppet beasts.  Even a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle against them. Are these similar?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a gust of wind behind him.</p><p>Without turning, he summoned his ebony sword, and with a flick of his fingers, he unleashed a strike.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The ebony sword hung in mid-air, splitting into six sword beams, simultaneously striking the six puppet beasts.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword beams struck precisely the center of each puppet beast’s forehead, easily piercing their skulls, leaving finger-sized holes.</p><p>The six puppet beasts froze simultaneously, turning into dust and disappearing.</p><p>“Just like the Celestial Tower’s puppet beasts, they have the same origin.  But they don't start from the Foundation Establishment stage; each one is equivalent to a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. If the rest are like this, and they appear in such numbers, an ordinary person would be overwhelmed…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Having entered the Celestial Tower twice, he was very familiar with the puppet beasts and knew how to deal with them, so he felt no pressure.</p><p>“Friend, want to test your skills? Then I, Qin, can rest for a while.”</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head.</p><p>Bai, inexplicably, emerged from the puppet bag.</p><p>Bai said without much interest, "Out here, I sense flaws in the Fire Curse Seed. Getting too close risks being detected by Old Master Mou. I'll try to refine the restriction further."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sheathed his sword, and approached the stairs.  The barrier on the stairs vanished as he destroyed six puppets.</p><p>Bai followed, his hand on the Fire Curse Seed, his expression focused.</p><p>The stairs offered a place to rest, but Qin Sang didn't need it, proceeding directly to the second level.  The second level was much like the first.</p><p>New puppets sprang forth, demonstrably stronger, comparable to early Foundation Establishment cultivators. Qin Sang pressed his advantage, cutting down the puppets with his sword, relentlessly continuing through two levels of puppet battles to reach the fourth.</p><p>There, Qin Sang found no further stairs upward.</p><p>"The final trial?"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, remaining vigilant.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Six leopard-shaped puppets leaped out.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed something, a sudden realization.  The objective wasn't to defeat the puppets, but to withstand their assault for a stick of incense.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, focusing on the puppets, instantly understanding this was no ordinary puppet battle.  The leopard puppets' claws gleamed coldly like blades, their positioning deliberate, not a simple encirclement, but a formation of some kind.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>One puppet leopard moved.</p><p>The others followed immediately.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang had the strange sensation that the puppets had vanished, leaving only swift, unpredictable sword light.</p><p>"The person who created these puppet beasts was no ordinary individual!  Unfortunately, the puppets are restricted, greatly weakened. Otherwise, even with us working together, we might be in danger,"</p><p>Bai's exclamation came from behind; he too was startled.</p><p>"It's not a puppet formation! It's a sword formation!"</p><p>A flash of insight illuminated Qin Sang's mind.  The creator had astonishingly integrated a sword formation into the puppets, imbuing their attacks with a semblance of sword intent.</p><p>This didn't alarm Qin Sang; instead, he was delighted. He had long struggled to grasp sword intent, lacking guidance, forced to develop a clumsy sword wheel on his own.  He'd planned to merely survive the incense-burning time, but encountering this sword formation, he wouldn't miss this opportunity.</p>
