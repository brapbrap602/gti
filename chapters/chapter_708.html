Chapter 700: Grandmaster Winter Gloom


The stout cultivator forced a smile.
"Whether you fellow Daoists believe it or not, I truly didn't obtain any usable treasures.
"That cave dwelling has a peculiar topography. It's within an unmarked cavern on an island, carved out by that senior using great magical power. The reason this Transformation stage demonic beast hide decayed so easily is directly related to that cavern.
"There's a strange, unknown cold mist within the cavern. It's not only extremely frigid but also carries a terrifying corrosive power.
"The cave dwelling is divided into three levels. Because the cave's restrictions are constantly facing the onslaught of the cold mist, the power of the first two levels has greatly diminished, allowing me to break through.  It is precisely for this reason that the cold mist has seeped into the cave dwelling, and the treasures stored inside have been completely corroded.
"Only the restrictions on the third level appear intact. The treasures inside might have survived."

To make his story more convincing, the stout cultivator took out a medicinal pill and a talisman, both of which, like the beast hide, were completely decayed.
The pill had lost all its spiritual essence, leaving only a deformed residue, its original form unrecognizable.
The talisman was even more fragile. As it was passed around, a female cultivator accidentally tore off a corner, causing the talisman to instantly shatter into countless fragments.
The female cultivator hastily apologized, but the stout cultivator waved his hand dismissively. "Even such a spiritual talisman couldn't escape this fate. Fellow Daoists, can you imagine any treasure that could resist such corrosion?"
"That's a Penetrating Sun Talisman!"
The fragments drifted like snowflakes into the sea, vanishing in the waves.
The scholar in blue stared blankly at this scene, his face filled with regret.  "I was fortunate enough to see one at an auction in the Inner Sea.  The bidders were all Nascent Soul Grandmasters, and it eventually sold for a sky-high price.  Yet this Penetrating Sun Talisman lay quietly in an unknown cave dwelling, its power completely lost, corroded into waste.  What a pity…"

Seeing the beast hide, the pill, and the Penetrating Sun Talisman, the crowd now believed the stout cultivator's words a little more. Unless they stumbled upon a Nascent Soul Grandmaster's cave dwelling, it would be impossible to obtain so many supreme treasures, all in a state of decay.
At this moment, the thin, withered elder, who had been deep in thought, suddenly spoke. "I remember an island lord of Tempest Isle, known as Grandmaster Winter Gloom, whose ice divine abilities were astonishing. If the cold mist described by Fellow Daoist Fan is real, I fear only Grandmaster Winter Gloom would dare to establish a cave dwelling there…"

Qin Sang was unfamiliar with the history of Tempest Isle.
The others, who had hunted demons on the island, had some understanding.
Hearing the name Grandmaster Winter Gloom, their expressions turned to shock.  Someone anxiously asked the stout cultivator, "Was it truly that Grandmaster's cave dwelling?"
The stout cultivator shook his head.  "With even the beast hide and the Penetrating Sun Talisman reduced to this state, what do you think could have survived? I did see some remnants of jade slips and the like in the cave dwelling, but without exception, they were all corroded beyond recognition. I searched the entire cave, but couldn't find anything to prove that senior's identity."

"If it was Grandmaster Winter Gloom, Fellow Daoist Fan's words do carry some weight."
The thin, withered elder seemed to be swayed, his expression softening, no longer so aggressive. "Grandmaster Winter Gloom's fame is widespread; I'm sure you've all heard of him.  But he was the island lord of Tempest Isle for the shortest period, and no one knows where he ultimately went. It's also said he was the most reclusive, leading to chaos on Tempest Isle at the time, comparable to the present.  Perhaps Grandmaster Winter Gloom was solely focused on cultivation, which is why he established his cave dwelling in such an unknown location…"
Mid-sentence, the thin, withered elder seemed to recall something, his face paling with sudden fear. "Grandmaster Winter Gloom left behind so many treasures in the cave dwelling.  Judging by your description, Fellow Daoist, it seems he encountered something and didn't have time to retrieve them.  Could that place… be Grandmaster Winter Gloom's final resting place?"
"That possibility is very small."
The stout cultivator disagreed with the thin, withered elder's speculation.  "But there are definitely treasures within the cave dwelling no less valuable than the beast hide and the Penetrating Sun Talisman! I've said so much, have you fellow Daoists decided? Are you going or not?"

The crowd exchanged glances, hesitant to agree or refuse.
But Qin Sang could see that they were all tempted.
He himself was no exception.
A Nascent Soul cave dwelling was exceptionally rare. With so many treasures inside, its value was no less than the ancient secret realm of the Small Cold Domain, not to mention the possibility of Nascent Soul remains.
However, the stout cultivator had revealed too little information to allay their concerns.

As everyone anticipated, the thin, withered elder stepped forward and asked, "Fellow Daoist Fan has invited us to go together.  After the restrictions are opened, you wouldn't intend to keep all the treasures for yourself, would you?"
The stout cultivator sneered.  "What? I discovered the cave dwelling, and I painstakingly figured out how to break the restrictions.  Moreover, I've already agreed to pay you a reward.  You only need to follow my instructions and work together to break the final restriction. Do you think you can share my treasures without lifting a finger?"

Among those invited by the stout cultivator were two female cultivators.
One of them, with exquisite makeup, giggled. "Compared to Nascent Soul treasures, I can easily forgo a mere Black Lizard Horn.  Besides, Fellow Daoist Fan has described the cold mist as so strange.  We'll be taking a great risk by entering and helping you break the restrictions, won't we? Fellow Daoist Fan is so eager to gather people and has carefully selected us to come here. There must be a reason."

The stout cultivator's expression shifted between cloudy and clear. He snorted coldly.
"I knew I couldn't hide it from you… The restrictions left by that senior were meant to protect the cave dwelling and also to seal the cold mist, preventing it from leaking out.  In my ignorance, after breaking the restrictions, I was careless, causing the cold mist to become unstable. It's about to rush out of the cavern. If we wait any longer, the cold mist will surely alert the surrounding demonic beasts.
"I had no choice but to do this. Otherwise, when my friend returns to the island, the treasures would fall into the hands of the demon race.
"As for your safety in the cavern, you don't need to worry. With your strength, you should be able to withstand the cold mist before breaking the restrictions. Apart from that, there are no other dangers inside. The cave's restrictions are purely defensive.
"And I've never considered, nor do I have the power to, keep everything for myself. I don't want to lose my life over worldly possessions.  However, let's be clear. If you want to share the treasures, don't ask me to fulfill the previous agreement.  Furthermore, after the restrictions are broken, I must choose one item first, and then we'll divide the rest equally."


Seeing the stout cultivator's willingness to compromise, the others couldn't say anything more.
The scholar in blue said, "What if there's only one treasure in the cave dwelling? Will Fellow Daoist Fan still claim it for yourself?"
"Indeed!"
The stout cultivator declared firmly. "I've gone through great hardships, while you all benefit without effort. If you don't even agree to this condition, I'd rather let it fall into the hands of the demon race.  The possibility of only one treasure is extremely small. In the unlikely event that happens, I can compensate you accordingly."
