<h1>Chapter 1954: Making Plans</h1><p>Faced with this question, Qin Sang gave the same answer.</p><p>"All who enter the Daoist Temple seeking treatment are treated equally by this humble Daoist."</p><p>Yin Heqian's expression eased slightly. He offered his thanks, then gave an order, beckoning someone to enter.</p><p>The Yin family members filed in, queuing according to the severity of their symptoms.</p><p>The most seriously injured was a young man. His entire body was rigid, his eyes stained grayish-white. He was carried to Qin Sang, his gaze vacant and his expression dull.</p><p>If not for the faint breath remaining in him, he would certainly be mistaken for a corpse.</p><p>Yin Heqian stood to the side, watching Qin Sang examine him, and began to explain the situation in a low voice, "Last night, a branch of the Yin family sent a talisman message, reporting that a promising junior had suddenly disappeared. It's him..."</p><p>Pointing to the young man, Yin Heqian continued, "That branch sent people to search on their own, but to no avail. My daughter also led people to search, and later they found traces in a mountain cave. I received a flying message, sensed something was amiss, and rushed over. When I arrived, my daughter and the others were exploring the cave, and as expected, an accident occurred. At first, I thought they were poisoned. I tried various Spirit Pills, but none were effective. This grayish-white energy initially parasitizes the center of the forehead. My daughter was also accidentally infected..."</p><p>Yin Heqian looked at his daughter.</p><p>Yin Qiao'er stepped forward. Her appearance hadn't changed much, but her demeanor was much calmer than when she was in Jin County. She bowed to Qin Sang and described her experience.</p><p>When she was first afflicted, there was only a faint gray air at the center of her forehead, and no obvious sensation. After a period of time, it would suddenly erupt.</p><p>The onset time varied for each person, likely related to the degree of infection.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang stood up and looked directly into the young man's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the young man's eyes slowly rolled, his pupils dilated, staring intently at Qin Sang, his mouth slightly agape.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The young man suddenly screamed, startling everyone.</p><p>The scream was more chilling than the most凄厉 wail, like the shriek of a malevolent ghost.  He thrashed his head violently, forcing the two people beside him to shift from supporting him to restraining him, almost losing their grip.</p><p>This sudden change sent a chill down everyone's spine, especially the other infected Yin family members, whose faces were filled with fear, afraid of suffering the same fate.</p><p>A flicker of joy flashed in Yin Heqian's eyes. He could see that the young man's change was related to Qin Sang, something he hadn't been able to achieve before.</p><p>This trip was a desperate attempt, grasping at straws.</p><p>Yin Heqian knew that even if he brought these people back to the Yin family, it would be difficult to find the root cause of the illness. He had to seek outside help.</p><p>He had also befriended several Alchemy masters.</p><p>But this grayish-white energy erupted too quickly.  He feared that by the time help arrived, including his daughter, everyone would have succumbed to the affliction, beyond any hope of recovery.</p><p>In his anxiety, he remembered Daoist Qing Feng of the Green Ram Temple and came to seek help.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang extended a finger, using a spell to restrain the young man, and pointed it at the center of his forehead.</p><p>Everyone subconsciously held their breath. They saw Qin Sang's fingertip press gently, then slowly withdraw.</p><p>As he did so, a grayish-white orb of light emerged from the young man's forehead.</p><p>As the orb appeared, the young man's expression suddenly became incredibly狰狞 and terrifying. His eyes widened, and bloody tears streamed from the corners.</p><p>Unfazed, Qin Sang continued the spell.</p><p>The orb was gradually forced out of the young man's body. Countless white threads of light appeared on his face, one end connected to the orb, the other rooted in his body.</p><p>Finally, the orb was completely extracted, and the threads of light were pulled out. The scene was like peeling a grotesque mask from the young man's face.</p><p>In an instant, the young man calmed down, his head tilted to the side, falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>His breath was still weak, his vital essence greatly depleted, but his skin gradually regained some color.</p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p>Yin Heqian looked at the orb in Qin Sang's hand, his face puzzled.</p><p>Even after being extracted, the orb remained restless. From time to time, a face would appear on its surface, its features twisted, screaming at Qin Sang, like the fiercest evil ghost.</p><p>"It's just a Yin Spirit,"</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yin Heqian was stunned. He hadn't expected the thing that had left him helpless to be a Yin Spirit.</p><p>Yin Spirits could be considered a type of ghost, born in places of Yin and evil. But this Yin Spirit was clearly unusual, something he had never heard of before. After all, Yin Spirits themselves could have all sorts of bizarre appearances and powers.</p><p>"This thing is extremely vicious. It can parasitize deep within the Primordial Spirit and fuse with the host's Primordial Spirit. After completely devouring the host, it might leave the body to seek a new host, or it might usurp the body, continuing to occupy the shell and disguise itself as the host, making it difficult for even close relatives to detect. However, if one knows its nature, it's not difficult to deal with."</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed as he observed, "Such a ferocious Yin Spirit is rare. Generally, only places of great misfortune can give birth to such a Yin Spirit."</p><p>"A place of great misfortune? Father, that place might be an ancient battlefield."</p><p>Yin Qiao'er interjected.</p><p>Yin Heqian nodded slightly. "Indeed. The location of that mountain cave, although desolate now, was a strategic location during the many dynastic changes before the founding of the Yan Kingdom.  Who knows how many bones are buried beneath the ground. However, there were no abnormalities before.  Could there be another reason for the sudden appearance of such a strange evil spirit?"</p><p>"We'll have to investigate to see if there's any hidden reason," Qin Sang said indifferently. He closed his palm, compressing the Yin Spirit into a round bead, and tossed it to Yin Heqian.</p><p>Yin Heqian caught the bead, hesitating to speak. He wanted to invite Qin Sang to help investigate, but seeing that Qin Sang didn't seem interested, he swallowed the words.</p><p>"With the Yin Spirit removed, this person only suffered a loss of vital essence and is not seriously injured.  Medicinal herbs to purge the Yin energy and restore vital essence will suffice," Qin Sang said, moving towards the second person.</p><p>"Please, Daoist, refine some medicinal pills for them," Yin Heqian hurriedly said, worried about making mistakes if he did it himself.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang removed the Yin Spirits from everyone one by one.</p><p>Knowing their lives were saved, their expressions were not as grave as before.</p><p>Yin Qiao'er regained some of her lively demeanor and walked to the other side of the offering table. "This must be Little Daoist Yu Lang. You've changed so much, I almost didn't recognize you. Truly a heaven-gifted talent.  You've become a Foundation Establishment cultivator in just a few years."</p><p>Yu Lang murmured his embarrassment.</p><p>Yin Qiao'er's eyes darted around and landed on the young man surnamed Shi. Curiously, she asked, "Who is this fellow Daoist?"</p><p>"My surname is Shi."</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi swallowed the spiritual liquid, immediately suppressing the toxins in his body, his complexion returning to normal.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Shi shouldn't be a cultivator from near the Yan Kingdom, right? Otherwise, with such talent, I would certainly know you."</p><p>It was Yin Heqian who strolled over.</p><p>Facing the clan leader, a Nascent Soul Patriarch, the young man surnamed Shi remained neither servile nor overbearing, replying, "Before the Daoist took charge of the Green Ram Temple, this one was once saved by him."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Yin Heqian's eyes gleamed, his expression even more enthusiastic. "So you are an old acquaintance of the Daoist. My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Qin Sang's origins were mysterious.</p><p>Yin Heqian had wanted to visit several times but couldn't find a reason.</p><p>After today's events, Yin Heqian valued Qin Sang even more, but he didn't dare be too abrupt, unsure of what Qin Sang might find taboo.</p><p>As a second-best option, befriending this young man surnamed Shi might be a breakthrough.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi glanced at Qin Sang, seeing that he didn't react and didn't mind him name-dropping. He coughed lightly and said, "This one is merely someone seeking medicine. It's perfectly normal that Clan Leader Yin doesn't recognize me. However, I've long heard of Clan Leader Yin's illustrious reputation and have admired you for a long time."</p><p>"Before the Daoist, don't talk about reputation, lest you invite ridicule!"</p><p>Yin Heqian laughed heartily.</p><p>"Indeed, a tall tree catches the wind. It's not necessarily a good thing," the young man surnamed Shi echoed.</p><p>Yin Heqian's smile suddenly faded as he scrutinized the young man. "Fellow Daoist Shi, do your words have a deeper meaning?"</p><p>"Clan Leader Yin is overthinking it. This one is merely speaking from the heart.  The world is full of schemes and intrigues.  Clan Leader Yin bears the heavy responsibility of the family's rise and fall. It's not as carefree as this one, a wandering cloud and wild crane." The young man surnamed Shi shook his head and turned to say, "Xiao Wu, Yu Lang, it's getting late. This brother should be going."</p><p>"Brother Shi, be careful on your journey."</p><p>Yu Lang quickly escorted the young man surnamed Shi out of the Daoist Temple.</p><p>Their closeness was noticed by Yin Heqian.</p><p>The young man's words flashed through his mind. Yin Heqian turned his gaze to his clansmen plagued by Yin Spirits, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Yin Qiao'er stood behind him, watching the young man surnamed Shi until he was out of sight, lost in thought, a hint of confusion in her eyes.</p><p>Soon, the Yin Spirits were extracted from all the Yin family members.</p><p>Qin Sang sat back at the table and picked up his brush. "Clan Leader Yin, will you settle the account now or later?"</p><p>After inquiring about the amount, Yin Heqian's lips twitched. "Please allow this one one day, Daoist.  I will definitely deliver the spirit stones tomorrow!"</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the underground chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation, motionless for a long time.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted slightly. He waved his sleeve, opening the restrictive formation. "Come in."</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Two figures descended into the chamber, bowing in unison. They were Tai Yi and Luo Hou.</p><p>The two demons had gone out to search for the branch altars and had returned safely.</p><p>Tai Yi presented a jade slip. "Lord Envoy, these are the locations of all the Thunder Altars!"</p><p>The contents of the jade slip unfolded, revealing a formation diagram.</p><p>It was slightly different from the formation diagram Qin Sang had deduced, but the difference was not significant. The two demons' task was to correct these discrepancies.</p><p>This formation diagram also marked the terrain and landforms, representing years of hard work by the two demons.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, noting that there were a total of eighty-eight, sixty-four branch altars, corresponding to the number of the Eight Trigrams, but their distribution did not follow the pattern of the Eight Trigrams.</p><p>The entire altar formation stretched east from the edge of Cloud Capital Mountain, west to the banks of Duskfall Mountain, north towards the Fire Domain, and south to the water's edge.</p><p>With an unknown degree of coincidence, it basically aligned with the areas where mortals currently lived.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to project the altar formation onto the main altar and immediately sensed a connection. This altar formation was accurate!</p><p>Including the main altar, there were a total of sixty-five Thunder Altars, all of which had finally been found!</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly began to comprehend the formation. With the formation diagram as a reference, his progress was indeed much smoother. But soon, he encountered new difficulties, realizing that to truly restore the main altar, he must first restore the entire altar formation!</p><p>He would comprehend the main altar while restoring the branch altars, progressing simultaneously, complementing each other.</p><p>Perhaps, "reconstruction" would be a more appropriate term.</p><p>Of the sixty-four branch altars, besides the three he had restored, only two remained relatively intact. The vast majority had been annihilated by the passage of time, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Time was secondary. Rebuilding fifty-nine branch altars would require an astoundingly large amount of resources!</p><p>Thinking of this, even Qin Sang felt a bit strained.</p><p>Fortunately, the main structure of the main altar was still intact, requiring only restoration, not reconstruction.  Otherwise, Qin Sang wouldn't even dare to consider it now, as it would likely bankrupt even Cloud Capital Heaven.</p><p>After instructing the two demons to rest, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Having come this far, restoring the altar formation was imperative. He would have to make a trip to Cloud Capital Mountain himself.</p><p>...</p><p>Upon receiving the news, his original body almost immediately left seclusion, flying directly to Cloud Cauldron City, and successfully met with the City Lord.</p><p>Explaining his purpose, Qin Sang presented a jade slip listing various spiritual materials.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had only listed a portion, the City Lord still frowned deeply.</p><p>"Does the City Lord have any difficulties?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The City Lord of Cloud Cauldron City put down the jade slip and said with difficulty, "The spiritual materials listed by the Daoist, although not peerless treasures, are all quite valuable, and the quantity is not small..."</p><p>When Daoists constructed altar formations, they often involved dozens or even hundreds of altars.  Except for the main altar, they wouldn't typically choose extremely rare materials.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect to acquire everything at once. "There's no rush. How much can the City Lord provide now?"</p><p>The City Lord shook his head and said, "If it were a while ago, I could have tried to gather more for the Daoist, but now it's particularly difficult."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Has something happened?"</p><p>The City Lord of Cloud Cauldron City spoke vaguely. "Times have changed. Spiritual materials and medicinal herbs are scarce in Cloud Capital Mountain now, unless the Daoist is willing to exchange them at several times the price."</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "I recall that the Daoist is skilled in Artifact Refinement?"</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Qin Sang had no need for modesty in this regard.</p><p>"Can you refine spirit treasures?" the City Lord pressed.</p><p>"The City Lord should understand that spirit treasures cannot be created overnight. Refining a spirit treasure requires immense time and effort from this humble Daoist," Qin Sang reminded.</p><p>"It doesn't matter. Being able to temper magical treasures into pseudo-spirit treasures is sufficient.  As long as the Daoist is willing to work the forge, we'll take as many as you can refine. The reward will definitely satisfy the Daoist!"</p><p>The City Lord tapped the jade slip.  "These spiritual materials are also not a problem!"</p><p>Even without the City Lord explicitly stating it, Qin Sang could guess that such extravagance must be the work of Cloud Capital Heaven!</p><p>With Cloud Capital Mountain's resources, the Nascent Soul cultivators within the sect certainly wouldn't lack pseudo-spirit treasures.</p><p>If they still needed more pseudo-spirit treasures, and in large quantities, it was either for consumption or for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Undercurrents were surging within the Fire Domain, and they couldn't be hidden from Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He had examined the copper pillar repeatedly, but hadn't been able to discern anything.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this object was so valuable that not only was the Soulfall Abyss interested, but Cloud Capital Heaven was also actively involved in the competition.</p><p>Sending Nascent Soul cultivators into the Fire Domain wasn't enough; they were preparing to mobilize even more Nascent Soul cultivators. Could it be that the two major forces were about to engage in all-out war?</p><p>It was an opportunity to glimpse the strength of both sides!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>It was also a good thing for him. He could take advantage of this opportunity to speed up the construction of the branch altars.</p><p>However, his original body would need to devote some energy to artifact refinement.</p><p>Refining pseudo-spirit treasures wasn't as complex as refining true spirit treasures.  Judging from the City Lord's words, both the magical treasures and the spiritual materials would be provided by them, and there was no need to pursue exceptional quality, as long as their power surpassed that of ordinary magical treasures.</p><p>In battles between Nascent Soul cultivators, possessing pseudo-spirit treasures would give one a significant advantage.</p><p>With Qin Sang's abilities, he could easily achieve this.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Just got back from my hometown, arrived home late.
