<h1>Chapter 498: Taking the Pill</h1><p>A fragrant aroma filled the chamber.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid looked vibrant and luscious.</p><p>Qin Sang sat by the jade pool, absently stirring the spring water with his fingers, lost in thought, recalling the conversation he had just had with Yun Youzi.</p><p>Restoring his foundation was only one of the effects of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. For other cultivators, especially demonic beasts, this kind of heavenly treasure was also a must-have.</p><p>Yun Youzi had received vague information from his sect. The Taiyi Pill Sect had always been very interested in all kinds of spiritual herbs, collecting them whether the rumors were true or false.</p><p>To confirm the rumors, Yun Youzi first infiltrated Immortal Demon City, controlled by the Spirit Controlling Sect, for several years.</p><p>Immortal Demon City was the closest major cultivation city in the Small Cold Region to the Demonic Beast Hills. It was said to be supported by the Demonic Beast Hills, serving as a gateway between the Demonic Beast Hills and the cultivation world of the Small Cold Region.</p><p>This showed how close the Spirit Controlling Sect and the Demonic Beast Hills were.</p><p>Finally, Yun Youzi even joined a caravan and infiltrated the Demonic Beast Hills several times. Though he spoke of it casually, Qin Sang could imagine how thrilling the experience must have been.</p><p>Since ancient times, humans and demons had found it difficult to coexist, and not just because of prejudice.</p><p>Precisely because of this, Yun Youzi had been missing for so many years before confirming the existence of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit. However, he needed to see it with his own eyes to know the specifics.</p><p>Yun Youzi agreed to accompany Qin Sang on this trip before attending to his own affairs.</p><p>Even with Yun Youzi's help, Qin Sang was unsure.</p><p>The Demon Core Realm great demons of the Demonic Beast Hills weren't like the ignorant demonic beasts living in dangerous mountains and treacherous waters.</p><p>Demonic beasts that obtained the Emperor Flow Nectar and awakened their intelligence all had extraordinary origins and must have inherited the legacy of great demons. In terms of both strength and wisdom, they were comparable to human Core Formation cultivators and should not be underestimated.</p><p>Relying solely on the Flying Night Fiend, he had almost no chance of defeating a Demon Core Realm great demon, let alone the possibility that the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit might attract more than one.</p><p>Under such circumstances, even fishing in troubled waters required sufficient strength.</p><p>The location of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was undoubtedly extraordinary. Without Core Formation strength, it would be almost impossible to sneak in undetected under the watchful eyes of Demon Core Realm great demons.</p><p>Because of this, Yun Youzi advised Qin Sang to maintain a calm mind. This trip into the Violet Firmament Palace was mainly to pinpoint the location of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and find a way to break the restrictions.</p><p>After breaking through to the Demon Core Realm and gaining more than three hundred years of lifespan, he would surely be able to wait for the next opening of the Violet Firmament Palace. In the meantime, he could carefully plan and prepare, increasing his chances of success.</p><p>But who knew when the Violet Firmament Palace would open next?</p><p>The timing of each opening was uncertain, closely related to the spiritual tides of the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p>It could be as short as a hundred years or as long as three hundred. Such a long time meant he would have to endure his damaged foundation throughout his entire Core Formation stage.</p><p>Of course, if he could break through to the Core Formation stage before the next opening of the Violet Firmament Palace, everything would be different.</p><p>With himself, his two magical treasures, and the Flying Night Fiend, he would at least have a fighting chance.</p><p>"Huu..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the ceiling of the cave, slowly exhaling, then collected his scattered thoughts, not letting these distractions affect his mind, lest they become an obstacle during Core Formation.</p><p>Due to the presence of the spiritual spring, the spiritual energy in the cave was extremely rich, enough to support his cultivation even at the Core Formation stage.</p><p>There was no need to set up a spirit-gathering formation.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the restrictions on the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and placed a meditation cushion by the jade pool, sitting down in meditation.</p><p>Over the past few years, every time he had the opportunity to return to his sect, Qin Sang would visit Pagoda Peak, diligently studying the classics related to Core Formation stored there.</p><p>If he had the opportunity to consult Qi Yuan Shou, he wouldn't miss it.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't granted an audience every time he paid his respects, having only seen Qi Yuan Shou twice in the past few years.</p><p>He learned from Gao Yang, Qi Yuan Shou's disciple, that Qi Yuan Shou seemed to be preparing to enter the Violet Firmament Palace as well and had become less involved in sect affairs.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had made ample preparations for Core Formation, so after breaking through to the False Core Realm, there was no need to return to the sect; he could directly enter seclusion.</p><p>After breaking through to the False Core Realm, Qin Sang had traveled back and forth and fought a great battle with Daoist Jiu Pao, greatly consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>After three months of secluded cultivation, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation.</p><p>He looked within.</p><p>His sea of Qi was full, his spiritual power calm and undisturbed.</p><p>His spirit was complete, his divine sense powerful.</p><p>The False Core Realm represented the culmination of the Foundation Establishment stage. Having reached this realm, there was no further progress to be made, only waiting for Core Formation.</p><p>This was indeed the case.</p><p>After breaking through to the False Core Realm, no matter how hard Qin Sang tried, his cultivation could no longer increase, firmly stuck at the bottleneck, once again experiencing the frustration of being limited by it.</p><p>If he were a Heaven Spiritual Root cultivator, he could easily form a Gold Core now, something Qin Sang could only envy.</p><p>During these three months, he had refined the spiritual power in his sea of Qi to its utmost limit, smoothing out every bit of restlessness in his heart.</p><p>When he awoke, his gaze swept calmly around the cave, then he looked down at his dantian for a long while before closing his eyes again.</p><p>In his mind, he carefully recalled the classics from Pagoda Peak several times and pondered over Qi Yuan Shou's words, whether useful or not.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang began to attempt Core Formation.</p><p>He didn't choose to directly use auxiliary spiritual items but tried to form his core with his own power.</p><p>If he could succeed by chance, it would be best, but Qin Sang understood that this possibility was almost non-existent. His purpose was to accumulate as much experience as possible, integrating what he had seen and heard.</p><p>This might increase his chances of success when refining spiritual items later.</p><p>He currently only had the Kanli Gold Core, the Snow Spirit Lotus, and the Iris Flower, so he had to proceed cautiously.</p><p>At the bottom of the great marsh.</p><p>Deep in the mud.</p><p>The cave saw no sunlight, and time was unknown.</p><p>In the silent cave, Qin Sang sat like an ancient pine, motionless. His aura rarely fluctuated. For several months, there seemed to be no change.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang swayed slightly, waking up from his meditation once more.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had cultivated his techniques tirelessly, but he couldn't sense any sign of spiritual power condensing, forcing him to face reality. With his talent, trying to form a core with his own power was nothing but a fool's dream.</p><p>It was simply impossible, and he hadn't even gained a shred of experience.</p><p>Several months had been wasted with no gain.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, and his state of mind remained undisturbed, so he didn't feel disappointed and could calmly accept it all.</p><p>It seemed he had to try using the Kanli Gold Core.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately enter meditation. He stood up and quietly left the cave, returning to the small island. Finding no message from Yun Youzi, he returned to the cave.</p><p>He and Yun Youzi had agreed that if the Violet Firmament Palace suddenly opened, they would leave a message talisman on the island to inform each other.</p><p>At that time, whether he had formed his core or not, Qin Sang could only put these matters aside and enter the Violet Firmament Palace first.</p>
