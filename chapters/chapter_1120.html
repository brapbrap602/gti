<h1>Chapter 1112  Senior Sister</h1><p>A chilling aura emanated from the ice coffin.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qing Jun.</p><p>Qing Jun gazed at the ice coffin.</p><p>She saw the peachwood sword clutched tightly in Qing Zhu's arms.</p><p>She remembered Qin Sang buying this sword from her in the Wen Yue Market.</p><p>"He passed away recently?"</p><p>Seeing Qing Zhu's body intact, not a skeleton, Qing Jun raised an eyebrow, her eyes suddenly turning cold, her tone tinged with anger.</p><p>After disappearing from the Zi Wei Palace, Qing Zhu vanished without a trace, neither alive nor dead.</p><p>For centuries, they were separated by distance.</p><p>Qing Jun knew something of what happened in the Zi Wei Palace years ago, understanding that Qing Zhu must have faced extreme danger, a fight for survival.</p><p>They all thought Qing Zhu had died in the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>Their mother passed away with regret, consumed by sorrow.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing Qing Jun's misunderstanding, quickly explained: "Senior Qing Zhu didn't want to stay away, but he self-severed his primordial spirit, forcing himself to cultivate the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter.'  This resulted in a severe injury, and he suffered a demonic soul backlash. He spent these years struggling against it…"</p><p>Qing Jun's expression softened slightly.  She murmured, "Seeking shortcuts, one ultimately bears the price."</p><p>She knew Qing Zhu's life story, and the power and dangers of the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter,' knowing Qin Sang's words were true.  Qing Zhu's actions of that time planted the seeds of his misfortune.</p><p>Qin Sang detected something unusual in her tone, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>"It doesn't seem like he died from demonic soul backlash."</p><p>Qing Jun's eyes were sharp, "His injuries are unusual."</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu died from channeling sword energy into his body.</p><p>Even the most powerful cultivators in the present age would struggle to inflict such wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang responded, "The demonic soul was manipulated by an ancient demon lord, almost releasing the lord from its ancient seal. Senior Qing Zhu, with great righteousness, sacrificed himself, perishing with the demonic soul and the demon lord. Alas! If it weren't for the ancient demon lord, Senior Qing Zhu could have returned with me…"</p><p>Thinking of Qing Zhu's end, Qin Sang still felt a deep sense of loss.</p><p>"That's something he would do."</p><p>Qing Jun nodded, then her eyes narrowed sharply. "An ancient demon lord?"</p><p>"Even after being sealed for countless years, the demon lord's power is still terrifying, overwhelming Nascent Soul cultivators. I remember, when the Zuyuan attacked the Immortal Array, it summoned a three-headed six-armed demonic shadow. Could that be connected to the ancient demon lord?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked solemnly.</p><p>This had been his constant worry. While interacting with various factions in the Yinshan Pass, he had repeatedly probed for information.</p><p>Unfortunately, he lacked access to Nascent Soul masters and couldn't uncover the true secrets.</p><p>Now meeting Qing Jun, he had to ask.</p><p>His friends and family were all in the Xiao Han Domain, and he would likely stay there to cultivate for a long time, so he couldn't help but be concerned about the war.</p><p>Qing Jun was thoughtful. Hearing Qin Sang's question, she said, "If the Zuyuan also had such a terrifying ancient demon lord, the Xiao Han Domain would have been devastated. The Zuyuan is certainly strange, but the situation hasn't reached that point."</p><p>Pausing, Qing Jun looked down at the ice coffin and asked, "Did he leave any last words?"</p><p>"Senior Qing Zhu entrusted me to bring his remains back and bury him in Peach Blossom Valley. In his final moments, he had no resentment or regret, only saying that they had been waiting for me for many years, and finally, they could reunite in the afterlife…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two graves, recounting Qing Zhu's last words faithfully.</p><p>Then, he took out the jade slip engraved with the "Qing Zhu Sword Scripture" and handed it to Qing Jun.</p><p>"This sword scripture was carved by Senior Qing Zhu on a cliff face. It's his most precious life's work."</p><p>Qing Jun took the jade slip.</p><p>She read those few lines for a long time.</p><p>Finally, Qing Jun returned the jade slip to Qin Sang, "This is for you."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and silently accepted it.</p><p>Qing Jun walked to the two tombstones, gently touching the stone, silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "Are you surprised that I don't seem heartbroken by this news?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Qing Jun to ask that.</p><p>Since taking out the ice coffin, he had been secretly observing her.</p><p>Even while he recounted Senior Qing Zhu's ordeal and last words, her expression and tone remained indifferent, as if she were listening to a stranger's story.</p><p>Qin Sang had a similar feeling before, that Qing Jun mentioned Senior Qing Zhu very calmly. He never imagined they were actually father and daughter.</p><p>Qin Sang felt it best to remain silent, avoiding any words that might anger Qing Jun. He carefully replied, “Senior Qingzhu, trapped by a demonic spirit, saw the peachwood sword you carved.  Despite the risk of being consumed, he struggled free to ask about you. Learning of your safety and advancement, he was overjoyed. Before parting, Senior Qingzhu said he had failed in his duties to you, that he was only your biological father, nothing more;  that you needn't be troubled…”</p><p>“You don't need to be so guarded with me. He was my father, no matter what. You brought his body back; I owe you for that.”</p><p>Qing Jun interrupted Qin Sang, seeing through his intentions. After a moment's thought, she said, “Since he chose you as his successor, call me Senior Sister.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>He had hoped to use this opportunity to gain Qing Jun's favor.</p><p>Though they had interacted in the past, it had been purely transactional.</p><p>He never expected such a positive outcome.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, a formidable enemy, had been a constant threat.  Gaining the favor of a Yuan Ying master was something Qin Sang desperately desired.</p><p>“Qin Sang greets Senior Sister!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately bowed, accepting the relationship.</p><p>He glanced at the ice coffin, silently thanking Senior Qingzhu for his unspoken support.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu must have known his daughter's temperament well.  Having him returned to Peach Blossom Valley for burial likely meant he foresaw this.</p><p>“This is an Elder's token from the Yuanshen Sect! With this, you may freely enter and leave Peach Blossom Valley and cultivate there.  As an Elder of the Yuanshen Sect, you won't need to worry about scrutiny in the cultivation world.”</p><p>Qing Jun sent a stream of light, handing Qin Sang a token. Her tone shifted, becoming colder. “Qin Sang, I don't care about your grievances with Dongyang Bo. Don't try to involve me. If you want revenge, you must do it yourself.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill. He understood Qing Jun’s words.</p><p>Their connection stemmed from Senior Qingzhu, but there was little affection between them.</p><p>Qing Jun had granted him a place to cultivate in Peach Blossom Valley and given him an Elder's token, protecting him from Dongyang Bo until he reached Yuan Ying. This was already more than he could have hoped for.</p><p>He couldn't push his luck!</p><p>Qing Jun and Dongyang Bo had no personal feud.</p><p>With the Zuìyuān army's imminent attack and the crisis unresolved, Dongyang Bo, a Yuan Ying cultivator, was vital to their side.  Given Qing Jun's personality, she would be unlikely to provoke a conflict within Xiaohan Region in this situation.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had never considered such a thing.</p>
