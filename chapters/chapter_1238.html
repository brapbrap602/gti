<h1>Chapter 1230: Revenge</h1><p>The fat chicken circled the ice palace and discovered a teleportation array. Only then did it realize that Qin Sang had used this array to teleport over last time, find its home, and steal the fragments of the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld. However, the teleportation array was unresponsive—the array on the other side had been destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang buried Wu Shang's body in the ice palace, erected a memorial stele, and then sealed the palace. After leaving the palace, the fat chicken wanted to return to its old cave to take a look. The cave of the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon was actually deep within the inner valley.</p><p>The Endless Valley was filled with layers of restrictions and chaotic spatial distortions. Qin Sang followed the fat chicken for a long time before finally seeing the familiar iceberg and the boundless, cloud-like Profound Frost Gale.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>As Qin Sang passed through the Profound Frost Gale, he saw the entrance to the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon's cave and sensed that the cave now had an owner. His expression shifted slightly as he glanced at the fat chicken.</p><p>The fat chicken chuckled sheepishly, "I can't hide anything from your sharp eyes, Master. The cave my mother left behind was forcibly taken over by a damned fox not long after she disappeared. I was still young at the time, and it chased me to the point where I had nowhere to run. Fortunately, my mother left me a few life-saving treasures, or I would have met a terrible end. After that, I wandered aimlessly, suffering greatly, and nearly got caught by cultivators who would have skinned me, broken my bones, and refined me into a magical tool. If I don't avenge this, I can't rest easy!"</p><p>As the fat chicken recalled its tragic past, it couldn't help but gnash its teeth in anger.</p><p>Although the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon Demon King had disappeared, she had left behind an excellent cave and many treasures. Originally, the fat chicken could have cultivated peacefully until it reached the Demon Core stage or even higher, after which it could have ventured out to find a way to save its mother. However, the cave was seized by an unwelcome guest.</p><p>The descendant of a mighty demon king had been reduced to a stray dog.</p><p>The fat chicken narrowly escaped with its life, hiding and fleeing in a most pitiful state.</p><p>"I dare not trouble you, Master. I will settle this grudge myself!"</p><p>The fat chicken let out a sharp cry and dove down like a bolt of lightning, charging straight into the ice cavern. Immediately after, a shrill cry echoed from within the cave.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The icy winds within the cavern scattered in response, and bolts of lightning and blue light shot out from the cave, illuminating the surroundings with a dazzling radiance.</p><p>The fat chicken burst out of the cavern, closely followed by a streak of blue light. It turned out to be a blue fox, the size of a calf, its aura on par with the fat chicken.</p><p>Over the years, the blue fox had occupied such a fine cave, cultivating day and night, and had grown into a late-stage Demon Core demon. Otherwise, the fat chicken would have come for revenge long ago.</p><p>When enemies meet, their eyes blaze with hatred.</p><p>The two demons clashed in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over and saw that the blue fox was quite fierce and not weak in strength, but it still couldn't compare to the fat chicken, which had absorbed the Thunder Power of the Azure Phoenix and wielded the Demon King's treasures. It was only a matter of time before the fat chicken emerged victorious.</p><p>Losing interest, Qin Sang averted his gaze and flew out of the gale layer to observe this remote and desolate land.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>The two demons fought hundreds of rounds in the blink of an eye.</p><p>From the ground to the sky, and back to the ground.</p><p>For a moment, the roars shook the heavens.</p><p>Glaciers cracked, and hurricanes howled.</p><p>The fat chicken finally had the chance to vent its anger, unleashing all its powers without reserve. Its body was enveloped in azure lightning, shooting out bolts of thunder, as if the Azure Phoenix itself had possessed it, radiating divine might.</p><p>The blue fox gradually felt overwhelmed, its eyes darting around. It hadn't expected that the little demon it had chased away years ago had now surpassed it in strength and come for revenge.</p><p>Although it had never consumed the Emperor's Nectar, having lived for so long, its intelligence was not low.</p><p>Realizing the enemy's overwhelming power, it began to think of fleeing.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The blue fox spat out a ball of cold air, a spiritual wind refined from the essence of the Profound Frost Gale it had absorbed over the years.</p><p>The fat chicken didn't dare to take it head-on and quickly dodged.</p><p>However, as the ball of cold air approached, it suddenly condensed into a sharp blade, its speed skyrocketing. In an instant, it pierced through the void and slashed toward the fat chicken's chest, seemingly about to pierce through and kill it.</p><p>But the blue fox didn't even glance at the result. With a flick of its tail, it turned to flee.</p><p>"I've been waiting for this move!"</p><p>The fat chicken laughed instead of panicking, opening its mouth to release a delicate orb left by the Demon King.</p><p>The orb seemed fragile, but when the ice blade struck it, not only was the orb unharmed, but the blade instantly turned to dust.</p><p>The fat chicken laughed maniacally, folding its wings and pouncing on the blue fox.</p><p>Its claws crackled with lightning, ready to crush the blue fox's skull.</p><p>The blue fox hastily dodged, but it couldn't keep up with the fat chicken's relentless attacks. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning shattered its protective aura and struck a vital point, sending it tumbling from the sky and crashing heavily onto the ice, rolling into a heap.</p><p>Severely injured, the blue fox had no strength left to escape. It lay on its back, its paws in the air, pleading for mercy as the fat chicken descended.</p><p>Recalling the past, the fat chicken's blood boiled. How could it let its enemy live? Without hesitation, it tore open the blue fox's belly, its claws churning inside, and pulled out the blue fox's demon core, swallowing it in one gulp.</p><p>Having successfully avenged itself, the fat chicken cleaned up the mess the blue fox had made of the cave and hurried to reunite with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't ask about the process, simply storing the fat chicken in the Primordial Unity Ring before heading toward the Blood Lake.</p><p>The depths of the Endless Valley were as dangerous as the Abyssal Ruins, making progress difficult.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could move freely even in the Abyssal Ruins, so these obstacles were nothing to him.</p><p>With time to spare before the agreed-upon meeting, Qin Sang took the opportunity to explore the Endless Valley, collecting several spiritual herbs and fruits. Unfortunately, the Sword Spirit of the Slaughter Sword still showed no reaction.</p><p>Five days later, Qin Sang found the Blood Lake.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue has arrived."</p><p>There were actually over a dozen figures at the edge of the Blood Lake.</p><p>The one who greeted Qin Sang was Xiang Qing, who lived closest to the Endless Valley and had arrived first.</p><p>They had worked together to subdue the Ancestral Sacred Flame at the Divine Peak, so they had some rapport.</p><p>Beside Xiang Qing was a Nascent Soul-stage demonic cultivator who had been keeping an eye on the Blood Lake's seal recently, ensuring timely updates.</p><p>Apart from them, the rest were all Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, Fellow Daoist Hong..."</p><p>Qin Sang greeted them.</p><p>Noticing that the Golden Core cultivators were standing far off, whispering among themselves, he felt a bit puzzled.</p><p>The Blood Lake wasn't just about breaking the seal—even Nascent Soul ancestors had to tread carefully inside.</p><p>The purpose of entering the Blood Lake was to scheme against the Sin Abyss. These Golden Core cultivators wouldn't be of much help and might even become a burden.</p><p>Xiang Qing glanced at them and said indifferently, "They're all desperate souls who somehow learned of the Blood Lake's appearance and want to fish in troubled waters. Back then, someone found the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld in the Blood Lake. Perhaps this time, someone with great fortune will emerge. However, it's hard to say how many will come out alive."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that these people were mostly disciples from major sects, well-informed and likely guided by their elders.</p><p>Although they didn't lack cultivation resources, hitting bottlenecks and being stuck for over a century was common. There were always bold individuals who ventured into forbidden lands and secret realms in search of opportunities.</p><p>Qin Sang had walked this path himself.</p><p>"So this is the Blood Lake? It's smaller than the one in the Abyssal Ruins..."</p><p>Qin Sang took a few steps forward, examining the Blood Lake.</p><p>The Blood Lake was sandwiched between two ancient restrictions, forming a ribbon-like gap. They now stood at one end of this gap.</p><p>Strangely, the Blood Lake didn't touch the sky or the ground—it floated in mid-air, continuously emitting a bloody aura.</p>
