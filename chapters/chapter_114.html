Chapter 107: Earthly Yin Vein


“Fellow Daoist Hong wasn't at his cave and hadn't left a message for any of his friends. Fellow Daoist Liu and I forced our way in and found the place deserted. Either he left in a hurry or met with an accident outside,” the two loose cultivators close to Hong Shan reported wearily upon their return to Cloud Peak Mountain.


Both men looked worried. They were close friends with Hong Shan and hadn't seen him since their last gathering. They assumed he'd gained some insight and was in secluded cultivation. Now, realizing his absence from their regular meeting, they knew something was amiss.


Sun De frowned, looked around, and asked, “Has anyone spoken to Fellow Daoist Hong since our last gathering?”


Everyone shook their heads.


Just then, Qin Sang arrived on his Sky Shuttle.  As he landed, Sun De's eyes lit up. He stood up eagerly and asked, “Junior Brother Qin, you saw Fellow Daoist Hong at the Earth Sink Cavern last time. Did he mention where he was going?”


Qin Sang landed and sensed something amiss in the gazes of those around him. He frowned slightly.


After patiently listening to Sun De, Qin Sang understood the situation. They had only shared drinks once and weren't close. Even if they were, incidents of murder and robbery were common in the cultivation world.


Qin Sang, with a clear conscience, replied, “Fellow Daoist Hong said he needed Yin Sha Qi to refine his magical tool. I even sent a message talisman to Senior Brother Sun to confirm. After you confirmed, I returned to my cave to cultivate. I haven't seen Fellow Daoist Hong during my subsequent patrols of the Earth Sink Cavern. Has he gone missing?”


Sun De said懊恼ly, “No one has seen Fellow Daoist Hong since then. Could it be…”


…


Over a dozen cultivators landed in front of the Earth Sink Cavern. After Qin Sang pointed out several key restrictions, they began searching the cavern, focusing on the fissure Hong Shan had used to enter.


Qin Sang regularly patrolled the top level, so they found nothing there. The other cultivators, with their lower cultivation levels, couldn't withstand the Yin Sha Qi for long. Only Qin Sang and Sun De ventured deeper.


Since it happened on his territory, Qin Sang couldn't remain uninvolved.  As they searched, Sun De suddenly pointed to a crevice and shouted, “Here!”


Qin Sang flew over and sighed softly at the sight.


The crevice was very hidden, its entrance narrow, widening gradually inside. At its widest point was a flat stone platform with several formation flags planted on it, likely to ward off the Yin Sha Qi.


In the center of the flags, Hong Shan sat motionless, his body stiff and his face a dark blue. He was lifeless.


Across his hands lay an ice-like blade, shimmering with a cold light, a wisp of Yin Sha Qi lingering around it.


Sun De kicked aside the formation flags and walked over to Hong Shan. After examining him, he shook his head. “The Yin Sha Qi has invaded his body, turning him into ice. I warned Fellow Daoist Hong that refining magical tools with Yin Sha Qi was a dangerous path, but he wouldn't listen. Now, he has met this tragic end… Junior Brother Qin, please collect his belongings. I'll take his remains back to give him a proper burial.”


They carried Hong Shan's body out. Upon hearing what happened, everyone fell silent.


Sun De handed Hong Shan's ice blade, formation flags, and storage pouch to his friend.  “Fellow Daoist Bai, I believe Fellow Daoist Hong has descendants.  These are his belongings. Please pass them on. Let me know when you bury him, I will pay my respects.”


With such tragic news, everyone lost their mood for gathering and dispersed.


Watching them leave, Qin Sang felt uncertain. He turned to Sun De and asked, “Senior Brother Sun, should we report this to the sect?”


Sun De replied, “It's up to you, Junior Brother Qin.  It doesn't matter either way. No one will care. Senior Brother Wang, who guarded the Earth Sink Cavern before you, also disappeared suddenly.  Even worse than Fellow Daoist Hong, his body was never found. It's suspected he fell into the Earth Sink Cavern.”


An elder from the sect came, took one look, and then ignored it. Hong was just a rogue cultivator; who would care?”

Qin Sang was surprised. “Didn't that elder go deeper into the Abyssal Chasm to search?”

“How could they possibly find anything?” Sun De chuckled, shaking his head. “Below the Abyssal Chasm is a ley line of Earthly Yin energy. The Yin Sha energy above is merely a superficial manifestation, formed from the condensed Yin energy of countless beings devoured by the Earthly Yin. Compared to the true Earthly Yin energy, it's like the difference between clouds and mud.  It's said that even a Golden Core ancestor from our sect, when personally investigating, didn't dare to venture too deep into the Earthly Yin ley line. They opted to seal it from the outside with restrictions. That elder wouldn't dare go in either. The Earthly Yin ley line is unpredictable; who knows what strange entities exist within? Junior Brother Qin, you must be careful, too.”

After Sun De left, Qin Sang pondered. No wonder even his talismans couldn't withstand the Abyssal Chasm's chilling cold. Earthly Yin energy was said to be the most Yin and sinister energy in the world, and this Abyssal Chasm contained an entire ley line of it.

Given this, Qin Sang didn't dare to go deeper into the Abyssal Chasm, honestly staying on the uppermost level.  After all, the Yin Sha energy was abundant enough for his cultivation needs.

He patrolled the caves, cultivated, and in his spare time, returned to Mount Shaohua to listen to his elder's lectures or went to Mount Dianyun for gatherings.

Immersing himself in cultivation reminded Qin Sang of his time in the Kuiyin Sect. He wondered what had become of the Tan brothers and Senior Sister Shi Hong. Were they fleeing with the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect, or had they become rogue cultivators once again?

After experiencing so much, Qin Sang found it difficult to open up to others. Even with Sun De, after so many gatherings, Qin Sang always felt a distance between them.

After determining which sword art the *Song Family Sword Techniques* originated from, he went to Pagoda Peak to exchange it for the true techniques. This sword art was called the *Arcane Finger Sword Techniques*, containing sophisticated methods for nurturing and controlling a sword, significantly enhancing combat power. Many Shaohua Mountain disciples chose to cultivate this technique.

The sword art had three levels. The first level was nurturing and controlling the sword. Qin Sang, having now comprehended Sword Qi, was considered to be at the second level. Many Shaohua Mountain disciples, lacking high-quality spirit swords unable to withstand the might of Sword Qi, were stuck at this stage. The third level was Sword Qi Transformation, enabling sword flight, which required breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage to utilize freely.

The *Song Family Sword Techniques* comprehended by the Song family ancestor contained many superfluous elements.  Qin Sang, following the authentic *Arcane Finger Sword Techniques*, reviewed everything from the beginning, refining and improving it. He felt a closer connection between his Ebony Sword and his mind, a hint of joy appearing on his face.

Once he reached the tenth level of his cultivation, he would no longer need to constantly prepare spirit stones to absorb spiritual energy.  With a mere thought, he could command his spirit sword to slay enemies. Only then could he be considered a true sword cultivator!
