<h1>Chapter 1141: Fellow Traveler</h1><p>Just moments ago, Qin Sang had caught a glimpse of the birthday banquet from afar.  </p><p>To his surprise, he noticed not only human figures but also female cultivators among the attendees. He couldn’t tell whether they were from Ten Thousand Demons City or if they had been abducted by the Demon King Qianji from somewhere else.  </p><p>These people seemed to have been in the Abyss of Ten Thousand Snakes for a long time, having adapted to the ferocious demonic beasts. Although the lesser demons drooled over human flesh, they were restrained by the more civilized demonic beasts and had to suppress their instincts.  </p><p>What Qin Sang didn’t know was whether they had always been this safe in the Abyss of Ten Thousand Snakes.  </p><p>Qin Sang had infiltrated this place alone.  </p><p>Bai had already set up a grand formation elsewhere, waiting for his return.  </p><p>Qin Sang quietly observed the layout of the Demon King’s cave abode.  </p><p>The terrain here was rather peculiar.  </p><p>The Abyss of Ten Thousand Snakes widened into a massive pocket-like area, exceptionally spacious in the middle, with peaks of varying heights scattered throughout. At the foot of the mountains was a marshland, seemingly connected to an underground river.  </p><p>Though the Abyss of Ten Thousand Snakes was shrouded in perpetual darkness, it was teeming with exotic flowers and lush vegetation, exuding vitality. The mountains were no exception.  </p><p>Three treasure vaults were distributed among the smaller hills.  </p><p>“There are spirit formations sealing this place, and guards patrol back and forth. Sneaking in unnoticed won’t be easy. I’ll have to wait for the guards to change shifts…”  </p><p>Using his Heavenly Eye ability, Qin Sang could clearly see the positions of the hidden guards.  </p><p>He had already figured out their routine. He knew that the guards, with the Demon King’s permission, could take turns enjoying the delicacies and fine wine at the banquet.  </p><p>This was the perfect opportunity to infiltrate.  </p><p>He wasn’t in a hurry, staying perfectly still in his hiding spot.  </p><p>Time passed slowly.  </p><p>The atmosphere at the banquet grew increasingly lively.  </p><p>The guards in the cave seemed to have caught the tantalizing aroma of the feast. Their minds wandered, and they frequently glanced toward the banquet, salivating.  </p><p>“Damn it! That white-feathered eagle must’ve gotten drunk and forgotten to relieve us!”  </p><p>At the top of the outermost hill, outside a stone pavilion, two demonic pythons—one black and one white, each as thick as a barrel—spoke in human tongues.  </p><p>The two demons were responsible for guarding the Demon King’s cave.  </p><p>They stared longingly toward the direction of the dark lake, their eyes filled with envy. But without the Demon King’s orders, they dared not leave their posts, so they could only grumble and sigh together.  </p><p>After waiting for so long, they were on the verge of losing patience. The black python even began cursing.  </p><p>“That white-feathered eagle might be arrogant, but he wouldn’t dare deceive us outright. Why don’t you go and complain to the Lady? She’s soft-hearted and might let us go drink. It’s just a short break. Who would be bold enough to sneak into the Demon King’s cave anyway?”  </p><p>The white python spoke nonchalantly.  </p><p>“Why don’t you go?”  </p><p>The black python glared. “If the Demon King finds out we neglected our duties for a drink, he’ll skin us alive!”  </p><p>As they spoke, a whooshing sound came from ahead.  </p><p>A white-feathered eagle appeared, strutting with an air of arrogance, swaying as it led a group of lesser demons toward them. The lesser demons’ faces were flushed red, clearly having enjoyed their fill of wine.  </p><p>The two pythons were overjoyed and whistled.  </p><p>The other patrolling lesser demons immediately rushed to the entrance of the spirit formation like a pack of wolves.  </p><p>“Finally! He didn’t forget us!”  </p><p>The black python lashed its tail fiercely at the white-feathered eagle, creating a gust of wind.  </p><p>The white-feathered eagle flapped its wings, blocking the wind, and let out a drunken burp. “The Demon King’s immortal wine today is truly potent! I can’t even bring myself to sober up! You’d better hurry, or there’ll be none left!”  </p><p>Hearing this, the two pythons cursed again and prepared to ride their demonic winds to snatch some wine.  </p><p>The white-feathered eagle suddenly grabbed the black python and nodded toward the depths of the cave, transmitting a message: “How’s the Lady’s mood?”  </p><p>“Heh, Brother Qing was ordered to guard the Lady’s chambers, supposedly for her protection. She cursed him to high heaven. We didn’t dare go near, keeping our distance to avoid her wrath.”  </p><p>The black python chuckled, clearly enjoying the misfortune of others.  </p><p>The white-feathered eagle clicked its tongue. “When the Lady fights for favor, it’s us lesser demons who suffer.”  </p><p>“You stay here and guard the place! Wait for me!”  </p><p>The black python tossed a token to the white-feathered eagle and, seeing that the white python had already left, hurried after it.  </p><p>The white-feathered eagle led its subordinates into the formation, activated the token to reseal the formation, made the necessary arrangements, and then flew around to ensure everything was in order before returning to the stone pavilion to rest.  </p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had successfully infiltrated.  </p><p>The demonic beasts were all too engrossed in the feast to notice that a tail had followed them in. Even the white-feathered eagle, whose cultivation was only at the mid-stage of the Demon Core realm, couldn’t possibly detect Qin Sang.  </p><p>Having infiltrated, Qin Sang couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.  </p><p>But this was only the beginning.  </p><p>“The banquet will continue for a while, so there’s plenty of time. I can take my time searching. However, the dark lake is very close, and Demon King Qianji could arrive in an instant. I must be careful. First, I’ll observe the restrictions on the three treasure vaults to see if there’s any opportunity…”  </p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang quietly made his way to one of the mountains.  </p><p>In the mountain was a stone wall.  </p><p>Behind the stone wall lay another realm.  </p><p>Earlier, when the guards changed shifts, the white-feathered eagle had immediately sent a group of lesser demons to stand guard in front of the stone wall, unmoving. Even the white-feathered eagle itself had circled around before feeling assured.  </p><p>Qin Sang hid beneath a tree and ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to use its ability to observe the restrictions on the stone wall.  </p><p>It was clear that these restrictions had been personally set by Demon King Qianji.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly could even detect flaws in ancient restrictions. This time, it identified two weak points in the formation that could potentially be exploited. However, doing so would undoubtedly create a significant disturbance, immediately alerting Demon King Qianji.  </p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang quietly retreated and moved to another treasure vault, only to find it equally troublesome.  </p><p>This indicated that even if there were no treasures here, it was a place Demon King Qianji valued greatly.  </p><p>He didn’t act rashly and instead made his way to the entrance of Demon King Qianji’s cave.  </p><p>He had now inspected all three potential locations for treasure vaults.  </p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. If he could slowly break through the restrictions without alerting the Demon King, even if he succeeded, he would only be able to open one vault at most.  </p><p>Once the banquet ended, Demon King Qianji would return, and Qin Sang would have to leave before then.  </p><p>“The spirit formation guarding this place is only partially activated. If I wait for the Feather Demon King to lure Demon King Qianji away, assuming he even does, the formation’s full power would be unleashed, making infiltration much harder. Moreover, the Thousand Bamboo Sea would no longer be able to conceal my presence…”  </p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, recalling what he had overheard earlier—that Demon King Qianji had a favored concubine here.  </p><p>The concubine was likely not a fully transformed demon, so capturing her shouldn’t be difficult.  </p><p>Given her close relationship with Demon King Qianji, she might know something useful.  </p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang looked toward a slightly secluded but elegantly constructed peak in the distance.  </p><p>He avoided the guards and prepared to head there.  </p><p>However, just then, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly suddenly issued a warning.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s figure froze as he noticed, to his surprise, a shadowy figure emerging from the forest on the mountain ahead, also heading toward the concubine’s chambers!  </p><p>“When did this person infiltrate?”  </p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  </p><p>――  </p><p>――  </p><p>Taking a friend’s advice, I’ll update just one chapter today and get some early rest. I’ll continue writing tomorrow.</p>
