<h1>Chapter 731: Swordsmanship Astonishes the Enemy</h1><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with further arguments, his goal already achieved.  Had he arrived alone and directly demanded Cui Ji's expulsion, he feared Cui Ji, with years of influence and potential Guild alliances, would have turned the situation into a siege. By framing it as a personal vendetta, others would be less inclined to interfere.  Confronting Cui Ji directly was much simpler.</p><p>"Cui," Qin Sang's voice, amplified by a subtle technique, reached Cui Ji alone. "Words are useless. You know my purpose. We'll settle this today. The winner stays, the loser leaves Five Elements Island, never to return."</p><p>Cui Ji's face paled then flushed.  He couldn't fathom Qin Sang.  Clearly at the early Core Formation stage, yet he'd captured his subordinate and intimidated everyone present. He glanced around, knowing he couldn't rely on these onlookers. With his lieutenant captured and his scheme exposed, uniting the Nine Star Guild to suppress the Qiongyu Trading Company was impossible.  It seemed his only option was to accept this rogue cultivator’s challenge.</p><p>Cui Ji, wordlessly, turned and swept into the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang, instructing the Wang sisters to guard the captive, followed casually.  He nodded amiably to the crowd as he passed, receiving numerous responses.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The doors slammed shut.</p><p>Everyone outside, guessing the nature of the impending confrontation, remained gathered.</p><p>Inside, Qin Sang and Cui Ji faced off. Qin Sang, with the Ten Yama Banners concealed in his palm, the formation already set, flicked his fingers at his waist.  The Flying Night Fiend appeared silently behind him.</p><p>"Flying Night Fiend!"  Cui Ji's eyes narrowed, realization dawning.  "A Core Formation level corpse refinement!  So Elder Zou valued Five Elements Island this much.  I truly underestimated him."</p><p>"Since you've underestimated the situation, accept your misfortune," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Cui Ji scoffed. "Victory is yet undecided. You're too arrogant!"</p><p>Before his words faded, Cui Ji's hand, hidden behind him, shot forward.  A dragon-eye sized pearl in his palm pulsed with violet light.</p><p>"Taste my Violet Nether Pearl!" Cui Ji roared. The pearl blazed, unleashing beams of violet light that shot towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend vanished from behind Qin Sang.</p><p>A ghostly roar echoed through the hall.  The violet beams had entangled the Flying Night Fiend, acting like ropes, forming a cage.  Despite the fiend's heavy blows, they didn't shatter, only stretched.</p><p>Cui Ji gestured, more beams joining the cage, reinforcing it. The fiend seemed unable to break free and reach Cui Ji anytime soon.</p><p>Unfazed, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve. Three Ten Yama Banners unfurled, forming a grand array before him, their magical power undeniable.</p><p>"Mid-grade magic treasure!" Cui Ji exclaimed, his face changing drastically.</p><p>Panicked, he rapidly manipulated the Violet Nether Pearl. Beams of violet light erupted, filling the hall.  Even while restraining the fiend, its power was formidable.</p><p>Ignoring the light, Qin Sang channeled his energy into the banners.  With a whoosh, Nine Nether Demonic Fire surged forth, coalescing within the formation. Following Qin Sang's will, it lunged towards Cui Ji.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The hall shook violently.  Violet light clashed with demonic fire.  Furniture shattered, consumed by the strange flames. The entire structure trembled.</p><p>Cui Ji's eyes widened, shocked by the fire's power. Sensing its aura, a flicker of fear arose.  He knew he couldn't let it touch him. He shot Qin Sang a strange look, regretting his actions.  He hadn't expected the Qiongyu Trading Company to send someone so powerful.</p><p>"How could that old fool send him here?" Cui Ji cursed inwardly, gritting his teeth.  He sliced his fingertip with spiritual energy, dripping blood onto the Violet Nether Pearl. He was resorting to using his life essence to boost the pearl's power, seeking a swift victory.</p><p>Fueled by blood, the violet beams thickened, their power terrifying, bypassing the demonic fire and heading straight for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He retreated abruptly, leaving the demonic fire in place.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish…*</p><p>The beams struck the ground, leaving gaping holes, showcasing their destructive power.</p><p>Qin Sang dodged clumsily, appearing vulnerable.</p><p>Cui Ji, elated, was about to further empower the pearl when he glimpsed a dark shadow. The demonic fire, seizing the opportunity, surged towards the Violet Nether Pearl.</p><p>Cui Ji, assuming it was targeting him, dodged.</p><p>But the fire swerved mid-air, aiming directly for the pearl.</p><p>Cui Ji paused, aware of the fire's strange properties, but destroying the pearl was unthinkable.  It was his life-bound treasure, refined over years, its power immense, nearing high-grade status, almost on par with the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Suddenly, the unexpected happened.</p><p>As the demonic fire neared the pearl, a red glint flashed, almost imperceptible.</p><p>Before Cui Ji could register it, he felt his connection to his life-bound treasure falter. The pearl's spiritual essence diminished drastically, teetering on the edge of collapse. It was Qin Sang, who'd hidden the Ebony Sword within the demonic fire, waiting for the chance to contaminate the Violet Nether Pearl.</p><p>The aggressive violet light abruptly vanished.</p><p>Cui Ji, horrified, was less concerned about the pearl and more about his precarious situation without it.  Fortunately, his cultivation was high, preventing panic. He hastily retrieved a silver shield from his storage pouch.  It shone brightly, barely holding back the demonic fire.  Sensing a gust of wind from his left, he knew the Flying Night Fiend had broken free. He tapped the shield, splitting it in two to block the fiend's claws.</p><p>He didn't expect the shield to last.  His spiritual energy reserves were still substantial. If he could buy some time, stabilize the situation, he could still fight.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't give him the chance.</p><p>Thunder rumbled. A sword beam flashed before Cui Ji's eyes, splitting into two, indistinguishable.</p><p>"Thunderclap Sword Qi! Splitting Sword Light!" Cui Ji gasped, a sharp pain in his throat.</p><p>He realized he'd miscalculated, victory nearly impossible, his life at risk. He couldn't gamble anymore.  He cried out, "I surrender!"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword beam grazed his side.  Qin Sang frowned, reluctantly withdrawing his attack.</p><p></p>
