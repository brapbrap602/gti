<h1>Chapter 1080: Sword Qi</h1><p>At the bottom of Mount Yitian.</p><p>An unknown space.</p><p>Desolate and sinister.</p><p>In the center of a high platform, there's a bottomless pit. The ancient seals of the Human race, the Azure Dragon, and the Divine Rune converge here, forming an impenetrable barrier.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A blood-red coffin rises from the depths.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A sudden sound erupts from the coffin, and the lid trembles.</p><p>Instantly, the seal's light intensifies, and mystical runes flash one after another. However, some parts of the seal dim as soon as they appear, looking incredibly weak.</p><p>The coffin shakes more violently, its lid banging loudly. The true body of the Ancient Devil lies within.</p><p>‘Hum…’</p><p>As the blood coffin slams against the seal, larger cracks appear in the weakened areas, some even splitting open.</p><p>‘Hehe…’</p><p>A sinister laugh emanates from the coffin.</p><p>The sound is faint, yet chillingly eerie in this place.</p><p>The blood coffin continues to ram the seal relentlessly.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Cracks appear in all three ancient seals, their binding power greatly diminished, barely able to contain the coffin.</p><p>“Hehe…Haha…”</p><p>The laughter within the coffin grows louder, filled with exhilaration and madness.</p><p>As the coffin rises higher and higher…</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>The laughter abruptly stops, replaced by a furious roar.</p><p>A sudden change occurs.</p><p>The space trembles, followed by profound ripples. An astonishing power surges forth, sharp and unparalleled, like sword qi.</p><p>This power originates from Mount Yitian.</p><p>At this moment, the mountain outside is violently shaking, the entire peak transforming into a divine sword. This sword qi, sealed within the mountain, has been activated, sensing the Ancient Devil's imminent escape.</p><p>The sword intent is unmatched, its qi descending from the heavens, aimed directly at the coffin!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Ancient Devil is enraged.</p><p>He had planned for years, finally luring people to break the outer seals, weakening the barrier enough for him to escape.  Unexpectedly, the one who set the trap had a backup plan, leaving behind this terrifying sword qi.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The coffin shudders violently, a hand reaching out from a gap, gripping the edge.</p><p>The hand is withered, its desiccated skin clinging tightly to bone, devoid of flesh. It's little more than a skeleton covered in skin, like a mummified hand.</p><p>Immediately, boundless demonic energy pours out from the hand, surging past the seal.</p><p>Simultaneously, the coffin glows with a blinding blood-red light, and a powerful suction force erupts.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others are caught in the pull. Only the Nine Phoenix King, being further away from the seal, escapes the disaster in time using a Heavenly Phoenix feather.</p><p>The sword qi is even faster, arriving in an instant.</p><p>The mummified hand recoils as if electrocuted.</p><p>The coffin lid slams shut, and the Ancient Devil's frustrated roar echoes from within.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword qi slashes fiercely into the coffin.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Cracks appear on the coffin, and an intense blood-red light explodes outward, desperately resisting the sword qi.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Figures fall one after another into this space.</p><p>The Dragon King, the Great Shaman, the Demon Lord, and others are all pulled in by the Ancient Devil's power.</p><p>Qing Zhu and the Ancient Devil's split soul are among them.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang crashes heavily to the ground, his body aching all over.</p><p>After storing Ya Gu in the Corpse Puppet Sack, he hasn't even had a chance to examine his surroundings when he catches a glimpse of the Demon Lord and the others nearby. His heart sinks.</p><p>As he identifies the other figures, he's not just disheartened, but completely frozen.</p><p>The Ancient Devil, the Demon Lord, Ling Zhu Zi, Qing Zhu, the two revealed successors of the Four Saints Palace, and all the major players in the battle on Mount Yitian have been dragged in.</p><p>On one side, a woman and a cicada huddle together, faces full of vigilance – the Great Shaman and Old Devil Fang.</p><p>On another side are two unfamiliar individuals, their auras as powerful as the Demon Lord's, clearly experts of the same level.</p><p>Seeing the tortoise shell on the burly man's back, Qin Sang instantly understands. These two are likely transformed great demons, brought in by the Nine Phoenix King.</p><p>No wonder the Nine Phoenix King was guarding outside the Spirit Suppression Domain.</p><p>The Canglang Sea demon race actually has so many top-tier experts.</p><p>Everyone here is at least at the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage, with most being Grand Cultivators. Almost all the top figures of the three races are present.</p><p>Qin Sang gasps.</p><p>A firefly surrounded by multiple moons.</p><p>He lies on the ground, wishing he were a speck of dust.</p><p>Fortunately, there are two others in the same predicament.</p><p>He hadn't expected Foundation Establishment cultivators to be here as well.</p><p>The young boy and girl tremble amidst the powerful figures. They look at Qin Sang with surprise and curiosity, sizing him up.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the other experts react quickly. Realizing they've fallen into an unknown space, and sensing the suction force disappear, they immediately move to escape.</p><p>However, as soon as they move, the blood-red light from the coffin solidifies into a crimson barrier, trapping everyone inside.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the others attack the barrier with all their might, but it remains unmoved. Their expressions change drastically.</p><p>They turn, staring intently at the blood coffin in the center of the space.</p><p>The standoff between the sword qi and the coffin emits fluctuations that make everyone's hearts tremble. This is clearly not a power wielded by cultivators of this world.</p><p>They have no time to pay attention to Qin Sang and the two youths.</p><p>“The Ancient Devil’s true body is sealed within that coffin! He almost broke free, and that sword qi is likely another unknown seal!”</p><p>Fairy Nangui knows far more about this place than the others. Her voice is grave.</p><p>She glances at the Great Shaman and the Dragon King, fury rising within her. She knows that the Ancient Devil's near escape must be related to these two factions tampering with the three ancient seals.</p><p>Not only the Witch Tribe but also the Demon Race has infiltrated this place.</p><p>Despite all the Four Saints' preparations within the inner hall, it’s now full of holes.</p><p>"Dragon King? Your presence in the Inner Sea is quite surprising."</p><p>Ling Zhu Zi recognizes the Dragon King, uncertainty swirling in his mind.</p><p>The Dragon King's status within the demon race of the Demon Sea is comparable to his and the Demon Lord's, one of the few transformed demons.  During the two races’ invasion of the Demon Sea and their frequent battles with the demon race, they'd crossed paths with the Dragon King many times.</p><p>Since ancient times, only cultivators have controlled the teleportation formations. The Demon Sea demons have no way to enter the Inner Sea. The Dragon King's appearance here is a dangerous sign.</p><p>The Dragon King slowly retreats, pressing against the crimson barrier, forcing a smile. "Greetings, fellow Daoists. It has been a while."</p><p>Except for the two successors of the Four Saints Palace, the cultivators present are all old acquaintances.</p><p>His plan was to steal the dragon corpse and disrupt the cultivation world of the Canglang Sea, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred at the last moment, dragging them in as well. Even worse, he’s now surrounded by enemies.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Black Tortoise recognizes the Four Saints Palace successors. Noticing Fairy Nangui's murderous gaze, he hesitates. "Although we had an agreement, I am not a member of the Four Saints Palace..."</p><p>He seems to have some connection with the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>"Kill the Ancient Devil first!"</p><p>Fairy Nangui glares at the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise.</p><p>They'll settle the score with the Demon Race after dealing with the Ancient Devil.</p><p>Since the Dragon King dared to infiltrate the Inner Sea, he needn’t bother returning.</p>
