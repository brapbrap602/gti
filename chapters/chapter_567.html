Chapter 560: The Violet Palace and the Palace of Sin


The omnipresent spiritual tide possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth.
The entire world was a vast expanse of chaos.
Amidst the spiritual tide, the four-colored cloud formation appeared minuscule, yet it advanced steadily.
They had journeyed deep into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, when suddenly, a violet rainbow appeared to the left of the four-colored cloud formation.  It weaved through the spiritual tide at an astonishing speed, rapidly approaching them.
Upon closer inspection, the violet rainbow was revealed to be a warship!
If Qin Sang could see the warship, he would instantly recognize it as a unique flying artifact of the Heavenly Firmament Alliance, known as the Skyfaring Warship.
All artifacts of the Heavenly Firmament Alliance seemed to follow a uniform design, even in function, differing only in power.
However, this particular Skyfaring Warship was more than ten times larger than any Qin Sang had seen before.
"Old Goat, it took you long enough to arrive. I thought you were too afraid to come to the Violet Palace!"
The four-colored cloud formation stopped, waiting for the Skyfaring Warship to approach.  Red Hair Ancestor’s mocking voice echoed from within.
Qin Sang, safely within the red cloud, realized that the Heavenly Firmament Alliance cultivators had arrived. He widened his eyes, trying to see outside, but could only make out a long violet streak.
A cold snort came from the warship, a sharp retort. "Red Hair, it seems the older you get, the smaller your courage becomes.  Are you regressing? Don't perish inside the Violet Palace this time!"
Red Hair Ancestor sneered, "I’ll be waiting to collect your corpse.  I'll live a few days longer than you.  I heard you failed to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage. Congratulations!  Don't strain yourself further and worsen any injuries. What if the Abyss of Sin takes advantage? You might end your lineage!"
The person on the warship raged, "If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. If the Heavenly Firmament Alliance falls, do you think your Small Cold Domain can remain unscathed? You should reconsider my proposal from the other day.  If you show no compassion, don't blame me for being ruthless!"
After a pause, Red Hair Ancestor stopped shouting and transmitted a sinister message, "Old Goat, do you really want to surrender to the Abyss of Sin and live under their control?"
This time, it was the person on the warship who took a measured tone. "If the situation demands it, I will not let the people and disciples of the Heavenly Firmament Alliance perish.  Living under someone else's roof is better than losing one's life! I'd like to see how much longer your Small Cold Domain can remain free."
Red Hair Ancestor was furious, "You dare threaten me…"
"Do you think I'm joking?"
The person on the warship snorted coldly, "Red Hair, why don't you come with me and see how aggressive the Abyss of Sin has become! If the Palace of Sin and the Violet Palace hadn't opened on the same day, those old fogies from the Abyss of Sin would definitely not want to miss the treasure hunt. I might not have come to the Violet Palace today."
Red Hair Ancestor was momentarily speechless.
Finally, someone stepped in to mediate.
Grand Demon Tongyou’s voice emerged from the demonic energy, "Alright, fellow Daoists, now is not the time for bickering.  While the Abyss of Sin is powerful, it's not enough to make us cower. Let's focus on the Violet Palace for now. We can discuss this further after we return. Fellow Daoist Zhenyi, you have prepared all the materials for the Small North Star Origin Formation, haven't you?"
With Grand Demon Tongyou mediating, Red Hair Ancestor and Elder Zhenyi stopped arguing.
Elder Zhenyi said with some reluctance, "A bet's a bet! I've spent more than ten years collecting them, and I've barely managed to gather everything. Make sure your side doesn't make any mistakes."
Before he finished speaking, a thunderous voice boomed from the seven-colored demonic mist where the Demonkin Hill cultivators were located, "Rest assured, fellow Daoists, I've brought our clan's treasure. It will guarantee success."
"That's good!"
Grand Demon Tongyou said calmly, "Everything is ready, we just need a favorable wind. The spatial rifts ahead are dense, and even we must proceed with caution. I ask all fellow Daoists to put aside your differences and cooperate sincerely."
As he spoke, the Skyfaring Warship had flown close to the four-colored cloud formation, slowing down as it approached.
Finally, the two drew close together and proceeded side by side.
Sure enough, they encountered a spatial rift not far ahead.
This spatial rift shimmered with a milky white light, appearing incredibly thin as it floated in the void, remaining unmoved even when impacted by the spiritual tide.
It was the spiritual tide that suffered.
No matter how large the spiritual tide, it would be easily cut in half upon touching the spatial rift. It was unclear whether the power of the spiritual tide was insufficient, or if the spatial rift was too formidable.
Even with the combined strength of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the two domains, they still dared not provoke the spatial rift and immediately chose to detour.
Initially, the spatial rifts were few, but they became denser the deeper they went, and some were even extremely concealed and difficult to detect.
The danger here was no less than the Inner Valley of the Boundless Valley.
They not only had to withstand the impact of the spiritual tide, but also avoid the spatial rifts, significantly reducing their speed.
Silence fell within the red cloud.
Only the rumbling of the spiritual tide could be heard.
With their safety in the hands of the Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang could only resign himself to fate. He felt the cloud veer left, then right, sometimes even making large detours, unsure when it would end.
He could clearly feel their progress slowing, secretly shocked by the terrifying nature of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield’s core region, a place where even so many Nascent Soul Grandmasters had to proceed with extreme caution.
During their journey, they even encountered sudden dangers several times, forcing them to abruptly turn back, causing everyone to worry.
Time slowly passed.
The Skyfaring Warship and the four-colored cloud formation, seemingly stumbling along, actually progressed steadily without incident.
After flying for a long half-day,
Qin Sang suddenly felt the red cloud stop. Just as he was wondering if they had encountered some unexpected situation, he heard several exclamations from around him, "The Violet Palace!"
Qin Sang's heart stirred. He abruptly stood up and stared ahead.
When he saw the scene before him, he couldn't help but gasp, stunned by the unprecedentedly grand celestial phenomenon!
Ahead lay a desolate desert, its surface pockmarked with deep craters, clearly caused by the impact of the spiritual tide.  Any sand dunes that might have existed were flattened, allowing one to see to the horizon.
Surprisingly, there were no spatial rifts within this vast area.
Deep within the desert, high in the sky,
The sky was no longer filled with the omnipresent spiritual tide, but with a white, typhoon-like vortex of wind and clouds, stretching as far as the eye could see.
No, the spiritual tide wasn’t absent!
The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was trapped within the wind and cloud vortex, unable to escape!
Within the vortex, it appeared remarkably calm, the white clouds seemingly motionless, unlike the violent and turbulent spiritual tide.
The vortex covered the sky and pressed down low, giving Qin Sang an extremely oppressive feeling even from such a distance, a sense of his own insignificance.
Not only Qin Sang, but the expressions of the others also became noticeably grave as they stared blankly at the scene.
The Violet Palace lay at the center of the wind and cloud vortex!
