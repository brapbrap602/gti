<h1>Chapter 635: Entry</h1><p>The Yi Hui Stronghold's cave dwelling was excellent, and the cultivation resources left behind by the priests were abundant. While Qin Sang didn't find them particularly valuable, they could greatly benefit Yagu.</p><p>However, staying at the Yi Hui Stronghold presented two problems. Firstly, the lack of fellow cultivators and guidance from elders would limit her future prospects. Secondly, the distractions of worldly affairs could easily sway someone with insufficient cultivation and an unsteady mind.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Yagu to so decisively abandon the readily available power.  He wasn't oblivious and could guess her thoughts.</p><p>However, they were destined to be apart. Yagu's talent was at the very bottom tier in the cultivation world. Even with the South Border's unique advantage of natal insect gu assisting breakthroughs, her chances of reaching Foundation Establishment and Core Formation were still slim.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't abandon his path of immortality for romantic pursuits either. He had too much to do and would definitely leave the Western Border. He wouldn't stay in one place for long, and it was impractical to bring Yagu along as he wandered.</p><p>To facilitate Yagu's growth, he seized the opportunity and used a rather drastic approach, partly due to time constraints. His trip was solely for repaying a favor, and he wouldn't offer any further involvement.</p><p>Hearing Yagu's decision, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief.  He recalled his own journey seeking immortality, much like Yagu's, resolutely abandoning easily attainable wealth and power. Though their motivations differed, their paths converged.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke seriously, "Have you made up your mind? I can arrange for the Five Venom Sect to accept you. But cultivation is not carefree; it's mostly solitude and hardship. You might regret this in your old age. A life of prosperity might be better."</p><p>Yagu shook her head, "I won't regret going to the Five Venom Sect!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Since Yagu had made her decision, Qin Sang didn't say more and handed her the relics of the Yi Hui Stronghold priests. "Before we leave, do you want to return to the Thousand Households Village?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't asked what happened to Yagu at the Thousand Households Village on the day of the Saintess selection. She now possessed power; if she had unfinished business, he'd let her handle it herself.</p><p>Yagu hesitated. "Can I go see Grandpa Shaman?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, summoned the Ghost Roc Cloud, and flew away from the Yi Hui Stronghold with Yagu.</p><p>…</p><p>Thousand Households Village.</p><p>The moon was bright and the stars sparse.  Because it was the eve of the Shaman Festival, some villagers had gone to the Yi Hui Stronghold to participate in the shamanic rituals, while others went to nearby larger villages for singing competitions.  Not many remained in the village, mostly elderly people. News of the incident at the shamanic ritual hadn't reached them yet, and the Thousand Households Village was peaceful.</p><p>The old Shaman was already sound asleep.</p><p>Two figures stood by the window.</p><p>By the moonlight, Yagu gazed at the old Shaman, her lips pursed, eyes red-rimmed with unshed tears.</p><p>Finally, Yagu took out a bottle of pills that could strengthen blood and qi and prolong life, placed it on the old Shaman's bedside, then knelt outside the window and kowtowed several times.</p><p>Rising, Yagu wiped her eyes and whispered, "Brother Broken Arm, let's go."</p><p>She only wanted to see Grandpa Shaman one last time.</p><p>…</p><p>Five Venom Sect.</p><p>The overlord of the Bear Mountain region.</p><p>Once, the Five Venom Sect not only held sway over the Bear Mountain region, but the surrounding territories also pledged allegiance to it, all thanks to a Core Formation cultivator from the sect. This was exceptionally rare in the barren Western Border.</p><p>Unfortunately, this Core Formation cultivator had no intention of staying in the Western Border.  He had no desire to expand the Five Venom Sect or dominate the region.  Shortly after his breakthrough, he left to travel.</p><p>However, his prestige remained, and the Five Venom Sect did reap considerable benefits. But as time passed, nearly a century had gone by, and there was no news of that Core Formation cultivator. Many suspected he had long since perished.</p><p>Coupled with the lack of successors, the Five Venom Sect had declined.  Now, not only were external forces eyeing them, but even the priests of the large villages in the Bear Mountain region began to harbor different intentions, creating both internal and external troubles.</p><p>The location of the Five Venom Sect's mountain gate was unique. From above, the several peaks surrounding the gate resembled a blooming lotus.  Even in the Western Border, such a picturesque place was rare.</p><p>Qin Sang flew swiftly on his sword, arriving at the Five Venom Sect just as dawn broke.  He was there to retrieve some items as agreed.</p><p>"After you enter, remember not to let anyone know you have the Cold Gold Sword and the Devouring Cone…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his presence. He brought Yagu to the foot of the Five Venom Sect mountain.  He was giving Yagu instructions when a streak of green light flew out from the mountain – it was the Five Venom Sect's leader, Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>"This junior greets Senior Qin!"</p><p>His voice preceded his arrival.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi landed in front of Qin Sang, speaking and acting with utmost respect.  "Senior, please follow me into the mountain. I have prepared spiritual tea."</p><p>"Aren't you afraid I'll cause trouble in the Five Venom Sect if you let me in?"</p><p>A playful smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's expression stiffened, uncertain and apprehensive.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Cui Xuanzi, flew forward with Yagu, and said indifferently, "I have no interest in your Five Venom Sect. I'm here for the agreement we made. How is the information I asked you to gather, and the items I requested, coming along?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi forced a smile, "I have been diligently working on the tasks Senior entrusted to me, and I have indeed made some progress…"</p><p>They conversed as they walked, quickly entering the Five Venom Sect and arriving at the main hall.</p><p>"Not a bad place."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. It was merely "not bad."</p><p>The Five Venom Sect had beautiful scenery and abundant spiritual energy, a rare treasure in the Western Border, but for a Core Formation cultivator, it was still somewhat lacking.</p><p>"Senior, please have tea."</p><p>The three sat facing each other.  Cui Xuanzi personally poured the tea, offered a cup to Yagu, and asked curiously, "Who is this young lady?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied indifferently, "I found the Yi Hui Stronghold's shamanic rituals displeasing, so I conveniently killed all their priests. She was one of their Saintesses. I'm letting her stay at the Five Venom Sect to cultivate for now."</p><p>"Yi Hui Stronghold?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was taken aback.</p><p>Found it displeasing, so conveniently killed them?</p><p>Cui Xuanzi broke out in a cold sweat, secretly shocked.  Hearing Qin Sang's latter words, his heart stirred. Without hesitation, he agreed, "I have also heard of their misdeeds. The Yi Hui Stronghold used human lives to refine medicine and feed their gu insects. Truly vicious! Senior acted righteously by eliminating them! If this young lady wishes to cultivate in the Five Venom Sect, I would be honored.  The best cave dwellings in the sect are at her disposal."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Yagu, "You can stay here and cultivate for a while. If you find it suitable, you can become Leader Cui Xuanzi's disciple. I'm sure he won't refuse."</p><p>During the month at the Yi Hui Stronghold, while guiding Yagu, Qin Sang also wandered around the Bear Mountain region, searching for ancient teleportation formations. During this time, he contacted several village priests and learned that the Five Venom Sect had a decent reputation.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately avoided explaining his relationship with Yagu. After he left, the Five Venom Sect wouldn't dare mistreat her in the short term.  By the time they realized the truth, Yagu's cultivation would have improved, and with powerful tools like the Cold Gold Sword and the Devouring Cone, she could decide for herself whether to stay or leave.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Writer's block.
