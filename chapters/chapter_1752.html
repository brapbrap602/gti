<h1>Chapter 1743: The Dharma Image</h1><p>Pain struck, but Qin Sang was not alarmed; instead, he felt a surge of joy.</p><p>From the Inferno of Divine Transformation, to the Shining Gold Sword Cave, and then to the Dragon Transformation Pool.</p><p>In just a few decades, Qin Sang had undergone three body tempering trials, enduring pain that would be unbearable for any ordinary person.</p><p>Without these trials, his "Celestial Demon Refining Form" cultivation technique would not have progressed so rapidly.</p><p>The Dragon Transformation Pool's liquid seemed to contain an unknown power.  It was imperceptible outside the pool, but once inside the body, dramatic changes occurred. Qin Sang felt as if countless bolts of lightning were coursing through his limbs, penetrating his bone marrow, meridians, and internal organs, bringing excruciating pain with each passage.</p><p>His bones crackled, his blood surged, and his skin turned crimson. In an instant, his blood energy exploded, forming a thick blood mist that merged with the spiritual mist of the pool.</p><p>At the boundary, the blood mist and spiritual mist seemed to blend, undergoing a strange transformation. Then the blood mist recoiled and was reabsorbed into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>This process repeated endlessly.</p><p>Each time the blood energy returned, Qin Sang felt the intense pain ease slightly, experiencing a moment of relief.</p><p>But this relief was short-lived. The recovery speed was far slower than the rate of destruction. The Dragon Transformation Pool's liquid might not be as intense as the Shining Gold Sword Cave's, but it was perfectly suited to the Jiao dragon bloodline, instantly surging through the body, leaving no time to breathe. Only a Jiao dragon body could withstand such an impact.</p><p>At this rate, Qin Sang would be forced to leave the pool, yet the ancient prohibitions of the pool allowed only this one chance.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king stood by the Dragon Transformation Pool, watching Qin Sang tremble uncontrollably. He stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>The smile froze on his face.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king stared intently at Qin Sang, who suddenly trembled, emitting incredibly pure demonic energy. A flash of blue light appeared behind him, and a pair of azure wings unfurled.</p><p>He nearly snapped his beard, filled with surprise and uncertainty.</p><p>Then, an even more astonishing sight appeared.  A strange aura gathered above Qin Sang's head, and after a moment, a phantom of a blue-green phoenix appeared – lively and graceful, with a slender body and feathers like forged metal, exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>The moment the phantom appeared, the spiritual mist seemed to recoil in fear.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king, unaware that this was a Dharma Image (of the blue-green phoenix), thought it was merely Qin Sang's extremely abundant blood energy manifesting as a strange phenomenon. This wasn't uncommon among the demon race, but he couldn't understand why his blood energy would manifest as a blue-green phoenix.</p><p>After looking a few more times, he felt something was wrong.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king's face changed drastically. He suddenly recalled a legend from his clan, his pupils dilated, and his heart was greatly shocked.</p><p>"A Dharma Image?"</p><p>Although the blue-green phoenix above Qin Sang's head was incredibly illusory, its outline was not very clear, and it couldn't even be considered a true phantom. And judging by his actions, he couldn't control it.</p><p>But it did resemble the Dharma Image described in clan legends!</p><p>Given Qin Sang's mastery of physical cultivation, it was simply impossible for him to condense a Dharma Image, especially since he was clearly human.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king instinctively wanted to take a closer look, but suddenly felt a tremor in the pool beneath his feet. Looking down, he was shocked.</p><p>A vortex had appeared in the pool's liquid, originating from Qin Sang. A powerful suction force emanated from him, like a bottomless pit, drawing the liquid into his body. The water level visibly dropped, and even the spiritual mist thinned.</p><p>In a moment, a loud laugh was heard, and a beam of blue light shot out from the Dragon Transformation Pool, leaving only a thin layer of liquid in the pool.</p><p>Qin Sang, with wings on his back and the Dharma Image still unfurled, landed beside the Jiao dragon king. He bowed respectfully, a smile on his face.  "Thank you for the use of your clan's precious pool. I need to retreat immediately. I'll leave these spiritual treasures with you; when you find the artifact, you can send it along then."</p><p>Without waiting for the Jiao dragon king's reply, Qin Sang eagerly left the Jiao dragon ancestral land and returned to his magic boat.</p><p>The Jiao dragon king's expression fluctuated between anger and gloom as he looked at the jade box, devoid of any joy. Finally, he sighed, waved his sleeve, and put it away.</p><p>The depletion of such a large amount of Dragon Transformation Pool's liquid would inevitably impact the clan's strength. He could only console himself that, thanks to Qin Sang's mediation, there should be no war for the next few hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the magic boat and sat down to meditate.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of the Jiao clan going back on their word, but after absorbing so much liquid, he needed to immediately regulate his energy.</p><p>At the last moment, he had a flash of insight and, mimicking the Dharma Image, channeled the blue-green phoenix's lightning power to draw the pool's liquid, and it had unexpectedly succeeded. Now, he was using the Dharma Image to contain the liquid.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, the Dharma Image has such miraculous powers. I need to study this carefully when I have the time…"</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Jiao Long Wang returned to the flying vessel, presenting a jade box filled with treasures to aid Qin Sang's cultivation.  The Jiao Long clan alone couldn't provide so many; some originated from other tribes, but having passed through his hands, they were undoubtedly enhanced.</p><p>He wished to meet Qin Sang in person, but Qin Sang was unavailable.  A manifested form of Qin Sang briefly appeared, bowing slightly. "Thank you for your trouble, Daoist friend.  I've been a burden for too long and must depart."</p><p>With that, the vessel shuddered and sliced through the waves.</p><p>Heading east from the Jiao Long ancestral lands led directly to Tian Wu Island.</p><p>Currently, the Wu tribe could only cling to Tian Wu Island, surrounded by enemy troops.  Wu cultivators barely dared to leave, feeling trapped.</p><p>Approaching Tian Wu Island,</p><p>Qin Sang finally emerged from seclusion, inwardly sensing his state, and was astonished.</p><p>The energy within the spiritual liquid, which he initially believed to be useless and requiring expulsion, had almost entirely been refined and absorbed.  Even the Jiao Long couldn't achieve this!</p><p>It must be the work of the Azure Bird dharma form.</p><p>This meant he could reach the late Fourth Stage without waiting for complete absorption!</p><p>Diligent cultivation truly couldn't compare to bolstering oneself with the resources of a realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, locating the complete ingredients for the superior Spirit-Calming Incense proved difficult; he'd found only one of the rare herbs after searching two realms.</p><p>"I hope the Wu tribe holds a pleasant surprise for me…"</p><p>Calculating the distance, Qin Sang withdrew the vessel and his manifested form, adjusting his right sleeve.</p><p>Zhu Que refused to return to the Qian Jun ring, so the Sun God Tree remained in his sleeve. Fortunately, Zhu Que could somewhat control its aura, preventing its leakage and eliminating the need for concealment.</p><p>He silently slipped through the enemy lines and landed on Tian Wu Island.</p><p>Tian Wu Island’s layout hadn’t changed much from centuries ago, leaving Qin Sang with a sense of profound change.  Soon he reached a hall, where a Wu elder approached. Upon seeing Qin Sang’s credentials, the elder immediately bowed. "This humble one greets the envoy."</p><p>This person, although from the Wu tribe, was a secret agent for the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>"Has the person been found?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The elder nodded repeatedly.  "Only one true disciple of the Black Serpent lineage remains, hiding on the island.  Though he concealed his lineage, it didn't escape my notice; I've had people watching him."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't speak further, but after learning the address, he vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>In a courtyard within the city, a young man in black robes sat in meditation when he sensed something amiss.  Opening his eyes, he saw a figure standing before him, the surrounding restrictions having failed to react.</p><p>The young man was terrified, quickly summoning a long blade. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Are you a true disciple of the Black Serpent Ancestor's lineage?" Qin Sang asked, hands behind his back, his stance superior.</p><p>The young man seemed to have anticipated this, giving a bitter smile.</p><p>After the Black Serpent Ancestor's disappearance, the Black Serpent Mountain lineage declined; their sect was even usurped.</p><p>This was partly due to Qin Sang, who had eliminated nearly all the ancestor's true disciples, including his most favored senior disciple.</p><p>Though the ancestor took on new disciples, finding talented individuals was challenging.  He could maintain the sect's standing during his lifetime, but after his fall, Black Serpent Mountain rapidly crumbled, its survivors scattered and destitute.</p><p>Had the Black Serpent Ancestor not had few enemies, and had the Wu tribe not been beset by internal and external strife, their sect would have been destroyed long ago by other Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Forbidden to fight on Tian Wu Island, the remaining disciples hid, but the Three-Race War caught up to them.  Many died in battle, leaving only the young man.</p><p>He’d believed that after centuries, the old conflicts had faded, leading to his negligence.</p><p>Now confronted, realizing the man's aura suggested a Yuan Ying master—someone unaffected by any rules—the young man understood his fate. If he were killed, would the Great Wu Priest seek justice?</p><p>Knowing he was doomed, the young man found unexpected ferocity, gripping his blade, determined to fight back, no matter the outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, a light flying from his hand.  "Have you ever seen this?"</p><p>The young man paused, looking closer at the circular stone platform, unfamiliar yet oddly familiar.  After a moment's reflection, he remembered.</p><p>Seeing the young man's changed expression, Qin Sang said, "Tell me all you know."</p><p>A young man, seeing that the visitor wasn't there to seek revenge, quickly knelt down, saying, "Forgive my boldness, senior. My master once mentioned this matter casually.  My grandmaster ordered a disciple to search for a stone platform, said to be an ancient treasure from the sacred Wushan, which the High Priest and elders are also searching for. My grandmaster strictly forbade mentioning it, but I am of low standing and didn't understand the truth…"</p><p>Years ago, during the Qisha Hall's ascension, many powerful Wu tribe members were trapped in the inner hall, pulverized by spatial storms. Black Serpent Ancestor was among them.</p><p>Black Serpent Ancestor died in the Qisha Hall, leaving behind no possessions or clues.  The young man racked his brains but could offer nothing further.  Fearing Qin Sang's wrath, he hurriedly presented all the sect's texts he had brought, inviting Qin Sang to examine them.</p><p>After skimming the texts, finding nothing useful, Qin Sang looked towards the teleportation hall, thoughtfully murmuring, "Wushan…"</p><p>The young man remained kneeling, only daring to raise his head after a long while, finding the room empty. Relieved, he collapsed, drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the teleportation hall.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal her identity, her sleeves billowing as she ascended the steps.</p><p>The guards were about to stop her, but were halted. Three figures descended from the sky, all Wu tribe elders. After glancing at Qin Sang, their faces showed astonishment, and they quickly bowed, "Greetings, Master Qin."</p><p>Recently, both humans and demons have been active, not escaping their notice. The Four Saints Palace had also sent a messenger.</p><p>Unsure of Qin Sang's arrival time, Wushan had stationed elders here.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the area, noticing the absence of Elder Fang.</p><p>An elder bowed, "The High Priest is holding a banquet at Wushan and has ordered us to welcome you."</p><p>The three elders, like stars surrounding the moon, accompanied Qin Sang to Wushan via the teleportation array.</p><p>Exiting the teleportation hall, Qin Sang saw many Wu tribe Nascent Soul cultivators waiting, led by a slender elder in black robes.  Qin Sang immediately recognized him as a transformed spirit body, with a spirit cicada resting on his head.</p><p>The cicada was as translucent as jade, its thin wings adorned with starlight.</p><p>Starwing Cicada!</p><p>Qin Sang vividly remembered that moment, secretly thinking,  "Could this elder be Elder Fang's original form?"</p><p>"Greetings, Master Qin. My apologies for not greeting you personally,"  Elder Fang, now the High Priest, stepped forward, bowing deeply. His gaze held a complex expression.</p><p>His demeanor was indistinguishable from a normal person; only someone with Qin Sang's keen perception could detect the anomaly.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed Elder Fang, noticing his aura was no weaker than a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.  Unexpectedly, his cultivation hadn't diminished after losing a life-bound insect; instead, it had increased.</p><p>His ability to appear in human form might be due to his enhanced cultivation and some new power. Could he even rebuild his physical body?</p><p>Looking at the composed elder, Qin Sang was astonished, recalling their first meeting.  How arrogant and unruly Elder Fang had been then!  The mere sound of his cicada had terrified human Nascent Soul cultivators, even the Wu tribe's High Priest couldn't control him.</p><p>It seemed Elder Fang's position as High Priest wasn't a mere title. Qin Sang had also heard Bao Zhengnan and others discuss Elder Fang's leadership of the Wu tribe, how he had repeatedly saved them from disaster, demonstrating his dedication and impartiality.</p><p>The Wu tribe had faced numerous calamities; their survival to this day was largely due to Elder Fang.  His past act of entrusting his life to another had finally touched him.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang returned the courtesy, "We're old acquaintances, who once shared hardships.  Why the formalities, Daoist Fang?"</p><p>"Indeed, we are old friends, Master Qin. I'm honored that you still remember this old man…"</p><p>Elder Fang sighed.</p><p>Having received Bao Zhengnan's message, he recalled the person.  Back then, he had been arrogant, and Qin Sang wasn't even a Nascent Soul cultivator; he hadn't given her a second glance.</p><p>Who could have imagined the changes? Among the younger generation, Bao Zhengnan could stand on equal footing with him, yet this person had surpassed him, reaching the realm countless cultivators dreamt of, a true paragon of the world.</p><p>"Master Qin’s talent is extraordinary.  How foolish I was back then…"</p><p>Elder Fang shook his head with a wry smile, gesturing to the side, "I have prepared some humble wine, though I fear it won't meet your standards."</p><p>Qin Sang politely accepted.</p><p>A light rain fell.</p><p>The teleportation hall was located below the mountain's midsection.  Above it lay the Wu tribe's forbidden grounds and the High Priest's residence, accessible only with permission.</p><p>Intending to observe Wushan, Qin Sang didn't use her flight abilities; Elder Fang and the others could only follow her slowly up the steps.</p><p>Raindrops pattered on the leaves, creating a refreshing sound.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. Dark clouds covered Wushan's peak. It was night outside, yet the mountain was bright as day.</p><p>A hundred-mile radius was enveloped in dark clouds, with lightning dancing and serpents of electricity flashing.  The thunder was blocked by the mountain's formations, the same as when Qin Sang first saw it.</p><p>She had heard the legends about Wushan, a sacred mountain revered by the Wu tribe, with its perennial thunderclouds, considered a divine miracle.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the clouds and thunder were ordinary natural phenomena, seemingly nothing unusual, but that was precisely the most abnormal aspect!</p><p>Wushan Continent wasn't a humid region; ordinary clouds couldn't remain perpetually.</p><p>She glanced at Elder Fang; with so many people around, she didn't say anything, deciding to ask later after the banquet.</p><p>Upon entering the banquet hall, they took their seats.  Servants gracefully served fruits and wine.</p><p>After a few drinks, Qin Sang brought up the purpose of her visit, "My reason for coming, are you all aware?"</p><p>The Wu tribe's high-ranking members put down their cups, attentively listening.</p><p>Elder Fang said gravely, "Palace Master Bao sent a secret message; we know something, but many details are unclear.  Please enlighten us, Master Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and explained everything.</p><p>(End)</p>
