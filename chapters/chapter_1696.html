<h1>Chapter 1687: Demonic Tail</h1><p>Awakening the Gu King within his body was indeed an extremely risky move.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang guided the venomous light towards the Giant Demon Soul and activated the Poison Pearl, creating a barrier of poison-repelling aura around himself, he still couldn't completely prevent the residual poison from seeping into his body.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sun God Tree instantly drained his True Essence, almost causing the poison to erupt within him.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated the Sun God Tree's consumption, and simultaneously swallowed a Boiling Snow Pellet. He then experienced a sensation of extreme highs and lows.</p><p>His True Essence was depleted, plunging him into a weakness he hadn't felt since his breakthrough.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the Boiling Snow Pellet dissolved within him, its medicinal power transforming into extremely pure vital energy. However, unlike other medicinal pellets, it wasn't gentle; its power practically exploded.</p><p>The medicinal power surged like an avalanche, like a bursting dam, treating Qin Sang's body as a flood plain.  A torrential wave of vital energy suddenly rushed towards his limbs and meridians.</p><p>His meridians were instantly subjected to a massive influx of vital energy. Even with Qin Sang's Nascent Soul late-stage cultivation, this exceeded his limits.</p><p>It was the first time Qin Sang had encountered such a violent medicinal pellet. The description of its effects on the prescription wasn't an exaggeration. Genuine, searing pain emanated from his meridians. Multiple meridians tore, flesh ruptured, and his entire body trembled.</p><p>With the replenishment of vital energy, he could quickly recover from his weakened state.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't afford to divert his attention to regulate the vital energy within him. He only had time to forcibly stabilize a portion of it, suppress the poison within, and appease the Gu King.</p><p>Compared to the invading venomous light, the Gu King was the most dangerous. If it sensed a threat and sprayed a few more streams of venomous light, Qin Sang would also suffer greatly.</p><p>He held his breath, exerting all his strength to stabilize his Sea of Qi, preventing the Gu King from being affected or sensing his weakness.</p><p>The Gu King showed no trace of blood. The pure white, lustrous beetle resembled a jade carving, an exquisite piece of art. No one would suspect it was an incredibly dangerous venomous insect.</p><p>The Gu King's eyes moved, its gaze showing a hint of confusion. Just awakened by the sudden, sharp sword intent, it instinctively reacted. But after it regained its senses, it found everything around it was normal, with no fatal threat.</p><p>Its wings fluttered slightly.</p><p>The Gu King clearly sensed the Cloud Wanderer Sword's intent, different from the previous killing intent. This sword intent was gentle, but it carried the wood element aura that it feared most. From the moment it gained sentience, it had been suppressed by the Strange-Faced Man's divine ability, leaving a deep-seated imprint on its soul.</p><p>Surrounding it was a seven-colored radiance, also an aura it detested.</p><p>Blinking its eyes, the Gu King wrapped its wings around itself in a protective posture and fell silent.</p><p>"Phew..."</p><p>Once the Gu King went dormant, Qin Sang let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Although this move was risky, the outcome was favorable, and at the time, there were no better options.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang immediately mobilized the power of the Poison Pearl to suppress the residual poison within him.</p><p>During this process, his original body was restrained by the Gu King, hindering his movement.  His subsequent attacks on Su Zinan were all carried out by his avatar. This was, of course, because Qin Sang saw that Su Zinan was engulfed by the spiritual fire, with no chance of escape, and there was no need to take further risks.  However, he remained secretly vigilant.</p><p>His avatar shattered the Thousand Worlds Mirror and successfully captured Su Zinan's damaged Nascent Soul.</p><p>But there was still an unexpected turn of events.</p><p>The eruption of the six divine birds was more powerful than anticipated. It not only disrupted the formation, but also shook the very foundation of the spiritual array, tearing apart the Seven Stellar Domains Sword Formation!</p><p>It should be known that the Five Elements Divine Restriction was established by the combined efforts of the entire Formless Immortal Sect. Each sword star within the sword formation was meticulously refined by the top sword cultivators of the Gold Aspect lineage, maintained by the five elements' mutual generation, and connected to the earth veins, unchanging for ten thousand years.</p><p>If the sword formation had been smaller, it might not have merely been torn apart.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated that the sword formation wouldn't be able to conceal the fluctuations of the Southern Brightfire, and would definitely be detected by Nascent Soul cultivators. If it hadn't been exposed, it would have aroused suspicion, perhaps giving him some breathing room.</p><p>But he hadn't expected the sword formation to be torn apart, exposing him directly to everyone's view.</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Five-colored radiance had already engulfed half the mountain peak. A void abruptly appeared within the vast radiance, continuously spewing fire.</p><p>Those unaware might have thought it was a conflict within the Five Elements Divine Restriction, with the fire element bursting through.</p><p>The Southern Brightfire erupted within the sword formation, and most of the spiritual fire was vented within the formation.  The portion that escaped after tearing the formation still caused quite a commotion.</p><p>Within the fissure, at the edge of the raging flames, two figures flickered in and out of view. They were Qin Sang's original body and his avatar.</p><p>The avatar had just captured Su Zinan's Nascent Soul.</p><p>The original body seemed stunned, looking upwards. Those with keen eyesight could see his abnormal state. His face was ashen and weak, his body bathed in blood, and his aura was extremely chaotic, clearly displaying signs of severe injury and uncontrolled True Essence.</p><p>"What's that in his hand?"</p><p>South of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, three figures hovered above a palace that resembled a temple.</p><p>The three were jointly working to break the restrictions on the palace. Attracted by the commotion on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, they all looked over. Two looked at Qin Sang's original body, while the other, a Daoist robe-clad man, was drawn to the avatar.</p><p>"It looks like a Nascent Soul..."</p><p>His companions shifted their gaze, and one said hoarsely.</p><p>Those who dared to remain on Emperor Bestowal Mountain at this time were definitely not weak, yet one had met such a tragic end, even his Nascent Soul was captured, unable to escape.</p><p>The damaged Nascent Soul was retrieved by the avatar. In a fleeting glance, they couldn't see the Nascent Soul's face clearly, only seeing smoke rising from it, as if it had been scorched by fire.</p><p>The Daoist robe-clad man had met Su Zinan before, and seemed to recognize something, feeling a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>"That damaged Nascent Soul seems like..."</p><p>He opened his mouth, then suddenly froze, not daring to speak the name, finding it too unbelievable.</p><p>Within the Gold Aspect Hall.</p><p>The old nun stared intently at the Suspended Lake, her expression tense.</p><p>First the purple lightning tribulation, then the appearance of a Nascent Soul cultivator. She had originally intended to lead her disciples to immediately withdraw from the Formless Immortal Sect. Unexpectedly, her junior sister sent a message, saying they had found a crucial secret hall within the Gold Aspect Hall, but it would take some time to break the formation.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator was held back by the Ancient Demon, giving them more time. The old nun decided to take the risk, ordering her junior sister to break the formation as quickly as possible. She kept watch on the battle above, knowing that if the situation changed, she would have to decisively retreat, painfully abandoning the treasure.</p><p>Liu Li's whereabouts also worried the old nun.</p><p>With Nascent Soul cultivators gathering at the legacy grounds and powerful figures abounding, the Formless Immortal Sect had become a place of strife. They, the 'remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect,' couldn't stay long. She wondered where Liu Li was and whether she would be able to retreat with them.</p><p>The radiance split open, and crimson fire soared into the sky.</p><p>The old nun was also startled, instinctively looking over. Her gaze only lingered on the mountain for a moment before she looked towards the western horizon. Seeing a familiar streak of light rapidly approaching, her mind eased slightly.</p><p>The newcomer was Liu Li.</p><p>Liu Li flew on her sword, her gaze fixed on the figures within the fissure in the Divine Restriction, her expression grave.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the old nun, she went to search for the Immortal Palace.  Following the two locations the old nun had indicated, she first went to the Northern Forbidden Grounds. After venturing deep within, she realized it couldn't be the passage to the Immortal Palace. She then retreated from the forbidden grounds and rushed to the precipice, where she found a ruined teleportation formation.</p><p>Liu Li knew about the Immortal Palace's ascension, and upon seeing this, she could basically guess what had happened.</p><p>The appearance of top-tier cultivators on Emperor Bestowal Mountain one after another confirmed that something had also happened to the Central State Immortal Palace.</p><p>The matters of the Immortal Palace could only be put aside for now. Liu Li then considered her own situation. She recalled discovering some unusual aspects deep within the Northern Forbidden Grounds, hints of opportunity, and thus returned there.</p><p>Just as she was about to enter the forbidden grounds, the Ancient Demon broke its seal, and the Nascent Soul cultivator appeared.</p><p>Unexpectedly, from afar, Liu Li saw a familiar figure, the avatar Qin Sang had left behind with Wise Light Venerable. Only then did she realize Qin Sang was also here.</p><p>She didn't know whether the avatar was acting alone, or if Qin Sang's original body was also trapped on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Targeted by a Nascent Soul cultivator, the outcome was uncertain. Even if it was only an avatar that perished here, it would be a grievous loss. Although Liu Li had entered monastic life due to the imprint and deliberately distanced herself from Qin Sang, she knew in her heart that he wasn't to blame.</p><p>She had faced life and death with Qin Sang, journeying together through the storm for decades. She couldn't stand idly by and watch him die, no matter what.  Liu Li decisively abandoned entering the forbidden grounds and returned on her sword, hoping to offer some assistance.</p><p>As expected, before she arrived, Qin Sang's original body had already appeared, creating quite a spectacle in full view of everyone.</p><p>"It's the Sun God Birds..."</p><p>Liu Li recognized the crimson fire.</p><p>Judging by its power, it surpassed the combined might of the previous three divine birds. This showed that Qin Sang had definitely achieved a breakthrough, and not recently, or he wouldn't be able to control more Sun God Birds.</p><p>Hidden for so long, only to be exposed at this time!</p><p>Liu Li's delicate brows furrowed slightly, and her speed increased by a third.</p><p>The Suspended Lake was stained with ink-black.</p><p>The demonic body unleashed its ferocious might.</p><p>Five-colored spiritual light shot out incessantly, chaotic and uncontrolled.  Among them, demonic claws flashed frequently, sometimes as small as a human hand, sometimes large enough to hold up the sky, their power varying greatly.  A mere touch would cause injury, a direct hit would result in death.</p><p>Several Grand Cultivators were preoccupied with defending themselves, indignant yet不敢言.</p><p>Since their breakthrough to Nascent Soul late-stage, when had they been so dishevelled?</p><p>However, although the demonic body's power was terrifying, because the demonic spirit was driven mad, its attacks were without method, only relentless assault.  While dodging was incredibly difficult for them, as time passed, they became familiar with the demonic body's methods and gradually gained some insights.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic battle, everyone anxiously watched the progress of the Demon Sealing Stake's restoration.</p><p>Enveloped by Wise Light Venerable's Heart Fire, the Demon Sealing Stake was akin to being thrown into a furnace.  Its surface shimmered with Heart Fire, as if it were melting.</p><p>In reality, this was merely an illusion; the Demon Sealing Stake itself was unharmed.</p><p>The restrictions within were activated by the Heart Fire, emitting a faint black light, particularly strong at the point of fracture. This indicated that Wise Light Venerable had a plan and had begun to activate the restrictions.</p><p>The broken ends of the Demon Sealing Stake were incredibly smooth, fitting together seamlessly.</p><p>Now, a noticeable gap appeared between the two sections. The formless Heart Fire spread along the crack, even penetrating into the stake's interior.</p><p>At this moment, the lotus platform beneath Wise Light Venerable transformed. Dense runes appeared on the lotus petals, which Qin Sang would find familiar if he saw them.</p><p>They were similar to the formation that his senior sister and Bai had devised to work in conjunction with the Demon Binding Rope, the very Demon Subduing Formation that Wise Light Venerable had mentioned.</p><p>Wise Light Venerable didn't have a formation diagram and could only divert his attention to temporarily inscribe it on the lotus platform. This action had a deeper meaning.  As the Demon Subduing Formation was completed, the Demon Sealing Stake's luster suddenly brightened, resonating with the formation.</p><p>Serving as a guide, the Demon Subduing Formation also aided in comprehending the restrictions on the Demon Sealing Stake. Wise Light Venerable's furrowed brows gradually relaxed as his fingers moved like a wheel, continuously forming various profound Buddhist hand seals.</p><p>The hand seals transformed into golden light, merging into the Demon Sealing Stake.</p><p>Initially, there were no obvious signs, but as time passed, a faint golden light emerged from within the crack, and the aura of the Demon Sealing Stake began to change.</p><p>"At this rate, we should be able to hold on until Wise Light Venerable repairs the Demon Sealing Stake."</p><p>This was the thought of Old Demon Fan and the others.  Seeing Wise Light Venerable's progress going smoothly, they all breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Azure Fox Holy King had a more accurate grasp of the situation and was even more optimistic.</p><p>The Suspended Lake had almost completely turned ink-black, looking like a demonic lake tainted by demonic energy. Even the heavenly pillar formed by the phoenix hairpin was shrouded in demonic qi, obscuring its true form.</p><p>This was all deliberately done by Azure Fox Holy King.  As the saying goes, it's better to guide than to block.  After stabilizing the situation, she attempted to intentionally reveal flaws, setting bait and creating opportunities for the demonic body.</p><p>It appeared extremely dangerous, but in reality, it was easier to handle than at the beginning.</p><p>Those present were all seasoned, top-tier cultivators, perfectly executing Azure Fox Holy King's will. Of course, they were able to do this because of the Demon Sealing Stake, giving them the confidence to disregard their expenditure and entangle with the demonic body.</p><p>The bright moon remained pure.  The clear moon was the cornerstone of the Suspended Lake. Azure Fox Holy King's robes fluttered, her figure high in the sky, extremely close to the moon, resembling a celestial fairy.</p><p>She controlled the overall situation, observing the demonic body's every move, until the change occurred on the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, even across the Suspended Lake, he could meet those seductive eyes. He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his eyes, as if his heart had been seen through, and his heart pounded violently.</p><p>Seeing the crimson fire tearing through the radiance, Azure Fox Holy King raised an eyebrow, her eyes narrowing with a flash of cold light.</p><p>Then, Azure Fox Holy King glanced at Wise Light Venerable from the corner of her eye.</p><p>Wise Light Venerable sat in meditation on the lotus platform, completely focused, single-mindedly manipulating the Heart Fire, seemingly unaware of the changes below.</p><p>The Southern Brightfire was ultimately a rootless fire.</p><p>After tearing the Seven Stellar Domains Sword Formation, the crimson fire weakened, its eruption quickly ceasing.  Just as the boulder-like fireballs were still dancing in the void, the five-colored radiance began to counterattack.</p><p>Especially the earth and water element Divine Restrictions on either side of the sword formation, taking advantage of the chaos, pressed inwards. The mountain rumbled incessantly. Under the violent impact, the summit began to tilt, the mountain on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The fissure in the radiance was about to close.</p><p>Qin Sang's original body seemed to sense something, a flicker of unease in his eyes. He forcibly suppressed the chaotic vital energy within him, his figure trembling as he and his avatar plunged deeper into the radiance.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Azure Fox Holy King's lips.</p><p>The three fox tails on her body suddenly detached, transforming into three streaks of light that shot downwards.  They weren't directed at the demonic body, but instead passed through the Suspended Lake, heading straight for the fissure in the radiance.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>A cold snort echoed, audible to all, causing everyone's expression to change.</p><p>"So it was you!  Slaughtering my disciples, gravely injuring my beloved general, and you dare appear before me!"</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The streaks of light plummeted.</p><p>The radiance on either side of the fissure suddenly paused for an instant.</p><p>In that moment, an astonishing pressure descended from the heavens. The three streaks of light reappeared as fox tails, but with a flicker, they transformed into three figures, each as seductive and enchanting as Azure Fox Holy King, identical in appearance and attire.</p><p>The figures appeared somewhat illusory, seemingly a divine ability similar to a Dharma Body, yet the pressure they exuded was no different from the presence of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>With composed expressions and graceful postures, they stepped into the fissure in the radiance.</p>
