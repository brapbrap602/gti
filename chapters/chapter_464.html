<h1>Chapter 457: Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris</h1><p>The Serpent Mistress continued, "As you've likely guessed, you're not the only ones who've entered the Sky Point Peak. You'll be competing with cultivators from the Heavenly Path Alliance for the Star Yuan Stones. Their strength is comparable to yours.  If you encounter them, don't underestimate them. Otherwise, not only will you fail to retrieve the Star Yuan Stones, you might lose your life on Sky Point Peak with no one to even bury you."</p><p>After such a long war, everyone standing here had blood on their hands.</p><p>None of them were soft-hearted.</p><p>They knew what to do without the Serpent Mistress needing to say it.</p><p>A meticulous cultivator spoke up, "Island Master, may I ask how many from the Heavenly Path Alliance have entered Sky Point Peak?"</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao, who had been standing beside the Serpent Mistress, spoke for the first time, "Thirty-three, the same as you."</p><p>The cultivator sneered, "Thirty-three...It seems we're all old friends."</p><p>"Let me tell you about Sky Point Peak..."</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao tapped his hand in the air, and a majestic peak materialized, "This is the full view of Sky Point Peak. The Star Yuan Stones are on top..."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others carefully observed the illusion and listened to Deputy Island Master Xiao's explanation.</p><p>A full quarter of an hour passed before Deputy Island Master Xiao finished.  He dispelled the illusion with a wave of his hand and said, "These are only a small fraction of the dangers on Sky Point Peak. Due to its unique restrictions, much of it remains unexplored. You must be extremely cautious.  The Sky Point Peak opening is short, you cannot waste a moment, and must search for the Star Yuan Stones with all your might. Finally, Observation Star Island will reward you based on the number of Star Yuan Stones you retrieve. The treasures are here..."</p><p>With that, Deputy Island Master Xiao gestured, and several beams of light shot out from his waist like rainbows.</p><p>For a moment, the golden hall was filled with dazzling light, almost blinding everyone.</p><p>Ten beams of light floated before them, each containing a treasure – elixirs, pills, talismans, and magical artifacts.</p><p>All ten treasures were unique, yet each was a precious item!</p><p>Upon seeing these treasures, the eyes of Qin Sang and the others lit up with intense desire.  They stared, their eyes wide with eagerness, examining each one in turn.</p><p>"That's the Gui Fu Dan, a miraculous healing elixir!"</p><p>"That talisman…it's a treasure talisman!  A protective treasure talisman!"</p><p>"What kind of artifact is that?  It emits such a terrifying aura!"</p><p>"Is that the Xuan Zhen Dan?  They say it helps with Golden Core formation…"</p><p>…</p><p>Excited exclamations filled the golden hall.</p><p>However, this commotion was short-lived.  The golden hall fell into deathly silence.</p><p>Almost everyone's gaze was fixed on the leftmost beam of light. Even Qin Sang, known for his composure, couldn't help but feel a ripple in his eyes.</p><p>The others reacted even more intensely than Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the beam of light were two herbs.</p><p>One white, one red, beautifully contrasting each other.</p><p>The white herb resembled a blooming lotus flower, pure white from petal to root, without a single speck of impurity, incredibly pristine and possessing a cold aura.</p><p>It seemed like a sacred herb, not to be profaned.</p><p>A strange chill emanated from it, yet cultivators wouldn’t be harmed by the cold.</p><p>It possessed a name that drove all Foundation Establishment cultivators mad – the Snow Spirit Lotus!</p><p>The other herb was called the Iris Flower!</p><p>Unlike the Snow Spirit Lotus, the Iris Flower was flamboyant, bright red as fire, its long petals overlapping like a phoenix tail.</p><p>The Iris Flower emanated a warm yang energy.</p><p>The two herbs, one yin and one yang, were incredibly compatible, perfectly complementing the Yin-Yang harmony of the Golden Core path.</p><p>Indeed, the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, when used together, were considered the most effective aids to Golden Core formation in the current cultivation world.</p><p>They didn’t need to be refined into pills; they could be directly refined during the Golden Core formation process.</p><p>Of course, having them didn’t guarantee Golden Core formation.</p><p>The success rate of Golden Core formation was notoriously low, like a million soldiers crossing a single-plank bridge.  Those who succeeded needed both exceptional luck and talent.</p><p>Even with the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, the success rate could only be increased by one or two percent—still pitifully low.</p><p>Even more frustrating was the fact that more herbs didn't necessarily increase the success rate.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the Kan Li Golden Core Pill given by his sect, but even if he obtained the Iris Flower and Snow Spirit Lotus, the effects wouldn't stack.</p><p>He could only try them one at a time.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao smiled at everyone, waiting for them to calm down before saying, “You see these spiritual treasures? After you leave the Zhitain Peak, whoever obtains the most Star Stones will be the first to choose.”</p><p>Someone quickly asked, “Does this also apply to the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao pointed to the radiant glow, “I don't need to explain how precious these two herbs are.  None of you would not want them. Unfortunately, Stargazer Island only has one pair. Whoever contributes the most, obtaining the most Star Stones, gets them! Of course, if you don't want the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, you're free to choose other treasures.”</p><p>Most present were at the peak of the False Core stage or close to it, on the verge of Core Formation. Who wouldn't want the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower?</p><p>Even Ji Wu, who had been fixated on the Gui Fu Pill, shifted his gaze after seeing the two herbs, forgetting his master.</p><p>But, there was only one pair of these herbs!</p><p>Fortunately, among the ten radiant glows, there were five other treasures that aided Core Formation, including the Xuanzhen Pill,  with varying effectiveness, but all a tier lower than the two herbs.</p><p>Stargazer Island clearly understood their motivations, knowing how to incentivize them to fight.</p><p>Each item was rare and difficult to find—only Stargazer Island could possess such a collection.</p><p>Unfortunately, even six spiritual treasures were a drop in the ocean for the thirty-three people present.</p><p>And there were only ten glows, meaning only ten people would receive rewards.  The rest would have traveled for nothing!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao waved his sleeve, and the radiant glows disappeared.</p><p>With the treasures gone, disappointment was etched on everyone's faces, but no one dared to confront Deputy Island Master Xiao.</p><p>"Everyone understands?"</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao scanned the crowd, disregarding their inner thoughts, and said calmly, "If you want the treasures, return to your secluded chambers, cultivate to peak condition, and await orders. Now, you may go."</p><p>With that, Deputy Island Master Xiao and the Serpent Granny vanished in a flash.</p><p>After the two Island Masters left, silence fell for a moment, followed by mutual, silent appraisal.  A clear undercurrent of apprehension ran through their gazes.</p><p>Their opponents were not only the Skywalk League, but each other.</p><p>There wasn't a weak person present. Anyone had a chance to obtain the treasures; their strengths were nearly equal. No one feared anyone.</p>
