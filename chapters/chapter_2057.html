<h1>Chapter 2048  Mountain and Field</h1><p>The *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation* is the crystallization of everyone's wisdom, and also a catalyst. The process of exchange was also a process of self-reflection for everyone.  There was inevitably debate, but truth emerged from the clash of ideas. Upon completion of this secret technique, everyone felt their own skills in refining had subtly improved.</p><p>The *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation* is more like a guideline. Everyone will continue to study it, leading to further developments. Different cultivation methods will lead to different advancements.</p><p>Even if the final results are not as good as the original, it will still be considered a superior secret technique in the art of refining, worthy of being passed down as a true legacy.</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade slip, his mind not yet fully detached from the *Luo Hua Dream Interpretation*. He also thought of the Yun You Sword.</p><p>Whether this technique can help the Yun You Sword become a postnatal spiritual treasure remains to be seen, but it's certain that after understanding this secret technique, he will be much more at ease.</p><p>"Although I questioned Elder Qin many times before, I deeply admire Elder Qin's ingenious ideas,"</p><p>Perhaps due to familiarity, the Yu cultivator spoke more freely, unlike the initial arrogance of their first meeting.</p><p>"Daoist Yu is right. My siblings and I have also gained much inspiration from Elder Qin," the male head of the strange duo respectfully saluted Qin Sang, his enthusiasm palpable. The female head also showed more warmth in her gaze towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Others also shared this sentiment.</p><p>In terms of the art of refining, Madam Frost Flower was undoubtedly the strongest. Legend has it that her husband was an heir of a major refining sect in Xunzhou.  Later, for unknown reasons, they had a falling out, and she came to Kanzhou with her daughter.</p><p>However, everyone's thinking had limitations, while Qin Sang always introduced fresh ideas.</p><p>"I wonder, Elder Qin, to which school do you belong?" Madam Frost Flower curiously asked.</p><p>"My sect suffered a calamity; the mountain gate has been destroyed for many years. I was fortunate enough to receive some inheritance and have been exploring the path of refining on my own, taking many wrong turns."</p><p>Qin Sang was telling the truth.</p><p>His journey of learning refining can be divided into two parts: the first in the Storm World, where he learned from many masters; the later part, where he received the inheritance of the Chongxuan Sect, finally giving him clear lineage.</p><p>The origins of the Chongxuan Sect are connected to the Dao Court, and cannot be revealed to outsiders.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang unwilling to disclose his lineage, everyone understood he had his reasons and tactfully refrained from asking further.</p><p>True Person Tonghu leaned against a rock, chest bared, leisurely sipping fine wine, "If we have the chance in the future, we should hold more such Daoist discussions. What do you all think?"</p><p>Madam Frost Flower gazed at the blue waters beyond the mountains, her gaze far-reaching, without comment.</p><p>The two heads of the strange duo looked at each other, their lips moving slightly, as if communicating silently between themselves, before falling silent.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to plan his journey to the Mist Sea, unsure when he would have the chance to return to Kanzhou.</p><p>The Yu cultivator, who was initially eager, lost interest upon seeing this, shaking his head in silence. They were originally strangers, brought together by the invitation of the Luo Hua Temple. It would be difficult to have such an opportunity again.</p><p>A silence fell.  Having lost their enthusiasm, they chatted briefly before some began to take their leave.</p><p>"It's still a distance to Yanling City.  There's no need to rush. I still have some questions and would like to ask everyone," True Person Tonghu sat up, summoning his dragon-headed staff.</p><p>Others also began to prepare for their departure.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, after rising, bowed slightly, "Fellow Daoists, I have an urgent matter to attend to and cannot accompany you. I must take my leave."</p><p>Seeing his sincerity, no one tried to dissuade him.  The Yu cultivator gave Qin Sang a jade pendant, saying, "Elder Qin, if you have time, please bring this token to Yu Island near Qi Yuan City. I will be honored to welcome you."</p><p>They exchanged tokens. Qin Sang simply stated that he currently had no fixed residence, but would establish a base in Wumian City.</p><p>Watching the others fly away on their clouds, Qin Sang took his brothers and flew around the nearby sea area, selecting a relatively secluded island before landing. He carefully set up a large formation and carved out a cave dwelling.</p><p>Sea mist rose, enveloping the island. Qin Sang ordered his brothers to stand guard outside. Entering the cave, he summoned the Fire Lotus.</p><p>This Daoist discussion had lasted nearly a year.  Although Qin Sang was concerned about the Qilin Primordial Seed, he could not leave. Fortunately, over this time, the Qilin Primordial Seed had remained unchanged, showing no further abnormalities.</p><p>Summoning the Fire Lotus, Qin Sang focused his senses, sensing the Qilin Primordial Seed's fluctuations. He fell into thought.</p><p>Based on his previous speculation, he might need to actively operate the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* to trigger the next level of change.</p><p>According to Zhuque, the cultivator of this technique is Ren Tian, the one who incubates the Qilin source seed. When the third stage of the secret art, the Lotus Platform, is achieved, the Qilin will be reborn from him.</p><p>In other words, the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" is also a crucial step in the Qilin's revival. Qin Sang thwarted the Qilin's plan, but this step is probably indispensable.</p><p>Since learning the truth and plotting against the Qilin, Qin Sang stopped cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," but this technique doesn't solely rely on refining spiritual fire.  For years, he has been extracting the essence of the Qilin source seed; there's no more suitable power.  Subtly, this secret art has been progressing.  He could break through to the third stage and achieve mastery at any time!</p><p>However, before doing so, he needs to carefully consider everything to avoid any omissions that could lead to future trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Zhuque again, explaining his thoughts and worries, and sought Zhuque's advice.</p><p>When facing important matters, Zhuque showed prudence and didn't act recklessly. After much thought, it exclaimed, "We've done everything we can; logically, there shouldn't be any mistakes. It's a gamble either way, let's do it!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhuque's sparkling little eyes – that was indeed something it would say.  However, he felt much the same.  Regardless, he had to hatch the Qilin; acting sooner might offer a chance for remedy.</p><p>"Protect me!"</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, dismissing distracting thoughts, and focused his mind on the fire lotus, visualizing the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique.</p><p>Despite the long break, Qin Sang found no impediment in using the technique. While activating the secret art, he closely monitored the changes in the fire lotus and the Qilin source seed.</p><p>As soon as he activated the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," flames flickered on the surface of the fire lotus, becoming brighter. The overlapping lotus petals trembled subtly.</p><p>The flickering firelight on Qin Sang's face became more intense. The already blooming lotus seemed to expand further, pushing its petals apart.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately grasped the source of the change – the lotus heart of the fire lotus – and discovered an unknown change in the Qilin source seed. His consciousness almost completely enveloped the outer shell of the Qilin source seed, yet he couldn't determine whether this change was beneficial or harmful.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang stopped, while Zhuque stared intently at the lotus heart.</p><p>After sensing for a long time, Qin Sang discussed it with Zhuque again before continuing to activate the secret art.</p><p>A strange sight appeared in the cave.</p><p>Between Qin Sang and Zhuque, a fire lotus floated in mid-air, its petals trembling slightly, and faint ethereal flames flickering on its surface.</p><p>As time went on, the trembling of the petals became more pronounced, and the ethereal flames rose and fell, as if a stream of fire was about to erupt.</p><p>Something was forming in the lotus heart, about to emerge, pushing the petals outward. Gradually, the outermost petals fully unfurled, and then the second layer began to expand.</p><p>During this process, the fire lotus grew, the light in the lotus heart became increasingly intense, and the Qilin source seed emitted fluctuations, though they were invisible.</p><p>Before long, the thing nurtured by the fire lotus finally matured.  A vague outline appeared, resembling a lotus pod growing in the heart of a flower, or a round platform.  Finally, the petals fully opened, and the fire lotus transformed into a lotus platform.</p><p>The Qilin source seed rested quietly on the lotus platform. Its energy had subtly changed, forming a new connection with the platform, transforming with its birth.</p><p>Up to this point, everything was still under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>Zhuque's expression was tense, and it couldn't help but remind him.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed not to hear; his mind was completely absorbed in the secret art, oblivious to everything else.  Sensing the imminent breakthrough, he hesitated no longer and charged forward!</p><p>With one final push, he finally reached the third stage, and the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" was complete!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A brilliant flame swept across the lotus platform, illuminating the cave with colorful light.</p><p>The lotus platform slowly rotated, its beauty indescribable, like a divinely created treasure.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had no time to admire it. At the same time as the secret art breakthrough, he felt that his consciousness had undergone some kind of transformation, but he didn't have time to comprehend the extent of his gains.  He poured all his attention into the Qilin source seed.</p><p>Undeniably, the Qilin source seed had changed. Within that chaotic spiritual energy, a consciousness was gradually growing stronger. The Qilin's true spirit was reviving, and very quickly at that.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.  He couldn't extract the consciousness forming the Qilin source, instead, he had to pour more consciousness into it, strengthening it, adding another lock to the Qilin's true spirit.</p><p>Simultaneously, he didn't forget Zhu Que's instructions. While the Qilin's true spirit was between waking and sleeping, before it developed sentience, he had to leave his mark on its core and become its master.</p><p>Although it was taking advantage of a weakness, the process was far more difficult than Qin Sang imagined. He had to constantly monitor every change, and when imprinting his mark, he had to be extremely careful to avoid triggering the Qilin true spirit's instinctive resistance.</p><p>Fortunately, he had just made a breakthrough, his consciousness seemed inexhaustible. Just as Qin Sang was working at full strength, a strange feeling suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p>Subtly, within the Qilin source, something seemed to be revealing a glimpse of itself with the revival of the Qilin's true spirit, touching Qin Sang's heart. This presence wasn't a real thing, but a faint, elusive aura.</p><p>Qin Sang did sense it, but it was a crucial moment for imprinting his mark, and he was powerless to examine it for the time being.</p><p>As the Qilin true spirit revived, that consciousness rapidly grew stronger, quickly approaching that of a real living being. However, this being's life force seemed weak, as if inherently deficient.</p><p>In fact, almost all of the Qilin source's essence had been extracted by Qin Sang and Zhu Que, leaving only a small portion to barely maintain the Qilin true spirit's existence.  Inherent deficiency was only natural.</p><p>‘Whew!’</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled a stale breath.  Working tirelessly, he finally managed to imprint his mark before that consciousness fully formed, and that consciousness showed no resistance!</p><p>Completing this step resolved most of his worries. Even if problems arose later, he could use the imprint to suppress it.</p><p>When Qin Sang came to his senses, the consciousness within the Qilin true spirit had also developed to a certain extent, showing signs of stagnation.</p><p>Seeing the scene before him, Qin Sang showed a slight surprise. Zhu Que's prediction had come true.  What was on the lotus platform could no longer be called a source; it was clearly an egg.</p><p>He had really hatched a Qilin egg!</p><p>The Qilin egg radiated a strong life force.</p><p>Perhaps due to its inherent deficiency, or perhaps it was supposed to be this way, the Qilin true spirit didn't immediately emerge after its revival. That consciousness was slumbering within the egg, needing further incubation before it could hatch.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang's intervention, this egg was mostly composed of his consciousness.  This meant his consciousness would be tied here until the Qilin hatched.</p><p>“When this returns, I wonder how much my consciousness will grow?  Of the Qilin source's essence, besides what was left for the Qilin true spirit, only a small portion was given to Zhu Que, the vast majority went to me…”</p><p>Qin Sang was expectant but knew the importance of balance, he wouldn't overexploit the resource.</p><p>“Is that it?”</p><p>Zhu Que stared intently at the lotus platform, unexpectedly seeing an egg instead of the Qilin, feeling quite disgruntled.</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, his thoughts moving slightly, his mind sinking back into the Qilin egg, seeking the aura he had locked onto earlier.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang found his target. Upon contact, his mind was violently shaken.</p><p>Like the beating of drums and zithers, a hollow sound, a grand voice came from beyond the heavens.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was drawn into an unfamiliar world. He saw a vast expanse of wilderness.</p><p>Lush vegetation and towering mountains; it was like being thrown into a primeval wasteland, a desolate aura washed over him.</p><p>The next moment, a celestial phenomenon occurred. The void turned crimson, boundless light, red clouds filled the sky, and then a stream of fire descended from the heavens.</p><p>The stream of fire fell onto a grey mountain, not causing the earth to collapse, but the ensuing inferno brought a cataclysmic disaster to the wilderness.</p><p>In an instant, the earth turned to scorched earth, a thousand miles of desolation, all life extinguished.</p><p>Qin Sang tried his best to see what was in the stream of fire, but to no avail. After the stream of fire fell, it disappeared without a trace. The vision ended there, and Qin Sang was pulled out of the illusion.</p><p>“What did you see?” Zhu Que, seeing Qin Sang's expression, asked repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, recounting the scene he had witnessed in detail.</p><p>Zhu Que, upon hearing this, became extremely excited. “This might be where the Qilin's original source last fell. This Qilin might have encountered some danger, forcing it to separate its source and hide it here, sending this scene into the source at the last moment, waiting for the true spirit to revive before reclaiming it. Did you get any other information? Can you figure out where that place is?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “That aura only contained this one image.”</p><p>“Impossible! Absolutely impossible!”</p><p>Zhu Que shook her head like a rattle.</p><p>Qin Sang also felt it was unlikely. He hadn't found any specific landmarks in the image.</p><p>The demon race lived in the boundless wilderness; such plains were everywhere.</p><p>Even if that Qilin was active before the rise of humanity, the Eight Great Heavenly States weren't lacking in such places, not to mention the endless wilderness between the Eight Great Heavenly States. Relying on just one image was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>An idea struck him.  He exchanged a glance with Zhu Que, both looking towards the Qilin egg.</p><p>Recommendation: A friend's book, "The Melon-Eating Swordsman in Gulong's World," has been very successful.</p><p>Let go of the urge to help others, respect the fate of others!</p><p>Those protagonists don't need help.</p><p>It's hard to travel through time just once, besides some regrets, the rest is to experience some famous scenes, eat melons, watch plays, and vent complaints.</p><p>Of course there's also...</p><p>Famous swords, fine wine, and peerless beauties!</p>
