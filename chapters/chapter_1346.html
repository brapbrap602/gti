<h1></h1><p>He took out a talisman sword, a treasure used for communication.</p><p>Having stayed in Swordscar Mountain for so long, the talisman sword had remained unresponsive, indicating they hadn't found Old Devil Ye yet.</p><p>He estimated that most Nascent Soul cultivators' minds weren't focused on Old Devil Ye anymore.</p><p>So many spirit herbs in the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>Countless ancient treasures in the Heavenly Mountains.</p><p>And those unexplored secret realms.</p><p>…</p><p>None of these held less allure for them than Old Devil Ye.</p><p>The reason they could still reach a consensus on dealing with Old Devil Ye was twofold.</p><p>First, those who had been schemed against and fooled by Old Devil Ye sought revenge. Second, Old Devil Ye acted recklessly and was too vicious. As long as he lived, others couldn't rest easy.</p><p>Moreover, the demonic beings released by Old Devil Ye were brewing some unknown conspiracy.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was thoughtful.</p><p>His objective had been successfully achieved, and it didn't matter where he went next.</p><p>After leaving Swordscar Mountain, Qin Sang planned to contact Senior Sister and Bai first. If they didn't need his help, he would try his luck in the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>What he anticipated most was the Hanging Garden Palace.</p><p>While observing the unusual phenomena from afar, Qin Sang noticed a faint treasure light flickering beneath the divine tree within the Hanging Garden Palace.  Having received direct teachings from Yun Youzi, his understanding of the Hanging Garden Palace far surpassed others. With luck, he might be able to obtain one or two immortal herbs.</p><p>It would be even more wonderful if he could acquire immortal plants of the Ten Great Divine Wood caliber.</p><p>Traveling between illusions, Qin Sang gradually sensed something amiss.  Collecting his thoughts, he looked around, observing for a moment before finally discerning the difference.</p><p>The power of the ancient illusion formation hadn't changed, but the illusions themselves were becoming increasingly chaotic.</p><p>“Something's wrong!”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned serious as he accelerated.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang rushed out of the illusion formation, immediately feeling a tremendous force slam into him.</p><p>Already alert, Qin Sang had summoned his Ebony Sword beforehand.  Finding the situation amiss, he hastily activated a sword incantation, creating a protective aura of sword light that resisted the forceful impact.</p><p>His body, like a willow catkin, drifted a considerable distance.</p><p>Having neutralized the impact, Qin Sang realized this force was actually a gust of wind.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Gusts of fierce wind blew past.</p><p>Qin Sang maneuvered his sword amidst the gale, finally seeing the state of this world. During the time he was inside, earth-shattering changes had occurred.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, fierce winds howled, creating a multicolored spectacle.</p><p>This was because the gale had merged with the multicolored auspicious clouds, transforming into a five-colored immortal wind.</p><p>The Purple Firmament Palace had become even more chaotic than before. The five-colored immortal wind swept in all directions, accompanied by rumbling sounds, obscuring the distant scenery.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt the talisman sword vibrating in his palm. Releasing his grip, he watched as the talisman sword spun and hovered before him.</p><p>The tip of the sword pointed unexpectedly towards the Outer Palace!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>It seemed Senior Sister and the others had been trying to contact him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards Swordscar Mountain. Back then, the illusion formation couldn't isolate perception between inside and outside. Now, the formation's true power had manifested, blocking the talisman sword's connection!</p><p>“I wonder when they sent the message. Bai hasn't come to find me. I don't know if the situation isn't urgent or if the situation is too dangerous for him to break away.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed the sword tip's direction, seeing only the world-obscuring five-colored divine wind, unable to discern what was happening there.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the upheaval seemed to be occurring in the Outer Palace.</p><p>When they entered through the Demonic Cave, everyone's attention had been drawn to the unusual phenomena in the Inner Palace, naturally assuming Old Devil Ye's target was also the secret realm within.</p><p>Few had paid attention to the Outer Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had only given it a cursory glance.</p><p>He remembered the Outer Palace wasn't like the Inner Palace with its frequent displays of unusual phenomena. The most striking feature was the Immortal Graveyard, filled with overwhelming ghostly Qi, likely influenced by the Inner Palace.</p><p>Besides that, there seemed to be nothing noteworthy.</p><p>The Outer and Inner Palaces of the Purple Firmament Palace didn't appear to be a unified whole.</p><p>The Inner Palace resembled a celestial paradise, while the Outer Palace consisted of either the Immortal Graveyard or the crimson sacrificial altar. Originally, an immortal formation separated the two, but it had been damaged in recent years.</p><p>The Outer Palace held little attraction for Nascent Soul Grandmasters.  What could Old Devil Ye be doing there?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he glanced towards the Hanging Garden Palace again.</p><p>The unusual phenomena in the Inner Palace intensified. First, the dormant immortal restrictions were activated, followed by the appearance of the five-colored immortal wind.  Who knew what would appear next?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of unease.</p><p>If the unusual phenomena continued, remaining in the Inner Palace could become dangerous.</p><p>At this moment, venturing into the Ancient Medicine Garden or challenging the ancient restrictions of the Hanging Garden Palace wasn't a wise choice. Even if the talisman sword hadn't reacted, Qin Sang intended to leave the Inner Palace first and observe before deciding his next move.</p><p>Having reached this decision, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He activated his spirit sword for protection and retraced his steps back towards the Outer Palace.</p><p>The five-colored immortal wind grew denser, the void resembling a canvas smeared with paint.</p><p>His vision was restricted.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see the situation in the distant secret realms, unaware of how many had already rushed to the Outer Palace, or how many had ignored the talisman sword and continued their treasure hunt.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived near the Sword Path Grand Hall.</p><p>The scene here was no longer as he remembered, completely transformed, even more awe-inspiring!</p><p>Towering divine peaks rose from the ground.</p><p>Hundreds of colossal peaks surrounded the Sword Path Grand Hall, each incredibly steep, resembling a gigantic sword formation composed of mountains, majestic and imposing.</p><p>Between the peaks, white light shimmered. Ancient restrictions formed platforms of light, seemingly trial platforms for disciples to practice their swordsmanship.</p><p>The Sword Path Grand Hall occupied the innermost position.</p><p>Most of the giant peaks weren't intact. Some were cut in half, while others were reduced to mere foundations.  Some were even collapsing, broken peaks crashing to the ground.</p><p>Atop the mountains, ancient restrictions shimmered, and ancient halls flickered amidst the five-colored divine wind, including the mountain where the Sword Path Grand Hall stood.</p><p>These ancient halls emanated an aura of antiquity.</p><p>The majority, however, were collapsed and dilapidated, signifying the decline of the ancient immortal palace.</p><p>Qin Sang stared towards the Sword Path Grand Hall.</p><p>The divine peak stood alone.</p><p>The cliff faced east, seemingly unchanged.</p><p>But Qin Sang's worries increased. He wasn't sure if he could still traverse the dense ancient restrictions and climb to the summit. However, this clearly wasn't a good time to test it. Qin Sang lowered his head and withdrew his gaze.</p><p>Passing through the peaks, he arrived near the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>The treasure light radiating from the peerless immortal herbs shone even brighter.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw the occasional flicker of magical treasures within the Ancient Medicine Garden. Indeed, some were still unwilling to leave, risking their lives in search of immortal herbs.</p><p>He shook his head, disregarding others, his figure moving without pause.</p><p>During his journey, he could sense the five-colored immortal wind gradually strengthening.  If this continued, or if new unusual phenomena appeared, it might become difficult to leave.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached the edge of the Inner Palace.</p><p>The scene here was utter chaos.  Land fragments torn from the Inner Palace began to crumble from the outermost layer. Where the Outer and Inner Palaces met, ravines crisscrossed, filled with collapsing structures, severely damaged.</p><p>Even more astonishing,</p><p>The ghostly mist was no longer confined to the Immortal Graveyard; it had completely erupted, engulfing almost the entire Outer Palace.</p><p>Evil spirits wailed, a myriad ghosts ran rampant!
