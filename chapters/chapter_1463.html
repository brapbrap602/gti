Two-in-one, Make-up Chapter)</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder scoffed, disdaining further argument.</p><p>He reached into his pouch and produced a silver vial. Tilting it, he poured out a single silver droplet.</p><p>Then, his fingers moved with incredible speed, completing a sigil in an instant. He touched the droplet, transforming it from silver to black, before flicking it with a finger.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The droplet shot towards Qin Sang, but before he could react, it exploded in midair, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t fathom the Elder’s plan, remaining vigilant. He hurriedly activated the demonic banner, simultaneously drawing on the nascent fire within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>This nascent fire could no longer be called a Fire Lotus Seed; it was budding, gradually transforming into a Fire Lotus.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Demonic flames erupted.  Now infused with the Fire Lotus, their rejection of Qin Sang was minimized. While not the seamless integration experienced with the original Fire Lotus’s flames, he could now wield them freely without the former sluggishness.</p><p>All the demonic flames coalesced into a single mass, then formed a fiery dragon, its head aimed at the Hun Mo Elder, teeth bared and claws extended.</p><p>At that moment, the weather changed.  It began to rain.</p><p>This was no ordinary rain. The water was black, extremely ominous, radiating an aura of decay.</p><p>Pitter-patter!</p><p>In an instant, a torrential downpour engulfed the fire dragon.</p><p>Yet, everything else remained normal, except for the sea behind them, still affected by the Winter Seal; the sky above was clear and bright.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his senses on the fire dragon. After a moment, the tension on his face eased, replaced by a slight smile. The Nine Nether demonic fire was an ancient demon's power; the Hun Mo Elder’s demonic techniques might weaken other spirit flames, but they were ineffective against the Nine Nether fire!</p><p>The demonic fire dragon swam leisurely through the black rain, absorbing all the dark water.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder’s expression was grim. He hadn't held high hopes for the Corrosive Yin Poison Water, but seeing it cause no trouble to the demonic fire or Qin Sang startled him.</p><p>Immediately, the Hun Mo Elder hesitated no longer. Black demonic light surged from the head of his Black Bamboo Staff, twisting into a spear, leaving a trail of afterimages as it shot towards Qin Sang with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight pain in his brow.</p><p>He was familiar with this demonic light from the Black Bamboo Staff.</p><p>They had clashed before, at the Buddhist temple.</p><p>However, that time, the Hun Mo Elder had acted hastily, not using his full strength; he was also preoccupied with securing the treasure and concealing himself, far from his peak condition.</p><p>This was the Hun Mo Elder’s true power.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless, raising his hand to summon the fire dragon to meet the demonic spear.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The demonic spear, incredibly sharp, pierced straight through the fire dragon.</p><p>The next moment, the fire dragon exploded.</p><p>A deafening roar caused everyone nearby to feel their hearts leap, stunned by the terrifying spectacle.</p><p>The demonic fire dispersed and retreated, and the demonic light had dissipated, unable to coalesce.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's confidence grew.</p><p>In the early Yuan Ying stage, he could already threaten Ye Lao Mo using the demonic fire.</p><p>Now, with his cultivation and spiritual sense having both greatly increased, he should be even stronger. However, after his breakthrough, he hadn't had the opportunity to fight a powerful cultivator head-on, preventing him from accurately assessing his strength, making him cautious.</p><p>Now, pursued by the Hun Mo Elder, he was forced into a direct confrontation.</p><p>With two backup plans, Qin Sang fought without reservation, finally proving his strength. After the Jin Chen Sword was reforged, aside from his true energy not being as substantial as his opponent’s, preventing prolonged combat, he was no less capable than a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder snorted, gripping his Black Bamboo Staff tightly.</p><p>From the handle, interwoven threads spread downwards, covering the entire staff.</p><p>Then, the transformed Black Bamboo Staff was thrown by the Hun Mo Elder. Its form vanished instantly, turning into an incredibly swift dark shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gust of wind, hurriedly summoning the demonic fire to block it.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The shadow of the Black Bamboo Staff appeared above the demonic fire.</p><p>The fire dragon was instantly scattered, countless flames dancing in the void. The Hun Mo Elder had gained the upper hand. However, the demonic fire was of a high order; even someone as powerful as the Hun Mo Elder could only scatter it, not annihilate it.</p><p>As the demonic fire began to coalesce again,</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder's anger grew. He reached out and grabbed something nearby – the Hun Mo Order.</p><p>The character ‘Order’ shone brightly.</p><p>The surrounding sword threads froze, the Hun Mo Order as sharp as a blade, forcibly breaking through the sword array’s blockade.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, recalling the Jin Chen Sword, mentally calculating the distance.</p><p>He had been fighting and retreating, not far from the Maze Formation. With so many people watching nearby, he didn't want to tangle with the Hun Mo Elder here.</p><p>"Almost!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, then saw the Hunmo Order pressing down.  Under its influence, the demonic fire slowed, its regrouping drastically hampered.</p><p>Qin Sang feigned defeat, her eyes showing feigned terror. She forcibly gathered the demonic fire, intentionally colliding with the Black Bamboo Staff before fleeing.</p><p>Hunmo Elder, still seething with anger, wouldn't let Qin Sang escape so easily. The Black Bamboo Staff and Hunmo Order immediately locked onto her.</p><p>Having suffered a setback at the Buddhist temple, he didn't try to use Daoist techniques to restrain her.  He knew those would be countered by that strange divine light, causing him to miss the opportunity.</p><p>One could only use the Shapeshifting technique once within a certain timeframe. If Qin Sang escaped, he would never catch up.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Two figures chased each other across the boundless sea, their magical light flashing frequently as they engaged in fierce combat.</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly in disarray, remained remarkably calm.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at the reefs beneath the surface, a slight smile playing on her lips.</p><p>At the same time, Hunmo Elder sensed something unusual below, his heart tightened, his expression changing.</p><p>"Trap!"</p><p>The word flashed through his mind. Though surprised, Hunmo Elder wasn't flustered, nor was he entirely surprised.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators attending the Great Demon Assembly were all cunning and experienced; having a backup plan and being prepared was standard practice. Seeing Qin Sang fly south, Hunmo Elder had a premonition.</p><p>However, his speed was inferior to Qin Sang's, and he couldn't gain an overwhelming advantage, so he could only focus on stopping her – a desperate measure.  Coupled with the well-hidden maze formation, it was inevitable that he would fall into the trap.</p><p>A fog suddenly appeared from nowhere, instantly enveloping the area.</p><p>Hunmo Elder reacted swiftly, sensing the change and immediately retreated, recalling his treasures. The Hunmo Order hovered above his head before being swallowed by the fog.</p><p>Protected by the Hunmo Order, Hunmo Elder wasn't worried about his safety; he even hoped it was some kind of killing formation, which would allow him to escape faster. Then, his opponent would lose their advantage, and he could simply exhaust them with his profound True Essence.</p><p>His next discovery, however, was disappointing.</p><p>Hunmo Elder tapped his forehead between his eyebrows.</p><p>His eyes turned black, becoming demonic eyes, glowing with a deep darkness that seemed to penetrate the fog. After a moment, Hunmo Elder uttered three words with considerable gloom.</p><p>"Maze Formation!"</p><p>A Maze Formation, a purely obfuscating one!</p><p>No wonder it was so well concealed.</p><p>Hunmo Elder's thoughts raced.  The good news was that he had reacted quickly and was currently at the edge of the formation.  His experience and staying put – not moving within the formation – were working in his favor.</p><p>He would be able to sense any changes in the formation's configuration.</p><p>The situation wasn't yet dire.  If he found the right method, he might still escape.</p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p>Behind the maze...</p><p>Hunmo Elder's disciple, the man in black robes, followed the Ghost Spirit closely. He wasn't unwilling to help his master, but he simply couldn't keep up.</p><p>He also had to guard against others who might target the weakened Ghost Spirit.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators from Xuan Tian Palace had been arriving, giving them the confidence to make their moves.</p><p>The black-robed man was primarily wary of them.  Although he had sent word back to Hunmo Island, reinforcements wouldn't arrive that quickly.</p><p>He had expected to watch the fight from the sidelines and profit, but now his side was the one being attacked.</p><p>Seeing the fog rising on the sea, engulfing Hunmo Elder, the black-robed man felt nervous and worried about his master's situation.</p><p>At that moment, the Ghost Spirit suddenly turned, its eyes showing almost uncontainable madness, staring at the black-robed man. "Blood..." it said.</p><p>The black-robed man felt a chill run down his spine and immediately understood it was his master's command. Gritting his teeth, he forced out a mouthful of essence blood.</p><p>The Ghost Spirit swallowed the blood, its madness intensifying, as it lunged towards the sea fog, shooting two beams of blood into the mist.</p><p>Hunmo Elder remained motionless within the maze formation, his dark demonic eyes fixed on the rear.</p><p>Then, Hunmo Elder seemed to sense something, his expression shifting, his demonic eyes turning slightly.</p><p>He suddenly floated towards the right, then forward again.</p><p>It was as if Hunmo Elder received clear guidance, his figure like a ghost, moving left and right, sometimes ahead, sometimes behind.</p><p>This was one reason why he left the Ghost Spirit behind.</p><p>First, the Ghost Spirit was greatly depleted after using the Shapeshifting technique and was difficult to use in combat.</p><p>Second, it was to guard against traps like this, using the connection between him and the Ghost Spirit, along with his demonic eye ability, to escape the Maze Formation as quickly as possible.</p><p>Shortly after, a figure emerged from the swirling sea mist.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder dashed out, his indifferent gaze sweeping over the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators pursuing him. He then turned to look ahead, even spotting escaping lights on the horizon.  His speed was astonishing!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Hunmo Elder escaping the maze formation.  His eyes twitched; this was a meticulously crafted array, yet it only held the old demon for such a short time.  Fortunately, he’d prepared two contingencies, anticipating Xuan Tian Palace's pursuit.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder bypassed the ghostly mist, relentlessly pursuing. Though his escape technique was slower than Qin Sang's, the distance between them widened, but the Hunmo Elder showed no sign of stopping.</p><p>Qin Sang grew uncertain, suspecting the Hunmo Elder possessed powerful abilities like shapeshifting.  He flipped his hand, retrieving a Dan Ding token from his storage ring, clutching it as he altered his course southwest. If he couldn't shake the Hunmo Elder, he'd have to seek help.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>chaos erupted southwest of Hunmo Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Hunmo Elder raced across the sky, their incredible escape techniques astonishing onlookers.</p><p>Behind them,</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace persisted, trailing far behind but steadily increasing in numbers, eventually becoming the most numerous group, although still significantly outpaced.</p><p>Passing cultivators, startled by the spectacle, were filled with suspicion and wonder.  Most chose to avoid the area, but a few bold cultivators remained, watching from a distance.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>…</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's unwavering pursuit forced Qin Sang to remain vigilant.</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance,</p><p>Qin Sang sensed through the Dan Ding token that he was nearing Yinquan Zhenren.</p><p>“I’ve actually lured the Hunmo Elder here.  This will likely cost me dearly to satisfy the Dan Ding Society,”</p><p>Qin Sang wryly mused.</p><p>Fortunately, Xuan Tian Palace lagged far behind, posing no immediate threat. Otherwise, seeing this, Yinquan Zhenren would have certainly turned back, regardless of any ancient recipes.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder realized he couldn't catch Qin Sang.  His persistence stemmed from Qin Sang's sudden change of direction, leading him to suspect further preparations or reinforcements.</p><p>As the undisputed ruler of the Boundless Sea, a leading cultivator of the North Sea, the Hunmo Elder knew the identities and capabilities of the other formidable cultivators in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>But not this person.</p><p>This individual seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>Such individuals were the most troublesome.</p><p>Unburdened and unrestrained.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder aimed to probe, hoping to uncover any allies and thus learn the newcomer's background.  Once identified, he could find other ways to deal with him.</p><p>With this in mind,</p><p>the Hunmo Elder locked onto Qin Sang with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Qin Sang could have broken the lock, but refrained, as the distance was still too short. Even if he escaped the lock, he couldn't stop and hide nearby.</p><p>He would wait until he gained more distance.</p><p>Seeing the Hunmo Elder remain inactive, Qin Sang started to suspect the old demon was bluffing. He hesitated, looking at the Dan Ding token.</p><p>It wasn't the cost;</p><p>unplayed cards held the greatest impact.</p><p>If he could escape the Hunmo Elder on his own, making the old demon overthink, he would become even more wary of him.</p><p>Both men harbored their own thoughts.</p><p>This chase seemed endless.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>the black escape light stopped abruptly.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder halted, his brow furrowed, turning towards the north.</p><p>On the distant horizon,</p><p>a dark cloud appeared.</p><p>The cloud hung silently in the sky.  The Hunmo Elder then sensed two unmasked gazes fixed on him.</p><p>“That old demon hasn’t left yet, and now it’s alerted…”</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's eyes narrowed, realizing something.  He glanced before and behind him.</p><p>Ahead was a mysterious top-tier expert, his rear was blocked by Xuan Tian Palace, and a demonic saint watched from the north; he had unwittingly fallen into a three-way encirclement.</p><p>He had to treat each party cautiously.</p><p>Though the likelihood of a three-way alliance against him was slim, caution was necessary.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, the Hunmo Elder flicked his sleeve, exchanging a blunt stare with the Tianpeng Great Saint, abandoning the pursuit and returning the way he came.</p><p>The cloud paused, then slowly drifted north.</p><p>The Boundless Sea was predominantly human, and the Tianpeng Great Saint was only observing.  The old demon's compliance left no opportunity.</p><p>Before leaving, the Tianpeng Great Saint cast a strange look towards the direction Qin Sang had fled. He had sensed demonic energy, mistaking it for a fellow demon, but it vanished before he could get a clear view.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder flew towards them.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace cultivators exchanged glances, looking to Elders Mei and Lan.</p><p>“What now?  It seems the old demon has a grudge against that person, possibly wanting to join forces with us.”</p><p>Elder Mei whispered.</p>
