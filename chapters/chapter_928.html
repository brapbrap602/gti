<h1>Chapter 920: The Return Journey</h1><p>Windveil Isle.</p><p>One of the most mysterious islands in the Gale Archipelago, its fame stemming from the Windveil Auction.  Rare treasures, like the Seven Killing Sect tokens, difficult to obtain in the outside world, could potentially be found here.  It was rumored that not only was there a Nascent Soul ancestor backing Windveil Isle, but also the influence of the three major merchant alliances.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>The Windveil Auction concluded.</p><p>Three Seven Killing Sect tokens were purchased at exorbitant prices by three mysterious cultivators.</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang, travel-worn and weary, returned to Venomous Isle.</p><p>The Bai family, Bai Zhongqiu, his wife, and daughter, were cultivating on the island.  Informed of Qin Sang's return, they hurried out to greet him.</p><p>Nearly twenty years had passed.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife's appearances hadn't changed much.  Bai Ying'er, however, was no longer the young girl he remembered. Though she remained on Venomous Isle, sheltered from the world, her demeanor was more composed than before.</p><p>The greatest change was in their cultivation.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu had become a Core Formation realm expert. Bai Hong remained stuck at the bottleneck of late-stage Foundation Establishment, though it was said she'd gained some enlightenment, and a breakthrough was only a matter of time.</p><p>Most astonishing was Bai Ying'er. With the innate talent of her Water Jade physique, she'd achieved Foundation Establishment without the aid of a Foundation Establishment Pill, leaving Qin Sang deeply impressed.</p><p>Upon returning to his cave dwelling, the Two-Headed Hound broke free from Qin Sang and dashed to Bai Ying'er's side, flopping down and nudging her to groom it.</p><p>Bai Ying'er stifled a giggle, first offering a respectful curtsy to Qin Sang, then sitting cross-legged.  She placed the Two-Headed Hound on her lap, a layer of water-attributed energy emanating from her palms as she gently stroked its fur.  Her jade lips moved close to the hound’s ear, whispering softly.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound whimpered contentedly, its tail wagging furiously.</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow.</p><p>The Two-Headed Hound had grown unusually attached to Bai Ying'er, perhaps disheartened by his own lack of progress in cultivation. It had almost caused trouble once, and Qin Sang had to clean up the mess.</p><p>“Senior, were you able to acquire the Seven Killing Sect tokens?”</p><p>Seeing his daughter interacting with the Two-Headed Hound, Bai Zhongqiu couldn't help but smile. He bowed to Qin Sang, curiosity evident in his voice.</p><p>After more than a decade together, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife had grown somewhat accustomed to Qin Sang's temperament and were less intimidated.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a noncommittal hum. "Fortunately, I managed to secure them all. However, the competition was fiercer than I anticipated, and the price was far higher than I expected."</p><p>He sighed, feigning distress.</p><p>Luckily, he had the spiritual items obtained from the Black Serpent Mountain cultivators; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so confident. Entering the Seven Killing Sect’s domain was a life-or-death gamble, but for the sake of breakthroughs and the path of immortality, many cultivators were willing to risk their lives.</p><p>“I've recently acquired some corpse refining techniques and need to enter seclusion for a period.  I have no tasks for you at the moment, so remain here and cultivate. I'll have further instructions after I emerge."</p><p>After giving these instructions, Qin Sang entered his cave dwelling.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife exchanged glances, a mixture of relief and apprehension in their eyes.  They were grateful for the opportunity to cultivate on Venomous Isle, a place with rich spiritual energy and a secure, hidden cave—a dream for many cultivators. Yet they also worried about the potentially dangerous tasks Qin Sang might assign them after his seclusion.</p><p>Unaware of their thoughts, Qin Sang entered the cave, activating the restrictive formations.  With a thud, he unfastened the black coffin he carried on his back.</p><p>The coffin lid creaked open, revealing his Avatar lying within.</p><p>The Avatar's eyes snapped open, revealing blood-red pupils that radiated a bloodthirsty, ferocious light, fixed intently on Qin Sang.  For an instant, the entire cave seemed transformed into a sea of blood.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, sending several incantations towards the Avatar.  The crimson in the Avatar's eyes slowly receded, gradually returning to normal.  It rose from the coffin and walked over to a meditation cushion, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>“Forced cultivation methods truly harbor great hidden dangers!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave as he gazed at his Avatar.</p><p>Seeing that the Avatar's self-cultivation wasn't progressing as quickly as he desired, he’d resorted to feeding it blood orbs and utilizing the forced cultivation techniques from the *Seed Demon Fetus* scripture.</p><p>The consequences were quickly becoming apparent.</p><p>“Before, although my cultivation was a level lower than the Avatar's, with the Jade Buddha's power, I could still control it without fear of backlash. Now, after just one blood orb, I'm already showing signs of losing control.  I must constantly employ the pacifying techniques from the *Seed Demon Fetus* scripture to soothe the demonic soul.  Once the Avatar reaches the peak of Core Formation, I fear the only way to control it in combat will be to activate the Heavenly Demon Transformation.  Otherwise, I'll have to keep it in a perpetual slumber.”</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the black coffin.</p><p>The coffin gleamed with a metallic sheen, appearing unremarkable, yet it was a magical treasure, crafted by Qin Sang himself.</p><p>It could be considered the first magical treasure he had ever refined, and he had named it the Heavenly Corpse Coffin. It was based on the methods for refining corpse coffins described in the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>After comprehending a portion of the runes within the Profound Iron Pillar, Qin Sang's refining skills had greatly increased. Using some precious monster bones and spiritual materials he'd saved, he successfully created this treasure.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Coffin could conceal the Avatar’s aura and shield it from external spiritual sense probes.  As long as the Avatar remained within the coffin, there was no fear of its true nature being discovered.</p><p>Of course, this was only one of its functions.</p><p>During combat, the Heavenly Corpse Coffin could transform into armor for the Avatar. Qin Sang had also found a long-bladed magical treasure among his previous spoils of war for the Avatar to wield.</p><p>After all, the Avatar lacked powerful innate abilities, and its strength could only be enhanced through specifically crafted magical treasures.</p><p>“I just acquired a piece of Black Origin Metal at the Windveil Auction. Refining it into the Heavenly Corpse Coffin will greatly enhance its defensive capabilities, making it second only to that Golden Radiance Armor. However, Black Origin Metal is incredibly hard. While my Nine Nether Demonic Fire can barely melt it, I fear I won't have the energy left for refining. It seems I'll have to wait until I return to Heaven's Rise Island. I recall they have top-tier refining chambers that can harness a portion of the city's protective formation and draw upon the power of the earth's flame veins…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, already having a plan for upgrading the Heavenly Corpse Coffin.</p><p>He had decided to return to Heaven's Rise Island.</p><p>The battle at Insight Island had occurred thirty years ago. Even the greatest storms should have subsided by now.</p><p>The Sect Leader of the Lantern Fighting Sect couldn't remain guarding Heaven's Rise Island indefinitely. As long as he didn't encounter a Nascent Soul ancestor, even if he ran into Senior Lu, with his current strength, the outcome of a battle was uncertain.</p><p>The chaos in the Demonic Sea had subsided more than twenty years ago.</p><p>As for what had ultimately transpired in the Demonic Sea and how the aggressive demon race had been repelled, Qin Sang, having remained hidden in this remote location, had no concrete information.</p><p>After over two decades, the Demonic Sea should have gradually returned to normal.</p><p>“Revenge is a dish best served cold. I wonder if you still remember Qin Mou?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.</p><p>He hadn’t forgotten that he'd stolen the treasure coveted by the Black Serpent Mountain's ancestor.</p><p>To avoid exposing his identity and being targeted by a Nascent Soul cultivator, he only had one chance to strike!</p>
