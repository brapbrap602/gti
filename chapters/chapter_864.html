<h1>Chapter 856: Caught in the Current</h1><p>"Someone is willing to pay with High-Grade Spirit Stones to recruit helpers..."</p><p>Qin Sang's face showed surprise as he read the message on the transmission talisman.</p><p>Checking the date, he realized it was left three months ago, when he was still rescuing people with Yue Xiangu and the others.</p><p>The talisman didn't specify the task, only mentioning a meeting at a shop for further details.</p><p>After so long, they probably already found enough people, right?</p><p>Qin Sang regretted missing the opportunity.</p><p>He held the jade talisman, pondered for a moment, and decided to visit the shop anyway. It was a rare opportunity, and perhaps they hadn't started yet.</p><p>The other talismans contained nothing urgent. Qin Sang sealed his cave and headed towards the market, removing his cloak and moving through Skyrise City in his true form.</p><p>The shop was open.</p><p>The shopkeeper was surprised to see Qin Sang enter, hurriedly rising to greet him. "Fellow Daoist Qin, where have you been?  We haven't heard from you in so long."</p><p>"I was in secluded cultivation.  I found your talisman after emerging and hurried over."</p><p>Qin Sang sat down.</p><p>He was determined to keep his two identities separate, preventing any connection between them, so he concealed his trip to the Demon Sea.</p><p>As he became involved in more and more matters, Qin Sang increasingly felt that the Seven Kills Sect held countless secrets, entangled with too many factions and complex affairs.</p><p>He naturally hoped to avoid being dragged into it, but events often unfolded beyond one's control.  It was best to be prepared. If one identity became compromised, he could still operate under his other, clean identity, blending into the world.</p><p>The shopkeeper paused, then suddenly realized, "I almost forgot. Fellow Daoist Qin is referring to that matter."</p><p>"Is the Daoist who was recruiting still looking for help? I urgently need High-Grade Spirit Stones, as you know. This kind of opportunity is rare."</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward and asked.</p><p>"That's hard to say."  The shopkeeper shook his head, taking a sip of tea. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I delivered that talisman several months ago.  At that time, the client asked me to recommend trustworthy and capable Daoists, and I thought of you.  But I received no response, so I told them, and we haven't been in contact since. It's unfortunate that you were in secluded cultivation."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's disappointment, the shopkeeper thought for a moment. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I can't let you leave empty-handed. I'll try to contact them.  You return to your cave and await my news. With the current turmoil in the Demon Sea, only entry is allowed, causing tension in the Inner Sea. Many cultivators fear conscription and are fleeing Skyrise Island.  Skilled cultivators like yourself are not easy to find.  I recall the client's requirements were high; they might not have assembled a full team yet."</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Qin Sang rose, bowed in gratitude, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then headed towards the auction house.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, the shopkeeper tapped his fingers on the table, pondered, closed the shop, and hurried away.</p><p>Soon, the shopkeeper arrived at a courtyard on the edge of Skyrise City and knocked on the gate.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>A deep voice echoed from within.</p><p>The shopkeeper entered and saw a black-robed figure, the same person who had sold Qin Sang the High-Grade Spirit Stones. He bowed and asked, "Senior Brother, is there any news from Eldest Senior Brother?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>The black-robed figure shook his head slightly. "But it should be soon. The Demon Sea situation is critical. All human factions are involved, and experts are being deployed to defend the islands. This presents an opportunity for us. With Eldest Senior Brother's abilities, gathering information should be easy. It's a pity Master is trapped in the Demon Sea and can't escape. Otherwise, we could directly attack, avoiding all this trouble."</p><p>"Is Master truly unable to come?"</p><p>The shopkeeper's expression turned serious. "We've been planning for so long, have the rogue cultivators we recruited become useless?"</p><p>The black-robed figure sighed. "As they say, plans never survive contact with the enemy. Master predicted the demon unrest and the tension in the Demon Sea, but he didn't anticipate such chaos. The demons are acting like madmen. That Great Priestess is incompetent, despite her cultivation. She allowed the demons to attack Sky Witch Island, nearly losing the teleportation array, trapping Master there. Without Master, we can't attack another sect. Even if we obtain the treasure, we can't control the rogue cultivators.  However, our preparations aren't entirely wasted. This opportunity is rare.  Eldest Senior Brother has instructed us to find the treasure's location at all costs, whether by stealth or force. He's a brilliant strategist. No one but us knows the treasure's true nature, so our chances are good.  Also, Master will escape from Sky Witch Island soon. We'll need manpower then, so we'll keep them for now..."</p><p>The shopkeeper breathed a sigh of relief. "That's good. To contribute to Master's cause, our efforts haven't been in vain."</p><p>The black-robed figure glanced at him.  "Don't worry. Master rewards those who serve him well.  I've observed your actions and reported everything to Master. He's aware. By the way, is there something you need?"</p><p>"There is one thing. Senior Brother, do you remember the person who bought your High-Grade Spirit Stones? He was in secluded cultivation and contacted me immediately after seeing the talisman. He's definitely not connected to any major factions.  I'm just not sure if you still need him..."</p><p>The shopkeeper said in a low voice.</p><p>"Oh, that person!"</p><p>The black-robed figure remembered Qin Sang. "I recall he's at the mid-Core Formation stage."</p><p>"Correct," the shopkeeper nodded. "Despite his seclusion, his cultivation hasn't improved much, suggesting he was practicing some Daoist technique. For a rogue cultivator to reach this level, he must be quite capable."</p><p>The black-robed figure hummed, pondering. "According to our original plan, his involvement was optional. But without Master, we alone might struggle to control those late-Core Formation old monsters. They might take the rewards and betray us.  Fortunately, we've been wary and haven't revealed our true objective, otherwise, it would be difficult to manage.  Someone like Qin is easier to control. However, the specifics of our operation and the number of people required depend on Eldest Senior Brother's news..."</p><p>"So, Senior Brother's intention is...?"</p><p>"Let's bring him in. It's just High-Grade Spirit Stones. Compared to the treasure Master seeks, it's nothing!" The black-robed figure slammed his hand on the table.</p><p>The shopkeeper's face lit up with joy.  "I've already reassured him, telling him to wait for news at his cave.  Senior Brother, come to my shop in a few days, and I'll call him over."</p><p>The black-robed figure nodded.</p><p>……</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang was walking towards the auction house. Seeing the desolate market, he began to consider whether he should temporarily leave Skyrise Island to avoid trouble.</p>
