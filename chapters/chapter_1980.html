<h1>Chapter 1971: Manifestation Before Men</h1><p>Boundless yellow sands stretched out.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down upon the earth, his gaze settling between two sand dunes.</p><p>The sand slowly began to flow, revealing an abyss beneath.  It relentlessly devoured the sand, quickly forming a deep trench.</p><p>The two dunes were swallowed by the trench, the consumption continuing unabated, gradually forming a chasm thousands of zhang long and immeasurably deep.</p><p>From the depths of the chasm, a crimson glow emanated. The earth was torn asunder, reaching all the way down to the earthfire veins.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden thread shot upwards from below.</p><p>While Qin Sang had been flying in the air, the Fire Jade Centipede had been travelling alongside him within the earthfire veins, thoroughly investigating their distribution.</p><p>Moreover, the Fire Jade Centipede had discovered some ancient traces there, remnants of a shattered Secret Realm, precisely what Qin Sang sought.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede coiled around a bronze pillar and plunged back into the magma.</p><p>Qin Sang floated above the chasm, flicking streams of light from his fingertips, sending them shooting into the earth.</p><p>The magma surged, emitting rumbling roars.</p><p>Within the boiling magma, a golden centipede could be faintly seen churning.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was coordinating its movements with Qin Sang's.</p><p>As time passed, a dense cluster of runes floated around the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>These runes formed a restriction, originating from Qin Sang's discoveries in the ruins, but with significant alterations.</p><p>The bronze pillar served as the core of the restriction, slanted within the magma.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede stretched out its body, releasing the bronze pillar. The pillar could then be seen trembling slightly, not fixed in one place, but drifting slowly with the magma flow.</p><p>This was a deliberate illusion crafted by Qin Sang.</p><p>After all, he had occupied the ruins for so long.  When constructing his Daoist Sanctuary, he hadn't foreseen this day.  Perfectly restoring the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation without leaving any trace was impossible.</p><p>Even if he could deceive the Nascent Soul cultivators of both sides, the two Patriarchs would easily see through the ruse, potentially jeopardizing his plan.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang, disregarding the trouble, took extra steps to create the illusion that the ruins had torn themselves apart, the bronze pillar dislodging and falling into this Secret Realm.</p><p>When the two great powers discovered the ruins, they would follow the clues and eventually find this bronze pillar.</p><p>Everything was meticulously designed, including this location, which was carefully selected.</p><p>By then, it would be the time for Qin Sang to truly enter the game!</p><p>Having arranged everything, Qin Sang raised his hand, and the yellow sands on both sides flowed towards the center, gradually closing the fissure in the earth.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede vanished into Qin Sang’s sleeve.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, confirming there were no flaws, and flew away.</p><p>He didn't return to his "Daoist Sanctuary", but travelled directly south, arriving at the Green Ram Temple to meet with his avatar.</p><p>He would not interfere in the conflicts within the Fire Domain for now, but would await the opportune moment in the temple.</p><p>Within the underground chamber.</p><p>The avatar awoke, descended from the altar, handed everything to the original body, and returned to the surface to continue his role as the master of the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>The original body sat upon the altar.</p><p>All sixty-four sub-altars had been constructed, and after years of comprehension by the avatar, he had a profound understanding of the altar formation.</p><p>However, to repair the main altar, the avatar alone was not enough; the original body had to personally intervene.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hands and skillfully formed a hand seal.</p><p>As the seal took shape, wind and thunder surged around him.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p><p>A fierce wind howled, lightning serpents danced, and amidst the flickering flashes, balls of thunderfire could be seen.</p><p>Within the small underground chamber, thunder roared like the end of the world.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained calm and unmoving.  Although the phenomena appeared terrifying, they were merely manifestations of his True Essence, unable to harm him in the slightest.</p><p>But at this moment, the altar stirred.</p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p>Suddenly, an unusual bolt of lightning struck the wind and thunder.</p><p>This lightning originated from the altar, or more precisely, from a rune on the side of the altar.</p><p>A moment before, the rune had flashed, coming to life, wriggling like a tadpole before transforming into a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The lightning struck, but did not dissipate.</p><p>The wind and thunder, drawn by some unknown force, surged towards the lightning bolt.  Absorbing the wind and thunder manifested from Qin Sang's True Essence, it shone even brighter, becoming almost solid.</p><p>Then, the sound of thunderclaps echoed continuously.</p><p>One rune after another lit up, transforming into lightning.</p><p>As more and more runes appeared, a dense swarm of lightning surrounded Qin Sang.</p><p>Enveloped by so much lightning, his figure was almost completely obscured by the radiant light.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that these lightning bolts were also distributed according to the layout of the main altar, forming a true "Thunder Altar".</p><p>This display represented Qin Sang's understanding of the altar; he was the core of the Thunder Altar!</p><p>The moment the "Thunder Altar" formed, Qin Sang's perception of the main altar and the formation grew clearer.</p><p>Finally, within the altar, the mass of lightning that had previously been impenetrable began to reveal itself.</p><p>Because the altar wasn't fully repaired, the image Qin Sang saw remained blurry, barely discernible.</p><p>Within the lightning, a page floated!</p><p>A silver page, light as a feather, seemingly weightless, composed entirely of lightning energy.</p><p>The page was covered in densely packed writing, impossible to decipher, though it was clear it wasn't ordinary script.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred; this was different from what he had expected.</p><p>If this page was merely used to record ancient secrets or inherit Dao Court incantations, while Qin Sang would gain immensely, he would be forced to change his plans.</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his mind and focused his attention.</p><p>Despite employing various methods, he couldn't make out the writing. However, he gradually noticed something unusual about the page.</p><p>"As expected!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression relaxed slightly, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p>He finally confirmed that this lightning page wasn't merely for recording, but was the embodiment of talismanic power.</p><p>As he suspected, this wasn't a sacrificial altar, but an altar for performing rituals.</p><p>This talisman was more profound than any of the third-order Divine Talismans within the Five Thunders Emissary Seal.</p><p>It was a fourth-order Divine Talisman!</p><p>Within the Dao Court, a fourth-order Divine Talisman corresponded to the River Chart Dharma Position, held by Body Integration stage cultivators!</p><p>"I wonder which fourth-order Divine Talisman it is?"</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with anticipation.</p><p>He would have to wait until the formation was restored to see the complete form of the Divine Talisman.</p><p>Eagerly, Qin Sang began to repair the main altar with all his might.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>In the four cardinal directions.</p><p>Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou, Qin Sang's four Nascent Soul subordinates, each leading a squadron of demon soldiers, occupied a sub-altar, presiding over their respective quadrants.</p><p>They comprehended the formation while assisting Qin Sang and trained the demon soldiers, imparting the Dao of Thunderfire to them.</p><p>…</p><p>Down the mountain, chaos reigned.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom, having subdued the small border nations, launched a surprise attack against the Qi Kingdom, forcing the Qi Kingdom to suffer heavy losses.</p><p>Their scheme backfired, and the Qi Kingdom retreated repeatedly, ultimately losing two states to the Yan Kingdom before managing to stabilize their lines.</p><p>At the same time, the Third Prince of the Great Liang Kingdom, having failed in his bid for the throne, defected to the Yan Kingdom, pledging allegiance to its ruler and petitioning for military support to expel the "rebellious officials and treacherous subjects."</p><p>The cultivator assigned to assist the Third Prince, named Zhaodu, was also a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>With his lord’s defeat, he joined the Yan Kingdom, obeying Yulang’s commands.</p><p>Having secured a righteous cause, the Yan Kingdom dispatched its army to the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p>Zhaodu and Tao Teng led the vanguard.  However, with the internal situation of the Yan Kingdom stabilized, Yulang's personal presence was not required.</p><p>The Yan King bestowed upon Yulang the title of Grand Marshal, Commander of All Armies, granting him command of the entire military.</p><p>Over the years, Yulang’s prestige in the Yan Kingdom had become unparalleled, and the army’s morale soared.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom, having planned for this for a long time, entered Great Liang territory, immediately raising the Third Prince’s banner.  Taking advantage of the instability following the Great Liang’s internal strife, their army advanced rapidly, conquering three states in a single month, their spearhead pointing directly at the Great Liang capital.</p><p>In an instant, the Great Liang Kingdom teetered on the brink of collapse, its people gripped by fear.</p><p>Just as victory seemed within their grasp, a secret message arrived revealing that the new ruler of the Great Liang had written to the Qi Kingdom, inviting their army south to join forces against the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>However, whether this was a strategy to use one enemy against another or a feast of conquest remained to be seen.</p><p>After deliberation, Yulang and his advisors decided to continue their advance.</p><p>Finally, the three armies met at Huang State in the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p>Huang State was located less than five hundred li from the Great Liang capital, and within its borders flowed the great Du River.</p><p>Once the army crossed the river, they could advance directly to the capital, leaving the Great Liang without any natural defenses.</p><p>For the Great Liang Kingdom, this was the final decisive battle.</p><p>The autumn wind blew bleakly.</p><p>The river was a forest of sails.</p><p>On both banks, a chilling aura filled the air, as countless soldiers stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>On the western bank of the Du River, a towering ship tower had been erected.</p><p>A group of soldiers and officers ascended the tower, led by Yulang, Tao Teng, and Zhaodu.</p><p>Yulang wore no armor, dressed in a white robe, a sword at his waist, like a scholarly general.</p><p>Tao Teng and Zhaodu, both high-ranking military officers, were fully armored, their steps carrying an imposing air.</p><p>As they reached the top of the ship tower, the scene on the river unfolded before them.</p><p>The Yan army bustled with activity, constructing boats and pontoon bridges, preparing for the impending river crossing.</p><p>On the eastern bank, the enemy army was equally active, with countless sails and ongoing construction of fortifications on land.</p><p>“A bitter battle lies ahead,” Yulang sighed softly.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom’s string of victories presented a picture of prosperity, but with each battle came greater casualties.</p><p>This contradicted their original purpose in descending into the mortal world, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>They had done their utmost.</p><p>Over these years, Yulang and Tao Teng had endured immense pressure, never daring to lose.</p><p>Only through continuous victories and a swift end to the war could they bring an end to the suffering.</p><p>Tao Teng felt a pang of sorrow.</p><p>Zhaodu, however, remained unmoved.  In his eyes, mortals were merely pawns in his pursuit of advancement.</p><p>Having lost once, he was now forced to submit to others' commands.</p><p>The greatest glory would elude him, and he could only hope he hadn’t chosen the wrong side, that Yulang was truly worthy.</p><p>What did the deaths of mortals matter to him?</p><p>Most cultivators who entered the mortal world shared Zhaodu’s mindset.</p><p>“Tomorrow, the weather will be fair, ideal for crossing the river!” Observing the celestial signs, Yulang’s expression turned solemn.  He gazed towards the east, his hand gripping his sword hilt, and issued his command in a deep voice.</p><p>“Your orders!”  The officers responded in unison.</p><p>However, before Yulang could finish speaking, a sharp whistling sound pierced the air from the enemy camp on the eastern bank.</p><p>A grey streak shot out from the enemy’s main tent, swift as an arrow, heading straight for the river.</p><p>A cackling laughter accompanied it.</p><p>“Hahaha… Better late than never! With all the army commanders gathered, it’s the perfect opportunity to catch them all in one fell swoop, saving us the trouble!”</p><p>The laughter shook the heavens, echoing like rolling thunder, clearly audible on both banks of the river.</p><p>In an instant, countless soldiers were stunned, staring blankly at the grey streak in the sky.</p><p>It was an old man!</p><p>The old man's face was withered and wrinkled, the grey streak emanating from his grey robes.</p><p>He flew through the air without any aid, each step covering hundreds of zhang, reaching the river in the blink of an eye.</p><p>All the mortals were dumbfounded, unable to believe their eyes.</p><p>Someone was actually flying!</p><p>The army erupted in commotion, some shouting “Immortal!” while others cried “Demon!”, descending into chaos.</p><p>This scene, which existed only in myths and legends, was now unfolding before their very eyes.</p><p>The expressions of Yulang and the other two changed.</p><p>Someone had broken the rules!</p><p>Based on the strength of the opposing forces, the Yan Kingdom was slightly weaker, but both the Qi and Great Liang Kingdoms had been defeated by them before, their morale far lower.</p><p>Barring unforeseen circumstances, the Yan Kingdom had a greater chance of victory!</p><p>The opposing cultivator had lost patience and chosen to intervene personally.</p><p>Moreover, this old man possessed extremely high cultivation.</p><p>The old man hovered over the river and flicked his dust whisk.  The river water abruptly solidified, cracking sounds echoing as it instantly froze into a thick layer of ice.</p><p>The ice was a strange, black color.</p><p>With this single move, he could easily kill the three of them!</p><p>The old man’s gaze was icy as he looked towards the ship tower, finally settling on Yulang, killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>His gaze was like a sword, causing the three of them to tremble, their blood seemingly freezing in their veins.</p><p>In this moment of crisis, a fully armored soldier behind Yulang shifted slightly, about to step forward. He suddenly stopped, looking downriver.</p><p>Several streaks of azure light streaked across the sky above the river, accompanied by a powerful shout.</p><p>“Old Devil Yu, I knew you couldn't resist.  Leave the mortal world to the younger generation. Bullying the weak is hardly impressive. Let this old man meet you!”</p><p>The armored soldier was Sha Jiayu.  Seeing the newcomers, his eyes flashed, and he whispered, “It’s Patriarch Kuang!”</p><p>The situation had changed!</p><p>Yulang and Tao Teng exchanged glances, the same thought flashing through their minds.</p><p>The cultivators were directly intervening, engaging in battle at the front lines.</p><p>Was it their proposal that had moved Tao Teng’s master, or was this a prearranged plan?</p><p>Yulang couldn’t understand, but he remained calm.  Seeing the enemy army charging across the ice, he ordered his officers to quickly restore order and instructed Sha Jiayu to help him fly into the air.</p><p>“Demonic evils run rampant; all must unite to destroy them! Soldiers, follow me to slay the demons!”</p><p>Seeing that their side also had Immortals, and that their leader was one of them, the panicked army’s morale immediately stabilized, erupting in thunderous cheers.</p><p>The old man’s face darkened. He was about to swing his dust whisk and kill Yulang.</p><p>A streak of azure light arrived at high speed, blocking the old man’s path.  A refined scholar materialized.</p><p>Patriarch Kuang nodded to Yulang, stomped his foot in mid-air, and the ice shattered with a boom, sending the Qi and Liang soldiers plunging into the river, their screams filling the air.</p><p>The old man snorted coldly and flicked his dust whisk at Patriarch Kuang.</p><p>Unfazed, Patriarch Kuang summoned a short, azure sword.  It transformed into a streak of sword light, clashing with the dust whisk.</p><p>Grey mist filled the air above the river, interspersed with flashes of sword light, creating a daunting scene.</p><p>The other streaks of azure light arrived shortly after, but they didn't join the battle between the two Nascent Soul Patriarchs.  Instead, they flew to Yulang.</p><p>They were all disciples of the Kuang Clan, and they bowed to Yulang in unison, presenting him with a command arrow.</p><p>“The Seven Sons of Kuang, acting on Immortal Master Yun’s command, are here to assist General Qin! The Immortal Master has decreed that General Qin, a brilliant military strategist with unparalleled wisdom and talent, shall command the armies of Qi, Liang, Yan, Zhao, and Xuan, both mortal and immortal.  All shall obey General Qin’s command, assisting him in slaying demons and evils, and establishing immortal merit!”</p>
