<h1>Chapter 1418:  Zhongzhou</h1><p>Chapter 1418:  Zhongzhou</p><p>This contradicts Qin Sang's earlier assessment.</p><p>Could Gui Mu not be an ancient monster?</p><p>A master of her caliber shouldn't be unknown. Why are there no legends of her in Beihai?</p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, about to speak, when he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>Overjoyed at this reunion with an old friend, he almost forgot the most important thing, and quickly asked, "Brother Qin, how did you get in?"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed upwards, "Naturally, by breaking the formation. Didn't you?"</p><p>Tan Hao chuckled wryly, repeatedly saying, "Bad news! Brother Qin, you don't know, this Jinghai Sect is a huge seal itself.  I heard from a senior that the underground fire veins for hundreds of miles around have been moved here by an ancient master with great power, accumulating an astonishing amount of red flame energy, potentially erupting at any time. Now the seal is on the verge of collapse.  Senior Gui Mu hesitated for a long time before devising an alternative method, trying to minimize damage to the seal before daring to enter. The protective formation is broken, I fear…"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>The signs he'd discovered after entering Jinghai Sect had already led him to similar speculations.</p><p>"I'm not the only one who came in. Hun Mo Lao Ren and others are also here, probably already searching for treasures. How much longer can the Jinghai Sect's seal hold?"</p><p>"Hun Mo Lao Ren, he's here too!"</p><p>Tan Hao clearly knew of Hun Mo Lao Ren's reputation, and was startled. "The seal is already extremely fragile, teetering on the brink of collapse. The restrictions in the pagoda, the golden peak, and the medicinal garden are all part of the seal, like weak pillars.  Damaging any one of them will further damage the seal.  That's why the senior only took some treasures; she intended to let me retrieve the rest after I formed my Nascent Soul, as a kind of test.  Earlier, Brother Qin, you must have been picking herbs? I thought it was the seal being shaken by the red flames, but it turns out this place has already been exposed."</p><p>The most precious treasures in Jinghai Sect have already been taken by Gui Mu.</p><p>What Gui Mu didn't take, the Spirit Lamp Flowers and other herbs left for Tan Hao, were still treasures that would make even a Nascent Soul cultivator's heart race.</p><p>Gui Mu's strength is evident.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>No wonder Qi Wang and the other two suddenly found Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Calculating the timing, the anomaly was caused when Tan Hao and Gui Mu entered. It's just that the anomaly lasted too short a time, and the situation within Jinghai Sect was too complex, so they overlooked it.</p><p>"Senior Gui Mu isn't here? I also wanted to ask her to save someone."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, explaining his intentions.</p><p>He wasn't so concerned about the treasures in Jinghai Sect, he urgently wanted to see Gui Mu and ask if Ya Gu could be saved. From Tan Hao's tone, Gui Mu not only kept her word but also treated him well, so her temperament must be not bad.</p><p>Ya Gu's situation is similar to Tan Jie's.</p><p>Both were planted with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman in the Qi Refinement stage, having long surpassed their lifespan.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, good or bad, there needs to be closure.</p><p>"You too…"</p><p>Tan Hao was startled, looking sadly at Tan Jie's grave, lamenting, "Brother Qin, you're too late. The senior has already left Beihai."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, and quickly asked, "Did she go to Bei Chen Realm?"</p><p>"No," Tan Hao shook his head, hesitating before saying,  "The senior said she was going to a place called Zhongzhou, I don't know where that is. After returning to Beihai, she had been searching for a sea chart, even going so far as to infiltrate Xuan Tian Sect and causing a great disturbance. She also broke into Jinghai Sect for this purpose, successfully obtaining the sea chart, and immediately set off. She left me in Jinghai Sect because it is sufficiently hidden, and Jinghai Sect is extremely unusual; morning and evening bells ring every day, which can clarify the soul and benefit my breakthrough…"</p><p>Zhongzhou.</p><p>Gui Mu caused chaos at Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Tan Hao's words were packed with information.</p><p>Qin Sang had questions when he learned the name Beihai; what is 'Bei' relative to?</p><p>It seems that Zhongzhou is another cultivation world.</p><p>I wonder what kind of world it is, whether it's a similar cage, or has a different landscape?</p><p>Jinghai Sect actually has a sea chart leading to Zhongzhou!</p><p>Its origins are extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he questioned Tan Hao, learning that he hadn't seen the sea chart.</p><p>It was a pity, too late, not only missing the chance to save Ya Gu, but also missing the sea chart.</p><p>However, Gui Mu's initial target was Xuan Tian Palace. Could Xuan Tian Palace also have a sea chart leading to Zhongzhou?</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace, which dominates a realm and has thrived for a long time, has a high probability.</p><p>Wait...</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered the mysterious ice box in the Qianjun ring.  Could that man in white have stolen it from there during the chaos at Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>Unexpectedly, her experiences in the North Sea were connected to the Ghost Mother.</p><p>"I'm a little confused.  What exactly is Ghost Mother's background?"</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>Tan Hao hesitated for a moment, then decided to tell Qin Sang everything.  Even though resurrecting Tan Jie had failed, it couldn't erase Qin Sang's kindness towards them.  He was not an ungrateful person.  The Ghost Mother hadn't forbidden him from revealing this information.</p><p>Learning that the Hun Mo Old Man had appeared at Jing Hai Sect, Tan Hao knew those treasures no longer belonged to him.</p><p>"I heard from the senior that she's not a present-day cultivator. She had been sleeping here."</p><p>Tan Hao glanced down at the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.  It seemed he hadn't guessed wrong.</p><p>Tan Hao continued, "Also, a demon is sealed here.  The Jing Hai Sect was the guardian of the seal."</p><p>Another demon!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.  She muttered to herself that she was truly cursed by ancient demons.  Others might not encounter one in a lifetime, but she had already met three!</p><p>"There was an accident with the seal.  Jing Hai Sect exhausted all their resources to stabilize it, and the entire sect perished.  The Ghost Mother also awoke because of that incident. After awakening, she searched for someone.  After recovering some of her strength, she went to Bei Chen Region, but unexpectedly encountered Tian Yue Shang Ren, fought a great battle, and was sealed in the Yuanxu Abyss by him."</p><p>Tan Hao recounted the Ghost Mother's experiences before being imprisoned in the water dungeon. He then explained, "When we returned to the North Sea, the senior first went to Xuan Tian Palace. She didn't want to enter Jing Hai Sect, worried that the demon was still alive and that it would cause a great disaster.  Luckily, the demon didn't appear... well, at least there's no trace of the demon in the seal anymore."</p><p>Tian Yue Shang Ren.</p><p>That formidable figure who fought across the North Sea and stood like a sword at the heavens' edge!  Even ancient cultivators were no match for him. Tian Yue Shang Ren probably considered the Ghost Mother a rule-breaking intruder.</p><p>Qin Sang silently mourned for the Ghost Mother.</p><p>"Who is the Ghost Mother looking for?"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted Tan Hao and asked.</p><p>Could there be other ancient monsters lurking in the cultivation world, usually inconspicuous?  Thinking of the man in white, the Jade Bone Demon, and the Ghost Mother, Qin Sang thought it highly possible.</p><p>This world held too many secrets.</p><p>"The senior said she was looking for a descendant of the Wu Tribe, but the North Sea and Bei Chen Region are both human realms."</p><p>Tan Hao spoke, his face showing confusion and bewilderment. He only knew the what, not the why. He only learned about the Wu Tribe from the Ghost Mother.</p>
