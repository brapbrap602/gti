Chapter 370: The Cold Gold Motherlode


Even the strong among them were harassed and pursued by the evil spirits.
Kong Xin dashed into a cave, and everyone hurriedly followed, but unexpectedly, this mountain cave turned out to be a dead end!
In an instant, the cave entrance was blocked by evil spirits, and the ghostly howls outside became increasingly piercing, it was unknown how many evil spirits in the underground cavern had been disturbed.
Everyone's faces changed drastically, their eyes fixed unkindly on Kong Xin, including Qin Sang, who had already developed murderous intent.
Kong Xin, in order to take a shortcut, told a few harmless little lies, which was understandable, but directly leading people into a dead end was tantamount to endangering lives, an unforgivable crime!
"You're courting death!"
The woman in red flew into a rage, her magic weapon pointed at Kong Xin, killing intent exposed!
Unexpectedly, Kong Xin's expression was calm and composed, as if he had nothing to fear.
Qin Sang frowned, secretly wondering what Kong Xin's intentions were. He had also come in, so if they were to die, he would certainly die first; no fool would plot such a scheme to profit from harming others.
Thinking this, Qin Sang shifted his gaze from Kong Xin to observe the surrounding environment. After seeing the cave walls clearly, his eyes narrowed slightly.
At this time, Kong Xin calmly pointed to the depths of the cave, "Everyone, look at these walls, what's different about them compared to the outside?"
Everyone was startled and looked sideways.
After Kong Xin's reminder, everyone realized that the walls here were not like the completely black stones outside; within the walls, a faint white cold light emanated.
In the most conspicuous spot, one could even see the outline of a crystal about the size of a fingernail.
"These…"
The first to recognize this cold light was a cultivator surnamed Bao.  He said in astonishment, "Could it be the Cold Gold Motherlode?"
"Cold Gold?"
Most of them had heard of Cold Gold.
Qin Sang recognized it even before the cultivator surnamed Bao.
The manual given to him by the shop owner Wu contained descriptions of some rare spiritual materials, including Cold Gold.  Adding Cold Gold to magic weapons not only imbues them with extreme cold properties but also increases their durability; it is a rare material indeed.
Unexpectedly, before they even truly entered the depths of the Wuyaya Valley, they had encountered a Cold Gold vein; it was truly a treasure land.
Kong Xin nodded.
"That's right, these are indeed Cold Gold Motherlodes. After refinement, you can obtain the precious spiritual material, Cold Gold.
"Originally, the number of ghostly creatures gathered above was far more than this; tens of thousands of ghostly creatures occupied the surrounding mountains, making it a den of vipers and dragons, where no one dared to trespass. This secret passage was thus undiscovered.
"If not, the Cold Gold Motherlode would have been mined long ago.
"After this great upheaval, I discovered that this ghost nest has undergone a drastic change, with a sharp decrease in the number of ghostly creatures, so I secretly infiltrated to investigate and discovered this secret passage and the Cold Gold Motherlode.
"Unfortunately, my cultivation is low, and I am unable to mine it alone, nor dare I publicize it. If I were to cooperate with other forces, I might be devoured completely, so I had to resort to this tactic.
"If you don't want the Cold Gold, I won't force you. Let's work together to get out; the exit is not far ahead, and escape will be easy.
"However, the secret here is unlikely to remain hidden for long. This secret passage will eventually be discovered, and then the Cold Gold Motherlode will fall into the hands of others…
"To enter a treasure mountain and return empty-handed, I wonder if you would find that regrettable?"
The cultivator surnamed Bao asked doubtfully, "What do you mean? You're willing to share this Cold Gold Motherlode with us?"
Kong Xin said calmly, "Those who see it have a share; I understand this principle.  The extracted Cold Gold Motherlode will be equally divided among everyone here, as my apology. Otherwise, wouldn’t you all just lightly let me off? Besides, with evil spirits lurking outside, extracting the Cold Gold Motherlode requires everyone's cooperation."
At this moment, more and more evil spirits were drawn in, impacting the cave entrance, and the pressure on everyone was increasing.
Kong Xin finished speaking and closed his mouth, waiting for others to decide.
The cultivator surnamed Bao suddenly chuckled, looking around at everyone, "Treasure is before us; fellow cultivators, you won't just give up like this, will you? Although the evil spirits are strong, as long as everyone uses their trump cards and works together to resist, it should not be difficult to hold out for a while; at that time we can mine as much as we can, and retreat immediately if the situation becomes unfavorable. We are all seasoned people who understand the trade-offs; as long as we pay attention to the extent, do we still need to fear the fate of being destroyed for coveting something? ”
Qin Sang was also somewhat tempted.
A Cold Gold Motherlode the size of a fist can only refine a grain of Cold Gold. But the entire wall of the cave is emitting a cold light. If the vein is large enough, even if everyone shares equally, it will still be worthwhile.
However, the most important thing is still the main task.
Qin Sang looked inquiringly at Yunyouzi, who nodded slightly, expressing no objection.


Clearly, the lure of the cold gold proved too strong for everyone; no one pursued Kong Xin's earlier actions.

Without delay, the group adjusted their formation, joining forces to withstand the onslaught of the ghosts, buying Kong Xin time. Kong Xin produced a shimmering blue sword, infused it with spiritual energy, and with a flash of blue light, struck the rock face.

*Bang!*

A sharp crack echoed. The blue light vanished, and everyone was astonished.

Kong Xin's full-powered strike had only left a shallow scratch on the stone!

Kong Xin chuckled wryly, "This place is where the mother lode of cold gold was born. The entire vein is affected by it, making these stones unusually hard. This blue sword is the sharpest I could find, after exhausting all my resources. I've also tried other methods, including five-element spells, but to no avail. We'll have to resort to brute force and slowly mine it…"

The others exchanged bewildered glances.

If Kong Xin could only make a scratch with a single blow, how long would it take to mine the entire vein?

"I don't believe a few pieces of rock can withstand magical artifacts!"

A woman in red snorted, withdrew her ghost-repelling artifact, and redirected it towards the rock face, stabbing fiercely.

*Pfft!*

The needle-like artifact easily pierced the stone, but before the woman could rejoice, she felt a powerful resistance. It only penetrated less than an inch before it was firmly stuck.

The artifact vibrated, attempting to break the stone, but the rock remained unyielding.

The woman in red, her face cycling through shades of green and white, withdrew the artifact after several more unsuccessful attempts, remaining silent.

The cultivator surnamed Bao and the elder summoned their own artifacts, with little better results than Kong Xin.

Kong Xin silently continued to hack away with his sword, but his progress was painfully slow; he needed dozens of strikes to unearth a single piece of cold gold ore.

Qin Sang swung the Black Dragon Stone, repeatedly striking the ghosts outside, but they seemed endless.  Even with their combined efforts, how long could they hold out was uncertain.

Considering this, Qin Sang exchanged a few whispered words with Yun Youzi, then spoke aloud, "Daoist Kong, I have a spiritual sword, though not of high quality, its sharpness is quite exceptional. Perhaps I could take over mining the cold gold, while you focus on defending against the ghosts."

The ebony sword was crafted from fragments of a magical artifact and then tempered with a killing talisman.  Its sharpness far surpasses any other artifact.
