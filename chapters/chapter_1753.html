<h1>Chapter 1744: The Blood Sun</h1><p>The Wu Clan, being the weakest among the three major clans, urgently needed time to recuperate and was the least inclined to reignite the flames of war. Qin Sang's mediation was exactly what the Wu Clan desired, and there was almost no resistance within the clan. After a brief discussion with a few Wu Clan elders during the banquet, Fang Laomo made a decisive decision.</p><p>Although the Wu Clan was currently confined to a small territory, they had dominated the Canglang Sea far longer than the human race and knew many secrets that the humans were unaware of. Qin Sang held them in high regard.</p><p>The banquet ended on a harmonious note, but they still had to wait for Fang Laomo to issue orders to various sects and search for the items Qin Sang needed. Qin Sang stayed overnight at the Wu Shen Mountain.</p><p>The Wu Shen Mountain had erected a celestial curtain to block the thunderous light. In the courtyard, the shadows of the trees swayed gently. Qin Sang looked up and could still see the faint silver streaks of lightning in the sky. At that moment, someone approached from outside the courtyard—it was Fang Laomo.</p><p>"True Lord Qin, you summoned me. What urgent matter requires my attention?" Fang Laomo asked.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his gaze and took out a prepared jade slip, handing it over. Fang Laomo was slightly surprised. He took it and, after just a glance, was deeply engrossed. Finally, with great difficulty, he pulled himself away and took a deep breath.</p><p>"Thank you, True Lord, for this generous gift. I am unworthy. Please, speak your command clearly!" Fang Laomo said.</p><p>The jade slip contained divine patterns Qin Sang had learned from the Ghost Mother. One of them was particularly special, as it was an imprint taken from the Ghost Mother's physical body after her ascension. Although Fang Laomo might not possess the Ghost Mother's divine abilities, thoroughly understanding these patterns would greatly benefit his current state.</p><p>"I have no other requests. I only seek a few spiritual herbs, all listed here," Qin Sang said, looking at the jade slip.</p><p>Fang Laomo, who had been too excited to notice earlier, quickly reviewed the list again. Seeing that most of the herbs were beneficial to spirit insects, he realized Qin Sang must also be cultivating spirit insects. After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Our clan's treasury can provide most of these, but we lack the Heavenly Centipede Root."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, "Do you also have the Bo Shui Spirit Flower?"</p><p>The Heavenly Centipede Root and Bo Shui Spirit Flower were two of the three main ingredients for the Qing Frost Pill. Qin Sang had already obtained the Hundred Insect Grass. Judging from Fang Laomo's tone, he could also provide the missing supplementary herbs and the Bo Shui Spirit Flower.</p><p>Seeing Fang Laomo's affirmation, Qin Sang was overjoyed. The Qing Frost Pill was now only missing the Heavenly Centipede Root! Although he dared not let the Heavenly Eye Butterfly undergo its fifth transformation yet, having the Qing Frost Pill prepared in advance was not a bad idea.</p><p>He had previously inquired and found that the Wu Clan did not have the spiritual herbs needed for high-grade Spirit-Calming Incense. Obtaining these herbs was still a consolation.</p><p>Fang Laomo immediately ordered his trusted subordinates to fetch the herbs. He subtly probed Qin Sang about the origin of the divine patterns, but Qin Sang, unwilling to reveal the Ghost Mother's background, evaded the question, leaving Fang Laomo disappointed.</p><p>Soon, the herbs were delivered. Qin Sang accepted them and, after dismissing the others, ran his finger over the Thousand Jun Ring, revealing the Star Platform in his hand. "Brother Fang, do you recognize this?"</p><p>He had just tested it in his room and found no reaction from the Star Platform.</p><p>Fang Laomo looked at the Star Platform, initially puzzled, then suddenly remembered something and stood up in shock. "This item..."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, noticing that the Star Wing Cicada, which had been dormant in Fang Laomo's brain palace, seemed to awaken and was now staring intently at the Star Platform.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, Fang Laomo instinctively looked back. Their eyes met, and Fang Laomo felt as if his mind had been laid bare. He knew that if he did not explain, Qin Sang would not let the matter rest.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Fang Laomo clasped his hands and said, "To be honest, True Lord, this item closely resembles a treasure depicted in the murals of our clan's sacred mountain shrine. Our clan has been searching for it for a long time but has found no trace. I never expected you to possess it."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the mountain peak, where an ancient stone hall stood. "Is that the Wu Shen Shrine? Since this treasure is related to the shrine, do you know its powers?"</p><p>"The shrine has been revered as a holy place and is where our clan holds grand ceremonies. However, the shrine itself has never displayed any divine powers. As for the treasure depicted in the murals, we are not even sure if it truly exists, so we do not know its powers," Fang Laomo explained.</p><p>Qin Sang gave him a deep look and said, "May I enter the shrine to take a look?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Fang Laomo hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.</p><p>Both of them were highly skilled and moved without alerting anyone, quickly arriving before the shrine. The shrine was more symbolic, and there were no supreme treasures inside, so the protective restrictions were not particularly strong.</p><p>Fang Laomo opened the shrine, and Qin Sang stepped inside. The thunderous light illuminated the interior. The hall was built with square stones, and the rough walls were adorned with a colorful mural. The lines were straight, and the brushstrokes were simple, yet they exuded an ancient and majestic beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the mural, which depicted a group of people gathered before a stone hall. There seemed to be inscriptions, but they had long been erased. The stone hall was the very shrine they were in. The figures were sketched with a few strokes, lacking distinct features, making it unclear whether they were from the Wu Clan or the human race.</p><p>Inside the shrine stood a figure with its back to the crowd, bowing before a circular stone platform. The platform was bathed in starlight, connecting to the heavens. This was the entirety of the mural.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down and saw that the ground was flat, with no depressions, but it was carved with intricate patterns of unknown significance. In the center of the pattern was a circle, perfectly matching the size of the Star Platform in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>He concentrated, feeling that the dots and lines on the pattern were some kind of unfamiliar runes. After some contemplation, he found no clues. Glancing at Fang Laomo, he did not hesitate further. He wrapped the Star Platform in his true essence and placed it in the center.</p><p>Before it even touched the ground, Qin Sang sensed something unusual and focused his gaze. The Star Platform seemed to be drawn by some force, landing firmly on the ground. The ground trembled, and starlight erupted, not just from the Star Platform but from the entire pattern on the ground. The shrine was filled with a dreamlike radiance.</p><p>Qin Sang and Fang Laomo exchanged glances, both showing surprise and wariness. Immediately after, a familiar sensation washed over them.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly looked up and was astonished to see the Milky Way and the deep starry sky directly above with his naked eyes. The roof of the hall and the clouds and thunder in the sky had disappeared. Countless stars seemed to be right above their heads, shimmering brightly, and it was no illusion!</p><p>The starlight flickered, as if breathing in sync with something. Qin Sang shifted his gaze, staring intently at the Star Platform. The entire platform had now merged with the pattern on the ground, autonomously gathering starlight. A deep, azure light spread along the pattern, filling the entire shrine.</p><p>The two instinctively stepped back to the shrine's entrance. Looking up, the dark clouds and thunder were still there, yet none of the other Nascent Soul cultivators practicing in the Wu Shen Mountain's caves seemed to notice!</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved as if he was about to ask something when the changes inside the shrine suddenly accelerated. One by one, runes were lit by starlight, jumping out of the ground like living creatures, twisting like earthworms.</p><p>In an instant, countless runes floated up, densely filling the shrine's space, all composed of starlight, casting a serene glow. In the blink of an eye, the runes solidified, connected by thin threads of starlight, all linked to the Star Platform. Centered around the Star Platform, they formed an incredibly complex array.</p><p>As soon as the array was complete, the stars in the sky seemed to respond, suddenly brightening. Starlight poured down, the threads tightened, and the runes were drawn together, quickly forming circular platforms floating in mid-air, resembling miniature Star Platforms.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the arrangement of the platforms looked familiar. Counting them, there were twenty-eight, corresponding to the twenty-eight constellations in the sky, forming a celestial star array.</p><p>Wait, no—there should be twenty-nine!</p><p>The Star Platform had become transparent, almost entirely composed of starlight. By now, the shrine had stabilized, but the purpose of the array was still unclear. Qin Sang slightly sensed the energy within and his expression changed.</p><p>Fang Laomo looked over. "True Lord?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>Fang Laomo immediately took out twenty-nine mid-grade spirit stones. Both he and Qin Sang had sensed that the twenty-eight floating platforms were meant to hold spirit stones, including the Star Platform, which now had a vacant spot where starlight once floated.</p><p>The array's purpose was unknown, so they decided to try with low-grade spirit stones first. Fang Laomo flicked his fingers.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The spirit stones fell into place.</p><p>The shrine lit up with dazzling light. The two were on high alert when suddenly the light dimmed and returned to normal. Looking at the spirit stones on the platforms, they were pale and cracked, completely drained of spiritual energy in an instant.</p><p>Fang Laomo was not surprised and was about to take out high-grade spirit stones when Qin Sang's eyes flashed with brilliance. "Wait!"</p><p>Fang Laomo was slightly startled as Qin Sang shot out several streams of light, transforming into eight large banners that planted themselves around the shrine. The banners swayed, releasing thick white mist that sealed the shrine.</p><p>Realizing Qin Sang must have noticed something, Fang Laomo did not ask further and instead took out high-grade spirit stones. The high-grade spirit stones were indeed different. The starlight from the array lasted much longer, and Qin Sang faintly sensed a strange fluctuation connecting to the starry palace.</p><p>Looking up at the shrine's dome, the myriad stars seemed to be drawn closer by the array. The shrine was filled with profound starlight, and a powerful stellar force flowed between the array's formations.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Fang Laomo felt as if they were being pulled towards the starry sky, sensing a vast, ancient intent.</p><p>Before they could fully comprehend it, a 'crack' sound was heard.</p><p>Their expressions changed, and they quickly looked towards the center of the array. The spirit stones in the twenty-eight constellations' positions were intact, but the one on the central Star Platform had cracked.</p><p>Fang Laomo hurriedly tried to replace the spirit stone, but it was too late. The array's energy became chaotic, and with a loud explosion, all twenty-eight high-grade spirit stones shattered simultaneously. A violent force nearly destroyed the array and overturned the shrine.</p><p>Looking at the chaotic shrine, Qin Sang did not rush to act. He stopped the anxious Fang Laomo and asked, "Do you have any supreme-grade spirit stones in the mountain?"</p><p>"Supreme-grade spirit stones?"</p><p>Fang Laomo was stunned. He had planned to try using a few high-grade spirit stones to sustain the array, but Qin Sang's words implied that only supreme-grade spirit stones would suffice!</p><p>Supreme-grade spirit stones were extremely rare treasures. Any cultivator who obtained one would treat it as a priceless gem. Even a top-tier spirit vein might not produce a single one, and finding one in an entire region was a rarity.</p><p>Even if the Wu Clan had once possessed such treasures, after numerous battles, they now had none left.</p><p>The Wu Clan's heritage included several ancient arrays of immense power. Once activated, they could deter both humans and demons. However, all required supreme-grade spirit stones, rendering them unusable.</p><p>The human and demon races were likely in a similar predicament.</p><p>The fact that this array required supreme-grade spirit stones greatly diminished Fang Laomo's expectations. He frowned and asked, "True Lord, have you discerned the origin of this array?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, "After searching far and wide, I found it without any effort!"</p><p>"What? This is the Ascension Platform?"</p><p>Fang Laomo was both shocked and delighted. He took a deep breath to calm himself, then asked with doubt, "Why is this array different from what you described?"</p><p>"Indeed, it is different," Qin Sang nodded. "May I ask, what is the origin of this shrine?"</p><p>Fang Laomo hesitated for a moment before revealing a secret.</p><p>It turned out that whether the Wu Shen Mountain and the Wu Shen Shrine were truly the dwelling places of the Wu God was still uncertain. There was a theory that during a period of turmoil, the current Grand Shaman had claimed it as such to stabilize the people's hearts.</p><p>Regardless of its authenticity, the shrine's status as a holy place in the hearts of Wu Clan cultivators was unshakable.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. No wonder there were no obvious Wu Clan traces in the array's patterns—the Wu Clan themselves were uncertain.</p><p>He looked up at the sky and murmured, "This array should not be called the Ascension Platform. It is more fitting to call it the Reception Platform!"</p><p>When the star array activated, he had felt a familiar sensation, similar to when the Ghost Mother had broken through the boundaries and ascended. That was why he was so certain.</p><p>Deep within the starry sea, there seemed to be an unknown force resonating with the array, becoming particularly clear just before the spirit stones shattered.</p><p>The Ascension Platform did not exhibit such behavior.</p><p>It was clear that this world and the outside were communicating through stellar forces, even constructing a starlight channel to break through the boundary. No wonder the Star Platform could connect with the stars.</p><p>Qin Sang was now both pleased and worried.</p><p>He was pleased because his efforts had finally paid off. After traveling through various regions, he had finally found a way out. Moreover, if the reception was still active, it would be easier than using the Ascension Platform.</p><p>He was worried because he did not know which powerful being was behind the reception.</p><p>One thing was certain: he was no match for that being. If it were a human powerhouse or a Wu Clan powerhouse allied with the Ghost Mother, it would be fine. But if it were a demonic entity, he might escape one cage only to fall into another.</p><p>As he pondered, the shrine returned to calm.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the star array, his heart stirring. He transformed his true essence into a hand and reached out to the Star Platform. With a loud 'clang,' he slowly lifted the platform.</p><p>Without the Star Platform, the shrine reverted to an ordinary stone hall.</p><p>Qin Sang had already memorized the array's patterns and the runes on the ground, planning to make a copy.</p><p>As he stored the Star Platform, he noticed Fang Laomo's hesitant expression. Qin Sang said solemnly, "The origin of this array is unclear. I will find a way to investigate. Once it is clarified, when the time for ascension comes, there will be a place for you, Brother Fang."</p><p>Fang Laomo's face lit up with joy, but before he could speak, Qin Sang waved his hand to stop him. "Although this is the Wu Clan's shrine, it may be the only way out of this world. It cannot be monopolized by the Wu Clan. In the future, I will set up a grand array here. No matter where one comes from or their lineage, they must ascend from here."</p><p>"From now on, this mountain will be a holy land of this world. Our clan is willing to swear an oath to protect this holy land forever. No matter which fellow daoist arrives, we will treat them equally and impose no restrictions," Fang Laomo naturally saw the benefits. The Wu Clan would transform into a guardian clan, and with the True Lord's decree, who would dare provoke them?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. "Send word to Palace Master Bao and the Demon Sea. From now on, you must work together to uncover the shrine's origins and gather supreme-grade spirit stones. I will return to the Central Continent soon and summon fellow daoists from other regions to search through ancient texts. At the latest, I will return within a hundred years."</p><p>Not to mention that he only had one supreme-grade spirit stone, even if he had more, he could not act recklessly.</p><p>Supreme-grade spirit stones were extremely rare. Not a single one could be wasted. Without knowing if the star array had other uses besides reception, they needed to prepare in advance.</p><p>Even if they decided to take this path, before ascending, they needed to enhance their ability to adapt as much as possible. The plans for the Kirin Origin Seed and the Great Dipper Chariot were not yet complete, so Qin Sang was in no hurry.</p><p>...</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>A streak of light flew out of the Wu Shen Continent, heading west. Qin Sang planned to return to the Central Continent immediately to make arrangements as soon as possible.</p><p>He now knew the locations of the various continents and could take shortcuts without strictly following the sea charts.</p><p>The top sects of the Central Continent likely had supreme-grade spirit stones in their treasuries. At the very least, the first batch of ascendants should be guaranteed.</p><p>Qin Sang was not worried about a lack of pioneers. By then, there would surely be those nearing the end of their lifespans willing to lead the way.</p><p>However, being separated by two worlds, their usefulness would likely be limited.</p><p>Regardless, finding the Reception Platform was good news for both him and Liuli.</p><p>This trip had truly been worthwhile. He now had more options!</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang flew over the ocean, briefly stopping at the Riftwind Archipelago.</p><p>The Peach Blossom Island, where Senior Qingzhu had once stayed, now had a new owner. Qin Sang did not reveal himself, only paying his respects from afar.</p><p>After leaving the Riftwind Archipelago, he was not far from the storm belt.</p><p>"If there's time, I should search for shelters and open a sea route, allowing great cultivators to travel to the Canglang Sea. However, supreme-grade spirit stones are ultimately limited. It's just a thought..."</p><p>Qin Sang mused. With the Wu Clan's sea charts as a foundation, it wouldn't take much effort, just some time.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>The storm was no longer a threat to him. Qin Sang casually activated his protective spiritual barrier and, without stopping, passed through the barrier and entered the storm belt.</p><p>Not long after flying out, Qin Sang suddenly felt something was amiss. He snapped out of his thoughts and looked up in alarm.</p><p>The surrounding storm had unknowingly turned blood-red. In the</p>
