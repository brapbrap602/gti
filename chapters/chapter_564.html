<h1>Chapter 557: Yuan Ying Gathering</h1><p>Outside the Pass.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the sound, immediately spotting Chen Yan, cloaked.</p><p>Chen Yan stood alone at the edge of a barrier, gazing at the surging spiritual tide outside.  Her demeanor was aloof and distant; her expression hidden beneath the cloak, no one dared approach her.</p><p>To Chen Yan's left, a man in brocade robes and a long-bearded Daoist were conversing.</p><p>These two showed no aura whatsoever, easily mistaken for ordinary people.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, even facing a Core Formation cultivator, she could sense a faint trace of true energy unless they deliberately concealed it.</p><p>It was impossible to encounter mortals here.  This meant their cultivation far surpassed her own!</p><p>Seeing them, Qin Sang's heart tightened, feeling an inexplicable pressure.</p><p>They stood before the barrier, the terrifying spiritual tide causing it to tremble incessantly, as if it would burst through at any moment.  Yet, the two remained calm, seemingly oblivious to the tide.</p><p>The man in brocade robes spoke.</p><p>Dongyang Bo!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  After nearly a century of discipleship, she finally saw her Grandmaster in person.</p><p>The other person, able to stand on equal footing with Dongyang Bo, must also be a Yuan Ying cultivator.  Was it Taiyi Danzong's Grandmaster, Chongyi Daochang, or Shangyuan Qingjing Palace's Palace Master, Tieguanzi?</p><p>Dongyang Bo spoke, and the Liu family Core Formation cultivator dared not make trouble again; he obediently responded and immediately allowed passage.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed Master Fengming, quickly stepping forward to pay their respects to Dongyang Bo.  "Disciples greet Grandmaster!"</p><p>"Rise."</p><p>Dongyang Bo nodded slightly, saying lightly, "Fengming, take them to wait aside."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qin Sang obediently retreated to the side, quietly observing the scene.</p><p>Yunyouzi hadn't arrived yet. Besides Dongyang Bo, Chen Yan, and the mysterious Daoist, they were all Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Several had appeared in the Turbulent Island waters. Some were from Taiyi Danzong, while more came from other sects stationed at Xuanlu Pass.</p><p>Among them, only Master Fengming was from Shaohua Mountain, and there wasn't a single person from Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, causing Qin Sang to secretly wonder.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou had only recently reached Core Formation; it was understandable he wasn't at Ziwei Palace.</p><p>But the other senior masters, all veteran Core Formation cultivators – none of them went to Ziwei Palace either?</p><p>As Qin Sang secretly assessed the situation, the Daoist also glanced at them, somewhat puzzled, but instead of directly asking Dongyang Bo's intentions, he said indirectly,  "Dongyang Daoist, with so many pseudo-Core Formation disciples, do you still have the strength to protect others? Disciples of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, and other sects under your sect's banner, also need your protection, right?  Did they all go to the Ziwei Secret Realm?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo smiled slightly.</p><p>"Chongyi Daoist, haven't you noticed I only brought two disciples?</p><p>"To ensure fairness, we powerful sects cannot participate extensively in vying for the Ziwei Secret Realm. I wouldn't put myself in the spotlight.</p><p>"Tieguan Daoist wishes to allow his sect to rest and recuperate. Only he is venturing into Ziwei Palace this time. With Tieguan Daoist's strength, he doesn't need my concern.</p><p>"I have a way to allow five of them to combine forces, exceeding their own cultivation level.</p><p>"As for the younger generation from other sects, there won't be too many. I will do my best to protect them."</p><p>Chongyi Daoist nodded, then suddenly remembered something and exclaimed, "Tieguan Daoist leaving Shangyuan Qingjing Palace alone… is it almost time…"</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed softly, "Indeed, Chongyi Daoist remembers correctly."</p><p>Chongyi Daoist sighed, "Tieguan Daoist's chances of forming a Yuan Ying should have been considerable.  Combined with Shangyuan Qingjing Palace's unique talismans, it should be no less than yours and mine back then. Yet, to protect his sect, he chose to cut off his path to Yuan Ying, selflessly sacrificing himself to nourish the talisman puppet.  Admirable. Tieguan Daoist venturing alone into the dragon's den and tiger's lair… he must be going with a do-or-die resolve, isn't he? But I wonder how much confidence he has?"</p><p>Dongyang Bo shook his head. "From what I know, Tieguan Daoist is prepared to die. Before leaving, he already passed the Palace Master position to his junior brother, Gongliang Yu…"</p><p>Before he finished, a green light suddenly arrived.</p><p>The Liu family cultivator stood respectfully before the city gate, not daring to stop him, but instead respectfully said, "Greetings, Senior Tieguan."</p><p>The green light dissipated, revealing a thin figure with an unnaturally pale complexion.  Such paleness on a cultivator of such high level was quite unexpected.</p><p>Tieguanzi nodded to the Liu family cultivator, then walked toward the two Yuan Ying cultivators, bowing, "Tieguanzi greets both seniors."</p><p>Qin Sang quietly observed Tieguanzi, her heart filled with curiosity.</p><p>Tie Guanzi's demeanor and actions didn't seem to befitting someone facing two cultivators of the same realm.  He acted more like a senior instructing juniors. Could Tie Guanzi not truly be a Yuan Ying master?</p><p>The mystery was beyond his comprehension.</p><p>"Palace Master Tie, please don't stand on ceremony."</p><p>Chong Yi Daozhang and Dongyang Bo both returned the courtesy with clasped hands.</p><p>After Tie Guanzi arrived, several more people came, most holding the Ziwei tokens.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang saw Yun Youzi hurrying over.</p><p>Yun Youzi seemed quite famous within the Taiyi Danzong.  His arrival not only surprised the Liu family's Golden Core cultivators, but also startled Chong Yi Daozhang, who summoned him.</p><p>"You are my disciple? Why aren't you diligently cultivating in the sect, preparing for your Golden Core breakthrough, but instead putting yourself in danger?"</p><p>Yun Youzi bowed politely, neither humble nor arrogant, replying:  "Reporting to Master, this disciple wishes to seek a certain spirit herb in Ziwei Palace."</p><p>Chong Yi Daozhang frowned slightly, but didn't press further, saying calmly: "Stay with your Liu Shi Shu (Uncle Liu), don't stand with the unaffiliated cultivators."</p><p>...</p><p>After Yun Youzi's arrival, fewer people came.</p><p>Shortly after, Jing Po Po arrived.</p><p>This relieved Qin Sang, who had been anxiously waiting.</p><p>Jing Po Po still looked like an elderly woman, very unremarkable; no one present seemed to recognize her.  She showed her Ziwei token, glanced at Qin Sang, then found an empty corner, rested her hands on her cane and closed her eyes to rest.</p><p>Another hour passed.  As evening approached, well past the hour of You (酉时, roughly 5-7pm), two more Golden Core cultivators arrived late.</p><p>Dongyang Bo surveyed the group, saying gravely: "The hour has come! If any of you are still hesitant, this is your last chance. Once you leave Xuanlu Pass, there's no turning back!"</p><p>A stir went through the crowd, but no one spoke.</p><p>Dongyang Bo nodded to Chong Yi Daozhang.  Chong Yi Daozhang gently raised his hand, and a jade ruyi flew out of his sleeve. The ruyi spiraled into the air, growing larger and larger, until it was the size of a small vessel.</p><p>Chong Yi Daozhang's form shimmered and disappeared.</p><p>Then, Chong Yi Daozhang's voice echoed from above.</p><p>"Everyone, come aboard!"</p><p>Amazed by Chong Yi Daozhang's exquisite escape technique, they didn't hesitate, quickly flying into the air. The jade ruyi, large enough to hold everyone, still seemed rather spacious.</p><p>"Daoist Dongyang, I'll lead the way, you take the rearguard, how does that sound?" Chong Yi Daozhang asked.</p>
