<h1>Chapter 1309: Endgame</h1><p>Chapter 1309: Endgame</p><p>Ye Laomo fled to the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>Moreover, even after the recent events, Zu Yuan no longer felt confident in defeating Ye Laomo within the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>While it sounds incredible, this is the only explanation for Zu Yuan's willingness to so readily open the Sinful God Palace to them.</p><p>“What else do you know?”</p><p>Tongyou Mojun stared intently at Cang Hong Zhenren's eyes, coldly questioning, “What exactly is Ye Laomo trying to do?”</p><p>Even if Ye Laomo wreaked havoc in the Sinful God Palace, the Two Realms Alliance wouldn't care.  The problem is, the Sinful God Palace is connected to the Ziwei Palace, and Ye Laomo's goal is most likely the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>They would never allow anyone to destroy the Ziwei Palace!</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren remained calm, saying, “I've pretty much guessed how Ye Laomo opened the celestial gate. But, Tongyou Daoist, rest assured, the passage between the Sinful God Palace and the Ziwei Palace is unique.  As long as the Ziwei Palace remains closed, Ye Laomo cannot enter. For now, he's only hiding in the Sinful God Palace. Therefore, next time, we must join forces and trap and kill Ye Laomo within the Sinful God Palace!”</p><p>Elder Ji sneered, “In that case, wouldn’t we become your pawns against Ye Laomo?  Zhenren, your calculations are impressive!”</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren was frank, “Ye Laomo is the number one expert in the Beichen Realm, and he has painstakingly preserved his forbidden Nascent Soul. Whether it's used to cultivate demonic arts or refine evil artifacts, it's definitely extremely dangerous and must not be ignored. The most reliable approach is for all the top experts in the Beichen Realm to participate in the extermination. If we of Zu Yuan are defeated by Ye Laomo and killed, Daoist Ji wouldn't think that the Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing League could remain unscathed, would you?  The Sinful God Palace offers the best opportunity; letting the tiger return to the mountains would have unimaginable consequences. Without my guidance, even if you seize Yuanxu, you won't achieve anything in the Sinful God Palace. After the peace talks, I will disclose everything I know and we will formulate a plan together.”</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang snorted, “For a few mere withered Yuan pills, you initiated a war, murdering countless cultivators from the two realms over the years. To think you want to get away with it so easily is far too lenient!”</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren slowly shook his head, “Old Nose, don't think that the Two Realms Alliance's strength allows you to act as you please. If we continue fighting, we will have only death to face; even if you win, it will be a pyrrhic victory. The Ziwei Palace will open soon, and a fight to the death between us will leave you with no time to recover, leaving you with little strength to deal with Ye Laomo.  Dare you say you're not interested in Ye Laomo's secrets?  Eliminating Ye Laomo, the benefits will naturally be shared by everyone!”</p><p>He threatened them with a desperate battle and offered them incentives.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang sneered, unfazed, “Zhenren, your resolve is impressive, but I’d really like to see how many people will fight to the death with you.”</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren frowned slightly, sighing inwardly that the Two Realms Alliance was not so easily dealt with. He glanced at Qiu Zhi Xianzi.</p><p>The two whispered to each other. After a moment, Qiu Zhi Xianzi closed her beautiful eyes slightly, her lips moving as if she was using a secret technique to communicate with someone, seeking their opinion.</p><p>The only one in Zu Yuan capable of doing this was Tian Zheng Laoren, who was still recovering from serious injuries.</p><p>After a short while, Qiu Zhi Xianzi nodded to Cang Hong Zhenren, stepped forward, and said, “Zu Yuan will not contest the plains you have occupied; consider it compensation. From now on, we will establish a thousand-year pact with the boundary set at three hundred miles outside Yu City. The Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing League must not take any action detrimental to Zu Yuan, and Zu Yuan shall do likewise!”</p><p>Everyone's expressions shifted.</p><p>Zu Yuan finally offered something substantial.</p><p>The plains bordered Zu Yuan; they couldn’t continuously occupy them. Zu Yuan's willingness to relinquish them to prevent future conflict was a good condition.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be enough!</p><p>While Zhen Yi Daochang and the others were communicating through voice transmission, Qin Sang's gaze remained fixed on Qiu Zhi Xianzi.  Suddenly, he asked, “Xianzi, you're contacting Daoist Tian Zheng, aren't you? I wonder how his injuries are recovering?”</p><p>Qiu Zhi Xianzi felt that Qin Sang’s gaze was strange; she felt unhappy, her eyebrows slightly furrowed. “Thank you for your concern, Daoist Qin. Senior Tian Zheng is using secret techniques to heal his injuries and is not convenient to appear. He will recover in a short time.”</p><p>“Oh really?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, his words carrying a profound meaning, “For some reason, I have a feeling that I may never see Daoist Tian Zheng again.”</p><p>His words caused an uproar. Everyone on the cloud platform was stunned.</p><p>Qu Huan looked at Qin Sang in surprise, wondering why he said that.</p><p>When the Yu Cheng Uprising occurred,  Tian Zheng was recovering from injuries at Xing Heng Sect and wasn't present. Afterwards, Ye Lao Mo was relentlessly pursued by Cang Hong, never having a chance to participate.</p><p>Autumn芷's pupils constricted. Her tone icy, she coldly questioned, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p>Qin Sang calmly replied, "It's just a hunch.  In my experience, whether it's refining artifacts, setting up formations, or cultivating demonic arts, a core, or a similar central entity, is needed.  Most of the Nascent Souls controlled by Ye Lao Mo were newly formed and incapable of such a role.  Ye Lao Mo is calculating; before the Blood Pool battle, he had largely achieved his goals and was planning his endgame, wasn't he?  Self-destructing his blood demon avatar not only secured the Jade Bone, but also allowed him to kill two birds with one stone—obtaining a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>Of course, my deduction isn't based solely on this.</p><p>I'm the only one who's fought Ye Lao Mo's blood demon avatar twice.</p><p>The first encounter was in Yuanxu; pursued by the avatar, the pressure was immense.  Even with the Snake King, we were outmatched, escaping only by a hair's breadth.</p><p>The second time was at the Blood Lake.</p><p>Using the Eighteen Demon Banners and demonic fire, my power greatly increased.  Fighting the avatar alone, I sensed significantly less pressure.</p><p>Ye Lao Mo's subsequent decision to self-destruct his avatar was a surprise.</p><p>Others didn't notice, but I saw it wasn't truly spent. I was amazed by his ruthlessness – destroying such a powerful avatar without hesitation.</p><p>At the time, I didn't suspect the Abyss was part of Ye Lao Mo's plan. I assumed he highly valued the Jade Bone and self-destructed for safety, and didn't think further.</p><p>Looking back, the mystery is clear.</p><p>Self-destructing the avatar not only guaranteed possession of the Jade Bone, but it also severed Tian Zheng's escape route, using the enemy to severely injure him, eliminating a future obstacle.</p><p>With Tian Zheng gravely wounded, his Nascent Soul would be extremely tempting. Ye Lao Mo wouldn't pass that up.</p><p>I was initially unsure, thinking Tian Zheng wouldn't be completely unprepared. As long as he remained in Xing Heng Sect, Ye Lao Mo would find it difficult and risky to attack.</p><p>But Cang Hong and Autumn芷's pretense deepened my suspicion, giving me about 70% certainty!</p>
