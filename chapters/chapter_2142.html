<h1>Chapter 2132:  Inscriptions on the Immortal Mountain</h1><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The sacred mountain trembled, fissures erupted with azure light, birthing a wisp of azure spirit energy.  Min Zhuo's gaze followed the azure spirit energy as it drifted from the depths of the fissure. He then looked into the fissure itself, where the azure light was pure, the mountain body resembling a piece of jade.</p><p>He attempted to approach the fissure, the source of the azure spirit energy.  Logically, there should be treasures of even higher order than this energy.</p><p>His knowledge of the Daiyu Immortal Mountain was limited.  Ancient texts described it as one of the legendary ancient immortal mountains, but offered no detailed account of its wonders.</p><p>He concluded this mountain was extraordinary for two reasons: the presence of the azure spirit energy, and the existence of another immortal mountain, Yuanqiao, which was equally renowned in ancient legends.</p><p>The Yuanqiao Fair was the largest gathering of the Yi people, with all tribes attending. It marked the opening of the Yi people’s sacred land.</p><p>The shared name 'Yuanqiao' was no coincidence.  Legend held that the sacred land and Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain were inextricably linked.  Naming the great fair after 'Yuanqiao' highlighted the mountain's exceptional significance to the sacred land and the entire Yi people.</p><p>If the legends were true, seizing Daiyu Immortal Mountain would be immensely beneficial to the Changyou tribe and Min Zhuo himself.  At the very least, obtaining purer azure spirit energy would significantly enhance his and his people's cultivation.</p><p>However, the mountain before him differed greatly from his expectations.  He had envisioned an ancient immortal mountain as a sacred place – a wonderland brimming with celestial trees, rare flowers, countless treasures, and a breathtaking spectacle, surpassing any blessed land or cave heaven.</p><p>Instead, Daiyu Immortal Mountain was a barren, rocky mountain, devoid of even a single plant. While its peak was imposing, it only reached a thousand meters in height; to a cultivator of the Refining Void stage, it was merely a small hill, hardly resembling the legendary immortal mountain.</p><p>Upon first sight, Min Zhuo suspected that others had mistakenly identified this as the true Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Yet, the mysterious azure spirit energy and the unusual fluctuations emanating from the fissure confirmed this was no ordinary peak.  And there was further crucial evidence.</p><p>Min Zhuo turned to the side of the mountain and discovered a stone platform beneath a cliff face, upon which stood an unassuming stone tablet.  It bore the ancient characters 'Daiyu Immortal Mountain,' radiating a divine light, strong and extraordinary!</p><p>Simultaneously, Min Zhuo noticed numerous scattered traces, proving he was not the first to arrive.  The cliff face was covered with restrictions, and these traces were scattered amongst them.  Some were indecipherable markings; others were inscriptions left by different individuals.</p><p>In the distance, a Qingluan divine form appeared silently.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly noticed the stone tablet and the marks on the cliff face.</p><p>"It is indeed Daiyu Immortal Mountain!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Mo Xingdao's words.  This mountain differed slightly from his description, likely due to the upheaval caused by the world's ascension.</p><p>However, it was confirmed to be the Daiyu Immortal Mountain Mo Xingdao had seen in the depths of the Gui Xu.</p><p>In those days, they had rested on the stone platform by the tablet before repeatedly attempting to pass through the boundary gate.  Mo Xingdao had stated that in the depths of the Gui Xu, this platform was the only safe place. The entire mountain was fraught with peril, preventing them from venturing further.</p><p>Now, the boundary gate was gone, the most dangerous ancient restrictions had dissipated, and the mountain's surroundings were tranquil—only the mountain itself was turbulent.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had never mentioned the fissure or the azure spirit energy.  The fissure likely formed during the world's ascension, revealing the azure spirit energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the cliff face, where he saw the last writings of Mo Xingdao, the Qinghu Saint King, and Hui Guang Saint—their final words before their final departure from the stone platform, bearing the weight of certain death.</p><p>The marks on the cliff were chaotic, with many recent breaks caused during the ascension.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized some of the markings.  Some were about daoist inheritances, which would have been incredibly valuable in the lower realms, but Qin Sang's perspective had changed considerably. Unless they came from Ziwei Palace, most were damaged and worthless.</p><p>Others were insights into exploring the Gui Xu, for future reference. Yet, the Gui Xu was ever-changing, and Mo Xingdao’s group had faced countless hardships, making their journey far more difficult than their predecessors.</p><p>The rest included pre-ascension boasts and the final words of those who had failed in their endeavors.</p><p>"Eh? Bao Gu!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over and immediately noticed a familiar name.  Her note, sandwiched between two ancient barriers, had luckily survived.</p><p>Bao Gu mentioned that she had done everything she could to reach this place, specifically instructing her successors to try returning the same way if they had the strength, to escape this place, and leave guidance for future generations of Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>This was merely Bao Gu's hopeful vision. Once inside, leaving is nearly impossible.  Generations of Central Plains cultivators have racked their brains just to send out a few messages.  Even with ascension to the Storm Realm, no one has ever returned; otherwise, this place wouldn't be so mysterious.</p><p>It seems Bao Gu successfully ascended to the Greater World back then; I wonder where she is now.</p><p>Qin Sang continued searching, trying to find traces of Xiao Xiangzi, but to no avail.  Not everyone leaves their name here, and too many places have been destroyed. The lack of a trace doesn't mean Xiao Xiangzi wasn't here. Given his talent, it's almost certain he ascended.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the names on the stone wall are predominantly from Central Plains cultivators.  More recent ones are mostly from sects like the Eight Scenery Pavilion and Ganlu Zen Temple; further back, one sees names from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, showing just how powerful they once were.</p><p>While Qin Sang examined the wall inscriptions, Min Zhuo also scanned them briefly, but unfortunately found no records related to Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Shifting his gaze, Min Zhuo’s eyes fell upon a stone tablet.  Ancient and only knee-high, it was weathered and gray, as if covered in a layer of dust.</p><p>This unremarkable tablet had stood here for countless millennia, seemingly without anything unusual about it.</p><p>At least, that's how it appeared to the ascended cultivators of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The inscriptions recorded attempts to move the tablet.  Despite being seemingly ordinary, it remained unmoved.  No magical artifact or technique could leave a mark on it.</p><p>Some theories were inscribed on the wall – some said the material was extraordinary, others hinted at hidden mechanisms.  It's certain that every attempt to investigate the tablet and the immortal mountain ended in failure, forcing them to abandon their ambitions and honestly try the Dao Mark Gate.</p><p>However, one theory is interesting: someone suggested that the mountain's ability to stand in the depths of this place might indicate it's a magical artifact itself.  Considering the entire mountain, the tablet bearing the mountain's name is the most unique, possibly the key to controlling this artifact.</p><p>Years later, someone tried this, predictably failing, and adding a note to warn others not to waste their efforts, even if the guess was correct, no one from the lower realms could succeed.</p><p>Some remained skeptical, leading to a longer inscription below, but unfortunately, the bottom of the wall is eroded, and the content is lost, leaving us uncertain if anyone truly discovered anything.</p><p>Previously ascended individuals were at most of the Metamorphosis stage; the mysteries they couldn't solve are not entirely beyond Qin Sang and Min Zhuo’s understanding!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the tablet, his eyes gleaming.  He regretted not bringing his Sky-Eye Butterfly; it would have allowed for clearer observation.</p><p>He sensed an unusual aura on the immortal mountain, extremely subtle and difficult to detect. Qin Sang could only grasp a few threads. Coincidentally, these auras all converged on the tablet!</p><p>Undoubtedly, the tablet has a special function. Whether it's the key to controlling the immortal mountain remains to be seen.</p><p>He glanced at Min Zhuo, who came directly to Daiyu Immortal Mountain, suggesting he knew something. Could it be as the wall inscriptions speculated, that the mountain itself is a magical artifact?</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Min Zhuo was also hesitant, unsure whether to first enter the fissure and seek the source of the Azure Spirit Qi, or to try controlling the tablet and claiming Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>The retreat of the foul Qi is temporary.  They must leave before it returns.</p><p>He shifted his gaze from the tablet to the fissure.</p><p>Forcing his way into the fissure might only yield Azure Spirit Qi, a poor exchange.</p><p>But subduing the mountain isn't easy. He previously assumed it fell here accidentally, unseen. Now, it seems a force confines the mountain.  Even controlling it, he might not be able to take it away.  He still can't identify the source of that force, and doesn't know if his actions will trigger changes in the surrounding ancient barriers.</p><p>Time does not allow for thorough investigation.</p><p>Min Zhuo, contemplating the sacrifices he’d made and the purpose of his elaborate schemes, steeled his resolve.  He blurred into motion, heading towards the stone stele.</p><p>Witnessing Min Zhuo’s actions, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed with cold light.  She realized the stele was the key to claiming the immortal mountain.  She couldn't allow Min Zhuo to touch it; the consequences of him taking the mountain were unthinkable!</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer.  Her Qingluan avatar spread its wings, unleashing a thunderous roar, its azure light dazzling.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang appeared, Min Zhuo sensed an unusual fluctuation, his heart pounding in alarm.</p><p>Fortunately, he was preparing to claim the immortal mountain, and anticipating trouble, he’d secretly prepared a divine ability.  He instinctively activated it, the sound of rushing water filling the air.</p><p>A vast river materialized out of the darkness, its waters surging and twisting in nine bends, encircling Min Zhuo and transforming into a towering giant.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The giant roared, a sound like crashing waves, shaking the very soul.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A bolt of azure lightning tore through the void, arriving even faster.  The thunder echoed through the abyss as the Qingluan avatar closed in on Min Zhuo.</p><p>Seeing the giant, Qin Sang didn’t hesitate, charging forward with her Qingluan avatar.</p><p>In previous battles, Min Zhuo had used this divine ability more than once; it was undeniably impressive.  The bloodline abilities of the Yi Ren clan were all powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't initially taken Min Zhuo seriously, and hadn't targeted him specifically.  However, repeatedly using the same ability against a cultivator of Min Zhuo’s level would inevitably reveal weaknesses, unless the ability was flawlessly executed or perfectly concealed.  Moreover, Min Zhuo's breakthrough was recent, and his mastery of the ability wasn't complete.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s eyes, Min Zhuo’s ability was far from perfect.  She made her decision instantly. A bright light flashed from her Qingluan avatar's chest as a spirit tablet shot out, hurtling towards the water giant.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Min Zhuo recognized the Qingluan avatar, his disbelief palpable.  How could the Grand Protector, in the midst of battling the powerful Lu Wang army, possibly have sent an avatar to contend for the Daiyu Immortal Mountain?  How dare he?</p><p>Shock, fear, regret…</p><p>He didn’t have time to process these emotions. A fierce wind struck. Even with his quick reflexes, Min Zhuo was caught off guard. The water giant frantically raised its arms to block.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The spirit tablet, resembling a small mountain, struck the water giant's forearms with devastating force.  Ripples spread through the void as the water giant's arms turned translucent, seemingly unable to withstand the blow, reverting to their original form.</p><p>The water giant shuddered violently, falling into the abyss below.  Min Zhuo felt his internal energy abruptly stagnate. Though uninjured, he was far from comfortable.</p><p>This attack was only the beginning.  As the water giant fell, azure light erupted before it.</p><p>The Qingluan True Lightning Escape technique was considered top-tier even among cultivators at his level. Min Zhuo had no way to dodge, watching helplessly as the Qingluan avatar approached.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Qingluan avatar extended a sharp claw, aiming for the water giant's chest.</p><p>The claw itself was terrifying, but even more so was the azure lightning flashing across its surface –  Qin Sang's pre-imbued Qingluan True Lightning!</p><p>Min Zhuo had witnessed the power of the Qingluan True Lightning before the battle, and now his heart was filled with dread.</p><p>In this critical moment, the water giant could not evade.  It embraced itself, transforming into a giant water sphere, enclosing Min Zhuo at its center.</p><p>The water sphere was dense, its inner waters shimmering silver, like liquid mercury.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A massive claw struck the water sphere’s surface, sending water flying and causing a deep dent.  The claw, with its relentless force, pierced the sphere’s interior.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the water sphere possessed another extraordinary quality. Its interior seemed to continuously expand.  The Qingluan avatar charged swiftly, but Min Zhuo retreated within the sphere just as quickly. The distance between the claw and Min Zhuo was closing, but at a much slower pace.</p><p>*Rumble… rumble… rumble…*</p><p>The water sphere violently fluctuated; clearly, the technique had its limits, but it was temporarily easing Min Zhuo’s predicament, giving him a chance to employ other means.</p><p>However, Min Zhuo underestimated the attack's power.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Azure lightning burst forth, instantly filling the water sphere with crackling energy.</p><p>Min Zhuo’s expression froze. If his protective treasure hadn't been destroyed, he might have bought himself more time, but there were no ifs.</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred Lake.</p><p>Chang You Clan Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Min Shu sat before a wax figure, intently manipulating an array.</p><p>A faint flame burned on the figure, its intensity steady. The figure had shrunk considerably, but seemed to be holding on.</p><p>Suddenly, Min Shu froze, then his face paled in alarm.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The flame on the wax figure exploded, the melting process accelerating dramatically. The white wax flowed like water, spreading rapidly across the ground.</p>
