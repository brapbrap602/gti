<h1>Chapter 1717: Friend, Please Stay</h1><p>The sea stretched endlessly.  </p><p>Two armies of yokai clashed, a sea of darkness above and below.  The vast ocean had become a battlefield, filled with deafening shouts and roars—unlike the human wars Qin Sang had experienced, these were strange, chaotic cries.</p><p>Crimson seawater spread from the battlefield, staining the surrounding area a bloody red.</p><p>Most striking was a gigantic whale at the heart of the conflict.</p><p>Longjing the Great Saint had transformed into his true form.  Regardless of his cultivation, the sheer size of his dragon whale body alone was overwhelming, surpassing any other yokai beast.  The other dragon whales, towing a sacred bone, trailed behind him, dwarfed to the size of mere pups.</p><p>Truly the foremost yokai saint of the East Sea!  Even confined within an iron cage and without using the sacred bone, Longjing the Great Saint's raw power allowed him to charge through the battlefield, unstoppable and ferocious.</p><p>The Saint King Palace forces had yet to reveal a Great Saint of their own.</p><p>Lesser yokai beasts couldn't even approach Longjing's true form; a single wave from his body swept away swathes of them.  Those waves carried strange energy, a manifestation of the Great Saint's power. Weaker creatures struck by them cried out in agony, their bodies breaking.</p><p>Yet, despite Longjing's relentless assault, the Saint King Palace forces maintained their formation.</p><p>Qin Sang remained outside the battle, his consciousness spread wide, observing the shifts in energy. His gaze passed over the awe-inspiring Longjing, settling on the Saint King Palace army.</p><p>He couldn't clearly see the Saint King Palace troops with his eyes alone; it wasn't that their numbers were infinite, but a yellow light obscured them.</p><p>This yellowish light enveloped the Saint King Palace army, thinning towards the edges, appearing like a faint yellow mist where they clashed with the rebels.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, gazing at the densest part of the light, vaguely seeing the shadow of a grand palace.</p><p>"Saint King Palace…"</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated the words.</p><p>As he expected, that palace shadow was the Saint King Palace that dominated the East Sea yokai, though not the actual palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had given the Li Gou Pearl, obtained from a deceased Witch clan cultivator, to the Tianmu butterfly to refine.  Using the spirit control techniques from the *Panhu Sutra*, he had achieved human-insect unity. Although the butterfly's cultivation hadn't reached the fifth transformation, it could still utilize power close to that level.</p><p>The Tianmu's divine power could see through illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell this was not a real palace but an illusion created by a spirit array.  The Saint King Palace army was relying on this array to withstand Longjing's assault.</p><p>The yellowish light pulsed like the tide, the Saint King Palace forces' momentum rising and falling with it.  Each surge caused a ring of yellow light to burst from the soldiers, acting like armor, cleverly deflecting attacks with precision.</p><p>"This array…"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, deep in thought.</p><p>The Saint King Palace shadow's appearance indicated its proximity. He suspected this yellow light emanated from the palace's protective array!</p><p>But after observing for a while, something felt amiss.</p><p>Longjing had told him about the Saint King Palace's protective array, a gift to the Qinghu Saint King of unknown origin, containing ancient celestial flags of immense power.</p><p>Originally, Qinghu planned to use these flags to hunt down ferocious beasts.</p><p>However, after obtaining the Five Element Crown, she had more suitable methods, such as the Greater Five Element Banishing Light and the Buddhist Demon-Subduing Array, rendering the flags unnecessary.  Otherwise, Qin Sang would have seen the array's power firsthand.</p><p>The current array was undeniably strong, but Qin Sang felt it fell short of its reputation.</p><p>"Could it be the array's power is lacking because Qinghu isn't personally controlling it… or am I mistaken?"</p><p>Unless the Saint King Palace was employing a deceptive strategy, luring them into a trap, there had to be more to this. The evidence suggested otherwise.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sea chart Longjing had given him.</p><p>It showed that passing through this battlefield would lead to the heart of the Saint King Palace's territory. The ability to encircle the Saint King Palace troops was due to both careful planning and the enemy's limited options for retreat.</p><p>A place considered sacred by the Yao race is rare even in the vast East Sea.  This sea area attracted the attention of the Qinghu Saint King because of the presence of three sacred sites nearby, including the most important one, the East Sea Eye, which holds immense significance for the Yao race.</p><p>Since the Qinghu Saint King occupied it, many have forgotten what the East Sea Eye even looks like.</p><p>As various armies prepared to attack the Saint King's Palace, if they had the capability, they would have prioritized projecting their strongest defensive array to bolster their morale.</p><p>Yet, the Qinghu Saint King's Palace defensive array remained unused. The Qinghu Saint King remained absent.</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden from view, repeatedly surveyed the battlefield. A growing suspicion solidified within him: the Qinghu Saint King had not only left the East Sea but had also taken the palace's defensive array with them!</p><p>Abandoning their base and fleeing with their treasures – such decisive action. Where could they have gone?</p><p>A pungent smell of blood filled the air. The battlefield grew increasingly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the scene, noting two armies breaking through the lines. Seeing the Dragon Whale Saint fighting valiantly without the Qinghu Saint King intervening, the hesitant allied forces finally launched their attack. Of course, having delayed this long, they had no reason to continue delaying further.</p><p>With fresh troops joining the fray, the Dragon Whale Saint, bolstered by reinforcements, launched a powerful counteroffensive. The Dragon Whale's roar echoed like thunder, shaking the heavens.</p><p>Even Qin Sang couldn't help but exclaim, "What a magnificent and powerful demon beast!"</p><p>The allied forces converged, encircling the Saint King's Palace from several sides. The pressure on the palace's troops more than doubled. Even with the protection of the array, they couldn't withstand the elite forces of the various races and began to retreat.  However, the closer they were to the Saint King's Palace, the stronger the protective array became, meaning a decisive victory for the alliance wouldn't come easily.</p><p>Qin Sang remained still, his gaze fixed on the Saint King's Palace, his eyes flickering, trying to discern something.</p><p>However, the Dragon Whale Saint was growing impatient.  Given the current situation, even if the alliance won, the Dragon Whale clan, which was leading the charge, would suffer heavy losses.  A prolonged conflict risked the sacred site being looted and would take a long time to recover.  The absence of the Qinghu Saint King made him reluctant to reveal his trump card.</p><p>Before the battle, Qin Sang had promised to help them break the array, but he had yet to act.</p><p>Amidst the fighting, the Dragon Whale Saint repeatedly communicated with Qin Sang through voice transmission, finally asking, "True Cultivator, have you found a weakness in their formation?"</p><p>"Contact the other commanders and follow my orders!" Qin Sang commanded in a low voice.</p><p>While searching for the Qinghu Saint King, he simultaneously analyzed the array.</p><p>The effectiveness of a spiritual array differs significantly depending on the cultivator's level.  A Nascent Soul cultivator can perceive the flow of the heavens and earth's energy, and aided by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly divine ability, the array's weaknesses were clear to Qin Sang.</p><p>Against such a powerful array, Qin Sang didn't need to delve into its elemental source, whether it was based on the five elements, yin and yang, or something else. He didn't need complex calculations. Sensing the flow of energy and targeting any stagnation or blockage was the optimal strategy for breaking the array.</p><p>Qin Sang issued his orders without hesitation. The Dragon Whale Saint, far from being angry, was delighted and immediately sent messages to the various army commanders, using himself as a relay to coordinate the entire army.</p><p>"The Zhen position!"</p><p>The next moment, the order rang out. The Dragon Whale Saint struck the sea, the command simultaneously transmitted.  He himself, riding a colossal wave, soared into the air.  In the astonished gazes of countless demon beasts, the giant whale swung its tail, its gaping maw spewing a torrent of water.</p><p>It wasn't just a jet of water; it was a massive column, thicker than any water spout.  This colossal jet of water, fast as lightning, tore through a large portion of the battlefield, striking the position Qin Sang had indicated.</p><p>Simultaneously, the various armies followed orders, their top experts striking in coordinated attacks. The commander at that position didn't hesitate, uniting his troops for a combined magical assault.</p><p>For a moment, the Zhen position roared like thunder. Dragon Whale water jets, monstrous demon transformations, and the ferocious might of demon soldiers – powerful attacks converged upon the target.</p><p>More spells erupted from within the army formations, a storm of attacks unleashed.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Though their attack wasn't directed at the heart of the golden light, the Saint King's Palace's spectral image suddenly shook.  The halos surrounding the soldiers at the Zhen position also trembled.</p><p>Cries of alarm echoed, followed by screams.  Nearly half of the demon soldiers had their protective halos shattered, exposing them to the terrifying onslaught; a large number of casualties occurred immediately.</p><p>This single blow revealed the formation's weakness to the Saint King's Palace's forces.  The demon kings hidden within the array felt a sense of foreboding and immediately contacted the central command, inquiring about what had happened.</p><p>Within the Saint King's Palace, Bai Xiao the Great Sage and other demons guarding the main formation wore grave expressions, some bewildered.</p><p>Though not the original Palace-guarding Immortal Array, their meticulously crafted protective formation was immensely powerful.  Even against the combined forces of the various races, holding out for a time was certainly feasible.  Their plan was to wait for the sacred objects to mature, then plunder the sacred grounds and retreat leisurely.</p><p>They never expected their strategy to be so easily exposed in the initial battle.  Even with remote reinforcement, the imperfect functioning of the array had shaken their confidence.</p><p>Had some race produced a new master of formations?</p><p>"It must be a coincidence…"</p><p>Bai Xiao the Great Sage had barely thought this when he sensed another tremor in the palace, this time affecting the Dry position's demonic soldiers.</p><p>No coincidence!</p><p>On the battlefield, the allied forces, following Qin Sang's orders, repeatedly achieved victory.  Long Jing the Great Sage was elated, letting out repeated roars that sounded like death knells to the demonic army in the Saint King's Palace.</p><p>Orders continued to stream in. Qin Sang's tone remained calm, his commands brief, never exceeding five words.  Yet throughout, he remained on the battlefield's periphery, never once engaging directly.</p><p>Long Jing the Great Sage assumed Qin Sang was fully focused on breaking the formation, hence his inaction, and found the guidance sufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang, without personally fighting, controlled the battle's flow. His gaze fixed on the Saint King's Palace's ethereal image, he issued further instructions.</p><p>"Dry…"</p><p>He'd only uttered one word when Qin Sang was surprised to see Long Jing the Great Sage retreat from the vanguard back into the whale group.</p><p>Ninety-nine dragon whales, seemingly on command, surfaced, their blood energy surging, roaring in unison, shaking the heavens.  Thick blood energy flowed along chains towards an iron cage.</p><p>The cage turned crimson.  Countless strange runes erupted from the iron bars, echoing the blood sea below.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>One side of the cage suddenly opened – the side facing the sacred bone.</p><p>The next moment, a whale's song echoed from within.</p><p>The voice was low, lacking the power of Long Jing the Great Sage's roar, yet every demonic soldier on the battlefield heard it clearly, experiencing inexplicable fear and confusion.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, his eyes drawn to the sacred bone's eye sockets. He then saw the skull open its mouth as if alive.</p><p>'Creak… creak…'</p><p>Within the sacred bone's mouth, a mass of water had accumulated at some point.</p><p>Though limited by the skull's size, this water was small but possessed the depth of a vast ocean.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A jet of water shot out, powerful as a raging river, its form constantly shifting, finally transforming in mid-air into a colossal whale!</p><p>This whale, entirely composed of water, was incredibly lifelike, externally resembling a whale, but far more slender and several times larger than Long Jing the Great Sage.  Its ferocious, toothy maw was terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he watched the whale violently lash its tail, drawing a full-moon arc in the void, causing mighty waves to materialize seemingly from within the whale itself.</p><p>Before countless horrified eyes, the tail, carrying a massive wave, struck with devastating force.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A towering wave erupted, carrying countless bodies and blood.  Visible to the naked eye, the sea surface sank dramatically around the impact point, demonic soldiers crushed to pulp, the wave engulfing everything.  The Saint King's Palace formation was thrown into chaos.</p><p>The sacred bone's power was utterly formidable!</p><p>"This sacred bone… was obtained by our ancestor who, alone at the edge of the East Sea's Abyss for three hundred years, hunted a rogue whale that strayed to the edge of the Abyss, dragging it back to the Central Plains and nurturing it with our clan's blood to refine this sacred bone…"</p><p>Qin Sang heard the transmitted message as he saw Long Jing the Great Sage return to the cage and forcefully close the door.</p><p>The sacred bone within the cage shook, as if about to revive.</p><p>The ninety-nine dragon whales in the sea were weak, sinking beneath the surface to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. Was Long Jing the Great Sage displaying the Dragon Whale clan's strength?</p><p>Undeniably, this sacred bone was fearsome. This was only a fraction of its power, activated by consumed blood energy. If, as Long Jing the Great Sage claimed, a Dragon Whale's reverse blood explosion could awaken the rogue whale, then it was indeed a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>With the sacred object's devastating attack, combined with Qin Sang's guidance, the Saint King's Palace's defeat was certain.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang vanished.</p><p>The slaughter continued. The Saint King's Palace retreated again and again, a stark contrast to its earlier confidence. Bai Xiao the Great Sage and the other demons were shocked and enraged, but even with the Saint King's Palace formation, they couldn't mount an effective counterattack.</p><p>Long Jing the Great Sage, now in human form, led the pursuit. The previous display of power had earned him the respect of all the races.</p><p>Several figures, including a man wearing an imperial crown – the various army commanders – had somehow joined him.</p><p>The allied forces pressed their advantage, pursuing relentlessly with unstoppable momentum.</p><p>The man with the imperial crown gently fanned himself, observing the battlefield with a frown.  "The enemy's spirit is broken; we should press the attack and annihilate them. Why has the Great Sage ordered a slowdown?  Isn't he afraid of missing a crucial opportunity?"</p><p>Long Jing the Great Sage, claiming caution, sighed inwardly.  That order wasn't his; it came from the Daoist.</p><p>He understood he was merely a pawn in the Daoist's hand – but he didn't mind.  The Daoist was orchestrating the demonic civil war, targeting the Qinghu Saint King.  Slowing the advance was to allow the remnants of the Saint King's Palace to seek aid, giving Qinghu Saint King time to arrive.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the battlefield.</p><p>A man in armor sped discreetly, his figure flickering, his speed astonishing.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind.</p><p>"Friend, please wait."</p>
