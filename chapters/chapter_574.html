Chapter 567: A Sudden Turn of Events

Huang Tian succeeded, and the Wuji Sect Master was slain.
With the eruption of the Blood Defilement Divine Light, the Heavenly March Alliance suffered heavy losses, and even True One’s whisk treasure was affected.
It sounds complicated, but all these changes occurred in the blink of an eye.

Almost simultaneously, the devils of the Abyss of Sin arrived, now within striking distance. Amidst the billowing demonic energy, ghostly figures emerged, ready to attack.
Both sides were extremely decisive.
Even though the unexpected death of the Wuji Sect Master disrupted their plan to disable the Cold Territory cultivators’ treasures, it didn't shake the Abyss of Sin's resolve to attack.

Elder Devil Ye bellowed, "Kill the Heavenly March Alliance!"
Without hesitation, the Abyss of Sin cultivators abandoned their assault on the Cold Territory and lunged towards the Heavenly March Alliance.
Clearly, they knew that the Cold Territory cultivators, with their full strength intact, were not easy targets.
If they got bogged down in a chaotic battle with the Cold Territory, they would struggle to achieve a decisive victory.
Their time was limited, and they couldn't eliminate both territories at once.
The Heavenly March Alliance, with their most powerful treasures crippled, their strength drastically reduced, and their formation thrown into disarray by Huang Tian, presented the perfect opportunity.

The Abyss of Sin considered both the Cold Territory and the Heavenly March Alliance as major threats. Crippling the Heavenly March Alliance now meant that even if the two territories joined forces in the future, they wouldn't pose a significant threat. This would make their elaborate scheme and treacherous plot worthwhile.
Following Elder Devil Ye’s command, illusory images of magical treasures began to float above the Abyss of Sin cultivators.
These treasures were mostly demonic artifacts, banners and talismans, shrouded in rolling demonic energy and teeming with countless souls and ghostly shadows. The immortal formation suddenly resembled a ghostly underworld.

The Abyss of Sin had planned this for a long time. These treasures, charged and ready, unleashed their fiercest attacks upon the Heavenly March Alliance the moment they appeared.
The onslaught of countless magical treasures was overwhelming, eventually converging with the demonic energy into a tidal wave of darkness and evil.
Meanwhile, a six-armed demonic figure rose behind the Abyss of Sin cultivators. The figure was colossal, a hundred feet tall, towering over the battlefield.
Its eyes, like bronze bells, were mesmerizing and terrifyingly fierce.

When the demonic figure fully rose, it towered over the Minor North Star Formation. Waving its six arms, it roared towards the sky, its demonic voice echoing and causing dizziness and churning blood.
Even True One and Red Hair had never seen this demonic figure before, and they didn't know what it was.
However, they suspected that the Abyss of Sin relied on this figure to withstand the formation's Void Winds, and it might even have been responsible for breaching the formation's passage.

"What ancient demon has the Abyss of Sin summoned?" everyone wondered in terror.
Just then, the demonic figure, with a fierce glare, slammed its six arms onto the star chart above.
'Boom!'
The North Star shone brightly, vying with the demonic figure's aura.

The Minor North Star Formation, originally maintained by four individuals, was now down to three after Huang Tian's escape, and signs of instability were already showing.
Although it withstood the demonic figure's attack, it inevitably faltered.
The Abyss of Sin cultivators seized the opportunity and pressed their attack.
True One's expression changed drastically.
The Nascent Soul cultivators who entered the Violet Empyrean Palace represented almost all the elites of the Heavenly March Alliance. If they perished here, the alliance would be doomed.

Moreover, True One, positioned at the forefront, was the first in the line of fire!
"Elder Devil Ye, I swear I will avenge this!" True One screamed, his eyes bloodshot, as he raised his whisk.
His whisk, grazed by the edge of the Blood Defilement Divine Light, was only slightly damaged and could be easily repaired. However, he had no time for repairs now.
Facing the combined assault of the Abyss of Sin cultivators, True One, armed with his whisk, seemed incredibly vulnerable.

The whisk's bristles scattered, spreading like a giant web, flowing upwards to meet the enemy attack.
Each bristle shone with a unique light, sharp as a sword.
At the tips of the bristles, countless Five Element Divine Swords materialized, unleashing a torrent of sword energy. Like dancing dragons, they filled the air, forming a miniature world of flying swords, attempting to engulf the enemy's attack.
Simultaneously, the whisk's handle began to disintegrate until the entire treasure vanished.
True One had sacrificed his life-bound treasure to block the attack.

This whisk had been his life-bound treasure since he first formed his Gold Core. Now, a peak-stage Mid Nascent Soul cultivator, just a step away from the Late Nascent Soul stage, he had faced countless dangers over the centuries, and his life-bound treasure had been damaged many times, but never had he been forced to destroy it.
He never imagined he would face such a desperate situation at the peak of his power.
The destruction of his life-bound treasure, connected to his very essence, caused True One to cough up blood, his face ashen. His hatred for the Abyss of Sin deepened, etching itself into his very being.

"Haha…" Elder Devil Ye cackled. "Old fool, your time has come! But you thought a single treasure could stop me? You're dreaming!"
'Boom!'
Before he could finish, a deafening explosion rocked the battlefield.
The world of flying swords created by the exploding whisk only lasted for a moment before being destroyed.
The collision was incredibly violent, unleashing terrifying and chaotic energy. Countless broken swords flew in all directions, shattered beyond repair.

As powerful as True One was, he was still just one man.
The Abyss of Sin's attack, though weakened, retained its terrifying power.
True One's eyes widened in despair. He could only dodge; otherwise, he too would perish. And if he fled, those behind him would suffer the consequences.
How many of the Heavenly March Alliance would survive this?
What would become of the alliance?

Suddenly, a scorching aura brushed past him.
The aura originated from a giant crimson fist, incredibly solid, burning with fierce flames and radiating pure Yang energy.
The fist, surpassing True One, replaced the world of flying swords, forming a second barrier.
True One's heart leaped with joy as he turned his head.

He saw Red Hair, eyes wide and hair standing on end, in a punching stance, his hands blazing with fire. His entire body burned with an inextinguishable flame, not of actual fire, but a manifestation of pure Yang energy.
Red Hair looked like a fire god, his presence overwhelming.
The fist had come from him!
The fist was also shattered by the Abyss of Sin's attack, but it further weakened the assault, potentially saving more lives.

Simultaneously, Red Hair roared, "Save them!"
The battle shifted in an instant, with all three commanders making the most critical decisions.
Red Hair, without hesitation, chose to save his people!
