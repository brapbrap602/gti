<h1>Chapter 1218: Progress</h1><p>The journey was uneventful.  </p><p>As they approached Hukou Pass, Qin Sang and the Serpent King were on high alert, wary of any ambush the Sin Abyss might have set up. Fortunately, there were no signs of trouble, and they safely returned to the Skywalk Plateau. The Serpent King stayed behind at Hukou Pass to discuss with the Feather King the matters concerning the Elder Demon Ye and the Blood Lake. The Elder Demon Ye was ambitious and his strength unfathomable, so the demon race needed to prepare in advance. Once Qin Sang contacted the alliance of the two regions and provided his testimony, he would return to the mountains to recuperate.  </p><p>Qin Sang returned alone to Stone Bend Mountain, openly visiting his senior sister. After his previous visit, they had exchanged several letters, and their relationship had grown familiar enough that he no longer needed to meet her in secret as before.  </p><p>"Junior Brother, have you just returned from the Sin Abyss? Did anything happen there?"  </p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun's cave abode was located within a former noble mansion in the city. She had been in deep meditation but was roused by Qin Sang's arrival. Qin Sang waited in the main hall, and when she entered, the room seemed to brighten. She wore a fiery red dress, a stark contrast to the cold, detached aura she had exuded when he first saw her true appearance. Yet, as he approached her, he could still sense a faint air of aloofness, a remnant of her past when she had turned herself into a puppet, sealing her emotions and suppressing her inner demons.  </p><p>Qin Sang wondered if her temperament and cultivation had been affected by her experience with the "Mark of the Undying Demon." Though he had now reached the Nascent Soul stage, Senior Sister Qingjun remained an enigma to him, her depths unfathomable.  </p><p>"Can't I visit Senior Sister without a reason?" Qin Sang stood up, smiling, before his tone turned serious. "I discovered some interesting things in the Sin Abyss and wanted to seek your opinion."  </p><p>"Oh? Did you find any traces linking the Sin Abyss to the Ancient Demons?" Qingjun waved her hand, setting up a soundproof barrier.  </p><p>"Not exactly," Qin Sang shook his head.  </p><p>This time, he had explored nearly all of the Sin Abyss's most important forbidden zones, the Abyssal Ruins, but found no signs of the Ancient Demons.  </p><p>The two sat facing each other. Qin Sang continued, "I accidentally found a passage in the Sky Scar and entered the Abyssal Ruins."  </p><p>Qingjun's eyes flickered with surprise. "Back then, I hesitated for a long time, fearing I might be discovered and trapped inside, so I didn't dare to venture in. I didn't expect you to have the courage to enter the Abyssal Ruins."  </p><p>"Most of the Sin Abyss's Nascent Soul cultivators are tied up at the frontlines. The danger in the Abyssal Ruins now is nothing compared to before. Besides, I had an escape route," Qin Sang shook his head. "I encountered the Elder Demon Ye in the Abyssal Ruins..."  </p><p>Qingjun's expression turned serious as she listened to Qin Sang recount his encounter.  </p><p>Qin Sang had only exchanged blows with the Elder Demon Ye during their chase, so he couldn't claim to understand him deeply. He could only share what he had observed, leaving it to his senior sister to determine whether it was the Elder Demon's true body or a clone. He also recounted the events surrounding the Blood Lake.  </p><p>After a moment of silent contemplation, Qingjun said, "I once assisted Daoist Zhenyi in a battle against the Elder Demon Ye. The artifact you mentioned is likely the Elder Demon's Blood Moon Wheel. However, his cultivation is incredibly diverse. Not only is he a master of blood arts, but he is also well-versed in the Five Elements and other demonic techniques. He is a formidable opponent. During your absence, both sides have remained relatively peaceful, with only minor skirmishes. Although the Elder Demon Ye hasn't made any moves, it's hard to say whether that was his true body or a clone."  </p><p>"The Elder Demon Ye felt more dangerous to me than even the peak mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators of the Canglang Sea. Using only his blood arts, he nearly forced me to reveal all my techniques," Qin Sang sighed. "If the Elder Demon Ye has a clone of that level, even without the Ancient Demons, we need to seriously consider our options."  </p><p>Qingjun, however, showed no trace of worry. She raised her eyes and smiled faintly. "It's not uncommon for techniques like corpse refinement, clones, second souls, or puppets to surpass the cultivator's own strength. Either they require immense effort to refine, or they depend on great fortune. The Elder Demon Ye has been stuck at the peak of mid-stage Nascent Soul for many years, unable to break through. It's only natural that he would divert his attention to refining a clone. However, Daoist Zhenyi and the Nether Demon Lord are no ordinary figures either. We'll just have to wait and see..."  </p><p>Qin Sang thought about it and realized she was right. Back when he was at the mid-stage Golden Core, he had a peak Golden Core clone, though that was due to a unique bottleneck in his cultivation. The Elder Demon Ye had dominated the Sin Abyss for years, and his strength was unfathomable. It wasn't surprising that he possessed such a clone.  </p><p>He had brought this up mainly to warn his senior sister, but seeing her unfazed, he decided not to press the matter. If the Elder Demon Ye proved invincible, he wouldn't stubbornly fight to the death. He could always take the little demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea and a few juniors and sail away to live freely.  </p><p>After discussing the Elder Demon Ye, Qingjun asked, "The matter of the Blood Lake requires careful consideration. Although I've never entered it, I've heard some legends about it. It's an unusual place. We'll likely need to convene a meeting of the two regions' cultivators to discuss this. You'll probably need to present your findings in person. Will this involve revealing any of your secrets?"  </p><p>"The Serpent King is at Hukou Pass, and he'll be there too," Qin Sang replied. He had already discussed this with the Serpent King. Not wanting to draw too much attention, he had shifted most of the credit to the Serpent King, who had jokingly called him a sly fox.  </p><p>The two continued to exchange thoughts for a while, and Qin Sang took the opportunity to seek Qingjun's advice on some cultivation difficulties. She answered with ease, offering him valuable guidance, which gave Qin Sang a new appreciation for her strength.  </p><p>Unnoticed, over two hours had passed.  </p><p>Qin Sang stood up to take his leave, planning to visit Mei Gu and inquire about any new developments. Qingjun, whose current appearance made it inconvenient for her to go out, only escorted him to the entrance of the hall. "I almost forgot! I've been studying the Demon-Binding Rope recently and have made some progress. I wonder if all this effort will ever be put to use."  </p><p>"Better to be prepared," Qin Sang thought to himself, hoping it wouldn't be necessary. The Ancient Demons were too terrifying, and he had no desire to encounter another.  </p><p>Leaving the mansion, Qin Sang arrived at the courtyard from his last visit. Before long, Mei Gu received his signal and hurried over.  </p><p>Qin Sang examined his disciple and nodded approvingly. "Not bad. Your cultivation has improved."  </p><p>"Thank you, Master, for the spirit pills," Mei Gu replied, her excitement evident. "Also, following your guidance, I've gained new insights through combat, which has led to significant progress."  </p><p>These were lessons Qin Sang had learned from his own cultivation of the Path of Slaughter, and they were more than sufficient to guide Mei Gu. He considered rotating disciples like Li Yufu to the frontlines for experience, knowing he could ensure their safety.  </p><p>"You seem quite pleased. Have you made any progress?" Qin Sang set aside his thoughts and smiled at his disciple.  </p><p>Mei Gu grinned. "Nothing escapes your eyes, Master. I've been actively befriending that fellow cultivator, subtly probing for information. I've gathered scattered pieces of intelligence, and when pieced together, they confirm certain things."</p>
