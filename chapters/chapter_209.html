Chapter 202: The Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals

"Just for a cave dwelling?"
Master Yuyang asked with a strange expression, "Does Junior Brother Qin plan to stay in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for his cultivation?"
Qin Sang nodded.
"Junior Brother Qin, you should think about this carefully. The snow-capped mountains to the south of Xuanlu Pass stretch for miles, and that is where the sect has claimed several spiritual veins for the disciples to cultivate. Many opportunities do exist in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, but it is not a suitable place to stay long-term. Those secret realms and ancient ruins are extremely isolated, located far away from the towns and marketplaces. In the event that you require something urgent during cultivation, it would be inconvenient and exceedingly expensive to obtain it. And if there is an emergency, you would be left helpless. There are many drawbacks; why bother cultivating in such a place?"
Master Yuyang was advising Qin Sang for well-intentioned reasons, worried that Qin Sang had gone astray.
Of course, Qin Sang was aware of all these drawbacks, which was why he did not dare to squander the spiritual stones in his possession. He planned to stock up on necessary items such as healing elixirs and cloud artifacts before leaving.
"Thank you for your candor, Senior Brother. I understand what you are saying," Qin Sang said with a wry smile, "but I have no choice but to prioritize my cultivation requirements."
"I see."
Master Yuyang nodded; he did not find it strange.
Shaohua Mountain had a collection of nearly 100 cultivation methods, encompassing all types of extraordinary techniques. Many of these fragments of cultivation methods were discovered from the ruins in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield; even the sect's Golden Core Sages were unable to fully comprehend them.
The choice of cultivation method determined whether one could condense a Golden Core and how far one could advance on the path of cultivation. Choosing the wrong method would lead to irreparable consequences.
The sect had many cultivation methods that led straight to the Divine Transformation Stage, and their efficacy had been proven. The majority of people, seeking to play it safe, chose to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors. Only a few dared to venture down a different path and choose those cultivation fragments.
As a result, more than half of the cultivation methods in Shaohua Mountain's collection had never been practiced.
Master Yuyang frowned and fell into deep thought. Master Che had entrusted him with this matter. Furthermore, Qin Sang was a fellow disciple; it would not be right to send him away casually. But this was indeed a difficult arrangement.
The sect attached great importance to these secret realms; some of them were even crucial to the sect's survival and were considered as important as Shaohua Mountain itself. As the garrison commander of Xuanlu Pass, he had been stationed there for decades and only knew the location of one secret realm.
After a while, Master Yuyang's eyes lit up, and he said, "Junior Brother Qin, the opportunity to guard a secret realm is rare, but there is a workaround. You can use your meritorious deeds to rent a cave dwelling in the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals..."
Meritorious deeds referred to the contributions made by members of the Xuanlu Guard and the Shadow Guard during their missions. The contributions were quantified into numerical values based on their significance.
They could use meritorious deeds to exchange for cultivation resources, many of which were rare items from secret realms that were of great benefit to cultivation. These were intentionally provided by the major sects as incentives; they could not be purchased with spiritual stones outside.
This was also why so many people gave up their freedom to join the two guards and accept the constraints.
The Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals was located in the inner region, far from other marketplaces and towns. It was discovered by the major sects collectively, and its resources were also distributed among them, each sending someone to guard it.
Since the spiritual materials and spiritual medicines produced in the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals were not extremely precious, strict confidentiality was not necessary. Later, the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals was opened to the Xuanlu Guard and the Shadow Guard, allowing them to enter that area to carry out missions and use the secret realm as a base of operations. In case of danger, they could seek refuge or send out a distress signal from the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals.
There were unoccupied cave dwellings in the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals. If Qin Sang joined the two guards, he would be able to borrow a cave dwelling there.
The Xuanlu Guard was generally not allowed to leave Xuanlu Pass, so Qin Sang only had one option: to join the Shadow Guard.
"The garrison commander of the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals is Senior Brother Teng Nan from the Upper Yuan Pure Palace. I happen to be acquainted with him, and I can write him a letter of introduction. Junior Brother Qin, if you are willing to share some of your meritorious deeds with Senior Brother Teng Nan, he will be happy to receive a financial contribution in the form of meritorious deeds and gain an additional Foundation Establishment Stage combatant for the secret realm. The meritorious deeds earned by the Shadow Guard on each mission are quite substantial, which should be sufficient to support Junior Brother Qin's cultivation indefinitely," Master Yuyang said, feeling rather pleased with himself for solving such a difficult issue.
There was an explanation about meritorious deeds in the jade slip. Qin Sang had originally intended to pursue meritorious deeds; it was indeed an invaluable asset, but at the present time, his cultivation was his top priority.
According to Senior Brother Yuyang, the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals was relatively safe; it had not been subject to destruction during its exploration, so its restrictions were almost entirely intact.
The restrictions of the secret realms where the marketplaces were located, although still usable, were riddled with holes, far inferior to the Mysterious Realm of Heavenly Crystals, and the cave dwellings inside were also of a lower grade.

Qin Sang is now at the Foundation Building stage and his cultivation requires a lot of spiritual energy from the cave. Since now he knows about the Tianjing Secret Realm, there is no need to make extra efforts for this anymore.

His only concern is that the location of Tianjing Secret Realm is somewhat remote. It would be inconvenient for him to buy and sell things in the future, but Qin Sang had been preparing to go into closed-door training, so it would not have a major impact.

After asking more questions of Master Yuyangzi about the Tianjing Secret Realm, Qin Sang made a decision and clasped his hands together, saying, "Thank you for your guidance, master. I am willing to join the Shadow Guard."

Master Yuyangzi clapped his hands with delight. "I am glad to hear that you are determined, Junior Brother Qin. Come with me and let's go and meet Senior Brother Qi."

Qin Sang followed Master Yuyangzi behind him toward a passage behind the hall. The passage was very long. On the way there, Qin Sang also heard Master Yuyangzi introducing Senior Brother Qi's background.

Senior Brother Qi's real name is Qi Yuanzhou. His master was a Golden Core Venerable from Mount Shaohua who had already passed away. Like Qin Sang, he came to Xuanlu Pass as soon as he entered the Foundation Building stage. He made a great reputation for himself on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

Qin Sang was very surprised to learn that this person was actually a master at the False Core stage!

The so-called False Core stage is when a cultivator has finished training to the late stage of Foundation Building but their cultivation cannot progress any further. They begin to prepare for the Core Formation stage, but they cannot form a Golden Core for various reasons.

Masters at the False Core stage have greater strength than other cultivators at the late stage of Foundation Building. If they progress further, they can ascend to the Core Formation stage and become masters at the Core Formation stage.

Master Yuyangzi said that Qi Yuanzhou is the Foundation Building disciple of Mount Shaohua who is most likely to form a Core. He is now a chief elder of Xuanlu Pass and is responsible for the affairs of the Shadow Guard.

Although there are Golden Core Venerables at Xuanlu Pass, they do not care about worldly affairs. The elders' council jointly decides on all matters and its elders are basically all late-stage Foundation Building masters from major sects.

These include not only Mount Shaohua, Shangyuan Qingjing Palace and Taiyi Danzong, but also many well-established sects. Although they do not have Nascent Soul Patriarchs and are not within the Eight Sects of Orthodoxy, they are not to be underestimated when united. They have a degree of say.

The Shadow Guard is one of two guards at Xuanlu Pass. They would not allow Qi Yuanzhou to have all of the authority. There are several elders on an equal footing with Qi Yuanzhou.

Qi Yuanzhou is Qin Sang's fellow sect brother. Qin Sang had no choice but to join the Shadow Guard and could only take refuge with his fellow sect brother.

This is a good thing for Qin Sang. With Qi Yuanzhou looking out for him, he does not need to worry about being killed out of the blue by being sent on a highly dangerous mission.
