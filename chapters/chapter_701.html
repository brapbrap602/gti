<h1>Chapter 693: The Second Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 693: The Second Transformation</p><p>“Four Ming Island is just ahead.  If all goes well, bypassing Four Ming Island, we’ll reach Hun Tian Island in a couple of months!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s journey had taken longer than a direct boat trip would have, due to many detours. Along the way, he’d indeed encountered several skirmishes, always avoiding them to make better time.</p><p>He’d also faced attacks from powerful demons; he killed when he could, and otherwise escaped using the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot talisman.</p><p>He stopped here for two reasons: firstly, Qin Sang was exhausted and needed rest; secondly, after consuming countless spirit herbs, his Sky Eye Butterfly had reached the peak of its first transformation and was ready for another!</p><p>A flash of light emanated from his dantian, and the Sky Eye Butterfly flew out, circling Qin Sang before landing on his shoulder, a clear display of affection.</p><p>The blue light on its wings shone brighter, its patterns more exquisite.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, produced the Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid.</p><p>Catching the scent, the Sky Eye Butterfly soared towards the jade bottle, circling above it, eager to consume it.</p><p>Knowing it would help the butterfly transform, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, opening the bottle and pouring a drop of Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid into his palm.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly eagerly descended, lapping it up.</p><p>The liquid visibly diminished, swallowed entirely by the butterfly, which still seemed unsatisfied. Qin Sang poured another drop.</p><p>He recalled that Elder Di Que had once given a single drop to two Fire Jade Centipedes, triggering their transformations.  It seemed this butterfly was far greedier.</p><p>Or perhaps it was a matter of individual differences.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipedes had reached the peak of their first transformation much earlier, stuck at that stage for years, making their subsequent transformation easier than the butterfly's.</p><p>After consuming the second drop, the butterfly grew lethargic, slowly flapping its wings before settling on Qin Sang's palm, even snuggling against his finger and falling asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang held the butterfly for a while, observing for any signs of transformation. But he wasn't worried; while it slept, he entered meditation.</p><p>For several days, each time the Sky Eye Butterfly awoke, Qin Sang fed it Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid and several other spirit herbs he'd prepared to aid the transformation.</p><p>On the third evening, the eyes on the butterfly's wings suddenly "opened," emitting a celestial blue light, a hazy aura enveloping it.</p><p>Under the night sky, the sea shimmered, and the butterfly seemed like a blue star.</p><p>It slept within a cocoon of blue light, its wings folded, forming another cocoon.</p><p>Qin Sang grinned, silently pleased. The Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid truly was a divine medicine; the butterfly had begun its transformation! He shook the bottle; plenty remained, enough for a third transformation.</p><p>Having rested sufficiently, he stored the butterfly in his dantian to ensure its undisturbed transformation and continued his journey.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>A desolate sea area, despite clear skies and calm weather, was unexpectedly beset by towering waves, accompanied by the clash of metal and angry shouts.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed a dozen figures locked in battle, various magical weapons colliding amidst several strangely shaped insect-like creatures.</p><p>Human and Wu cultivators were engaged in a fierce struggle.</p><p>The battle raged.</p><p>A distant figure suddenly appeared, approaching swiftly.  They seemed to notice the battle and halted, observing from afar.</p><p>The combatants noticed the newcomer, becoming momentarily hesitant.</p><p>They were evenly matched, each with their own hidden agendas.  Though the humans were slightly behind, they had hidden strengths. The arrival of someone powerful could instantly shift the balance of the conflict.</p><p>Both sides cautiously regrouped, wary of the mysterious newcomer.</p><p>Suddenly, the newcomer's light blazed, charging into the fray with astonishing speed, alarming both sides.</p><p>"A Nascent Soul cultivator… Damn it, the humans have reinforcements!”</p><p>The Wu cultivator leader's face fell. "Retreat!"</p><p>The human cultivators, invigorated, launched a fierce counterattack, relentlessly pursuing the fleeing Wu cultivators, preventing their easy escape.</p><p>The mysterious cultivator quickly arrived, demoralizing the Wu cultivators who, after a chaotic clash, left several corpses behind and fled.</p><p>After a brief pursuit, seeing they couldn't eliminate any more, the pursuers gave up.</p><p>"Thank you for your valiant assistance, friend. I am Han Cuo. May I ask your name?"</p><p>The leader of the human cultivators, a middle-aged man with a square face and commanding presence, approached the younger man with a warm smile, bowing slightly. "Friend, for one so young to possess such cultivation, I am truly impressed!"</p><p>This young man was Qin Sang.</p><p>After a long journey, he finally reached the vicinity of Huntian Island, only to discover chaos. After some consideration, he decided to first contact the island's cultivators and gather information.</p><p>He had observed that the combatants were of relatively low cultivation, only a few early Golden Core stage cultivators, the rest being Foundation Establishment stage. He revealed himself, causing the Wu tribe members to flee.</p><p>"My surname is Qin.  Han Dao-you's praise is excessive.  My cultivation technique has a rejuvenating effect, hence my youthful appearance," Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>He had not worn a cloak or mask, revealing his true features.  In this situation, concealment would only invite suspicion. He had previously masked himself to avoid the Li Wu Palace; such precautions were unnecessary in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Han Cuo paused, but didn't press further, introducing Qin Sang to the others.</p><p>The others also thanked Qin Sang, and willingly shared some of their spoils with him, which he readily accepted.</p><p>After a period of acquaintance, Han Cuo examined Qin Sang.  "You seem unfamiliar.  Are you newly arrived at Huntian Island?"</p><p>"That's right," Qin Sang said with a wry smile, looking around. "I was hunting demons on another island when a sudden upheaval occurred, leading me to risk coming here.  Unexpectedly… it's equally unstable."</p><p>Han Cuo chuckled. "With the two tribes at war, where is there peace? If you seek tranquility, it's not difficult.  Go to Huntian Island itself. The island lord strictly forbids fighting within the island; the inside and outside are two different worlds."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the group. "If that's the case, why don't you all go onto the island?"</p><p>Han Cuo replied meaningfully, "Where there's risk, there's opportunity. Others fear it, but I relish it. As for them… the outside of Huntian Island is even more dangerous. Their cultivation is too low. They were too slow, and now dare not attempt to enter. They are forced to remain outside. However, with your strength, reaching Huntian Island safely would be no problem."</p>
