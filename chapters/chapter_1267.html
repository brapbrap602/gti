<h1>Chapter 1259: A Feigned Advance</h1><p>Tong You Mojun, Xiang Qing, Chong Yi Daochang, and Qing Jun each held a talisman.  Originally, a jade talisman was entrusted to Dongyang Bo.  Following Dongyang Bo's unexpected disappearance, Chong Yi Daochang took over.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood behind the four, guided them in activating the talismans, and jointly mobilized the  Nine Palaces Formation.  Celestial Palace phantoms emerged from the talismans, releasing swirling Yin and Yang energies, some large as fists, others small as chess pieces, resembling bright and dim stars.  Soon, a river of stars descended, forming Bagua (eight trigrams) and Nine Palaces in the void, creating a battlefield.</p><p>Li (fire) above, Kan (water) below, Zhen (thunder) on the left, Dui (lake) on the right, Gen (mountain), Xun (wind), Kun (earth), and Qian (heaven) at the corners.  In an instant, everyone vanished into the formation; only the formation diagram slowly rotated.  This was a Nine Palaces Formation, based on the Later Heaven Bagua, a true Xuanmen formation, with infinite variations.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>As the formation completed, streams of blood flowed in from outside, surging from the flag gate.  Even more astonishingly, after the bloody light enveloped the Nine Palaces Formation, the myriad lethal attacks encountered in the Black Tower Formation all reappeared within the flag gate formation.</p><p>This gave Qin Sang and the others an illusion: they were trapped within the Black Tower Formation, manipulated as if it were a living formation.  The power of the flag gate formation was certainly no match for the Black Tower Formation, but it still caused everyone to frown with a foreboding feeling.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Countless blood-thunders erupted from the flag gate, raining down and exploding. The Nine Palaces Formation shook violently, submerged and fiercely battered by the blood-thunders.  Maintaining the formation, the group hid within the nine palaces, impervious to external attacks. They attempted to break through the flag gate formation and enter the pool of blood.</p><p>They learned from Jing Yu that a pool of blood lay below, filled with black ropes, and that the ancient cultivator was sealed at its bottom, along with the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>Only Jiang Chenzi and others appeared in the flag gate formation; Ye Laomo was absent. It was conceivable that Ye Laomo was busy breaking the seal on the pool of blood and could not spare attention here, so he only sent Jiang Chenzi and others to set up a formation to obstruct them.</p><p>With their masters present, they jointly activated the Nine Palaces Formation, its power not inferior to the flag gate formation. Qin Sang, for the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and the ancient cultivator, also cooperated fully, secretly using Wu tribe secret arts to enhance his celestial eye abilities and search for weaknesses in the flag gate formation.</p><p>They expected that, while Ye Laomo was distracted, breaking through the flag gate formation's blockade would be easy, but the formation proved far stronger than anticipated.</p><p>Tong You Mojun and Qing Jun exchanged glances, then simultaneously roared, jointly casting spells to push the formation's power to its limit.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A brilliant light flared, with black and white pillars of light shooting into the sky, countering the blood-light and throwing the flag gate formation into chaos. The two formations collided violently.</p><p>However, they could not find any obvious weakness and remained firmly blocked.</p><p>Using the opportunity of the collision between the two formations, the Celestial Eye Butterfly searched everywhere, but the blood-light was too dense;  piercing the barriers, gradually discerning the details, the process was slow.</p><p>Then Qin Sang discovered something, exclaiming, "No good! The flag gate formation is somehow connected to the blood mist in the Black Tower Formation, borrowing its power!"</p><p>Everyone was shocked, understanding that Ye Laomo's knowledge of this place far exceeded their expectations. He had refined three magical flags as a bridge to harness the power of the Black Tower Formation!  That explained the flag gate formation's strength.</p><p>Even without Ye Laomo directing, they couldn't break the blockade in a short time; by the time they broke the formation, Ye Laomo would have already succeeded.</p><p>"Unless we forcefully activate the formation's core essence by consuming our lifeblood, but that would severely deplete our energy, and we would be too weak to contend with Ye Laomo even if we get in,"  Qing Jun said gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Although the Corpse Flower Blood Amber wasn't essential, a treasure that could directly enhance Yuan Ying cultivation was exceedingly rare and could not be missed.  After a moment's contemplation, he looked at Jing Yu: "The Black Tower is severely damaged; were the ancient prohibitions in the core area unaffected by the ancient upheaval, remaining intact?  Do you still remember the scene you saw then?"</p><p>Jing Yu immediately understood Qin Sang's intention. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber was crucial to her tribulation; she immediately focused her mind, carefully recalling her past experience.  After a while, she said repeatedly, "The ancient prohibitions here are far more complete than elsewhere, but they were also impacted and damaged. However, when I discovered the ancient cultivator's conspiracy, I was focused on escaping and didn't have time to examine it closely. I only remember a few places, and I'm not sure if those places allow passage."</p><p>A feigned advance, a secret detour.</p><p>Facing the seemingly impenetrable Flag Gate Formation, Qin Sang devised this plan.  Otherwise, this stalemate would only result in wasted effort.  Not only would they fail to capture the ancient cultivator, but the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper would also likely be taken by Ye Laomo.</p><p>The group exchanged glances, a flicker of interest in their eyes.  It was worth a try.</p><p>“Lingering here is pointless. Our only option is to attempt Lady Mingyue’s strategy.”</p><p>Qing Jun nodded, then added, remembering something, “It’s crucial that we avoid being detected by the Abyss of Sin. Otherwise, unforeseen complications will arise.  We must keep people maintaining the opposing Nine Palaces Formations; we cannot spare too many.”</p><p>Lord Tongyou agreed, “Precisely. This approach has two advantages. The clash of formations and the resulting shockwaves will disrupt the ancient prohibitions, providing cover for infiltration.  Furthermore, surprising Ye Laomo will increase our chances of success. The Reverse Nine Palaces Formation is primarily for trapping and killing.  The main formation operator must be ready to adapt the formation, firmly holding the Flag Gate Formation in place to prevent reinforcements from reaching Ye Laomo.”</p><p>If the target was an ancient cultivator's treasury or an ancient secret realm, they might have argued over who would go.  The first to enter would have the best chance of obtaining the most valuable treasures.</p><p>Their current target, however, was a single ancient cultivator.  Securing this person and extracting ancient secrets would benefit everyone.  Facing Ye Laomo directly was inherently dangerous; remaining outside, protected by the opposing Nine Palaces Formations, was far safer.</p><p>Therefore, there was no debate, and the participants were quickly decided.</p><p>The most challenging aspect was choosing the person to hold the jade talismans.</p><p>To deceive Jiang Chenzi and others, the power of the opposing Nine Palaces Formations couldn't be noticeably weakened.</p><p>Master Chongyi and his two disciples possessed unique cultivation methods. While potent elixirs greatly enhanced their power, there were limitations; they couldn't be separated by large distances, sacrificing flexibility.</p><p>Knowing they couldn't hide anything from the experienced Ye Laomo, they decided to remain and manage the jade talismans.  The three could each manage one.</p><p>The other selection was unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang assumed her senior sister would be chosen.  Having received Yuan Shen Gate's treasured inheritance, her expertise in formations ensured success.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Lord Tongyou selected Qing Jun to go, leaving Xiang Qing to manage the main formation. Xiang Qing had refined several strands of Ancestral Saint Fire, significantly increasing her power. However, in Lord Tongyou's eyes, Qing Jun was even stronger.</p>
