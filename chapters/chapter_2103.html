<h1>Chapter 2094: Turmoil in the Demon Sea</h1><p>North of the Demon Sea.</p><p>Colossal figures silently ascended from the ocean depths, like leviathans surfacing from the abyss.  A massive Flood Dragon led the vanguard, its golden scales and majestic horns gleaming.  Perched between its horns stood JiaoLong Wang and other demon elites.</p><p>The night was deep, dark clouds obscuring the moon.</p><p>Under the shroud of darkness, JiaoLong Wang led the demon host in a grand procession towards the Demon Sea.</p><p>Several days later, as dawn broke, the army approached their destination.</p><p>After the Chang You Clan occupied the Demon Sea and the Boundless Wave Sea, they hadn't relocated many of their people there. They used the seas as a springboard to seize Azure Spirit Energy and as a deterrent against the eastern front of the Storm Realm.  Their main forces were entrenched in locations rich with spiritual energy, and the relocated clansmen resided around the encampments.</p><p>The Demon Sea and the Boundless Wave Sea were transformed into a network of encampments by the Chang You Clan.  They remained wary of the Storm Realm, maintaining tight security and stationing numerous experts within their fortifications, making intelligence gathering difficult.</p><p>However, the Demon Clan and the Chang You Clan had clashed several times in the Tainted Lands. The Demons continuously dispatched spies to monitor the encampments, eventually discerning certain patterns. JiaoLong Wang had a rough estimate of the Chang You Clan’s troop strength.</p><p>The redeployment of Chang You Clan forces to the Northern Sea was orchestrated by JiaoLong Wang. Consequently, the defenses here were significantly weakened.</p><p>Among the numerous encampments, two held paramount importance, occupying the areas with the richest spiritual energy in the Boundless Wave Sea and the Demon Sea.  They were located at the former ancestral grounds of the Flood Dragons and the human city of Tian Xing.</p><p>Of course, both locations were now unrecognizable.</p><p>JiaoLong Wang's plan was to launch a direct assault and reclaim their ancestral grounds before the Chang You Clan could react.</p><p>The islands were arranged in a circular formation, with guards positioned around the perimeter, creating an impenetrable defense.</p><p>JiaoLong Wang employed every tactic to conceal the movements of his army and personally eliminated sentries. But the sheer scale of the demon army’s advance made it impossible to remain hidden indefinitely.</p><p>Ancestral Grounds of the Flood Dragons.</p><p>The eastern sky began to brighten, a faint crescent moon still visible in the heavens, creating a scene of tranquility.</p><p>Suddenly, the clang of a bell shattered the camp's serenity.</p><p>This was a warning bell, rung only when a major enemy attacked.  The Chang You Clan's enemies were the savage beasts of the Tainted Lands and the Storm Realm. The Storm Realm had been recuperating and gathering strength, and had never attacked this location before.</p><p>Within a lavish palace, an elder of the Chang You Clan abruptly opened his eyes.  Moments later, the sound of something breaking the air barrier reached him, signaling that the defensive formations had been triggered.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>The elder commanded in a low voice.</p><p>A large man in black armor pushed open the palace doors and hurried inside, his expression grave.</p><p>"What is happening outside?" the elder inquired.</p><p>"Reporting to Third Elder!"</p><p>The armored man bowed deeply.  "The Ninth Wave Encampment has sounded the alarm.  A large enemy force has launched a surprise attack, and the Ninth Wave Encampment is besieged. Enemy elites are converging on our position!  We failed to detect this enemy force earlier.  This subordinate bears full responsibility.  Please punish me, Third Elder!"</p><p>His demeanor was composed, but a flicker of anxiety betrayed his true feelings.  To strategize for the Northern Sea campaign, the General had ordered the withdrawal of a significant portion of their forces, leaving them vulnerable. Furthermore, to exert pressure on the Middle Continent, they had dispatched another contingent to patrol the eastern seas near the Storm Realm.</p><p>"A large enemy force?"</p><p>The Third Elder's eyes narrowed.  He did not rebuke the armored man. "Are they humans or demons?"</p><p>The armored man paused, unsure of the Third Elder’s intent. He replied, "We only see a vast tide of beasts surrounding the Ninth Wave Encampment. We haven't detected any human presence."</p><p>"Indeed, it’s the Demons, just as the Clan Leader predicted!"</p><p>The Third Elder murmured softly. After a moment of contemplation, he issued his command in a deep voice. "Transmit my orders.  All encampments are to abandon their positions.  Everyone is to retreat immediately, including us!"</p><p>The armored man gasped.  "Retreat to where?"</p><p>"To the West Moon Sea! If those Demons pursue relentlessly, continue to fall back and await the Clan Leader’s instructions!" the Third Elder declared decisively.</p><p>The West Moon Sea was the Chang You Clan's name for the Boundless Wave Sea, while the Demon Sea was referred to as the East Moon Sea.  The two seas were not far apart, yet a distinct boundary separated them, resembling two halves of a severed moon.</p><p>"Third Elder, why?"</p><p>The armored man's face was etched with astonishment and disbelief. The Third Elder intended to retreat without offering any resistance, even abandoning the West Moon Sea entirely.</p><p>Their defenses were weakened, but they were not incapable of fighting. If they held out until reinforcements arrived, the situation could still be salvaged.</p><p>Those Demons were no longer the same as before.  Once they surrendered their territory, reclaiming it would be a formidable task, and they would be deemed unforgivably culpable.</p><p>"The Clan Leader has made preparations for this for many years. This retreat is part of a larger strategy," the Third Elder explained calmly.</p><p>Hearing this, the armored man's doubts dissipated. He acknowledged the order and withdrew from the palace.</p><p>The Third Elder sat behind his desk, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>In truth, he was also unaware of the Clan Leader’s precise intentions, and why he was willingly ceding ground to the enemy.  Moreover, years ago, they had begun preparations for this retreat, gradually sending the weaker members of the clan back to Sacred Mu Plain, leaving only the main army to guard the encampments.</p><p>Under different circumstances, he would have questioned the Clan Leader about the reasoning, weighed the pros and cons, and even defied orders if necessary, summoning the other elders for consultation.</p><p>But with the Clan Leader’s breakthrough to the second level of the Emptiness Realm, his authority was absolute.  Moreover, once the Clan Leader emerged, he could effortlessly recapture this territory.  Temporary gains and losses were insignificant; preserving their strength and avoiding unnecessary casualties was paramount.</p><p>Soon, the ringing of the bell was replaced by the pounding of war drums. A cacophony of sounds erupted from outside.</p><p>After a brief period of quiet contemplation, the Third Elder rose, adjusted his robes, and strode out of the palace.</p><p>Dark clouds filled the sky, and shadowy figures flitted about.  The remaining forces at the Ancestral Grounds of the Flood Dragons were the elite of the clan, adept at maneuvering. They gathered what they could carry and, at the Third Elder's command, retreated in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demon army advanced with unstoppable momentum.</p><p>With their presence revealed, they discarded all pretense of concealment and charged towards the Ancestral Grounds of the Flood Dragons with utmost speed.</p><p>They moved in a straight line, disregarding any Chang You Clan encampments in their path, yet they encountered few major battles. Their enemies had undoubtedly received prior warning and fled, leaving behind deserted encampments.</p><p>The demon army surged forward, riding the wind and waves. Astonishingly, they encountered no significant resistance until they neared the Ancestral Grounds of the Flood Dragons.  The demon army's morale soared; their progress was far smoother than any of them had anticipated.</p><p>"Finally, we return!"</p><p>JiaoLong Wang gazed ahead, a wistful expression on his face.</p><p>This was the ancestral home of the Flood Dragon Clan, his birthplace.  He recalled the humiliation and desperation of their expulsion by the Chang You Clan.</p><p>Centuries had passed, and the landscape had changed dramatically, rendering many sights unfamiliar.  Yet, a sense of familiarity washed over him. Despite his tempered nature, he couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion.</p><p>The demon army's advance was a spectacle of unrestrained power.  Their demonic aura soared into the heavens, and howling demon winds whipped across the sea, creating a tempest that churned the waters into towering waves, sweeping towards the Ancestral Grounds of the Flood Dragons.</p><p>From afar, several Demon Kings channeled their spiritual sight and finally caught sight of the Chang You Clan encampment.</p><p>The encampment was shrouded in a black mist, resembling a dark iron curtain that obscured their view. Within, all was silent.</p><p>Outside the iron curtain, not a single soldier was in sight.</p><p>"This is strange. Could it be a trap?" Golden Toad King remarked.</p><p>"It's unlikely.  The Chang You Clan wouldn't dare lay a trap for us here. Most likely, they have already abandoned the encampment," Phoenix King countered.</p><p>This reasoning sounded plausible. JiaoLong Wang nodded slightly, restrained his aura, and commanded his Flood Dragon mount to halt.</p><p>Golden Toad King and Phoenix King conferred briefly before dispersing amongst their ranks.  Then, earth-shattering roars reverberated through the crashing waves.</p><p>The army surged past JiaoLong Wang on both flanks, rushing towards the iron curtain like a tidal wave.</p><p>The Phoenix Clan led the airborne forces – a countless multitude of birds, herons, cranes, eagles, and sparrows.  Their wings filled the sky, creating a vast, dark canopy.</p><p>Beneath the waves, Flood Dragons led the aquatic forces – an army of shrimp soldiers and crab generals, alongside colossal whale sharks, seamlessly integrated with the churning tides.</p><p>Between the sky and the sea, the Golden Toad Clan led the land beasts, traversing the waves.  They advanced in a dense, yet remarkably organized formation.</p><p>They were everywhere – in the sky, on land, and in the sea.  The beast tide shimmered with intermittent flashes of formation light and the glow of various treasures.</p><p>"Croak!"</p><p>Just as the beast tide was about to collide with the iron curtain, a toad's croak echoed, resonating with a peculiar rhythm.  Golden light erupted from the vanguard of the beast tide, as if each demon was now clad in golden armor.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The heavens and earth trembled as the beast tide slammed into the iron curtain.</p><p>From JiaoLong Wang's vantage point, the iron curtain was completely obscured by the countless demon beasts.</p><p>They pressed together in a dense mass. If they couldn't breach the iron curtain directly, those behind would crush those in front, resulting in self-inflicted casualties.</p><p>This, however, did not occur. The front line of the beast tide suddenly diverted to the sides, ensuring that the force from behind continuously bombarded the iron curtain, like river water crashing against reefs, flowing smoothly without any impediment.</p><p>At that moment, JiaoLong Wang's expression shifted slightly.  He sensed the iron curtain wavering even before the first wave of the beast tide had fully impacted.  Moments later, a deafening boom echoed across the battlefield. All the demons, including JiaoLong Wang, were momentarily stunned.  A crack had appeared in the iron curtain.</p><p>Reclaiming their ancestral grounds with such unexpected ease, the demon army didn't halt their advance.  JiaoLong Wang, Golden Toad King, and Phoenix King divided their forces into three separate columns.  Wherever the army marched, the enemy offered little resistance, abandoning their encampments and fleeing.</p><p>Swiftly, the army swept across the entire Demon Sea, reclaiming ancestral territories one after another.  The Chang You Clan was all but completely driven out of the Demon Sea.</p><p>The Demon Kings then convened. JiaoLong Wang resolved to continue the offensive and expel the Chang You Clan from the Boundless Wave Sea entirely.</p><p>The results of this campaign were spectacular, but he was not satisfied.  The Chang You Clan had avoided direct confrontation, minimizing their losses.  It was like punching cotton, not the decisive victory JiaoLong Wang desired.</p><p>The Boundless Wave Sea was too close to the Demon Sea.  If they didn't seize this opportunity to crush the Chang You Clan's elite forces, once they regrouped, they would inevitably launch a counteroffensive, and the Demons would never know peace.</p><p>Sacred Mu Plain.</p><p>By the shores of the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The Clan Leader of the Chang You Clan had emerged from seclusion at some point and was now meeting with Zai Zhen in a stone pavilion atop a lakeside mountain.</p><p>“Brother Zai, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” Min Zhuo inquired, a hint of wariness in his eyes.</p><p>Zai Zhen gazed towards the horizon. “Brother Min, how fares your conflict with those Demons?”</p><p>“As per your suggestion, Brother Zai, I’ve deployed my forces to conquer the Northern Sea.  As you predicted, that powerful Demon has not appeared.  However, recently, the Demons launched an offensive to reclaim their ancestral grounds, likely at his behest,” Min Zhuo replied truthfully.</p><p>“I presume you ordered your clan to retreat, unwilling to offend that powerful Demon?” Zai Zhen remarked.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned, a sense of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>“Unfortunately, that’s not what *he* desires,” Zai Zhen shook his head slightly.  “Next, Brother Min, you should personally lead the eastern campaign and unleash a bloodbath, teaching those Demons an unforgettable lesson!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Min Zhuo’s heart skipped a beat, and he abruptly stood up. “Brother Zai, are you asking me to slaughter those Demon cultivators?”</p><p>With his second level Emptiness Realm cultivation, such an act would be bullying the weak. That powerful Demon would certainly not stand idly by, and they might even become mortal enemies.</p><p>“Not I, but *he* desires it,” Zai Zhen gestured towards the heavens.  “Brother Min, you needn't worry unduly. This is precisely to lure him out.  I and other fellow Daoists will naturally be there to support you!”</p><p>Min Zhuo's face flickered with indecision.  He understood his role – he was a mere pawn in a larger game!</p><p>But he dared not disobey.  If he didn't offend the powerful Demon, he would offend the one who had gifted him the Jade Yang Divine Milk.</p><p>He swiftly assessed the situation. “With Brother Zai’s support, I naturally have no fear. However, my clan's elite forces are currently in the Northern Sea. Should the enemy retaliate or use them as hostages…”</p><p>Zai Zhen nodded. “Brother Min is thoughtful. In that case, I shall dispatch a fellow Daoist to safeguard them.  This should ease your concerns.”</p><p>With that, he flicked his finger, sending out a spell.  A subtle ripple emanated from the distant mountains, echoing faintly in response. (End of Chapter)</p>
