<h1>Chapter 677: Arrival</h1><p>Having found leads on both treasures, Qin Sang was in high spirits. He bought a considerable number of items, strolling until evening before heading to the city gate for the rendezvous.</p><p>Ning Kun and the others had already arrived. Judging by their cheerful expressions, their haul must have been substantial.</p><p>Besides them, the other merchants who had fallen behind had also gathered.  It seemed they had procured a large amount of goods on Tianwu Island and were ready to depart.</p><p>"Elder Zou just sent a message. A powerful faction is sending a ship out to sea. We've decided to depart immediately. Have you made up your mind, Daoist Priest? Would you like to join us?"</p><p>Ran Luo looked at Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I came here to hunt sea demons, so any island will do. I'll go to Stone Cliff Island with you. If my refining skills are not what your Chamber of Commerce seeks, I hope Fellow Daoist Ran can offer me some assistance."</p><p>Ran Luo smiled faintly. "Daoist Priest, you are too modest. Elder Zou spoke very highly of you. We would be more than happy to have you join the Chamber of Commerce."</p><p>The itinerary was settled with a few words, and he was now practically one of them.  Ran Luo and the others were noticeably more cordial towards him.</p><p>While they were talking, more people from the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce arrived in carriages. Ran Luo waved her hand, and they headed straight for the port with their goods.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang learned that the ship they were taking belonged to the Nine Star Association, one of the top Chambers of Commerce in the East Pole Alliance. The ship was heavily guarded and had many fellow Daoists on board.</p><p>"Didn't your Chamber of Commerce send a ship?"</p><p>Arriving at the port, the ship had not yet arrived, and they waited where they were. Qin Sang stood beside Ran Luo and asked.</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. "Our Chamber of Commerce focuses on the Inner Sea and Great Wilderness Island. We don't have sufficient guards on Tianwu Island. Shipwrecks are very common in the Demon Sea, and the routes are not entirely safe.  Not only will we encounter frequent sea demon attacks along the way, but the storms that frequently arise in the Demon Sea are far more powerful than those in the Inner Sea.  Each of these calamities, natural or man-made, can be fatal."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. No wonder the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce valued him so much. Compared to massive demon corpses, refined artifacts were naturally easier to transport.</p><p>The risks of trading in the Demon Sea were so high that minimizing trips and carrying more goods at once was the way to mitigate those risks.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had heard more than once that the storms in the Demon Sea were terrifying, a natural disaster on par with beast tides. When cultivators hunting demons spotted signs of a storm, they had to find shelter. Otherwise, if caught in the storm, there was no chance of survival.</p><p>But Qin Sang had always had a question.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ran, are the storms in the Demon Sea, like those in the Inner Sea, caused by power spilling over from the surrounding storm belt?  Are the Demon Sea and our Inner Sea separated by this storm belt?"</p><p>Ran Luo pondered. "The storms in the Inner Sea and the Demon Sea are indeed somewhat similar, but I don't know if the two are separated by a sea of storms. There are too many rumors and conflicting accounts. To this day, there's no definitive answer as to where the Demon Sea lies in relation to our Inner Sea."</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang felt a huge shadow drift over. Looking up, he saw a tall, sturdy, though not luxurious, treasure ship slowly approaching.</p><p>As the ship drew near,</p><p>Ran Luo arranged the cargo and led Qin Sang and the others to the guest rooms on the ship's deck, then went to pay respects to Elder Zou and the ship's owner. Qin Sang wasn't officially part of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce yet, so he stayed in his room, not going anywhere.</p><p>The ship stayed at the port overnight and set sail before dawn the next day.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied a room by himself.  He set up spirit-locking and spirit-gathering formations, then stood by the window, gazing at the sea.</p><p>In this world, it was his first time sailing on the sea. As the ship sailed forward, his view broadened, and soon Tianwu Island was far behind, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>The stars hadn't faded yet. Above and below, the starry sky and the sea met at the horizon.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were vast waves and countless stars. Seeing such a scene broadened one's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the window, somewhat entranced, reminiscing about the past.</p><p>When he came back to his senses and saw the scene before him clearly, he suddenly recalled a line of poetry— *Drunk, unaware of the sky in the water, a boat full of clear dreams pressing down on the galaxy.*</p><p>…</p><p>After the initial novelty wore off, there was a long voyage.</p><p>It wasn't boring, though.  Sea demons frequently attacked the ship, providing entertainment.</p><p>At first, Qin Sang was enthusiastic about watching the battles from the deck, learning about the habits of the sea demons and observing the strength of the Demon Sea cultivators.  Later, he simply stayed in his room, studying the refining techniques he had bought for a hefty price on Tianwu Island.</p><p>Normally, refining artifacts, even with demon corpses, required some precious spiritual materials.</p><p>However, there were so many demon beast materials in the Demon Sea, practically an endless supply. The refiners in the Demon Sea had found a different approach, using various demon corpses in combination, supplemented by a small amount of spiritual materials, to achieve quite good results.</p><p>This was different from the Void Spirit Sect's methods, a field Qin Sang hadn't touched before, so naturally, he had to study it carefully.</p><p>However, mastery of one method leads to mastery of all. With his expertise in refining, he learned quickly by analogy, enough to refine top-grade artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in refining, day and night, losing track of time.</p><p>The treasure ship continued sailing, passing islands, stopping and starting, with people embarking and disembarking.</p><p>Fortunately, the journey was smooth, with no encounters with large demon groups or storms.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang had reviewed the refining techniques several times and was experimenting in his room with pill fire, trying to integrate them as soon as possible.  There was a knock on the door. A sweep of his divine sense revealed Ran Luo standing outside.</p><p>"Daoist Priest Qing Feng, we're approaching Stone Cliff Island. It's time to disembark," Ran Luo said softly.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to awaken from a dream. He shook his head, pushing aside the refining knowledge filling his mind.  Looking at the messy room, he smiled, waved his hand to clean it, and opened the door.</p><p>Walking to the deck, he saw a dark spot in the distance, gradually growing larger.</p><p>Ran Luo handed Qin Sang a token and whispered, "Elder Zou has already purchased several cave dwellings on the island, all good locations on spirit veins. Daoist Priest, choose a cave dwelling to rest for a few days, and then we'll discuss business."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and took the token.</p><p>During this period, he had been engrossed in refining and needed time to consolidate his knowledge. He was certain that his refining skills would be greatly improved.</p><p>The refining techniques of the two regions complemented each other, bringing Qin Sang tremendous benefits.</p><p>He was now confident that he could refine top-grade artifacts even without the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Stone Cliff Island was a stone island.  The peaks on the island were jagged, with exposed rocks like blades and little greenery.</p><p>On the seemingly desolate island, rows of stone houses stood in neat rows, surrounded by a low, crude wall.</p><p>However, the spiritual energy on the island was very rich.</p>
