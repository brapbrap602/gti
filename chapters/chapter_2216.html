<h1>Chapter 2206 Hong Tian</h1><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A gust of wind swept across the lake. Hong Yue descended from the sky, glancing at the young man.</p><p>The young man's expression tightened, he took a step back, and said with a forced smile, "Of course, what is important is Hong Tian's business. I'll wait here for Qin Zhenren to return."</p><p>Hong Yue turned to Qin Sang, his tone leaving no room for argument: "Qin Zhenren, Hong Tian is waiting for you. Come with me."</p><p>"Daoist Friend Qin…"</p><p>Liuli looked at Qin Sang with worry, Qin Sang's expression was equally grave.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure of Hong Tian's intentions in summoning him. Before entering the Heart Lake, Hong Tian had treated everyone equally. Why the sudden change of attitude?</p><p>Had something happened during that time, or…?</p><p>A possibility struck Qin Sang, causing his heart to tremble. However, having weathered countless storms, his mental state was as steady as a mountain. He remained calm, giving Liuli a reassuring look, then glancing at the young man.</p><p>Unsure of the young man's motives, but clearly a summons from a Saint-level expert was more important. Qin Sang didn't waste words, lightly tapping his foot, he rose into the air and bowed slightly, "Thank you for leading the way."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's compliance, Hong Yue's expression softened, he nodded in satisfaction and soared into the sky.</p><p>The two vanished into the horizon in an instant.</p><p>"This fairy…"</p><p>After Hong Yue left, the young man turned his attention to Liuli, forcing a smile.</p><p>"Daoist Friend Qin should be back soon. If you have anything, tell him directly," Liuli said, without giving the young man a chance to respond, she flew away.</p><p>The young man's face turned pale, then red, but ultimately he didn't stop her.</p><p>Liuli flew directly over the islet towards the outside of the Heart Lake.  Qin Sang's summons by Hong Tian was highly unusual and she needed to inform the Yuanxiang Clan Chief immediately.</p><p>If Qin Sang ran into trouble, the Yuanxiang Clan Chief's intervention would give them a fighting chance.</p><p>Passing through the dense fog, Liuli returned to the mountain peak where they had rested, only to find it now shattered.</p><p>Before the mountain fragments, Liuli paused, sensing energy from ahead, and continued onward. Soon, she saw a bright blue light piercing through the mist, forming a long, ribbon-like glow extending beyond sight, floating in mid-air like a meandering river.</p><p>Figures were seated on this ribbon of light—the Yuanxiang Clan Chief and others.</p><p>The ribbon of light was clearly a manifestation of a spirit formation. The Clan Chief and others were using it to push the front lines forward, creating a larger buffer zone.</p><p>They had just repelled a wave of beasts and were resting during the lull. Liuli noticed that everyone present was a Void Realm Double-Cultivation expert, their faces weary, highlighting the intensity of the battle during her time in the Heart Lake.</p><p>Now it seemed that being forcefully sent into the Heart Lake might not have been such a bad thing.</p><p>Liuli's arrival startled them.  Everyone looked up, and seeing Liuli unharmed, Yuan Jian's eyes darkened.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief looked behind Liuli, but seeing no sign of Qin Sang, his expression grew increasingly grave. He slowly stood up and asked in a low voice, "Where is Qin Zhenren?"</p><p>Liuli landed on the ribbon of light and transmitted her voice, "Daoist Friend Qin is fine. He's been summoned by Hong Tian…"</p><p>"Hong Tian summoned Qin Zhenren?"</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief was astonished.</p><p>Liuli had suspected that the Yuanxiang Clan Chief might have revealed Qin Sang's identity as a Daoist Court heir, but it seemed he knew nothing about it.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A tremor echoed through the void.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief glanced back, saying, "The beast tide is coming. The two adults strictly ordered us not to retreat. After repelling this wave, I'll find an excuse to visit Hong Tian. Don't worry, my lady. If Hong Tian intended harm to Qin Zhenren, he wouldn't have sent someone to 'invite' him; he would have killed him directly."</p><p>Liuli nodded. She knew nothing of Hong Tian and could only trust the Clan Chief's judgment.</p><p>Then, she relayed to the Yuanxiang Clan Chief how she'd gotten the jade slip from Tang Yi.</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed the Yuanxiang Clan Chief's eyes. He had assumed Qin Sang was only concerned with survival.  He never expected Qin Sang to dare to set a trap and counterattack while in the midst of battle, and actually succeed.</p><p>"The beast tide is intensifying. Now is not the time for internal conflict.  After this, I will personally ask Elder Yuan for an explanation!" the Yuanxiang Clan Chief said calmly.</p><p>As Liuli had just returned from the Heart Lake, she could forgo the battle and find a place to rest.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang followed Hong Yue, flying high above, the dense fog showing no signs of dissipating. Here, clouds and fog were indistinguishable.</p><p>Hongyue, my friend, might I inquire as to the reason for Lord Hongtian’s summons?  I wish to prepare myself accordingly, lest I offend the Lord with inappropriate responses,” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Your composure is admirable, holding your question until now,”</p><p>Hongyue, who had been subtly observing Qin Sang, spoke with less coldness than before.  “I am merely a messenger; I do not know the reason. You will learn upon meeting Lord Hongtian, but it should be nothing ill.”</p><p>As they flew higher, a palace became visible through the mist.</p><p>It seemed surrounded by gentle waves.  Not grand, but exquisitely crafted, fresh and elegant, possessing a unique charm.</p><p>“This is the Water Palace of King Longjiao,” Hongyue said.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed, understanding King Longjiao to be another powerful saint, of the merfolk.</p><p>Hongyue guided Qin Sang towards the right side of the palace. Soon, they saw the mist condense, like a white carpet undulating like towering mountains and clouds, creating a majestic scene.</p><p>“The Lord is ahead. Please proceed yourself,” Hongyue stopped outside the cloud-mountains, bowing in farewell.</p><p>Amidst the cloud-mountains, in silent solitude, sat a single meditation cushion. Upon it, a man in a green robe was seated.</p><p>He had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, horns on his forehead, and an untamed air about him.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes, his deep gaze falling upon Qin Sang.</p><p>With a single glance, Qin Sang’s heart tightened.  He flew across the cloud-mountains, landing before the cushion and respectfully said, “Greetings, Lord Hongtian!”</p><p>“Qin Zhenren,” Hongtian nodded, his tone gentle.  “Have we met before?”</p><p>“I once sensed a heavenly tribulation from afar, believing the ascendant to be you, Senior. Fearing I might disrupt your tribulation, I did not dare approach, a missed opportunity I deeply regret,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>“No wonder! I did not know of your abilities at the time; otherwise, I would certainly have kept you to discuss the Dao.”</p><p>Hongtian smiled faintly.</p><p>Unsure of Hongtian’s intentions, Qin Sang repeatedly said, “I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>“Don’t be humble, Zhenren,” Hongtian’s tone suddenly changed. “Was it you who killed the Siyou Clan ancestor’s attendant?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped. His premonition had come true, but he was prepared, his expression unchanged. He questioned, “I’m unsure which… you speak of, my Lord?”</p><p>Hongtian waved his hand, cutting Qin Sang off. “Lately, that boy was the most boisterous, making connections, seeking revenge. Now, the mark on him is gone, yet you live, and are wounded. The conclusion is clear.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang’s tension eased slightly.</p><p>His greatest fear was not the exposure of the attendant’s death, but that Hongtian had witnessed his actions without his knowledge.  At that time, due to circumstances, he had nearly revealed all his trump cards!</p><p>Regardless of Mount Taiyu and the Cloud-Roaming Sword, the value of this small pocket dimension alone was immeasurable.</p><p>According to Ning Zhenren, only Mahayana cultivators could independently create pocket dimensions; the domains of Nascent Soul cultivators were merely rudimentary forms. They might occupy several small thousand worlds as their cultivation grounds, but refining them into rings would likely be difficult.</p><p>From Hongtian’s tone, it seemed his judgment was based on the lingering aura of the mark.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a long time, then said hoarsely, “I hope you understand, my Lord. I was truly forced into it. The initial cause was…”</p><p>“Heh heh. You needn't fear. I have no interest in your grievances, nor will I take up his cause. That boy meticulously laid an ambush, only to be killed. That old fellow from the Siyou Clan surely has no face to intervene,” Hongtian sneered.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly, but remained perplexed. If not for the attendant, why had Hongtian summoned him?</p><p>Hongtian studied Qin Sang, then suddenly said, “Two marks have vanished. The other was the attendant’s ally, also seemingly killed by you. Regardless of your methods, your mental fortitude and strength are exceptional, surpassing most. You are the person I seek! I lack capable individuals; will you serve me?”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. A complete turnaround—Hongtian wished to recruit him?</p><p>“My Lord, you want me to pledge allegiance? But I am an outsider…”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t fathom Hongtian’s intentions, choosing his words carefully.  The sentiment “Those of different races have different hearts” was not just a human idea!</p><p>“No matter! A Daoist disciple is even better. There might be unexpected benefits!” Hongtian stated decisively.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately pictured the secret realm in his mind, and a guess formed.  Within the Heart Lake, the only thing connected to the Daoist sect was the island and its secret realm.  The gathering of the Yi Ren ancestral disciples in the secret realm certainly held a mystery; it seemed Hong Tian also had designs on it.</p><p>"You must have guessed,"</p><p>Hong Tian looked up, gazing into the depths of the Heart Lake. "This alliance is temporary. I have no interest in taking on a foreign subordinate. Of course, I won't use you for nothing. After the matter is concluded, you will receive a substantial reward."</p><p>It sounded like Hong Tian was seeking Qin Sang's opinion, not forcing him, but Qin Sang knew he had no power to refuse. In fact, he had been excited; he and Liuli were searching for a way back into the secret realm, and Hong Tian was offering an opportunity.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also understood that this was no simple matter, otherwise Hong Tian wouldn't have emphasized his strength.</p><p>"To serve you, my lord, is my honor. I dare not ask for any reward.  However, I am worried that my abilities are insufficient and I might ruin your plans.  I hope you will enlighten me as to what you require of me," Qin Sang bowed and replied.</p><p>He didn’t accept immediately, nor did he refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang's cautious demeanor pleased Hong Tian. Hong Tian said slowly, "Some seeds are nearing maturity there. I need you to investigate their whereabouts and ideally collect some. If you succeed, you can keep one for yourself."</p><p>"Seeds?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>What kind of 'seeds' was Hong Tian referring to? Flower seeds, tree seeds, or some other kind of designation?</p><p>"The time is not yet right. I can't explain what these seeds look like or what form they take. You will know when the time comes…"</p><p>After a pause, Hong Tian said meaningfully, "These seeds are extraordinary.  In the future, when you attempt to break through to the Unity Stage, refining one might greatly increase your chances of success."</p><p>"What? It can help me break through!"</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly shocked, his face showing astonishment.</p><p>The higher the cultivation level, the rarer the breakthrough-enhancing elixirs.</p><p>Since arriving in this vast world, Qin Sang had only heard of a few rare spiritual medicines effective in breaking through to the Unity Stage – legendary treasures, long lost to the world.</p><p>He had never dared to hope he would obtain such a thing.</p><p>He had planned to, once things settled down, journey to the Wu tribe to seek help from Gui Mu and Liuying in finding a method for his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to break through. Helping the Sky-Eyed Butterfly reach its seventh transformation, and then having it in turn help him, seemed the most viable path.</p><p>There was also the Qilin essence, but the passage of time was uncertain; whether the Qilin essence still existed, and if he, a human cultivator, could even refine it, were both questionable.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reaction, Hong Tian wasn't surprised. He didn't need to use force; no one could refuse such a temptation!</p><p>Moreover, the temptation didn't end there.</p><p>Hong Tian continued, "Although the Sacred Land has undergone changes, the struggle between the two factions continues, as it involves numerous opportunities.  This is the fairest way. Originally, it has nothing to do with you outsiders, but I can ensure your participation, as an advance reward.  What treasures you acquire will depend on your own abilities."</p><p>One temptation after another, leaving Qin Sang speechless.</p><p>However, he was also acutely aware that the greater the temptation, the greater the risk!</p><p>"So, those cultivators who emerged from the Sacred Land are all seeking the seeds?"</p><p>"Correct, but your competitors are not limited to them. In the end, some may disregard decorum and make a personal move!"</p><p>Hong Tian watched Qin Sang's reaction with amusement, finding his composure even more pleasing. "But don't worry, I will protect you then."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but smile wryly.</p><p>If Hong Tian could intervene in time, that would be fine, but what if he was too slow?  Wouldn't he be doomed?</p><p>"My lord didn't you say you can't enter the Heart Lake?"</p><p>"Did I?"</p><p>Hong Tian denied it outright, smiling slyly.</p><p>"However, we do have some reservations and cannot act rashly.  And we have more important things to do now. I'm tied up here and can't leave, so I need you to act for me. Once the situation stabilizes and the power in the Heart Lake recedes, we will still have to settle the score.  To put it crudely...there's a delicious feast, most of which has already been shared out, leaving only one bowl. This bowl was originally meant for us latecomers.  Those old timers, having secured a large portion, are still greedy and want to reach in for more. Success would be great, but even failure is not a significant loss. Therefore, we don't actually have many real opponents; there's no need to worry about offending those old timers."</p>
