<h1>Chapter 1843: Inside and Outside the Jade Altar</h1><p>Outside the Jade Altar.</p><p>The atmosphere on the battlefield grew increasingly tense.</p><p>Even those with long lifespans, veterans of the last Daoist-Demon War, couldn't help but hold their breath, their hearts filled with apprehension.</p><p>Previous wars, though brutal, had escalated gradually from minor skirmishes.  This scale of deployment from the outset was unprecedented.</p><p>It was impossible to imagine how cruel the upcoming battle would be.</p><p>Cultivators and demon cultivators alike not only watched the enemy in front but also silently observed the strange phenomena behind them.</p><p>These phenomena marked the locations of the Demon King and the Grand Masters, and everyone waited for orders.</p><p>Battle could erupt at any moment.</p><p>Even if the internal struggle within the Jade Altar concluded, this turmoil was far from over.</p><p>……</p><p>The two armies faced off, swords drawn.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first experience with such a large-scale battle. Compared to the armies outside the Jade Altar, the Three Regions War of the Northern Star Realm paled in significance.</p><p>“The main forces have arrived, and there wasn't even a hint of warning beforehand…”</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the complexities of the situation and hadn't anticipated the war's swift arrival.</p><p>In his understanding, once the Daoist Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom, two powerful entities, initiated war, they would make thorough preparations. He would have surely noticed some signs during his trips to and from the Ju Mountain Jade Altar.</p><p>The snake demon was a demon god of the Gui Fang Kingdom, holding a considerable position.  Mo Xing Dao, hiding within the demon kingdom, should have also sensed some warning signs and sent a message.</p><p>Yet, the two armies inexplicably confronted each other outside the Jade Altar, completely sealing off the exit.</p><p>The atmosphere on the battlefield was tense, but both sides seemed relatively restrained; a fight hadn't broken out yet.</p><p>However, even though a space was left between the armies, Qin Sang dared not venture out.  Everything was interconnected; it was hard to predict what consequences his appearance might trigger.</p><p>“The Daoist Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom wouldn't start a war here without reason. If these armies, the Demon King, and the Grand Masters are merely there to provide support, what is their real objective?”</p><p>Qin Sang retreated almost to the edge of the auspicious clouds, hoping the thick clouds would shield him from the Grand Masters' perception.</p><p>He paused, turned, and looked towards the depths of the Jade Altar.</p><p>This upheaval was undoubtedly connected to the previous struggle for control of the Jade Altar. Unfortunately, he had chosen to stay out of it last time and still didn't know what they were fighting over.</p><p>Judging by the situation, this matter would certainly not end peacefully. He feared a large-scale conflict, with the armies storming the Jade Altar, leading to the very scenario he dreaded most.</p><p>The only solace was that the Nascent Soul cultivators from both sides remained restrained, staying outside the Jade Altar, so his immediate safety wasn’t a concern for now.</p><p>If a chaotic battle broke out, a quiet escape would likely be feasible.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't want to abandon this cave abode, nor did he want to see the Jade Altar's layout altered and his previous efforts wasted, forcing him to start over.</p><p>As he pondered, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly suddenly sent a warning. Qin Sang focused his attention and detected an unusual fluctuation outside the auspicious clouds. It seemed someone had entered the Jade Altar, their aura strong—likely from the Daoist Court's army.</p><p>Both sides continuously dispatched experts into the Jade Altar, without hiding it from their enemies. This confirmed his deduction:</p><p>The struggle was happening inside the Jade Altar!</p><p>After a moment of reflection, Qin Sang decisively left the auspicious clouds, using the fastest speed to cross the Golden Hall area, and hid in a secluded spot on the opposite bank of the Nine-Curve Star River.</p><p>Jade Altar Exit.</p><p>The auspicious clouds surged, and six figures emerged. All wore Daoist robes. Some were old with youthful complexions, like accomplished hermits; others looked young, but their expressions and aura were anything but ordinary. Their cultivation was at least early Cave Profound stage, fourth-rank officials of the Daoist Court.</p><p>Cultivators below Cave Profound stage could barely protect themselves within the Jade Altar, let alone participate in this divine court struggle; they would only be a burden.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would immediately recognize the leader:  Wan Zhenren of the Northern Pole Exorcism Institute.</p><p>With Wan Zhenren leading, there was another old Daoist with deep wrinkles and an aged face among them.  The old Daoist's right arm was across his chest, holding a whisk upside down, hanging at his elbow. His face seemed somewhat blurred, his eyelids slightly drooping, his expression calm as a well, and his breath almost imperceptible. He exuded a profound air of old age.</p><p>His aura was so faint that ordinary people couldn't detect it. He quietly followed the other Zhenren, without a word, easy to overlook.</p><p>Wan Zhenren entered the Golden Hall, surveyed his surroundings, and conferred briefly with a fellow Zhenren. Then he gave an order.</p><p>The Zhenren immediately used various movement and Daoist techniques.  A dazzling array of strange lights shone as they either rode on treasure carriages, transformed into dragons, or rode on gentle breezes, displaying extraordinary powers and incredible speed.</p><p>Only the old Daoist walked through the air, keeping pace with the others without difficulty.</p><p>They traversed the Golden Hall, arriving at the Nine-Curve Star River without stopping, passing straight through.</p><p>Emerging from the winding star river, all the immortals were on high alert, activating their protective measures. Fortunately, there were no abnormalities outside the river.</p><p>Wan Zhenren glanced around, took out a yellow talisman, and flicked it with his finger. The talisman ignited without any flame.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A pale yellow flame flickered at Wan Zhenren's fingertips. He pointed it in several directions, observing the flame's changes. After a moment, he extinguished the flame and pointed towards the front right, saying, "Fellow Daoists, let's enter from here!"</p><p>No one objected.</p><p>Just as they were about to depart, the old Daoist's movements subtly paused. His pale eyes flashed with a faint gleam, before he nonchalantly continued with the others.</p><p>The other immortals didn't notice, but Wan Zhenren sensed something, and quietly asked, "Master Uncle, is there anything unusual nearby?"</p><p>"Nothing. Perhaps I'm just too sensitive after being away from the altar for so long."</p><p>The old Daoist replied indifferently and said no more.</p><p>Seeing this, Wan Zhenren didn't press further.  It was normal for demons to spy here; now wasn't the time for conflict. He then conferred with the other immortals before proceeding deeper into the altar.</p><p>After the immortals disappeared, Qin Sang slowly emerged from his hiding place, his expression grave as he watched them leave.</p><p>"Such keen perception!"</p><p>Qin Sang silently marveled.</p><p>He recognized Wan Zhenren, an old acquaintance, but the old Daoist was what truly caught his attention!</p><p>Earlier, while observing from the shadows, a slight movement nearly gave him away.</p><p>The old Daoist was incredibly strong!</p><p>Wan Zhenren was a fourth-rank celestial official, almost a top-tier expert below the Great Immortal level, yet in Qin Sang's opinion, he was no match for the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist wore a simple, unadorned Daoist robe, giving no indication of his identity.</p><p>"Could he be an unparalleled expert of the altar?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the two old Daoists who had sacrificed themselves for him at the Beiji Exorcism Altar.</p><p>The Daoist Court officials were likely just the publicly known strength; there were deeper, unseen reserves.</p><p>One of the demonic cultivators’ auras felt similar to the old Daoist's, possibly a legendary expert in seclusion at the Great Sage's Manor, a Nascent Soul cultivator who had attained Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>Even hidden experts were deployed; this showed how much importance the Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom placed on this battle.</p><p>These signs made Qin Sang increasingly uneasy, and he desperately wanted to know the truth, at least their motives.</p><p>Could hiding in his cave truly protect him from this storm?</p><p>Qin Sang feared even his cave might not be safe.</p><p>"I need to ask someone..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>He didn't want to openly appear and get involved; covert contact was preferable, even if it meant resorting to underhanded methods.</p><p>Both sides were traveling in groups for protection, but Qin Sang didn't believe they would always remain together.</p><p>His target was naturally a demonic cultivator.</p><p>He wasn't prejudiced against the demonic cultivators of this world, but as a human, unless forced, he couldn't side with the demons.</p><p>If one side had to perish, he would choose Gui Fang Kingdom. Bloodline and race naturally dictated his stance, irrespective of good or evil.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards where Wan Zhenren had been and recalled his talisman-burning action.</p><p>He guessed the yellow talisman was a form of identification within the Daoist Court. When Wan Zhenren pointed in several directions, the flame expanded, ultimately choosing a direction that produced no reaction.</p><p>"There must be other Daoist Court experts in those directions..."</p><p>Qin Sang then cross-referenced this with the locations of the destroyed markings, narrowing down two likely areas where only demons might be found. Choosing one at random, he set off.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the altar, wondrous and dazzling illusions filled the eyes.</p><p>At this moment, numerous powerful figures, rarely seen by ordinary people, traveled together, navigating through these illusions.</p><p>From the outside, the Jushan Altar seemed not particularly vast, but entering it revealed the enormous space within.</p><p>For two factions to deploy so many Nascent Soul cultivators, thoroughly exploring the entire altar would be a hopeless task.</p><p>Moreover, some areas deep within the altar were inaccessible even to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The aimless search continued.</p><p>Both sides seemed to deliberately avoid encounters, unwilling to engage in pointless battles before finding their targets.</p><p>Therefore, for a long time, no fighting occurred within the altar; everyone was focused on the dangers of the illusions.</p><p>In a certain part of the altar...</p><p>This illusion was a vast space, actually a crystal world, where only multi-colored crystals were visible.</p><p>The entire illusion was essentially one massive crystal, with its interior forming a network of twisting passages like a mine.</p><p>Fortunately, all the passages were spacious and didn't feel cramped.</p><p>However, sight and spiritual sense were both limited here.</p><p>The glistening crystals obstructed vision, and worse, they could absorb spiritual sense.</p><p>Spiritual sense contacting the crystal would be immediately devoured.  Even without actively deploying spiritual sense, staying in this place for a while would drain it.</p><p>The crystals were incredibly hard, making forceful passage impractical.</p><p>Exploring the Crystal Mirage required traversing every corner.</p><p>At this moment, six figures huddled together in one of the crystal passages. Though humanoid, most displayed incomplete transformations, a hallmark of their demonic cultivation. Some were due to their unique bloodlines, others a matter of choice.</p><p>The six demon cultivators, having already tested the crystal's properties, were strategizing.  The crystal space was vast, and careless exploration could easily lead to oversight.  The stakes were high, allowing no room for error.</p><p>"In my opinion," a slender man with a serpentine tail instead of legs said in a low voice, "besides the crystals, there's nothing remarkable here.  Going everywhere is a waste of time. Let's split up! We're all within the same mirage, making mutual support easy should anything happen.  What does Lord Xuan think?"</p><p>The other demon cultivators were intrigued, turning to the imposing Lord Xuan.</p><p>Lord Xuan pondered, glancing at a stocky, short man with round eyes and an elephantine trunk, clad in black robes.  Upon receiving a slight nod from the stocky man, Lord Xuan hesitated no longer and immediately ordered a search party.</p><p>"Report back here!"</p><p>The demons dispersed, accustomed to Xuan's reliance on the mysterious figure.</p><p>Along the way, Lord Xuan always consulted the stocky man before any major decisions. They were uncertain about his true identity, speculating he might be a powerful figure from the Great Sage's Mansion, otherwise Lord Xuan’s deference wouldn't make sense.</p><p>The six demon cultivators, including the stocky man, scattered, each selecting a passage and utilizing their escape techniques to quickly traverse and explore every corner.</p><p>Among them was a female cultivator, lacking any delicate femininity.  Her figure was like a tower, exceptionally robust.  Originally a dragon-scaled horse beast from the Luo River in Guifang, she retained a wide mouth even after transforming, a striking feature.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Water echoed through the passage.  Despite her build, the female demon moved with remarkable lightness, her feet creating ripples that carried her swiftly through the passage without leaving a trace.</p><p>Each demon cultivator took a direction. The female demon, focusing on her designated area, darted through the intersecting passages. She held a black jade token, its luster profound.  Her fingers occasionally glowed, caressing the token, as if using it to search for something.</p><p>As they had discovered, the crystal space only absorbed spiritual sense, posing no other danger. Their exploration speed was sufficient to allow them to retreat before any unbearable strain.  Besides, Lord Xuan and the mysterious expert were nearby, offering a safety net.</p><p>Though she reasoned thus, the female demon remained vigilant, carefully searching every corner.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, she passed through several passages.  The passage ahead looked the same; she glanced at it briefly before gliding into it on a wave of water.</p><p>Water splashed ahead of her as she moved faster through the passage, reaching the end smoothly without incident.  Her expression unchanged, she continued onward.</p><p>As she neared the end of the passage, about to pass through, a sudden, inexplicable unease washed over her.  The passage appeared perfectly normal.  She couldn’t pinpoint the source, but her spiritual perception never erred.</p><p>Her pupils constricted, her expression remaining unchanged, but the water beneath her feet turned silvery white.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The water swelled, forming a silvery wave about to crash ahead.  The female demon stopped abruptly, retreating while opening her wide mouth to unleash a powerful roar, a silver oval stone visible in her throat.  Even if it failed to repel any hidden enemy, it would shake the crystals and attract her companions.</p><p>Her reaction was swift, yet too late.  As the wave rose and her power was about to erupt…</p><p>Brilliant sword light erupted from within the passage, reflecting off the crystals in a blinding display, making it impossible to determine if it was one or many.  The terrifying killing intent accompanying the sword light caused even her to tremble, fear evident on her face.</p><p>At the passage's exit…</p><p>Qin Sang, his body covered in poisonous hair, stepped in.  Few knew the layout of the Altar better than he did.  He understood the crystal space’s peculiarity, and choosing this direction, he found his target. The crystals absorbed spiritual sense, but as long as he didn't actively release his own, they posed no threat.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The wave never formed, crushed beneath a foot, instantly shattering.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
