<h1>Chapter 1793: Tearing Apart a Demon Marquis</h1><p>As the shout resounded, a streak of lightning, swift as a shooting star chasing the moon, caught up, its遁 speed surpassing even Li Hou's. Before Li Hou could escape the confines of the jungle space, it intercepted him, blocking his path.</p><p>This was true Lightning Escape, Qin Sang finally utilizing his true essence, drawing upon the Azure Phoenix Lightning power within his Phoenix Wings.</p><p>Correspondingly, Qin Sang's true essence was also being consumed at an alarming rate. If he only possessed true essence comparable to the late Nascent Soul stage, he feared he wouldn't be able to maintain this for long.</p><p>However, at this moment, Qin Sang had already consumed a True Essence Stabilizing Pill.</p><p>Having decided to engage in a decisive battle with Li Hou, Qin Sang had discreetly retrieved the pill and held it in his mouth, ready to refine it at any moment.</p><p>The previous skirmish had instilled great confidence in Qin Sang. Seeing Li Hou attempting to flee, he immediately swallowed the pill.</p><p>The medicinal power surged through his body, awakening his qi sea from its slumber.</p><p>A continuous stream of medicinal power transformed into pure true essence, rapidly replenishing his qi sea. Qin Sang's aura climbed steadily, swiftly restoring his strength.</p><p>Moreover, this true essence was unaffected by external influences, showing no signs of instability. It flowed smoothly and steadily.</p><p>This long-lost sensation was intoxicating.  Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion, his desire for ascension growing even more fervent.</p><p>After all, he was fundamentally a Dharma cultivator, and the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture" was his true foundation!</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to consume the True Essence Stabilizing Pill.</p><p>The golden light's impact on Mount Ju Shan Zhi Zhi Altar was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Encountering a lone Demon Marquis was rare, and a location brimming with wood spirit energy was even harder to find.</p><p>Once the golden light faded, these Demon Marquises would likely regroup.</p><p>The future course of events remained unclear.  Having seen this opportunity, he naturally had to seize it with all his might.</p><p>Li Hou was trying to wear him down, but wasn't Qin Sang doing the same?</p><p>However, Li Hou was more alert and decisive than anticipated. Qin Sang had initially intended to feign an inability to withstand the wood spirit energy's impact, gradually appearing weakened, waiting for the final moment to counterattack.</p><p>The longer the delay, the more advantageous it would be for Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't expected Li Hou to unleash a killing blow midway, sensing danger and decisively abandoning its prey. This was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>The battle's progression wasn't as flawless as Qin Sang had envisioned, but there was no such thing as perfection in this world.  His opponent was a Demon Marquis at the mid Divine Transformation stage, after all. Qin Sang didn't harbor any illusions of outsmarting him to death.</p><p>Ultimately, victory would depend on strength!</p><p>Li Hou only saw a blur before his eyes, and Qin Sang was already standing before him, swinging his arms, his heavy fists like hammers, smashing towards him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's vital energy was replete, his momentum like a rainbow. There was no longer any trace of his foundation being shaken.</p><p>If Li Hou still harbored doubts earlier, he was now certain. This was a complete and utter scheme. The enemy had been feigning weakness all along, leading him step by step into a trap.</p><p>Caught off guard, Li Hou raised his claws to defend, simultaneously sensing another aura erupting from Qin Sang.</p><p>"Dual Cultivation of Dharma and Body!"</p><p>Li Hou exclaimed in shock.</p><p>He had always considered Qin Sang to be a Dragon-Tiger Altar cultivator, or perhaps a demon cultivator who had pledged allegiance to the Dao Court.</p><p>Aside from the Army Altar, it was rare for True Men of Profound Insight to summon Spirit Altars during combat, unless they were casting talismans beyond their cultivation level.</p><p>This was even more so for Dragon-Tiger Altar cultivators, whose entire cultivation was rooted in their physical bodies. There was no need for them to summon Spirit Altars.</p><p>Dual cultivators of Dharma and Body did exist in this world, but most reached a bottleneck in their cultivation, unable to progress further for a long time, and sought inspiration through body refinement. True dual cultivators were rare.</p><p>The Dao Court's Talisman Dao led directly to the Great Dao, profound and boundless, vast as the ocean. One could spend a lifetime and still only grasp a sliver of its essence. How many would dare to divide their attention?</p><p>Sensing true essence fluctuations from Qin Sang that were no weaker than his physical cultivation, Li Hou felt a deep sense of foreboding.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Fist and claw collided.</p><p>Li Hou wasn't injured and took the opportunity to retreat, immediately attempting to change direction, intent on escaping this jungle space.</p><p>With Li Hou's discerning eye, he clearly understood that within this jungle space, Qin Sang's Wood Spirit Body possessed immense power.  Once they left this place, Qin Sang's strength would inevitably diminish greatly.</p><p>Unfortunately, Li Hou's premonition came true.</p><p>As soon as Li Hou moved, he felt the light between heaven and earth suddenly dim, plunging the world into darkness. Then, stars began to rise one by one.</p><p>Starlight glittered, a constellation of stars illuminated the sky.</p><p>Li Hou felt as if he had been pulled into the depths of the starry sky. The bright starlight shining upon him felt like countless sword beams, chilling him to the bone.</p><p>"Sword Formation!"</p><p>Li Hou recognized at a glance that the stars were sword stars formed from sword intent, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>At this moment, his connection with heaven and earth seemed to be severed by the sword formation.</p><p>Ordinary formations struggled to trap Divine Transformation cultivators precisely because Divine Transformation cultivators had achieved a preliminary connection with heaven and earth. As long as a formation had the slightest flaw, it could easily be sensed by a Divine Transformation cultivator.</p><p>However, the "Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation" was a core inheritance of the Formless Immortal Sect's Gold Phase lineage, possibly even originating from the Immortal Palace. It was no ordinary sword formation.</p><p>Over the years, although Qin Sang hadn't been able to cultivate, it didn't hinder his comprehension of the sword formation. Now that he was deploying it, its power was far greater than before.</p><p>Seven sword souls presided over the seven stellar regions, augmented by the pseudo-spiritual treasure, the Gray Warbler Sword. Even though Qin Sang's cultivation was inferior to Li Hou's, it wouldn't be easily broken.</p><p>Perhaps Li Hou possessed formation-breaking techniques, but Qin Sang wouldn't give him the chance to use them.</p><p>The sword formation appeared.</p><p>Sword intent sealed heaven and earth.</p><p>In the next instant, Qin Sang's true body closed the distance, and without seeming to summon any magical treasure, his fists struck like thunder.</p><p>He continued to fight like a body cultivator, only now, Qin Sang was on the offensive.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Li Hou was forced to engage, this time being the one to retreat repeatedly. His eyes darted around, taking in each sword star, attempting to find a flaw in the Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation.</p><p>Lotus Flower Seal!</p><p>Demon Subduing Seal!</p><p>Wheel of Samsara Seal!</p><p>...</p><p>Buddhist seals emerged one after another.  Relying on the keen instincts granted by the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, Qin Sang unleashed a torrential assault upon Li Hou.</p><p>Faced with this level of attack, Li Hou didn't dare to be careless, reluctantly engaging.  Fortunately, the sword formation hadn't been activated, seemingly content to trap him here.</p><p>Li Hou swung his claws repeatedly, leaving streaks of afterimages in the void. In an instant, a flurry of claw shadows engulfed Qin Sang.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The claw shadows shattered simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged unscathed, charging forward, seemingly unafraid of being injured by Li Hou.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>Sharp claws left marks on Qin Sang's body, tearing through his bark-like skin, but Qin Sang remained unfazed. Wood spirit energy continuously replenished him. Unless it was a fatal wound, it would hardly affect him.</p><p>His Wood Spirit Body suddenly coiled, and Qin Sang raised his fists, drawing them inwards before smashing them towards Li Hou in the center.</p><p>Li Hou's body was smaller than Qin Sang's fists.  A single collision between the two fists could crush him into a pulp.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>A muffled sound suddenly emanated from Qin Sang's body as a bone spike silently approached his abdomen.</p><p>Li Hou, unwilling to give up, launched another bone spike, choosing an extremely cunning timing and angle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the result was the same. No matter how concealed or cunning the bone spike was, its trajectory couldn't escape the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's gaze. Qin Sang only needed to manipulate the True Treasure fragment according to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's guidance to block it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The fists collided, striking empty air.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't pause, striding forward with the momentum of a landslide, countless ancient trees being shattered by his passage. His eyes were fixed solely on Li Hou.</p><p>Since ascending to the Profound Insight stage, Li Hou had never been reduced to such a state. Anger surged within him as he suddenly let out a sharp shriek towards the sky, abandoning his evasive stance.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang wasn't alarmed, but rather delighted. He straightened his upper body, refusing to back down.</p><p>In an instant, man and beast clashed fiercely.</p><p>This battle was even more intense than before, the starlight from the myriad stars converging on the battlefield.</p><p>The surrounding trees had long been torn to shreds by the chaotic and powerful forces. Man and beast engaged in the purest form of combat.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to remain rooted in place.  Within the void, badger shadows and fist shadows flickered at incredible speeds, clinging to each other like shadows.</p><p>It was impossible to distinguish which were real and which were illusory.</p><p>*Bang, bang, bang...*</p><p>The sounds of impact were like falling raindrops.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang had endured countless claw strikes and bone spike attacks.</p><p>This wasn't enough.</p><p>Li Hou summoned the Xun Earth Demon Lightning, thunderballs continuously descending, exploding upon Qin Sang's body. Intense lightning enveloped them, relentlessly bombarding Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang endured all the attacks, disregarding his own expenditure.  Here, there was an endless supply of wood spirit energy, allowing him to constantly activate the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal.</p><p>Fatal attacks were blocked by the True Treasure fragment, while other attacks, even if they managed to injure his Wood Spirit Body, would quickly regenerate.</p><p>Li Hou felt a growing sense of unease.</p><p>The bone spikes, refined by him over many years, not only served as hidden weapons but also possessed powerful and诡异 abilities. However, this was predicated on being able to injure the enemy. Failing to penetrate the True Treasure fragment rendered them useless.</p><p>What was even more unbelievable to Li Hou was that Qin Sang, despite absorbing an unknown amount of wood spirit energy, still showed no signs of qi and blood disorder.</p><p>His foundation was exceptionally stable, as if he had merged with this jungle, never weakening. This defied Li Hou's understanding, defying all logic!</p><p>If this continued, he would be the first to exhaust himself!</p><p>Li Hou couldn't have imagined that one day he would be worn down by a cultivator of lower realm.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Perhaps due to distraction, Li Hou was struck by a fist, his body sent flying like a ball.</p><p>Qin Sang activated Lightning Escape, pursuing closely.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Hou merged with the earth, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>The Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation wasn't suspended in the air, as Qin Sang also needed to stand on the ground. This gave Li Hou the opportunity to use Earth Escape. However, Qin Sang wasn't surprised by this and abruptly vanished.</p><p>The ancient trees here had intertwined roots, and sword intent permeated the earth. How could Earth Escape escape his perception?</p><p>In the next moment, a distant ancient tree withered with a loud rumble. The ground suddenly exploded, roots and soil scattering as a small badger shadow flew out.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the ground almost simultaneously, shouldering a massive chunk of earth and two towering trees. With a shrug, he flung the debris away, lunging forward, continuing his fierce assault on the badger shadow.</p><p>Unexpectedly, more than one badger shadow emerged from the ground.</p><p>The surrounding earth collapsed simultaneously, forming over a dozen large craters.  A badger shadow leaped out of each crater.</p><p>These badger shadows weren't illusions, but real entities, their auras identical to Li Hou's true body. They rushed towards the sky, vying with each other.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother shifting his gaze, ignoring the other badger shadows, fixated on the Li Wind Badger before him, convinced that this was Li Hou's true body.</p><p>Li Hou tried twice more, only to discover that his carefully cultivated technique had failed, completely unable to confuse Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>He was instantly filled with both shock and rage, ceasing these futile attempts. While he still had strength, he attempted to break the formation.</p><p>Unfortunately, under Qin Sang's relentless harassment, his path to breaking the formation wasn't smooth.</p><p>Qin Sang divided his attention, channeling both true essence and qi and blood, continuously attacking Li Hou. Even if Li Hou managed to make progress with his techniques, he could immediately alter the formation, forcing Li Hou to rely on deciphering the formation's patterns to find a way out, a process that would inevitably take a long time.</p><p>After numerous fruitless attempts, Li Hou suddenly emitted a piercing shriek, his eyes turning crimson red.</p><p>Qin Sang then witnessed an astonishing sight. Li Hou's fur also turned blood-red, his claws dripping with fresh blood.  His blood-red fur danced wildly, his aura reaching a peak of frenzy.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he were facing a great demon of the late Divine Transformation stage, his heart involuntarily tightening.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The blood-red badger appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>Only then did the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's warning arrive.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A blood-red claw lashed out, leaving a crimson claw mark in the void.</p><p>Before the blood claw even struck Qin Sang, he sensed a strange fluctuation from the claw mark.</p><p>Then, the qi and blood within his body began to churn.</p><p>For a body cultivator, the consequences of agitated qi and blood were extremely severe. Qin Sang already felt a sense of sluggishness when casting the Seven Teacher Buddhist Seals.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang also felt a stinging pain.  The blood claw seemed capable of injuring him through his layers of defense.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled. The spiritual light on his body dimmed as layers of demonic fire surged forth, instantly forming a fiery shield, enveloping his entire body.</p><p>Since completely refining the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, Qin Sang could activate it using only his divine sense, without expending true essence.</p><p>However, he was refining the Qilin Origin Seed and dared not move his divine sense lightly, limiting his use of the demonic fire.</p><p>But, if he integrated the demonic fire into the Mani Pearl, activating a罡 fiery shield, it would primarily consume true essence, requiring far less divine sense.</p><p>By retracting the Mani Pearl before his divine sense reached its limit, there would be no adverse effects.</p><p>Enveloped in flames, separating his inner and outer self, his condition indeed improved, his body returning to normal.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The blood claw pierced into the demonic fire.</p><p>At this moment, the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, the Separating and Combining Divine Light, and the罡 Fiery Shield were all active, with the Returning Wind Armor at the ready, and most importantly, his Wood Spirit Body. Qin Sang truly wondered what kind of opponent could possibly injure him!</p><p>Li Hou's eyes widened in disbelief. Qin Sang had actually concealed other defensive treasures.</p><p>*Poof! Poof! Poof!*</p><p>The blood claws lashed out repeatedly.</p><p>Flames flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang, completely enveloped in flames, remained unharmed, enduring all of Li Hou's attacks.</p><p>Li Hou, realizing he couldn't injure Qin Sang, could only imagine his despair. Now, he had only one option left — escape!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Li Hou transformed into a streak of blood light, charging towards the sea of stars.</p><p>Qin Sang, covered in demonic fire, transformed into a bolt of lightning, clinging tightly to Li Hou, giving him no opportunity to escape.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>...</p><p>Man and beast fought from one end of the sea of stars to the other, piercing through the starry sky countless times. Li Hou's aura gradually weakened.</p><p>High above, the sword stars trembled frequently, the sea of stars unable to maintain its stability.</p><p>Gradually, both sides sensed something amiss.  The tremors seemed to be originating from an external source.</p><p>It seemed as if there were other presences outside, and they were engaged in combat!</p><p>Someone was fighting nearby!</p><p>Li Hou, who had already fallen into despair, was overjoyed, charging outwards with reckless abandon.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him coldly, then suddenly transformed into a bolt of lightning, flashing before Li Hou.  A glint of killing intent flashed in his eyes as a fine, hair-like blood needle shot straight towards Li Hou.</p><p>The Heaven Severing Soul-Shaking Divine Needle!</p><p>*Swoosh!*</p><p>The divine needle struck Li Hou's wound, the terrifying poison instantly erupting.</p><p>Even with Li Hou's robust physical body, his eyes glazed over with a grayish-white film, his body stiffening momentarily.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Starlight converged, sword light descending from the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped Li Hou's head with one hand and his body with the other.  His hands crossed, twisting with force.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Bones shattered.</p><p>Sword light pierced through the gap between Qin Sang's fingers.</p><p>Life extinguished!</p>
