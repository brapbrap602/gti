<h1>Chapter 657 Metamorphosis and Natal Gu</h1><p>The fat silkworm ate like a starving ghost reborn.</p><p>A Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was devoured in the blink of an eye, and it smacked its lips, clearly wanting more.</p><p>After all the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits were picked, the tree completed its mission, withering at a speed visible to the naked eye. Its branches and leaves turned yellow and it finally died.</p><p>This is also why such heavenly treasures are so rare.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if a new Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree would sprout here in the future.</p><p>After swallowing the unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, the fat silkworm burped and returned to Qin Sang's palm, falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to put it back into the insect basket when he suddenly noticed a faint silver glow emanating from the silkworm. The silver light grew brighter and brighter, almost overshadowing its colorful skin.</p><p>Finally, the silver light separated into threads, wrapping around the silkworm and gradually forming a round silver cocoon.</p><p>"Is this metamorphosis?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Can it still metamorphose after eating an unripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit? This little guy is really strange.  It seems like its second metamorphosis. Other spirit insects gain strength comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators after their second metamorphosis. This guy was so weak before, I wonder if it'll become stronger after this."</p><p>Having captured the fat silkworm for so long, Qin Sang not only hadn't figured out what kind of spirit insect it was, but he also couldn't determine its stage of metamorphosis.</p><p>Now, witnessing its cocooning process, he confirmed it was its second metamorphosis.</p><p>After the cocoon was formed, the fat silkworm slept soundly inside, completely still.  Qin Sang didn't know how long the metamorphosis would take, so he put it back into the insect basket and waited for it to emerge on its own.</p><p>Taking one last look at the withered Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree, Qin Sang erased his traces and left Black Wind Valley.</p><p>Not only here, but Qin Sang also spent several days erasing the traces he had left behind, so as to avoid being tracked by the Li Wu Palace.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang returned to the Five Insects Sect and patiently waited for Du Han's arrival.</p><p>…</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's gate had been destroyed by successive battles. Qin Sang had already made preparations for an ambush. He sat in meditation in a rift valley behind the Five Insects Sect, quietly waiting for Du Han's appearance.</p><p>At this moment, the Flying Night Devil was not by his side.</p><p>A beautiful butterfly danced around his fingertip.</p><p>Qin Sang had decided to choose the Skyeye Butterfly as his Natal Gu and would now begin the blood refinement process.</p><p>After killing Du Han, Qin Sang would likely head to the human territories to investigate the secrets of the Seven Kills Hall. He wouldn't be staying in the Wu Shen Continent for much longer.</p><p>Even if he stayed, he might not find a better Gu than the Skyeye Butterfly after spending several more years searching.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly could already satisfy his two most important needs, so there was no need to be greedy. The sooner he refined his Natal Gu, the sooner he could nurture it and begin his third transformation.</p><p>Unlike spirit insects that willingly submit to a master, a spirit insect refined into a Natal Gu would revert to its larval stage and then slowly grow stronger.</p><p>Nurturing a Natal Gu is a long process.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly landed on Qin Sang's finger.  There was an inexplicable restraint; no matter how it struggled, it couldn't break free and regain its freedom.</p><p>Under the sunlight, the Skyeye Butterfly shone with breathtaking beauty.</p><p>The ruined Five Insects Sect seemed somewhat enhanced by the presence of this beautiful butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled every detail of the Natal Gu refinement process.  Finally, he controlled the Skyeye Butterfly to fly to his palm and cautiously extended a wisp of divine sense, invading the butterfly's body.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang cut his fingertip, forcing out a drop of blood essence. Then, he used the blood refinement restriction to activate the blood essence.</p><p>The crimson blood essence, guided by the blood refinement restriction, separated into countless fine threads, weaving a dense, bright red blood net in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The size of the blood net was just enough to cover the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang controlled the blood net and slowly moved it towards the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>If he had chosen a larval egg as his Natal Gu, he wouldn't need to be so careful. But the Skyeye Butterfly was different; it already had its own consciousness and would resist fiercely. Qin Sang had to be careful to avoid injuring it.</p><p>As the blood net drew closer, the Skyeye Butterfly sensed the danger, its wings fluttering rapidly.</p><p>The blood net lightly covered the Skyeye Butterfly and transformed back into blood, seeping into its body.</p><p>However, this time the blood essence became strange and eerie. It seemed to contain countless mysterious runes, which also invaded the butterfly's body.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's wisp of divine sense felt the Skyeye Butterfly's fear and resistance.  Unfortunately, the difference in their power was too great. Qin Sang remained calm and easily suppressed the butterfly's consciousness.</p><p>Soon, the blood refinement restriction was successfully completed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt a sudden, intimate connection with the Skyeye Butterfly, as if they were linked by blood.</p><p>He had only felt this connection with his Ebony Sword before.</p><p>This was his Natal Gu!</p><p>Without delay, Qin Sang forced out a few more drops of blood, which floated towards the Skyeye Butterfly and transformed into a blood cocoon.  Like the fat silkworm, the Skyeye Butterfly fell asleep inside the blood cocoon.</p><p>However, through their connection, Qin Sang could sense the Skyeye Butterfly's condition.  He only needed to withdraw it into his dantian and nourish it for a few hours before it would emerge from the cocoon, truly becoming his Natal Gu!</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the butterfly into his dantian.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was now very fragile, like a newborn butterfly, and needed careful care.</p><p>Several hours passed by unnoticed.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly emerged from its cocoon and was released by Qin Sang.</p><p>The butterfly itself hadn't changed much, only becoming slightly smaller, and the colors of its wings and patterns had faded a bit. In addition, a faint bloodline appeared on the edges of its wings, adding a touch of eerie beauty.</p><p>However, the Skyeye Butterfly's behavior had changed dramatically.</p><p>It danced around Qin Sang, conveying a feeling of immense joy and closeness, as if it regarded him as its closest and most trusted relative.</p><p>Sensing the emotions conveyed by the Skyeye Butterfly, Qin Sang smiled slightly, extended his finger, and gently touched the butterfly.  He took out a berry, squeezed out its juice, and let the butterfly feed.</p><p>Before the second transformation, feeding it with ordinary spirit fruits was sufficient.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang had prepared the best spirit fruits. Combined with his blood essence nourishment and Golden Core cultivation, the Skyeye Butterfly would be able to undergo its second metamorphosis in just a few years.</p><p>After the second transformation, he would need to find several unique spirit herbs to feed the Skyeye Butterfly, which would greatly increase its growth rate.</p><p>After eating the spirit fruit, the Skyeye Butterfly was withdrawn into Qin Sang's Qi Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Days turned into nights.</p><p>More than ten days passed by unnoticed.</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionless in the silent Five Insects Sect. For several days, he hadn't moved, only feeding the Skyeye Butterfly and cultivating.</p><p>This morning.</p><p>The rising sun cast its golden rays.</p><p>The mountains were silent. Qin Sang's ears twitched slightly, and he suddenly opened his eyes. His figure flickered and vanished into thin air.</p><p>He concealed himself and appeared on the mountaintop, looking towards the west of the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>In the distant sky, a golden speck was flying towards him at an astonishing speed.  It was clearly a flying artifact, heading straight for the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>Only a Core Formation cultivator could achieve such speed.</p><p>Du Han had arrived!</p>
