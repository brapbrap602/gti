<h1>Chapter 691: The Witchcraft Uprising</h1><p>Qin Sang flew for several days, not returning to the Floating Beard Sea, but continuously changing direction, entering the depths of the Demon Sea. He originally intended to find a place to hide.</p><p>Unexpectedly, along the way, Qin Sang encountered more than once cultivators returning from the Demon Sea, all in a hurry, which made him change his mind.</p><p>……</p><p>A lush, uninhabited island.</p><p>Many ancient trees grew on the island, some of which were so thick that it would take more than a dozen people to encircle them. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy here was poor, such beautiful scenery was not suitable for a cave dwelling.</p><p>The shadows of the trees danced, and the tide gently lapped against the reefs.</p><p>Everything seemed normal on the island, but now there were a few more figures.</p><p>These people sat around two others, holding spirit stones, and meditating.</p><p>The two in the center were both Core Formation cultivators, while the others were of much lower cultivation, merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Around them, there was a spirit-gathering formation temporarily set up with spirit stones, and outside the spirit-gathering formation, there were more than a dozen earth-yellow formation flags.</p><p>The formation flags formed an illusion formation, which seemed quite powerful. From outside the illusion formation, this place looked like a patch of wasteland. Unless someone landed nearby and searched carefully, it would be impossible to discover anything unusual.</p><p>At this moment, the two people in the middle woke up from their meditation one after another. They looked at the disciples meditating around them and did not rush to wake them up, but instead communicated through voice transmission.</p><p>“I didn't expect the conflict between the two races to spread from the Inner Sea to the Demon Sea. The Island Master actually chose to stay out of it. We had just left for a few days when the Island Master decided to seal the island.  If I had known this, I wouldn't have left. What a wasted trip."</p><p>One of them sighed, his tone somewhat resentful.</p><p>The other person said suspiciously, "Senior Brother, is it really necessary for us to rush back to Allrock Island? Even if the two races really start an all-out war, it's impossible for it to affect the situation in the Demon Sea so quickly, right? We've been preparing for so long, bringing our disciples out. It shouldn't be too late to return after hunting the demonic beasts."</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhao, when you urgently came to deliver the message, you wanted to ask me why I decided to return immediately, right?"</p><p>The man who was called Senior Brother shook his head and said, "What I'm worried about is not the conflict between the two races, but those who are trying to take advantage of the chaos. Before, with the Island Master's authority suppressing all sides, no one dared to act rashly. Now that the Island Master has suddenly announced the sealing of the island and is ignoring matters outside the island, you can imagine how chaotic it will become in the future. Both of us are only at the early stage of Core Formation, and we also have so many disciples. If we don't return as soon as possible, I'm afraid it will be difficult later.  Who knows how long this conflict between the two races will last. Legend has it that thousands of years ago, there was a war between the two races that lasted for hundreds of years. What if we are trapped in the depths of the Demon Sea and run out of supplies? What will we do then?"</p><p>Junior Brother's expression changed slightly, "Senior Brother, are you saying that the cultivators of the two races in the Demon Sea will also hunt each other down?"</p><p>"He who starts a conflict will have no descendants?"</p><p>Senior Brother sighed, "Without the instruction of the Nascent Soul cultivators of the two races, how could the Inner Sea have erupted into such chaos? How could the cultivators of the Demon Sea be truly separated from the Inner Sea? If this turmoil is not quelled soon, the cultivators in the Demon Sea will definitely not be able to stay out of it, especially now that the Demon Sea has been affected. In addition to the Witch Clan, the rogue cultivators of the Human Clan will definitely take advantage of the chaos, killing and looting everywhere. It will definitely be a mess. Under these circumstances, our only choice is to hide in Allrock Island. With a Nascent Soul cultivator in charge, at least the probability of surviving this chaos will be greater."</p><p>After listening to Senior Brother's words, Junior Brother was completely convinced, "Senior Brother, you've thought it through. I thought things were too simple..."</p><p>Senior Brother hummed in agreement, "The last conflict between the two races was a long time ago, even our Master didn't experience it. It's normal that Junior Brother didn't think of it. Alas! There's a saying among mortals - it's better to be a dog in times of peace than a man in times of chaos. Aren't we cultivators the same? I just hope this chaos will end soon..."</p><p>As he was speaking, the Senior Brother suddenly sensed something. His gaze changed drastically, and he abruptly stood up, summoning his magical weapon and pointing it directly outside the formation, shouting, "Who's there!"</p><p>Junior Brother also reacted immediately.</p><p>The two stood side by side, staring coldly outside the formation.</p><p>The illusion formation they had set up had actually been discovered, and someone was approaching. The two were extremely shocked and angry.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, don't be alarmed. This old man has no ill intentions, I just intend to ask a few questions..."</p><p>A gentle voice came from outside, and then a masked person appeared openly outside the illusion formation, spreading his hands to express goodwill.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang, who had changed his attire. He had accidentally discovered that there were only two early Core Formation cultivators in this group, so he decided to inquire about some information from them.</p><p>"A Human Daoist?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and discovering that he was only at the early Core Formation stage, the two men's expressions softened slightly, but they were still very vigilant, because there were also many rogue cultivators who killed and looted in the Demon Sea, and they were all very good at disguising themselves.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what questions do you want to ask? Why be so sneaky?" The Senior Brother snorted coldly, his tone unfriendly.</p><p>"If I didn't do this, you two wouldn't let me approach, would you? No need to look, it's really just me. If I really had malicious intentions, would I alert you like this?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, then said in a deep voice, "I can exchange a top-grade magical weapon for this information. I'll leave after I ask, and I won't disturb you two. I've been cultivating in the Demon Sea for a while, and I was planning to return to Allrock Island for supplies, but I suddenly noticed that the atmosphere was a bit off. Seeing you two also hurrying back... What exactly happened?"</p><p>The two looked at each other, and the Senior Brother hesitated for a moment before asking in return, "How many years has Fellow Daoist been out hunting demonic beasts?"</p><p>"It's been about seven or eight years."</p><p>Qin Sang lied about the time.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist has been hunting demonic beasts alone in the Demon Sea for so long?"</p><p>The Senior Brother exclaimed softly, his eyes looking somewhat strange. "No wonder Fellow Daoist is unaware. There have indeed been many changes in the past two years, starting from the Inner Sea. Three years ago, the Witch Clan suddenly launched an attack without warning. We don't know the reason, but there has already been a great battle in the Inner Sea. We thought it wouldn't spread to the Demon Sea so quickly, but unexpectedly, not long after we left the island, our disciples sent a message saying that the Island Master decided to seal the island and not interfere in matters outside the island..."</p><p>Hearing the two of them talk about the reason, a strange expression appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>The war between the two races had actually really happened!</p><p>When the forces of Rippleport fled, some people ridiculed them for being timid, but they didn't know that it was this vigilance that saved their lives. He wondered what had become of the Human cultivators who had remained in Rippleport.</p><p>The Witch Clan had always been the weaker side. After their Nascent Soul cultivators collectively disappeared, they returned and launched an attack on the Human Clan. Could it be that they had obtained some treasure and were confident in defeating the Human Clan?</p><p>Now it seemed that coming to the Demon Sea early was the right choice. If he had stayed in the Inner Sea, he wouldn't have been able to stay out of the chaos once it started.</p><p>He didn't trust the瓊宇 Trading Company and had never told Ran Luo and the others his location. The conflict between the two races had been going on for two years, and he had only just found out about it.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang asked a few more questions.</p><p>These questions were common knowledge to the people of Allrock Island, and the two had nothing to hide, so they answered them one by one.</p>
