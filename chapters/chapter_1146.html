<h1>Chapter 1138: The Moonlight Demon King</h1><p>The Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Since Qin Sang arrived, the area had remained tranquil, with no significant events occurring. Qin Sang occupied the former cave dwelling of the wandering cultivator, located within the basin, a wooden palace built amidst towering ancient trees. Being in the demon realm, everything Qin Sang saw gave him a sense of novelty.</p><p>In the early morning, the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea was fresh with the scent of grass and trees. Above the basin, a layer of mist seemed to float, but it was actually the manifestation of a spiritual formation, which did not hinder the sunlight from shining through.</p><p>At the edge of the basin, a guard composed of demon beasts and plant spirits diligently protected the demon king's cave dwelling, guarding against any intruders. Since Qin Sang's arrival, the security had become even tighter.</p><p>The old macaque even took the trouble to personally oversee the entrance of the basin.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp cry shattered the peace.</p><p>"Chirp, chirp..."</p><p>From the canyon, the screams of demon monkeys echoed one after another. They were sounding the alarm—an outsider had appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the old macaque was sitting cross-legged on a large boulder at the top of the cliff, resembling a cultivator, with his eyes closed, facing the rising sun, absorbing the purple energy, and practicing his breathing techniques.</p><p>Hearing the cries, the old macaque suddenly stood up, a glint of light flashing in his eyes. With a low roar, he leaped down from the boulder, transforming into a gust of demonic wind, and swept to the entrance of the canyon.</p><p>There, a man in feathered robes stood before the canyon. Beside him was a white-tailed black fox, its eyes darting around, appearing extremely shrewd.</p><p>The man in feathered robes looked no different from a human. The demon guards, when faced with this person, all cowered, their expressions filled with deep fear, not daring to approach in the slightest.</p><p>This was enough to prove the man's identity.</p><p>"Demon King Lihong!"</p><p>Seeing this person, the old macaque's heart trembled. He waved his hand to dismiss the lesser demons and respectfully stepped forward to bow, saying, "This old monkey pays his respects to Demon King Lihong. The young ones have been rude. Please forgive them, Your Majesty."</p><p>"They are merely fulfilling their duties. What fault is there?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong smiled, not at all offended, and spoke kindly, "It has been many years since I last visited the Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea. Is Senior Bamboo currently in his cave dwelling? I have important matters to discuss."</p><p>The old macaque's expression remained unchanged as he replied, "Reporting to Your Majesty, our great king is currently in seclusion. I do not know if he will emerge today. This old monkey will report to him immediately. Please wait a moment, Your Majesty."</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>The white-tailed black fox roared angrily, "Our great king has come under the orders of Demon King Yu to deliver a command! How dare you make us wait in this desolate wilderness?"</p><p>"Do not be rude!"</p><p>The man in feathered robes glared at the white-tailed black fox and looked around, "The Thousand Peaks Bamboo Sea is indeed as beautiful as they say. It is no trouble to wait. You may go."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The old macaque bowed and turned to leave.</p><p>Watching the old macaque's retreating figure, the man in feathered robes' eyes flickered, and he turned to gaze at the lush bamboo sea, seemingly truly captivated by the scenery.</p><p>Not long after, the old macaque returned.</p><p>"The great king has invited you..."</p><p>Demon King Lihong and the white-tailed black fox followed the old macaque into the basin. The white-tailed black fox craned its neck, looking around everywhere.</p><p>The old macaque ignored it and led them into the reception hall.</p><p>In the hall, there was a figure, but it was not the person they had hoped to see. Instead, it was the spirit of a willow tree.</p><p>"Greetings, Demon King Lihong."</p><p>The willow tree spirit also did not dare to show any neglect.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong frowned, displeased, "Where is Senior Bamboo?"</p><p>"The great king is in seclusion, at a critical moment in his cultivation, and cannot appear. He has ordered this junior..."</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the white-tailed fox leaped out, pointing at the willow tree spirit and cursing, "How dare you! Even if Senior Bamboo is in seclusion, surely he can spare a moment? I think you are falsely conveying orders! A mere willow spirit dares to block our great king from meeting Senior Bamboo? If something goes wrong, can you bear the responsibility?"</p><p>Being rudely pointed at, the willow tree spirit's expression stiffened.</p><p>But Demon King Lihong stood there without saying a word, clearly condoning the white-tailed fox's behavior.</p><p>The willow tree spirit sighed lightly, "If Your Majesty does not believe me, this junior can only report again..."</p><p>"No need..."</p><p>Suddenly, a deep voice came from behind the hall, carrying a faint but undeniable pressure, "I have been remiss in not welcoming you, Demon King Lihong. I hope you will forgive me."</p><p>Feeling this terrifying pressure, the white-tailed fox's eyes showed fear, and it quickly retracted its head, its previous arrogance completely gone.</p><p>Demon King Lihong's gaze sharpened as he scanned the hall. Though he saw no one, he did not dare to be negligent. He cupped his hands toward the void and said, "Lihong pays his respects to Senior Bamboo. It has been many years. I hope you are well."</p><p>"Not so well."</p><p>The voice sighed lightly, "The last time you came, I had already made a mistake in my cultivation and was forced into seclusion. To this day, I have not found a way to completely resolve the hidden dangers, so I cannot leave my cave dwelling at will. Since you have come under Demon King Yu's orders, is it about mobilizing troops again? I have already ordered my subordinates to train diligently. How many more do you need this time?"</p><p>Demon King Lihong replied, "Reporting to Senior, Lihong has come this time, firstly, indeed to mobilize troops. The Sin Abyss has risen again, and this battle may be extremely fierce. The humans have been urging us repeatedly. Secondly, there is another matter of great importance..."</p><p>"Oh? What could be more important than mobilizing troops?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Demon King Lihong hesitated, "Before leaving, Demon King Yu instructed me that this matter is of utmost importance and must be delivered directly into your hands, not through lesser demons, to avoid any mishaps. Here, perhaps..."</p><p>He glanced at the willow tree spirit standing by, his meaning clear.</p><p>"I have already said that my cultivation has gone awry, and I cannot leave seclusion. Did Demon King Yu really say that he must see me in person and that the willow spirit cannot deliver it?"</p><p>The voice was low, clearly tinged with dissatisfaction.</p><p>Even Demon King Lihong felt the pressure.</p><p>He nodded stiffly, "Indeed, this matter concerns the fate of the Heavenly Demon Ridge and all the demon kings. Those juniors are not qualified to participate and might only cause panic."</p><p>"Concerning the fate of the demon kings? So serious?"</p><p>A chuckle came from the void, "Since a demon king must be present... Moonlight, chaos is approaching, and matters have come to this. There is no need for you to hide any longer. Come out and meet Demon King Lihong."</p><p>At these words, Demon King Lihong looked up in surprise.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>A response came from the back hall, and then a figure pushed open the door and walked in. He stood before Demon King Lihong, smiled faintly, cupped his hands in greeting, and said calmly, "Demon King Lihong, this must be our first meeting. My humble name is Moonlight."</p><p>Demon King Lihong was stunned.</p><p>He had intended to use Demon King Yu's authority to test the waters and force Senior Bamboo to appear.</p><p>But instead of Senior Bamboo, a stranger had emerged.</p><p>This person had a pair of cyan wings on his back, his demonic aura was extremely pure, and he carried the unique fluctuations and pressure of a demon king. Clearly, he was a transformed great demon.</p><p>And one that Demon King Lihong had never seen before—a completely unfamiliar great demon!</p><p>Then, the voice from the void spoke again, "Lihong, Moonlight is my disciple. He is now also a transformed demon king and is qualified to discuss matters with you. From now on, Moonlight will take charge..."</p>
