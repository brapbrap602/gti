<h1>Chapter 285: The Winds Rise</h1><p>At this moment, surrounded by the same ethereal green mist in every direction, with no discernible exit, everyone looked to Yu Kong, hoping his experience could quickly find a way to break the formation.</p><p>“The wind is picking up,” Qin Sang suddenly said, having been carefully observing their surroundings.</p><p>Everyone paused, following Qin Sang's gaze.  They saw the green mist below begin to stir.</p><p>Like a calm lake surface ruffled by a gentle breeze, ripples spread through the mist, as if currents were flowing deep within.  As the waves advanced layer by layer, this change began to spread to other areas.</p><p>At this time, everyone also keenly felt a light breeze caress their faces.</p><p>But then, the wind suddenly intensified.</p><p>In an instant, the calm was completely shattered.</p><p>A strong wind, a gale, a storm…</p><p>Caught in the wind, the green mist danced.  It became a tangible force, coalescing into swirling vortexes of varying sizes within Qin Sang's and the others' field of vision.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were immediately surrounded by countless swirling masses of mist, truly feeling its power.</p><p>The mist above seemed ethereal, yet it carried an intense heat, like blazing flames. The mist rising from below was a chilling, biting wind, while the mist around them was as sharp as blades.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly channeled their spiritual energy to protect themselves, shattering the nearest vortexes.</p><p>However, they discovered that the other vortexes seemed to have eyes, moving towards them. As they moved, they merged with each other, growing larger and their power increasing visibly.</p><p>Everyone could feel the increasing difficulty of dispersing the mist. If this continued, they would surely be consumed if they didn't escape the formation quickly.</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone became anxious, but they still couldn't find the exit.</p><p>Just then, Xiu Zhirui suddenly pointed ahead, shouting with delight,</p><p>“Look there!”</p><p>The Xiu sisters, working together to resist the encroaching mist, were less strained than the others.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction she indicated and saw something unusual.  At the farthest point of their vision, high in the air, a dark, swirling tunnel stood amidst the roiling mist, made visible only by the coalescing vortexes.</p><p>“That should be the exit,” Yu Kong said, pointing to the swirling tunnel.  "Let's go!"</p><p>Elder Mu Teng said grimly, “Fellow Daoist Yu, rushing over without carefully observing the changes in the formation might be unwise. What if this wind tunnel is a mere illusion, a trap? Or perhaps we’ll struggle to reach it, only to have it shift elsewhere. Wouldn’t that be a waste of effort?”</p><p>Everyone agreed, their faces showing hesitation.</p><p>Seeing this, Yu Kong explained loudly,</p><p>“Don’t worry. If this formation were controlled by someone, it would indeed change unpredictably as Fellow Daoist Mu Teng suggested, and with our cultivation levels, we would certainly perish.</p><p>However, the master of this cave dwelling is deceased, and the formation is unmanned. Moreover, it is in a weakened state, its operation sluggish. It won't exhibit such complex changes.</p><p>If the tunnel is the exit, it's unlikely to move elsewhere in a short time.  Even if it's an illusion, by approaching it, we should quickly discover the true exit's location.</p><p>Although the formation is powerful, after years of wear, it's no longer an inescapable death trap.  Those who enter have at least an eighty percent chance of safely reaching the cave dwelling, especially with so many of us.</p><p>As long as we find the exit, escaping won't be difficult.  Hesitation will only lead to unforeseen complications and disrupt our focus.”</p><p>Ultimately, everyone chose to trust Yu Kong. Maintaining their Guiyuan Formation, they flew towards the tunnel.</p><p>Yu Kong summoned his Qi blades to clear the path, forcefully cleaving through the swirling vortexes blocking their way, heading straight for the tunnel at a considerable speed.</p><p>As they drew closer to the tunnel, the surrounding vortexes became denser. Waves of tangible green mist struck them, colliding with their bodies with increasing force.</p><p>Their bodies trembled as they struggled forward.  Suddenly, Yu Kong waved his hand, releasing the spiritual energy concentrated at the formation's core.  It transformed into a milky white barrier, enveloping them.</p><p>The green mist struck the barrier, causing ripples to spread across its surface. The barrier trembled violently, but it held.</p><p>Shielded by the barrier, the pressure on everyone lessened significantly.  They breathed a sigh of relief, but immediately tensed again as the barrier's fluctuations grew more violent, seeming on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Without needing Yu Kong's prompting, everyone knew what to do. They hurriedly poured their spiritual energy into the formation's core, striving to maintain the barrier for as long as possible.</p><p>Without the Qi blades clearing the path, their speed drastically decreased, but they were now close to the tunnel.  They were certain now: the tunnel was the exit.</p><p>Yu Kong hadn't lied to them. Before the low point of the formation's cycle ended, there wouldn't be any drastic changes, and the Wind Tunnel showed no signs of shifting. Dawn was within their grasp; they just needed to hold on a little longer to escape the formation!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt something was amiss with the wind gusts swirling towards them.  Then Yu Kong's urgent shout reached his ears: "Careful!"</p><p>Before the words fully registered, the immense force battering against their protective barrier vanished abruptly.</p><p>In the next instant, an incredibly powerful suction erupted from those wind gusts!</p><p>This shift was sudden and without warning.  The barrier, ripped apart by the intense suction, offered no protection, leaving everyone exposed.</p><p>Wu Chen, at the front, was immediately pulled away by a tendril of the force, the formation crumbling around them.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, Wu Chen whipped his treasured fan. Several sword beams burst forth, severing the suction's hold. Using the momentum, he pierced through a wind gust and, without a backward glance, lunged towards the Wind Tunnel.</p><p>Prepared for such an eventuality, Qin Sang instantly transformed into a streak of sword light, slicing through two tendrils of suction that wrapped around him. He followed the path Wu Chen had forged, flying forward.</p><p>In a flash, everyone broke free from the formation, each fighting their own way through.</p><p>Just then, Yan Wu, at the edge of the formation, cried out in alarm.  He had been the slowest to react, failing to respond in time as the formation disintegrated. By the time he tried to move, it was too late.</p><p>Seven or eight wind gusts swarmed him, encircling him completely. They were already mere inches away.  He barely managed to summon a magical artifact before it was torn to shreds.</p><p>It looked as though Yan Wu was about to be swallowed whole.</p><p>At that moment, everyone was desperately trying to reach the Wind Tunnel, preoccupied with their own survival. Even if they had the strength to spare, they wouldn't risk turning back to save Yan Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly wouldn't. Back in West Desert Town, Yan Wu had provoked him, and after Qin Sang made an example of him, losing him face, Yan Wu had harbored a grudge.</p><p>For nearly a year, Yan Wu had never shown Qin Sang anything but hostility. The rest of the group could clearly see the tension between them, and Qin Sang wasn't about to extend an olive branch.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that if their positions were reversed, Yan Wu wouldn't lift a finger to help him, and would likely take advantage of his predicament.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Yan Wu was about to be consumed by the wind gusts, Yu Kong, the strongest and closest to the Wind Tunnel, stopped abruptly. With a flick of his wrist, a crimson chain shot out from his palm.</p><p>Agile as a serpent, the chain snaked towards Yan Wu, then erupted in a dazzling light, shielding him from several of the incoming forces.</p>
