<h1>Chapter 1668: Relentless Pursuit</h1><p>Realmaster Zi Lei walked upon the Rainbow Bridge, his steps seemingly slow yet covering vast distances with each stride.</p><p>The Rainbow Bridge vanished abruptly.</p><p>The Windsha immediately resurged, the formation barriers restoring themselves.</p><p>Realmaster Zi Lei soared into the boundless void.</p><p>If not for everyone witnessing it with their own eyes, and the formation barriers seemingly affected, with the Windsha's momentum no longer as formidable as before, they would have thought the previous scene was an illusion.</p><p>Even so, the might of the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern, calming the Windsha and breaking the formation barriers, left everyone present deeply shocked and apprehensive.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain's layers of formation barriers, their energies interconnected, meant that although they also had ways to ascend against the Windsha, achieving the ease with which Realmaster Zi Lei reached the summit in one fell swoop was utterly impossible.</p><p>What happened on the mountain?</p><p>The same question arose in everyone's minds.</p><p>In a fleeting glimpse, they saw Realmaster Zi Lei's target seemed to be near the summit, but they couldn't discern the exact location or any specific anomaly.</p><p>They only knew he wasn't heading towards Kun Dao.</p><p>The number of cultivators who ascended Emperor Bestowal Mountain could be counted on one hand, so it wasn't difficult to speculate.</p><p>In this battle for the Medicine Garden, including the enigmatic Kun Dao, most of the major players were present.  Remaining were the two Devil Lords of Heaven's Decree Tower, as well as the whereabouts-unknown Grotesque-Faced Man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>The latter had never appeared, and it was unknown whether they were on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The most likely culprits were Patriarch Zhu and Patriarch Fan.  What had the two Devil Lords done to provoke such a strong reaction from Realmaster Zi Lei?</p><p>For a time, everyone overtly and covertly observed Realmaster He Gao.</p><p>Judging by Realmaster He Gao's expression, he was clearly also somewhat surprised, but he definitely knew something, his expression quickly returning to normal.</p><p>However, some were not concerned with this, uninterested in these matters.</p><p>Qin Sang was one of them.</p><p>He had never been too close to the Medicine Garden, his attention fixed on Kun Dao.  He glanced briefly at the Medicine Garden, spotting several immortal flowers and spiritual trees deep within the earthen slopes.</p><p>Ten Thousand Li Fragrance, Sweet Dew Myriad Petals...</p><p>Names flashed through Qin Sang's mind, recognizing most of them.</p><p>These spiritual medicines surprisingly aligned with Realmaster Zi Lei's earlier assessment.</p><p>"All rare and precious spiritual medicines seldom seen in the outside world!"</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>To say he wasn't tempted would be a lie. The Formless Immortal Sect had been sealed until now, the Medicine Garden opening for the first time. Obtaining even a portion would make this trip worthwhile.</p><p>But priorities mattered, as did the relative value of treasures.</p><p>These spiritual medicines, at most, would save some cultivation time. How could they compare to a tribulation-transcending treasure?</p><p>Of course, if the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit truly existed, Qin Sang would stay. But this was clearly a trap set by Kun Dao using the Medicine Garden's restrictions, a mere illusion.</p><p>If the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit were real, Kun Dao would be insane to use it as bait.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the art of choice.</p><p>Realmaster Zi Lei's sudden departure also instilled a sense of urgency in Qin Sang.</p><p>He knew, despite the assistance of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, it would be difficult to break through the numerous formation barriers within a short timeframe, catch up to Realmaster Zi Lei and the others, and reach the summit.</p><p>If he wanted to contend for the Wordless Jade Tablet, he had to focus on Kun Dao.</p><p>Therefore, after Kun Dao fled, Qin Sang also retreated without hesitation, observing subsequent developments through his Heaven's Eye Divine Ability.</p><p>Another who seemed distracted was the Poison King.</p><p>The hasty glimpse of the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit had ignited his greed. Upon confirming it was another of Kun Dao's traps, the Poison King quickly dismissed his distracting thoughts and remembered his true objective.</p><p>A black thread crawled out of his sleeve, across his fair wrist, and into his palm, swallowing a drop of blood essence.</p><p>The Poison King's face paled slightly.</p><p>Everyone's attention was captivated by Realmaster Zi Lei's actions, and no one noticed the Poison King's unusual behavior.</p><p>The Poison King was repeating his actions at the Jade Gate, using his Gu insect's ability to sense the Jade Beetle's location. With so many top cultivators gathered in one place, this was the perfect opportunity to use his secret technique.</p><p>And due to the proximity, the cost was less than before.</p><p>Completing the secret technique, the Poison King abruptly turned his head, staring directly in the direction of Qin Sang's disappearance. The Gu insect in his palm hissed towards Qin Sang, leaving no room for doubt.</p><p>The Poison King's heart sank, his suspicions confirmed. The Gu King had changed masters!</p><p>He finally located the Gu King, but the Poison King's heart felt heavier.</p><p>Even the Gu King was lost. The Grotesque-Faced Man's fate was imaginable.  Since entering the mountain, this Fire Devil hadn't shown any helpers. Didn't that mean he had the strength to single-handedly eliminate a Grand Cultivator?</p><p>Based on the Poison King's understanding of the Grotesque-Faced Man, with the Gu King tamed, his poison skills and Wood-elemental Divine Abilities were at their peak, making him no weakling among the Grand Cultivators.</p><p>He didn't know if the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was present at the time. If it was a one-against-two situation…</p><p>A chill ran down the Poison King's spine. He shook his head slightly, deeming it impossible, but his apprehension towards Qin Sang didn't diminish in the slightest.</p><p>Of course, with the Myriad Poison Mountain's sacred artifact, this Five Transformations Insect Gu by his side, the Poison King wasn't necessarily afraid of Qin Sang.</p><p>His thoughts racing, the Poison King surprisingly also abandoned the spiritual medicines in the Medicine Garden. With a flicker, he transformed into a seven-colored streak of light, pursuing the trail left by Qin Sang.</p><p>The Poison King's actions attracted the attention of the remaining three.</p><p>Both Mo Xing Dao and Su Zi Nan were greatly surprised. They hadn't heard of any prior animosity between the Poison King and the Fire Devil.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao pondered silently. He had originally intended to join forces with the Fire Devil to teach Su Zi Nan a lesson, but unexpectedly, the other party retreated so decisively, appearing unwilling to be drawn into the chaotic vortex.</p><p>This was a wise move.</p><p>However, this person's disregard for the spiritual medicines in the Medicine Garden, showing no intention of competing for them, was quite intriguing.</p><p>Ultimately, he still needed to ascertain what exactly happened at the summit.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, knowing more, contemplated further.</p><p>Now, he had already provoked two powerful enemies and been warned by the Daoists, his situation precarious, likely no better than Zhu Wu Dao's.  The hope of obtaining his third soul fragment was slim.</p><p>If he couldn't achieve completion, he had to carefully consider how to handle himself after leaving.</p><p>Fortunately, the Eight Scenery Palace had attracted the attention of the world, standing at the forefront, buying him time.</p><p>The most pressing matter was still the current situation. Su Zi Nan's gaze followed the Poison King's escaping light, but his thoughts were on the Fire Devil.</p><p>Was this person led away by the events surrounding Realmaster Zi Lei, or was he targeting Kun Dao?</p><p>The Ice Instrument Divine Disc was undoubtedly in this person's possession.</p><p>This person only acted after Kun Dao appeared, indicating his determination to obtain the Fire Rhinoceros Seal.</p><p>A look of doubt crossed Su Zi Nan's face. In Elder Yan Shan's memories, the Ice Instrument Divine Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Seal served to suppress the Yin and Yang Eyes of the tribulation-transcending formation. They had no connection with each other and wouldn't resonate.</p><p>And the Poison King's actions…</p><p>Su Zi Nan instinctively prepared to move but was surprised to see Realmaster He Gao hadn't pursued Realmaster Zi Lei. He merely glanced towards the summit and headed straight for the depths of the Medicine Garden.</p><p>Realmaster He Gao's movement again captured Mo Xing Dao and Su Zi Nan's attention.</p><p>As the head of the esteemed Eight Scenery Palace, surely they didn't lack spiritual medicines. Was Realmaster He Gao lingering because he had noticed something?</p><p>Leaving aside their various thoughts…</p><p>Qin Sang had already extricated himself from the situation, pursuing Kun Dao.</p><p>Now, he no longer concealed himself, nor could he.  Firmly locking onto Kun Dao's position, practically skimming the edge of the barrier, his Phoenix Wings beat rapidly, his body transforming into a bolt of lightning, relentlessly pursuing.</p><p>Kun Dao had already noticed, constantly changing direction, but even when merging with the barrier, her speed was slower than before, and there was a noticeable sluggishness in her movements, indicating her injuries were not light.</p><p>He had Realmaster Zi Lei to thank for that. The Divine Ability of manifesting sword techniques through lightning was truly formidable. Kun Dao had simultaneously been struck by the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Capturing Six Laws.</p><p>Two immensely powerful yet distinct sword intents invaded her body, wreaking havoc. Moreover, the sword intents clashed with each other, resulting in a fierce confrontation.</p><p>Although their sword intents weren't of the same origin, both were overbearingly powerful and unyielding, making compromise impossible.</p><p>The battlefield was Kun Dao's body.</p><p>This was also partly due to the deliberate actions of Qin Sang and Realmaster Zi Lei.</p><p>Given some time, Kun Dao wouldn't find it difficult to expel the sword intents, but with Qin Sang closely pursuing her, how could she have the opportunity to heal?</p><p>A bolt of lightning weaved through the Windsha.</p><p>There was no one in front of the lightning, but Qin Sang could sense Kun Dao hidden within the barrier, the distance slowly closing.</p><p>Having failed repeatedly and reduced to such a sorry state, a nameless fire raged within Kun Dao's heart.</p><p>She still didn't know how Qin Sang was locking onto her. Her guess was wrong, thinking it was the residual sword intent within her body that Qin Sang could sense.</p><p>She had considered stopping Qin Sang.</p><p>But this wasn't the Five Elements Divine Restriction, and she didn't control the spiritual formation barriers.</p><p>Creating the grand spectacle on the mountain was achieved by utilizing the Wind Formation's Windsha power, using the barrier as a conduit, guiding the force to impact various locations, forcibly activating all formation barriers. It didn't mean she could control them.</p><p>Using the Medicine Garden's protective spiritual formation to set up the trap had taken considerable effort and was somewhat forced, nearly failing at the last moment.</p><p>Knowing this, it would have been better to fail!</p><p>After the various formation barriers were activated, they affected everyone indiscriminately, and Kun Dao also couldn't freely traverse them. Of course, with the barrier as her reliance, she was slightly better off than Qin Sang, able to manipulate parts of it to create obstacles for him.</p><p>The problem was, Qin Sang also had the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Kun Dao's hasty actions meant her techniques weren't precise, which was equivalent to laying her weaknesses bare before the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. How could she stop Qin Sang?</p><p>With minimal results, Kun Dao understood the problem.</p><p>Her only recourse now was to escape back to the Five Elements Divine Restriction or expel the sword intents within her body to shake off Qin Sang.</p><p>With this in mind, Kun Dao plunged headlong towards the Five Elements Divine Restriction, simultaneously doing her utmost to suppress the sword intents within her, expelling those belonging to Qin Sang.</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, she didn't want to abandon this physical body.</p><p>Closely pursuing from behind, Qin Sang gradually sensed Kun Dao's predicament. Everything was unfolding as he had anticipated.</p><p>During the pursuit, with the aid of his Heaven's Eye Divine Ability, Qin Sang finally truly captured Kun Dao's movements!</p><p>Wherever Kun Dao passed, faint ripples would appear on the edge of the barrier.</p><p>The ripples were faint, only discernible with the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability. This was further proof that Kun Dao couldn't perfectly merge with the barrier.</p><p>Kun Dao's escape route revealed her intentions. This was a golden opportunity, and Qin Sang wouldn't let her escape back to the Five Elements Divine Restriction. He swiftly pointed his fingers.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Lightning illuminated the Windsha.</p><p>A bolt of lightning struck the ripples on the barrier.</p><p>This was already the third time Qin Sang had used the Command Lightning Technique on Kun Dao, and the effect was still potent. Because this Divine Ability was controlled by his mind, the lightning arrived instantaneously. Even if the enemy intended to defend, it would require considerable effort.</p><p>Moreover, Kun Dao was currently heavily injured.</p><p>'Sizzle!'</p><p>Lightning threads spread like a spiderweb across the barrier.</p><p>A section of the barrier suddenly bulged, faintly revealing a human silhouette, like a portrait plastered onto the barrier.  Kun Dao, after all, had some defenses. She wasn't directly hit, appearing at the edge of the lightning net.</p><p>The bulge instantly retracted, Kun Dao vanishing in a flash.</p><p>Just then, a streak of white profound energy surged upwards, its momentum like a rainbow.</p><p>A figure had appeared beside Qin Sang unnoticed.  The white energy emanated from its crown, the Profound Heaven Single Qi Grand Capture Hand Divine Ability, specialized in capturing and restraining enemies.</p><p>The white energy surged upwards, manifesting a giant hand. Although it hadn't yet arrived, the restraining force had already sealed the area around its target.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Another resounding boom as the profound energy hand clasped the barrier.</p><p>This attack was unexpected, but since Kun Dao could utilize the barrier's power, how could she be so easily caught? The barrier trembled slightly, dropping countless silken threads.</p><p>Each silken thread resembled a rope, rapidly entwining around the five fingers of the profound energy hand and spreading along the fingers to envelop the entire palm, breaking through the restraining force.</p><p>The profound energy hand indeed faltered, returning without success.</p><p>Unrestrained, the ripples on the barrier churned as Kun Dao prepared to flee.  Below, the resonant clang of a sword rang out. The Gold Sinking Sword flew through the air, and as its light approached, a sword formation unfolded, instantly plunging the area into twilight.</p><p>The sword formation sealed off the entire region, but it couldn't penetrate the barrier's boundary. Yet, Kun Dao's hiding place was right there. This way, it would be difficult to trap her.</p><p>As this thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, he heard Kun Dao scream.</p><p>Sword intent had forced its way into the barrier, triggering Kun Dao's painful memories. Her scream was filled with rage. However, she didn't act rashly. Her body, existing between the tangible and intangible, spread its arms, striving to mobilize all the power she could control within the barrier, converging it at her chest.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see any obvious abnormality, but he felt a sense of danger, his brow furrowing.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The sky churned like turbid waves.</p><p>Astonishing fluctuations crashed down, as if the heavens were enraged.  The sword formation rippled, and the Windsha surrounding Qin Sang was swept away.</p><p>The Windsha only dared to linger at the periphery.</p><p>Kun Dao manipulating the barrier, its power terrifyingly potent, but all within Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Through repeated probes, Qin Sang had discerned that Kun Dao's strength wasn't inherent but derived from external sources. Although she was heavily injured, as long as her ability to manipulate the barrier remained, so did her strength.</p><p>In the Medicine Garden, Kun Dao had left the barrier to ambush Mo Xing Dao. Now, hidden within the barrier, she was like a turtle retreating into its shell.  Unless he could break the barrier or force Kun Dao out, all attacks were like striking a cow across a mountain.</p><p>He snorted coldly, a罡fire shield appearing around him.</p><p>The giant wave crashed down onto the罡fire shield, only causing Qin Sang's figure to sway slightly, unable to stop his upward momentum.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, gazing at the insignificant ripples within the barrier. The Sun God Tree appeared in his palm.  Focusing his mind, the three Firebirds spread their wings and soared, instantly transforming into a fireball that collided with the barrier!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Crimson fire flew, a large section of the barrier dyed red.</p><p>If someone were observing from above, they would see a vast fire domain suddenly emerge on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, like an erupting subterranean fire vein, bursting through a hole in the mountain.</p><p>In fact, any cultivator outside Emperor Bestowal Mountain, as long as they were south of the mountain, could see it.</p><p>The thoughts of cultivators from all sides churned. Extraordinary phenomena repeatedly appeared on Emperor Bestowal Mountain, seemingly indicating a world-shaking battle in progress.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the spectacle was far from over.</p><p>Beside the fire domain, profound ice spread, its deep blue light as dazzling as the firelight.  Even from such a distance, it chilled the heart, undoubtedly possessing immense power.</p><p>This was Qin Sang commanding his avatar to cooperate, unleashing the Four Chariots Azure Serpent Seal.</p><p>Two attacks of spirit treasure caliber, their power terrifying. Even indirectly, they were enough to injure Kun Dao further, exacerbating her already dire situation.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to press his advantage and pursue Kun Dao…</p><p>A voice suddenly came from behind him: "Fellow Daoist, wait…"</p>
