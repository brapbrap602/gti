Chapter 1298: The Turmoil

Yu City.

The battles surrounding the plains had been relentless for years. The Abyss of Sin had been repeatedly pushed to the brink, with powerful enemies reaching the very gates of Yu City. Each time, the defenders had fought to the death, holding the line and repelling the invaders. Since ancient times, Yu City had been a crucial stronghold of the Abyss of Sin, guarding its northern gateway.

After deciding to retreat to Yu City, the Abyss of Sin had made thorough preparations. The city's defenses were impenetrable, a fortress of steel. Yet, at this moment, the cultivators within the city were filled with unease. They followed orders mechanically, their eyes betraying a deep-seated fear and confusion.

Several months ago, the allied forces of the two realms had launched a counterattack. The Abyss of Sin had been forced to retreat, but they were not afraid. They knew that as long as their three great experts remained, the allied forces could only gain the upper hand temporarily. At worst, they would have to return what they had plundered, but the heartland of the Abyss of Sin would remain secure.

Over the years, the Abyss of Sin had nearly conquered half of the Heavenly March Plateau. The cultivators who had survived the battles had amassed fortunes beyond their wildest dreams. They had planned to return home, rest, and consolidate their gains.

But now, everything had changed.

After months of retreat, the withdrawal had finally ended this morning. The armies of the Abyss of Sin had successfully regrouped in Yu City. Though they had lost the plains and suffered heavy losses, their core strength remained intact. Moreover, the Abyss of Sin had reached a truce with the desert factions. The cultivators who had been tied down on the western front had all rushed to Yu City, joining forces to prepare for the impending assault by the allied forces.

The cultivators of the Abyss of Sin were confident. They believed they could hold the allied forces at bay outside the city walls. But no one had anticipated that before the enemy arrived, chaos would erupt within their own ranks—and it began among the Nascent Soul Ancestors!

At the time, the cultivators of the Abyss of Sin were following orders, methodically setting up defenses. Everything seemed normal. These battle-hardened veterans were well-versed in such tasks.

Suddenly, the ground beneath Yu City shook violently.

Then, they witnessed a horrifying scene.

From the inner city palace, the residence of the Nascent Soul Ancestors, streaks of light shot into the sky. Along with them came agonized screams and furious roars. The screams were not from one person but many, each one filled with despair and hatred, as if their souls were being torn apart.

Those who heard the cries felt a chill run down their spines.

What was even more terrifying was that the voices were familiar—they all belonged to Nascent Soul Ancestors.

In the next moment, the streaks of light collided in midair, intertwining in a dazzling yet deadly display. Sharp-eyed observers noticed that within the light were figures—Nascent Soul Ancestors locked in a chaotic battle.

The Nascent Souls of the Abyss of Sin were fighting above Yu City.

Soon, it became clear that this was not a free-for-all but a coordinated attack against a single individual.

The subsequent shouts confirmed their suspicions.

"Old Demon Ye! Have you gone mad?"

"How dare you slaughter so many fellow cultivators!"

"Kill him!"

The Nascent Souls roared in fury.

Hearing these cries, the cultivators of the Abyss of Sin paled, piecing together the truth. Old Demon Ye had massacred Nascent Souls, inciting the wrath of his peers.

How could this be?

In the past, Old Demon Ye had indeed lived up to his title. He was unpredictable, ruthless, and despised by the righteous sects. But after the alliance between the righteous and demonic factions, he had tempered his ways, becoming a respected elder.

Old Demon Ye had often led the charge, and under his guidance, the Abyss of Sin had flourished. Even the righteous sects had begun to view him in a new light.

Had it all been a facade? Had Old Demon Ye been biding his time, waiting for the right moment to strike?

As the cultivators stood in stunned silence, screams continued to echo from the inner city. Each cry marked the fall of a Nascent Soul Ancestor. What terrified them most was that these Nascent Souls seemed unable to escape their fates. Their screams were cut short, and then there was only silence.

Old Demon Ye, though hailed as the strongest in the Northern Star Realm, was not yet a Great Cultivator. Yet, his power was terrifying. In full view of everyone, he had effortlessly slaughtered Nascent Soul cultivators.

The entire city was thrown into chaos.

Finally, the screams ceased.

Old Demon Ye, unable to withstand the combined assault, dared not linger. Transforming into a streak of bloody light, he shot toward the city's outskirts, seemingly on the verge of escaping Yu City.

Canghong Zhenren and others desperately tried to stop him, but Old Demon Ye destroyed the Obsidian Tower, allowing him to slip away unscathed. Of course, they could not let him escape. Canghong Zhenren led a pursuit, leaving behind a contingent to stabilize the city. Otherwise, Yu City would have descended into complete disorder.

The city gates were sealed, and the protective formation activated. The formation took the shape of a massive lotus, its azure light enveloping the entire city.

Three figures hovered in the air, the Nascent Soul Ancestors left behind to maintain order.

The cultivators of the Abyss of Sin obeyed commands, but their faces were blank. Without the three overseeing them, many would have fled the city.

How could they continue to defend the city after such an event?

Everyone wore grave expressions, their spirits crushed, their will to fight extinguished.

Above Yu City, the three Nascent Souls remained visible, bolstering morale.

One of them was an elderly man, his face deeply wrinkled, exuding an aura of decay. He sat cross-legged in midair, motionless. Though he appeared to be meditating, his energy was highly unstable, as if he had suffered severe internal injuries, though no external wounds were visible.

The other two stood on either side of him, guarding him. They issued orders while communicating via sound transmission, their faces still etched with shock and anger.

Finally, the situation in Yu City stabilized.

The two glanced down at the elderly man and were horrified. In just a short time, his wrinkles had deepened, and his energy had weakened further. It seemed as though his vitality was draining away with each passing moment.

The elderly man, once a majestic sect ancestor, had aged rapidly, becoming a frail old man on the verge of death.

Fortunately, his energy had stabilized. Though there were no signs of recovery, it seemed the deterioration had halted.

The two exchanged a glance, then looked in the direction Old Demon Ye had fled, their eyes filled with deep concern.

"Where is Old Demon Ye trying to escape to?"

"Right now, no one can fathom his intentions. It all depends on whether Canghong Zhenren and the others can catch him."

"Canghong Zhenren hasn't returned yet! Though we acted quickly to seal the city gates, we can't be sure if spies from the allied forces have already leaked the news. What if they..."

Before they could finish, the lotus formation outside Yu City trembled violently.

...

Zhenyi Laodao, the elderly Daoist, spoke calmly, "No need to rush." He glanced around as if searching for something, then said, "Follow me!"

In an instant, the group's figures flickered as they followed Zhenyi Laodao, silently flying toward a nearby mountain peak.
