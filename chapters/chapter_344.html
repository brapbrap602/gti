Does he cultivate alone, or with the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect? Can you contact Senior Sister Shi Hong now?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then asked a series of questions in a deep voice.</p><p>Liang Yan might have already broken through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, but Qin Sang wasn't afraid. He not only had six Ten Yama Banners, but also a talisman treasure. Few cultivators of the same realm could rival him.</p><p>Even if Liang Yan also possessed the Ten Yama Banners, the Yin Soul Threads would be unable to harm Qin Sang's Nascent Soul, greatly diminishing their power.</p><p>If he could find Liang Yan, with the element of surprise, it wouldn't be difficult to kill Liang Yan and rescue Senior Sister Shi Hong.</p><p>“Liang Yan killed a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Kuiyin Sect. Fearing exposure, he dared not contact the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect again.  He was also afraid of being found out by the Yuanzhao Sect, so he has been hiding in the shadows, cultivating and rarely showing his face. His whereabouts are erratic, and his cave is extremely hidden, and he changes it frequently.</p><p>“Later, as Liang Yan's cultivation improved, he felt that the situation had calmed down, so he gradually relaxed his vigilance and slowly began to operate in the Yin Mountain Pass and the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>“A few years ago, when Senior Sister Shi Hong and I met, it was at the Wind Cang Market in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>“Over the years, although Senior Sister Shi Hong has gained some of his trust, this trust is very limited. Liang Yan is cunning by nature. Because she was afraid of being detected by Liang Yan, Senior Sister contacted me very rarely.</p><p>“Actually, I've always wanted to lure the Yuanzhao Sect to kill Liang Yan and rescue Senior Sister Shi Hong, but I've never found the opportunity. Doing so would certainly kill Senior Sister as well, even though she…”</p><p>Tan Hao paused, letting out a long sigh.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes, and he snorted, “It's good that we can find Liang Yan! Has Senior Sister Shi Hong ever mentioned what magical artifacts and methods this person is accustomed to using?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. “Liang Yan has two very powerful top-grade magical artifacts. One is called the Black Dragon Stone, which can grow and shrink, weighing a thousand pounds. Most cultivators' bodies are fragile, and a careless moment could result in being crushed into mincemeat by the Black Dragon Stone. The other is the Soul Binding Rope, which can trap opponents, sealing their spiritual power and Qi Sea. The two magical artifacts complement each other perfectly. If he wasn’t afraid of the Yuanzhao Sect, Liang Yan wouldn't act so low-key, and he would definitely have made quite a name for himself in the Yin Mountain Pass.”</p><p>No Yama Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly. This way, he was even more certain of killing Liang Yan.</p><p>It made sense. Although the Yin Sha Abyss had devoured countless lives, refining a Ten Yama Banner wasn't that easy.</p><p>The sacrifices had to be slowly cultivated to the tenth level of the Qi Refining stage. Not to mention the lengthy time required, the Yama King's backlash became increasingly severe, and very few people could withstand the backlash and persevere until the end.</p><p>Sun De’s father was a direct disciple of the Kuiyin Patriarch, and he only helped him gather six banners, barely forming a formation.  He had to find a way to get the rest himself.</p><p>Yue Wu wasn't a direct disciple of Sect Master Yi, so his status was definitely lower than Sun De's father.</p><p>Although Liang Yan had inherited the legacy of two Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators, he might not be able to gather six Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had Tan Hao tell him everything he knew about Liang Yan.</p><p>Killing Liang Yan was certain, but since his whereabouts were erratic, how and where to kill him still required careful consideration.  It would be best to contact Shi Hong first and coordinate from the inside and outside.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had agreed to help and had revealed his true strength, Tan Hao was overjoyed.  He enthusiastically and meticulously told Qin Sang everything he knew about the Yin Mountain Pass to deepen his understanding.</p><p>The two discussed the matter as they returned to the Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>Then they left the Yin Mountain Pass and continued southwest until they reached the edge of the swamp, then entered the Ten Thousand Mountains, arriving at a remote and desolate snow-capped mountain.</p><p>Two figures quietly landed in a secluded valley at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Tan Hao cautiously looked around, moved an inconspicuous stone in the depths of the secluded valley, and revealed a narrow opening.  He explained to Qin Sang with a look of shame.</p><p>“The area outside the swamp isn't under the jurisdiction of the Yin Mountain Pass, and it’s always been very chaotic, with frequent incidents of murder and robbery.</p><p>“The caves controlled by the Yin Mountain Pass are safe, but the rent is too expensive, and I can't afford it.</p><p>“Later, I was lucky enough to discover a small spiritual vein here and carved out a cave. Although the spiritual energy is a bit thin, it’s better than being hidden…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in understanding. Most rogue cultivators were as impoverished as Tan Hao, living a very hard life, constantly striving for cultivation resources.</p><p>After entering, Tan Hao moved the boulder back and carefully erased the traces outside. He hadn't set up any restrictions outside the cave. If the restrictions weren’t strong, they would be superfluous and more likely to be discovered by other cultivators.</p><p>The cave was deep and winding, their footsteps echoing.</p><p>Qin Sang followed behind. After walking for a while, he suddenly heard the sound of running water ahead and felt a hint of warmth.</p><p>At the same time, the spiritual energy became increasingly rich.  Plants that didn't need sunlight grew densely in the crevices of the stones.  The green plants formed a continuous expanse, becoming denser the further in they went, like a green carpet, unexpectedly giving off a sense of spring.</p><p>There was probably a hot spring in the cave. The environment was quite good, but the spiritual energy was indeed rather thin. It was barely enough for Tan Hao's cultivation level.</p><p>A protective spiritual formation appeared at the end. After Tan Hao opened it, a carefully squared-off grotto appeared in Qin Sang’s view.</p><p>The grotto was quite large, with a dozen or so night pearls inlaid in the domed ceiling.  The inside was clean and tidy, with a warm underground river flowing through it.  A section of it happened to cross the grotto.</p><p>Flowers and plants grew on both sides of the underground river. There was only a simple stone bed, presumably where Tan Hao cultivated.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Tan Jie, but he did see a jade coffin floating motionless in the center of the underground river.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart sank. He turned to look at Tan Hao.</p><p>Tan Hao walked softly to the jade coffin, stroked the edges and corners of the coffin, and laughed self-deprecatingly, “Brother Qin, actually, I'm not afraid of death. If I die, Tan Jie won't be far behind me. In the underworld, we brothers can be reunited. By then, his condition will definitely be much, much better than it is now… If there’s a next life, I’ll definitely advise him not to cultivate.”</p><p>Inside the jade coffin, which was filled with some kind of spiritual liquid, lay a person, motionless. It was Tan Jie!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Tan Jie. He still looked young, exactly as Qin Sang remembered, but without his former vitality. His face was pale, without a trace of blood, unlike a living person.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could indeed sense a faint aura within Tan Jie, indicating that he wasn't dead yet. But he seemed no better than a dead man, because his aura was too weak, like a flickering candle in the wind, which could be extinguished at any moment.</p><p>Tan Jie was now a living dead!</p><p>“For so many years…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice was a little hoarse. “Has Brother Tan Jie been like this all along?”</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, sighing faintly, “Yes, for forty years.”</p>
