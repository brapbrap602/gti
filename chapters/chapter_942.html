<h1>Chapter 934:  A Three-pronged Battle</h1><p>Chapter 934:  A Three-pronged Battle</p><p>Qin Sang and his physical manifestation arrived simultaneously.</p><p>Any other cultivator at the Jindan stage would have fared no better than the Fang family youth.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, while the ease in Bai's expression had vanished, he still didn't show much fear.</p><p>"Does he have the confidence to fight both me and my manifestation at once?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Many of his techniques were ineffective against Bai, such as the Blood-Polluting Divine Light.</p><p>Treasures like the Star Conch were also limited in their effectiveness.</p><p>Bai, inhabiting the body of the Flying Night Rakshasa, was a corpse-cultivator who seemed capable of freely leaving his body. Even if the Star Conch could severely injure his physical form, it might not harm his spectral essence.  Furthermore, Bai had controlled the Flying Night Rakshasa for so long that no one knew what changes had occurred; its previous weaknesses might no longer exist.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he poured all his energy into activating the Sword Wheel.</p><p>Blood energy surged from his manifestation, the blood sword seeming to rejoice, erupting in a blinding red light as a several-meter-long crimson sword qi slashed out with a whistling sound.</p><p>The air reeked of blood.</p><p>Bai watched Qin Sang and his manifestation's attack, remaining motionless and exceptionally calm. He raised both arms, attempting to single-handedly combat both of them.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Ghostly claw shadows filled the sky like a black tidal wave, surging towards Qin Sang and his manifestation.</p><p>Having previously tested the power of the ghost claw shadows, Qin Sang and his manifestation hesitated not at all, increasing their true energy.  Their two flying swords hummed, unstoppable.</p><p>The barrier of ghost claw shadows couldn't hold for long; countless shadows were annihilated under the powerful sword qi, retreating steadily.</p><p>Yet Bai showed no sign of anxiety.</p><p>He took a deep breath, his corpse energy boiling, a layer of corpse energy subtly appearing on his surface, accompanied by a strange fluctuation.  Upon closer inspection, the corpse energy was pale white, very similar to the surrounding ghost mist.</p><p>For decades, Bai had been refining this body.</p><p>Before the Flying Night Rakshasa was taken, the corpse energy within him was refined from earth-sunder energy, appearing darker and duller than the ghost mist.</p><p>The sounds of 'bang bang' echoed continuously as the ghost claw shadows were repeatedly shattered by the two flying swords, the barrier becoming increasingly thin.</p><p>At that moment, Bai suddenly shouted, his corpse energy erupting unexpectedly, transforming into grey-white chains that shot into the depths of the surrounding ghost mist.  Strange runes appeared on the chains.</p><p>In an instant, the ghost mist churned violently.</p><p>The heavens changed color.</p><p>The ghost mist was stirred by the corpse energy, frantically surging towards Bai, finally forming a ghost mist hurricane that rapidly took shape around him.</p><p>The ghost mist hurricane swept through the surroundings, causing the bone mountains to collapse and the bones to shatter.</p><p>The startled vengeful spirits raged, but sensing the terrifying aura emanating from the clash, they instinctively felt fear, only daring to circle the periphery, afraid to enter.</p><p>During the previous battle, vengeful spirits had already surrounded the area; their incessant howls seemed to cheer on both sides.</p><p>Now, these and new vengeful spirits were bound by the chains and drawn into the ghost mist hurricane.</p><p>The ghost mist spun wildly, emitting chilling howls, a terrifying spectacle resembling a white torrent that blotted out the sky.</p><p>Bai muttered a few incantations, his eyes gleaming brightly, before making a sudden sweeping gesture.</p><p>With a deafening roar, the ghost mist hurricane suddenly descended, crashing towards Qin Sang and his manifestation. The hurricane was unstoppable, possessing the momentum to crush everything.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded. Bai had somehow used some incredible ability to control the ghost mist and gather the power of the vengeful spirits.</p><p>The pressure from the ghost mist hurricane made his heart tighten.  Without hesitation, he flew backward, simultaneously ordering his manifestation to retreat and temporarily avoid the edge of the storm.</p><p>The hurricane struck, engulfing the Sword Wheel and the crimson sword qi.</p><p>The Sword Wheel was forced to defend itself, the blood sword vibrating frequently, showing signs of being suppressed.</p><p>The next moment, Bai's eyes flickered, and his figure suddenly disappeared, merging into the ghost mist. Ignoring the manifestation, he flickered several times, directly targeting Qin Sang's main body.</p><p>Then, with a violent sweep of his palm, he unleashed the power of the ghost mist, forming a huge grey-white palm that roared towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, his figure retreating as he forcefully flung his wrist, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan piercing through the giant palm and arriving above Bai's head.</p><p>Then, the treasure's light flashed, the double-headed ferocious beast pounced out, creating several illusory images that bared their fangs and claws, rushing towards Bai's face.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The two-headed beast rolled through the air, landing beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Bai, suddenly attacked, was forced to defend, his offensive momentarily faltering. Qin Sang and his avatar seized the opportunity, escaping the Ghostly Gale, retrieving their flying swords, and retreating.</p><p>"You have another spirit beast?"</p><p>Bai was even more surprised, clearly not expecting Qin Sang to be such a formidable opponent.</p><p>His eyes flickered.  Seizing the advantage, he relentlessly unleashed another ghostly gale attack.</p><p>For a time, the two sides fought fiercely.</p><p>The battlefield shifted constantly.  The Ghostly Gale, fueled by vengeful spirits, raged, its swirling mists revealing flashes of red and green light.</p><p>Bai, concealed within the ghostly maelstrom, displayed incredible power, making him almost impossible to strike.</p><p>Qin Sang grew increasingly alarmed.  He, his avatar, and the two-headed beast—the equivalent of three late-stage Golden Core cultivators—were unable to gain any significant advantage.</p><p>"I told you, within this space, you will never overcome me."</p><p>Bai's voice, faint and ethereal, echoed from the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, "Don't play coy!  Controlling the ghost mist and the vengeful spirits must be incredibly taxing.  With your strength, you can't sustain this for long! Moreover, you haven't fully integrated this body!"</p><p>During the battle, Bai's disguise faltered, a momentary lapse revealing a clue to Qin Sang.  The Flying Night Rakshasa's primordial spirit, along with the soul mark Bai had left within it, appeared not to be fully refined.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. He wondered if it was the effect of the Corpse Talisman, or the presence of the jade Buddha's energy within his soul mark.</p><p>During his last visit to the Seven Kills Hall, Bai must have been very weak, even afraid to confront him.</p><p>Now, Bai could fight three powerful enemies. Yet only a few decades had passed; it was entirely possible he hadn't fully refined the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>If the Flying Night Rakshasa's primordial spirit remained, when Bai was weakened, Qin Sang could try to regain control.</p><p>Seeming to have his weak point exposed, Bai remained silent for a moment before saying, "You are indeed perceptive, but can you wait for me to exhaust myself? While I don't know what lies outside, only a few individuals appear every few years, only to depart quickly.  I imagine you can't stay long either, unless you intend to remain trapped here with me."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>The battle continued relentlessly.  Qin Sang, aided by his avatar and the two-headed beast, relentlessly pressed into the heart of the ghostly mist, searching for Bai's true form.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's apparent acquiescence, Bai's spirits rose.  "Since neither of us can defeat the other, let's call a truce and negotiate a deal beneficial to both of us."</p><p>Qin Sang did not reply, a cold smile playing on his lips.  Secretly, he began manipulating his spiritual energy; the sound of wind and thunder echoed faintly within him.</p>
