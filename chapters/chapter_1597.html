<h1>Chapter 1588: Gu Treatise</h1><p>Su Zinan returned to the Crimson South Archipelago. That very night, he led his people away, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>The two openings of the Unforeseen Palace seemed like two farces.</p><p>First, it was the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, then Su Zinan. All of them lost men in the Unforeseen Palace, yet none managed to even penetrate the outer chaotic currents.</p><p>However, what everyone cared about most now was not the Unforeseen Palace.</p><p>The three descendants of Deification stage cultivators, disregarding the dangers, repeatedly challenged the Unforeseen Palace. This, coupled with the final exchange between Su Zinan and Real Master Hegao, added fuel to the already rampant rumors.</p><p>Whether Su Zinan came seeking someone, Qin Sang did not know, but he felt that Su Zinan’s words and actions carried a sense of gleeful chaos.</p><p>Perhaps it was a combination of both.</p><p>As the storm subsided, Qin Sang did not linger in the Crimson South Archipelago for long. He set course back to his home, returning to the Central Plains.</p><p>On the ship.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the cabin with restrictions and retrieved the belongings of the Strange-Faced Man's disciple.</p><p>He had lost control when capturing the disciple alive. He wondered if he could find any clues within these items.</p><p>Besides the Mustard Seed Bag, Qin Sang had also seized the disciple's Spirit Beast Pouch.</p><p>Without much hope, Qin Sang opened the Mustard Seed Bag. The first things that caught his eye were jade bottles of various colors, which he had seen the Strange-Faced Man's disciple use before. They contained all sorts of potent poisons.</p><p>With the Southern Barbarian Two States riddled with miasma, collecting these toxins was not difficult.</p><p>Any single poison had little effect on Nascent Soul cultivators. Only when combined with secret techniques, like the Strange-Faced Man's disciple had done, could they pose a threat.</p><p>Unfortunately for the disciple, he had encountered Qin Sang. The Fat Silkworm had enjoyed a hearty meal and was now sound asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of the Poison Dao was limited. He picked out the jade bottles and set them aside for the time being. The rest were some Poison Pills. He channeled his divine sense to unlock the restriction on the Spirit Beast Pouch. Inside, there was a dazzling array of venomous insects.</p><p>The sheer number was astonishing.</p><p>Unlike the Five-Colored Poison Spiders and Poison Scorpions, these were mostly naturally occurring venomous insects. There were also a few that Qin Sang could not quite place, their cultivation mostly concentrated at the second and third transformations.</p><p>Exotic insects were few among them.</p><p>However, nurturing so many high-level spirit insects was no easy feat.</p><p>Qin Sang opened an insect jar.</p><p>Without troubling the Fat Silkworm, he covered his palm with protective true essence and pulled out the venomous insect inside.</p><p>It was a colorful moth with vibrantly patterned wings and a gray body.  Qin Sang could find similarities in three types of poisonous moths from his memory, their characteristics combined within this single colorful moth.</p><p>Precisely because of this, Qin Sang couldn't pinpoint the moth's exact species.</p><p>"Three distinct characteristics, this can't be a coincidence.  Is this a Gu insect in its initial stages of cultivation?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He had previously suspected that the Five-Colored Poison Spiders might have been cultivated using Gu techniques. Seeing these insects now basically confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>However, the Five-Colored Poison Spiders were already fully formed, making it impossible to discern how many venomous insects had been fused to create them. This colorful moth, on the other hand, was just at the beginning.</p><p>"Interesting. Using Gu cultivation methods to fuse the characteristics of various venomous insects and enhance their power. I wonder if this can be replicated with other spirit insects…"</p><p>Qin Sang continued to rummage through the Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>With a clatter, dozens of jade slips appeared on the table. Qin Sang perused them one by one.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man and his disciple specialized in Wood element divine abilities, but Qin Sang found nothing related to their core Dao. There were only a few methods for refining Wood element magical treasures, which were inconsequential.</p><p>It was understandable. The Strange-Faced Man, capable of placing restrictions on his disciple's Nascent Soul, would certainly forbid him from carrying important items.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>As his divine sense swept over a jade slip, it caught Qin Sang's attention. He drew it into his hand for a closer look.</p><p>"The 'Gu Treatise,' it's actually a legacy of the Ten Thousand Poison Mountain!"</p><p>The Ten Thousand Poison Mountain was a super sect in the Barbarian State, on par with the Southern State's Mount Taiyue Sect. As its name suggested, the cultivators of Ten Thousand Poison Mountain specialized in poison techniques, benefiting from the unique environment of the Barbarian State.</p><p>Because the Barbarian State was sparsely populated and rich in spirit insects, some Ten Thousand Poison Mountain cultivators also raised spirit insects and excelled in insect control techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously suspected that the Strange-Faced Man and his disciple might be from Ten Thousand Poison Mountain, but since the sect wasn't known for Wood element divine abilities masters, he couldn't be certain.</p><p>After reading the Gu Treatise, Qin Sang felt somewhat disappointed. The jade slip contained only half of the secret technique.  However, the content of the technique provided him with great inspiration.</p><p>Most of the Gu Treatise discussed how to cultivate highly venomous insects, but a portion of it was also applicable to other spirit insects.</p><p>This cultivation method was similar to the Gu cultivation techniques Qin Sang had heard of before, but with a key difference: The Gu Treatise didn't just involve letting spirit insects devour each other. It also employed special pills as supplements.</p><p>The biggest risk of Gu cultivation was that the resulting Gu insects became violently aggressive, and their intelligence could also be affected.</p><p>By following the steps outlined in the Gu Treatise, these risks could be minimized. But this required thorough preparation and meticulous execution, avoiding any haste.</p><p>If used properly, it could even guide the Gu insect's mutation in a direction desired by the master.</p><p>Of course, one could also disregard the risks and quickly use Gu techniques to select the most ferocious Gu insect, gaining a powerful tool. The Strange-Faced Man's disciple had employed precisely this method.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man's Jade Beetle likely drew inspiration from this as well, but it had already surpassed the scope of the first half of the Gu Treatise.</p><p>Qin Sang had immersed himself in the Dao of Insect Control for many years, inheriting legacies from both human and witch tribes. Based on his experience, he judged that the method in the Gu Treatise was feasible.</p><p>However, it was only suitable for the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly were too important. Qin Sang could not accept any mishaps.</p><p>Cultivating Gu insects required them to devour spirit insects with similar attributes. Qin Sang couldn't immediately think of how to categorize the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  If he guided it in the wrong direction and it lost its ability to control tribulation lightning, he would truly have no recourse but to cry.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was simpler.</p><p>Its treasure-seeking ability was inherently based on its keen sensitivity to Fire element treasures.</p><p>He could collect spirit insects with Fire element aptitude for the Fire Jade Centipede to devour. If he only used Gu techniques to help it break through to the fourth transformation, the impact should be controllable.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the insect jars on the table. He would first comprehend the Gu Treatise and experiment with these insects. If the Fire Jade Centipede still couldn't transform, he would then consider this method.</p><p>Upon returning to Zhuozhou, Qin Sang immediately sent all the venomous insects to the Lookout Pavilion, entrusting them to Zhou Ruan and his wife. He also gave them a large sum of spirit stones and instructed them on Gu insect cultivation.</p><p>Zhou Ruan and his wife dared not refuse Qin Sang's command. Moreover, they were naturally delighted to receive a secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Misty Reed Market and commissioned the Six States Hall to collect third-transformation Fire element spirit insects and various spirit herbs needed for refining supplementary pills.</p><p>There were numerous cultivators skilled in alchemy in the Central State. Finding an alchemist was not difficult.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and his avatar would continue to focus on cultivation, hoping to master the secret technique soon.</p><p>Unknowingly, another twenty years passed.</p><p>Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>Late at night, Flying Cloud Ferry was brightly lit.</p><p>Above the lake surface, a sleepless city soared thousands of feet high.</p><p>The grand spectacle of the immortal city showcased its magnificent architecture at night.</p><p>The bright moon bathed the scene in its silvery light. Water vapor rose from the lake surface, forming a faint mist that draped a veil of mystery over the immortal city, resembling the legendary abode of immortals.</p><p>White jade bridges spanned north, south, east, and west, forming an intricate network.  Night-illuminating pearls on the bridges shimmered, complementing the bright moon in the sky.</p><p>The jade bridges, constructed from flawless, top-grade jade, intertwined like giant white dragons, extending to the various peaks along the shores of Flying Cloud Ferry, collectively supporting the vast immortal city.</p><p>Atop the jade bridges, exquisite pavilions and jade palaces layered upon each other, their carved railings and jade structures gleaming like stars embedded in the night sky, their colorful radiance sparking endless imagination.</p><p>Below, two rivers converged, their waters rushing. The turbulent currents reflected another immortal city submerged beneath.</p><p>Boats and countless decorated barges crowded the river surface, appearing as if sailing through the void, entering a celestial realm.</p><p>Passengers on the boats emerged from their cabins to gaze in awe, captivated by the celestial city above, filled with both envy and anticipation.</p><p>Despite the late hour, the immortal city bustled with activity.</p><p>Whether cultivator or mortal, merchant or laborer, all were treated equally within the city.  They traversed the jade bridges, either on foot or by renting mounts and beast-drawn carriages from the stations.</p><p>Spirit beasts of various shapes and sizes, resembling dragons, phoenixes, and qilins, were commonplace. Of course, these were merely superficial resemblances, not true divine beasts.</p><p>Cultivators also enjoyed auspicious symbols.</p><p>The immortal city was divided into twenty-two districts according to the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, with the Heavenly Stem districts being the most prestigious. Mortals mostly frequented the Earthly Branch districts.</p><p>Spirit beasts and carriages galloped along the center of the bridges.</p><p>Zhou Jin, riding a spirit beast purported to be a Dragon Horse, made his way unhurriedly towards the Ding district of the immortal city. Suddenly, he heard a commotion and glanced down at the bridge below.  He saw a burst of flames soaring upwards, emanating from a spirit beast resembling a fire phoenix.</p><p>The 'Fire Phoenix,' disregarding the city's rules, soared above the water. With a powerful flap of its fiery wings, it ascended, showering sparks of fire.</p><p>Amidst countless awestruck gazes, the Fire Phoenix soared higher, finally landing before a jade building in the Ding district and prostrating itself on the ground. A Daoist priest disembarked.</p><p>Someone was already waiting there to lead the Fire Phoenix away. The Daoist priest then entered the jade building.</p><p>"A true man should be like this!"</p><p>Zhou Jin murmured to himself, his face filled with envy.</p><p>This kind of 'Fire Phoenix' was one of the highest-grade mounts in the immortal city, truly dazzling.</p><p>Of course, he could afford to rent one if he gritted his teeth.</p><p>But the immortal city was teeming with hidden dragons and crouching tigers.  As a mere Golden Core cultivator, he dared not flaunt his wealth here. Shortly after arriving in the city, he had encountered several Golden Core cultivators with higher cultivation than his own, all of whom obediently rode in beast-drawn carriages.</p><p>As for Nascent Soul cultivators, unless they deliberately revealed themselves, one wouldn't recognize such experts even when face to face.</p><p>"One day, when I reach Senior Qin's level of cultivation, I'll come back and enjoy this again."</p><p>Zhou Jin set a goal for himself, squeezing his legs. The Dragon Horse, possessing a certain level of intelligence, immediately understood and let out a long whinny before galloping forward.</p><p>After a swift journey, Zhou Jin entered the Ding district and realized it held a hidden dimension.</p><p>What he had seen from the outside was only half of the Ding district. The other half was concealed by a grand formation, exuding a serene atmosphere.</p><p>Zhou Jin knew his place and rode to a quiet courtyard.  Just as he stopped, the courtyard gate opened from within, and a young man emerged.</p><p>Seeing Zhou Jin, the young man's face lit up with the joy of encountering an old friend.  He bowed and said, "Xie Liu greets Pavilion Master Zhou."</p><p>The young man was a rising star of the Xie family.</p><p>Five years ago, Jiang Mu had been transferred from Misty Reed Market to Flying Cloud Ferry by the Six States Hall.</p><p>Most Treasure Exchange Meetings and auctions were held at Flying Cloud Ferry.  Following Jiang Mu's suggestion, Qin Sang had also come here, renting a cave dwelling in the Jia district.</p><p>He had also arranged for the Xie family to establish a base of operations in Flying Cloud Ferry for his use.</p><p>Handing the Dragon Horse over to Xie Liu, Zhou Jin quickly entered the courtyard and whispered, "Go send a message immediately. I have urgent business."</p><p>Xie Liu's expression turned serious. He didn't dare to ask further questions and hurried into a secret chamber, activating its restrictions.</p><p>He knew the restrictions here had a messaging function, but he didn't know who the messages were sent to. After completing this task, Xie Liu settled Zhou Jin in and then diligently returned to his cultivation.</p><p>Jia district cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke and vanished in a flash.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared before Zhou Jin. He hurriedly rose and bowed, "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>"Sit. What urgent matter do you have?"</p><p>Qin Sang sat down and asked.</p><p>Zhou Jin didn't dare to sit. He opened the Spirit Beast Pouch at his waist and retrieved an insect jar from within. "This junior has been cultivating this Gu insect according to the secret technique as instructed. I could control it before, but recently, as I prepared to have it devour more poisonous insects to break through, an anomaly occurred. Forcing a breakthrough might lead to loss of control.  This junior dared not make the decision on his own…"</p><p>Qin Sang took the insect jar and opened it, revealing a colorful poisonous moth.</p><p>It was the same moth that combined the characteristics of three different species. He had set the plan in motion, ordering Zhou Ruan and his wife to continue its cultivation. Now, it was completely unrecognizable.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the poisonous moth and carefully sensed its condition.</p><p>In just twenty years, the moth had advanced from early third transformation to the verge of late third transformation.  Its progress was remarkably fast, but the cost was equally high.</p><p>Not to mention the vast resources he had provided.</p><p>The moth's temperament had become extremely ferocious. Even Qin Sang, a Nascent Soul cultivator, couldn't completely suppress it.</p><p>This was the consequence of rushing the process.</p><p>When he entrusted the moth to Zhou Jin, Qin Sang had anticipated this. He needed this negative example to gauge the severity of the risks.</p><p>"You've done well."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's praise, Zhou Jin's anxiety finally subsided.</p><p>After asking Zhou Jin for the pills and two poisonous insects intended as fodder, Qin Sang entered a quiet chamber and created a sealed area with restrictions, placing the three venomous insects together. He took out a pill, crushed it into powder, and sprinkled it inside.</p><p>Besides the poisonous moth, there was a centipede and a venomous ant.</p><p>After inhaling the pill powder, the three venomous insects became agitated to varying degrees, with the poisonous moth exhibiting the most extreme reaction. It became completely frenzied, its wings flapping violently as it spewed a cloud of poisonous mist, enveloping its two opponents.</p><p>The opponents were equally unwilling to yield.</p><p>A bloody battle ensued. In the end, the centipede and venomous ant were defeated, their corpses devoured by the poisonous moth.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, occasionally adding various pills.</p><p>'Crunch… crunch…'</p><p>A chilling chewing sound echoed within the quiet chamber.</p><p>After devouring the corpses of its enemies, the poisonous moth briefly quieted down, then its aura suddenly surged, breaking through to the late third transformation in one go.  However, its temperament became even more violent.</p><p>'Bang, bang, bang…'</p><p>Trapped within a sphere of light, the poisonous moth relentlessly slammed against the barrier as if tireless.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his fingers repeatedly, sending streams of restrictive energy into the sphere of light, forcibly restraining the moth and finally subduing it. After a thorough examination, Qin Sang obtained the information he needed, gaining a firmer grasp of this secret technique.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, greedily eyeing the poisonous moth. It had long been impatient and, with Qin Sang's consent, swallowed the moth whole.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Fat Silkworm with a dubious expression.</p><p>This fellow directly swallowed the Gu insect whole. How was that any different from Gu cultivation itself? Would there be any problems in the future?</p><p>This was already the third Gu insect. If it could bring about a significant improvement in the Fat Silkworm, he would consider using this method to cultivate its food. Otherwise, such a massive expenditure was a bit much even for Qin Sang.</p><p>Returning to the Jia district, Qin Sang contacted Jiang Mu to purchase the final necessary items, preparing to help the Fire Jade Centipede transform.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Friends and colleagues are successively having babies, it's truly unavoidable, and it's definitely a matter of time for me too.</p><p>Right now, things are really hectic, both physically and mentally exhausting.  All I can say is that I'll do my best to update during this period.  I might need to take breaks at any time. I just hope things get back on track soon.</p>
