<h1>Chapter 812: Bait and Switch</h1><p>Qin Sang emerged from the trees.</p><p>From their Daoist robes, he could tell these two were disciples of the Vast Sea Sect.  Qin Sang initially thought they'd targeted him as an outsider, driven by greed. But their earlier conversation suggested something more complex.</p><p>Startled, the two disciples whirled around. Seeing Qin Sang step out so casually, unafraid despite being caught tailing them, they suspected a trap.  They scanned their surroundings, finding no one else. The taller cultivator scowled. "Who are you? Why have you infiltrated Palm Island?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, reaching out into the void.  Behind the two, the space rippled. A nearly imperceptible shadow froze, then flew back into Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>The disciples paled. This was their sect's unique, highly secretive communication method, yet this man had effortlessly detected it.</p><p>"You followed me with malicious intent, and now you dare accuse me? I didn't want to cause a scene, but since you've delivered yourselves to me..." Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>Before he could finish, the world blurred for the disciples. Horrified, they found themselves immobilized, realizing the terrifying power of the man before them.  Fear choked off their words.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed a hand to one disciple's head.</p><p>The taller disciple watched in terror as his companion died during a soul search, the gruesome death shattering his composure. He lost control of his bladder.</p><p>"The Vast Sea Sect Master secretly investigated everyone connected to the Spirit Turtle Island Master.  Shortly after, Spirit Turtle Island was attacked..."  The information gleaned from the soul search startled Qin Sang.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master had been discreet.  Only a few core disciples knew; no one outside suspected.  Even Martial Master Wu of the Three Mountains Sect was unaware of being investigated.  After the attack on Spirit Turtle Island, the Vast Sea Sect ceased its activities, seemingly dormant. Martial Master Wu and the others remained unharmed. Yet, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.</p><p>Whoever commanded the Vast Sea Sect Master wouldn't have acted without reason.</p><p>Martial Master Wu's safety didn't guarantee everyone else's. Perhaps the others were simply deemed too weak.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's teachings spanned over a century, benefiting many cultivators, including a few Foundation Establishment experts, mostly itinerant.  These individuals had long lost contact; their deaths would go unnoticed.</p><p>"The one manipulating the Vast Sea Sect Master is likely the true culprit. Finding him will reveal the truth.  He's around the same level as Madam Liu; capturing or killing him would be easy.  But those behind him might still be around.  It's best to lure him out and ambush him. Even if things go wrong, I can escape quickly."  Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the surviving disciple.</p><p>While the Vast Sea Sect controlled this city, several other factions held influence, their combined strength considerable.  These two were the sect's administrators; they could be useful.</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master had ordered them to report any unfamiliar powerful cultivators, especially Foundation Establishment experts connected to the Spirit Turtle Island Master. Qin Sang's low profile had misled them.</p><p>An idea sparked.  Looking at the terrified disciple, Qin Sang gestured to the corpse.  "If you don't want to end up like him, send a new message..."</p><p>...</p><p>Vast Sea Sect.</p><p>Inside a wooden hall, a disciple meditated.  Sudden bird cries startled him. He rushed outside to find the sect's spirit bird clutching a black "insect."</p><p>The insect, a wisp of black energy, transformed into a message in his palm.  Recognizing the sender, he raced to a cave dwelling on the back mountain and presented the message.</p><p>"Master, an urgent message from Senior Brother He."</p><p>Inside, a middle-aged cultivator, disturbed from his meditation, scowled. He summoned the message, reading it with growing fury. "Hmph! What are those old fools doing?  Daring to disobey and interfere where they shouldn't. If not for Island Master Luo's intervention two years ago, I'd have eradicated them long ago. They think he's their shield?  It's time to clip their claws and teach them a lesson!"</p><p>He crushed the message and stood abruptly. But after a moment of reflection, he sat back down.  "However, out of respect for Island Master Luo, I can't just kill them...  Summon your Senior Brother. Have him lead men discreetly into the city to assist your two Senior Brothers.  Ascertain their intentions. I'll personally confront them later."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The disciple hurried away.</p><p>Soon, the Vast Sea Sect gates opened. Several figures flew towards the city.</p><p>As they left, Qin Sang's figure appeared on a distant hill.</p><p>Seeing only Foundation Establishment disciples emerge, Qin Sang glanced towards the Vast Sea Sect, cursing the Sect Master's cowardice. Fortunately, anticipating the limited effect of a single message, he had a backup plan.</p><p>To avoid attracting attention from Elder Qingzhu's enemies, Qin Sang preferred a more complex approach.  The message wasn't entirely fabricated. While powerful, the Vast Sea Sect didn't have absolute control over Palm Island.  Fabricating evidence against the other factions was easy.  The two administrators had already gathered some, though not as damning. Qin Sang embellished it, making it appear as a planned rebellion.</p><p>When the Vast Sea Sect disciples reached the city, they infiltrated it quietly and found the taller cultivator.</p><p>"Junior Brother He, where's Junior Brother Ren? Why are you alone?"</p><p>The Vast Sea Sect Master's eldest disciple, Wei Yu, couldn't see the figure sitting in a corner of the hall.</p><p>Junior Brother He saw him clearly.  Cowardly and controlled by Qin Sang, he knew he was betraying his sect, yet dared not refuse. "Junior... Junior Brother Ren is monitoring the Tiger Mountain faction.  I'm here waiting for Master.  Senior Brother, why didn't Master come?"</p><p>Having rehearsed this countless times, his performance was convincing.</p><p>"Master sent me to gather evidence first."</p><p>Unsuspecting, Wei Yu examined the fabricated evidence. He ordered his men to remain in the city, avoid alerting anyone, and personally returned to the sect with the evidence.</p><p>After his departure, Qin Sang captured the remaining disciples and silently followed Wei Yu.</p><p>This elaborate scheme had taken considerable effort. Thankfully, the soul search had provided him with intimate knowledge of the Vast Sea Sect and the city, making it impossible for the taller disciple to deceive him.</p>
