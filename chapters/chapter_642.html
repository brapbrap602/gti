<h1>Chapter 634: Unwanted</h1><p>Before the eyes of many, a horrific slaughter suddenly occurred.</p><p>The priests of Yi Hui Village, messengers of the Witch God, were instantly annihilated, their blood staining the sky.</p><p>The villagers were terrified, screaming wildly, fleeing in panic.</p><p>Even the villagers of Yi Hui Village were frightened out of their wits, unwilling to stay.</p><p>“The priests of Yi Hui Village slaughtered their people and fed them to insect gu.  The Witch God is enraged, and divine punishment has fallen.  A new messenger of the Witch God will arrive…”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice echoed throughout the area, paving the way for Ya Gu.</p><p>He flew with Ya Gu to the cave dwelling of the Yi Hui Village priests.</p><p>Ya Gu was fast asleep, her expression serene, incongruous with the blood on her face.</p><p>Placing her on the ground, Qin Sang reached out and grasped; the priests’ storage pouches flew towards him, landing on the grass before him.</p><p>The contents of these pouches were of little value, nothing that caught Qin Sang's eye.</p><p>Among them was a method for cultivating Yi Hui insects. Qin Sang found the Yi Hui's potential too weak and was unwilling to choose this type of spirit insect as his life-bound insect gu.</p><p>Furthermore, the Yi Hui's venom wasn't an incurable poison; cultivating them was not cost-effective.</p><p>Qin Sang was interested in the Yi Hui Village's divine runes.</p><p>The power of the runes was very peculiar.  Unlike life-bound insect gu which occupied the position of a life-bound treasure, their cultivation method seemed completely different from the cultivation techniques of cultivators.</p><p>If it didn’t require too much effort, and its power was strong enough, Qin Sang wanted to try it on himself.</p><p>He didn't care about appearance, as long as it increased his strength.</p><p>After emptying the pouches, Qin Sang finally found a piece of animal hide in the elder's pouch. The hide depicted several patterns.</p><p>One of them was identical to the divine runes on the female priestess.</p><p>Having searched through everything without finding an interpretation of these runes, Qin Sang examined them carefully, gradually discerning some patterns, but he was still far from truly understanding them.</p><p>After all, it was a completely unfamiliar power.</p><p>Even someone as strong as Qin Sang couldn't do it without guidance.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had a faint feeling that these runes seemed to be a channel for the Wu people to draw upon the power of nature, and might require the talent of the Wu people to use.</p><p>He was human; he didn’t possess that talent.</p><p>Human cultivators could still cultivate if they could suppress the backlash of the life-bound insect gu; the runes were different.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was studying the runes on the animal hide, Ya Gu let out a soft moan and woke up.</p><p>Her eyes were a little dazed, but she immediately recalled what had happened before she lost consciousness, and a look of panic appeared on her face.  Seeing Qin Sang beside her, she calmed down.</p><p>“You’re awake?”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the small lake, “Go wash your face and clean off the blood.”</p><p>Ya Gu went to the lake, cupped her hands to scoop up water, and was about to wash her face when she suddenly saw the bloodstains on her face in the water, looking like a murderous fiend, and she froze.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall his first kill in this world, stabbing those bandits. He’d looked the same after killing them.</p><p>After a while, Ya Gu buried her face in the water, washing away the bloodstains, and silently sat down beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a change in Ya Gu's demeanor.</p><p>It was understandable. After experiencing such dramatic highs and lows, personally killing her enemies, who were messengers of the Witch God, it was impossible for her not to change.</p><p>“Now, what are your thoughts?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ya Gu sat hugging her knees, as if this was the only way to keep herself warm.  She stared intently at Qin Sang’s profile and shook her head.</p><p>“The cultivation world is like this; there's no logic.</p><p>“The priests of Yi Hui Village had at least a reason to kill you.  You have no reason to die when you meet those bloodthirsty fiends.</p><p>“These days, you’ve already sensed Qi within your body, and you are now a cultivator. I don't know if this is good or bad for you.</p><p>“It can make you no longer weak and allow you to control your destiny, but it will also bring you trouble and danger. If you want to live longer, remember today.</p><p>“Of course, decisiveness in battle isn't enough; the rest you must understand yourself.</p><p>“This is for you…”</p><p>Qin Sang took out the two Devouring Yuan Cones and handed them to Ya Gu, teaching her how to use them.  “These Devouring Yuan Cones have been modified by me using black water snake venom. If used properly, they can kill a Foundation Establishment Mid-stage cultivator. If a Foundation Establishment Late-stage cultivator is careless, they can also be poisoned, enough to save your life.”</p><p>Ya Gu took the Devouring Yuan Cones, but didn't look at them. She continued to stare intently at Qin Sang, hesitated, and whispered, “One-armed Brother, may I ask a question?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"What's your cultivation level?" the mute woman asked.</p><p>"Early Core Formation," Qin Sang answered without concealing it, "I've only recently reached Core Formation."</p><p>"Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation…"</p><p>The mute woman muttered to herself. The light in her eyes suddenly dimmed, and she whispered, "You said, with my talent, even Foundation Establishment would be difficult, that I'd never reach Core Formation in my lifetime…"</p><p>Qin Sang first hummed in agreement, then shook her head.  "Anything is possible, but realistically, your chances of Core Formation are extremely slim. Now that the Winged Viper Tribe's priests have been killed, you are the only priestess here. Until your cultivation improves, I'll have the Five Insects Sect help manage things for you.  Plus, with the two Soul-Devouring Cones, no one can challenge your position. Then, you will be the leader; everyone will respect and fear you, you will have ultimate power, and you can deal with anyone who has ever bullied you…"</p><p>After listening to Qin Sang's long explanation, the mute woman remained unmoved, staring intently at Qin Sang and asking, "You're leaving, aren't you? And you won't come back?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and nodded.</p><p>The mute woman suddenly lowered her head, fighting back tears, her hand clutching the Qingfu coins tightly.  "Can you… can you give them to me? Please don't take them back?"</p><p>The mute woman was pleading, her voice choked with sobs.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled helplessly. "These Qingfu coins have a range limit. I'll be leaving the Xiong Mountain region soon, so they'll be useless to me. They're not valuable.  If you want them, keep them."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang stood up. "I've taught you everything I can. I should go now. I don't know when we'll see each other again. Take care of yourself."</p><p>Unexpectedly, the mute woman suddenly stood up, rushed to Qin Sang, and exclaimed, "One-Armed Brother, can I not be the Winged Viper Tribe's priestess? I don't want everyone to respect and fear me. I don't want ultimate power…"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "What do you want?"</p><p>"I want to cultivate the immortal way!"</p><p>The mute woman bit her lip, her eyes filled with stubbornness as she met Qin Sang's gaze. "You said that to achieve something in the immortal path, one must wholeheartedly pursue the Dao, cultivate without distractions. Power, delicacies, pleasures – I don't want any of them! I don't desire anything else, and I won't bother you. I only ask One-Armed Brother to show me the way, to tell me where I can cultivate like that. As the Winged Viper Tribe priestess, I'll never…"</p><p>After a pause, the mute woman murmured, "I'm not willing to just accept my fate!"</p>
