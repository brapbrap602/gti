<h1>Chapter 1956: The Mountain Man</h1><p>Noon.</p><p>The sound of galloping horses echoed along the road, kicking up a cloud of dust. Three horses thundered into view.</p><p>Villagers of Qipang Village, resting in the shade of trees, were reminded of the recent commotion.</p><p>Rumor had it that Chen Xiucai had been attacked by enemies and nearly imprisoned.</p><p>The villagers immediately grew anxious, rising to their feet and peering across the river.  They saw the three riders pulling up their horses outside the bamboo grove, about to enter.</p><p>“Oh no!  Trouble again!”</p><p>An old man slapped his thigh, his face etched with worry.</p><p>The others echoed his sentiment.</p><p>Their respect for Chen Xiucai was heartfelt, and not solely due to his character.</p><p>Chen Xiucai had established a school in Qipang Village, bringing tangible benefits and offering a beacon of hope to generations of farmers.</p><p>Just then, one of the three riders raised a gong high and struck it forcefully.</p><p>They dismounted, tethered their horses, and continued to beat the gong as they walked, shouting, “Please invite Master Chen out! Congratulations on passing the examination!”</p><p>Their cries carried across the river.</p><p>“Passed the exam? What exam?”</p><p>“Oh my! I remember Sanguizi mentioned a few days ago that Chen Xiucai had gone to take the examination again. He passed! He's going to be an official!”</p><p>“What kind of official is above a Xiucai?”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers buzzed with excitement.  More and more people, alerted by the gong, hurried towards the school to see what was happening.</p><p>Outside the school.</p><p>“Good news for your household, Master Chen Zhenqing!  First place in the provincial examinations, the Jieyuan!  Success in the imperial examinations, topping the list!”</p><p>The three men presented the official notice with smiles.</p><p>Chen Xiucai accepted it, his expression as calm as when he failed previous exams, only a slight sigh escaping his lips.</p><p>Madam Chen, who had accompanied him, gently took her husband's hand, and whispered to their servant, “Mingyan, fetch the celebratory money.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Mingyan happily went to retrieve it.</p><p>It seemed that the Chen household had anticipated Chen Xiucai’s success, as preparations were already in place.</p><p>Soon, the school and its surroundings were packed with joyous people vying for the celebratory money.</p><p>Not only Qipang Village residents, but also gentry and prominent families from Qinggui Town and Jien County arrived, even the county magistrate himself came to offer his congratulations.</p><p>Even without his connection to the high-ranking official, Chen Xiucai, as the Jieyuan, was practically guaranteed to pass the imperial examinations.</p><p>The celebrations continued into the night.</p><p>The following day.</p><p>However, the newly appointed Jieyuan did not stay home to entertain guests. He instead ordered food and drink to be sent to Qingyang Temple.</p><p>In the attic.</p><p>The food and drink were laid out.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yulang waited on them.</p><p>“We can’t call him Chen Xiucai anymore.  It's Master Chen now.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, offering Chen Zhenqing a cup of wine.</p><p>“Master, please don’t mock me. I know how much this Jieyuan title is worth,”</p><p>Chen Zhenqing took a large gulp of wine and sighed.</p><p>“Becoming the Jieyuan is still a good thing.  This is a step up. You can finally pursue your ambitions. Why be so downcast?” Qin Sang shook his head gently.</p><p>“Ambitions?”</p><p>Though he hadn’t drunk much, Chen Zhenqing seemed slightly inebriated, his gaze distant. “My teacher is getting on in years. Though he’s returned to court, time is not on his side. Among his students, I’m not outstanding. I’ve been idle for many years. In terms of governance and administration, I’m far behind others, unable to assist my teacher in any meaningful way.”</p><p>Pausing, he said gravely, “I’ve decided, should I be fortunate enough to pass the imperial examinations, I’ll request an assignment to a border county. To serve as an official for a term, to benefit the people, so that even a hundred years later, people will still remember the name Chen Zhenqing!”</p><p>He glanced at Yulang and Xiao Wu. “I will soon be taking my family to the capital for the imperial examinations.  This parting may well be our last.  My only concern is these students.”</p><p>Yulang’s eyes welled up.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat quietly beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Over the years, they had shared many days with Chen Zhenqing, a bond not easily broken.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Chen Zhenqing’s thoughts and smiled slightly.  “Brother, if you have something to say, speak plainly.”</p><p>“Could Yulang take over the school?”</p><p>Chen Zhenqing's words surprised Yulang.</p><p>“Ah? Me?”</p><p>Yulang hadn't expected his master to entrust the school to him, and stood up, pointing at himself.</p><p>“Many are keen to replace me, including those of genuine talent and learning.  But their true intentions aren’t hidden from me; I doubt they’d be content staying in the countryside as a teacher. Yulang’s character, scholarship, and talent are evident to all, more than capable of being a teacher! If only he weren't averse to officialdom, we, master and student, could have both achieved great success together, becoming a legendary story!”</p><p>Chen Zhenqing looked at Qin Sang expectantly.</p><p>Qin Sang is truly Yu Lang's master; without Qin Sang's permission, nothing can be done.</p><p>At this time, someone seeking medicine entered the Taoist temple.</p><p>Qin Sang rose from his seat and said to Yu Lang, "Your master will not interfere.  Think carefully for yourself whether you can bear the responsibility."</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Midsummer.</p><p>The sound of reading filled the school.</p><p>A cool breeze blew through the bamboo forest, lessening the summer heat. Yu Lang, now a teacher, finished his rounds of the elementary school and ascended the bamboo tower.</p><p>The sound of argument drifted from the tower.</p><p>It wasn't a quarrel, but a group of talented young men debating scriptures.</p><p>Master Chen is gone, but the number of students hasn't decreased; indeed, even talented young men from the county town now prefer to come here to write poetry and compose calligraphy.</p><p>"Brother Yu Lang, you've come! Come and judge for us!"</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang, everyone crowded around him.</p><p>Yu Lang, though a teacher, was of a similar age to most present, and they addressed each other as brothers.</p><p>Finally escaping the crowd, Yu Lang walked to the window.</p><p>Xiao Wu sat there, her chin in her hands, gazing out the window.</p><p>She exuded a cold aura, making people hesitant to approach.</p><p>After that incident, Yu Lang clearly sensed an invisible barrier between his senior sister and outsiders.</p><p>Furthermore, Yan Kingdom doesn't allow women to take the imperial examinations, and his senior sister's old friends gradually left the school, leaving fewer and fewer behind.</p><p>Thankfully, she hadn't become disheartened or withdrawn as before; she remained at the school.</p><p>Hoping his sister would overcome this, Yu Lang sighed, producing a letter.  "Sister, a letter from Master has arrived. Master has requested a transfer and is going to serve as an official in Shanyang County, Zhongning Prefecture, Luzhou."</p><p>"Shanyang County, bordering Daliang Kingdom?"</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter and read it carefully.</p><p>"Yes! After the devastating war between Yan and Daliang decades ago,  which almost allowed surrounding countries to take advantage of the situation, they agreed to a ceasefire and focus on recovery. Currently, both monarchs are not warmongers. Although Shanyang County is on the border, there shouldn't be any major problems. Besides, Master has the protective amulet we gave him, and I plan to contact the local gods through the city god of Yu Cheng to offer assistance if necessary."</p><p>Hearing that Yu Lang had thought it through, Xiao Wu said no more.</p><p>After school, the two of them, as usual, carried their books and walked toward Qingyang Temple as the sun set.</p><p>Passing through Qipang Village, villagers greeted them warmly, some asking Yu Lang when he would take the imperial examination.</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated, finally speaking as they left the village. "Sister, I heard news about Meng Yushu today."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Xiao Wu looked over, her expression unchanged.</p><p>"Meng Yushu seems to have gone mad. The Meng family moved out of Qinggui Town and disappeared.  Given Master's reputation for curing madness, the Meng family is most likely too ashamed to seek his help again."</p><p>Yu Lang snorted coldly.</p><p>After the incident, they hadn't deliberately sought information on Meng Yushu.  It was said he was taken away by the yamen and never appeared at the school again.  It's unclear when he was released, but he must have suffered greatly.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Xiao Wu replied indifferently.</p><p>Yu Lang wanted to ask his senior sister about her current feelings towards Meng Yushu, his lips moved, but he ultimately didn't ask.</p><p>Back at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The temple was empty.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the underground chamber, seated on the main altar.</p><p>Lightning surrounded him, electric serpents writhing around his body.</p><p>Most striking was that the interior of the main altar beneath Qin Sang had become transparent, revealing countless intertwined thunderbolts, flashing brightly.</p><p>Within these thunderbolts, one point of light was the most dazzling; from the outside, it appeared only as a light spot the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>Yet this point seemed to hold infinite change.</p><p>This point of light was the mysterious lightning talisman Qin Sang couldn't fathom, and it was the very core of the entire altar!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>...</p><p>The main altar and the underground chamber shook.</p><p>Inside the main altar, the world of thunder and lightning, with its collisions and devouring of each other, presented an apocalyptic scene that never ceased.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang made a hand gesture, silently chanting an incantation; a bolt of lightning shot from his fingertip.</p><p>The lightning struck the altar below, penetrating it directly.</p><p>One action affecting the whole; with this lightning entering, the already chaotic power of thunder exploded completely.</p><p>The lightning didn't disappear after striking.</p><p>One end remained connected to Qin Sang's fingertip, the other stirring the sea of thunder within the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated the lightning like a musician playing a stringed instrument, his hand's movements changing rhythmically, the lightning responding with waves of fluctuation.</p><p>Thus, the lightning trembled, slowly probing towards the core of the main altar, gradually approaching the light spot.</p><p>The lightning drew ever closer to the light spot.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Without hesitation, he dispersed the lightning at his fingertip with a sharp "pop."</p><p>Simultaneously, the main altar violently shook.</p><p>The power of thunder seemed to have finally found an outlet, surging out of the main altar along the path of the lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang was in the direct path, but thankfully he was prepared.</p><p>He floated in the air, his hands transforming into thunderous palms, his palms meeting the lightning. Two streams of lightning converged in his palms, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>Slowly but firmly, his palms pressed downwards, finally pressing against the main altar, suppressing the power of the thunder.</p><p>The lightning abruptly vanished, plunging the underground chamber into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, gazing at the main altar, lost in thought for a moment before muttering, "Still needs some refinement."</p><p>Then, he moved his lips.</p><p>On the ground, Luo Hou was curled up on a large cushion.</p><p>For years, it had been mostly asleep, but today Qin Sang had awakened it.</p><p>Tai Yi, mirroring Luo Hou, had secluded himself in a side hall to consolidate his cultivation, and was also startled awake.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The two demons entered the underground chamber and bowed together.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Greetings, Lord!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, observing the two demons.</p><p>He sensed little unrest from Tai Yi.</p><p>As for Luo Hou, possessing a new body and refining it from scratch usually took a long time.  Thanks to the pills Qin Sang bestowed—rare elixirs hoarded by a Transcending Void demon—Luo Hou had made rapid progress lately, improving by the day. He was confident Luo Hou would soon be fully recovered.</p><p>"Go and do something for me."</p><p>Qin Sang flicked out a beam of lightning.</p><p>The beam exploded before the two demons, revealing a map composed mainly of light spots.</p><p>This was the diagram of the altar array that Qin Sang had deduced through his understanding of the main altar.</p><p>The brightest spot represented the main altar, while the others indicated the locations of the branch altars.</p><p>"You will act separately, using this map to find all the branch altars!"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>His calculations weren't entirely accurate, and there might be omissions, so the demons would need to verify them one by one while he continued his calculations here.</p><p>The missing piece preventing him from reaching the 'light spot' was the complete array map.</p><p>Once he obtained the complete altar array map, Qin Sang would be able to repair the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang waved his sleeve, sending out several streams of light.  "Some branch altars may be in the Yun Du and Mu Luo Mountains. Luo Hou, you are not adept at escape techniques, take the Earth-Traveling Vessel. Tai Yi, your true form is a talisman; activate the thunder talismans, you should be able to control the full power of the thunder talismans. With these protections, unless you encounter a Transcending Void cultivator, you can handle any situation."</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>The two demons, seeing Qin Sang's seriousness, dared not show the slightest negligence. They memorized the map and set off on their mission.</p><p>Having flown out of the Qingyang Temple, the two demons briefly conferred, then departed in opposite directions.</p><p>Qin Sang walked out of the main hall. Yu Lang was closing the temple and quickly greeted his master.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "These past two years, you've been a teacher, and your demeanor has become much calmer than before."</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't expected his master to praise him, and he was almost stunned, a little shy, and his calm demeanor was completely ruined by his silly grin.</p><p>Among all his disciples, Yu Lang was the one Qin Sang cared for the most, having been by Qin Sang's side since entering the immortal path. Qin Sang had even specially prepared medicinal baths for him.</p><p>To some extent, Yu Lang had benefited from Xiao Wu, otherwise he wouldn't have been much better than his senior brothers.</p><p>The drawback was that Yu Lang primarily interacted with ordinary people.</p><p>He had never undergone trials in the immortal cultivation world, never experienced the life-or-death struggles and betrayals among cultivators; his experiences were the polar opposite of Qin Sang's.</p><p>Always sheltered under Qin Sang's wing, he remained childish and easily distracted. If it weren't for the medicinal baths, his cultivation speed wouldn't have been so fast.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted him to settle down, which would benefit Yu Lang.</p><p>"This is a Foundation Establishment Pill, enough for you to break through. During this time, settle the academy and focus on establishing your foundation."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade bottle. "After your breakthrough, I may need to close myself off frequently. You will manage the Qingyang Temple."</p><p>Yu Lang was first delighted, then startled. He solemnly accepted the bottle. "Disciple will not disappoint Master."</p><p>"Go."</p><p>Looking at his disciple, Qin Sang was thoughtful.</p><p>After the Foundation Establishment, he would need to choose a cultivation technique for Yu Lang.</p><p>Qin Sang had observed Yu Lang's experiences closely; he had not discouraged Yu Lang's martial arts pursuits, wanting to see if he could eventually develop something of his own.</p><p>Of course, not now.</p><p>Only after he possessed sufficient cultivation would there be a slight chance, provided Yu Lang's enthusiasm remained.</p><p>However, considering Yu Lang's obsession with martial arts, perhaps the body refinement path would be more suitable?</p>
