<h1>Chapter 1840: The Divine Thunder Assembly</h1><p>What constitutes a god?</p><p>Upon hearing this question, Wan Zhenren fell into a long contemplation.  This is likely a question every Daoist cultivator has pondered. They are accustomed to the existence of guardian deities and have heard countless legends of celestial gods.</p><p>If the legends are false, why can talismans summon guardian deities? If the legends are true, why can guardian deities only protect altars, and why are all sorts of spells to summon and control spirits ineffective?</p><p>Where are the celestial gods? Where do the guardian deities come from? Can the Daoist Court confer titles on earthly deities? Are celestial gods also appointed by the Daoist Court?</p><p>"Talismans have no fixed form, they rely on spiritual essence.  Using the talisman as a body, communicating with the spirit is to connect with the god," the old Daoist slowly uttered these four sentences.</p><p>These words struck Wan Zhenren deeply.  At his level of cultivation, he could vaguely sense the truth, yet still found it unbelievable.  "Gods are… talisman gods?"</p><p>The old Daoist did not answer, his gaze distant, as if peering into the distant past. He mused, "The art of talisman crafting began with the Zhengyi school and reached its peak with the Divine Thunder school.  At the dawn of Daoism, the early masters of the Zhengyi Celestial Master Dao observed the changes in the celestial phenomena, the mysterious flying qi in the sky, and thus understood the way of talismans. A talisman is a point of spiritual light, connecting heaven and earth, the dwelling place of the spirit, forming a talisman god, containing the essence of talismanic techniques. After that, they created the talisman summoning ritual, combining breathing exercises and scripture recitation methods, and passed them down to future generations.  The talisman summoning ritual allowed communication with gods, inviting them into the altar, allowing for constant contemplation. Subsequent generations were able to appreciate the teachings of their ancestors and make further progress, thus perfecting the art of talisman crafting."</p><p>"From the beginning of talisman summoning rituals, the talisman gods of different schools were different and not subject to each other."</p><p>"In the past, the Divine Thunder school flourished.  A highly accomplished Daoist revealed to the world's Daoist schools, calling upon all the true masters to gather at the Divine Thunder Upper Palace, unifying breathing exercises, internal alchemy, cultivating the spirit, talisman techniques, shamanistic rituals, and divination techniques, to establish the Daoist order and rules."</p><p>"The true masters agreed and thus established the Daoist Court, built the Divine Temple, and forged the talisman gods!"</p><p>"With the Celestial Master as the supreme authority, they established the Nine Heavens Golden Palace in the Divine Thunder Upper Palace.  Below the Nine Heavens Golden Palace were established governing, pacifying, and altar offices – this was the embryonic form of the Daoist Court.  Nine ranks of celestial officials were established and granted the supreme Divine Thunder authority. True masters from various schools were selected to serve in the Daoist Court, leading the world. Their responsibilities included supervising the four directions and spreading the Daoist teachings.  All Daoist cultivators, and indeed everyone else, were subject to the control of the Daoist Court, referred to as the Divine Thunder General Administration."</p><p>"The Daoist Court's responsibility was to promote Daoism, defend against external evils, transmit the Daoist lineage, and its establishment changed the previously scattered state of affairs, marking the true flourishing of our Daoist tradition.  The Celestial Masters and high-ranking masters studied the essential techniques of various schools, revised the scriptures to establish nine major positions, summoned the talisman gods of various schools, bringing them into the Divine Temple, and thus manifesting the celestial gods through talismans."</p><p>"The Divine Temple is the dwelling place of the talisman gods, a talismanic formation gathering the spiritual intent of Daoist cultivators from across the land, residing high in the Nine Heavens, invisible and unattainable."</p><p>"At that time, the cultivation world revered thunder techniques. Thunder is the pivot of heaven and earth. Heaven's pivot, earth's mechanism, yang thunder, yin lightning, controlling yin and yang, governing all things.  All schools had thunder techniques passed down through generations, countless thunder Dao talisman gods.  The Divine Thunder school's thunder techniques were particularly exceptional."</p><p>"The Daoist Court used thunder techniques as its foundation, constructing a nine-layered Divine Temple based on the legends of the nine heavens and nine layers, and dividing the talisman gods into nine levels of position, corresponding to the cultivation ranks.  The highest, ninth heaven, is called the Divine Thunder Pure Clear Wonderful Scene Great Existence Heaven, the next is the Purple Thunder Unified Scene Double Palace Transformed Body Heaven.  On the eighth heaven, the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universal Transformation Celestial Venerable is enshrined – the Thunder Ancestor, as later generations call Him!"</p><p>"Besides thunder techniques, other Daoist schools, like Yin and Yang, Five Elements, and Astrological, all had their place in the Divine Temple, but were all under the Thunder Department. Because thunder talisman gods were revered, the Divine Temple was also called Thunder City, and its gods were called the Thunder Department Celestial Gods."</p><p>"From then on, the talisman summoning ritual also changed, becoming the credential connecting to the Divine Temple. Our Daoist cultivators, regardless of school or sect, and whether in the Daoist Court or temple, could use the ritual to communicate with the Divine Temple, connect with the divine, summon the corresponding celestial gods, and invite gods to descend to the altar.  Cultivators with profound cultivation could even summon celestial gods to reinforce their troops, greatly increasing their strength to repel external enemies."</p><p>"The Daoist Court established a Grand Merit Office in the governing office, holding the Grand Merit Seal. The Grand Merit Seal is the manifestation and extension of the Divine Temple's power in the world.  With each established governing office, the Daoist school's power increased.  As Daoism prospered and more cultivators' spiritual intent converged in the Nine Heavens, the Divine Temple became increasingly stable."</p><p>"One can imagine that as long as the Divine Temple remains intact, even if all the Celestial Masters ascend or perish, the talisman gods will remain, ensuring the eternal prosperity of Daoism."</p><p>"This assembly is the greatest event in Daoism, historically known as the Divine Thunder Assembly!"</p><p>The old Daoist spoke at a measured pace, reminiscing about the past glory of Daoism.  However, the secrets contained in his words were enough to shock everyone.</p><p>The shock on Wan Zhenren's face deepened, only now understanding the profound foundation of Daoism.</p><p>When the old Daoist's words finally ceased, Wan Zhenren finally came back to his senses, speechless for a long time. But he quickly realized that the Daoist Court described by his senior uncle seemed vastly different from the present one.</p><p>The Daoist Court of that time only had the Divine Thunder General Administration and did not involve the Heavenly Pivot Academy and the North Pole Exorcism Academy.</p><p>Also, why can only gods be summoned to altars now, and not celestial gods to reinforce troops?</p><p>He opened his mouth, about to ask his questions, but seeing his senior uncle's gaze fixed on the direction of the white stone altar outside the hall, lost in thought, he quickly shut his mouth, not daring to disturb him.</p><p>Shortly after, the old Daoist withdrew his gaze, glancing at Wan Zhenren.  His eyes seemed to pierce through everything, penetrating to the very core of Wan Zhenren's being.</p><p>"Our Daoist tradition has nine major positions:  Zhengyi, Daode, Dongshen, Shenghuan, Donghuan, Wufu, Hetu, Dongzhen, and Bidiao.  Bidiao is unique and shouldn't be listed separately. Legend says that Dongzhen has three stages, the third being Bidiao."</p><p>"The Fusheng position corresponds. The Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universal Savior belongs to the first stage of Dongzhen."</p><p>"Fusheng can preach the Dao.  Further development of Fusheng is also related to the Dao of talismans.  Another purpose of establishing the Divine Court was to gather the power of the Daoist tradition to perform the Great Dao together!  In the deduction of the ancient sages, above Lei Zu (the Thunder God), the second stage of Dongzhen should be Nanji Changsheng Dadi (the Great Emperor of Southern Polar Longevity)."</p><p>"Unfortunately, despite the wisdom of the esteemed ancestor, and the collective effort of the Daoist tradition, this Fusheng couldn't be realized. After countless failures, the ancient sages decided to reopen the Shanggong Palace of Shenxiao and restart the Shenxiao Assembly!"</p><p>"Within the Shenxiao Palace, the immortals debated.  It's said the debate lasted a hundred years, finally deciding to drastically change the methods, alter the Daoist system, and reform the Divine Court."</p><p>"The Nine Heavens and Nine Palaces remained as the Thunder City for the Thunder Gods. Other deities were invited.  The laws encompassed the celestial constellations, establishing a new Divine Court based on the Great Celestial Constellation Array. The river and ocean deities, encompassing all things, wherever the stars shine, there are deities above and below."</p><p>"Within the Daoist Court, the Tianshu Academy was established under the Shenxiao General Directorate, granting them authority over the capital.  Subsequently, many administrative, pacification, and altar masters came from Tianshu Academy, primarily overseeing all directions and controlling the Daoist tradition, corresponding to the Celestial Constellation deities."</p><p>"However..."</p><p>The old Daoist's tone suddenly shifted. He paused.</p><p>Wan Zhenren, completely absorbed, realized his senior uncle was about to discuss the origins of the North Polar Exorcism Academy.  Having been born into the Academy, he was naturally more attentive, his expression growing serious.</p><p>"However, during that Shenxiao Assembly, some immortals offered differing opinions. They believed that all Fusheng were false deities, lacking a firm foundation, incapable of reaching the Great Dao.  They proposed the concept that only merging true cultivation with a deity could create a true god."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Wan Zhenren was startled. He murmured, "Merging true cultivation with a deity… the divine path…"</p><p>"Precisely," the old Daoist nodded. "This inadvertently pioneered the divine path. However, at the time, the majority did not agree. One Celestial Master, defying all opposition, willingly used themselves as a test subject, accepting martyrdom without regret, finally convincing the others. But the Daoist tradition was undergoing reform; there were countless tasks and insufficient support.  Furthermore, this path contradicted ancient practices. To maintain order, rules were established: the development of this path must not interfere with internal Daoist affairs to avoid unsettling its foundation.  Therefore, some celestial officials were separated from the Daoist Court to follow this Celestial Master, forming the North Polar Exorcism Academy."</p><p>"Hou Tu Huangdi?" Wan Zhenren, a member of the North Polar Exorcism Academy, instantly guessed the Celestial Master's identity.</p><p>Other sects, including the Tianshu Academy, worshiped Fusheng.  Only the North Polar Exorcism Academy worshiped true gods!</p><p>Gods who were also Daoist ancestors!</p><p>"Indeed, it was her. This Celestial Master's Daoist name is Hou Tu.  She painstakingly developed the divine path and can be called the Emperor of the Earth, justly so!"</p><p>"Initially, the North Polar Exorcism Academy dealt with ghosts and spirits, eliminating demons and monsters.  Its purpose was to subdue demons and ghosts, proving the divine path. At the time, the North Polar Exorcism Academy was restricted both within and outside the Daoist tradition. Only the Nie River region, rarely visited, was overrun with demons and ghosts. Immortals bravely ventured into the Nie River to hunt them."</p><p>"Celestial Master Hou Tu forged the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons Records, established Six Heavenly Palaces on Mount Fengdu Luoshan, enacting the Ghost Department Fusheng, and declared herself the Fengdu Great Emperor, also known as the North Yin Great Emperor.  She also improved the administrative system, passing it to the Exorcism Academy, adding the ability to summon Ghost Department Fusheng, personally naming it the Northern Emperor's Seal."</p><p>"The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons in Fengdu hold demons and ghosts, refining them into ghost soldiers, assessing their merits and demerits.  Those willing to submit are merged with a deity, becoming ghost gods, entering the Six Heavenly Palaces, leading the ghost soldiers, not only expanding our Daoist territory. And as the Fengdu Six Heavenly Palaces and the Divine Court are interconnected, Fengdu ghost gods, like Fusheng, can be summoned and serve Daoist cultivators! This means that the divine path and the Daoist system can coexist!"</p><p>Speaking of Celestial Master Hou Tu and the ancestors of the Exorcism Academy, the old Daoist's face showed reverence.</p><p>However, Wan Zhenren sensed a different meaning, growing more puzzled.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Nie River and the Nie Yuan?  And what was the origin of the Yin Heavenly Palace and its connection to Fengdu?</p><p>The old Daoist noticed Wan Zhenren's expression. "At the beginning of creation, Yin and Yang were not yet separated, pure and turbid were not yet distinct; this is called the Six Heavenly Ancient Qi. The remnants of this Qi remain in the world, gathering and sinking, forming the Nie River.  Ancient ghosts of the Six Heavens rampage there, making it a forbidden zone for living beings."</p><p>Daoist cultivators, using talismans to communicate with the Celestial Court, can draw upon its power to subdue the six Netherworld regions' miasma.  Summoning divine generals to protect their spiritual bodies allows them to enter the River of Woe and hunt demons and ghosts. As for the origins of the Yintian Palace, it's because the first Palace Master obtained a fragment of the Twenty-Four Netherworld Prison map…”</p><p>The old Daoist paused, ignoring the shocked expression of Wan Zhenren, and continued, “With ghosts and gods established, the divine path became viable, causing a great upheaval in the Daoist world. This led to three Celestial Summit Councils, reopening the Celestial Summit Upper Palace!”</p><p>“This Celestial Summit Council focused solely on the divine path.”</p><p>“The Daoist community collectively named true gods as ‘Earth Gods,’ to distinguish them from Heavenly Gods. They also divided Earth Gods into Yin and Yang divisions. The six palaces of Fengdu constituted the Yin division, each governing its own divine path, while the Yang division…”</p><p>“The Yang division included local deities like Earth Gods, River Gods, City Gods, and Shrine Gods; dragon palaces, mountain temples, mountains, rivers, seas, the Five Great Mountains, the Four Great Rivers, cities, and kingdoms could all be granted divine status. Daoist disciples who wished to enter the divine path often became City Gods, Mountain Gods, or Dragon Palace Gods, with the East Peak Mountain God holding the highest rank – the Great Emperor of the East Peak, equal in status to the Great Emperor of Fengdu.  However, the Fengdu Great Emperor at that time was no longer the Hou Tu Celestial Master.”</p><p>“With the Yin and Yang divisions established, when external enemies like the six Netherworld ghosts invaded Fengdu, they would deal with demons and ghosts; cultivators who committed crimes were sent to the Mountain God temples, where their merits and demerits were assessed, and their punishments determined.  Both Yin and Yang deities were also subject to the summons and examinations of the North Pole Exorcism Court, preventing them from committing crimes.”</p><p>“The world enjoyed great peace. The Hou Tu Celestial Master ascended, reaching the second stage of profound truth, and was known as the Heaven-Following, Law-Emulating Hou Tu Earth Emperor!”</p><p>“From then on, the Heavenly Pivot Court retained its original duties. The North Pole Exorcism Court was called the ‘Supreme Office of Exorcism,’ summoning and examining gods and ghosts. The Celestial Summit Grand Directorate retained only thunder cultivators, renamed the Thunder Jade Palace, specializing in thunder arts and protecting the Daoist court.”</p><p>“After three Celestial Summit Councils, the laws evolved, and the Daoist court's structure of two courts, one palace, and three great offices solidified! This was the peak of our Daoist world.”</p><p>The old Daoist, unusually lost in thought, gazed wistfully, imagining the Daoist world at its height, “At that time, the two courts and one palace produced countless outstanding individuals. Above were the Heavenly Gods of the Celestial Court, below was the Fengdu ghost prison. In the mortal world, Earth Gods assisted celestial officials in governing, ghost soldiers expanded territories, and the Thunder Department provided protection.  Both inside and outside the Daoist court, all obeyed the laws. At its peak, there were twenty-four administrative districts, eight each in the upper, middle, and lower levels, along with various associated, subordinate, and roaming districts, as well as… the four separate districts the North Pole Exorcism Court established at the edge of the River of Woe!”</p><p>Four separate districts!</p><p>A wave of shock crashed over Wan Zhenren's mind, and he began to understand.</p><p>He had been imagining, just like his senior, the magnificent Daoist world at its zenith.</p><p>Everywhere, above and below, inside and outside the Daoist world, in the cultivation world or the mundane world, the Daoist court's will was omnipresent; its decrees were absolute and unquestionable.</p><p>But herein lay the problem!</p><p>Daoist cultivators enjoyed the benefits of the Daoist court, but those outside it were forced to abide by its rules, or face punishment.  As a celestial official of the Daoist court, even though Wan Zhenren was accustomed to it, he could imagine the oppression felt by cultivators outside its direct control.</p><p>Cultivators yearned for freedom.</p><p>Moreover, as the Daoist court grew stronger, more territories fell under its rule.  With Daoist and talismanic paths flourishing, the other factions were bound to feel threatened, and even within the Daoist world, discontent would arise.</p><p>After all, the Daoist orthodoxy wasn't solely comprised of the talismanic sect!</p><p>Thinking of the four separate districts, the Twenty-Four Netherworld Prison fragment in Yintian Palace, the silent Thunder Jade Palace, the North Pole Exorcism Court and Heavenly Pivot Court with nearly identical functions now, and…</p><p>The divine path, originally another major Daoist legacy, was suppressed, only to be picked up by demons.</p><p>Perhaps the divine path was not yet perfected when the Daoist court suffered its downfall, or perhaps the court was now too weak to manage both.</p><p>Many thoughts flooded Wan Zhenren's mind. He spoke with difficulty, “The Celestial Court…”</p><p>“The Celestial Court collapsed.”</p><p>The old Daoist sighed; four words that explained everything.</p><p>“The Thunder Jade Palace, responsible for protection, suffered the most significant losses; almost all the thunder deities were shattered. However, the Celestial Court wasn't completely destroyed; otherwise, we wouldn't even have protective divine generals, and we couldn't survive in the Netherworld. Our duty is to recover the Celestial Court. There's a prophecy: when the Celestial Court is reopened, the Daoist court will return to its former glory!”</p><p>Wan Zhenren's spirits lifted, and he understood his senior's explanation. “Is the Celestial Court located in the Jushan District altar?”</p><p>The old Daoist replied, “It's one of the most likely places. But regardless, we can't let the demons get there first. Do you know what the consequences would be?”</p><p>“Demons usurping divine positions!”</p><p>Wan Zhenren gasped.</p><p>PS:</p><p>Taking a day off tomorrow.</p><p>I'm on a business trip, things are complicated and time is tight. I wanted to take the day off today, but considering this chapter is crucial, I pushed my work forward one day.</p><p>I'll return the day after tomorrow and will try to update then; I will notify you of the specific situation at that time.</p><p>(End of chapter)</p>
