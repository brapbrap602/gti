<h1>Chapter 2107: You're On Your Own</h1><p>Qin Sang and Ji Hong, upon receiving Si Lu's message, immediately set off, arriving back in the Storm Realm ahead of the others to make arrangements for the reception.</p><p>This time, the Zhuyan Tribe only sent Yuan Miao.  Si Lu accompanied Yuan Miao, and the two concealed their movements, arriving in the Storm Realm quietly without alerting the Changyou Tribe or other foreign races.</p><p>They landed in the Western Lands.  Everywhere upon the earth, traces of the great battle between the two tribes were visible.</p><p>From these traces, one could see how brutal the war had been; to say it was a blood feud wouldn't be an exaggeration.</p><p>Yellow sand stretched endlessly across the Western Lands, a desolate scene.  Even within the oases, no figures could be seen.</p><p>Although the Changyou Tribe had retreated, the cultivators of the Western Lands hadn't rushed back to their homeland, still guarding against the Changyou Tribe's return. Qin Sang's words at the Qingyang Temple Grand Ceremony had confirmed this point.</p><p>After flying for a while across the desert, they finally sensed the presence of cultivators.</p><p>“Slow down.”</p><p>Yuan Miao said.</p><p>The two slowed their escape technique, seeing in the distance an oasis amidst the sand dunes. Within the oasis stood a Buddhist temple, but no commoners.</p><p>Golden light emanated from the temple, its gates tightly closed, peaceful and serene.</p><p>But with their cultivation level, they could sense numerous cultivator auras hidden within the temple, a chilling atmosphere pervading.</p><p>“This is a branch temple of the Great Compassion Zen Temple,” Si Lu introduced.</p><p>This temple served as a kind of outpost. Si Lu didn't offer further explanation, believing Yuan Miao could discern its purpose.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded silently. They continued flying for a while, coming across several more temples, all in a similar state.</p><p>Flying further, they finally saw the figures of mortals diligently working. They were now very close to the Great Compassion Zen Temple. This area hadn't been affected by the war over the years, presenting a scene of flourishing prosperity.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, so many foreign races dwell here.  This old man was completely unaware,” Yuan Miao couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p>Si Lu glanced at him. During the journey, Yuan Miao had remained silent, making him difficult to read. Now, judging by his tone and expression, he didn't seem to hold any prejudice against the human race.</p><p>“This way, Fellow Daoist Yuan. This formation leads to the Central Continent. Brother Qin should be waiting on the other side to welcome your esteemed presence,” Si Lu gestured, guiding Yuan Miao toward the ancient translocation formation.</p><p>The guards watching over the formation had already received their orders, lining up to salute.</p><p>These individuals, all chosen to cater to the temperament of the Zhuyan Tribe, were veterans of countless battles, their fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>As Yuan Miao observed them, his eyes indeed gleamed with admiration, instantly letting out a praise.</p><p>The two stepped onto the translocation formation.  With a flash of light, they appeared in the Central Continent. Qin Sang personally waited outside the formation, laughing heartily and cupping his hands in greeting, “Fellow Daoist Yuan, it's been too long.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin!”</p><p>Yuan Miao's eyes lit up. He stepped forward, grasping Qin Sang's arm, his tone agitated, “Since we last parted, Fellow Daoist, I've been constantly thinking of you!”</p><p>Li Yufu and the others standing nearby couldn't help but glance at them.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed. Hearing such words from this old monkey's mouth was truly awkward.</p><p>He smiled, “From our last battle, Fellow Daoist, I gained much, discovering many of my own shortcomings.”</p><p>Yuan Miao's eyes grew increasingly brighter, “Indeed, great minds think alike! Since that is the case, why don’t we have another battle!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged a glance. Yuan Miao's attitude was enough to reveal certain things.</p><p>His tone lightened, “These past years, I’ve been focused on addressing my weaknesses. My divine abilities and Dao techniques haven’t improved much. Even if we fought again, it wouldn't offer you much excitement.”</p><p>“No matter! No matter!”</p><p>Yuan Miao shook his head repeatedly, “After you left, Fellow Daoist, I’ve been pondering how to counter your Golden Sun Great Art, and I've made some progress. I've been looking for an opportunity to test it against you.”</p><p>Qin Sang was also curious about how Yuan Miao planned to counter his Sun Wheel Seal, but now wasn’t the time. “Fellow Daoist, you've come here bearing a heavy responsibility, a matter of life and death for us. Until this matter is resolved, I can't find peace of mind. As for sparring, could we discuss it later?”</p><p>“Indeed! Indeed! Precisely!”</p><p>Yuan Miao wasn’t one to be unreasonable. He had simply been excited at the prospect of a battle.</p><p>Reminded by Qin Sang, he remembered his tribe's instructions. His expression turned serious as he was escorted by Qin Sang and the others towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>On their way to Qingyang Temple, Yuan Miao discreetly observed Li Yufu and the others, confirming that their respect and admiration for Qin Sang were genuine.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The gates of Qingyang Temple stood wide open. Auspicious light filled the sect, a thousand rays of auspicious colors shone, cultivators stood in formation, bells and drums resounded, the ceremony even grander than the previous Grand Ceremony.</p><p>Amidst a wave of respectful greetings, Yuan Miao surveyed the gates of Qingyang Temple, finally raising his head to look at Luye in the clouds, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>After gazing for a moment, he turned to Qin Sang and whispered something, then flew up to Luye with Qin Sang and Si Lu, landing before the sacred statue.</p><p>The statue, weathered by time, appeared smooth and lustrous.</p><p>At their level of cultivation, even if they didn't cultivate the Great Vehicle Path, they could sense the statue's mystical properties.</p><p>Yuan Miao could immediately tell that this statue was not newly erected.</p><p>“Is this sacred statue of Fellow Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Yuan Miao looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, “To my shame, I previously performed some insignificant deeds, but the world remembers them, believing me to be deceased, and erected this stone statue.”</p><p>“To cultivate for a lifetime, benefiting all, is to be called a saint. Fellow Daoist Qin is too modest,” Yuan Miao shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the statue, silent.</p><p>His 'sainthood' was partly due to a series of coincidences and opportunities. However, regardless of his intentions, as long as he could protect the Storm Realm, the title was well-deserved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was still exploring the Great Vehicle Path.</p><p>At the Qingyang Temple Grand Ceremony, Qin Sang had inspired both awe and submission, unifying the hearts of the people, but his meritorious deeds hadn't significantly moved him forward on his cultivation path.</p><p>Reflecting on his cultivation journey after reaching the Void Refinement stage, Qin Sang had gained enlightenment.</p><p>The Great Vehicle Path of Slaughter was both the Great Vehicle Path and the Path of Slaughter.</p><p>At Moonfall Bay, he used the Thunder Altar to slay Patriarch Ming Hu, forcing the retreat of Cloud Capital Mountain, bringing peace back to the world. He suddenly grasped many principles within the *Purple Star Sword Scripture*, reaching the brink of Void Refinement mid-stage. Thus, after seeing the statue, he was able to break through smoothly.</p><p>He was able to gain such profound enlightenment firstly because he sheltered the common people, walking the Great Vehicle Path; more importantly, he dared to confront two seasoned Void Refinement cultivators, leaders of two dominant powers, while still recovering from his injuries shortly after breaking through to Void Refinement.</p><p>Cultivating the *Purple Star Sword Scripture* ultimately came down to the word ‘slaughter’.</p><p>Slaying every opponent was a baptism for his courage, conviction, and pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>Daring to face powerful enemies for the sake of those he protected; the stronger the enemy, the greater his self-improvement.</p><p>At the same time, the stronger the enemy and the more desperate the protected, the more grateful they would be when the clouds parted to reveal the sun, worshipping him with utmost reverence!</p><p>Therefore, this protection of the Storm Realm, warding off powerful enemies, was also a journey of enlightenment for Qin Sang.</p><p>Si Lu didn't know that, once the Thunder Altar was completed, Qin Sang actually hoped that the powerful cultivators of the Siyou Tribe would come looking for trouble.</p><p>Of course, the Storm Realm held special significance, instilled with Liu Li's heart and soul, and Qin Sang wouldn't deliberately put it at risk. If the current situation could be resolved peacefully, Qin Sang would prefer that.</p><p>As for enlightenment, he had ample lifespan and wasn't in a hurry.  He could simply venture out again to find a suitable Dao field. Exploitation and oppression were commonplace in the vast world.</p><p>Yuan Miao couldn't have imagined that so many thoughts had crossed Qin Sang's mind in such a short time.</p><p>Confirming Qin Sang's identity, Yuan Miao stated solemnly, “I ask Fellow Daoist again, have you decided to lead the Storm Continent under Fellow Daoist Qu's protection?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied seriously, “Indeed!”</p><p>“Good. Since it’s your own decision, our tribe will naturally not interfere excessively.”</p><p>Yuan Miao then turned to Si Lu, “Fellow Daoist Qu’s desire to find a Dao field to reside in aligns with the ancient covenant's established rites. But Fellow Daoist Qu, remember, do not cause trouble without reason, otherwise this old man will personally drive you out.”</p><p>Si Lu glanced at Qin Sang, “Brother Qin and the Changyou Tribe have a prior feud.  If the Changyou Tribe returns to attack, our fighting back wouldn't be considered causing trouble without reason, would it?”</p><p>“Of course not.  But we hope your feud won't involve too many others. This old man intends to personally visit the Changyou Tribe to attempt to mediate this matter. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Yuan Miao stared into Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>This was equivalent to obtaining the Zhuyan Tribe's approval, allowing the Storm Realm to establish itself legitimately. Moreover, judging by Yuan Miao’s tone, the Zhuyan Tribe not only wouldn’t take sides but seemed to want to prevent other Imperial Tribes from getting involved.</p><p>This was precisely the effect Qin Sang hoped to achieve by aligning with Si Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, “We are a foreign race, isolated in the Mist Sea. Naturally, we don't wish to start a war lightly.  If the Changyou Tribe is willing to compromise, I will seriously consider it.”</p><p>“That's good,” Yuan Miao's expression relaxed. He believed persuading the Changyou Tribe wouldn't be difficult, and then inquired about the details of the previous confrontation.</p><p>Qin Sang mentioned Zai Zhen's name.</p><p>Yuan Miao frowned.  “When did that brat become involved with the Changyou Tribe? Who else was there?”</p><p>Qin Sang described the one who blocked Su Nu.</p><p>“If they're interfering on someone's behalf, why hide their identity? I want to see who it is!” Yuan Miao snorted, greatly displeased.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang invited Yuan Miao to the main peak as a guest.</p><p>After the feast, Yuan Miao rose and said, “I shall immediately compose a letter, inviting Patriarch Min Zhuo to come for a discussion. Fellow Daoist Qin, where do you think would be a suitable location?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “Between us and the Changyou Tribe, there is a Flame Island, situated right in the middle.”</p><p>“Good, that’s the place!”</p><p>Yuan Miao sent out a talisman message overnight but stayed behind, pulling Qin Sang into a sparring match.</p><p>Qin Sang, reciprocating his goodwill, agreed to his request. After a round of sparring, he himself benefited greatly.</p><p>Yuan Miao’s research into countering the Sun Wheel Seal, although yielding little result, helped Qin Sang discover a few weaknesses.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang had already grasped the true meaning of the *Purple Star Sword Scripture* and would naturally focus on cultivating this technique.  The *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art* could only take a secondary role, and he was still a long way from reaching mid-stage.</p><p>After waiting for a month like this, the talisman message sank like a stone into the sea, with no response from the Changyou Tribe, not even a reply.</p><p>Everyone felt something was amiss.</p><p>In the main hall, everyone gathered.  Yuan Miao speculated, “Could it be that Patriarch Min Zhuo thinks this old man acted without the tribe's knowledge, rather than on behalf of the Zhuyan Tribe?  Suspecting that I’ve been bought by you, harboring ill intentions towards them, resulting in a misunderstanding?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yuan's deduction is not without merit. It seems we'll have to trouble you to make a personal trip," Si Lu said.</p><p>“Very well, this old man will make the journey. You two might as well go to Flame Island and wait,” Yuan Miao said.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two immediately set off.</p><p>They departed from the Western Lands by sea, heading southwest, flying over the vast ocean until they saw a fiery red island.</p><p>The red color came from the island's rocks, but at the island's center was a volcano, its magma churning within, ready to erupt at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu landed on the island, watching Yuan Miao depart, then waited patiently.</p><p>…</p><p>Changyou Tribe, Sacred Lake.</p><p>Without pausing, Yuan Miao arrived at the shores of the Sacred Lake.</p><p>Although the Changyou Tribe was an Imperial Tribe of the Zhuyan, and a small one at that, its lineage stretched back to ancient times. In the ancient covenant, every tribe was equal.</p><p>Yuan Miao straightened his attire, took out the token representing his status as a Zhuyan Tribe elder, carefully wrote a visiting card, and sent it into the Sacred Lake.</p><p>The visiting card transformed into a streak of light, disappearing into the Sacred Lake’s formation.</p><p>Shortly after, the water curtain parted to both sides, several streaks of light rushing out.  The leader was Min Zhuo’s son, Min Shu, the rest being elders of the Changyou Tribe.</p><p>Min Shu's gaze swept over, landing on Yuan Miao standing with his hands behind his back.  His expression tense, he hurriedly landed before Yuan Miao, bowing deeply.</p><p>“We were unaware of the esteemed envoy's arrival and failed to welcome you properly. We beg the envoy's forgiveness!”</p><p>Yuan Miao frowned, “Who are you?”</p><p>“This junior is Min Shu, son of Patriarch Min Zhuo. Father is currently in secluded cultivation. This junior has been entrusted to act on his behalf.”</p><p>Min Shu replied respectfully.</p><p>“Since you are acting as patriarch, did you not receive this old man’s talisman message before?” Yuan Miao questioned.</p><p>Min Shu was taken aback, exclaiming in surprise, “That talisman message was written by the esteemed envoy? This junior is ignorant and inexperienced, not daring to overstep my bounds. Upon receiving it, I sent it to my father’s residence for him to open. But Father has been in secluded cultivation, hence the delay.  Please punish this junior.”</p><p>Yuan Miao snorted but didn't find it appropriate to be angry with a junior.  He said, “This old man has come to discuss an important matter with Patriarch Min Zhuo. You should quickly inform him.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Min Shu hesitated, “Father has recently achieved a breakthrough and is at a crucial stage of consolidating his cultivation. I don't know if he can immediately exit seclusion. Would the esteemed envoy please enter the Sacred Lake first, allow us to express our humble hospitality.”</p><p>Yuan Miao understood this, thinking that letting Qin Sang and the others wait a little longer wouldn’t be a problem, so he said, "The Sacred Lake is your tribe's sacred ground. This old man won't intrude. I prefer the tranquility of mountains and springs, this place suits my liking. You go and report."</p><p>With that, he settled down on a rock by the spring, closing his eyes and meditating.</p><p>The others didn’t dare to leave just like that. They sent Min Shu to report while the rest waited nearby, ordering the tribe to bring immortal fruits and fine wine.</p><p>They waited until evening, Min Shu returning with an anxious expression, reporting, “Father is still in secluded cultivation, with no response.”</p><p>Yuan Miao hummed, his expression unchanged.</p><p>This continued for ten days.  Every day, Min Shu went to report, but Min Zhuo still didn't respond.</p><p>On the tenth day, Min Shu’s voice trembled.</p><p>Yuan Miao abruptly stood up, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Min Zhuo was consolidating his cultivation, not seeking a breakthrough. Even if he was at a crucial moment, unable to immediately exit seclusion, he could still send out a thought to explain the situation.</p><p>He was clearly avoiding him on purpose!</p><p>Min Zhuo must have guessed his intention but remained obstinate, unwilling to negotiate peace with Qin Sang's side.</p><p>The Zhuyan Tribe had sent a special envoy, yet he was willing to offend the envoy, refusing to even meet, clearly indicating his resolve. Furthermore, he was certain of the Zhuyan Tribe's temperament, that they wouldn't exert pressure or forcefully interfere.</p><p>Since that was the case, Yuan Miao's continued presence would only invite humiliation.</p><p>“You’re on your own!”</p><p>Yuan Miao flicked his sleeves and departed.</p><p>()</p>
