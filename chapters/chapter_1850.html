Chapter 1841: Winds of Change Stir the Governance Altar

Wan Zhenren finally understood the paramount importance of this battle for the Governance Altar, and dared not persuade his Martial Uncle to retract his decree. He knew he couldn't shoulder such a heavy responsibility; only a Grand True One of his Martial Uncle's stature and prestige could. Even after self-severing his cultivation, his Martial Uncle's power was far beyond what they could match.  If this battle was related to the struggle for the Divine Court, then his Martial Uncle wouldn't be the only Grand True One to self-sever their cultivation and enter the Jushan Governance Altar.

Sure enough, Wan Zhenren then watched as the old Daoist picked up a golden brush from the table, dipped it in cinnabar, and in one stroke, inscribed a talisman. Spiritual light flashed, and the talisman transformed into a white crane, which let out a high-pitched cry, spread its wings as if to fly, circled briefly before the old Daoist, then shot out of the hall like an arrow loosed from a bowstring, gradually fading into nothingness until it vanished into the clouds.

“The Jushan Governance is the earliest established of the Four Separate Governances. It should have the widest territory, but it also bore the brunt of the Calamity, suffering the most severe damage. Originally, the Jushan Merit Seal should have been the most solidified and closest to Great Completion amongst the four, but due to this incident, it shattered into pieces.  The territories pioneered by our Daoist ancestors throughout their lives, including the Governance Altar, vast swathes of it fell back into the Demonic Wastes, overrun by the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi…"  The old Daoist set down the golden brush and walked towards the hall's exit, speaking as he went.

Wan Zhenren bowed slightly and followed respectfully.  His expression shifted upon hearing these words, another question answered by his Martial Uncle. After a moment of contemplation, he asked, "Even with the strength of the Dao Court in its prime, condensing the Merit Seal wasn't easy?"

Born and raised here, Wan Zhenren had long found it strange why Jushan Governance, despite its dilapidated state, possessed such a vast territory.  In the Daoist scriptures, the complete Jushan Governance far surpassed the other three combined. Now, he understood it was related to the Merit Seal.

The Merit Seal connects to the Divine Court and communicates with the Celestial Deities. Whether it be the Dao Court's Governance Altar, Pacification Altar, Capital Altar, or Branch Altars, or even the various Sect Altars, they all derive their authority from the Merit Seal.  It is only through reporting to the Divine Court via the Merit Seal that decrees possess power.  From his Martial Uncle's words, the more solidified a Governance's Merit Seal, the broader its territory.  The reason Jushan Governance's territory was now limited to south of Xingdao Xianhu was that the Jushan Merit Seal had been shattered.  

Just how vast would the territory of a Governance with a Greatly Completed Merit Seal be?  The current state of the Jushan Governance Altar must be related to that great chaos.  However, since Jushan Governance still existed, and those demonic kingdoms and sects could still bestow decrees, the Merit Seal couldn't have been completely destroyed. He guessed that the fragments were held by both the Dao Court and the Guifang Kingdom, resulting in the current divided rule between cultivators and demonic kingdoms.

While Wan Zhenren pondered these thoughts, he heard his Martial Uncle say, “Indeed.  The Merit Seal can report upwards to the Divine Court and transmit the Dao downwards, bestowing decrees. It is the foundation of a Governance and our reliance within the Demonic Wastes! For a Governance, the Merit Seal must reach Great Completion to be considered a True Governance.  The Divine Court has the power to stabilize the Four Directions and Eight Extremes and pacify the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi. Due to the Divine Court's concealment, the connection between the Merit Seal and the Divine Court is weaker than ever. Not only can it not be further condensed, but it must also be constantly enshrined within the Governance Altar, maintained by True Monarchs.  Its power has been greatly affected, and the higher one's cultivation, the more noticeable it is. Once a Grand True One leaves the territory of their Governance, within the Demonic Wastes, there's the danger of the Altar becoming unstable and the Divine Generals becoming restless. The so-called celestial phenomena are actually signs of our unstable foundations, impacted by the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi."

Hearing these secrets, Wan Zhenren was no less shaken than before. No wonder the mobilization of a Grand True One always resulted in celestial phenomena. No wonder True Monarchs were rarely seen, even someone of his rank had never met one. No wonder his Martial Uncle would rather self-sever his cultivation than consider asking a True Monarch to emerge.  The foundation of the Daoist sect lay not only in the Merit Seal but also in the True Monarchs of the two Academies who maintained it; they couldn't afford any mistakes!

Forgetting his disciple's decorum, Wan Zhenren stepped forward and asked urgently, “Why not ask Senior Ling to emerge?” Senior Ling referred to the spirit of a Postnatal Spiritual Treasure in the North Pole Exorcism Academy. He had once been granted the privilege of entering the Demonic Sea under Senior Ling’s protection.  He hadn’t heard of spirits receiving decrees, but Postnatal Spiritual Treasures didn't trigger celestial phenomena in the Demonic Sea.

“A spirit, residing within its body, can block the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi. However, if it were to unleash its full power within the Jushan Governance Altar, the consequences would be the same as for us; restraining itself renders it no different from an ordinary treasure.  The various illusions within the Governance Altar are mostly remnants of ancient mighty figures' divine abilities. Having evolved over countless years, some are temporarily dormant, while others counterbalance each other, maintaining a fragile equilibrium. If power surpasses a certain limit, triggering these abilities to retaliate, it will inevitably cause chaos. If we were to destroy the hard-won clues, we would be eternally condemned!”

The old Daoist sighed as he walked out of the hall and stood in the courtyard.  He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing at the heavens, his back to Wan Zhenren.

Wan Zhenren’s expression was complex. He secretly guessed what his Martial Uncle was looking at. Was it the legendary Divine Court, or was he ‘looking’ at the Great Dao? If he were in his Martial Uncle’s shoes, he would also be extremely reluctant to self-sever his cultivation.

‘Whoosh!’

Suddenly, wind and clouds surged.  The entire Pacification Altar's Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi was in turmoil, surging like a tide towards this courtyard deep within the Pacification Altar. The Daoists within the Pacification Altar sensed the Yuan Qi fluctuation, filled with wonder and uncertainty. Those with higher cultivation quickly understood the reason.  The lower-ranked Celestial Officials, recalling records and legends from the scriptures, also guessed the cause.  There had long been rumors of a Grand True One's palace within the Pacification Altar, who frequently came here to cultivate in seclusion. It turned out to be true.  For a time, Daoists emerged from their residences, gazing towards this courtyard.

Before long, the wind and clouds calmed.  The Daoists waited for a long time, seeing no further changes.  Unclear about the reason, they merely gained a new topic of conversation.

Within the courtyard, the Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi converged, condensing into a Dharma Body, almost identical in appearance and demeanor to the old Daoist. The Dharma Body hovered above the hall, gazing at its original form, then descended from the sky.

When it was about a yard above the ground, the Dharma Body paused. Amidst flickering azure light, as if Yuan Qi was dispersing, its body suddenly turned illusory.  Simultaneously, a Decree Altar appeared above the old Daoist’s head.

Seeing his Martial Uncle's Decree Altar, admiration and regret welled up in Wan Zhenren’s eyes. Within the Decree Altar, the Northern Emperor Decree resided within the aperture, manifesting as the familiar Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman, almost fully solidified.

Before, Wan Zhenren hadn’t understood the meaning of the Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman, but now he did.  It was the proof to summon Earthly Deities and command the Yin Division's Ghost Soldiers and the Yang Division’s Prefecture Soldiers!

‘Roar! Roar! Roar!’

Although the Decree Altar's gates hadn’t opened, roars echoed from within, each filled with sorrow and heroism. Suddenly, a silver light flew into the courtyard, transforming into a silver spirit bird. It circled the old Daoist continuously, emitting mournful cries, as if lamenting.  The old Daoist's face paled slightly. He let out a muffled groan, and where the Dharma Body had dissipated, a point of azure light descended, entering through his crown.

In the next moment, the old Daoist’s aura plummeted sharply, instantly falling below the Five Talismans Dharma Rank, stabilizing at the peak of the late Hollow Profundity realm.  The Decree Altar and the Nine Heavens Soldier Talisman within it immediately dimmed.

Similar scenes occurred not only in this Pacification Altar, but also in the Baishi Governance Altar, the Zhongmao Governance Altar, and even within the Guifang Kingdom.  For a time, an atmosphere of tension and suspicion prevailed.  Great chaos was about to begin!

…

Jushan Governance Altar.

Deep within the illusions, Qin Sang remained isolated and unaware of everything, continuing his exploration inwards.

Qin Sang believed that within the Governance Altar, besides these mysterious illusions, few enemies could threaten him. Especially after another breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form* and the Cloud Wanderer Sword becoming a Spiritual Treasure, he was even more confident in his strength.  He never imagined that a Void Refinement stage expert would self-sever their cultivation and enter the Governance Altar.

“It’s getting clearer…”  Qin Sang rested on a narrow band of auspicious clouds between illusions, spreading his palm to sense the talisman seal.  Through repeated explorations and returns, he was gradually approaching his target.

The auspicious clouds were thin.  It was rare to find an area with auspicious clouds here.  Qin Sang memorized this place, intending to use it as a transit point in the future.

Soon, Qin Sang’s strength was fully restored.  He stood up and looked ahead.  Based on the talisman seal’s guidance, Qin Sang guessed he was no more than three illusions away from his target.  The terrain here was too complex, with various illusions interwoven, making every step difficult.  If he were to detour, it might take several or even dozens of times more time and energy.  Fortunately, he had the talisman seal to guide him, preventing him from getting lost.

“It’s best to push through in one go,” Qin Sang thought to himself, carefully observing the illusion before him.

The edge of the illusion was less than three feet away, a scene of pure white, and Qin Sang almost felt the chilling wind on his face.  A biting snowstorm.

Having traversed so many illusions, Qin Sang had developed a well-established procedure.  He habitually summoned his Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol, merging it with himself, but not yet activating its power. Then, he activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, transforming into the Vajra琉璃 Body. The Cloud Wanderer Sword also flew out from his brow, hovering upside down above his head, its sword light flickering, ready to strike at any moment.

Because of the scene before him, Qin Sang took two additional precautions this time. He used his divine sense to draw upon the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, forming a fiery armor around him, and awakened the Vermillion Bird fledgling, ready to activate the Sun God Bird at any moment.

Prepared, Qin Sang took a step forward, stepping into the snowstorm.  Instantly, a chill pierced him, reaching his very marrow.  Even Qin Sang’s powerful physique couldn’t help but shiver.

However, it was still bearable.  He calmed himself slightly and observed his surroundings.  There was only heavy snowfall and a thick layer of snow on the ground.  The snow layer undulated, suggesting mountains and valleys beneath, but all were obscured by the snow.

Strangely, the snowfall was endless, yet the snow layer on the ground neither increased nor decreased.  Qin Sang glanced down at his feet. He left footprints as he walked, but they were immediately filled by the falling snow as he lifted his feet.

It seemed harmless, but when Qin Sang tried to move forward, a sense of unease inexplicably arose within him. He frowned and stopped, unable to pinpoint the source of his unease, and chose to retreat from the snowy realm.  This was his experience within the Governance Altar, never forcing himself, avoiding many dangers.

After staying outside for a while, Qin Sang re-entered the snow realm, and the unease returned. Several attempts yielded the same result, yet he couldn’t determine its origin. He summoned a puppet, which entered the snowy realm and quickly froze, then turned white at a visible speed right before Qin Sang’s eyes.

It wasn’t covered by snow; the puppet itself became snow, eventually turning into snowflakes, merging with the falling snow.

Qin Sang was slightly startled, but not panicked. He pondered, the scene within the snow realm reflected in his eyes.  Gazing at the swirling snow and the howling wind, an idea struck him, and he took out the Four Jia Serpent Seal.

The four Jia Serpents detached from the seal head and rushed into the snowy realm, seemingly becoming excited immediately, swimming amongst the falling snow.  Qin Sang commanded the Jia Serpents to exhale, spewing cold flames, noticeably stronger than outside the snowy realm.

After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang re-entered the snow realm and directed the Jia Serpents towards himself.  The cold flames merged, enveloping him completely without leaving any gaps.  Qin Sang was as if frozen within an ice sphere, and the unease in his heart vanished.

“That simple?”

Qin Sang was somewhat incredulous, but still needed to test it.  He walked at a measured pace, the footprints behind him instantly covered by the snow, leaving no trace.  The four Jia Serpents circled above him, like four guardian spirit beasts.

The man and his 'four beasts' silently traversed the snowy plains, their figures radiating solitude, matching the desolate landscape.  Qin Sang’s mind never relaxed, his gaze sharp, until he crossed the snowy plain and reached its end, encountering no danger.

Similar situations had occurred before.  Unclaimed illusions could be easily traversed once the correct method was found, and his methods were diverse.

Qin Sang looked back, secretly sighing with relief.  He hadn’t expected to encounter such good fortune so close to his target, saving him a lot of time.  The snow realm must have been formed by a great divine ability of the ice path.  It was a pity its creator was deceased; otherwise, comprehending it here might have yielded some gains.

Exiting the snowy realm, Qin Sang stored the Four Jia Serpent Seal and then his pupils constricted slightly upon seeing the scene ahead.

Ahead was a pitch-black area, two blades of light intersecting within the darkness, like an open pair of scissors, or like a guillotine about to close.  He could sense that this black domain wasn’t large, as if passing through the guillotine would lead to safety.  He flicked his finger, releasing a bird-shaped puppet.

To aid Qin Sang, Mo Xingdao had refined various types of puppets for different situations.

‘Swoosh!’

The bird flew between the guillotine blades. The two blades of light flickered slightly, instantly severing the bird in two. The two halves continued to fly forward before finally falling and turning to ash.

Qin Sang waited for several days, using various methods to probe.  Finally, he approached the guillotine alone, his phoenix wings unfurling behind him.  With a powerful flap—

‘Crack!’

A thunderclap exploded, brilliant lightning tearing through the darkness.  At this moment, Qin Sang held nothing back. His Dharma Idol channeled the Azure Phoenix’s innate lightning power, pushing the Lightning Escape technique to its limit.  The speed achieved in this instant would astound any Nascent Soul stage cultivator and make even a Void Refinement stage cultivator take notice!

The lightning streaked through the space between the guillotine blades.

Only after the lightning passed did the blades descend.  Qin Sang appeared on the other side of the guillotine, unharmed. He smiled faintly, flying out of the darkness without looking back, and immediately saw a giant ancient mirror.

The mirror was circular, its surface angled towards Qin Sang, standing before him.  It appeared almost solid, yet not quite material.

Perhaps his luck wasn’t favorable; despite exploring the Governance Altar for so long, Qin Sang hadn't encountered any true treasures.

Reflected in the mirror’s surface was a familiar sight: the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles!

Qin Sang stared for a moment, then turned his head slightly, seeing the sky-obscuring Crimson Gold Spirit Needles, radiating an incredibly dangerous aura.

The reality was as simple as he had previously guessed. The Crimson Gold Spirit Needles were reflected in the mirror, creating an image that somehow traversed the space of the Governance Altar and was projected onto its outer layer.

The true scene here was more complex and mysterious than its reflection.  Qin Sang looked up and found an inverted continent above him, complete with mountains and rivers like the outside world. Looking down, he saw a blue sky with white, fluffy clouds.

Here, heaven and earth were reversed, disorienting.

The Crimson Gold Spirit Needles originated from two inverted mountain peaks. The mountains were devoid of people and formations.

Approaching cautiously, Qin Sang sensed an aura several times more dangerous than the reflection and dared not act rashly.

There was no sign of the Ascension Path that Mo Xingdao had described, indicating he hadn't reached the end yet.

Qin Sang continued to probe, memorizing all the surrounding scenery, preparing to return and ask Mo Xingdao, or perhaps bring him here personally.

Having achieved his goal, Qin Sang followed his plan and retreated, returning to his cave dwelling to recuperate.
