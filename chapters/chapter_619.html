<h1>Volume 1 Summary</h1><p>I had a lot I wanted to say, but at the last minute, it felt too sentimental.</p><p>Whether these words, written here, are good or bad is for the readers to judge. I’ll just briefly mention three points.</p><p>First, many say this book is excessively cruel to the protagonist.</p><p>I don't entirely agree. While the journey is arduous, if you examine each plot point, you'll find the protagonist consistently overcomes obstacles and achieves their goals.</p><p>Of course, achieving every goal is only possible in fiction.</p><p>This might be due to my narrative style.</p><p>I'm now realizing an author's descriptive tendencies can strongly influence the reader's emotions, but I'm still learning and improving.</p><p>Second, there's the issue of the protagonist's Golden Core advancement.</p><p>I'm most proud of the fact that the plot largely stayed true to my outline, managing to achieve a satisfying narrative arc.</p><p>Because of this, Volume 1 inadvertently stretched to six hundred chapters.</p><p>When initially creating the outline, I lacked experience and had no concept of the word count for each plot point.  My goal was to create a rich plot, weaving in all the threads I wanted to explore and connecting them so each scene had a clear purpose.</p><p>Looking back, certain parts could have been streamlined.</p><p>Third, there's the only plot point that deviated from the outline, and it's the reason I wanted to write this summary: Qin Sang being deemed spiritually rootless in Da Sui and rejected by the Han family.</p><p>The original outline had Han family's fat man being bribed by the East Yang County Princess with a superior spiritual material to dissuade Qin Sang from joining the Han family and keep her in Da Sui.</p><p>When it came time to reveal the truth, I hesitated.</p><p>Because there's a saying in cultivation novels:  Severing someone's path is like killing their parents.</p><p>Regardless of whether the Princess acted out of greed or affection, her actions are difficult to forgive.</p><p>This approach had one advantage: it effectively reinforced the Princess' character—a ruthless power-seeker who stops at nothing.</p><p>However, besides creating a vivid character, what benefit did it bring to the overall plot or protagonist?  It only caused needless angst for both the protagonist and reader.</p><p>I lost sleep for days over this small section, agonizing over it before finally deciding to change it, removing the subsequent scenes involving the interaction with Han Shixiong.</p><p>This section felt abrupt, and some friends probably noticed.</p><p>To this day, I'm still unsure if this was the right decision.</p><p>The deed is done.</p><p>If there's ever a chance for revision, we'll talk about it then.</p><p>Summary complete, the journey continues!</p>
