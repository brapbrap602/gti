<h1></h1><p>Shi Xue publicly announced Qin Sang's identity as an honorary elder, drawing waves of reverent gazes. Under Tong Lingyu's influence, the tale of Daoist Qingfeng infiltrating the demon nest alone to deliver critical intelligence had recently spread throughout the Mystic Heaven Palace, painting him as a lone hero.</p><p>Faced with the flattery from the other two Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang felt a bit embarrassed and repeatedly expressed his humility. However, when Shi Xue announced that Daoist Qingfeng and Liuli would soon become Daoist partners and hold a grand ceremony, the respectful gazes from the disciples quickly vanished.</p><p>Even with her veil, Liuli's natural beauty was impossible to conceal. Since her return to the Listening Snow Pavilion, every disciple who saw her was struck by her ethereal beauty, making her even more popular than she had been at Shaohua Mountain. To these disciples, Liuli embodied the image of an immortal fairy. Her cold, aloof demeanor only added to her mystique, as if she had stepped out of the Moon Palace itself. For them, merely catching a glimpse of her was a blessing.</p><p>Now, however, their beloved fairy had been pulled into the mortal realm by a man. How could they not feel disheartened? What was even more frustrating was that the Pavilion Master had ordered them to prepare for the grand ceremony, keeping them busy and running around. And the most infuriating part? They dared not utter a single word of complaint.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the shift in atmosphere and couldn't help but recall Senior Brother Zhuang Yan, who had once been infatuated with Liuli's portrait when Qin Sang first arrived at Shaohua Mountain. By the time Qin Sang learned of Zhuang Yan's fate from Mu Yifeng, the man had already passed away peacefully. Fortunately, Zhuang Yan had a talented granddaughter, whom Mu Yifeng planned to nurture, and Qin Sang had also asked Li Yufu to assist.</p><p>"Thank you all for your efforts," Qin Sang said with a dry laugh, cupping his hands in gratitude before hurriedly leaving the Listening Snow Pavilion with Liuli. They soared through the sky on their escape light, heading toward Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>Before meeting the Palace Master, they first needed to visit Hall Master Jiang. Hall Master Jiang was Bing Yao's senior brother and, according to rumors, the top disciple of his generation. Limited by his innate talent, he had been stuck at the mid-Nascent Soul stage for many years without further progress. Bing Yao had essentially grown up under his watchful eye.</p><p>This man not only held immense prestige within the Listening Snow Pavilion but was also highly respected throughout the Mystic Heaven Palace and beyond, a venerable figure of great renown. Each of the major branches of the Mystic Heaven Palace, especially the four main lineages, would send their strongest cultivators to serve as elders or hall masters, ensuring their influence within the palace.</p><p>According to the rules, these individuals were no longer allowed to act in their lineage's self-interest. They had to treat all branches of the Mystic Heaven Palace equally and could no longer serve as Pavilion Masters of their respective lineages. If not for his position as the Hall Master of the Yuanji Hall on Lingxiao Peak, he would undoubtedly have been the Pavilion Master of the Listening Snow Pavilion. Nowadays, Shi Xue would consult Hall Master Jiang before making any major decisions.</p><p>When Qin Sang was invited to become an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, even the Grand Elder had to personally visit Hall Master Jiang to explain the matter, highlighting his esteemed status.</p><p>The Yuanji Hall was named after the Yuanji Spring, one of the Seventy-Two Springs. It was said that this spring produced a type of pearl that was an excellent material for refining artifacts and alchemy, making the Yuanji Hall responsible for the Mystic Heaven Palace's external affairs related to alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang had long wanted to meet Hall Master Jiang. As someone who dabbled in both artifact forging and formations, he naturally wished to peruse the Mystic Heaven Palace's ancient texts and gain some insights.</p><p>At the Yuanji Spring, Qin Sang and Liuli descended from their escape light and saw an ancient hall at the center of the lake, surrounded by various smaller buildings scattered like stars. The hall was built on an island, shaded by lush trees and exuding an air of tranquility.</p><p>From time to time, escape lights flew in and out, carrying disciples from various branches of the Mystic Heaven Palace who specialized in external arts. The lowest among them were at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>As they approached the Yuanji Hall, even the chattering disciples instinctively fell silent, their expressions turning solemn. Liuli's fame had spread far and wide within the Mystic Heaven Palace, and Qin Sang and Liuli, not wanting to attract too much attention, had disguised themselves slightly. They landed with the other disciples in front of the Yuanji Hall's archway and walked inside.</p><p>However, they were soon discovered.</p><p>Just as they passed through the archway, their vision blurred, and an elderly man with white hair and a cane appeared before them. The disciples, who had been hurrying along, were startled and immediately bowed in respect. "Disciples greet the Hall Master."</p><p>"You may leave. Do not waste your time," Hall Master Jiang nodded at them, offering a word of encouragement before turning to Qin Sang and bowing slightly. "Are you Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>The disciples bowed and retreated, stealing glances at Qin Sang, wondering who these two were to warrant the Hall Master's personal welcome.</p><p>"I am Qingfeng. Greetings, Hall Master Jiang," Qin Sang cupped his hands in return.</p><p>"Greetings, Uncle Jiang," Liuli also bowed respectfully and handed Shi Xue's letter to Hall Master Jiang.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang unfolded the letter and read it, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly. He glanced at Qin Sang, then at Liuli, and said kindly, "We are family now. No need for such formalities. Follow me."</p><p>The three of them strolled among the ancient trees and halls until they reached a quiet courtyard.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang suddenly stopped and looked up at the sky, his gaze deep and contemplative, as if reminiscing. After a long while, he said, "I have long heard of Daoist Qingfeng's prowess and feel ashamed by comparison. Your joining is a great boon for both the Listening Snow Pavilion and the Mystic Heaven Palace. Shi Xue mentioned that you and Liuli met in humble circumstances. Liuli is my junior sister's closed-door disciple. Since she trusts you, I trust her judgment. I won't meddle in your affairs, lest you think this old man talks too much. However, in my opinion, I initially did not want to agree to this farce. The proposal of a false Daoist partnership offers little restraint on you, and even a heart demon oath has its loopholes."</p><p>Facing Hall Master Jiang's piercing gaze, Qin Sang remained composed and replied, "I have always adhered to one principle—my word is my bond."</p><p>The two men locked eyes for a long moment.</p><p>Finally, Hall Master Jiang nodded slightly. "I have already informed the Grand Elder. She will take you to Lingxiao Peak to meet the Palace Master."</p><p>This was his tacit approval of the matter.</p><p>For the Listening Snow Pavilion, Liuli was the only hope of their generation. Her failure to break through meant the Listening Snow Pavilion had lost its chance. Rejecting Qin Sang would be equivalent to handing the opportunity to the other three branches, further weakening the Listening Snow Pavilion's position.</p><p>If Qin Sang could gain the Palace Master's approval and secure the right to enter the Body Cleansing Pool, even if he and Liuli were only temporary partners, it would still forge a favorable connection, benefiting the Listening Snow Pavilion without any harm.</p><p>According to Shi Xue, Qin Sang was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage but already possessed strength comparable to a Great Cultivator. He could now dominate a region, and his future potential was limitless. Hall Master Jiang had initially been skeptical, but after verifying the information with Tong Lingyu, he had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>The three of them waited in the courtyard.</p><p>Before long, a fragrant breeze swept through, and Tong Lingyu arrived gracefully. Seeing Qin Sang and Liuli, her eyes lit up, and she raised a delicate hand to cover her smile. "What a perfect pair! Thankfully, I asked Hall Master Jiang and Pavilion Master Shi to help invite Daoist Qingfeng to become an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion. Otherwise, we might have missed this wonderful match!"</p><p>Naturally, the truth of their false marriage could not be revealed to Tong Lingyu. She assumed they were old flames rekindling their romance and couldn't help but tease them.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in return.</p><p>After some pleasantries, Tong Lingyu stood up. "Since I played a part in bringing you two together, I have no objections. However, it is only proper to meet the Palace Master."</p><p>She added, "There's no time to waste. Follow me to Lingxiao Peak now."</p><p>The three of them bid farewell to Hall Master Jiang and flew toward the center of the Seventy-Two Springs, soon arriving at the foot of Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>Even with the Grand Elder personally escorting them, they had to undergo a security check by the guards, explaining their purpose before being allowed into the mountain.</p><p>They ascended to a guest pavilion halfway up the mountain.</p><p>"Wait here for a moment. I'll go up first," Tong Lingyu left them there, oddly not asking Qin Sang to remove his Thousand Fox Mask. Her tone carried a hint of strangeness. "No need to be nervous. The Palace Master has been in seclusion for many years and may not have time to see you."</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance.</p><p>The Palace Master refusing to see them was exactly what they wanted. Qin Sang wasn't necessarily afraid of the Palace Master, but he preferred to avoid unnecessary trouble.</p><p>As they spoke, Tong Lingyu used a movement technique and disappeared from sight.</p><p>At the summit of Lingxiao Peak, there was a jade wall embedded into the cliff, facing north and south, smooth as a mirror. In front of the wall was a small lake with crystal-clear water, where two golden carp swam peacefully. The surface of the lake was undisturbed, and the surroundings were eerily quiet, with no guards in sight.</p><p>Tong Lingyu arrived at the lakeside, gazed at the jade wall, and bowed. "Tong Lingyu pays her respects to the Palace Master."</p><p>There was no response from within the jade wall.</p><p>Tong Lingyu stood still, showing no signs of impatience.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a slightly hoarse voice emerged from within. "Lingyu, you've come."</p><p>The tone was utterly flat, devoid of any emotion.</p><p>Tong Lingyu said, "Palace Master, the Ice Demon Crystal is about to mature. The various branches have agreed to open the Holy Land in one year."</p><p>"Good. I will appear when the time comes."</p><p>Tong Lingyu hesitated, a hint of concern in her voice. "Palace Master, your injuries..."</p><p>"They are of no consequence."</p><p>The voice from the jade wall remained emotionless.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded and didn't press further. "There are two juniors who wish to become Daoist partners. Since it involves the competition for the Body Cleansing Pool, they have come to pay their respects. They are waiting at the foot of the mountain."</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>"A match made in heaven," Tong Lingyu replied without hesitation.</p><p>"Then it is permitted."</p><p>The Palace Master casually approved the matter, just as Tong Lingyu had anticipated, showing no interest in summoning Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression flickered briefly. "Understood!"</p><p>She lowered her head slightly, a glimmer of understanding in her eyes, then bowed again and turned to descend the mountain.</p><p>Behind the pristine jade wall, within the cliff, was a shockingly simple and crude stone chamber.</p><p>The chamber was filled with white mist, exuding an intense cold that could freeze any cultivator of insufficient cultivation on the spot. Beneath the layers of mist was a cold pool, and floating above it was an ice coffin, enveloped in the freezing fog.</p><p>Inside the coffin lay a man.</p><p>The cold mist seeped into the coffin, thread by thread.</p><p>The coffin was covered in countless transparent runes that flickered faintly, though they were difficult to discern with the naked eye. These runes were extraordinarily peculiar, and the coffin itself emitted a strange undulation, as if the man inside had become one with heaven and earth.</p><p>The man wore a white robe and a jade crown, his appearance dignified. Even lying motionless in the coffin, like a corpse, he exuded an indescribable majesty that inspired reverence. He looked remarkably young, yet his aura carried a sense of decay, and his exposed skin was deathly pale.</p><p>He was none other than the Palace Master of the Mystic Heaven Palace—Yin Changsheng.</p><p>If anyone were to see the scene behind the jade wall, they would be utterly shocked, unable to imagine that the Palace Master would be lying in an ice coffin.</p><p>As Tong Lingyu turned to leave, Yin Changsheng's eyelids twitched slightly. His eyes, like ice sculptures, opened briefly, revealing pupils that were nearly black before closing again.</p><p>As they descended Lingxiao Peak with Tong Lingyu, Qin Sang recalled the invitation from the Chaos Demon Elder and subtly probed for information, realizing that Tong Lingyu had not been invited.</p><p>This was rather intriguing.</p><p>However, the Holy Land was set to open in a year.</p><p>Qin Sang now needed to focus on preparing for the Holy Land and the competition for the Body Cleansing Pool. There was much to be done, and he couldn't afford to be distracted, so he set the matter aside.</p><p>The two of them didn't stay long at the Yuanji Hall. After agreeing with Hall Master Jiang to visit again later, they returned to the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>The grand ceremony was being prepared with great urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli had no special requests and left everything to Shi Xue.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his secluded cultivation in the small pavilion.</p><p>No matter how busy things were outside, Qin Sang kept his doors closed and his cave sealed.</p><p>He lightly tapped his spirit beast pouch, and the Fire Jade Centipede flew out.</p><p>After using the Three Spirit King Formation on it, the Fire Jade Centipede had been listless for a long time. It had only recently regained its vitality and, after consuming the pills Qin Sang had procured, had reached the peak of the third transformation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Watching the two little ones play, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>He had been considering whether to help the Heavenly Eye Butterfly ascend its spirit now or let it slowly cultivate and break through to the mid-fourth transformation on its own before assisting it, pushing it directly to the late-fourth transformation.</p><p>The higher the realm, the harder it was to cultivate.</p><p>This way, he could maximize the value of the Spirit Ascension Ritual.</p><p>Qin Sang had high hopes for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. In the future, when he aimed to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage or even the Deity Transformation stage, he would need its assistance.</p><p>For this reason, he was willing to wait a few hundred years.</p><p>However, Qin Sang now leaned toward directly ascending its spirit.</p><p>First, the higher the realm, the greater the risk of failure during the Spirit Ascension. While the rewards were greater, the risks were also higher, which might not be ideal.</p><p>Second, he was influenced by Liuli's words.</p><p>Liuli's master was a true Great Cultivator, and she cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light. Her strength was unimaginable.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang was a realm above Liuli, he had been startled by her power, and at that time, Liuli's Ice Soul Divine Light had not yet reached its peak. This showed just how terrifying this divine ability was.</p><p>With her master's immense strength, she had been so afraid of the Palace Master that she dared not return to the Mystic Heaven Palace, preferring to be trapped in the Purple Micro Palace for hundreds of years rather than seek help from the Mystic Heaven Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang found it hard to fathom Yin Changsheng's cultivation level. Could the legendary half-step Deity Transformation truly exist?</p><p>Or perhaps the Palace Master possessed a spiritual treasure or some other powerful means that instilled such fear in Bing Yao.</p><p>Facing Yin Changsheng, the Solar Divine Tree might not offer much of an advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang would do his best to avoid conflict with Yin Changsheng, but he still needed to prepare.</p><p>In battles at the Great Cultivator level, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could only serve as an early warning system. Its Heavenly Eye ability could no longer secretly observe the opponent without detection.</p><p>Breaking through to the mid-fourth transformation might allow it to evade a Great Cultivator's spiritual senses.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>That's all for today's chapters.</p><p>Suddenly gaining five alliance leaders has left me utterly bewildered.</p><p>Many thanks to the great leader Watermelon Taro Cut for the alliance leader support.</p><p>Many thanks to the great leader Favorite Char Siu Bao for the four alliance leader supports.</p><p>The pressure is immense, but I'll keep striving!</p>
