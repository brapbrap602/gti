<h1>Chapter 409: Good News</h1><p>The flying fish-dragons still gathered and swam in the dark pool.</p><p>I wonder if Yun Youzi was curious why the tranquil pool had suddenly expanded several times?</p><p>Qin Sang secretly dropped the Drunken Demon Saliva, avoiding the flying fish-dragons' perception, and returned the same way.</p><p>He didn't meet Yun Youzi along the way, so Qin Sang left alone and successfully arrived at the plain before the inner valley barrier.</p><p>Within the mountain, the habitat of the Star Poison Frogs was Qin Sang's only worry, fearing that the two Wuji Sect Masters had already returned and he would happen to meet them there.</p><p>However, staying in the inner valley was even more dangerous, so Qin Sang gritted his teeth and entered the mountain.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no such coincidences, and Qin Sang left the inner valley safely.</p><p>Stopping and going along the way, Qin Sang took a full ten days to leave Wuyaya Valley and head straight for Qingyang Market Town.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>He had made an appointment with Yun Youzi to meet here after leaving Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>Yun Youzi had successfully collected the Nightfall Lily, so Qin Sang wasn't worried.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Yun Youzi might be refining the elixir on the spot within Wuyaya Valley; after all, it was a dream treasure, and finally seeing the dawn of healing his hidden injury, Yun Youzi was certainly eager as well.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang patiently waited in Qingyang Market Town.</p><p>During these days, he didn't stay in his cave dwelling to cultivate, but frequently went out to inquire about the Qingyang Demon Sect, especially the Qingyang Gangying within the Qingyang Demon Sect!</p><p>Nine days later.</p><p>Qin Sang returned from outside, just about to open his cave dwelling, when his eyes suddenly narrowed, then brightened.  He pushed open the door and saw Yun Youzi sitting calmly inside.</p><p>Yun Youzi was radiant, his complexion significantly better than before, without a trace of his old age.</p><p>Even more surprising was his realm; he was already at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, on par with Qin Sang.</p><p>He had finally crossed this threshold!</p><p>"Congratulations, senior, on healing your hidden injury!"</p><p>Qin Sang was also happy for Yun Youzi and repeatedly congratulated him.</p><p>Because of his hidden injury, although Yun Youzi had profound cultivation, he had always been unable to break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. This is why he had reluctantly stopped cultivating and traveled everywhere, searching for elixirs and medicines.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected that in less than a month, Yun Youzi had not only refined the Nightfall Lily, but its effects were so immediate that it directly broke through the bottleneck.</p><p>"Thanks to Brother Qin!"</p><p>With his biggest worry resolved, Yun Youzi's eyes also held unconcealable joy. He stood up and bowed to Qin Sang. "Although the injury isn't fully healed, at least before the Pill Condensation stage, I, old man, don't have to worry about my cultivation being limited by the hidden injury. I can return to my sect and cultivate with peace of mind for a while!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly upon hearing this. "Senior, after taking the elixir, you haven't actually cured your hidden injury?"</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head.</p><p>"The Nightfall Lily I took, while a heavenly treasure, isn't the right medicine for my hidden injury.  Fortunately, its effects are powerful and still played a great role, solving my immediate problem. I'm already very satisfied.</p><p>"Moreover, although I have a soul injury, it may not affect Pill Condensation.  The specific situation will only be known after the False Core stage.</p><p>"However, by then, I will be no longer an ordinary person. Even if it does affect Pill Condensation, finding other healing elixirs will be much easier."</p><p>Yun Youzi stood tall, his expression and tone full of confidence and fighting spirit, without a trace of doubt.</p><p>Qin Sang was infected by Yun Youzi's emotions and nodded slightly. He also believed that with Yun Youzi's personality and ability, he would surely be able to fulfill his wishes and resolve the hidden danger!</p><p>"Brother Qin, I am limited by age and am fighting against the heavens; I dare not delay my cultivation. Now that I've finally resolved this hidden danger, I must return to my sect to cultivate first. I wonder if Brother Qin could give me some time? After I solidify my cultivation, I will go and request the Harmony Pill?" Yun Youzi said somewhat embarrassedly.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "Senior, don't worry. My injuries don't affect my cultivation. I only need you to help me find a Harmony Pill before I prepare to condense my pill. Senior, please prioritize your own cultivation. In the future, if I encounter difficulties, I may have to rely on you."</p><p>Yun Youzi breathed a sigh of relief and said solemnly, "Thank you, Brother! Brother, rest assured, if you have any difficulties in the future, just send a message to the Taiyi Dan Sect, and I will do my utmost! When I return, I will go to Cuiming Mountain to see Li Yu Fu and take him as a disciple. I hope this child can endure the loneliness of the immortal path and live up to your expectations!"</p><p>Then, the two talked about some trivial matters, and Qin Sang also seized the opportunity to ask Yun Youzi many questions about cultivation.</p><p>Yun Youzi had just broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, his cultivation inferior to Qin Sang's, but he saw through many problems very clearly and more than adequately guided Qin Sang, allowing Qin Sang to benefit greatly.</p><p>"Little brother, are you interested in Heavenly Gan Gang Essence?"</p><p>Yun Youzi found Qin Sang's question about Heavenly Gan Gang Essence a little strange, but he didn't ask further.  After a moment's thought, he said, "Although Heavenly Gan Gang Qi is as famous as Earth Fiend Qi, the Heavenly Gan Gang Essence formed from it in the mortal realm is far rarer than Earth Fiend Yin Veins. To my knowledge, there are only two places in the entire Xiaohan region where Heavenly Gan Gang Essence exists! One is the Qingyang Demon Sect."</p><p>Yun Youzi pointed north, towards the Qingyang Demon Sect's mountain gate.</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted. After days of searching, he realized Heavenly Gan Gang Essence was far rarer than he imagined. His extensive search had yielded no useful information.</p><p>"Where is the other place?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang meaningfully, shaking his head. "Brother Qin, I don't know why you seek Heavenly Gan Gang Essence. Let me advise you: unless absolutely necessary, it's best not to target those two places."</p><p>"The Qingyang Demon Sect needs no explanation.  Qingyang Gang Essence is vital to the Qingyang Demon Fire, the sect's foundation, and its most heavily guarded area."</p><p>"The other location of Heavenly Gan Gang Essence, while not a demonic sect, is far more dangerous. It's within the cave abode of the current strongest cultivator in the Xiaohan region, the Pure Yang Sect Master!"</p><p>"The Pure Yang Sect Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, his heart shocked.</p><p>The Pure Yang Sect is the foremost of the eight righteous sects, thanks to the Sect Master's immense strength.  Rumor has it he is the strongest cultivator in the Xiaohan region, a powerful Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't dare to target the Pure Yang Sect Master even if given a hundred chances!</p><p>"A Nascent Soul's cave abode, built upon Heavenly Gan Gang Essence? Why?"</p><p>Qin Sang was frustrated. He had hoped to obtain Heavenly Gan Gang Essence in advance, as a precaution.</p><p>Wu Shang mentioned in his letter that Heavenly Gan Gang Essence was difficult to find, but who would have thought there were only two locations in the whole Xiaohan region, and both occupied by such powerful individuals!</p><p>Yun Youzi said, "Legend says the Pure Yang Sect Master's cultivation method is unique, requiring Heavenly Gan Gang Qi for cultivation. Some suspect this cultivation method is the reason he became the strongest in the Xiaohan region. If that's true, the Pure Yang Sect Master will likely be reluctant to part with it. However...if Brother Qin could ask your sect's Nascent Soul ancestor to intervene and request some Heavenly Gan Gang Essence, they probably wouldn't refuse Dongyang Bo's face."</p><p>"Senior, you're joking. I wouldn't have that kind of influence..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed wryly.</p>
