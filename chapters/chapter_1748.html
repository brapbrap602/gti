<h1>Chapter 1739: Human Field</h1><p>The cabin was sealed off by a barrier, isolating the noisy waves outside. In the silent space, an unfamiliar voice suddenly rang out, saying, "You are going to die." In such a situation, one could imagine how terrifying it was. Especially when Qin Sang realized that the voice was coming from the Sun God Tree, he felt a chill run down his spine, almost breaking out in a cold sweat. In an instant, Qin Sang's mind raced with countless thoughts, and his entire body tensed up. Fortunately, he had good composure and didn't lose his cool on the spot.</p><p>"Who are you?" Qin Sang stared at the Sun God Tree, confirming that the voice was indeed coming from within the tree.</p><p>"Just as you think," the voice of a young girl rang out again, her tone meaningful and profound, then she emphasized, "You are going to die!"</p><p>This time, Qin Sang saw it clearly. As the voice spoke, the nine divine birds perched on the branches of the Sun God Tree suddenly turned their heads, all staring directly at him. Being stared at by nine pairs of fiery eyes would make anyone's hair stand on end. Each word spoken by the other party was accompanied by one of the divine birds opening its beak, and the next word was spoken by the next bird. In this way, the entire sentence was spoken in turn by the nine divine birds, but it flowed seamlessly, as if it were one entity. The other party likely had the ability to control the Sun God Birds. If all nine birds attacked at such close range, the consequences would be unimaginable. Yet, Qin Sang did not dodge, only remaining on guard.</p><p>The Sun God Tree had been following him for hundreds of years. If the other party had been lurking by his side for so long and wanted to harm him, they wouldn't have waited until now.</p><p>"Are you the spirit of the Vermilion Bird?" Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>The Sun God Tree was something he had personally refined, but it was quite different from a normal magical treasure. The method of refining this treasure was derived from the techniques passed down by the Ancestor of Kuiyin, similar to the Ten Directions Yama Banners. It should be considered a container for the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird. Due to the violent power of the South Ming Li Fire within the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird, it required the core of the Sun God Tree, a piece of green bronze, to suppress it. Along with the shell of the Nine-Life Mystic Turtle and other spiritual materials, it was pieced together. The Sun God Tree couldn't be considered a true magical treasure. Qin Sang's intention was to refine the South Ming Li Fire, and he had never used secret techniques to refine it. Under normal circumstances, it shouldn't have developed its own consciousness.</p><p>There was only one possibility—the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird!</p><p>After obtaining the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird, Qin Sang had used the Sun God Tree many times to repel powerful enemies. However, he could only control the Sun God Birds formed by the aura of the South Ming Li Fire and had never been able to touch the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird itself. Later, he tried multiple times to refine the South Ming Li Fire using the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique, but all attempts failed. In truth, he knew nothing about the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>"Did you hear what I said?" The Vermilion Bird Spirit seemed somewhat impatient. "I'm not lying to you. You really are going to die!"</p><p>Such words didn't sound like they came from a cunning old ghost who had been lurking for years. It sounded more like a child throwing a tantrum. Or was it deliberately pretending?</p><p>A strange light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes as he exhaled softly. "My lifespan is not yet exhausted, and I have no powerful enemies. Why would I die?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit let out two cold laughs, but because its voice was so crisp and childlike, it gave off a sense of innocence and cuteness. "No powerful enemy is chasing you. You're bringing death upon yourself!"</p><p>As if feeling that this threat wasn't enough, the Vermilion Bird Spirit added, "You have the aura of a Qilin on you!"</p><p>But to its disappointment, Qin Sang's expression didn't change much. There was no fear in his eyes, only confusion and bewilderment. Qin Sang had no idea what it was talking about!</p><p>The Qilin, a legendary divine beast, was said to be no less powerful than dragons and phoenixes in ancient texts. Qin Sang had encountered many divine beasts—the True Feather of the Vermilion Bird and the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix were right beside him, and he had even absorbed the blood of the Azure Luan to reshape his phoenix wings. But where did the Qilin come from?</p><p>"I don't understand what you're saying," Qin Sang replied honestly.</p><p>"Hmph! Hmph! By the time you understand, it will be too late. The Qilin has already awakened within you. Or, as you would say, it's a possession!" The Vermilion Bird Spirit's tone was low, but it felt like it was trying its hardest to create a terrifying atmosphere to scare Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, and he suddenly let out a cold snort. "I have never seen any Qilin. Stop trying to scare me! You've been lurking by my side for so many years, and now you suddenly reveal yourself. What is your true purpose?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit spoke in a tone of exasperation, "I revealed myself to save you! In a short while, the Qilin Seed within you will awaken, and there will be no turning back!"</p><p>"Qilin Seed?" Qin Sang was stunned, feeling that this was becoming more and more absurd.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the divine birds on the Sun God Tree shifted their gaze from him to the fire lotus floating beside him. His heart suddenly stirred.</p><p>"Are you talking about this?" Qin Sang pointed at the fire lotus, his expression finally changing.</p><p>"The aura is faint, likely because it has been dormant for too long, but it is definitely the Qilin!" The Vermilion Bird Spirit muttered a few words, then raised its voice. "When the fire lotus blooms, it will be the moment the Qilin Seed awakens. The Qilin will be born from the lotus platform and return to the world. Although you are its creator, it won't be grateful to you. Instead, it will devour you first!"</p><p>Fire lotus, lotus platform...</p><p>Qin Sang had been cultivating the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" technique for many years, so of course he knew what these represented. This secret technique was divided into three levels: the first level condensed the fire lotus seed, the second level gave birth to the fire lotus, and the third level transformed the lotus into a lotus platform! According to the Vermilion Bird Spirit, when he painstakingly cultivated this technique to the third level and formed the lotus platform, achieving the pinnacle of the technique, he would be replaced by the Qilin. Wouldn't that make him a human field for nurturing the Qilin Seed, with the spiritual fire as the nourishment, and all of it willingly sought out by him?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grim. The "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus" was the most powerful soul-refining technique he had ever encountered. As long as he refined enough spiritual fire, he could possess divine sense far beyond his cultivation level, which had greatly aided him in breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. Who would have thought it was a trap all along?</p><p>But what exactly was the Qilin Seed? It couldn't be that everyone who cultivated this technique would have a Qilin awaken within them.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately thought of the transparent lotus seed, something he had once thought was useless and had even almost traded away!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reaction, the Vermilion Bird Spirit said with satisfaction, "Now you understand the severity, don't you? Your fire lotus has already formed so many petals, which means your cultivation level is quite high. The Qilin Seed has already taken root and sprouted. Otherwise, why do you think it was so easy to cultivate?"</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, senior," Qin Sang's expression changed several times before he finally spoke, even addressing the other party as "senior," as if he had been thoroughly frightened.</p><p>In truth, he only half-believed it.</p><p>During his cultivation of the "Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus," he had never noticed anything unusual. Was the technique easy to cultivate? Qin Sang didn't think so. Being able to obtain divine sense far beyond his cultivation level, rivaling that of a Nascent Soul cultivator while still in the Core Formation stage, was undoubtedly due to the profoundness of the technique, but it was also thanks to the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was not of this world, and it was almost impossible for others to obtain such a high-grade demonic fire. If Qin Sang had to gather spiritual fire bit by bit, who knows how long it would have taken.</p><p>Looking back on his cultivation journey, he had encountered bottlenecks many times and had been forced to use various rare spiritual materials to break through. However, could it be related to the fact that he hadn't kept the transparent lotus seed within his body?</p><p>At the beginning of his cultivation, Qin Sang had placed great importance on the transparent lotus seed, repeatedly testing it. He felt that the transparent lotus seed could assist in condensing spiritual fire, preventing the cultivator from burning their soul, and had a protective effect on the soul. Refining spiritual fire into the Purple Mansion and condensing the fire lotus seed with the soul was, of course, extremely dangerous. But Qin Sang had the Jade Buddha to protect him, so he didn't need to rely on anything else. He had suffered similar losses before, and seeing no need to keep the transparent lotus seed in his Purple Mansion, he stored it away.</p><p>According to the Vermilion Bird Spirit, the Qilin Seed gradually awakened during the cultivator's practice, perhaps showing unexpected benefits, making subsequent cultivation less difficult than his own. Little did he know, the faster one cultivated, the faster one would die!</p><p>"Warning you is useless. The Qilin Seed is gradually awakening. You are already beyond saving, unable to stop its awakening. It's only a matter of time!" The Vermilion Bird Spirit seemed to sigh for Qin Sang, but its tone couldn't hide a hint of rising excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "Senior, are you saying that even if I stop cultivating this technique now, there's no way to save myself?"</p><p>"Exactly!" The nine Sun God Birds nodded in unison. "Unless you kill yourself first, forcing it to find another host, you are doomed! Only I can save you here!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang knew full well that the other party was waiting for him to beg for help. The Vermilion Bird Spirit's intentions were too obvious. Qin Sang played along, bowing solemnly and saying, "Please, senior, save me!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit chuckled, and the nine divine birds on the tree moved as if they wanted to spread their wings and dance, but in the end, they didn't take flight. Qin Sang's eyes flickered, but his expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit said, "I have a method that can help you suppress the Qilin Seed without damaging your cultivation, and it will also save you from the disaster of possession."</p><p>"Since senior has revealed yourself, you must have good intentions and can't bear to see me suffer. You wish to save me from this calamity. But I wonder, what must I do for senior to pass down this method to me?" Qin Sang's tone was respectful, and his expression was pleading.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was being cooperative, the Vermilion Bird Spirit was pleased. "As long as you agree to do three... no... four... four things for me, I will save you!"</p><p>Each sentence from the Vermilion Bird Spirit was spoken in turn by the nine divine birds. In the middle of its speech, it changed from three things to four, as if the birds were arguing, making it quite peculiar.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned strange. "What are the four things? Please enlighten me, senior."</p><p>If the situation were reversed, and someone else's life was in his hands, wouldn't he be able to manipulate them as he pleased? Why would he need to make specific demands? Was the Vermilion Bird Spirit truly naive, or was it toying with him?</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit spoke quickly, "First, I will teach you how to suppress the Qilin Seed. You must follow my instructions and help me extract the essence from the Qilin Seed."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. "Is this essence useful to you, senior?"</p><p>"It can help me recover..." The Vermilion Bird Spirit caught itself and quickly changed its tone. "You've worked hard, so I won't take all the essence. Moreover, extracting the essence must go through you, so it will also bring you great benefits."</p><p>Qin Sang pretended to be clueless and nodded. "What is the second condition?"</p><p>"Give me that feather!" The Sun God Birds all turned to look at the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix in Qin Sang's hand, their fiery eyes flickering, making the surroundings feel hotter.</p><p>So it was after the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix! Qin Sang had already guessed as much. The Vermilion Bird Spirit hadn't revealed itself earlier or later, but chose to appear just as he obtained the True Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p>"Is this feather also a divine beast seed, containing the essence of a phoenix?" Qin Sang glanced at the broken feather in his hand and paused. "One Qilin is enough to make me die without a burial site. I dare not let a Heavenly Phoenix enter my body as well."</p><p>"You don't need to ask so many questions. As long as you give me this feather and follow my commands, I will ensure your safety." The Vermilion Bird Spirit suddenly became tight-lipped.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn't get any more information, Qin Sang hesitated and said, "Earlier, I tried to refine the demonic fire within the feather but failed, as you saw. Now, I don't dare to continue cultivating the 'Seed of Fire, Golden Lotus,' and I don't have the bloodline of a phoenix, so I can't refine or control it. This treasure is like a chicken rib to me—useless but not something I can easily part with. I need to hear your other conditions first. If you make demands that I can't fulfill, I can't agree so easily. I would rather die with it."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit snorted. "My next conditions will bring you unimaginable benefits, opportunities that others can only dream of. How dare you hesitate!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out an "oh" and listened attentively.</p><p>The nine divine birds raised their heads, looking quite proud. "This Qilin was able to condense a seed, so its cultivation level in life must have been extremely high. Perhaps it encountered a powerful enemy and had no choice but to escape using the seed, ending up here. It must have hidden its origin essence somewhere else. Once it awakens and retrieves its origin essence, it will quickly regain its strength."</p><p>"Qilin origin essence?" Qin Sang was intrigued.</p><p>Although he didn't know what level the Qilin had reached in life, the fact that it could exist in seed form for countless years and set a trap in a technique that even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't detect spoke volumes about its power!</p><p>"The Qilin origin essence must be hidden very deeply, but it is definitely connected to the Qilin Seed. We can use the seed to find it. After I extract the essence and help you refine the seed, you will definitely sense something. As long as you help me find the Qilin origin essence, I will reward you accordingly and share some with you."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit's voice was crisp and enticing. "The Qilin origin essence is a rare treasure of the world. It can completely transform you!"</p><p>"This..." Qin Sang hesitated. "The Qilin is a divine beast, and I am a human. Our bloodlines are too different. I'm afraid I won't be able to refine it, right?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit said disdainfully, "The Qilin origin essence is the purest power in the world. As long as the Qilin's imprint is erased, anyone can refine it. Even if you can't handle it, I, with my word as my bond, will find a way to help you when the time comes!"</p><p>Its tone was confident, but Qin Sang could tell that the Vermilion Bird Spirit wasn't entirely sure. Perhaps the existence of the Qilin origin essence was also uncertain, all just speculation by the Vermilion Bird Spirit.</p><p>"What is the fourth condition?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit hesitated for a moment before saying, "The fourth condition... I haven't thought of it yet. But don't worry, I still need you to help me find the Qilin origin essence, so I won't ask you to do anything beyond your capabilities. From now on, you must not leave my side. Follow my commands and focus on refining the Qilin Seed and searching for the Qilin origin essence."</p><p>It seemed to be already dreaming of a bright future, speaking faster and faster, the nine divine birds becoming more animated, chattering away.</p><p>"Once we find the Qilin origin essence, not only will I share some with you, but I will also accept your offerings. As long as you provide enough tribute, I will continue to protect you and your descendants!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
