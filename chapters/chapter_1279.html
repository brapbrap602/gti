<h1>Chapter 1271: Delivering the Message</h1><p>This place was once a Blood Prison, a land of execution grounds. Even after countless years of being sealed, one could still sense the brutality and bloodshed from the ruins scattered across the area. The heavens and earth were dyed in a crimson hue. The blood mist was thick, and a sinister, malevolent energy permeated the air. Those who ventured here felt as though they were submerged in a sea of blood, the chilling cold piercing to the bone. An oppressive and eerie atmosphere surrounded them, causing their minds to tense involuntarily. Ancient seals were everywhere, but the true danger was not these seals—it was the living creatures. The monsters born from such a sinister and blood-soaked land were inherently chaotic, bloodthirsty, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>Fortunately, since entering the Blood Mist Basin, aside from the flesh puppets within the Black Tower Formation, they had not encountered any living monsters. Even the flesh puppets were mindless, soulless husks. However, the moment they broke through the Blood Gate, everyone's expressions changed. The formation ahead also paused slightly. Their worst fears had come true.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The earth trembled. From the depths of the blood mist, deafening roars echoed from all directions. It sounded as though countless massive beasts were charging, their footsteps shaking the ground. Along with the roars, there were intermittent howls—some distant and indistinct, while others seemed to be circling nearby. The blood mist and ancient seals obscured their vision, leaving the monsters' true forms unknown. Only the thunderous roars and howls reverberated in their ears, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>Why had this sudden change occurred? The group looked around in confusion, feeling as though they were already surrounded by monsters. Their eyes met a world of blood, yet they could not see the creatures. However, they noticed ripples coming from deep within the blood mist, causing it to churn chaotically. For a moment, panic spread among them. Though they were among the top experts of their time, the cultivation world was filled with beings that could threaten them, especially in places like the Blood Lake and the Purple Palace. Similar tragedies had happened more than once.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he recalled the unknown monster he and Dongyang Bo had disturbed at the bottom of the Blood River. When they left the Blood River, he had deliberately lingered outside for a while. Seeing that the monster showed no signs of activity after awakening, he had waited until the river calmed before leaving on his own. Could this be his doing? Qin Sang wondered. At that time, only one monster had awakened. Now, who knew how many lurked in the depths of the blood mist? If they all possessed strength comparable to that monster, their situation would be extremely perilous!</p><p>The formation paused briefly before plunging into the blood mist. Their pursuers were relentless, and they had no time to worry about the monsters within the mist. Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances and unanimously decided to stop, watching as the formation disappeared from view. Investigating the cause of the anomaly, understanding the monsters' origins, and escaping danger as quickly as possible were their top priorities. They had no intention of becoming collateral damage for the Old Demon Ye.</p><p>At that moment, a figure suddenly emerged from the blood mist. Seeing this person, a strange light flickered in Qin Sang's eyes. The others were equally surprised. It was Dongyang Bo, who had been missing for some time! Dongyang Bo was still dressed in his elegant brocade robe, his demeanor refined as ever. However, his face bore an unnatural pallor, as though he had been injured, though his aura remained stable.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what happened?" The group stepped out of the formation, their eyes fixed on Dongyang Bo. A few subtle glances were exchanged between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, their expressions unreadable. Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought. Earlier, when Qin Sang had revealed his identity, some of the more astute among them had begun to wonder if Dongyang Bo's sudden disappearance was related to Qin Sang. After all, Qin Sang had forced the Old Demon Ye to self-destruct an avatar. If he had planned it, he certainly had the capability to kill Dongyang Bo. The image of Qin Sang sacrificing the Blood Demon Avatar and revealing his true appearance was deeply etched in their minds. No one was foolish enough to confront him directly. Driving away a top expert who had just made a significant contribution would be unwise. If he were to defect to the Sin Abyss or the Heavenly Demon Region, it would be a disaster. Besides, there was no evidence. No one knew the full extent of the grievances between this former master and disciple, or whether it had escalated to a life-and-death struggle.</p><p>Dongyang Bo approached the group, his eyes narrowing slightly when he saw Qin Sang without his mask. However, his expression quickly returned to normal as he said, "The monsters in the Blood Lake have awakened. I was injured and surrounded by them, which delayed me from meeting the agreed time. Fortunately, I followed the markers left by you all and found this place. These monsters are bloodthirsty and insane, and there are some truly terrifying beings among them. We cannot stay here any longer. Follow me, and let's leave quickly!"</p><p>Some secretly observed the interaction between Dongyang Bo and Qin Sang. Both of their expressions were calm, as though they hadn't noticed each other. Dongyang Bo seemed to have already known Qin Sang's identity, which only deepened their suspicions. There was definitely something between these two! However, now was not the time to dwell on such trivial matters.</p><p>"Everything was normal when we entered. Fellow Daoist, do you know when these monsters appeared? Why did they suddenly awaken? What is their origin?" Tongyou Demon Lord frowned, firing off a series of questions.</p><p>Dongyang Bo replied, "Beneath this land lies a network of countless blood rivers, crisscrossing and flowing with blood mist. These monsters were sleeping at the bottom of the blood rivers. At first, only a few awakened and wandered within the rivers, likely disturbed by our breaking of the seals. But not long ago, something happened. All the ancient seals in the Blood Lake began to tremble, and the monsters suddenly awakened simultaneously, rushing to the surface..."</p><p>After clarifying the timeline, Qing Jun said gravely, "That was when the Old Demon Ye broke the prison seal!"</p><p>"Could they be Blood Prison guards similar to the flesh puppets? The destruction of the core seal affected the entire Blood Lake?" Tongyou Demon Lord quickly asked Dongyang Bo about the monsters' appearance. Indeed, they closely resembled the flesh puppets.</p><p>"When we passed through the Black Tower Formation earlier, the flesh puppets did seem a bit off," someone recalled. The Sin Abyss forces, desperate to escape, had deliberately avoided the flesh puppets in the Black Tower Formation, so they hadn't noticed anything unusual. They immediately returned to the Blood Gate to confirm this. The flesh puppets were restrained by the Black Tower Formation and were not as frenzied as the monsters outside. If every monster possessed strength comparable to the flesh puppets, they were in serious trouble! They had originally planned to explore the Black Tower Formation in detail after dealing with the Old Demon Ye, but now, with this unexpected turn of events, they dared not stay any longer.</p><p>"Our only option now is to leave the Blood Lake as quickly as possible and restore its seals. We can only hope that these monsters won't leave the Blood Lake on their own. If they escape, not only will the Cold Domain bear the brunt, but the entire North Star Realm might face a catastrophe," Dongyang Bo sighed. "When the monsters emerged earlier, I sensed several extremely powerful auras, far surpassing ours. We cannot fight them."</p><p>After suppressing his injuries, Dongyang Bo had chosen to stay rather than return to the Cold Domain. This decision was the result of careful consideration. Anyone who had witnessed Qin Sang's strength would think twice about opposing him. Moreover, Qin Sang was not alone—he had ties with the demon race and an ally in Qing Jun. If Qin Sang chose to act, he would undoubtedly shine in the battle against the Sin Abyss. In that case, the contrast between a deserter and a hero would be stark, and it was clear which side the various forces of the Cold Domain would favor. While they might not fully side with Qin Sang, Mount Shaohua would undoubtedly be put in a difficult position, and years of effort would be wasted.</p>
