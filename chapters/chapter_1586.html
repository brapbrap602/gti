<h1>Chapter 1577 Ascension</h1><p>Chapter 1577 Ascension</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The sound of cracking ice echoed through the ice cave.</p><p>The pink lightning failed to penetrate the protective barrier, dissipating into countless threads that snaked towards Qin Sang's feet, seeping into the ice.</p><p>The lightning possessed a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>A large hole was instantly corroded beneath Qin Sang.  Wherever the stray threads touched, the ice silently dissolved, the effect spreading far and wide.  A large section of the ice collapsed.</p><p>This ice cave was a place where chilling煞 energy gathered. The ice here contained this energy.  This free-flowing煞 energy was different from that within the ice crystals. Qin Sang surmised that the煞 energy within the crystals had been transformed by a spirit array, making it directly usable for cultivation by cultivators.</p><p>However, even the impure煞 energy that formed this ice was far harder than ordinary ice found elsewhere.  Being struck by the pink lightning would have had unimaginable consequences.</p><p>The female cultivator’s attack was so ruthless, directly aiming to kill them.  How could Qin Sang and Yan Shan Old Man not be enraged?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yan Shan Old Man.  Earlier, Qin Sang had specifically asked if there were any large factions near the snowy plains.</p><p>Yan Shan Old Man had answered definitively that there were none.</p><p>In his pursuit of the snow fox, Yan Shan Old Man had frequently entered and exited the snowy plains, thoroughly investigating the area.  No matter how much commotion they made, no one would arrive for quite some time.</p><p>That’s why they'd felt safe breaking through the ice and pursuing the snow fox.</p><p>But now a strange female cultivator had appeared, and her cultivation was incredibly high—mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally labelled her a “妖女” (female demon), not just to vent his anger.  Even though the woman was ruthless, Qin Sang had to admit that her every movement and expression was captivatingly alluring.  Qin Sang was certain it wasn’t a charm technique; it was a natural allure, enough to cause chaos in the land.</p><p>“Humph! She escaped quickly!”</p><p>Yue Fei, her attack having missed, sneered, darting to a corner of the ice cave and remaining still, seemingly guarding against a counterattack from Qin Sang and the other.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to ask Yan Shan Old Man about the woman's identity when he noticed something amiss, a bad feeling washing over him.  He unleashed his Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade with a powerful strike.</p><p>The blade energy surged, aimed at the empty space beside the ice crystal pillar.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The ice layer on the ground bulged slightly, and an ice pillar grew from it—a perfect replica of Yue Fei.</p><p>The ice statue's eyelashes fluttered, and the ice transformed into flesh and blood. Yue Fei, using some unknown secret technique, was closing in on the ice crystal right before their eyes.</p><p>Ignoring the blade energy behind her, Yue Fei reached for the ice pillar, a pearl hidden in her palm.</p><p>The pink lightning originated from this pearl.</p><p>A crackling sound filled the air.</p><p>Yue Fei concentrated the countless tiny threads of lightning in her palm, aiming them at the ice pillar, trying to shatter it and take the ice crystal inside.</p><p>However, the lightning struck the pillar without leaving a mark.</p><p>Yue Fei was stunned, then noticed the spirit array beneath her glowing brightly. A blue light, like a sharp sword, shot from inside the ice pillar, straight towards her face.</p><p>With an ice sword in front and the divine blade behind, Yue Fei’s expression shifted drastically.  Realizing she couldn't forcibly take the ice crystal, she remained calm and threw her veil, transforming it into a colorful cloud, using this magical treasure to defend against both attacks simultaneously.</p><p>‘Pfft! Pfft!’</p><p>The ice sword and the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade struck in succession.</p><p>The cloud first entangled the ice sword, and as the cloud was about to crush the ice sword, the following divine blade struck its weak point.</p><p>The veil could no longer hold, the cloud collapsing, countless fragments scattering to the ground.  A high-quality protective treasure was destroyed.</p><p>Yue Fei retreated, escaping at the cost of a magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly saw what happened and understood. The woman's cultivation path was the same as the ice spirit, also focused on ice, which explained her covetousness towards the ice crystal.</p><p>"So she's just a thief!"</p><p>Yan Shan Old Man, having only just seen Yue Fei approach the ice crystal, had been startled. Fortunately, the pillar had protective restrictions.</p><p>The attacker clearly didn't understand these restrictions.</p><p>His shock giving way to fury, Yan Shan Old Man immediately flung out his thin rope, aiming for Yue Fei's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang was also filled with anger.</p><p>The female cultivator, not even the owner of this place, dared to attack. She truly didn't know what death was!</p><p>"Who are you, demoness? State your name!" Yan Shan Old Man roared.</p><p>The thin rope moved like a snake.  While seemingly aimed at Yue Fei's forehead, as Yue Fei prepared to defend, the attack changed, emitting ripples.</p><p>These ripples had a binding effect, used previously by Yan Shan Old Man to capture the snow fox.</p><p>The woman, Yuefei, ignored the Elder Yanshan, her gaze fixed on the ice crystal, clearly unconvinced.  She only retracted her stare when she sensed an approaching attack. Quickly, she removed a silver bracelet from her wrist and flicked it. The bracelet vibrated, shattering the incoming wave of energy and shielding a thin, silken thread, engaging in a fierce, evenly matched struggle.</p><p>Elder Yanshan dropped his initial disdain. "This woman possesses considerable treasures, suggesting a significant background.  I wonder if she has accomplices. Fellow Daoist, act quickly!"</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't follow the elder's instructions.  Instead, he said gravely, "Fellow Daoist, should be able to hold her off, yes? I consider myself proficient in array formations, and my unique eye technique is helpful in breaking them.  Give me some time, and we shall share the ice crystal equally afterwards."</p><p>Qin Sang observed Elder Yanshan as he spoke.  The appearance of this mysterious woman right after discovering the ice crystal…was it merely coincidence?  His suspicion of the elder grew.  Securing the crystal was his priority. Dealing with the woman could wait until afterwards. His main body was outside and could sense any approaching experts, so he wasn’t immediately concerned.</p><p>Elder Yanshan paused, exchanging a look with Qin Sang before nodding. "Very well! As the Daoist suggests! My abilities are limited; I fear I might be no match for her. Daoist, please don’t hold back!"</p><p>With that, Elder Yanshan leaped forward towards Yuefei, his three-headed dragon shield used as a weapon.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The three-headed dragon shield turned into three streaks of black light, whirling around Yuefei in a dazzling display.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if he was overthinking things. Dismissing his doubts, he moved to the ice pillar, working with his Tianmu butterfly to decipher the spirit array on the ice surface.</p><p>Initially, the densely packed runes made him dizzy. But soon, a surprising discovery emerged. The array's creator possessed exceptional skill in ice-based formations, infusing the array with chilling煞 energy.  Having previously refined an ice crystal, he realized this was the key to breaking the array.</p><p>Both Elder Yanshan and the woman were mid-Yuan Ying stage cultivators. Even if the elder couldn't defeat her, holding her off shouldn’t be a problem. Of course, Qin Sang remained vigilant against unforeseen events.</p><p>Gradually, he made headway, his hand forming a loose fist. His Snow-Stepping Blade shrunk to the size of a dagger, its blade energy contained.  He placed it on the ground and began to etch into the array.</p><p>Wherever the blade tip passed, a white mark remained, the blade energy condensing into runes that severed the connections within the spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang worked quickly, pausing occasionally to reflect.  He was close to breaking the array when a cry startled him.</p><p>Looking over, he saw that the two had stopped fighting. Elder Yanshan stared at Yuefei's forehead, his expression shocked. "The Moonlit Mark! You are a Moonlit Guard of Luye?"</p><p>Elder Yanshan's previous attack on Yuefei's forehead had forced out a blood-red moon mark.</p><p>The Moonlit Mark.</p><p>Luye.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Which Luye?</p><p>Following Elder Yanshan's gaze, Qin Sang also saw the blood-red moon on the woman's forehead.</p><p>Elder Yanshan transmitted a voice message.</p><p>"The cultivation world uses two markers to identify Luye's demonic cultivators: the Dragon-Slaying Devilish Energy and the Moonlit Mark on their foreheads, known as the Moonlit Guards. However, the Old Devil Lu has disappeared for centuries, and the Moonlit Guards have rarely been seen, their numbers dwindling…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood, but his apprehension intensified.</p><p>The woman had such a powerful background!  A Moonlit Guard appearing in this ice cave…was the legendary Luye nearby?  Even more terrifying was the possibility that the ice cave's spirit array and the ice crystal were both the Old Devil Lu's handiwork!</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body and transformed body were both present, but he dared not challenge a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Yuefei let out a cold humph. "Knowing my identity, you still dare not retreat?"</p><p>Elder Yanshan's face flickered between pale and livid.  Suddenly remembering something, his shock subsided, replaced by a cold laugh.  "Outsiders fear the Old Devil Lu, not you Moonlit Guards! You are nothing more than expendable blood slaves, yet you dare call yourself 'this princess'? The Old Devil Lu never favored women, and centuries ago, this devil went to a meeting with righteous Nascent Soul cultivators in Central Plains. Afterwards, he vanished. Legend has it that the Eight Scenic Views and Ganlu Chan Monastery hold the secrets to ascension.  Whenever a Nascent Soul cultivator appears from the outer regions, they are invited to Central Plains.  Most, like the Old Devil Lu, disappear afterwards, rumored to have ascended. Since the Old Devil Lu has been missing for centuries, even if he hasn’t ascended, he must be in seclusion, preparing for ascension…"</p><p>The seductive smile on Yuefei's lips faded.</p><p>Yan Shan, his face suddenly enlightened, looked up and down at Yue Fei with disdain, sneering,  "After Lu Lao Mo achieved apotheosis, the Dark Moon Seal would transform into a full moon. The one within you couldn't possibly be his doing! Lu Lao Mo has a sworn son, rumored to be a womanizer, constantly collecting beauties.  Judging by your cultivation and looks, you must be a favorite.  But even the Dark Moon Seal refuses to release you.  Heh… ultimately, you're nothing more than a plaything!"</p><p>Qin Sang was still processing Yan Shan's words.</p><p>No cultivator would not yearn for ascension, yet Yan Shan's mention of 'ascension' was clearly different from the ancient understanding.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had an eight-character maxim—After apotheosis, one knows their destination.</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering this maxim's meaning, inquiring about the whereabouts of apotheosized cultivators in Central State after arriving, but only found vague legends.</p><p>Apotheosized cultivators were elusive, seemingly disappearing mysteriously, with no record of any perishing from heavenly tribulation or natural death.</p><p>We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p><p>With Xiao Xiangzi's maxim and these findings, Qin Sang ceased pondering the path after apotheosis, focusing on improving his cultivation and strength.</p><p>Is the place of ascension the same as the 'destination' in the maxim?</p><p>Apotheosis allows for 'ascension', and the Eight Views Pavilion and Ganlu Zen Temple know the secrets of ascension.</p><p>It seems that the Eight Views Pavilion and Ganlu Zen Temple's dominance as leaders of Daoism and Buddhism is not simply due to the frequent emergence of apotheosized cultivators within their ranks.</p><p>Yan Shan knows so many secrets.</p><p>Who is this person?</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed Yan Shan was an ascetic cultivator.</p><p>Rumors placed Lu Ye in the Northern Wastelands, and Yan Shan's cultivation grounds are also there; it's natural he'd know about Lu Lao Mo's adopted son, but the other secrets don't seem like something an ascetic could discover.</p><p>"Looking for death!"</p><p>An angry shout interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Yue Fei, stung to the quick, flew into a rage.  With a furious sweep of her hand, pink pearls shot towards Yan Shan's head.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>The pearls unleashed bolts of lightning, weaving into a net of electricity in mid-air, descending upon him!</p><p>The alluring妖女’s attacks grew increasingly fierce.</p><p>Yan Shan dared not be careless, his fingers lightly tapping his shield.</p><p>With a whistling sound, three dragon-head shields flew upwards, their tails connecting to form an odd triangular shield.  The three dragon mouths simultaneously spat water, creating a thick barrier.</p><p>'Psh! Psh! Psh!'</p><p>The electric net flashed into the water barrier.</p><p>The barrier instantly turned pink, resisting for a moment before being corroded away.</p><p>Seeing the danger, Yan Shan quickly changed his hand seals.</p><p>The dragon-head shields expanded, completely shielding Yan Shan as he endured the electric net directly.</p><p>There was a loud 'bang'.</p><p>The dragon-head shields trembled.</p><p>Yue Fei continued her relentless attack, the pearls continuously firing lightning, the electric light raining down, furiously assaulting the dragon-head shields.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yue Fei subtly moved her fingers.</p><p>The ice beneath Yan Shan's feet exploded, a dragon-like roar erupting from the ground, as an ice dragon burst forth from the shattered ice.</p><p>The ice dragon was long and slender, its entire body composed of ice—horns, claws, scales—all resembling a legendary true dragon.  Its presence was imposing and incredibly lifelike.</p><p>The ice dragon opened its jaws, aiming to bite Yan Shan's legs.</p><p>Yue Fei's every attack was deadly.</p><p>Yan Shan's face changed slightly; he shifted his hand, and a silver droplet fell from his palm, bursting beneath him into a cloud of silver mist.</p><p>The light mist, however, felt incredibly heavy.  The ice dragon collided with it, a metallic clang echoing as its momentum sharply decreased.</p><p>Yan Shan seized the opportunity to dodge, evading the dragon's jaws.</p><p>Yan Shan’s words enraged the妖女. Though prepared, he was still startled and urgently transmitted his voice, "That妖女 certainly wasn't sent by Lu Lao Mo!  Don't let her fool you! The Dark Moon Guards are actually Lu Lao Mo's slaves; countless Dark Moon slaves have died outside, and their deaths have never prompted Lu Lao Mo to seek revenge.  However, there are numerous skilled Dark Moon Guards, and if this drags on, she'll summon reinforcements—it will only become more troublesome.  Quickly take the Cold Crystal and leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>The situation demanded action.</p><p>Yan Shan had a point—as long as Lu Lao Mo didn't personally intervene, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the so-called adopted son and Dark Moon Guards.</p><p>The妖女 was clearly the one coveting the Cold Crystal.</p><p>Quickly take the crystal and leave—would Lu Lao Mo really leave seclusion for his adopted son's concubine?</p><p>Unlikely.</p><p>In the known world, only four apotheosized cultivators existed in Central State.</p><p>Dan Yu Zhenjun, Hui Guang Shengzhe, and the Yaozu Saint King had all disappeared.</p><p>Lu Lao Mo had vanished even earlier. Was he somehow exceptional, able to remain untouched by all this?</p>
