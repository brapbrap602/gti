<h1>Chapter 1894: Refining Emptiness</h1><p>The妖丹 entered his abdomen.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to refine it.</p><p>Since the Lei Zu's descent, Qin Sang felt himself undergoing a tremendous transformation.</p><p>Too many incidents had occurred before, leaving him no time for contemplation.</p><p>The more imminent the crisis, the more crucial it was to remain calm!</p><p>Qin Sang banished all distracting thoughts, entering a state of meditative concentration, recalling the events following Lei Zu's arrival.</p><p>Every detail, every subtle feeling, could not be missed.</p><p>Most memories were hazy, perceptions chaotic.</p><p>At that time, he had pointed to the heavens, condensing the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, instantly mobilizing the world's spiritual energy, transforming it into thunder…</p><p>Too many details were missing.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to integrate all his memories, seeking the deepest instinctive insights and feelings.</p><p>Suddenly, he raised both hands, palms facing the sky.</p><p>The spiritual energy around his hands immediately began to vibrate.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>The spiritual energy stirred, creating a gentle breeze that flowed between Qin Sang's fingers, the wind growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>Gradually, visible ripples appeared in the void, like wisps of ethereal green wind circling his hands, eventually giving rise to howling gales.</p><p>This phenomenon indicated the mobilization of spiritual energy, a sign of a cultivator's initial harmony with heaven and earth.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, cultivators could easily mobilize spiritual energy, benefiting their cultivation. For example, it greatly enhanced the power of their spells and divine abilities.</p><p>As their cultivation deepened, Nascent Soul cultivators could mobilize more spiritual energy, gradually pursuing the unity of heaven and man, until they reached the Refining Emptiness stage, mastering the heavens and earth!</p><p>Qin Sang's current mobilization of spiritual energy seemed impressive, but there was a world of difference between mobilization and control.</p><p>This was, unsurprisingly, his limit.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers trembled slightly, closing gently.  Two streams of spiritual energy were held in his palms.</p><p>These two streams solidified, then a small vortex appeared at their center.</p><p>They vibrated, rotating with the vortex, ultimately being assimilated!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>His ten fingers fully extended.</p><p>The vortex continuously devoured the surrounding spiritual energy; Qin Sang's hands seemed to be holding two whirlwinds.</p><p>This scene was almost indistinguishable from controlling the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang remained with his eyes closed, constantly replaying the scene of the eight thunder dragons converging when he condensed the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>When Lei Zu descended, the seal summoned the spiritual energy into thunder dragons, none dared disobey!</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang could not perfectly replicate it; he had been struggling against Lei Zu's power at the time and could only grasp a fraction, but it was enough!</p><p>“Control the heavens and earth! Control the heavens and earth! All things are in my hands, heaven and earth are at my command… Is this the unity of heaven and man? Is this the divine ability of a Refining Emptiness cultivator?”</p><p>A storm raged in Qin Sang's heart. His intuition had been correct; he had underestimated the benefits of Lei Zu's descent.</p><p>Guided by Left Real Person, Qin Sang understood the path to breaking through to the Refining Emptiness stage and initially established that the most suitable method for him was to gradually balance the Five Elements, seeking mutual generation and thus achieving harmony between heaven and man.</p><p>Which Nascent Soul cultivator hadn't spent years in painstaking cultivation after reaching the peak of the Nascent Soul stage to gradually achieve enlightenment?</p><p>Qin Sang had essentially ascended in a single step!</p><p>Even in the heyday of the Daoist sect, this was extremely rare.</p><p>A Daoist master invoking a divine spirit a realm higher than themselves was already the limit.</p><p>What had descended into Qin Sang's body, however, was the far superior Nine Heavens Primal Thunder Sound Universal Savior Heavenly Venerable.</p><p>If it had been a divine spirit comparable to a Refining Emptiness cultivator, Qin Sang could have used it for insight and aided his breakthrough, but it would have been unlikely to achieve such immediate results.</p><p>Ancient Daoist masters could, like the Kun Daoist, personally protect and invoke higher-level divine spirits for their disciples and descendants to aid their breakthroughs, but they would avoid doing so unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Firstly, it was extremely dangerous; a slight mistake could damage a disciple's cultivation foundation, resulting in a net loss.</p><p>Secondly, invoking divine spirits required the master's full protection. The higher the level of the divine spirit, the greater the pressure on the officiating person, even more so than personally invoking the spirit.  Any accident would also affect them, causing minor to severe damage to their essence.</p><p>Thirdly, if a disciple lacked sufficient mental fortitude, even with a higher-level divine spirit, they could only maintain a slight clarity of mind, remaining in a dazed state, unable to gain much insight.</p><p>Most importantly, forcibly raising one's cultivation level without personal understanding was like forcing a plant to grow, creating future obstacles and hidden dangers in cultivation.</p><p>Unless a disciple is exceptionally gifted, possesses exceptional character, and poses minimal risk, or the sect faces an existential crisis, such powerful techniques are never recklessly used.</p><p>Qin Sang, protected by the jade Buddha, is arguably the epitome of exceptional character!</p><p>It's akin to a Unity True Monarch summoning a Mahayana-level divine spirit to personally bestow enlightenment upon Qin Sang, a mere Nascent Soul cultivator, allowing him to experience the state of oneness with Heaven and Earth, assisting his breakthrough.</p><p>This honor is unprecedented; likely, only Qin Sang has ever received such a boon.  It's highly unlikely to be repeated.</p><p>Thunder City, Eighth Heaven.</p><p>The thunder subsided.</p><p>Earlier, Lei Zu's Great Hall was surrounded by lightning and thunder, now it's completely silent.</p><p>The hall itself is eerily quiet.</p><p>The Lei Zu statue is faintly shimmering with small flashes of lightning; upon closer inspection, these are actually intricate cracks.</p><p>Cracks cover the entire statue, a horrifying sight.</p><p>One worries it might shatter at the slightest touch.</p><p>…</p><p>“Did the Daoist sect utilize Lei Zu's power through me intentionally or unintentionally?”</p><p>Qin Sang realizes that the truth may differ from his assumptions; the Daoist sect and Tian Yue Shang Ren may not have abandoned him.</p><p>They might be battling a stronger enemy, unable to extricate themselves, unable to spare attention for him, but leaving him a glimmer of hope.</p><p>It all depends on whether he can seize this chance!</p><p>After all, it was Qin Sang who initiated all this; he has no right to complain.</p><p>Qin Sang's current understanding far surpasses his cultivation level; he simply lacks the accumulation of True Qi.</p><p>His comprehension of the Killing Dao and his mastery of his techniques are beyond question.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had collaborated with Left Real Person to slay the self-diminished Spiritual Yin King.</p><p>Now,</p><p>he’s eliminated two powerful demon kings.</p><p>He's also confronted a Heaven-Devouring Demon, nearly killing its manifestation.</p><p>These enemies were far stronger than Qin Sang, driving him to near death.</p><p>Although not entirely his own power, it’s undeniable he played an indispensable role.</p><p>He cultivates the Killing Dao, not the Sword Dao; as long as he eliminates enemies and resolves karmic debts, why stick to formalities?</p><p>But were these events part of someone else's calculations?</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The Qi vortex in Qin Sang's palm suddenly dissipated.</p><p>A flash of lightning appeared, revealing an altar.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, noticing that within the altar, his own inner essence was replaced by a divine intent identical to Lei Zu's.</p><p>“Lei Zu?”</p><p>He has seen many Daoist cultivators' altars, and their guardian deities' auras were all more substantial than his own.</p><p>Qin Sang found the guardian deity's divine intent to be remarkably dormant. His attempts to sense it were fruitless.</p><p>Despite this, Lei Zu's protection remains.</p><p>The presence or absence of a guardian deity makes little difference to Qin Sang. He immediately dismissed it from his mind, focusing his attention on the Phoenix Wings.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!’</p><p>The blue feathers fluttered.</p><p>Azure lightning danced among the feathers.</p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant azure light erupted, launching a ball of azure thunder towards the altar.</p><p>This is the Azure Phoenix True Thunder.  Previously, Qin Sang could only carefully manipulate a thread of it when forging the altar; now, he directly separates a sphere of it.</p><p>He can not only control the world’s Qi, but also the Azure Phoenix True Thunder with greater ease.</p><p>Qin Sang realizes he cannot yet control all the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, but a portion suffices.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The thunderball entered the altar, instantly dispersing.</p><p>Streams of azure lightning spread throughout the altar; a violent energy permeates, raising concerns about the altar's stability.</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive, guiding the azure lightning into the altar, forming its framework and gradually perfecting it.</p><p>This is also thanks to Lei Zu's power, enabling him to utilize the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't claim complete mastery over this talisman, but his understanding is enough to forge an altar exceeding the requirements of a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Daoist altar techniques inherently aid cultivation.</p><p>Improving the altar and stabilizing his True Qi greatly benefit Qin Sang's upcoming breakthrough.</p><p>With the Azure Phoenix True Thunder depleted, the altar was instantly complete.</p><p>Without time to admire this sturdy altar, Qin Sang immediately retracted it into his body!</p><p>…</p><p>With extraordinary composure, he methodically and calmly completed each step.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang spread his arms.</p><p>Accompanied by the phoenix's cry.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Image manifested, its wings fluttering before circling Qin Sang once before merging into his body.</p><p>The surrounding Qi stirred again.</p><p>A massive vortex formed, centered on Qin Sang, drawing in boundless Qi from Heaven and Earth.</p><p>He could directly refine the Qi to improve his cultivation, but absorbing pure toxins is faster!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the pool of blood, entered a meditative state, focusing on the Serpent King’s demon pill in his abdomen!</p><p>The Fat Silkworm Poison Pill hovered above the Serpent King’s demon pill, emitting a radiant glow, gently enveloping it.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't seek the Serpent King’s power within the pill; he cannot refine it in a short time. He simply wishes to extract the serpent venom within using the poison pill.</p><p>A snake king's essence, brimming with highly refined venom, was within the妖丹. Refining this venom into his own essence was the key to accelerating his cultivation.  He aimed to break through to the next realm here.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the immense risk. Even if successful, a forced breakthrough would leave significant lasting problems.  But he had to gamble.  The cost of failure was death, a price far exceeding any potential long-term consequences.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He shattered the妖丹, his inner poison pearl spinning rapidly, a luminous aura enveloping the shattered remains as he extracted the venom.  Time was short; he had to be forceful.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The power of the妖丹 surged out like a broken dam.  There was no turning back; he couldn't seal the breach.  An uncontrolled妖丹, however, contained power far beyond what a cultivator at his level could withstand.  To avoid being overwhelmed, Qin Sang had to make choices.</p><p>The most precious aspects of the妖丹 – its potent energy – were drawn out. Without the poison pearl, separating the venom would have been far more difficult, and even then, most would be wasted.  Qin Sang wasn’t worried; this was a demon king's essence, containing far more venom than he needed.</p><p>A steady stream of venom flooded his body as he channeled his cultivation techniques. His cultivation advanced at an astonishing rate. Any other cultivator witnessing this would be astonished, perhaps mistaking him for a high-level practitioner who had fallen in rank.</p><p>Simultaneously, the poison pearl and his physical body strengthened.  Previously, Qin Sang had carefully balanced his cultivation with periods of allowing the poison pearl to absorb flower essence, fortifying him for further cultivation. This method, however, was now proving insufficient.</p><p>The poison pearl had not been fully developed; the  《天妖炼形》 technique had not reached its peak fifth level. If he reached the peak of his current level, it would exceed the poison pearl's capacity, potentially killing him.  Improving it now was impossible; the poison pearl's absorption of potent venom required time. This was his greatest danger.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>True energy roared within him, his energy sea churned, and powerful true energy surged through his meridians. While refining the venom, toxins accumulated.  Though they tempered his body, their rate of accumulation far outstripped the body's ability to process them. Qin Sang was dancing on a knife's edge.</p><p>He wasn't entirely without resources. Left Zhenren's guidance had deepened his understanding of his Dharma image, allowing him to use its power to suppress the toxins, greatly easing the strain. Moreover, his control over the world's energy had reached unprecedented levels.  Previously, this cultivation speed would have destroyed his foundation, but he persevered.</p><p>Desperate, almost frenzied!</p><p>Yet, the crisis arrived. The accumulated toxins reached critical levels.  Qin Sang’s body glowed with multicolored light, his skin changing, seeming to become covered in snake scales, as the venom ravaged his flesh, rapidly draining his life force. He pushed on, oblivious to the danger, showing no sign of stopping.</p><p>Finally, as death neared, transforming him into a husk, he activated a prepared hand seal: the Inner Lion Seal.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The colorful glow vanished, his body restored!  But the recovery was temporary; he still needed to survive the tribulation before the Inner Lion Seal’s power faded.  His urgency mirrored his rapidly increasing cultivation.  He was nearing the peak of his current realm.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A cracking sound startled him. It was the poison pearl!  Qin Sang was shocked. Absorbing too much venom had exceeded its limit, creating a crack across its surface.</p><p>*Crack, crack, crack…*</p><p>More cracks appeared. Finally,</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The poison pearl shattered.  Liuyíng and Feicán’s parting gift was destroyed.  Qin Sang was devastated.  No one understood its potential more than he did. Feicán’s divine silkworm bloodline had created a pearl far from its limit, yet it had been destroyed here. Without it, his astonishing progress at this level would have been impossible.</p><p>In fact, when Tianyue Shangren discovered Qin Sang's cultivation of poison techniques and laid his trap, he hadn’t anticipated Qin Sang’s unexpectedly rapid progress, forcing him to accelerate his plan.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared, hair standing on end, a wild, crazed figure.  His cultivation reached its peak, and almost immediately, he broke through to the next realm!</p><p></p>
