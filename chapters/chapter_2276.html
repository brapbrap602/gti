<h1>Chapter 2266 Eighty Years</h1><p>The worst-case scenario is highly likely.</p><p>After all, this illusion is quite unique.  Even with the jade Buddha protecting him, Qin Sang is still restricted within the illusion and cannot achieve a superior position.</p><p>Gazing at the vortex above the divine mountain, a wild idea formed in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Before the treasure fully forms, could its creation be forcibly interrupted by external forces, thus delaying the illusion's dissipation?</p><p>The treasure's emergence at this time indicates that the conditions are ripe. As long as this 'soil'—the illusion—remains, the treasure is unlikely to be directly destroyed; at most, its formation will be delayed, but it will eventually be born. If the treasure were that fragile, the powerful figures of the Yi people would have taken preventative measures long ago.</p><p>Among those currently within the illusion, probably only Qin Sang would dare to consider such a plan.</p><p>In all likelihood, this treasure is the 'seed' the powerful figures of the Yi people are seeking! Those individuals are tasked by these powerful figures with obtaining this treasure; who would dare obstruct its emergence?</p><p>This idea didn't spring up suddenly for Qin Sang.  His motivation stems partly from his concern for Liuli, and partly from the upcoming battle for the treasure, in which Qin Sang feels he has little chance of success.</p><p>Hong Tian mentioned that the 'seed' could help him break through to the Unity stage, a unique opportunity in the world, so Qin Sang is determined to obtain it.</p><p>Contrary to his initial expectations, the jade Buddha hasn't provided him with much advantage within the illusion.  Everyone else is currently preoccupied; near the divine mountain, Qin Sang is alone, without competition, but he can't take the treasure before it's fully formed, leaving him to simply watch.</p><p>After some time, others will successively defeat their shadow demons, and perhaps even forces aligned with the shadow demons will arrive to contend for the treasure, drastically shifting the situation.  Even if he seized the opportunity to massacre his opponents amidst the chaos, there are too many powerful figures to eliminate them all—and some have already defeated their shadow demons.</p><p>Judging by the celestial changes atop the divine mountain, the Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe will likely reach its limit before the treasure appears, attracting his shadow demon.  Killing the shadow demon won't be difficult, but Qin Sang's cultivation will surge as a result, exposing him to the mysterious Qingluan, rendering him unable to rely on its power in the struggle for the treasure. He’ll have to rely solely on himself.</p><p>Qin Sang's exploits from the Divine Mountain seating order battle were highly publicized, putting him in the spotlight and making him a primary target for various factions, who might even unite to expel him.  Even with his strength, the formidable Thunder Guards bear a seal of Unity-stage power, and it's impossible for him to win against such overwhelming odds, especially as these Yi people's experts are all backed by powerful figures, potentially holding hidden trump cards.</p><p>He's not alone, sharing deep ties with the Zhuyan tribe and having a good relationship with Ji Xia.  However, the Yuanxiang clan leader and Ji Xia are merely pawns of the powerful figures here, forced to obey their will.</p><p>If those powerful figures behind them fall into conflict, even against their wishes, they will be forced to fight each other.  Once the all-out war begins, any alliances will be unreliable.</p><p>Since he can only rely on himself, Qin Sang naturally needs to enhance his own strength as much as possible.</p><p>The unexpected sensing of Mount Daiyu here gives Qin Sang a glimmer of hope.  If he can recall Mount Daiyu before the great battle begins, his strength will surely increase significantly!</p><p>Ning Zhenren once said that once Mount Daiyu is restored to a certain degree and used to stabilize the domain, it will make the domain much stronger and more stable, easily overpowering others.</p><p>Qin Sang isn't a Unity-stage cultivator, but he can utilize the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock to wield the Void Domain ability, and he also has a certain understanding of the Sword Domain.</p><p>Then, combining Mount Daiyu with the Sky-Trapping Golden Lock to deploy the Void Domain will surely produce unprecedented power, increasing his chances of obtaining the treasure.</p><p>Mount Daiyu is one of the five ancient sacred mountains.  The fact that another such mountain can serve as the foundation of the Yi people’s sacred land means that any trump cards their powerful patrons have given them would pale in comparison.</p><p>Forcibly interrupting the treasure’s birth will undoubtedly trigger the fury of the powerful figures of the Yi people if discovered, but Qin Sang can simply explain to Hong Tian that it was a strategic move to seize the treasure.</p><p>Hong Tian sent him for results, not to be concerned about the process. As long as he helps Hong Tian obtain the treasure, everything else is secondary. If Hong Tian wants to keep the treasure, he can deal with the anger of the other powerful figures; there are certainly existing agreements between them.</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang accepted Hong Tian's request, offending the other powerful figures of the Yi people was inevitable. Qin Sang is generally cautious, but when it comes to seizing opportunities, he won't hesitate!</p><p>Furthermore, Liuli is backed by Ning Zhenren. Rescuing Liuli will allow Qin Sang to use Ning Zhenren's influence, making the powerful figures of the Yi people wary.</p><p>In a flash, countless thoughts raced through Qin Sang's mind, weighing the pros and cons and consequences.  These were merely musings, however; he wasn't sure he could forcibly interrupt the treasure's emergence.</p><p>This was his last hope. If he failed, Qin Sang was powerless.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the mountain peak, his eyes flickering.</p><p>Time was of the essence.  If he was going to do it, he had to do it now!</p><p>He didn't know how many times he'd have to interrupt the process in the future.  Inevitably, the truth would come out.</p><p>Some had already been possessed by the shadowy figures, while others – strong and resolute experts – had defeated them.  He wondered what changes these individuals had undergone, and whether they might become obstacles later.</p><p>Furthermore, most people were still locked in a bitter struggle with the shadowy figures.  If the outcome was indecisive this time, they'd likely be entangled again on their next entry. The sooner he acted, the less pressure he'd face later.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang immediately moved, flashing towards the summit of the sacred mountain.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>As he neared the vortex of clouds and mist at the peak, a gale howled in his ears. Mysterious power surged from all directions, a ceaseless, overwhelming tide.</p><p>Fortunately, the Celestial Awareness Thunder Robe could not only conceal him but also offered protection.</p><p>Qin Sang paused at the edge of the vortex, then 'squeezed' inside, getting sucked towards the center along with the mysterious power.  Soon, he saw clearly into the vortex's interior, a flash of green in his vision.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the so-called treasure wasn't a refined artifact or anything similar.</p><p>Qin Sang saw only a tiny sapling, growing in the void above the sacred mountain.  Remarkably verdant, less than an inch tall, it seemed newly sprouted, with only three slender leaves of varying lengths gently swaying at its crown.</p><p>The sapling was at the vortex's heart, surrounded by howling winds, threatening to be broken at any moment.</p><p>Yet it stood firm, emanating a faint, strange aura, steadily absorbing the mysterious power.  Upon contact, the power instantly became docile, allowing itself to be consumed.</p><p>The inconspicuous sapling devoured the mysterious power at an incredible rate, as if possessing a bottomless pit.  The rate of consumption even increased, and the sapling grew stronger, new buds appearing at the top, a fourth leaf about to emerge, its roots thickening.</p><p>“No wonder Hong Tian called it a ‘seed’…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, unsure whether the treasure referred to the seed from which the sapling grew or the fruit it would eventually bear.  Judging by Hong Tian's tone, the ‘seed’ wasn’t singular; it was likely the latter.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, rushing into the vortex's center and striking at the sapling with a palm strike. It was merely a probe; most of his power was used to maintain the Celestial Awareness Thunder Robe.</p><p>A phantom palm image materialized above the sapling, descending swiftly.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>As expected, the aura surrounding the sapling deflected the palm image, causing it to shatter.</p><p>This attack revealed the aura's power, causing Qin Sang to rejoice.  His plan was feasible!  However, it was clear that as the sapling grew, the aura became denser. Once it reached a certain size, even his full strength wouldn't be enough to interrupt it.</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang didn’t hesitate, striking the sapling again.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The vortex of clouds and mist suddenly stalled.</p><p>At the vortex's center, the sapling erupted in a brilliant green light, shattering into countless fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened.  His vision was filled with green light, his body violently shaking, a tremendous roar seeming to reverberate through his very soul, like the earth splitting asunder.</p><p>But Qin Sang could do nothing.  The moment the sapling shattered, he found himself paralyzed, only one thought remaining in his mind.</p><p>"Success!"</p><p>…</p><p>On the lake's surface…</p><p>A powerful Otherworldly expert was battling a shadowy figure.</p><p>He was gasping for breath, his robes tattered, his left arm severed at the shoulder. He was at his wit's end.</p><p>The grey figure was even stronger than he had demonstrated in the real world. He never imagined he would die at its hands.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Suddenly, a silver chain pierced his protective armor, penetrating his back.</p><p>Agonizing pain arched his body. He saw the glinting silver at his chest – his most familiar treasure, now his executioner. Despair filled his heart.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The shadowy figure approached, a sinister smile on its face, its finger pointing at his brow.</p><p>At that moment, both figures froze, immobile.</p><p>On another battlefield, the outcome was drastically different.  The shadowy figure was cornered by its master, yet a decisive victory remained elusive.</p><p>...</p><p>In a mountain valley.</p><p>Xi Rui, eyes closed, stood alone; the shadowy figure had vanished. He seemed to be contemplating something, then opened his eyes and looked to the sky.</p><p>He could sense the flow of mystical energy above, but knew the sacred treasure wouldn't appear so soon.  Before that, preparations for the upcoming great battle were necessary.</p><p>Xi Rui turned, about to fly away, when he suddenly froze.</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>All of existence in that space seemed to freeze; time itself appeared to stop.</p><p>The vortex dissipated, the mystical energy ceased flowing. The wind died down, leaves stopped rustling, and the ripples on the water solidified.</p><p>Then, a strange wind arose, scattering everything in that space into dust.</p><p>Dust to dust, earth to earth.</p><p>...</p><p>Jade Machine Mountain Cave.</p><p>A silent, dark cave.</p><p>Before the celestial omen, Qin Sang had lit a special incense to nourish his true essence. Only ash remained; the incense was completely burnt.  His breath was faint.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's breathing became erratic, his eyelids twitched, and he abruptly opened his eyes.</p><p>His pupils, still reflecting a look of delight, lingered on the moment he shattered the spirit tree.</p><p>Lowering his head, seeing the familiar incense burner, Qin Sang let out a soft sigh, murmuring, "Thank goodness I'm back…"</p><p>He was unsure what consequences shattering the spirit tree would have.  A restart of the illusion would mean starting from scratch again.</p><p>Thankfully, that hadn't happened!</p><p>He could continue to maneuver around the mysterious Azure Bird and continue cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>His previous experiences showed that what he gained in the illusion could be brought into reality and the interwoven realm.  He wondered if breaking through to the mid-stage of the sixth transformation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* within the illusion would allow him to bring that increased cultivation into the real world.</p><p>This illusion was already quite unique; nothing would surprise him.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang immediately called out to the mysterious Azure Bird, the words already prepared.</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang called several times, but received no response.</p><p>"Could it be that consecutively transmitting two divine abilities exhausted the mysterious Azure Bird? Or did my disruption of the treasure's emergence affect the illusion's progression?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, unsure.</p><p>Normally, the mysterious Azure Bird would have persisted and waited for the final outcome.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang was about to get up and investigate when he finally received a response.</p><p>"It's you… you're alive… you've finally awakened…"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Qin Sang felt something was odd and wondered, "It is I, Senior. What exactly happened in reality? You seem… different.  And why did you think I was dead?"</p><p>"Heh heh… of course I've changed… eighty years…"</p><p>The Azure Bird's tone was filled with bitterness.</p><p>"Senior means eighty years have passed in reality?" Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>He'd guessed that interrupting the treasure's evolution would affect the illusion, but he hadn't expected it to fast-forward the illusion by eighty years.</p><p>Eighty years.  The mysterious Azure Bird was still battling its enemies, with no decisive victory? The divine abilities of powerful beings were truly beyond ordinary comprehension!</p><p>"Indeed… I waited for you for eighty years! What… happened there… did you obtain the treasure?" The Azure Bird eagerly pressed.</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the Azure Bird's feelings, and didn't beat around the bush. He relayed his prepared account.</p><p>In his description, he, clad in the Celestial Thunder Robe, had entered a strange realm. The demonic minions and shadowy figures of the Outer Demons were also pulled in, resulting in a massive battle.</p><p>He was the weakest, but the Celestial Thunder Robe protected him from exposure.</p><p>As the battle raged, something resembling the treasure appeared. He intended to wait for an opportunity. However, both sides fought fiercely, not stopping but escalating the battle, ultimately shattering the nascent treasure in the chaos.</p><p>The instant the treasure shattered, everything around him froze. When he awoke, he was back in the cave, only to find eighty years had passed outside.</p><p>"What? The treasure is shattered?"</p><p>The Azure Bird was shocked and enraged, unable to accept it.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed his head in apology, "I am incompetent, Senior. I have let you down."</p><p>The Azure Bird remained silent for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang was its only lifeline.</p><p>For eighty years, it had been able to sense a faint trace of Qin Sang's life force through its divine ability, which hadn't dissipated. This gave it a sliver of hope, and it waited painfully for eighty years, only to receive this news.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Apologies for returning late today. Yesterday's extra chapter will be postponed until tomorrow.</p>
