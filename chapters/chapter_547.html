<h1>Chapter 540: Breaking the Talisman</h1><p>The space within the iron thumb ring was larger than a mustard seed pouch.  Qin Sang placed all his belongings inside, occupying only a small portion of it.</p><p>A sudden thought struck him. He opened the Corpse Puppet Sack and summoned the only remaining Fierce Corpse. To his surprise, he successfully stored the Fierce Corpse within the iron thumb ring.</p><p>Then, would a Living Corpse work?</p><p>Lacking a Living Corpse to test his theory, Qin Sang recalled the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets and grabbed the nearby Spirit Beast Pouch.</p><p>“Buzzzzzz……”</p><p>A blood-red shadow flew out from the Spirit Beast Pouch. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a fist-sized Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet.</p><p>These Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets were still in their larval stage after the first hatching, showing no signs of metamorphosis.</p><p>Moreover, their growth rate was exceptionally slow. The Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet in Qin Sang's hand was about the same size and strength as those he had encountered in Boundless Valley.</p><p>This stage seemed to be their limit. Qin Sang had tried using the same methods he used to cultivate Ghost-Head Hornets to enhance their power, but to no avail.</p><p>He had even risked returning to the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets' habitat to investigate the cause of their mutation, only to discover their nest destroyed and overrun by countless demonic beasts.  The Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets were long gone.</p><p>Qin Sang still had no clue how to cultivate them and could only feed them with blood to keep them alive.</p><p>Although the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornets were ferocious and untamable, refusing to acknowledge him as their master, Qin Sang's prolonged feeding had some effect.</p><p>At least, they wouldn't immediately go berserk and attack upon sensing his aura.</p><p>But that was all.  He still couldn't control them in combat. If the Ghost-Head Hornets weren't such rare and peculiar insects, Qin Sang would have abandoned them long ago.</p><p>The Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet hovered in front of Qin Sang. This was just one of them.  </p><p>Qin Sang had harvested an entire hive, which eventually hatched over two hundred hornets. Although individually weak, releasing all the Ghost-Head Hornets from the Spirit Beast Pouch at once could overwhelm even a careless early Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, restrained the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet, and sent it into the iron thumb ring.</p><p>After a while, he summoned it again, only to find it completely dead.</p><p>"It seems I can't discard the Corpse Puppet Sack and the Spirit Beast Pouch just yet."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, waved away the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Hornet's corpse and the debris in the cave, and unconsciously twirled the iron thumb ring on his right thumb, lost in thought.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang collected his thoughts and sat down in meditation once more.</p><p>This time, he focused his mind inward, 'gazing' at his Corpse Core.  Then, his consciousness returned to his Nascent Soul space, where he resolutely undid the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within his Nascent Soul!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A brilliant Buddhist light erupted as the Heavenly Corpse Talisman shattered.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's heart leaped into his throat. He anxiously observed the changes in his Qi Sea.</p><p>The moment the Heavenly Corpse Talisman shattered, the Corpse Refining Restrictions on his body also crumbled like rootless duckweed.  Even the Five Elements Yin Objects stabilizing his Qi Sea showed signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. The first change unexpectedly occurred within them.</p><p>With the Five Elements Yin Objects destabilized, there was no point in keeping them in his Qi Sea.  They might even cause harm.  Qin Sang didn't dare delay and quickly expelled them, continuing to focus on the changes in his Corpse Core.</p><p>In a single breath, the Corpse Refining Restrictions on Qin Sang's body almost completely dissipated.  He clenched his hands, intently 'staring' at the Corpse Core.</p><p>The worst-case scenario didn't happen.</p><p>Qin Sang could feel the shattering of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the dissipation of the Corpse Refining Restrictions, but the affinity between him and the Corpse Core hadn't vanished. His prediction had come true!</p><p>However, it was far too early to celebrate.</p><p>The last restriction on his body shattered!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>True Essence suddenly surged within his Qi Sea.</p><p>The Corpse Core flashed brightly, then began to vibrate violently, causing the True Essence in his Qi Sea to churn like boiling water.  </p><p>A sharp pain shot through his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>At this moment, although he and the Corpse Core hadn't become estranged, when he tried to mobilize his True Essence to stabilize the Corpse Core, he felt a newfound sluggishness, like a child trying to wield a heavy sword.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered. He couldn't tell if this outcome was good or bad.</p><p>Unable to use his True Essence, he wanted to stabilize the Corpse Core but didn't know how.</p><p>However, since his Core hadn't shattered, and the Corpse Core hadn't backlashed, there was still hope.</p><p>With a serious expression, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then unhesitatingly poured all his Divine Sense into his Qi Sea, racing against time to connect with the Corpse Core.  He discovered that his Divine Sense was too weak. Without the support of True Essence, it wasn't enough to soothe the Corpse Core.</p><p>Qin Sang refused to give up. He immediately used his Divine Sense to urge the Ebony Sword into his dantian, revealing the aura of the magical treasure, but the effect was limited.</p><p>When Qin Sang tried using Restriction techniques, adapting the restrictions from the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* for refining Corpse Cores and assisting human-core fusion, and applying his understanding of restrictions, he finally achieved some results by striking the Corpse Core with modified restrictions.</p><p>However, he still couldn't subdue the Corpse Core.  Continuing like this would undoubtedly end with the Corpse Core completely slipping out of his control.</p><p>Nevertheless, during this process, the connection between Qin Sang and the Corpse Core grew clearer, and a realization dawned upon him.</p><p>The reason for this phenomenon might not be that the Corpse Core was trying to break free.</p><p>Rather, his own power was too weak. Currently, he could only use his Divine Sense, which, without the aid of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, was simply insufficient to control the Corpse Core.  This was what caused the Core's instability and the sluggishness of his True Essence.</p><p>Since their connection remained, Qin Sang was certain that the Corpse Core wasn't rejecting him.</p><p>As long as he could stabilize the Corpse Core, he could regain control!</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean Qin Sang needed greater power than the Corpse Core to suppress it. He just needed to leverage the Core's affinity for him and the restrictions of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* to subdue it and prevent it from going out of control.</p><p>Otherwise, if the Corpse Core was weaker than his own power, what use would it be?</p><p>Right, Spiritual Power!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that after the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was undone, he was reborn.  With the return of the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*, he could use Spiritual Power to stabilize the Corpse Core.</p><p>However, his own cultivation was only at the Pseudo Core Formation realm, still insufficient to control the Corpse Core.</p><p>After all, this Corpse Core could rival a true Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, searching for other solutions. In the end, he could only think of one: actively release a portion of the Corpse Core's power.</p><p>He estimated that if he reduced the Corpse Core's power to the level of a Flying Celestial Yaksha, he should be able to subdue it and use it as an external core.</p><p>This would be a great pity, as he wouldn't be able to offend Core Formation cultivators so recklessly anymore.</p>
