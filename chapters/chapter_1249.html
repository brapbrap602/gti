<h1>Chapter 1241: A Thousand Bodies, Ten Thousand Shadows</h1><p>The Blood Fiend Flower is a demonic plant, useless for infant soul cultivation.</p><p>If he truly had Blood Ginseng, he could gather it, refine it into a pill, and help his disciple cultivate their infant soul; why bother with the trouble of seizing the Infant Soul Puppet?</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed inwardly, forced to admire the methods Chongyi Old Daoist and the Red-haired Ancestor used to train their disciples.</p><p>After the Red-haired Ancestor's death, the Pure Yang Sect fell apart, but the two Nascent Soul cultivators of the Taiyi Pill Sect had cultivated together since childhood, their bond unbreakable.  They would not repeat the same mistakes.</p><p>It was a matter of the right time, place, and people – the Taiyi Pill Sect was destined to rise!</p><p>Chongyi Old Daoist could die without regret.</p><p>In this era, reaching the Transformation God stage is a distant dream, and immortality is a myth, a legend without a single example in countless years.</p><p>Cultivators all know that the path to immortality is broken; longevity is a mere aspiration.</p><p>Returning to reality, cultivators only live a few more years than mortals.</p><p>Mortals are like morning mushrooms, unaware of the passing months and years.</p><p>They are like summer cicadas, their brief song ending with autumn.</p><p>In such a situation, unless one is truly detached from worldly desires, who wouldn’t want to leave a mark on the world, a testament to their existence?</p><p>Mortals spend their lives pursuing fame, fortune, and leaving their name in history.</p><p>Cultivators seek to pass on their Dao, to have successors.</p><p>Moreover, Dongyang Bo had sworn before his master's coffin to revive Mount Shao Hua.</p><p>Experiencing the soul shadow within the Infant Soul Puppet, feeling the Nascent Soul realm, is a long process; even the most gifted would need at least forty-nine days.</p><p>But the Spirit-fixing Jade only holds a single breath of Azure Spirit Qi; once used, it’s destroyed, not enough to last that long.</p><p>Gongliang Yu, having obtained the Spirit-fixing Jade, could only use it to control the Infant Soul Puppet to search for treasures.</p><p>With the opening of the Blood Lake, Dongyang Bo knew his chance had come.</p><p>The Blood Lake is the most dangerous forbidden area within the Boundless Valley; even Nascent Soul cultivators cannot guarantee their safety.</p><p>If it were Tieguanzi and his loyal followers, worried about losing the sect's treasure and causing great trouble, they would hesitate. Gongliang Yu, always conceited, would certainly bring the Infant Soul Puppet with him into the Blood Lake to search for medicine.</p><p>This way, he could seize the Infant Soul Puppet without anyone noticing, and later, during the chaos, annex the Shangyuan Pure Quiet Palace – it wasn’t an impossible feat.</p><p>Tieguanzi’s poor judgment had sown the seeds of this disaster.</p><p>Of course, it’s hard to say if Dongyang Bo had a hand in it.</p><p>…</p><p>Gongliang Yu was intelligent; a few words were enough for him to guess Dongyang Bo’s plan almost perfectly.</p><p>Their conversation was through divine sense, a fleeting moment.</p><p>Gongliang Yu understood Dongyang Bo's intentions, his heart filled with alarm.</p><p>Since Dongyang Bo was after the Infant Soul Puppet and had set a trap beforehand, waiting for him to walk right into it, surely he had countermeasures?</p><p>As the Infant Soul Puppet, summoned by Gongliang Yu, returned to protect its master, about to leave the Blood Ginseng, a surge of blood mist erupted from beneath the plant, shooting out beams of profound light.</p><p>The Blood Ginseng illusion shattered.</p><p>This phantom, created by Dongyang Bo using a treasure as bait, was not flawless; its concealment was not particularly sophisticated.</p><p>But Gongliang Yu’s cultivation was inferior, and there were countless blood shadows in this place, the Azure Spirit Qi’s duration limited; Gongliang Yu had no time to investigate.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had meticulously planned this ambush.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The evil wind intensified.</p><p>Ten thousand rays of light suddenly shot out from the blood mist, forming a vortex. A large formation’s phantom emerged from below; in its center, a jade bottle faced the puppet, emitting a powerful suction force.</p><p>Sucked by the bottle, the Infant Soul Puppet slowed down drastically, as if sinking into mud, unable to move.</p><p>The puppet roared. Being an evil puppet, containing countless soul shadows, it possessed a violent nature and would not be subdued; it immediately glowed brightly, countless shadow-forms erupting.</p><p>Mountains, stones, fire, water, thunder, ancient trees – countless attack images, dazzling and colorful like fireworks, burst forth from the Infant Soul Puppet, impacting the formation.</p><p>Gongliang Yu was anxious, urging it on repeatedly.</p><p>The Infant Soul Puppet’s attacks caused the bottle to tremble and the formation to shake, but the suction remained relentless; it couldn’t escape.</p><p>To make matters worse, Dongyang Bo made a hand gesture, and the Vajra Wheel on his head made a sharp clang, splitting off a solid-like shadow, striking directly at the Infant Soul Puppet.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The shadow constricted, the binding force causing the Infant Soul Puppet’s body to creak.</p><p>Its body was hard; it felt no pain, but sensing the intent to capture it, it became even more furious, roaring and counterattacking even more fiercely.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dongyang Bo had been planning for a long time, specifically choosing a formation that counteracted the Infant Soul Puppet; it wouldn’t be easily broken.</p><p>The spirit talisman power unleashed by Gong Liangyu's spirit puppet was mostly absorbed by the jade bottle, which continued to tremble violently, its bursting point unknown.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's face fell. He knew the situation was hopeless; retrieving his spirit puppet was impossible.  The sect's treasured heirloom, lost on his watch.</p><p>His only concern now was survival.  Dong Yangbo, committing such a heinous act here, clearly intended to eliminate him to prevent future trouble.</p><p>This thought barely crossed his mind before he saw Dong Yangbo's eyes flash with cold fury, killing intent overwhelming.</p><p>Gong Liangyu harbored no illusions of mercy.  A decisive man, he acted swiftly as he self-destructed his Skygang Blade Talisman.</p><p>The talisman's explosion forced back the surrounding blood shadows, creating a narrow escape route.  Gong Liangyu's dragon phantom roared, powering his Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman to its limits, simultaneously deploying a speed-enhancing artifact, his speed astonishing, rivaling that of an average Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>However, against Dong Yangbo, it was insufficient.</p><p>His figure barely moved.</p><p>Before he could escape far, blinding white light struck, an immense binding force descending from above, halting the flow of his blood.  He truly understood the chasm between himself and a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>He struggled, every technique futile, easily countered by the Vajra Subduer.</p><p>Then, he suddenly struck his chest.</p><p>Golden light erupted from his palm—a golden spirit talisman.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Gong Liangyu's body shattered, transforming into countless golden streams of light.  A faint Buddhist chant echoed, even the Vajra Subduer unable to contain it as the light scattered in all directions.</p><p>This was Gong Liangyu's ultimate escape technique.</p><p>The sudden change didn't faze Dong Yangbo; instead, he sneered, "The Upper Yuan Pure Quiet Palace's Thousand Bodies, Ten Thousand Shadows Talisman.  A top-tier life-saving technique indeed.  Elsewhere, I couldn't have stopped you. But this talisman originates from Buddhism, good and evil clashing. This is a place of wickedness and filth, specifically designed to counter it.”</p><p>Before he finished, the wickedness intensified. Countless blood shadows, frenzied, devoured the golden light, instantly obliterating it.</p><p>The Thousand Bodies, Ten Thousand Shadows Talisman shattered.</p><p>Gong Liangyu fell, pale and defeated.</p><p>The Thousand Bodies, Ten Thousand Shadows Talisman was exceptionally difficult to restrain.  Dong Yangbo lured Gong Liangyu to this specific location, wary of the talisman, fearing his escape.</p><p>With the talisman broken, Dong Yangbo calmly pointed at Gong Liangyu.</p>
