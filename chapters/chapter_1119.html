<h1>Chapter 1111: The Red Dress</h1><p>Chapter 1111: The Red Dress</p><p>A familiar voice!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and she gazed intently.</p><p>The spirit array opened, the mist parting to the sides as a woman in red stepped through.  Her brows were like sharp peaks, her black hair neatly styled.  She wore a phoenix crown, her beauty striking and almost demonic.  Clad in a long red dress, she exuded an unparalleled grace and elegance.</p><p>Her gaze fell upon Qin Sang, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes.</p><p>"Elder Jing?"</p><p>Qin Sang was equally astonished.</p><p>Elder Jing, the daughter of Senior Qingzhu, whose real name was Qing Jun.  When they first met in the market town, Qing Jun had concealed her cultivation, disguising herself as the frail old woman, Elder Jing.  Only before entering the Zhitian Peak did Qin Sang learn that Elder Jing's identity was a facade, that Qing Jun's true appearance was exceedingly beautiful, rivaling even Chen Yan.</p><p>But seeing Qing Jun again, she had changed.</p><p>She remembered that time, years ago, when Qing Jun revealed her true form, dressed in white, untouched by the dust of the world, like a moon palace fairy, ethereal and otherworldly.</p><p>Now, her appearance was as breathtaking as a century ago; time had left no mark on her face. But the feeling she gave Qin Sang was entirely different.</p><p>The fiery red dress, as radiant as the morning sun, was strikingly impactful. This woman's demeanor was so changeable that Qin Sang was confused, unsure which was her true self.</p><p>"Interesting!  Years ago, I wanted to ask you if you'd found that person's remains, but you disappeared without a trace.  Later, I learned you angered Lord Dongyang and Chen Yan in the Ziwei Palace. I remember then you weren't even a Golden Core cultivator, only at the False Core stage, weren't you?  You escaped, vanished for years, and now reappear with such cultivation?"</p><p>Qing Jun's lips curved into a slight smile as she sized Qin Sang up, her expression one of interest. Her instincts were right; this woman had truly changed, her expression and demeanor completely different from her memory.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly complained.</p><p>Confirming that this woman was indeed Qing Jun, Qin Sang suppressed her thoughts, bowed respectfully, and complimented, "It's been many years.  Senior's elegance remains unchanged.  I apologize for disturbing your seclusion, Senior."</p><p>Qing Jun was Qingzhu's daughter.  Since Peach Blossom Valley was her homeland, meeting her here wasn't unexpected.  However, from Qing Jun's tone back then, it seemed she didn't have much affection for Senior Qingzhu, and Peach Blossom Valley wasn't some hidden paradise.  Qin Sang hadn't expected to reunite with Elder Jing so soon.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang most was that Qing Jun's aura was so subtle she couldn't discern her true cultivation.  Only one possibility remained: Qing Jun had broken through to the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly dismissed this. It was only natural.  They had been separated for over a hundred years. A century ago, Qing Jun had dared to infiltrate Mount Shao Hua, attempting to assassinate Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"I've never mentioned Peach Blossom Valley to anyone. How did you know I was here? You came to Peach Blossom Valley for other reasons, didn't you?"</p><p>Qing Jun saw through Qin Sang's intentions immediately.  "Come inside and let's talk."</p><p>Qing Jun turned and walked into the spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her and quickly followed.</p><p>Passing through the array, the valley was indeed a scene of stunning beauty, the slopes painted crimson.  The peach trees had been carefully pruned; some were in full bloom, others laden with bright red immortal peaches, their fragrance intoxicating.  A stream gurgled, meandering through the peach grove, eventually emptying into a clear pond.</p><p>There were no grand buildings, only a small, exquisite courtyard with several wooden houses nestled beside the pond, nestled among the peach trees.  Senior Qingzhu's words left on the cliff were simply a depiction of the most unforgettable scene etched in his memory.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts turned, just as she was about to speak, a surge of extremely pure spiritual energy washed over her, even richer than the caves of Yunyouzi and Li Yu'fu.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley only had a small spirit vein, didn't it?</p><p>"I relocated a spirit vein from the Yuan Shen Gate. It's quite sufficient."</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's surprise, Qing Jun said calmly.</p><p>"Yuan Shen Gate? Could Leng Yuntian be...?"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang gasped, her face filled with shock.</p><p>In Yinshan Pass, she had deliberately inquired about the Yuan Shen Gate. She knew that the Yuan Shen Gate remained among the top sects and had not declined, and that Leng Yuntian was still alive.</p><p>She had thought Qing Jun had failed to kill Leng Yuntian in the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Hearing that Qing Jun could even relocate a spirit vein from the Yuan Shen Gate, Qin Sang's mind flashed, suddenly realizing something, finding it almost unbelievable.  The Qingzhu family and the Yuan Shen Gate had a blood feud; Qing Jun would certainly not compromise with Leng Yuntian.</p><p>There's only one possibility…</p><p>"That's right. Leng Yuntian's Five-Pagoda Tower was defiled by the Blood-Soiled Light. I killed him in the Ziwei Palace.  Yuan Shen Sect, with such a large foundation, couldn't just be disbanded or handed over to others. So I disguised myself as Leng Yuntian and became the Sect Master. The Yuan Shen Sect disciples couldn't see through my true form, but the Red-Haired Ancestor and others noticed something was amiss. However, firstly, the war was raging at that time, and I actively joined the battle, fighting with all my might. Secondly, the matter was already settled, I didn't massacre innocent people in Yuan Shen Sect, and Dongyang Bo and others knew about our grievances, warned me a few words, and then tacitly accepted it…"</p><p>Qing Jun spoke lightly of the reasons.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that things were certainly not as simple as Qing Jun had said.</p><p>Leng Yuntian's death, and someone usurping the enormous Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>How could the Nascent Soul Masters of various sects not feel a sense of impending doom?</p><p>No matter the reason, they wouldn't allow someone to act so arbitrarily.</p><p>Unless, their strength reached a level that forced everyone to compromise!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed Qing Jun.</p><p>It wasn't clear if it was an illusion, but he vaguely sensed that the aura emanating from Qing Jun was even more subtle than that of the early Nascent Soul cultivators he had encountered in the Seven Kills Hall!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by this thought.</p><p>A hundred years ago, Qing Jun needed to make multiple plans and call for help to deal with Leng Yuntian, who had only just barely reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>In just over a hundred years, had she made consecutive breakthroughs and reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage?</p><p>This was simply too shocking.</p><p>Even with a Heaven-grade spiritual root, it would be difficult to break through so quickly, right?</p><p>Or was there some hidden circumstance back then?</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>The feeling Qing Jun gave him was contradictory.</p><p>Years ago, Qing Jun disguised herself as an old woman and hid in the Wenyue Market. Yet, she dared to infiltrate Mount Shaohua and approach Dongyang Bo's cave dwelling, without worrying about being discovered.</p><p>Her cultivation was always mysterious, fluctuating, making her impossible to figure out.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was lost in thought, the two passed through the peach orchard and arrived at the wooden house.</p><p>"Speak. What brings you here?"</p><p>Qing Jun suddenly stopped and looked at Qin Sang, asking.</p><p>Qin Sang saw two graves behind the wooden house, with two women's names engraved on the tombstones, the handwriting delicate and graceful.</p><p>Indeed, both beauties had passed away.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the identities of the tombstones' owners and sighed.</p><p>May Elder Qingzhu meet them in the afterlife!</p><p>Qin Sang put aside his distracting thoughts, silently offered his blessing, took a deep breath, and said solemnly, "Junior is here at the request of Elder Qingzhu, to bring his remains back and bury them in the Peach Blossom Valley."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang's fingertips flashed with light, and he took out the ice coffin containing Qingzhu's remains.</p><p>Qing Jun seemed to have anticipated this, staring fixedly at the ice coffin, her expression complex.</p>
