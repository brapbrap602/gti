<h1>Chapter 1538: Chess Piece </h1><p>“How long has Fairy Liuli been at Nine Gatha Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang rose to greet her.</p><p>“Three months.”</p><p>Liuli walked in, removing her cloak.</p><p>The cloak she wore was quite large, not only obscuring her face, but also completely concealing her graceful figure.  In Buddhist territory, this attire appeared somewhat unusual, though Nine Gatha Mountain was a melting pot of various individuals, making her appearance less conspicuous.</p><p>This precaution was taken due to encountering a few reckless individuals while traversing the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, not every cultivator possessed sufficient self-control; unparalleled beauty could also invite trouble.</p><p>Liuli, much like Qin Sang, adhered to a low profile while traveling, never revealing her true cultivation unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>The reputations of the Profound Heaven Palace and Listening Snow Pavilion did not reach the Central Continent, and thus couldn't deter petty scoundrels.</p><p>These individuals were all slain by Liuli with a single sword strike. However, to avoid further trouble, she chose to wear a cloak, and indeed, her journey afterward was much more peaceful.</p><p>“Three months… precisely the time I was delayed in the Sky Rift Valley…”</p><p>Qin Sang invited Liuli to sit and briefly recounted his recent experiences.</p><p>“The Sky Rift Valley is not far from the Nineteen States of Misty Rain, which would have been an excellent choice, but unfortunately, the cave dwelling was destroyed. I rescued a Golden Core cultivator on my journey and have dispatched him to the Nineteen States of Misty Rain to gather information.  Once I obtain the Buddha Bone Sarira, I will personally travel there.  If Xiaoxiang Zi's records are accurate, with a bit of luck, I might have the opportunity to take over a prominent Daoist establishment…”</p><p>The Nineteen States of Misty Rain were indeed a sacred land for cultivation, but as far as Qin Sang knew, the celestial mountains and great rivers were already occupied.</p><p>This was not an era of chaos. Various factions were deeply entrenched, interwoven with countless connections, supporting and assisting one another.</p><p>Forcibly occupying another sect’s mountain gate was clearly not feasible and would inevitably make him a target of public hostility.</p><p>Moreover, Nascent Soul cultivators resided in the Central Continent, and their strength was far from sufficient to act with impunity.</p><p>If they wished to establish themselves in the Central Continent, they would either have to join an existing sect or choose a location in the Northern Wastelands, Western Desert, or overseas celestial mountains to establish a cave dwelling.</p><p>However, such locations would be too remote, far from the center of the cultivation world.  News would not be transmitted in a timely manner. If any major event occurred, by the time they received word and rushed to the Central Continent, it would already be over.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was not only to cultivate himself, but also to gather information and seek opportunities for Nascent Soul breakthroughs.</p><p>His mention of the cave dwelling in front of Liuli was an implicit invitation for her to join him. Liuli was not only a powerful ally, but also, most importantly, trustworthy.</p><p>She had come for the Buddha Bone Sarira and, unlike Qin Sang, wasn't entangled in various karmic ties. Her primary tasks were cultivation and investigating the mystery of Ziwei Palace’s ascension, which she could do anywhere.</p><p>Liuli hesitated, noncommittal.</p><p>Qin Sang, familiar with Liuli’s temperament, wasn’t bothered.  Recalling his observations during his ascent, he asked, “Has something happened at Nine Gatha Mountain?  Those Buddhist cultivators seemed rather strange.”</p><p>Liuli hummed in agreement and said, “A month ago, Moonlight Bodhisattva arrived here and established an altar on Nine Gatha Mountain, attracting numerous monks to debate scriptures with her.”</p><p>“Bodhisattva?”</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Buddhists revered Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>Could it be that someone was carrying the statue of Moonlight Bodhisattva from the temple and wandering about?</p><p>Liuli shook her head. “Moonlight Bodhisattva is said to have come from the depths of the desert, well-versed in Buddhist scriptures and possessing profound cultivation.  She proclaims herself ‘Bodhisattva,’ claiming that unless someone defeats her in debate, she will not change her title. Hence, the scriptural debate a month ago.”</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>Even among Nascent Soul cultivators in the Buddhist tradition, their honorary title was merely Saint, like the current Saint Huiguang of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>To dare to claim the title of ‘Bodhisattva,’ wasn't that presumptuous?</p><p>A scriptural debate was a mild consequence.</p><p>If that person were to be besieged on Nine Gatha Mountain, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>Deep within the Western Desert, where human presence was scarce and news traveled slowly, one could claim the title of Buddha or Patriarch without consequence, as no one would pay attention. But to dare to act so brazenly at Nine Gatha Mountain, wasn't she afraid of attracting the attention of Buddhist Saints?</p><p>“What was the outcome of the debate?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>Liuli hesitated for a moment. “I’m not well-versed in Buddhist scriptures… The debate lasted for three days, after which the monks were speechless. Moonlight Bodhisattva gracefully descended the mountain, and no one dared to stop her.”</p><p>“Since she has the audacity to proclaim herself ‘Bodhisattva,’ she must possess some ability.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Those monks likely rushed over to assist after receiving news, but Moonlight Bodhisattva was no longer at Nine Gatha Mountain.</p><p>Mount Snow Chain was known as the source of Buddhism, functioning more as a spiritual sanctuary for Buddhist cultivators.  The current major Buddhist sects were not located here but mostly in the Central Continent.</p><p>Debating for three days, then departing once the news spread.</p><p>This person was undoubtedly apprehensive.</p><p>“During this time, Buddhist disciples have gathered here from all directions. I took the opportunity to inquire about a great deal of information.”</p><p>With that, Liuli produced a sheepskin map, spreading it on the table and pointing to a spot in the desert. “The Buddha Bone Sarira is likely here—the Seven Stars Oasis!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.</p><p>“Thank you, Fairy!”</p><p>He quickly lowered his head and saw that the spot Liuli was pointing to was a large oasis.</p><p>This oasis was not a single entity but rather seven oases of varying sizes, forming a line in the desert, not far from one another.</p><p>On each oasis, a prominent lake was depicted.</p><p>The map was rudimentary, containing only this information.</p><p>Liuli explained in detail, “The Western Desert is not uniform, its situation constantly changing, with numerous nations. Western Desert cultivators roughly divide the desert into several regions based on different characteristics, such as Mount Snow Chain, the Vast Sea… These seven lakes have never dried up, nourishing the oases like seven stars in the desert.  Later, Buddhist cultivators built temples by the lakes.  The Seven Stars Oasis now refers to the seven Buddhist temples by the lakes, closely connected and acting as the dominant force in the Vast Sea, their strength not to be underestimated.  According to my investigation, this area originally had numerous oases and hundreds of lakes, both large and small, which gradually merged, leaving behind seven large lakes. The previous environment matches Xiaoxiang Zi's records.”</p><p>“Waiting Mercy Monastery, Bamboo Orchid Temple…”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the seven Buddhist temples before he looked up in confusion.  “No Hidden Chan Temple?”</p><p>Senior Xiaoxiang Zi had mentioned that the Buddha Bone Sarira was formed from the remains of an enlightened monk from Hidden Chan Temple.</p><p>Liuli explained her reasoning for believing the Buddha Bone Sarira was at the Seven Stars Oasis. “There were originally no Buddhist temples here.  Legend has it that a virtuous monk traveled here alone and, seeing the people untamed, built a temple nearby to spread the Buddhist dharma.  That temple was Hidden Chan Temple.  Later, a great upheaval occurred in the Vast Sea, and Hidden Chan Temple vanished for unknown reasons.  However, more Buddhist temples were built afterward, suggesting that the Buddhist sect prevailed. If Hidden Chan Temple's lineage was broken, the treasures within likely fell into the hands of these seven temples.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>As the saying goes, the seas change into mulberry fields.</p><p>The affairs of the world could change drastically with the slightest deviation.</p><p>Even if Liuli’s conjecture was entirely correct,</p><p>what if Hidden Chan Temple still had descendants who were forced to flee, taking the temple treasures with them and disappearing without a trace? Finding them again would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Liuli said, “Whether this Hidden Chan Temple is the one we seek needs to be verified within the Vast Sea.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his voice grave. “We should depart as soon as possible!”</p><p>There was another underlying concern that neither of them voiced.</p><p>If they were to steal the sarira from Hidden Chan Temple, they would face the experts of a single temple.</p><p>Now, they might potentially provoke seven temples simultaneously!</p><p>It was too early to worry about such things. It would be better to wait until the location of the Buddha Bone Sarira was confirmed.</p><p>Liuli had spent three months at Mount Snow Chain and had investigated almost all the information available. There was no need to waste any more time.  The next morning, they descended the mountain together.</p><p>During their descent, the number of Buddhist cultivators visibly increased.</p><p>The ripples caused by Moonlight Bodhisattva were still spreading, their influence far-reaching.</p><p>Not far from Nine Gatha Mountain, the landscape transformed into a vast expanse of yellow sand, the air dry and scorching, forming visible waves of heat shimmering in the air.</p><p>Of course, no matter how perilous the Western Desert, it couldn't compare to the Storm Belt. The Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle could easily handle it.</p><p>This seemingly harsh environment was actually the most vibrant part of the Western Desert.</p><p>The melting snow from Mount Snow Chain formed several rivers and underground streams that flowed south. Although not as vast as the Tian Tuo River, they infused the desert with vitality.</p><p>Mortals lived along these rivers, forming countless nations, mostly revering Buddhism and known as the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>The Vast Sea lay south of the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms.</p><p>This wasn't yet the deepest part of the Western Desert. Further west lay the true death desert, a forbidden zone for living beings.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli traveled intermittently, gathering information as they went, passing through numerous Buddhist kingdoms and experiencing exotic customs, making their journey worthwhile.</p><p>As they were about to leave the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms,</p><p>they unexpectedly learned some news regarding Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>After the three-day debate at Nine Gatha Mountain, Moonlight Bodhisattva disappeared without a trace. Buddhist cultivators throughout the Western Desert searched for her, but to no avail.</p><p>Unexpectedly, ten days ago, Moonlight Bodhisattva suddenly appeared in a Buddhist kingdom, again making bold claims and setting up an altar.</p><p>Unfortunately, the virtuous monks there were even less capable than those at Nine Gatha Mountain. In less than a day, they were silenced by Moonlight Bodhisattva's arguments and left in shame.</p><p>Provoked repeatedly, the Buddhist community was outraged, and even many eminent monks in the mortal realm began to stir.</p><p>Regardless of how the Buddhist sect responded, Qin Sang and Liuli continued their journey, passing through the Three Thousand Buddhist Kingdoms, crossing the desert, and entering the Vast Sea.</p><p>The Seven Stars Oasis lay in the heart of the Vast Sea.</p><p>They didn't directly approach the Seven Stars Oasis but instead settled in a market town at the edge of the oasis.</p><p>Upon arriving, they learned that within the seven oases, there were not only these seven Buddhist temples, but hundreds more, excluding those built by mortal monks.</p><p>This was a testament to the flourishing of Buddhism in the Western Desert.</p><p>Liuli still wore her cloak, while Qin Sang donned a Haiqing robe, posing as a Buddhist layman, wearing a bamboo hat.</p><p>The Vast Sea was prone to sandstorms, with fierce winds whipping up sand and pebbles that struck the face with the force of a knife.  The locals also dressed similarly.</p><p>‘Creak.’</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the inn room door and saw that Liuli had returned.</p><p>They had separated earlier to gather information.</p><p>“I obtained a list of the Buddhist temples in the Vast Sea.”</p><p>Qin Sang closed the door and whispered, “It includes mortal temples as well. I glanced through it briefly, and there’s no Hidden Chan Temple.  We’ll need to verify each one individually.  There are a few large temples that appear to house cultivators. We can start with them and discreetly contact the Seven Stars Oasis.”</p><p>Liuli offered a conjecture:  “During the upheaval, Hidden Chan Temple might have only had its cultivation lineage severed. The mortal monks within, to avoid disaster, might have changed the temple’s name.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment after hearing this.  “That’s possible, but if that’s the case, we’ll have to visit every temple one by one.”</p><p>“I’ll go.”</p><p>Liuli said.</p><p>Qin Sang understood her meaning.</p><p>The Seven Stars Oasis undoubtedly had Nascent Soul cultivators residing within, but ever since the Seven Stars Oasis's reputation spread, no faction had dared to challenge their position.</p><p>It was difficult to estimate their current strength.</p><p>However, it was highly likely that no Grand Cultivators were present.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Central Continent were elusive, and late-Nascent Soul cultivators were still considered the apex of power in the world.</p><p>Within the Buddhist tradition, whenever a monk reached the late-Nascent Soul stage, a grand Water and Land Dharma Assembly was customarily held, inviting fellow cultivators to celebrate.</p><p>According to the information they gathered, the Seven Stars Oasis had never held such an assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang’s divine sense could manifest a physical form, which he deliberately concealed. Cultivators below the late-Nascent Soul stage, unless they employed inspection secret arts directly, couldn't see through his cultivation. It was safest for him to contact other cultivators.</p><p>Liuli was slightly less inconspicuous.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately took out the list, and they divided the temples into two categories, preparing to act separately.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang parted ways with Liuli and began traveling alone through the oasis, sometimes making open contact, sometimes investigating covertly, probing the background of these Buddhist temples.</p><p>Being too hasty could arouse suspicion, so Qin Sang posed as a devout layman, pretending to worship piously, which inevitably slowed his progress.</p><p>Mount Shell Temple.</p><p>One of the Seven Stars Oasis, ranked sixth.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had already visited Waiting Mercy Monastery, the lowest-ranked temple, but unfortunately, he hadn’t met the abbot, only encountering a few low-cultivation novices, gaining no valuable information.</p><p>Neither Mount Shell Temple nor Waiting Mercy Monastery had Nascent Soul cultivators. It was said that their abbots were only at the late-Golden Core stage.</p><p>However, the formations within the temples were not trivial and were definitely created by Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a long time, determining that it would be difficult to infiltrate without alerting anyone. He suppressed his impulse and continued his search patiently.</p><p>Mount Shell Temple was built by the lake and did not refuse entry to mortals.</p><p>Carriages and pedestrians bustled before the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang behaved like an ordinary person, queuing up with the devotees to enter the temple.</p><p>He didn't reveal his cultivation, but the aura cultivated over many years manifested in his every gesture, making him stand out among the mortals, attracting the attention of the attendant monk who glanced at him several times.</p><p>Burning incense, prostrating, listening to scriptures…</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely familiar with these procedures.</p><p>After absentmindedly listening to the senior monk’s sermon, Qin Sang rose and walked out of the Buddhist hall with the other worshippers.  Just as he was about to call for a novice, finding an excuse to tour the temple, his heart stirred.</p><p>A moment later,</p><p>a monk approached from not far away.</p><p>This person walked towards him, yet the other worshippers seemed completely oblivious.</p><p>“Amitabha, greetings, Layman.”</p><p>The monk walked directly to Qin Sang, placing his palms together and bowing.</p><p>“This disciple greets the Abbot.”</p><p>Qin Sang hastily returned the greeting, recognizing this person as a late-Golden Core cultivator, likely the abbot of Mount Shell Temple.  He thought to himself that this encounter had come effortlessly.</p><p>Both knew the other was a cultivator, so they dispensed with formalities and exchanged Dharma names.</p><p>The abbot's Dharma name was Seng Yan.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his previous story, claiming that he was adopted by a monk in his childhood and given the name Mingyue. He was supposed to be ordained, but unfortunately, the temple suffered a calamity, and he became a wanderer once more.</p><p>Though fortunate enough to encounter the path of cultivation, he had also accumulated boundless karmic debts. Now, looking back, he was filled with remorse and thus made a vow to travel the world, worshipping one hundred thousand Buddhas to atone for his sins.</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang was invited to follow the abbot to a secluded Buddhist hall.</p>
