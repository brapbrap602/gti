<h1>Chapter 1686: The Might of Six Birds</h1><p>Dispatching six Divine Birds was not Qin Sang's desire.</p><p>This was the first time all six birds had been summoned simultaneously, and Qin Sang was unsure of the extent of their combined power or the magnitude of the disturbance they would create.</p><p>With a Soul Formation cultivator directly overhead, the Five Elements Divine Restriction might not be able to conceal the fluctuations of the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang had no time to hesitate; action was imperative.</p><p>Su Zi'nan's giant demonic soul, formed by fusing with the Three Corpses Soul-Devouring Banner, and the Soul Burning Blood Sacrifice, posed a lethal threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Soul Burning Blood Sacrifice, in particular, required three Nascent Soul late-stage demonic souls to activate simultaneously, and even then, Su Zi'nan appeared to be straining considerably, indicating the technique's formidable power.</p><p>Faced with such a situation, Qin Sang had no intention of testing whether three Divine Birds and the Blood Scar could withstand this power. His avatar was in imminent danger, and the slightest hesitation could lead to unimaginable consequences.</p><p>The most prudent course of action was undoubtedly to summon all six Sun Divine Birds to repel Su Zi'nan and rescue his avatar.</p><p>Since a price had to be paid, Qin Sang naturally wasn't content with merely repelling Su Zi'nan; he aimed for a permanent solution, eliminating the threat entirely.</p><p>If Su Zi'nan escaped and completed his three souls, he would become even more formidable.</p><p>This man harbored malicious intentions and had repeatedly obstructed him.  Firstly, Qin Sang wasn't entirely confident in his ability to kill him, and secondly, he had ascended the mountain seeking Soul Formation opportunities. With a clear objective in mind, he was unwilling to create further complications and had temporarily tolerated Su Zi'nan.</p><p>However, given the chance, Qin Sang would not hesitate to strike and eliminate this fiend.</p><p>Yue Fei's warning and Crane皋 Real Master's recent reprimand both indicated that Old Devil Lu wasn't trapped in the Hall of Delusion like Sage Hui Guang, but had ascended, leaving this realm.</p><p>Killing Su Zi'nan would no longer invite retribution from Old Devil Lu.</p><p>Matters of the lower realm would be settled in the lower realm.</p><p>If he truly ascended one day, he could consider Old Devil Lu's threat then. According to Ghost Mother, the vast expanse of the Great Thousand World made such encounters unlikely.</p><p>This moment was both a crisis and an opportunity.</p><p>Similar to when he first gained control of the Sun Divine Tree, Qin Sang had virtually no mastery over the six Divine Birds.  Awakening them was his limit.</p><p>Their power was undeniable, but they lacked finesse.</p><p>If his opponent didn't confront them head-on, he could easily miss.</p><p>Especially against an opponent like Su Zi'nan, a descendant of a Soul Formation cultivator, possessing countless secret treasures and divine abilities, with two demonic souls acting as vanguard while his true body remained elusive, he was the most difficult type of adversary.</p><p>Su Zi'nan, fixated on seizing the Five Elements Elixir, attacked without reservation, merging his three souls to forcefully block Qin Sang from rescuing his avatar.  This was precisely the opportunity Qin Sang sought.</p><p>However, any unusual activity from the six Divine Birds on the Sun Divine Tree would alert anyone, even a fool, to their increased power compared to just three.</p><p>Su Zi'nan was clearly not a fool.</p><p>The Five Elements Elixir was ultimately an external object. If the situation proved unfavorable, Su Zi'nan would never fight to the death.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Qin Sang acted decisively. He didn't hesitate to awaken the Gu King within his dantian, forcing out the venomous light to delay Su Zi'nan's reaction.</p><p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p><p>The branches of the Sun Divine Tree instantly emptied.</p><p>The Divine Birds traced six streaks of crimson flame across the void, blazing brightly and illuminating the interior of the sword formation with a dazzling scarlet glow.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's strenuous guidance, the trajectories of the six crimson flames converged, ultimately merging in the void.  The resulting inferno was blinding, its spiritual fire aura reaching a frenzied peak. The forms of the Divine Birds were completely obscured, leaving only a mass of crimson flames.</p><p>Qin Sang's True Essence was instantly depleted, and a wave of weakness washed over him.</p><p>He gasped for air, feeling a sense of suffocation. His vision was filled with nothing but the inferno, and a look of astonishment appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The consumption of summoning all six birds was even more terrifying than he had anticipated. He could only manage to awaken them and trace the simplest, most direct trajectory before his True Essence was exhausted, forcing the attack outward.</p><p>From this point on, the Southern Bright Emberfire was completely beyond his control.  Whatever lay in its path, even if it were himself, would suffer the same fate.</p><p>Its power seemed to be more than just the sum of three additional Divine Birds…</p><p>Su Zi'nan, facing the inferno directly, felt this even more acutely.</p><p>The venomous light hadn't disappointed Qin Sang.</p><p>The toxin ravaged the giant demonic soul, shaking it to its core.  By the time the three demonic souls combined to suppress the venomous light, they witnessed the Blood Scar being consumed by an inferno.</p><p>The formidable Blood Scar offered almost no resistance.</p><p>The blood pouring from the Blood Scar instantly evaporated in the inferno, vanishing without a trace along with the scar itself, leaving only billowing flames.</p><p>The inferno radiated a violent aura beyond Su Zi'nan's comprehension. He couldn't fathom what kind of flame possessed such power. How could a mere Nascent Soul late-stage cultivator control such force?</p><p>The giant demonic soul's pupils dilated, its eyes reflecting the crimson of the inferno, filled with terror and unease, mirroring Su Zi'nan's inner turmoil.</p><p>Its mouth opened wide, but as if its throat were constricted, it couldn't utter a sound. The terror in its eyes intensified. In an instant, the inferno surged forward, closing in. The giant demonic soul seemed to be melting.</p><p>At this moment, Su Zi'nan felt nothing but endless regret.</p><p>If he hadn't been so determined to obtain the Five Elements Elixir, he wouldn't have clashed head-on with Qin Sang.  He could have used his two demonic souls as a shield and retreated unscathed, even if it meant forcing Qin Sang to reveal his trump card.</p><p>If it weren't for the Gu King's venomous light, he would have had a chance to react when the six Divine Birds were summoned.</p><p>Now, it was too late.</p><p>Within the sword formation, sword stars arrayed themselves, their starlight pure, transforming into a celestial domain.</p><p>In the depths of this starry sky, one sword star was tainted by dense blood energy, its light turning crimson, transforming into an ominous blood star. Yet, neither the starlight nor the bloodlight could compare to the brilliance of the inferno.</p><p>The giant demonic soul, standing before the inferno, trembled, its legs shaking as if attempting to retreat, but before it could dodge, it was swallowed by the flames, following the same fate as the Blood Scar.</p><p>In the next moment, the faint outline of a fiery figure appeared within the inferno. The figure flailed its arms, resembling the desperate struggles of a dying man. Its body shrank at an alarming rate, until even its outline vanished.</p><p>Having devoured the giant demonic soul, the inferno continued its relentless advance.</p><p>Like a fiery meteor piercing the celestial domain, it plunged from the outer reaches of the nine heavens into this starry sky, unstoppable, crashing into the blood formation created by the Soul Burning Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>The blood formation was already operating at its peak.</p><p>Countless spectral blood creatures lunged towards the sword star.</p><p>Empowered layer upon layer, the surfaces of blood bubbles churned with thick blood plasma. Distorted, agonized faces emerged from the plasma, but due to their sheer density, they were immediately dragged back down by other spectral blood creatures, accompanied by heart-wrenching roars and screams. This was a scene reminiscent of the legendary Yellow Springs.</p><p>Anyone caught in the center of the blood formation would not escape the Soul Burning Tribulation.</p><p>'Gurgle...'</p><p>Amidst the churning sounds of blood plasma, the snapping of strings could seemingly be heard.</p><p>It sounded as if the void itself was rupturing, but in reality, it was the sound of the sword intent barrier collapsing under the onslaught of the blood formation.  The starlight within the blood bubbles was almost completely extinguished.</p><p>This sword star was on the verge of destruction.</p><p>The avatar hidden within faced a life-or-death crisis.</p><p>Given a little more time, Su Zi'nan's blood formation would have consumed the sword star, and his objective would have been achieved.  But that moment would never arrive.</p><p>The vanguard of the Southern Bright Emberfire plunged into the blood formation. Judging by its trajectory, it wasn't aiming for the center of the blood formation. Otherwise, it would be destroying the avatar instead of rescuing it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The blood formation reacted to the aura of the Southern Bright Emberfire, sending towering waves of blood surging. Then, the blood formation counterattacked, forcing the blood waves back, crashing them against the inferno.</p><p>However, upon contact with the inferno, the blood waves instantly evaporated.</p><p>The stable blood formation was torn open by the inferno, and a torrent of fire surged through the breach, sweeping everything in its path.</p><p>Bloodlight flashed, runes shattered, countless spectral blood creatures perished. The blood formation could no longer mount an effective defense and was ultimately pierced by the fire torrent.</p><p>Like a destructive flood, accompanied by deafening roars, a vast empty space appeared on one side of the blood formation, marking the path of the inferno.</p><p>The formation was utterly destroyed!</p><p>The bloodlight abruptly dimmed, and the remaining sections of the blood formation disintegrated. The bloodlight encasing the sword star burst like a true blood bubble.</p><p>The runes within the formation dissipated, and the spectral blood creatures vanished without a trace, their origin and destination unknown.</p><p>Starlight pierced through the residual blood plasma.</p><p>The sword star reappeared, far less radiant than before. Within, a shadowy figure sat in meditation, a square seal hovering above its head, a winged serpent coiling around its body – it was Qin Sang's avatar.</p><p>The avatar opened its eyes, the shock still lingering.</p><p>Just now, the Southern Bright Emberfire had brushed past him, an experience akin to facing it directly.  For a moment, he had the illusion that he, along with the blood formation, would be crushed by the torrent of fire.</p><p>As the obscuring blood bubbles dissipated, his vision returned. Before the avatar could clearly see its surroundings, it heard a scream.</p><p>The scream came from Su Zi'nan.</p><p>The instant his giant demonic soul was devoured by the Southern Bright Emberfire, Su Zi'nan spared no effort, using a reversal technique to pull himself back from his demonic soul state, narrowly avoiding sharing the fate of his two demonic souls.</p><p>However, due to the venomous light, his actions were delayed, and his true body lost the chance to escape unscathed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Su Zi'nan's physical body suddenly burst into flames.</p><p>Returning to his true body, Su Zi'nan's expression immediately contorted in agony as he let out a piercing scream. The flames erupted from within, burning through his robes.</p><p>His naked body was exposed, revealing half of it charred black, nearly reduced to a cinder, with faint, illusory flames flickering outwards, threatening to consume him entirely.</p><p>It was clear that while Su Zi'nan hadn't perished on the spot, he had been struck by the Southern Bright Emberfire and was now suffering from the lingering effects of the spiritual fire.</p><p>Not only him, but the Three Corpses Soul-Devouring Banner standing beside him also showed signs of igniting. However, with the two demonic souls already perished, the Southern Bright Emberfire didn't spread to it.  Still, the banner's appearance had clearly changed.</p><p>Originally, three human heads adorned the banner. After Su Zi'nan murdered Old Wu and Elder Yan Shan, they had transformed into two human figures and a single head.</p><p>Now, the human figures were gone, leaving behind two red marks with spreading embers. Two holes had been burned through the banner.  The faceless head remained, but it was much more indistinct than before, seemingly on the verge of dissipating.</p><p>With the release of the six birds, the souls perished, the banner was damaged, and the formation was broken!</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>Su Zi'nan's physical body, Nascent Soul, and Primordial Spirit were all consumed by fire, suffering unbearable pain that penetrated to his very core.  Grievously wounded, his life force rapidly ebbed away. His screams were filled with boundless grief, despair, and madness.</p><p>He deeply regretted that his pursuit of the Five Elements Elixir had led to the ruin of his promising future.</p><p>He harbored immense hatred, a bone-deep resentment towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Yet, his reason hadn't been completely lost.  He was still alive, and being alive represented hope. As long as he could seize a sliver of a chance, he could recover and seek vengeance.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A blue light suddenly appeared beneath Su Zi'nan's feet, transforming into a small, round mirror.</p><p>The edges of the mirror were transparent, resembling ice crystals. Its surface rippled as if connected to another place.</p><p>The mirror expanded, its blue light intensifying, forming a circular pattern several feet in diameter.  Within, ripples appeared, dark and deep like an ancient well, resembling a watery portal.</p><p>This treasure was Elder Yan Shan's Thousand Worlds Mirror. He had relied on it to escape Qin Sang and take the water-attribute legacy.  After Elder Yan Shan was captured by Su Zi'nan, this treasure fell into his hands.</p><p>With the demonic souls absorbed into the banner, everything belonging to Elder Yan Shan was plundered by Su Zi'nan.</p><p>Including the Thousand Worlds Mirror, which Su Zi'nan could now utilize. Wary of Sage Hui Guang, he had made thorough preparations before taking action, setting up the Thousand Worlds Mirror elsewhere.  The Five Elements Divine Restriction, riddled with flaws, could no longer confine anyone.</p><p>Once he obtained the elixir, he would immediately flee Mount Di Shou.</p><p>However, Su Zi'nan never imagined he would escape in this manner, his hatred intensifying further.</p><p>The water rippled gently, and Su Zi'nan, clutching the damaged banner, leaped into the mirror.</p><p>A streak of pure white, icy energy shot out from the center of the blood formation.</p><p>In an instant, a layer of frost covered the surface of the mirror, freezing the water.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The mirror shattered.</p><p>Simultaneously, images of the mirror flickered across the mountain walls of Mount Di Shou, forming a path of icy mirrors leading directly outside the mountain. But as the mirrors continued to appear, faint figures emerged on their surfaces, followed by the continuous sound of shattering. Each time a mirror appeared, frost spread across it, freezing and shattering both the mirror and the figure within.</p><p>Until the last mirror shattered.</p><p>Within the sword formation, the mirror lay in pieces, and Su Zi'nan's figure reappeared, his despairing eyes reflected in the flying shards.</p><p>He knew Elder Yan Shan had used the Thousand Worlds Mirror in front of Qin Sang, but once set, the mirror was incredibly difficult to counter, even with foreknowledge.  He never imagined that Qin Sang had inherited the knowledge of a previous Thousand Worlds Mirror master in the North Sea, understanding the mirror's crucial weakness, and using Ice Soul Divine Light to sever Su Zi'nan's escape route.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Su Zi'nan transformed into a streak of bloodlight, refusing to give up, burning half his blood essence to execute a blood escape.</p><p>Suddenly, a winged serpent descended from the sky, its long tail whipping down, striking the bloodlight. A scream echoed, and a gray shadow tumbled out from the bloodlight, instantly frozen into an ice sculpture by the pursuing chill.</p><p>All of this transpired in the blink of an eye, from the Divine Birds' attack to the avatar's imprisonment of the nascent soul.</p><p>The torrent formed by the Southern Bright Emberfire, having demolished the blood formation, continued its relentless advance until the flames destabilized, rapidly expanding into a massive fireball, spewing countless sparks.</p><p>Like a great sun, it dimmed the surrounding stars.</p><p>Even more violent was the fireball's interior. As the Southern Bright Emberfire fully erupted, cracks appeared around the flames. The surrounding sword stars were drawn towards it by some unseen force, attempting to contain the spreading fire, but the power of the sword formation couldn't suppress the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Visible from outside the mountain, the golden section of the Five Elements Divine Restriction's cloud canopy became turbulent, a fissure appearing at its center as bursts of crimson fire shot outwards.</p><p>The sword formation, established by the entire might of the Formless Immortal Sect generations ago, was torn apart by the Southern Bright Emberfire, its very foundation shaken!</p><p>Qin Sang, suppressing the toxin, his expression drastically changing, looked up sharply. He saw flying swords circling the sky, the suspended lake tainted with demonic energy, and caught sight of a pair of alluring eyes.</p><p>Seeing the bursts of spiritual fire erupting from the cloud canopy, those eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
