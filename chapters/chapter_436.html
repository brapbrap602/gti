<h1>Chapter 429: The Blood-Soaked Man</h1><p>An elderly man sat within the stone house. He hadn't concealed his identity. In fact, within the entire trade fair, those completely shrouded like Qin Sang were in the minority.</p><p>The elder, with his white hair and beard, had a kind face. Seeing Qin Sang enter, he immediately rose and inquired, "Welcome, fellow Daoist. What are you looking to purchase?"</p><p>The elder's stone house appeared empty, but this was merely a facade.</p><p>Qin Sang sat before the elder and opened his palm, revealing a token. This token was a symbol of the Sky Spear Tower.</p><p>"Did you bring the item I ordered last time?"</p><p>"So it's Daoist Qingfeng!"</p><p>The elder's face lit up with joy, then turned cautious. He waved his hand, activating the stone house's restrictions, and retrieved a small pouch from the back. From within, he took two jade vials and handed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Daoist, please take a look. Do these two vials of spirit pills meet your requirements?"</p><p>Qin Sang opened a vial. A fragrant aroma wafted out. They were indeed the foundation-strengthening spirit pills he needed, though their quality was inferior to even Spirit Gathering Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, then retrieved a spirit sword and handed it to the elder.</p><p>"This is the spirit sword I ordered previously. Please inspect it."</p><p>This spirit sword, infused with Coldsteel, was traded for the two vials of spirit medicine, a loss for Qin Sang. But with the current unstable situation, he couldn't afford to be picky.</p><p>He had originally planned to save the spirit swords he had accumulated, hoping to sell them for a good price when the opportunity arose.</p><p>Now, most were exchanged for medicine. Though their efficacy was only passable, Qin Sang endured it. Increasing his strength quickly was paramount.  Ideally, he'd reach the Pseudo Core Formation stage before the chaos erupted.</p><p>After the elder confirmed the sword, Qin Sang put away the spirit pills and rose to leave.</p><p>Seeing this, the elder quickly stood up. "Daoist, wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone hardened slightly. "What other business do you have? Are you not satisfied with the spirit sword?"</p><p>"No, no…"</p><p>The elder waved his hands repeatedly. "Daoist, please don't misunderstand.  I'm relaying a message from above. Your sword-refining skills are exquisite. Wouldn't it be a pity to let them go to waste? We can deliver spirit materials here. You only need to focus on refining swords. The compensation will be the same as before."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then shook his head. "I've already wasted much time on refining.  Cultivation is my priority now. I have no plans to start refining again for the time being.  However, once my cultivation improves and I no longer need to worry about it, I will resume refining. My cooperation with the Sky Spear Tower has been pleasant. I'll contact you then."</p><p>He wasn't lying. He had devoted himself to learning sword refining these past years. If not for the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, his cultivation would have progressed even slower.</p><p>At least before reaching Pseudo Core Formation, Qin Sang had no intention of refining swords again.</p><p>The elder, pleased with Qin Sang's reply, didn't press further and saw him off with a bow. "Then we await your good news."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and turned to leave the stone house.</p><p>More people had gathered in the main hall now.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing it was still early, patiently browsed the hall.  There were indeed some noteworthy treasures, but they were too expensive, not worth the cost.</p><p>After a cursory look, Qin Sang was about to leave and return to the herb garden when he suddenly heard a loud 'bang'.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The hall fell silent. Everyone's expression changed, and all eyes turned to the source of the noise.</p><p>The door of the stone house at the hall's exit had been forced open by a blood-soaked figure. The person collapsed onto the ground, curled up, and groaned in pain.</p><p>Then, the tiger-masked guard flew out from behind.</p><p>Witnessing this, the attendees assumed this person had forced their way into the trade fair, offending the guard and being beaten into this state. They looked at the guard with awe.</p><p>The blood-soaked figure was severely injured and his aura was weak, yet his cultivation couldn't be concealed: he was a late-stage Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>A late-stage Core Formation cultivator, beaten into this state by the guard! And the fight had ended so quickly, without any warning. It seemed the guard's strength far exceeded expectations.</p><p>How could the crowd not be shocked?</p><p>However, just as they were thinking this, the blood-soaked figure struggled to his feet and shouted hoarsely, "Celestial Alliance scoundrels are attacking! Ambushing us! Quickly… quickly save them…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, he collapsed unconscious.  He had reached his limit, barely making it here.</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"The Celestial Alliance is attacking!"</p><p>"Impossible! There was no sign!"</p><p>…</p><p>The blood-soaked man's words caused an uproar.</p><p>Caught off guard, no one expected the Celestial Alliance to attack suddenly. Although the trade fair was hidden, the appearance of the injured man suggested the battlefield wasn't far. They would certainly be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Though dozens of Core Formation cultivators were gathered at the trade fair, if the Celestial Alliance launched a full-scale attack on the Small Cold Region, they wouldn't just send Core Formation cultivators. How could everyone not panic?</p><p>Just then, the guard rushed to the injured man, lifted him, and announced loudly, "It may not be a Celestial Alliance attack. There might be other circumstances.  Everyone, please remain calm…"</p><p>The guard then flashed to another stone house and shouted, "Help!"</p><p>A middle-aged woman in palace attire hurried out, crouched beside the injured man, examined him, then took a spirit pill from her pouch and fed it to him.</p><p>Simultaneously, she pressed several points on his body, injecting obscure spiritual energy.</p><p>With the spirit pill and the woman's mysterious technique, the man's breathing stabilized.</p><p>The crowd suppressed their unease, anxiously watching the woman, hoping the medicine would take effect quickly, allowing the man to awaken and explain what happened.</p><p>No one dared to leave hastily. Unaware of the Celestial Alliance army's movements, they might run straight into them – a dead end!</p><p>Hidden in the crowd, Qin Sang's heart leaped into his throat. He didn't know whether this was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Though he had stumbled upon this unexpected event, he had learned of the change beforehand. This could be an advantage. Otherwise, he would have been trapped in the herb garden, oblivious until it was too late.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, discreetly moving closer to the stone house's entrance, ready to escape once he learned the details.</p><p>He had already grasped the Ten Yama Banners in his palm, and the Ebony Sword was secretly prepared.</p><p>He wasn't going to stick with the group.  Traveling together would make them too big a target.  Carrying valuable treasures, he just needed to act discreetly, avoid attracting the attention of the Celestial Alliance's Golden Core cultivators, and escaping shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The question was, what was the scale of this Celestial Alliance attack?</p><p>Time seemed to stretch endlessly as everyone nervously watched the blood-soaked man.</p><p>The woman in palace attire, drenched in sweat from her efforts, exclaimed after a while, "He's awake!"</p>
