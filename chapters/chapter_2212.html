<h1>Chapter 2202: The Rakshasa's Desolate Heart Array</h1><p>The dragonfish's power is truly formidable. As long as the black tower remains standing, the immortal child has a chance of breaking the Four Symbols Sword Array.</p><p>There's no opportunity to use the Cloud Touring Sword now.  Facing a late-stage Void Refinement expert, Qin Sang doesn't dare hope for a quick victory.  Forcing the immortal child to use a trump card now is actually a good thing.</p><p>However, the dragonfish beast companion's displayed strength still exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Even the beast companions of the Imperial Master and the Young Master were no match for it.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, considering countermeasures.</p><p>He had been carefully observing the immortal child's demeanor and actions. He noticed that after the immortal child consumed the blood pill, they became even more agitated, relentlessly charging towards the Chaos Star Nebula.</p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered, a possibility occurring to him. The potency of that blood pill might not last very long.</p><p>The blood pill's power is too ferocious.  Common sense dictates that such a powerful pill's effects cannot be sustained for long, and the user would bear immense pressure. Of course, the abilities of Saint Realm experts cannot be judged by common sense. If this pill was a gift from the immortal child's ancestor, it might be an exception.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't verify whether this judgment was true or false, but the immortal child's expression and actions could serve as circumstantial evidence.  If there's a fifty percent chance, he can use it as a basis to formulate a strategy: to do everything possible to delay, to hold the immortal child here, and wait for the blood pill's power to wane!</p><p>Of course, destroying the black tower would be even better!</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang continued to unleash his thunder techniques, fiercely attacking the black tower, trying various thunder talismans and secret arts, bombarding the tower relentlessly.</p><p>The black tower trembled violently, appearing on the verge of collapse, but every time it showed signs of crumbling, the immortal child would repair it in time, stabilizing it once more.</p><p>After a few rounds, Qin Sang made a new discovery. For the immortal child to repair the black tower remotely, they must first shake the sword array. At that moment, the dragonfish would erupt, either whipping its tail or charging with its head, both with unparalleled power, causing the star sea to churn. This would impede their advance, and the immortal child would be forced to do this to protect the black tower.</p><p>This shows that the sword array's restrictions still exist. Qin Sang's fierce assault on the black tower, even if it cannot destroy it, can still contain the immortal child.</p><p>However, this only buys time and cannot prevent the immortal child and the dragonfish from approaching the Chaos Star Nebula.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Cold light formed layers of waves, following the dragonfish, like the Milky Way, vast and boundless, leaving clear traces among the stars.</p><p>The immortal child rode the dragonfish, traversing the star sea, riding the wind and waves. Unfortunately, they always face the obstruction of a powerful enemy: the Thunder Beast Guard!</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard's attacks were too fast. Its figure was indistinct; only countless thunderbolts surrounding the immortal child and the dragonfish could be seen, constantly attacking.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The thunderbolts suddenly converged towards one spot.</p><p>The next moment, a thunder disc formed of lightning appeared above the immortal child's head, shining brightly.</p><p>Boundless thunder power gathered above the thunder disc, manifesting its true form, like a towering thunder mountain.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard appeared on the thunder disc, raising the thunder mountain and smashing it down towards the dragonfish's head!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The thunder's power was as deep as an abyss, the thunder light like a waterfall.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard's fighting style was extremely fierce, each attack powerful and forceful. Even facing the blood pill-enhanced dragonfish, it didn't yield in momentum.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The dragonfish roared, its roar filled with anger.</p><p>Its dragon eyes shot out beams of light, and the two whiskers on its mouth shot up, transforming into long whips, moving like wind and thunder, fiercely lashing out at the thunder mountain.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The thunder mountain faltered, then shattered. Amid the chaotic lightning, the Thunder Beast Guard flew back, narrowly avoiding the whiskers. But the dragonfish's movement also paused slightly.</p><p>Being able to stop the dragonfish for a moment achieved the Thunder Beast Guard's purpose. It quickly regained its footing, the whip marks left on its chest by the whiskers healing at a visible speed, before continuing its assault.</p><p>At this time, many dragon scales on the dragonfish were damaged, but the dragonfish remained unaffected. The Thunder Beast Guard, seemingly formed of thunder, was equally fearless of injury, its fighting spirit always high, steadfastly carrying out Qin Sang's will.</p><p>After forcing back the Thunder Beast Guard again, the immortal child secretly grew anxious. The dragonfish had tried various divine abilities, but could only force back the Thunder Beast Guard, unable to kill it.</p><p>The Dragon Fish's increasingly powerful displays left the Thunder Beast Guards increasingly unfazed—a worrying sign.  Logically, the Immortal Child had four spirit beasts, and their combined power boosted his Dan energy.  Rotating them should have been enough to last until he reached the Chaos Nebula.</p><p>The problem wasn't a lack of desire to switch beasts, but rather, the others were far weaker than the Dragon Fish.  Of the four, only the Dragon Fish was truly adept at combat.</p><p>The root cause lay in his lack of fighting experience in the Sacred Land.  He'd initially deemed the Dragon Fish's power sufficient and prioritized other qualities when choosing the rest.</p><p>For example, one beast was a Wandering Crane, a swift mount, but inferior to truly powerful flying creatures, let alone Qin Sang's lightning-fast escapes.  He valued the Crane's unique and elegant physique, believing it added to his "immortal" image.  Having it accompany him while reciting poetry was considered supremely refined, a source of envy for others.</p><p>His other spirit beasts possessed some combat capabilities, but he was facing suicidal Thunder Beast Guards and an equally reckless Qin Sang!</p><p>The Dragon Fish's ferocity overwhelmed the guards at times, leaving openings. Before they could react, Qin Sang, the main strategist, would personally charge into the fray!</p><p>Physical strength was Qin Sang's weakness.  Even with the Sun Wheel and Inner Lion seals, this was incredibly risky.  He could have remained hidden, using ranged attacks with lightning spells or sword techniques.  Without breaking the sword formation, there was little chance of harming him.</p><p>Instead, Qin Sang recklessly exposed himself, sometimes only to momentarily block the Dragon Fish, even if it meant injury.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's audacity, the Immortal Child repeatedly attempted to capture him, but failed.  The last time, Qin Sang's pale face and bloodstained lips left a lasting impression on the Immortal Child.</p><p>Before this, he'd never encountered anyone so ruthless and fearless.  He felt a profound chill, a hint of… fear!</p><p>"Heh heh…"</p><p>The Immortal Child heard a mocking laugh.</p><p>"Friend, how long has it been since you've truly fought for your life?" the voice echoed, taunting him.</p><p>The Immortal Child remained silent, unable to answer.  How long? Had he ever truly faced this kind of life-or-death struggle?</p><p>He recalled a time in his distant past, at the Yuan Realm fourth stage. Believing his powers were growing, he ventured from his ancestor's domain and almost died to a beast horde, only saved by his senior brother.  Whether that counted or not, he wasn't sure.</p><p>The Sacred Land was vast and sparsely populated.  The ancestors' domains were strictly demarcated.  Though interaction wasn't forbidden, nobody dared trespass to compete for resources.  Serious conflict was rare; cultivators freely shared resources.  Those inclined to socialize could attend Dao discussions, where sparring was gentle.</p><p>Leisure time was spent with friends, drinking, composing poetry, enjoying an idyllic life.  When dispatched to the lower realms by their ancestors, the tribespeople treated them with utmost respect, fueling their arrogance.  They viewed the Sacred Land as a paradise, considering the inhabitants of the Mist Sea as "commoners."</p><p>Even those of high status, like the clan leader and elders, fiercely competed for the Sacred Land's treasures, sometimes even perishing in the attempt.  Many of these prized possessions were left by the ancestors.  They only had to wait for their ancestors' emergence, serving diligently, hoping for a generous reward.</p><p>He, and his brothers Tang and Qi, likely had limited experience with life-or-death combat.</p><p>Reconsidering the pursuit of Qin Sang, were there truly no chances to capture him?  Tang was hesitant, always letting others take the lead.  Opportunities might have arisen, but they were fleeting, missed by them.</p><p>Suddenly, the Immortal Child jolted awake, breaking out in a cold sweat. In this critical moment, the enemy's words had stirred so many distracting thoughts.</p><p>The fierce battle continued; both sides were numb, fixated on their goals.  Despite Qin Sang's efforts, the Immortal Child and the Dragon Fish drew closer to the Chaos Nebula.  The connection between the Immortal Child and the Black Tower grew stronger, filling him with renewed determination.</p><p>Just then, Xian Tong noticed the Thunder Beast Guard's attack slowing.</p><p>"So you are not invulnerable..."</p><p>This thought filled Xian Tong with joy. He immediately ordered the dragon fish to seize the opportunity and attack fiercely.  They had reached the edge of the Eastern Azure Dragon Sword Formation, not far from the northern Chaos Nebula, and could break through with a final push.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The fish's tail thrashed violently, sending out a wave of energy that instantly detonated the surrounding sword stars.</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guard flashed before the dragon fish, its thunder spear aimed at its forehead. The dragon fish didn't dodge, a patch of green scales appearing on its forehead, stubbornly resisting the spear, preventing it from penetrating.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The dragon fish struck with all its might. The Thunder Beast Guard trembled violently, its thunder spear shattering. Simultaneously, the surrounding thunder talismans and sword light were repelled.</p><p>Murderous intent flickered in Xian Tong's eyes. If Qin Sang dared to appear now, he would ensure his demise.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't appear. The dragon fish leaped, and Xian Tong finally saw the Chaos Nebula clearly.</p><p>Instantly, Xian Tong and the dragon fish felt the restricting force lessen, like a fish leaping over a dragon gate, a dragon entering the sea!</p><p>Despite achieving their goal so easily, Xian Tong felt a growing unease. His premonition was correct; a previously unseen energy fluctuation caused him to change color abruptly.</p><p>Outside the sword formation.</p><p>The fierce battle raged within the formation, but the powerful aftershocks still affected the outside. The poisonous river had been completely disrupted.</p><p>Anyone standing on the riverbank could see the unrelenting waves, as if the river was about to be shattered at any moment.</p><p>In the murky riverbed, around the battlefield, several areas were darker than others. There were seven such spots, where the river's potent poison continuously gathered. During Qin Sang and Xian Tong's duel, it had accumulated to a terrifying degree.</p><p>A quantitative change led to a qualitative change. The poison underwent a strange transformation, becoming denser, gradually solidifying, eventually forming huge disks.</p><p>The seven disks were roughly the same size, the same color as the river water but darker.  Clear patterns and runes were visible on their surfaces.</p><p>The runes on each disk were different, depicting a Rakshasa demon, lifelike and varied, but all ferocious and terrifying.</p><p>Seven Rakshasa demons flew from the disks, encircling the battlefield, their eyes vicious, their mouths agape, emitting ghostly howls.</p><p>This was the Rakshasa Remnant Heart Formation, the strongest poison formation recorded in the *Poison God Canon*. Qin Sang had secretly refined the river's poison, finally deploying the formation now!</p><p>Xian Tong, having just broken the Four Symbols Sword Formation, encountered the Rakshasa Remnant Heart Formation. The piercing howls felt like they stabbed into his soul, shocking him. He felt a sudden sense of foreboding; his snake scales couldn't stop the poison's invasion, and his body felt strange.</p><p>Seeing the surrounding scene and sensing the formation's power plunged Xian Tong into despair. He'd spent too long in the Four Symbols Formation; his spiritual energy probably wouldn't be enough to break this one.</p><p>He seemed to have only one choice left...</p><p>Xian Tong closed his eyes. The dragon fish roared towards the sky, its cry tinged with sorrow. It detached from its master and hurtled forward.</p><p>Instantly, its body began to swell, its scales clattering, and thick blood energy surged from the gaps between them.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The poisonous river was cut off!</p><p>The dragon fish self-destructed!</p><p>Companion beast self-destruction was a life-saving technique every Si You Clan cultivator learned at the beginning of their cultivation. Numerous such techniques existed, but one rule remained constant: the greater the cost, the greater the power of the self-destruction; the ultimate cost being the permanent loss of the companion beast!</p><p>The dragon fish's self-destruction was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>'Clang clang clang...'</p><p>The seven disks trembled violently.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The first disk exploded, the Rakshasa demon perishing in terror, followed by the second, third...</p><p>The Rakshasa Remnant Heart Formation collapsed, and a bolt of lightning flew out—the Thunder Beast Guard, its thunder light dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared outside the formation, gasping.  Luckily, he had been prepared, and he and the Thunder Beast Guard had retreated in time.  The formation had absorbed most of the impact; otherwise, they would have been in grave danger!</p><p>The poisonous river was severed, the aftershocks of the dragon fish's self-destruction still rippling, blood energy rapidly spreading, the battlefield a crimson expanse.</p><p>Before the aftershocks fully dissipated, a ruthless look flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, and he charged back in.</p><p>His Xuanxu Divine Light enveloped him as he moved through the blood energy, quickly locating Xian Tong.</p><p>Xian Tong, having paid an unimaginable price for a sliver of life, was about to escape when he saw Qin Sang approaching. He had never seen such a relentless person. Even drenched in blood, his Ming Shan armor tattered, Qin Sang's eyes remained as bright and unwavering as the sun and moon!</p><p>"How long has it been since you fought for your life, Daoist friend?"  Xian Tong recalled his earlier words, letting out a bitter laugh, suddenly stopping, calmly looking at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, sensing an inexplicable threat, unsure what life-or-death tactic Xian Tong might still have.</p><p>He preferred capturing Xian Tong alive, but only if it was foolproof; otherwise, killing him would be better.</p><p>A sword light suddenly appeared.</p><p>It was a sword imbued with the power of a sword domain; though not comparable to the Yunyou Sword, it could still amaze the world!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword light pierced through his forehead.</p><p>Xian Tong's body stiffened, the light in his eyes quickly fading. The You Fang Crane beneath him exploded.</p>
