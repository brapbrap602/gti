<h1>Chapter 1962: The Sky Vein Sect</h1><p>A white mist drifted.</p><p>The Yin family members, traveling on their magical artifacts, moved slowly, stopping frequently. Yin Heqian's gaze swept across the forest, as if searching for something.</p><p>Two elders, a man and a woman, stood on either side of him.  Their hair was white, but their faces were youthful. Each held a compass-like artifact, carefully cradled in their palms, activating it with their spiritual energy.</p><p>At the center of each artifact, a round mirror-like surface emitted a faint glow, reflecting the elders' features.</p><p>The others also held their own artifacts, their faces guarded.</p><p>Nian Hui stood alone at the rear, her expression and demeanor as cold and detached as ever, seeming out of place among the others.</p><p>In fact, within the entire Yin family, only Yin Qiao'er could truly converse with her.  Nian Hui spent most of her time in seclusion; many younger members of the family didn't even know of her existence.</p><p>Yin Heqian's eyes shone with a silver light. After surveying the area, he asked in a low voice, "Elders, has the Yuanhui Twin Compass yielded any results? Have you discovered anything?"</p><p>The two elders remained silent, eyes closed, concentrating on manipulating the compass. After a stick of incense, they slowly spoke.</p><p>"Reporting to the Family Head, the flow of the mountain's energy veins here shows some traceable patterns, indeed somewhat matching the descriptions in ancient texts. However, time changes all things, and mountains shift. Whether this is truly the former site of the Ancient Sky Vein Sect still needs verification. But, if this is indeed the old site of the Sky Vein Sect, then the Pulse Xuan Tower must be here!"</p><p>The white-haired elder to Yin Heqian's left pointed towards the front and right, the woman nodding in agreement.</p><p>"Legend says the Pulse Xuan Tower is the Sky Vein Sect's most precious treasure, crucial to the sect's rise and fall.  But we don’t know what kind of treasure it is, or how powerful it is."</p><p>Yin Heqian maneuvered his artifact, flying towards the direction indicated by the white-haired elder, murmuring,</p><p>"It must be an invaluable treasure! With this treasure, Family Head, your power will be greatly enhanced, and the Yin family will surely prosper!"</p><p>"Exactly! I remember, decades ago, two thunderclaps shook Yan Kingdom, and then nothing more. At that time, news of the Sky Vein Sect's imminent reappearance began to spread secretly throughout the cultivation world. The Bai Li clan, Gu Yang Mountain, and Heng Yu Gate all sent people to search for many years, to no avail.  To find even a trace… If we obtain it first, it will be a clear sign of the Yin family's great fortune!"</p><p>…</p><p>Those around him echoed his words.</p><p>Yin Heqian showed no sign of pride. He shook his head slightly and calmly said, "It's too early to celebrate. Let's wait until the elders find conclusive evidence before rejoicing."</p><p>As they spoke, they flew over dozens of mountain ranges.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The white-haired elder suddenly stopped everyone. His artifact shone brightly; the mirror inside reflected a landscape, the very terrain surrounding them, as if viewed from high above.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the nearby terrain was rather peculiar.</p><p>The mountains didn’t appear unusual at first glance. However, when widening the view, they seemed slightly lower than the surrounding peaks, as if the earth itself had sunk.</p><p>Normally, this subtle difference might go unnoticed, but considering the information the Yin family had gathered, something was definitely amiss here!</p><p>"There's something strange!"</p><p>Yin Heqian used his spiritual sense to scan the area and discovered many caves.</p><p>The caves were noticeably denser than elsewhere, scattered haphazardly, without any discernible pattern. Some were on mountainsides, others in valleys, but they all had one thing in common: they led underground.</p><p>The surface showed no unusual features, no traces related to a 'tower'.  Finding the Pulse Xuan Tower might require entering the caves and searching underground.</p><p>However, with so many entrances, which one should they choose?</p><p>The ruins might contain remaining formations and restrictions left by the Sky Vein Sect.  Rushing in recklessly would only invite more trouble.</p><p>"Protect the elders!"</p><p>Yin Heqian shouted, and the others immediately dispersed, shielding the two elders in the center, jointly casting spells to conceal any unusual phenomena.</p><p>The two elders sat facing each other, raising their compasses until their bases touched, becoming one.</p><p>After a moment, they each spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood flowed into the Yuanhui Twin Compass, seeping into the reflected image.  It seemed that a space truly existed within, and the blood turned into bloodworms, each crawling into a different cave.</p><p>The Yuanhui Twin Compass trembled in their hands.  After a short while, it suddenly erupted with a burst of blood light, illuminating a specific area encompassing about twenty caves.</p><p>Everyone looked towards the corresponding area in reality.</p><p>"Family Head, we have done our best. The true entrance is likely in this vicinity," the white-haired elder said, his face etched with exhaustion.</p><p>Two elders, please!  Leave two to protect the elders; the rest, follow me!”</p><p>Yin Heqian soared above the area, finding no clues. He chose a cave and descended underground, others following closely.</p><p>Descending along the cave, the terrain gradually narrowed, then suddenly widened after a distance, spreading out like a spiderweb.</p><p>Initially, everyone tried using their spiritual sense to investigate, finding nothing unusual. However, as they continued deeper, they felt their spiritual sense inexplicably suppressed, even Yin Heqian, a Yuan Ying cultivator, was not immune.</p><p>"This must be the Tianmai Sect ruins!"</p><p>Someone exclaimed joyfully.</p><p>"Calm down!"</p><p>Yin Heqian reprimanded, looking at Nian Hui behind him, "Fourth Sister, any findings?"</p><p>Nian Hui looked around, took a jade cicada from her sleeve, and gently stroked its wings. The jade cicada came to life, its wings vibrating, emitting a low hum.</p><p>Invisible sound waves spread for an hour. She closed the cicada's wings, and it settled in her palm.</p><p>"Not here."</p><p>Nian Hui stated calmly.</p><p>The joy on everyone's faces faded, but no one questioned her. They all knew the power of the Nine-Sound Cicada, and Nian Hui wouldn't lie.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Yin Heqian decisively returned to the surface, chose another cave, and continued to descend.</p><p>This repeated several times. Finally, entering the eleventh cave, Nian Hui gave a completely different answer!</p><p>"There!"</p><p>Nian Hui's jade finger pointed to a passage and flew in first.</p><p>The cave was bottomless; they flew for a long time without reaching the end, but the anomalies within increased.</p><p>"There's another stone pool ahead!"</p><p>A Yin family member transmitted a message, his tone tense.</p><p>Nian Hui and Yin Heqian stopped by the pool.</p><p>A recess in the passage wall formed a square pit, its walls made of hard stone.  Similar stone pools had been seen in other caves.</p><p>The pool was empty.  The four walls were covered with indecipherable murals, their lines chaotic, seemingly carved directly into the stone with a blade. They were ancient and peculiar, defying description.</p><p>Despite their roughness, the murals held a strange allure, making it hard to look away.  After prolonged viewing, the two cultivators with the lowest cultivation levels felt dizzy and almost experienced spiritual energy disruption. The others felt a growing unease and chill the longer they examined them.</p><p>The others stopped, several deliberately averting their gaze, unable to bear the murals.</p><p>Fortunately, Nian Hui didn't linger and continued onward.</p><p>They went deeper, encountering more stone pools, the eerie atmosphere intensifying.</p><p>As the Yin family members delved deeper underground, others entered the area from different directions, more than one group.</p><p>In one passage, a group of four advanced silently.  Their leader, a man appearing forty years old with a goatee and sharp, intelligent eyes, seemed capable and shrewd.</p><p>This group belonged to the百里 (Baili) family, a renowned cultivation family near Yan. Originally a small family dependent on a cultivation sect, their successive heads possessed exceptional talent and foresight, leading to their growth.  Now, with three Yuan Ying ancestors, they were a significant force near Yan.</p><p>This man was one of the three ancestors, named Baili Qingkong.</p><p>"We've gone so far and still haven't reached the end. Near Yan, aside from the Tianmai Sect, there shouldn't be such a large ruin.  Unexpected that after so many years, it would resurface."</p><p>A young man with a folding fan spoke, his expression relaxed and carefree, seemingly appreciating the scenery.</p><p>"Third Uncle, only four of us, how long will it take to find the core of the ruins? Should we send a message back to the family?"</p><p>Baili Qingkong said calmly, "No need to alarm the head of the family and the Grand Elder yet."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The young man wisely fell silent.</p><p>The other two dared not speak, silently proceeding through the dark underground.</p><p>Similar scenes played out elsewhere.</p><p>For various reasons, they converged on this ruin at the same time.  Their strengths varied, and they were unaware of the numerous competitors around them.</p><p>...</p><p>"The thirteenth stone pool."</p><p>The young man counted the pools encountered, piecing together the mural contents in his mind.</p><p>Each mural differed; collecting all the pools might reveal further clues, but with only four of them, exploring the entire ruin would take a considerable time.</p><p>As the young man focused on piecing together the murals, a sudden tremor jolted him awake. He looked up to see Baili Qingkong enveloped in a hot wind, blowing towards him.</p><p>Recognizing this wind as his uncle's renowned escape technique, the young man offered no resistance, allowing the wind to carry him away from the ground.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Before the astonished eyes of everyone present, the tunnel walls began to crack, countless fissures spreading from the front.  The tremors grew more violent, as if the ground were about to collapse.  In this critical moment, Bai Li Qing Kong's eyes flashed with determination; instead of retreating, he advanced, his body surrounded by crimson flames, his speed dramatically increasing!</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, deep within the earth, the Yin family gathered around a stone pool. This pool was ten times larger than the others.  This was the end of the cavern; there was no path forward. Behind the pool stood a massive stone wall, dozens of meters high, covered in even larger and more intricate murals.  Yin He Qian and Nian Hui, positioned to the left and right, levitated before the wall, both extending their hands to press against it, as if trying to force open a pair of doors. The Yin family members behind them formed an array, chanting spells, wave after wave of blue light surging towards the wall like water, bolstering the efforts of the two in front.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>When the first tremor came from behind the wall, a fissure suddenly appeared in the center of the mural.  But before the Yin family could rejoice, disaster struck.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A terrifying force erupted from behind the wall, instantly shattering it into countless cracks, sending large and small stones tumbling down. The wall was about to collapse. The tremors continued unabated, the fissures expanding, and the cavern instantly became a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>A member of the Yin family cried out.</p><p>Yin He Qian's face was ashen. The change had occurred too quickly; there was no time to react, and nothing could be done to stop it. If the tremors were confined to the underground, they might have bought some time.  But if the entire relic collapsed, other cultivators would discover it immediately. Soon, the sects and factions around Yan Kingdom would be vying for a share of the spoils!</p><p>"Shift—"</p><p>Just as Yin He Qian was about to give an order, he sensed a powerful presence rapidly approaching, causing his heart to sink.  It was clear that the Yin family were not the only ones who had discovered this relic. The situation was far worse than anticipated; they had attracted rivals far sooner than expected!</p><p>In his haste, Yin He Qian failed to notice the unusual expression on Nian Hui's face.  Her eyes flickered slightly, revealing surprise and confusion. Gradually, she seemed to understand something, a hint of bitterness crossing her eyes.</p><p>"Change formation!"</p><p>Yin He Qian roared.</p><p>The Yin family members reacted swiftly and without panic, immediately altering their formation. They pushed forward with both hands, forming numerous blue crystal projectiles in front of them, which shot towards the collapsing wall. The already damaged wall, unable to withstand the onslaught, finally crumbled completely.</p><p>Behind the dust and debris, an ancient stone hall appeared. Its walls were covered with murals.  There was no floor; it resembled a bottomless well, leading into the unknown. Faintly, several glowing orbs could be seen deep within, likely the radiance of treasures.</p><p>Yin He Qian flew out from the rubble.  Upon seeing the scene within the hall, he was about to descend when a thunderous crack resounded behind him.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A red beam of light struck Yin He Qian from behind, accompanied by a hearty laugh.</p><p>"Yin Family Head, long time no see. Why the rush? Why not stop and chat for a while?"</p><p>A blue light appeared behind Yin He Qian. The two beams of light collided, instantly intertwining.  Yin He Qian wasn’t injured, but the intense impact forced him to stumble. He steadied himself, suppressing his anger, and shouted furiously, "Bai Li Qing Kong!"</p><p>...</p><p>Deeper within the earth, in a place unknown, a silent and dark space, a figure sat cross-legged on a cold stone. The tremors reached him, and he slowly opened his eyes, revealing sharp gaze—Shi, the young man. He lifted his head, seemingly able to perceive the scene above, through the earth. He 'saw' the three Bai Li family members, and Bai Li Qing Kong.</p><p>"Bai Li!"</p><p>Shi muttered these two words, his tone laced with chilling animosity. The Bai Li clan—the masterminds behind the massacre of the entire Sha family.  The once prominent Sha family had only one surviving direct descendant—himself. He had endured, biding his time until this day. The three Yuan Ying ancestors of the Bai Li clan rose to power by stepping on the corpses and drinking the blood of the Sha family. Along with the Bai Li clan, were other cultivators drawn to the site—cultivators who had also participated in the Sha family's downfall.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I've been home these past few days, a bit out of sorts, so updates have been unstable. Things will return to normal when I get back.  I owe you for the previous chapters.  This chapter is marked for later reconciliation.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
