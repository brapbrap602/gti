<h1>Chapter 446  Looking After</h1><p>"The Shadowless Sword is actually Senior Qin?"</p><p>Le Rou and her husband exchanged a glance, both with surprised expressions.  They had only recently arrived in the chaotic waters, but they had heard from friends about several prominent figures from both righteous and demonic cultivation sects, as well as independent cultivators, who were making waves on the battlefield.  Among them, the Shadowless Sword was a rare expert whose cultivation hadn't reached the False Core stage, yet whose reputation was unmatched by anyone else. He was said to possess superb swordsmanship, wielding a terrifying sword force, with his sword shadows being virtually invisible. Countless cultivators had fallen by his blade, causing the Sky Walker League cultivators to flee in terror. They never expected such a renowned figure to have a significant connection to them.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Du grunted.</p><p>"I once saw the Shadowless Sword fight against a Sky Walker League expert from afar. He controlled a gleaming flying sword, forcing his opponent to desperately evade. His swordsmanship was indeed extraordinary, but not as amazing as the legends say."</p><p>"However, there must be a reason for his great fame.</p><p>"It's said that what made the Shadowless Sword famous is another, very mysterious, flying sword. Legend has it that blood would always be shed when it was drawn. Some suspect it's a demonic artifact, while others say it can control thunder and is a sacred artifact.</p><p>"He comes from Mount Shao Hua; no one dares to delve into these matters and offend Mount Shao Hua.</p><p>"Since you know the Shadowless Sword, your previous worries are completely unnecessary.</p><p>"You two are quite powerful; build a good relationship with him. If you can get his protection and be accepted into his team, that's best.  At worst, you can ask him to introduce you to other experts from Mount Shao Hua…"</p><p>…</p><p>Regardless of Le Rou and the others' gossip behind his back, Qin Sang soared into the air, flying towards the northeast without looking back. When Stargazing Island appeared in his sight, Qin Sang flashed and landed on a large island to the northwest of Stargazing Island.</p><p>The architectural layout of this island was different from other islands. The streets were laid out in a grid pattern, and the houses were neatly arranged. Notably, many cultivators were walking on the streets.  Various signs hung outside the houses, indicating shops.  In the center of the island, there was a small auction house; seemingly inconspicuous, it was actually very popular.</p><p>In the Lesser Cold Region, apart from those guarding the Seven Heroes Pass and those who had found ways to avoid conscription, most Foundation Establishment cultivators had been summoned to the chaotic waters.  So many experts gathered in the small chaotic waters, leading to the frequent appearance of desirable treasures.</p><p>However, the most popular island was the northernmost one in the chaotic waters, known informally as Mist Island.</p><p>When Qin Sang landed on the island, he felt something and looked north. Standing on the island, one could see the edge of the northern mist sea, with Mist Island hidden within it.</p><p>It was said that the establishment of Mist Island was strongly requested by a Nascent Soul stage senior among the independent cultivators, and received unanimous support from all cultivators, including those from both righteous and demonic sects. Anyone, regardless of their identity, could enter Mist Island from any point in the mist sea by using a token.</p><p>On Mist Island, everyone could conceal their true identities and appearances to conduct transactions. After the transaction, they would leave Mist Island, and the formation would randomly relocate them to another location.</p><p>For this reason, countless cultivators came and went from Mist Island every day, far exceeding the number on the large island.  However, Mist Island had its advantages, and the large island had its own.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and walked down a street, finally arriving in front of a luxuriously decorated shop. Although it didn't have the Heavenly Spear Pavilion sign, it was indeed a branch of the Heavenly Spear Pavilion.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, you've finally arrived! Please, come in!"</p><p>Even though it wasn't the Heavenly Spear Pavilion from Qingyang Market, the manager was familiar with Qin Sang and enthusiastically came out to greet him, leading him into a secret room and personally serving tea.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "There's no need for tea. I hope the news you mentioned earlier is true. Don't let anything unexpected happen and disappoint me."</p><p>"Daoist Qin, where are you coming from? When have I ever lied to you?"</p><p>The manager pretended to be annoyed, waved his hand to close the restriction of the quiet room, took out a jade box, and handed it to Qin Sang, "Daoist Qin, take a look. Is this the Soul-Guiding Herb?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He looked down carefully. Inside the jade box was indeed a complete Soul-Guiding Herb, similar to the three he had bought at the Yin Mountain Pass auction, indicating that its age and medicinal properties were definitely sufficient.</p><p>He was very familiar with the Soul-Guiding Herb. Without opening the jade box, he confirmed that it was genuine, a satisfied expression appearing on his face.</p><p>The Soul-Guiding Herb was related to the refinement of living corpses.  Firstly, the Soul-Guiding Herb is a rare spiritual herb that can directly assist cultivation, which is of great significance to demonic and evil cultivators. Secondly, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman has almost demanding requirements for the quality of the Soul-Guiding Herb.</p><p>For three years, Qin Sang had searched everywhere but hadn't found a single one that met the requirements. Fortunately, he had bought three at the Yin Mountain Pass auction at the cost of a thousand-year-old spiritual herb; otherwise, refining living corpses would have been a long shot.</p><p>Although the Soul-Calling Grass is valuable, it didn't faze Qin Sang.  His expression remained calm as his gaze shifted from the jade box to the shopkeeper. He said mildly, "What price are you asking, friend?"</p><p>The shopkeeper, who had been subtly observing Qin Sang's reaction, calmly lowered his gaze.  After taking a sip of tea, he replied, "The uses of Soul-Calling Grass are surely known to you, Daoist Qin. If this shop were to send it to the east side of Stargazing Isle and make it public, it would undoubtedly cause a fierce struggle."</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, and he frowned slightly. "Friend, are you saying that the items I previously pledged with you... are insufficient to purchase the Soul-Calling Grass?"</p><p>The shopkeeper hastily shook his head, explaining repeatedly, "No, no, no... Daoist Qin, you misunderstand! I am deeply grateful for your trust in this humble establishment. Those magical artifacts are all of superior quality, and their combined value is more than enough. I am happy to sell the herb to you at this price to cultivate good fortune between us. However..."</p><p>He hesitated, then dipped his brush in tea and wrote a name on the table. "I only hope that, in consideration of my humble request, you would offer some assistance to this junior of mine. His cultivation is acceptable, and I have prepared several life-saving artifacts for him; he will certainly not be a burden."</p><p>Qin Sang noted the name on the table and, after some thought, said gravely, "Given my relationship with the Heavenly Spear Pavilion, if a fellow member of the Pavilion faces difficulties, it would be both reasonable and appropriate for me to offer assistance."</p><p>The shopkeeper breathed a sigh of relief, his face filled with gratitude. "With your assurance, Daoist Qin, I am at ease. I eagerly await good news from you. Please accept this Soul-Calling Grass!"</p><p>"Then I shall gratefully accept."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his sleeve, putting away the jade box. After exchanging all his spoils of war for spirit stones, he took his leave.</p><p>Instead of continuing to wander the main island, he pondered how to arrange for the shopkeeper's junior, and flew directly towards the Misty Sea.</p><p>Upon entering the Misty Sea, Qin Sang produced a token and cast a unique hand seal upon it.</p><p>The token emitted a faint light, connecting to the great formation. Qin Sang felt a tremor in the mist before him, and the next moment, an island appeared.</p>
