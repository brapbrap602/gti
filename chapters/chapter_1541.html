<h1>Chapter 1532: Central Plains (4k)</h1><p>At the last moment before the image disappeared, the skeletal bird seemed to sense something. It turned its head, its crimson eyes sweeping over, finally fixing on the scene.</p><p>Its gaze seemed to pierce through the shadow萤石, carrying an astonishing madness and ferocity, heavily striking the viewers' minds, causing a chilling sensation.</p><p>This feeling… it truly was a ferocious beast!</p><p>The image wasn't fake.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the shadow萤石 for a long time.</p><p>This skeletal bird was unlike the two ferocious beasts he'd encountered. He wondered how many more lurked deep within the storm.</p><p>The elder, having achieved his purpose, respectfully escorted Qin Sang into the cave dwelling. After obtaining permission, he summoned guards to stand watch outside, awaiting orders.</p><p>Then, the elder went down the mountain, circled around, and subtly entered the governor's mansion, stopping before an ancient wooden building by a lake. He bowed deeply, whispering a few words.</p><p>The wooden building remained silent.</p><p>A voice entered the elder's ears. He responded with a "yes," exited the governor's mansion, and resumed guarding the city gate.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed unaware of the elder's actions. After setting up several restrictions, he sat cross-legged in meditation, circulating his spiritual energy.</p><p>He washed away the dust and grime, and his inner true essence gradually recovered.</p><p>The journey to the Western Desert was long; he needed to rest before setting off.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, refreshed and invigorated. After playing with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly for a while, he remembered to sort through his storage ring.</p><p>Although he and Liuli had tried to conserve resources, most of their starting supply of spirit stones and elixirs were used up. For any future transactions involving Yuan Ying cultivators, he would have to resort to bartering.</p><p>He still didn't know the whereabouts of the Buddha bone relic, and he had to consider the possibility of needing to trade.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed numerous valuable treasures.</p><p>Two sticks of Spirit-Subduing Incense alone would be enough to make Yuan Ying cultivators scramble for them.</p><p>But these treasures couldn't be easily parted with. After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided that the Yang Puppet Crystal and the puppet infused with Yin Puppet Crystal were the most suitable items for trading.</p><p>For cultivators skilled in puppetry, these would be invaluable.  He believed they would have a way to separate the Yin Puppet Crystal.</p><p>His external avatar couldn't fuse with the puppet crystals, and his senior sister wasn't around. He had too much to do to waste time learning puppetry from scratch.</p><p>Trading them for favorable conditions and resources was the most logical choice.</p><p>After pondering for a while,</p><p>Qin Sang got up and left the cave dwelling.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Governor's Mansion.</p><p>A black-robed figure suddenly materialized on the tranquil lake surface, appearing before the wooden building. He gently knocked twice on the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>A refined voice came from inside.</p><p>The black-robed figure adjusted his clothes, pushed open the door, and bowed, addressing the occupant as "Big Brother."  Then, he eagerly said, "Someone below just sent word. That person has left seclusion and seems to be preparing to leave the city. He's traveling alone but spends lavishly, so his wealth must be considerable. Brother, why don't we send the signal?"</p><p>The room was sparsely furnished.</p><p>A cultivator in green robes sat cross-legged on a cushion, a censer with a burning incense stick placed before him, its fragrance delicate.</p><p>This person was the master of White Crow Mountain.</p><p>The cultivator in green slowly opened his eyes, his tone calm. "Someone who dares to travel alone, openly spending months in seclusion in unfamiliar territory… brother, do you think he wouldn't have any backup?"</p><p>The black-robed man chuckled. "His backup is merely a late-stage Golden Core cultivator. So what?  If we join forces with several nearby fellow cultivators, and add your skills, we might still be able to take him down."</p><p>The cultivator in green shook his head. "Our ability to maintain a foothold near the Northern Wasteland relies on caution. This kind of business, we might only do it once every twenty or thirty years. Otherwise, White Crow Mountain would have a terrible reputation. In recent years, due to the storm’s changes, more people have come and gone, and I couldn't resist the temptation, making my actions rather frequent.  Brother, you think you're being discreet, but you can't hide it from those who are paying attention."</p><p>The black-robed man wasn't stupid. He hesitated, "Brother, could you suspect he is…"</p><p>"The ferocious beasts have made the cultivation world uneasy. It's entirely normal for major factions to look for a base to observe the changes in the storm zone. The reputation of White Crow Mountain, built up over many years, has become a burden. I'm prepared to abandon the island and yield, and you should also consider it early. As for this person, whether he has ulterior motives or not…"</p><p>The cultivator in green paused.</p><p>"Let him be."</p><p>'Clap! Clap! Clap!'</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, applause suddenly rang out from the doorway.</p><p>Both men in the room instantly changed color.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The black-robed man spun around, a long dao already appearing in his hand.</p><p>He saw a Daoist priest standing at the doorway, his face like jade, his bearing refined, smiling at them as he applauded the green-robed cultivator's assessment.</p><p>A cloaked figure, his hair standing on end, realized someone had likely infiltrated with him undetected.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>He raised his blade to strike, but before the sword left its scabbard, a finger loomed rapidly before his eyes.  Darkness followed, and he collapsed, unconscious.</p><p>A man in a green robe had just risen, an iron-bone fan appearing in his palm.  Witnessing this, he froze, unable to move.</p><p>“Worthy of being the city lord. I had to come myself, since you didn’t seek me out,” a voice said.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the doorway.  He casually entered, pulled up a stool, and gestured towards a cushion. “Please, sit.”</p><p>The green-robed cultivator’s face was ashen, his eyes filled with terror.  Quickly regaining his composure, he dared not check on the cloaked figure’s condition.  He prostrated himself, saying, "Junior Han Ya greets senior.  I was blind and ignorant of your arrival, showing grave disrespect.  Please forgive me.”</p><p>“No need for formalities,” Qin Sang said kindly. “I merely wish to ask a few questions.”</p><p>“I will answer truthfully.”</p><p>The green-robed man took a deep breath, but didn’t dare sit.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press. “I plan to travel to the Northern Wastelands. You should have a map of the region, I presume?”</p><p>The green-robed man immediately produced a jade slip, presenting it with both hands. “This map was purchased seventy years ago at the Northern Sky Tower.  The situation in the Northern Wastelands is always chaotic, with frequent shifts in power.  Much of this map is unreliable, but the geographical features should be accurate…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the jade slip with his spiritual sense.  The map meticulously detailed only the eastern part of the Northern Wastelands; vast areas remained blank.  However, it provided Qin Sang with a basic understanding of the Central Plains.</p><p>The Central Plains resembled the Northern Star Territory. The cultivation world consisted of a single continent, unlike the fragmented Three Northern Seas.  The Central Plains, however, was far more extensive than the Northern Star Territory.</p><p>According to the map, the Northern Wastelands were larger than the Three Northern Seas combined. However, most of the area was barren wasteland unsuitable for mortals or even cultivators, and was the poorest and most chaotic region of the Central Plains.</p><p>The wealthiest area of the Central Plains was the nineteen states of the Rain-Kissed South, renowned for its spiritual energy, numerous sects, and the flourishing Buddhist and Daoist traditions.</p><p>Information about the Central Plains was scarce on the jade slip due to the great distance, and very general. However, a few lines prominently mentioned a name Qin Sang had recently heard: Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>Eight characters:  Daoist Sect Origin, True Monarch’s Daoist Grounds!</p><p>True Monarch.  The Central Plains Daoist title for a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“So there is a Nascent Soul True Monarch.  No wonder the Eight Scenic Spots act so arrogantly!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze sharpened, then he was puzzled. “Why didn’t that True Monarch intervene during the hunt?”</p><p>His gaze moved westward, to the area known as the Western Desert, characterized by deserts and barren lands.  Information was even scarcer there, almost non-existent.</p><p>Then there was the eastern region of the continent, referred to as the Eastern Sea by the Central Plains cultivators, containing numerous offshore immortal mountains, inhabited by scattered cultivators and factions. The green-robed cultivator mistakenly believed Qin Sang came from one of these offshore immortal mountains.</p><p>This Eastern Sea was not the same as the Eastern Sea Abyss mentioned by the long-bearded Daoist. The Northern Sea had a limit, while the Eastern Sea was boundless.</p><p>Of course, that was only the understanding of low-level cultivators.  Qin Sang knew the Eastern Sea must also end in a storm belt.</p><p>The Central Plains' vast territory impressed even Xiao Xiangzi. Considering both sea and land, it far surpassed the Northern Sea and the Canglang Sea.</p><p>"Senior possesses immense power, capable of traveling anywhere. Forgive my limited knowledge, I understand little of the powerful figures and factions in the Northern Wastelands, and dare not mislead you. After you arrive, consider visiting the Northern Sky Tower; I can assist you. Also, the Northern Wastelands have Nine Calamities..."</p><p>The green-robed cultivator hastily produced another jade slip. "I haven't traveled extensively in the Northern Wastelands, only experiencing a lightning calamity, a life-threatening disaster for me, though nothing to you, of course. However, multiple calamities can occur simultaneously, increasing the danger exponentially. You should be cautious."</p><p>The green-robed cultivator revealed everything he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang, satisfied with the information, nodded. "I've troubled you."</p><p>Then, he faded from sight, leaving the green-robed cultivator feeling a chill down his spine and breaking into a cold sweat. He remained frozen for a full incense stick before daring to move.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared above the sea and flew south.</p><p>"Elder Xiao Xiangzi mentioned a place in the Northern Wastelands in a jade slip. If it's on the way, I'll check if it's occupied. It could be a good alternative cave abode…"</p><p>Remembering Xiao Xiangzi's account in the jade slip, Qin Sang sped off at lightning speed.</p><p>He made almost no stops until reaching the Northern Wastelands and finding a market town marked on a map. He spent a considerable sum at the North Heaven Tower to acquire a comprehensive geographical map of the Northern Wastelands' mountains and rivers, gaining a much deeper understanding of the region.</p><p>Without difficulty, Qin Sang found his target—the Sky-Splitting Valley.</p><p>A slight detour to reach the valley was acceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang set off.</p><p>Traveling alone, he didn't deliberately conceal his presence, but he also rarely interacted with local powers.  The Northern Wastelands were rife with demonic cultivators and chaos; the large factions were difficult to deal with. Qin Sang prioritized the Buddha Bone Relic and wanted to avoid trouble, so he chose to stay clear of them.</p><p>Danger was relative.  With Qin Sang and his external manifestation—two Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivators—they were a force to be reckoned with anywhere, easily handling even the Nine Calamities of the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>…</p><p>Sky-Splitting Valley.</p><p>This high plateau's ridge had inexplicably split, creating a chasm stretching endlessly. The valley floor was thus named Sky-Splitting.</p><p>Legend in the Northern Wastelands had it that Sky-Splitting Valley was a notorious dangerous place, where the Nine Calamities struck repeatedly, claiming countless cultivators.</p><p>Despite the danger, Northern Wastelands cultivators flocked to it, drawn by the countless rare spirit herbs and unique opportunities found nowhere else.</p><p>At a gap in Sky-Splitting Valley, numerous figures crowded the surrounding peaks, intently watching the thick clouds within the valley, seemingly awaiting something.</p><p>"It's opening!"</p><p>Someone shouted suddenly.</p><p>Cheers erupted from all the peaks.</p><p>The clouds within the valley churned and thinned rapidly.  Where moments before there had been a blank expanse of white, now the valley's vegetation was faintly visible.</p><p>The term "opening" was a colloquialism among cultivators near Sky-Splitting Valley.  During this period of thinning clouds, the frequency of the Nine Calamities greatly reduced, making it the best time to enter. Cultivators judged the timing based on the changing clouds.</p><p>Local cultivators understood the ebb and flow, intimately familiar with the cloud patterns, and never ventured too deep.</p><p>The cloud changes were extremely rapid.</p><p>Before the cheers subsided, they retreated into the depths of Sky-Splitting Valley like a tide, and visibility improved.</p><p>Someone couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>A golden light shot down a mountain peak and vanished into the clouds.</p><p>Instantly, escaping lights flashed from every peak as cultivators rushed into the valley.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang stood on a nearby peak, observing the cultivators entering the valley, and recalled his own days of lower cultivation.</p><p>He held a jade slip containing a brief description of Sky-Splitting Valley. Based on his analysis, Elder Xiao Xiangzi's recorded location should be nearby.</p><p>The jade slip didn't explain why Xiao Xiangzi had visited Sky-Splitting Valley.</p><p>While traveling there, he'd unexpectedly discovered an ancient cultivator's cave abode—an excellent cultivation site.</p><p>At the time, he'd thought it merely abandoned, paying it little mind. Later, he unexpectedly obtained an ancient text in the North Sea, and recalling the cave abode's formations, he found many similarities with the text's descriptions.</p><p>It seemed the depths of the cave held more!</p><p>For Qin Sang, whether treasures existed within was unimportant; the cave abode itself was excellent—spiritually rich, ideally located, and extremely secluded.</p><p>Cultivators streamed into the valley until the outside was empty.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly flew into the valley, casting a spell that prevented the low-level cultivators from noticing him even as he passed by.</p><p>Their senses, like those of the valley's beasts, were similarly obscured.</p><p>Sky-Splitting Valley was perpetually shrouded in mist, yet its interior was lush and breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>Beneath the beauty lurked danger.</p><p>However, the Ruyi Treasure Pearl's protective energy field was sufficient.</p><p>He strolled through the valley, gradually losing sight of others.</p><p>After traveling an unknown distance, he reached the deepest part of Sky-Splitting Valley, a place that filled other cultivators with dread.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He had finally found the geographical marker Xiao Xiangzi described: eight stone peaks arranged in a Bagua formation, with the ancient cultivator's cave abode to the southwest.</p><p>Turning southwest, he sped hundreds of miles before suddenly stopping, his gaze fixed on the scene before him.</p><p>The jade slip described a jade-green lake, with the cave abode hidden at its bottom.</p><p>Now, there was no lake.</p><p>A bottomless pit yawned open, surrounded by crisscrossing ravines. Even after many years, Qin Sang recognized the marks—sword scars!</p><p>Clearly, someone had beaten him to it, destroying the cave abode along with the lake.</p>
