Chapter 316: Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman


If he were still there, he would already be a dead man.
The sword wielder unexpectedly possessed the cultivation base of mid-Foundation Establishment stage!
Precisely because of this, Qin Sang chose to flee towards Yu Daiyue, instead of towards the area with fewer people.
Qin Sang urged his Ebony Sword to fend off the flying swords, narrowly dodging the siege. He saw Yu Daiyue and a young man in black attire flying towards him, both at the early-Foundation Establishment stage.
At this moment, Qin Sang, struck by lightning, was charred black with peeling skin, his face ashen, his breath ragged and weak, clearly heavily injured. But his eyes were unusually bright, fixed on Yu Daiyue.
As if questioningâ€¦
Why?
Yu Daiyue averted his gaze, appearing somewhat reluctant. "Junior Brother Qin, hand over the treasure you obtained in the Heavenly Corpse Cave, and I promise you a swift death!"
Heavenly Corpse Cave?
Besides the Heavenly Corpse Token, what other treasure did I get? I don't even know.
This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but his figure didn't pause in the slightest, as if he hadn't heard Yu Daiyue's words at all.  His hand suddenly rose, palm opening to reveal the Yin-Yang Compass within. The compass pointed directly at them, the Yin-Yang fish in the center spinning rapidly, a faint black light flickering.
Both Yu Daiyue and the black-clad youth were startled. Qin Sang's cultivation was a level higher than theirs. Even heavily injured, they dared not show the slightest negligence.
Otherwise, a cornered beast would still fight desperately. Even if they killed Qin Sang, some of them might be killed by him in the process.
Now that Qin Sang was severely injured by the talisman, they only needed to wear him down slowly, and capturing him was a sure thing. Neither of them wanted to risk their lives. Seeing the black light shoot out from the compass, they both activated their respective magical tools to resist with all their might.
Yu Daiyue held an octagonal bronze mirror, while the black-clad youth's tool was a seven-colored umbrella.
As the black light approached, the young man's expression changed slightly. With a 'Swish', he opened the seven-colored umbrella, shielding himself.
Yu Daiyue hadn't seen Qin Sang's Yin-Yang Compass before and similarly dared not be careless. Light flickered on the precious mirror. He didn't choose to counterattack but, like the black-clad youth, held it in front of him.
The next moment, the black light arrived.
'Bang!'
The black light failed to penetrate the seven-colored umbrella and the octagonal mirror, but the powerful repulsive force it carried was something neither the black-clad youth nor Yu Daiyue had anticipated.
Their figures involuntarily swayed and flew diagonally outwards, creating a slight opening in their tight encirclement.
At the same time, Qin Sang took a sharp breath, a flush rising to his face.  His figure followed the black light, seizing this gap to escape the encirclement.
He seemed to be exerting all his strength, grasping this sliver of a chance to escape, not even having time to retrieve his Ebony Sword.
It seemed that, for the sake of his life, Qin Sang was willing to abandon his natal flying sword.
"Quick! Don't let him escape!"
Yu Daiyue and the black-clad youth hurriedly broke free from the black light and stabilized themselves, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang. They shouted anxiously.
The mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator looked to be forty or fifty years old, with cold eyes and a long, narrow scar on his face. Whether it was intentionally left there or not, it made his face appear exceptionally fierce.
The scarred man's sword strike missed. Before he could reach Qin Sang, he saw him break free.  He couldn't help but frown, snorting coldly and cursing them as useless under his breath.
"Injured by my Thunderclap Talisman, let's see how far you can run!"
The scarred man sneered, recalling his flying sword. Then, he mounted his sword and rose into the air, sword light blazing, pursuing Qin Sang at a speed even faster than his escape technique.
Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang was about to break through Yu Daiyue and the black-clad youth's encirclement, he suddenly stopped.
He turned, facing the scarred man who was in hot pursuit!
Immediately afterwards, a desolate dragon's roar shook the surrounding area.  As six pairs of eyes watched in shock, a dragon soul flew out from Qin Sang's Qi sea, soaring into the sky with a roar.
With the dragon coiling around him, Qin Sang left an afterimage where he stood, his figure flashing forward like lightning, reaching the scarred man at a speed far exceeding the three's imagination.
Over the past three years, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman had been constantly nurtured, the cracks completely disappearing, and the dragon spirit had fully recovered.  Harnessing this talisman, Qin Sang's speed was no slower than Yun Youzi's Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat, possessing an escape speed comparable to the late-Foundation Establishment stage.
With the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, if Qin Sang wanted to escape, they definitely couldn't stop him.
But after breaking through the encirclement, he only had two choices.
One was to admit defeat, escape to safety, and then deal with Yu Daiyue slowly, whether by his own hand or by reporting to his sect.
However, the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman would also be exposed. Even if Yu Daiyue and the others couldn't recognize it on the spot, as long as they made an effort to investigate, they would find clues, leaving him with a fatal hidden danger.
The second option was to do as he did when he counter-attacked Luo Xingnan: first escape, feign exhaustion, and then secretly activate the talisman treasure or the Ten Directions Yama Formation.
But the two situations were completely different!
Last time, he was only at the early-Foundation Establishment stage. Luo Xingnan, relying on his talisman treasure, wasn't afraid of the Jade Ruyi Talisman and was somewhat careless. Moreover, he was alone, and Qin Sang had Shangguan Lifeng as a helper.
This time, the situation was reversed. He was alone, while the opponents were three cultivators at their peak, able to support each other. Once they formed a complete formation, even the Ten Directions Yama Banner might not be able to kill all three.
Moreover, Yu Daiyue knew that he possessed a talisman treasure and would definitely be extremely cautious, not allowing him to easily launch a sneak attack.
Therefore, the moment the situation changed, Qin Sang made his decision. Now, while the three of them were separated, was the best opportunity.
And Qin Sang's first target wasn't Yu Daiyue, nor the black-clad youth, but the only mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.
Because he only had one chance. Once the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman and the Yin-Yang Compass were exposed, it would be difficult for them to achieve the same surprise effect again.
Capture the thief first, capture the king!
As long as this person was killed, the situation could be reversed, and the other two would not be a threat.
Only at this moment did Yu Daiyue and the others realize that Qin Sang's injuries didn't seem to be as serious as they appeared.  When Qin Sang was enveloped by the pillar of light, the three hadn't seen the Corpse Puppet being used as a scapegoat.
The most shocked was the scarred man. He had a bad feeling the moment Qin Sang turned around, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart, but he never expected Qin Sang's speed to be so fast.
In an instant, the scarred man felt a blur before his eyes, and Qin Sang was already rapidly approaching.
The scarred man was in full pursuit. He wanted to stop his escape light and retreat, but it was difficult to do so in such a short time. To make matters worse, Qin Sang flipped the Yin-Yang Compass in his palm.
White light burst forth.
The scarred man felt an immense suction force pulling on him, unable to break free.  Not only could he not stop, but he was pulled even faster towards Qin Sang.
The distance between the two rapidly closed.  Qin Sang's face was right in front of him, his icy gaze seeming to pierce his heart.
In this situation, after a brief moment of panic, the scarred man's expression became even more ferocious.
