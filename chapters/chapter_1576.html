<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang understood the underlying meaning in Fu Han's words.</p><p>Why would the Eight Sceneries Sect and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery risk so much to force their way into the Unrestrained Palace?</p><p>Purple Thunder True Man, the dignified Sect Master, was even injured because of it.</p><p>This not only illustrated the extreme danger of the Unrestrained Palace, but also conveyed to outsiders the urgency with which they sought entry, sparing no cost.</p><p>Combined with the previous rumors, it was difficult not to speculate.</p><p>Could it be that the Nascent Soul cultivators of the two sects were trapped within the Unrestrained Palace, hence their desperation?</p><p>It had been over two hundred years since the rumors of the missing Nascent Soul cultivators began to circulate.</p><p>Real concern arose after the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery's Small Boundless Mountain was infiltrated by a mysterious individual.</p><p>Faced with these rumors, the reactions of the two great Immortal Sects were unusual.</p><p>While it could be argued that Nascent Soul cultivators, being aloof and powerful, would disdain clarifying such rumors, the disciples of the two sects had behaved contrary to their usual manner, becoming increasingly low-key.</p><p>After years of silence, the two sects suddenly mobilized numerous experts, displaying an extraordinary interest in the Unrestrained Palace.</p><p>How could one not be suspicious?</p><p>Situ Yu and Cheng Shenzi, upon returning from the East Sea, immediately summoned the influential figures of Zhuozhou Province for a meeting.  This move was also quite thought-provoking.  Unrestrained Mountain Sect sending Fu Han with the invitation demonstrated the importance they placed on this meeting, and Qin Sang would certainly attend.</p><p>Fu Han lingered briefly, obtained Qin Sang's promise, and then hurried elsewhere.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang departed from Rushan Mountain on time.</p><p>Six Emptiness Mountain was located between Fudù Prefecture and Unrestrained Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to make a detour midway to pass by the Six Emptiness Mountain gate. He naturally wouldn't go to Six Emptiness Mountain to court disaster, but was curious whether Unrestrained Mountain would invite Cheng Huanzi.</p><p>He flew alone for a while.</p><p>Nearing Unrestrained Mountain, Qin Sang noticed a gust of wind blowing from the northwest, heading in the same direction as him. Within the gentle breeze were two people, one of whom was the Long Wind Sect Master he had just met a few days prior.</p><p>“Sect Master Qingfeng!”</p><p>The Long Wind Sect Master also saw Qin Sang and flew closer with his companion.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Cheng Weizi mentioned it, and only then did this humble Daoist realize that it was Sect Master Qingfeng who first detected the devil's plot.  That day, Daoist Master left in a hurry, and I haven’t yet expressed my gratitude.”</p><p>The apparent sorrow had vanished from the Sect Master's face, suggesting he had come to terms with the situation.</p><p>The other person was a young woman, only at the Foundation Establishment stage, a disciple of the Long Wind Sect Master.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed regretfully, “I discovered it too late and couldn't prevent your sect’s losses. Fellow Daoists, did you discover anything or discern the enemy’s origin while pursuing the devil later?”</p><p>“Fate! It is fate!”</p><p>The Long Wind Sect Master sighed deeply.  “We pursued him all the way to Mount Zhaoyao and managed to capture a few minor devils, but they were all bewitched and couldn't reveal anything. After Sect Master Situ returned to the mountain, Fellow Daoist Cheng Weizi reported the matter, describing the divine ability used by that devil. Sect Master Situ, after hearing it, said it only resembled the Dragon Slaying Demonic Force by thirty percent and couldn't be certain it was a descendant of Old Devil Lu.”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, “Recently, there have been more and more devils and evil cultivators stirring up trouble.”</p><p>They slowed down, chatting as they traveled.</p><p>Before long, the three arrived before a mountain only a few thousand feet high, landed on the summit, and saw a stone tablet inscribed with 'White Cloud Waterfall'.</p><p>Learning that this was Unrestrained Mountain, the young woman, who was visiting for the first time, widened her eyes like saucers, unable to hide her disappointment. She had been sent by the Long Wind Sect Master to become an outer disciple of Unrestrained Mountain, intending to cultivate there until the Pseudo Core Formation realm. Before arriving, she had envisioned all sorts of wondrous immortal landscapes.</p><p>The surrounding scenery was quite pleasant, but it was a far cry from the grand sect she had imagined.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Long Wind Sect Master exchanged a knowing smile, activated the restriction on the stone tablet, and soared into the air.</p><p>The young woman was protected by her grandmaster.</p><p>She only felt the wind whistling past her ears as their speed increased dramatically. In the blink of an eye, they flew to a height of tens of thousands of feet. The scene before her eyes flickered from dark to bright, and then she witnessed a breathtaking sight.</p><p>High in the ninth heaven, white clouds cascaded like a waterfall.</p><p>A white jade ribbon flowed down from the heavens.</p><p>The young woman looked down and saw beneath her a sea of clouds, cresting and falling like mountain peaks, stretching endlessly. Yet, looking upwards from below, one would only see the clear blue sky.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Long Wind Sect Master didn't slow down, cleaving through the white clouds, soaring straight to the peak of the cloud waterfall. The scenery in their view changed once again.</p><p>Clouds billowed, and rosy light filled the air.</p><p>Immortal mountains appeared and disappeared within the sea of clouds, residing high in the ninth heaven, detached from the mortal world.</p><p>The young woman was mesmerized.</p><p>Qin Sang, though not visiting Unrestrained Mountain for the first time, still sighed inwardly, "What a magnificent view! It's a pity that such blessed lands are rare even in the Middle Continent, all occupied by super sects. Compared to Unrestrained Mountain, Rushan Mountain is merely a small hill."</p><p>“You both arrived together.”</p><p>Just as they steadied themselves, a figure flashed before them. It was Cheng Weizi.</p><p>The three exchanged greetings.</p><p>Cheng Weizi summoned a disciple to lead the young woman away and personally escorted Qin Sang and the Long Wind Sect Master toward one of the immortal mountains.</p><p>This mountain was where Unrestrained Mountain entertained distinguished guests.</p><p>Nearing the mountain, Cheng Weizi halted their flight. “Sect Master Qingfeng, please wait a moment. The Sect Master has requested your presence at the main peak… I will first escort Fellow Daoist Luo to rest.”</p><p>The Long Wind Sect Master glanced at Qin Sang with surprise but didn’t ask further questions, following Cheng Weizi into the mountain.</p><p>The main peak was located at the center of the sea of clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he followed Cheng Weizi to the main peak, landing beside a waterside pavilion.</p><p>Two meditation cushions were placed within the pavilion.  A man in white robes, with a tall and slender figure, sat cross-legged upon one of them.</p><p>The man was handsome, with sharp features and neatly trimmed sideburns, appearing even younger than Lu Zhang.</p><p>Despite wearing Daoist robes, he exuded an air of scholarly elegance.</p><p>“Reporting to Sect Master, Sect Master Qingfeng has arrived.”</p><p>Cheng Weizi bowed respectfully and withdrew.</p><p>This person was the Sect Master of Unrestrained Mountain—Situ Yu.</p><p>Situ Yu slowly opened his eyes, bright as stars, gestured to the opposite cushion, and spoke in a voice as smooth as jade, “Daoist Master, please be seated.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged opposite Situ Yu without hesitation.</p><p>Situ Yu's eyes were piercing as he looked directly into Qin Sang's eyes and spoke astonishing words, “Should I address you as Sect Master Qingfeng, or Fellow Daoist Qin?”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened slightly, but his tone remained relaxed, “Why do you ask?”</p><p>“With a master like yourself appearing in Zhuozhou, I naturally had to inquire about your origins. However, the people I sent failed to find the Green Ram Island you mentioned in the East Sea. If it were only you, a single mysterious master, that would be one thing. But with both you and your companion being so enigmatic, it inevitably raises suspicions.”</p><p>Situ Yu paused, observing that Qin Sang’s expression hadn’t changed, and continued, “For over a hundred years, you have been relatively peaceful in Rushan Mountain. If you harbor no ulterior motives, I naturally wouldn't interfere. Having another peak master in Zhuozhou isn't necessarily a bad thing. Thirty years ago, Junior Brother Lu was saved by you, proving that my choice was correct.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, “Was it the spiritual treasure that exposed me?”</p><p>Situ Yu nodded, “Although the Vast Sea is far from the Central Plains, the Zhulan Temple has always maintained contact with the Middle Continent. A hundred years ago, they entrusted friendly forces to search for two individuals, a man and a woman. The woman possessed a spiritual treasure which, based on their description, is almost identical to your small seal. The man is not only a peak expert himself but has also mastered the Great Divine Ability of the Second Nascent Soul, possessing an external incarnation with the same cultivation level as his true body.”</p><p>Situ Yu's words were not unexpected by Qin Sang.</p><p>He had stolen the Buddha Bone Sarira from the Zhulan Temple, and they certainly wouldn't let the matter rest.</p><p>Back then, to shake off his pursuers, his Second Nascent Soul had merged into his true body in front of Venerable Chengyuan, which couldn't have escaped their discerning eyes.</p><p>“Are you going to hand me over to the Vast Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang countered.</p><p>His face showed no fear.</p><p>The use of the spiritual treasure was thirty years ago.</p><p>If Situ Yu had intended to harm him, he would have acted long ago, not waiting until now to bring up the matter.</p><p>As expected, Situ Yu gently shook his head, “You exposed your identity to save Junior Brother Lu. How could Unrestrained Mountain be so ungrateful!  I am merely curious, why did you choose Rushan Mountain?”</p><p>This question was very broad.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Situ Yu’s meaning and said indifferently, “If I said I simply wanted to find a peaceful cultivation ground to settle down, would you believe me?”</p><p>Situ Yu's answer surprised Qin Sang, "I could believe it, but at this time, I dare not fully believe it."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his voice deepening, “What did you discover in the Unrestrained Palace?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin is indeed astute!”</p><p>Situ Yu, having confirmed Qin Sang's identity, no longer concealed anything, recounting his encounter in the East Sea, “The entrance to the Unrestrained Palace is a forbidden zone, filled with terrifying spatial turbulence and restriction storms. We suspect that the original mountain gate of the Unrestrained Palace was extraordinary, and its protective formation suffered some calamity. Otherwise, even the fiercest battles couldn't have created such a perilous wasteland. No one, including True Man Purple Thunder, managed to break through that forbidden zone, the only difference being how deep they penetrated. However, while searching for the Unrestrained Palace, I discovered traces of the Demon King and unexpectedly learned something… the demon race's Holy King Palace… has fragmented.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately understood what Situ Yu meant.</p><p>The demon race's Holy King was a Nascent Soul stage great demon.</p><p>If the Holy King were still alive, how could the Holy King Palace fragment?</p><p>The rumors of the disappearances of Holy Sage Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu were widespread.</p><p>However, the prestige of a Nascent Soul cultivator remained.</p><p>Even now, with the Nascent Soul cultivators missing for over two hundred years, various factions still only acted in secret, not daring to act recklessly and directly provoke the Eight Sceneries Sect and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>The various chaotic events in the Central Plains were a gradual manifestation of the Eight Sceneries Sect and Sweet Dew Zen Monastery's inability to dispel the rumors.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the first turmoil arose within the East Sea demon race.</p><p>The fragmentation of the Holy King Palace practically confirmed that something had happened to the demon race’s Holy King.</p><p>Once this news spread throughout the cultivation world, Qin Sang could imagine the chaos that would ensue.</p><p>Situ Yu's meaning was clear.</p><p>In times of peace, Situ Yu had enough confidence to allow Qin Sang to remain in Zhuozhou, believing that even if Qin Sang had any schemes, they wouldn't shake Unrestrained Mountain’s position.</p><p>With chaotic times approaching, even the slightest action could have far-reaching consequences, and even great sects had to tread carefully.</p><p>Throughout history, no sect had enjoyed everlasting prosperity and unbroken lineage. Even the mighty Unrestrained Palace had been reduced to ruins.</p><p>Qin Sang, an outsider of unknown origin, could easily become a source of instability.</p><p>“Do you want me to leave Rushan Mountain?” Qin Sang asked after a moment of contemplation.</p><p>Situ Yu denied it, “Rushan Mountain is your cultivation ground. Since Unrestrained Mountain has acknowledged it, we will not go back on our word.  I invited you here to inform you of something. I have decided that Unrestrained Mountain will close its gates for a hundred years.”</p><p>Close its gates!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Situ Yu to be so decisive.</p><p>Unrestrained Mountain wasn’t like the Xie Family, able to close its gates at will.</p><p>After closing its gates, Unrestrained Mountain would relinquish most of its interests outside the mountain, a loss of immeasurable scale. No wonder they had summoned the various factions of Zhuozhou for a meeting.</p><p>Under Situ Yu’s gaze, Qin Sang responded, “I can assure you that, in the future, whatever I do, it will not implicate Unrestrained Mountain, nor Zhuozhou Province.”</p><p>Situ Yu was satisfied with this answer. He smiled, his tone softening, and changed the subject, “Did you gain anything from refining that Cold Crystal?”</p><p>Thirty years ago, when Fu Han delivered the Cold Crystal, Qin Sang had his external incarnation attempt to refine it.</p><p>Within the Cold Crystal existed a type of chilling煞 energy Qin Sang had never encountered before. This energy was quite potent but didn't quite align with the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>This was because the chilling煞 energy had noticeable fluctuations, making it difficult to conceal, while one of the most important characteristics of the Ice Soul Divine Light was its stealth.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after some time, Qin Sang confirmed that refining the Cold Crystal actually aided the cultivation of the *Ice Soul Divine Light*.</p><p>This surprised him greatly and made him hesitate.</p><p>Even if he could master the Ice Soul Divine Light, it would certainly differ greatly from the original version and wouldn't be like Liuli's, which was formless and invisible when used, striking enemies unknowingly.</p><p>However, the power of the Ice Soul Divine Light should be correspondingly enhanced, and its ability to restrict opponents might be even stronger.</p><p>Since he needed to protect his true body, and the chilling煞 energy within the Cold Crystal wasn't sufficient for him to master the *Ice Soul Divine Light*, Qin Sang had temporarily set the Cold Crystal aside.</p><p>With Situ Yu inquiring about it, Qin Sang took the opportunity to ask, "May I ask, where did this Cold Crystal come from, and are there more?"</p><p>A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.</p><p>The possibility of his incarnation mastering the original *Ice Soul Divine Light* was slim.</p><p>If there were a sufficient number of Cold Crystals, Qin Sang wouldn't mind having his incarnation learn another powerful divine ability.</p><p>“I obtained this item during my travels in the Northern Wilderness, while pursuing a peculiar snow fox with another fellow Daoist, Elder Yanshan.  That snow fox eventually vanished, and we only obtained this single Cold Crystal. After returning to the mountain, I didn't pursue the matter further. However, Fellow Daoist Yanshan's cultivation ground is nearby, and he should know more about it.  I heard from Junior Brother Lu that you possess a divine ability that allows you to easily see through Six Emptiness Mountain. Perhaps you could capture that snow fox. I will write a letter of introduction, and you can take it to visit Fellow Daoist Yanshan…”</p><p>As Situ Yu spoke, he wrote the letter effortlessly.</p><p>Although he had pressed Qin Sang for a promise, he didn't mind extending a small favor and fostering goodwill with him. After all, he hadn’t promised anything concrete, and whether Qin Sang could persuade Elder Yanshan depended on his own abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the letter, expressed his gratitude, and rose to leave the waterside pavilion.</p><p>There was no need to participate in the subsequent discussion. Qin Sang flew directly towards the Unrestrained Mountain gate.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, a figure emerged from the shadows.  It was Cheng Shenzi.</p><p>Situ Yu gazed at Qin Sang's retreating figure and said softly, “Junior Brother Lu is in seclusion refining the Stone Toad. My next Heavenly Tribulation will arrive within a hundred years. Although this tribulation isn’t a life-or-death situation, my chances of overcoming it are less than thirty percent. During this time, I will have to trouble you with the sect’s affairs, Junior Brother.”</p><p>“Senior Brother Sect Master will surely overcome this peril!”</p><p>Cheng Shenzi’s tone was grave as he watched Qin Sang, “This person…”</p><p>“As long as he does nothing to harm Unrestrained Mountain, let him be.”</p><p>Situ Yu rose and walked towards his cave dwelling.</p>
