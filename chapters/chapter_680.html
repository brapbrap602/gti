Chapter 672: Anchor

A seven-colored halo enveloped the surroundings.
The only flaw was that it was too conspicuous, easily noticed by others, and wouldn't achieve the desired surprise effect.
Qin Sang trained the Fat Silkworm, ordering it to manipulate the size and shape of the seven-colored halo. The Fat Silkworm tried countless times, exerting all its strength, and finally managed to shrink the halo by a bit, making it appear slightly more condensed.
“Not bad. Keep practicing, it'd be even better if it could become a protective shield against poison in the future.”
Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction.
The Fat Silkworm, exhausted after being tormented for so long, lay panting on Qin Sang's palm, not daring to complain, doing whatever it was told.
After all, the Nine Nether Demon Fire was floating right above its head.
“Go back and rest, but don't slack off. I'll check your progress next time.”
Qin Sang warned the Fat Silkworm, rewarding it with a sliver of Redfire Liquid Gold.
The Fat Silkworm, initially full of resentment, instantly forgot all its hardships upon seeing the Redfire Liquid Gold. It lapped up the liquid gold, looking at Qin Sang with a fawning expression, as if vowing to work hard.
Compared to the Fat Silkworm, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was absolutely beautiful, a sight that brought joy to the heart.
Nourished by vital blood and various spirit fruits that Qin Sang generously provided, the butterfly's cultivation base was rapidly increasing, and it would be able to undergo its second transformation in a few years.
After playing with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly for a while, Qin Sang routinely checked the restrictive spell on Ya Gu.
Ya Gu lay there like a sleeping beauty, her expression serene and peaceful.
Looking at Ya Gu's state, Qin Sang sighed softly. He naturally hadn't forgotten about breaking the spell.  While at Pingbo Port, he had been trying to learn about the secret arts of the Ghost Path of the Boundless Sea and had collected some, but they were all unremarkable. The true inheritances of those major sects weren't so easily obtained.
He didn't know when he would find a way to awaken Ya Gu.
“Huh?”
Qin Sang stared at Ya Gu and let out a soft exclamation.
He noticed that Ya Gu seemed a bit different from before, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was. Her appearance remained the same, and nourished by the life force of the Three Lights Jade Liquid, her skin was rosy and showed no signs of corpse transformation.
“Could it be?”
A thought struck Qin Sang, and he took out the Fat Silkworm.  He indeed discovered something.
Sensing its master's aura, the originally listless Fat Silkworm suddenly perked up. It jumped onto Ya Gu's palm, snuggled up against her fingertip like a kitten, and chirped softly, showing great affection and attachment to Ya Gu.
This affection for Ya Gu came from the Fat Silkworm's heart, without any ulterior motives.
It was distinctly different from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, which Qin Sang had forcibly subdued.
Qin Sang noticed that after the Fat Silkworm's transformation, there was an inexplicable connection between Ya Gu's primordial spirit and the silkworm.  Perhaps it had existed before, but it was too subtle for Qin Sang to detect.
It was this connection that gave Ya Gu's primordial spirit a trace of vitality, as if the Fat Silkworm had become an anchor for Ya Gu in the real world, allowing her to grasp a glimmer of hope in the endless darkness.
Although this vitality was insignificant, it appeared so clear and precious in the midst of deathly silence.
Discovering this, Qin Sang was overjoyed.
With the Three Lights Jade Liquid, there was no need to worry about Ya Gu's physical body being damaged. Qin Sang's constant worry was that if he couldn't awaken Ya Gu in time, her consciousness would completely sink.
Now, with the Fat Silkworm as an anchor and the Warm Jade for protection, Ya Gu could hold on for a longer period.  It was conceivable that the higher the Fat Silkworm's cultivation, the clearer this connection would become, and the longer Ya Gu could persist.
“It seems that while finding a way to awaken Ya Gu, I also need to help the Fat Silkworm transform as quickly as possible, making preparations on both fronts.”
Qin Sang muttered to himself as he looked at the Fat Silkworm and Ya Gu.
Seeing that the Fat Silkworm was beneficial to Ya Gu, Qin Sang's attitude towards it softened considerably.
…
The night passed uneventfully.
The next morning, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, opened the curtains, and gazed towards the southeast.
A fine rain was falling, and he could already see in the distance the silhouette of a lone peak amidst the rain, standing tall against the sky, like a pillar supporting the heavens!
This was Mount Wushen, standing out among the mountain range, exuding an air of supremacy. No wonder it was regarded as a sacred mountain by the Wu Clan.
The tallest and most majestic mountain peak Qin Sang had ever seen was Mount Heaven in the Violet Firmament Palace.
Mount Wushen was no less impressive than Mount Heaven, perhaps even more so.
Mount Heaven was shrouded in countless terrifying immortal restrictions, giving it an air of mystery and antiquity.
While Mount Wushen, revered as a sacred mountain by a whole clan, was surrounded by various myths and legends.  One legend said that this mountain reached the heavens above and connected to the netherworld below, that it had once been the residence of the Wu God, and was the place where the Wu God manifested.
Qin Sang's gaze pierced through the rain, fixated on the sky above Mount Wushen.
The summit of Mount Wushen was shrouded in dark clouds, with lightning dancing and silver snakes darting about. Terrifying thunderbolts flashed constantly, creating a fearsome scene of heavenly punishment.
It was a sight that compelled awe and submission.
It was important to note that this celestial phenomenon wasn't due to the rainy weather that day.
Even when the sun shone brightly around it, the dark clouds above Mount Wushen remained, and the lightning never ceased, persisting for who knew how many years.
It was said that this celestial phenomenon had existed since the earliest records of Mount Wushen, a truly wondrous thing.
“This Mount Wushen is extraordinary. The Boundless Sea also has many mysterious places no less impressive than the Violet Firmament Palace, such as the Seven Kills Palace and Mount Wushen. Who knows how many similar places there are…”
Qin Sang marveled.
He had witnessed the immortal traces in the Violet Firmament Palace and hadn't felt much shock. Others, however, were different.  The human cultivators who came to Mount Wushen for the first time all had a hint of unconcealed fear in their eyes.
“Daoist Qing Feng is also awake?  Just in time to join us. Let's go ahead and fly to Mount Wushen.”
Qin Sang, engrossed in his observation, heard Ran Luo's voice transmission. He glanced sideways and saw Ran Luo, Ning Kun, and others had gotten off the beast carriage at some point and were flying towards him together.
“Aren't we waiting for the caravan?”
Delays could lead to unforeseen circumstances.  Qin Sang was eager to enter the Demon Sea as soon as possible.  Hearing this, he didn't hesitate. He immediately retrieved the array tools set up on the carriage and flew out.
“We've just confirmed that everything is normal at Mount Wushen.  Many fellow Daoists are restless and have decided to set off immediately.  The caravan will send people to bring the carriages along slowly.  We're very close to Mount Wushen now.  No one dares to cause trouble here.”
Ran Luo explained briefly, nodded to Qin Sang, and continued flying forward to make arrangements.
Qin Sang looked around. The high-level cultivators, who had been elusive throughout the journey, now appeared one after another, flying towards Mount Wushen in twos and threes.  These people belonged to different factions, but without exception, they were worried about the situation in the Wu God Continent, which was why they had left Pingbo Port together.
Among these people, Qin Sang only knew Ning Kun and Hui Wen. After some thought, he joined them, slowing down to wait for Ran Luo.
Soon, Ran Luo caught up from behind.  Accompanying her were a man and a woman.  The man was a graceful middle-aged man, none other than Elder Zou, the chief steward of the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce.
Unexpectedly, Elder Zou was so young.
Qin Sang didn't sense the pressure of a Nascent Soul ancestor from Elder Zou. He should be at the late stage of Core Formation.
