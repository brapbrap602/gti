Chapter 579: Ambush


“I’ve left a concealed restriction at the entrance, and it’s been triggered.”
Yun Youzi said softly.
“妖修 (Yao Xiu) aren’t like human cultivators.  Below the Transformation stage, they need Emperor’s Flowing Liquid to fully awaken their intelligence.
“In Tian Yao Qiu, the Emperor’s Flowing Liquid is controlled by the demon king, so those Yao Dan stage妖修 (Yao Xiu) with awakened intelligence are basically under the demon king’s command.  Unlike cultivators, there are rarely any loose cultivators at the Golden Core stage.
“This妖修 (Yao Xiu) is likely a close confidant of the demon king, who followed him into the inner hall, which is why he arrived so quickly.
“The Zu Yuan attack had a huge impact. The Three Realms are about to be thrown into chaos, and Tian Yao Qiu can no longer stay out of it. Those demon kings probably want to get to Tian Shan Mountain early to acquire more treasures, so they didn't linger in the outer hall…”
The Zu Yuan ambush was an opportunity for them, but it also introduced uncertainty.


Qin Sang looked up at the cliff top, his gaze turning cold. He reached for the Xu Tian Lei from his iron plate, but Yun Youzi stopped him.
Yun Youzi shook his head gently and said in a low voice, “We don't know this妖修’s (Yao Xiu’s) strength yet, nor how many there are. This isn't the place to fight. I need to leave a mark first, ascertain his cultivation, and then decide.”
With that, Yun Youzi looked around, then suddenly jumped into the dark pool.
The water in the pool parted automatically. Yun Youzi moved very carefully, preventing any trace of his presence from remaining.
They had been doing this all along, meticulously erasing any trace of their passage to avoid detection by any following妖修 (Yao Xiu).
Yun Youzi stayed in the pool for a while before emerging, leaving behind an unknown mechanism.
“Break the restriction!”
Yun Youzi said, “We can’t delay. We need to proceed as quickly as possible. If this妖修 (Yao Xiu) is highly cultivated, it’s uncertain how effective the Xu Tian Lei and Flying Night Rakshasa will be. The Xu Tian Lei has too small a range, and the Flying Night Rakshasa is limited in strength. We might need to leverage the ancient restrictions to drive him away.”
Qin Sang knew Yun Youzi was right. While his techniques could threaten a Yao Dan stage妖修 (Yao Xiu), they had significant limitations and needed careful planning to be effective.
His understanding of the ancient medicine garden and its restrictions was far less than Yun Youzi’s, so he followed Yun Youzi's instructions implicitly.  The Flying Night Rakshasa opened a passage, and Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, without hesitation, leaped through.


Ancient restrictions blocked their path ahead, and pursuers were behind.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi moved faster than before, not daring to rest, breaking through layer after layer of ancient restrictions at top speed, delving deeper into the ancient medicine garden.
They continued straight towards the Jiang Yun Zi Guo, without detouring or evasion.
Besides the unknown dangers in other restricted areas, the Jiang Yun Zi Guo was unique; avoiding it would be tantamount to giving it away.
After breaking through four layers of ancient restrictions, they arrived at a hillside covered in wildflowers.
Yun Youzi stopped, suddenly smiled slightly, and said with a relaxed expression, “It’s a golden eagle妖兽 (Yao Shou), I remember its cultivation is only at the early Yao Dan stage, and it's injured.  It's nothing to worry about!”
Qin Sang didn't relax, quickly asking, “Only one golden eagle妖兽 (Yao Shou)?”
“That’s right,” Yun Youzi nodded, “The Zu Yuan attack was chaotic, and Qin Lao Di wasn’t in the formation, so you certainly didn’t notice. When Zu Yuan retreated, he shattered a corner of the Xiao Bei Chen Star Yuan Formation, which happened to be where the Tian Yao Qiu妖修 (Yao Xiu) were located. The妖修 (Yao Xiu) suffered heavy casualties, and the survivors are all injured. I remember this golden eagle妖兽 (Yao Shou), its cultivation is limited; we don’t even need your Xu Tian Lei. We can easily trap it with the ancient restrictions.”
Immediately, the two conferred briefly and continued onward.
…
The ancient medicine garden was vast, containing many large spaces sealed off by ancient restrictions.
Mountains rose and fell, the vegetation lush and green.
A scene of vibrant life.
Suddenly, a clear eagle cry echoed through the air, followed by a flash of golden lightning.
The golden lightning zipped across several mountain peaks, and in an instant landed on a protruding rock, revealing its true form – a golden eagle!
The golden eagle folded its wings, magnificent and imposing, its eyes sharp and fierce, its feathers shimmering with gold, as if coated in a layer of gilding. Unlike typical golden eagles, it wasn’t gigantic; the wingspan of an adult golden eagle could reach dozens of feet.
Its outstretched wings were roughly the size of a human.
However, this golden eagle’s aura was extremely powerful, its eyes unusually bright, gleaming with an intelligence not seen in ordinary妖兽 (Yao Shou).
It stood on the rock, gazing at the ravine ahead.
After a moment, a strange look appeared in the golden eagle's eyes, and it opened its beak, releasing a bolt of lightning.
The roar of thunder echoed through the mountains.


A bolt of lightning, imbued with the golden eagle's powerful magic, struck with terrifying speed and force.

However, as it reached the ravine above, it encountered resistance.

*Boom!*

A Bagua (eight-trigrams) symbol materialized amidst the thunderous noise, a clear manifestation of ancient protective magic.  The golden lightning struck the symbol's center, yet even as it dissipated, it failed to break through.

Suddenly, a dramatic shift occurred!

The Bagua symbol spun rapidly.  A point of golden light flared at its center, then shot out an identical lightning bolt, striking the golden eagle. The ancient protection had returned the lightning bolt, doubled in power!

A flicker of contempt crossed the golden eagle's eyes. With a flap of its wings, it shattered the bolt. Then, shaking its body, countless feathers launched forth like deadly arrows, engulfing the Bagua symbol in a shower of gold.

A *crack* echoed as a hairline fracture appeared in the symbol. A point of golden light seized the opportunity to pierce through.

The pressure within the fissure of the Bagua symbol was immense. The golden eagle, its bones aching from the strain, endured the pressure, forcing its way through.

But as it emerged on the other side, a white light descended from the heavens.  The light seemed gentle, lacking any threatening aura. Yet, the golden eagle sensed a chilling presence within it.

Still partially trapped within the ancient protection, the eagle was ambushed.  With a startled cry, it reacted instantly, unleashing a lightning bolt while its body seemed to unlock some seal, expanding dramatically.

Its bones groaned under the strain. As its size increased, an old wound on its left wing reopened, spurting blood. The stench of blood filled the air.  This injury, sustained when the Xia Bei Chen Xing Yuan Formation shattered, had nearly killed him.  Even powerful elixirs couldn't fully heal it, requiring the intervention of the Demon King. Now, the old injury was worsening.

The golden eagle shrieked in fury. Ignoring the pain, it spread its wings, using brute strength to tear a larger opening in the protective magic.  In an instant, it was free.
