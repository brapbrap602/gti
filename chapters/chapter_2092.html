<h1>Chapter 2083: Constructing the Altar</h1><p>The mountain wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>Li Yufu softly recounted the proceedings of the three races' council.</p><p>Qin Sang listened, his expression calm.  While the situation might unfold with unforeseen twists, it wouldn't deviate too far from his predictions.</p><p>No matter what schemes or tricks they employed, they couldn't stem the tide of destiny.</p><p>He *was* this 'destiny'!</p><p>Because of his overwhelming strength, he could manipulate destiny, crushing all obstacles with a torrential flood. Yet, the human heart was unpredictable, a realm of subtle and profound mysteries.</p><p>High-ranking cultivators lived for hundreds, even thousands of years. Even if most of their time was spent cultivating in seclusion, away from worldly affairs, as long as they lived long enough, what schemes and intrigues hadn't they witnessed? Sometimes, it wasn't that they were unwilling to resort to such tactics, but that they simply didn't need to.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, ultimate power resided within oneself. Overwhelming might was the simplest form of authority, demanding only obedience from others.  Slaughter enough, and opposition naturally ceased.</p><p>But the Great Way of Completion prioritized the human heart. Qin Sang desired a dao field devoted to him from within, not one riddled with dissent.</p><p>Of course, the human heart could also be manipulated. The game was already afoot; he merely needed to wait for those ghosts and goblins to reveal themselves.</p><p>"As expected, Jiao Long Wang was the first to jump out.  Long Jing Sheng Wang chimed in with a few words, but it's still unclear whether he has allied with the Demon Sea. Fang Laomo remained silent. The Three Sects Alliance's stance is the most intriguing..."</p><p>Li Yufu commented.</p><p>With Qin Sang's backing, he felt confident, yet he had to maintain a facade of worry outside, a tiring charade.</p><p>Qin Sang simply hummed in response, unconcerned, then inquired about other matters, which Li Yufu answered one by one.</p><p>Seeing that the Azure Ram Temple was fully prepared, Qin Sang declared, "Seal the mountain!"</p><p>"This disciple obeys!"</p><p>Li Yufu bowed and retreated.</p><p>Moments later, the sound of bells and chimes echoed from the mountain gate, as clouds and mist billowed around the Azure Ram Temple.</p><p>During this period, the Azure Ram Temple had constructed several grand formations around the mountain gate, capable of protecting the sect.</p><p>Qin Niansui and his wife were waiting for a summons in front of the main hall. Hearing the bells and chimes, they were startled. Activating their spirit vision, they discovered that the sect was truly sealing the mountain.</p><p>During the council, Li Yufu had displayed unprecedented firmness. Now it seemed he truly intended to forge his own path, isolating the sect from external disturbances.</p><p>"Husband, please remain calm."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter, Bai Zhixin, sensing her husband's anxiety, held his arm and gently comforted him.</p><p>After a long wait, a deacon finally returned, his steps hurried.  Reaching the couple, he presented a token held in both hands – it was Li Yufu's Temple Master Seal.</p><p>The presence of the Temple Master Seal was equivalent to the Temple Master himself.</p><p>Qin Niansui and his wife hurriedly bowed as the deacon offered them an apologetic smile, then solemnly declared, "Qin Niansui, Bai Zhixin, you are hereby ordered to return to the North Sea immediately and safeguard the ancestral grounds. There must be no mistakes! If the ancestral grounds are lost, you will be held accountable."</p><p>The couple were shocked, never expecting to be sent back to the North Sea without even seeing their master.</p><p>"Where is Senior Martial Uncle Shen now?"</p><p>Qin Niansui inquired.</p><p>He and Bai Zhixin had taken Bai Hanqiu as their master after they became Dao companions. Shen Chen had joined the sect later, so he addressed Bai Hanqiu as Senior Martial Sister.</p><p>"Ancestor Shen is currently in secluded cultivation, refining artifacts. He has given strict instructions that no one, aside from the Temple Master, is to disturb him," the deacon replied respectfully, then added, "Holy Monarch Yu Nu and Ancestor Huanhen are both assisting Ancestor Shen in refining."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Niansui regained his composure. The Nascent Soul cultivators within the sect had clearly reached a consensus. While the Temple Master might misjudge the situation, it was impossible for all four Nascent Soul cultivators to be mistaken. There must be a compelling reason for this course of action.</p><p>"This disciple obeys. We shall return to the North Sea at once!"</p><p>Qin Niansui and his wife bowed again towards the main hall and departed on a cloud.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had left the main peak and arrived at a nearby valley.</p><p>It was a valley encircled by three mountains, with a flat expanse of land within. From the outside, it appeared as a mist-shrouded lake, a forbidden area that even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't enter.</p><p>Qin Sang landed in the center of the valley, sensing the flow of the surrounding spirit veins. After a moment, he sat down cross-legged and slowly channeled his True Essence, manipulating the spirit veins to arrange them according to his design.</p><p>The Azure Ram Temple had already refined the spirit veins, so Qin Sang only needed to make minor adjustments. The disturbance wouldn't be significant, and he could easily conceal it.</p><p>The changes were occurring right beside them, yet the disciples of the Azure Ram Temple remained completely unaware.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's continuous manipulation, the spiritual energy of this place gradually shifted in his desired direction.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang's plan had changed repeatedly with his experiences.</p><p>Previously, as the sole Soul Formation cultivator, he had to personally preside over the main altar.  Therefore, he planned to divide the branch altars into regions, each centered around a branch altar, and entrust them to the Nascent Soul cultivators.  Ultimately, the power of all the altars would converge upon him.</p><p>With his encounters with Su Nu and Si Lu, and now Zhu Que's potential to break through to Soul Formation, if he could gain the support of three Soul Formation cultivators, such meticulous division would be unnecessary.</p><p>The main altar would remain in the Central Continent, with three core branch altars established in the North Sea, Western Lands, and Demon Sea (Cang Lang Sea), each presided over by one of the three cultivators.  Then, the three Soul Formation cultivators would share the burden, not only increasing the power but also accelerating the activation speed.</p><p>Of course, the main altar remained the foundation of everything. Without a stable main altar, all other plans were futile.</p><p>Days and nights passed.</p><p>An unknown amount of time later, the spiritual energy surrounding the Azure Ram Temple subtly transformed, and the spirit veins finally met Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his True Essence and calmly awoke.  Just then, a streak of light flew into the valley – it was Shen Chen.</p><p>"Master, you summoned me?"</p><p>Qin Sang had called Shen Chen because he was about to begin constructing the altar.  This process shared similarities with artifact refinement, and Shen Chen's careful observation would undoubtedly provide him with valuable insights.</p><p>"How is your comprehension of the scriptures I gave you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Shen Chen's expression was filled with excitement. "Disciple only now understands the profound mysteries of the Dao of Artifact Refinement. While I dare not claim to have made leaps and bounds in progress during this period, I certainly feel much more at ease when refining formation flags. However, I still have many doubts and uncertainties, and I wish to seek Master's guidance."</p><p>Following this, master and disciple engaged in a question-and-answer session, with Qin Sang resolving Shen Chen's doubts. He never ceased his work, as Azure Mark Essence and other spiritual materials flew out one by one.</p><p>These precious spiritual materials radiated brilliant light.  Most of them were unfamiliar to Shen Chen, dazzling him.</p><p>Hearing Shen Chen's questions, Qin Sang nodded inwardly. The scriptures contained the insights of Grandmaster Qi and Grandmaster Gu into artifact refinement.  To comprehend so much in such a short time was a testament to Shen Chen's talent.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang tossed Shen Chen a jade slip.</p><p>Shen Chen glanced at it and immediately became engrossed.  The jade slip contained the *Chong Xuan Ce*!</p><p>Ignoring him, Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, drawing the Azure Mark Essence before him.  A series of hand seals followed, causing the essence's color to gradually deepen, then spontaneously divide, finally transforming into countless blue specks suspended in the air.</p><p>With the refinement complete, Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards, and all the specks sank into the ground.</p><p>The tremors startled Shen Chen, who reluctantly put away the jade slip and focused on observing his master constructing the altar.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's precise control, the Azure Mark Essence dispersed underground, 'drifting' towards the surrounding spirit veins. Every important spirit vein received its share of the essence, the specks merging with the veins, as if freezing them.</p><p>This was to stabilize the spirit veins, preventing excessive fluctuations during the altar's construction that might cause damage. This step was essential for constructing any type of altar.</p><p>Although it seemed simple, it was incredibly demanding, with no room for error.  Knowing that haste would only lead to mistakes, Qin Sang proceeded methodically, occasionally offering Shen Chen a few explanations.</p><p>Master and disciple remained in the valley, oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p>After the Azure Mark Essence was fully deployed, Qin Sang retrieved Golden Peak Jade, dividing it into pieces and meticulously sculpting them.  Simultaneously, he scattered Gold-Veined Grass seeds, which could be directly nourished with True Essence.</p><p>The Gold-Veined Grass seeds sprouted and grew, their forms incredibly peculiar. The leaves shimmered with silver light, resembling lightning bolts, branching profusely.  Countless Gold-Veined Grass plants were planted in a single area, their leaves intertwining to form a network of lightning.</p><p>The Gold-Veined Grass would wither after reaching a certain stage of growth.  Because it was forcefully cultivated, it wouldn't produce new seeds.  After withering, the plants would transform into a unique form of thunderous energy that would never dissipate unless disrupted. This would serve as the 'energy channels' for the altar.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang retrieved the Thousand-Feathered Silk, carefully refined it, and meticulously wove it into the 'lightning bolts'.</p><p>Shen Chen watched in awe as the altar gradually took shape under Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>One day, noticing that Qin Sang seemed to have a moment of leisure, Shen Chen hurriedly presented an item. "Master, during my travels in the North Star Realm, I obtained this piece of Bloodless Blood Mulberry.  I initially intended to refine it into a magical treasure, but I felt that such a spiritual wood wasn't so simple. Using it merely to taint others' treasures seemed like a waste of its potential, so I hesitated to make a decision."</p><p>"Oh? There are still scattered Bloodless Blood Mulberry trees in the North Star Realm?"</p><p>After the Ziwei Palace ascended, Qin Sang had searched for it without success, assuming it had all been squandered by Old Devil Ye.</p><p>"Your intuition is correct. This type of spiritual wood has other uses. Keep it for now," Qin Sang mused. "By always staying by my side, your perspective has become too narrow. After we finish here, I will take you to the Eight Great Celestial Continents and have you join a certain faction. It is a sacred ground for artifact refiners."</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance would be the perfect fit for Shen Chen's pursuit of the Dao of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang had always been intrigued by the secret technique of deceiving artifact spirits using Bloodless Blood Mulberry, but the Cloud Roaming Sword couldn't be exposed to the light.  With a fragment of the spiritual tree in his possession, if Shen Chen played his cards right, he might be able to obtain this secret technique.</p><p>Overjoyed, Shen Chen carefully stored the Bloodless Blood Mulberry and continued to observe Qin Sang constructing the altar.</p><p>...</p><p>Beyond the Western Desolation.</p><p>Behind the Changyou Clan's vast army, a tranquil island offered picturesque scenery, starkly contrasting with its surroundings. Patrolling soldiers and generals detoured hundreds of miles around it.</p><p>Suddenly, a white wave surged into this area, heading straight for the island.  It abruptly halted before the island, revealing a fully armored Changyou soldier who knelt on the surface of the sea.</p><p>"Reporting to General, a secret message has arrived!"</p><p>Ripples spread through the void as the talisman in the soldier's hand flew towards a palace on the island, landing in the grasp of a Changyou clansman.</p><p>This individual was tall and robust, with short, neat hair and a resolute face. His thick eyebrows resembled sharp swords, and his eyes radiated sharpness.  Even seated, his back remained ramrod straight.</p><p>This man was named Min Shan, a High General whose status within the clan was second only to the Clan Leader and the clan elders. Currently, he commanded several armies, threatening the Storm Realm.</p><p>Opening the secret message, he found no words, only a jet-black ink dot that writhed like a living creature, forming distorted lines.</p><p>His eyes flickered, his brow furrowed slightly. He crushed the message in his palms, tapping his fingers on the table as if in deep thought.</p><p>In the next instant, a mass of water coalesced beneath the sea outside the island.  It quickly merged with the ocean currents, drifting through the sea until it reached a vast expanse of open water.</p><p>The mass of water condensed once more, rising to the surface, now transformed into a human figure, identical in appearance to Min Shan.</p><p>He looked at the calm sea and said softly, "Come out."</p><p>After a moment, a wisp of black qi slowly ascended from the seabed.  It twisted and contorted, morphing into a shadowy figure with indistinct features.</p><p>"What matter is so important that it warrants..."</p><p>Min Shan began to ask, but his gaze suddenly turned icy as he barked, "You are not Ci Hun!"</p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p>The black figure emitted a sinister chuckle. "As expected of the High General, so cautious as to send only an avatar to this meeting. I have long admired the High General's reputation, and finally, I have the honor of meeting you."</p><p>Years of continuous warfare had led the Changyou Clan to recruit informants within the Storm Realm.  Ci Hun was one of the deepest embedded, communicating exclusively with Min Shan.  Unexpectedly, he had been exposed.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Min Shan narrowed his eyes, a dangerous glint flashing within them.  Since the other party had discovered Ci Hun's identity, instead of using the opportunity to spread false information, they chose to show off, was this meant as an insult?</p><p>"There is no need for the High General to know my identity. You simply need to know that I, like this Ci Hun fellow, am also sympathetic to the Changyou Clan. I have luckily obtained some crucial information, but I cannot trust anyone else, nor can I reach the High General directly.  Thus, I resorted to this drastic measure.  I wonder if the High General is interested..."</p><p>The black figure's voice was ethereal, its form flickering as if wary of Min Shan's reaction.</p><p>How could one refuse someone offering their allegiance?</p><p>Although Min Shan found this individual's origins suspicious, he might as well listen.  He asked, "What information?"</p><p>"I possess a great deal of information, such as the weaknesses in the North Sea's defenses," the black figure replied calmly.</p><p>Min Shan stared at the black figure. "How can I be certain that your information is genuine?"</p><p>The black figure smiled. "I am taking a considerable risk; this is not meant to be a one-time transaction.  The High General can verify the authenticity of the information. Proceed gradually, and you will slowly come to appreciate my sincerity... Why not start with this one?"</p><p>The Changyou Clan had been constantly attempting to recruit insiders, but with limited success.  This individual seemed to possess intimate knowledge of the North Sea's defenses, suggesting a position of considerable influence.</p><p>Such a person would only betray their own side if they had suffered injustice or harbored grudges.</p><p>"Why are you offering your allegiance to my clan?"  Min Shan asked bluntly, suspecting a possible conspiracy against him.</p><p>"No! No! No!"</p><p>The black figure shook its head repeatedly. "I am not offering allegiance, but rather cooperation. This information is not free!"</p><p>The world bustled with activity, all driven by profit.</p><p>Min Shan was unsurprised. "What do you want?"</p><p>"Naturally, treasures commensurate with the value of the information.  I believe the Changyou Clan possesses ample resources to satisfy my appetite. Of course, what I desire most is Azure Spiritual Qi!"  A hint of urgency entered the black figure's voice.</p><p>"Azure Spiritual Qi?"</p><p>Min Shan sneered. "If you can help me conquer the North Sea or the Central Continent, you may take as much Azure Spiritual Qi as you please!"</p><p>The black figure bowed deeply. "I will certainly not disappoint the High General!" (End of Chapter)</p>
