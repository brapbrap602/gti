<h1>Chapter 1404: Strange Phenomenon</h1><p>Qi and Wang, having nothing to do, stood guard to the side.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed close to the altar, using her spiritual sense to soothe the Fire Jade Centipede, while observing Master Mu's actions.</p><p>Master Mu sat cross-legged on the altar, raising his hands to form a strange hand seal, remaining motionless.</p><p>At the same time, his lips moved slightly, emitting a series of unintelligible syllables.</p><p>As the secret technique progressed,</p><p>the altar emitted a green light from within.</p><p>The green light did not diffuse outwards, but gathered on the surface of the altar, surging upwards like flowing water.</p><p>Gradually, Master Mu and the three spirit insects were all bathed in the green light, their figures almost invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede felt instinctively uneasy, its legs moving slightly.</p><p>At that moment, the altar shook violently.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The green light suddenly retracted, condensing above the altar into a ring-like pattern filled with dense, strange runes.</p><p>The three spirit insects were positioned at the three apexes, enveloped in a cocoon of green light, and involuntarily rotated with the pattern.</p><p>Not only the Fire Jade Centipede, but the other two spirit insects also began to feel uneasy.</p><p>After receiving their master's reassurance, they quickly calmed down, and the insect formation was successfully formed!</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Master Mu roared out a strange incantation.</p><p>The Tidal Crab and the Black Magic Ant showed the first signs of change; their inner power was drawn out by the insect formation, slowly flowing into the Fire Jade Centipede along the shifting formation.</p><p>In an instant, the Fire Jade Centipede's body tensed into a straight line.</p><p>Its legs were tightly closed.</p><p>Flames erupted from its body, violently swaying.</p><p>This was only the beginning.</p><p>As the insect formation continued,</p><p>the Black Magic Ant began to weaken, and the Tidal Crab's aura also faded.</p><p>On the other hand, the Fire Jade Centipede's aura grew stronger.</p><p>Although it was a unique insect with potential far exceeding other spirit insects, its cultivation was lower than the other two, and even a whole realm lower than the Tidal Crab. It soon exceeded its own limits.</p><p>The external power was forcibly infused into its body.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede curled up tightly, trembling in pain.</p><p>Qin Sang anxiously monitored the Fire Jade Centipede's changes, ready to stop Master Mu from acting recklessly to prevent irreversible damage or even causing the Fire Jade Centipede to suffer the same fate as the Jade-biting Bee.</p><p>As long as its injuries didn't exceed the limit, there would be plenty of time to help it recover later.</p><p>Qi and Wang, observing from the periphery, also showed anxious expressions.</p><p>Master Mu's control over the insect formation was exquisite.</p><p>The power within the insect formation was extremely gentle, minimizing harm to the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>As time passed,</p><p>the Fire Jade Centipede's aura grew stronger, soon surpassing that of the Black Magic Ant.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Qin Sang, staring intently at the Fire Jade Centipede, suddenly shouted to stop.</p><p>Master Mu's eyelids flickered, complying immediately. He stopped, opened his eyes, glanced at the Fire Jade Centipede, and nodded lightly, “It was just short of the limit, but this is enough; infinitely close to the fourth transformation. If this isn't enough, even continuing the infusion would be useless… Let's try!”</p><p>Qin Sang activated her spiritual sense.</p><p>Under the intense pain, the Fire Jade Centipede's poor consciousness became very confused. Qin Sang spent a great deal of effort to barely perceive its consciousness and tried her best to soothe it.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's curled body gradually unfurled.</p><p>The four of them stared intently at the Fire Jade Centipede, secretly anticipating.</p><p>After a few breaths,</p><p>the Fire Jade Centipede's upper body suddenly swayed slightly, probing forward slightly. The movement was small, but it couldn't escape the eyes of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Master Mu's pupils constricted, and he quickly looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>But Qin Sang's face was grave. After a moment, she suddenly shifted her gaze from the Fire Jade Centipede to the nearby formation, pointing with her hand, "There!"</p><p>Joy surged through everyone's hearts.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had actually sensed the entrance to the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if it was the effect of the Myriad Spirit Fruit, but she was certain that there was something within that attracted the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The consciousness transmitted by the Fire Jade Centipede was brief, but its direction was very clear.</p><p>It wasn't in the exact center of the formation, but slightly to the right of the center.</p><p>The Qi cultivator, already prepared, acted without hesitation, his figure flickering as he immediately dashed towards the location Qin Sang indicated.  Unexpectedly, before he could get close, history repeated itself, and the formation shifted him to another side.</p><p>They had anticipated this and were not discouraged.</p><p>Qi and Wang used their various abilities, trying repeatedly, but all to no avail, their brows furrowing.</p><p>They summoned their respective magic treasures, launching full-power attacks at the entrance, like stones sinking into the sea.</p><p>The formation didn't shift the attacks away, but it didn't react at all.</p><p>Mu Guzhu maintained the insect formation, observing for a moment before saying, "It seems impossible to approach the entrance through the formation. We must attack directly! The lack of any strange phenomena suggests our previous attempts lacked sufficient power."</p><p>Before he finished, Qin Sang interrupted, "The location has shifted! There!"</p><p>The three of them visibly paled.</p><p>"The Jing Hai Sect entrance can move within the formation itself! That explains our fruitless attempts.  Ordinary attacks are useless; we must combine our efforts and strike a single point simultaneously!"  the female cultivator, surnamed Wang, said gravely.</p><p>Mu Guzhu nodded.  "Prepare the formation!"</p><p>Qi and Wang returned to the altar.  With practiced ease, they tapped their pouches, and numerous blue banners streamed forth like flowing water.  Their figures flickered as they worked swiftly.</p><p>In short order, a complex banner formation materialized around them.  Standing within, they formed hand seals to activate it.  Unhindered by the water, the underwater formation's banners rippled.  Pure water elemental energy continuously coalesced at the formation's center.</p><p>As the two Yuan Ying cultivators poured their power into the formation, the seawater churned. A sphere of ice-like transparency gradually formed, undergoing a dazzling transformation before solidifying into a seven-foot-long, transparent water sword!  The sword pointed towards the formation, poised to strike.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mu Guzhu produced a serpent spear.  Its tip glowed with a bright blue light, incredibly sharp. Initially only arm-length, Mu Guzhu flicked his finger, and the spear shot upwards, expanding dramatically, its point likewise directed at the formation.</p><p>"Daoist?" Qi, the male cultivator, called out.</p><p>All three looked to Qin Sang.  The entrance's location had shifted several times in the interim.  Based on the fire centipede's feedback, they'd deduced a pattern – roughly a three-breath interval between shifts – but the new locations were entirely random.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, a thought flickering through her mind.  The Jin Chen sword leaped from her storage ring.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>With Qin Sang's command, the four Yuan Ying cultivators unleashed their full power.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Water sword, serpent spear, and Jin Chen sword.  Three immensely powerful attacks struck the same point simultaneously.</p><p>Previously, Qi and Wang's attacks had simply passed through. This time, however, a deafening roar echoed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Time seemed to freeze. The three attacks hung suspended in place.</p><p>Simultaneously, within the formation, a point of crimson light, like ink in water, spread outward at a visible rate.</p>
