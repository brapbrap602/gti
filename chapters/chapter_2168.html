<h1>Chapter 2158: Beaten to the Draw</h1><p>Streams of Everbright Flame transformed into roaring fire dragons, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang and Shao Shi. By the time Qin Sang and Shao Shi retreated to the vicinity of the Eight Desolate Diagram, the entire area was engulfed in a sea of ethereal blue flames.</p><p>The Shark Woman pressed her attack, her figure flickering in and out of existence.  Each time, she relied on the Mirror God Technique to shift her position, making her movements unpredictable and preventing Qin Sang and Shao Shi from launching a sudden counterattack.</p><p>The Eight Desolate Diagram was within reach, but Shao Shi hadn't fully unleashed its power.  The two seemed to have forgotten about the diagram, focusing solely on their escape.</p><p>Naturally, this was a deliberate act.  They didn't wish to prolong the entanglement with the Shark Woman. However, if the Shark Woman grew arrogant, failed to notice the danger, and walked into the trap, they wouldn't hesitate to teach her a lesson.</p><p>As they retreated toward the Eight Desolate Diagram, Qin Sang prepared to unleash the Heaven-Trapping Golden Shackles. Both he and Shao Shi closely monitored the Shark Woman's movements.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Shark Woman was extremely cautious. As she neared the Eight Desolate Diagram, a premonition of danger arose within her. Her gaze swept across the surrounding peaks, her expression shifting slightly before her form suddenly exploded into water droplets.</p><p>In the next instant, she reappeared on a mountain several thousand zhang behind them. The Everbright Flame dispersed, the fire dragons swirling back above her head, glaring menacingly at Qin Sang and Shao Shi.</p><p>Seeing the opportunity lost, Shao Shi beckoned with his hand. Profound Yellow light flowed across the earth, converging into a scroll that leaped into his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the area behind the Shark Woman and saw a long carpet of fungi stretching across the land, reaching to the horizon.</p><p>In a short time, the Fungus Race experts had already reached the location of their previous clash.  A gigantic red mushroom, taller than the surrounding mountains, sprouted from the earth.</p><p>The mushroom cap unfurled on both sides, resembling a peculiar dwelling.</p><p>A fissure appeared on the red mushroom's surface, splitting open to reveal a massive eye. The eye swiveled, fixing its gaze upon them.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. Without hesitation, he and Shao Shi activated their escape techniques and fled without looking back.</p><p>The Shark Woman seemed eager to pursue them further, but appeared to be dissuaded by someone. She said begrudgingly, "Why won't Elder Sister intervene?  Are we just going to let them go? They've probably plundered all the treasures from the Great Calamity's nest."</p><p>A moment later, an ethereal voice drifted down from the sky, "There's no opportunity! Shao Shi is the Emperor's right-hand man, and that human cultivator has earned the Si You Clan's recognition. The strength he displays might not be his true capability. We need to utilize this initial period to complete our mission quickly. Any gains are a welcome bonus, but it's no great loss if we don't find anything. We simply arrived too late."</p><p>The Shark Woman flicked her long tail with a forceful swish and let out a soft grunt. She withdrew the Everbright Flame and turned to fly towards the giant red mushroom.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi flew for a while, confirming that no one was pursuing them before slowing their escape.  Their entry into the Sacred Lands had been fraught with complications.  However, their journey wasn't entirely fruitless.  They had gained a general understanding of the local terrain and at least confirmed that this wasn't Rootless Isle.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they decided to explore separately, agreeing to meet at a designated location two hours later.</p><p>"Fellow Cultivator Qin, what have you discovered?" Shao Shi inquired.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I haven't found the special markers indicated on the geomantic map. However, there are a few locations that might assist Fellow Daoist Si in your assessment…"</p><p>He recounted his findings. Shao Shi responded with a hum, "Fellow Cultivator Qin, these discoveries largely corroborate my judgment.  If I'm not mistaken, we should be near the Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain!"</p><p>"Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain…"</p><p>Information about the Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  It was a colossal mountain range consisting of a main ridge and countless branching ridges.  Located on the western side of the Sacred Lands, the mountain range stretched from north to south with a slight incline.  The branching ridges mostly ran east to west, resembling long legs extending from the main mountain, hence the name Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain.</p><p>"Are we on the eastern or western foothills of the Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain?" Qin Sang immediately asked.</p><p>The eastern and western foothills were vastly different.  Their agreed meeting point with the Emperor was east of the Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain. If they were on the western side, they would have to cross the main range.</p><p>"Observing the surrounding terrain, I initially thought we had landed on the western foothills, but I noticed some details that suggest we are on the eastern side!" Shao Shi said in a relaxed tone.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. The Hundred-Foot Divine Mountain wasn't easily traversed. While they weren't afraid of danger, the fewer complications, the better.</p><p>"If Fellow Cultivator Qin has no other pressing matters, let's set off," Shao Shi proposed.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed. After confirming their direction, the two immediately flew eastward.</p><p>As they continued flying for days, the terrain below gradually flattened, and the mountains became lower, while the rivers grew more abundant.</p><p>They followed a large river for several days until it flowed into a vast, ocean-like expanse of water marked on the geomantic map as the Falling Sky Lake.</p><p>Reaching Falling Sky Lake confirmed Shao Shi's judgment. They only needed to cross this lake, and they would be close to their designated meeting point.</p><p>Without pausing, they flew over the lake, taking turns keeping watch. They encountered almost no danger along the way, sensing only two instances of what might have been other cultivators' auras, but they didn't stop to investigate further.</p><p>In truth, although many foreign cultivators had entered the Sacred Lands, they were scattered across the vast expanse. Especially in the beginning, most had specific objectives and would try to avoid conflict. As long as one was mindful of concealment, encounters were unlikely.</p><p>If it hadn't been for the enraged Great Calamity and the immense commotion it caused, they wouldn't have encountered three groups of adversaries in succession.  Therefore, Qin Sang wasn't worried about Liu Li's safety, knowing that Ning Zhenren would certainly provide her with protective treasures.</p><p>On their eighteenth day in the Sacred Lands, they finally crossed Falling Sky Lake and reached the eastern shore.</p><p>The eastern shore's landscape was drastically different from the western shore. The ground was riddled with fissures, resembling drought-stricken land, yet the bottoms of the ravines were full of life. However, the vegetation, like the earth, was mostly ink-black, giving the area a somewhat sinister appearance.</p><p>They flew above the ravines. Shao Shi focused his senses, finally locking onto their correct position.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>They arrived above a ravine, looking down into its depths.</p><p>The scenery within was no different from elsewhere, perhaps with slightly denser vegetation, and they sensed nothing unusual.</p><p>Shao Shi took out a jade token and crushed it. A moment later, a calm voice echoed from the depths of the ravine, "Has Lord Shao Shi arrived?"</p><p>"It's the First Prince!"</p><p>Shao Shi transmitted his voice to inform Qin Sang, then cupped his hands in the void, saying, "Indeed, it is I. Greetings, First Prince."</p><p>As the voice echoed, subtle ripples spread across the ravine, forming a gateway.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Shao Shi, flashing through the gateway and arriving at the bottom of the valley, where they met the First Prince.  He possessed a dignified bearing and a regal aura, but it was evident that he was consciously emulating the Emperor.</p><p>It was rumored that the First Prince was the only child born from the Emperor's harmonious blending of Yin and Yang, resembling the Emperor the most and enjoying his greatest favor. The First Prince lived up to expectations, having already broken through to the second stage of the Void Realm's mid-phase, with the potential to inherit the throne.</p><p>Beside the First Prince stood a figure veiled in light gauze, with a posture more akin to a woman's. This person also possessed the cultivation of the second stage of the Void Realm's mid-phase. Yet, Shao Shi showed no disrespect, greeting them with a cupped hand and addressing them as "Honored Guest Qing."</p><p>This person's name was a single character – Chao. Their family origins were unknown. They served as a guest advisor in the First Prince's residence, holding no official position, yet the First Prince treated them with the respect due a teacher.</p><p>Shao Shi was the Emperor's right-hand man, not the First Prince's teacher.</p><p>The First Prince turned his gaze to Qin Sang.  "Si Ge greets Realized Person Qin! I have long admired Realized Person Qin's deeds.  We rushed here just before the Sacred Lands opened to improve our strength and, unfortunately, missed the opportunity to visit Realized Person Qin."</p><p>"I am unworthy of such esteem from the First Prince."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in return. He didn't sense the Emperor's presence, furrowing his brow slightly.</p><p>"Has His Majesty not arrived yet?" Shao Shi asked.</p><p>"We happened to land nearby and have been waiting for several days, but there's still no news of Father…"</p><p>A flicker of worry crossed the First Prince's eyes, not for the Emperor's safety, but rather the fear that delays might lead to unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Without the Emperor's arrival, they didn't know the precise location of their objective and could only wait patiently. Fortunately, the Emperor didn't keep them waiting long.  On the morning of the third day, his voice echoed from outside the valley.</p><p>The three parties converged, and the Emperor appeared travel-worn, suggesting his journey hadn't been easy.</p><p>His gaze swept over them. "Only the four of you?"</p><p>The First Prince respectfully replied, "We haven't heard from anyone else. Should we wait a bit longer?"</p><p>"No need!" The Emperor said gravely. "Time is of the essence. Leave a marker, and we'll depart immediately!"</p><p>He had certainly invited more than just these helpers, but the ones he valued most were undoubtedly Shao Shi and Qin Sang.  The others were secondary.  Having them travel together was to ensure their timely arrival.</p><p>The group of six left behind markers to guide the others and then displayed their respective powers, vanishing into the distance.</p><p>Accompanying the Emperor was his consort, bestowed the title An Ling Fei, whose cultivation was comparable to the First Prince's, indicating considerable strength.</p><p>Combined, the six of them were among the most formidable forces in the Sacred Lands. Unless they encountered a Saint Realm beast, few beings could deter them.</p><p>The Emperor led the way, the others following closely, flying north along the eastern shore of Falling Sky Lake.</p><p>Several hours later, as dusk descended, they sped through the night, finally arriving at their destination.</p><p>Above a ravine, the Emperor halted, overlooking the valley below.</p><p>The eastern shore of Falling Sky Lake at night presented a starkly different scene from the daytime.  The ravine was pitch-black, the trees resembling clawing demons, making the scene even more sinister and terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, secretly activating the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability, but discerned nothing unusual below.</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor sat cross-legged in mid-air, raising his right hand. His fingers twitched gently, scattering a fine dust that drifted down with the wind.</p><p>Next, the Emperor's hands formed a series of seals, striking at the void and triggering a profound transformation. The Emperor seemed to be searching for something, but even after a quarter of an hour, there was still no reaction.</p><p>Shao Shi and the others, privy to the details, weren't surprised. The place they sought wasn't fixed in one location; it moved around. Ever since the Imperial Clan discovered this place, finding it had always required considerable effort.</p><p>Another hour passed. The Emperor suddenly stood and sped off in a certain direction. The others quickly followed.</p><p>They detected no other cultivators' auras in the vicinity, yet they remained cautious. Following the Emperor, they silently approached a circular, deep valley.</p><p>This was the largest and deepest valley in the surrounding area.  Its depths were unfathomable, and the aura emanating from within surprised them.</p><p>"So many vicious beasts dwell here!"</p><p>The First Prince exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>There were vicious beast nests within the deep valley, and more than one type of beast resided there.  The western and eastern sides housed two distinct groups, each with powerful beasts comparable to the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how they coexisted peacefully, perhaps because the valley was sufficiently vast, or perhaps they had recently migrated there and hadn't yet established dominance.</p><p>Everyone looked to the Emperor, awaiting his decision.</p><p>"Eliminate them. Otherwise, if any unforeseen circumstances arise later, a beast stampede will only worsen the situation," the Emperor declared decisively. "Ensure all traces are meticulously erased!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Shao Shi and Qin Sang flew towards the eastern beast nest, while An Ling Fei, the First Prince, and Guest Qing headed west.  The Emperor, meanwhile, flashed into the central part of the deep valley.</p><p>...</p><p>*Whoosh!*  *Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi silently arrived before the vicious beast nest.</p><p>"I'll trouble Realized Person Qin to deploy the Heaven-Trapping Golden Shackles to suppress the beasts," Shao Shi said.</p><p>It was an open secret that Grand Protector's Heaven-Trapping Golden Shackles had fallen into Qin Sang's possession.  There was no reason not to refine such a treasure.</p><p>They needed to eliminate these beasts while minimizing the resulting disturbance to avoid attracting attention.  The Eight Desolate Diagram's drawback was that it required time to set up in advance.  The Heaven-Trapping Golden Shackles weren't overkill; there was a beast below comparable to the mid-stage Soul Formation, and beasts possessed strange and unpredictable powers.  Caution was warranted.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, flicking his wide sleeve. Golden light pierced the air, transforming into golden shackles.</p><p>This immediately alerted the beast below.  A powerful aura erupted in response.</p><p>"Croak!"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A gray mist shot out from the dense forest with astonishing speed.</p><p>Within the gray mist was a bizarre beast, toad-like in form but with eight legs.  Its face bore only a single vertical eye, glaring furiously at Qin Sang as if flames were about to erupt.</p><p>"Croak!"</p><p>Its throat pulsed, its mouth opening slightly as if about to spew something.</p><p>Just then, golden light descended from the sky, sweeping across the beast. The light appeared gentle and harmless, yet it caused the beast's body to stiffen, its eyes glazing over, the contents of its throat unable to be expelled.</p><p>A cultivation comparable to the mid-stage Soul Formation was indeed unable to resist the power of the Void Domain. Shao Shi, having already been waiting, seized the opportunity and struck decisively. A large, furry hand materialized in the void, slamming down on the beast.</p><p>Unable to offer any resistance, the beast's head exploded with a *splat*, brain matter splattering everywhere.</p><p>*Splat! Splat! Splat!*</p><p>Shao Shi delivered several more blows, ending the beast's life, then struck the forest with another palm, completely annihilating the entire beast group.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed behind to clean up the aftermath, while Shao Shi went to assist on the other side.</p><p>Soon, the beasts were eliminated, and the Emperor had located the entrance.</p><p>They arrived before a patch of black forest. The Emperor employed some unknown technique, revealing a path within the forest, winding and secluded.</p><p>At the end of the path, a mountain appeared before them, its rounded peak resembling a burial mound.  At the foot of the mountain was a cave, built of green bricks, like a tomb passage.</p><p>A flicker of joy crossed the Emperor's eyes.  Just as he was about to flash into the green brick tomb passage, his expression suddenly shifted, his gaze fixated on one side of the passage.</p><p>The others noticed his change and followed his gaze, but saw nothing.</p><p>The Emperor's face darkened further, and he said coldly, "Someone has beaten us to the draw!"</p>
