<h1>Chapter 752: The Light Armor</h1><p>The local flag assaulted the ancient barrier, meeting fierce resistance.</p><p>Waves of yellow light surged continuously, nearly submerging the stone hall.  The ground trembled incessantly; a rumbling sound emanated from the depths, making it difficult for everyone to stay seated.  They clung steadfastly to the local flag, maintaining the spirit array.</p><p>After a moment, a welcome sign appeared; the ancient barrier began to violently fluctuate, gradually dimming.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiang Yi’s face lit up.  He urgently shouted, “Fellow Daoists, continue!  Use all your strength on the local flag!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others increased their efforts.</p><p>A continuous flow of earth elemental power converged.  The ground shook more violently, like a real earthquake. The booming sound was deafening; cracks appeared on many stones.</p><p>Then, Xiang Yi extended a hand, pressing it firmly onto the triangular flag.  In an instant, a dazzling light erupted, shooting out like an arrow.</p><p>With a deafening “boom,” a circular opening was blasted through the ancient barrier.</p><p>However, this ancient barrier wasn't as simple as it seemed. After being breached by the local flag, runes flickered in the gap, slowly repairing the damage and repelling the yellow light.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiang Yi didn't dare delay. He withdrew his hand, whispering, “Fellow Daoists, maintain the local flag.  Xiang will be back soon.”</p><p>Saying this, Xiang Yi abandoned the local flag, tapped his foot, and his figure flashed before the ancient barrier, leaping inside.</p><p>The thought that their task would be completed once he retrieved the treasure filled everyone's minds, easing their tension.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly furrowed his brows and subconsciously looked down at the ground.</p><p>Because of the local flag, the ground had been shaking constantly, especially where they stood. Cracks had spread through the stone, though the impact hadn't been significant.</p><p>It was the same now; seemingly no different from before. Yet, Qin Sang felt something amiss, though he couldn’t pinpoint the cause.</p><p>“Rumble… rumble…”</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>Within the tremor, there was a rhythmic pulse.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face suddenly changed.  Before he could shout, the ground exploded with a “boom” directly beneath them, without warning.</p><p>A powerful shockwave erupted from the earth, instantly shattering the ground.</p><p>Everyone was completely unprepared.</p><p>Rocks flew everywhere, creating chaos.</p><p>A deep hole appeared at the center of the explosion, from which a slender figure shot upwards, like a frenzied dragon.  Nearly ten feet of its length emerged from the earth—who knew how much longer it was underground?</p><p>No one had noticed that this beast had been lurking beneath them!</p><p>Because no one was maintaining the triangular flag of the array's eye, and the local flag was focused on the ancient barrier, leaving other areas undefended, the flag array was instantly shattered by the beast.  Everyone was inevitably affected by the shockwave, cries of alarm filled the air as they were thrown about, scattered helter-skelter.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly activated his golden armor, blocking the impact, but still felt a tightness in his chest.</p><p>This beast's strength was absolutely on par with a late-stage妖丹 (yao dan) demon beast!</p><p>Worse still, everyone was scattered, losing the protection of the bone lotus.  Purple mist surged everywhere.  Qin Sang felt a burning sensation on his skin, quickly activating his protective spiritual light, his true essence rapidly depleting.</p><p>Just as he was about to awaken the fat silkworm and regroup with the others, he sensed a strong wind above his head.  He looked up sharply, his eyes narrowing, his face turning pale.</p><p>The purple mist above had somehow thinned, revealing countless dark shadows in the air—they were purple star eagles!</p><p>Judging from their number, it was likely the entire flock.</p><p>Using the purple weasel as bait, they had easily shaken off the purple star eagles soon after crossing the valley.  Never did they imagine that the purple star eagles had relentlessly pursued them all the way here.</p><p>Furthermore, they only noticed the eagles' proximity at such a short distance.</p><p>On second thought, it wasn’t surprising. The commotion caused by the local flag was immense, not only masking the beast's movements but also drowning out the sound of the purple star eagles' flight.</p><p>Here, shrouded in poisonous mist, they couldn't see outside, and dared not use their divine sense, limiting their spiritual perception to a minimum, almost like being blind.</p><p>Now, even sound was inaudible. No wonder they didn't notice the danger so close at hand.</p><p>They had set up several early warning barriers before activating the local flag, yet none of them had worked, for some reason.</p><p>They were facing enemies both above and below.</p><p>The purple star eagles stared down ferociously, their eyes filled with rage and utter madness.</p><p>The purple mist dissipated, replaced by a dense swarm of purple star eagles, blotting out the sky.</p><p>‘Liiit!’</p><p>The purple star eagles shrieked in rage, seemingly filled with an intense hatred, diving down relentlessly, as if suicidal.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Everyone's faces turned pale at the sight; even Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.  His position at the front made him the first target.</p><p>The others fared no better.  Still reeling from the subterranean beast's attack, they were instantly overwhelmed by the onslaught of eagles.</p><p>“Rendezvous at the stone hall…”</p><p>That was the last thing Qin Sang vaguely heard from the cultivator surnamed Liu before losing sight of everyone, engulfed in a sea of purple star eagles.</p><p>Fighting individually, escaping the eagle's encirclement was uncertain; they might die from the poison before the eagles could finish them off.</p><p>If Xiang Yi reacted quickly enough, he should have escaped from the stone hall when the chaos started.  With the bone lotus in his possession, meeting him was their only hope of survival.</p><p>There was no time to ponder the subterranean beast and the purple star eagles' sudden appearance.</p><p>“Liiit!”</p><p>The eagles' shrieks were deafening.  One swooped at Qin Sang's face.  In a flash, a light flared from his brow, his ebony sword moving like lightning, piercing the eagle and exploding in a burst of energy, pulverizing its body.</p><p>However, the other eagles showed no fear or hesitation, their eyes burning with a blind, murderous fury.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He activated his sword array, cutting down the nearest eagles, but the gaps were instantly filled.</p><p>He frowned. While his strikes were swift, they weren't effortless.  To counteract the poison mist, he had to constantly use his spiritual energy, making him a beacon to the eagles.  He couldn't hide, and at this rate, he'd be exhausted soon.</p><p>“I wonder how everyone else is doing?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, continuing to fight while opening his insect pouch.</p><p>The fat silkworm awakened, leaping onto his palm. After a wiggle, it noticed the poison mist, but without hesitation, it spat out a rainbow-colored aura.</p>
