Chapter 607: Bones Scattered in the Wilderness


Had they finally reached the summit of the Tianshan Mountains?
Qin Sang wondered silently, curious about the purpose of these opulent palaces and the mysterious black tower, and what had led to their ruin.
Having witnessed many strange sights within the Purple Subtlety Palace, his capacity for astonishment had grown considerably.
Mesmerized, Qiu Mubai and the others gazed at the surrounding scenery, unable to tear their eyes away.
"Let's ascend the tower together.  We can move faster that way.  Ideally, we should reach the top before they break through the Immortal Formation.  Although those old fellows will mostly be drawn to the core area, there's no guarantee that someone won't pass by here and discover us."
Dongyang Bo summoned his natal magic treasure, the Diamond Bracelet.
Chen Yan produced a slender, elegant sword. Its hilt was crafted from pristine crystal, carved into the shape of a phoenix. It was a breathtaking sight.
Holding the Phoenix Sword, she looked valiant and heroic.
*Whoosh!*
With a swing of the Phoenix Sword, a sword aura, shaped like a phoenix, flew out with a soft cry.
Dongyang Bo also timely launched the Diamond Bracelet, shooting out a bracelet shadow.  Together, the phoenix sword aura and bracelet shadow struck the tower door.
*Clang!*
After a metallic clang, the phoenix sword aura and the bracelet shadow vanished.  The tower door shimmered, and countless eerie runes appeared, resembling demonic shadows.
With a serious expression, Dongyang Bo urged the Diamond Bracelet, shooting out bracelet shadows like a string of pearls.  Chen Yan, not to be outdone, followed suit.
Their coordination was impeccable.
Soon, the runes on the tower door shattered with a muffled boom, and the door slowly opened.
"Enter!"
Dongyang Bo withdrew his Diamond Bracelet, gave a low shout, and charged into the black tower first. The others quickly followed.
Before entering the black tower, none of them had anticipated that the interior would be so vast, stretching as far as the eye could see, rather than a confined space.
Within the dim, expansive space, hills and mountains rose and fell.
However, the area was lifeless and devoid of greenery, with only bare, rocky mountains. Occasionally, dry riverbeds could be seen.
Shockingly, the ground was covered with bones, sometimes interspersed with fragments of broken weapons.
It appeared that this place had once been a battlefield, a site of terrible carnage.
Qiu Mubai and the others were stunned by this gruesome sight.
The small, dark tower was a place of death!
The bones were too fragmented to determine whether they belonged to humans or demons. The weapons were heavily corroded, their power long gone.
Fortunately, the surroundings were quiet, with no sign of any dangerous presence.
If the entities responsible for the slaughter still lingered, everyone present would perish.
They appeared on a mountain, with a rock face behind them. A shimmering, ethereal door appeared in the center of the rock face.
After entering, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan seemed oblivious to the scattered bones. They flew deeper into the space without pause, traversing mountains and valleys until they found a dark stone.
After a combined assault, a barrier emerged on the stone. Once the barrier shattered, an identical door appeared, just like the one on the rock face.
Each door seemed to represent a level within the black tower.
It was unclear how many levels the tower had.
Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai, and the others silently followed Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, observing as they broke through one door after another, ascending level by level, each level revealing a similarly vast space.
The scenery varied from level to level, but the ubiquitous bones and evidence of past slaughter remained constant.
Qin Sang and the others became numb, unable to comprehend the sheer number of lives lost within the tower.
The higher they climbed, the more concealed the doors became, and the stronger the barriers grew.
Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan's progress slowed considerably.  Later, they even needed to consume spirit pills and rest briefly before continuing to break the barriers.
However, they never asked Qin Sang and the others for assistance.
"Seventh floor!"
Another door opened.
This time, it was exceptionally difficult. Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan exhausted all their efforts before finally breaking the barrier on the door.
Qin Sang followed them through the doorway into a new space, silently counting the levels.  Including the initial door, this was the seventh they had opened, marking the seventh floor of the black tower.
Once again, they were met with an endless expanse of bones.
Qin Sang stared blankly at the surroundings. The atmosphere was eerie, and no one felt inclined to speak.
The carefree expressions on Qiu Mubai and the others' faces had long vanished, replaced by contemplative looks.  They seemed to have gained some profound insight.
As the most promising disciples of their sect within their respective realms, they had a certain arrogance. However, after witnessing this small tower filled with countless bones, they all fell silent.
How much stronger were they compared to those who had perished here?  Perhaps not much at all.  What was there to be proud of?
After recovering, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan continued their ascent.
After flying for a long time, they arrived at a pile of bones.
Pushing aside the bones revealed a cave.  The door to this level was hidden within an underground cavern. It was a mystery how they had located it.
The cave floor was also covered in bones. They crunched under their feet as they walked to the end, where they encountered a wall of earth.  Dongyang Bo turned to Qin Sang and the other five, commanding, "Now, summon your Five Elements Beast Seals and activate the beast souls to help us break the barrier!"
Were they nearing the top of the tower?
Qin Sang wondered silently. He responded affirmatively and focused his divine sense on the beast seal within his body, summoning it forth.
The cavern wasn't spacious.  The five of them standing before the earth wall nearly filled the space.  Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan retreated to the sides, summoning their own magic treasures in preparation to break the barrier.
The Five Elements Beast Seals were arranged according to the five cardinal directions.
Ji Qing held the Gouchen Beast Seal in the center, but the true core of the formation was Qiu Mubai, who possessed the greatest apparent strength.
"Form the array!"
The five positioned themselves and raised their beast seals high.
At Qiu Mubai's command, they focused their minds on the seals, releasing the beast souls contained within.
"Roar!"
Suddenly, thunderous roars echoed through the narrow cavern.
Bone fragments on the ground swirled in the air.
"Roar! Roar..."
The roars intensified, and the five beast seals simultaneously emitted dazzling light.
A spectral figure emerged from the Black Tortoise Beast Seal in Qin Sang's hand, possessing thick limbs, a heavy shell, and sharp fangs, closely resembling a true Black Tortoise.
The other beast souls appeared similarly lifelike, despite being artificially created.
These fierce beast souls lunged forward, attempting to turn on their masters, but were firmly suppressed.
"Follow my lead, Five Elements Unite!"
Once the beast souls stabilized, Qiu Mubai roared. Qin Sang and the others quickly urged their beast souls toward Qiu Mubai's White Tiger Beast Soul.
One by one, the spectral figures merged into the White Tiger Beast Soul.
The combined Five Elements Beast Soul took on a bizarre form, no longer resembling any single creature.
Immense pressure bore down on Qiu Mubai, his face turning pale. His beast seal was the first to shatter, followed by the others.
"Go!"
With his last ounce of strength, Qiu Mubai propelled the combined beast soul into the earth wall!
