<h1>Chapter 588: Secrets of the Magical Treasures</h1><p>This soul-searching technique, undoubtedly a creation of the demonic sect, is incredibly vicious. I wonder where Yun Youzi obtained it.  Once used, the soul is instantly shattered.  Even if Yi Tiannie hadn't cultivated demonic arts, he couldn't possibly have entered reincarnation.  Considering the suffering this fiend inflicted upon him, leaving him in constant fear, Qin Sang felt no pity whatsoever.  He watched coldly as Yi Tiannie's remnant soul struggled in his palm, displaying the utmost agony, as if undergoing the tortures of hell. Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Yun Youzi emerged from the Blood Restriction of the Demon King. His strength had partially returned; he was no longer so weak.  The stone hall had returned to calm. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire had returned to the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner, which Qin Sang put away.</p><p>A murmuring sound of flowing water echoed from the lake bottom.  The underground river continuously replenished the dried-up lake, which would soon be full again. However, the sound of water was completely drowned out by screams.  In all his time in the cultivation world, Qin Sang had never heard such piercing cries, showcasing the terrifying torment Yi Tiannie endured.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang, whose eyes were hard as steel, and sighed softly.  "Qin, rest assured. I swear on my heart demon that what happened today will remain between us. I won't ask about your past; I only hope that even if you walk in darkness, a light will always remain in your heart. Do not succumb to it."</p><p>Qin Sang, lost in thought, raised his head expressionlessly, seemingly realizing only now what had happened. After a moment's hesitation, he nodded solemnly, "I am grateful for your guidance."</p><p>At that moment, Yi Tiannie's screams ceased. The resentment on his face vanished, replaced by relief, and his remnant soul shattered with a 'boom'. Yun Youzi extended a hand towards Yi Tiannie's remaining soul, gathering the spirit essence, refining it in his palm into a sphere of the purest soul energy, which he gave to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Don't waste it. Let your Flying Night Rakshasa absorb it; it might trigger a transformation."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the soul energy, somewhat doubtful. "Senior, the method I used to refine this Flying Night Rakshasa differs from other corpse-cultivation sects' techniques. Once refined, its strength cannot be further increased, making improvement unlikely."</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled faintly. "I knew your corpse-refinement technique was unique. However, this is different. It wouldn't work for others, but Yi Tiannie is different. Didn't you notice? Yi Tiannie intended to completely possess this corpse, using a demonic art to merge his soul with the Flying Night Rakshasa's spirit, forming a strong connection between the two. This opportunity is rare; it might break the limitations. Yi Tiannie's consciousness is gone, so you don't have to worry about losing control of your refined corpse again. This is the most fundamental soul power of a late Foundation Establishment cultivator. If your refined corpse absorbs it, it will surely benefit greatly and might even transform into a true Flying Night Rakshasa.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  Yun Youzi's words held merit. Besides Yi Tiannie's self-inflicted demise, no one else would voluntarily merge with a refined corpse, which is why Qin Sang hadn't considered this possibility before.</p><p>It was worth a try.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang switched back to the Flying Night Rakshasa, meticulously inspecting it several times before finally feeling reassured. He then allowed it to absorb Yi Tiannie's refined soul energy.</p><p>Initially, the Flying Night Rakshasa showed no change, remaining calm.  But after a few breaths, its aura suddenly became chaotic, and it clutched its head, roaring incessantly. Qin Sang used all his might to calm it, eventually succeeding.  However, its spirit remained unstable, undergoing intense changes, and would likely remain so for a while. Its combat strength would be lost during this period.</p><p>"It's a good thing!  It's likely undergoing a transformation!"</p><p>Yun Youzi declared, then seemed to remember something and asked Qin Sang with some reluctance, "Qin, how did you come to use demonic corpse cultivation on yourself?  Are there any lasting consequences?"</p><p>"Senior, I have five elemental spiritual roots."</p><p>Qin Sang stated this seemingly calmly, offering a wry smile.  Five-elemental spiritual root cultivators barely manage to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, let alone Golden Core.  If not desperate, who would resort to corpse cultivation? Even the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were ineffective; besides this path, Qin Sang didn't know what else to do.</p><p>"I was fortunate to find a chance to reach Golden Core through corpse cultivation, and the consequences are easily dealt with..."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded. "That's good!  By the way, here is the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit for you."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the crimson cloud purple fruit, feeling a surge of excitement and relief.  The quest for it had been arduous, but the reward was astonishing.</p><p>She had just performed a soul search, confirming the existence of the Three Lights Jade Liquid within the Purple Micro Palace and pinpointing its location.  Retrieval was now imminent.</p><p>During the soul search, Qin Sang also gleaned information, primarily regarding the use and creation of the Ten Directions Yama Banner, a powerful artifact.</p><p>Obtaining the crafting method would allow her to complete the banner to ten poles, granting it power comparable to a top-tier artifact—a prospect she found irresistible.</p><p>This was the prized possession of Old Ancestor Kuiyin.  After his death, the method was expected to be passed down, but Qin Sang searched through Daoist Jiupao's belongings without success.</p><p>She assumed this secret technique would be lost forever after the deaths of Kuiyin Sect's three Golden Core cultivators.  Unexpectedly, she obtained it from Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang understands the banner's composition:</p><p>It consists of three parts:</p><p>1. The pole: surprisingly simple in material.  As she suspected, it was the mysterious iron pillar from Daoist Jiupao's possessions—neither entirely iron nor stone.</p><p>However, refining this pillar into a banner pole is no easy feat.  The pillar is an extraordinary material, incredibly hard and imbued with strange restrictions.  It requires a special spirit array powered by high-grade spirit stones for even a chance at refinement.</p><p>No wonder Daoist Jiupao held onto those four high-grade spirit stones until his death. He planned to use the pillar to re-refine his life-saving artifact once recovered, a task demanding such stones.  High-grade spirit stones are rare; selling them is easy, but acquiring more is difficult, especially since the Kuiyin Sect was destroyed and Daoist Jiupao was left destitute, essentially a rogue cultivator.</p><p>2. The banners: not crafted from spirit materials, but woven from threads created using a devilish ghost path technique, using countless captured souls condensed into the purest soul energy.</p><p>Extremely wicked.  Old Ancestor Kuiyin sacrificed countless lives for this artifact.</p><p>This explains Qin Sang's previous failure to repair the damaged banner sections. Repair requires living souls.  Fortunately, the damage is minor and the souls within her existing, less powerful Ten Directions Yama Banners are sufficient.  Those banners, useless to her now that she is a Golden Core cultivator, are perfect for this purpose.</p>
