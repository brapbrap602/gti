<h1>Chapter 720: Old Devil Mu</h1><p>“The conflict between the two races ended five years ago. How could it be so soon?”</p><p>The war between the Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Alliance, from the first signs of dispute to the opening of the Violet Palace and the forced truce, lasted for several decades.</p><p>Neither region, in terms of area, cultivator population, or strength, could compare to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang originally estimated that the war between the two races would last at least a hundred years before a conclusion could be reached. He had been worried that the intensity of the war would leave the human cultivators without the resources to open the Seven Kills Hall, affecting his plans.</p><p>Although humans were strong, the Wu Clan also had many powerful Nascent Soul cultivators, not to mention that the Wu Clan had initiated the conflict.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the large-scale war, into which the Wu Clan had poured all its resources, ended after only a little over ten years, concluding abruptly like a farce, something unprecedented.</p><p>“Who won in the end, us or the Wu Clan?” Qin Sang asked curiously.</p><p>The man in black armor shook his head. “There was no victor. The two races have reconciled. There are many rumors, but they are all speculation and incredibly outlandish, not to be believed.”</p><p>The Wu Clan must have had a deeper reason for initiating the war, risking defeat and annihilation.</p><p>Unfortunately, their cultivation levels were insufficient for them to be privy to the higher levels of decision-making.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that regardless of the Wu Clan’s purpose, it had nothing to do with him. Now that the two races had ceased hostilities and the situation had stabilized, it was a good thing. He no longer needed to fear being caught in the crossfire and forced into hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang then inquired further about the outside world from the man in black armor.</p><p>He discreetly ascertained a few key dates and, after some calculations, formed a rough understanding of what had transpired on Coldflame Island.</p><p>After the conflict between the two races began, the island lords of the Demonic Sea, unwilling to get involved, adopted a policy of isolating their islands and avoiding the conflict. Before the war ended, the island lord of Boundless Heaven Island had not discovered that a shapeshifting great demon had infiltrated the Thousand Demons Sea Region, plotting to seize the Coldflame.</p><p>It wasn't until five years ago, when the conflict subsided and the lockdown on Boundless Heaven Island was lifted, that they gradually noticed something amiss in the Thousand Demons Sea Region. The island lord, upon personally investigating, encountered the shapeshifting great demon and immediately recognized the Winterfire Coldflame.</p><p>The Winterfire Coldflame was the ultimate divine ability of the late Grand Master Winterfire and naturally couldn't fall into the hands of the demon race.</p><p>If that great demon absorbed the Winterfire Coldflame, its power would undoubtedly surge, posing a threat to Boundless Heaven Island.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul level powerhouses engaged in a fierce battle that ravaged the area, the aftershocks easily destroying Coldflame Island.</p><p>The island lord of Boundless Heaven Island was slightly stronger and drove the great demon back into the depths of the Demonic Sea. This battle occurred two years ago, coinciding with the period of unrest in the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Feigning curiosity about the Coldflame, Qin Sang approached one of the smaller flames. The man in black armor not only didn't stop him, but watched on with amusement, as if waiting for Qin Sang to make a fool of himself.</p><p>This second close encounter with the Coldflame felt completely different from the last.</p><p>Previously, the Winterfire Coldflame had not yet fragmented and burned like a torch, exuding a terrifying chill that kept people at bay.</p><p>This small Coldflame seemed much gentler, like a small blue flower blooming quietly on the sea surface, appearing harmless.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, then tentatively channeled a wisp of true essence, gently touching the flame.</p><p>The seemingly insignificant wisp of Winterfire Coldflame, however, instantly bared its fangs as the true essence approached.</p><p>Like a flower bud about to bloom, a blue halo suddenly burst forth from the Coldflame, rapidly expanding outwards.</p><p>Wherever the halo passed, a dense cracking sound could be heard, instantly forming a thick layer of ice.</p><p>Even more alarmingly, Qin Sang discovered that the wisp of true essence he had released had also been frozen, and a terrifying chill was spreading towards him along the essence.</p><p>Startled, Qin Sang quickly severed the connection with the wisp of true essence and retreated hastily.</p><p>After a while, the Winterfire Coldflame calmed down.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's disheveled appearance, the man in black armor burst into laughter. “Fellow Daoist, don’t underestimate it because of its small size. Even this tiny Coldflame could be fatal if it froze either of us. That shapeshifting great demon, after discovering the Coldflame, guarded it here for who knows how many years, yet couldn't absorb it. After driving away the great demon, the island lord remained here for several months, trying every method imaginable, but couldn't overcome Grand Master Winterfire's lingering aura within the Coldflame and claim it. Furthermore, because the Coldflame is too fierce, even setting up restrictions to conceal it is difficult. Fortunately, Grand Master Winterfire set up some measures before his passing, some remnants of which remain, allowing for the temporary containment of the Coldflame. The island lord left me, Lu, here to guard it, lest that great demon harbor malicious intentions and return.”</p><p>Having experienced the Coldflame's power firsthand, Qin Sang knew that the man in black armor was speaking the truth.</p><p>His eyes flickered, his mind seemingly occupied with something.</p><p>“If even the island lord can't claim the Coldflame, is there any need to worry about the demon race obtaining it? With the Coldflame here, will Fellow Daoist be trapped in this place, unable to leave?”</p><p>“The island lord said that the great demon has the bloodline of an ancient Fire Toad. The Winterfire Coldflame shouldn’t be fragmented like this; it's all thanks to that demon. Perhaps, given more time, it really could absorb the Winterfire Coldflame. We can’t let our guard down.”</p><p>The man in black armor said casually, “I won’t be stuck here for too long. The island lord has contacted an old acquaintance, supposedly a demonic giant from the Inner Sea, the island lord of Skywind Island, Mu Lue, also known as Old Devil Mu. He’s interested in the Winterfire Coldflame. If he can take the Coldflame away, this whole incident will naturally be resolved.”</p><p>“Old Devil Mu…”</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memory. He only had a superficial understanding of the Inner Sea's power structure and hadn't heard of this person.</p><p>“In that case, I can rest easy. Thank you, Fellow Daoist Lu, for enlightening me. I’ve been trapped in the Demonic Sea for too long and am exhausted. I can’t wait to return. We shall meet again if fate allows.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands, about to leave, when the man in black armor unexpectedly called out to him.</p><p>“Hold on, Fellow Daoist. Since you’ve been hunting demons in the Demonic Sea for many years, with your strength, you should have quite a harvest, right? Do you have any spirit materials or demon cores from demon beasts with ancient divine beast bloodlines, especially descendants of the divine beast Black Tortoise? I'm willing to buy them all.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I do have some, and I happen to have slain a Black Tortoise, but they are all from demon beasts in the early stages of Demon Core formation. I’m afraid they won't catch your eye.”</p><p>These demon beasts were known as descendants of divine beasts and inherited some of the divine beasts' powers. Their demon cores and spirit materials were also much more valuable than those of ordinary sea beasts.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>The man in black armor waved his hand, his face lighting up. “These demon beasts are powerful. Those with higher cultivation are not only rare but also difficult to kill. Could you show me the tortoise shell, Fellow Daoist…”</p><p>The two unexpectedly began discussing a trade in the middle of nowhere above the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang sold him some demon cores and spirit materials, receiving satisfactory items in return. The two chatted amicably, and upon parting, even agreed to meet again in the future.</p><p>Bidding farewell to the man in black armor, Qin Sang summoned his escape light and departed alone.</p>
