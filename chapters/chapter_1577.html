<h1>Chapter 1568: The Yan Shan Elder</h1><p>Chapter 1568: The Yan Shan Elder</p><p>Leaving Bu Nian Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back one last time.</p><p>Until now, Bu Nian Mountain was the only potential ally in Central State.</p><p>Several important pieces of intelligence had been obtained through Bu Nian Mountain, providing timely updates on the situation and ensuring an accurate grasp of the overall situation.</p><p>Losing this channel from Bu Nian Mountain would make things much harder in the future.</p><p>For a sect, ensuring its legacy is paramount, so Situ Yu's decision is understandable.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, withdrew his gaze, and returned to Pu Mountain.</p><p>His main body focused on stabilizing his cultivation and practicing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>His secondary body took out the remaining cold crystals, preparing to refine them to determine their effectiveness for the *Ice Soul Divine Light* technique, before deciding whether to visit the Yan Shan Elder.</p><p>Regardless of the changing tides of the world,</p><p>they wouldn't affect the small Fufu County for now.</p><p>Three years later.</p><p>After refining the cold crystals, with pleasing results, Qin Sang decided to make a trip to the Northern Wastelands, with both his main and secondary bodies.</p><p>He planned for his secondary body to visit the Yan Shan Elder with the Sky Eye Butterfly; the search for the cold crystals would be handled by the secondary body.</p><p>This wouldn't interfere with his main body’s cultivation of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>However, the Sky Eye Butterfly was too important to his main body, so Qin Sang wasn't comfortable letting his secondary body take it alone. His main body would follow secretly to prevent any accidents.</p><p>On Pu Mountain.</p><p>Zhou Ruan and his wife received a message and came to Pu Mountain for instructions.</p><p>They were greeted by Xie An and a rising star named Xie Ruyun.</p><p>Forty years ago, Xie Qian's lifespan ended naturally.</p><p>His cultivation stagnated at the mid-Golden Core stage.</p><p>Before his death, Xie Qian witnessed the prosperity of the Xie family and died without regrets.</p><p>The Xie family and Loutai Temple had a close relationship, leading to several couples among their disciples.  Zhou Ruan and his wife felt at home at Pu Mountain, casually sitting opposite Xie An and refusing the offered tea.</p><p>"Senior Qingfeng, what are your instructions in summoning us?"</p><p>Zhou Jin asked respectfully.</p><p>Xie An and Xie Ruyun both shook their heads, claiming ignorance.</p><p>A few moments later, the room suddenly darkened.  They saw Qin Sang's secondary body entering from outside and hurriedly rose to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the four.</p><p>He thought to himself that he still lacked sufficient manpower.  Even Zhou Jin, the most powerful among them, was still some distance from the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>In times of peace, Yuan Ying cultivators focused on cultivation and tribulation, their whereabouts unpredictable.</p><p>In the cultivation world, Golden Core cultivators were considered experts.</p><p>With turmoil approaching, Zhou Jin and the others were insufficient. Having a Yuan Ying subordinate would make many things easier.</p><p>Unfortunately, forming a Yuan Ying wasn't so easy.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered Qingyang Temple.</p><p>A retreat of a hundred years had passed.</p><p>How many cultivators at Qingyang Temple had achieved the Dao?</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was certainly out of the question.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, Mei Gu, and Li Yu Fu—from oldest to youngest. Shangguan Lifeng and Qin Sang were of similar age, and even the youngest, Li Yu Fu, was no more than fifty years younger than him.</p><p>If they had failed to form a Yuan Ying, they would likely be deceased by now.</p><p>After parting ways with old friends, there would be no more reunions.</p><p>Before leaving the North Sea, Qin Sang had anticipated this. After arriving in the Central State, he knew he wouldn't be able to return for a considerable time.</p><p>Remembering this still brought a sigh.</p><p>One day, once matters in the Central State were resolved, and he returned to the North Sea, how many familiar faces would he still see?</p><p>Even Liuli, who had traveled with him to the Central State, had vanished without a trace over the past hundred years.</p><p>Parting from life and death was something every cultivator had to accept.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, and Zhou Jin and the others dared not speak, waiting respectfully.</p><p>After giving them some cultivation advice, Qin Sang instructed them to contact various trading houses, not to spare spirit stones, and to gather as much information as possible.</p><p>They all readily agreed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang flew out of Pu Mountain alone.</p><p>His main body was waiting outside. After absorbing the second Yuan Ying for cultivation, he embarked on his journey north.</p><p>The Yan Shan Elder's Daoist grounds were named Yan Shan, located in the northwest of the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>Situ Yu had given a general direction.</p><p>However, the Northern Wastelands were vast and sparsely populated, so finding a single mountain would still require effort.</p><p>His main body went in person.  After a hundred years of seclusion, experiencing the world’s scenery felt surreal.  He slowed his speed, traveling on the wind.</p><p>Heading north from Zhuozhou, entering Zhaoyao State.</p><p>Qin Sang distinctly sensed the tense atmosphere in Zhaoyao State. Within an hour of flying, he witnessed several battles.</p><p>Zhaoyao State didn't have a super sect like Bu Nian Mountain. Three medium-sized sects were in a three-way standoff, a situation that guaranteed instability.</p><p>Its proximity to the Northern Wastelands only exacerbated the problem.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang easily dealt with a few overzealous demonic cultivators.  Flying over Zhaoyao Mountain, he returned to the Northern Wastelands.  Growing weary of the scenery, he increased his speed.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Woo… woo…’</p><p>The wind howled like knives, a mournful cry.</p><p>Heavy snow was falling.</p><p>The term blizzard was an understatement.</p><p>A heavy gray sky pressed down, snowflakes falling like clumps of cotton, blanketing the earth in the night, seemingly without end.  Visibility was limited to the snow itself.  Such were the harsh conditions of the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>In fact, this was one of the infamous Nine Calamities of the Northern Wastelands – a blizzard, and the most widespread of them all. Once a blizzard struck, it could last for years, even decades in the worst cases. This was devastating to ordinary people, and even low-level cultivators saw their power drastically reduced.  Fortunately, blizzards rarely hit the densely populated eastern part of the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>Amidst the swirling snow, Qin Sang flew low to the ground, barely a yard above the snow's surface. He had ventured into the western part of the Northern Wastelands and unexpectedly encountered this blizzard. The blizzard's force was deflected by his protective True Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The blizzard had been raging for an unknown amount of time, filling ravines and rivers.  The snow was uniformly level as far as the eye could see, with only a few isolated peaks visible in the distance. Finding someone to ask for directions would be difficult in such conditions.</p><p>“Ah?  A living soul at last!”</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, summoning his external avatar. He commanded the Sky-Eye Butterfly to retreat into his avatar's dantian, while his true body concealed itself.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The avatar left a white streak in the air.  On a mountain ahead, three low-level cultivators were busily picking blue flowers.  Hearing the sound of air breaking, they quickly gathered together, brandishing their magic tools, their faces alert.</p><p>The next moment,</p><p>Snow fell on their faces. A figure ‘whoosh’ed down before them.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang tossed them some spirit stones and disappeared, now possessing a topographical map. Several landmarks matched the description given by Situ Yu, allowing him to pinpoint the approximate location of Yan Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang continued north, flying for half an hour. Before him lay an endless range of mountains. Because of the blizzard, only the upper halves of the peaks were visible above the snow, resembling white tombstones from afar.</p><p>This place would indeed be a good spot for seclusion.  Qin Sang considered this thought, then awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly and slowly flew towards the heart of the mountain range.</p><p>Yan Mountain was merely one mountain range within this larger range, self-named by Yan Shan Lao Ren. The three cultivators' map didn't mark Yan Mountain, indicating that Yan Shan Lao Ren was not well-known in the vicinity, just as Situ Yu had described – a hermit cultivator.</p><p>Situ Yu had once traveled to this place and befriended Yan Shan Lao Ren. They shared similar personalities and once collaborated in hunting a strange fox. However, due to Yan Shan Lao Ren's love of quietude and Situ Yu's involvement in sect affairs, their contact diminished over time.</p><p>After circling the mountain peaks for a while, the Sky-Eye Butterfly finally discovered a seemingly ordinary peak with hidden mechanisms. The snowy landscape was likely an illusion created by an array, seamlessly blending into its surroundings.  Aside from Yan Shan Lao Ren, no one else nearby could have arranged such a spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide his aura and flew directly towards the mountain.</p><p>Before he got close,</p><p>A strong voice echoed from the mountain, “Fellow Daoist, you've been lingering near this old man's cave. What is your purpose?”</p><p>“Are you Yan Shan Lao Ren?”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped at a distance as a gesture of goodwill, bowing to Yan Shan from afar and said aloud, “This humble cultivator is Qingfeng.  I’ve been recommended by Sect Leader Situ and have a request.”</p><p>“Sect Leader Situ?  Situ Yu?” Yan Shan Lao Ren chuckled, “I didn't expect that Grand Sect Leader Situ still remembers this old man.”</p><p>His tone wasn't unfriendly.</p><p>Qin Sang produced a jade slip containing his message, flicked his finger, and sent it into the mountain.</p><p>Below the seemingly flat snow, there was a void. The jade slip passed without hindrance, disappearing into the snow.</p><p>Qin Sang stood calmly.</p><p>After a while, the snow cracked open, revealing the verdant scenery below.  “Since you're recommended by Sect Leader Situ, please come in, Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him. His gaze inadvertently glanced at a low mountain at the edge of the range, but without showing any reaction, he entered Yan Mountain through the opening.  His true body had established a cave in that small mountain.</p><p>Beneath the snow, the scene was as if it were spring. From inside, one could see the snow falling endlessly, yet felt no chill here.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, seeing a white-robed elder standing in a small pavilion, looking towards him. His expression changed slightly, and he went to the pavilion.  “Greetings, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>This person's cultivation was profound and deep, his power definitely not inferior to his avatar, perhaps even comparable to Venerable Chengyuan. Such a high-level cultivator was rare even in the Central Plains, yet he was hiding in this remote place.</p><p>Yan Shan Lao Ren returned the courtesy, and without hesitation, sized Qin Sang up, directly asking, “I already know your purpose, Daoist.”</p><p>The sect leader Situ mentioned in his letter that you are proficient in ice magic, so you seek the Cold Crystal?  May I witness your abilities?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of the old man Yan Shan's intentions, obliged since he needed his help.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang summoned the Snow-Treading Blade.</p><p>Upon seeing the Snow-Treading Blade, Yan Shan's eyes lit up. He pointed to the void above. “Go ahead, friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. The Snow-Treading Blade hummed, its tip slightly rising before suddenly releasing a blade of energy.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The blade energy activated, causing snowflakes to swirl around the gazebo, mirroring the external snowy scene.  A path of snow extended to the horizon, merging with the blizzard without affecting the surrounding environment; Qin Sang's control was exquisite.</p><p>“Good! Good! Good!”</p><p>Yan Shan exclaimed three times, his gaze bright, a look of excitement on his face. “The tradition of ice magic in Central State is rare. I believe I understand seven or eight tenths of it, but your blade technique is so refined, it must be a superior tradition, one I've never even heard of.”</p><p>“Central State is vast; how could you possibly know everything?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “If you are interested, I would be happy to share what I know with you.”</p><p>He was still considering how to persuade Yan Shan to help him.</p><p>He didn't have many valuable treasures to offer. Yan Shan lived in the Northern Wastelands, so he likely wouldn't be interested in spirit stones. The Spirit-Subduing Incense would work, but that would be overkill.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Soul Crystal only held value for specific individuals.</p><p>Yan Shan nodded repeatedly. “That’s not urgent. Since you’re here for the Cold Crystal, do you understand the difficulties involved?”</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “Sect Leader Situ mentioned that he discovered this Cold Crystal when he and you were tracking a strange snow fox.”</p><p>“Correct!”</p><p>Yan Shan said gravely, “After Sect Leader Situ left, I tried several times myself, but the snow fox always escaped, and I never got the crystal. I can't guarantee there are more crystals there, but one thing is certain: to get the Cold Crystal, you must first catch the snow fox.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. “Does the snow fox use illusions to escape? I have a skill that can break illusions.”</p><p>“To my shame,” Yan Shan sighed, “that snow fox was strange. Sect Leader Situ and I couldn’t understand how it vanished right before our eyes. If it was illusion magic, it was the most advanced in the world; ordinary methods wouldn't work.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought Yan Shan's description was exaggerated.</p><p>He secretly thought the Northern Wastelands were truly bizarre.</p><p>Not only the mysterious insect king in the Sky-Splitting Valley, but also this strange snow fox, baffling two top experts.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, I would accompany you, but I'm at a critical point in my cultivation.  If you don't have complete confidence, don't waste your effort.”</p><p>Yan Shan said firmly, clearly not optimistic about Qin Sang's chances.</p><p>“How will I know unless I try? You should at least give me a chance to prove myself,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s confidence, Yan Shan became interested. “Friend, please come with me.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Yan Shan to the mountaintop.</p><p>Yan Shan nodded to Qin Sang, then clasped his hands, forming seals and striking upward; the seals vanished instantly.</p><p>Immediately, the mountain protection formation shifted dramatically.</p><p>Looking down from above,</p><p>the snowy mountain scenery disappeared, revealing the true nature of the protective formation.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt the spiritual array energy converging around them.  He narrowed his eyes, glanced at Yan Shan, and looked up.</p><p>At that moment, Yan Shan suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Yan Shan's voice echoed from all directions. “This array incorporates illusion magic. I'm using the array to hide. Few in the world can see through my technique. If you can easily stop this, I’ll personally accompany you.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath. “Agreed!”</p><p>Then, he summoned the Snow-Treading Blade again, wiping its surface.</p><p>The Snow-Treading Blade became intangible; snowflakes swirled around Qin Sang, surrounded by blade energy.</p><p>When Qin Sang was ready, Yan Shan said, “Be careful, friend!”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang heard the sound of crashing waves and found himself surrounded by raging waves, as if he were in the middle of a vast ocean.</p>
