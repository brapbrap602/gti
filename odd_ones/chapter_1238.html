   1238 Inspection and Conclusion
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
   After a long journey through Star Fields, the dynasty’s inspection
          team finally arrived at Black Star Palace and met with Han Xiao in the
          guest room.
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Greetings, Your Excellency Black Star. We’re the emissaries for
            this Kunde Race inspection.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A group of dynasty officers walked into the room with synchronized
            footsteps. The group leader reached out his hand, his tone
            respectful.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao shook his hand and invited them to sit. They briefly
            introduced themselves and took out the documents for the main topic.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Currently, there are 113 residential planets for the Kunde Race,
            with a population of trillions. The dynasty colonial review
            department gave us the allocation for twenty-five planets to open up
            for this time. This is the maximum allocation, not a fixed one. If
            no planet reaches the standard, we can also choose not to open up
            any planets.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “At most, a quarter of the population can be freed, got it.” Han
            Xiao nodded.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Every planet of the Kunde Race was locked down separately and had no
            communication with each other. Therefore, the progress of the
            cultural transformation for each planet was different. Choosing the
            planets with higher progress was the job of the inspection team.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Although the dynasty had other goals and the inspection team was
            most probably just a standard procedure, a standard was still
            required. If the results were really too far below the standard,
            they would choose not to free them.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The few of them spoke for a while. Han Xiao called the army’s patrol
            team over and told the two sides to discuss the details while he
            left the room.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Of course, he only had to show his face and express his attitude. He
            did not have to take care of the details.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao returned to his office. Not long after, he received a
            message from Phillip saying that the dynasty’s inspection team and
            the army’s patrol team had decided on the details, already boarded
            the spaceships, and left Black Star Palace to get to work.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Check the current status of the various Kunde Race planets.” Han
            Xiao told Phillip to bring up the related information.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He did not have the time to keep an eye on the transformation
            progress of the Kunde Race all the time. Now that the inspection
            team had arrived, only then did he decide to carefully go through
            the current status of the various Kunde Race planets. He could also
            see the effects of him notifying them in advance so that he could be
            prepared.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    On the hovering virtual screen, the records of the Kunde Race
            planets flashed past one after another, and Phillip spoke on the
            side.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Master, hum… according to the statistics, after the news of the
            inspection team arriving was announced, the overall state of the
            Kunde Race planets changed. The trend of anti-dynasty opinions
            decreased by forty-six percent on average, and the average
            percentage of haters decreased from thirty-two percent to seven
            percent. However, the security of some planets decreased. Murders
            occurred frequently. Some haters were killed by their own…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Killing their own race… looks like the arrival of the inspection
            team gave them hope. The more than twenty-year-long lockdown led
            them to fully understand that opening up the lockdown is the only
            way out for the race. Some of them treasure this chance, so they’ve
            started to eliminate the stubborn ones.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “That’s right, hum…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “That’s quite sensible and all, but… this might achieve the opposite
            effect.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao scratched his chin.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    By sacrificing the minority and eliminating the stubborn ones to
            show obedience, at a glance, this was for the sake of the entire
            race, quite noble even.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, the dynasty looked at things from a different
            perspective—too much yearning for freedom represented a strong
            motive. Killing one of their own meant a new chain of hate was
            formed. According to the normal inspection standards, this was a
            sign of the transformation not being thorough enough, which meant
            that the lockdown would have to continue.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, since the dynasty had decided to carry out the inspection
            so many years in advance, they clearly knew that this would happen.
            Han Xiao estimated that the standard would probably be very low, so
            this might achieve positive effects.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    For the next few months, the dynasty inspection team visited one
            Kunde Race planet after another, filling up their inspection
            records.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The double-sided mirror split Sigaia City Prison’s interrogation
            room in two. On one side was the interrogation room where the
            criminal was in, and on the other was the surveillance room.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At this time, the dynasty inspection team stood in the surveillance
            room. The team leader held a set of documents in his hands, glancing
            from time to time at the Kunde Race member inside the interrogation
            room who was cuffed up everywhere. He slowly read the content of the
            documents.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Barton, age 22, Mechanic Super, graduate of Sigaia City First Super
            Academy with excellent results. Talented, achieved Grade C last
            year, reason of imprisonment… murder and organizing murder. A total
            of 126 people died by his order. Also, he personally killed seven
            more, including his family.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “The victims were all haters according to the records. He claimed
            that this was to eliminate the stubborn members… When the marshals
            found him, he stopped his accomplices who tried to fight back. He
            chose not to resist and took responsibility for all the crimes.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Tsk tsk, how unflinching.” The Black Star Army patrol team leader
            tutted.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The dynasty inspection officer finished reading the report, cleared
            his throat, and opened up the comms. “Barton, you ordered others to
            murder, committing horrible sins. Is your goal to deal with the
            dynasty’s inspection?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Barton’s eyes were closed, and he did not reply.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Seeing this, the dynasty inspection officer continued. “I’ll take it
            as that’s what you think. You couldn’t possibly not have known that,
            after doing what you did, the marshals who monitor everything would
            definitely find you. In order to eliminate those so-called stubborn
            people, you were willing to be imprisoned and even held responsible
            for some of your accomplices, basically giving up your life. Is it
            worth it?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Barton shook his head calmly and said, “Here or outside, both are
            prisons. What’s the difference? On this planet, no one’s life is
            valuable. If I can give mine for some hope, of course it’s worth
            it.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “You think you’re very noble, right?” the inspection team leader
            said with a poker face. “I’m the dynasty’s inspector. Frankly, I do
            not like your extreme methods at all. Your motive is too strong. You
            think you can convince the dynasty by doing this? Youngster, don’t
            you think you’ve underestimated us?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Barton’s carapace color shifted slightly and then returned to the
            color of calmness. “This might be the only inspection in my life. I
            only did what I thought was right. No matter the results of the
            inspection, I’ve reduced the source of hate. The number of haters
            born in the future will also be reduced because of it. Even if we
            fail the inspection now, the chance of passing in the future will
            increase. At least what I did was meaningful.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The dynasty inspection team leader was not touched at all. He had
            witnessed too many similar examples, so he was already used to it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He thought for a moment, changed the topic, and asked, “If your
            planet is freed, what do you think your people should do?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Join the Black Star Army.” This time, Barton answered without
            hesitation.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The dynasty inspection team leader narrowed his eyes and asked, “And
            why is that?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Even freed, the Kunde Race still lives in the Black Star Army’s
            territory. In the short term, the Kunde Race still needs the Black
            Star Army’s protection. Our civilization is still too weak. If one
            of us can become an officer of the Black Star Army, the Kunde Race
            will also receive help. Have the Supers work for Black Star and aid
            the entire race, this is the best path for now,” Barton said with a
            deep voice.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Hearing this, the dynasty inspection team could not help but glance
            at the Black Star Army patrol team. He snorted and said, “Looks like
            the promotion you guys did was very effective.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Thank you. The army commander taught us well. Plus, he’s too
            charming.” The army patrol team leader smiled.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The dynasty inspection team leader looked down and pondered for a
            while before writing some remarks on the inspection form and ticking
            off a few things.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    When the inspection team visited all the Kunde Race planets, Han
            Xiao finally received the results.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “A total of seventeen planets reached the standard. The standard is
            even lower than I expected.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao curled his lips. He looked at the list of the planets, and
            Planet No. 77 was on it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Then, he summoned Phillip and said, “Hmm, there’s no problem. Make
            the arrangements according to this list. Have the troops stationed
            at these seventeen planets guide the residents to familiarize with
            galactic society. At the same time, make a recruit announcement.
            Although they’re free, they don’t have anywhere to go, so the
            majority of them will choose to join me…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Also, broadcast the process of freeing these seventeen planets to
            the other planets. Encourage them to accept the transformation
            properly and regain freedom sooner.”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao gave the order. He then looked at the details of the
            inspection and discovered the conversation between the dynasty
            inspection team leader and Barton.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Oh, this kid is interesting.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao raised his brow. He brought up Barton’s information and
            said casually, “Phillip, tell the prison department of Planet No.77
            to let this kid out and have him join the army.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He felt that Barton was a man with dreams and not lazy. Also, Barton
            seemed to have potential. After all, the Kunde Race never had the
            Super system in the past. Barton was in the first batch to learn it,
            and he still became a Grade C at such a young age. His potential
            should be quite high.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, at Han Xiao’s current position, he did not plan to meet him
            personally. He was only picking out a high-quality leek out of
            habit. If Barton could not achieve things in the Black Star Army,
            Han Xiao would not specifically remember him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A few days later, the results of the inspection got approved by the
            dynasty. The Black Star Army acted right away to open up these
            seventeen planets. Billions of Kunde Race members were freed.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    On this day, the screams of joy of countless people shot into the
            sky and echoed through planets. After more than twenty years, they
            were finally free. Be it seniors or youngsters, they were all
            tearing up.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    They still had problems with the dynasty, but most of them had a
            strong sense of appreciation toward the Black Star Army. Not only
            were they thankful for the Black Star Army’s advanced notification
            but also for Black Star avenging the Kunde Race by making Modo
            suffer. There was also the protection the Black Star Army had
            provided them for decades.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Among the Kunde Race, the reputation of the army was at the peak.
            The relationship was firmly at Reverence.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At Sigaia City Prison, Barton walked out the prison door. The
            blinding sunlight almost made him unable to open his eyes. The
            streets were filled with an overjoyed crowd, and loud cheering
            voices came from all directions.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The lifeless city in his impression seemed to have suddenly come
            alive. Barton stood still, stunned.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “You’ve been let out. Now go.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The warden spoke from behind. He had received the message from Black
            Star, so he did not dare ignore it and personally sent Barton out of
            the prison.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Isn’t my crime very horrible? Why have you let me go?” Barton
            turned around. He was both shocked and confused.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    You think I wanted to? While thinking that in his mind, the warden
            gave a stiff smile and said, “Don’t thank me. The army commander
            said to let you go by name. He must believe in your capabilities.
            Work hard, and don’t waste the army commander’s kindness.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Barton’s entire body shivered. The color of disbelief appeared on
            his body.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The news was promoting how strong Black Star was every day. To say
            he did not admire someone that strong would be a lie; Barton simply
            kept this admiration buried in his heart.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He originally wanted to sacrifice himself, so he never expected to
            be released. Plus, he was released by Black Star personally.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Doesn’t this mean Black Star knows who I am?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Suddenly, Barton felt a stream of heat flowing in his body. He was
            feeling tipsy like he had too much to drink. His shell rapidly
            turned into the color of hot red excitement like he was cooked.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Since Black Star… no, since the army commander has so high hopes
            for me, I must live up to it!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At this moment, Barton made a decision.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He would become the army’s officer and prove that Black Star was not
            wrong about him!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He hoped that he could one day stand before Black Star and express
            his appreciation to him face to face.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    …
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Your Excellency Black Star, our inspection is complete. We shall
            get going.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Inside the army commander’s office in Black Star Palace, the dynasty
            inspection team bade farewell respectfully and expressed their
            intention of leaving.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao nodded with a smile and said, “Send my regards to your
            superiors when you get back.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    They nodded and swarmed out, leaving Han Xiao alone in the room.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao opened the interface and looked at the mission list. The
            first requirement, to provide protection when the Kunde Race was
            being culturally transformed, was finally shown as completed.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Only the first batch of the planets are free, and more of them are
            still being culturally transformed. However, since some of the Kunde
            Race have entered galactic society, they’ll take care of their
            people who are still in lockdown in the future. I won’t be the only
            one providing protection.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao smirked. This was him completing his promise; it was
            enough.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I’ve protected you guys for so long. Finally, I can get some
            rewards.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao took a deep breath and chose to conclude the mission on the
            interface.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Notifications popped up one after another on the interface.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
