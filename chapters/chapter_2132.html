<h1>Chapter 2122: Strategy</h1><p>Shi Mu and the others retreated from the Thunder Marsh once more, their initial high spirits replaced by dejection.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Grand Preceptor confronted each other but didn't engage.  However, the Thunder Lords' offensive remained fierce, seizing the opportunity to reap the lives of their enemies.</p><p>Finally, the Grand Preceptor narrowed his eyes slightly, withdrew his gaze, and returned to the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram with the others.</p><p>The azure lightning dissipated.</p><p>The Thunder Lords vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze followed the Grand Preceptor, watching them enter the depths of the landmass, then lingered for a long time.</p><p>Currently, he had three methods to counter the Si You Clan's Shifting Technique: the Sword Heart Sea technique combined with the Thunder Altar, the Void Severing Pagoda, and the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>He chose to deliberately reveal the Five Elements Crown, firstly to pressure the enemy, making them hesitant and allowing this charade to play out longer and more convincingly; secondly, to probe the enemy's trump cards.</p><p>This time, he failed to kill the old man, but he successfully forced out the enemy's escape method.</p><p>It was certain that the old man's escape wasn't due to his own abilities, but related to the Primordial Yellow Light on him, and the Primordial Yellow Light originated from that landmass, which was precisely what Qin Sang was most wary of.</p><p>The Primordial Yellow Light could actually directly transport people away.  When he made a move against the Grand Preceptor in the future, he would have to find a way to suppress this treasure first.</p><p>What puzzled Qin Sang now was whether the old man's escape was due to the one controlling the landmass sensing the old man's danger and rescuing him, or whether the Primordial Yellow Light attached to the old man possessed an inherent ability to seek advantage and avoid harm, activating automatically whenever the old man was in danger.</p><p>Or even, was it the Grand Preceptor who secretly intervened, using the Primordial Yellow Light as a cover?</p><p>The three scenarios demanded completely different countermeasures. Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly before he had investigated thoroughly.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze, glancing back. The exposure of the Azure Roc True Thunder power meant that the Twelve Thunder Lord Talismans were about to be broken. Next, he should prepare the second line of defense.</p><p>…</p><p>The Lu King's Palanquin.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor and other masters gathered together.</p><p>Silence reigned in the hall, the atmosphere somewhat oppressive.</p><p>Shi Mu and the others, invited by the Grand Preceptor to assist, all wore grim expressions, and even the Lu King's confidants didn't look too pleased.</p><p>The Lu King remained impassive, sweeping his gaze across the crowd. He had already learned what happened and knew what they were thinking.</p><p>The Si You Clan's life-saving divine ability was unparalleled. After receiving the talisman message, Shi Mu and the others readily agreed. Firstly, the reward was attractive enough, and they could also build a relationship with the Grand Preceptor; secondly, the Lu family and the royal family had a tacit understanding, and the Yan Mountain Si family wouldn't be able to cause much trouble; most importantly, they were confident that even if they encountered unexpected situations on the battlefield, their own safety was guaranteed.</p><p>However, this battle shattered their confidence. The enemy could counter their Shifting Technique. If it weren't for the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram, Elder Duan Chun would now be a wandering ghost.</p><p>Elder Duan Chun's face was ashen, appearing shaken.</p><p>Even though the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram was incredibly powerful and rescued Elder Duan Chun in time, these top experts only trusted themselves. Who would willingly entrust their lives to others?</p><p>Furthermore, the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram might not be unbreakable. Once the enemy found a method to counter it, and the Shifting Technique also failed, they truly might lose their lives.</p><p>Unlike Si Lu, who was the master of the altar and had a clear understanding of the situation, repeatedly sending out his companion beast solely for harassment, they were the ones assaulting the formation.  They were completely unaware of the situation within the formation.  Sending only their companion beasts to fight while their true bodies hid behind was impractical. Their perception was limited, and their strength would be greatly affected.  Previously, some companion beasts had been carelessly annihilated by Qin Sang. Although they wouldn't completely perish, restoring them to their original state would require a significant price and wouldn't happen overnight.  The loss of one companion beast meant a decrease in the master's strength. If all four companion beasts were lost, any cultivator of the same rank could easily handle them.</p><p>Moreover, the Si You Clan couldn't be compared to true Beast Masters. Many of the clan's superior divine abilities required the true body to cooperate with the companion beast.</p><p>The appearance of the Five Elements Crown made everyone feel apprehensive, and it was inevitable that some would have second thoughts.</p><p>The Lu King observed their expressions.  "That True Person Qin can actually counter our clan's Shifting Technique. We must be careful.  But think of it this way, he doesn't know whether we have the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram.  He revealed that strange treasure, yet none of us were injured! The most dangerous moment has passed.  From now on, as long as everyone remains vigilant and finds a way to resist this treasure, there's no need to fear it!"</p><p>Hearing the Lu King's words, everyone pondered, their spirits lifting slightly.</p><p>Then, the Lu King turned to the silver-armored cultivator.  "Fellow Daoists, you've fought with True Person Qin many times and consumed too much energy.  Go and meditate and recuperate first. Later, I'll ask Mountain Master Mo to lead the army into the formation!"</p><p>The Lu King knew that at this time, he couldn't force these guest elders and could only let his own confidants take the lead.</p><p>The silver-armored cultivator readily agreed, "I accept the command!"</p><p>The Grand Preceptor interjected, "If that True Person Qin wants to continue playing games, we don't need to rush.  Let's break through this first formation barrier! Elder Lu Gan and I will keep an eye on you. Don't worry too much."</p><p>Having finally stabilized the morale, the Grand Preceptor continued to discuss the important matter. "I haven't personally witnessed the kind of azure lightning True Person Qin wields. What are your thoughts?"</p><p>All present were top experts and understood the importance of the situation.  Putting aside their distracting thoughts, they voiced their opinions one after another. After some discussion, as usual, they came up with several strategies to break the formation, and then sent people to test them.</p><p>The previous process began to repeat itself. Both sides countered each other's moves back and forth. The Lu King's side advanced steadily, and Qin Sang didn't use the Five Elements Crown again.</p><p>After more than twenty days, the Twelve Thunder Lord Talismans finally reached their limit, and it was difficult for Qin Sang to use them any further.</p><p>The Lu King's side also noticed this, so Shi Mu and the others mobilized all their forces.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Thunder Lords finally couldn't hold on any longer, abandoning the sky full of thunder and fire, and retreated on their own initiative.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Shi Mu led the cultivators, engulfed in a sea of thunder and fire.</p><p>Except for a few unlucky ones, this thunder and fire no longer posed a threat to them. They could clearly feel the surrounding thunder power rapidly receding.</p><p>In front of the Palanquin.</p><p>The Lu King and the Grand Preceptor stood in the air, gazing at the horizon. They saw the thunder light in the sky gradually dimming, and the lightning becoming sparse.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh finally receded, and the sky and earth there reappeared.  Before long, the figures of Shi Mu and the others also emerged.</p><p>"It has been more than three months since the first assault on the formation," the Lu King sighed.</p><p>The first formation barrier had held them back for more than three months. He didn't know how many more barriers lay ahead.</p><p>Although no Void Realm Second Layer cultivators had fallen, they had lost several companion beasts, and the Nine Gui and other tribes had suffered heavy casualties.  Fortunately, he had brought most of the clan's elite forces, so there was no need to worry about a shortage of manpower for the time being.</p><p>"Your Majesty, don't worry!"</p><p>The Grand Preceptor bowed.  "It can be concluded that True Person Qin has constructed a Thunder Altar, so he must practice thunder arts.  There are myriad thunder arts, but they all follow certain principles. Once we break through the first formation barrier, it will become easier and easier."</p><p>"I hope so."</p><p>The Lu King nodded, gazing into the distance, seeing the Thunder Marsh retreating further and further. "What should we do next?"</p><p>"No rush."</p><p>The Grand Preceptor lowered his head, looking at the ground, flicking his finger. A stream of light sank into the earth.</p><p>A moment later, the land trembled slightly, the tremor transmitted to the earth through the celestial pillars.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>…</p><p>Towering waves surged on the sea surface, their crests even surpassing the landmass created by the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram, forming a terrifying tsunami.</p><p>The earth shook violently, as if it were about to shake the seawater into the sky. Amidst the wind and waves, new mountain peaks emerged from the seabed.</p><p>As the mountain peaks continued to grow taller, the landmass beneath their feet also grew, extending towards the coast.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>…</p><p>One after another, the mountain peaks seamlessly connected with the landmass. Soon, the coastline appeared ahead.</p><p>Beyond the shore lay the territory of the western lands of the Storm Realm.</p><p>It was still desolate here, but with more moisture, it wasn't entirely desert.  It was a gobi, where scattered patches of green could be seen.</p><p>If it weren't for the nearly thousand-year war with the Chang You Clan, the monks of the western lands could have cultivated this land well, potentially transforming it into a fertile and prosperous region.</p><p>Unfortunately, this place was a battlefield and had changed hands several times, remaining desolate until now.</p><p>Finally, the landmass extended to the shore, connecting with the mainland.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Like two continents colliding, the heavens and earth were overturned, and a dense Primordial Yellow Light erupted from the point of connection.</p><p>As the Primordial Yellow Light slightly dimmed, the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram had completely integrated with the mainland. However, the original landmass was now above sea level, like a piece of flying land extending from the western lands.</p><p>The Primordial Yellow Light continuously pulsed, eventually spreading out, engulfing the land of the western lands.</p><p>The subsequent changes in the land astonished everyone.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew across the land, bringing vitality.  Those grass seeds and tree seeds, either buried deep underground, lodged in rock crevices, or inherently weak, might have been dormant for hundreds or even thousands of years due to environmental factors, and would likely never sprout.</p><p>At this moment, they were revitalized. Among the mountains and rocks, tender sprouts emerged from the ground, swaying and striving to grow upwards.</p><p>In an instant, the gobi transformed into a green field, the bare rocky mountains became verdant hills, the tree seeds grew into large trees, and the flowers and grass wove a green carpet, brimming with life.</p><p>A miraculous scene unfolded before their eyes.</p><p>If it were just this, for Void Refinement cultivators who could flip their hands to create clouds and cover them to make rain, it wouldn't be anything special.</p><p>As the landscape changed dramatically, the feeling this land gave off also changed, as if it and the desert on the other side of the field were located in different worlds. This feeling was as if the territory of the western lands had been swallowed by the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram, separating it from the rest of the western lands.</p><p>And that was precisely the case. The enemy retreated a step, and they advanced a step, relying on the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram to consolidate their gains, gradually encroaching on the enemy's territory.</p><p>It wouldn't be so easy for the enemy to reclaim lost ground in the future.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh receded into the desert.  Qin Sang observed these changes, sighing inwardly at the profound foundation of the Si You royal family.  This unnamed treasure was undoubtedly an artifact for conquering territories.</p><p>Fortunately, the Thunder Altar was complete; otherwise, Qin Sang couldn't think of a good countermeasure.</p><p>As the territory expanded, the power of the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram wouldn't be dispersed, and everyone inside would be protected.</p><p>Shi Mu and the others descended from the sky, ordering their tribesmen to rest, while they flew towards the Palanquin.</p><p>The territory of the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram expanded as a whole, and the Palanquin and the mountain peak where Lu Gan resided moved along with it.</p><p>"With this treasure diagram, this battle will be won!"</p><p>The Lu King's spirits were lifted, a flicker of greed flashing in his eyes before being quickly suppressed.</p><p>The royal family's collection was far more than just this Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram.  Unless the Sacred Land underwent a drastic change, and the royal family suffered heavy losses, or even complete annihilation, in the Sacred Land, the several royal clans wouldn't have the chance to challenge the royal family's status.  Past major upheavals within the Si You Clan had all been due to this reason.</p><p>The surprise attack on the Yan Mountain Si family had already aroused the vigilance of the royal family. He didn't want the royal family to turn against the Lu family now.</p><p>When Shi Mu and the others returned, the Grand Preceptor said, "That True Person Qin is probably waiting at the second formation barrier. We might as well leave him hanging for a while. Everyone, go and meditate, conserve your strength."</p><p>Everyone was eager to do so. After some discussion, they dispersed.</p><p>After seeing everyone off, the Grand Preceptor said to the Lu King, "I've had some insights recently.  I'll take this opportunity to visit the North Sea and other regions to observe the other altars."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The Lu King nodded, concerned.  "Be careful on your journey, Grand Preceptor."</p><p>"No worries!"</p><p>The Grand Preceptor smiled confidently, took a step forward, and vanished.</p><p>After the Twelve Thunder Lord Talismans were broken, a long period of calm descended upon the battlefield. Qin Sang didn't know what the enemy was planning and didn't dare to let his guard down.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang's Dharma Body, stationed at the main altar, suddenly felt a premonition and abruptly looked towards the north!</p><p>The North Sea.</p><p>At the edge of the Hidden Sun Realm, within the territory of the Xuan Tian Palace lineage, the Grand Preceptor seemed to have sensed something as well. He hesitated for a moment, then took one last look at the distant mountains, and without setting foot on land, quietly retreated.</p><p>For a period of time after that, Qin Sang frequently felt the emergence of a threat, shifting from the North Sea to the East Sea, then to the Cang Lang Sea, its location erratic.</p><p>The other party must be a top expert, and their identity wasn't hard to guess. It should be the Grand Preceptor personally conducting reconnaissance.</p><p>The first time might have been an accidental exposure by the Grand Preceptor, but the subsequent instances had a provocative undertone.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about this at all. The completion of the Thunder Altar meant he could wield its power to attack any location.</p><p>It was clear that the Grand Preceptor was acting alone, without any helpers.</p><p>Not only was Qin Sang not afraid of the Grand Preceptor's probing, but he was also calculating his chances of success if he were to strike with full force.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn't yet fully grasped the nature of the Primordial Yellow Light. In the end, he decided to give up, allowing the Grand Preceptor to circle the Storm Realm. He would let him roam free for a while longer.</p><p>…</p><p>During this time, both sides remained peaceful.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor returned safely, and the Lu King felt relieved.  He inquired about the findings of the journey.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor pondered. "In my opinion, this Thunder Altar Formation should have a primary and secondary structure.  If True Person Qin has arranged it according to geographical distribution, the most likely scenario is a configuration of one main altar and three auxiliary altars.  The entire western lands can be considered an auxiliary formation!"</p><p>The Lu King's expression shifted slightly. "An auxiliary formation?  In that case, as long as we occupy the western lands, wouldn't we…"</p><p>"Indeed, as long as we destroy that auxiliary altar, a huge flaw will appear in the formation, and the enemy will be close to defeat! We should then press forward step by step, while simultaneously relying on the Boundless Eight Extremes Diagram to gradually encroach upon the western lands, forcing the enemy to reveal the location of that auxiliary altar!"</p><p>The Lu King was overjoyed at these words.  Since the army arrived in the western lands, they finally had a clear objective.</p><p>A few days later, a division under the Lu King entered the desert, commencing a new round of attacks.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>For nearly a year that followed, the western lands were engulfed in flames of war.  The talismans Qin Sang had meticulously prepared were broken one after another, forcing him to retreat repeatedly.</p>
