<h1>Chapter 1290: The Turning Point</h1><p>Qin Sang, Jingyu, Elder Ji from the Heavenly Alliance, and Zang Qing, a trusted confidant of the Nether Demon Lord, were the only four on this journey. The mineral veins they were targeting were of immense value, and the alliance between the two regions placed great importance on them. Qingjun had sent Qin Sang personally, knowing that this was an opportunity to secure a share of the resources, which would greatly benefit the future development of their sect.</p><p>The southern foothills of the Heavenly Plateau had been reclaimed, a feat achieved through the combined efforts of the Heavenly Alliance and the Frost Domain. Qin Sang had always aligned himself with Qingjun, and their interests were something that both the True One Daoist and the Nether Demon Lord had to consider. As the saying goes, "Destruction precedes creation." The spoils of war couldn't simply be returned to their original owners; they had to be distributed based on merit. This was Qin Sang and the Azure Sheep Temple's opportunity.</p><p>Qingjun himself had little interest in these matters, but knowing that Qin Sang wished to establish his own sect, he was doing everything in his power to help him secure the necessary resources.</p><p>"The fragrance of the grasslands... it's been a long time since I last breathed in such refreshing air," Elder Ji remarked, taking a deep breath, his expression tinged with nostalgia.</p><p>Zang Qing chuckled, "Those old Nascent Soul devils are cunning, each one clinging to their lives. But during the chaos of the retreat, the lower-level cultivators of the Sin Abyss didn't have as many means to escape. The casualties were countless. After this battle, the foundation of the Sin Abyss has been shaken, and their losses are nothing short of devastating. They'll be licking their wounds for at least a century, unable to cause any more trouble. In these hundred years, Elder Ji, you can roam the wilderness to your heart's content."</p><p>"Don't laugh at me for saying this, but there was a time when I thought we wouldn't be able to hold Tianxing City, and I'd end up a stray dog," Elder Ji sighed, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding scenery, which felt both familiar and foreign. The war, which had dragged on intermittently for two centuries, had changed too many things.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin," Elder Ji suddenly turned to Qin Sang, "I've heard that several of your disciples are also talented young individuals, yet they call themselves disciples of the Azure Sheep Temple. Are you planning to establish your own sect? Have you decided where to set up the Azure Sheep Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily taken aback by the abrupt question, but then he smiled faintly, "The top spiritual veins in the North Star Realm are all claimed. I may have the desire to establish a sect, but I lack the means."</p><p>"What's so difficult about that?" Elder Ji's eyes lit up. "Fellow Daoist Qin, you personally reclaimed the southern foothills of the Heavenly Plateau. You must have noticed that there are several top-tier spiritual veins there. Some of the sects that were originally built on those veins were driven out by the Sin Abyss, and the most heartbreaking part is that some were slaughtered by the Sin Abyss, nearly wiped out. If you're interested, I can report this matter to the Daoist Master. Your meritorious deeds are immense, and a single spiritual vein is nothing compared to your contributions. If there are any survivors from those sects, I can mediate on your behalf. The cultivators of the Heavenly Alliance are all righteous and understanding. As long as you agree to take care of them in the future or even take them in as disciples, they would be more than willing."</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Ji subtly glanced at Jingyu out of the corner of his eye. The alliance between the two regions was already aware of Jingyu's origins. This demon king's strength was equally unfathomable, and he had a fearsome reputation during his seclusion in the Boundless Valley. What shocked them was that, from the Battle of Twin Mirror Mountain to the present, Jingyu had almost always been by Qin Sang's side, following his lead as if he were his subordinate.</p><p>It was worth noting that after the alliance's counterattack, the Feather King had ordered the Heavenly Demon Hills to withdraw their troops and remain neutral. Despite the alliance's promises of great benefits, not a single demon king had been persuaded to join. This led to widespread speculation about the nature of their relationship.</p><p>Qin Sang's close ties with Qingjun were well-known. Dongyang Bo had even publicly revealed that the mysterious beauty Chenyan, who had appeared briefly in the past, seemed to have deep entanglements with Qin Sang. Given this, some envious gossips speculated that Qin Sang's charm was so great that even female demons were captivated by him. The bolder ones suspected that Jingyu had been subdued by Qin Sang and turned into a spirit beast. The more reasonable ones, recalling the Battle of the Blood Lake, believed that Jingyu's actions were motivated by a desire to repay a debt of gratitude.</p><p>Regardless, it was clear that their relationship was deep. If they could persuade Qin Sang to establish his sect on the Heavenly Plateau, they wouldn't just be gaining Qin Sang—they'd be gaining Jingyu as well.</p><p>"All the fellow Daoists in our Heavenly Alliance warmly welcome Fellow Daoist Qin," Elder Ji said, his words carrying a hidden meaning.</p><p>Seeing Elder Ji openly trying to recruit Qin Sang in front of him, Zang Qing's expression stiffened, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of anger. Unfortunately, the enmity between Dongyang Bo and Qin Sang was irreconcilable, leaving an opening for others to exploit.</p><p>Zang Qing snorted coldly, "The Sin Abyss is ambitious. One day, they will surely return. The Heavenly Plateau isn't a good choice—it carries the risk of being dragged into war. Although the Frost Domain is smaller, it can easily accommodate the Azure Sheep Temple, and the temple can work closely with the Illusion Mist Sect. Some sects, though they inherit the legacy of their ancestors, are already rotten at the core, contributing nothing in the great war. Rare treasures belong to the virtuous, and spiritual veins are no exception!"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to be playing hard to get, not committing to anything and skillfully deflecting the question.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's evasiveness, Elder Ji changed his tone and turned to the杀气腾腾的藏情, speaking calmly, "Fellow Daoist Zang Qing, what do you think about the future situation? Is it still necessary for the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance to remain separate, drawing clear lines between each other?"</p><p>Zang Qing was momentarily stunned, then fell into deep thought.</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly surprised. "Is this the Daoist Master's intention?"</p><p>Elder Ji neither confirmed nor denied, continuing on his own, "The Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance were originally one. Later, due to various reasons, they split, creating a rift that eventually turned into mutual hostility. Over the years, as we joined forces to fight against the Sin Abyss, our shared hatred brought us together. The cultivators of both regions have worked closely and are now familiar with each other. This is the best time to resolve our grievances. I've had this idea for a long time, but with the urgency of the war, I kept it to myself."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. This matter was of great significance, and it wasn't his place to comment. He would need to discuss it with his senior sister. However, if the two regions were to merge and set aside their differences, their combined strength would undoubtedly increase, making them more capable of facing the Sin Abyss. His senior sister would likely be pleased with such an outcome.</p><p>At this moment, Zang Qing let out a cold laugh. "Elder Ji, you make it sound so easy. If the two regions merge, your Heavenly Alliance would effortlessly gain a share of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. What do we get out of it? And in the future, would the Heavenly Alliance follow the Frost Domain, or would the Frost Domain follow the Heavenly Alliance?"</p><p>Facing the质问, Elder Ji remained composed. "These are all things that can be discussed! I believe that as long as everyone is willing, we can come up with a plan that satisfies all parties."</p><p>After that, Zang Qing fell silent, and Elder Ji didn't press further.</p><p>As they spoke, the group had already traveled several thousand miles across the wilderness.</p><p>Suddenly, the white clouds came to a halt in mid-air. Elder Ji took out a map, compared it, and pointed to the northeast. "Not far ahead is the Secret Glowstone Mine, second in value only to the largest spirit stone mine. The Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss guarding the mine is a cunning one, with multiple hideouts. Even our spies haven't been able to locate his main residence. Everyone, be prepared. We might just have the chance to ambush him here!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The group summoned their magical treasures and quietly left the cloud formation, their figures flickering as they disappeared into the shadows.</p>
