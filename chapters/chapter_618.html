<h1>Chapter 611: Unwavering Spirit!</h1><p>Chapter 611: Unwavering Spirit!</p><p>“If you are bound by so-called chastity and morality, Miss, you needn’t be. Those are mere mortal virtues, meant to maintain worldly order. To us Yuan Ying cultivators, anything below Yuan Ying is as insignificant as ants.  We’re considered good people if we don’t casually slaughter cities and destroy nations. If you can’t even grasp this, your cultivation has been in vain.”</p><p>Dongyang Bo used coercion and enticement, his methods expert, confident that Chen Yan would compromise to save her master.</p><p>Then, Chen Yan suddenly saw Qin Sang's eyes. Like a lightning bolt, they pierced her heart, causing her to freeze.</p><p>What kind of look was that?</p><p>It seemed to be questioning her.</p><p>When faced with threat and desperation, do you surrender and compromise, or seize even a sliver of chance, fighting relentlessly, never yielding?</p><p>The next moment, a bloody sword light bloomed from the bronze hall, brighter than the blood bead in Chen Yan's hand, a shocking crimson, yet with a hint of tragic beauty and sorrow!</p><p>Qin Sang, who should have been sealed by the talisman, rendered powerless,</p><p>had a small flying sword emerge from his Baihui acupoint, flying straight towards the King Kong Zhuo.</p><p>The King Kong Zhuo was Dongyang Bo's life-bound treasure, his constant companion, refined day and night. Among high-grade treasures, it was exceptional.</p><p>Compared to the King Kong Zhuo, this sword was weak and insignificant.</p><p>But the bloody light from the sword caused even Dongyang Bo to change color!</p><p>“Blood Pollution Radiance!”</p><p>To prevent Qin Sang from being taken by Chen Yan, Dongyang Bo used the King Kong Zhuo to seal him, leaving almost no space between them.  Qin Sang’s sudden attack caught even Dongyang Bo off guard, leaving him no time to retrieve his treasure!</p><p>The Blood Pollution Radiance technique could only be used once in the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>During the Zuìyuán ambush, Leng Yuntian's treasure was severely damaged, allowing Qin Sang to save this Blood Pollution Radiance. In subsequent battles, he faced either powerful demons or vengeful spirits.</p><p>The Blood Pollution Radiance remained unused until now, becoming Qin Sang's lifeline.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's talisman was powerful, completely restraining Qin Sang's physical body. He had secretly tried countless times, unable to shake the talisman's power.</p><p>But his soul was protected by the jade Buddha, rendering the talisman ineffective; he could still use the ebony sword!</p><p>His meridians and energy sea were sealed, his spiritual energy restrained, even his false elixer core unresponsive. But the killing talisman on the ebony sword was a unique kind of dantian, able to absorb Heaven and Earth's spiritual energy, providing the energy Qin Sang needed to control his sword.</p><p>Furthermore, his consciousness was unrestricted.</p><p>Qin Sang had been waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Ideally, Qin Sang planned to escape during the chaos of a fight between Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan.</p><p>But when Dongyang Bo brought out the *Stone Bridge Zen*, Qin Sang knew he couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>Dongyang Bo saw him as an ant, and Chen Yan was his only hope. If Chen Yan truly accepted the *Stone Bridge Zen* and agreed to the deal, escape would become impossible.</p><p>He couldn’t give Chen Yan time to think. He had to gamble.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang glanced at Chen Yan, asking her: What choice will you make?</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The King Kong Zhuo was engulfed in blood.</p><p>The ebony sword’s Blood Pollution Radiance wasn’t powerful enough to destroy the King Kong Zhuo, but its polluting power temporarily hampered Dongyang Bo's control.</p><p>Touched by the Blood Pollution Radiance, the King Kong Zhuo’s light dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the restraint on his body finally lift.  His eyes met Chen Yan’s in a fleeting exchange, then he soared into the air, fleeing the bronze hall without looking back.</p><p>Stunned by Qin Sang's determination, Chen Yan finally reacted.</p><p>She hadn't expected Qin Sang to find a way to free himself, but this didn’t guarantee his survival. His fate was now linked to her choice.</p><p>How should she choose?</p><p>Chen Yan had little time to think, but she didn't hesitate.  Without a second thought, she raised her phoenix-shaped sword and fiercely lunged at Dongyang Bo.</p><p>In the ancient bronze hall, a fierce battle erupted!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang burst from the hall. Sensing the change behind him, he felt relieved – Chen Yan hadn't disappointed him.</p><p>Simultaneously, a map appeared in Qin Sang's mind—Chen Yan's guidance, showing him how to escape via a secret passage.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist.  Escaping was his biggest worry, and Chen Yan had solved it for him.</p><p>Though knowing Chen Yan acted to remove the threat of Dongyang Bo’s coercion from herself, Qin Sang silently thanked her in his heart.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang unleashed the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, using all his strength, flying towards the exit of the floor.</p><p>His speed was incredible; a boundless black aura receded behind him.  He was almost at the exit when a furious roar echoed from within the bronze hall: “Kill him! Tear him to pieces!”  This was Dongyang Bo.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang vaguely saw Mu Yifeng and the others.</p><p>Mu Yifeng, Ji Qing, and Yu Wanshan stood there, faces etched with shock, staring at the scene. Only Qiu Mu Bai, his energy depleted, looked weak and breathless.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart clenched.  Even in battle, Dongyang Bo hadn't forgotten to order Mu Yifeng and the others to kill him!</p><p>Surrounded.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth and pressed on.</p><p>The four exchanged glances, the order echoing in their ears.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was the first to attack!</p><p>At Dongyang Bo's command, Mu Yifeng's gaze hardened. Without hesitation, he summoned the Nine-Flame Divine Blade, pointing it at Qin Sang, leading the charge.</p><p>A chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>On Shao Hua Mountain, Mu Yifeng had been one of his closest brothers; he had even saved Mu Yifeng's life.</p><p>Yet, Mu Yifeng attacked without a second thought.</p><p>For a moment, the gazes of these former friends met. Seeing Mu Yifeng's eyes, Qin Sang paused, startled.</p><p>The next instant, the Ebony Sword and the Nine-Flame Divine Blade clashed. The Nine-Flame Divine Blade shattered!</p><p>“My treasure!” Mu Yifeng cried out in terror, his defenses breached.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had refined his Nine-Flame Divine Blade for a century, making it far superior to other artifacts.  The Ebony Sword, even in its power, couldn't have shattered it so easily.</p><p>Mu Yifeng had secretly destroyed his most trusted weapon, making it appear as if Qin Sang had defeated him.</p><p>This artifact, which Mu Yifeng valued more than his own life, intended as his life-bound treasure after his breakthrough, was destroyed by his own hand.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng could only communicate through their eyes. Mu Yifeng's gaze urged, bid farewell, and offered blessing.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was about to pierce Mu Yifeng's chest. Qin Sang gritted his teeth, but didn't hold back; he knew that the more ruthless he was, the better Mu Yifeng's chance of survival.</p><p>He couldn't betray Mu Yifeng's sacrifice!</p><p>With a ‘噗!’ sound, the Ebony Sword pierced Mu Yifeng's left chest, injuring his heart. But at the last moment, Qin Sang subtly deflected the sword energy, avoiding a fatal blow.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was flung away like a rag doll, colliding with Ji Qing.</p><p>Ji Qing and Yu Wanshan were both startled.  Mu Yifeng was no match for Qin Sang, leaving them uncertain. Ji Qing frantically caught Mu Yifeng, finding him still alive, quickly giving him a restorative pill.</p><p>Yu Wanshan hesitated, but it was too late to attack Qin Sang.</p><p>The Ebony Sword easily deflected Yu Wanshan's weapon.  Qin Sang, like an arrow from a bow, dashed toward the exit, disappearing from their sight.  By the time Yu Wanshan and Ji Qing got outside, even the sword's gleam was gone.</p><p>The Black Tower was vast.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare stop, pushing through layer after layer, finally bursting out of the tower.</p><p>He could only trust Chen Yan, discerning his direction and fleeing.</p><p>Following Chen Yan's guidance, he navigated ancient halls, unsealed walls, entered hidden passages, passed through a path of malevolent spirits, and reached the bottom of a small lake.</p><p>As expected, it was an exit only, no entry. Qin Sang leaped upward, breaking through the barrier and emerging into the lake.</p><p>Swimming to the surface, he flew out of the lake and raced towards the Tian Shan mountains.</p><p>There were no pursuers.  Chen Yan had indeed held Dongyang Bo back.</p><p>Once he'd escaped the Tian Shan, Qin Sang paused, glancing back, suddenly overwhelmed by uncertainty.</p><p>The world stretched vast before him, and he didn't know where to go.</p><p>He had spent almost a hundred years on Shao Hua Mountain, developing some attachment, but he could never return.</p><p>He couldn't even return to Xiao Han.</p><p>Chen Yan could hold off Dongyang Bo, but Qin Sang didn't believe Chen Yan could kill him. After all, Chen Yan had only recently broken through to Yuan Ying stage. If anyone were to die, it would more likely be Chen Yan.</p><p>The most likely scenario was a compromise, a truce.</p><p>Soon, both Chen Yan and Dongyang Bo would be searching for him with all their might. If Chen Yan chose to cultivate the *Stone Bridge Zen*, it would be even more dangerous.</p><p>Until then, he had nowhere to hide.</p><p>With these thoughts racing through his mind, Qin Sang still didn't dare stop, his sword flying at full speed.</p><p>Arriving before Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang looked up.</p><p>If Yun Youzi had emerged from seclusion, he could have asked for advice. But the mountain was quiet, Yun Youzi nowhere to be seen, likely still recovering.</p><p>He couldn't wait.</p><p>Qin Sang flew over Sword Scar Mountain, not even daring to leave a mark for Yun Youzi, fearing it might implicate him.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang arrived at the cliff face, opened the door in the stone wall, and entered the ancient Jianjing Temple. The ancient teleportation array inside was the only escape route Qin Sang could think of.</p><p>Years ago, Qingzhu was pursued by a Yuan Ying cultivator and was forced to flee.  Now, Qin Sang found himself repeating Qingzhu's story.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the ancient teleportation array, his expression shifting.</p><p>To stay meant certain death.  The other side might be more dangerous, but there might be a chance of survival.  The choice was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang took out eight medium-grade spirit stones, repeating the process, placing them into the eight corners of the array.  Seeing the array glow brightly, Qin Sang turned towards the outside of Ziwei Palace, in the direction of Xiaohan Region.</p><p>His expression changed, his gaze profound.  He had spent over a hundred years in Xiaohan Region. Now, he realized he was merely a visitor, a century having passed.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sharp cracking sound broke Qin Sang's thoughts. He turned to see that one of the medium-grade spirit stones on the array was covered in cracks, its spiritual energy nearly depleted. The array shone brilliantly, yet remained unactivated, as if something was missing.</p><p>Qin Sang's face fell, despair rising in his heart. Could it be that Elder Qingzhu had destroyed the teleportation array on the other side?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something and quickly retrieved a high-grade spirit stone from his Qianjun Ring.  Unsealing it, he didn't have time to appreciate its refined spiritual energy.  He replaced the cracked stone with it, and the ancient teleportation array reacted.</p><p>Then, another medium-grade spirit stone shattered, and the array stopped again.</p><p>Qin Sang's face twitched in pain. He took out another high-grade spirit stone, placing it in, praying there wouldn't be any more.  He only had four high-grade stones left.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was shocked. The ancient teleportation array in the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace could transport many people using only eight medium-grade spirit stones. This array, capable of only transporting one or two people, required high-grade spirit stones, and more than one at that!</p><p>Where would it lead?</p><p>"Hummm..."</p><p>The altar vibrated. The array's light illuminated the temple like daylight, and an unprecedented surge of spiritual energy erupted from its center.  The array activated!</p><p>Qin Sang resolutely stepped onto it.  Darkness instantly enveloped him, followed by overwhelming pressure from all sides.</p><p>Qin Sang was terrified. He used all his remaining spiritual sense to resist, but it was soon exhausted, bringing excruciating pain and unconsciousness.</p><p>(Volume 1: The Mortal World — Complete)</p><p>(Volume 2: The Ends of the Earth — Coming Soon)</p><p>(I haven't rested since I decided to write this book.
