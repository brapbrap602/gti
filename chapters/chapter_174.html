<h1>## Chapter 167: Natal Sword Damaged</h1><p>Unexpectedly, before Wu Yuesheng could catch his breath, something happened.</p><p>Watching the corpse poison being completely burned up, there was suddenly a loud explosion and an evil spirit energy was hiding inside, suddenly exploding, piercing through Red Flame Sword's spiritual light.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's face changed greatly and hurriedly recalled the spirit sword, only to see that although Red Flame Sword's sword body did not really crack, its spirituality was inevitably damaged and its sword light was much dimmer than before. His face showed a strong pain and anger.</p><p>Natal Spirit Sword is a tool for Sword Cultivators to communicate with, once it is damaged, it cannot move easily and its power is weakened. Although Red Flame Sword is not really damaged, its damaged spirituality requires Wu Yuesheng to warm it for a long time to recover, not to mention it delays cultivation time, but it is also a great consumption of energy.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang was secretly astonished and did not hesitate to fully stimulate the power of the Five Elements Sword, the vast spiritual power enveloped the Spirit Sword's body, leaving no chance for the zombie.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng's Red Flame Sword was nearly destroyed, the quality of the Five Elements Sword is far less than the Red Flame Sword, if it were hit by the ghost claws, let alone being corroded by corpse poison, it might be cut off.</p><p>"Damn evil corpse!"</p><p>Wu Yuesheng was furious and cursed, he did not dare to use the Red Flame Sword again, and hurriedly put it away into his dantian to warm it, and took out another spirit sword from the storage bag.</p><p>Because of the damage to Wu Yuesheng's spirit sword, their formation was easily broken by the zombie.</p><p>The zombie had suffered a loss, so it was difficult to lure him into the trap again.</p><p>His escape art was too strange, he appeared and disappeared in the hall, they had to protect themself, and be alert to the sneak attack of the zombie, and they also had to be distracted to control Dharma, and try to force the zombie to one place.</p><p>In this stalemate for a long time, they were unable to trap the zombie, they could only continuously attack the Mysterious Yellow Armor on the zombie's body, exhausting the evil spirit energy on the zombie as much as possible, but most of them were dodged by the zombie, with little effect.</p><p>However, after the initial panic, they gradually discovered some clues. After a great battle, apart from the Mysterious Yellow Armor and ghostly escape technique, this zombie had never used any other spells.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng previously speculated whether the zombie would use the Faqi, even though it was a joke, they also tried it cautiously, and they confirmed that apart from the nails that are comparable to Faqi in sharpness, the zombie had no other means.</p><p>This zombie was born with spiritual wisdom, but it was a single skill, and no matter how powerful the escape technique was, it was just an escape technique. As long as they were careful and did not give it a chance, it was fine.</p><p>If it were somewhere else, after consuming the evil spirit energy on the zombie's body in this way, making it unable to use Mysterious Yellow Armor, it could be easily killed.</p><p>But there is another crisis that can't wait, but it's not time to take it slowly.</p><p>After failing to take down the zombie for a long time, Qin Sang was considering sacrificing the Ebony Sword, when he saw Bai Yunshan's expression gradually becoming impatient, he took out his Trapping Heaven Bag magic tool, and shouted loudly: "Do you have any means to temporarily trap this beast? My magic tool is called Trapping Heaven Bag, and its strongest ability is to trap enemies. As long as we can use the Trapping Heaven Bag to lock it, this beast can't use the escape technique and has nowhere to escape, then we can do whatever we want with it. But we need to prepare in advance, please give me some time."</p><p>Qin Sang previously saw that Bai Yunshan used the Trapping Heaven Bag to pass through the wind barrier, and blocked the zombie's sneak attack, he thought it was a pure defensive Faqi, he did not expect it to have such an effect, as expected of his best Faqi.</p><p>Hearing Bai Yunshan's words, Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng naturally would not refuse, they agreed at the same time and their offensive strategy changed immediately.</p><p>Their figures flashed and they stood between the zombie and Bai Yunshan, using their Dharma to attack the zombie with all their strength, Bai Yunshan nodded when he saw this, sat on the spot, sacrificed the Trapping Heaven Bag, closed his eyes slightly and muttered.</p><p>The Trapping Heaven Bag originally looked like a dusty cloth bag, but as spiritual power surged into it, its shape changed.</p><p>The cloth bag automatically flew into the air, facing the wind, with the opening pointing at the zombie. Suddenly a strong wind blew, and the blue shaped wind flew out of the Trapping Heaven Bag, like blue fish swimming in the void. The scene was beautiful and finally, a wind formation in the shape of Bagua gradually formed at the position of the bag opening.</p><p>The soul-devouring corpse instinctively felt the threat from the Inversion Bowl and fixed its blood-red eyes on Baiyun, its face taking on a malevolent look. It let out a roar and abruptly vanished from its spot.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng urged his spiritual sword to release a few sword Qi with a series of swishes; however, they all missed and he hurriedly called out, “Fellow Disciple Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang realised that the soul-devouring corpse was charging towards his direction, so he swept out his Five Elements Law Breaking Sword. As expected, the soul-devouring corpse’s silhouette appeared, attempting to sneak past him to attack Baiyun.</p><p>Baiyun was at a crucial moment in refining the Inversion Bowl, so the soul-devouring corpse could not be allowed to interrupt him. Qin Sang did not hesitate to lift his left hand and throw out a few spiritual talismans that he had concealed in his palm.</p><p>These spiritual talismans were all of the earth attribute. They could condense earth attribute spiritual force and turn into earth walls, earth shields and other objects to protect oneself or block an enemy’s path.</p><p>After leaving Qin Sang’s palm, the spiritual talismans broke apart one after another and, guided by his divine sense, their power descended in front of the soul-devouring corpse. In the blink of an eye, thick earth walls rose from the ground, forming a barrier between the soul-devouring corpse and Baiyun.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The soul-devouring corpse appeared and tore a hole in one of the earth walls with a swipe of its claws, displaying incredible brutality.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a tight grip on the remaining spiritual talismans, denying Sun De the chance to use them. These talismans were all created using Qi Condensation Stage magic spells, so they proved somewhat ineffective against the soul-devouring corpse that rivalled Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators.</p><p>However, it was enough to block the soul-devouring corpse for an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed with his finger and guided the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword to stab towards the soul-devouring corpse with sword Qi, sending it stumbling. This gave Baiyun time to dodge.</p><p>Baiyun had been keeping an eye on the battle and upon seeing this opportunity, he continued refining the Inversion Bowl, maintaining his posture without changing. His figure floated back and distanced itself from the soul-devouring corpse.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wu Yuesheng took an object resembling a green vine out from his ring. When he directed it at the soul-devouring corpse, it shot out towards it like a serpent.</p><p>Just then, the soul-devouring corpse had only just gotten up from the ground when the vine suddenly lashed out and lashed at it with such force that it forced the soul-devouring corpse back several steps, putting more distance between itself and Baiyun.</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng worked together to seal the corpse, not intending to harm it but simply to obstruct it. Every time, they managed to force it back in the nick of time. The soul-devouring corpse tried to break through their defences but all its attempts proved futile.</p><p>After some time, Baiyun finally finished refining the Inversion Bowl. He stood up, glared at the soul-devouring corpse and urged the Inversion Bowl to envelop it. At the same time, he shouted, “Fellow Daoists, restrain it quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Wu Yuesheng immediately moved to the sides.</p><p>At the same time, Wu Yuesheng let out a soft shout and his vine released a blinding green light. It then shot out a series of translucent projections that bound the soul-devouring corpse tightly.</p><p>Not wanting to fall behind, Qin Sang flipped his palm and threw out a few spiritual talismans for trapping enemies.</p>
