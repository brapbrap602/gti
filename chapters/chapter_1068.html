<h1>Chapter 1060: Searching for the Corpse</h1><p>The secluded valley was actually crisscrossed by streams.</p><p>There were also traces of waterfalls scouring the mountain.</p><p>Without exception, all were dry.</p><p>Only here, the lake was abundant, its surface like a mirror.</p><p>The lakeside was lush with trees, all turned into a stone forest.  There wasn't a single normal plant. The stone forest's reflection in the lake looked very strange.</p><p>"The Spirit-Subduing Region has poisonous pools, containing terrifyingly toxic water, and not just one.  I suspect the poison drifting in the secluded valley originates from these pools."</p><p>The armored brute's expression was grave, his heart hesitant. The secret technique guided them to enter the poisonous pool to search for the corpse.</p><p>"Have the human race ever explored what lies beneath the poisonous pools?"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stared at the lake bottom, only darkness, the poisonous pool unfathomably deep.</p><p>The armored brute shook his head, "These are true secrets, almost impossible to leak…"</p><p>"It seems we have no choice but to investigate personally."</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's golden armor vibrated, layer upon layer of golden light merging into it, making the armor several times thicker than before, completely enveloping him.</p><p>Even facing the poisonous pool, the Jiao Dragon King didn't dare to be careless.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King jumped into the lake, his golden armor submerged in the toxic liquid.</p><p>‘Hiss… hiss…’</p><p>Under the fierce toxin's erosion, the golden armor quickly became pitted and scarred, layer upon layer of golden light extinguishing. The virulence of the liquid far surpassed the poison in the void.</p><p>The armored brute also jumped in. The Xuanwu shadow on his carapace quickly inhaled and exhaled, barely keeping pace with the erosion of the toxic liquid.</p><p>The two demons dared not delay, quickly diving down.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the poisonous pool was far deeper than imagined.  They couldn't reach the bottom even after diving for a long time.  Moreover, the space at the bottom of the lake was extremely vast. After some exploration, they reached an edge, discovering that more dark rivers extended outwards, forming a complex network.</p><p>The entire underground Spirit-Subduing Region was likely a crisscrossing network of poisonous rivers, connecting countless poisonous pools.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The two demons leaped out of the water.</p><p>The situation was tricky. They had to delve deep underground to retrieve the dragon corpse, enduring the erosion of the toxic liquid for a long time. Fortunately, they hadn't encountered any ferocious beasts or other dangers underwater.</p><p>After discussing, they decided to take turns resisting the virulent poison. With the secret technique guiding them, and the target clear, they should be able to manage it.</p><p>After a brief rest, they walked to the shore. The Jiao Dragon King removed his golden armor, while the armored brute expanded a protective shield, enveloping both of them, before re-entering the poisonous pool.</p><p>This time, following the secret technique's guidance, they quickly entered a dark river, navigating the complex network of waterways, constantly changing direction.</p><p>They took turns using their abilities along the way.</p><p>After penetrating deep underground for an unknown distance, the two demons were short of breath, increasingly struggling to resist the poisonous water.</p><p>The poisonous river not only eroded their bodies but also their consciousness. The underground water system was incredibly complex, entirely composed of poisonous water. Without the dragon corpse's guidance, even with their cultivation, they wouldn't have been able to reach this place.</p><p>Then, they passed through a dark river.</p><p>At the end of the dark river was a vast underground poisonous lake. At the bottom of the lake was a large stone. Lifting the stone, they found a square stone door!</p><p>The stone door had long since merged with the riverbed.</p><p>Without careful observation, it was easy to overlook.</p><p>The secret technique pointed directly to the area behind the stone door!</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>The two demons rejoiced.</p><p>Approaching the stone door, the Jiao Dragon King gently pushed it, but it remained motionless, its surface seeming to flash with a faint light.</p><p>Seeing this, the two demons exchanged glances and said in unison: "There's a restriction!"</p><p>"Friend, focus on breaking the restriction; don't worry about the poisonous liquid. I can hold out for a while longer."</p><p>The armored brute's eyes shone brightly. The dragon corpse was likely inside the stone door.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King concentrated on sensing the restriction, repeatedly attempting to break it, but without progress, causing the armored brute to become somewhat anxious. At this moment, the Jiao Dragon King's face lit up with surprise, "It's an ancient demon race restriction!"</p><p>"What? It's not a human restriction?"</p><p>The armored brute was incredibly surprised.</p><p>"The ancient restriction is intact, its power still very strong. If it were a human ancient restriction, we would likely have no hope of breaking it and would have to return empty-handed. Since it's a demon race ancient restriction, the dragon corpse should rightfully be ours!"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King laughed heartily.</p><p>…</p><p>In an unknown underground cavern.</p><p>A group of Wu tribe cultivators emerged from a teleportation array, immediately taking protective measures.  Everyone was unharmed. They instantly formed a battle formation, vigilantly observing their surroundings, discovering that they had been teleported underground.</p><p>The teleportation array was located inside an underground cavern. Below it was a square stone platform; nothing else was present.</p><p>The cavern didn't appear to be artificially excavated. The rock was exposed, rough and uneven, and the space was irregular, showing no traces of tools.</p><p>There were no stone pillars, Wu arrays, or restrictions.</p><p>The cavern was deathly silent, as if no one had entered for a very long time.</p><p>This greatly surprised everyone. They had expected to be teleported to a Wu tribe ruin, but instead found themselves in such a place.</p><p>A passage opened into a narrow tunnel, ending in complete darkness from which the sound of running water faintly echoed.</p><p>After a brief discussion,  Elder Fang led the way.</p><p>After a short distance, they reached the tunnel's end and discovered a well filled with water, appearing to be the entrance to an underground river.</p><p>A Witch Cultivator at the Yuan Ying stage launched a burst of spiritual energy into the water, which visibly dissolved before their eyes.</p><p>"It's a poisonous river!" someone exclaimed, startled.  "The poison is incredibly potent!"</p><p>"Why would our ancestors' teleportation array lead to a dead end? Should we go and see where we are?" someone suggested, looking up.</p><p>"No!" the High Priestess firmly refused, her expression thoughtful. "I know where we are.  Within the幽谷 (Yougu Valley), there's only one place called the Zhenling Domain with a poisonous pool. This river is connected to that pool, so we must be near the Zhenling Domain. The Zhenling Domain is one of the most important hidden realms guarded by the human race; we mustn't act rashly."</p><p>"Zhenling Domain?"</p><p>Seeing the High Priestess's grave expression, the Yuan Ying cultivators dared not act independently.</p><p>"How much do you know about the Zhenling Domain?" Elder Fang suddenly asked.</p><p>"Not much," the High Priestess sighed. "The human race keeps these realms extremely secret. I've only found a few ambiguous pieces of information. It's said that the Zhenling Domain possesses a unique power, only accessible to those at the late or peak mid-Yuan Ying stage."</p><p>"So only the High Priestess and Elder Fang can enter?"</p><p>The Yuan Ying cultivators stirred.  One said, "We haven't felt anything unusual. The rumors might be wrong. Let's all go down and explore. If we encounter any obstacles, we can retreat."</p><p>"Very well…"</p><p>The High Priestess offered no objection.</p><p>Upon entering, they discovered the river's poison was extremely potent and were forced to retreat after a short time.</p><p>The situation underground was unclear, with the river branching out.  For safety, they took turns exploring after making preparations.</p><p>After repeated explorations, they found that all branches of the river led to a large underground lake.</p><p>Elder Fang and several Yuan Ying cultivators entered the poisonous lake. Shortly after, they felt an unusual energy wave, followed by a scream.</p><p>Without looking back, Elder Fang confirmed the wave didn't affect him and approached the source.</p><p>Within the poisonous lake, they were suddenly suppressed by the Zhenling Domain's power.  A Witch Cultivator at the Yuan Ying stage, caught off guard, was unable to resist the poisonous water and was instantly corroded, leaving only their Yuan Ying spirit, which Elder Fang managed to save.</p><p>The others could only protect themselves, each sustaining injuries.</p>
