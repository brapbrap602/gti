<h1>Chapter 430:  A Coup</h1><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>The bloodied man finally awoke.  The woman in court dress had only aimed to forcibly suppress his injuries and rouse him to learn what happened.</p><p>His injuries were severe; recovery this quickly was impossible. Though awake, he remained extremely weak, as if he would cough out his heart, liver, and lungs, like a dying mortal.</p><p>It was unclear what secret method the woman in court dress used, but after reviving the bloodied man, her own breathing became ragged, clearly indicating significant energy depletion.</p><p>The guards helped the severely weakened woman to her feet before attending to the bloodied man, cleaning the blood from his body.</p><p>A faint spiritual energy swept over him, washing away the blood and revealing his face.  Beneath the gore was the face of a man in his forties. He must have been quite fat, but his left cheek was completely slashed, revealing jagged teeth.  Furthermore, a long gash ran across his nose, nearly splitting his head in two.  The cut was dangerously close to his eyes, and a little higher, and he would have lost them.</p><p>The two wounds were horrifying, making his appearance terrifying. The onlookers gasped.</p><p>Previously, fearing they would interfere with the woman's rescue efforts, no one dared use their spiritual sense or energy to examine the bloodied man. Now seeing his face, someone in the crowd cried out:</p><p>“Brother Liu, is that you?”</p><p>A figure then dashed from the crowd to the man's side.  Someone immediately recognized him.</p><p>“That’s Qiao Jiang from the Xu Ling Sect!”</p><p>“He’s a disciple of the Xu Ling Sect!  How did he end up like this?”</p><p>Qiao Jiang pushed aside the guards and gently helped the man up.  “Brother Liu, I’m Qiao Jiang. We met on Di Xuan Mountain. Do you remember?”</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of Di Xuan Mountain in the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>Within the sect lies a peculiar mountain, Di Xuan Mountain, said to not be on the surface but hidden deep underground – a mountain within a mountain.  The Xu Ling Sect possesses the largest underground fire vein in the Small Cold Domain, running beneath their sect.</p><p>This fire vein is unique.  It converges beneath the sect’s mountain gate, with the entire area excavated to reveal a peculiar small mountain suspended within the void above the vein.</p><p>This mountain hangs suspended, neither touching the earth nor the sky, constantly subjected to the intense heat of the vein.  After countless years of refinement, the mountain’s stones transformed, creating a unique flame resembling earth fire but far superior in power.</p><p>This flame is said to refine magical artifacts. Xu Ling Sect’s Golden Core cultivators use the Di Xuan Mountain fire to reduce the consumption of their own inner fire when refining.</p><p>The sect excels at artifact refinement, all thanks to this unique flame. Di Xuan Mountain is considered the foundation of the Xu Ling Sect!</p><p>The jade slip Wu the shopkeeper gave Qin Sang detailed the process of a Golden Core cultivator refining artifacts using the Di Xuan Mountain fire.</p><p>“Brother Qiao…”</p><p>The man finally recognized his fellow sect member, his voice weak and breathy.</p><p>Qiao Jiang was overjoyed, immediately asking, “Brother Liu, what happened? How did you get so badly injured?”</p><p>“I… cough…”</p><p>The man, still dazed from waking, coughed violently.</p><p>Qiao Jiang helped him steady his breath and quickly explained, “Brother Liu, this is the trading fair… How many from the Tian Xing League came? Tell me quickly, so many of our fellow disciples are here; we will avenge you…”</p><p>“Trading fair…”</p><p>“Right, the trading fair!”</p><p>The man suddenly came to his senses. Leaning on Qiao Jiang’s hand, he sat up abruptly, urgently addressing the guards: "Where is Elder Pei Qin?  Quickly, fetch the elder to save people…"</p><p>Hearing this, the onlookers were shocked.</p><p>Only Golden Core cultivators are addressed as “Elder.”</p><p>The expert behind the trading fair was actually a Golden Core cultivator!  No wonder they dared to hold it here.</p><p>Many were also relieved they had resisted temptation and hadn’t broken the trading fair’s rules.  Those who had in the past had all disappeared without a trace – a clear warning.</p><p>This brought a sense of enormous security; their anxieties eased.</p><p>If the sky fell, there was someone tall enough to hold it up.</p><p>At least there was a Golden Core cultivator present, a pillar of support.  Even if something went wrong, they wouldn't be defenseless.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned to the passage leading to the second floor of the hall. Could it be that the Foundation Establishment cultivator, Pei Qin, resided in the hall below?</p><p>Unexpectedly, the gatekeeper chuckled awkwardly, "My friend, I don't know Pei Qin. I'm not sure who you're referring to…"</p><p>Before the gatekeeper could finish, the Liu cultivator took a deep breath, suddenly raising his arm.  In his hand, he held a gleaming token. He tilted his head, channeled his spiritual energy, and in a hoarse voice shouted, "This disciple, along with Master Fang and Master Shen Tu of the Yu Ling Sect, were ambushed and attacked by several Golden Core cultivators from the Tian Xing Alliance. The situation is critical. Master Fang and Master Shen Tu are trapped, and they ordered this disciple to come to the trading fair to request Master Pei Qin's assistance. The message has been delivered; please, Master, consider this matter…"</p><p>His voice echoed throughout the hall.</p><p>After delivering this message in one breath, the Liu cultivator collapsed into Qiao Jiang's arms, exhausted and unconscious.</p><p>‘Ding!’</p><p>The token fell to the ground.  Wrought from black iron, it bore an ancient character: ‘Han.’</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The gatekeeper was too late to intervene; he stamped his foot in anger.</p><p>The expressions on everyone’s faces were varied.  They had all heard of this token; it was said that very few existed.</p><p>To combat the Tian Xing Alliance, the various sects of Xiaohan Region had set aside their differences and cooperated.</p><p>The sight of the token was equivalent to seeing a Nascent Soul cultivator.  In emergencies, its use was undeniable; no one, not even a Golden Core cultivator, could disobey, unless they wished to be banished from Xiaohan Region.</p><p>Judging by the gatekeeper's attitude, he seemed reluctant to disturb his master and get involved, but he was forced into a corner by the Liu cultivator in front of everyone.</p><p>The token held immense power and significance.</p><p>But obedience wasn't mandatory.</p><p>If the Liu cultivator had approached privately, Pei Qin could have simply refused, claiming he hadn't received an order, and then killed the Liu cultivator without leaving a trace.  Without evidence, no one could blame him.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the trading fair today.  Dozens of people were present, including disciples from the Eight Righteous Sects, who witnessed this scene.  It couldn’t be covered up.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>With so many people present, would they really kill everyone to keep it quiet?</p><p>People exchanged uneasy glances, hesitant to move.  While a large number of Foundation Establishment cultivators were not afraid of one single Golden Core cultivator, they were on the other's territory, and nobody knew if there were deadly formations hidden within the hall.</p><p>The assembled cultivators were a disorganized group, unable to cooperate. At the first sign of an opportunity, everyone would flee, and those slow to react would perish.</p><p>They could only hope that this Pei Qin wasn't a madman; otherwise, dying here would be truly tragic.</p>
