<h1>Chapter 421: Demonic Sect</h1><p>Qin Sang glanced at Green Sun Market, a sneer playing on his lips.</p><p>Within his Mustard Seed Pouch were several useful magical artifacts. Qin Sang kept a few for his own use.</p><p>Before the Ebony Sword finished absorbing, during his many years of training, inevitable emergencies arose. Sometimes, he didn't have time to set up formations, which resulted in both the Myriad Crows Gourd and the Seven-Colored Silk Umbrella being destroyed in the Boundless Valley. Only the Yin-Yang Compass, with its special properties, survived.</p><p>He had been relying on the Ebony Sword recently, making his methods somewhat monotonous.</p><p>These artifacts would nicely supplement his arsenal.</p><p>Apart from these, the other items were unremarkable. Qin Sang sorted and stored them away.</p><p>Eliminating Dove Robe Taoist's minions and earning a substantial profit was a double win. Qin Sang pondered briefly and, instead of continuing towards Green Sun City, rode the Ghost Orchid Cloud towards Green Sun Market.</p><p>He was satisfied with eliminating Silver Flame and couldn't make any other moves for a while.</p><p>Dove Robe Taoist wasn't a fool. So many coincidences couldn't actually be coincidences.</p><p>It was better to return to Green Sun Market and focus on cultivation.</p><p>……</p><p>Green Sun Market.</p><p>Disguised, Qin Sang entered the market and returned to his cave dwelling for a short rest, washing away the dust of his journey.  He then walked to a building called 'Sky Spear Tower'.</p><p>The five-story building, with its ornate beams and painted rafters, was one of the tallest in Green Sun Market.</p><p>Sky Spear Tower's fame lived up to its grandeur. Everyone in Green Sun Market and the surrounding cultivation world knew of it. Its true owner was rumored to be a merchant association under a powerful sect, specializing in magical artifacts.</p><p>They were particularly adept at crafting offensive artifacts, such as spirit swords.</p><p>Qin Sang had risen to prominence in Green Sun Market. After several sects approached him, and after he decided to entrust "Sword Pavilion" to Ning Youwei, he accepted Sky Spear Tower's invitation to become a guest elder.</p><p>Qin Sang's artifact refinement inheritance originated from the Ethereal Spirit Sect. After the Ebony Sword absorbed the Blood Mulberry, he essentially possessed the experience of refining magical treasures, an advantage other refiners couldn't match.</p><p>Top-grade magical artifacts were rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang specialized in refining spirit swords and had a high success rate in crafting high-grade magical artifacts, which perfectly matched Sky Spear Tower's needs.</p><p>They were very satisfied with Qin Sang, tolerating his absences for training or secluded cultivation, sometimes for months at a time.</p><p>"Taoist Qing Feng, you're finally here…"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang in his Taoist robe, the old steward of Sky Spear Tower was overjoyed and hurried over, immediately launching into a litany of complaints.</p><p>"Taoist, you've been like a dragon, rarely seen. You've been gone for almost a year! Those little ancestors from the Green Sun Sect refuse anyone but you! They've been waiting and hoping, practically going mad. If you hadn't shown up, they would have torn my old bones apart…"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at the steward's theatrics and chuckled, "The prestigious Sky Spear Tower, afraid of the Green Sun Sect's brats? If they dare touch you, have your superiors bring people to their doorstep and lodge a complaint with their elders…"</p><p>Sky Spear Tower's origins were mysterious.  Their backing sect might not fear the Green Sun Sect, but since Green Sun Market was the Green Sun Sect's territory, they had to exercise restraint.</p><p>"Even a powerful dragon cannot suppress a local snake!"</p><p>The old steward shook his head and said seriously, "Taoist, how many days will you be staying this time?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't keep him in suspense. "I plan to stay for a while. Send out messenger talismans and let them all come."</p><p>The old steward was overjoyed. "Good! I'll do it right away. Taoist, please rest in the fire chamber first…"</p><p>Qin Sang walked familiarly to the back hall of Sky Spear Tower. There was a secret passage leading to an underground fire vein. This fire vein was small, much smaller than the Thunder Swallow's nest, but its fire energy was stable, making it perfect for refining.</p><p>The deeper he went, the hotter the air became, and the walls of the chamber gradually turned crimson.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the deepest point and, taking out a command arrow, opened the fire chamber exclusively for him.</p><p>The fire chamber was simply furnished.</p><p>A stone platform, a furnace in front, placed over the fire vein.</p><p>The furnace was no ordinary one. Covered in layers of restrictions, it absorbed the fire energy, making it docile and easy to control.</p><p>Before reaching the Core Formation stage, cultivators couldn't control their own inner fire. This kind of earth fire was essential for alchemy and artifact refining. Especially when constrained by restrictions, there was no need to divert attention to suppress the flames, greatly increasing the success rate.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the stone platform, waiting for visitors, lost in thought.</p><p>He agreed to Sky Spear Tower's invitation not only to earn money but also to make contact with Green Sun Sect disciples, hoping to glean information about the sect.</p><p>With this goal in mind, Qin Sang treated all Green Sun Sect disciples equally, regardless of their cultivation level or the reward offered.  He agreed to almost any request.</p><p>This included many Qi Refining stage disciples.</p><p>Although they came from the Green Sun Sect, Qi Refining cultivators were at the bottom of the cultivation world. The market had strict rules, and it was difficult to rely on the sect's name. Finding a suitable magical artifact was not easy.</p><p>Custom-made ones were even harder to come by, requiring substantial payment they couldn't afford.</p><p>Qin Sang charged fair prices, accommodated requests, and excelled at crafting flying swords, the most elegant and powerful type of magical artifact.  He was very popular.</p><p>Over the years, through his deliberate approach and willingness to please, he had become genuinely acquainted with many Green Sun Sect disciples, deepening his understanding of the sect.</p><p>The so-called Demonic Sects weren't all eccentric individuals who resorted to violence at every turn.</p><p>Unless driven by profit, many Demonic Sects, at least within their own territories, sought to maintain a certain order—an order that benefited them, to ensure the smooth operation of the sect.</p><p>There were also sects labeled "Demonic" because of their unique cultivation techniques or philosophies that were incompatible with the Righteous Path.</p><p>The Green Sun Demonic Sect was one of them.</p><p>Upon entering the Green Sun Demonic Sect, disciples cultivated the Green Sun Demonic Fire. They first received a fire seed bestowed by the sect. After refining and merging with this fire seed, they then cultivated using Green Sun Astral Essence, strengthening the fire seed while increasing their cultivation.</p><p>However, the Green Sun Demonic Fire originated from Green Sun Astral Essence, making its power incredibly violent.</p><p>Cultivating the demonic fire was not easy. Most disciples died from demonic fire backlash during cultivation, ending up completely incinerated, a gruesome fate.</p><p>After their death, the fire seed remained and grew stronger.</p><p>The Green Sun Demonic Sect would then retrieve the fire seed. Qin Sang didn't know what they used it for.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of the Gloom Yin Sect's Yama Banner. These two Demonic Sects shared some similarities.</p><p>However, the Gloom Yin Sect was more ruthless. Even if a disciple overcame the Yama's backlash through great hardship, they would become the main soul of the Ghost Banner, leaving no chance of survival.</p><p>In the Green Sun Demonic Sect, there was at least a glimmer of hope. As long as one could suppress the fire seed's backlash, there was a chance to break through to Foundation Establishment, and even Core Formation.</p><p>The fire seed was retrieved only after death.</p><p>Reaching the Core Formation stage meant entering the sect's highest ranks, allowing one to benefit from the retrieval of fire seeds.</p><p>Even so, this philosophy of using disciples as tools was incompatible with the Righteous Path, making their designation as a Demonic Sect undeniable.</p>
