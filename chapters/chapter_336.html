Chapter 329: Reunion in the Secret Market


Qin Sang rented a stone house and laid down several layers of protective barriers inside.  He took out a "sheepskin scroll" from his storage pouch.


The scroll appeared unchanged on the surface.


When Qin Sang channeled his spiritual energy into it, a bright white light flashed.  Before the secrets of the Ziwei Palace could fully manifest, he withdrew his energy, and the scroll returned to normal.


Holding the scroll, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.  He couldn't decide how to handle it.


The spiritual tide had only just begun to show signs. These signs would gradually intensify, followed by frequent celestial phenomena and rampaging cloud beasts.


The ancient Immortal battlefield would descend into utter chaos, with celestial events occurring day and night, and cloud beasts running rampant.  Only exceptionally powerful cultivators could survive there.


At that point, the Seven Heroes Pass would be sealed shut, and only then would the spiritual tide arrive.


Past experience showed that the brewing time for the spiritual tide varied; it could take decades, even approaching a century.


If the tide arrived late, and he could reach the Nascent Soul stage before the Ziwei Palace opened, then entering would be feasible.  However, Qin Sang knew this possibility was slim.


He had no clue how to achieve the Nascent Soul stage.


Even someone as gifted as Senior Brother Qi Yuanshou – the strongest cultivator below the Nascent Soul stage in Xiaohua Mountain – had reached the Pseudo-Nascent Soul stage when Qin Sang first arrived at Xuanlu Pass, yet nearly thirty years later, he still hadn't achieved Nascent Soul.  This shows just how difficult it is.


I'll return to Xuanlu Pass, utilize the resources of my sect, and then thoroughly investigate the Ziwei Palace, he thought.


With a sigh, Qin Sang put away the scroll and took out his auction spoils, arranging them before him.


Several types of spirit wood were for his ebony sword; he would let it slowly absorb them.


The top-grade spiritual artifact, the Yellow Sand Banner, wasn't difficult to control; Qin Sang could easily wield it after a brief refinement. He now had another means of combat.


Then there were the three Soul-Guiding Grasses.


Qin Sang opened one of the jade boxes and carefully took out a grass.


Three leaves intertwined, forming a bud at the top.  It was as long as an adult's arm but light as a feather.


Qin Sang sniffed the herb's fragrance. It lacked a distinct scent or peculiar odor, yet when the scent entered his body, he felt his soul subtly stirred.


He didn't trigger the protective barrier on the Soul-Guiding Grass, deciding to refine the Heavenly Corpse Talismans later when he was settled.


Three plants, nine leaves – enough for several attempts, but not to be wasted. This herb was rare and precious.


The auction ended at the hour of the Tiger (3-5 am).  Qin Sang waited an hour in the stone house.


After daybreak, Qin Sang left the house.


Many experts had been drawn to the auction; today's items were significantly better than before, so Qin Sang decided to explore, and his efforts were rewarded.


He even found two of the Five Yin Objects, a pleasant surprise.


Before he knew it, a day had passed. Qin Sang had explored the entire stone island, and almost constantly heard people discussing last night's auction, most of the conversations centering on the Ziwei Palace and its secrets.


This news would spread like wildfire throughout Xiaohan Domain, quickly sparking a frenzy to find the scroll.


Who wouldn't be tempted by the chance to trade a sheepskin scroll for a magical treasure?


Even without the auction, news of the Ziwei Palace secrets would eventually leak out, though not so quickly. After all, the competition was mainly among Nascent Soul cultivators.


Furthermore, the major forces that controlled the Xiaohan Domain—the Eight Righteous Sects and others with Nascent Soul ancestors—wouldn't participate. They didn't need the scroll; they could enter the Ziwei Palace under the protection of their Nascent Soul masters.


Those who truly needed the scroll were the smaller sects or solitary cultivators at the Golden Core stage.


As evening approached, Qin Sang found a secluded spot and activated the enchantment on his jade pendant.


The pendant's center glowed, forming a dagger-shaped beam of light pointing southeast, indicating the location of the secret market the old man had mentioned.


"I have to leave the island?"


Qin Sang frowned. Following the pendant's guidance, he reached the edge of the island and found the light pointed to an inconspicuous stone house.


After observing secretly for a while, people began entering the house.  Qin Sang waited until the appointed time before approaching.


A sign hung outside the stone building, but there were no customers. Qin Sang pulled her cloak tighter and stepped inside.  The elderly man she expected wasn't there; instead, a beautiful young woman with cultivation at the Foundation Establishment stage was the shopkeeper.

"What can I do for you...?"

The woman lounged inside, but as soon as she saw the jade pendant in Qin Sang's palm, her expression changed to a welcoming smile.  She said softly, "This way, please, Daoist friend?"

They entered a back room, which concealed a hidden door leading to a deep, dark passage.  Faint, shimmering restrictions glowed within.

Qin Sang stopped at the entrance, carefully observing the restrictions.

The woman covered her mouth and chuckled.  "Daoist friend, don't worry. These are concealment restrictions to prevent outsiders from discovering the secret market. We don't have the deterrent power of Yinshan Pass, so we have to resort to this. The Daoist friends who participate in our secret market don't want to be exposed."

Satisfied that they were indeed concealment restrictions, Qin Sang nodded slightly and said, "Please lead the way."

After walking a short distance down the passage, they arrived at a small stone chamber. A long table and several chairs were inside, and it was nearly full of cultivators in various attire.

Despite the crowd, the chamber was remarkably silent.

The elderly man sat at the head of the table.  Seeing Qin Sang enter, he immediately stood to greet her, gesturing towards a seat with a welcoming smile.  "Another Daoist friend has arrived. Please have a seat and wait; the secret market is about to begin."

Qin Sang nodded and chose a chair.

She sensed several inquisitive gazes upon her but pretended not to notice, while subtly observing the others.

Without exception, they were all at the Foundation Establishment stage, with several being at the middle to later stages. The elderly man's influence surprised Qin Sang.

Many of them might have been familiar faces from yesterday's auction.

However, everyone was heavily cloaked, even more cautious than at the auction.

"There will likely be some good items today," Qin Sang thought, "though my spirit stones are running low.  At least I still have the spoils from Yu Daiyue and the others.  Hopefully, I can find something worthwhile."


A few more cultivators arrived.

The time approached. The elderly man sat upright, cleared his throat, and was about to speak when a heavy, unusually hurried footstep echoed from the passage.

"Who's so impatient?"

Qin Sang turned to see a large figure rushing in, the same strong man she'd seen yesterday!
