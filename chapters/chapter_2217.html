<h1>Chapter 2207 Seeking a Method</h1><p>Qin Sang roughly understood Hong Tian's meaning. This upheaval seemed to be deliberately orchestrated by the ancestors of the Yi people.  The "seeds" Hong Tian mentioned were perhaps one of their goals.</p><p>Now that the "seeds" have matured, the established powerhouses have gained the upper hand, laying their plans in advance and already taking their share. However, some have left behind guidance or sent younger cultivators to try their luck – obtaining even one seed would be a great gain.</p><p>No wonder Xian Tong and Tang Ye were so powerful beyond their cultivation levels. If they were entrusted with important missions, their ancestors would certainly not hesitate to bestow them with powerful defensive treasures.  Given the resources of the Yi people's ancestors, even if they couldn't match the Thunder Beast Guard, they wouldn't be far off.</p><p>As for Hong Tian and others, being newcomers without merit, they couldn't directly benefit from the established powerhouses. The "portion" he spoke of referred to a specific secret realm.</p><p>According to Zhan Yan, the Yi people, in return for a favor to the Daoist sect, allocated a region within their sacred land to the sect.  This is likely why the established powerhouses couldn't access this place before, leaving it unclaimed.</p><p>So, Hong Tian's real opponent is only that one person?</p><p>Qin Sang mused, glancing towards the direction of Long Jiao Wang's underwater palace.</p><p>Seeing through his thoughts, Hong Tian said, "The upheaval in the sacred land has created unimaginable opportunities, allowing me and Long Jiao Wang to break through to the Saint Realm. But we are not the only ones destined for this."</p><p>This implied that more people would break through to the Saint Realm!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of Yu Wang and the Mermaid Queen. These two rulers, leading the Celestial and Aquatic divisions respectively, were not only powerful but also top-tier experts among the Yi people, the most likely candidates to break through to the Saint Realm. Yet, both had vanished.</p><p>Could they be hiding somewhere, focusing on their breakthroughs?</p><p>"The current changes in the sacred land are unprecedented.  How many treasures and opportunities remain, and how will the destined ones be chosen, must be discussed once everyone has gathered.  It's too early to say. However, some items have always existed whenever the sacred land is opened; some are highly sought after. I have a list here; take a look."</p><p>Hong Tian flicked his finger, sending a stream of light towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it; it felt cool to the touch, a jade slip.</p><p>At this point, he couldn't refuse. Besides the temptation of the Nascent Soul stage, Hong Tian's words implied a condition: if he didn't agree, these outsiders would be excluded from entering the secret realm.</p><p>But if he agreed, he might face other Saint Realm powerhouses.</p><p>Since ancient times, risk and opportunity coexist. For the chance to reach the Nascent Soul stage, it was worth fighting for!</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't lacking in courage. He immediately made up his mind, bowing slightly, "I have a humble request. I hope you will grant me a thunder technique!"</p><p>The implication was that he accepted.</p><p>His acceptance stemmed from his confidence.</p><p>Firstly, he had the Small Cave Heaven.  He remembered Zi Wei Tongzi saying that if he encountered danger, he could hide within the Small Cave Heaven, concealing himself from ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Hong Tian's opponents were newly ascended Saint Realm cultivators, just beginning to grasp their domains, fitting this description.</p><p>Secondly, there was the Thunder Beast Guard. A Nascent Soul stage thunder technique was sealed within the Thunder Beast Guard. In a crisis, even if Hong Tian was momentarily careless, he could withstand a blow from a powerhouse, buying himself time.</p><p>Last time, sealing the sacrificial thunder oath using the [missing character] pearl failed because Qin Sang's cultivation was insufficient to control it. If a true Nascent Soul cultivator personally cast the technique, the outcome might be drastically different. Now that the Thunder Beast Guard was fully recovered, and the [missing character] pearl was in place, its ability to withstand attacks would be much stronger.</p><p>Revealing the Thunder Beast Guard could also explain his ability to counterkill Xian Tong and Tang Ye, thereby concealing other trump cards.</p><p>A powerful thunder technique must be pre-sealed within the Thunder Beast Guard, capable of launching only a single attack comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator; without it, its combat strength would be equivalent to that of a late-stage Void Refinement cultivator, hardly worthy of Hong Tian's attention.</p><p>Even if Hong Tian took the Thunder Beast Guard, it would help conceal other secrets, making it worthwhile.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, summoning the Thunder Beast Guard.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Thunder flashed, and the Thunder Beast Guard appeared beside Qin Sang, standing tall and proud.</p><p>Thunder surrounded it, its sharpness evident!</p><p>Upon learning of the Thunder Beast Guard's abilities, Hong Tian's expression brightened.  He praised, "A magnificent war-beast! If I had possessed such a war-beast back then, I wouldn't have been forced to flee."</p><p>Hong Tian's eyes showed approval and appreciation. The stronger Qin Sang was, the more advantageous it would be for his plans.</p><p>"I don't cultivate thunder techniques, but that's not a problem. I will find a way to obtain one for you. Do you have any other requests? Let me know."</p><p>"I have one more request!"</p><p>Qin Sang said, "This victory over our powerful enemies and the foiling of their conspiracy wasn't achieved by me alone.  It was a joint effort with Daoist Liuli. May she accompany me?"</p><p>Hong Tian looked at Qin Sang intently, then said indifferently, "I only have my eyes on you! If someone is willing to serve me, I won't refuse. But for various reasons, my resources are limited, and I must be selective. You are worth my investment, but she may not be, unless she demonstrates sufficient value to me. You can take her, but to gain my protection, you must perform better than others! Otherwise, her life or death is none of my concern!"</p><p>These words sounded cold, but they revealed a timeless truth: nothing comes for free.</p><p>"Let me remind you," Hong Tian said gravely, "the dangers within are not solely from your opponents. Once you enter, I cannot foresee what you will encounter. I will not recklessly force my way in until I see an opportunity, and I can't do much about it. I can only help you block other cultivators," he warned.  "With your strength, you may manage it easily. Can she?"</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, unsure if Hong Tian had already discerned Liuli's cultivation level.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Emperor Talisman still lingered, but what if the trials within tested more than just strength?</p><p>He couldn't decide for Liuli; it depended on her will. But knowing Liuli, regardless of the dangers ahead, she likely wouldn't give up.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>An unusual surge of energy suddenly came from the horizon.</p><p>Yun Mountain trembled, and the surrounding mist was impacted, surging like a tidal wave.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Hong Tian abruptly stood, gazing at the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Simultaneously, a subtle aura appeared above the Water Palace, slowly revealing a graceful figure –  Queen Long Jiao.</p><p>Two Saint Realm powerhouses were alarmed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang also sensed it – the disturbance carried a celestial might.</p><p>"Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Someone was undergoing a tribulation in the distance.  Hong Tian's words had proven true; someone else was about to break through to the Saint Realm.</p><p>An additional Saint Realm powerhouse meant another opponent for Hong Tian. Qin Sang secretly observed Hong Tian and found that he showed no intention of disrupting the other person's breakthrough.</p><p>Interfering with someone's tribulation could easily backfire. Furthermore, the changes in the Sacred Land were long planned, likely anticipated by the ancestor of the Yi people. Losing a Saint Realm powerhouse would be a significant loss for the entire Yi people; Hong Tian certainly wouldn't dare to openly disrupt the overall situation. Doing so would make him a target for everyone.</p><p>Hong Tian waved his hand, scattering green light like a gentle rain, which mingled with the mist.</p><p>The void suddenly stabilized, minimizing the impact of the disturbance.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang notice that Hong Tian's condition was strange; he seemed to be bearing a huge mountain, under immense pressure.</p><p>Clearly, the threat here was not limited to the beast tide.  The leader of the Yuanxiang and others were resisting the beast tide below, while Hong Tian and Queen Long Jiao were confronting an unknown danger.</p><p>The waves of the Heavenly Tribulation continued relentlessly. Qin Sang perceived the passing of the Yin Fire Tribulation, followed by the Wind Tribulation, then the Thunder Tribulation...</p><p>Until the thunder subsided, and all returned to calm.</p><p>"I wonder who that was, and if they succeeded?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Then he heard Hong Tian say, "That cultivator is now one of our own. I shall go to congratulate them. Qin Zhenren, please feel free to leave. I will send you a message when the time is right."</p><p>"Yes! I take my leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed and left Yun Mountain, remembering the young man who had stopped him earlier. He decided to return the same way.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the sky, seeing the young man still waiting, seemingly with urgent business, his aura somewhat restless.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang's return, the young man was overjoyed and rushed forward, "Zhenren Qin is back..."</p><p>"I have been summoned by Lord Hong Tian, causing a delay for my fellow Daoist. Please forgive me.  I did not inquire earlier, but what is your Daoist name?" Qin Sang landed gracefully.</p><p>The young man hastened to say it was fine, "My name is Yu Zhen, of the... clan."</p><p>Qin Sang observed the young man, "I have not met Daoist Yu before. You are not from the Lower Realm, are you?"</p><p>In the minds of some of the Yi people, the Sacred Land was the legendary Immortal Realm, with some even considering themselves citizens of the Lower Realm.</p><p>The young man quickly said, "Zhenren, your eyes are sharp! But except for those who have reached the Saint Realm, there is no distinction; the so-called Upper Realm can also be seen as a cage."</p><p>This makes some sense, but the more polite Yu was, the more wary Qin Sang became.  Getting straight to the point, Qin Sang said, “I wonder what business Daoist Yu has with me?”</p><p>Yu Zhen chuckled nervously, glanced around, apologized for the intrusion, and then set up a restriction to isolate the area. He then spoke seriously, “Forgive my boldness, but has the Real Person ever seen a certain spiritual treasure…?”</p><p>Yu Zhen then conjured an object – a gourd.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face turned cold.  “Are you the owner of that gourd?”</p><p>The gourd was clearly the Extinction Gourd. Qin Sang had killed the immortal child, and the treasure naturally fell into his hands.  He didn't know who the gourd's true owner was, but he could sense that the mark within didn't belong to the immortal child.  Furthermore, the immortal child hadn't been able to wield the gourd smoothly, proving that someone else owned it.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. The Extinction Gourd had caused him immense suffering, and yet this person dared to appear before him, seemingly to reclaim it!</p><p>“Audacious! You conspired with that Si fellow to harm me. Do you think I wouldn't dare kill you?!” Qin Sang roared.</p><p>Yu Zhen smiled wryly and quickly tried to appease Qin Sang. “Real Person Qin, please calm down! I truly had no idea he would use the Extinction Gourd to harm you. Otherwise, I would never have given it to him…”</p><p>He was inwardly cursing himself. He knew he was only making things worse by appearing before Qin Sang. But the Extinction Gourd was incredibly important to him; it was his most relied-upon spiritual treasure in battle, and it significantly aided his cultivation of innate divine abilities, second only to his life-bound treasure.</p><p>Yu Zhen had poured enormous effort into crafting the Extinction Gourd, and the immortal child had gone to great lengths to borrow it.  Yu Zhen never expected the immortal child to fail. When he heard from the female cultivators Ping and Tang that the immortal child and Tang were… gone, his heart sank. After further inquiries, learning that the immortal child likely died at the hands of his enemy, he became frantic with regret, wishing he hadn't been tempted by a small gain, ultimately suffering a great loss.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's expression grow colder, filled with killing intent, Yu Zhen quickly produced a pouch, offering it with both hands. “He only said he needed to borrow the treasure. All the payment is in here. I'll give it all to the Real Person, plus further compensation.  And I won't ask you to simply return the Extinction Gourd; I'm willing to offer an equivalent exchange.”</p><p>Yu Zhen hadn't considered simply taking it back by force. The immortal child had set a deadly trap, involving five powerful cultivators including Ping and Tang. Not only had they failed, but Qin Sang had killed two of them.  This was an astounding feat, and Yu Zhen was understandably afraid.  Others hearing of this would hesitate before confronting Qin Sang. Gathering enough people, and the cost of enlisting help, would be far greater than simply approaching Qin Sang directly and negotiating.</p><p>Thus, Yu Zhen waited here for Qin Sang, his heart filled with anxiety and uncertainty.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, staring into Yu Zhen's. He didn't believe Yu Zhen was entirely innocent, but the latter hadn't participated in the pursuit or held a direct grudge, leaving room for reconciliation.  The immortal child was dead; that score was settled, at least for now.  If Qin Sang wished to remain in the Mist Sea, making too many enemies wasn't wise.</p><p>However, the Extinction Gourd was too much of a threat to him, and he couldn't easily return it.  Qin Sang decided to stall, giving himself time to consider.</p><p>“Daoist Yu is mistaken. I was fortunate to escape with my life. I have no power to seize this treasure. That person probably intended to steal your treasure and blame it on me. You must be wary and avoid being deceived. As for your borrowing the treasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone grew colder.  “I will settle the score in due time!”</p><p>Without giving Yu Zhen a chance to reply, Qin Sang turned and left.</p><p>“Real Person Qin!”</p><p>Yu Zhen watched helplessly as Qin Sang departed. The immortal child and Tang were gone, but Qin Sang denied killing them. What could he even say?</p><p>Qin Sang vanished into the thick fog, his mind already turning to his next move.  A flicker of determination crossed his eyes.</p>
