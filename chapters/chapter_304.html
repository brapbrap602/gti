<h1>**Chapter 297: Douchebag**</h1><p>**Chapter 297: Douchebag**</p><p>The ark broke through the fire waves, dashing away swiftly.</p><p>Soon after, they saw a dazzling beam of silver light dashing through the sea of fire in front, moving at a high speed.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen that silver light before. It was emitted by Yan Wu’s precious mirror-type magic weapon. There were no obvious fluctuations within the silver light, indicating that the two people hadn’t caught up with Yan Wu yet.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Cloud Wanderer put away his bamboo stick ark.</p><p>Qin Sang took the lead, followed closely by Cloud Wanderer as they met Yan Wu.</p><p>Yan Wu was immensely shocked to suddenly see two people appear in front of him.</p><p>After recognizing that they were Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer, he assumed that Qin Sang was being hunted down by Cloud Wanderer. Without waiting for Qin Sang to tell him what happened, he flipped over the precious mirror in his hand without hesitation and shot a beam of mirror light directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Then his escape light flashed and he fled to the right.</p><p>Yan Wu’s first reaction wasn’t to work with Qin Sang against their enemy: it was to use Qin Sang to force the other person back, blocking the exit and giving himself time to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and sighed secretly. He wasn’t too surprised by this, however.</p><p>May your fellow Daoist die but not me.</p><p>This was a common occurrence in the world of xianxia cultivation.</p><p>But even so, Yan Wu was an extreme case, since he could’ve killed the enemy with Qin Sang’s help. His first reaction, however, was to use Qin Sang as a scapegoat.</p><p>This didn’t have much to do with the grudge between them. Qin Sang believed that Yan Wu would’ve done the same thing if it had been Wu Chen instead.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer snorted with disdain upon seeing this and gave up on the idea of working with Yan Wu. “Kill him,” he commanded.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and dodged the beam of mirror light with a flash. Meanwhile, Cloud Wanderer’s feet glimmered with light as he easily caught up with Yan Wu with the help of the ark, blocking his path.</p><p>Yan Wu thought he had succeeded, and before he could rejoice, he was cornered by Cloud Wanderer and Qin Sang, one in front and one behind. He was filled with astonishment and suddenly realized everything. “You’re working together!” he exclaimed.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer was too lazy to waste his breath on him, so he opened his right palm. The pearl’s light flickered as it shone with a verdant glow. It seemed to be moving slowly but eagerly as it flew toward Yan Wu.</p><p>The pearl seemed as light as a feather, devoid of any strength. However, it filled Yan Wu with a sense of impending doom and his face turned pale with fear.</p><p>He tried to retreat.</p><p>But at the same time, Qin Sang flicked his Ebonywood Sword lightly and the precious sword vanished and reappeared, blocking Yan Wu’s path of retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang and Cloud Wanderer were both experienced cultivators. Both the pearl and the Ebonywood Sword were rare and precious treasures. Furthermore, they were attacking from the front and the back in close coordination.</p><p>Yan Wu had no chance of escape. He was caught off guard and didn’t even put up a decent fight before the Ebonywood Sword knocked the precious mirror out of his hand.</p><p>Then, Cloud Wanderer’s pearl flashed and struck Yan Wu’s chest, shattering his heart and killing him on the spot.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer used his spiritual energy to form a large hand that grabbed Yan Wu’s body. His expression suddenly changed and he sent a voice transmission, “They’re here. Little Qin, leave quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t turn back to look. He rode his sword past Cloud Wanderer and flew into the sea of fire. Then, he activated the Nine Dragons Heavenly Carriage Talisman and escaped into the distance.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer carried Yan Wu’s body and turned to face the approaching Elder Gong and Monk Yin.</p><p>“My fellow Daoists, you’re a bit late. I’ve already taken care of things.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer smiled slightly and held up Yan Wu’s body to show them. He reached into the corpse’s waist and took the mustard seed pouch before tossing the body aside.</p><p>The two men exchanged glances and watched as the body was reduced to ashes. Their lips twitched involuntarily.</p><p>“The other fellow, was he also killed by the Daoist master?”</p><p>Monk Yin asked tentatively.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer nodded and said casually, “The junior didn’t know his place. I tried to persuade him, but he refused to listen and stubbornly resisted. I had no choice but to kill him. I originally wanted to help you two fellow Daoists take care of this trouble, but you hadn’t arrived yet and I had to act rashly. I almost let the bastard get away.”</p><p>The two secretly sneered at his words, doubting that the enemy had been stubbornly resisting. They suspected that this old bastard had coveted their treasures and mercilessly killed Yan Wu without ever intending to capture him alive.</p><p>According to their previous agreement, everyone would fend for themselves and the spoils of war would belong to whoever found them. No one else was allowed to fight over them.</p><p>The mustard seed pouches of two Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p>Elder Gong’s eyes flickered and he chuckled. “I didn’t expect the Daoist master to be not only skilled in escape techniques, but also so powerful. You easily defeated two opponents of similar cultivation. I’m impressed!”</p><p>“It was nothing.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer squinted and smiled, but said nothing about the spoils of war. He activated his escape light and flew away.</p><p>The two men looked at each other, shaking their heads with regret. They were envious of him, but they didn't dare to force Youyunzi to give up his spoils and share them equally.</p><p>Youyunzi had killed two opponents consecutively in a short period of time, and he himself had not been harmed, showing his immeasurable power.</p><p>Outside the sea of fire.</p><p>Yu Kong was dead, and the situation was fully controlled by Luoxingnan.</p><p>After listening to the report of Elder Gong, Luoxingnan nodded indifferently, paced in front of Shangguan Lifeng, feeling complacent, and said with a smile, "Boy, how is it? I didn't fool you, right? The murderer who killed your master is either Shengyuanzi or that old dog Yu! Among them, that old dog Yu is the most cunning, and sure enough, it's him!"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng was seriously injured, but after taking the pills, his face improved a lot.</p><p>He coughed violently several times and said in a hoarse voice, "Rest assured, I will abide by the agreement, stay and be used by you, and repay you."</p><p>Luoxingnan laughed loudly, very satisfied with Shangguan Lifeng's attitude. His eyes fell on Wu Chen again, and he said lightly, "Do you want to live?"</p><p>Wu Chen nodded quickly.</p><p>……</p><p>After Luoxingnan and others left, the prohibition recovered calmly, and the flames seemed to burn forever.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure changed from illusory to solid, and that was Ge Yuan.</p><p>Ge Yuan hadn't stood firm yet when he saw a figure flash out of the sea of fire ahead, so he was vigilant.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ge."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from a distance to indicate and looked at Ge Yuan secretly, finding that although he didn't seem to be injured on the surface, his breath was somewhat unstable, showing that he must have been in great danger when he was besieged by the snakes.</p><p>If Youyunzi hadn't helped him secretly, he would have been killed by the snakes.</p><p>"Has Senior Youyunzi sent any news?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>Ge Yuan saw that it was Qin Sang, let down his guard, shook his head, and asked about the situation just now.</p><p>Qin Sang told the truth.</p><p>Ge Yuan frowned and looked a little anxious when he heard that Luoxingnan had not only suffered no loss of personnel, but had also been supplemented.</p><p>Then he heard Qin Sang talk about the plan he had made with Youyunzi, and Ge Yuan's eyes flashed with disbelief, and he said in a deep voice, "Luoxingnan is strong. It's best not to conflict with him! Those people are desperate and untrustworthy. How can we know that they won't help Luoxingnan get rid of us first? We are here to collect medicine, not to fight!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ge Yuan and said nothing more.</p><p>The two men waited silently.</p><p>Suddenly, Ge Yuan's face showed joy, and he looked at the blue flame on the left.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p>
