<h1>Chapter 1844: Sealing the Mountain</h1><p>The water wave, a manifestation of the female demon’s power, dissipated with a force comparable to a mountain collapse.  The initial clash created such a commotion that the crystal structure inevitably vibrated.  The entire space was a single piece of crystal; any disturbance rippled throughout. This tremor couldn't be hidden from the acute senses of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Other demon cultivators would soon notice and come to the rescue.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of concealing his actions. He aimed for a swift victory and retreat before reinforcements arrived.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deep indentation appeared in the water wave, faintly revealing the shape of a footprint. The footprint pressed into the ground; a *crackling* sound echoed as countless fine fissures radiated outward. The sturdy crystal passage couldn't withstand the force and threatened to collapse.</p><p>The female demon was in the forefront, her eyes filled with utter terror. She watched helplessly as a monstrous figure burst from the water, bringing overwhelming pressure, yet she was powerless to stop it.</p><p>The threat of the sword light loomed overhead, carrying the breath of death, preventing her from diverting her attention.</p><p>The sword's clear and resonant hum echoed and intensified through the passage, like a dragon's roar. The sword light resembled a celestial dragon, seemingly capable of shattering the void, ready to crush the demon beneath.</p><p>Facing imminent death, the female demon's eyes blooded, fine dragon scales appeared on her face, her head transformed into a horse's head, half her demonic form manifesting.  Her mouth changed as well, and a suppressed roar finally escaped from her gaping maw—a desperate shriek.</p><p>The shriek was sharp and piercing, like two pieces of metal scraping together.  The sound held a power to unsettle the mind, clearly a demonic ability. As the sound emitted, concentric circles of sound waves became visible around the demon's mouth.</p><p>The ripples in the void, like water waves, spread outwards, rapidly rotating like a whirlpool, containing a strange twisting force that drew in everything in its path, including light.  The center of the sound wave vortex directly confronted the sword light.  Its expansion was incredibly swift; the sword light seemed suppressed, like a fish caught in a whirlpool, unable to escape.</p><p>Hope flickered in the female demon's eyes. Then, a deafening roar shattered the sound wave vortex.  Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>The sword light transformed into a white tiger, bursting through the vortex.  Its eyes blazed with terrifying ferocity as it lunged at the female demon.  Her power had been cleaved by a single stroke!</p><p>It should be noted that this was not the ordinary Grey Warbler Sword, but a genuine spiritual treasure—the Cloud Wanderer Sword! Qin Sang only used the Seven Mansions Sub-division Sword Formation, fearing that the Seven Souls Killing Formation was too potent and would instantly kill the demon, preventing interrogation.</p><p>The ferocious white tiger was close at hand.</p><p>The female demon could see every hair on the white tiger, as if it were a real beast.  Despair deepened on her face. She spat out a silver light—the oval silver stone hidden in her throat.</p><p>A blurry silver rune appeared on the surface of the stone, like clouds and mist, its meaning unclear.  The rune gradually became clearer, a powerful force about to erupt from within the stone.</p><p>At that moment, a hand appeared above the silver stone.  The hand was translucent and radiant, emitting a pure glass-like light.  The palm faced down, aimed at the stone, and gripped tightly.  This hand used no artifacts, only the bare palm, yet its force was immense, like a collapsing mountain.  Amidst a booming sound, the rune was shattered before it could fully form.</p><p>The silver stone vibrated violently, its light abruptly dimming.  The next moment, the palm firmly held the stone.  The hand continued its assault, carrying the stone, striking toward the female demon.  The force created visible distortions in the void; a gale swept alongside the descending blow.</p><p>The female demon was terrified.  With her powers and treasures broken, she could only raise her arms in a desperate defense.  Unfortunately, her every move was a glaring flaw in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The female demon received the full force of the blow.  This strike incorporated the might of a Dharma Image and the power of Buddhist seals.  Qin Sang's strength and cultivation were comparable to a late Nascent Soul cultivator, and with the element of surprise, it was no match for a mere early Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>A female demon screamed, her arms shattered by a terrifying force.  A hand, still attached to a severed arm, slammed into her chest, smashing her scales and sending a devastating shockwave through her body. She trembled, vomited blood, and flew backward.</p><p>Agonizing pain overwhelmed her.  Covered in blood, the demon looked terribly injured.  While still airborne, she struggled desperately, but then her eyes were met with a blinding flash of sword light.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The ferocious White Tiger seized the opportunity, pouncing on the demon.  In the instant their figures overlapped, the demon froze.</p><p>A moment later, the White Tiger emerged, seemingly carrying something in its mouth.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The demon's body crashed to the ground, blood spurting from numerous wounds.  Only now were the numerous sword cuts visible, tearing through flesh and organs, almost dismembering her.</p><p>Her body was lifeless.</p><p>The White Tiger turned, leaped towards Qin Sang, who didn't dodge. He reached out and took what the tiger offered. The White Tiger then vanished.</p><p>He looked down at a ball of spiritual energy in his hand, the shape of a dragon-scaled beast faintly visible – the demon's spirit.  The spirit was enough; further questioning was unnecessary.</p><p>Qin Sang pocketed the spirit and gestured towards the demon's corpse, preparing to take it and leave. Then, he heard a series of thunderous booms in the distance.</p><p>He listened intently, his expression changing.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Other cultivators must have sensed the disturbance and come to the rescue. Judging by the vibrations and sounds, they were breaking through the crystal barriers, approaching at an unbelievable speed.  Even for him, navigating the crystals wouldn't be any easier.</p><p>“The Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom have indeed sent top-tier experts into the altar!”</p><p>Qin Sang, unwilling to take any risks, collected the corpse and fled at lightning speed. He had planned his escape route beforehand.  His swift attack, instant defeat of the demon, and capture of her spirit were crucial; even a slight delay would have made escape extremely difficult.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A section of the crystal wall in the passage shattered, and a stocky man burst through the hole.  His eyes narrowed as he quickly scanned the passage, seeing only lingering echoes of the battle. Without hesitation, he turned into a dark streak, pursuing the sound.</p><p>The dark streak zig-zagged through several passages, reaching the edge of the crystal space without finding his target.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>A howling wind, a grey, tangible force, rushed past the stocky man with incredible speed, leaving countless grey streaks in the void.</p><p>Beyond the crystal space, a grey hurricane, a gigantic rotating vortex, served as another illusion. It was wedged between several other illusions, unable to move, its wind scraping against the crystal surface.</p><p>The stocky man charged into the wind wall without hesitation, only to be met with chaos.</p><p>Leaving the crystal space, the mental suppression lifted, allowing the man to unleash his powerful spiritual sense in his pursuit.  However, his search proved fruitless.</p><p>Certainty that his target had escaped settled heavily on him.  His expression darkened, he abandoned the chase and returned.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xuan Hou and the other demons were gathered at the edge of the crystal space.  Only the female demon was missing; all the other demon lords were present.</p><p>Xuan Hou saw a blurry figure in the wind and approached, bowing in greeting.  Upon seeing that the stocky man returned empty-handed, his heart sank.  He said solemnly, “Let's thoroughly examine the passage for clues. Luo Hou was likely ambushed and barely managed to fight back. Her abilities were broken almost instantly. The enemy… was incredibly powerful!”</p><p>The stocky man remained silent, his face grim.</p><p>Xuan Hou pressed on,  “The attacker wasn't one of the monsters in the altar. While there are traces, their identity remains unknown. Could it have been…?”</p><p>He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p><p>The stocky man understood.  Could the attacker be like him—a Grand Master who had deliberately reduced their cultivation?</p><p>As a trusted advisor to the Demon King, Xuan Hou knew more secrets.</p><p>This battle was crucial for the fate of both the Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom. Both sides were determined to control the divine altar at any cost. This was understood by both sides.  The Daoist Court would certainly have dispatched Grand Masters, blending among the others, their identities currently unknown.</p><p>What use is it for a Grand Master to ambush a newly ascended Demon Marquis?  Is it simply to weaken their forces?</p><p>The stocky man couldn't admit he hadn't even seen the enemy, so he grunted, tossed the black token in the air, and pressed a finger to its center.  A faint cracking sound emanated from it.</p><p>In the distance…</p><p>Qin Sang was fleeing, examining the female demon's black token.  Suddenly, he heard a "pop," originating from within the token.  Before he could react, cracks appeared on its surface, and it shattered into several pieces.</p><p>The fragments were unremarkable, completely useless.</p><p>His gaze sharpened.  He kept moving, carrying the fragments, swiftly passing through several illusions, making sure no one was pursuing him. He stopped on a cloud.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, he produced the female demon's spirit.</p><p>"Answer a few questions truthfully, and I'll spare your life!" Qin Sang stared at the spirit, his voice cold.</p><p>The spirit, taking the form of a dragon-scaled beast, was only the size of a fist, somewhat translucent and ethereal. It was filled with terror, unable to offer any resistance.  "Spare me, Immortal! Spare me! I will tell you everything, I dare not deceive you, Immortal…"</p><p>Its voice was rough, like a man's. If Qin Sang hadn't seen her human form, it would be hard to imagine she was a female demon.</p><p>The dragon-scaled beast knelt, repeatedly knocking its head against the ground.</p><p>Even a Demon Marquis, facing life or death, couldn't maintain their dignity; they were no different from ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang's appearance was monstrous, yet the demon didn't even bat an eye, repeatedly calling him "Immortal."</p><p>"Why did you bring your army here?" Qin Sang asked coldly.</p><p>…</p><p>After questioning her, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The female demon truly spoke without reservation, hiding nothing.</p><p>But she knew too little.  Her cultivation and status didn't allow her access to true secrets.</p><p>According to her, after breaking through to the Ascended stage, she was recruited by King Yuan Lin. Her cultivation had improved over the years, but among the Demon Marquises, she was only middling, only able to follow orders.</p><p>Not long ago, the female demon received a decree from the Demon King, ordering her to rendezvous with her subordinates at the Demon King's palace, then immediately set off, joining forces with various Demon Kings at the edge of the Nial Plain, heading towards the Divine Altar.</p><p>The Gui Fang Kingdom acted swiftly, and the Celestial Court was no less efficient.  Both sides moved almost simultaneously.</p><p>During the standoff, the female demon received another decree, ordering her to enter the Divine Altar with Lord Xuan.  Accompanying them was a mysterious expert from the Grand Sage's Mansion.</p><p>This confirmed Qin Sang's earlier suspicions.</p><p>When Qin Sang asked about their purpose at the Divine Altar, the female demon was clueless, only knowing the Demon King ordered them to find something there, strictly before the Celestial Court.</p><p>The decree didn't specify the treasure's location, only marking some routes. The treasure was most likely hidden within the illusions along these routes, requiring a thorough search.</p><p>There was no description of the treasure itself. All the demon cultivators received a black token.</p><p>Only one sentence:  When the opportunity arises, the black token will reveal its mystical power.</p><p>"That black token is indeed important!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the fragments in his hand. Unfortunately, the token had a hidden mechanism. If the owner met with an accident, others could destroy it remotely.</p><p>When examining it earlier, Qin Sang hadn't noticed any mystical properties.  The fragments were even less revealing.</p><p>However, this information allowed him to deduce one thing: the Celestial Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom were both searching for a priceless treasure, sparing no expense.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't interested in this unknown treasure.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was useful to him, as a lone individual, how could he compete with two powerful forces?</p><p>Even if he obtained it, even if he found a hiding place, he couldn't take it out of the Divine Altar.</p><p>Grand Masters and Demon Kings have long lifespans.  Waiting outside the Divine Altar for hundreds or thousands of years was commonplace, unless Qin Sang never left.</p><p>"Since they're searching for treasure, before it appears, they shouldn't want to damage the Divine Altar," Qin Sang pondered, "However, once the treasure appears, there's no guarantee those Grand Masters and Demon Kings won't forcefully enter the Divine Altar and participate in the scramble.  Hopefully, they won't risk it and wait to fight after taking the treasure out…"</p><p>His thoughts raced. He'd made his decision – he wouldn't get involved in this conflict.</p><p>As long as the treasure hunt didn't affect the Divine Altar, he could simply stay in his cave abode and wait for the storm to pass. It wouldn't affect him.</p><p>If the Divine Altar suffered, he could do nothing anyway.</p><p>Compared to two behemoths, his power was too insignificant, like an ant trying to stop a chariot. His only option was to escape the calamity.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang's next task was to return to his cave abode and prepare.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang clasped his hands together, keeping his promise and not taking the demon's life. He sealed the female demon's spirit's senses, storing it away for future disposal.</p><p>The demon's cultivation was not low, but he wasn't planning on making her his subordinate.</p><p>Because of the Jade Buddha, at least during his cultivation in the Divine Altar, Qin Sang wouldn't take in subordinates with high intelligence.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rush back to his cave abode. He circled the illusions, confirming that the strong from both sides were indeed following those routes, some already deep within the illusions.</p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Sang returned to his own cave.  The journey was smooth.</p><p>Opening a small gap in the Flower Field Formation, Qin Sang slipped inside, casting seals to activate the formation's strongest concealment and defense mechanisms.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang slowly descended from the air, standing on a mountaintop, looking down at the vast expanse of flower fields, his brow furrowed.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Happy Holiday!  A bit late due to the festival.</p><p>Wishing you all a joyous reunion for the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
