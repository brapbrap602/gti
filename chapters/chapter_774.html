<h1>Chapter 766: Excitement</h1><p>This was the Great Rift that Xiang Yi had mentioned before, lying ahead, blocking their path.</p><p>The rift was extremely deep, its end unseen, the opposite side invisible. A constant stream of purple mist surged up from below, forming an upward current. It was likely the source of the poisonous fog.</p><p>A Nine Nether Demonic Flame flickered in Qin Sang's palm, its flames pointing directly into the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang crouched down and leaned forward slightly.</p><p>Immediately, a gust of air rushed towards his face. Upon impact, the poison-repelling armor on Qin Sang's body trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and quickly retreated, looking at Fat Silkworm with some concern.</p><p>This was only at the top of the rift, and the armor was already trembling. To search for the spiritual fire, he would have to descend along the cliff face, constantly facing the impact of the poisonous fog.</p><p>The poisonous fog below was even more terrifying.</p><p>If Fat Silkworm couldn't withstand it, there might not even be a chance to escape.</p><p>Fortunately, Fat Silkworm didn't show any signs of strain, opening its mouth to release a halo of light. Qin Sang's poison-repelling armor thickened by a layer, and he was safe and sound.</p><p>"Be more alert next time!"</p><p>Qin Sang glared at Fat Silkworm, relieved, and leaned out again.</p><p>Fat Silkworm blinked its small eyes, looking a bit wronged.</p><p>This time, the purple mist impacted the armor but was firmly blocked. Qin Sang looked down and saw that the cliff face was not smooth as a mirror, but rather uneven, providing handholds. He nodded inwardly.</p><p>Recklessly flying a sword down into the depths of the rift was definitely not advisable. It would be easy to alarm ferocious beasts during a rapid descent.</p><p>There were many beasts in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone that had adapted to the poisonous fog. The rift was undoubtedly no exception, and without a doubt, the closer to the source of the fog, the stronger the beasts.</p><p>Xiang Yi had mentioned that some speculated that there were beasts comparable to Transformation Demons in the depths of the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the rift for a while, listening attentively. Besides the whooshing sound of the poisonous fog surging, he didn't hear any beastly roars. Below was一片寂静 silent.</p><p>He walked along the edge to the left and right for a while, finding that everywhere was similar. The bottom was a chaotic mess, and descending from any location would be the same.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang had the Twin-Headed Vulture hold the concentric rings and cautiously began to climb down into the rift.</p><p>The stones on the cliff face emitted a bone-chilling coldness as Qin Sang climbed down using both hands and feet.</p><p>Few had been here before, and there were no paths. Qin Sang could only explore on his own.</p><p>Initially, out of caution, Qin Sang slowed down, constantly vigilant.</p><p>After climbing down for a while, seeing that there was no danger, and the rift was bottomless, going at this pace would waste too much time. Qin Sang had to increase his speed.</p><p>"Almost fifteen minutes, and still not at the bottom of the rift. The purple mist is getting thicker and thicker. At this point, Xiang Yi's Bone Lotus and the young man's jade bracelet probably wouldn't hold up. Fat Silkworm has been quite relaxed, which is a big surprise."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped on a rock, lifted his sleeve, and looked at Fat Silkworm approvingly.</p><p>This experience in the poisonous mist had verified Fat Silkworm's abilities. It was certain that Core Formation stage poisonous beasts couldn't penetrate the armor, but it was unknown whether it could withstand the intense poison of a Transformation Demon.</p><p>Fat Silkworm had just completed its third transformation, and the armor already had such power. If a suitable cultivation method could be found, there would definitely be even greater surprises in the future.</p><p>After resting for a moment, Qin Sang continued to climb down. After descending less than a few meters, he suddenly stopped, staring in surprise at the lower right.</p><p>Amidst the surging purple mist, he could vaguely see the silhouette of a vigorous tree, growing horizontally on the cliff face.</p><p>This old tree seemed withered, without branches or leaves, only a trunk. But on its top, there were dozens of fruits swaying gently in the poisonous fog.</p><p>"There are spiritual fruits growing in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone? Are they spiritual fruits or poisonous fruits?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Back in the Black Wind Valley underground palace, Fat Silkworm had been attracted by the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, eagerly consuming the unripe poisonous fruit, yet now there was no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, staring at the old tree, carefully examining it. There seemed to be no beasts guarding it.</p><p>He thought for a moment and silently moved towards the old tree. Unexpectedly, after only two sideways steps, he abruptly stopped, staring fixedly at the spiritual fruits at the top of the old tree.</p><p>These were not spiritual fruits at all; they were clearly some kind of ferocious birds, hanging upside down from the branches like bats, fast asleep!</p><p>Their wings were folded, their bodies round, rising and falling with the wind. From afar, they looked very much like spiritual fruits, but in reality, they were unknown ferocious birds, and there were dozens of them.</p><p>Below, there seemed to be similar old trees.</p><p>Small size didn't mean anything. Qin Sang didn't want to disturb this flock of birds.</p><p>He held his breath, carefully retreated, and made a detour, discovering that there were many more below, some hanging on trees, some hanging in crevices.</p><p>Cold sweat seeped from Qin Sang's forehead, and he became even more cautious.</p><p>Fortunately, such flocks of beasts were not common. It was unknown how deep he had descended when Qin Sang finally reached solid ground.</p><p>"Whew..."</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, pricking up his ears to listen. The surroundings were still very quiet, seemingly quieter at the bottom of the rift than above.</p><p>He stamped his feet; it was hard stone.</p><p>He summoned the Nine Nether Demonic Flame again. The flames pointed clearly to the front left, flickering even more excitedly than before, incredibly jubilant, very different from its behavior on Cold Flame Island.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, shook his head, and put away the Twin-Headed Vulture.</p><p>One man and one beast, incredibly vigilant, silently walked forward.</p><p>The bottom of the rift was far wider than imagined. Although Qin Sang was walking diagonally, even after a long distance, he still couldn't see the opposite cliff face.</p><p>Guided by the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, Qin Sang traversed the poisonous fog-filled rift, practically proceeding step by step, and constantly monitoring Fat Silkworm's condition.</p><p>Fat Silkworm was no longer as comfortable as before, crouching on his sleeve with a solemn expression, having already released several halos of seven-colored light to reinforce the armor.</p><p>With each exhale, Fat Silkworm's eyes dimmed a little, seemingly reaching its limit.</p><p>Suddenly, Fat Silkworm hissed, scrambling from his sleeve onto the back of his hand, raising its upper body, its eyes filled with an urgent longing, its cries full of desire.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, then immediately realized that Fat Silkworm had smelled something beneficial to it.</p><p>There was something in the depths of the purple mist that interested Fat Silkworm?</p><p>Besides the Red Fire Gilded Gold, the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and the Demonic Beast poison cores were all related to poison. It wasn't strange that there was something poisonous in the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone that could attract Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Fat Silkworm stretched its plump body as far as it could, pointing to the left, not in the same direction Qin Sang was heading.</p><p>Qin Sang looked left and right, pondered for a moment, and decided to go after what Fat Silkworm wanted first.</p><p>Even if he found the spiritual fire, the hope of immediately subduing it was slim. At most, he could refine another fire pearl and would need to work on it gradually later. However, if there was something poisonous that could help Fat Silkworm grow, it would have an immediate effect.</p><p>Fat Silkworm was already showing signs of strain.</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, changed direction, and quickened his pace. Fat Silkworm immediately became excited.</p><p>Without beastly interference, Qin Sang's speed increased, sprinting through the vast rift. Fat Silkworm tensed its body, fully maintaining the armor, for Qin Sang, and for itself.</p>
