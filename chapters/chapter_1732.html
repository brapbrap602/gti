<h1>Chapter 1723: Journey South</h1><p>Even the top experts, unflappable in the face of mountains crumbling before them, were stunned by the incredible secrets revealed one after another.  Was this still the world they knew?</p><p>But Qin Zhenjun’s testimony, corroborated by the three sects of Buddhism, Daoism, and Demon Cultivation, along with all the strange events, left them no choice but to believe.</p><p>Qin Sang had done all he could, saying everything he needed to. Whether they believed him or not was none of his concern. He made them swear an oath of secrecy and then dismissed them.</p><p>The ceremony concluded.</p><p>Unaware guests went home happy, their faces full of wonder and excitement. Everyone was discussing the Ascension Platform, believing that cultivators in this world now had a new path to ascension. Those who couldn't achieve the Transformation God realm and were facing death now had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>But those in the know were worried.</p><p>It wasn't that a new path had opened, but that the old one had been severed!</p><p>The Ascension Platform might be the only hope left.</p><p>It was foreseeable that after the ceremony, the news would spread throughout the cultivation world, inevitably triggering a massive search for the Ascension Platform.  Various factions would spare no effort, scouring ancient texts and exploring hidden secrets.</p><p>Mobilizing the power of the entire world was obviously more effective and hopeful than the efforts of a single person or sect.</p><p>This was exactly what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>The guests dispersed.</p><p>The Poison King and Ming, a senior elder of Mount Wan Du, took their leave from Master Xing Ji. As they reached the temple gate, about to take to the air and return to Mount Wan Du, they heard someone behind them say,</p><p>“Friends, wait a moment.”</p><p>The Poison King turned and saw Qin Sang walking slowly towards them. “This cultivator has long heard of the wondrous and unique scenery of Mount Wan Du, and wishes to pay a visit.”</p><p>Something’s amiss!</p><p>The Poison King’s expression stiffened.  He had repeatedly tried to reason with this person, but Qin Sang had avoided the issue, clearly intending to take the Gu King. Now, having become a True Lord, Qin Sang was still pressing the issue. It was obviously a plot.</p><p>Wasn’t the Gu King enough for him?</p><p>This is outrageous!</p><p>The Poison King was inwardly furious, his mouth twitching slightly. “What an honor to have a True Lord visit our humble abode. Elder Ming, quickly return to the mountain and summon the disciples to welcome the True Lord.”</p><p>Elder Ming was about to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand to stop him, saying, “This is a private visit; there’s no need for a grand reception… I’ve already made an appointment with Sect Master Yan of the Qiongying Sect, and intend to visit them first. If you two have no pressing matters, why not come along?”</p><p>The Poison King and Elder Ming exchanged a glance and bowed. “We dare not disobey the True Lord’s command.”</p><p>The three paused for a moment, waiting for the arrival of the Qiongying Sect party.</p><p>The Qiongying Sect was predominantly female, a disproportionate number of women.</p><p>Sect Master Yan, dressed as a Daoist nun, was beautiful and refined, her brows carrying a majestic air, reflecting her position of authority, making her appear somewhat unapproachable.</p><p>Qin Sang had attended the Liuzhou Hall auction years ago, where he had encountered a senior elder of the Qiongying Sect. Unfortunately, both were in disguise, so they didn’t see each other’s faces.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Sect Master Yan that the Qiongying Sect’s Grand Elder was facing an imminent Heavenly Tribulation and was in seclusion, therefore unable to attend.</p><p>The group traveled on clouds rather than flying artifacts, conversing as they went.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose.</p><p>Upon hearing that Qin Sang wished to learn the art of refining artifacts, Sect Master Yan readily agreed. “It’s an honor for the True Lord to enlighten us.  The humble art of artifact refinement pales in comparison, and I’m afraid it’s hardly worthy of the True Lord’s attention.”</p><p>Qin Sang did not neglect the Poison King and his companion, discussing the art of controlling poison with them.</p><p>With Sect Master Yan’s words preceding him, the Poison King didn't hide anything either.</p><p>The group conversed harmoniously until they reached the Qiongying Sect.</p><p>The Qiongying Sect was located north of Fují River mouth, not far from the East Sea, on Qiongying Lake.  A spirit formation created a mist, concealing the sect gate. Outsiders could only see a spiritual island in the mist, and a small building at the lake's center.</p><p>Little did they know, there was another world beyond the small building.</p><p>Entering the sect, Qin Sang saw countless spiritual islands scattered across the lake, each with stunning and elegant scenery, befitting a sect dominated by female cultivators.</p><p>Sect Master Yan remained true to her word, immediately sending someone to retrieve the sect's scriptures.</p><p>Among them was the "Imprisoning Spirit Technique" that Qin Sang had specifically requested.</p><p>It was not just the incomplete scroll from the auction years ago. The Qiongying Sect had unearthed the Xuanqi Mountain ruins, and after continuous collection, not only had they obtained most of Xuanqi Mountain's legacy, they had also added to and improved upon it through generations of research and understanding by Qiongying's masters, surpassing the original.</p><p>Even the Water Mirror Seven Islands, renowned for their artifact refining skills, admitted to being inferior to the Qiongying Sect.</p><p>This "Imprisoning Spirit Technique" could not only refine pseudo-spiritual treasures, but when cultivated to the highest level, could actually imbue artifacts with sentience, promoting them to genuine spiritual treasures!</p><p>Furthermore, there were subsequent cultivation methods for nurturing spiritual treasures after their advancement.</p><p>However, imbuing spiritual treasures with a spirit was far more difficult than refining them, something Qin Sang was not yet ready to aspire to.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang didn't plan to cultivate the Grey Warbler Sword, obtaining this refining technique was immensely beneficial, broadening her horizons and even providing insights applicable to her Cloud Touring Sword.</p><p>She stayed at the Qiong Ying Sect for over ten days, receiving dedicated guidance from Sect Leader Yan and a master refiner.  She vowed to keep the secrets confidential, but secured an opportunity for Shen Chen.</p><p>During this time, the Poison King and Elder Ming also remained at Qiong Ying Sect.</p><p>After Qin Sang finished learning the refining techniques, the three departed together for Mount Wan Du, without stopping en route.</p><p>Mount Wan Du is located in the sparsely populated state of Man.</p><p>Man is a land of treacherous mountains and rivers.  The cave dwelling occupied by Mount Wan Du is a rare haven, but the mountain gate is shrouded in colorful mist, with various poisonous creatures lurking, reflecting the character of the state.</p><p>After entering the mountain with the Poison King and Elder Ming, Qin Sang found that almost every disciple of Mount Wan Du carried a poisonous insect or beast. Some had even disfigured themselves through careless handling of poison, looking ferocious and ghostly.</p><p>No wonder cultivators from the outside world view Mount Wan Du with fear.</p><p>Somehow, the Poison King had sent a message beforehand.  Upon arrival, Master Xing Ji was already waiting.</p><p>"I apologize for keeping you waiting, Master," Qin Sang greeted him with a smile.</p><p>They entered the main hall.</p><p>After Qin Sang met the elders of Mount Wan Du, the Poison King dismissed everyone else. Master Xing Ji also discreetly withdrew.</p><p>The two sat facing each other, with spirit fruits, immortal peaches, and jade dew on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the jade cup before her.  Mount Wan Du truly was different; the spirit wine within was a deep墨绿色, almost black.  If it weren't for its intoxicating fragrance, one might suspect it was poison rather than wine.</p><p>"Please, True Cultivator Qin, savor our sect's Wan Du Wine!" The Poison King gestured, and they drank a cup together.</p><p>The wine entered Qin Sang's mouth, instantly feeling spicy and burning a path down her throat.  A fiery sensation exploded in her abdomen, surging to her limbs, as if cleansing her entire body—an exhilarating experience.</p><p>"Excellent wine! Thank you for your hospitality!"</p><p>Qin Sang praised it, then sighed, "When you were trapped by the ancient demon, I was deeply concerned for your situation.  Unfortunately, my abilities were insufficient to help."</p><p>"I appreciate your kind concern, True Cultivator," the Poison King said, holding the jade cup, quietly looking at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, in a caring tone, asked, "You must have relied on your sect's sacred artifact to resist the ancient demon, right?  After such a fierce battle, how is the artifact's condition?  Was it damaged?"</p><p>*It's about the sacred artifact!*</p><p>The Poison King's expression darkened.  "Thank you for your concern, True Cultivator. The sacred artifact was severely overtaxed in that battle. Because it's essentially an inanimate object, its recovery is extremely slow.  It's currently being cultivated in the restricted area."</p><p>This was the truth.  The artifact's original form was a five-transformation bloodthirsty miasma spirit.  Unfortunately, Mount Wan Du only obtained a corpse, later refined into a Gu, recovering some of its abilities, but vastly different from a living insect.</p><p>First, controlling the sacred artifact requires mastery of Mount Wan Du's authentic techniques, as it has been continuously refined by successive sect leaders for generations.</p><p>Second, it is extremely difficult to control. The Poison King, as the master of Mount Wan Du, had personally refined it for many years, at a considerable cost.</p><p>Third, after each use, it must be placed in Mount Wan Du's restricted area for an extended recovery period.  During the battle with the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, the artifact was lucky to have absorbed fire poison on Fire Rhinoceros Island; otherwise, it might have sustained irreparable damage.</p><p>However, without these limitations, the artifact probably wouldn't have been available for Qin Sang's visit, as it would have been borrowed by the Saint Hui Guang and the Saint Qinghu long ago.</p><p>In the battle against the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, the cocoon formed by the sacred artifact performed exceptionally well, capable of withstanding attacks from cultivators at the Transcendent stage, making it an invaluable protective treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, pondering for a moment before saying, "Then I'm relieved... To be frank, my visit is to inquire about several questions related to your sect's sacred artifact."</p><p>The Poison King's hand holding the jade cup suddenly stiffened, almost crushing the cup!</p><p>"Is it because the Gu King's level is too low to meet your requirements?"</p><p>A hint of sarcasm flashed in the Poison King's eyes, but his tone remained calm.  "Unfortunately, even if I offered you the sacred artifact, it would be useless in your hands, unless you are willing to switch allegiances and cultivate our Mount Wan Du's authentic techniques…"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly oblivious to the Poison King's anger, curiously asked, "I didn't expect your sect's sacred artifact to have such a unique origin.  I observed that the Gu King and the sacred artifact are quite different in form, yet there's a connection between them.  What is the reason?"</p><p>The Poison King frowned.  This was a closely guarded secret of Mount Wan Du, not to be revealed to outsiders.</p><p>Qin Sang said meaningfully, "While slaying that strange-faced person, I unexpectedly discovered something.  Before dying, that person was backlashed by the Gu King, and because of the remaining sacred artifact poison in their body, the two potent poisons fused, creating an extremely terrifying toxin.</p><p>"I had intended to capture its spirit and extract its memories, but I helplessly watched it disintegrate into nothingness," the cultivator said.</p><p>The Poison King's expression flickered.  The sacred fleece gifted to the Faceless Man by Mount Wan Du was meant to continuously stir the residual poison within him, wearing him down.  They hadn't anticipated the Faceless Man's strength, nor that he would die at another's hand, succumbing to a backlash from the Gu King before his death.</p><p>Sighing, the Poison King said, "Since you, True Jun, have slain that villain, you must have obtained our sect's true scripture, the *Gu Jing*. Have you attempted to cultivate Gu?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, "I have, and to good effect. I have a spirit insect that broke through using this technique."</p><p>"The Gu King itself was born from the Gu cultivation techniques. However, its cultivation not only consumed several rare venomous insects but also incorporated the essence extracted from the corpse of a Bloodthirsty miasma spirit.  Our ancestor, having obtained the corpse, attempted to refine a true Bloodthirsty miasma spirit using Gu cultivation techniques. Unfortunately, a dead thing remains a dead thing, capable only of wielding a fraction of its former power.  Only by splitting its essence and finding a new path could a new Gu insect be refined to inherit the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit's abilities."</p><p>The Poison King glanced at Qin Sang. "Our sect has tried countless times, all failing, until this Gu King miraculously survived.  Because the Gu King and the sacred fleece share a common origin, their poisons are compatible."</p><p>Then it was stolen by the Faceless Man!</p><p>Though Qin Sang hadn't delved into the Faceless Man's origins, he suspected a deep connection to Mount Wan Du, otherwise he wouldn't have had access to the Gu King.</p><p>"From what you say, this Gu King is unique and cannot be replicated?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Poison King said sadly, "I don't even know how it survived... Had I known, I would have guarded it more closely."</p><p>Mount Wan Du's repeated attempts had all failed, proving the near impossibility of success. The Poison King hadn't believed he could succeed, simply following his master's orders.  Now that he had succeeded, only to have it stolen, he deeply regretted it.</p><p>"Perhaps the Gu King's survival is somehow connected to the Faceless Man," Qin Sang mused.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang said, "Your sect expended vast resources cultivating the Gu King. Surely it wasn't merely for a single insect?"</p><p>Before the Poison King could answer, Qin Sang continued, "I kept the Gu King due to my interest in poison manipulation.  I've already put it to another use and can't return it, but I have an idea."</p><p>The Poison King frowned. "True Jun, please enlighten me."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I want to know the true purpose of your sect's Gu King cultivation.  While I no longer possess the Gu King itself, I can control its venom, and perhaps I can still be of assistance."</p><p>The Poison King shook his head. "Unless True Jun is willing to return the Gu King to our sect."</p><p>"I wish to hear it," Qin Sang stated seriously.</p><p>The Poison King paused before replying, "The Gu King's cultivation is related to our sect's true cultivation techniques.  Once the Gu King matures, it would greatly benefit me and future generations of our sect... True Jun, there's no need to say more. If you desire the fused poison, I can give you a vial of poison smoke from the sacred fleece. In return, I would like some of the Gu King's venom."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, seemingly unsurprised.  His intimacy with the poisonous bead, and the bead's absorption of the Gu King, which was akin to his own absorption, had given him a hint.</p><p>Seeing that the Poison King was reluctant to be truthful, he spoke plainly, "Once the Gu King matures, it's meant to merge with, or perhaps devour, the sacred fleece, right?  That's not just a superficial fusion! You are aiming to recreate the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit's original poison, and thereby to verify and comprehend the true meaning of the cultivation technique, and ultimately achieve Ascension, am I correct?"</p><p>The Poison King's face changed.</p><p>Before the Poison King could respond,</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, interrupting him.  "You needn't worry, I'm not here to seize it by force. I wish to discuss a more reliable approach."</p><p>At this point, the Poison King could no longer hide the truth.  He said quietly, "True Jun does not cultivate our sect's techniques. Even if you were given the sacred fleece, you could not recreate the original poison of the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit."</p><p>"How do you know I can't?"</p><p>Qin Sang gave a strange smile.</p><p>He couldn't recreate the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit, but he could absorb the sacred fleece's poison and restore the true Bloodthirsty miasma spirit's original poison, rather than a mere fusion.</p><p>That was the poisonous bead's ability!</p><p>Qin Sang had only discovered this after refining the Gu King, marveling at the fat silkworm's talent.</p><p>The Poison King was astonished.</p><p>"I wish to obtain some of the sacred fleece's poison, without harming the fleece itself, so it can slowly recover. After the fusion, and the acquisition of the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit's original poison, I will share it with you. What do you say?" Qin Sang proposed.</p><p>The Poison King could not refuse. He sighed, "Sadly, the demonic sound has impeded our progress.  Obtaining the original poison of the Bloodthirsty miasma spirit is far too late."</p><p>...</p><p>Months later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Mount Wan Du, traveling southeast to Yan Yue Temple.</p><p>(End)</p>
