<h1>Chapter 1663:  A Glimpse of the Elixir</h1><p>The two exchanged a glance, and the Poison King, understanding the situation, narrowed his eyes.</p><p>A violent wind swirled, forming a vortex.  The poisonous insects, like ethereal serpents, shifted direction with fluid movements.  Simultaneously, the wind darkened, and a black droplet condensed within it, instantly dispersing into a small cloud of black smoke. It grazed past Master Huaiyin and hurtled towards Kun Dao.</p><p>The smoke billowed, moving with astonishing speed, accompanied by a whistling sound.</p><p>Protected by the Poison King, Master Huaiyin was free to retreat swiftly from the battle.</p><p>Kun Dao opened her eyes at some point, fixing her gaze on Master Huaiyin's retreating figure.  Seeing that Master Huaiyin had received help, and that despite his labored breathing, he seemed perfectly fine—his wounds not only not worsening, but visibly healing with new flesh sprouting—Kun Dao stared intensely at him before closing her eyes again.</p><p>Su Zinan and Qin Sang cursed inwardly.</p><p>The smoke appeared to be aimed at Kun Dao, but who could guarantee the Poison King wouldn't have ulterior motives?  They were approaching Kun Dao, placing them within range of the attack.</p><p>The smoke had no unusual odor, seeming ordinary, but considering the Poison King's reputation, it was undoubtedly a potent poison.</p><p>Qin Sang, aided by his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, had some spare attention to observe. He noticed that the smoke originated from a particular insect within the wind vortex.  It was a long, slender insect covered in fine hairs—a caterpillar.</p><p>Such an appearance was too common. Qin Sang could instantly recall dozens of similar insects, but couldn't identify the species in such a short time.  Furthermore, the insects of Wan Du Mountain were notoriously modified by the art of raising and training poisonous insects, making identification even more difficult.</p><p>However, the insect's hairs evoked a sense of familiarity, similar to the hairs given to him by Wan Du Mountain, yet subtly different: finer, lacking the same luster.</p><p>According to the leader of the Seven Fragrant Pavilion, the hairs were taken from a sacred object of Wan Du Mountain, indicating a strong connection between the insect and this object.</p><p>The Faceless Man, poisoned by the sacred object, had been unable to cleanse the poison for hundreds of years, proving its potency. The Poison King's insect would surely be equally dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless.  He diverted a portion of his spiritual energy, activating the poison bead to create a protective layer around his body. With a flick of his wrist, three divine birds spread their wings, taking flight from the trunk, merging into one.</p><p>The breath of the Nan Ming Li Fire clashed with the Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic light and spiritual fire collided, then intertwined, forming towering flames around the Sun God Bird, creating a spectacular scene of breathtaking power.</p><p>Though Su Zinan appeared motionless, his robe billowed, revealing an additional layer of faint blood light.  He stared at Kun Dao, his lips moving as he muttered incantations.</p><p>As he chanted, the death mark on Kun Dao's chest glowed an even deeper crimson, sinking into her body, seemingly attempting to imprint itself onto her inner organs.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Su Zinan saw Kun Dao close her eyes, appearing to give up the struggle.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Sun God Bird blazed a trail of surging flames, its power awe-inspiring.</p><p>Just as Kun Dao was about to be engulfed in the flames, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He saw the cracks beside Kun Dao rapidly expanding, instantly transforming into a black hole with immense suction, pulling Kun Dao down!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The black hole was just the beginning. The Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism went haywire, releasing an astonishingly violent force that caused the void to collapse!</p><p>In an instant, magnetic light formed a storm, countless cracks spawning within it like giant serpents, rushing in every direction. Qin Sang and Su Zinan felt their bodies tense. When they recovered, they found themselves surrounded by the magnetic storm.</p><p>Kun Dao escaped from the Godly Restriction through self-destruction, triggering the violent outburst of the Nine Yuan Earthly Magnetism.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Kun Dao had many options within the Five Elements Godly Restriction; even trapped in a deadly situation, she found a way to escape. Knowing the situation was hopeless, Qin Sang withdrew his control of the Sun God Bird.</p><p>The Sun God Bird subsequently exploded, its spiritual flames shooting skyward, quickly swallowed by the chaotic magnetic storm.  The Poison King's poisonous smoke was also dispersed.</p><p>Su Zinan also felt the death mark slip from his control, and he ceased his incantations.</p><p>Qin Sang, at the heart of the magnetic storm, found himself surrounded by cracks. Though perilous, escaping was not impossible.  He decided to follow the flow, choosing a crack to break free from the Godly Restriction.</p><p>The two exchanged a mental link.  The Poison King understood the situation, his eyes flashing with cold fury.</p><p>A demonic wind howled, forming a vortex.  The poisonous insects, like ethereal serpents, moved lightly, changing direction.  The wind suddenly darkened, and a single black droplet separated from the vortex, instantly dispersing into a small puff of black smoke. It brushed past Master Huaiyin, then hurtled towards Kun Dao.</p><p>The smoke billowed, moving with incredible speed, accompanied by a whistling sound.</p><p>Protected by the Poison King, Master Huaiyin had no further worries and quickly withdrew from the battle.</p><p>Kun Dao opened her eyes at some point, watching Master Huaiyin's retreating figure. Seeing that Master Huaiyin now had help, and observing that despite his labored breathing, Master Huaiyin appeared quite vigorous—his injuries not only hadn't worsened, but were visibly healing, as if about to fully recover—Kun Dao looked deeply at Master Huaiyin once more before closing her eyes.</p><p>Su Zinan and Qin Sang cursed inwardly.</p><p>The smoke seemed aimed at Kun Dao, but could they trust the Poison King wouldn't change his mind? They were approaching Kun Dao and within range of the attack. The smoke had no unusual smell, appearing ordinary, but considering the Poison King's reputation, it was certainly something dangerous – poison smoke.</p><p>Qin Sang, aided by his Sky Eye Butterfly, still had the capacity to observe other details. He saw the smoke originated from a spirit insect within the demonic wind.  The insect was slender, covered in fine hairs – a caterpillar-like creature.  This appearance was far too common. Qin Sang could instantly think of dozens of similar insects, but determining the species in such a short time was impossible.  And, considering the expertise of Wan Du Mountain in raising venomous insects, identifying one after it had undergone their techniques was even more difficult.</p><p>However, the insect's fine hairs gave Qin Sang a sense of familiarity, similar to the hairs Wan Du Mountain had previously given him, but with subtle differences: these hairs were finer and less lustrous.</p><p>According to the head of the Seven Fragrances Pavilion, those hairs came from a sacred object of Wan Du Mountain.  This insect was certainly connected to that sacred object.</p><p>The faceless man had been poisoned by the sacred object of Wan Du Mountain, and had been unable to purge the poison for over a hundred years, highlighting its potency. The Poison King's insects would undoubtedly be equally dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not be careless. He focused a portion of his spiritual energy to activate the poison pearl, forming a layer of anti-poison armor around his body.  With a flick of his wrist, three divine birds took flight from the tree trunk, merging into one. The aura of the Southern Ming Li Fire clashed with the Nine-Yuan Earth Magnetism.  The magnetic light and the spiritual fire collided and intertwined, creating towering flames around the Sun God Bird, a spectacular and awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>While Su Zinan showed no visible movements, his robes billowed, and a layer of faint blood light appeared around him.  He stared at Kun Dao, his lips moving silently as he muttered incantations.</p><p>As he chanted, the death mark on Kun Dao's chest glowed increasingly red, slowly sinking, as if about to be imprinted directly onto her inner body.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Su Zinan saw Kun Dao close her eyes, seemingly surrendering to her fate.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flames from the Sun God Bird surged, its power devastating.</p><p>Just as Kun Dao was about to be engulfed by the flames, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.  The cracks around Kun Dao expanded wildly, instantly forming a black hole, pulling Kun Dao downwards with immense suction!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The black hole was only the beginning.  The Nine-Yuan Earth Magnetism went haywire, an astonishingly violent force spreading rapidly, causing the void to collapse!</p><p>In an instant, the magnetic light formed a storm, countless cracks appearing within it like giant serpents, striking out in all directions.  Qin Sang and Su Zinan felt their bodies tense, realizing they were surrounded by the magnetic storm.</p><p>Kun Dao had escaped the God-Slaying Restriction by self-destruction, triggering the Nine-Yuan Earth Magnetism's fury.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Kun Dao had so many options within the Five Elements God-Slaying Restriction; even trapped, she could find such an escape route.  Knowing the situation was hopeless, Qin Sang withdrew his control over the Sun God Bird.</p><p>The Sun God Bird exploded, its spiritual flames soaring into the sky before being quickly swallowed by the chaotic magnetic storm, the Poison King's poison smoke dissipating at the same time.</p><p>Su Zinan also felt the death mark slipping from his control and stopped his incantations.</p><p>Qin Sang, at the center of the magnetic storm, found cracks everywhere.  While perilous, escaping wasn't difficult.  Following the flow, he chose a crack to break free from the God-Slaying Restriction.</p><p>At that moment, he felt a strange pull, dragging him towards one of the fissures.</p><p>Whether it was the Kun Dao's doing or a change in the Divine Restriction itself, Qin Sang couldn't afford to be passive. He diverted his attention to control the Mani Pearl, vibrating the Gang Fire Shield to resist the pull.</p><p>He swept his gaze around.  His Celestial Eye pierced the darkness, vaguely revealing the scene beyond the fissures.</p><p>The sights varied: some showed stone steps, others, cliff faces, and even a section of wall. The perspective was consistent, clearly within Di Shou Mountain, surrounded by the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Different fissures led to different places.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restriction wasn't a true void restriction; these locations shouldn't be too far apart.</p><p>Old fissures merged into giant ones, and new ones constantly appeared. Their corresponding locations weren't fixed, shifting like fleeting reflections, changing in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, but he didn't rush to escape.  He struggled to maneuver amidst the magnetic storm, shifting his gaze upwards.</p><p>The treasures flung away by Master Huaiyin were scattered and damaged.  Further battered by the magnetic storm, the delicate jade sword emitted a dazzling white light.</p><p>Within the white light, the jade sword snapped in two, its power exhausted, turning to dust.</p><p>Of the two long swords, one was swept away by the magnetic storm. The other hadn't flown far – a woman cultivator's close-combat sword, likely her lifebound spirit sword.</p><p>Qin Sang set his sights on another small sword, a golden one, slightly sturdier than the jade sword.  However, its surface flickered erratically, clearly not lasting much longer.</p><p>The magnetic storm intensified, making movement increasingly difficult. Qin Sang hesitated no longer, dashing towards the golden sword.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>The Gang Fire Shield violently trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed increased threefold.  Ghostly, he brushed past the fissures. As he neared the golden sword, about to retrieve it—</p><p>Suddenly, a black light leaped from a fissure: the woman cultivator's other remaining item – a black jade box.</p><p>The box had fallen into a fissure, but the chaotic magnetic field had thrown it back out.</p><p>The box's restrictions were severely damaged, its lid slightly ajar, releasing a milky white light – a perfectly preserved pill, protected by remaining restrictions!</p><p>A Feishu Pill!</p><p>Useless to the Kun Dao, she hadn't swallowed it. It was meant as a lure if the spirit swords proved insufficiently attractive; now, it was unnecessary.</p><p>The pill appeared.</p><p>But Qin Sang wasn't the only one who saw it. Su Zinan saw it too, and he was closer!</p><p>Su Zinan had just collected a sword, intending to take the woman cultivator's sword as well.  Seeing the pill, he unhesitatingly changed his target, blood light erupting from his palm, forming a giant bloody hand, grabbing for the pill.</p><p>As the blood hand neared, a strange "hum ha" sound echoed in Su Zinan's mind, his soul stinging. The blood hand paused.</p><p>Then, a thunderbolt struck the pill, shattering it instantly.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>Su Zinan's eyes blazed, watching the Feishu Pill turn to ash.</p><p>Ignoring Su Zinan's rage, Qin Sang retrieved the golden sword and fled into a fissure.  Better to destroy the Feishu Pill than let Su Zinan have it!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the magnetic storm, Master Huaiyin and the Poison King retreated repeatedly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's resolve was unwavering.  Neither the tempting remains of the woman cultivator nor his deadly enemy, the Kun Dao, could sway him.</p><p>He turned and charged outwards, avoiding the magnetic storm.</p><p>Master Huaiyin knew his own limitations. While he could escape through the fissures of the Divine Restriction, being sent into the depths of the Five Elements Divine Restriction would be extremely disadvantageous in his current state.</p><p>The Poison King recalled his insects, shielding Master Huaiyin.</p><p>They retreated further and further.</p><p>The scene within the magnetic storm was completely obscured, yet the Poison King remained fixed on it, thoughtful.</p><p>"I was overconfident, nearly losing my life."</p><p>Master Huaiyin clasped his hands, bowing to the Poison King in gratitude.</p><p>The Poison King returned his gaze, accepting the bow and inquired. Learning of Master Huaiyin's resolve to leave, he hesitated, then said, "I'll escort you down the mountain."</p><p>By this time, Master Huaiyin's wounds were almost healed, only a small patch of exposed red flesh visible, no longer showing bone fragments or blood vessels.</p><p>Granulation tissue was growing, quickly filling the wound, a golden light flowing over it, completely sealing it.</p><p>Miraculous!</p><p>The Poison King witnessed this, astounded by Master Huaiyin's powerful recovery ability. He also understood that the wound was only a superficial symptom; the underlying damage was significant, and wouldn't heal so easily.</p><p>No such divine technique existed; even if it did, it would come at a terrible price.</p><p>Master Huaiyin’s strength seemed to be waning; his secret technique must have a time limit, otherwise he wouldn't have readily retreated.</p><p>After some consideration, the Poison King decided to personally escort Master Huaiyin down the mountain, a gesture of goodwill.  He had already figured out the sword formation, so a round trip wouldn't take long.</p><p>The Poison King had only dared to be confident about containing the Strange-faced Man with Master Huaiyin's assistance. Now that his strong ally was severely injured, he needed to reconsider his strategy.</p><p>This act of kindness changed their relationship from a purely transactional one.  If the Strange-faced Man escaped, could Master Huaiyin refuse another request?</p><p>Furthermore, the Poison King was inspired by the Kunda woman.  Di Shou Mountain was a chaotic mix of righteous and demonic cultivators, a situation he could exploit by watching from the sidelines and waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p>This retreat was actually a strategic advance.  He would let the mountain descend into chaos and then reap the rewards—a clever plan indeed.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend."</p><p>Master Huaiyin, expressing his apologies, showed no reluctance.</p><p>Although the magnetic storm had thrown the area into disarray, they could determine the way out by the strength of the Nine-Source Geomagnetic field. The two identified their direction and used their movement techniques.</p><p>During their flight, Master Huaiyin recounted the details of the encounter.  "Su Zinan and the Fire Demon are both formidable opponents. The Fire Demon's protective aura was filled with demonic energy, yet it also subtly contained Buddhist essence. It strangely reminded me of the Shamen's Golden Bell Cover; truly bizarre. Although Su Zinan tried to conceal it, I sensed an incongruous aura within him; I don't know its origin…"</p><p>Even in peril, Master Huaiyin remained vigilant. He then spoke about the Kunda woman in detail, warning the Poison King about her ruthlessness and urging caution.</p><p>The Poison King nodded and asked a few questions, focusing on Qin Sang.</p><p>The information obtained in such haste was limited; Master Huaiyin couldn't provide more details.</p><p>Under the protection of the Poison King and his insect Gu, the female cultivator didn't appear, and the two successfully escaped the Nine-Source Geomagnetic field and reached the outer Five Elements restriction.</p><p>The Poison King diligently escorted Master Huaiyin out of the Mist Tide Formation.</p><p>Stepping out of the Jade Gate, they both looked towards the mountain's exterior.</p><p>In the east of Di Shou Mountain, according to Su Zinan, the Gold and Earth Palaces showed fluctuating restrictions, clearly indicating someone was breaking formations to find treasure.</p><p>A much greater commotion was happening in the southwest.  From afar, they saw streaks of light flashing between the mountains; a large number of cultivators were heading towards the ruins, and the fastest were already halfway there.</p><p>"Daoist friend, please return; don't delay important matters."</p><p>Master Huaiyin paused.</p><p>The Poison King worried about the Kunda woman's return.</p><p>Master Huaiyin shook his head, stood tall, and calmly said, "That woman's abilities are mediocre; she only appears powerful because of the Five Elements divine restrictions. If she dares to pursue us outside the mountain, I will ensure she doesn't return!"</p><p>"Many cultivators from the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate, and various factions are gathering. Master, perhaps you should find a safe place to recover…"</p><p>Seeing his confidence, the Poison King didn't insist and bid him farewell.</p><p>However, Master Huaiyin noticed the Poison King's distraction and bluntly asked, "Daoist friend, what troubles you?  Speak freely."</p><p>The Poison King hesitated, then asked, "Master, do you think Su Zinan and the Fire Demon are capable of killing that thief and the Weeping Spirit Ghost?"</p><p>Master Huaiyin paused, lost in thought.</p><p>"I also think it's impossible," the Poison King shook his head. "That thief and the Weeping Spirit Ghost are birds of a feather; at the very least, they shouldn't have died here. But they haven't been seen since entering the mountain. That thief, who claims to be a descendant of the Wu Xiang Immortal Gate, merely obtained a few lucky scriptures.  Could he be faster than the true descendants, Zi Lei Laodao and the other demonic masters, and ignore the flawed Metal Element divine restriction?"</p><p>The sword formation showed bright stars; if the Strange-faced Man were inside, he couldn't have missed it.</p><p>"If… you suspect someone is the culprit?" Master Huaiyin asked.</p><p>"That elusive female cultivator, taking advantage of the terrain; Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao, acting together—they are all possibilities. However, I think the Fire Demon is also worth considering," said the Poison King, summoning his Gu insect from above and stroking it gently.  "Earlier, to help you, I urged it to release a breath of soul-killing smoke. The poisonous smoke was dispersed by the magnetic storm, greatly weakening its power. Su Zinan had to evade it, but the Fire Demon appeared quite composed… You should know that the thief's foundation lies in Wan Du Mountain, his powers are mostly poison-based; if the Fire Demon has a way to counter poison, it would cripple him. Su Zinan mentioned that the thief and Weeping Spirit Ghost were acting separately. If he provoked the Fire Demon alone, one can imagine the outcome."</p><p>Connecting various clues, the Poison King was getting closer to the truth.</p><p>Master Huaiyin shook his head after listening. "These are all your speculations."</p><p>"Indeed, they are my speculations, but not fantasies; we can verify them later."</p><p>The Poison King put away his insect Gu, bid farewell to Master Huaiyin, and returned to the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were thrown out of the Five Elements restriction.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin went down the mountain.</p><p>Only Mo Xingdao remained in the Nine-Source Geomagnetic field.</p><p>Waiting outside, he soon sensed the Nine-Source Geomagnetic field's violent fluctuations, indicating a great battle inside.</p><p>Mo Xingdao wasn't going to interfere and retreated.</p><p>After some time, the magnetic storm subsided, yet Su Zinan didn't emerge. Mo Xingdao noticed cracks within the storm, guessing Su Zinan wasn't easily killed and might have gone deeper.</p><p>After a brief pause, he returned to the Seven Mansions Sword Formation, found the formation's core, and went through the Five Elements restriction.</p>
