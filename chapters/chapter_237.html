<h1>Chapter 230: The Golden Brick Passage</h1><p>Chapter 230: The Golden Brick Passage</p><p>"After entering the stone tablet, you will encounter a test left behind by the master of the tomb. It is uncertain what it will contain. According to the previously obtained clues, there will certainly be danger, but it will not be a place of certain death. As long as you are careful, you should be able to survive. Those who successfully pass the test and enter the ancient immortal tomb will be able to explore anywhere except for a few dangerous places. Your luck will determine your rewards. In addition, if you discover any signs of abnormality in the tomb, retreat to the entrance immediately. Otherwise, even I will not be able to take care of you and save you..."</p><p>Before entering the black hole, Qin Sang heard Che Yutao's voice transmission.</p><p>The ancient immortal tomb had dangerous places, which was something Qin Sang had long anticipated. Although it was impossible to determine which places they were, he would be able to tell as soon as he entered by observing the power of the restrictions and defensive formations outside those places.</p><p>However, what did Che Yutao mean by 'abnormal'?</p><p>Perhaps, even Che Yutao himself did not know.</p><p>...</p><p>After sending in all the Foundation Establishment disciples, the five Nascent Soul cultivators looked at each other. Sikong Muyue said calmly, "The restrictions that we and the Foundation Establishment juniors encounter are only different in their power. However, the changes in the restrictions follow the same pattern. I believe that all of you fellow Daoists have already mastered this formation?"</p><p>Di Que Old Man chuckled. "There is no need for Fairy Sikong to bother us. It is nothing more than a Nine Radiances Galaxy Formation. It is not difficult for us old fellows."</p><p>Sikong Muyue ignored Di Que Old Man's laughter and reminded him, "We and those juniors are experiencing different tests. The difficulty of the tests will inevitably be in accordance with the strength of Nascent Soul cultivators. Judging from what the clue said, the test will not be simple. Fellow Daoists, you must not underestimate it."</p><p>The five people quickly occupied their respective positions and formed a Nine Radiances Galaxy Formation by themselves. The starry sky above their heads grew deeper and the starlight became brighter. Each one was as dazzling as a full moon.</p><p>"With our strength, we should be able to pass the test. What we fear most is that the things inside have already been looted by the demonic sects, leaving nothing but an empty shell and wasting our time and energy."</p><p>Qing Luo Sect Master Du Yi sighed softly and gently patted the treasure mirror. The light of the mirror enveloped his body, turning it into a star, flying deep into the starry sky, leaving behind this sentence.</p><p>Di Que Old Man cackled, directly tapped his feet, and followed Du Yi closely. "I don't care whether there are treasures in the cave abode. It has nothing to do with me anyway. I am looking forward to you all returning empty-handed. Hahahaha..."</p><p>Just as Che Yutao was about to move, he noticed that Daoist Xuanyu was staring at the black hole with an unusual expression. Curious, he asked, "Old Cow Nose, what are you looking at?"</p><p>Daoist Xuanyu's face was full of thought.</p><p>"If the test in the tomb is reasonable, we can easily enter the tomb with three people at a time after Fellow Daoist Sikong improves the formation. It would be much easier and we could use this place as a training ground for our disciples."</p><p>Che Yutao pondered for a moment. "This place is located in the middle area. Foundation Establishment disciples will not encounter too much danger if they come here alone. It is indeed suitable. However, it is too early to say for sure. Old Cow Nose, you should first think about how to pass the test."</p><p>...</p><p>Upon entering the black hole, the formation was immediately scattered by the force of the restriction and could not be maintained.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a raging sea. His body was completely out of control. He could only watch as the nine people were scattered. He could only allow the force of the restriction to quickly push him towards the stone tablet.</p><p>Having seen what happened to Yun Youzi and the others, Qin Sang was not worried that he would fall to his death. However, he still used all his strength to activate his spiritual energy to protect his body so that he would not be caught off guard by any danger when he entered the stone tablet.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was almost close enough to touch the stone tablet. Then, he was sucked into the stone tablet by a vortex. He felt a sense of dizziness and found himself in an unfamiliar space.</p><p>The golden light was incredibly blinding. Qin Sang's first reaction was to activate his escape technique to hide his figure. Then, he summoned the Ebony Wood Sword to protect his body. Only then did he begin to carefully observe his surroundings.</p><p>At this moment, he was standing in a golden passage.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes and discovered that the top, bottom, and walls of the passage were actually all paved with golden bricks that extended to the end of the passage, where his vision could not reach.</p><p>It had been ten thousand years since the demonic sects had occupied the ancient immortal tomb. Before the demonic sects had discovered the ancient immortal tomb, it had certainly been there for an unknown number of years.</p><p>Until now, the golden bricks in the passage were still as new. There was no sign of aging or damage. They shone with a golden light, making it look very grand.</p><p>The passage was not very wide. It could only accommodate five people walking side by side.</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang appeared until now, the passage had been very quiet. There was no sound at all, and no enemies appeared. He had no idea what the so-called test was.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed that the golden light on the walls of the passage was a little strange. He looked closely and his expression suddenly froze. On the walls, there were actually paintings of golden armored generals.</p><p>On the wall at regular intervals, there is a picture of a golden-armored god, and each of them has a different demeanor.</p><p>What’s common is that they are all wearing full-body golden armor, with face covering, so that the appearance of these golden-armored gods is not visible. All that can be seen are two hollows where the eyes should be, and they are filled with dazzling golden light.</p><p>What’s different is that the golden-armored gods are holding</p><p>various kinds of weapons in their hands, such as sabers, spears, swords, halberds, etc.</p><p>Looking at the picture, you know they are just lifeless things, but Qin Sang always felt that behind the face covering of the golden-armored gods, there seemed to be countless lines of sight targeting him, even though he had hidden into the shadows using Evasion 術.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to be on his guard for a while, but there was still no sign of movement. He pondered secretly, could it be that I have to move forward to start the test?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang looked around. Seeing no one else, he reached over to his waist and swiped it. A green-faced, fanged zombie flew out of the Corpse Puppet Bag and flew forward under Qin Sang’s order.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The zombie turned into a phantom and approached the front two pictures in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the zombie with his eyes and then focused his attention on those two pictures. The moment the zombie passed by the pictures, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed and he thought to himself “so that’s how it is.”</p><p>As soon as the zombie passed between the two pictures, the golden light on the pictures immediately flowed like water. Immediately afterward, the golden-armored gods in the paintings suddenly came to life, their eyes shooting out divine light and the weapons in their hands slashed out lightly. Then they disappeared from the paintings.</p><p>In the next moment, the Corpse Puppet met no obstacles or attacks, but suddenly Qin Sang’s angry shout rang out at the entrance to the passage.</p><p>Qin Sang did not expect that these two golden-armored gods, who had been alerted by the Corpse Puppet, would not kill the Corpse Puppet, but would come straight for himself instead. Moreover, even though he was still in hiding, the golden-armored gods were still able to accurately single him out.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s left and right, two figures of golden-armored gods suddenly appeared out of thin air, surrounding him on both his left and right sides, each wielding an identical golden sword.</p><p>The men had not yet arrived, but their sword energy arrived first.</p><p>Two streaks of golden sword energy cut through the void, slashing diagonally downwards.</p>
