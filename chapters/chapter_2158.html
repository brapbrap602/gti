<h1>Chapter 2148: Past and Present</h1><p>*Click!*</p><p>The tribulation clouds emanated a terrifying aura.</p><p>Golden lightning filled the void, thick and thin strands interwoven into an endless net, like cracks in the fabric of space, tearing the River of Misery into thousands of threads.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword hovered in mid-air, enveloped by the thunder's might, its body shining with a pure, serene light.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, answering the call, fluttered its wings and flew towards the tribulation thunder.  Now was the perfect time to devour it.</p><p>Qin Sang focused her mind on the dantian, silently activating the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal. Immediately, amidst the countless golden tribulation thunders, appeared bolts of green lightning, equally magnificent.</p><p>The sword spirit had just experienced a tribulation of wind; Qin Sang needed to buy it time to recover by deflecting the thunderbolts.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The first wave of tribulation thunder brewed, golden lightning descending like a furious storm, carrying the force to destroy all.</p><p>Unafraid, but rather delighted, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly—Qin Sang could sense its joy—rapidly vibrated its wings, moving like a streak of light through the void, toward the first thunderbolt.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang struck. Green lightning condensed into a thunder seal, which vibrated, manifesting countless green lightning bolts, like electric snakes and pythons, clearly visible beneath the golden tribulation clouds, charging towards the first wave.</p><p>The next moment, the green lightning and golden tribulation thunder collided. The two types of thunder clashed, producing earth-shattering roars, like the fury of Heaven itself. The power of the thunder grew even more violent, capable of destroying the world!</p><p>Some of the tribulation thunder and green lightning annihilated each other, while the rest were intercepted by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly danced joyously amidst the tribulation thunder, enveloped in a layer of golden electric light. The sky-eye patterns on its wings shone, emitting bolts of lightning.</p><p>The tribulation thunder struck the Sky-Eyed Butterfly; some split into countless threads, others merged into the surface layer of electric light, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>During this process, the tribulation thunder's power was being absorbed by the butterfly. The electric threads around it multiplied, forming a golden thundercloud, countless arcs flashing incessantly. Yet, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly still seemed unsatisfied, dragging the thundercloud as it continued to capture new bolts of tribulation thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang, sensing this, withdrew some of the thunder seal's power, diverting the tribulation thunder to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, like a greedy child given a giant golden cotton candy, was overjoyed, devouring it greedily. Fortunately, they were in the River of Misery. If other cultivators were nearby, they would have been shocked by this sight.</p><p>With Qin Sang and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly working together, only a few tribulation thunders from the first wave managed to strike the Yunyou Sword before the attack ended.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, having had its fill, hovered beneath the tribulation clouds, digesting the tribulation thunder's power, awaiting the next wave.</p><p>The tribulation clouds quickly brewed a second wave. Just as Qin Sang was about to act, the Yunyou Sword suddenly let out a clear, resonant sound, its tip slightly rising as it delivered a strike in mid-air.</p><p>The sword light, like a startled rainbow, instantly annihilated countless tribulation thunders.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly continued to joyfully devour the tribulation thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang focused her senses for a moment, confirming the Yunyou Sword was unharmed.  She then subdued the thunder seal's power, mobilized her true energy, and used the sword to break through the thunder!</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, having given birth to a sword spirit with its own will, was still as easy to control as before. No matter what sword technique was used, there was no lag whatsoever.  Between her, the sword spirit, and the spiritual sword, there seemed to be a blood connection, a perfect unity and seamless coordination.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>One sword light after another, continuously cutting at the tribulation clouds.  More and more tribulation thunder was annihilated by the sword light. This continued until the second wave ended.</p><p>Having successfully endured two waves of tribulation thunder without a scratch, Qin Sang didn't dare relax. The tribulation clouds above were becoming thicker, and even more terrifying thunderbolts lay ahead.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The heavenly tribulation stirred the River of Misery, its power impossible to conceal.</p><p>Qin Sang was assisting the Yunyou Sword in its tribulation, making it difficult to attend to the outside.  She could only have the Vermillion Bird patrol the area, guarding against any attracted beasts.</p><p>"Why isn't it over yet?"</p><p>The Vermillion Bird turned its head, looking behind it. Through the thick, murky air, the golden light was barely visible. Even from this distance, it felt a chilling sense of foreboding.</p><p>It and Qin Sang had previously discussed the power of a spiritual treasure's tribulation. Now, it seemed far beyond their estimations.</p><p>At that moment, beneath the tribulation clouds, the Yunyou Sword shone brilliantly.</p><p>The tribulation thunder grew increasingly violent, bombarding relentlessly.  Yet, the small spiritual sword met the thunder head-on, showing no weakness.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly returned to Qin Sang's side.  Having absorbed enough tribulation thunder, she needed time to digest the power within.  Above, only the Yunyou Sword fought alone.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was unusual, his gaze flickering.  At this critical juncture, he slowly closed his eyes, as if gaining some enlightenment.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>This wave of tribulation thunder finally ended.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword hovered high in the air, its tip pointing towards the tribulation clouds, its momentum awe-inspiring.  After countless temperings by the tribulation thunder, its light became even more refined.</p><p>The tribulation clouds surged violently.  The next wave of tribulation thunder was delayed. Golden lightning gathered from all directions towards the center of the clouds, the light blindingly intense.</p><p>Experienced cultivators could tell: the tribulation clouds were brewing the final, and strongest, wave of tribulation thunder!</p><p>'Buzz… buzz… buzz…'</p><p>The Yunyou Sword seemed to sense the danger and trembled incessantly.</p><p>The power of thunder within the tribulation clouds reached its peak.  The thunder's light was as thick as water, illuminating the void.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The thunder roared.</p><p>The tribulation clouds descended, the thunder light pressing down abruptly.  The tribulation thunder's energy exploded, as if a peerless heavenly thunder was about to emerge.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, his pupils flashing with brilliance.  The Yunyou Sword sensed its master's intention, its blue light flaring, its cry shaking the heavens.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword soared into the air, actively striking towards the tribulation clouds!</p><p>A beam of blue light shot towards the sky, visible to the naked eye.  Compared to the vast and heavy tribulation clouds, it appeared slender and tiny, yet it emanated the most sharp sword intent, its edge exposed, pressing forward relentlessly!</p><p>A look of anticipation flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  This sword was no ordinary strike; it contained the might of a sword domain—his strongest strike ever!</p><p>After entering the Void Refinement stage, he frequently contemplated the "Purple Micro Sword Scripture" and the sword light gifted by Elder Tianyue. His understanding of sword domains far surpassed those of cultivators at the same level.</p><p>However, limited by his cultivation, he understood many things superficially but not thoroughly. Even when he grasped certain concepts, he didn't know how to utilize them and integrate them into his swordsmanship.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang mostly used the aura of a sword domain to shock his enemies and enhance the power of his sword formations.</p><p>Perhaps he had been enlightened and broken through a bottleneck, resulting in a powerful breakthrough, or perhaps it was because of the Yunyou Sword's transformation.  Qin Sang received assistance from the spiritual sword, finally integrating his past understandings at this moment.</p><p>No aura of a sword domain permeated the surroundings because Qin Sang was still far from comprehending a Dharma domain. He only grasped a superficial understanding and couldn't deploy a true sword domain, only integrating the might of a sword domain into this one strike. In the eyes of true Nascent Soul cultivators, this would undoubtedly be considered a very rudimentary application, yet its power had undergone a qualitative leap.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The sword light and thunder light collided.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword pierced through, and the imposing tribulation thunder momentarily stagnated before shattering into countless fragments of golden light.</p><p>After severing countless bolts of tribulation thunder, the Yunyou Sword continued its unstoppable advance, its momentum rising.  To Qin Sang's delight, it shattered through layer upon layer of tribulation thunder.  Its light was dazzling, tearing open the tribulation cloud itself!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The thunder roared deafeningly, yet it sounded somewhat disorganized.</p><p>The tribulation clouds ripped apart, violently fluctuating. The lightning within began to dissipate, and the power of the tribulation thunder showed signs of decline.</p><p>No matter how brilliant the thunder light was, it could not compare to the dazzling sword light. One sword dominated the heavens and earth!</p><p>"It's over…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes sparkled.</p><p>That sword strike was truly breathtaking!</p><p>"What's next? Will there be a demonic tribulation?"</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought, secretly considering that the newly born sword spirit was pure and unblemished, and even if there was a demonic tribulation, it could easily be overcome.</p><p>However, the Yunyou Sword was different from other spiritual treasures. It contained a trace of Yunyouzi's true nature. If Yunyouzi were to be reborn and face a demonic tribulation surpassing the Void Refinement tribulation, the outcome was uncertain.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang's heart tightened.  Yet, he saw the Yunyou Sword continue without stopping, like a fish in the ocean, weaving through the tribulation clouds, cutting the remaining tribulation thunder into pieces.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang sensed a strange fluctuation in the sky.  The tribulation clouds hadn't yet dissipated, and golden light floated in the clouds, seemingly giving birth to something similar to Imperial Liquid, which was instantly devoured by the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>The consciousness within the sword finally solidified.</p><p>Qin Sang understood:  the birth of a sword spirit truly involved the work of Heaven!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Sword light pierced the tribulation clouds, shooting out before abruptly stopping in front of Qin Sang, revealing the true form of the spirit sword.  A flowing azure aura shimmered across the blade, revealing a young boy in blue.</p><p>The boy was exquisitely sculpted, with clear eyes and handsome features, appearing to be six or seven years old.  Yet, his brow held a composure that belied his appearance.  He formally bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Yun You, the sword spirit, greets Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression stiffened.</p><p>Tian Mu Butterfly flew before the boy in blue, seemingly observing him.  The Five Elements Crown in Qin Sang's sleeve trembled, and Xiao Wu emerged, standing beside Qin Sang, tilting her head curiously.</p><p>Seeing the butterfly and Xiao Wu, the boy in blue politely bowed, saying, "Yun You greets Sister Butterfly, Sister Xiao Wu."</p><p>Xiao Wu giggled, clutching Qin Sang's robe.</p><p>Tian Mu Butterfly fluttered her wings, circling the boy, her tail feathers scattering beautiful stardust – a display of her joy.</p><p>Qin Sang twitched his mouth, then asked, "How much of the past do you remember?"</p><p>The boy in blue pondered, then said, "Since my awakening, I've understood certain things. Only those people and things closely associated with Master, and only after my spirit reached a certain level, have left a deep impression on me."</p><p>"In other words, you remember nothing before that?" Qin Sang's gaze was complex.</p><p>The boy bowed, "Please enlighten me, Master."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, then sighed softly, "Your origins are complex, and it begins with another person. However, we can't stay here long; let's leave."</p><p>Zhu Que, sensing the dissipation of the heavenly tribulation, returned. Hearing the story, her eyes lit up, "Little one, call me Senior!"</p><p>"Senior Zhu Que," the boy said obediently.</p><p>"Ah! So well-behaved!  More likeable than that butterfly," Zhu Que chuckled.</p><p>Tian Mu Butterfly's eyes blinked, giving Zhu Que a withering look. Zhu Que had repeatedly tried to take her away from Qin Sang, but always failed.</p><p>Fortunately, this tribulation didn't attract any ferocious beasts. After the tribulation dissipated, the river of suffering returned to normal, and no beastly auras remained nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang sped away from the place of the tribulation.</p><p>Along the way, he told the boy everything.</p><p>His friendship with Yun Youzi, Yun Youzi's experiences, his resolute decision against reincarnation, and most importantly, that the sword spirit was born from Yun Youzi's true spirit.</p><p>He even revealed his unwavering goal to help Yun Youzi be reborn, hoping Yun Youzi could be reborn through this.</p><p>The sword spirit clearly had its own will, essentially an independent being. Over time, as it developed its own life and memories, it would become less likely to accept that it was another person.</p><p>Unless he could keep it a secret forever, the day the sword spirit discovered the truth could upend its existence. Even with their shared life force and blood connection, a rift might form in their bond.  It was better to tell the sword spirit now.</p><p>A disconnect between a master and the spirit of their life-bound sword was disastrous. This was why most cultivators chose to refine their spiritual treasures into true treasures rather than relying on later-created spiritual treasures.</p><p>"I, too, don't know if you are or aren't considered Senior Yun Youzi,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He searched meticulously, confirming that Yun Youzi's true spirit was gone, replaced by the sword spirit. Yet, Yun Youzi's memories hadn't been recovered; there was no trace of Yun Youzi in the sword spirit.</p><p>Was this rebirth successful?</p><p>If Yun Youzi knew this result beforehand – that he couldn't regain himself even after rebirth – would he still choose not to reincarnate?</p><p>Qin Sang was confused.</p><p>The boy, addressing him as "Master," left Qin Sang wondering how he should treat him – as Senior Yun Youzi or as Yun You, the sword spirit.</p><p>Yun Youzi's true spirit was gone, transformed into the sword spirit Yun You. Qin Sang didn't know what he could still do, or if he still had a chance to help Yun Youzi restore his true self.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the boy remained calm, pondering for a moment before speaking earnestly,</p><p>"Master mentioned the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>"My past self was Yun Youzi, Master's close friend. My present self is Yun You, the sword spirit.</p><p>"If there's a chance to restore my true self, since we were once one, Yun You is willing to cooperate with Master in any attempt to find my past self.</p><p>"Until then, I am Yun You, the sword spirit.</p><p>"Without Master, there would be no Yun You, the sword spirit.  My gratitude is immeasurable! It's only natural that I and Sister Xiao Wu address you as Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the boy. The sword spirit was far more open-minded than he'd imagined.  Qin Sang could sense his words were sincere and genuine.</p><p>The sword spirit's acceptance of Yun Youzi was the best possible outcome.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang seemed to make a decision, nodding. "Good! From now on, you are Yun You, the sword spirit!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Event Started!</p><p>From September 1st to October 15th,  *Knock on the Immortal Path* is holding a fan art contest.
