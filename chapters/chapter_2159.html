<h1>Chapter 2149  The Thunder Pearl</h1><p>This tribulation yielded the greatest benefit to Tianmudie, who has already returned to slumber and digest the power of the tribulation thunder.  Beyond that, only Yunyoujian itself gained much.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about Yunyou's feelings before the breakthrough, hoping for some experience to help the Five Elements Crown advance, but Yunyou couldn't explain much, having been a hazy, unformed spirit before taking shape.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had developed a spirit long ago. Little Five, having experienced both the mundane world and seclusion, could control the demonic intent within, yet the breakthrough opportunity had yet to arrive.</p><p>The situations of Yunyoujian and the Five Elements Crown are vastly different, making them unsuitable for comparison; they can only patiently wait.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang returned to the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>At the appointed time, Shaoshi visited again, bringing the Thunder Pearl, with Silu accompanying him.</p><p>Welcoming Peak.</p><p>On the jade table between Qin Sang and Shaoshi, rested a pearl the size of an infant's fist.  The pearl emitted a dazzling light, shimmering like lightning, with rumbling thunder echoing through the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely; the interior seemed to contain a compressed thunder domain, a miniature universe. Countless tiny lightning bolts constantly formed and dissipated within, unable to escape the pearl yet radiating genuine thunderous might, a truly awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>Shaoshi, relaxed and confident in this treasure, smiled gently. "Master Qin, may you explore this treasure with your spiritual sense."</p><p>"Is this treasure artificially refined or a natural wonder?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, asking this because he sensed no trace of artificial refinement.  Of course, the crafting method might simply be unknown to him.  </p><p>He could confirm that the pearl lacked sentience; it wasn't a spiritual treasure.</p><p>"I do not know! This treasure was obtained from an unclaimed hidden realm within the Saint Lands; its true origin is unknown. It might be a natural wonder, or perhaps crafted by some ancient master," Shaoshi explained. "The Emperor has invited several cultivators who control the Mirage Towers to a banquet. If Master Qin has no objections, you may begin refining this treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. After a thorough examination revealing nothing unusual, he needed only to verify the treasure's power as described by Shaoshi to solidify their pact.</p><p>The Saint Lands of the Yi Ren Clan would then be open to him!</p><p>"I humbly accept!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the Thunder Pearl floated into his palm.</p><p>He closed his eyes, activating his true essence and spiritual sense to penetrate and sense the interior of the Thunder Pearl.  The original owner had left no mark, no opposing spirit-embryo, and Qin Sang faced no resistance during refinement – the process was remarkably smooth.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang refined the Thunder Pearl. Its divine light subsided, appearing much more ordinary.</p><p>"Master Qin, how do you feel?" Shaoshi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "The treasure's power is indeed as Daoist Si said.  However, I cannot be certain whether the Thunder Oath will exceed its limits."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Silu. "Daoist Silu, I would be grateful for your assistance in opening the Thunder Altar again!"</p><p>Silu readily agreed, rising and departing for Xitu Jing.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhuque and Su Nu headed for Canglang Jing and Beihai Jing respectively, to activate the core branch altars.</p><p>"Daoist Si, come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and left the temple with Shaoshi, arriving at a vast, uninhabited wilderness where they would seal the thunder talisman.</p><p>"Please wait here, Daoist Si."</p><p>A hill with a stone platform was located here. Qin Sang placed the Thunder Pearl on it and returned alone.</p><p>Within the Green Sheep Temple, clouds and mist billowed, the protective formation activated.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the forbidden area, activating his true essence. The thunder altar in the valley vibrated, sending lightning soaring towards the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, a phantom thunder altar appeared above the Green Sheep Temple.  The other branch altar masters simultaneously felt it, and under Silu's guidance, immediately began their incantations, resonating with the main altar.</p><p>The Green Sheep Region's Thunder Altar array reappeared!</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the altar, his mind merging with it, activating the thunder talisman engraved within.  Shaoshi, observing from nearby, though partially obscured by the Green Sheep Temple's protective array, could vaguely see the phantom thunder altar in the air. Looking up at the zenith and surveying his surroundings, he sensed the immense might of the thunder, and the altar's impending activation!</p><p>Despite having witnessed the power of the Thunder Oath, Shaoshi was still secretly startled. Even with caution, he wasn't confident in escaping unharmed once targeted by the thunder talisman.</p><p>If he could seal this thunder talisman within the Thunder Pearl, it would be an incredibly strong asset within the Saint Lands!</p><p>Shaoshi suppressed his inner turmoil, intently sensing the changing power of the thunder altar.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>After several decades, the countless beings in the Green Sheep Region once again felt the terrifying might of Heaven, trembling in fear.</p><p>The Five Thunder Temple had sent out talismans in advance, summoning everyone, including the common people, so the celestial phenomenon did not cause significant unrest.</p><p>The birds and beasts of the mountains were terrified, sensing an impending catastrophe.  Dark clouds blotted out the sun, and thunder roared.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the masters of Zhutan performed their rites, the celestial phenomena grew more terrifying.  Finally, the Ritual Thunder Decree was activated!</p><p>Thousands of lightning bolts pierced the heavens, the earth's energy surged wildly, lightning pythons writhed, and electric serpents darted, countless bolts hurtling towards Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Shaoshi watched the hilltop intently. Suddenly, Qin Sang appeared, nodded slightly, and also looked towards the sky.</p><p>Where the thunder converged, a ball of green lightning formed.  This descended, revealing a sheet of green lightning paper, which gently fluttered down.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. He channeled his energy, activating the *Baoshu*. The jewel rose on its own, hovering above him, radiating light.</p><p>The *Baoshu* and the Ritual Thunder Decree, one above the other, resembled two bolts of lightning about to collide.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath the lightning, performing hand seals, repeatedly striking the *Baoshu*.  The jewel's radiance intensified until its form seemed to melt into the light, the luminescence shimmering and shifting.</p><p>The light then expanded, quickly forming a huge silver sphere. The sphere itself was ethereal, with lightning flashing within, but it appeared more like an image or illusion, not truly solid; the jewel's physical form seemed to disappear.</p><p>With the silver sphere created, the Ritual Thunder Decree was close at hand. The silver sphere was far larger, seemingly poised to engulf the decree.</p><p>Qin Sang controlled both.  With a thought, the lightning on the Ritual Thunder Decree subsided, restraining its power to prevent an outburst.</p><p>The green lightning paper, light as a feather, drifted onto the silver sphere. The sphere's edge seemed empty; the decree passed through without resistance, entering the sphere's interior.</p><p>If the silver sphere could contain the Ritual Thunder Decree, and the decree remained stable, the sealing would be successful.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change!</p><p>Black lightning erupted around the Ritual Thunder Decree, like fissures in the void, rapidly spreading within the sphere.</p><p>The Shaoshi's face changed, watching the silver sphere anxiously.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The silver sphere could no longer withstand the onslaught; more and more black lightning appeared, causing it to collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared for this, instantly cast a prepared spell to isolate the Ritual Thunder Decree and the chaotic energies surrounding it.</p><p>While he could use the Ritual Thunder Decree, he couldn't fully control its power. Every action required extreme caution; disruption of the internal balance could cause an explosion, potentially injuring him.</p><p>The Ritual Thunder Decree hung motionless.</p><p>The illusion within the silver sphere rapidly crumbled, and a streak of light sprang forth – the *Baoshu*. Qin Sang's timing was perfect; the jewel's physical form was unharmed.</p><p>Reflecting on the process, Qin Sang realized the cause of failure: the power of the Ritual Thunder Decree exceeded the *Baoshu*'s capacity.</p><p>However, having only recently obtained the *Baoshu*, and this being his first attempt, failure was expected.  He would not give up.</p><p>After reviewing the process, he identified several oversights and devised countermeasures, and resumed activating the *Baoshu*.</p><p>The silver sphere reappeared; the Ritual Thunder Decree trembled slightly, and once again entered it. Black lightning appeared again, repeating the previous collapse.  Qin Sang retrieved the *Baoshu*.</p><p>"Master Qin?"</p><p>The Shaoshi felt a bad omen and called out.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently, and after a moment's thought, tried again.</p><p>Within a dozen breaths, he had attempted six times, all failing, yet the Shaoshi saw a glimmer of hope; the silver sphere lasted longer each time.</p><p>Seventh attempt!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Ritual Thunder Decree.  As time passed, the thunder's power continued to build, nearing its breaking point. He had at most three more attempts.</p><p>The silver sphere again contained the Ritual Thunder Decree.  The black lightning was still present, but noticeably less and thinner.</p><p>As the Ritual Thunder Decree slowly descended into the sphere, the black lightning rapidly increased.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A huge black fissure pierced the sphere, signifying the seventh collapse of the silver sphere!</p><p>And the eighth... another collapse!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath, gazing at the *Baoshu* before him.  Eight attempts; he had done almost everything he could, using all his ingenuity.</p>
