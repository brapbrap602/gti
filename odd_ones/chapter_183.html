      “What is it?” Yang Dian tried to regain his focus and went up to
                the laptop screen. Then he, too, was stunned.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The files on the thumb drive were a part of the data that Han
                Xiao had gotten from hacking into the research institution.
                Every research project of the Death Virus was clearly written to
                be regarding enhancing physical abilities and biochemistry
                weapons. There was no mention of the cure Kate talked about.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was also written that the exploration team that had gone into
                the Robert Forbidden Zone had been gathering materials for
                physical ability enhancements research.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Th-this is real? Could he be lying?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He could have killed us easily. Why would he lie to us?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yang Dian and Ned slowly turned from consternation to rage.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It turned out that they were like two idiots from the start to
                the end, toyed with by the people of Louis Research Institution.
                They could not believe that they were so naive to have believed
                the one-sided words of these people; it made them feel like
                their persistence was nothing but a joke.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      No wonder the mysterious warrior in the mechanical suit did not
                kill them; he probably felt that they were pathetic and pitiful,
                so he told them the truth.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yang Dian was so ashamed and embarrassed that he wanted to dig a
                hole in a ground and hide in it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They kept calling themselves superhero, but they were saved by a
                stranger who they deemed wicked twice! If the mysterious man had
                not exposed the truth, they would still have been totally in the
                dark.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Too bad we don’t know his name. If we did, l definitely would
                apologize to him in person.” Ned was upset.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yang Dian nodded heavily. With raging anger burning inside, he
                called Kate. “You have been lying to us!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Kate sounded stunned. “What did I lie about?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “You have been using us. You made us risk our lives to do things
                for you. The exploration team, the cure to the virus, that was
                all fake!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What are you talking about? Why would I do that? You are
                overthinking this.” Kate’s made an unnatural pause.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I have evidence. The research of the Death Virus has nothing to
                do with saving lives!” Yang Dian said.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “That’s fake. You guys must’ve heard rumors,” Kate replied
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Still lying to us‽” Yang Dian was angry, he then stated the
                project serial number.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The other side of the phone remained silent for a while, then
                Kate replied in a cold tone—he gave up pretending. “So what?
                What do you want to do, or rather, what can you do?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I…” Yang Dian was furious, but he suddenly jammed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Humph, Superhero!” Kate’s tone was full of sarcasm as he hung
                up the call.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yang Dian held the phone and froze in place. His aura was
                changing quickly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ned suddenly felt a chill. He quickly asked, “Are you alright?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Yang Dian shook his head and put down the phone. “I’m alright,
                Why wouldn’t I be? Hehe.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He laughed inexplicably.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The research institution was in a mess. The high ranked
                officials were sweating all over as they negotiated with the
                military.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Kate was annoyed. He did not expect things to have turned out
                this way when he lured the wolf into the room. No one had dared
                to mess with the research institution before. They had many
                financial organizations behind them, and anyone who stroked the
                tiger’s beard would face its wrath—they would be chased down by
                organizations with no escape.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After contacting the financial organizations backing them, the
                organizations were all understandably furious. He called himself
                Germinal Organization’s executive officer Heisenberg, and he had
                a mechanical suit with extremely advanced technology—it was
                quite convincing. The Germinal Organization was like a mouse
                crossing the street. Everyone wanted to beat them. It would not
                matter how many enemies they made, and it was very possible that
                they were throwing the helve after the hatchet.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The financial organizations decided to not only let Western
                Continent’s Intelligence organizations look thoroughly for this
                person, but they were also going to give money to the Six
                Nation’s expedition through military donations.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The reason behind these financial organizations having such an
                exaggerated reaction was because there were drugs that the
                owners of these organizations urgently needed among the stolen
                stock. Therefore, they desperately needed it back even if it
                meant they had to spend more money!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Kate was already annoyed enough. He did not even want to bother
                about the questioning from the two superheroes, and he did not
                care at all about them finding out the truth.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Because superheroes would never take revenge for such small
                matter
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Thus, Kate was calmed and had nothing to fear.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had taken off the mechanical suit, changed his face and
                mixed into the crowd.

      Han Xiao waited for some time, but there were no new
                notifications.
      <em class="calibre7">
       That’s it? What do I need the good impression from these two
                  guys for?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had never even heard of these two guys before, so they were
                probably not anyone important.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was speechless. It was a reasonable reward, but he
                would have even preferred experience points over this.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Never mind, it’s just a small mission. The biggest rewards
                  are these drugs.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao chuckled as he looked down at the bulging package in
                his hands.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When he stole… that’s wrong, when he requisitioned the drugs,
                Han Xiao took everything in the exhibition room of Louis
                Research Institution, which was almost every type of drug.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He found a random small hotel and checked in. As usual, he first
                checked to see if there were surveillance cameras, then he
                opened his backpack and took out all the various drugs before
                arranging them in rows.

     <div class="chapter-c">

      Han Xiao rubbed his hands. He had heard that one would be lucky
                if one’s hands were heated.

      Han Xiao stunned for three seconds. Then he stood up in rage and
                threw it on the floor.

      Looking at this pile of colorful drugs, Han Xiao felt as if a

      He continued searching. There was a total of 34 types of drugs,
                and luckily, there was not another one that was as useless as
                the Green Lizard drug.

                the rare talent was at least three times higher.

      There were three types of drugs—temporary enhancement drugs,

       Some of the permanent attribute boost drugs can only be used
                  once, and some can be used multiple times. The Eagle Predator
