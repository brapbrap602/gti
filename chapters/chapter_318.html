Chapter 311: Half Recovered


Unfortunately, at the time, he was also on the verge of spiritual exhaustion and didn't dare to leave Luo Xingnan alive. Otherwise, he could have refined another mid-Foundation Establishment stage living corpse.  To refine a living corpse, he still lacked the Soul-Guiding Grass required for the Celestial Corpse Talisman. Qin Sang had contacted the cultivator in charge of the Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion through Yun Youzi and asked them to keep an eye out for it.

Qin Sang was now very proficient in refining malevolent corpses. He just needed to follow the established procedure. Without any mishaps, he successfully refined the corpse.

He controlled the malevolent corpse to attack him to test its strength. He nodded in satisfaction. It was stronger than the previous ones he had refined, almost exactly as described in the *Celestial Yin Corpse Art*.  It would be a powerful helper.

After storing it in his Corpse Puppet Pouch to slowly nurture its Yin energy, he began closed-door cultivation, waiting for Yun Youzi's news.
…

One year later.

Qin Sang sensed someone triggering the restrictions around his cave and awoke from his meditative state.

He checked his spiritual sea, then got up and walked out of the cave. Seeing Yun Youzi outside, his face rosy and full of energy, Qin Sang was overjoyed. "Senior, you've recovered?"

Yun Youzi nodded with a smile. "Thanks to that thousand-year-old Misty Herb, otherwise, it would have taken me several more years. Brother Qin, I've had the Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion prepare an alchemy chamber, and all the auxiliary herbs have been gathered. We can start refining the pill."

Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a surge of nervousness. He inwardly mocked himself for being so impatient. Suppressing his restlessness, he followed Yun Youzi to the alchemy chamber.

The Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion had discovered an underground fire vein in the snowy mountains. The alchemy chambers were built there, using the earth fire for refining. Some chambers were rented out, while the two with the most stable earth fire were reserved for the sect's experts.

Entering the cliff face and descending the stone steps, Qin Sang felt the surrounding air grow hotter and hotter as they went deeper underground. Finally, they were stopped by guards. Qin Sang handed the Yellow Essence with Profound Markings to Yun Youzi and watched him enter the passage leading to the innermost alchemy chamber. Then, he waited outside.

Three days passed in a blink of an eye.

Yun Youzi still hadn't emerged.

Qin Sang's nervousness had long since subsided. He sat in meditation with a calm expression, patiently waiting.

He knew that alchemy wasn't easy. Some alchemists would even seclude themselves in the alchemy chamber for a whole month to achieve a state of perfect tranquility, increasing their chances of success, even if only slightly.

Four days.

Five days.

…

Ten days passed.

Finally, faint footsteps echoed from the passage. Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes and stood up.

Under Qin Sang's expectant gaze, Yun Youzi didn't keep him in suspense. With a smile, he said, "I have succeeded!"

Even with Qin Sang's composure, he couldn't help but let out a long sigh of relief, a weight lifting from his heart. Then, he saw Yun Youzi wave his hand to create a barrier, a jade bottle in his other hand.

Inside the bottle, a single pill immediately captured Qin Sang's attention.

The pill emitted a rich, profound yellow light, with faint profound markings shimmering on its surface, remarkably similar to those on the Yellow Essence with Profound Markings.

This was the Profound Harmony Pill!

Qin Sang had heard descriptions of the Harmony Pill. It was supposed to be moon-white and without these markings. The Profound Harmony Pill was clearly different, likely due to the change in the primary ingredient.

Taking the jade bottle, Qin Sang opened it. No scent emanated from within, but the profound yellow light on the pill suddenly intensified, gushing outwards like a spring.

Qin Sang quickly closed the bottle and bowed to Yun Youzi in thanks.

"You've gone to great lengths, Senior!"

Yun Youzi shook his head. "Brother Qin, I still need to refine the Nine-Flower Azure Frost Grass, so I won't see you off. There are a few things you need to remember when taking this pill. First, your spiritual sea must be completely full. Second, don't be impatient. You must be undisturbed and slowly refine the medicinal power…"

After carefully listening to the instructions, Qin Sang bid farewell to Yun Youzi.  Leaving the alchemy chamber, he couldn't wait to summon his sword, transforming into a streak of light as he hurried back to his cave.

He reinforced the restrictions outside his cave with several additional layers.

Sitting cross-legged on his ice bed, Qin Sang placed the jade bottle in front of him. He closed his eyes and meditated, circulating his cultivation technique for more than a dozen cycles until he reached peak condition.

Then, he paused his breathing, his divine sense sweeping open the jade bottle. He lifted the Profound Harmony Pill to his lips and swallowed it without hesitation.

The moment the pill entered his mouth, it transformed into a cool medicinal power that flowed down his throat and into his stomach.

Qin Sang focused his mind intently on this medicinal power, ensuring that not a single bit was wasted.

Unlike the Nine Yang Pill, which carried a distinct Yang energy, the medicinal power of the Profound Harmony Pill was very gentle. After merging with his meridians, it began to circulate throughout his body, like a spring rain, nourishing him silently.

However, Qin Sang could feel his body undergoing a significant transformation. His damaged foundation began to show signs of recovery, filling him with ecstasy.

The Profound Harmony Pill was working!

The most obvious change from the foundation's recovery came from his spiritual sea.  Although it had been full before taking the pill, it now felt slightly inadequate.

The spiritual energy within the cave stirred, converging towards Qin Sang. However, he only absorbed an extremely thin strand of it, and the absorption rate was very slow.

Nevertheless, the absorption was continuous.

During this process, another change occurred in Qin Sang.

If someone else had been present in the cave, they would have seen Qin Sang's appearance subtly become younger.  He had looked to be in his thirties, but now he appeared to be in his late twenties.

Qin Sang had no time to pay attention to his appearance. He was intently focused on his spiritual sea, his mood no longer as excited as before, even somewhat heavy.

The change in his spiritual sea had been most pronounced immediately after taking the Profound Harmony Pill, but as time passed, it slowed down, eventually coming to a complete halt when his foundation had recovered by fifty percent.

The Profound Harmony Pill had only restored half of his damaged foundation!

Qin Sang's face was filled with frustration. He tried to forcibly refine the remaining medicinal power, but time slowly passed, and no matter how hard he tried, the recovery rate remained negligible, almost non-existent.  It was a complete waste.

After numerous attempts, Qin Sang had to accept reality.

One Profound Harmony Pill was not enough to fully heal him.

The closer he got to full recovery, the more difficult it would likely become. Qin Sang couldn't guess how many pills like the Profound Harmony Pill he would need to restore his foundation completely.

Now, the medicinal power of the Profound Harmony Pill began to dissipate. If he didn't act decisively, it would all be wasted.

Qin Sang sighed inwardly and calmed himself.

Regardless, he had recovered half of it, hadn't he?

The remaining medicinal power could be used to improve his cultivation.  It wouldn't be a complete waste.

Having made his decision, Qin Sang activated his spiritual sea, absorbing all the remaining power of the Profound Harmony Pill.  His cultivation level began to climb rapidly.

Silence returned to the cave.

Qin Sang sat motionless on the ice bed, the aura around him rising swiftly.

The frustration on his face gradually faded, eventually giving way to complete tranquility.
