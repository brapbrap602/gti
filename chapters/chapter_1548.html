<h1>Chapter 1539: The Śarīra (4k)</h1><p>Only one Venerable remained in Zhulan Temple.</p><p>After Qin Sang and Liu Li conferred, they decided to seize it by force!</p><p>Liu Li used the Moonlight Bodhisattva to pique Venerable Chengyuan's interest, luring him to the front temple while secretly casting the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Formless and immaterial, the Ice Soul Divine Light was one of the most suitable divine abilities for ambushes in the cultivation world.</p><p>Liu Li kept the divine ability concealed, and despite Venerable Chengyuan controlling Zhulan Temple's protective spiritual formation, he failed to detect anything unusual about Liu Li.</p><p>When Venerable Chengyuan appeared,</p><p>Liu Li didn't utter a word and directly attacked.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light suddenly erupted!</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>The sound of freezing abruptly echoed through the void.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the sound was drowned out by Venerable Chengyuan's furious roar.</p><p>However, by the time he heard the sound and noticed the anomaly, he had already been struck.</p><p>Without any warning, the void around Venerable Chengyuan solidified. Having shifted here from the cliff face, he had essentially walked into a trap, delivering himself into the heart of the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan hadn't anticipated anyone audacious enough to strike within Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Relying on the protective spiritual formation, he could wield power exceeding his cultivation realm!</p><p>Azure light burst forth.</p><p>A chilling aura pervaded the air.</p><p>Ice congealed out of thin air within the void, rapidly spreading.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's figure appeared within the ice. His furious face, wrinkles deepened, appeared somewhat distorted and comical due to the refracting ice.</p><p>Liu Li held nothing back, urging the Ice Soul Divine Light to its peak. With a planned attack against an unsuspecting target, Venerable Chengyuan had indeed fallen prey.</p><p>Inside the ice, chilling qi materialized, swiftly spreading and converging, threatening to engulf Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>If sealed by the Ice Soul Divine Light, Venerable Chengyuan would be left at their mercy.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thin layer of ice spread across Venerable Chengyuan's kasaya.</p><p>The chill had penetrated his protective True Essence, invading his body.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan seemed trapped!</p><p>The situation appeared dire, yet Venerable Chengyuan's eyes held no trace of panic.</p><p>The opponent's cultivation was high, their divine ability extraordinary, but they hadn't chosen the right time or place.</p><p>Unless the opponent could disrupt the protective spiritual formation or sever Chengyuan's control over it, such a tactic couldn't pose a fatal threat.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan believed that this Daoist nun, having reached such a realm, couldn't be foolish. Had she not considered the influence of the protective formation?</p><p>Since she had acted thus, there must be a reason!</p><p>As the crisis approached, Venerable Chengyuan calmly analyzed the situation.</p><p>Zhulan Temple, allied with the six other great temples, occupied the seven oases of the Vast Sea, expelling other forces, and had indeed provoked many enemies. But among them, this Daoist nun was unfamiliar.</p><p>They had no prior grievances.</p><p>The opponent's intent didn't seem to be to kill him.</p><p>In an instant, a flash of insight struck Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>“Sutra Repository! Treasury!”</p><p>This person was a decoy!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan suddenly understood. The Daoist nun's accomplice must be lurking within Zhulan Temple!</p><p>The Daoist nun's purpose wasn't revenge but to lure him to the front temple, allowing her accomplice to steal treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li's plan was indeed simple, never intending to completely deceive Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>However, even if Venerable Chengyuan discerned their intent, his first thought was of the Sutra Repository, which housed cultivation manuals and secret techniques, and the treasury.</p><p>Who would have guessed their true target was the Pagoda Forest, where the remains of past generations of eminent monks were enshrined?</p><p>“Petty thieves!”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan flew into a rage. A buzzing sound emanated from within him, resonating like a great bell throughout Zhulan Temple, shaking the hearts of all who heard it.</p><p>Intense Buddhist light surged from Venerable Chengyuan, faintly revealing the phantom of a bronze bell, inscribed with thirteen horizontal lines, each space between depicting Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.</p><p>As the bell phantom erupted from him, the ice encasing Venerable Chengyuan shattered. However, the Ice Soul Divine Light wasn't so easily dispelled. The bell phantom, hastily formed, quickly frosted over, then cracked, on the verge of shattering.</p><p>However, the time bought by the bell phantom was enough for Venerable Chengyuan to activate the formation again and shift away from danger!</p><p>“Return to the mountain, close the temple!”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's shout echoed throughout Zhulan Temple.</p><p>The monks of Zhulan Temple, hearing the furious shouts and sounds, were still bewildered, unsure of what was happening. In their panic, they heard their ancestor's command and rushed towards the rear mountain.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's figure vanished before Liu Li's eyes.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light struck empty air.</p><p>Liu Li had anticipated this. Ignoring the dumbfounded Supervising Monk beside her, she glanced towards the Pagoda Forest at the rear mountain, then, instead of retreating, advanced, flitting up the mountain.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's figure reappeared above the Sutra Repository.</p><p>The temple's treasures were paramount.</p><p>Therefore, Venerable Chengyuan, without waiting to settle the score with Liu Li, decisively shifted back to the rear mountain to prevent thieves from taking advantage of the chaos.</p><p>The Sutra Repository was located at the mountain peak, with the treasury adjacent.</p><p>Having just reappeared, Venerable Chengyuan flicked his sleeve, and a golden streak shot out, emitting a piercing sound like a sword cry, soaring skyward before exploding.</p><p>Instantly, golden clouds unfurled, Buddhist light illuminating the land, resembling the scene of a Buddha's descent from the scriptures.</p><p>Mortals throughout the oasis could see the golden clouds and Buddhist light. Devout Buddhists, faces filled with ecstasy, prostrated themselves, praising the Buddha.</p><p>This was actually Venerable Chengyuan's signal for help. The six other great temples in the distant oases could also see the celestial phenomenon and would come to reinforce.</p><p>It hadn't been used since the seven temples formed their alliance.</p><p>While sending the signal, Venerable Chengyuan quickly scanned the area below.</p><p>His reaction was undeniably swift, but the result surprised him. All was normal around the Sutra Repository; no intruders were detected.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was taken aback.</p><p>He had expected at least one accomplice of the Daoist nun, perhaps even more, to be lurking within Zhulan Temple. Otherwise, they wouldn't be so brazen!</p><p>The enemy was hidden, he was exposed.</p><p>Targeted by an unknown Nascent Soul cultivator, with the opponent clearly having planned this for a long time, Venerable Chengyuan felt a surge of alarm and unhesitatingly sent the signal.</p><p>Unexpectedly, no one had infiltrated the area.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>A tremendous sound erupted from the Pagoda Forest, demonic fire soaring into the sky!</p><p>…</p><p>Midday.</p><p>The scorching sun blazed overhead, the sky cloudless.</p><p>The intense sunlight bathed the Pagoda Forest, unable to dispel the lingering chill within.</p><p>As Liu Li made her move, Qin Sang also began his operation.</p><p>Within Zhulan Temple, the Pagoda Forest, enshrining past generations of ancestors, held a transcendent status and was heavily protected.</p><p>However, since it housed only mundane objects, its defenses couldn't be as tight as the Sutra Repository's, otherwise, Qin Sang would have faced more difficulties.</p><p>With the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's assistance, deciphering such restrictions wasn't overly challenging.</p><p>The Pagoda Forest's restrictions were already firmly imprinted in Qin Sang's mind, having been simulated countless times.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly appeared at the edge of the Pagoda Forest, an invisible barrier before him.</p><p>He trusted Liu Li's abilities, putting aside other thoughts, focusing solely on the barrier.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's pupils appeared somewhat unfocused, as his mind was linked with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, fully activating the Heavenly Eye divine ability.</p><p>In the butterfly's 'vision,' the barrier materialized. Before him was not empty space, but a golden net.</p><p>Golden threads crisscrossed, forming a dense net enveloping the Pagoda Forest. The net extended outwards, eventually disappearing into the void, merging with the protective spiritual formation.</p><p>Only during grand Buddhist festivals would the three Venerables open the Pagoda Forest.</p><p>Ordinarily, the monks guarding the pagodas dared not disturb the past ancestors and didn't know the method of opening it.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>His divine sense surged from his Purple Mansion.</p><p>The Fire Lotus also flew out from between his eyebrows, guided by his divine sense, dividing into strands of gentle demonic fire, slowly drifting towards the 'golden net.'</p><p>The demonic fire lightly adhered to the 'golden net.'</p><p>Qin Sang's control over the demonic fire had reached a pinnacle of refinement, selecting only the barrier's key points, meticulously calculated through countless simulations.</p><p>Unnoticeably, the demonic fire began to merge with the 'golden net.'</p><p>Qin Sang remained completely focused, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>This step was the most crucial part of the entire plan.</p><p>At this moment, Venerable Chengyuan, having just been ambushed by Liu Li, would have surely reacted and gone to protect the Sutra Repository.</p><p>If Qin Sang made a mistake and prematurely drew Venerable Chengyuan to the Pagoda Forest, their efforts might be in vain.</p><p>It appeared as if the golden threads of the net were gradually dyeing black, replaced by the demonic fire. In reality, the true process of breaking the restriction was incredibly perilous, a tremendous test of Qin Sang's mental fortitude.</p><p>He didn't directly create a passage through the barrier, as doing so would undoubtedly alert Venerable Chengyuan.</p><p>His plan was to act cautiously, disrupting several key nodes of the barrier, weakening its defensive power to a certain extent, then bursting into the Pagoda Forest in one go, giving Venerable Chengyuan no chance to intervene.</p><p>When Venerable Chengyuan appeared above the Sutra Repository, golden clouds filling the sky,</p><p>The golden net appeared to rot, unsightly black spots appearing on it.</p><p>Throughout this, the disciples responsible for maintaining the spiritual formation remained unaware of Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, his eyes flashing, he abruptly reached out and pressed against the 'golden net.'</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The Demonic Banners flew swiftly, demonic fire instantly taking shape.</p><p>Qin Sang's arm muscles bulged, a demonic fire dragon coiling around it, striking the golden net along with his fist.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thunderous roar shook Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Within the Pagoda Forest, the pagodas trembled violently, the Buddhist light atop them flickering erratically.</p><p>A gap was forcibly torn in the barrier!</p><p>Amidst the dancing demonic fire, a figure flashed into the Pagoda Forest, heading straight for one particular pagoda.</p><p>Zhulan Temple's pagodas were constructed from a yellow ore, said to be absent in the Vast Sea, brought by the monks from their homeland when Zhulan Temple relocated.</p><p>The pagodas varied in height but were arranged in an orderly fashion, identical in shape, all hexagonal single-story dense-eave pagodas. Based on the eminent monk's contributions to the temple during their lifetime, the pagodas ranged from five to nine stories.</p><p>The pagoda enshrining Venerable Hongyi's śarīra had nine eaves, one of the highest specifications in the Pagoda Forest.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared atop the pagoda.</p><p>The śarīra was within his grasp.</p><p>Even with his composure, a smile crept onto his lips. Without hesitation, he reached into the Buddhist light, grasping the śarīra.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout came from above.</p><p>A shadow appeared over the Pagoda Forest. Sensing the anomaly, Venerable Chengyuan shifted there, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>The touch was warm and smooth, like a gemstone.</p><p>Qin Sang grasped the śarīra, without even glancing up, immediately retreating.</p><p>Simultaneously, his divine sense converged in his palm, transforming into an illusory talisman seal, enveloping the śarīra, clinging to its surface, then vanishing in a flash.</p><p>This was a secret technique imparted by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>If the śarīra proved to be a fake, he would have to confront Venerable Chengyuan and forcibly raid the Sutra Repository and treasury.</p><p>After today, Zhulan Temple would undoubtedly be heavily guarded, and there wouldn't be a better opportunity.</p><p>As the talisman seal vanished, Qin Sang immediately sensed the śarīra's extraordinary nature, perceiving a peculiar power within it through the seal.</p><p>This power lay dormant within. Had it not been for Xiao Xiangzi's guidance, Qin Sang would have overlooked it even with the śarīra in hand, no wonder Zhulan Temple had remained unaware.</p><p>“It’s real!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy. Just as he was about to withdraw his divine sense and retreat, he suddenly 'heard' a faint sound.</p><p>It seemed like something cracking.</p><p>It wasn't heard by his ears, but perceived by his divine sense, originating from within the śarīra!</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's expression abruptly tightened.</p><p>For some reason, the śarīra in his hand suddenly grew scorching hot, as if a seal had been broken by his probing, the power within activating, even erupting!</p><p>This situation was something Xiao Xiangzi hadn't mentioned, a complete surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't performed the complete secret technique to refine the śarīra, only the initial part to sense the power's existence before immediately stopping. Under normal circumstances, the śarīra shouldn't have reacted this way.</p><p>In Qin Sang's perception, the śarīra wasn't originally a complete whole.</p><p>Recalling the formation process of a śarīra, Qin Sang suddenly understood, faintly guessing the reason.</p><p>Back then, when Venerable Hongyi failed his breakthrough with the aid of a mystical treasure, his physical body perished. The outer 'seal' was likely formed from Venerable Hongyi's essence upon his passing, fusing with the mystical treasure whose power hadn't fully dissipated, thus sealing the treasure and preserving it.</p><p>As time passed,</p><p>The 'seal' gradually weakened, becoming increasingly fragile.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang's slight probe, touching that power, caused the śarīra to react abnormally, the 'seal' unable to contain the mystical treasure's power, which began to revive after years of dormancy.</p><p>Even without Qin Sang, with the passage of time, the śarīra's internal imbalance would eventually lead to the eruption of the mystical treasure's power.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was an unexpected crisis.</p><p>Elsewhere, he could immediately sit in meditation and refine the śarīra.</p><p>Attempting this within Zhulan Temple was no different from courting death.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly, his divine sense surging towards his palm, layers upon layers enveloping the śarīra, yet unable to stop the power's eruption.</p><p>He certainly wouldn't sit idly by. His thoughts raced, urging the Fire Lotus, constructing a demonic fire seal.</p><p>Fortunately, the śarīra's 'seal' hadn't completely shattered. Qin Sang's actions were effective, temporarily stabilizing the 'seal,' but it could only buy him some time. He had to escape quickly and find a place to refine it.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>At this moment, Venerable Chengyuan's gaze shifted from Qin Sang to his hand, noticing the fluctuations from the śarīra.</p><p>He now understood that Venerable Hongyi's śarīra was a mystical treasure. How laughable that Zhulan Temple had enshrined it for so long, completely oblivious.</p><p>The enemy had deployed two Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivators, going to such lengths; the śarīra's value must be unimaginable.</p><p>“Thus have I heard!”</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan pressed his palms together, his voice deep.</p><p>Employing some unknown secret technique, Venerable Chengyuan's bones cracked, his aura surging!</p>
