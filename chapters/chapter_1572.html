<h1>Chapter 1563:  Southern Sea Immortal Palace</h1><p>Chapter 1563:  Southern Sea Immortal Palace</p><p>The Gu King's poison proved far more potent than anticipated, and the cost was substantial.</p><p>The Scarfaced Man underestimated its power.</p><p>This was understandable.  Given his cultivation, few in the world could oppose him. He hadn't expected to be unable to control the insect he himself had cultivated.</p><p>The man in grey robes remained concerned about his Gu beast, his anxiety evident in his voice.  "Master, that person stole the Rainbow Poison Spider. How will we cultivate the Gu King now...?"</p><p>"The Gu King is nearing completion. The Rainbow Poison Spider is inconsequential; it will merely take a few more years."</p><p>Glancing at his disciple, the Scarfaced Man showed displeasure, thinking to himself that taking shortcuts in cultivation invariably left behind many hidden dangers. His disciple's resolve was inferior even to that of a newly-formed Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"I chose the Rainbow Poison Spider because it's the most suitable for cultivating the Gu King. Did you think I couldn't find one with greater potential?"</p><p>The grey-robed man stammered, then noticed his master tossing him an object.</p><p>It was a Gu God's Token, though its shape and design differed greatly from Qin Sang's.</p><p>"The Stone Spirit is secondary. The other person possessed extremely pure spiritual wood essence, rarely seen in the world. That person carries a spiritual treasure and is undoubtedly influential. Now that he's escaped back to his lair, we won't get another opportunity like this. I'll suppress the Gu King first. Take this token to the nearby Weeping Spirit Cave and request the Weeping Spirit Cave Master's assistance."</p><p>The Scarfaced Man's right hand returned to its normal appearance. He inserted his thumb and index finger into the blood hole in his palm and pinched out a jade insect.</p><p>‘Hiss… hiss…’</p><p>The jade insect was incredibly aggressive and immediately tried to bite him.</p><p>He shook his left hand. The flesh inside the blood hole had already rotted, the poison seeping into his meridians, and grey miasma spreading to his wrist. Fortunately, as he had personally cultivated the Gu King, he could turn his left arm into dead wood and withstand the poison.</p><p>The Scarfaced Man sneered, "The Gu King's poison isn't something that can be easily cured. The Daoist from Mount Bu Nian forcibly mobilized his Qi; the poison must have entered his lungs by now. If that person discards his body, then fine; otherwise, he won't escape far and will inevitably leave a trail!"</p><p>With that, the Scarfaced Man plunged into the ground.</p><p>The grey-robed man put away the Gu God's Token, looked around, and flew towards the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>In a subterranean passage, a green light flashed, speeding forward before gradually fading, finally coming to a stop to reveal two figures: Qin Sang and Lu Zhang.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared completely unharmed.</p><p>Lu Zhang, however, looked extremely pale, his lips turning grey.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang said gravely, "Daoist Lu, the poison in your body…"</p><p>"I won't die… for now,"</p><p>Lu Zhang said wryly, "Such a powerful poison! In just a short while, my blood and Qi have both dried up, and my true essence has become stagnant. I took a Preserving Truth Pill to suppress the poison. Now that I've forcibly used my true essence to activate the Sitting Meditation Bell, the poison is attacking again. Once the poison enters my Nascent Soul, even if I separate my Nascent Soul and use teleportation, I'll be unable to escape.  Such a fierce poison is unprecedented."</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Preserving Truth Pill; it was said that only Mount Bu Nian could refine it, and it was incredibly precious, yet it could only suppress the poison.</p><p>As they spoke, the green light grew weaker, finally shrinking to the size of a green pea, circling Lu Zhang once before leaving a thin green trail.</p><p>The once-mighty Sitting Meditation Bell had only a sliver of its original power remaining.</p><p>A look of pain flashed across Lu Zhang's eyes as he absorbed the remaining light, its destination unknown.  Then he began to cough violently, with grey miasma appearing on his forehead.</p><p>The forced use of the Sitting Meditation Bell had given the poison another opportunity.</p><p>Seeing his worsening condition, Qin Sang said sternly, "We're still within the range of the subterranean miasma; we haven't escaped danger. We must leave immediately. I have a way to move stealthily through the poisonous miasma. If you trust me, Daoist Lu, temporarily seal your meridians."</p><p>"If it weren't for Daoist's desperate efforts to save me, Lu would have undoubtedly perished.  Why wouldn't I trust you? I beg Daoist for your help.”</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded without hesitation, closed his eyes, secretly holding a jade amulet, entered a state of suspended animation, and closed off his blood and Qi, isolating himself from the outside world.</p><p>Qin Sang emitted a ray of cold light, freezing Lu Zhang in ice, then grabbed the ice.  Simultaneously, he dispelled his protective true essence and merged his figure into the miasma, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>After stealthily moving through the miasma for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t sense any pursuers.</p><p>He didn’t know if Lu Zhang's abilities were outstanding enough to have shaken off their pursuers, or if there were other reasons.</p><p>In fact, during the fight, Qin Sang had noticed the Scarfaced Man's actions were unusual. Based on his experience, he could vaguely guess the reason. For example, the jade insect's poison was so terrifying, yet he only used it once, keeping it in his left hand the entire time.  There was certainly a reason for this.</p><p>Perhaps, he didn't necessarily need to escape, given that he possessed a spiritual treasure.</p><p>There was no need to take unnecessary risks. The opponent was a powerful cultivator; while victory was possible, the chances of killing him were slim, and a desperate fight offered no advantage.  This was the opponent's territory, and he could summon help at any moment.</p><p>The extent of the underground miasma was far greater than anticipated.  Qin Sang judged they had left the basin, but were still far from the miasma's edge.  Only the number of hidden passages had decreased.</p><p>After flying for some time, he heard the sound of rushing water ahead and discovered an underground river, or rather, several.  All were poisonous.</p><p>The river water had mingled with the toxic miasma, but Qin Sang determined it posed little threat and jumped in, following the current.</p><p>...</p><p>The grey-robed man flew to the surface, checked his bearings, and vanished into the air.</p><p>Outside the basin, a vast expanse of miasma stretched out, with a mountain range looming faintly in the distance, like a slumbering dragon poised to strike, a chilling sight.</p><p>The grey-robed man approached the mountain range, making no attempt to conceal his presence.  He was noticed immediately by a cultivator within, a voice calling from afar, "Which fellow cultivator graces our humble abode?"</p><p>Before the words were finished, a figure burst from the miasma.</p><p>The grey-robed man restrained his flight, wary. "Are you the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave?"</p><p>The newcomer was an elderly man with white hair and beard, who sized up the grey-robed man with a questioning look. "That's me. You seem unfamiliar; you haven't been cultivating in Southern Province for long, have you?"</p><p>The grey-robed man didn't reply, flicking his wrist to send the Gu God's Token towards the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave.</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave flicked out a spectral figure which caught the token in its mouth.  Upon seeing it, his expression darkened.  He grumbled, "I've already stated that unless you're absolutely certain, you're not dragging me into this. Don't disturb my cultivation…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's gaze sharpened as he stared at the Gu God's Token.  He gasped, "Mu Xiang?"</p><p>He looked up sharply, scrutinizing the grey-robed man. "You're not Master Mu Xiang, are you?"</p><p>"He is my master."</p><p>The grey-robed man's lips moved; he whispered a few words.</p><p>The Lord of the Weeping Spirit Cave's expression shifted repeatedly before he finally nodded.</p><p>...</p><p>The battle for the Stone Toad hadn't ended long ago.</p><p>Nearby cultivators discovered that the center of the basin had collapsed, revealing a bottomless pit filled with miasma, and a new lake of miasma had inexplicably appeared.</p><p>Over the following period, streaks of light occasionally flashed across the sky – astonishingly fast, mysterious powerhouses appearing and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>These strange occurrences terrified nearby cultivators who fled, and various bizarre legends began to spread through the cultivation world.</p><p>Months later, the chaos subsided and things gradually returned to normal. Cultivators resumed their lives, but the large hole in the basin remained.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had left the Southern Province.</p><p>He and Lu Zhang escaped safely, floating down the underground river.  Upon resurfacing, they found themselves in the Northern Province.</p><p>The Northern Province was sparsely populated.</p><p>Certain they had shaken off their pursuers, the two found an uninhabited mountain and created a cave dwelling to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't injured and quickly recovered. He remained to protect Lu Zhang.</p><p>The protective barrier flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted; he opened the door to see Lu Zhang emerging from the cave.  Lu Zhang's complexion had returned to normal, looking much better, having apparently purged the poison from his body.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Congratulations, Cultivator Lu, on escaping danger."</p><p>Lu Zhang sighed and bowed to Qin Sang. "Luckily, I had the foresight to invite you to accompany me, otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable."</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't drawn the attention of the strange-faced man, creating an opportunity, even after escaping into the Qingzhong Bell, Lu Zhang would have become a turtle with its shell soon to be broken.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, refusing to take credit.  "Our escape from that fiend's grasp was thanks to your Sitting Meditation Bell, a true treasure. Its multiple abilities are truly outstanding."</p><p>"The Sitting Meditation Bell was developed by our ancestors. It's the most compatible artifact for our sect's techniques, and those techniques will cause irreversible damage to the bell at the cost of its essence. It’s the last resort for cultivators of our sect."</p><p>Lu Zhang explained.</p><p>Remembering the destroyed bell, Lu Zhang's eyes dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang comforted him, "Fortunately, its essence hasn't been destroyed. With the accumulation of resources in Bunan Mountain, re-refining it shouldn't be difficult. In comparison, obtaining the Stone Toad is far more fortunate and sufficient compensation for your loss."</p><p>Lu Zhang's expression brightened slightly.</p><p>He understood that Qin Sang was intentionally changing the subject, so he tactfully avoided mentioning the spiritual treasure, instead asking about Qin Sang's impression of the strange-faced man.</p><p>"The strange-faced man's appearance is unusual, and his Wood element technique is masterful. Cultivator Lu, you have no impression of this person?" Qin Sang asked back.</p><p>In Central State, Grand Cultivators are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p><p>The path of cultivation is all about competition.  There are no secrets in the world; as long as one leaves the mountains to compete for opportunities, news will always spread and become known.</p><p>Those who reach such a high level of cultivation, which one hasn't received various fortuitous encounters?</p><p>Even Buddhist masters can't completely isolate themselves from the mundane world and live a life of quiet contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang emphasized the strange-faced man's wood-elemental abilities rather than the jade beetle.</p><p>It's clear that the jade beetle is an external object, while the Way of Wood is the strange-faced man's fundamental path.</p><p>Lu Zhang pondered for a long time, "The Way of Wood is one of the Five Elements. Many cultivators are proficient in it. Cultivators from the Southern Barbarian states have always been known for their mysterious nature. If this person only recently advanced to the later stage and has been hiding here cultivating the jade beetle, their name might not have spread yet. After returning to the mountain, I will ask the headmaster to pay attention to this person. This person is ruthless; having refined that venomous creature, countless cultivators will suffer at their hands in the future."</p><p>Once the jade beetle reaches its peak, cultivators without antidotal abilities will face certain death if they are accidentally struck.</p><p>Qin Sang is also very wary of the strange-faced man.</p><p>The other party has targeted his avatar, and it's unlikely they'll give up easily.  His avatar must remain vigilant at all times.</p><p>...</p><p>After recovering from their injuries, the two decided to leave this troubled place and return to Zhuozhou.</p><p>They took a detour through western Barbarian State, deliberately slowing their pace to observe the local customs and people.</p><p>They soon made a discovery: the shadow of the Gu God Sect was frequently appearing among the commoners of the Barbarian State, having spread secretly for an unknown length of time.</p><p>The Gu God Sect only spreads among commoners, using hallucinogenic drugs to deceive them. Barbarian State cultivators are accustomed to this and scoff at it; it doesn't cause much of a stir in the cultivation world.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't known that the Gu God Sect had a Nascent Soul cultivator as its protector, he wouldn't have paid it any mind.</p><p>But what if the Gu God Sect emerges from the shadows? Could it lead to earth-shattering changes? Qin Sang decided to stay out of it and let the larger sects worry about it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, one night, as they passed over a village, an overheard conversation alerted Qin Sang.</p><p>The commoners of the Southern Barbarian states live in similar environments; the locations and structures of their villages are largely the same.</p><p>That night, the village below was also worshipping a statue.</p><p>The villagers had ingested a potent hallucinogenic drug; the scene was even more chaotic than the first village they discovered, a veritable pandemonium.</p><p>After the effects of the drug wore off, the nearly ninety-year-old village chief led the villagers in kneeling before the statue, chanting what seemed to be some kind of scripture.</p><p>This scripture indicated the location of the Vacuum Immortal Land, mentioning that the gods pitied mankind and would bring the immortal palace down to the world to guide believers. Only those with utmost faith and sincerity would be eligible to escape all suffering, achieving immortality, peace, and joy.</p><p>The immortal palaces in the Vacuum Immortal Land are numerous and boundless, located on the South Sea!</p><p>Qin Sang was most sensitive to the words "immortal palace," and stopped immediately after hearing them.</p><p>In the case of other cults, it could be dismissed as nonsense. However, given the Gu God Sect's Nascent Soul protector, their scriptures might contain hidden meaning and not be entirely fabricated.</p><p>The scripture described the South Sea immortal palaces as incredibly beautiful, using extravagant praise.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experiences in Ziwei Palace and Qisha Palace, he found nothing to match the description.</p><p>However, different immortal palaces may have different environments, and these scriptures are meant to deceive ordinary people, so embellishment and exaggeration are inevitable.</p><p>Connecting a mundane sect to mysterious immortal palaces...</p><p>It sounds utterly absurd.</p><p>But Qin Sang has investigated for many years in the cultivation world without any progress.  This is his first seemingly plausible lead, and he can't ignore it.</p><p>He glanced at Lu Zhang beside him. Lu Zhang showed no reaction when he heard about the South Sea immortal palaces.</p><p>It's unclear what happened in Central State, and why the Tian Tong Palace and Tian Xiang Palace are so secretive.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to be too obvious. After hearing the entire scripture, he and Lu Zhang continued north, but he had already taken note of the Gu God Sect.</p><p>The Southern Barbarian states are not a safe place, and the Gu God Sect is mysterious and unpredictable. To be safe, he would personally investigate after his main body breaks through.</p><p>...</p><p>Besides the Fu River, there is another great river in the Central Plains—the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>It flows from north to south, originating in the Northern Wastelands, passing through Zhaoyao State and eastern Zhuozhou. After converging with the Fu River in the six states to the east of the river, it branches off, flowing through the Southern Barbarian states, and finally empties into the South Sea, running through the Central Plains.</p><p>After leaving the Barbarian State, the two boarded a ship on the Flying Cloud River and sailed upstream to Zhuozhou.</p><p>The Bunan Mountain Daoist grounds are on the west bank of the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>After disembarking...</p><p>Lu Zhang invited Qin Sang to go to Bunan Mountain, but Qin Sang was eager to return to Pushan.</p><p>Lu Zhang didn't insist, saying solemnly, "Daoist, rest assured. After I return, I will ask the headmaster for cold crystals and have them sent to your residence..."</p>
