<h1>Chapter 1482: After the Turmoil</h1><p>This time was not without gains. At the very least, they now knew that Daoist Qingfeng had cultivated both the Sword Dao and Body Refinement to astonishing heights. However, the price paid was indeed a bit steep. </p><p>A bet is a bet, and one must accept the outcome. Shang Lu admitted defeat, too ashamed to reclaim the Serpent Banner. He turned and flew off the arena, returning to his cloud bed. His expression remained calm, ignoring the surrounding gazes as he sat down to meditate, not even mentioning the three Snow Serpents. Seeing such boldness from Sect Master Shang, Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. Without hesitation, he stored the demon core and the Serpent Banner into his Thousand Jun Ring, regretting not capturing one of the serpents alive. Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a bit of admiration for Shang Lu—if he had truly fought for love.</p><p>After this minor yet significant episode, Qin Sang and Liu Li, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, walked hand in hand back to the Cloud Altar to continue the wedding ceremony. Standing side by side, they received the Heavenly Incense from Master Shi Xue, faced the ritual altar, and completed the three bows. With this, the wedding ceremony finally drew to a close. This was already a simplified version; many of the more elaborate rituals had been omitted. Otherwise, it might have taken another half an hour.</p><p>Soon after, disciples from the Listening Snow Pavilion brought forth fragrant spirit serpent meat. Master Shi Xue led Qin Sang and Liu Li to greet the guests, sharing wine and laughter. Qin Sang became familiar with many faces. Some of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the Profound Heaven Palace had not yet arrived, as they were still confronting the demon army. Tong Lingyu and others would have to return to the frontlines overnight. Even so, the gathering of experts present was the most formidable sect Qin Sang had ever encountered in his cultivation journey.</p><p>When facing the newlyweds, the guests praised Liu Li profusely, while their gazes toward Qin Sang were filled with curiosity and intrigue. Shang Lu, disregarding his status as a sect master, had made a move during the wedding ceremony but ended up losing more than he gained. This groom clearly had not shown his full strength, leaving everyone wondering just how many hidden abilities he possessed. They suddenly realized that within the entire Profound Heaven Palace, only the Palace Master and the Grand Elder who wielded the spiritual treasure could confidently defeat this couple. The Listening Snow Pavilion, once lacking top-tier experts and gradually declining, was now a force no one dared to underestimate.</p><p>Amidst the clinking of cups, Qin Sang and the others approached Luo Wan. Raising her cup in celebration, she downed it in one go, then glanced at the sky with a sly smile. "The night is deep, and such a rare evening should not be wasted. I wonder which cave abode Sect Master Shi has prepared for the newlyweds?" </p><p>In her heart, however, she was puzzled. During the earlier duel, she had not sensed any fluctuations of the "Divine Maiden's Heart Scripture" from Qin Sang and Liu Li. She wondered if they had not cultivated this technique or if they were simply holding back.</p><p>Master Shi Xue pointed to the ground. "It is the Tai Su Mountain, where our master once cultivated." </p><p>As soon as she spoke, a group of disciples and flower spirits flew out from a nearby peak, circling the mountain and scattering sweet dew. Instantly, the vegetation on the mountain grew wildly, and flowers bloomed in abundance. This peak, close to the main mountain, was one of the best spiritual veins in the Listening Snow Pavilion. In the blink of an eye, the lower half of the mountain was draped in a tapestry of vibrant colors, a breathtaking sight. The summit, however, remained covered in pristine snow.</p><p>Elder Jiang walked over slowly, smiling. "Let me gift you another cave abode." </p><p>With a wave of his hand, a speck of azure light descended from the sky and landed on the mountain peak. The light rapidly expanded, transforming into a complex of halls and pavilions, perfectly integrated. Qin Sang and Liu Li, who preferred simplicity over extravagance, found the cave abode to be modest yet fully functional, complete with protective formations—a thoughtful preparation by the Listening Snow Pavilion. In the future, they could take this abode with them wherever they went.</p><p>After the cave abode was settled, Tong Lingyu approached, looking Qin Sang and Liu Li up and down with a beaming smile. "You are both rising stars with boundless futures. The sect cannot let this occasion pass without a gift..." </p><p>She produced several small flags, waving her jade hand to send them flying as streams of light, embedding them into various parts of Tai Su Mountain. She then handed them a jade tablet to control the formation. "This is the Azure Cloud Sea-Calming Formation."</p><p>The guests looked down and saw the mountain shrouded in a sea of clouds, ethereal and otherworldly—a truly profound formation. Qin Sang and Liu Li expressed their gratitude one by one.</p><p>"Go now, and do not waste this precious night," the guests said with smiles, watching the newlyweds depart. Young attendants carrying incense burners led the procession, escorting the couple to the entrance of their cave abode before bowing and taking their leave.</p><p>With this, the wedding ceremony officially concluded. However, the countless red phoenix lanterns remained lit, illuminating the night until dawn, their glow reaching far and wide, lasting the entire night.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li stepped into their cave abode. As the Azure Cloud Sea-Calming Formation activated, its power enveloped Tai Su Mountain, shielding it from outside view and blocking out all the noise. After the clamor, only tranquility remained.</p><p>Without a word, they walked side by side into the cave abode, their shadows gradually lengthening. Inside, the abode was fully equipped with alchemy rooms, artifact chambers, and more. There were even two dedicated cultivation halls, one at each end of the abode. Their cultivation techniques differed—Qin Sang had no particular requirements for his environment, but Liu Li was different. Being too close might interfere with each other's cultivation.</p><p>They reached the central corridor, paused, and exchanged a glance, silent yet understanding. Nodding to each other, they turned in opposite directions, walking back-to-back toward their respective chambers, leaving behind two solitary figures.</p><p>...</p><p>Before long, the guests dispersed. The Listening Snow Pavilion gradually returned to silence, with only the flickering lanterns and the starlit sky illuminating the night. This grand wedding spread far and wide, becoming a tale often recounted by disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion and even other branches of the Profound Heaven Palace, who dreamed of one day hosting such a ceremony themselves.</p><p>However, the traces of the wedding were quickly erased from Qin Sang's heart. He immediately sealed the cave abode and devoted himself to cultivation, helping the Heavenly Eye Butterfly stabilize its realm and refining the lingering soul shadows within his external avatar in preparation for the opening of the Holy Land a year later.</p><p>Time flowed by unnoticed. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's cultivation stabilized. Although it had broken through a minor realm, it had not awakened any new divine abilities. However, its abilities of concealment, the Heavenly Eye, and the Heavenly Eye Divine Light had all improved. Additionally, the aura of the calamity thunder it wielded grew denser. Though still illusory, it was gradually approaching reality. There was still a long way to go before the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could assist in overcoming tribulations. Qin Sang wasn't sure if he would reach that point, but he would not give up hope.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly sensed the cave abode's formation being disturbed—the first interruption since he had declared his seclusion. Calculating the time, he realized the Holy Land would not open for another two months. He ceased his cultivation and opened the abode to find Master Shi Xue standing outside, her expression grave.</p><p>"The Grand Elder has sent word," she said. "The demon tribes are becoming increasingly active. They may launch another attack before the Holy Land opens."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. "Will the Holy Land be affected?"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded. "The Holy Land's opening should not be delayed. The various branches have waited too long and are growing impatient. However, if war breaks out, at least half of the Nascent Soul cultivators will have to remain outside. The Grand Elder has summoned the branches to discuss this matter."</p>
