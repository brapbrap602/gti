<h1>Chapter 371: The Follower</h1><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword effortlessly shaved off a thin layer of stone, proving to be far sharper than Kong Xin’s blue sword.</p><p>Kong Xin watched the Ebony Sword’s impressive display with admiration. "A magnificent sword! Every magical tool of yours is so powerful, Fellow Daoist. I am truly impressed!"</p><p>Qin Sang replied indifferently, "I was merely fortunate enough to acquire a few suitable tools. Your praise is undeserved. If I were to experience a few more perilous situations like this, I fear no amount of magical tools could save my life. Wouldn't you agree, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang's words carried a subtle warning.</p><p>Kong Xin chuckled awkwardly and swore to the heavens, "Fellow Daoists have already inspected the area. The cave exit is just ahead, and we shall see the proof shortly! I harbor no ill intentions. I merely feared prematurely revealing information, just in case, hence this strategy. If I have spoken falsely, I am at your mercy! I swear, this is the only time, and it will not happen again!"</p><p>……</p><p>The Ebony Sword danced, slicing off stone fragments.</p><p>Gradually, shimmering points of light appeared on the stone wall. They were pieces of Cold Gold Ore, embedded in the wall in a seemingly random yet beautiful pattern.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his work, chipping off these pieces of Cold Gold Ore and placing them on the open ground before the group.</p><p>Thanks to the Ebony Sword’s sharpness, Qin Sang worked quickly. In less than a quarter of an hour, he had scraped clean a whole layer of the stone wall.</p><p>By this time, the evil spirits were gathering strength, and though the group had been forced to reveal almost all their trump cards, the situation was far from dire. They still had reserves, so they urged Qin Sang to continue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang tried to dig deeper, he found only stone, no more Cold Gold Ore.</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang tried a dozen other spots, plunging the Ebony Sword several feet deep, but ultimately confirmed that there was no more Cold Gold Ore inside.</p><p>This vein only had a single layer!</p><p>Everyone was greatly disappointed.</p><p>It wasn’t that the harvest was small. The amount of Cold Gold Ore in this single layer was considerable. Divided equally among everyone present, each person would receive a head-sized chunk.</p><p>Once refined, the Cold Gold would be quite valuable.</p><p>However, compared to their expectations, this amount was far too small to be satisfying.</p><p>Kong Xin was the most disappointed.</p><p>The others, having stumbled upon the Cold Gold Ore by chance, treated it as a pleasant surprise and quickly recovered from their disappointment.</p><p>"Riches entice men as food does birds. It's good that there's only one layer, lest we become too greedy to leave and be trapped here by the evil spirits until we exhaust our strength. Let's divide this and be on our way…"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Bao said cheerfully. He glanced at the pile of Cold Gold Ore, then at Kong Xin, "Fellow Daoist, you said earlier that everyone present would share equally. You won't go back on your word, will you?"</p><p>Kong Xin composed himself and forced a smile. "Of course not. However, I haven't contributed much.  This Cold Gold Ore was all mined by Daoist Qing Feng with his precious sword. We should ask for his opinion."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "Without you Fellow Daoists holding back the evil spirits, my sword, however sharp, couldn't have worked so smoothly. Let's divide it equally."</p><p>However, when it came to the distribution, the old man and his young apprentice admitted that the disciple's cultivation was too low to claim two shares.</p><p>The others saw their humility and naturally had no objections. The quality of the Cold Gold Ore was uniform, so everyone quickly divided it and rushed towards the cave exit.</p><p>By now, the evil spirits outside the cave were densely packed, turning the entire cavern into a ghostly realm.</p><p>The group fought their way out, reaching the mouth of another cave with some difficulty but without serious injury.</p><p>This time, Kong Xin hadn't lied. This cave wasn't a dead end. Whether it was the true exit remained to be seen.</p><p>They set up various barriers to hinder the pursuing spirits while simultaneously slaying those that caught up, fighting and retreating until they finally broke free.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Everyone gasped, still shaken.</p><p>The individual evil spirits weren't powerful, but their sheer number was staggering, a seemingly endless tide. Fortunately, they had used the terrain to their advantage, avoiding being completely surrounded.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how terrifying it would be if the tens of thousands of spirits originally on the surface converged, occupying several mountain ranges.</p><p>Now, thinking back, what the cultivator surnamed Bao had said was indeed correct.</p><p>If the ore vein had been larger, and they had lingered longer, becoming exhausted, a sudden appearance of powerful evil spirits could have resulted in casualties.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Kong, lead the way. I hope you're not lying this time!" The woman in red glared at Kong Xin, her voice cold.</p><p>The others also intentionally or unintentionally surrounded Kong Xin.</p><p>Kong Xin laughed dryly, repeatedly saying, "I wouldn't dare! You'll know the truth soon enough…"</p><p>Kong Xin walked ahead, with Qin Sang and Yun You Zi still at the rear.</p><p>After walking a short distance, Qin Sang suddenly paused, a playful expression appearing on his face. His gaze swept over the backs of Kong Xin and the others.  He pondered for a moment, then followed.</p><p>……</p><p>Within the cavern.</p><p>Having lost their target, the evil spirits gradually calmed down, returning to the depths of the cavern. Some began to fight amongst themselves, while others continued to wander aimlessly.</p><p>Just then, a figure appeared out of thin air.  He glanced at the emptied cave and snorted.</p><p>Using some unknown method, he hadn't alerted the wandering spirits, but he moved cautiously, hugging the stone walls, eventually following the direction the group had taken.</p><p>This person didn't notice that within the blood mist, a zombie mingled among the spirits.  It seemed unusual, its pitch-black eyes watching him depart.</p><p>Like the evil spirits, the zombie was an undead creature. Mixed in with these mindless spirits, as long as it didn't attack, it wouldn't be attacked.</p><p>Qin Sang had released this zombie during the chaos of the evil spirit attack.  Its purpose was to serve as an early warning system. If there were any exceptionally powerful spirits deep within the cavern, it could detect them, allowing him to escape.</p><p>Later, he hadn't had a chance to retrieve it before leaving, so he left it there.</p><p>It was just a zombie; creating it wasn't as difficult as creating a Sha Corpse. Its main use was as a scouting pawn. He wouldn't mind sacrificing it.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected such an unexpected gain.</p><p>He was now a considerable distance from the zombie, the connection growing very faint.  He could only vaguely sense through the zombie that someone was trailing them. He didn't know this person's cultivation level or identity.</p><p>However, since this person didn't dare to reveal themselves openly and resorted to such shady tactics, their cultivation level probably wasn't too high.</p><p>Whose accomplice were they?</p><p>Or were they a stranger, coincidentally taking the same route?</p><p>Qin Sang walked at the rear, silently observing the actions of those ahead, unable to discern anything suspicious.</p><p>Finding an opportunity, Qin Sang informed Yun You Zi about the follower.</p><p>Yun You Zi was also surprised.  He frowned, scrutinizing Kong Xin and the others, but couldn't make sense of it.</p>
