<h1>Chapter 94: The Plot</h1><p>Chapter 94: The Plot</p><p>While Zhao Yan was engrossed in collecting the mysterious orchid with his back to them, Ruan Nanfeng discreetly cast a silencing spell and transmitted his voice, "Don't react. Everyone, are you truly content to be at Zhao Yan's mercy?"</p><p>The group exchanged glances. The only woman among them, surnamed Cen, said suspiciously, "Junior Brother Ruan, what do you mean? The Heart-Eating Worms are lurking in our souls, ready to strike at any moment. What can we do if we don't obey?"</p><p>"We may not be able to do much, but I refuse to wait for death."</p><p>Ruan Nanfeng sneered, "Surnamed Yu said he had safely escorted Junior Sister Wu and the others out of the Gloom Yin Sect. I doubt it. Instead of the trouble of sending them out, killing them and disposing of the bodies would be much easier. If we hadn't luckily broken through to the eighth level and still held some use for him, we would be long gone by now. Senior Sister Cen, do you really want to gamble on a devil's conscience?"</p><p>Senior Sister Cen remained silent, then asked the quiet young man beside her, "Senior Brother Liu, do you think so too?"</p><p>The young man surnamed Liu hummed in agreement, sighing softly, "I also suspect something happened to the other disciples.  Who knows how many souls are trapped in the Yin Sha Abyss? To the Gloom Yin Sect, a few more or less makes no difference. After Zhao Yan collects the spirit herb, he still needs to escape the Yuan Zhao Sect. Does he really want to bring us along as burdens? As for his promises after the deed is done, we should take those with a grain of salt..."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Senior Sister Cen still hesitated. "Unless we can kill Zhao Yan instantly. If he has even a moment to react, he can activate the Heart-Eating Worms in our souls, and we'll die anyway..."</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been observing coldly from the side, suddenly spoke, "I have a magical artifact called the Purple Soul Bell. It can confuse Zhao Yan's mind, but his cultivation is higher than mine, so it can only restrain him for less than two breaths."</p><p>Qin Sang had long considered attacking Zhao Yan, but Zhao Yan never left his side, giving him no time to prepare his Bewitching Mirror or Ebony Sword.</p><p>He had also considered secretly joining forces with Ruan Nanfeng and the others, but ultimately gave up. Firstly, there was no opportunity to discuss it; transmitting their voices under Zhao Yan's watch would surely be discovered.</p><p>Secondly, they couldn't escape the control of the Heart-Eating Worms. Qin Sang wasn't sure if they had the resolve to resist. If they still held onto any hope for the Gloom Yin Sect and exposed him to protect themselves, it would backfire.</p><p>Now that they had brought it up themselves, Qin Sang was naturally happy to cooperate.</p><p>Ruan Nanfeng exclaimed with delight, "As long as I have the chance to unleash my Golden Crow Hammer, two breaths are enough. Senior Brother Liu, Senior Sister Cen, you should also have offensive magical artifacts, right? If the three of us attack simultaneously, we can definitely eliminate Zhao Yan in an instant!"</p><p>Senior Brother Liu's voice also revealed his excitement, "My top-grade magical artifact happens to be the Soul Devouring Spear. Senior Sister Cen also has a high-grade spirit sword. As soon as we leave the Three Calamities Heart-Devouring Formation, Junior Brother Qin, activate the Purple Soul Bell immediately, lest Zhao Yan strike first."</p><p>Senior Sister Cen was finally persuaded. She stared coldly at Zhao Yan, who was busy in the pool, her voice icy, "Then I'll gamble with you. In my opinion, there's no need to wait. To avoid any unforeseen circumstances, why not strike now? Zhao Yan has expended spiritual energy to pick the orchid, so he's at his weakest now. We can guarantee success!"</p><p>Senior Brother Liu quickly advised, "No, the Four Clouds Divine Restriction requires five people to operate. We still need him to get us out of the Three Calamities Heart-Devouring Formation. We can't touch him now."</p><p>Ruan Nanfeng chuckled sinisterly, his eyes fixated on the orchid being slowly pulled up by Zhao Yan. "Senior Brother Liu is right. We've been used by those devils for so long, living in fear every day. How can we not collect some interest? Let him retrieve the orchid first. After the four of us eliminate him, we'll divide the orchid equally. A celestial herb coveted by Foundation Establishment cultivators, even if we can't use it, it should be worth a few Foundation Establishment Pills, right? The Yuan Zhao Sect has two Golden Core masters. Even if the protective formation is broken, it won't be that easy to conquer. We can escape during the chaos. If you're willing to come with me, my family has an elder who's about to reach Golden Core. When he returns from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he can definitely help us remove the Heart-Eating Worms."</p><p>Upon hearing this, both Senior Brother Liu and Senior Sister Cen's eyes lit up with fervor.  Qin Sang noticed their expressions and grew wary, determined not to travel with them after escaping.</p><p>The four of them discussed the details further. Seeing that Zhao Yan was about to finish collecting the orchid, they quickly fell silent and pretended nothing had happened.</p><p>Zhao Yan firmly grasped the mysterious orchid. No matter how it struggled, it couldn't break free. The moment its roots left the water, it suddenly became still. The illusory smoke on the pistil also dissipated, turning into a lifeless object.</p><p>But Zhao Yan wasn't fazed.  His face lit up with delight, and he eagerly channeled more spiritual power into the translucent jade, unleashing the remaining thunderous energy.  Several divine lightning bolts cracked open a huge fissure, and he snatched the orchid.</p><p>Zhao Yan roared with laughter, holding the mysterious orchid up for closer inspection, looking almost crazed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang and the others, Zhao Yan's back was to them, and his eyes held not a trace of madness, but an icy coldness, a sinister smile playing on his lips.</p><p>The next moment, screams echoed through the cave, followed by several muffled thuds.</p><p>Zhao Yan beckoned, and the four cloud banners zipped back into his palm. He turned around slowly, a smug look on his face. "Did you really think I didn't know what you were up to? I can control the Four Cloud Divine Restriction all by myself. If it weren't for the powerful restrictions on thisâ€¦"</p><p>But as he took in the scene behind him, the smile froze on his face.</p><p>One, two, three... only three bodies!</p><p>Zhao Yan's expression changed drastically. He had clearly awakened the Heart-Devouring Insects. How could only three of them be dead? Where was the other one? Could the insects have failed?</p><p>Without time to think, Zhao Yan roared, "Show yourself!"</p><p>The blue cloud banner flashed, and clouds of mist billowed within the cave. Qin Sang's silhouette materialized from the mist.</p><p>The Cloud-Falling Wings could only conceal his aura, not make him disappear completely.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated this. Zhao Yan's request for them to activate the Four Cloud Divine Restriction together to breach the Three Calamities Heart-Devouring Formation was a deception. His true purpose was to use their combined power to unleash the restriction's most powerful lightning technique and break the seal on the mysterious orchid.</p><p>Before even storing the orchid in its jade box, Zhao Yan had immediately awakened the Heart-Devouring Insects. Ruan Nanfeng and the other two were devoured without a chance to resist.</p><p>At the same time, Zhao Yan had seized the cloud banners.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang had quickly concealed himself.  Knowing that Zhao Yan had expended a great deal of energy to obtain the orchid, and uncertain if the jade Buddha could protect him from the Three Calamities Heart-Devouring Formation, Qin Sang chose to launch a sneak attack rather than flee.</p><p>Despite the Cloud-Falling Wings being easily breached, Qin Sang remained calm, a Dark Water Yin-Thunder spell forming in his palm.</p>
