<h1>Chapter 762:  A Desperate Battle</h1><p>Chapter 762:  A Desperate Battle</p><p>Mistaking Qin Sang's involvement in the secrets of the ancient divine altar, suspecting other forces were at play, he hesitated, wanting to investigate thoroughly.</p><p>Upon learning it was all a misunderstanding, the young man acted without further restraint, pushing off the ground.</p><p>‘Hiss… hiss…’</p><p>The ground suddenly cracked. Starting from where the young man stood, a fissure spread at an alarming rate towards Qin Sang.  The fissure glowed intensely green, and a green vine grew rapidly within it, its form like a giant python.  Its target seemed not to be Qin Sang, but the two-headed beast.</p><p>The two-headed beast roared, its eyes fixed on the fissure.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The vine burst from the crack, shooting out with a ‘whoosh’. Qin Sang only saw a blurry green shadow before the vine struck the two-headed beast.</p><p>The two-headed beast’s fur stood on end. Without hesitation, it used its shadow clone technique, its form blurring, then dividing into several figures that scattered in all directions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the vine swayed, and several branches sprouted from its tip, moving as nimbly as snakes, incredibly swift.</p><p>‘Plop plop plop…’</p><p>The vine ensnared several of the two-headed beast’s clones, shattering them instantly, but its true body successfully evaded the vine and escaped.</p><p>The vine relentlessly pursued.</p><p>Suddenly, a flash of sword light appeared, severing the vine.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed beast leaped back.  The ebony sword, like a darting dragon, not only cut the vine but also swiftly plunged into the fissure, easily severing several sections of the vine and uprooting it.</p><p>But instead of relief, Qin Sang felt a sudden unease.  The vine's power had forced the two-headed beast to use its shadow clone technique to dodge; it couldn't be so easily cut down unless the young man had intentionally allowed it.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang felt a surge of foreboding.  His gaze sharpened, noticing something unusual about the motionless young man in the distance.  Without hesitation, he activated the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman.</p><p>Dragon spirits coiled around his body, enveloping Qin Sang, his speed instantly increased, vanishing from his spot and reappearing several yards away.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang disappeared, the ground beneath him exploded, a green light shooting into the sky.</p><p>At the heart of the green light was an oddly shaped spirit sword – a grey blade seemingly carved from an old tree bark, its surface rough but radiating a vibrant green light, representing life.</p><p>The grey sword appeared without warning, having been hidden underground before suddenly erupting. If Qin Sang had remained, he would have been cut in two.</p><p>The young man let out a soft exclamation, looking at Qin Sang with surprise.  “Your escape technique is stronger than I imagined, but it's not enough!”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the young man cast several hand seals. The grey sword trembled, emitting a dull sword cry, its green glow becoming more intense and brilliant.</p><p>As the green light intensified, the grey sword’s form became ethereal, eventually disappearing completely.</p><p>On the barren ground, grass and small trees sprouted.</p><p>In an instant, the space around Qin Sang transformed from the Purple Mist Wasteland into a green wilderness.</p><p>Of course, these were illusions.</p><p>The grey sword's true form was hidden within the wilderness, but every blade of grass and every tree emitted sword energy, possibly manifestations of the sword, making it extremely difficult to defend against.</p><p>If the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had completed its third transformation, Qin Sang could have easily seen through these illusions, but now he could only stand ready.</p><p>This illusion, composed purely of sword energy, had significant weaknesses and was flashy but ineffective, unless wielded by someone of supreme swordsmanship.  However, the difference in cultivation between Qin Sang and the young man was too great.  Qin Sang couldn't overcome it with force, and was thus restricted by the young man.</p><p>The vegetation grew wildly, constricting his movement.</p><p>Knowing he couldn't wait passively, Qin Sang pointed at the ebony sword.  Instead of recalling it for defense, he ordered it to strike directly at the young man’s true form.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang took out a scroll and lightly tossed it.  Falling petals and leaves fluttered down, blending seamlessly with the surrounding illusory vegetation.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered, then disappeared.</p><p>His ability to perfectly blend into the illusion using the scroll, hiding in the most dangerous place, was precisely because, like the young man, he cultivated wood-elemental spiritual energy.</p><p>The young man lost sight of Qin Sang, sensing no fluctuation from him within the sword energy illusion. Realizing he had outsmarted himself, he roared, “Burst!”</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The entire sword energy illusion shattered simultaneously. The seemingly real vegetation revealed its true nature as illusions, shattering like a mirror into countless fragments.</p><p>These fragments swiftly coalesced, reforming the grey sword's true form.</p><p>As the illusion shattered, the scroll was impacted, causing a tremor.  Qin Sang's true form was revealed. A grey sword flickered, seizing the opportunity to strike at Qin Sang's neck.</p><p>Sensing the rapidly approaching grey sword, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine, forcing him to dodge again.</p><p>From the start of the fight, he had been on the defensive, reacting to the young man's attacks without daring to directly confront him. The difference in their cultivation levels was starkly apparent.</p><p>Without a way to break the deadlock, he would be worn down and defeated.</p><p>Qin Sang parried the grey sword, while his ebony sword flew towards the young man.  The two-headed creature also charged.</p><p>The young man's relaxed expression faltered momentarily at the sound of thunder.</p><p>"Sword Qi Thunder Sound…"</p><p>The ebony sword, like a lightning bolt, aimed for the young man's throat. He reacted swiftly, leaping back while simultaneously sending out a golden light from his palm.</p><p>The light's source was a golden ring, initially the size of a signet ring.  As it flew, it expanded to the size of a bracelet and spun rapidly, seemingly aiming to trap the ebony sword.</p><p>"Another mid-grade magic treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. The grey sword the young man wielded was likely his natal spirit sword.  For someone of his cultivation level, refining a natal treasure to mid-grade wasn't unusual.</p><p>However, casually producing another mid-grade treasure highlighted just how formidable his opponent was.</p><p>Unsure of the golden ring's abilities, Qin Sang didn't dare let it touch the ebony sword. Changing his hand seals, he quickly employed the Sword Light Divergence technique.</p><p>As the ring attacked, the ebony sword abruptly stopped, then instantly split into two.</p><p>The young man, caught off guard, found the ring only ensnaring one sword light, leaving the main body of the ebony sword free to advance.</p><p>"Sword Light Divergence!"</p><p>The young man exclaimed, his face showing envy and admiration.  He had spent years studying the sword, yet he had never been able to master Sword Light Divergence.  Though Qin Sang only split the light once, it represented a gap he could not bridge.</p><p>Despite his surprise, the young man wasn't panicked. The disparity in their strength was not something a single sword technique could overcome.</p><p>The ebony sword was close.</p><p>The two-headed creature, its eyes wide, unleashed its full power, sending out wind blades that coalesced into a sweeping storm.</p><p>In the exchange of blows, it was the young man who found himself on the defensive, facing the combined assault of the ebony sword and the two-headed creature.</p>
