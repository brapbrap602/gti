<h1>Chapter 1582: Crossing South in White</h1><p>Chapter 1582: Crossing South in White</p><p>Successfully absorbing a lightning tribulation bolt.</p><p>Tianmudie gently flapped its wings, descending a short distance and hovering in mid-air.</p><p>After a brief rest, Tianmudie soared upward again. Qin Sang opportunely let another lightning tribulation bolt fall, creating a safe environment for Tianmudie.</p><p>The first wave of tribulation lightning was weaker, and Qin Sang blocked the heavenly tribulation using only the Golden Sinking Sword and the sword array. There was no need yet to deploy the Profound Mirror Cold Fierce Array.</p><p>Soon, the first wave of tribulation lightning neared its end.</p><p>Tianmudie had only managed to absorb two bolts of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Threads of lightning shimmered on its wings, and its two eyes resembled thunder eyes, emitting a strange light and the awe-inspiring aura of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Apart from that, no significant changes were visible in Tianmudie itself.</p><p>Bai had once commented that Tianmudie's absorption of the tribulation lightning indicated unlimited potential, but it still had a long way to go before it could truly grow and help Qin Sang survive the tribulation.</p><p>During a lull in the heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Tianmudie returned to Qin Sang's shoulder, absorbing the tribulation lightning energy within its body with all its might.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the heavens.</p><p>The heavenly tribulation caused a celestial phenomenon.  The tribulation clouds were boundless, the wind strong enough to rip up the grass, leaving the surrounding wasteland in disarray.</p><p>In the center of the tribulation clouds, the clouds churned, brewing more tribulation lightning.  Earth-shattering explosions echoed from high above, continuously, the center of the cloud growing brighter, with arcs of electricity flashing constantly.</p><p>The electric arcs tore through the tribulation clouds, revealing a glimpse of the inside—countless thunder pythons lay there, containing terrifying tribulation lightning power.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>The rumbling continued, the electric arcs in the tribulation clouds becoming denser. Even before the tribulation lightning struck, its power surpassed that of the first wave.</p><p>Countless electric arcs filled the sky, converging on the surface of the tribulation clouds, forming finger-thick electric serpents that detached from the clouds and fell.</p><p>All the tribulation lightning simultaneously targeted Qin Sang. Countless electric serpents converged towards the same direction, gathering above Qin Sang's head. It was impossible to tell whether they had merged or not before an extremely thick pillar of lightning crashed down!</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp tingled, not daring to be careless. He quickly cast an incantation to activate the Profound Mirror Cold Fierce Array.</p><p>"Whoosh whoosh…"</p><p>A cold wind whipped up within the spirit array, and the temperature plummeted.</p><p>Thick layers of frost formed on the ground, instantly plunging the area into winter.</p><p>However, the spirit array's power was limited to the area around Qin Sang. The cold wind was tangible, emitting a bone-chilling white mist, swirling around Qin Sang.</p><p>The cold wind formed hundreds of cyclones at precisely three meters above Qin Sang, arranged with remarkable regularity, forming a hemisphere centered on him.</p><p>The cyclones formed rapidly, then abruptly solidified, transforming into round ice mirrors, their surfaces facing the tribulation clouds above, reflecting the lightning, shining brightly.</p><p>The cold wind within the array intensified, almost obscuring Qin Sang's figure. The cold energy continuously supported and reinforced the ice mirrors.</p><p>The moment the array formed, the tribulation lightning descended!</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his previous tactic, silently maneuvering his sword techniques. A sword beam shot into the sky.  The space illuminated by the tribulation lightning suddenly turned dark.  Countless sword threads formed a dense sword net, then were struck by the furious tribulation lightning, becoming brilliantly bright.</p><p>The sword net and tribulation lightning instantly intertwined, with crackling sounds erupting as countless bolts of tribulation lightning dissipated within the sword array.  However, the sword net was also torn layer by layer.</p><p>And the tribulation lightning didn't stop there; more and more electric serpents continued to fall from above.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind; the sword array descended, almost merging with the Profound Mirror Cold Fierce Array, the sword threads and ice mirrors interweaving.  Then, they were swallowed by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>"Bang bang bang…"</p><p>The ice mirrors were struck by the tribulation lightning, shaking incessantly.  Clumps of cold light burst forth from their surfaces, like blooming ice flowers, coldly beautiful.</p><p>Ice flowers, sword threads, and tribulation lightning together painted a rare and spectacular scene.</p><p>The seemingly thin ice mirrors proved surprisingly sturdy, continually absorbing the cold wind from below and, in conjunction with the sword array, reflecting countless tribulation lightning bolts back.  Seeing the situation stabilize, Qin Sang allowed some tribulation lightning to penetrate, for Tianmudie to absorb.</p><p>Just as he was concentrating on surviving the tribulation.</p><p>In the northern part of the wasteland, there were scattered mountain ranges.</p><p>In an unnamed valley.</p><p>The valley was perpetually shrouded in mist, home to a powerful cultivator family.</p><p>Of course, this is only in comparison to the nearby region. The clan's leader is a late-stage Golden Core cultivator; in the entire Central Plains, he's not particularly impressive.</p><p>Because of the proximity, Qin Sang's tribulation alarmed the cultivators in the valley.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Streams of light of various colors burst from the mist one after another, revealing an elderly man already standing there.</p><p>“Greetings, Clan Leader!”</p><p>Everyone followed the Clan Leader's gaze toward the center of the wasteland.</p><p>From a distance, they could only vaguely see the unusual gathering of clouds in the sky, but the oppressive might of Heaven's power was very clear, making them tremble with fear.</p><p>“Which senior is undergoing tribulation there?”</p><p>A young woman covered her mouth and whispered, a mixture of fear and curiosity.</p><p>The Central State is renowned for its abundance of experts. Even if they haven't met them personally, they've heard countless legends.</p><p>“The wasteland is uninhabited, and there are no major forces nearby. I remember a record in the clan mentioning that a senior also underwent tribulation here before.  This senior isn't undergoing tribulation within a sect, but outside. Could it be a hermit cultivator?” said a middle-aged man next to the young woman.</p><p>Dressed in a Daoist robe, he bore a facial resemblance to the young woman and held a high position among the group. He looked at the Clan Leader inquiringly.</p><p>The Clan Leader nodded.  “Golden Core cultivators, come with me. Everyone else, return to the valley!”</p><p>The young men and women looked reluctant, but dared not disobey the Clan Leader's order and flew back to the valley.</p><p>The remaining few followed the Clan Leader, deliberately landing on the ground and using their movement techniques to approach the tribulation site.</p><p>During their journey, the elder revealed a previously unknown secret to his descendants for the first time: “Three thousand years ago, a senior passed through the wasteland, and for unknown reasons, was severely injured. He hastily underwent his tribulation and perished under the Heavenly Tribulation.  Our ancestor profited from obtaining his Nascent Soul relic… The Hengming Sect and the Lu family are likely to have also dispatched people. If there's a chance to seize the Nascent Soul relic, it will be a fierce battle.  Be prepared. But you must remember this: Unless you are certain that the cultivator has perished, do not approach!”</p><p>“May this senior perish!”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator chuckled darkly, his face full of anticipation.</p><p>As they moved through the tall grass, the terrifying tribulation thunderbolts shocked them, causing them to stop far away.</p><p>“This is the Heavenly Tribulation... truly earth-shattering...”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator stared at the tribulation thunder, a mixture of awe and fear, muttering to himself, when a whistling sound startled him.  He looked up sharply to see a blade of energy streaking down from the sky ahead.</p><p>Everyone was startled. The clansmen, working in perfect coordination, summoned identical spirit swords, forming a sword formation around the Clan Leader.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blade of energy pierced through the sword formation, its remaining force carving a several-hundred-meter-long trench in the ground. The trench and surrounding grass were frozen solid.</p><p>The sword formation was broken instantly. The flying swords scattered on the ground, frozen into ice, some even shattering on impact.</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>A cold shout followed.</p><p>The several Golden Core cultivators stared blankly at their broken swords, their backs turning cold. They hadn't even seen the attacker, fleeing north in panic.</p><p>On the Flying Cloud River.</p><p>Originating in the Northern Wastelands and flowing into the South China Sea, traversing the Central Plains, the Flying Cloud River is also a major waterway of the continent, with countless vessels on its surface—the treasure ships of cultivators and the merchant ships of mortals, each following their own course.</p><p>At this time, a treasure ship with green curtains was sailing southward from the north.</p><p>The green-curtained treasure ship was traveling in the middle of the river, its speed lightning-fast.</p><p>Not only mortal merchant ships, but even other treasure ships would give way when encountering it, all because an elder was seated at the stern of the green-curtained ship.</p><p>The elder's expression was grim, his cultivation undisguised – a Nascent Soul ancestor!</p><p>Light silk curtains hung on the treasure ship; inside, there was the sound of silk and bamboo music and the shadow of a graceful dance.  A Nascent Soul ancestor was actually staying outside the curtains. If even this person didn’t have the qualification to enter, how terrifying must the identity of the person inside be?</p><p>A few cultivators noticed the blood moon mark on the elder's forehead, recalling a certain legend in the cultivation world, and involuntarily gasped, even more daring not to offend him.</p><p>The green-curtained treasure ship sailed down the river unimpeded.</p><p>The curtains, though not thick, only showed blurry shadows, fueling people's imaginations.</p><p>Inside the curtains.</p><p>Two desks stood on either side, each laden with fine wines and delicacies, emitting a fragrant aroma.</p><p>Two men sat cross-legged behind the desks.</p><p>A large space was left between them.</p><p>A woman plucked the strings of a zither.  This woman, dressed in green and with her face bare, possessed an otherworldly temperament. She was not only skilled in playing the zither, but also a stunning beauty of exceptional grace.</p><p>As she played, the woman in green didn’t look at the strings but gazed at the man in white behind the desk on the left, her beautiful eyes filled with affection.</p><p>Six dancing girls, their beauty rivaling that of the woman in the green robe, danced gracefully, their expressions a mixture of coquettishness and delight as they lingered lovingly on the men.  Their affection was palpable.</p><p>The man, dressed in white robes and a jade belt, exuded an air of refined elegance.  It was Su Zinan, the adopted son of a powerful cultivator!</p><p>The woman in green was a Golden Core cultivator who had miraculously survived for over two decades. The other women were beautiful concubines Su Zinan had collected along his travels.  His taste was impeccable; each was a stunning beauty.</p><p>Su Zinan, unexpectedly leaving Luye, had appeared in the Central Plains, making no attempt to hide his identity, openly employing a member of the Moon Guard to pilot his boat.</p><p>Su Zinan, unrestrained and carefree, drank a large cup of fine wine and beckoned with a gesture.</p><p>The woman in green readily nestled into his embrace.  The strings of a nearby instrument began to play without human intervention.</p><p>Clasping the beauty's willow waist, Su Zinan inhaled her fragrance deeply, then turned to the man across from him.  “Daoist Mo, what do you think of this ‘Dance of the Celestial Robe’?”</p><p>The other man, equally handsome and imposing as Su Zinan, remained impassive and unapproachable. He ignored the beautiful women, eschewed the wine, and with eyes closed, seemed absorbed in meditation. He shook his head slightly.  “Mo lacks the appreciation for such things, Daoist Su. Please forgive my lack of refinement.”</p><p>Su Zinan sighed. “Beautiful women are among the finest things in the world. In my view, they are as important as the Dao itself, indispensable. Daoist Mo, you shouldn't neglect life's other pleasures in your pursuit of cultivation.”</p><p>“I am alone, living cautiously, never allowing myself to relax. Unlike you, Daoist Su, who enjoys the protection of Elder Lu and lives without a care.”</p><p>The man’s words held a subtle edge of sarcasm.</p><p>Su Zinan remained unconcerned, instead praising him. “That is precisely what I admire most about Daoist Mo! From the start of your cultivation, you have refused to be bound, never joining any sect or faction.  You have survived multiple purges by various sects, and single-handedly decimated the Northern Wasteland's demonic cult, earning the respect of all and the title of the Northern Wasteland's foremost independent cultivator… What incredible resolve!”</p><p>Unmoved by the praise, Mo remained impassive.  He said calmly, “It's not that I refuse to be bound, but no one has offered me a price worth surrendering my freedom.”</p><p>Su Zinan smiled. “Daoist Mo, rest assured. I am a man of my word. Whether or not I find my adoptive father, as long as you help me wholeheartedly, after the matter is resolved, I will share my adoptive father's experience in achieving Golden Core ascension.  Furthermore, after my adoptive father's breakthrough, he went to the Central Plains and learned the secret of ascension. I will share that with you as well, Daoist Mo. Once you achieve Golden Core ascension, you will no longer need to rely on the Eight Views Sect or the Ganlu Zen Monastery, freeing yourself from their control.”</p><p>Mo opened his eyes, fixing his gaze on Su Zinan, his eyes blazing. “Ascension after achieving Golden Core is truly possible?”</p><p>Su Zinan didn't answer directly. He countered, “Throughout Central State, how many Golden Core cultivators have you heard of who advanced to mid-Golden Core and manifested their power publicly?  How many have perished under the Heavenly Tribulation? Remember, Golden Core cultivators, like us, face the forty-nine Heavenly Tribulations every three hundred years. Stagnation leads to death!”</p><p>“Then why do Golden Core cultivators disappear?”</p><p>Mo pressed.</p><p>In his opinion, nothing was more important than ascension. For him, the chance to ascend was paramount.  Why did these Golden Core cultivators disappear after seemingly being so close?</p><p>Su Zinan’s gaze flickered.  “If I knew my adoptive father's whereabouts, I wouldn't need to make such a public appeal for assistance, to bring you out of seclusion, Daoist Mo.  The Eight Views Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery certainly know something. I suspect my adoptive father is somehow connected to them, and this trip is to confront them!”</p><p>Mo remained silent.</p><p>Ascension was a beautiful vision. Other cultivators could only dream of it, using it as motivation. But for them, it was only a single Golden Core hurdle away!  It could be just within reach, or an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>The woman in green refilled Su Zinan's cup, gently raising it to his lips.</p><p>Su Zinan took a sip, then his expression shifted. He darted outside the tent, stood with his hands behind his back, gazing west.</p><p>Mo's spiritual senses were as keen as Su Zinan's. He emerged almost simultaneously, looking in the same direction.</p><p>Moments later, the Moon Guard at the stern of the boat sensed something amiss and hurried to the bow.  "Master, someone is undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation in the west."</p><p>Su Zinan turned to Mo.  “It's the forty-nine Heavenly Tribulation. The power is not particularly strong. Are you interested, Daoist Mo?”</p><p>Mo shook his head.  “I have no quarrel with that person.”</p><p>He turned and went back inside.</p><p>Su Zinan chuckled. “Never mind! It's too far. By the time we get there, they'll be long gone.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the wasteland.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely unaware of the unforeseen changes caused by the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Wave after wave of tribulation thunderbolts crashed down. By the end, the thunderbolts were as thick as pythons, possessing the power to destroy heaven and earth, forcing even him to be cautious, preventing his Sky-Eyed Butterfly from directly absorbing them.</p><p>The final thunderbolt seemed to tear through the void. The tribulation power in the clouds was unleashed without reservation, forming a gigantic ball of thunder.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed, infused with demonic fire, had already spread into a sea of flames in mid-air.  The instant the thunderball struck the Xuanjing Hanlie Array, the raging demonic fire counterattacked, engulfing the thunderball.</p><p>As expected, this Heavenly Tribulation posed no serious threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the deep crater blasted out by the tribulation thunderbolts, watching the rapidly dissipating clouds.</p><p>“The Heavenly Tribulation didn't undergo any changes, meaning Heaven has accepted this ‘body snatcher,’ hasn't it?”</p><p>With that thought, he summoned his avatar and immediately fled.</p>
