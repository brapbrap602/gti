<h1>Chapter 592: The Great Sun</h1><p>Qin Sang was stunned by Yun Youzi's shocking words. Even those blessed with Heavenly Spiritual Roots, who would dare to consider Nascent Soul formation a simple task?</p><p>As evidenced by Chen Yan resorting to demonic arts for her breakthrough.</p><p>Yet, Yun Youzi dared to claim such a feat!</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang recovered, realizing that Yun Youzi spoke of two tribulations. The first likely pertained to his damaged soul, but the second remained a mystery.</p><p>As they spoke, they finally broke through the layers of restrictions and left the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>With Yun Youzi leading the way, and Qin Sang remaining vigilant, they successfully avoided the demon cultivators of the Heavenly Demon Mound.  Upon reaching the outskirts of the garden and confirming their direction, they set off immediately.</p><p>Yun Youzi had mostly recovered and could travel independently, no longer needing Qin Sang's assistance, significantly increasing their speed.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his wrist and examined the wooden bracelet.</p><p>The bracelet showed no obvious changes, except for a slight dimming of its luster. The good news was that no cracks had appeared, so he didn't have to worry about it shattering for now.</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the distances between the places he planned to visit. Turning his head, he said, "Senior, there's a place I need to visit to retrieve something. It happens to be on the way to the Soul Gathering Hall. I plan to go there first. It shouldn't take too longâ€¦"</p><p>His original plan was to escort Yun Youzi to a place for healing after leaving the Ancient Medicine Garden, and then proceed alone to the place where Senior Qing Zhu disappeared, searching for any relics left behind.</p><p>This was because Yun Youzi's destination wasn't far from the Ancient Medicine Garden.</p><p>Now, however, he needed to go to the Soul Gathering Hall first to find the Three Lights Jade Liquid, making their route a zigzag.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu's last known location and the Soul Gathering Hall were in the same general direction, though slightly off course. Fortunately, it wouldn't require too much of a detour. To save time, Qin Sang had to change his plans.</p><p>The Purple Star Palace was vast and sparsely populated.</p><p>Unless their luck was exceptionally poor, they shouldn't encounter Duke Dongyang and Chen Yan so easily. Qin Sang and Yun Youzi didn't dare to fly openly in the sky, but they didn't have to be overly cautious either. Their speed traversing mountains and valleys was quite fast.</p><p>Before long, they found the mountain that Granny Jing had directed them to.</p><p>"It's within this mountain. Please wait here a moment, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards a peak ahead.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang understand why Granny Jing, when providing directions, had said that he would easily find the ancient hall's location upon reaching the vicinity of this mountain, without needing further guidance.</p><p>The mountain was surrounded by a ring of interconnected lakes, both large and small, their waters clear and pristine. Ancient trees, their age impossible to determine, lined the shores and covered the mountain slopes.</p><p>The deep forest was dense with foliage, vines thick as pythons.</p><p>Wisps of mist drifted from the canopy, not like ordinary water vapor, but tinged with a grayish-white hue. Qin Sang suspected it was miasma, formed from decaying matter accumulated and trapped within the forest, growing denser over time.</p><p>Such miasma was often poisonous and not to be underestimated.</p><p>However, its toxicity should be less potent than the Peach Blossom Miasma he had encountered before. With careful handling, it shouldn't pose a significant threat.</p><p>The mountain stood amidst the lakes, its entire form clearly visible.  Like the lower slopes, it was covered in towering ancient trees, a scene of deep green.</p><p>There were no mystical lights, nor any mysterious ancient halls.</p><p>Nor were there remnants of formations or ancient restrictions, manifesting any unusual phenomena.</p><p>Everything appeared normal.</p><p>Yet, when Qin Sang arrived, even before reaching the foot of the mountain, just standing at the edge of the lakes, he sensed a distinct anomaly.</p><p>The anomaly originated from the Ebony Sword!</p><p>Something within the mountain seemed to have established a faint connection with the Ebony Sword.</p><p>More precisely, with the Killing Rune inscribed upon the blade.</p><p>The Killing Rune emitted strange fluctuations, as if responding to a call from within the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke briefly to Yun Youzi, then leaped into the forest.  Activating his Corpse Core to ward off the miasma, he followed the faint connection, swiftly moving towards the mountain.</p><p>Granny Jing's directions had been vague, only specifying the mountain's location without mentioning any dangers within, as if she herself was unaware of the details.</p><p>Although the Purple Star Palace lacked living beings, it contained numerous strange restrictions and dangerous remnants of formations. Qin Sang didn't dare to seal his Corpse Core, instead taking out the Ten Yama Banners as a precaution, cautiously approaching the peak.</p><p>The closer he got to the foot of the mountain, the clearer the connection became.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang looked up, his gaze fixed on a spot near the summit.</p><p>There was nothing special about that location. Like other areas, it was densely covered with ancient trees, their enormous crowns overlapping like pagodas, blocking the sunlight and obscuring the view below.</p><p>He directly stepped onto the treetops and moved towards the spot.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The mountain wind rustled the leaves, creating a constant sound.</p><p>Yet, beneath the canopy, it was unusually muggy.  The poisonous miasma had reached even this height.  A grayish-white fog filled the air, and the ground beneath was covered in a thick layer of decaying matter accumulated over countless years, resembling a swamp and emitting a foul odor.</p><p>Qin Sang moved nimbly across the branches, and after a few leaps, finally found what he sought.</p><p>Now, standing on a protruding tree root, he found himself before a towering cliff. The surrounding trees were so tall that they had obscured it from view.</p><p>From the outside, it was impossible to tell that there was such a steep drop.</p><p>The cliff face was covered in thick vines, resembling giant pythons. Only through the gaps could he see the white rock beneath.</p><p>The cliff itself was unremarkable, the rock surface uneven, with no signs of restrictions. If not for the connection sensed by the Killing Rune emanating from within the cliff, Qin Sang would have easily overlooked it.</p><p>That inexplicable connection was undeniably present.</p><p>With the cliff obscured by vines, Qin Sang waved his hand, and his spiritual power manifested as countless blades, clearing the vines and revealing the entire cliff face.</p><p>Now, a subtle detail became apparent. The cliff was circular, like a great sun embedded in the mountain.</p><p>The cliff faced directly east.</p><p>It was easy to imagine that in the past, before the towering trees and dense vines, when the sun rose and purple energy flowed from the east, the bright morning sun would have shone directly upon the cliff!</p><p>At that time, two great suns would have illuminated each other, what a magnificent sight it must have been!</p><p>Unfortunately, as time passed and the Purple Star Palace declined, the former glory was lost, hidden beneath the wilderness.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, dispelling the fantasy and returning to reality.</p><p>Apart from the imagined scene, this was clearly an ordinary cliff. There was nothing unusual about it. Qin Sang flew to the top, carefully examining it from top to bottom, but found no inscriptions left by predecessors.</p><p>This place's connection to the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" was undeniable, yet there were no inscriptions, not even sword marks.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the cliff, then suddenly touched his brow.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Ebony Sword left its sheath, hovered briefly before Qin Sang, then suddenly blazed with light. A pure, ethereal sword energy shot forth!</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>The sword energy struck the cliff face. Qin Sang had held nothing back, unleashing his strongest, most familiar sword energy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the anticipated impact sound never came.</p><p>The sword energy vanished into thin air, leaving not even a scratch, as if swallowed by the cliff.</p>
