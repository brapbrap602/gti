<h1>Chapter 2132: A Message on the Immortal Mountain</h1><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The divine mountain trembled, and fissures erupted with azure light, birthing a wisp of Azure Spiritual Qi.  Min Zhuo's gaze followed the Azure Spiritual Qi as it drifted out from the depths of a fissure. He then peered into the fissure's depths, where the azure light was pure, and the mountain's body resembled a piece of azure jade.</p><p>He cautiously approached the fissure, the source of the Azure Spiritual Qi.  Reasoning that there might be treasures of even higher quality than the Azure Spiritual Qi within, he ventured closer.</p><p>His knowledge of Daiyu Immortal Mountain was limited. Ancient texts recorded it as one of the legendary primordial immortal mountains, but detailed descriptions of its wonders were lacking.</p><p>He had deduced the mountain's extraordinary nature for two reasons: the presence of Azure Spiritual Qi, and the existence of another primordial immortal mountain, Yuanjiao, equally renowned in ancient legends.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Sea Market was the grandest gathering of the Exotic Tribes, a convergence of all their branches. The sacred ground of the Exotic Tribes would open during this time.</p><p>The shared name, 'Yuanjiao,' was no coincidence. Legend held that the sacred ground and Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain were inextricably linked.  Crowning the Sea Market with the name 'Yuanjiao' demonstrated the significance of Yuanjiao Immortal Mountain, not only to the sacred ground but to the entire Exotic Tribes.</p><p>If the legends were true, Min Zhuo could imagine what claiming Daiyu Immortal Mountain would mean for the Changyou Tribe, and for himself.</p><p>At the very least, obtaining purer Azure Spiritual Qi from it would greatly enhance his and his tribesmen's cultivation.</p><p>However, the immortal mountain before him differed greatly from Min Zhuo's previous imaginings.</p><p>He had envisioned a celestial paradise, with wondrous immortal trees, exotic treasures scattered everywhere, and a magnificent atmosphere rivaling any blessed land or grotto-heaven.</p><p>The Daiyu Immortal Mountain before him, however, was a barren stone mountain. Not a single blade of grass was visible. Its peaks were indeed imposing, but its height was a mere thousand zhang.  To a Void Refinement cultivator, it was but a small hill, hardly resembling the legendary immortal mountain.</p><p>Upon first seeing Daiyu Immortal Mountain, Min Zhuo couldn't help but suspect that those who spoke of it had made a far-fetched connection, and this wasn't the true Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>However, the mystical Azure Spiritual Qi and the unusual fluctuations from the fissure proved that this was no ordinary mountain.  There was also another crucial piece of evidence.</p><p>Min Zhuo circled to the side of the immortal mountain and saw a stone platform beneath a cliff face.  On the platform stood an unremarkable stone stele, upon which were clearly inscribed the four ancient characters, 'Daiyu Immortal Mountain.' The characters radiated a divine light, powerful and extraordinary.</p><p>At the same time, Min Zhuo noticed numerous scattered markings here, clearly indicating that he wasn't the first to arrive.</p><p>The cliff face was covered in restrictions.  The markings were scattered among the layers of restrictions. Some were cryptic symbols, while others were lines of text left by different individuals.</p><p>In the distance, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol arrived silently.  Qin Sang quickly noticed the stone stele and the markings on the cliff face.</p><p>"It truly is Daiyu Immortal Mountain!"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Mo Xingdao's words. The mountain differed somewhat from his description.  Presumably, during the world's ascension, the immortal mountain had also been impacted and undergone changes.</p><p>However, it was certain that this was the same Daiyu Immortal Mountain that Mo Xingdao had seen in the depths of the Returning Ruin.</p><p>Back then, when they reached Daiyu Immortal Mountain, they rested and recovered on the stone platform where the stele stood.  Later, when they repeatedly attempted to breach the Gate of Dao Marks, they also relied on the platform for respite.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had said that in the depths of the Returning Ruin, this stone platform was the only place that could be considered safe.  The immortal mountain itself was fraught with peril, and they dared not venture onto it.</p><p>But now, the Gate of Dao Marks was gone, and the most dangerous ancient restrictions had dissipated. The area around the immortal mountain was tranquil; the unrest stemmed from the mountain itself.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had never mentioned this fissure or the Azure Spiritual Qi. It was likely that the world's ascension had caused the mountain to split open, and the Azure Spiritual Qi had appeared only then.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the cliff face. He saw the final messages of Mo Xingdao, the Azure Fox Holy King, and the Radiant Light Holy Master. The last time they left the platform, they had gone with the resolve to die.</p><p>The markings on the cliff face were chaotic, with many newly damaged sections, also destroyed during the ascension process.</p><p>Qin Sang discerned some of the markings.</p><p>Some were Daoist inheritances. These would naturally be precious in the lower realm, but Qin Sang's perspective had changed. Unless they originated from the Purple Star Palace, most were now damaged and worthless.</p><p>There were also insights from predecessors who had explored the Returning Ruin, intended as guidance for those who followed. Unfortunately, the Returning Ruin was not static, and the experiences of Mo Xingdao and the others had been far more arduous.</p><p>Another portion contained bold pronouncements made before ascension, and final messages left by those who had fallen short of their goals.</p><p>"Eh? Bao Gu!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes swept across the markings, and he immediately noticed a familiar name.</p><p>Her message was wedged between two layers of ancient restrictions, luckily spared from destruction.</p><p>Bao Gu mentioned that she had reached her limit and specifically urged those who followed, if they still had the strength, to attempt to retrace their steps and escape the Returning Ruin, leaving guidance for the descendants of the Azure Wave Sea.</p><p>This was merely Bao Gu's hopeful wish. Once inside, escaping was as difficult as ascending to heaven.  Generations of Central Continent sages had racked their brains to send out even fragmented messages. Until the Storm Realm ascended, no one had managed to return. Otherwise, the Returning Ruin wouldn't be so shrouded in mystery.</p><p>It seemed Bao Gu had successfully ascended to the Greater Heavens. Qin Sang wondered where she was now.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his search, attempting to find traces of Xiao Xiangzi, but unfortunately, he found none.</p><p>Not everyone would leave their name here, and too many areas had been damaged. The absence of a trace didn't necessarily mean Xiao Xiangzi hadn't been here.  With Xiao Xiangzi's talent, ascension was almost a certainty.</p><p>It was worth noting that among the names on the cliff face, Central Continent cultivators undoubtedly dominated. Those from more recent eras mostly belonged to sects like the Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.  Further back, one could see names from the Formless Immortal Sect, demonstrating the sect's former power.</p><p>While Qin Sang examined the messages, Min Zhuo also glanced over them, but unfortunately, there were no records related to Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the stone stele.  The stele was ancient, only knee-high, weathered by the passage of countless years, its surface dull and seemingly covered in dust.</p><p>An unremarkable stone stele, it had stood here for unknown millennia, seemingly without any unique qualities.</p><p>At least, that's how it appeared to the ascended cultivators of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The messages mentioned attempts to move the stele.  Although appearing ordinary, it remained unyielding. No magical treasure or Daoist technique could leave a mark on it.</p><p>Speculations on the cliff face ranged from unusual materials to hidden mechanisms.  One thing was certain: every attempt to explore the secrets of the stele and the immortal mountain had ended in failure, ultimately forcing them to abandon their ambitions of subduing the mountain and focus on breaching the Gate of Dao Marks.</p><p>However, one particular speculation was intriguing.  Someone suggested that the mountain's ability to stand firm in the depths of the Returning Ruin might indicate that it was itself a unique treasure.  Considering the entire mountain, the stele recording its name was the most peculiar element, and it might be the key to controlling this treasure.</p><p>Many years later, someone attempted this method, unsurprisingly failing, adding a note to warn others that even if the speculation was true, no one in the lower realm could achieve it, and future generations shouldn't waste their efforts.</p><p>Some refused to believe it, leading to a long string of subsequent attempts. Sadly, the bottom part of the cliff face had crumbled, and the rest of the content was lost, leaving unknown whether anyone had actually discovered anything.</p><p>Those who ascended in the past were at most Deity Transformation cultivators. The mysteries they couldn't unravel were not entirely inscrutable to Qin Sang and Min Zhuo!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the stele, his eyes gleaming, somewhat regretting not bringing the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. It would have allowed him to see more clearly.</p><p>He perceived a subtle, elusive energy flow on the immortal mountain. He could only grasp faint traces of its pathways. Coincidentally, these energies all converged on a single point: the location of the stone stele!</p><p>Undoubtedly, the stele had a special function. Whether it was the key to claiming the immortal mountain remained to be seen.</p><p>He glanced at Min Zhuo, who had come directly to Daiyu Immortal Mountain, suggesting he knew something. Could it be, as speculated on the cliff face, that the immortal mountain itself was a treasure?</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Min Zhuo was also hesitant, unsure whether to explore the fissure first, searching for the source of the Azure Spiritual Qi, or attempt to control the stele and claim Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>The polluted Qi receded for a limited time, and he had to leave before it surged back.</p><p>He looked away from the stele and back at the fissure.</p><p>Forcing his way into the fissure might be a loss if there was only Azure Spiritual Qi inside.</p><p>But subduing the immortal mountain wasn't easy either.  He had initially assumed the mountain had fallen here accidentally, hidden from the light of day. Now it seemed the mountain was held here by some force. Even if he controlled the mountain, he wasn't certain he could take it away. Moreover, he couldn't pinpoint the source of that binding force and was unsure whether his actions would trigger changes in the surrounding ancient restrictions.</p><p>Time didn't permit a thorough investigation.</p><p>Recalling the price he had paid and the painstaking efforts he had undertaken, Min Zhuo gritted his teeth and moved towards the stone stele!</p><p>Seeing Min Zhuo's actions, a cold glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  He realized the stele was indeed the key to claiming the immortal mountain.  He couldn't let Min Zhuo touch it. If he managed to take the immortal mountain, the consequences were unpredictable!</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated.  The Azure Roc Dharma Idol suddenly spread its wings, thunder rumbled, and azure light shone brilliantly.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang appeared, Min Zhuo immediately sensed an unusual fluctuation, a warning surging through him, his heart pounding.</p><p>Fortunately, he was about to attempt to claim the immortal mountain. As a precaution, he had secretly prepared a divine ability, which he now instinctively unleashed. The sound of rushing water filled the air.</p><p>A great river appeared out of thin air in the darkness, its currents swift and meandering, swirling around Min Zhuo and transforming into a towering giant.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The giant roared like crashing waves, shaking the very depths.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of azure lightning tore across the void, even faster. When the thunder reverberated through the abyss, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol had already closed in on Min Zhuo.</p><p>Looking at the giant Min Zhuo had become, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  With the body of the Azure Roc Dharma Idol, he charged forward!</p><p>In several previous battles, Min Zhuo had used this divine ability more than once, and it was indeed formidable.</p><p>In fact, the bloodline divine abilities of the Exotic Tribes were all exceptional.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't taken Min Zhuo seriously before and hadn't specifically prepared countermeasures.  However, when the same divine ability was used multiple times against a Void Refinement cultivator, weaknesses would inevitably be revealed, unless the divine ability was flawless or sufficiently concealed.</p><p>Moreover, Min Zhuo had only recently achieved his breakthrough, and his mastery of the divine ability was not yet complete.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, Min Zhuo's divine ability was far from perfect.  He instantly made his decision.  Azure light flashed on the Azure Roc Dharma Idol's chest. The Spirit Tablet shot out, hurtling towards the water giant.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Min Zhuo recognized the Azure Roc Dharma Idol, utterly incredulous.</p><p>Faced with the powerful Lu King's army, with the Grand Offering personally fighting, how could he, how dare he split off a Dharma Idol to compete for Daiyu Immortal Mountain!</p><p>Shock, fear, regret…</p><p>He had no time to process these emotions.  The forceful wind struck. Even though Min Zhuo's reaction wasn't slow, it was too hasty.  The water giant hurriedly raised its arms to defend.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Spirit Tablet, as massive as a small mountain, slammed into the water giant's forearms with terrifying force. Ripples spread through the void as the giant's arms suddenly became translucent, as if unable to bear the impact, reverting to their original form.</p><p>The water giant's entire body shuddered, falling downwards into the deeper abyss. Min Zhuo felt his internal Qi stagnate. Although he wasn't injured, it was far from pleasant.</p><p>This attack was only the beginning.  Just as the water giant fell, azure light blossomed again before it.</p><p>The Azure Roc Lightning Escape was a top-tier escape technique even among Void Refinement techniques.  Min Zhuo couldn't dodge at all.  He could only watch helplessly as the Azure Roc Dharma Idol approached, utterly powerless.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol extended a sharp claw, poised to strike the water giant's chest.</p><p>The terrifying element wasn't the claw itself, but the azure lightning arcing across its surface – the Azure Roc True Lightning that Qin Sang had infused into the Dharma Idol!</p><p>Before the battle had even begun, Min Zhuo had witnessed the power of the Azure Roc True Lightning. Now, terror gripped him.</p><p>At this critical juncture, with no escape, the water giant could only curl into a ball, transforming into a massive sphere of water, encasing Min Zhuo within its core.</p><p>The water sphere was dense, the water within shimmering with a silvery light, like liquid mercury.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The surface of the water sphere was struck by the giant claw, water spraying everywhere as it caved inwards.</p><p>The claw tore through unimpeded, piercing into the water sphere.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the water sphere possessed another unique property. Its interior seemed to expand endlessly.  As fast as the Azure Roc Dharma Idol charged, Min Zhuo retreated within the water sphere at an equal pace. The distance between the claw and him was closing, but at a much slower rate.</p><p>'Boom, boom, boom…'</p><p>The water sphere violently churned.  Clearly, this divine ability had its limits, but it bought Min Zhuo some time to employ other means.</p><p>However, Min Zhuo had still underestimated the power of the attack.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Azure lightning erupted, instantly filling the water sphere with electric arcs.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression froze. If his protective treasure hadn't been destroyed, he might have been able to buy more time, but there were no ifs.</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred Lake.</p><p>Changyou Tribe Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Min Shu sat cross-legged before the wax figure, focused on activating the formation.</p><p>A faint layer of flame burned on the wax figure, the fire steady. The figure was thinner than before, but it seemed capable of lasting a while longer.</p><p>Suddenly, Min Shu froze, then his face paled in horror.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flames on the wax figure erupted, the melting rate accelerating dramatically. The white wax flowed like water down its body, quickly pooling on the ground.</p>
