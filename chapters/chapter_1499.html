<h1>Chapter 1490: The Imitator (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1490: The Imitator (4k)</p><p>“Choose a magic treasure.”</p><p>After entering the archway, Qin Sang inexplicably had this thought.</p><p>He was startled, and roughly understood the situation.</p><p>“This is the limitation that Liuli and Shi Xue mentioned.”</p><p>During the trial in the Cleansing Pool, he had to choose one item from all his magic treasures and could only use that one throughout the entire process.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool’s restrictions were unpredictable and varied; the limitations were numerous and could appear at any level, making it impossible to prepare specifically.</p><p>Most of a cultivator's power comes from their magic treasures and divine abilities, especially their lifebound treasure, which is extremely important.</p><p>Other cultivators would undoubtedly choose their lifebound treasure, but everyone has weaknesses.  Powerful divine abilities are rare, and even if found, they may not be suitable for cultivation. Yuan Ying cultivators usually choose to purchase or refine corresponding magic treasures to compensate for their weaknesses.</p><p>For an average cultivator, encountering this kind of restriction would result in a loss of 20% of their strength.</p><p>It was undeniably harsh.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he pondered whether the so-called 'magic treasure' restriction included his lifebound insect and external avatar.</p><p>“If so, it should be a restriction on all ‘external forces’,” Qin Sang mused.</p><p>He could only choose between the Jincheng Sword and the Demon Banner.</p><p>Sealing the Jincheng Sword would also prevent him from using the Seven Souls Killing Array.  Sealing the Demon Banner would leave him only with the demon fire refined within the Fire Lotus, significantly reducing its power.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang chose the Demon Banner.</p><p>He summoned all the Demon Banners, silently indicating his choice and specifying that it was *all* the banners, to avoid any misunderstanding by the restriction and being allowed only one.</p><p>The Banner poles came from the same ancient treasure, sealed with the same spirit fire, and could be considered a single entity.</p><p>However, after waiting for a while, there was no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, and with a thought, summoned the Jincheng Sword from the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The moment the sword appeared, the fog suddenly thickened, and a strange fluctuation spontaneously arose, violently gathering towards Qin Sang. Before he could react, the Jincheng Sword was covered with runes and disappeared instantly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt the Jincheng Sword weigh a thousand pounds, sealed by some force.</p><p>His connection to the Jincheng Sword remained, not severed, but the sword could clearly no longer be used; otherwise, he wouldn’t know how he'd die.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the Jincheng Sword and then summoned his external avatar.</p><p>As expected, his external avatar moved normally and was not restricted.</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved, activated the demon fire to surround himself, and examined his surroundings.</p><p>All he could see was white mist.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly was not restricted, but the Sky Eye ability was affected by the mist, narrowing his field of vision.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself on a jade white corridor, suspended in mid-air, only two steps wide, with an unfathomable abyss below, incredibly dangerous.</p><p>The corridor stretched straight to the deepest point.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that falling off the corridor would lead to something he didn't want to see.</p><p>He was alone on the entire corridor, nothing else present, no sign of the cultivator surnamed Yue, yet it gave him a sense of oppression.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Surrounded by demon fire, Qin Sang stepped forward.</p><p>His footsteps were silent on the corridor; despite the lack of support below, the corridor was extremely stable and did not shake.</p><p>As Qin Sang walked, on another corridor, the cultivator surnamed Yue was proceeding cautiously, his face vigilant.</p><p>He was wary not only of what lay ahead, but also behind him.</p><p>Seeing no one appearing from behind, the cultivator surnamed Yue felt relieved and focused on the challenge ahead.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang, the cultivator surnamed Yue was not only accompanied by the Python Flag but also had a screen-shaped magic treasure, engraved with a landscape painting, floating above his head.</p><p>A faint white light flickered at his brow, forming a stele pattern.</p><p>This was a secret talisman bestowed by the Xuan Tian Palace, which could weaken the suppression in this place—an advantage for newcomers like the cultivator surnamed Yue compared to Qin Sang and Shang Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang could not detect the situations of others at this time.</p><p>He continued along the corridor, never encountering an opponent, gradually increasing his speed.</p><p>Suddenly, an evil wind struck.</p><p>The evil wind came without warning, but Qin Sang remained vigilant, reacted swiftly, and immediately activated the demon fire to create a wall of fire in front of him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The fire wall successfully blocked the evil wind.</p><p>The moment the evil wind dissipated, a phantom-like ghostly figure brushed against the demon fire, let out a scream, and hastily fled into the white mist, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the direction in which the ghostly figure escaped, and did not pursue.</p><p>The encounter was brief, providing little information. Qin Sang focused on the ghostly figure itself; despite being able to scream, it didn't seem to be a living creature.</p><p>He thought for a moment and continued forward.</p><p>Shadows swarmed, harassing Qin Sang.  Seizing an opportunity, he trapped one with his demonic fire. It instantly dissolved into mist, confirming its origin as a product of the ancient prohibition.</p><p>He dismissed the matter, using the demonic fire to eliminate all the obstructing shadows.</p><p>The shadows grew stronger further in, but the demonic fire’s power was more than sufficient; he didn't need other abilities. His external manifestation followed closely behind, ready with a defensive spell, prepared to intervene at any moment.</p><p>With the Ruyi Pearl restricted, Qin Sang used his external manifestation to enhance his own protection.</p><p>Countless shadows perished in the demonic fire.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang saw a different scene.</p><p>The corridor ended at a wide, circular platform, with a stone statue at its center.</p><p>All the shadows vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the platform.  The instant his gaze met the statue's, it came alive.  Its stone eyes moved slightly, fixing on Qin Sang with a challenging gaze!</p><p>"Challenge this statue to proceed."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the void on the other side of the platform, understanding dawned.  Without hesitation, he attacked.</p><p>Demonic fire formed a fiery dragon, charging towards the statue.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>The void around the statue rippled, and a magical artifact materialized—a python banner!</p><p>That wasn't all.</p><p>A soft glow flickered above the statue's head, and a landscape screen appeared.</p><p>He had seen a cultivator surnamed Yue use these artifacts outside the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>The statue was imitating the intruder!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Battle intent surged in the statue's eyes. It retreated a step, simultaneously drawing the landscape screen into the void, projecting the painted landscape into reality, then vanished into the painting.</p><p>The scroll enveloped the platform, rapidly spreading towards Qin Sang, intending to pull him into the painting, to become a mere ink stroke.</p><p>The python banner attacked simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, immediately splitting his demonic fire. Half formed a fire barrier to counter the landscape screen, while his figure flickered, wielding the other half to charge at the python banner.</p><p>The snow python on the banner roared, the familiar jade-white Xuan light appeared before Qin Sang!</p><p>He had worked with Liuli to break the python banner, understanding its patterns perfectly.</p><p>One snow python was hardly a challenge.</p><p>Without dodging, Qin Sang's fingers moved rapidly, transforming the demonic fire into a dozen black arrows, piercing the jade-white Xuan light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Xuan light shattered, revealing the banner's true form.</p><p>Demonic fire immediately surrounded the banner, forcing out the snow python.  It was incinerated amidst its roars, the whole process incredibly lifelike.</p><p>After the snow python's death, the banner disintegrated.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed; the statue's artifacts could be destroyed and wouldn't reappear, making the fight much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the ink landscape that was nearly covering the platform, condensed his demonic fire, allowing the landscape to engulf him, and counterattacked.</p><p>Qin Sang disappeared, becoming a speck of ink in the scroll.</p><p>The peace was short-lived.  Fierce flames erupted within the delicate ink, spreading rapidly, engulfing half the landscape in an instant.</p><p>The statue showed no emotion, but its combat experience was evident. It hurriedly tried to regain control of its artifact, but it was too late.</p><p>Demonic fire fiercely broke through the scroll, charging towards the statue.</p><p>Before the statue could react, a wave of cold energy burst from the gap created by the demonic fire, freezing it solid.</p><p>Qin Sang and his external manifestation emerged side-by-side.  They pointed at the statue, and the fiery dragon struck.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The statue shattered, Qin Sang had won.</p><p>The strange occurrences on the platform ceased, a new corridor appeared ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush forward, reflecting on the battle.</p><p>"The statue used two artifacts, meaning the Yue cultivator wasn't restricted."</p><p>"The Yue cultivator wouldn't be unskilled in Dao techniques, yet the statue only used these two artifacts repeatedly.  Perhaps the Yue cultivator didn't use them, and it couldn't imitate them spontaneously."</p><p>"I wonder if others faced the same. The statue imitating the intruders' abilities, becoming an obstacle for them.  They would recognize my identity from the demonic banner.  Having entered the Cleansing Pool, exposure doesn't matter much."</p><p>"But if I'd chosen the Sun God Tree, wouldn't this contest be over now?"</p><p>Qin Sang was overthinking.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool wasn't simply a test of strength. To prevent someone from sweeping through with a single artifact, there was a restriction: the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was already exceeding the limit.</p><p>On another platform.</p><p>The Yue cultivator watched the ethereal flames dissipate with the statue, his face grave.</p><p>“This… such powerful spirit fire. Could it be him?”</p><p>He had been secluded in the Tianshan Mountains, unaware of Qin Sang’s reputation, but he could still deduce that his fellow competitors wouldn't possess such a treasure.</p><p>The Yue cultivator's expression shifted, a sense of crisis arising in his heart, his pace unconsciously quickening.</p><p>He was lucky; he encountered a Qin Sang imitation statue on the first platform. His external avatar hadn't been used before this.</p><p>Others would face both Qin Sang and his avatar simultaneously!</p><p>…</p><p>As time passed,</p><p>Qin Sang encountered two more statues, each wielding different magical treasures and divine abilities, clearly imitating other competitors.</p><p>The stronger he appeared, the more likely the statues imitating him could clear the obstacles and eliminate all competitors, but Qin Sang sensed something wasn't right.</p><p>Would the statues imitating him only target others?</p><p>Ultimately, could they become his roadblocks, his self-cultivated opponents?</p><p>Considering this, throughout the process, Qin Sang only used his demonic fire and avatar to deal with the statues, refraining from using other methods.</p><p>Defeating the third statue,</p><p>Qin Sang continued forward.</p><p>Soon, another platform appeared ahead in the corridor.</p><p>Unlike before, the statue on this platform remained motionless.</p><p>This new development caught Qin Sang's attention. “Is this the final test? Only three competitors entered, or are there only three trials?  Could it be that Shang Lu didn't come in?”</p><p>He pondered this, circling the edge of the platform, feeling a certain intuition. Turning back, he saw the corridor had vanished.</p><p>Silence surrounded him, offering no clues.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined everything, attempting to attack the statue, but was blocked by a restriction, forcing him to wait patiently.</p><p>Fortunately, the statue didn't make him wait long.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The statue suddenly moved, its eyes slowly opening.</p><p>Then, a shocking sight unfolded:  before the statue, countless demonic banners materialized out of thin air, identical to the ones Qin Sang carried.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The banners fluttered, a torrent of black spirit fire surging forth, its appearance and aura nearly identical to his demonic fire!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank slightly.  As he suspected.</p><p>The question remained whether the statue's spirit fire was merely a facade.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the statue's transformations weren't over.</p><p>Qin Sang stared dumbfounded as a python banner appeared beside the statue, a bronze cauldron hovered above its head, it formed hand seals, a seven-colored armor covered its body…</p><p>And it even manifested an external avatar!</p><p>All the techniques and treasures Qin Sang had used, along with the strongest ones displayed by the previous three statues, were now combined in this single entity.</p><p>Those eligible to compete for the Cleansing Pool were all geniuses of the Xuantian Palace, the best among their peers. Their skills were all secret techniques of the Xuantian Palace; none were weak.</p><p>With so many treasures and divine abilities combined, plus the powerful spirit fire and external avatar, it was almost impossible to find a weakness.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang encountered such an opponent.</p><p>For a moment, he didn't know where to begin.</p><p>The statue gave Qin Sang no time to think. Its body glowed brilliantly, the light of treasures and spells flashing alternately, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The bronze cauldron inverted, its mouth aimed at Qin Sang.</p><p>The statue swung its arm, its ice fan shooting out icy blasts that formed a blizzard, filled with ice shards sharper than blades, instantly engulfing half the platform.</p><p>Simultaneously, the statue's external avatar and the python banner attacked from both flanks.</p><p>Qin Sang was surrounded on three sides, the situation critical.</p><p>Remaining calm, he employed his usual tactics, sending his external avatar to confront the statue's avatar.  He then used the Heart Knot Transfer Seal to break free from the cauldron's binding force, stepped on the Lotus Flower Seal, weaving through the blizzard like a phantom, and charged towards the python banner.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as he was about to approach the banner, the statue's spirit fire arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and didn't underestimate it. His figure paused slightly before he fully activated his demonic fire to block it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Flames filled the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The statue's spirit fire was slightly weaker than his, but it was undoubtedly a top-tier divine ability.</p><p>The statue was extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p>It had almost no weaknesses, seamlessly combining everyone's abilities and treasures.</p><p>To forcibly kill the statue within the Cleansing Pool's time limit was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>Remembering the time he waited earlier, it must have been to allow others to arrive.  The opponent for everyone would be the same.</p><p>It seemed the final trial wasn't about defeating the statue, but about who could last longer!</p><p>But delaying too long would mean missing the Cleansing Pool.</p><p>In that case, why not change his approach, perhaps helping the statue so that his opponent would be defeated sooner?</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Qin Sang, and a plan formed in his mind.</p>
