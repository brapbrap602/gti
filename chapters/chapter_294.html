<h1>Chapter 287: Rainbow Bridge</h1><p>Even if one received a real favor, he would only have to bow respectfully or, at most, kowtow three times to thank the master of the cave府.</p><p>After all, the master of the cave府 was long dead and this so-called thank you gift was simply to make the mind relaxed. Why waste time at this moment on the繁瑣 and laborious prostration ceremony?</p><p>Yu Kong appeared serious and performed the ritual very strictly. Qin Sang and the others complained in their hearts but dared not comment and could only wait patiently.</p><p>After the last symbolic ritual, Yu Kong did not stand up but, instead, raised his head to look at the clay statue.</p><p>His gaze fell on the clay statue’s left hand and his eyes revealed a hint of irrepressible excitement and anticipation.</p><p>The clay statue’s left hand was not making any hand gestures. It was simply placed flat on its knee, palm facing up, thumb retracted while the four fingers were flat and straight, pointing out of the main hall.</p><p>The moment Yu Kong finished prostrating, a gleam of rainbow light suddenly erupted from the clay statue’s fingertips.</p><p>An unexpected change occurred. Who would have thought that there would be a secret hidden in such an ordinary looking clay statue?</p><p>The interior of the main hall was thrown into chaos. Everyone was shocked and their gazes shifted between the clay statue and Yu Kong. Their expressions were filled with disbelief.</p><p>After all, after the Qiuhong Market had been discovered, countless immortal cultivators had visited and checked it out from top to bottom. This legacy main hall had been turned upside down and the clay statue had definitely been inspected from top to bottom. It was completely an ordinary statue.</p><p>Among them were even Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Before Yu Kong, no one had discovered the secret of the clay statue!</p><p>The rainbow light was released and eventually formed a rainbow bridge that spanned half of the main hall.</p><p>The rainbow bridge had the shape of an arch bridge but only half of it. One end landed in front of Yu Kong while the other end was connected to the clay statue’s palm and disappeared into the void.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart jumped.</p><p>Was this rainbow bridge the ‘hidden path’ that led to the medicine garden?</p><p>If not for seeing it with his own eyes, who would have thought that the so-called hidden path would be hidden in such an obvious location and activated in such a strange way?</p><p>The rainbow light filled the main hall with colorful rainbows. It seemed that Yu Kong had anticipated this. The moment the rainbow light appeared, he waved his hand and a wave of spirit energy blocked the entrance, preventing the light from leaking out and being seen by the people outside.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Yu Kong laughed towards the sky, “That friend did not deceive me! In today’s world, morals have collapsed and immortal cultivators only know how to search for treasure but do not know gratitude. Otherwise, how could the secret of the clay statue only be discovered by Yu in this day and age?”</p><p>Seeing Yu Kong laughing, everyone came back to their senses, looked at each other, and Yue Ya Xian asked sweetly, “Senior Yu, why have we never heard of such a strange aspect of the clay statue? Could it be that Senior was the first to discover it? Is the treasure vault of the cave府 master connected to this rainbow bridge?”</p><p>Yu Kong stopped laughing and looked over with a faint smile, “Regardless of where it leads, do you fellow Daoists not want to enter?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone’s eyes flashed with a hint of excitement. Wu Chen said carefully, “There is a secret ahead, and I would definitely like to enter. However, this rainbow bridge was first discovered by Fellow Daoist Yu. We must have Fellow Daoist’s consent before entering. I do not know what Fellow Daoist Yu’s requirements are. As long as you say it, we will definitely listen to Fellow Daoist Yu.”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Although the purpose of this hidden rainbow bridge was unknown, it was definitely a significant existence and it was very possible that no one had ever set foot there before. There might even be more valuable treasures than those in the Spirit Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Even if they could only get a fraction of it, it would still be exciting.</p><p>As long as Yu Kong did not want to take everything for himself, everyone was willing to accept any requirements.</p><p>Yu Kong laughed softly, “Since Yu has invited Fellow Daoists here, I will not abandon you and take everything for myself. I do not know what is on the other side of the rainbow bridge or if there are any treasures. There could even be restrictions that are more dangerous than the Spirit Treasure Pavilion… Does anyone want to withdraw?”</p><p>At this moment, who could resist the temptation?</p><p>Moreover, they had already seen the secret. What would happen to them if they withdrew now?</p><p>No one withdrew. Yu Kong nodded with satisfaction and glanced outside the main hall, urging everyone, “Let’s go in now. We can’t stay here for too long.”</p><p>Yan Wu led the way and everyone lined up to walk onto the rainbow bridge. Yu Kong walked at the back.</p><p>Qin Sang followed quietly.</p><p>He did not immediately crush the Soul Synchronizing Jade. Although he was fairly certain that the rainbow bridge was the hidden path, it was better to not rashly send a message before he had a clear understanding of the situation on the other side of the rainbow bridge. Otherwise, he might end up being counterproductive.</p><p>He could see some clues from the jade. It seemed that the spirit medicines would not be so easy to collect. There was no need to rush.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang could not figure out Yu Kong’s intentions.</p><p>If he genuinely wanted to join forces with them to search for treasures and for everyone to have a happy safe journey, that would be fine.</p><p>If it was really like how Sheng Yuanzi had mocked and Yu Kong was just trying to find some scapegoats, then Yun Youzi and Ge Yuan were definitely necessary pawns for him. After all, he had already killed Shao Chunhui, so would Yu Kong care about killing more people?</p><p>Thinking of all this, Qin Sang watched the people ahead of him disappear at the end of the rainbow bridge one by one. It was finally his turn.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, secretly on guard, and stepped out at the break in the Rainbow Bridge, then there was a moment of darkness before his eyes, and he was not stepping on the void, but on the ground.</p><p>Everyone appeared in a cave, the outside of the cave entrance was dimly lit and misty. There was no danger in the cave, there were no restrictions, and everyone's expressions relaxed slightly as they turned to look at Yu Kong, who was the last to come in.</p><p>Yu Kong reached out and stroked the stone wall, and the Rainbow Bridge disappeared.</p><p>"The treasure is just ahead, what are you waiting for?"</p><p>Yu Kong said, and took the lead out of the cave.</p><p>Walking out of the cave, Qin Sang saw with his own eyes the scene shown in the jade pendant, and finally confirmed that this was where the Herb Garden was!</p><p>However, this place was far more vast than Qin Sang had imagined!</p><p>Outside the cave was a vast plain, with a few low peaks scattered across it, nothing special, except for the tallest mountain on the plain, which was exactly the peak shown in the jade pendant.</p><p>Fog locked the distant mountains, the aura of spirit herbs pierced the fog, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>"Those...could they be spirit herbs planted by the cave master?"</p><p>Wu Chen exclaimed in a 失声, his eyes blazing with excitement. As for the others, they were all about the same as Wu Chen.</p><p>However, some people were still able to remain calm, and Elder Mu Teng said coldly: "Don't be in such a hurry to be happy, in my opinion, the miasma on that mountain is probably not ordinary miasma, but an unusually powerful restriction. Whether or not you can pick the spirit herbs is still uncertain."</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's words threw cold water on everyone, waking them up from their frenzy.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly, looking at Elder Mu Teng and saying, with an inexplicable meaning in his tone, "Fellow Daoist Mu Teng is indeed a sly old fox, no wonder Sheng Yuanzi trusts you to come here and lurk by Yu's side."</p><p>Everyone was shocked when they heard this, and they all distanced themselves from Elder Mu Teng.</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's face changed dramatically, he forced himself to remain calm, and argued: "Since I set foot on the path of immortality, I have been alone, I don't know any Sheng Yuanzi, I don't know what Fellow Daoist Yu is talking about..."</p><p>Chapter 287: The Rainbow Bridge</p><p>Even if they were truly grateful to the cave's owner, a simple bow would have sufficed, or perhaps three kowtows at most. After all, the owner was long deceased, and any show of gratitude was merely for peace of mind. Why waste time with such an elaborate ritual now?</p><p>Yu Kong performed the rites with solemn meticulousness, while Qin Sang and the others inwardly grumbled, not daring to speak out, and waited patiently.</p><p>Finally, the last rite completed, Yu Kong didn't rise but looked up at the clay statue. His gaze fixed on the statue's left hand, eyes gleaming with barely contained excitement and anticipation.</p><p>The statue's left hand wasn't formed into any particular gesture. It rested simply on its knee, palm up, thumb tucked in, and fingers pointing straight ahead towards the hall's exit.</p><p>Just as Yu Kong finished his bows, a ray of rainbow light suddenly burst forth from the statue’s fingertips.</p><p>This unexpected turn of events startled everyone. No one had imagined the seemingly ordinary statue held a secret.  The hall erupted in a cacophony of gasps and murmurs.  All eyes darted between the statue and Yu Kong, faces etched with disbelief.</p><p>After all, the Autumn Market, once discovered, had been visited by countless cultivators. The inheritance hall had been thoroughly searched, and the statue undoubtedly examined from top to bottom. It appeared to be nothing more than an ordinary sculpture.  Even Core Formation cultivators had inspected it.</p><p>Yet, before Yu Kong, no one had uncovered its secret!</p><p>The rainbow light intensified, transforming into a shimmering bridge that spanned half the hall. The bridge was arched, but only half-formed. One end rested before Yu Kong, while the other connected to the space above the statue's palm, disappearing into the void.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped.</p><p>Could this rainbow bridge be the hidden path to the medicinal garden?</p><p>If not witnessed firsthand, who would have guessed that the so-called hidden path was concealed in such plain sight, activated in such a peculiar manner?</p><p>The hall bathed in the multicolored light of the rainbow, Yu Kong, seemingly prepared, swiftly cast a spell, sealing the entrance to prevent the light from leaking out and attracting attention from outside.</p><p>"Haha..." Yu Kong laughed heartily, "That friend did not deceive me!  Morality has decayed in this world. Cultivators only seek treasure, not gratitude. Otherwise, how could it be that only now, has Yu discovered the statue's secret?"</p><p>Yu Kong's laughter brought everyone back to their senses.  They exchanged glances, and Crescent Fairy asked in a sweet voice, "Senior Yu, we've never heard of such wonders regarding this statue. Did you discover this first? Could this rainbow bridge lead to the cave owner's treasure vault?"</p><p>Yu Kong's laughter subsided. He looked at them with a knowing smile, "Regardless of where it leads, fellow Daoists, are you not curious to see?"</p><p>His words ignited a fervent gleam in everyone's eyes. Wu Chen cautiously replied, "With such a mystery before us, we naturally wish to explore. However, Daoist Yu was the first to discover this rainbow bridge, and we must have your consent.  Please, tell us your conditions, and we will follow your lead."</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.  This hidden rainbow bridge, wherever it led, must be extraordinary and likely untouched. Perhaps it held treasures even more valuable than those within the Treasure Pavilion.  Even a small share would be immensely rewarding.</p><p>As long as Yu Kong didn't intend to hoard everything for himself, any request would be acceptable.</p><p>Yu Kong chuckled. "Since I invited you all here, I wouldn't leave you out and keep everything for myself.  I know nothing of what lies beyond the bridge, whether treasures or dangers, perhaps even more perilous restrictions than in the Treasure Pavilion…  No one wishes to back out, do they?"</p><p>At this point, who could resist the temptation?  Besides, having witnessed the secret, what would be the consequences of withdrawing now?</p><p>No one backed down. Yu Kong nodded in satisfaction, glanced outside the hall, and urged, "We shouldn't linger. Let's go."</p><p>With Yan Wu leading the way, everyone lined up to step onto the rainbow bridge, Yu Kong bringing up the rear.</p><p>Qin Sang followed silently.  He didn't immediately crush the Twin Heart Pendant. Although he was almost certain the bridge was the hidden path, he decided against sending a message before fully understanding the situation on the other side.  Doing so might backfire.</p><p>The scene from the jade pendant hinted that obtaining the spirit herbs wouldn't be easy, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang couldn't decipher Yu Kong's intentions.  If he genuinely planned to collaborate in the treasure hunt, then peace was preferable.</p><p>However, if, as Sheng Yuanzi had suggested, Yu Kong merely sought scapegoats, Wandering Cloud and Ge Yuan were essential backups.  After all, having already killed Shao Chunhui, what did a few more lives matter to Yu Kong?</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang watched as those ahead vanished at the bridge's end.  His turn arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, on high alert. He stepped across the threshold of the bridge. Darkness enveloped him momentarily, and his foot landed not on empty space but solid ground.</p><p>They emerged in a cave. Dim light filtered through the entrance, shrouded in mist.  The cave itself held no immediate danger or restrictions.  Everyone relaxed slightly, turning to watch Yu Kong enter last.</p><p>Yu Kong waved his hand at the stone wall, and the rainbow bridge vanished.</p><p>"The treasures are ahead. What are we waiting for?"</p><p>With those words, Yu Kong led the way out of the cave.</p><p>Stepping out, Qin Sang saw with his own eyes the scene from his jade pendant. He was certain: this was the location of the medicinal garden!</p><p>However, the area was far more vast than he had imagined!</p><p>Beyond the cave stretched a vast plain, dotted with a few low hills, nothing remarkable.  Only the towering mountain in the distance, the same one from the jade pendant, commanded attention.</p><p>Mist cloaked the distant mountain, but the aroma of spirit herbs pierced through, captivating everyone.</p><p>"Those… are those the spirit herbs planted by the cave's owner?"  Wu Chen gasped, eyes burning with avarice.  The others shared his excitement.</p><p>However, some remained composed. Elder Wooden Vine said coldly, "Don't get ahead of yourselves. That mist shrouding the mountain isn't ordinary; it’s a formidable restriction. Whether we can obtain those spirit herbs remains to be seen."</p><p>His words were a cold splash of reality, sobering the group from their fervor.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly, looking at Elder Wooden Vine with a strange expression, "Daoist Wooden Vine is indeed a cunning old fox. No wonder Sheng Yuanzi trusted you to infiltrate my group."</p><p>Everyone gasped, quickly distancing themselves from Elder Wooden Vine.</p><p>His face paled, but he maintained his composure, arguing, "Since embarking on the path of cultivation, I've been alone. I don't know any Sheng Yuanzi. I have no idea what you're talking about…"</p>
