<h1>Chapter 2038: The Hao Bo Clan</h1><p>Qin Sang instructed the Xin family cultivators to clear the rear mountain, set up restrictions, and open up an empty space. He then retrieved a stone hall from his Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>Only then did he have time to examine the items brought out from the tomb.</p><p>The altar, the ancient hall, the stone carvings…</p><p>Anything that might contain information was stuffed into Qin Sang's Small Cave Heaven. After a thorough investigation, he indeed found something.</p><p>“Hao Bo Clan…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at a square stone in front of him.  The top of the stone was carved with a  lan grass totem, and all four sides bore inscriptions, stating the name of this Witch Clan and some miscellaneous information.</p><p>Most of it commemorated major events within the clan, using a chronological method. However, it used the Hao Bo Clan's own calendar, which couldn't be correlated with the Great Zhou calendar.</p><p>It was evident that the Hao Bo Clan existed in ancient times. Whether it still had a lineage today was unknown.</p><p>On the back of the square stone, Qin Sang saw some complex patterns, vastly different from ordinary ornamentation. He immediately thought of Witch Clan Divine Runes and carefully observed them, finding that they weren't complete Divine Runes. They were incomplete at both the top and bottom, and their meaning was unclear.</p><p>There should be more than one of these square stones. The Hao Bo Clan recorded important clan information on them.</p><p>Qin Sang continued searching and indeed found another square stone.  However, what was recorded on this stone wasn't Divine Runes, but rather the Hao Bo Clan's secret method for cultivating sacrificial insects.</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly surprised to obtain this method, but after a cursory glance, his joy diminished slightly.</p><p>Raising sacrificial insects required a long period of meticulous cultivation before seeing any results, even more complex than cultivating natal insect gu.  Furthermore, to cultivate a group of truly useful sacrificial insects, the entire clan had to be united and continuously perform blood-feeding rituals.</p><p>If Qin Sang wanted to cultivate sacrificial insects for the Storm Realm, he would first have to subdue all the factions, making them willingly offer their blood to feed the insects. Moreover, whether this method was suitable for humans remained to be seen.</p><p>However, if a group of mature sacrificial insects could indeed be cultivated, their effect would be immense. They could work in conjunction with the Thunder Altar, forming a double layer of protection.  Qin Sang regarded the Storm Realm as his own cultivation ground and was naturally quite tempted, but he still needed to carefully weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>While Qin Sang was examining the Hao Bo Clan artifacts, Su Nu instructed Luo Bo to take her to the cave dwelling of Venerable Pei.</p><p>Venerable Pei didn't have many disciples.  He had previously dispatched them elsewhere, believing they were monitoring several key locations of the Xin family. In reality, Young Master Xin had deliberately laid a false trail to lure them away.</p><p>These disciples were still diligently monitoring their assigned locations. The two disciples left behind in the cave dwelling had lower cultivation and were completely unprepared.</p><p>Steward Luo went forward and knocked on the door, deceiving them with a few words into opening the grand formation. He easily seized the cave dwelling.</p><p>Su Nu then tirelessly captured the rest of Venerable Pei’s disciples herself and focused on dealing with Azure Water Village.</p><p>Venerable Pei’s cave dwelling was located in Xianjin Mountain, on the western bank of Qiong Lake, just like Azure Water Village. Su Nu, stationed in Xianjin Mountain, ordered the Xin family experts to disperse and investigate.  News gradually trickled in.</p><p>Holding these intelligence reports, Su Nu looked at Steward Luo sitting below.</p><p>“Steward Luo, what are your thoughts?”</p><p>“Esteemed Senior Su Nu, this junior believes that Azure Water Village must already be aware of Zhong Liang’s death!”</p><p>Steward Luo stood up and released a ball of spiritual light, which transformed into a topographical map of the area around Qiong Lake. He then lit up several points of light.</p><p>These points of light represented the strongest factions near Qiong Lake.</p><p>Steward Luo continued, “This junior originally planned to lure out several core figures for Senior to control. Recently, we discovered that there’s no need for us to scheme. Several of Zhong Liang’s disciples have already left Azure Water Village. However, their movements were secretive, and we didn’t dare to act rashly before, so we failed to notice.”</p><p>He then tapped several points on the map.  “During this time, based on the clues we’ve discovered, Azure Water Village has been in frequent contact with several factions, including the Liyu Palace, with whom they have the closest ties.  Just now, Elder Da sent a message that Zhong Liang’s second disciple, Qi Ming, has personally gone to the Liyu Palace. Therefore, this junior speculates…”</p><p>Steward Luo bowed slightly. “Zhong Liang must have left behind the Blood Spirit Lamp. Perhaps Azure Water Village still harbors illusions, or perhaps there are internal disagreements, and they are reluctant to abandon Azure Water Village’s vast foundation. They ultimately reached a consensus to seek refuge under the protection of a nearby faction. After some contact, they finally chose the Liyu Palace…”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Second Elder Xin nodded in agreement. “The backer they choose must be stronger than Zhong Liang to have any hope of protecting Azure Water Village. The Liyu Palace is the ideal choice.”</p><p>“Liyu Palace? Is that the faction whose three Palace Masters are all Void Refinement powerhouses?” Su Nu asked.</p><p>Steward Luo nodded, a worried look flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“Of the Liyu Palace’s three Palace Masters, only the Third Palace Master recently broke through to Void Refinement. Senior and Elder Qin need to be wary of the First and Second Palace Masters.</p><p>The First Palace Master has long since broken through to mid-Void Refinement and is known as the strongest cultivator near Qiong Lake.</p><p>The Second Palace Master, like Venerable Pei, has been at the cusp of mid-Void Refinement for many years. However, it is rumored that this person cultivates a special technique and has deliberately remained at this stage to hone his cultivation.  He can break through whenever he wishes.</p><p>The rumors may be exaggerated, but they are enough to prove the Second Palace Master’s formidable strength. Moreover, this person once fought Zhong Liang to a draw!”</p><p>“Oh?”  Su Nu’s eyes flashed. “Did Zhong Liang have a feud with the Liyu Palace?”</p><p>“It was said to be a friendly spar. Even if there was a grudge, if Azure Water Village were to come under their wing, the Liyu Palace certainly wouldn't refuse them,” Steward Luo sighed.</p><p>Su Nu nodded slightly, stood up, and waved her hand, sending out a talisman message. She commanded, "Send a message to Xin Sheng. Gather the clan experts quickly. We will attack Azure Water Village today!"</p><p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p><p>Steward Luo and the others bowed in acknowledgment.</p><p>Su Nu's figure flickered and appeared outside the mountain. Then she transformed into a wisp of smoke, silently traversing the numerous mountains and rivers.</p><p>In the Qiong Zhe Mountains, a streak of light flew in. Qin Sang read the talisman message, waved his hand, put away his belongings, and vanished in a flash.</p><p>…</p><p>The area around Qiong Lake was filled with rivers and large streams.</p><p>At this moment, three figures were traveling downstream on a large river, heading towards the Liyu Palace on the eastern bank of Qiong Lake.</p><p>The three were on high alert, their auras hidden extremely well, without the slightest leakage. Ordinary cultivators couldn’t see through their concealment techniques. However, none of them noticed that on the south bank of the river, another person was traversing the mountains, remotely following them.</p><p>This person was Elder Da of the Xin family. He kept his eyes fixed on the three, and suddenly sensing something, his expression shifted slightly. He landed on a rock and saluted the sky, “Greetings, Esteemed Senior Su Nu!”</p><p>Su Nu appeared out of thin air and looked towards the river, “Are these the three?”</p><p>Elder Da pointed at a young man in the middle, “This is Zhong Liang’s second disciple, Qi Ming!”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Su Nu appeared above the river, over the heads of the three.</p><p>Qi Ming and the other two were completely unaware.  While they were flying, they suddenly felt something amiss and realized that both banks of the river had fallen into a strange silence. Even the chirping of birds couldn’t be heard.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Qi Ming stopped abruptly and only then heard the sound of a flute.</p><p>The flute sound was clear and crisp, yet Qi Ming was startled. He had no idea when the flute sound had begun or where it was coming from!</p><p>The two elders were now entranced, unknowingly captivated by the flute music.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Qi Ming was aghast.</p><p>Five-colored light flickered in his right sleeve, a treasure about to be unleashed. He suddenly felt a trance and a surge of warning signs in his heart.  He forcibly circulated his profound arts, and a halo suddenly appeared behind his head.</p><p>The halo immediately transformed into two blade lights, slashing towards his back.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Qi Ming heard the sound of the blade lights shattering. At the same time, someone gently patted his back, and he completely lost consciousness.</p><p>By the time Elder Da of the Xin family arrived, all three had become like walking corpses, their expressions vacant, floating side by side on the river surface.</p><p>Su Nu didn't kill them. She subdued them and asked a few questions.</p><p>Qi Ming answered everything she asked.</p><p>The more Elder Da heard, the more alarmed he became, and he couldn’t help but feel anxious. “They have already submitted to the Liyu Palace! What should we do now?”</p><p>From Qi Ming's mouth, he learned that ever since Zhong Liang's Blood Spirit Lamp shattered, his disciples had been restless, keeping a close eye on the Xin family while seeking a way out.  Ultimately unable to abandon Azure Water Village, they decided to seek refuge with the Liyu Palace.</p><p>Some time ago, they had reached a preliminary agreement with the Liyu Palace. Because the First Palace Master of the Liyu Palace was in secluded cultivation, and the Second and Third Palace Masters were both away, the final decision had to wait for the two Palace Masters to return.</p><p>The Second Palace Master of the Liyu Palace was due to return soon. Zhong Liang’s eldest disciple needed to stay behind to guard Azure Water Village, so Qi Ming was sent to visit as a show of sincerity.</p><p>It was too late to block the news. Even if they managed to seize Azure Water Village before the Liyu Palace noticed, they would still have to face the pressure from the Liyu Palace directly.</p><p>Su Nu and Qin Sang were both at the early stage of Void Refinement, while the Liyu Palace had three Void Refinement powerhouses, one of whom was the mysterious First Palace Master.</p><p>Elder Da of the Xin family was filled with worry, fearing that Su Nu and Qin Sang would act recklessly and offend the Liyu Palace, which would make the Xin family’s situation even more difficult.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? Have you forgotten Elder Qin’s identity? Would the Liyu Palace really make a mortal enemy of Elder Qin for the sake of Azure Water Village?”</p><p>Su Nu glanced at Elder Da and said indifferently.</p><p>She could naturally see that Qin Sang had another fortuitous encounter in the Feng Ju Jade Gate and his cultivation had greatly improved.</p><p>In a battle between Void Refinement cultivators, even if one was defeated, if they were determined to escape, it would be very difficult for the opponent to stop them. They were gambling on the fact that the Liyu Palace, with its vast foundation, wouldn’t dare to make enemies with them.</p><p>Su Nu didn’t think there was anything wrong with this approach.  Since the beginning of her cultivation journey, she had repeatedly risked her life to carve out a vast world for herself.</p><p>Moreover, for her and Qin Sang, even if they couldn’t defeat the Liyu Palace, their lives wouldn’t be in danger. Why not give it a try?</p><p>“Azure Water Village hasn’t fallen into the hands of the Liyu Palace yet. We still have a chance.”  Su Nu flicked her fingers, sending three streaks of black qi into the foreheads of Qi Ming and the other two.</p><p>The three men’s faces darkened and then returned to normal.</p><p>Then, with a wave of her jade hand, Su Nu concealed her figure and that of one of the Azure Water Village elders.</p><p>Qi Ming and the other elder regained consciousness and frowned, looking around. They felt that something was wrong but couldn’t find anything unusual.</p><p>After searching fruitlessly, the two continued on their way.</p><p>They not only forgot about being controlled earlier, but even forgot about the other elder who had been with them.</p><p>“Alright, these two should be able to delay the Liyu Palace for a while. Let’s go back immediately and take control of Azure Water Village as soon as possible.”</p><p>Clouds formed beneath Su Nu’s feet, carrying the two of them. At the same time, a faint black qi rose around her, and she transformed into a scholarly-looking man in elegant clothes.</p><p>It was the image of the Second Palace Master of the Liyu Palace from Qi Ming's memory.</p><p>Elder Da of the Xin family’s eyes widened.  He felt that Su Nu’s aura was indistinguishable from the Second Palace Master of the Liyu Palace. To achieve this based solely on the image in their memories was simply miraculous!</p><p>Azure Water Village was located on the western bank of Qiong Lake, the main village nestled between two peaks.</p><p>Green mountains and clear waters, a picturesque scene.</p><p>It was noon, and a light mist floated on the lake, enveloping Azure Water Village as if surrounded by immortal clouds. Within the mountain gates, Azure Water Village disciples flew back and forth, sparring and discussing the Dao, everything as usual.</p><p>Su Nu flew above Azure Water Village and immediately discerned that Azure Water Village appeared relaxed but was secretly on high alert. They had activated their protective formation in secret, making it difficult to attack by force.</p><p>In a distant mountain valley, Xin Sheng and Steward Luo had arrived with a dozen Xin family experts, while the others were still on their way.</p><p>“Act according to the circumstances!”</p><p>Su Nu gave an order and then flew towards Azure Water Village with the Azure Water Village elder, in a grand and open manner.</p><p>The oppressive aura of a Void Refinement cultivator immediately caused a commotion in Azure Water Village.</p><p>In the main village of Azure Water Village.</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out from a cloud pavilion and looked towards the sky.  Seeing the Second Palace Master of the Liyu Palace, they were all surprised and uncertain.</p><p>Leading them was a white-browed elder, Zhong Liang's eldest disciple and the current leader of Azure Water Village. Zhong Liang, because he was tracking Venerable Pei and the Xin family, and worried about being exposed, hadn't brought his disciples with him.</p><p>The Azure Water Village elder descended from the sky and shouted loudly outside the formation, “Palace Master Ling has arrived!  Leader, please quickly open the mountain gate to welcome him!”</p><p>“Junior Brother Wu, why are you the only one back? Where is Junior Brother Qi?” The leader of Azure Water Village transmitted his voice and asked.</p><p>“Reporting to Leader, we met Palace Master Ling halfway. After explaining the situation to him, Palace Master Ling gave Senior Brother Qi a talisman decree and ordered them to go to the Liyu Palace to establish a formal alliance.  Palace Master Ling came here first to take a look,” the elder replied.</p><p>The leader of Azure Water Village looked at Palace Master Ling. Seeing Palace Master Ling standing in the void with his hands behind his back, his expression haughty as he admired the scenery of Qiong Lake, seemingly disdainful to even glance at them, he couldn't help but feel a surge of sorrow in his heart.</p><p>Some of his junior brothers had proposed moving the entire village to avoid disaster. But with such a vast foundation, how could it be so easily relocated?</p><p>After some debate, they finally decided to secretly send away a few branches of their lineage, while the rest would surrender to the Liyu Palace, enduring humiliation and waiting for a future opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Xin family's story was repeating itself with them, and they didn’t even have a Ming Ling, making their situation even worse than the Xin family’s.</p><p>“Open the mountain gate quickly!”</p><p>Since the decision had been made to surrender, further thought was useless.  The leader of Azure Water Village waved his horsetail whisk and gave the order in a deep voice.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>All the peaks trembled, the mist churned and parted to the sides, revealing a path leading directly to the main village of Azure Water Village.</p><p>The leader of Azure Water Village, leading his disciples, bowed respectfully and shouted in unison, “Respectfully welcome Palace Master Ling!”</p><p>“Respectfully welcome Palace Master Ling!”</p><p>The shouts echoed through the mountains. Su Nu walked through the air and entered the Azure Water Village mountain gate, a slight smile playing on her lips.</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed from Qiong Zhe Mountain.  Midway, he received a flying talisman message from Su Nu, informing him of the details.</p><p>Su Nu had already arranged everything. Before she completely took control of Azure Water Village, Qin Sang needed to intercept anyone coming from the Liyu Palace.</p><p>“Three Void Refinement cultivators?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked eastward, feeling some pressure, but that was all.</p><p>If the First Palace Master of the Liyu Palace was a top expert at the late stage of Void Refinement, he might be somewhat apprehensive. But with the Thunder Escape technique, enhanced by the fusion of the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, he should be able to come and go freely, unless he was surrounded by all three.</p><p>His cultivation had soared recently, and he had some unanswered questions. He could take this opportunity to test them out.</p><p>Qin Sang passed over Azure Water Village and continued eastward, choosing a rock protruding from the lake’s surface, where he sat down cross-legged.</p>
