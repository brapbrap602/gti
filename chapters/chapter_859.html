<h1>Chapter 851: The Western You Alliance</h1><p>“My friends, did you escape from Demon Island? What happened there to cause such strange phenomena and the beast uprising?”</p><p>The three men hovered above the sea, their expressions varied as they watched Qin Sang and his companion depart from the direction of Demon Island, which was now in chaos behind them.  All three were skilled cultivators at the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The man in the middle appeared to be about fifty years old, with a handsome beard. Like Qin Sang, he wore a Daoist robe, exuding an ethereal aura—a late Core Formation stage master. The other two were also strong cultivators. This wasn't surprising; only cultivators of such strength would dare travel in the Demon Sea today.</p><p>The bearded man was the one who spoke.</p><p>Su Nu's cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. The bearded man's gaze quickly passed over her without much notice, finally settling on Qin Sang, whom he sized up carefully.  However, the man to his left, adorned in jewels and looking like a wealthy merchant, stared oddly at Su Nu, his eyes fixed upon her.</p><p>Uncomfortable under the merchant's gaze, Su Nu hid behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and said, “We were hiding on a small island nearby. The upheaval on Demon Island startled us, and we came to investigate. Unfortunately, we were caught in a beast swarm and had a narrow escape.  We withdrew immediately, avoiding alarming the powerful demons on the island.  As for what happened, I have no idea.”</p><p>“Is that so? Our cave is nearby, yet we haven't seen you two before.”</p><p>The bearded man looked towards Demon Island, somewhat believing Qin Sang's words. A mid-Core Formation cultivator, traveling with someone at the Foundation Establishment stage, seemed unlikely to cause trouble on Demon Island and escape unscathed. Demon Island was vast, home to powerful demons, whose leaders were formidable figures even he respected.</p><p>“May I ask your names?  Since you were hiding here, you must also be fleeing the chaos. My surname is Cang, and I'm a member of the Western You Alliance. We were a step too late when the chaos began and couldn't escape in time. Our human territories were then ravaged by the beast tide; no place was spared, and countless cultivators perished. Desperate, I, like you, thought the most dangerous place might be the safest and fled into Demon territory, finding a deserted island to hide.”</p><p>The bearded man paused, then continued, “Although we're temporarily safe, we live in constant fear. Since fate has brought us together, I would like to invite you to join forces. Strength in numbers; mutual support is our only hope to survive until this chaos subsides. This fellow cultivator, Liu, joined us on our escape…”</p><p>The bearded man gestured to the man on his right, revealing his affiliation. The three major trading alliances held significant influence and respect within the Demon Sea.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Liu also urged them to stay.</p><p>“The Western You Alliance?”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the young man from the Seven Kill Hall who died by his hand. He wondered if these three men had any connection to that young man.</p><p>He still needed to meet with Yue Xiangu, so he naturally declined the bearded man's invitation. Seeing that they didn't seem hostile, he felt relieved, bowed slightly, and politely refused, preparing to leave using his escape technique.</p><p>At that moment, the wealthy merchant suddenly flew forward and whispered something to the bearded man.</p><p>The bearded man's pupils constricted slightly as he stared at Su Nu.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and his companion about to leave, the wealthy merchant, growing anxious, called out, “Hold on, my friends. I have a question, if you don't mind. I sensed something strange about this young lady's aura; it seemed faintly similar to the legendary True Demon Qi of the ancient times. Did I see wrong?”</p><p>“So what if I do? So what if I don't?”</p><p>Su Nu, already irritated by the merchant's gaze, retorted angrily.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by Su Nu's sudden outburst; he was too late to stop her, and glared at her fiercely. Though he didn’t understand how these people discovered the True Demon Qi within Su Nu, this was clearly not the time for childishness. It was best to cover it up and avoid further trouble.</p><p>“My friend, you’re mistaken. True Demon Qi is a power only legendary ancient demons could wield. Even Nascent Soul masters of the demonic path cannot resist its corruption. She’s only at the Foundation Establishment stage; how could she possibly withstand it?  This girl is simply mischievous and ill-mannered; please don't take it to heart.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, speaking evenly as he made a move to leave.</p><p>“Don’t misunderstand,”</p><p>The bearded man remained calm, slowly flying forward to persuade them patiently, “My junior brother means no harm. His cultivation method is similar to the young lady's, and he simply hopes to exchange ideas with her. With your connection, and my junior brother’s cultivation level, he could easily guide her—she certainly won’t be at a disadvantage…”</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang finally understood their intentions, seized Su Nu's wrist, and activated a talismans.</p><p>Su Nu, aware of her mistake, hung her head in silence.</p><p>The two turned into escaping light, shooting towards the sky like meteors.</p><p>The man with the magnificent beard's eyes flashed coldly.  "Junior Brother, are you certain that girl possesses genuine demonic energy?"</p><p>The wealthy merchant nodded, confidently stating, "Senior Brother, you must have sensed it too.  It's undeniable! Even if she isn't a Nine-Revolution Yin Body, her ability to absorb demonic energy is unusual. The Alliance Leader has ordered a search for a Nine-Revolution Yin Body, but such a constitution is rarer than a Heaven-grade Spiritual Root.  If we capture this woman, regardless of whether she has a special physique or cultivates some ancient demonic art, if she proves useful to the Alliance Leader, and we gain his favor, will we still need to worry about the spiritual materials needed for our Nascent Soul stage breakthroughs?"</p><p>"Good! Let's pursue her!  Friend Liu, you've heard. If we capture these two, we'll put in a good word for you with the Alliance Leader…"</p><p>The bearded man and the wealthy merchant vanished, swiftly pursuing.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Liu hesitated for a moment, then followed suit.</p><p>On the Demon Island, the demonic beasts were in chaos.</p><p>Outside the island, several streaks of light chased each other across the sea.</p><p>Still some distance from their meeting point, Qin Sang, already greatly depleted from his long flight, thought he was safe, only to be pursued by powerful cultivators.</p><p>Though this trouble stemmed from Su Nu, the Maoshan Vine and the Teleportation Talisman were both with Yue Xiangu. To secure the treasures, he had to protect Su Nu, and absolutely ensure she didn't become entangled in the conflict.</p><p>Knowing he could no longer hide, Qin Sang summoned the two-headed beast from his Heart-Linked Ring.</p><p>The Demon Sea was fraught with peril; he couldn't let Su Nu travel alone.</p><p>He ordered the two-headed beast to take Su Nu ahead, while he held back.</p><p>Su Nu, deposited on the two-headed beast's back, was astonished. Only now did she realize the depth of this mysterious Daoist's hidden abilities, possessing such a powerful spirit beast.</p><p>"Protect her and meet up with Yue Xiangu…"</p><p>Qin Sang commanded the two-headed beast.</p><p>The two-headed beast roared, its back wreathed in green energy, tightly holding Su Nu as its wind-wings beat, speeding away.</p><p>Su Nu sat securely on the two-headed beast's back, but her gaze was vacant, devoid of any expression.</p>
