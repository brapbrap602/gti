<h1>Chapter 1803: The Nine Bright Seals</h1><p>Invite a Sword Cultivator to appraise it?</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, speechless.</p><p>The Sect Master of Dianjinshan didn't suspect anything, thinking Qin Sang was in a difficult situation.  In this realm, true Sword Cultivators were extremely rare, seldom seen by ordinary people.</p><p>"If Fellow Daoist finds it inconvenient, this humble Daoist happens to be acquainted with a Fellow Daoist deeply immersed in the Way of the Sword, whose swordsmanship is exceptional. I can recommend him on your behalf."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "No need."</p><p>Disappointment flickered across the Sect Master of Dianjinshan's face. He was also very curious about the sword's origins. If he could obtain the refining method for this sword, it would certainly benefit his own path of Artifact Refinement.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's will was firm, his aura obscured. The Sect Master of Dianjinshan didn't dare to press him, and could only reluctantly return the Chengying Sword to Qin Sang.</p><p>"My thanks for your trouble!"</p><p>Qin Sang paid the appraisal fee and rose to take his leave.</p><p>The Sect Master of Dianjinshan sighed softly.</p><p>...</p><p>Star Island's Immortal Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang flew slowly above the water's surface.  His trip to Nie Yuan and the Daoist sects had yielded a bountiful harvest, and it was time to cultivate in seclusion for a period to digest his gains.</p><p>Spotting the outline of Swordheart Island in the distance, Qin Sang flew over in a flash. The black-robed elder immediately came out to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang had interacted frequently with True Person Zhijian and was quite familiar with the black-robed elder. He knew that this person had once received a great favor from True Person Zhijian, and from then on, referred to himself as Sword Slave, forgetting his original name to demonstrate his loyalty.</p><p>Speaking with Sword Slave, Qin Sang learned that True Person Zhijian was in closed-door cultivation and instructed Sword Slave not to disturb him.</p><p>"Master has decreed that Swordheart Island should always maintain a cave dwelling for Fellow Daoist. This old slave will now lead you there," Sword Slave said respectfully.</p><p>"Very well," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The two quickly arrived at the center of Swordheart Island.</p><p>The central terrain of Swordheart Island was relatively high, the entire island resembling a bulging mound, with the most abundant spiritual energy concentrated at its center.</p><p>True Person Zhijian's cave dwelling was on the left side of the summit, while Qin Sang's was on the right.</p><p>Entering the cave dwelling, Qin Sang glanced around.  The interior furnishings were elegant and refined, precisely to his liking.  Clearly, Sword Slave had meticulously arranged everything. Very satisfied, he said, "Thank you for your efforts, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Sword Slave bowed and retreated, saying he didn't dare accept such praise.</p><p>Qin Sang walked into the meditation chamber, activated the restrictive formations, and retrieved the jade slips. Within them were recorded the insights of predecessors who had cultivated the High Divine Heaven Scripture.</p><p>Part of the collection came from the two courtyards of the Dao Court, and another part from the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly browsed through them, discovering that these insights might not all be suitable for him.</p><p>The predecessors who left these insights in the Dao Court and the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder certainly cultivated orthodox scriptures compatible with the High Divine Heaven Scripture.  However, he only treated the High Divine Heaven Scripture as a tool; his fundamental cultivation method remained the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>Blindly following established practices might be influenced by the Dao they cultivated, and even shake his own Dao.</p><p>Daoist methods encompassed all things.  One scripture might have multiple corresponding cultivation methods. For example, although the two courtyards of the Dao Court each had only one official scripture, the countless immortal officials of the Dao Court wouldn't all cultivate the same method.</p><p>Though not as prestigious as the two courtyards of the Dao Court, the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder were also among the major sects.</p><p>Different cultivation methods led to different Daos, and the discrepancies grew larger with higher realms.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the split of the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder might be related to a conflict over cultivation methods.</p><p>Different cultivation methods summoned different guardian divine generals.  The Dao comprehended from the scriptures would have subtle differences, and the constructed altar would also vary.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to find the common ground among these insights, remain uninfluenced, and adapt them for his own use.</p><p>In the following days, Qin Sang laid the jade slips on the ground before him.</p><p>He would sometimes pick one up and examine it for a long time, sometimes fall into deep thought, and sometimes summon his altar, drawing upon the power of the Thunder Turtle's demon core to attempt to cast the altar.</p><p>The altar gradually took shape.</p><p>The process of casting an altar wouldn't be accomplished overnight; it needed to be complemented by cultivation.</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang felt the time was ripe, so he stopped casting the altar, calmed his mind and spirit, and truly began to cultivate.</p><p>He had already cultivated the eleventh level of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" for some time in the Storm Realm.  Although he couldn't cultivate it in this realm, Qin Sang would still contemplate the method whenever he had free time.</p><p>Having slain Li Hou, he gained new insights into the method during the battle.  His cultivation in the coming period should be very smooth.</p><p>Pondering this in his heart, Qin Sang circulated his cultivation method.</p><p>Dense spiritual energy continuously converged towards where Qin Sang sat in meditation, and the cave dwelling once again fell into tranquility.</p><p>It was common for Nascent Soul cultivators to remain in seclusion for several years or even decades.</p><p>However, after just a stick of incense, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, awakening from his meditative state, his face revealing a look of pleasant surprise.</p><p>In just a short stick of incense worth of cultivation, his cultivation had made significant progress, even faster than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>This unexpected outcome caused Qin Sang to fall into contemplation. Gradually, he made a discovery.</p><p>The accumulation of Killing Dao comprehension from slaying Li Hou was one factor.  Another reason, very likely, was the lingering benefits of the Heavenly Tribulation of Ascension!</p><p>After overcoming the tribulation, Qin Sang had vaguely sensed a transformation within himself. It seemed as though the tribulation lightning carried the true meaning of the Heavenly Dao, supplementing his own Dao, perfecting the previous biases and deficiencies in his understanding of the Great Dao.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly had also benefited from this, breaking through on its own.</p><p>Now, as Qin Sang began to cultivate, the benefits of the Heavenly Tribulation truly manifested, his cultivation rapidly increasing in a short period.</p><p>After all, the connection between Heaven and Man was also the most crucial aspect of Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>He carefully pondered this, and it was indeed so, but he wasn't carried away by the pleasant surprise.</p><p>"How long can the remnants of the Heavenly Tribulation last?"</p><p>Qin Sang believed it couldn't continue indefinitely, otherwise, with this advantage, the Grand Thousands World would be dominated by ascended cultivators.</p><p>Perhaps because the Heavenly Dao of the Small Thousands Worlds was incomplete, ascended cultivators coming from the Small Thousands Worlds experienced this rapid advancement upon entering the Grand Thousands World. This effect should gradually weaken.</p><p>But undoubtedly, the perfection of one's own Dao would benefit every ascended cultivator for life.</p><p>With this discovery, Qin Sang became even more eager to cultivate.</p><p>Lost in cultivation, he was oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p>Two years had passed since Qin Sang returned to Swordheart Island.</p><p>During these two years, Qin Sang hadn't taken a single step outside.</p><p>Qin Sang had already made arrangements on Pot Island for the communication method agreed upon with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Neither Mo Xingdao nor Qingdan Yuanjun had sent any news, and True Person Zhijian hadn't disturbed him either.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped cultivating at some unknown point, his hands cupped before his chest, intently gazing at his empty palms.</p><p>A faint sword shadow lay on the ground.</p><p>After returning to Swordheart Island, Qin Sang would take out the Chengying Sword and examine it repeatedly whenever he wasn't cultivating.</p><p>He first tried to analyze it using Artifact Refinement secret techniques, but to no avail. Then, he tried to infuse his own Sword Intent into the Chengying Sword, yet it was like a stone sinking into the sea.</p><p>Finally, he tried both simultaneously. Two years had passed, and Qin Sang was still clueless.</p><p>Qin Sang considered himself at least half a Sword Cultivator, and he suspected the Sect Master of Dianjinshan had misjudged.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly withdrew his focus, a contemplative look on his face. He was trying out his ideas one by one. If he remained helpless in the end, he could only ask True Person Zhijian to appraise it.</p><p>Putting away the Chengying Sword, Qin Sang retrieved the gauntlet artifact embryo, tracing its spiritual veins, and quickly entered meditative cultivation once more.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed before the cave dwelling's restrictions were suddenly triggered from the outside.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his cultivation and, with a sweep of his divine sense, discovered it was Sword Slave outside. He transmitted his voice, "What is it?"</p><p>"Reporting to Fellow Daoist, Venerable Zhenru of Mirror Terrace Temple has come to visit. Master invites Fellow Daoist over for a discussion."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. Immersed in cultivation these years, he had actually forgotten about Venerable Zhenru.</p><p>This was also intentional on his part. If the other party sought the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal," he naturally had to play it cool.</p><p>"This humble Daoist understands. Please ask the two Fellow Daoists to wait a moment," Qin Sang replied, calming the True Essence within his body and rising to leave the cave dwelling.</p><p>His cave dwelling and True Person Zhijian's were separated by a patch of Swordheart Orchids.</p><p>Passing through the forest, he arrived at the main hall's entrance and heard the two conversing and laughing.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and True Person Zhijian also noticed Qin Sang and rose to greet him.</p><p>True Person Zhijian playfully remarked, "Brother Qingfeng has been on Swordheart Island for two years, and this humble Daoist hasn't even seen you once. This time, I owe it to Venerable Zhenru's blessing."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru joined his palms in a Buddhist salute. "This humble monk has come uninvited, disturbing Fellow Daoist Qingfeng's cultivation."</p><p>"Is Brother blaming this humble Daoist for lacking etiquette?" Qin Sang replied with a smile, then shook his head at Venerable Zhenru. "Isn't it a joy to have friends coming from afar? Why would Venerable Zhenru say such a thing?"</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang noticed something unusual in the expressions of True Person Zhijian and Venerable Zhenru.</p><p>True Person Zhijian was the first to detect the anomaly, constantly scrutinizing Qin Sang.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru quickly noticed it as well, a look of surprise on his face. "Fellow Daoist's cultivation… in just a few short years, Fellow Daoist's progress has been so rapid!"</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's cultivation had significantly improved compared to when he was treating the altar at Mount Jinju.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's conjecture also proved true; the benefits of the Heavenly Tribulation of Ascension were gradually weakening.</p><p>"This humble Daoist wasted many years before ascending. Such meager progress is hardly worth mentioning," Qin Sang shook his head, appearing indifferent.</p><p>The three sat down, sipping tea and discussing the Dao.</p><p>Before they knew it, they began talking about their experiences at Mount Jinju's altar treatment, discussing the movements of the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>No one knew what the Dao Court had obtained at Mount Jinju's altar treatment, but they had fallen silent afterward.</p><p>In these two years, there hadn't been any decrees related to Mount Jinju's altar treatment, nor any news of the Dao Court launching a large-scale invasion of Mount Jinju.</p><p>Instead, the Ghostfang Kingdom had begun to make significant moves.</p><p>"The two Fellow Daoists have been cultivating in seclusion at Star Island's Immortal Lake and may not have heard the news yet. The demon kingdoms in the east have suddenly started a trend of demon worship, with demons proclaiming themselves as demon gods and constructing licentious shrines and demon temples. If it were just one or two demon kingdoms, it wouldn't be a concern, but all the demon kingdoms are drastically changing their systems, surely orchestrated by the Ghostfang Kingdom. It's said that demons have even entered Nie Yuan, deceiving the ghost citizens into becoming believers…"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru spoke of what he had learned.</p><p>Mirror Terrace Temple was located southeast of Star Island's Immortal Lake, adjacent to the demon kingdoms, and was well-informed about their every move.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately recalled his experience when he first arrived at Mount Jinju.</p><p>Back then, the demons only dared to build temples on the periphery, and the Demon Marquis only dared to lurk in the shadows, as if testing the waters.</p><p>Now, they were openly worshipping demon gods.</p><p>"Could it be because of the battle at Mount Jinju's altar treatment?"</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. Could the treasure the Ghostfang Kingdom and the Dao Court were fighting over be related to the Divine Dao?</p><p>True Person Zhijian took a sip of spiritual tea, seemingly unconcerned, and smiled faintly. "Are these demons impatient to become territories under the Dao Court's rule?"</p><p>"This 'god' is not that 'God'!"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru shook his head. All territories were under the Dao Court's control.  The Ghostfang Kingdom, capable of rivalling the Dao Court, how could they be compared?</p><p>He worried, "I'm afraid the demons have glimpsed the secrets of the Divine Dao and are using it to rise."</p><p>When the nest is overturned, no eggs remain intact.</p><p>The cultivators and sects of Mount Jinju were able to remain safe and sound entirely because the Dao Court was resisting the Ghostfang Kingdom's aggression, preventing the demons from causing trouble.</p><p>If the Dao Court were to be defeated by the demons, Mount Jinju would be the first to fall. What would become of them?</p><p>"Whether demons or demon gods, the immortal officials of the Dao Court will worry about them. We are few and alone, and can only adapt to the general trend of the world. Why bother creating trouble for ourselves? As long as the demons don't practice blood sacrifice, and the ghost citizens have something to rely on, it's also a fortunate thing."</p><p>True Person Zhijian's expression turned serious. "Regarding these demon gods, has the Dao Court taken any action?"</p><p>"I haven't heard anything," Venerable Zhenru shook his head.</p><p>"Let's wait and see."</p><p>...</p><p>The three chatted about everything under the sun, and before they knew it, evening approached.</p><p>True Person Zhijian stood up and said, "Venerable Zhenru's visit must be for an important matter to discuss with Brother Qingfeng. This humble Daoist will not keep you any longer."</p><p>Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru also rose and bid farewell to True Person Zhijian.</p><p>In the forest, on the stone-paved path.</p><p>A monk and a Daoist, amidst swaying tree shadows and the murmuring stream.</p><p>"I have always kept Venerable Zhenru's invitation in mind. I've wasted too much time previously and, having obtained new methods, I was eager to consolidate my cultivation," Qin Sang explained.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, a year or two was nothing.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru couldn't even wait a few years. It seemed the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal" was very important to them.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru smiled. "If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain."</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered Qin Sang's cave dwelling and sat facing each other.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, waiting for Venerable Zhenru to state his purpose.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru put away his smile, his expression turning serious, and formally asked, "Dare I ask, where did Fellow Daoist learn the Buddha Seal you displayed?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned a frown and asked in return, "Does this Buddha Seal have some connection to your esteemed temple?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's reluctance to answer, Venerable Zhenru sighed softly. He knew he had been too eager and had revealed his intentions.</p><p>But this matter concerned a great secret within the temple, and he couldn't miss this opportunity.</p><p>Moreover, the other party was a Dongxuan True Person, worldly-wise and astute.  Trying to deceive him would be no easy feat.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru hesitated, pondering for a long time before saying, "Has Fellow Daoist ever heard of the Nine Bright Seals?"</p><p>The Nine Bright Seals!</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his heart stirred by a surge of emotions.</p><p>Not only did he know of the Nine Bright Seals, he had also learned half of one!</p><p>He had learned half of the Inner Lion Seal from Grand Master Huaiyin of the Great Compassion Zen Temple. Though only half a seal, it possessed immense power, capable of instantly restoring a severely injured body, a truly exceptional divine ability.</p><p>"What is the relationship between the 'Seven Masters Buddha Seal' and the Nine Bright Seals?"  Qin Sang had realized something, his heart filled with both shock and joy.</p><p>"Among the Nine Bright Seals, there is one called the Great Vajra Wheel Seal."</p><p>Since he had already spoken, Venerable Zhenru no longer kept him in suspense, explaining, "When this seal is perfected, one cultivates the Vajra Glazed Body, a body like pure glazed glass, impervious to divine weapons, possessing unparalleled might. Our temple treasures an image of an exalted monk performing this seal. This humble monk was fortunate enough to witness it…"</p><p>Pausing, Venerable Zhenru gazed at Qin Sang and said, "The several Buddha Seals Fellow Daoist displayed have some of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal's essence. This humble monk suspects that the creator of this seal, not only deeply versed in Buddhist principles and possessing great divine abilities, very likely drew inspiration from the Great Vajra Wheel Seal."</p><p>"Drew inspiration…?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru was unaware that what he saw was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>After comprehending all seven Buddha Seals, Qin Sang realized he was far from mastering the "Seven Masters Buddha Seal."</p><p>The seven Buddha Seals could be fused, and he was only just beginning.</p><p>The abilities of the seven seals were very balanced. What kind of divine ability would result from their fusion?  Would that be the ultimate form?</p><p>How much of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal's grandeur could it achieve?</p><p>Thinking about the cultivation process, a thought suddenly occurred to Qin Sang.</p><p>Could it be that there was no drawing of inspiration at all?</p><p>Rather, a being with great divine abilities had deconstructed one seal into seven, allowing later generations to cultivate step by step, making it easier to master!</p>
