<h1>Chapter 2064:  The Yuanjiao Fair</h1><p>“Thank you for your concern, Daoist friend,”</p><p>Silu rose and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“It’s my pleasure! It’s my pleasure! I haven’t even thanked you for saving my life yet…”</p><p>Ji Hong waved his hands repeatedly, then suddenly widened his bright eyes, finally noticing the change in Silu’s aura.  “Daoist friend, you’ve already broken through to the second level of the Void Realm?”</p><p>“I was fortunate enough to overcome this hurdle.  I was in seclusion to break through, and I didn’t know you were looking for me,” Silu deliberately obscured his experiences during that time.</p><p>Ji Hong was overjoyed, raising his small face with anticipation. “Daoist friend, now that you’ve come out of seclusion, are you going to gather your old forces and prepare for a counterattack?”</p><p>Silu gave a wry smile. “Including Xia Changshi and several elders, several seniors perished protecting me, and many of my former subordinates likely defected to the enemy. My forces are far less than before. How can I even think of a counterattack?”</p><p>He glanced at Qin Sang beside him. “I will absolutely not give up, but the time is not yet right. Those people must be searching for me everywhere. Staying in the Siyou territory will only tie my hands and feet.  Acting secretly and stealthily is not the right way. It's better to leave. I plan to leave here temporarily and find a place to settle down and build up my strength.”</p><p>“Good idea!”</p><p>Ji Hong strongly agreed. “Leaving here means the sky is high and the birds fly freely! The Siyou clan's influence doesn’t reach everywhere.  Where are you planning to go, Daoist friend? Maybe I’ve been there before and can guide you.”</p><p>“I’ve tentatively decided on the Zhuyan tribe…”</p><p>Silu briefly explained their plan.</p><p>“The Zhuyan,” Ji Hong wrinkled his little nose and snorted. “Those smelly monkeys are incredibly arrogant!”</p><p>“Daoist friend, have you been to the Zhuyan territory?” Silu pressed.</p><p>Ji Hong reluctantly nodded. His expression clearly showed that the experience was unpleasant. He grumbled, “Those uncivilized wild monkeys have no manners at all! I couldn't stand it after a few days and never went back! Daoist friend, you must think carefully!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Silu exchanged a glance. Ji Hong seemed quite resentful.</p><p>Silu said, “Whether the Zhuyan are barbaric or not is unimportant. I won't stay in the Zhuyan territory. I plan to find a vassal tribe to live among and avoid interacting with them as much as possible.  Daoist friend, do you know how many vassal tribes are under the Zhuyan?”</p><p>Ji Hong reached into a pocket on his body, grabbed something resembling a melon seed, a kind of seed, and cried out, “Wrong one!”</p><p>His robe had dozens of pockets. He rummaged through them for a while and pulled out a ball of purple light from one.</p><p>The purple light illuminated a book that appeared. The book was square and about half a person’s height, incredibly thick.</p><p>The book's surface shimmered with colorful light, showing that it was made of unusual material, seemingly some kind of animal skin. The cover bore several characters Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>Ji Hong held a corner of the book, lifting it like a weightlifter, making one wonder if the book would flatten him if it fell.</p><p>He pointed a finger, and the book tilted slightly, hovering in mid-air. He jumped up, about to open it, then suddenly turned to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Brother Qin is not an outsider,”</p><p>Silu said.</p><p>Ji Hong looked away, hesitating. “Daoist friend, you saved my life. Anything I personally possess, I can give to you, but this 'Book of Ten Thousand Tribes' I brought out from my clan. It records the abilities and secrets of various tribes, compiled by our clan’s ancestors who adventured across the lands. I cannot show it to outsiders without the clan leader's permission. Please don't peek.”</p><p>Silu quickly said, “Daoist friend, rest assured. We definitely won't peek.”</p><p>Ji Hong seemed to trust him implicitly and didn't ask them to leave. Purple light flashed from his body, and he slipped into the book’s pages.</p><p>The book’s surface glowed with purple light, but it didn't open.  The sound of pages rustling came from inside. Qin Sang and Silu sat aside, communicating through mental transmission; neither used any techniques to spy on the book.</p><p>After a moment, the rustling stopped, and Ji Hong's slightly muffled voice came from inside, “Zuo…Zu…Changyou…”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Silu called out. “Under the Zhuyan, is there truly a tribe called Changyou?”</p><p>The purple light flickered, and a small head poked out from the book's pages, somewhat puzzled.  “Yes! But the records say Changyou is a small tribe; they probably don't even qualify for the Yuanjiao Fair. Otherwise, why haven't I ever heard of them before?”</p><p>After Silu explained through mental transmission, Qin Sang understood that the Yuanjiao Fair was a gathering of the Yi people, regardless of whether they belonged to the Celestial or Aquatic divisions or neither. Any tribe with sufficient strength could receive an invitation.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Fair was not only a place where the Yi people discussed important matters but also an opportunity for various tribes to exchange information and verify their abilities. It held extraordinary significance in the eyes of the Yi people.</p><p>Finally learning about the Changyou tribe, Qin Sang felt a slight relief.  As they suspected, Changyou was a small tribe; the Storm Realm might be able to withstand this, and hopefully, the situation hadn’t changed.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang sent a few more words to Silu through mental transmission.</p><p>Silu said, "Smaller tribes are easier to control. Let's start with the Changyou tribe.  Does the book say anything else?"</p><p>Ji Hong shook his head. "The book only says that the Changyou people have four ears and are skilled at water magic."</p><p>He emerged from behind the book, wiped his small hand across the cover, and the book turned into purple light, disappearing into his pocket. He then jumped onto the table.</p><p>Finally having a clear objective, Qin Sang felt impatient and, without hesitation in front of Ji Hong, immediately began discussing their next steps with Silu.</p><p>Ji Hong sat on a teacup lid, swinging his legs, occasionally interjecting. He seemed to know the area around the Siyou tribe even better than Silu.  Later, Qin Sang and Silu were mostly asking him for advice.</p><p>Silu, aware of Qin Sang's intentions, bowed to Ji Hong. "Would you be willing to travel with us?"</p><p>Ji Hong looked at him strangely. "Of course I'll go with you! Neither of you have ever passed through the Mist Tide, but I have!"</p><p>He patted his chest confidently.</p><p>By now, he had realized that Qin Sang's identity was not simple; he was certainly not Silu's follower, but he didn't ask. He was here to repay Silu for saving his life; other matters were none of his concern.  Knowing that Qin Sang was an ally of Silu was enough.</p><p>"Thank you," said Silu, delighted.</p><p>Although Qin Sang and Su Nu hadn't made things difficult for him, as a member of a different race, he always felt out of place and vulnerable alone.  Having Ji Hong's company would alleviate his isolation.</p><p>After careful deliberation, they determined a clear route. At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly smelled a sweet fragrance.</p><p>Ji Hong took something from his pocket, put it to his mouth, and took a large bite, watching Qin Sang and Silu discuss their plans as he ate.</p><p>It appeared to be a fruit, rice-shaped but much larger than ordinary rice grains, white and jade-like. Ji Hong needed both hands to hold it.</p><p>Qin Sang inhaled sharply.  The sweet aroma filled his nostrils, but instead of being overpowering, it was incredibly pure and refreshing, spreading through his body, soothing his insides.</p><p>The bitten-off section glowed with a luminous sheen, like honey.</p><p>Ji Hong, noticing Qin Sang's gaze, stiffened, looking wary. He quickly moved to shield the fruit.  "No!"</p><p>He quickly devoured the rest, swallowing it in three or four bites.  His voice was muffled. "One is enough to fill me up. You're so big, you'd need... a whole bowl!"</p><p>He gestured with his arms, shaking his head like a drum. "No! No!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face stiffened slightly. He was only curious; he wouldn't steal food from someone's mouth.  Ji Hong's straightforward nature was a good thing, but he often did unexpected things.</p><p>However, Ji Hong wasn't intentionally being deceptive; his actions were entirely genuine, so Qin Sang didn't mind.</p><p>Silu chuckled. "Ji Hong, did you cultivate this fruit yourself?"</p><p>He turned to Qin Sang.  "The Jiaojiao tribe excels at cultivating superior seeds, capable of transforming the mundane into the extraordinary.  Seeds cultivated by the Jiaojiao, if consumed regularly, have effects rivaling some spiritual medicines. They significantly aid cultivation, can even improve one's aptitude, and are extremely valuable. This spiritual rice, called Jiashi, is one such example. Ji Hong is fearless, travels everywhere, venturing into unexplored places, all to collect the best seeds in the world..."</p><p>"Cultivating superior seeds?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened. He hadn't expected Ji Hong to have such skills. His thoughts raced, but his expression remained unchanged. He bowed slightly. "Not only do you possess great powers, but also great perseverance and courage. I admire you."</p><p>Ji Hong looked pleased, his eyes softening towards Qin Sang. He said reluctantly, "We're not yet close friends, but when we are, I'll give you a Jiashi. I never lie; ask Silu if you don't believe me."</p><p>Silu smiled. "I've had the pleasure of tasting it once; Jiashi truly lives up to its name."</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him, not being in a rush.  He would have plenty of opportunities once he brought this person back to the Storm Realm.</p><p>Such honest people were the easiest to deal with, but they often possessed keen insight and perception.  One had to treat them sincerely to receive their sincerity in return.</p><p>Having settled their arrangements, the three decided not to delay and left the city immediately.</p><p>They met Su Nu and the others outside the city. Seeing Ji Hong perched on Silu's shoulder and hearing Silu's introduction, everyone was quite surprised.</p><p>...</p><p>Above a stretch of ocean, a magical vessel descended gently, revealing Qin Sang and the others.  They gazed ahead.</p><p>A vast expanse of white fog stretched before them, a wall of mist stretching endlessly to the left and right, its top unseen. The mist swirled constantly, thinning towards the edges, creating an indistinct boundary.</p><p>After a long journey through several territories of the Siyou tribe, they finally arrived at the Mist Tide.</p><p>They had been extremely cautious along the way, ensuring their safety before using teleportation formations; otherwise, they preferred to fly themselves to their destination.</p><p>"The mist seems thinner here," Su Nu observed.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the end of the mist wall, "The place guarded by the Si You clan experts is still ahead."</p><p>The mist in the Mist Sea is ever-changing; some areas are thick, others thin, but thin doesn't mean safe.</p><p>The group rested briefly, concealing their auras, and quietly approached their target.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang sent a message to halt everyone, urging them to sense their surroundings.  A wave of energy from an array emanated from ahead.</p><p>It was clearly an array set up by the Si You clan.  Vague energy fluctuations came from within; they couldn't determine how many experts were inside, but Qin Sang was certain there were threats to his life.</p><p>With guards present, they couldn't enter directly. Qin Sang looked around, gesturing for everyone to retreat. They found a deserted island to leave Gu Ya and the others, then the three of them, at the Nascent Soul stage, separately explored the outer edges of the Mist Sea.  They quickly found a solution.</p><p>They chose a different route to enter the Mist Sea, gradually approaching the intended path.</p><p>Entering the Mist Sea, the familiar feeling returned, even stronger than during the Mist Year. Getting lost here meant never escaping. Moreover, the danger of mist waterfalls and mist beasts was amplified many times, and many usual rules didn't apply here.</p><p>A seemingly calm mist could suddenly unleash a waterfall, and a slight delay in reaction would lead to being swept away, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>And that wasn't the only danger. The group remained vigilant, not daring to relax.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way with Ji Hong, Si Lu and Su Nu bringing up the rear.  The group silently moved through the white mist.</p><p>Qin Sang awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly, proceeding cautiously, successfully guiding everyone back on course.</p><p>Perhaps they were lucky; they encountered almost no danger.</p><p>After traveling for more than ten days, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something and signaled everyone to stop. His gaze sharpened as he stared ahead.</p><p>"Did you find something, friend?"</p><p>Ji Hong stood on his shoulder, eyes wide, but saw nothing.</p><p>"Ahead…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, "There's a palace!"</p><p>"A palace?"</p><p>Ji Hong was startled, then quickly realized, exclaiming joyfully, "It's a mirage! It must be a mirage!"</p><p>Mirages are a phenomenon in the Mist Sea, appearing unpredictably, most frequently during the Mist Year.</p><p>"Is anyone else there? I've never seen a mirage like this here; let's go take a look!"</p><p>Ji Hong urged repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang led the group forward, gradually seeing the palace shadow, resembling a celestial palace in the clouds, majestic mountains shrouded in mist, palaces scattered, mysterious and unusual.</p><p>The scene within the thick fog was unclear; the celestial palace seemed endless.</p><p>The palace gates were closed, with no living creatures or mist beasts, giving off a deathly aura.</p><p>Yet, the moment they saw it, everyone was awestruck by the palace's grandeur, unsure if it was real or illusion. Qin Sang was secretly surprised. Mirages are illusions, yet even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn't see through it, as if the celestial palace was real.</p><p>"Qin Daoyou, should we go investigate?"</p><p>Ji Hong was captivated, looking expectantly at Qin Sang. "Legend says some mirages are illusions; those inside experience wondrous things, emerging as if from a dream. But others blur the line between reality and illusion, and treasures obtained inside remain after the mirage disappears…"</p><p>Having experienced the Ju Shan Zhi Zhi Altar and Feng Ju Yu Gate, Qin Sang knew that to those powerful cultivators, the line between reality and illusion might be blurred. He didn't expect the Mist Sea to have such wondrous phenomena.</p><p>"Not advisable!"</p><p>Si Lu's expression was serious. "There are stories of people gaining fortuitous encounters from mirages, but many more enter and never return, disappearing with the mirage. If a mirage appeared outside the Mist Sea, we might investigate, but it's best not to enter now."</p><p>As they spoke, the palace shadow gradually faded, disappearing before their eyes in an instant.</p>
