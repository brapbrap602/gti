<h1>Chapter 207: The Five Elements Alliance</h1><p>“Demons from beyond the realms…”</p><p>Based on what Qin Sang had seen and heard, cultivators of the Great Thousand World wouldn't refer to the Small Thousand World as 'beyond the realms.'</p><p>The common understanding in the Great Thousand World was that Small Thousand Worlds originated from and were a part of the Great Thousand World.  Like saplings growing under the shade of a great tree, sprung from its roots, they were essentially one and the same.</p><p>There was even a theory that the Great Thousand World would eventually meet its demise, and the Small Thousand Worlds were the continuation of its life force. Eventually, one or more Small Thousand Worlds would mature as the Great Thousand World declined, bringing new life to the ruins and offering a path for all beings, marking the beginning of a new cycle.</p><p>For demons to be considered from beyond the realms, there was only one possibility: they came from another Great Thousand World!</p><p>“Did Senior Sister and Bai Zhen ascend to another Great Thousand World?”</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>If it were a normal Great Thousand World that interacted with this realm, there might be a chance to meet again in the future. However, the demons from beyond the realms were considered invaders, sworn enemies of this realm. The boundary wall had been sealed by the Jade Emperor, making it an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>Meeting again would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens!</p><p>The Wu Clan was beyond the Fengju Jade Gate, at least there was news of Liu Ying and the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Without the interference of the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Sound, Liu Li had hope of reaching Deity Transformation and ascending, with the possibility of meeting in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Senior Sister and Bai Zhen, who ascended first, were the ones he had the least chance of seeing again.</p><p>“Why isn’t the Dao Court or the Purple Star Palace mentioned here? Could they have risen during later upheavals?”</p><p>Since Celestial Master Tian Yue was willing to share so many secrets with the Sword Slave and entrust him to wait here, Qin Sang felt no need to hold back. He directly voiced his questions.</p><p>Upon asking this, Qin Sang noticed the Sword Slave's surprised expression and strange gaze.</p><p>The Sword Slave coughed lightly and said, “Old slave… I had some questions I wished to ask the True Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood. The Sword Slave likely assumed he had a close relationship with the Purple Star Palace, perhaps even a descendant of some great power, which was why Celestial Master Tian Yue valued him so much.</p><p>Little did he know, while Qin Sang did receive an inheritance, he was a clueless inheritor.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you followed Celestial Master Tian Yue for many years, and even he didn’t tell you those secrets. I know little more than you do. Furthermore, let alone the past, even with my current cultivation, what am I in the Great Thousand World? What good would knowing do?” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>These words reflected his true feelings.</p><p>A Void Refinement cultivator could be a hegemon in one region, but in the vast Great Thousand World, they were just a slightly larger chess piece. Thinking of the immense karmic implications he was entangled in, Qin Sang couldn’t help but feel powerless.</p><p>The Sword Slave empathized and shared the information he had gathered.</p><p>“Whether it was intentionally erased or for other reasons, there are few records of the Dao Court and the Sword Pavilion in public texts.  I only found scattered fragments in those records.</p><p>“After the Jade Emperor created heaven and earth, humanity flourished, and various Daos arose, with the Dao Sect being the most prominent. The Alchemy Sect, needless to say, had a profound influence. The Talisman Sect is widely recognized as the origin of humanity’s Divine Dao. Some trace the Great Vehicle and Lesser Vehicle conflict back to that era, believing the Great Vehicle Dao also originated there.</p><p>“However, the records mention only the Talisman Sect, not the Dao Court.</p><p>“Later, during the Great Zhou Dynasty, sword cultivators flourished once more. Every transformation, every rise of a powerful figure, was accompanied by great chaos and calamity! The Age of Great Strife inevitably involved the various races of the Great Thousand World and the demons from beyond the realms.</p><p>“At that time, sword rainbows covered the sky. Thousands of sword cultivators rode the巽 wind, ascended the clouds, crossed mountains and seas, and soared through the nine heavens. Before the boundary wall, they established the Sword Pavilion, guarded the Realm Pass, and slew the outer demons. There were even rumors that tides of sword light surged into the demon realm, unstoppable, slaughtering all in their path, terrifying the myriad demons!</p><p>“But there are also rumors that the sword cultivators acted arbitrarily, lacking patience, and actively shattered the seals on the boundary wall, allowing them to invade the demon realm. Ultimately, their swords were blunted, bringing a great tribulation upon the Great Thousand World.  There are even rumors of sword cultivators colluding with outer demons, sowing chaos in the Great Thousand World…</p><p>“These truths and falsehoods are intertwined, obscuring the truth and completely burying it.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang immediately sensed something amiss, his expression growing serious.</p><p>According to the Dao he comprehended from the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign cultivated the Great Vehicle Dao of Slaughter. Guarding the boundary wall, slaying outer demons, and protecting the Great Thousand World were indeed his actions.</p><p>But why would a guardian of the Great Thousand World end up with the Sword Pavilion in ruins, his inheritance broken, and his name vilified?</p><p>The First Sword Attendant even spoke of being enemies with the world.</p><p>Even if he were to be the enemy of the world, it should have been the outer demons who were his enemies!</p><p>Qin Sang considered various possibilities, countless conspiracies flashing through his mind.</p><p>Could it be that while leading the Purple Star Palace in battle at the boundary wall, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign neglected his rear and was betrayed by those with ulterior motives? While the Purple Star Palace and the demons battled, their strength greatly diminished, and the villains seized the opportunity, stealing his achievements and smearing his name.</p><p>Or perhaps the sword cultivators' brilliance was too dazzling, making them a thorn in the side of others, leading to their suppression.</p><p>Humanity was never a monolithic entity, not to mention other races like the Wu and Yao.</p><p>Suddenly, a spark of inspiration flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, and he thought of another possibility, his mind tensing slightly.</p><p>Everything could be false, only the Dao was truly immutable. But what if the Dao he comprehended from the *Purple Star Sword Canon* was 'false'?</p><p>After all, he only obtained the first twelve levels of the cultivation technique; the later Body Integration and Grand Completion parts were missing.</p><p>What if the Great Vehicle Dao of Slaughter was only the Dao of the twelfth level, and after breaking through to Body Integration and Grand Completion, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign abandoned the Great Vehicle Dao of Slaughter and changed his path?</p><p>It wasn’t impossible. Throughout the first twelve levels of the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, the Purple Star Sword Sovereign's Dao was never constant, always evolving and progressing.</p><p>If he abandoned the protective heart of the Great Vehicle Dao of Slaughter and invaded the demon realm, perhaps it was truly just for the thrill of slaughter.</p><p>Countless thoughts tangled in Qin Sang’s mind, the more he thought, the more confused he became.</p><p>Based on limited information, his deductions would likely differ greatly from the truth. Qin Sang merely speculated on a few possibilities; none could be trusted without concrete evidence.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more eager to obtain the Slaughter Sword fragments and the subsequent cultivation techniques to see what the Purple Star Sword Sovereign’s Dao truly was.</p><p>Perhaps it was the very Dao he sought, so he wouldn’t need to change his fundamental cultivation technique.</p><p>As for switching sects, Qin Sang hadn’t considered it for now. The karmic connection between him and the Purple Star Palace wasn't something he could easily sever. At least for the time being, he was the greatest beneficiary of this karmic connection.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, the Sword Slave sat quietly, not disturbing him.</p><p>“Did Celestial Master Tian Yue mention where I should wait for him after retrieving the spirit sword?” Qin Sang wanted to know what arrangements the First Sword Attendant and Celestial Master Tian Yue had for him.</p><p>If he could be under their protection, find a blessed land, and cultivate peacefully for thousands or even tens of thousands of years, he wouldn’t mind.</p><p>“Master told the True Master to act as he sees fit,” the Sword Slave shook his head, indicating no specific instructions.</p><p>Celestial Master Tian Yue couldn’t meet with me? He must know the dangers that lie ahead, Qin Sang sighed inwardly. "Is there a way to contact Celestial Master Tian Yue, to meet first? Perhaps there's a better way…"</p><p>"Master said, 'A sharp blade is forged through grinding.' This is his Dao!" the Sword Slave said solemnly.</p><p>There was no room for maneuver.</p><p>Qin Sang admired his resolve but leaned back slightly, forced to carefully consider his retreat.</p><p>If retrieving the sword went smoothly, it would be fine. But if his identity were exposed, he would have no place in the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, or even any human territory.</p><p>He had just learned from the Sword Slave that the ancient battlefield where the Fengju Jade Gate was located was vast. While it lay between human and Wu territories, entering from the human side was far less dangerous than from the Wu side.  The Wu Clan found it more difficult to enter their own sacred mountain. Moreover, the Purple Star Palace leaned more towards the human side, considered within human territory. Therefore, at the Fengju Jade Gate, they only needed to consider human adversaries.</p><p>Fleeing to the Wu Clan, where he could see Liu Ying and the Ghost Mother, was an option, but bypassing the Fengju Jade Gate was a problem, and it might not be safe. A great inheritance like the Purple Star Palace would certainly interest the Wu Clan.</p><p>If he continued north, he would enter the boundless wilderness. After the Yao Court's collapse, the Yao Clan was driven into the wilderness. After countless years of evolution, it was unknown what it had become.</p><p>Qin Sang knew nothing about the situation in the wilderness, only that humanity could still only hold onto the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, while the Buddhist Sect had made inroads beyond them.</p><p>Furthermore, the humans of the Eight Great Celestial Provinces weren't all of humanity in the Great Thousand World. There were countless places like Moon渎 Bay, whose inhabitants weren’t citizens of the Great Zhou.</p><p>Between the various races, there were boundless chaotic zones, where different races mingled, and dangers lurked, even more perilous than the South Sea. To reach the wilderness, he would have to traverse these places first.</p><p>After much deliberation, he realized his options were limited. He could only be extremely cautious when retrieving the sword.</p><p>Qin Sang could only take things one step at a time.  He asked, "When shall we depart?"</p><p>The Sword Slave would accompany him to Dui Province, and they would separate there.</p><p>The Sword Slave would then inform Celestial Master Tian Yue according to their agreed-upon method, while Qin Sang would conceal his identity and proceed alone to the Fengju Jade Gate, awaiting the opportune moment.</p><p>Since a special method was used for communication, the Sword Slave wouldn't see Celestial Master Tian Yue either, dashing Qin Sang's hopes of meeting him.</p><p>"Before departing, old slave must request leave from the Zhou Royal Palace and make arrangements.  It will take at least a month," the Sword Slave said.</p><p>The Golden Guards of the Zhou King protected the Royal Palace.</p><p>Just as cicadas sense the wind before it blows, they would quickly detect any changes in the situation.  It was best not to abandon this identity unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Alright! I'll also take the opportunity to admire this so-called sacred land of the Great Thousand World's human race," Qin Sang nodded. "Fellow Daoist, do you know of any major factions renowned for refining tools in the Great Zhou? I consider myself somewhat skilled in the art of refining. If I could gain recognition from a certain faction and secure a guest elder position, it could serve as a disguise during my journey west. Those sects with established lineages are likely to be very strict and difficult to approach. A merchant guild or alliance would be ideal."</p><p>Qin Sang also had his own considerations for doing this.</p><p>He thought he was relatively wealthy among cultivators of the same rank, but he realized the journey was arduous.</p><p>After a few more trips to and from the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, his reserves would be depleted. In the future, he would have to rely on his own skills to ‘earn a living.’</p><p>He remembered the days in the Talisman World, when he could hunt down fierce creatures whenever he was short on resources, and even comprehend the Dao of Slaughter.  How carefree those days were.</p><p>"There are some factions renowned for refining tools. The most famous is the Heaven Reaching Pavilion.  It's rumored that the upper echelons of the Heaven Reaching Pavilion are tool spirits that achieved enlightenment, innate and acquired spirit treasures that have, for various reasons, escaped their masters' control, and they consider themselves the Spirit Race. But they are few in number.  When people speak of different races, the Spirit Race is rarely mentioned. In my years in White Jade Capital, I have never heard of any Spirit Race member from the Heaven Reaching Pavilion appearing. They are incredibly mysterious," the Sword Slave pondered.</p><p>"Oh? Spirit treasures forming their own race?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. These Spirit Race members were considered Xiao Wu’s kin, but Qin Sang wouldn’t dare let Xiao Wu contact them.</p><p>Tool spirits forming their own race indicated their independent nature and unwillingness to be subservient to others. It would be disastrous if they were to lure Xiao Wu away.</p><p>"Those who are not of our kind are not of our mind. The Heaven Reaching Pavilion might not be easy to enter," Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Once he joined a major faction, unless necessary, he intended to stay for a long time.  He hoped to maneuver within the faction, not necessarily to climb to a high position, but to leverage its resources for his own benefit.</p><p>The Zhou King's reign, whether in name only or not, showed that powerful human figures favored the existence of rules.</p><p>Since he was within the rules, he must act accordingly.</p><p>"Aside from the Heaven Reaching Pavilion and those sects, the most renowned is the Five Elements Alliance," the Sword Slave said.  "It’s said to be an alliance formed by like-minded refiners. Because all things in the world belong to the five elements, and the Dao of Refining is derived from all things, it’s named the Five Elements Alliance.  It has gradually grown, now spanning the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, absorbing countless refiners.  They don't value background, and even rogue cultivators can join. There are also some rather peculiar ones..."</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance, Five Elements Crown, it seemed to fit.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  No need to choose, it would be the Five Elements Alliance!</p><p>However, he was also curious about the peculiar ones the Sword Slave mentioned.</p><p>Upon hearing the explanation, he couldn’t help but be intrigued.</p><p>Rumor had it that some factions could help fuse one’s soul with a spirit treasure, abandoning the human body and taking refuge within the spirit treasure, to transcend the tribulation and become a true tool spirit, existing as a tool spirit and cultivating the Dao of Tool Spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was possible; Xiao Wu’s birth process was somewhat similar.</p><p>However, their claim of helping those on the brink of death regain new life was questionable. Due to the exorbitant price, no one would easily attempt it.</p><p>Their conversation broadened Qin Sang’s horizons considerably.</p><p>After discussing for a while longer and finalizing their plan, the Sword Slave left the courtyard formation's jade talisman with Qin Sang and returned to the Zhou Royal Palace.</p><p>Seeing the Sword Slave off, Qin Sang sat quietly in the courtyard, analyzing the information he had gathered recently.</p><p>His peaceful cultivation days were finally coming to an end.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, rose, and left the courtyard, walking through the streets of White Jade Capital at a leisurely pace towards the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Unlike the mysterious Heaven Reaching Pavilion, the Five Elements Alliance's headquarters was located in White Jade Capital, on the Thirtieth Heaven.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn’t plan to go directly to the headquarters.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance conducted business publicly, like mortal guilds.  To appear accessible, they established a branch every five heavens for the convenience of cultivators.</p><p>The Great Zhou had no explicit regulations regarding the Thirty-Three Heavens, but over the years, some generally accepted rules had formed spontaneously.</p><p>For example, the Zhou Royal Palace occupied the Thirty-Third Heaven exclusively, and low-rank cultivators generally wouldn’t venture alone into the higher levels.</p><p>After considering this, Qin Sang decided to visit the branch on the Twentieth Heaven.</p>
