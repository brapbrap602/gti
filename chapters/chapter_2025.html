<h1>Chapter 2016:  Wicked Winds and Elusive Thunder</h1><p>Traveling through the chaotic spacetime, Gu Ya gradually became desensitized to the fantastical and magnificent sights.  After passing through another fragment of a small world, she noticed Qin Sang suddenly stop, gazing ahead with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>At the edge of the void, colorful lights shimmered.  In some areas, the colors were distinct; in others, they blended together.  Each light held a different scene, each beyond human comprehension, unlike anything naturally formed.</p><p>Some lights appeared calm and peaceful on the surface, seemingly harmless, yet emitted a subtle aura that made Gu Ya's heart pound.  If she had come alone, she would have certainly avoided them.</p><p>These familiar sights reminded Qin Sang of the Gushan altar. The scene before them was similar to the Gushan altar – the remnants of ancient power struggles, seemingly eternal, evolving over countless years into real illusions.</p><p>She recalled that period as the fastest stage of her cultivation.  Hidden within the altar, undisturbed, she could focus solely on her cultivation.</p><p>Fengju Gate should be far larger than Gushan, unlike the Gushan altar which felt “crowded.”  Gaps of dark void separated some of the lights.  The illusionary remnants of divine powers were largely stable; with caution, even Yuan Ying cultivators could pass through safely.</p><p>Furthermore, fragments of shattered small worlds divided the illusions into distinct zones, each with varying levels of danger.  Of course, Qin Sang was still on the outer edge of Fengju Gate; the interior might hold further unknowns.</p><p>At a glance, there seemed to be nothing of value here; it must have been thoroughly scavenged countless times.</p><p>*Thump! Thump! Thump!*</p><p>A heartbeat-like rhythm emanated from Qin Sang's palm.  Upon entering Fengju Gate, her family heirloom seal reacted strongly.  Now, a radiant glow pulsed in her palm, the seal beating forcefully, providing clear guidance.</p><p>It's easy to lose direction within Fengju Gate; many cultivators have gotten lost here. Qin Sang glanced to what appeared to be the northwest; judging by the seal's reaction, their destination shouldn't be far.</p><p>Increasing her speed, Qin Sang moved like lightning through the illusions, sometimes narrowly brushing past them, causing only slight ripples.  This was a stark contrast to her careful approach within the Gushan altar, leaving Gu Ya terrified.</p><p>Days and nights blurred.  After traveling an unknown distance, Gu Ya suddenly remembered something and whispered, "Senior, be careful.  I heard Fengju Gate has a natural disaster, called Wicked Winds and Elusive Thunder."</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgement.  "This location isn't too deep; the Wicked Winds and Elusive Thunder rarely reach here."</p><p>Wicked Winds and Elusive Thunder, similar to a fog waterfall in a sea of mist, are unique catastrophes of Fengju Gate.  Their ominous name suggests their extreme danger.</p><p>Various theories exist regarding their origin.  Some say they're residual ripples from conflicts between the divine powers of ancient battlefield combatants; others attribute them to the instability of space caused by the destruction of countless small worlds; still others believe Fengju Gate is an ancient sacred mountain of the Wu tribe, with remnants of their powerful formations lingering.</p><p>These theories remain unproven.  What is certain is that each appearance of Wicked Winds and Elusive Thunder claims countless lives, burying countless ambitious cultivators who dared to seek a shortcut to ascension.</p><p>Originating deep within Fengju Gate, the intensity of the catastrophe gradually diminishes outward.  However, each occurrence shakes the already-stable illusions and small world fragments, creating unpredictable dangers.</p><p>While there are signs preceding the catastrophe, the warning time is extremely short, leaving little room for reaction.  Cultivators can only try to avoid the danger; the best approach is to assess one's own strength and avoid tempting, risky areas.</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang slowed down, her gaze sweeping across the area before she entered an illusion.</p><p>The illusion was filled with blinding white light, devoid of anything else.  The moment she entered, Qin Sang keenly sensed that the white light subtly affected her spiritual perception.</p><p>After traversing the white light, Qin Sang reached the other end of the illusion.  Two more illusions appeared ahead, all three adjacent with only a narrow gap between them.</p><p>At that instant, the family heirloom seal vibrated intensely, almost about to fly from her hand, its focus on the void within the gap.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered in surprise.  Such a narrow space… it hid the entrance to a small world.</p><p>Qin Sang activated an ancestral blood seal, a beam of blood light dispelling the darkness, leaving a tiny point of light.  Qin Sang's figure flickered, passing through the light point, and immediately entered another space.</p><p>This small world was the smallest Qin Sang had ever seen, seemingly underdeveloped, less than a thousand kilometers across, with rolling mountains everywhere.</p><p>The space here was more stable than the fragments of the outside world. Qin Sang wasn't sure if this was also a fragment or a newly born small world.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted Gu Ya's protective aura. Gu Ya instinctively sniffed the air, detecting a faint fragrance.</p><p>Following the scent, the sound of gurgling water came from ahead.  The two soon saw a large valley with a clear pool at its center, from which a continuous stream of spring water flowed, the source of the fragrance.</p><p>A stele stood before the valley, inscribed with the words "Chen Family Secret Manor."</p><p>Around the clear pool, restrictive glows flickered everywhere, each containing one or several spirit herbs.</p><p>Gu Ya was stunned.  She recognized many of the herbs, all of significant value, while others were unfamiliar but clearly extraordinary.</p><p>"What kind of spring water is this? It seems to nurture the spirit herbs…"</p><p>Qin Sang also saw that the area around the pool was a superior herb garden, not inferior to the Azure Sky Cave.  Several spirit herbs, mature and tempting even to a Nascent Soul cultivator, were growing there.</p><p>"Deer Blood Orchid, Green Pearl Bamboo…"</p><p>Qin Sang examined them one by one, inwardly regretting his neglected alchemy skills. He lacked the ability and the necessary formulas to refine elixirs.</p><p>However, trading them would certainly yield many valuable materials; a fortunate surprise.</p><p>The old Chen demon apparently only used the place as a herb garden, leaving no other treasures.  Qin Sang swiftly gathered the top-grade spirit herbs, leaving the rest for Gu Ya, then said, "It's safe here. Rest and recover here; I'll take you to Kan Prefecture after I finish here."</p><p>Kan Prefecture was one of the eight great prefectures, located in the east.  Kan represents the water hexagram. Kan Prefecture's city wasn't on land but in the Eastern Sea, supposedly built upon the back of an enormous ancient turtle whose massive shell supported a celestial city.</p><p>Legend says the ancient turtle is still alive, currently dormant. If true, its lifespan is incredibly long, a form of immortality.</p><p>"How long will you be, Senior?"  Gu Ya was afraid of being left behind, having just encountered a powerful cultivator from the lower realms.</p><p>"Not long. I have some things to do.  Once you’re healed, you'll help me. I'll teach you a refining technique to refine the Jade Heart Blade, aiming for its advancement to a spirit treasure. We'll be able to kill more of the Changyou people upon our return."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a blank jade slip, inscribed the secret technique, and gave it to Gu Ya.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Qin, for the technique. I will diligently cultivate it!" Gu Ya happily accepted it, eagerly studying it.</p><p>After settling Gu Ya, Qin Sang stayed for a while, meticulously setting up restrictions on the two captives, before leaving the Chen Family Secret Manor and heading towards the rendezvous point.</p><p>The rendezvous point was deeper within the Fengju Jade Gate, a hundred-kilometer expanse of void.</p><p>Illusory scenes surrounded the void.  Qin Sang passed through them and entered the void to see the Luan carriage at its center.  Young Master Xin and the others were already there.</p><p>The dragon and phoenix pulling the carriage were gone; the Luan carriage had transformed into an elegant palace, quietly floating there.</p><p>Several stone platforms surrounded the Luan carriage, each with a cultivator seated on it; Qu Zhen and the others occupied one.</p><p>The others were unfamiliar faces, presumably the elite of the Xin family, all at least at the Nascent Soul stage, each team led by a Transformation stage cultivator.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang entered the void, his eyes narrowed as he looked towards the palace.  On one side was Young Master Xin’s private chamber, still veiled by light gauze, concealing its occupant.  The other side was empty, with only two people.</p><p>A young stranger sat behind a jade desk, eyes closed.  Butler Luo carefully attended to him.</p><p>The young man had a thin face and exceptionally thick eyebrows. He wore a silver robe that shimmered with a metallic sheen, woven from countless small scales yet as soft as silk.</p><p>This person was clearly a Nascent Soul cultivator, his aura even stronger than Qin Sang's, comparable to Old Man Guyun, not far from the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At that moment, the young man opened his eyes, his gaze sharp and intense, falling on Qin Sang.</p><p>"Greetings, Elder Qin."</p><p>Qu Zhen and the others also saw Qin Sang and immediately rose to greet him. The Xin family cultivators also stood up, secretly observing Qin Sang.</p><p>Elder Qin finally arrived,” a voice from behind the silk curtain announced, “Let me introduce you both. This is Elder Pei, a revered guest of the Xin family, who has helped us overcome numerous crises. Elder Pei, this is Elder Qin of the Five Elements Alliance, whom I've specially invited to assist us.”</p><p>Elder Pei frowned, coldly questioning, “Inviting a Nascent Soul cultivator without consulting me first?”</p><p>His tone was like that of an elder reproving a junior.</p><p>Young Master Xin remained calm, patiently explaining, “This mission requires a master artificer.  Those who achieve such mastery at the Spirit Transformation stage are extremely rare. I’ve been searching for years without finding a suitable candidate.  Since Elder Pei hadn’t arrived yet, I took the liberty.”</p><p>Elder Pei snorted, “You keep things from me!  Who decides what kind of help is needed, if not the Xin family? Countless sects and clans would crave my protection.  Do you think the Xin family would even catch my eye if not for my friendship with your father?”</p><p>“I didn’t intend to hide anything, Elder. You know my father, before his passing, made me swear an oath not to reveal anything to outsiders,”</p><p>Young Master Xin said with a bitter tone, “Once we find the location, everything will be clear.  Please bear with me.”</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang flew closer, entering the palace.  He bowed slightly to Elder Pei, smiling ambiguously, “Elder Pei seems displeased by my presence.  Young Master Xin, are you planning to break our agreement?”</p><p>He had accepted Young Master Xin’s invitation to conceal his true intentions and utilize the Xin family’s resources.  Whether or not he would assist the Xin family with their alchemy was inconsequential.</p><p>During their previous discussion, Young Master Xin had offered two conditions: sufficient Purple Origin Stones, and appointing Qin Sang as a Xin family retainer, with the reward to be decided upon finding their target.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care about the Xin family's reward and casually agreed. However, it seemed being a retainer wasn't so easy.</p><p>A ploy to use one to subdue another?</p><p>If Young Master Xin was attempting this strategy, he might have chosen the wrong target.</p><p>“The Five Elements Alliance is renowned, and Elder Qin, as one of their elders, possesses unparalleled skill in the art of alchemy. Elder Pei would struggle to find someone superior to him,” Young Master Xin said.</p><p>Elder Pei was blunt with Young Master Xin, yet outwardly showed no displeasure towards Qin Sang. He rose and returned the bow, his expression indifferent. “The deed is done, why should I play the villain? Besides, your actions have already attracted attention. Where could you find a master artificer on such short notice?”</p><p>“We shall rely heavily on both Elder Pei and Elder Qin on this journey,” from behind the curtain, Young Master Xin could be seen bowing deeply.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal.</p><p>Young Master Xin coughed lightly. The Xin family members immediately left the platform, forming an array in front of the palace. Qu Zhen and his men also closed in.</p><p>Then, Steward Luo stepped forward, producing a stack of yellow talismans and distributing them among the leaders; Qu Zhen also received one.</p><p>Along with the talismans, a map was also distributed.</p><p>“Hold these talismans, and search according to the marked routes, splitting up. While searching, continuously burn these talismans with your True Qi. They should emit red flames. If the flames behave unusually, stay put and send a signal immediately. The Xin family's future depends on all of you!” Young Master Xin said solemnly.</p><p>“Elder Qin?”</p><p>Sensing Young Master Xin’s gaze, Qin Sang flicked out several streams of light, which landed on the maps held by the leaders, adding markings.</p><p>“While searching, please check these locations and record the surrounding environment for my assessment.  I shall reward handsomely anyone who finds the Earth Spirit Jade Vine.”</p><p>The marked locations were special places selected by Qin Sang after examining numerous maps and conducting personal investigations.</p><p>Elder Pei remained silent, eyes closed, seemingly ignoring the actions of Young Master Xin and Qin Sang.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The crowd bowed and dispersed immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang also left the palace, saying, “I shall search for the herbs myself. I’ll report any findings to you.”</p><p>After a brief farewell, Qin Sang departed with Qu Zhen and his men.</p><p>He had chosen some locations only accessible to Nascent Soul cultivators, requiring his personal presence.</p><p>Further into their journey, after reaching a void, Qin Sang divided the Hengsha members into two groups for exploration, keeping only Qu Zhen by his side.</p><p>“Tell me, where exactly did you want me to go? Was it related to the Ancient Sword Pavilion?”</p>
