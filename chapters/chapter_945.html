<h1>Chapter 937: The Vow</h1><p>If the opponent were only at the early Yuan Ying stage, there might be a glimmer of hope using the Summoning Thunder Technique and other methods in a special place like the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground.</p><p>Right now, a top expert second only to the Demon Lord and the leader of the Heavenly Dao Sect is guarding outside the Demon Fire. Qin Sang couldn't figure out how to escape under his very nose.</p><p>"After I left last time, he followed. This means he likely discovered the traces I left then. This person is incredibly patient, waiting for decades to lie in wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He looked up, "He's after the treasures in the Ghost Land, isn't he?"</p><p>Bai let out a cold laugh.  "What else could it be? Didn't you also think there were ancient treasures within the Demon Ban? Countless cultivators have tried to break through the Demon Ban over the years, all failing. Otherwise, I could have left this cage long ago. Who would have thought this is just a dead place sealed by the Demon Ban, with only lost souls and bones everywhere?"</p><p>"You want to make a deal with me?  Do you have a way to get me out unnoticed?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang finally willing to discuss business, Bai said eagerly, "It's not just you. I want to leave here with you, so you can trust me completely."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled, surprised. "You can leave the Ghost Land? Though my cultivation is low, I can still see a little. The Demon Ban here is incredibly strange. If I'm not mistaken, those who set the Demon Ban around the Ghost Land aimed to trap you all here forever, right? After you possessed the Flying Night Rakshasa's body, you are no longer afraid of the Demon Ban's seal? I could try to help you escape, but if you trigger the Demon Ban's fury, we'd both turn to ashes in the Demon Fire."</p><p>Bai was silent for a moment, then said calmly, "It seems you have quite the talent in the Dao of Restrictions! However, the Demon Ban has been weakened over time. It's not surprising you can see through it.  Indeed, I haven't fully merged with this body, and even with your help, I can't break free. So, I need to see the treasure you use to manipulate the Demon Fire…"</p><p>Bai paused.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, hesitated, then flicked his sleeve. Three small demon banners swirled out.  He hadn't activated his true energy, so the Nine Nether Demon Fire wasn't visible.</p><p>"That's it!"</p><p>Seeing the banners, Bai's eyes gleamed, his face filled with surprise.  "The Demon Fire is sealed within this treasure, right? The three banners' energies are connected, forming a great array! The black pole you took out earlier is very similar to these banners. Are you planning to collect the Demon Fire and refine more banners?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment, then said, "You have sharp eyes. Yes, I returned to the Ghost Land to refine this treasure…"</p><p>There was no need to hide anything at this point.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained his plan to refine soul threads, collect the Nine Nether Demon Fire, and re-refine the banners. Finally, he smiled faintly, "It seems the resentful souls in the Ghost Land may have been your acquaintances. You won't stop me from refining soul threads, will you?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Bai didn't answer. His gaze was deep, as if seeing through eons, piercing through the river of time.</p><p>"Earlier, I said I stayed in this dark Ghost Land because of an obsession, holding on until now. Do you know what that obsession is?"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could answer, Bai said faintly, "It's an obsession, but it's also a vow. My memories have all decayed, I've forgotten who I am. Only this vow remains, never forgotten, my only remaining memory."</p><p>Bai turned and looked into the depths of the Ghost Land.</p><p>There, ghost mist was like a sea, bones formed mountains.</p><p>The resentful souls had lost their intelligence, forgotten themselves, dazed and confused, trapped by the Demon Ban, never to be reborn.</p><p>"I want to break the Demon Ban, to free them, to send them to reincarnation!"</p><p>Bai looked at Qin Sang, his eyes bright, his voice firm.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at him, at the familiar corpse-like body, seemingly shining with incomparable brilliance.</p><p>A vow spanning countless years, supporting him to this day, enduring loneliness and despair, waiting for an opportunity that might never come.</p><p>"Is there really reincarnation?"  Qin Sang unconsciously voiced a question that had long puzzled him, glancing at the surrounding mountains of bones. "Even if there is reincarnation, their spirits have long been extinguished. How could they be reborn?  With the magic seal broken, they'll likely become wandering ghosts, wouldn't they?"</p><p>Bai's face showed a look of confusion; he shook his head and chuckled wryly. "I don't know! Perhaps, the vow I made in my previous life was only for peace of mind. All I know is that there's a great formation in this ghost land that can purify lost souls, possibly one I left behind. Whether it can purify them is up to fate. This vow is the meaning I've held onto until now. Only by fulfilling it can I search for myself!"</p><p>"So, friend, you intend to stop me from refining the soul threads?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, flashing with dangerous light.</p><p>Bai shook his head. "Friend, don't misunderstand! I won't stop you, because only by letting you refine the magic banners can I fulfill my vow. However, the secret method for refining the soul threads can be slightly modified, although it will be more cumbersome. There are countless souls here; you don't need to exterminate them all. Extracting a wisp of soul energy from each is more than enough for refining the treasure."</p><p>Hearing Bai's words, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then his expression softened slightly. He nodded slightly. "Friend, your suggestion seems feasible, though it adds considerable trouble. However, if you can help me restrain the souls and command them to let me extract their soul energy quietly, the speed shouldn't be much slower."</p><p>Bai was overjoyed. "I will certainly do my utmost to assist!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him, chuckled, "Friend, don't get too excited. We've talked for so long without getting to the point. What exactly do you want me to do? And what are the terms of this exchange?"</p><p>"What you need to do is simple.  Over time, the magic seal has developed numerous flaws. I hope that when you collect the demonic fire, you'll do so at specific locations to weaken the seal."</p><p>Bai explained rapidly, "Then, I will activate the great formation and forcefully attack the seal, purifying the souls. Once the seal is broken, the ghost mist accumulated here will erupt.  With these combined, the spectacle will be incredibly dramatic, and the person outside will be hit by a powerful shockwave. Taken by surprise, they'll be flustered and unable to react, allowing us to escape..."</p><p>Then, Bai explained his plan in detail to Qin Sang.</p><p>"So, the demonic fire not only seals the valley entrance but is spread throughout the entire magic seal. This way, we can quietly refine eighteen magic banners."</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang showed a thoughtful expression.</p><p>He had been worried that the commotion of collecting the Nine Nether Demonic Fire would be impossible to conceal and would alert the enemy outside.</p>
