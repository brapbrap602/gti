<h1>Chapter 624: The Boundless Sea (Bonus chapter for patron Qianyu!)</h1><p>A glimpse through a tube reveals only a small part of the picture.  The Western Frontier is barren, with thin spiritual energy, unsuitable for long-term cultivation. Even local Core Formation cultivators choose to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't want to be stuck in such a place; it would hinder his future cultivation.</p><p>Beyond the Western Frontier, the world is vast.</p><p>If he continues to fail in finding the ancient teleportation formation, Qin Sang will have to temporarily set it aside. He’ll leave the Western Frontier, find a suitable cultivation ground, increase his cultivation base, and then return to try again.</p><p>Lately, Qin Sang has been wondering if Senior Qing Zhu encountered the same predicament.</p><p>During the teleportation, Qin Sang was nearly torn apart by the ancient formation.  He survived only because he lost an arm and overexerted his divine sense. If his spiritual power hadn't been sealed by the restrictive talisman, the outcome would certainly have been better.</p><p>Senior Qing Zhu was at least a late Core Formation expert back then, so he shouldn’t have perished during teleportation.  Yet, despite his unrevenged grievance, he never returned to the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Did something unexpected happen?</p><p>Or could Senior Qing Zhu also not find the ancient teleportation formation?</p><p>A sense of foreboding washed over Qin Sang.</p><p>"Has there ever been a master named Qing Zhu in the Western Frontier?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi lowered his head in thought for a moment, then shook his head. "Although the Western Frontier is barren, mostly wilderness, prominent figures do emerge from time to time. This junior hasn't heard of anyone named Qing Zhu."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Think carefully. Qing Zhu is just his real name. He might have aliases like 'Sword Demon.' This person is devoted to the way of the sword, skilled in sword control techniques, and is at least a late Core Formation master, possibly even a Nascent Soul cultivator. Regardless of recent times, looking back over two hundred years, has there been anyone resembling him?"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi smiled. "Senior, if such a person existed in the Western Frontier, they would surely be renowned throughout the entire region! Cultivators native to the Western Frontier usually leave after reaching Core Formation. How could such a powerful figure reside here? Even those who come searching for insects don't stay long. If you're looking for someone, senior, this junior can inquire while gathering information. Perhaps there will be some leads."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was curious about Qin Sang's purpose.</p><p>Could the person he sought, like his own martial uncle, be a senior from his sect who disappeared without a trace?</p><p>He had guessed correctly. This person's sect indeed had a Nascent Soul grandmaster. His background was extraordinary.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Besides this, spread the word that I'm offering a high price for Soul-Guiding Grass and Eternal Camphorwood. Also, keep an eye out for any sightings of Ember Sparrows."</p><p>Eternal Camphorwood is usually buried deep underground and hard to find.</p><p>If they could find its companion beast, the Ember Sparrow, they could follow the trail to locate the Eternal Camphorwood.</p><p>The only missing material for the Concentric Rings of Harmony was Eternal Camphorwood. Finding it would grant Qin Sang another magical treasure, the fastest way to increase his strength at present.</p><p>Moreover, the Concentric Rings of Harmony had unique effects that would be useful when venturing deep into the wilderness to search for the ancient teleportation formation.</p><p>As for Soul-Guiding Grass, the more the better. Refining more Flying Night Demons would make him practically invincible in the early Core Formation stage.</p><p>"Ember Sparrow, Eternal Camphorwood, Soul-Guiding Grass..."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi's face fell. He inwardly complained about Qin Sang's excessive demands, practically treating their Five Elements Sect like errand boys. Fortunately, it was all about gathering information, not risking their lives.</p><p>"This junior hasn't heard of any of these. Please describe them in detail, senior."</p><p>These three were quite rare. It was normal for Cui Xuanzi to be unfamiliar with them. Qin Sang took out a jade slip and inscribed their images onto it.</p><p>"Work diligently, and I won't treat you unfairly."</p><p>Qin Sang took out two top-grade magical artifacts and a few bottles of spirit pills, flashed them before Cui Xuanzi's eyes, then put them away, tossing him the jade slip.</p><p>...</p><p>Black-Winged Eagle's cave.</p><p>Now fortified with spirit arrays by Qin Sang, it served as a temporary dwelling, acceptable for the time being. He would definitely need to change it later, but with the Western Frontier's sparse spiritual energy, finding a suitable cave wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on a meditation mat, holding three jade slips, examining them one by one.</p><p>The contents of these jade slips were the Five Elements Sect's secret insect control techniques, a cartographic map, and the Insect Ranking List, which marked the habitats of some spirit insects.</p><p>This information was accumulated by the Five Elements Sect over many years.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi had been sent away by Qin Sang to continue gathering information.</p><p>Eager to understand where he had landed, Qin Sang first examined the cartographic map.</p><p>The Five Elements Sect's map was most detailed around the Bear Mountain region and provided brief descriptions of major powers in the Western Frontier.  Beyond the Western Frontier, it was extremely simplified.</p><p>Especially beyond the Shaman Continent, it was blank.</p><p>According to the map, the Shaman Continent could be roughly divided into three regions: the Western Frontier, the Southern Frontier, and Shaman Mountain.</p><p>Both the Western and Southern Frontiers were considered wilderness. The Western Frontier was the most barren, shunned by masters. The Southern Frontier was slightly better than the Western Frontier, with more numerous and stronger factions, but it was also the most chaotic, plagued by constant warfare.</p><p>The Western Frontier was filled with treacherous mountains and dangerous waters, with few places suitable for shamanic tribes to live, such as the Bear Mountain region, where mortals and cultivators lived together in relatively safe settlements.</p><p>These regions were separated by wilderness, some extremely far apart.</p><p>The wilderness was full of dangers. Mortals entering it would die, and even Foundation Establishment cultivators had to be constantly vigilant.</p><p>Seeing this map, Qin Sang finally had a clear understanding of the Shaman Continent's size and couldn't help but marvel at the vastness of this sea region.</p><p>This sea region where the Shaman Continent was located was once called the Shaman Sea by the shamanic tribes. After the rise of humans, it was renamed the Boundless Sea, much to the resentment of the shamans, but they were helpless.</p><p>The Western Frontier alone was almost as large as the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Excluding the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, the Small Cold Realm was a long, narrow strip running east to west, while the Western Frontier, located on the west side of the Shaman Continent, was roughly semicircular.</p><p>The Southern Frontier was similar in shape to the Small Cold Realm, but even larger than the Western Frontier.</p><p>Shaman Mountain was the name of a mountain, considered the ancestral home and sacred ground of the shamanic tribes. It represented the most fertile region of the Shaman Continent. Compared to Shaman Mountain, the Western and Southern Frontiers were merely remote areas.</p><p>The most powerful shamanic factions were all located there.</p><p>Legend had it that there was a late Nascent Soul grandmaster among the shamans, but the Five Elements Sect, being ill-informed, didn't know which faction this grandmaster belonged to.</p><p>The Shaman Continent was just one island, albeit the largest, in the entire Boundless Sea region. The shamanic tribes controlled the Shaman Continent and the surrounding sea area, located in the southeastern corner of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>The Storm Demon Sea wasn't within the Boundless Sea.</p><p>It was said that the Boundless Sea wasn't endless. Its edges were surrounded by terrifying storms, held back by a strange barrier formed by an ancient restriction. At its fiercest points, even Nascent Soul cultivators dared not venture in.</p><p>To this day, no one knew how this barrier was formed or who created it.</p><p>Constantly battered by the storms, the barrier remained incredibly stable.</p><p>Reading this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He suddenly recalled the spirit tides in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and the mysterious barrier between the battlefield and the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>They sounded so similar. Was there a connection between them?</p>
