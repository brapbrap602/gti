<h1>Chapter 1970: The Move</h1><p>Outside Yan's capital city.</p><p>A carriage left the main road, heading towards a mountain path.  Deep woods lined both sides, the path growing increasingly rugged.</p><p>The driver was a strong man, with prominent temples – clearly a martial arts expert, yet content to be a mere driver.  Even the most skilled warrior was helpless on such a treacherous path.</p><p>After traveling a difficult distance, a voice from inside the carriage said, "Stop here. Wait for us."</p><p>"Yes!" The driver dismounted and stood respectfully to one side.</p><p>The carriage curtain lifted, and Yu Lang and Tao Teng emerged, walking towards the deep mountains, their figures gradually disappearing into the woods.</p><p>They moved swiftly and effortlessly.</p><p>The atmosphere was heavy. Tao Teng's expression remained gloomy, burdened by worry.</p><p>"Is it that one?"</p><p>Having crossed a ridge, Yu Lang pointed ahead.  A mountain, seemingly ethereal, was visible through the mist.</p><p>Tao Teng nodded absently.</p><p>Yu Lang sighed inwardly. After returning to the capital and discussing a strategy with Sha Jia Yu, he’d passed the information on to Tao Teng, leaving him in this state. He understood Tao Teng's aspirations and his feelings, but didn't know how to comfort his friend.</p><p>"It's my fault for involving you!"</p><p>Tao Teng suddenly said, filled with guilt.</p><p>After learning the truth, Tao Teng realized his master was extraordinary.  He hadn't even reached the Foundation Establishment stage, a time when he should have focused on cultivation, yet his master had allowed him, even encouraged him, to leave the mountain, showing no concern about hindering his progress.</p><p>Tao Teng dared not think too deeply.</p><p>But his instincts told him the truth was likely what he least wanted to accept!</p><p>Perhaps Yu Lang and Master Qingfeng were also implicated.</p><p>After becoming his disciple, he recalled his experience at the Drunk Fragrance Tower, and the conversation between the storyteller and Master Qingfeng.  The more he considered it, the more he felt both were extraordinary figures, prompting him to seek guidance from his master.</p><p>If his master had foreseen the coming chaos, even directly intervened…</p><p>If the cultivation world was as Sha Jia Yu described – everyone caught in a maelstrom.</p><p>The master and disciple, originally secluded in Qingyang Temple, practicing medicine and avoiding the world, were now disturbed because of him.</p><p>Yu Lang sighed lightly, "You were also kept in the dark.  Inviting me down the mountain was out of good intentions.  Now that it’s happened, don't overthink it."</p><p>In fact, he was also worried, but not excessively so. His master's words had inexplicably given him confidence.</p><p>The mountain path ended.  The two concealed themselves, activated their artifacts, flew towards the mountain, and landed before a stone cave.</p><p>Tao Teng knelt, "Disciple greets Master."</p><p>"Junior Qin Yu Lang pays his respects to the senior."</p><p>Yu Lang bowed.</p><p>After a moment of silence, a strong voice echoed from within the cave, "Disciple, why have you returned to the mountain?"</p><p>The stone door remained closed.</p><p>Tao Teng kept his head bowed, recounting in a calm voice what Yu Lang had told him, seeking his master's confirmation.</p><p>His master showed no surprise, replying calmly, "Now that you know, what do you plan to do?"</p><p>"Disciple has questions to ask Master."</p><p>Tao Teng paused, seeing his master remained silent, and then asked, "When cultivators enter the mortal world, do they use mortals as pawns, driving them to conflict, until the nations are unified and a victor emerges?"</p><p>"Yes," his master admitted frankly, without explanation.</p><p>Tao Teng’s body trembled slightly. He continued, "Do cultivators who enter the mortal world participate in battles, using treasures and spells to slaughter mortals?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"But without divine supervision, their every word and deed still has a massive impact on the mortal world. With them present, unless mortals are decimated, the war may never end!"</p><p>Tao Teng said solemnly.</p><p>"In wars between mortals, even if a massive army is defeated, it doesn't necessarily require over half its soldiers to be lost. It might not even be due to casualties, but simply because the commander, after assessing the situation, finds they are outmatched, or due to factors outside the battlefield, they surrender.</p><p>"Cultivators, however, change this situation.</p><p>"For example, they don't need to fight on the battlefield. They only need to reveal their cultivator status to the monarch or high-ranking officials, promising them immortal pills, or offering them a path to immortality, deceiving them.</p><p>"Some will be swayed, disregarding everything to achieve their goals, consuming every soldier and citizen, even driving all the people onto the battlefield, refusing to yield!</p><p>"With such powerful incentives, rebellions can erupt at any time, and the war will never end!"</p><p>After Tao Teng finished, his master uttered an "Oh," "What is your solution?"</p><p>"Disciple has two ideas.</p><p>"First, cultivators no longer hide their identities, becoming generals and ministers, fighting on the front lines, engaging in magical confrontations.</p><p>"Second, strictly forbid cultivators from deceiving mortals.  Let the conflict resolve itself through mortal means, and then depart, avoiding any desperate struggles.”</p><p>This was the only thing he and Yu Lang could think of to help the people of Yan.</p><p>Engaging cultivators in preemptive battles naturally reduces civilian casualties.</p><p>By eliminating cultivator interference, the two brothers, working together, could secure continuous victories for Yan, thus fulfilling their responsibility to the people.</p><p>Just as Sha Jia Yu had said, they would do their best!</p><p>A moment of silence filled the cave. His master neither confirmed nor denied, simply saying, "Go down the mountain. Achieve great merit, and upon your return to the sect, you shall receive rich rewards."</p><p>Tao Teng opened his mouth, a wry smile appearing, "My only wish is to bring prosperity to Yan's people, I dare not hope for anything more."</p><p>Without another word, he bowed and left.</p><p>Yu Lang stood silently beside him, about to take his leave, when Tao Teng's master called him.</p><p>"I've long admired Master Qingfeng's reputation. Your mastery of both lesser and greater cultivation paths surely marks you as a truly accomplished individual.</p><p>"Tao Teng mentioned your secluded cultivation, but pressing matters have prevented me from paying a visit.</p><p>"Please convey a message for me.</p><p>"Great changes are coming, and the world is in peril.</p><p>"Should the need arise, I hope you won't hesitate to lend your aid.  Of course, such occasions will be rare.</p><p>"In ordinary times, no one will disturb your tranquility!"</p><p>Yu Lang waited a moment, ensuring Tao Teng's master had no further instructions, then respectfully replied, "I shall deliver your message."</p><p>The two returned the way they came.</p><p>From beginning to end, they never saw Tao Teng's master's face.</p><p>On the descent, Yu Lang mused silently.</p><p>The situation wasn't as dire as Sha had described.</p><p>Regarding the various factions, Yun Du Tian and Luo Hun Yuan weren't simply using them like slaves; they were also engaging in both conciliation and suppression, rather than overwhelming them with sheer force.</p><p>That's true strategic maneuvering.</p><p>The Bai Li clan, for example, were being suppressed, while the master was clearly being courted.</p><p>His descent from the mountain, at Tao Teng's urging, had been a brilliant move;  from that point, his master's stance had clearly shifted.</p><p>His master had likely foreseen their strategy, already understanding the situation, and thus felt no worry.</p><p>With this realization, Yu Lang felt completely at ease.</p><p>Little did he know, his understanding was still too shallow.</p><p>…</p><p>After descending the mountain.</p><p>Tao Teng and Yu Lang, single-minded in their purpose, assisted the monarch, diligently governing and doing everything possible to strengthen Yan's power.</p><p>They prepared for war, awaiting the coming great conflict.</p><p>The war arrived as expected.</p><p>The northern Qi state launched a sudden attack, and Yan retreated steadily, yet refrained from sending reinforcements north.</p><p>Yu Lang oversaw the court, while Tao Teng led the army; one internally, the other externally, calmly and methodically subduing the smaller states surrounding Yan.</p><p>In just three years, all surrounding nations submitted, and Yan's power reached its zenith.</p><p>However, turmoil engulfed the entire world.</p><p>Larger nations swallowed smaller ones; internal divisions within larger nations led to warfare; and large nations clashed.</p><p>Mergers and splits were commonplace.</p><p>At this time, the struggle for succession in Liang still raged, with the country teetering on the brink of division.</p><p>Behind this, of course, were two opposing factions at work, and the involvement of cultivators was clear to anyone with discerning eyes.</p><p>Yan, while resisting Qi, secretly colluded with the third prince of Liang, participating in the succession struggle.</p><p>Similar situations were prevalent throughout the land.</p><p>Even within the same faction, conflicts over merit were common; no one willingly submitted; a winner always had to emerge before unity could be achieved.</p><p>War spread throughout the land, creating chaos, with cultivators appearing everywhere.</p><p>Under the combined efforts of Yu Lang and Tao Teng, Yan emerged victorious, its territory expanding repeatedly.</p><p>Had it not been for the ever-present ominous cloud hanging over the cultivator world, halting the march of war,</p><p>Yan might have truly entered an unprecedented era of prosperity!</p><p>But the cost was immense.</p><p>…</p><p>War ravaged the land.</p><p>The cultivator world was rife with slaughter.</p><p>Only Qin Sang's training grounds remained a sanctuary, untouched by the conflict.</p><p>All of Qin Sang's forces had been sent down the mountain, leaving the grounds unusually quiet.</p><p>Only some remaining demonic soldiers patrolled the perimeter diligently at regular intervals.</p><p>The cave atop the mountain remained sealed.</p><p>One day,</p><p>the stone gate silently opened, and Qin Sang emerged.</p><p>He looked towards the world beyond, his gaze sweeping across the entire fiery expanse.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Qin Sang beckoned, and a golden thread shot out from the lava—the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had successfully overcome its tribulation, entering its fifth transformation, its appearance becoming even more imposing and ferocious.</p><p>It was one of the few fifth-transformation Fire Jade Centipedes in existence.</p><p>However, after achieving its fifth transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede didn’t undergo any further changes, and there was no sign of it evolving into a Water-Fire Divine Centipede.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to help the Fire Jade Centipede and could only proceed step by step.</p><p>Then, a butterfly-shaped shadow flew out from his dantian and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Alas, it wasn't easy to help the Sky-Eyed Butterfly evolve beyond its sixth stage, otherwise it would have been a great asset to Qin Sang.</p><p>The man and his two insects vanished.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang's footsteps covered the entire Fire Domain.</p><p>Using the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-hunting ability and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's celestial vision, he explored every corner.</p><p>Qin Sang paid particular attention to the several ruins discovered by the Corpse Demons of the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>He wanted to know what treasure had attracted the interest of two powerful factions, causing them to engage in such a large-scale conflict.</p><p>Both factions continuously sent experts into the Fire Domain, including top-tier cultivators at the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, neither side's Void Refinement cultivators would act rashly; they were playing a waiting game.  These individuals alone couldn't possibly discover Qin Sang's whereabouts.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that new ruins had been unearthed recently.</p><p>Most of these were controlled by the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>It seemed the Fallen Soul Abyss had the upper hand.</p><p>There were places Qin Sang couldn't simply force his way into. After careful observation, he confirmed that these ruins were intricately connected to the bronze pillar.</p><p>During his travels, Qin Sang happened upon a conflict between the two factions.</p><p>A new ruin had been discovered.</p><p>Four of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du Tian appeared, and the Fallen Soul Abyss matched their number.</p><p>During the fierce battle, nobody noticed a single person quietly infiltrating the ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the ruin without fear, even if the ancestors of both factions were present.</p><p>Sure enough, this ruin shared its origins with his own cultivation ground.</p><p>After exploring, Qin Sang found many differences.</p><p>The restrictions of this ruin seemed similar to those of his cultivation ground, but there were significant discrepancies.</p><p>The formations and prohibitions of his cultivation ground were more complex and profound, suggesting greater importance.</p><p>"The Panlong Ancient Array…"</p><p>Standing in the center of the ruin, Qin Sang repeated the four words he'd recently heard.</p><p>He had never heard of such an ancient array before.</p><p>But these discoveries alone were enough to be earth-shattering.</p><p>If each ruin were merely a part of the Panlong Ancient Array, this ancient array would be even more massive than the Altar Array.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that the entire Fire Domain might be only a small part of the Panlong Ancient Array.</p><p>If so, the power behind this array was unimaginable.</p><p>The Fallen Soul Abyss and Yun Du Tian combined wouldn't be a match for them; no wonder they were so keen on finding it.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to locate other ruins, but even with the help of his two spirit insects, he found nothing.</p><p>Clearly, the factions had special methods.</p><p>So, Qin Sang stopped wasting his energy.</p><p>After visiting every unearthed ruin, Qin Sang came to a conclusion: the bronze pillar was a vital part of the Panlong Ancient Array.</p><p>Now there was something he could do!</p><p>After his travels, Qin Sang returned to his cultivation ground, entered the fire chamber, and stared at the bronze pillar in deep thought.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang flew above his cultivation ground again, and directed a series of hand seals downwards.</p><p>With Qin Sang's actions, the entire cultivation ground trembled.</p><p>Magma boiled, and formation flags rose from the ground, even lifting the mountain peaks with them.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>The mountain peaks soared into the air.</p><p>The formation flags circled rapidly, spinning as they were inserted into the mountain bodies.</p><p>With a booming sound, all the strange phenomena disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang's Azure Luan appeared behind him, carrying the mountain peaks to a chosen magma lake, plunging them below the surface.</p><p>The cave dwelling, along with the demonic soldiers inside, was hidden.</p><p>Two hundred years ago, Qin Sang had personally created this cultivation ground; now, he personally destroyed it.</p><p>The cultivation ground returned to its former state, and the ruin reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his fingers, and the ruin's restrictions gradually restored themselves.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't completely restore the ruin; he removed the bronze pillar and the most crucial parts.</p><p>Qin Sang had long sealed off the area around his cultivation ground.  The entire process, despite its unusual effects, hadn't disturbed anyone.</p><p>Having completed all this, Qin Sang looked south.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, the Supreme Patriarch of Yun Du Tian, and Bu Hua Gu Ming Hu, the ancestor of the Fallen Soul Abyss, were engrossed in a game of Go.</p><p>It was his turn to make a move!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly. He waved his sleeve and flew south, carrying the bronze pillar.</p><p>He flew out of the Fire Domain, into the desert.</p><p>The desert's subsoil was also connected to the underground fire veins extending from the Fire Domain, and could be considered part of it.</p><p>Traveling across the desert, Qin Sang stopped.</p><p>This was the place he had chosen to make his move.</p>
