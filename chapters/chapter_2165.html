<h1>Chapter 2155: The Sacred Realm Beast</h1><p>“Master Qin, this is King Qi.”</p><p>Qin Sang was currently a guest at the Sihuang’s courtyard.</p><p>Sihuang had invited a member of the Siyou tribe. This person possessed exceptional beauty, a somewhat effeminate demeanor, exquisite attire, and the bearing of a king.</p><p>King Qi was one of the former Four Kings.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, bowed respectfully.</p><p>King Qi returned the courtesy with equal formality, his voice as soft as a woman’s.  “I have long admired Master Qin’s reputation, but I find it surpasses even what I’d heard.  Sihuang’s recruitment of Master Qin is a tremendous boon, a great reinforcement for our Siyou tribe.  That’s why, upon receiving Sihuang’s invitation, I didn’t hesitate to accept!”</p><p>“Thank you, King Qi, for your esteem; it is only through your regard that I have this opportunity to enter the Sacred Land,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>After the pleasantries, they took their seats. More guests arrived, all Siyou tribespeople, each either possessing formidable cultivation or high status, each a powerful figure in their own right.</p><p>The Shao Shi also arrived and sat beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Rare wines and celestial fruits filled the courtyard with fragrant aromas.</p><p>At the banquet, Sihuang and Qin Sang were the center of attention.  The extermination of the Grand Attendant, the destruction of the Lu Family, and avenging Si Lu – each event was earth-shattering for the Siyou tribe.</p><p>To avoid suspicion, Qin Sang had returned to Qingyang after conquering the Lu Manor; many had sought an audience with him unsuccessfully. This was their first opportunity to meet the master in person.</p><p>This meeting confirmed Qin Sang’s alliance with Sihuang, providing further reason for them to cultivate a relationship.</p><p>The banquet concluded.</p><p>The hosts and guests were pleased.  They then turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>Aside from Qin Sang, all the banquet guests were masters of the Shenlou artifacts.  These individuals each presented their own Shenlou.</p><p>The precious jade radiated a pure and clear light, almost sacred, enhancing the beauty of the courtyard.</p><p>Each person used their incantations to capture a strand of Qin Sang's essence and infuse it into their Shenlou.</p><p>New, ancient patterns appeared on the surface of the Shenlou before fading, the essence now imprinted within.</p><p>This act signified Qin Sang's acceptance by all the Shenlou masters of the Siyou tribe.  He needed do nothing further to easily pass through the gate to the Sacred Land.</p><p>The guests departed one by one. Qin Sang left with Shao Shi and went to the Shao Shi’s palace.</p><p>He was prepared to enter the Sacred Land, intending to remain here until its opening, serving as Shao Shi’s attendant.</p><p>In the Yuanjiao Fair, the Yi people's powerful cultivators, comparable to those in the late Transcending Void stage, were the focus of attention. Qin Sang, outwardly only in the mid-Transcending Void stage, would not attract scrutiny.  Disguised as a royal member, he had no fear of exposing himself.</p><p>The next day, cultivators in the Yuanjiao Fair noticed subtle changes in the celestial phenomena.  The bright sunlight grew dim, as if a layer of haze had settled over the sky.</p><p>Otherwise, there was no other effect. But by the following day, the haze had thickened, and over the next few days, the sky grew darker, the haze evolving into heavy clouds.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered, and fierce winds raged.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Fair was filled with high-level cultivators, unaffected by the celestial phenomena, yet they all sensed the imminent opening of the Sacred Land!</p><p>The opening of the Sacred Land meant the end of the Yuanjiao Fair. Those ineligible to enter the Sacred Land began packing their bags to leave.</p><p>One morning.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>A clap of thunder shook the entire Yuanjiao Fair.</p><p>Streams of light appeared in the sky above the Fair, as numerous individuals flew from their caves to gaze upwards.</p><p>Within the dark clouds, a golden light was dissipating.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>Another thunderclap followed, a golden lightning bolt splitting the clouds like a majestic golden dragon, clawing and tearing at the dark clouds.</p><p>*BOOM… RUMBLE…*</p><p>Countless golden lightning bolts, radiating immense power, caused the islands protected by the great formation to tremble.</p><p>The clouds were split and shattered by the lightning. The cultivators activated their spiritual vision, peering through the gaps to witness a different scene beyond the clouds, like two separate worlds.</p><p>There, countless rays of light and auspicious colors filled the sky; amidst white clouds were majestic mountains, jade trees, and celestial flowers.  Gods, immortals, celestial children, and auspicious beasts and birds freely roamed this ethereal paradise.</p><p>Sadly, it wasn't a true paradise, but a magnificent illusion, constantly shifting, the only constant being a mass of golden lightning.</p><p>Thunder echoed continuously from within the golden light, lightning flashing without cease, the source of the earth-shaking tremors.</p><p>Suddenly, with a *BOOM*, a thick golden thunderbolt erupted from the heart of the golden light.</p><p>The golden lightning struck, and everyone felt a stinging sensation in their eyes.  They watched in astonishment as the ethereal landscape cracked, the barrier between realms seemingly shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. He couldn't imagine the consequences of such a strike.</p><p>In an instant, dazzling golden light filled the heavens. The clouds dispersed, and the golden light bathed each island and every person.  Waves of golden lightning, each possessing earth-shattering power, erupted from the rift in the void.</p><p>The light was blinding, visible only to a few. At its center, a massive golden gate materialized.</p><p>Surrounded by swirling lightning, the gate stood in the void, exuding an imposing presence, like a celestial gateway to a mystical realm.  Beyond it lay a chaotic, golden cloud.</p><p>Before the celestial phenomenon subsided, several figures streaked from the Yuanjiao Sea City, heading straight for the gate.  They passed through the lightning without harm, entered the gate, and vanished from sight.</p><p>This sight stirred the cultivators of the various tribes.</p><p>The Shaoshi transmitted a message, "Qin Zhenren, we should act quickly."</p><p>Qin Sang looked toward Su Nu, Li Yu Fu, and Yu Nu. He then glanced at the Zhu Yan tribe's ranks, where Liao Chen and Liuli, disguised, stood beside the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>He nodded to Shaoshi.  Together, they soared into the air and flew towards the gate.</p><p>Up close, the gate was even larger than it appeared from below. The golden clouds beyond seemed like a devouring vortex. Qin Sang's heart tightened slightly as he followed Shaoshi into the gate.</p><p>As they passed through, Qin Sang focused his senses, but felt no disturbance, no probing or observation.  They entered seamlessly, disappearing into the golden clouds.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang found himself enveloped in a chaotic mass of clouds. A force more chaotic than the Nie River swirled around them, as if turning the world upside down.</p><p>"Whoosh...Whoosh..."</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A dizzying spin. Shaoshi's magic mirror spontaneously rose, emitting a white light that enveloped them and carried them toward a specific location within the clouds.</p><p>They landed beside a lake. The water was clear, the aquatic plants lush.  It was clearly a fertile place, yet eerily silent, devoid of any birds or animals.</p><p>Between two mountains on the lakeshore lay a valley, wide at the entrance and narrowing inward.  A vibrant, multicolored miasma sealed its entrance.  Within the miasma, strange figures could be seen moving.</p><p>Suddenly, the tranquility was shattered. Without warning, a hurricane swept across the land, plunging everything into darkness.  Aquatic plants were ripped from their roots, swirling in the air like tattered cloth. The miasma roiled violently, threatening to disperse.</p><p>"Hiss... hiss..."</p><p>High-pitched screams echoed from the valley, filled with fear and rage.  Countless figures emerged from the miasma.</p><p>Then, a thunderclap cracked overhead. A void appeared, glowing with golden light.  In an instant, the void closed, the light vanished, and two figures tumbled out – Shaoshi and Qin Sang.  They landed somewhat awkwardly but quickly recovered, surveying their surroundings. They had landed in the same place.</p><p>With the void gone, the hurricane began to subside, but the damage inflicted on this once beautiful place remained.</p><p>"This place..."</p><p>Shaoshi began to speak, but a scream cut him off.</p><p>Qin Sang turned toward the valley.  He saw the miasma churn as a horde of monsters burst forth.</p><p>These creatures had scorpion tails and bodies, but human-like upper bodies and heads.  However, they lacked human features, their faces grotesque and ugly.</p><p>They moved with incredible speed, their bodies trailing miasma as they shrieked, charging toward Qin Sang and Shaoshi, seemingly convinced they were the destroyers of their home.</p><p>The beasts were ferocious, exuding a familiar aura of savagery that Qin Sang recognized.  They bore some human-like characteristics, but weren't members of the Yi Ren tribe.  They were ferocious beasts!</p><p>"Ferocious beasts?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the scorpion-bodied creatures.  They were indeed ferocious beasts, but different from those inhabiting the Nie River. Their savagery was less intense, and they hadn't entirely lost their reason.  This allowed them to reproduce and form a community in their lair.</p><p>The viciousness seemed ingrained in their very souls, impossible to erase.  Therefore, their intelligence was limited.  Upon discovering an enemy, their ferocity would be ignited, eventually driving them into a mindless, frenzied rage; they would fight to the death.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the approaching threat.</p><p>A scorpion-like creature, clearly the leader, moved fastest, already ten zhang from them.  The miasma carried a nauseating stench.</p><p>Qin Sang's fingers twitched.  The earth's energy surged, forming countless invisible spirit swords, shimmering in the air.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>These scorpion creatures were at most of the Transformation Stage, no match for Qin Sang. They all perished.</p><p>Their blood, the same color as the miasma, overwhelmed its stench.  More frantic, enraged cries echoed through the valley as the leader, along with its kin, charged forth, their eyes bloodshot, their savagery unleashed.</p><p>To cultivators of the Great Thousand World, these unintelligent beasts weren't considered living beings. Qin Sang showed no mercy, his sword-light leaving a swathe of corpses by the lake.</p><p>Exploring the valley with his spiritual sense, Qin Sang let out a soft gasp.</p><p>He made a grasping motion, parting the miasma at the valley entrance. A mass of azure light flew out, containing a spirit flower.</p><p>The flower had broad, overlapping leaves, with a blue bloom nestled in the center.  The flower resembled a phoenix about to take flight, even possessing feather-like markings.</p><p>"Is that a Blue Phoenix Flower?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>This was a fortunate find.  The Blue Phoenix Flower was a rare medicinal herb, incredibly valuable in the outside world.  To find one in a nest of scorpion creatures was unexpected.</p><p>The Shaoshi glanced at it, saying, "It seems these scorpion creatures were lucky. There must not have been stronger beasts nearby for them to claim this flower. Since Qin Zhenren dealt with them, you should take it."</p><p>Seeing the Shaoshi's nonchalant reaction, Qin Sang thought, ‘The Sacred Land truly is a treasure trove.  While not exactly abundant, rare herbs aren't uncommon here.’</p><p>He readily took the Blue Phoenix Flower, carefully examining the surroundings, but found no distinguishing features.  He couldn't determine their exact location from the landscape alone.</p><p>"Our priority is determining our location.  The situation here is unclear. It's best we stick together until we're sure there's no danger, then we can search separately," the Shaoshi suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed. They erased their tracks and chose a random direction.</p><p>After traveling for a while, they encountered another group of beasts.  The Shaoshi dealt with them, but found no comparable herbs in their nest.</p><p>They found the land to be mountainous and dotted with numerous lakes, scattered among the hills like pearls strewn across the earth.</p><p>"Records mention several regions with such terrain: the southern part of Wanling Lake, the area around Rootless Island, the western foothills of the Hundred-Legged God Mountain…"</p><p>The Shaoshi whispered, "If we're near Rootless Island, we'll reach our rendezvous point soon."</p><p>Suddenly, they stopped their flight, exchanging a look as they gazed east. They had sensed two powerful auras approaching.</p><p>These weren't beasts; they were cultivators from the Heterogeneous Tribes!</p><p>They had encountered others so soon.</p><p>Their figures were not yet visible, but both possessed keen spiritual senses. As the auras neared, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>"Qin Xiong recognizes them?" asked the Shaoshi.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "Perhaps an old acquaintance."</p><p>As they drew closer, Qin Sang was about seventy percent certain one of them was the Quanfeng tribesman he'd fought when rescuing Si Lu.</p><p>Back then, he'd severely wounded the man, causing his body to collapse, forcing him to abandon his physical form, leaving only a small being within his ear to escape.  Now, not only was he healed, but his cultivation had greatly improved.</p><p>"A Quanfeng tribesman? Since he's from the Water Department, let's keep him!"</p><p>The Shaoshi sneered, but then both sensed something amiss.</p><p>The tribesman's approach was virtually unmasked. Qin Sang judged the speed to be nearly his limit, and he seemed somewhat panicked.</p><p>Were they intentionally luring beasts, or did they lack the energy to consider that?</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and the Shaoshi vaguely perceived an overwhelming pressure from the distant east. Even from such a distance, the instant they felt it, their hearts leaped, sending a jolt of fear through them.</p><p>"A Saint Realm beast!"</p><p>The Shaoshi's expression changed dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang's face also fell.  "Wasn't it said that upon entering the Sacred Land, one wouldn't generally encounter beasts of the Unity Transformation Stage?"</p>
