<h1>Chapter 1576  Soul Snatching</h1><p>“Is he waiting for that old geezer, or does he think someone with even higher cultivation will come to rescue her?”</p><p>Qin Sang flashed this thought, sneering inwardly.</p><p>He couldn't see the situation clearly before.</p><p>After Elder Yanshan and Situ Yu discovered the Snow Fox, Elder Yanshan stayed alone in the Northern Wasteland, without even a single disciple to serve him in his cave dwelling. Moreover, he repeatedly pursued the Snow Fox, indicating his deep value for the Cold Crystal, unlike what he claimed about its dispensability.</p><p>The demoness and the old fellow outside arrived so quickly, suggesting Luye wasn't far from the snowfield.</p><p>If Elder Yanshan knew of Luye’s existence beforehand and still dared to scheme against the Snow Fox under Luye's nose, deliberately concealing this matter from him, this person was definitely not as simple as he appeared.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's thoughts were unfathomable.</p><p>Luye was a Divine Transformation Daoist’s domain.</p><p>Caught in the middle, Qin Sang naturally had to be wary of both sides, lest he be used without realizing it. Both his true body and avatar reserved strength to deal with unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>If it weren't for his desire to seize the Cold Crystal, he would probably have already withdrawn to avoid the conflict, letting them fight it out first.</p><p>The fight had progressed to this point.</p><p>Elder Yanshan, in blocking the demoness, had been quite dedicated.  With the Cold Crystal successfully obtained, Qin Sang's suspicions diminished somewhat, and he decided to save this person and quickly leave this place of strife.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A cold light, deeper and more frigid than the tide of light, shot out from Qin Sang's palm, manifesting into a square seal.</p><p>As the Four-Winged Azure Serpent Seal appeared, an azure serpent detached from the seal's knob, its body expanding rapidly. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a fearsome beast, baring its fangs and claws, glaring at Yue Fei.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The azure serpent roared, its sound assaulting the soul, chilling one to the bone.</p><p>Even if a Divine Transformation cultivator could refine their natal magic treasure to the level of a spiritual treasure, refining other spiritual treasures was no easy feat, and they might not be willing to bestow them upon their disciples.</p><p>Even adopted sons of Divine Transformation cultivators might not possess spiritual treasures, let alone this woman.</p><p>Although this woman held numerous treasures, how could they compare to a spiritual treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought that with the appearance of the spiritual treasure, the demoness would regain some sense of reason.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the spiritual treasure, Yue Fei raised her snowy neck, staring intently at the azure serpent. Her bewitching face not only showed no fear, but a hint of ecstasy flickered deep within her eyes.</p><p>Then, Yue Fei reached for her waist, retrieving a jade disc from her interspatial pouch.</p><p>The circular jade disc was slightly larger than Yue Fei's palm.  Its surface was engraved with layers upon layers of intricate patterns, so dense that a single glance could make one dizzy.</p><p>Between the patterns, densely packed runes formed a Blood-Vein Ghost Diagram.</p><p>Simultaneously with retrieving the jade disc, Yue Fei, using her divine sense to control her true essence, caused a spiritual light to flicker between her brows, conjuring a talisman in mid-air – a technique of drawing talismans with empty strokes.</p><p>The illusory talisman shimmered with a faint blood-red light and instantly merged into the center of the jade disc.</p><p>The talisman wasn't complex, and Yue Fei wasn't a specialist in talismanic Dao.</p><p>This talisman was essentially a key, used to unlock the jade disc.</p><p>The jade disc vibrated with a humming sound, a strange power flowing between the patterns. In an instant, it lit up all the Blood-Vein Ghost Diagrams. Talismanic light flickered, and talismanic shadows overlapped.</p><p>This treasure turned out to be a talismanic disc inscribed with countless talismans. These talismans normally lay dormant, maintaining a certain balance after being crafted into the disc. Once the disc was activated, it could immediately display formidable power.</p><p>This type of talismanic disc was also a type of talismanic Dao treasure, different from the Secret Talisman Dao of the Shangyuan Clear Serenity Palace.</p><p>The Talismanic Dao was all-encompassing.  Even just discussing talismanic discs, there wasn't only this one type.</p><p>This particular talismanic disc was a one-time protective treasure that could be given to others, activated with a 'key,' similar to a single-use magical artifact.  Others could be used repeatedly, enhancing a cultivator's talisman-drawing speed and talisman-controlling power.  Their functions varied.</p><p>The activation of the talismanic disc occurred in a mere instant.</p><p>The talismanic disc in Yue Fei's palm returned to its original form, the Blood-Vein Ghost Diagrams vanishing, its power exhausted. A blood-red diagram array projected onto Yue Fei, enveloping her, the runes exceptionally intricate.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of showing mercy. Unleashing the full power of the spiritual treasure, the azure serpent, like an illusion of lightning, left a trail of cold flames in the air as it lunged to engulf Yue Fei.</p><p>Contrary to Qin Sang's expectations,</p><p>Even at this point, Yue Fei still stubbornly resisted. A Thunder Pearl soared high, bursting into a pink sphere of light. Countless lightning bolts cascaded down amidst deafening thunderclaps.</p><p>Lightning rained down.</p><p>The azure serpent, with unstoppable momentum, crashed into the vast net woven by the lightning.  Cold flames surged, instantly tearing the electrical net to shreds, colliding directly with the Thunder Pearl.</p><p>Seeing this, Yue Fei gritted her silver teeth, showing no intention of moving the Thunder Pearl.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The azure serpent struck.</p><p>The Thunder Pearl spun, its light suddenly blinding, shining like a star, exploding with a resounding boom.  A violent surge of thunderous power erupted, forming a terrifying thunder storm in mid-air.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The thunderstorm engulfed the azure serpent in reverse.</p><p>In that instant, pink lightning illuminated the entire ice cave, merging with the cold flames of the spiritual treasure and the blue tide of light, creating a dreamlike spectacle within the icy cavern.</p><p>This was the fifth treasure Yue Fei had destroyed, following the light veil, inner armor, butterfly tattoo, and talismanic disc.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.  As expected of someone from Luye, as expected of the adopted son of a Divine Transformation cultivator.  That fellow not only possessed numerous treasures, but was truly unstinting in his affection for his beloved concubine.</p><p>Unfortunately, this kind of Thunder Pearl excelled in its strange corrosive ability, its power actually inferior to true Divine Lightning.  Even the explosion of the Thunder Pearl couldn't stop the azure serpent, merely delaying it for a moment at most.</p><p>The thunderstorm roared, reaching its peak intensity when a point of cold light suddenly shone from its center.  Through the gap, one could see the gaping maw of the azure serpent and a faint sun accumulating in its throat.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The azure serpent merged with the cold flames, bursting through the thunderstorm head-on!</p><p>A reflection of the cold flames flickered in Yue Fei's watery eyes, a resolute glint flashing within.</p><p>She neither dodged nor flinched, the blood moon on her forehead turning crimson. She actually advanced instead of retreating, a seductive smile on her lips, her body enveloped in the blood-red diagram array, colliding head-on with the cold flames!</p><p>The demoness’ moth-to-a-flame action was something Qin Sang hadn't anticipated at all.</p><p>“Does she really think a mere talismanic disc can withstand a spiritual treasure?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened, sneering inwardly. He naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity.</p><p>As she wished, he would grant her a swift end!</p><p>In an instant,</p><p>The cold flames reached her.</p><p>The blood-red diagram array bore the brunt of the attack.</p><p>Wherever the cold flames passed, talismanic shadows rapidly vanished, the blood-red light dimming at an alarming rate as the cold flames forcibly tore open a path.</p><p>In this moment, the terrifying pressure brought by the cold flames almost suffocated Yue Fei.</p><p>Yue Fei’s smile distorted, her expression contorting into a terrifying grimace, yet the blood moon on her forehead became even more vibrant.</p><p>Immediately after, a cyan light flickered between her eyes, revealing the illusory form of her Nascent Soul.</p><p>True to her nature, Yue Fei’s Nascent Soul was delicate and adorable, its eyes closed, yet seemingly always carrying a seductive smile, an innate charm emanating from its features.</p><p>The Nascent Soul seemed to be emerging yet not fully emerged.</p><p>On the Nascent Soul's forehead, there was also a blood moon mark.  Lu Laomo’s Underworld Moon Seal controlled the body, Nascent Soul, and divine soul, extremely malicious. Underworld Moon Guards were slaves for life!</p><p>The two blood moons merged.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Yue Fei’s physical body and Nascent Soul opened their eyes simultaneously.</p><p>At the same time, the cold flames pierced through the Blood Diagram Array, rushing towards her!</p><p>The light of the cold flames reflected on Yue Fei's twisted face.</p><p>Yue Fei slightly tilted her head back, offering no resistance at all, yet the blood moon on her forehead became exceptionally radiant.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The instant the blood moon collided with the cold flames,</p><p>Yue Fei suddenly moved. She wasn’t resisting the cold flames, but was actually attacking the Underworld Moon Seal within her body.</p><p>Assaulted from within and without,</p><p>The blood-red light dimmed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Underworld Moon Seal was instantly engulfed by the cold flames.</p><p>With the cold flames so close, Yue Fei's divine soul was nearly frozen stiff.</p><p>In the final moment before death descended, Yue Fei exerted all her strength, gathering the power of the Underworld Moon Guard within her body towards her forehead.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The cold flames surged through.</p><p>Yue Fei's skull exploded, leaving behind a headless corpse. Frozen into an ice block, it tumbled away, eventually torn to shreds by the tide of light, leaving no bones intact.</p><p>Only a shattered Nascent Soul remained, already on the verge of death.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply.</p><p>He sensed something amiss at the last moment and forcefully withdrew some of his power.  Otherwise, Yue Fei’s Nascent Soul, unable to use its instantaneous movement technique in time, would have been annihilated as well.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yue Fei's shattered Nascent Soul, faintly guessing something.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>The shattered Nascent Soul’s aura was weak, yet it still maintained that hint of a seductive smile. “Thank you, Young Master, for using your spiritual treasure to help me escape from the clutches of the devil.”</p><p>“Why go to such lengths?” Qin Sang shook his head, still somewhat puzzled.</p><p>He was anxious to save the person, speaking as he flashed towards the pillar of light.</p><p>“Rather than being refined into a soul-corpse, it’s better to gamble for a chance at survival.”</p><p>The shattered Nascent Soul's aura rapidly faded, murmuring incomprehensible words.</p><p>She was Su Zinan’s Yue Fei, the one with the highest cultivation, the most beautiful appearance, and the most favored among all his concubines.  Other concubines addressed her respectfully as ‘Elder Sister’ upon seeing her.</p><p>But she saw clearly that to Su Zinan, she was merely a plaything.</p><p>She would have readily accepted being a plaything, having grown accustomed to pleasing men.</p><p>With access to Luye’s numerous treasures, she could have anything she desired, treating it as exchanging her body for cultivation resources.</p><p>But Su Zinan was cold and fickle, how could he be devoted to just one woman? However, given his nature, he considered her his forbidden possession. Even if he grew tired of her, he would never let her leave alive.</p><p>The other concubines’ fates were to be thrown into the serpent pit.  The reason Su Zinan kept her alive was because she still had value.</p><p>He was waiting for the Three Corpses Death God Banner to be refined!</p><p>The Underworld Moon Seal was Lu Laomo’s signature divine ability, the most terrifying shackle in the world.  Her life and death were entirely dependent on her master’s whim, leaving her with no power to resist.</p><p>She couldn’t remember how many years she had spent pondering a way to break the seal, only to be met with despair.</p><p>She was confined to Luye, and even when given the opportunity to accompany Su Zinan outside, she was required to stay by his side at all times.</p><p>Until today, someone intruded into the suspected tomb of the Water Phase Master, which Su Zinan coveted.  Elder Wu and the others happened to be absent, and Su Zinan was cultivating in the medicinal pool, giving her a brief window of opportunity.</p><p>The Underworld Moon Seal was extremely malicious.</p><p>Her plan was to gather all the power of the Underworld Moon Seal within her body, and with the help of powerful external pressure, while the Underworld Moon Seal was suppressed, separate a part of her divine soul and seize a new body to be reborn.</p><p>But the timing had to be precise.  The external force couldn’t be too weak or too strong, otherwise, it would result in death and the dissipation of her Dao.</p><p>Even more despairing was the fact that even this couldn’t completely sever the Underworld Moon Seal.  She could only weaken the Underworld Moon mark within her separated soul fragment as much as possible, preventing Su Zinan from directly sensing it, and then slowly scheme for a complete escape later.</p><p>She left a physical body on the snow layer, belonging to a pitiful woman who was originally meant to be thrown into the serpent pit, but whom she secretly saved.</p><p>She herself came down here to die.</p><p>After entering the ice cave, she secretly set up a talismanic array to transfer her soul fragment and actively sought death.</p><p>When Su Zinan finished cultivating and arrived, he would see her lying dead here.</p><p>This way, Su Zinan wouldn't immediately discover her small maneuver, giving her soul fragment time to escape.</p><p>Yue Fei had to act convincingly, leaving no flaws for Su Zinan to detect.</p><p>Although he was the adopted son of a Divine Transformation cultivator, aside from his lustfulness, he wasn’t arrogant in the slightest and possessed a meticulous mind.</p><p>If Su Zinan became suspicious and circulated his profound arts to sense the Underworld Moon Seal, he would perceive the existence of her soul fragment, rendering all her efforts futile, with unimaginable consequences.</p><p>Precisely because of this,</p><p>After entering the ice cave, Yue Fei remained silent, attacking Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan and vying for the Cold Crystal.</p><p>In truth, she had little interest in the Cold Crystal. Her sole purpose was to provoke Elder Yanshan and Qin Sang, forcing them to use their killing moves to assist her in severing her soul.  She deliberately concealed the Underworld Moon Seal to avoid being recognized, fearing they wouldn’t dare to act against her.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang only had eyes for the Cold Crystal, striking once before ignoring her completely, focusing on breaking the formation.</p><p>Elder Yanshan, on the other hand, adopted a defensive stance.</p><p>Su Zinan could arrive at any moment, yet she couldn't die even if she wanted to.</p><p>Yue Fei didn't know that her luck was truly terrible.  Elder Wu happened to return and arrived early, fortunately being intercepted by Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>When the killing formation erupted, although its power was sufficient to shatter the Underworld Moon Seal, the event was too sudden, leaving Yue Fei with no time to prepare.  She could only dodge. Then, she recklessly attacked Qin Sang until she forced him to use his spiritual treasure, finally fulfilling her wish.</p><p>“The old devil is no longer alive, Young Master needn’t be afraid. But that Su Zinan is about to refine the Three Corpses Death God Banner. Young Master should be careful in the future.”</p><p>Yue Fei’s soul fragment had successfully escaped. The shattered Nascent Soul was meant to die, its smile as radiant as a flower.  With her last remaining strength, she looked at Qin Sang. "As a token of gratitude, let me warn you, Young Master. This place is the tomb of the Water Phase Master of the Formless Immortal Sect.  Your companion is the Water Phase inheritor. We’ve had our eyes on him for a long time. He’s not so easily killed. Judging by your appearance, you seem to be unaware..."</p><p>The Four-Winged Azure Serpent Seal hovered overhead.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside the pillar of light. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly operated its divine ability to its fullest extent, but inside the pillar of light, apart from wave after wave of dense light tides, there was nothing, not even a shadow of a person.</p><p>The Primordial Heavy Water on the ground had also evaporated without a trace.</p><p>Hearing Yue Fei’s words, Qin Sang’s expression drastically changed. He turned back, just in time to see her Nascent Soul dissipate, her profound arts fading away.</p><p>Outside the snowfield,</p><p>Hidden within the snow lay an ice coffin.  A beautiful young woman lay quietly inside, her chest rising and falling slightly, her breath still present, not yet dead.</p><p>The ice coffin was engraved with blood-red runes, clearly a unique treasure, possessing the ability to conceal the young woman’s aura.</p><p>Suddenly, a white shadow flew into the ice coffin, plunging into the young woman’s body.</p><p>The young woman's eyes abruptly widened, her breathing becoming rapid.  Deep terror and pain filled her eyes. She wanted to struggle and cry out, but her own right hand clamped over her mouth, preventing her from making a sound.</p><p>The space within the ice coffin was cramped.  She thrashed as if battling an invisible evil spirit, the veins in her swan-like neck bulging, her entire body convulsing. After a few violent struggles, she finally succumbed to exhaustion.</p><p>Her eyes closed weakly, as still as death.</p><p>A moment later, the young woman's eyes opened again, but the look in them was completely different.  The corners of her lips unconsciously curled up, revealing a seductive smile identical to Yue Fei's.</p><p>“What a pity to lose all that cultivation…”</p><p>The young woman sighed silently, her expression, however, one of relief.</p><p>She fumbled in her bosom for an interspatial pouch, retrieving several bottles of pills and swallowing them all at once.  Without getting up, she directly controlled the ice coffin to travel through the snow layer, heading in the opposite direction of Luye.</p><p>At first, she moved slowly and cautiously, but her speed gradually increased.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Revised several times, looked up, it's 3 AM.</p>
