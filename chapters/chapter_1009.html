<h1>Chapter 1001 Transformation</h1><p>“Stabilizing my life essence is only temporary. Even if I don't want to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, when I attempt to break through to the Corpse King realm, I'll still need your help.” Bai said helplessly. He had tried many methods, all in vain, and was at his wit's end with the talisman.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang readily agreed.  Bai’s willingness to stay with him was a good thing. If Bai's Heavenly Corpse Talisman could be undone, there was hope for reviving Ya Gu.</p><p>“The Seven Kills Palace and the Purple Star Palace are connected by an ancient teleportation formation. They might have been one and the same in the past. With the mortal world in such chaos, it’s probably difficult to match it with the ancient cultivation world. Wandering around might not be a bad thing. However, before I leave, I want to travel around the Canglang Sea. Ten years should be enough…” Bai pondered for a moment. “In that case, I won't rush my breakthrough for now. After stabilizing my life essence, I can find a way to conceal my corpse aura. As long as I don't rashly enter major cultivation cities, I shouldn't be easily exposed. You probably have your own things to do. Let's act separately and set a time to meet again.”</p><p>Bai’s proposal was a good one. Qin Sang thought for a moment and nodded. “I made an agreement with Ning Wu Hui to return to the Heavenly Dao Sect ten years from now, just before the Seven Kills Palace appears, to discuss entering the palace. Perhaps you could also return at that time.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The two returned to the cave dwelling and stayed for a few days, during which Qin Sang prepared some protective treasures for Bai. In reality, with Bai's strength, even without the enhancement of the ghost fog, he had few rivals within the Foundation Establishment realm. However, he needed to focus on stabilizing his life essence, which would make him hesitate when facing cultivators of the same rank.  Unless absolutely necessary, he would avoid confrontation.</p><p>Qin Sang renewed the lease on the cave dwelling for another ten years, agreeing to meet with both Bai and Ning Wu Hui there.  He then left the market.</p><p>“Be careful on your journey, Fellow Daoist. Until we meet again!” Qin Sang bid farewell to Bai. He was heading south for his appointment with Yuan Zhu.  Bai's choice was peculiar; he had taken an interest in the rainy and desolate lands of the North Sea and decided to go there first.</p><p>“Until we meet again!” Bai, wearing a large cloak that concealed his entire body, flew towards the North Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Bai depart, then waved his hand, summoning a flying chariot pulled by a Flood Dragon soul, and headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Belt.</p><p>After a long journey, Qin Sang arrived near Yuan Zhu's cave dwelling and activated the scale-shaped restriction.  Before long, a white light illuminated the seabed.</p><p>After a moment of shimmering, a beam of light erupted before Qin Sang.  Yuan Zhu's hearty laughter echoed from within. “Fellow Daoist Ming Yue has finally arrived! Please come in!”</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang’s figure flickered and he entered the beam of light, stepping into the secret realm.</p><p>Yuan Zhu stood in front of his cave dwelling, a smile on his face.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yuan looks well.” Qin Sang said, a thought striking him. He noticed a significant change in Yuan Zhu's aura compared to ten years ago, but he didn't know much about the Yao race and couldn't discern whether this change was good or bad, or what the cause might be.</p><p>Yuan Zhu gestured inwards. “I have Fellow Daoist Ming Yue to thank for that. It's a long story. I've prepared a pot of spirit wine. Please, come in…”</p><p>They sat down in the cave dwelling. Yuan Zhu took out two amber cups and a long-necked jade pot. The liquid inside was surprisingly blue, as if brimming with boundless vitality, making the entire jade pot resemble a flawless piece of jadeite, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>Yuan Zhu tilted the pot, pouring the wine into the cups. A captivating fragrance immediately filled the cave dwelling.</p><p>“Excellent wine!” Qin Sang exclaimed, impressed. This wasn't just ordinary spirit wine; it was more like a spiritual elixir, radiating incredibly potent vital energy.</p><p>“This is spirit wine brewed by the Monkey Clan in the Yao Sea, using various rare spirit fruits.  Drinking it enhances cultivation, even surpassing the spiritual elixirs refined by your human race. It's highly sought after in the Yao Sea. Because the required spirit fruits are extremely precious, the production of this spirit wine is very low, and the Monkey Clan only releases a few pots occasionally. I obtained this pot by chance. Unfortunately, I probably won't have the opportunity to taste it again…” Recalling his exile, Yuan Zhu’s smile faded, and he sighed softly.</p><p>“Please, Fellow Daoist!”</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the cup and swirled the wine gently, intensifying the aroma.  He drank it in one gulp.  The taste was sweet.  However, as soon as the spirit wine reached his throat, a burning sensation arose, like a line of fire entering his belly. The potent energy transformed into pure spiritual power. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he circulated his cultivation technique with all his might, slowly refining the potent energy.</p><p>“Excellent wine!” Qin Sang slowly exhaled, savoring the lingering taste, and couldn’t help but praise it again. Just one sip had noticeably increased his true essence.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you shouldn't have given me such a generous gift. I feel unworthy of receiving it.” Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at Yuan Zhu.  “Fellow Daoist Yuan, just speak your mind. I haven't forgotten our agreement from ten years ago. If you have any requests, I'll do my best to fulfill them.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu clapped his hands and laughed. “How could it be for no reason? Fellow Daoist, you have no idea how much you've helped me. As for the agreement from ten years ago, you don’t need to worry about it.”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in surprise, “What do you mean by that, Fellow Daoist Yuan?”</p><p>“You see, before interrogating the Nine Phoenix King, I had a premonition and had been searching for a way to break this secret technique. Later, I unexpectedly found an ancient restricted and sealed area in the Canglang Sea.  It's not exactly hidden, but it's very unique. It's likely left by a Yao ancestor. Even if your human race were to find it, you wouldn't be able to discover its secrets.  This sealed area is extremely mysterious and dangerous. Before, believing myself to be at a dead end, I planned to wait for the right time and invite you to join me in breaking the seal and exploring it together. Unexpectedly, I found hope in the 'Heavenly Yao Transformation' cultivation technique.  There’s no need to venture into the sealed area, and you don’t need to risk going with me.” Yuan Zhu explained the reason.</p><p>“Cultivating the ‘Heavenly Yao Transformation’ can undo the secret technique on you and restore your true form?” Qin Sang asked with surprise.</p><p>The corners of Yuan Zhu’s mouth curled upwards.  He spoke in a relaxed tone, “Although I can't be entirely certain, there’s great hope.  By cultivating this technique, after breaking the secret technique, I might even have a chance at transformation.  You could say it's a blessing in disguise! The ‘Heavenly Yao Transformation’ has an extraordinary origin. I underestimated it before. In ancient times, this kind of technique was definitely at the level of a core inheritance within top-tier sects. I’ve easily solved my biggest problem, so how could I not thank you properly?”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was greatly surprised. He hadn’t expected this outcome.  It was the best news that Yuan Zhu could resolve his hidden danger.  Qin Sang considered himself a powerful cultivator, but Yuan Zhu was also a top expert. Even he considered the sealed area extremely dangerous, so one could imagine what kind of place it was.  Qin Sang naturally wouldn’t take unnecessary risks.  He didn't inquire further about the sealed area and said with a smile, "You are too kind, Fellow Daoist Yuan. I also relied on your Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn to escape a powerful enemy! Since you are fine, I'm relieved.  I wish you a swift recovery from your predicament."</p>
