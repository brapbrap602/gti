<h1>Chapter 1801: Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal</h1><p>The spirit tool's spirit has perished.</p><p>Hearing Master Gu's sigh, Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly, and he asked, "Can the spirit tool's spirit not be restored even if the treasure is repaired?"</p><p>Master Gu countered with a question, "Does the True Man know the difference between Innate Spirit Treasures, Acquired Spirit Treasures, and True Treasures?"</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully said, "Please enlighten me, Master."</p><p>Master Qi only knew that Spirit Treasures could be further categorized, but he couldn't clearly explain the characteristics of Acquired Spirit Treasures and True Treasures.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was aware of these types of treasures, Master Gu thought that she could save a lot of explanation and directly explained their characteristics.</p><p>"I don't deserve such respect. Most of my knowledge comes from the sect's ancient texts.</p><p>"The biggest difference between Innate Spirit Treasures and Acquired Spirit Treasures lies in their origins, whether they were born with the heavens and earth or crafted afterward.  As for whether their power differs, I do not know.  It is said that Innate Spirit Treasures are naturally formed by the heavens and earth, extremely rare. We artificers can only craft Acquired Spirit Treasures and True Treasures.</p><p>"When cultivators refine a Spirit Treasure to its peak, just before the spirit embryo gives birth to a tool spirit, there are two choices, thus giving rise to Acquired Spirit Treasures and True Treasures.</p><p>"The tool spirit is born, undergoes Heavenly Tribulation, and becomes an Acquired Spirit Treasure.</p><p>"Or, the cultivator can forcibly interrupt the evolution of the spirit embryo, dispersing its sentience and integrating it into the body of the Spirit Treasure, creating a True Treasure.</p><p>"Neither choice is superior; both are a form of transformation.</p><p>"Acquired Spirit Treasures possess tool spirits that can assist their masters or independently utilize the treasure's body against enemies, offering numerous wondrous uses and infinite possibilities.</p><p>"Possessing a tool spirit is like having a trustworthy Dao companion. However, the tool spirit also has the potential to betray its master.</p><p>"Moreover, tool spirits also belong to the myriad beings of the world and must undergo Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>"True Treasures do not need to undergo tribulation.</p><p>"Furthermore, the spirit embryo is born from the essence of the treasure.  Dispersing the spirit embryo and completely integrating it into the body of the treasure concentrates its power, making it purer and more extreme. Unless seized by another, it will never betray its master. This is the greatest advantage of a True Treasure.</p><p>"In many cases, True Treasures are more suitable than Acquired Spirit Treasures.</p><p>"It is said that Sword Cultivators and cultivators with Natal Spirit Treasures often choose to refine their Natal Spirit Treasures into True Treasures to aid their pursuit of the pure and ultimate Dao."</p><p>Hearing these secrets, Qin Sang instantly understood a lot, looking at the broken drum and murmuring, "The tool spirit's death is like the essence of the treasure being scattered..."</p><p>To make an inappropriate analogy:</p><p>Acquired Spirit Treasures can be compared to Dharma Cultivators and Spirit Cultivators. Upon death, their cultivation base is lost, leaving behind only an empty shell.</p><p>True Treasures are like Physical Cultivators, focusing on tempering their physical bodies. Even after death, their bodies remain supreme treasures.</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Master Gu nodded. "The power of a True Treasure resides in its body. Though difficult to repair after being damaged, once restored, it can regain its full strength. Even if it can't be repaired, its fragments still retain a portion of the original power. Acquired Spirit Treasures, however, are different..."</p><p>She paused and looked at the broken drum. "If the tool spirit were still present, even if a sliver of sentience remained, it could slowly nurture and restore itself even without external force. However, if the tool spirit has perished, even if its body is perfectly restored, what remains is merely a shell devoid of spirit."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought, no wonder.</p><p>A fragment of a True Treasure still possesses considerable power.  Melted into the Returning Wind Armor, it could withstand Marquis Li's deadly attack.</p><p>But the broken drum, with only a hole, showed no mystical properties, as if it were a mundane object.</p><p>"Even shells have varying qualities.  If this treasure's body is restored, can it be wielded?  How much of its original power can it recover?" Qin Sang pondered and asked.</p><p>Just like Dharma Cultivators, during their cultivation, their physical bodies are also tempered.  Though not as strong as Physical Cultivators, their bodies are still beyond ordinary.</p><p>Moreover, Acquired Spirit Treasures are crafted from various heavenly and earthly treasures. Even if the tool spirit perishes, the essence of these treasures cannot be completely dispersed, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Master Gu pondered, "There's no fixed answer. The creation of each Acquired Spirit Treasure involves unique circumstances and complex factors. In my opinion, repairing the drum's surface might make it comparable to a Spirit Treasure, or it might only be equivalent to a Pseudo Spirit Treasure.  If this drum was once the Natal Spirit Treasure of a senior, it might only exhibit the power of a Dharma Treasure."</p><p>This explanation coincided with Qin Sang's speculation.</p><p>Repairing an unfamiliar Acquired Spirit Treasure without the cooperation of its tool spirit would undoubtedly be extremely difficult.</p><p>It would not only require exquisite refining skills and a thorough understanding of the treasure but also the collection of various precious spirit materials and repeated experimentation.</p><p>If the final result was only a Dharma Treasure, wouldn't it be a loss?</p><p>"Is there no way to revive the tool spirit?" Qin Sang asked, somewhat unwillingly.</p><p>Master Gu shook her head.  "Even if such a secret technique exists, to revive a withered tree, like creating it anew, would be more difficult than refining a new Acquired Spirit Treasure. It's beyond our capabilities."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly; he knew his idea was somewhat wishful thinking.</p><p>Then he thought of the Chengying Sword in the Thousand Jun Ring. Could this sword also be an Acquired Spirit Treasure whose tool spirit had perished?</p><p>He had originally held high hopes for the broken drum and the Chengying Sword, but unexpectedly, they were less useful than the fragments of a True Treasure.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Master Gu couldn't help but add, "The greatest value of this drum lies in the comprehension of the Dao of Refining during the restoration process. The one who refines it will surely gain immense benefits."</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang with anticipation as she spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly raised his head, understanding the implication of Master Gu's words.</p><p>The allure of an Acquired Spirit Treasure was something no artificer could resist. Master Gu had patiently explained so much to him for the sake of this last sentence.</p><p>She could have easily made up an excuse and exchanged the treasure for a smaller price. He had just entered the Hollow Profound realm and lacked experience, so he might have been deceived.</p><p>This showed that Master Gu's character was not bad, and Master Lingxu's evaluation of her back then was not low.</p><p>Since he couldn't expect much from the broken drum itself, Qin Sang naturally wanted to extract its greatest value.  He pondered, "To be honest with Master, I have also dabbled in the Dao of Refining. Although I cannot compare to Master, I do not lack the desire to improve."</p><p>Master Gu's delicate eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>She thought that exchanging it for a Pseudo Spirit Treasure wouldn't be a disadvantage for Qin Sang. Moreover, he had just entered the Hollow Profound realm and urgently needed to improve his strength, so he should agree.</p><p>Before Master Gu could finish, Qin Sang refused without hesitation, "I happen to have a few treasures for self-defense; more would be unnecessary. I seek nothing else. I wonder if I would be honored to have Master Gu guide me in the Dao of Refining?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang unmoved, Master Gu couldn't help but fall into a dilemma.</p><p>Her true inheritance came from her sect and could not be divulged. If Qin Sang came from a Daoist sect, there might be room for maneuver.</p><p>"It's not that I'm unwilling, but I'm restricted by the sect rules.  The sect's true inheritance cannot be leaked. I can only offer you the refining secrets and texts I've collected over the years, as well as my own insights derived from them, True Man."</p><p>Whether the value of these things was equal to the remnants of an Acquired Spirit Treasure was a matter of perspective.</p><p>Observing Master Gu's expression, Qin Sang confirmed that she wasn't haggling. He pondered and said, "In that case, I have a request. This treasure will be temporarily stored at the True Man's residence. Every so often, I will come to visit, and the True Man must impart to me all the insights you've gained. Moreover, when the time comes to repair this treasure, I must personally do the work, with the True Man providing guidance."</p><p>This condition was actually similar to what he had discussed with Master Qi.</p><p>Master Gu's expression showed surprise. She hadn't expected Qin Sang to be so decisive, daring to leave the remnants of this Acquired Spirit Treasure with her, even though the conditions he proposed would only be fulfilled much later.</p><p>At the same time, Master Gu also realized that Qin Sang's conditions were quite shrewd. Comprehending the remnants of an Acquired Spirit Treasure would inevitably involve the sect's true inheritance.</p><p>But...</p><p>This was the remnants of an Acquired Spirit Treasure!</p><p>She had only heard of them, this was the first time she had seen one.</p><p>The sect's inheritance contained many records of Acquired Spirit Treasures, but later generations were not as capable, and the sect gradually declined.  Now, no one could refine an Acquired Spirit Treasure.</p><p>She had only heard her master mention seeing a tool spirit, said to be a jade-like little girl, at the residence of a Grand True Man.</p><p>Among the Hollow Profound True Men of the Daoist sects, even the Fourth Rank Immortal Officials of the Dao Court at most possessed Spirit Treasures.</p><p>In the end, Master Gu agreed to Qin Sang's conditions, and the two made a sworn oath.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the broken drum towards Master Gu.</p><p>Master Gu placed her jade-like finger on the drum's surface and gently stroked it. After a moment, with a wave of her sleeve, dozens of jade slips covered the table.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked her and stored them all in the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang came to the North Pole Evil Warding Court again.</p><p>The Golden Armored Guards recognized Qin Sang and had already received orders.  They immediately led him to the Ordination Department.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that the Dao Court's Ordination Department was similar in structure to the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions and other large sects, just more magnificent.</p><p>The plaque on the courtyard gate read: White Stone Ordination Altar, not some sect altar.</p><p>It could be seen that the name of the prefecture came from the ordination altar, as the Dharma Seal was the foundation of the Daoist sects.</p><p>The main hall inside was not the Three Yang Hall or the Thunder Ancestor Hall that Qin Sang had seen before, but the Houtu Hall.</p><p>Hanging inside the hall was a statue of Houtu, the Earthly Sovereign!</p><p>Perhaps because Qin Sang wasn't from a Daoist sect, this ordination ritual was simplified, without elaborate formalities.</p><p>Only the three masters—the Transmission Master, the Supervising Master, and the Recommending Master—were present.</p><p>The Recommending Master was True Man Ning Luo. The other two were old Daoists with white hair, their auras as deep as the sea, yet with a lingering air of twilight about them.</p><p>The auspicious time had arrived, and the Transmission Master opened the ordination altar.</p><p>Strangely, it wasn't a golden seal in the altar but a ball of light, its inner radiance constantly shifting, making it impossible to discern its shape.</p><p>Other than that, everything proceeded as usual.</p><p>Opening the altar.</p><p>Transmitting the seal.</p><p>Issuing the decree.</p><p>…</p><p>Everything proceeded step by step. Qin Sang knelt, and when he saw the Dharma Seal split into two—one entering his body and the other burning to ascend and report—he finally let out a long sigh of relief as the dust settled.</p><p>With the ordination ritual concluded, the two masters immediately closed the doors and saw him out.</p><p>True Man Ning Luo handed Qin Sang a copy of the "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Immortal Guide," arranged a time for Qin Sang to collect the texts, and also hurriedly departed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, leaving the North Pole Evil Warding Court and heading straight for his cave dwelling.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The cave dwelling closed, and the restrictions activated.</p><p>Unable to contain his eagerness, Qin Sang immediately sat down cross-legged and summoned the ordination altar.</p><p>The ordination altar was now far more complete than before, having taken the shape of an altar, with the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal slowly rotating within.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was quietly cultivating within the altar.  Responding to Qin Sang's summons, it flew out of the altar, landed on the ground, and curled into a ball.</p><p>The structure of the ordination altar consisted of the Jade Pure Thunder Summoning Talisman and the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summoning Talisman.  Qin Sang had now received the Third Rank Dharma Seal, the Five Thunders Secret Art, and a new divine talisman.</p><p>The divine talisman that carried the Five Thunders Secret Art was called the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman. It was said that this talisman could form the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal, acting as the Heavenly Punisher, with unmatched power and a formidable reputation.</p><p>Of course, what Qin Sang cared about most was the Dharma Seal's ability to stabilize his Qi; the divine talisman was merely a bonus.</p><p>He first took out the new "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Immortal Guide" and briefly scanned it.</p><p>Water Thunder Immortal True, Thunder Commander, Heavenly Thunder Upper Minister, Dragon Thunder Immortal Chancellor, Divine Thunder True Chancellor…</p><p>There were fewer divine beings than in the Second Rank Dharma Seal, and their positions were clearly higher.</p><p>Unfortunately, all the divine beings' names were grayed out.</p><p>After reading, Qin Sang set the "Myriad Gods Thunder Department Immortal Guide" aside and took out some jade slips.</p><p>These were given to him in advance by True Man Ning Luo, containing excerpts of the North Pole Evil Warding Court's collection, including insights left by past cultivators of the Five Thunders Secret Art, which would be helpful for his subsequent comprehension of the talismanic formations.</p><p>Next, he retrieved a jade box from the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Inside the box was a demon core, the demon core of the Thunder Turtle, which he planned to refine to strengthen the altar.</p><p>With everything prepared, Qin Sang took a deep breath, calmed his mind, and immersed himself in the Five Thunders Secret Art.</p><p>An incredibly complex talismanic structure unfolded before him.</p><p>The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman!</p><p>Even with the corresponding texts and the talismanic formation already broken down, comprehending it still consumed a great deal of Qin Sang's mental energy.</p><p>The first dispersed form wasn't actually that difficult.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to strengthen the altar. He first reviewed all the dispersed forms, then consulted the texts, forming a holistic impression of the talismanic formation before taking action.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Thunderlight flickered in Qin Sang's palm, emitting fluctuations similar to the Thunder Turtle's demon core.</p><p>This was the remaining thunder power from refining the Thunder Turtle's demon bone.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, controlling this thunder power and drawing in the void.</p><p>As he moved, a complex and winding talismanic formation emitted dazzling silver light.</p><p>This step went very smoothly; the first dispersed form was completed in one go, flashing and merging into the ordination altar.</p><p>The ordination altar trembled, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal radiating bright light, thunder threads swimming within, a scene of chaos.</p><p>Within the chaos, there was order.</p><p>As Qin Sang's hand seals changed continuously, the altar's trembling lessened, the thunder threads converged, and the light within the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal faded.</p><p>The Third Rank Ordination Altar, complete!</p><p>"Finally done…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't continue, immediately awakening, his eyes revealing excitement, and looked inward at his Qi Sea.</p><p>With a thought, he circulated his cultivation technique.  His dormant Qi Sea finally stirred, and the spiritual energy within the cave dwelling, attracted by it, frantically converged towards Qin Sang, almost forming a vortex around him.</p><p>A continuous stream of spiritual energy poured into his body.</p><p>With the Third Rank Ordination Altar suppressing it, there were no signs of disorder, and his cultivation base quickly recovered, breaking through the boundary of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>His strength returned!</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and tried casting a few Daoist techniques.  The familiar feeling was back.</p><p>A smile appeared on his lips; finally, he could continue cultivating.</p><p>This world was rich in spiritual energy, and his aptitude, after multiple refinements, was no less than that of a Heavenly Spirit Root.  His cultivation would surely advance by leaps and bounds in the future!</p><p>There was no rush now.</p><p>First, strengthen the altar, then cultivate.</p><p>He continued to comprehend the dispersed forms while using thunder power to strengthen the altar, soon exhausting the thunder power from the demon bone.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade box opened, and the Thunder Turtle's demon core flew into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Gently stroking the demon core, Qin Sang sensed the rampant power within, pondered for a moment, and attempted to draw upon the thunder power within.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>The ordination altar gradually became more complete.</p><p>Finally, the agreed upon time arrived, and Qin Sang returned to the North Pole Evil Warding Court.</p><p>True Man Ning Luo had fulfilled his promise, retrieving texts from the Heavenly Hub Institute and the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude profusely.</p><p>Taking the texts, he visited Master Gu once more before leaving the Ordination Altar, feeling a sense of relief wash over him.</p>
