<h1>Chapter 1209: The Decision</h1><p>Chapter 1209: The Decision</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>An ice projectile and a green beam collided head-on.  Ice shards scattered, a massive shockwave sweeping outwards. The ice projectile shattered; the snow bead was instantly retrieved by Hanli. But the green beam still retained its power, hurtling towards the Lu cultivator.  Just as it was about to engulf him, a black gleam slashed through the air – the Serpent King's black blade, a magical weapon.</p><p>At this moment, the black blade's power far surpassed what it showed under the control of the Qieji Demon King.  It successfully shattered the remnants of the green beam. Then, the black light reversed course, momentarily blocking the torrent of attacks launched by the two Cuiyuan cultivators.</p><p>The Serpent King and the others gained precious time, quickly dodging sideways.  The next instant, a long shadow brushed past them – a near miss from the evil spirit's tail.</p><p>Attack after attack, leaving no room for respite.  If it were only the mindless evil spirit, or only the two Cuiyuan Nascent Souls, even with the Lu cultivator injured, it wouldn't be a serious problem. But their current situation was precarious.</p><p>The Serpent King and the other two regretted their rash actions.  They had spent over ten days painstakingly deciphering the ancient restriction along a vine, expending enormous energy and becoming utterly exhausted. Upon successfully opening the great demon's lair and seeing the treasure-filled room, they were naturally ecstatic.</p><p>Even so, they remained vigilant, confirming there was no immediate danger before confidently collecting the treasures.  However, they overlooked one crucial detail: this was not a demon king's lair, but a prison, containing a terrifying evil spirit.</p><p>Caught completely off guard, the Lu cultivator at the front was attacked by the evil spirit, immediately suffering serious injuries and spitting blood.  The Serpent King and Hanli reacted in time, protecting themselves and avoiding a similar fate.</p><p>The three initially planned to work together to take the treasures and leave, but they hadn't anticipated the evil spirit's overwhelming strength and terrifying attack, which attracted the Cuiyuan cultivators, causing them to miss their chance.</p><p>Now, they had no desire to claim the treasures.  They knew that continuing would attract more Cuiyuan Nascent Souls.  The 'lair' was directly below, a deep cavern that had been breached during their earlier fight. They had attempted several times to escape into the cavern, but were stopped each time.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The group instantly engaged in another chaotic melee, the battlefield changing rapidly, a dizzying spectacle.</p><p>Qin Sang observed from a distance.</p><p>After several exchanges, Qin Sang had a general understanding of the situation. He wondered if the Serpent King and the others had noticed: there were not two, but three Cuiyuan Nascent Souls!  On the outer edge of the battlefield, a Cuiyuan Nascent Soul was hidden, concealing their presence and waiting for the opportune moment to strike.</p><p>Unfortunately, it couldn't hide from the Sky-Eye Butterfly.  Jiang Chenzi and the other's confidence in facing the Serpent King with only two of them was directly related to this hidden cultivator; their presence was merely a distraction.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze away from the battlefield, carefully observing his surroundings to confirm there were no others.  He had two choices.</p><p>First, he could ignore it all and leave. This was the Cuiyuan's stronghold, full of unpredictable variables.  More Nascent Souls might be drawn in at any time.  Out of caution, avoiding the conflict was a reasonable option.</p><p>Second, he could intervene, seizing the treasures and rescuing the others.  If he joined forces with the Serpent King and the others, escaping shouldn't be difficult, barring unforeseen circumstances. Jiang Chenzi and the others, including the hidden cultivator, were all only early-stage Nascent Souls. Without the evil spirit, the different factions might even be able to kill one or two.</p><p>The greatest concern was the evil spirit.  However, according to the descriptions in his cultivation technique, the Seven Souls Killing Array should have some effect against this type of spirit body.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that if he intervened and took the treasure from the evil spirit, his chances were high.  However, he could only obtain one of the three treasures at most, and wouldn’t have time to examine its effects.</p><p>He also coveted the blood jade and the broken axe, but he would prioritize the white copper. The white copper's strong allure to the Fire Jade Centipede at least guaranteed that his risked adventure wouldn't be in vain.</p><p>The longer he deliberated, the greater the risk.  Almost instantly, Qin Sang made his decision: he would intervene.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Another earth-shattering collision.  On the battlefield, green beams, serpent shadows, ice, the black blade, and crimson torrents intertwined, a spectacular display of power.</p><p>Qin Sang stealthily approached, still some distance from the battlefield.  The moment the collision occurred, he seamlessly merged with his sword, transforming into a dazzling rainbow that pierced the dark clouds!  His lightning and sword escapes combined, the thunderous roar incessant.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>A cultivator from the Abyss, concealed in the shadows, was intently observing the battle, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.  However, someone else nearby acted first, causing a slight hesitation in his movements.</p><p>On the battlefield, expressions varied widely.</p><p>The Serpent King was the first to recognize Qin Sang, and he was both surprised and delighted.  "Moonlight Demon King!"</p><p>His expression shifted rapidly, countless thoughts flashing through his mind.  He had personally visited the Three-Fold Pass and earnestly invited the Moonlight Demon King to join him in his treasure hunt, making significant promises. The King's sudden appearance in the Abyss, despite his previous refusal, left the Serpent King deeply perplexed.</p><p>If the Moonlight Demon King were present earlier, their situation wouldn't be so dire.</p><p>Initially, the Serpent King suspected that the Moonlight Demon King had been secretly following him, outwardly refusing the invitation while harboring ulterior motives.</p><p>But he reconsidered.  His and his companion Lu's cultivation bases far surpassed the Moonlight Demon King's. Even if the King possessed some concealment technique, it was impossible to track them undetected from the Sky Traverse Plateau all the way to the Abyss.</p><p>He then suspected the Moonlight Demon King might be an Abyss spy.</p><p>But that didn't make sense either. The Moonlight Demon King had publicly slain Elder Pei, a genuine Nascent Soul master. The Abyss losing such a powerful cultivator, only to place a Demon King near Heavenly Demon Hill, was simply absurd.</p><p>Only one possibility remained: the Moonlight Demon King had his own important business and had secretly infiltrated the Abyss.  Sensing the clash, and recognizing them, he intervened to help.</p><p>This made perfect sense. It explained the King's outright refusal.  The Serpent King could only blame his own ill-timed invitation for this unfortunate coincidence.</p><p>It was remarkable how quickly the Serpent King pieced this together.</p><p>Then, he received a confirming telepathic message from Qin Sang, validating his deduction.</p><p>Though Lu and the Frost Lizard hadn't personally met Qin Sang, they had heard the Serpent King speak of him many times. Hearing the Serpent King's exclamation, even without understanding the specifics, they knew their ally had arrived.</p><p>All three were renowned experts. Seeing Qin Sang's spectral form headed towards the treasure within the evil spirit, they guessed his intentions.</p><p>They didn't blame Qin Sang for still aiming to seize the treasure.  Without reward, why would anyone risk their life to save them?</p><p>Qin Sang's direct attack on the serpent spirit relieved them of immense pressure. If they couldn't escape even with this help, they might as well end their own lives.</p><p>Some rejoiced, others despaired.</p><p>A sudden change occurred.  The two Nascent Soul cultivators from the Abyss, initially confident of victory, were now shocked and enraged by this unexpected turn.</p><p>The other Nascent Soul cultivator, abandoning concealment, quickly summoned his magic weapon and appeared from the shadows.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>I managed to go to sleep at midnight today.  Good.  Slowly adjusting.</p>
