<h1>Chapter 1967: Descent into Demonic Cultivation</h1><p>“Chirp… chirp…”</p><p>Xiao Wu looked down at the white fox in her arms.</p><p>She released her aura, and the white fox clearly recognized her.</p><p>It was the same little fox she had raised during her time at the ruins of the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>For fifteen years, Qin Sang had been in secluded cultivation, comprehending the Thunder Altar. Both Zhu Que and Luo Hou were somewhat afraid of her, and on ordinary days, only the small animals released into the mountains by the spirit arrays kept her company.</p><p>Among them, the one who accompanied her the longest and was the most intelligent was this little fox.</p><p>Before parting, Qin Sang had asked if she wanted to take the little fox with her, but Xiao Wu had refused.  She hadn't expected to be reunited under these circumstances.</p><p>The woman and the fox gazed at each other.</p><p>The little fox's eyes were filled with delight, seeming even more spirited than before.</p><p>Xiao Wu extended her hand and gently stroked the little fox's head.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>The little fox cried out, narrowing its eyes, as content and comfortable as ever.</p><p>Mountain winds rustled through the trees.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew, warm sunlight bathed her skin, and the sound of the wind whispered in her ears.</p><p>It was as if she had returned to the old days.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression gradually softened.  Looking around and sensing her surroundings, she realized she had unknowingly flown out of the Yan Kingdom. Below her lay an unfamiliar land.</p><p>Where should she go from here?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xiao Wu had a destination in mind—the Yan Kingdom's capital, the Jade Waist Lake, and the Green Ram Tea House.</p><p>As for the questions in her heart, there were no answers for the moment, but there was no need to be anxious. Perhaps in the days to come, she would find an opportunity to unravel all the mysteries.</p><p>White clouds drifted leisurely.</p><p>Xiao Wu traveled on the clouds, the white fox nestled in her arms.</p><p>From time to time, the fox's cries echoed from the clouds, as if recounting its experiences over the years.</p><p>Upon returning to the Green Ram Tea House, a servant from the Qin Estate, who was waiting there, immediately rushed back to report her arrival.</p><p>Soon after, Yu Lang hurried over.</p><p>Learning the truth, Yu Lang’s last shred of hope vanished.</p><p>Their Master, devoted to the people, had poured his heart and soul into his work. After his death, his spirit might have condensed, allowing him to enter the path of Divinity.</p><p>But on the battlefield, unless immediately guided after death, a fragile soul couldn't withstand the surging bloodlust and baleful energy. It would either be scattered on the spot or corrupted into a vengeful ghost.</p><p>Xiao Wu handed Chen Zhenqing's final letter to Yu Lang.  The eight short characters held Yu Lang's gaze for a long time.  Finally, he carefully put it away, stood up, and said, "Senior Sister, I'll be going now."</p><p>"Alright," Xiao Wu rose to see him off. She sealed both her own and the white fox's cultivation, returning to their mortal forms.</p><p>Stepping out of the tea house, Yu Lang paused, looked towards the Imperial Palace, and said in a low voice, "I will make the Yan Kingdom far stronger than the Great Liang, and defeat them decisively on the battlefield, as an offering to Master!"</p><p>The urgent report reached the capital, shaking the court and the common people.</p><p>At the same time, various factions within the capital began to stir.</p><p>The Great Liang's invasion, with its suspiciously convenient timing, couldn't help but arouse suspicion.</p><p>By now, Yu Lang and the Crown Prince's faction had sensed something amiss. A storm was brewing, and some matters would likely come to a head soon.</p><p>Yu Lang tightened his robes, took a deep breath, and vanished into the darkness.</p><p>……</p><p>From that day on, the patrons of the Green Ram Tea House noticed a lazy white fox that had appeared from nowhere. Sometimes it lay on the proprietress's lap, sometimes on the counter, always by her side. It spent its days dozing, lazily ignoring the customers' attempts to play with it, only offering disdainful glances.</p><p>The customers, however, found endless amusement in this, simply because the fox was so intelligent and endearing.</p><p>However, the patrons soon had no time to pay attention to a fox.</p><p>News of the Great Liang's invasion and the urgent situation at the border reached the capital, causing widespread panic.</p><p>Within a short period, the Yan Kingdom lost eight prefectures of Lu Province. The Great Liang army advanced relentlessly, and the Yan Kingdom's defenders retreated again and again.  Almost all of Lu Province fell, and the surrounding provinces were in constant fear, sending frequent urgent requests for reinforcements. The situation worsened with each passing day.</p><p>……</p><p>"And at this very moment, the Emperor's illness has worsened. He neglects court affairs, and memorials submitted to him vanish without a trace, left unattended."</p><p>Amidst his busy schedule, Yu Lang returned to the tea house.  As before, he confided in Xiao Wu without reservation about the turbulent situation and his plans.</p><p>"The Yan Kingdom faces internal and external troubles. The Crown Prince lacks prestige, the other princes harbor their own ambitions, and the court officials are hesitant, observing from the sidelines.  Within the court, the esteemed officials endlessly debate, delaying crucial decisions!"</p><p>Yu Lang sighed, his voice tinged with exhaustion.</p><p>He was a cultivator, brimming with energy, yet even at the center of the power struggle, he felt a sense of helplessness.</p><p>……</p><p>"Beyond the Great Liang, other nations are also beginning to stir…"</p><p>"Finally, the decision has been made to deploy troops, but unfortunately, I cannot personally lead them east!"</p><p>……</p><p>"We've found a clue. As expected, among the princes, there must be someone colluding with the Great Liang, working from within! They're taking advantage of the Yan Kingdom's internal and external struggles to seize the throne!"</p><p>Yu Lang's tone grew colder.</p><p>"There's been an incident in the Imperial Palace. The Imperial Guard, where Tao Teng serves, was summoned into the palace at night.  We almost didn't receive the message in time."</p><p>……</p><p>One ordinary morning.</p><p>Suddenly, the streets of the capital were filled with soldiers, hurrying back and forth. The clatter of their armor echoed through the streets.</p><p>Ordinary citizens, sensing the impending storm, closed their doors and stayed inside.</p><p>All the undercurrents, hidden beneath the surface, erupted on this day!</p><p>According to rumors afterward, that night, flames engulfed the Imperial Palace, burning throughout the night.</p><p>Fires blazed in various parts of the capital, accompanied by the roar of battle.  Countless residences were burned and razed, and many families vanished overnight.</p><p>The city gates were tightly shut, crossbow units at the ready, aimed outward.</p><p>At some point, a vast army had appeared outside the city, and the armor worn by the soldiers was almost identical to that of the city's defenders.</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>Though citizens of the same Yan Kingdom, they faced each other like sworn enemies.</p><p>……</p><p>The next day.</p><p>At dawn.</p><p>The capital, chaotic throughout the night, returned to an eerie calm.</p><p>Covered in blood, Yu Lang arrived at the Green Ram Tea House.</p><p>Outside the tea house, he removed his armor, jumped into Jade Waist Lake to wash away the blood, changed into ordinary clothes, and transformed back into the elegant scholar he appeared to be.</p><p>Holding the little fox, Xiao Wu descended from the second floor.</p><p>"Did you succeed?"</p><p>"We succeeded!"</p><p>Yu Lang confirmed, his expression not one of excitement, but rather a sense of relief.</p><p>He had descended from the mountains to experience the mortal world, traveling for a year, studying for three, and serving as an official for eleven years after passing the imperial examination. He hadn't dared to relax, carefully planning every step, and finally, this day had arrived!</p><p>He had almost grown accustomed to mortal life, only remembering his true identity and origins when meeting with his Senior Sister.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the Third Prince escaped. We miscalculated slightly. He's the mastermind behind the collusion with the Great Liang. The Second Prince was used without knowing it, a truly pitiful and regrettable situation!"</p><p>Yu Lang took a sip of tea and sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>"The late Emperor was wise and had made preparations beforehand. The Emperor's ascension to the throne was smoother than expected. Because of this, the Third Prince, seeing the unfavorable situation, retreated decisively.  Many of his forces remain hidden, and he certainly won't give up.</p><p>"However, the Emperor's ascension is legitimate, and the hearts of the people are with him. Even if the Third Prince spreads rumors and sows discord, he won't be able to cause too much trouble.  The fear is that he will continue to collude with the Great Liang, plotting treason, and ultimately harming the people.</p><p>"The Yan Kingdom now faces internal and external threats. Tao Teng and I have discussed it and plan to have one of us remain in the capital while the other goes to quell the rebellion."</p><p>……</p><p>"Unacceptable!"</p><p>In the Imperial Study, the new Emperor flatly refused.</p><p>"I know you are both skilled in literary and martial arts, but the battlefield is a dangerous place. You should remain in the court, strategizing!  Suppressing the rebellion and expelling foreign enemies is the task of Duke Yuan and the others."</p><p>As expected, not long after escaping the capital, the Third Prince raised his banner in Ying Province, north of Lu Province and also bordering the Great Liang, proclaiming himself Emperor. He claimed that the "false Emperor" harbored treacherous ambitions, imprisoned the late Emperor, forged the imperial edict, and had illegitimately seized the throne.</p><p>Besides the Third Prince, several other escaped princes also rallied support in various provinces, creating considerable momentum and causing unrest within the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Great Liang army invaded Ying Province but then halted their advance, holding their position. They didn't act like enemies, but rather like they were bolstering the Third Prince's authority.</p><p>After the court session, Tao Teng and Yu Lang were summoned to the Imperial Study again to discuss the suppression of the rebellion.</p><p>Tao Teng stepped forward and said, "A good minister can dismount to become a chancellor and mount to become a general!  The Number One Scholar is a reincarnation of the Wenqu Star, possessing unparalleled prestige among scholars. When the people see the Number One Scholar on the front lines, they will know who is the legitimate ruler and who is the traitorous rebel.  As the saying goes, 'A just cause enjoys abundant support,' and we will surely sweep away the rebels with ease."</p><p>"Your subject is willing to share Your Majesty's burden and contribute what little I can," Yu Lang added.</p><p>The Emperor paced for a few steps and sighed, "Minister Qin, please be careful!  The two of you are the pillars of the nation, my two wings. The loss of either of you would be a great loss to the Yan Kingdom, and to me!"</p><p>With that, the Emperor picked up a roll of silk from his desk and said, "Prefect Chen sacrificed himself for the nation, and I have always kept this in mind. I have decided to posthumously bestow upon him the title of Marquis of Loyalty and Righteousness, a hereditary title. What are your thoughts?"</p><p>The two were overjoyed. "Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p>……</p><p>Within the command tent.</p><p>Clad in armor, Yu Lang sat upright and steady as a mountain, reviewing the confidential reports and letters before him.</p><p>Several men stood below him, all strong, capable, and intelligent.</p><p>One of them said indignantly, "The letter urging surrender has been delivered into the city, only to be burned on the spot by the rebel commander, who dared to openly insult us! This person stubbornly resists, ignorant of the impending doom. When shall we attack the city, General? Please give us your orders!"</p><p>Listening to his subordinate's report, a flicker of doubt crossed Yu Lang's eyes.</p><p>He hadn't gone directly to Ying Province. The Emperor had ordered him to quell the rebellion elsewhere.</p><p>Unlike Ying Province, which had the support of the Great Liang, the other areas only had conscripted local troops and hastily assembled young men, lacking proper weapons and armor.</p><p>He led the Imperial Guard, and wherever they went, they should have swept through the enemy like autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, with enemy commanders surrendering at their approach.</p><p>The reality, however, was vastly different from what he had imagined.</p><p>He personally led one army to attack Youyang Prefecture ahead, while two other deputy generals each led another army.  The three armies advanced simultaneously, yet all encountered fierce resistance.</p><p>Rebelling was a heinous crime!</p><p>Surrendering now would mean a pardon, yet the defenders of all three cities fought with a death-defying spirit.</p><p>The princes they followed had no chance against the Imperial Guard unless the Third Prince led reinforcements from Ying Province.  Otherwise, defeat was inevitable.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck Yu Lang.</p><p>An ordinary person might not have thought of it, but he was a cultivator who had descended to experience the mortal world.  Encountered with such a clearly illogical situation, he couldn't help but think deeper.</p><p>What power could make the rebels so fearless of death?</p><p>He thought of Tao Teng and himself.</p><p>If the City God of the Yan Kingdom's capital could allow them to enter the mortal world, could he have let in other cultivators, disguised as mortals like them?  At the time, Yu Lang had felt that the City God had been too casual.</p><p>With the jade pendant gifted by the City God, unless they willingly revealed themselves, even Brother Shi couldn't tell whether they were cultivators or mortals.</p><p>During the struggle for the throne, Yu Lang hadn't noticed any soldiers who were obviously cultivators.</p><p>Presumably, within the capital city, under the City God's watchful eye, no one dared to act rashly.</p><p>Away from the capital, mortal methods weren't working, and finally, someone couldn't restrain themselves any longer.  Were they simply sowing chaos?</p><p>Yu Lang frowned.  Unfortunately, his Senior Sister had sealed her cultivation, and Brother Shi claimed to have encountered a bottleneck and had to enter secluded cultivation for a while.</p><p>Otherwise, if someone among the rebels revealed their cultivator identity, a single investigation would uncover the truth.</p><p>"Reporting, General, confidential report from Ying Province. The pseudo-Emperor's influence has suddenly weakened, and he has chosen to defend the city. The Great Liang army within our Yan Kingdom's borders has also become hesitant. Not only has the Great Liang not sent reinforcements, but it seems they are secretly withdrawing troops, as if something has happened within their own country…"</p><p>Another confidential letter arrived.</p><p>Yu Lang gazed at the letter on the table.</p><p>This was within his expectations.</p><p>The ruler of the Great Liang was even older than the late Emperor of the Yan Kingdom, and it was time for him to meet his end, inevitably leading to a struggle for the throne.</p><p>The Emperor of the Yan Kingdom was planning to use the same tactics against them.</p><p>Yu Lang had previously lamented that the Great Liang ruler was cunning and had acted preemptively, sending an army to disrupt the Yan Kingdom so the Great Liang could focus on resolving its internal strife, preventing the Yan Kingdom from taking advantage of their vulnerability.</p><p>The sudden thought made Yu Lang ponder more and more, until finally, he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Was this struggle for succession, affecting both nations, truly as simple as it appeared on the surface?</p><p>How many cultivators were secretly involved, and what were their goals?  Were they like him and Tao Teng, seeking to fulfill their ambitions, or were they merely playing games in the mortal world, or did they have other motives?</p><p>What were the goals of the Yan Kingdom's ghosts and gods?</p><p>And Tao Teng's master, whom he had never had the chance to visit, what was his background?</p><p>Yu Lang felt inexplicably anxious, rising from his seat and pacing back and forth within the tent.</p><p>It was as if an invisible hand was clutching him, Tao Teng, the Emperor, the officials, the common people, the entire Yan Kingdom in its grasp!</p><p>Yu Lang subconsciously opened his mouth.</p><p>There always seemed to be a dark cloud in the sky, like the canopy of the command tent, pressing down, lower and lower, suffocating him.</p><p>That dark cloud was the cultivation world!</p><p>……</p><p>The mortal world was in turmoil.</p><p>The cultivation world was also restless.</p><p>In the southwest of the Yan Kingdom, the mountains were treacherous and the ravines deep.</p><p>Within the deep mountain forests, mist swirled, like white clouds enveloping the peaks, stretching endlessly. It didn't disperse until noon each day, only to gather again in the afternoon.</p><p>Amidst the mist, several figures flew unhurriedly.</p><p>Beneath their feet was a bamboo leaf-shaped magical treasure, emitting a faint green light that enveloped them, preventing even the slightest ripple of energy from leaking out as they flew.</p><p>Despite the protection of the magical treasure, they flew very low, almost skimming the treetops.</p><p>Standing at the front of the magical treasure, controlling it, was Yin Heqian, the Patriarch of the Yin Clan.</p><p>Those behind him were also Yin Clan experts. Yin Qiao'er's cultivation was insufficient, so she hadn't come this time, but her aunt, Nian Hui, was among them.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>I was a bit out of it these past few days.  I suddenly woke up this morning and quickly scrambled to write this.</p>
