<h1>Chapter 1993: Radiant Gold City</h1><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He wondered why Venerable Yue was so interested in a witch tribe's alchemical formula. Could it be that she cultivated a witch tribe inheritance?</p><p>“This formula was passed down to this humble Daoist by an elder long ago,” Qin Sang replied, quietly observing Venerable Yue.</p><p>“Where is that elder now…?”</p><p>Venerable Yue pressed, her eyes dimming slightly when Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang offered no further explanation, instead asking, “Does this formula have some connection to Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Venerable Yue quickly composed herself, returning to normal. She sighed softly, “If you insist on a connection, then there is one. Daoist Priest should be able to see that the inheritance contained within this formula is quite unique.  Within the Dao of Alchemy, the combination of spirit herbs reflects the interpretation of the Dao. Different sects and inheritances form different schools of thought.  Furthermore, the refining methods in this formula differ from those of our human race.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is speaking of the witch tribe, right?” Qin Sang directly stated.</p><p>“Daoist Priest is indeed aware of the witch tribe!”</p><p>Venerable Yue was not surprised. “I won't hide it from Daoist Priest. When I first embarked on the path of cultivation, my master didn't understand alchemy. The reason I walked this path was due to a chance encounter with an ancient text in a senior's legacy cave. This ancient text recorded an alchemical inheritance of the witch tribe. It was then that I learned that besides our human race and the demon race, there also existed a witch tribe, and that some legends might be true.”</p><p>Listening to Venerable Yue's words, Qin Sang calmly inquired, “What legends?”</p><p>“Legend has it that the witch tribe was once the overlord of the Great Thousand World. Later, with the rise of the human race, the witch tribe was driven to the Savage Lands by human sages and has since declined. Even our overseas lands bear traces left by the witch tribe, so it seems there's some truth to it.”</p><p>Venerable Yue explained.</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Without waiting for Qin Sang to respond, Venerable Yue continued, “Unfortunately, there was only that one ancient text. I've searched for many years, but haven't found any other witch tribe ruins. Perhaps they've been erased by time, or perhaps they were brought here from elsewhere.</p><p>“One ancient text wasn't enough to sustain my journey to this point.  Fortunately, I obtained some human alchemy manuals and joined my current sect. But my heart has always been captivated by the witch tribe's alchemy.</p><p>“It's not only related to the sentiment that led me onto this path, but also because different inheritances can verify each other, greatly aiding my own improvement.</p><p>“Therefore, upon seeing the Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid formula, I was overjoyed. I thought another witch tribe ruin had emerged and couldn't wait to meet the owner of the formula.”</p><p>Having only met Qin Sang once, Venerable Yue had revealed her cultivation journey, clearly with an ulterior motive.</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang with expectant eyes. Since it was a gift from a senior, there should be more than just one formula, right?</p><p>Qin Sang saw through her thoughts like a blazing fire.</p><p>He did indeed have more formulas.</p><p>The *Panhu True Scripture* was a complete inheritance, containing various alchemical formulas to aid in nurturing natal Gu insects.</p><p>At least up to the fifth transformation of the spirit insects, the content was extremely detailed and rich.  However, most either lacked the required spirit herbs, required peculiar refining methods, or even required witch tribe bloodline, making them difficult to refine. Qin Sang could only select a limited few.</p><p>After the spirit insect broke through to the sixth transformation, equivalent to the Void Refinement stage for cultivators, the content drastically decreased, with only a few formulas remaining, and their refining difficulty was undoubtedly extremely high.</p><p>Upon reaching the seventh transformation, there were no clear alchemical formulas.</p><p>However, the fundamental method of the *Panhu True Scripture*, the *Spirit Nurturing Method*, was not restricted by realm. Ghost Mother had said that this method was a true inheritance of the witch tribe. As long as the master's cultivation was high enough, they could continue to use the *Spirit Nurturing Method* to nurture their natal Gu insect, just lacking the supplementary alchemical formulas.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. It wasn't necessarily that Ghost Mother was holding back.  A seventh transformation spirit insect was equivalent to a human Body Integration cultivator, an extremely rare existence. The difficulty in nurturing one was immense.</p><p>Moreover, the races of spirit insects were countless. The higher the realm, the greater the differences brought about by their cultivation experience, divine abilities, and race, creating vast chasms.  It was nearly impossible to summarize a universally applicable spirit herb.</p><p>At this realm, the spirit insect and its master must explore together, seeking the Great Dao.</p><p>Of course, given the opportunity, Qin Sang would definitely visit Ghost Mother to see how Firefly and Fat Silkworm were doing.</p><p>Ghost Mother had also promised him to help find a way to cultivate the Celestial Eye Butterfly into a seventh transformation Void Butterfly.</p><p>Back then, it seemed unattainable, and Qin Sang didn't take it to heart. Who would have thought he would reach this stage, where it was no longer a pipe dream?</p><p>“Has Fellow Daoist ever considered leaving this place to search for witch tribe inheritances elsewhere?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Sunken Jade Sea, Extreme Heaven Peak… I’ve been to them all,” Venerable Yue shook her head gently, clearly without any gains.</p><p>“What about the Great Zhou Dynasty?” Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>Venerable Yue's expression shifted slightly.  She said, “North of Extreme Heaven Peak, the sea becomes increasingly dangerous.  Not only are there demons roaming, but also unknown yet extremely dangerous creatures, and mysterious sea regions concealing strange phenomena.  If one encounters them, even a Void Refinement cultivator could perish with the slightest carelessness.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood why the further north one went, the more vague and unreliable the cartographic records became.</p><p>Between this region and the Great Zhou's Gen Province, there existed so many dangers. For those below Void Refinement, it was an insurmountable chasm, and even Void Refinement cultivators wouldn't easily risk it.</p><p>“Sea charts recording safe paths are all in the hands of top powers. They also pay a hefty price to explore these routes and treat them as precious treasures, rarely showing them to others.  Moreover, the path ahead is uncertain.  We bear the heavy responsibilities of our sects, the rise and fall resting on our shoulders. How can we dare to travel far?  We can only hope that our disciples will mature quickly so that we can finally unload this burden and roam the Great Thousand World.”</p><p>Venerable Yue sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang empathized with Venerable Yue’s sentiments.</p><p>He had established the Green Ram Temple three times, trying his best to be a hands-off leader. Every time he left, he would do everything in his power to pave the way for the Green Ram Temple, making proper arrangements and guarding against various threats before he could rest assured.</p><p>Let alone others.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators cultivated for thousands of years, entangled in countless karmic ties. These karmic ties were their bonds.</p><p>Among them, the grace of one’s master was the heaviest.</p><p>Having received the grace of their sect, they had to bear its karma.  Above, they carried the high hopes of their master, and below, they had disciples relying on them.  Bound by affection and duty, the inheritance continued in an orderly fashion. Unless one was inherently cold and indifferent, how could they remain unmoved?</p><p>However, Qin Sang keenly sensed another meaning in Venerable Yue’s words. He inquired, “From Fellow Daoist’s words, is there a way to traverse the vast sea and safely reach the Great Zhou Dynasty?”</p><p>Being fellow humans, the Great Zhou Dynasty definitely had contact with this place.  There might even be a Great Teleportation Formation, which the Clear Sky Sect most likely knew about.</p><p>Qin Sang originally planned to use the Clear Sky Sect as a breakthrough point and had been considering what he could use to sway them.</p><p>A few days ago, under Old Man Gu Yun's recommendation, Qin Sang personally visited Elder Yi of the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>It was their first meeting, and their relationship was still shallow, so they didn't discuss much.</p><p>Being too eager might arouse the Clear Sky Sect's suspicion. If they discovered the altar formation, it would be difficult to explain.</p><p>Venerable Yue’s beautiful eyes darted across Qin Sang’s face.  After hesitating for a moment, she nodded. “The Dao of Alchemy is arduous, and alchemists are easily targeted. Top alchemists from various regions maintain private connections with each other.  To my knowledge, a fellow Daoist has acquainted themselves with a power in the Great Zhou's Gen Province. That power is incredibly capable, able to traverse the vast sea. Occasionally, they bring rare and precious spirit herbs from the Great Zhou to this place…  That power seems to be called Radiant Gold City.”</p><p>Radiant Gold City!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Among the several powers that Qing Yuan had mentioned that dealt in passage, Radiant Gold City was one of them.</p><p>Moreover, Qing Yuan had emphasized Radiant Gold City, saying it had the largest influence in Gen Province and was the most widely known, and crucially, it had a good reputation.</p><p>It could be said that as long as he found a Radiant Gold City steward, Gen Province wouldn't be far away.</p><p>Radiant Gold City had indeed extended its reach here, yet remained very low-key and unknown. He didn’t know if it was due to some kind of suppression or some other reason.</p><p>Since she mentioned Radiant Gold City, Venerable Yue should be trustworthy.</p><p>If he could contact Radiant Gold City through Venerable Yue, he wouldn’t have to painstakingly try to persuade the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>Radiant Gold City, the capital of Gen Province, Jade Capital Mountain…  If things went smoothly, he could reach the human race’s sacred land through this route and experience the splendor of the Great Thousand World’s human race.</p><p>It just so happened that he had what Venerable Yue wanted. They could each get what they needed…</p><p>Qin Sang said, “To be frank, although this humble Daoist's cultivation is lacking, I have the desire to travel the Great Thousand World.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Venerable Yue pondered, then nodded. “I can contact that fellow Daoist, but I can't guarantee they will agree.”</p><p>Now that she knew Qin Sang's request, Venerable Yue started to play hard to get.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind. He smiled faintly, “The senior who helped this humble Daoist cultivate a certain divine ability left this formula. In addition, there are several other alchemical formulas that complement the Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid. I can take them out for us to study together.”</p><p>“Is that true?”</p><p>“Absolutely true!”</p><p>Venerable Yue was also impatient. She immediately stood up. “I'll contact that fellow Daoist right away. However, I can't guarantee absolute safety on the journey, and there's also the matter of Radiant Gold City's compensation…”</p><p>“This humble Daoist will take care of it!  Regardless of life or death, it has nothing to do with Fellow Daoist!” Qin Sang declared resolutely.</p><p>“Good!  As soon as there’s news, I’ll immediately inform Daoist Priest and deliver the Azure Origin Frost Essence Divine Liquid as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang escorted Venerable Yue out of the Treasure Garden.  “After the Dharma Assembly, Fellow Daoist can find me at Cloud Metropolis.”</p><p>Venerable Yue nodded, about to turn and leave, but then remembered something.  She pinched her fingers and calculated.  “It likely won’t be in time for this trip. The next time Radiant Gold City comes, it will probably be several decades later.”</p><p>Several decades for a round trip?</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment. He needed time for his breakthrough and refining, so he said, “A hundred years is but a flick of a finger. Waiting is no problem.”</p><p>…</p><p>After interacting with Venerable Yue, Qin Sang wasn’t as focused on the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>Of course, he still maintained the necessary courtesies.</p><p>During the subsequent Dharma Assembly, Qin Sang acquainted himself with several Void Refinement cultivators, including Elder Yi of the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>Among them were Grand Elder Liao Chengzi of Eternal Fortress Mountain and Elder Fang of the Clear Sky Sect's Elephant Transformation Hall.</p><p>Discussing the Dao of Refining with them brought Qin Sang considerable gains, gradually clarifying his plans for treasures like the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>The Clear Sky Dharma Assembly gradually drew to a close.</p><p>The last month was the main event of the Dharma Assembly. Whether or not they could obtain the Small Cave Heaven depended on this.</p><p>Despite its formidable strength, the Clear Sky Sect wasn't without the drawbacks of a large power.  Internal factions were rampant, and Old Man Gu Yun was constantly busy, forming alliances and maneuvering between them.</p><p>Through Sect Master Yu, they finally gathered some information about the Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>This Small Cave Heaven was a fragmented Small Thousand World. There were no inhabitants within the Small Cave Heaven, but it produced spirit resources.</p><p>After discovering this Small Cave Heaven, the Clear Sky Sect didn't completely plunder it, preserving some of its value.</p><p>Among all the rewards, the Small Cave Heaven was the most eye-catching. While the other rewards were also valuable, none compared to the Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>There was one piece of news in their favor.</p><p>So far, there had been no news of any other power obtaining the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.  Their chances of success were high.</p><p>As the Dharma Assembly neared its end…</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating in the Brown Peak Treasure Garden, sketching the spirit vein diagram of the Bright Mountain Armor in his mind, waiting for news from Old Man Gu Yun.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt his cave dwelling being triggered. He saw a transmission talisman trapped by the restriction and drew it into his palm. Old Devil Zhen’s voice came from within.</p><p>Old Devil Zhen had returned, but didn't enter the city.  He actually invited him to meet outside the city.</p><p>Qin Sang found it strange. After some thought, he first sent a message to Old Man Gu Yun to inform him before leaving the city. On a barren mountain north of the Clear Sky Sect, he saw Old Devil Zhen sitting cross-legged on a rock.</p><p>Qin Sang looked Old Devil Zhen up and down, a strange glint flashing in his eyes. "Fellow Daoist is injured?"</p><p>No wonder he arranged to meet outside the city. Old Devil Zhen likely didn't want others to know of his weakened state.</p><p>"Daoist Priest won't go back on his word, will he?"</p><p>Old Devil Zhen’s voice was hoarse.</p><p>The Thousand Jun Ring flashed, and Qin Sang immediately took out a jade disc.</p><p>This jade disc was half black and half white, ancient and dignified, inscribed with the *Life and Death Reversal Wheel* secret art.  Its appearance was identical to the one used when performing the Life and Death Reversal Wheel.</p><p>The essence of this jade disc was difficult to replicate.</p><p>Seeing the jade disc, Old Devil Zhen's eyes flashed with bright light.  He exclaimed, "Zhen has luckily fulfilled his promise!"</p><p>Saying so, he raised his hand and took out a jade slip, gesturing for Qin Sang to inspect it with his divine sense.</p><p>As his divine sense touched the jade slip, Qin Sang immediately saw half of a scripture.  The text flowed into his mind, profoundly mysterious.  It was the wondrous formation of the Star Dao—the Celestial River Reverse Slaughter Formation!</p><p>The other half was concealed by Old Devil Zhen.</p><p>“What a profound formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang praised.</p><p>"Hehe, this formation can even serve as a sect-protecting formation. Daoist Priest definitely won't lose out," Old Devil Zhen stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>He was injured and not Qin Sang’s match, but he wouldn't allow himself to be manipulated.</p><p>If Qin Sang had any malicious intentions and they fought, it would attract Clear Sky Sect experts.</p><p>"Here!"</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending the jade disc shooting towards Old Devil Zhen.</p><p>Old Devil Zhen caught it and said, "Straightforward!" He then threw the jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>Confirming it was the complete Celestial River Reverse Slaughter Formation, Qin Sang was overjoyed. He expressed his gratitude and was about to return to the city when Old Devil Zhen called out to him.</p><p>"Hold on, Daoist Priest!"</p><p>As he spoke, Old Devil Zhen took out several artifacts from his mustard seed spatial tool.  The artifacts were broken and fragmented, yet they emitted a starlight-like brilliance.</p><p>“What are these?”</p><p>Qin Sang was drawn to the artifacts.</p><p>"These are broken formation artifacts.  If Daoist Priest refines the Celestial River Reverse Slaughter Formation based on them, it will definitely be twice the result with half the effort! This should be enough to offset the value of the Soul Extinguishing Lamp, right?" Old Devil Zhen said.</p><p>A broken formation and a spirit treasure lacking the Treasure Revelation Formula seemed evenly matched.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Not enough!"</p><p>Old Devil Zhen frowned deeply. This trip had cost him dearly, and factoring in the medicinal pills he would need for his recovery later, it could be said he had risked everything for this secret art.</p><p>"However," Qin Sang's tone changed as he took out the Soul Extinguishing Lamp and tossed it to Old Devil Zhen.  "Fellow Daoist Zhen kept his promise, and this humble Daoist is not one to push others too far.  If my Green Ram Temple disciples offend you while traveling in the future, I hope Fellow Daoist Zhen will be lenient."</p><p>Old Devil Zhen was taken aback. His lips moved slightly. "This old man dislikes being overly polite, but I do hold some weight in the Demonic Path.  Anyone who dares to harm Daoist Priest's disciples without cause, Myriad Luo Island will not stand for it!"</p>
