<h1>Chapter 2022: True Face</h1><p>The mysterious mighty figures' duel at Jade Gate Pass weighed heavily on everyone's hearts like a massive stone, creating an invisible sense of urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if one of them might be Tian Yue Shangren, but after waiting for a long time, no news arrived. Tian Yue Shangren remained completely silent, perhaps truly encountering an unexpected event.</p><p>But could this unexpected event at this juncture signify an unknown shift in the situation within the Bountiful Jade Wasteland?  Would it impact the upcoming sword retrieval plan?</p><p>Qin Sang had no way of knowing and could only continue to meticulously arrange his escape routes.</p><p>Soon, it was time for their next meeting. They had shortened the interval to three months. Frequent meetings in the vast Bountiful Jade Wasteland would waste much time traveling back and forth, but the drastic change in the situation necessitated this.</p><p>Among the three escape routes, one was discovered through records provided by the Xin family cultivators.  Perhaps the Xin family could bring back valuable clues, so Qin Sang personally met with them every time.</p><p>Before the appointed day arrived, Qin Sang took Gu Ya and flew towards the edge of the Bountiful Jade Wasteland.</p><p>After the great battle at Jade Gate Pass, Qin Sang had kept Gu Ya, Zhu Que, and the other demons by his side. Now, he was preparing to send Gu Ya out of the Bountiful Jade Wasteland.</p><p>They quickly reached an exit, faintly seeing the boundless yellow sand outside. Qin Sang employed the Thunder Escape technique, transforming into a bolt of lightning and vanishing into the sand, flying towards the vicinity of Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>Upon entering the city, he found it much more desolate than when he first arrived, becoming a deserted city. The City Lord remained unseen, and chaos was rampant.</p><p>Almost all the major merchant guilds had closed their doors, and even some sects and clans had relocated entirely. Qin Sang arrived at the Five Elements Alliance's residence only to find they had withdrawn all their personnel, leaving only a talisman within the formation explaining the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Did these powers have such little faith in the upcoming situation? Had something else unknown happened?</p><p>"This is a token I purchased earlier while concealing my identity. Crush it, and the Beast Taming斋 will send someone to meet you. Have them escort you to Silver City to settle down and await my news."</p><p>Qin Sang altered his appearance, took out a jade talisman engraved with a spiritual eagle and crushed it. He then took out several talismans and handed them to Gu Ya.  "These are Thunder Talismans I personally crafted. With these protecting you, few Nascent Soul cultivators can threaten you, ensuring your peaceful cultivation."</p><p>"Senior, aren't you coming with me? Can I stay and help you?"  Gu Ya felt a deep unease, seeing Qin Sang's actions as if he were giving his last words.</p><p>Having finally encountered a senior who ascended from the lower realms, was something unexpected about to happen again?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "This is just a precaution. Undercurrents are stirring in the Bountiful Jade Wasteland. If danger arises, I might not be able to protect you. Wait patiently in Silver City. Even if something does happen in the Bountiful Jade Wasteland, I will entrust someone to find you."</p><p>"But..."</p><p>Gu Ya opened her mouth to speak, but seeing Qin Sang's resolve, she dared not say more, silently accepting the Thunder Talismans.</p><p>After waiting for some time, the people from the Beast Taming斋 arrived.</p><p>"Business has been booming for the Beast Taming斋 recently, hasn't it?" Qin Sang asked, looking at the cultivator who introduced himself as a steward of the Beast Taming斋.</p><p>The steward beamed, smiling. "Our establishment has some influence throughout Dui Province. Even those great powers and sects hire our people as guides.  We've transferred all the nearby personnel here and are still somewhat shorthanded..."</p><p>Chaos was an opportunity for the Beast Taming斋 to make a fortune.</p><p>"Jade Gate Pass is in such disarray, with everyone fleeing. Is it truly caused by the mighty figures' duel outside the city?" Qin Sang inquired further.</p><p>"This... This junior is weak and of low standing, unaware of the details. But from my observation, most people are simply going with the flow. Those who remain in the city desire stability. Those who dare to take risks have already entered the Bountiful Jade Wasteland. The duel between the mighty figures has stirred fear in people's hearts. Leaving the city to avoid the situation is only natural," the steward said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  With the city in such chaos and no one stepping forward to take charge, the powerful figures of Jade Gate Pass had likely all entered the Bountiful Jade Wasteland.</p><p>"She is my junior. Ensure her safe arrival in Silver City," Qin Sang instructed, gesturing for Gu Ya to go with the steward.</p><p>The steward bowed in response. "Rest assured, Senior. Our establishment will not fail in its duty.  There is another group of fellow Daoists heading to Silver City.  They can travel together.  Please, Fellow Daoist Gu."</p><p>...</p><p>After sending Gu Ya off, Qin Sang returned to the Bountiful Jade Wasteland and met with the Xin family.</p><p>Upon seeing the Xin family members, Qin Sang immediately sensed a different atmosphere.  The faces of several Xin family cultivators were beaming with joy, the previous tension swept away.</p><p>Even Fellow Cultivator Pei's expression had softened, no longer so gloomy, but his gaze turned cold when he saw Qin Sang.</p><p>"Found it?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards Xin Shaozhu.</p><p>He didn't need to guess. There was only one possibility that could turn the Xin family's sorrow into joy.</p><p>Steward Luo flew forward, saying repeatedly, "Reporting to Elder Qin, Xin Kui's talisman fire has shown a change, but we can't be entirely certain.  The Young Master needs to personally confirm it."</p><p>"After nearly eight years of searching, you've finally found it.  Not an easy feat. It seems you've all been waiting for this old man. In that case, let's depart."</p><p>Qin Sang flashed onto the Luan chariot and sat cross-legged behind the jade table.</p><p>The Luan chariot trembled slightly, leaving a meteor-like trail in the void, its aura gradually converging as it sped forward silently.</p><p>Various illusory scenes of divine abilities flashed past. Qin Sang gazed at them for a moment before turning to the quiet chamber. "Just what do you need this old man to refine?  Can Xin Shaozhu tell me now?"</p><p>Xin Shaozhu, behind the curtain, bowed slightly. "Once the location is confirmed, we'll find it quickly. We'll inform Elder Qin then. Please be patient, Elder Qin."</p><p>Fellow Cultivator Pei chuckled. "Does Elder Qin lack even this much patience? This Pei has been kept in the dark by their secrecy for many years."</p><p>His words sounded both like a mockery of Qin Sang and a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Xin Shaozhu's behavior was indeed very odd.</p><p>Xin Shaozhu was certainly not foolish. Inviting him to balance against Fellow Cultivator Pei was possible, but Qin Sang didn't quite believe Xin Shaozhu would dare to act against both of them simultaneously.</p><p>Were Void Refinement cultivators so easily tricked?  Moreover, scheming against two at once, wasn't he afraid of playing with fire?</p><p>However, Fellow Cultivator Pei didn't seem like a magnanimous person.  To tolerate the Xin family for so long, either the Xin family had means he feared or there were immense benefits behind it that made him willing to endure.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang didn't want to wade into these murky waters, he habitually analyzed these people's words and actions, just in case.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, silence returned to the Luan chariot. After some travel, they finally found the remaining Xin family cultivators.</p><p>"Greetings, Young Master!"</p><p>The Xin family cultivators stepped forward to pay their respects.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator named Xin Kui stepped out, pointing to a cluster of multicolored light.  "Please look, Young Master. It was near there that the talisman fire showed a slight change. We finally determined the source of the anomaly came from within that strange light.  Unsure of any dangers within, we dared not act rashly. We await the Young Master's decision."</p><p>Xin Shaozhu hummed in acknowledgement and took out a yellow talisman, maneuvering the Luan chariot towards the strange light.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A crimson flame flickered behind the curtain, gradually revealing a touch of green.</p><p>Everyone watched the curtain nervously.  Xin Shaozhu let out a long breath, a hint of excitement in his voice. "This is the place!"</p><p>These words were met with cheers.</p><p>"Elder Qin, Senior Pei, please wait here. This junior will bring the other Xin family cultivators over. Uncle Luo, you stay here and lead Xin Kui and the others to scout ahead..."</p><p>Xin Shaozhu acted decisively, making all the necessary arrangements and piloting the Luan chariot through the void.</p><p>Steward Luo coordinated, deploying the Xin family cultivators into several teams.  They formed battle formations, brandishing their respective magical treasures, cautiously entering the strange light, advancing and retreating strategically.</p><p>Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei had nothing to do and no intention of intervening, standing aside and watching the Xin family cultivators operate.</p><p>"These strange lights don't seem very dangerous.  Why doesn't Elder Qin lend a hand, lest we waste too much time here?" Fellow Cultivator Pei transmitted his voice.</p><p>"This Qin is an outsider. If anyone should act, it should be Fellow Cultivator Pei, shouldn't it?  Moreover, this Qin only agreed to refine tools for Xin Shaozhu. Other matters have nothing to do with this Qin," Qin Sang replied indifferently, unmoved.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Fellow Cultivator Pei said meaningfully, "Once Fellow Daoist Qin sees the Xin family's secret, I wonder if you can remain as indifferent as you are now?"</p><p>"Oh?  This Qin is curious. I wonder what secret is worth such effort from the Xin family.  It seems Fellow Cultivator Pei is quite aware. Could it be a vast treasure?  If there's Earth Jade Rosy Vine, this Qin certainly wouldn't be able to resist and would have to ask Xin Shaozhu for a section," Qin Sang looked at Fellow Cultivator Pei with interest.</p><p>"This Pei is merely speculating!  As Elder Qin has just witnessed, this Xin family Young Master is quite tight-lipped."</p><p>Fellow Cultivator Pei's eyes flickered as he chuckled evasively.</p><p>He was suspicious.  Could this Elder Qin truly know nothing, simply invited here to refine tools?</p><p>Qin Sang could guess some of Fellow Cultivator Pei's suspicions but didn't say anything. This was the situation Xin Shaozhu deliberately created. Fellow Cultivator Pei already viewed him as a rival. Explanations were useless in such circumstances. Seeing was believing.</p><p>As they gradually went deeper into the strange light, Xin Shaozhu brought back the others.  With everyone assembled, they took turns clearing the path in formation, their speed increasing somewhat.</p><p>At first, it was just scattered patches of strange light, interwoven and multicolored. As they went deeper, the light gradually solidified, the colors becoming purer.</p><p>Beams of light, large and small, could be seen radiating from within, dense and numerous. Some were harmless, others concealed danger, interconnected and delicate.</p><p>Continuing forward for some distance, Qin Sang seemed to sense something, his expression shifting slightly as he glanced at Fellow Cultivator Pei, who appeared calm and collected.</p><p>At the same time, a commotion suddenly erupted ahead.</p><p>At the forefront of the battle formation, the Nascent Soul cultivator named Xin Kui was clearing the path.  He wore a jade crown that scattered tassel-like light, offering protection and repeatedly helping him avert danger.</p><p>Just now, Xin Kui used the jade crown to dispel several strange lights. Without any warning, a spray of blood bloomed from his left shoulder, a bloody hole appearing.</p><p>Something had pierced his shoulder, leaving only a void. Everyone was startled. Before they could react, Xin Kui's abdomen was pierced again.</p><p>"Invisible light! Retreat quickly!" Xin Shaozhu shouted.</p><p>Xin Kui didn't hesitate, retreating immediately.</p><p>Two Core Formation cultivators near him also suffered the same fate. One was unfortunately pierced through a vital point.</p><p>Despite Xin Kui's cultivation level, two small wounds caused him to break out in a cold sweat, enduring unimaginable pain. The one pierced through a vital point shuddered violently, his aura rapidly fading.</p><p>Steward Luo flashed over, taking out a jade bottle and stuffing all the pills inside into the cultivator's mouth. "Quickly circulate your Qi!"</p><p>The cultivator mustered his remaining strength, entering meditation. His expression still twitched occasionally, but he managed to cling to life.</p><p>"Hiss! Such mysterious and violent power!"</p><p>Xin Kui forced out the residual power from his wounds, his heart filled with lingering fear.</p><p>The Xin family members stopped, discussing for a while before continuing. However, after traveling a short distance, more people were seriously injured, even with Steward Luo's timely treatment.</p><p>The danger came invisibly, mixed among the multicolored lights, making it impossible to guard against.  At this rate, before they reached their destination, the Xin family cultivators would all be lost within this realm of light.</p><p>Faced with this situation, Xin Shaozhu had to make a decision.  He said gravely, "All Core Formation cultivators, retreat!"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Hesitation flashed in Steward Luo's eyes as he involuntarily looked behind him.</p><p>At the rear of the group, Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei were quite in sync, one on the left and one on the right, leisurely following and waiting for them to clear the path.</p><p>Steward Luo believed that if either of them intervened, the current difficulties would be easily resolved.  But neither showed any intention of doing so, watching as the Xin family fell into crisis.</p><p>For this expedition, the Xin family had specially refined a formation diagram.  When activated by the Xin family cultivators working together, channeling their family's cultivation method, it could unleash several powerful attacks. While it couldn't kill Void Refinement cultivators, it was their confidence in facing Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei.</p><p>The formation was vast, and these Core Formation cultivators were indispensable.  Once they retreated, the reduction in manpower would be equivalent to losing a trump card before even reaching their goal.</p><p>Once deployed, the formation diagram couldn't be retrieved, and as an offensive formation, it couldn't be used here.</p><p>He wondered if these two had seen through something, intentionally weakening the Xin family's strength.</p><p>Before the strong, the weak were powerless, sometimes without the strong needing to do anything.</p><p>Steward Luo opened his mouth, his heart full of helplessness.  "You all go wait outside. Don't let your guard down."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Core Formation cultivators retreated, leaving only the Xin family's Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Next, even Nascent Soul cultivators began to get injured. Xin Kui, with his severe injuries, was also forced to retreat for healing.</p><p>The remaining Xin family members dwindled, their expressions grave, the earlier excitement gone.</p><p>Qin Sang had been silently observing the strange lights. Suddenly, the Luan chariot ahead stopped.</p><p>Along the way, the Luan chariot had shrunk repeatedly, now only a small quiet chamber remained.  It seemed to have reached its limit.</p><p>A jade hand lifted the curtain, and Xin Shaozhu slowly stepped out.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Xin Shaozhu's true face for the first time, looking over curiously. Xin Shaozhu had a delicate figure, like a young maiden.  She wore a half-mask, the exposed skin as smooth as fine jade.  Her eyes were like pools of autumn water, her气质 and appearance clearly superior.</p><p>Fellow Cultivator Pei's gaze fixed slightly upon seeing Xin Shaozhu, his expression remaining unchanged.</p>
