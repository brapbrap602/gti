<h1>Chapter 1903: Cave Abode</h1><p>Fan Rugui, carrying the pill formula and spirit herbs, hurriedly departed.</p><p>This grand hall was the cave abode arranged for him by Cloud Peak Mountain, and until the Pure Blossom Pill was refined, no spirit stones would be collected.</p><p>Outside the hall, servant girls were also present, ready to attend to his every command.</p><p>Not long after Fan Rugui left, Qin Sang also departed the grand hall, dismissing his attendants and strolling through the city alone.</p><p>The Dao of Alchemy flourished in Cloud Cauldron City, giving rise to a bustling trade that permeated the city.</p><p>Many cultivators, having obtained treasures, journeyed tirelessly to Cloud Cauldron City to sell them.</p><p>Therefore, within the city, there were not only places to trade pills but also a diverse array of shops, stalls, and auction houses, categorized meticulously and organized systematically. Among them was a place specifically for trading cave abodes, known as the Blessed Abode Emporium.</p><p>Learning of such a place in Cloud Cauldron City piqued Qin Sang's interest, and he made his way towards the Blessed Abode Emporium.</p><p>With the Pure Blossom Pill secured, it was time to consider his own cave abode.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had a general understanding of the Cloud Capital Mountain cultivation world, and as he interacted with more local cultivators, he realized there was no news of other ascended individuals.</p><p>If this place was the exit of the River of Misfortune, the place of ascension, it was impossible for there to be no trace whatsoever.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that the ferryman of the River of Misfortune randomly transported people into the Grand Empyrean, without a specific location.</p><p>Waiting here for Liu Li and the others to ascend and reunite was impossible.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't intend to leave.</p><p>He had just entered the Grand Empyrean, and the whereabouts of his old friends who had 'ascended' before him remained unknown.  The search for the Sword Pavilion and the hilt of the Earth Slaughter Sword also yielded no clues.</p><p>The Grand Empyrean world was teeming with powerful cultivators.</p><p>At least until he established himself in the Void Refinement stage and possessed the strength to contend with other Void Refinement cultivators, he would postpone his travels.</p><p>Since that was the case, cultivating anywhere was the same.</p><p>The First Sword Attendant hadn't set a time limit for him, such as requiring him to accomplish specific tasks or achieve certain milestones within a given timeframe.</p><p>The battles between Grand Ascension powerhouses were too far removed from him, and Qin Sang decided not to be affected by these karmic ties, continuing to act according to his own habits and thoughts.</p><p>Since he decided to stay in Cloud Capital Mountain, he couldn't ignore the thoughts of the Cloud Capital Heaven Sect.</p><p>As the saying goes: How can one allow others to sleep soundly beside their bed?</p><p>When Cloud Capital Heaven Sect discovered a hidden Void Refinement cultivator nearby, they would surely become restless and would inevitably investigate Qin Sang's intentions.</p><p>If Cloud Capital Heaven Sect had a Body Integration Grand Ancestor presiding over them, Qin Sang didn't want a Body Integration cultivator paying him a visit.</p><p>Even if the Cloud Capital Heaven Sect's ancestor was only at the Void Refinement stage, it would still lead to repeated probes and schemes, preventing Qin Sang from cultivating peacefully.</p><p>Qin Sang also considered whether he should formally visit Cloud Capital Heaven Sect and seek a position as a guest elder, which shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>However, he knew deeply that no matter the place, conflicts of interest were inevitable.</p><p>Cloud Capital Heaven Sect could dominate Cloud Capital Mountain, but looking beyond the mountain, in the wider world, there were certainly sects and rivals capable of contending with them, and even greater powers that could force Cloud Capital Heaven Sect to submit.</p><p>Once drawn into this vast web, there would always be times when he would be forced to act against his will.</p><p>Stepping into the vortex and becoming entangled in karmic ties, how could one easily extricate oneself?</p><p>For the time being, he was only temporarily settling here, having no requests of Cloud Capital Heaven Sect, so there was no need to seek trouble.</p><p>"It's best to stay far away from Cloud Capital Heaven Sect, and perhaps even avoid Cloud Capital Mountain altogether…"</p><p>Pondering this, Qin Sang felt that the chaotic Western Desolate Mountains might be more suitable for his secluded cultivation.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang had already arrived in front of the Blessed Abode Emporium.  A magnificent archway came into view, bearing the three gilded characters 'Blessed Abode Emporium.'</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, gazing at the golden characters. After entering the Grand Empyrean world, he noticed that the language and script here differed from the Talisman World and the Storm World, but their shared origin was evident.</p><p>The Talisman World was a realm separated from the Grand Empyrean by the Heavenly Court, sealing itself off.  But from where did the Storm World inherit its traditions?</p><p>It couldn't be that all Small Thousand Worlds spontaneously developed the same language and script as the Grand Empyrean World!</p><p>Behind the archway were several cloud pavilions, seemingly constructed from white clouds, exquisitely crafted and refined. Qin Sang chose the outermost cloud pavilion and stepped inside, immediately greeted by a charming servant girl.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose, and the servant girl's smile brightened, leading him gracefully into another, evidently more opulent cloud pavilion, where they met a green-robed elder.</p><p>"Steward Lu, this Immortal Qingfeng wishes to purchase a Nascent Soul level cave abode," the servant girl bowed and reported.</p><p>The Blessed Abode Emporium categorized cave abodes by cultivation realm, making it clear and straightforward.</p><p>Steward Lu also greeted him with a smile. "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, if you seek a cave abode, you've come to the right place! Thanks to the trust of many fellow Daoists in Cloud Capital Mountain, our Emporium not only possesses its own cave abodes and Daoist grounds, but also manages those entrusted to us by others, accumulated over many years and too numerous to count. We can satisfy any of your needs! You won't find such a complete selection anywhere else!"</p><p>It sounded no different from a mortal real estate agency.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu speaks with great confidence, but this poor Daoist prefers to believe what he sees," Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>Steward Lu wasn't offended, and with a smile, he produced a golden booklet.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the booklet and silently admired the Blessed Abode Emporium's well-deserved reputation.  The jade slip within not only contained detailed information about each cave abode, but upon extending his divine sense, he could also see clear recordings, giving him a comprehensive view.</p><p>These cave abodes were mostly located within Cloud Capital Mountain, with some having their exact locations concealed, marked only with approximate regions.</p><p>Qin Sang examined them one by one, his expression unchanged.</p><p>Observing his reaction, Steward Lu said, "Fellow Daoist, there's no need for concern. These cave abodes are absolutely safe, and during the transaction, you can request a city official to act as a witness. Even if you don't trust us, you should trust the City Lord's authority in Cloud Capital Mountain. Moreover, with Cloud Capital Heaven Sect overseeing everything, which reckless individual would dare to cause trouble in Cloud Capital Mountain?"</p><p>"Are there any better cave abodes than these?"</p><p>Qin Sang closed the golden booklet and asked.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Steward Lu hesitated. "I believe Fellow Daoist can certainly afford the price, but the better the cave abode, the more complex the implications.  It can't be seen as a simple transaction... Of course, if Fellow Daoist has a sufficiently powerful background, these concerns can be ignored."</p><p>Before Qin Sang could reply, Steward Lu added, "Our Emporium also has cave abodes of indeterminate grade, but these require the buyer's discerning eye."</p><p>"Are you referring to those cave abodes deep within Cloud Capital Mountain? Are those outside the mountain also subject to such stringent requirements?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered.</p><p>Steward Lu was taken aback. "Indeed, there are fellow Daoists outside Cloud Capital Mountain who have entrusted us with their abodes, but our Emporium cannot verify their authenticity, and Cloud Cauldron City's influence doesn't extend that far. We only act as intermediaries and are not responsible for anything else. Fellow Daoist, please consider this carefully."</p><p>With that, Steward Lu produced another golden booklet.</p><p>The contents within were indeed as Steward Lu had described.</p><p>Among them were also what Qin Sang sought—cave abodes located in the Western Desolate Mountains, a place the Blessed Abode Emporium referred to as the Twilightfall Mountain Range.</p><p>Each description was incredibly enticing, painting pictures of top-tier Daoist grounds. However, cultivators weren't fools, and many of these had remained unsold for hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p>How much truth was there in these descriptions, and how many were merely bait?</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about his own safety, but he also didn't want to waste his time.  Even if he were to take the bait, he wouldn't gain anything worthwhile, which was truly uninteresting.</p><p>Those that seemed more reliable failed to meet Qin Sang's requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to choose a few from those cave abodes whose grades couldn't be determined due to various reasons, and personally investigate them.</p><p>Some of these cave abodes concealed hidden mechanisms, while others held dangers that their previous owners, lacking sufficient strength, dared not explore further.</p><p>Truth and falsehood were intertwined, relying entirely on one's discernment.</p><p>With Qin Sang's experience, it wouldn't be difficult to uncover some intriguing information.</p><p>Just then, Steward Lu's expression shifted slightly as he recalled something.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, if you're looking for this type of cave abode, there happens to be one recently available. Its owner is currently in the city."</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang looked up. "Tell me more."</p><p>"Speaking of which, this young man is quite peculiar.  He's only at the Qi Refining stage, yet claims to have information about a cave abode, at least at the Nascent Soul level! He demands that the buyer exchange various precious treasures, but he himself refuses to reveal anything concrete.  Fortunately, he's in Cloud Cauldron City; otherwise, he would have been exploited long ago... If Fellow Daoist is interested, I'll summon him here."</p><p>Steward Lu shook his head as he spoke, clearly not optimistic about the young man.</p><p>"Qi Refining stage? Then it must be ancestral fortune. Since I have nothing else to do, please trouble Fellow Daoist to bring this person here," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Steward Lu repeatedly said it was no trouble and excused himself to give the order.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the quiet room, browsing the golden booklet.</p><p>A quarter of an hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed two auras approaching the quiet room. One was Steward Lu, the other was only at the Qi Refining stage, their breath hurried and seemingly very nervous.</p><p>Soon, a knock came at the door, and Steward Lu ushered the young man in, then quietly retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang put down the golden booklet and looked the young man over.</p><p>The young man appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years old, with delicate features and a melancholic air about him.  A gloomy aura emanated from him.</p><p>The young man didn't dare sit, his hands clasped tightly within his sleeves, standing there awkwardly.</p><p>"Is, is it Senior who wishes to purchase my cave abode?"</p><p>The young man was so eager that he forgot to bow and introduce himself.</p><p>"That depends on whether your cave abode meets this poor Daoist's requirements, and what you desire in exchange, whether it's worth the price."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was unhurried. He gestured to the opposite seat. "Sit and tell me."</p><p>The young man shook his head, urgently saying, "Senior, rest assured, this junior absolutely hasn't exaggerated anything. That cave abode is at least Nascent Soul level!"</p><p>"Have you seen it with your own eyes?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The young man froze, stammering, "This junior, this junior hasn't seen it, but I would never dare deceive Senior…"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "You're merely at the Qi Refining stage, yet without personally witnessing it, you dare make such assertions?"</p><p>"My father told me. My father was at the late Gold Core stage before he passed, and he would never lie to me! He discovered that spirit vein and believed a cave abode could be established there, but there were dangers nearby.  When he returned home to prepare, he met with an accident..."</p><p>Speaking of this, the young man's expression suddenly dimmed, a flicker of hatred flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The change in the young man's demeanor didn't escape Qin Sang's notice.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press further, instead asking, "I heard you possess a token?"</p><p>A wary look appeared on the young man's face. "As long as Senior meets my requirements, I will present the token.  My father said that with the token, one can find the cave abode."</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, the young man cautiously revealed some information about the spirit vein.</p><p>"It's actually there."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred.</p><p>That spirit vein was located between Cloud Capital Mountain and the Twilightfall Mountain Range, essentially north of Smokewater Temple.</p><p>North of the Chen Kingdom, passing through some mortal kingdoms, the land also gradually became desolate.</p><p>It wasn't as chaotic as the Twilightfall Mountain Range, but it was a place where even cultivators were reluctant to stay for long. It was said that earth fire veins crisscrossed the area, and their power was violent, prone to eruptions, resulting in chaotic primal qi and scorching heat.</p><p>Compared to the cultivation paradise of Cloud Capital Mountain, it was a world of difference.</p><p>Like those mortal kingdoms, suitable cultivation locations were scarce and had long been occupied.</p><p>According to the young man, not only was that spirit vein rich in spiritual qi, but the surrounding earth fire veins were unusually calm, making it a rare treasure. However, powerful fire spirits roamed the area.</p><p>Could such an environment aid the Vermillion Bird's 'growth'?</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this matter before and pondered, "Tell me, what do you want?"</p><p>The discernment of a late Gold Core cultivator could still be trusted. Furthermore, even before approaching, one could sense the abundant spiritual qi. Perhaps there was more to it than met the eye.</p><p>"A Purple Origin Pill, a piece of Washing Ripple Stone, and a top-grade water-attribute magical treasure!"</p><p>The young man blurted out.</p><p>His hands clenched even tighter.</p><p>Previously, upon hearing his conditions, Steward Lu had repeatedly shaken his head, and as expected, no one had shown interest afterwards.</p><p>While the cave abode was good, the price was too high, and one would also have to personally deal with the fire spirits. Even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't be willing to be taken advantage of.</p><p>"What kind of pill is a Purple Origin Pill?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>The young man was stunned, giving Qin Sang a strange look.  Not even knowing what a Purple Origin Pill was, was this person truly the powerful cultivator Steward Lu had spoken of?</p><p>"A Purple Origin Pill can assist Gold Core cultivators in breaking through to Nascent Soul," the young man explained blankly.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. "You're already coveting the Nascent Soul stage at this point.  With the Foundation Establishment and Gold Core stages standing between you and it, aren't you afraid of being too ambitious?"</p><p>He couldn't help but recall his own excitement back then, upon learning that the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid could be refined into Nascent Soul pills.</p><p>This young man's ambition was even greater than his own had been.</p><p>"This junior has confidence in breaking through these two stages on my own. I must become a Nascent Soul cultivator!"</p><p>The young man said solemnly, the hatred in his eyes deepening.</p><p>Although he didn't know the full story, Qin Sang could guess some of it.</p><p>He took out a token given to him by Fan Rugui and infused it with true essence.</p><p>Not long after, the guard commander who had escorted him into the city hurriedly entered the Blessed Abode Emporium.  Without even glancing at the young man, he came before Qin Sang and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed him a pouch of spirit stones.  "Are these enough to exchange for a Purple Origin Pill?"</p><p>The young man finally saw hope, his face flushing red with excitement.</p><p>The guard commander glanced at the young man. "Reporting to Daoist Priest, it's more than enough. I'll go fetch the pill now."</p><p>With that, the guard commander quickly departed.</p><p>"Alright, with the Cloud Cauldron City guards and Steward Lu as witnesses, you can now trust this poor Daoist, can't you?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the young man.</p><p>Steward Lu stood at the door of the quiet room and said sternly, "Young man, know when to stop. You won't have such a good opportunity again. I'll give you one last reminder: it's best not to play any tricks. Otherwise, even without Daoist Priest personally taking action, even if you escape Cloud Cauldron City, I can still find you!"</p><p>The young man shuddered. With his cultivation level, being able to argue his case and persist until now in front of Steward Lu and Qin Sang was already quite remarkable.</p><p>"Please wait a moment, Senior. I'll go fetch the token right away."</p><p>Rushing out of the Blessed Abode Emporium, the young man took a deep breath, pumped his fists, and ran towards a certain part of the city.</p><p>The guard commander quickly returned, followed by the young man, who hurriedly rushed into the quiet room and handed the token in his hand to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was a square stone, fiery red like jade.</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his hand and sensed it briefly, his heart stirring.</p>
