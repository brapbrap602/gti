<h1>Chapter 933: Myriad Ghost Claws</h1><p>“I didn't expect that when we met again, you would not only be able to see my true form, but your power would also have increased several times over.”</p><p>The shadowy figure was forced back, flickering slightly before revealing its form.</p><p>The face, once so familiar to Qin Sang, revealed his identity: the missing Flying Night Devil.</p><p>However, a strange voice, hoarse and low, emanated from its mouth.  Each word seemed to be uttered with great effort, as if it hadn't spoken in a very long time.</p><p>Previously, the Flying Night Devil lacked independent consciousness, its expression blank. It only obeyed its master's commands, each action accompanied by bloodshed and carnage.</p><p>Now, it was different.</p><p>Although corpse energy still emanated from him, clearly marking him as a refined corpse, his expression was far more animated than before.  His black eyes moved slightly, fixing Qin Sang with a strange gaze.</p><p>It looked like a living person.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted. He knew this ghost must have developed sentience, but he didn't expect it to be so high, almost indistinguishable from a normal person.</p><p>Was it always like this, or had the ghost merged with the remnants of the Flying Night Devil's memories?</p><p>What shocked Qin Sang even more was that, before being taken over, the Flying Night Devil's cultivation was only equivalent to an early Core Formation cultivator.  The power displayed in their brief clash was actually no weaker than his own!</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang questioned coldly, but his actions didn't hesitate. He summoned the Ebony Sword, flicking his fingers gently.</p><p>The Ebony Sword spun rapidly in the air, erupting with countless sword energies and lights that transformed into a bright, shining sword wheel, instantly annihilating the swirling bone dust.</p><p>The descending sword wheel, covering all directions, suppressed the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>He would show no mercy to the ghost that had seized the Flying Night Devil. He decided to eliminate it quickly, lest it gain time to prepare and cause further complications.</p><p>A look of confusion appeared on the Flying Night Devil's face. It murmured, “Yes… who am I…? I can’t remember! My previous name… seems to have had the character 'Bai' in it… Why don’t you just call me Bai."</p><p>As it responded to Qin Sang, the sword wheel bloomed like an exotic flower, its brilliance reaching its peak.</p><p>Bai's eyes showed no fear. It looked up slightly at the sword wheel and extended its ghost hand forward. Seemingly slow, yet incredibly fast, it suddenly transformed into countless ghostly claw shadows.</p><p>In an instant, the bone dust between them was swept away, and the space divided in two.</p><p>One half was the majestic, unstoppable sword wheel.</p><p>The other half was shrouded in darkness, filled with corpse energy, the outline of the ghost claws almost invisible, yet it seemed as though the sky was filled with them, their momentum no less impressive than the sword wheel.</p><p>“My flesh and bones have rotted, ground into dust at some unknown point… My memories, like my Nascent Soul, have withered and decayed, leaving only this lone soul, trapped in this world… Lost, persistent… clinging to a nearly impossible obsession. Perhaps, in another thousand, ten thousand years, my soul will also completely dissipate. I must thank you for delivering this body to me, allowing me to finally see a glimmer of hope.”</p><p>Bai seemed to have become more accustomed to speaking.  His speech quickened, his words clearer and more fluent.  He seemed to enjoy speaking, seemingly conversing with Qin Sang, yet also like he was talking to himself.  The content was cryptic, making it difficult to understand.</p><p>The ghost hand stirred the wind and clouds, multiplying into thousands, confronting the sword wheel with overwhelming force.</p><p>The sword energies within the sword wheel were born and extinguished, torn apart by the ghost claws, while some ghost claws were shattered by the sword energies.</p><p>However, the true sword light emanating from the sword wheel remained unaffected by the ghost claws. Instead, it grew even more radiant, supporting the framework of the sword wheel, incredibly sharp, shredding the claw shadows.</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed continuously.</p><p>In an instant, thirty percent of the myriad claw shadows were shattered by the sword wheel. Seeing this, Bai let out a cold哼from his throat.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, the claw shadows retracted inwards, merging into Bai's arm.</p><p>At the same time, the corpse energy receded, revealing his arm, black as dark iron.  As his fingers moved, his knuckles emitted a metallic clang, as if they were truly forged from iron and stone.</p><p>The sword wheel was about to close in.</p><p>Bai's eyes shifted. His palm opened and closed, then suddenly struck towards the center of the sword wheel. A giant ghost claw shadow easily tore through the sword energies and reached into the sword wheel.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The power of this ghost claw shadow far exceeded the previous illusions. Not only was it not cut by the sword wheel, it stirred within, causing the sword wheel to momentarily stall, showing signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He formed hand seals, causing the sword wheel to explode. Dazzling sword light transformed into a thick beam of light, repelling the ghost claw and piercing towards Bai's true body with astonishing speed.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai's gaze sharpened, and he retreated rapidly.  However, he was still not as fast as the light beam, ultimately being engulfed by it.</p><p>The light beam carried the power of the sword wheel, its residual force continuing for a considerable distance before dissipating. Several bone mountains behind Bai were pierced through by the light beam, leaving a row of large holes.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>As the light beam dispersed, an unexpected scene appeared.</p><p>Bai was completely unharmed.  His arm remained raised, blocking the front. Corpse energy surged from his palm, forming a solid barrier that had forcibly resisted the Ebony Sword itself.</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled, its sword light flickering. Unable to penetrate the corpse energy, Qin Sang could only retract the Ebony Sword, his gaze towards Bai filled with a newfound gravity.</p><p>This time, they had truly clashed, and neither had suffered a loss. However, it seemed equally difficult to defeat the other.</p><p>"Your strength is not bad, but it's not enough to suppress me,"</p><p>Bai said indifferently.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly.  With a flap of his wings, the Celestial Corpse Coffin flew out from his back.  It rapidly transformed in mid-air. With a series of cracking sounds, the coffin lid turned into pieces of armor, tightly adhering to the Avatar's body, forming a suit of armor.</p><p>The next moment, the Avatar's eyelids twitched, and its eyes opened, blood-red, with a hint of madness and bloodlust deep within its pupils, a terrifying sight to behold.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang stared directly into the Avatar's eyes, secretly activating a secret technique, forcibly suppressing the Avatar's rebellious demonic thoughts.</p><p>The blood-red color in the Avatar's eyes gradually faded, and it stood silently behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the Avatar's aura, a strange glint flashed in Bai's black eyes, his expression turning serious.  "Your methods truly are endless.  You even have an external avatar with strength no less than your own."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang took a deep look at Bai. It had actually discerned the Avatar's identity at a glance.</p><p>“What about with him?”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly and commanded the Avatar to attack.</p><p>He and his Avatar, one on the left and one on the right, charged towards Bai together.</p><p>Qin Sang once again urged the Ebony Sword, creating a sword wheel even more powerful than before.</p><p>The Avatar was not to be outdone, clad in armor and wielding the Blood Sword.</p><p>This Blood Sword, unexpectedly, was a perfect match for the Avatar.</p><p>When Qin Sang helped the Avatar refine the Blood Sword, he carefully examined it and found no hidden marks left by others.</p><p>He had also learned the origin of the Blood Sword during the soul search. It was something the young man surnamed Fang had obtained by chance, not a reward from the Black Serpent Mountain Ancestor, so he left it to the Avatar as a weapon.</p><p>The Avatar's cultivation had reached the peak of Core Formation, but only with a top-tier magical treasure could it truly display its full strength.</p>
