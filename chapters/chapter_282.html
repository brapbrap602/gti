<h1>Chapter 275: An Invitation from Senior Brother Yu</h1><p>An untouched herb garden, even if it doesn't hold any spirit
    herbs that can mend foundations, might still have other good things. It's worth a look.</p><p>Qin Sang's horde of
    Devil Corpses was completely destroyed, leaving only a few zombies.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang
    decided to focus on nurturing the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, hoping to restore it before his
    departure.</p><p>Firstly, the corpses of Foundation Establishment cultivators weren't easy to come by. His previous
    attempts at "fishing" for them had only been successful once in a long while. Secondly, from a survival perspective,
    the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman was far more valuable than the Devil Corpses.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't yet
    determine the talisman's true power, but he guessed that after its restoration, activating it would allow him to
    move at speeds comparable to a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>In many dangerous situations,
    this would give him the ability to react calmly.</p><p>Holding the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang
    communicated with the Flood Dragon spirit within. He learned that its soul had been severely injured by the golden
    bell and further weakened by resisting the lava. It would take considerable time to recover.</p><p>The talisman's
    restoration would also accelerate the spirit's recovery.</p><p>Now that the Flood Dragon spirit had submitted to Qin
    Sang, he didn't fear any backlash after its full recovery. Furthermore, the spirit wasn't a true Flood Dragon, but
    more akin to a tool spirit. Its primary function was to activate the talisman's speed and it lacked the power to
    assist in combat.</p><p>Having gained a deeper understanding of the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman through
    communication with its spirit, Qin Sang returned it to his dantian and channeled his spiritual power to envelop
    it.</p><p>As strands of spiritual energy flowed into the talisman, it radiated a brilliant light. The faint roar of
    a Flood Dragon echoed as the two halves of the talisman drew together, the gap between them shimmering with a milky
    white light.</p><p>Clearly sensing the accelerated recovery of the talisman, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. He
    paused and shifted his attention to the bone fragment.</p><p>Mastering the *Void Imprint* and the *Soul Snatching
    Curse* was essential. In addition, the *Demonic Sounds of the Heavens* contained several useful spells which Qin
    Sang intended to cultivate as well.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his divine sense into the bone fragment, his eyes closed
    tightly, and the cave fell silent.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, divine light
    flashing within. He shouted in a low voice, "Condense!"</p><p>Before him, an illusory square seal materialized. The
    seal bore no inscription but was covered in mystical runes. Following Qin Sang's thoughts, the seal shrank
    dramatically and flew into the center of his forehead.</p><p>Within his soul space, the jade Buddha emitted a yellow
    light, and the Heart-Devouring Insect lay dormant just outside its glow.</p><p>The Void Imprint arrived and
    precisely enveloped the insect, sealing it. The insect's aura was suppressed to a minimum.</p><p>This persistent
    worry could finally be partially resolved.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a great weight lift from his chest, his body feeling
    lighter. A smile appeared on his face as he diligently mastered the *Soul Snatching Curse* and other spells. He then
    continued to nurture the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman while awaiting Yun Youzi's arrival.</p><p>Time
    passed quickly in cultivation, and a year soon went by.</p><p>The cave's restrictions were suddenly triggered.</p>
<p>Qin Sang emerged from his meditative state. The talisman rotated slowly within his qi sea, the crack down its middle
    now a barely perceptible line. The Flood Dragon spirit had also recovered significantly, no longer as weak as
    before.</p><p>The talisman could now be used, albeit cautiously, offering speeds comparable to a mid-stage
    Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>However, it was still fragile and required careful handling.</p><p>Lost
    in thought, Qin Sang opened his eyes and swept his divine sense outwards. He was surprised to discover that the
    person outside his cave wasn't Yun Youzi, but Yu Daiyue.</p><p>What was he doing here?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled
    but couldn't turn him away. He deactivated the cave's restrictions, rose, and went to greet him.</p><p>"Senior
    Brother Yu, what brings you to my humble cave? Please, come in."</p><p>Qin Sang put on a welcoming smile and ushered
    Yu Daiyue inside.</p><p>"Knowing that Junior Brother Qin was in secluded cultivation, I hesitated for a long time
    before deciding to disturb you. I was afraid of interrupting your training," Yu Daiyue said with a bow as he
    entered.</p><p>"An honored guest graces my home, brightening my humble abode. I'm overjoyed!"</p><p>With a wave of
    his hand, Qin Sang conjured an ice chair and offered tea. Gesturing towards the seat, he said, "Senior Brother Yu,
    please be seated. My cave is simple, please forgive its lack of amenities."</p><p>Yu Daiyue glanced around the cave,
    which contained only an ice bed, and shook his head, sighing, "Junior Brother Qin is not one for worldly pleasures,
    undisturbed by external distractions. This is the true mindset of a cultivator. No wonder your cultivation has
    progressed so rapidly, surpassing even mine."</p><p>Hearing Yu Daiyue's words, Qin Sang felt a pang of
    helplessness.</p><p>Ever since their encounter in the Trial Space, Yu Daiyue had been convinced of Qin Sang's rapid
    increase in strength. No matter how Qin Sang explained, Yu Daiyue remained skeptical, so Qin Sang simply stopped
    trying.</p><p>After Yu Daiyue sat down, he got straight to the point: "Junior Brother Qin, to avoid disrupting your
    cultivation, I'll be frank. Do you still need spirit wood for your natal spirit sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart
    stirred. Back at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's base, Yu Daiyue had mentioned keeping an eye out for spirit wood for
    him. He hadn't expected Yu Daiyue to remember.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Yu, for your concern. My natal
    spirit sword is quite the glutton. Spirit wood is always welcome. If Senior Brother Yu has any high-quality spirit
    wood, I'm willing to pay handsomely for it. I certainly won't disappoint you."</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly confident
    that the over ten thousand spirit stones he possessed were enough to exchange for most spirit wood. As for even
    better spirit wood, he figured Yu Daiyue wouldn't be willing to part with it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Daiyue shook
    his head. "Junior Brother Qin, you misunderstand. I don't have any spirit wood on hand. However, I know there's a
    Earthfire Pantong tree within the ancient cultivator's ruins. That's why I wanted to invite you to return to the
    ruins."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's surprise, Yu Daiyue explained, "Junior Brother Qin, you've been diligently
    cultivating, so you may not knowâ€¦"</p><p>It turned out that after they left, Che Yutao and the others had invited
    several more Foundation Establishment cultivators to help clear the ancient ruins. Among them was the Du cultivator
    they had met at the Upper Primordial Pure Palace via the ancient teleportation formation. He had come personally
    from the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang only now realized that this person was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, just one
    step away from Nascent Soul. No wonder Che Yutao was so respectful towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang ventured to ask, "Did
    Senior Uncle Che and the others manage to rescue Elder Di Que and Daoist Xuan Yu?"</p><p>Unfortunately, Yu Daiyue
    didn't know the details, only that the ancient ruins had stabilized, and most of the fire spirit beasts had been
    eliminated. The remaining ones posed no significant threat.</p><p>Of course, for Foundation Establishment
    cultivators, these fire spirit beasts were still quite dangerous. But as long as a few people entered together and
    remained cautious, they could manage.</p><p>It was said that some of the restrictions on the mountain peaks had been
    weakened by the upheaval and weren't as strong as before, increasing the chances of breaking them. Many people, like
    Yu Daiyue, were gathering companions and entering the ancient ruins to search for treasures.</p><p>"I discovered the
    Earthfire Pantong tree earlier," Yu Daiyue said, "but I lacked the strength to break the restriction on my own. Then
    the upheaval in the ruins occurred, and the matter was put on hold until now."</p>
