<h1>Chapter 931: Ghost Land</h1><p>Mou Lao Mo's face stiffened, and he forced a laugh. "Old Ghost Xue, when did you become so hesitant? If I weren't completely confident, why would I ask for your help and create trouble for myself?"</p><p>"Hmph! Of all the Nascent Soul cultivators present, I'm probably the only one who can help you. Refining a Blood Soul drains me of vital essence that will take decades to recover. If it weren't for the Heavenly Astral Ring, I wouldn't give you one even if you were the most eloquent speaker!"</p><p>The blood-robed elder secretly handed a fist-sized blood sphere to Mou Lao Mo.  Sealed within the sphere was a blood-red human figure, its expression twisted in pain and ferocity.</p><p>"When we get there, you leave this blood sphere. I'll handle the rest."</p><p>Mou Lao Mo's face lit up with joy. He put away the blood sphere and distanced himself from the blood-robed elder, lest anyone notice anything unusual.</p><p>Watching Mou Lao Mo's retreating figure, Patriarch Xue's eyes flickered with suspicion.</p><p>"What incredible treasure did this old devil find in the Seven Kill Sect that made him willing to trade the opportunity to use the Heavenly Astral Ring? Isn't he afraid of the Heavenly Tribulation? I heard he raided Winter Nether Master's cave in the Demonic Sea. Could he have really gained something that significantly increased his strength?"</p><p>…</p><p>Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the Violet River upstream and soon saw the boundless violet mist.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang kept the Sky Eye Butterfly vigilant, avoiding encountering people from the two great trading alliances, but he didn't see a single soul.</p><p>He wondered if the East Pole Alliance had changed its target and hadn't sent anyone here.</p><p>Approaching the violet mist, Qin Sang noticed that its edge seemed to have receded quite a bit compared to his last visit. He wasn't sure if this was a normal phenomenon.</p><p>He opened his spirit beast pouch and took out the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm knew it was time for another feast. It hadn't complained even after being hungry for so long.</p><p>Without Qin Sang's instructions, it happily hopped onto his shoulder, spewed out its Poison-Repelling Shell, and stared intently into the depths of the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone, its head bobbing.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly was still in Qin Sang's Qi Sea, using its divine ability to assist him.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to find the ghost that had snatched the Flying Night Devil and couldn't reveal the Sky Eye Butterfly's presence too early.</p><p>Protected by the Poison-Repelling Shell, Qin Sang flashed into the violet mist, his figure disappearing.</p><p>He headed straight for the Violet Star Condor nest he had passed last time, capturing a few Violet Weasels along the way.  There was more than one passage through this high cliff, but this was the easiest one. Other routes were either too far or extremely dangerous.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when Qin Sang arrived at the passage, he was surprised to find that there wasn't a single Violet Star Condor in the canyon.</p><p>The last time he was here, Violet Star Condors were densely packed, with hundreds of adults constantly circling the canyon. The entire population had been astonishingly large.</p><p>Few beasts could survive in the poisonous mist. The adult Violet Star Condors were quite powerful, and their sheer numbers meant they had almost no natural enemies. They had occupied this place for who knew how many years.</p><p>Otherwise, Xiang Yi wouldn't have been so certain last time.</p><p>"I remember that last time, when the cultivator surnamed Pan betrayed us, he led the Earth Lizard to this group of Violet Star Condors, causing a beast horde-scale battle. Could that battle have wiped out the Violet Star Condors?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, "What beast guards the passage now?"</p><p>He stopped at a distance, not daring to approach, and ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to use its Sky Eye to observe.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there wasn't a single trace of any beast. The canyon was abnormally quiet.</p><p>"Empty?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. If there were no beasts guarding it, he could just swagger through.  But for some reason, he had a vague sense of foreboding.</p><p>He had heard from Lady Liu that Xiang Yi and the others had been unexpectedly chased by a beast comparable to a Transformation Realm Great妖 during their return journey, which had caused so many complications.</p><p>"Could it be occupied by that great beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the canyon, his face full of hesitation. Finally, he decided to take a detour, not risking his life on a gamble.</p><p>He wasn't strong enough to deal with a Transformation Realm Great妖, especially not in the Seven Kill Sect.</p><p>"Fortunately, I made multiple preparations," Qin Sang muttered resentfully.  His figure slowly retreated, then he flew westward along the mountain range for an unknown distance, arriving at a cave entrance.</p><p>The cave was another passage to the other side of the high cliff. It was said that many Earth Dragons, capable of inhaling and exhaling the violet mist, lived inside. These Earth Dragons usually burrowed into the cave to slumber, only becoming active when disturbed.</p><p>However, the violet mist they exhaled was second only to the depths of the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone in toxicity.</p><p>Cultivators who weren't powerful enough or didn't possess top-tier poison-repelling techniques wouldn't dare to choose this path. Therefore, there wasn't much information about the cave, and it was uncertain whether Earth Dragons were the only beasts inside.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, concealing his aura as he slipped into the cave.</p><p>The cave was winding but exceptionally wide.</p><p>It was deathly silent.  Qin Sang walked a long distance without seeing any other beasts.  Then, he suddenly stopped and turned to look at the stone wall.</p><p>Shrouded in violet mist, the sheen of one spot on the stone wall looked strange.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized that it wasn't a stone wall at all, but a scale!</p><p>The entire body of an Earth Dragon was hidden within the stone wall, with only this scale exposed.</p><p>"No wonder they're called Earth Dragons!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Judging from the scale, the Earth Dragon's size was probably even larger than a Flood Dragon. He just didn't know how powerful it was.</p><p>He had no interest in finding out, so he quickened his pace and moved away. He found several more Earth Dragon nests along the way, all slumbering. In the end, he unexpectedly walked out of the cave without incident.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, confirmed his direction, and flew towards the Great Rift Valley. He made a detour along the way, passing near the Ancient Divine Platform, but didn't find any other cultivators.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform was still slumbering underground. Whether it was due to the powerful ancient restrictions or the presence of Demonic Qi, the Sky Eye Butterfly couldn't see into the depths below, so Qin Sang had to give up.</p><p>The Great Rift Valley.</p><p>The supreme-grade magical treasure was within reach.</p><p>Staring at the violet mist, thick as colorful clouds, even Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.</p><p>He used the same tactic as before, quietly climbing down the cliff face, avoiding anything unusual to prevent further complications.  After reaching the bottom of the valley, Qin Sang summoned the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and followed its guidance towards the Ghost Land.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was dissatisfied, rolling around on Qin Sang's shoulder and whining, wanting to get the Violet Crystals first.</p><p>"You're eating more and more. This time, I'll probably have to get a few more pieces to satisfy you. The beast horde guarding the Violet Crystals is very strong, so I need to plan carefully. We'll grab them and run."</p><p>Qin Sang explained to the Fat Silkworm in a gentle voice, his attitude unprecedentedly good.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm finally settled down.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. If this guy threw a tantrum and retracted its Poison-Repelling Shell, he'd be doomed.</p><p>After appeasing the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang twisted and turned, finally returning to the extremely hidden canyon.</p><p>In the canyon.</p><p>The mass of Nine Nether Demonic Fire was still floating in its original spot, firmly blocking the entrance to the Ghost Land.  For decades, it seemed as if nothing had changed. Opposite the demonic fire, pale white ghost mist shrouded the entire Ghost Land space.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to patrons qing2844225, Hunter Lao Meng, shuy20211027175456835, Xuanyuan Qinghuan, shuy20180108170552370, shuy20190513135654262, Big Red Date Mama, Rabbit Language, Born Talented May Become Waste, shuy20210613191337721, and other generous patrons for their huge waves of donations.</p><p>A little confused.
