<h1>Chapter 1769: The Beigong Nandou Refining Talisman</h1><p>“Hundred-Jointed Earth Bamboo…”</p><p>Qin Sang committed the name to memory and expressed his gratitude.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu nodded with a smile.</p><p>In truth, he hadn't come to the Xuangui Sect on official business, but rather with a personal agenda: to lend his weight to Qin Sang's cause.</p><p>Though unsure of True Person Cuiwei’s machinations, Grandmaster Lingxu could guess that accepting the Dharma Edict was no small matter.</p><p>Under the rules established by the Dao Court, those like Grandmaster Lingxu, skilled in alchemy but not combat, enjoyed a certain degree of protection, yet some things were unavoidable.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu’s great renown stemmed from both his exceptional alchemical skill and his gentle, benevolent nature.</p><p>Knowing that the one who had accepted the Dharma Edict was safe and sound, Grandmaster Lingxu rejoiced for him and now offered this small act of compensation.</p><p>He hadn’t expected Qin Sang to possess such a unique alchemical formula. Grandmaster Lingxu proclaimed the trip worthwhile, his feelings towards Qin Sang shifting from mere pity to a genuine desire for friendship.</p><p>Unaware of this, Qin Sang similarly wished to befriend the Alchemy Grandmaster.</p><p>With shared intentions, their conversation flowed effortlessly.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the Xuangui Sect, Grandmaster Lingxu had begun addressing Qin Sang as “Brother Qingfeng.”</p><p>……</p><p>“The Xuangui Sect is just above.”</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu pointed skyward.</p><p>They stood on the surface of a vast river, nearly a thousand miles wide, its waters flowing eastward. It was said that this great river eventually emptied into the Star Island Immortal Lake in Jushanzhi.</p><p>Along the riverbanks, mountains rose and fell, resembling azure dragons.</p><p>Amongst these peaks, one stood out, a crane among chickens. The surrounding mountains, though reaching tens of thousands of feet, were less than half its height.</p><p>Focusing his gaze, Qin Sang looked towards the summit. Above the halfway mark, vegetation was scarce, replaced by sheer cliffs, seemingly carved by a divine hand, impossibly steep.</p><p>On the side facing the great river, a stone stairway had been carved, but its perilous nature meant only cultivators dared tread upon it.</p><p>At the very peak, a thin mist lingered, shimmering faintly, like starlight, obscuring the pavilions within.</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu ascended towards the summit, Qin Sang following closely behind.</p><p>Before they reached the top, a chime echoed, and the Xuangui Sect's gate swung open. Several cultivators emerged to greet them.</p><p>The leader was an acquaintance of Grandmaster Lingxu.</p><p>After inquiring about Qin Sang's name, he said, “Grandmaster Lingxu, True Person Qingfeng, our Sect Master invites you in.”</p><p>Shortly after, they arrived at a Star Pavilion. Grandmaster Lingxu chuckled heartily, “Excellent! Excellent! It seems we've arrived just as True Person Xingqiong has finished her seclusion. I was worried a sudden visit might disturb her cultivation.”</p><p>A woman's voice drifted from within the pavilion, “I had intended to return to seclusion yesterday. However, Grandmaster Lingxu's reputation precedes him. The moment you two arrived at the Sanyuan River last night, the Dragon Lord's troops recognized you…”</p><p>As the voice faded, a Daoist nun emerged from the Star Pavilion. Her cultivation, like Grandmaster Lingxu's, was at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The nun didn't appear young, nor were her features particularly delicate, but her brow held an undeniable air of authority.</p><p>Seeing her, the Xuangui Sect cultivators bowed deeply. “Greetings, Sect Master.”</p><p>This woman was indeed the Xuangui Sect Master, True Person Xingqiong. She dismissed her disciples and gestured towards the Star Pavilion, “Honored guests, please.”</p><p>“A little reputation, hardly worth mentioning.”</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu shook his head slightly and beckoned Qin Sang to enter the Star Pavilion.</p><p>The three took their seats. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Grandmaster Lingxu went straight to the point. “I have a request for you, True Person.”</p><p>He gestured towards Qin Sang. “I owe Brother Qingfeng a favor and promised to assist him with a task. Unfortunately, his request isn't related to alchemy, so I must shamelessly impose upon you.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong turned her gaze to Qin Sang.</p><p>She had already discreetly observed him, sensing his robust Qi and blood, suggesting he was a powerful cultivator of the Dragon and Tiger Altar, yet his aura was strangely veiled. It was difficult to discern his true strength, and a closer inspection would have been impolite. She could only speculate on his identity.</p><p>“What is it that True Person Qingfeng seeks? Our sect has benefited greatly from Grandmaster Lingxu's kindness. As long as it is within my power, I will gladly assist.”</p><p>Grandmaster Lingxu stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>With a nod from Grandmaster Lingxu, Qin Sang rose and bowed. “I wish to request a talisman from you, True Person—the Beigong Nandou Refining Talisman!”</p><p>“That talisman?”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong furrowed her brow slightly. “True Person Qingfeng should know that the Beigong Nandou Refining Talisman has no offensive capabilities. It is a talisman of the Propitiation and Body Refining school, and it is unlikely to be effective for those outside our Xuangui Sect. It may even backfire. Furthermore, due to its high rank, my cultivation is insufficient to guarantee a successful creation, and our sect currently has none in reserve.”</p><p>Some Daoist incantations and talismans were interchangeable. Certain incantations could be crafted into talismans, but these were exceptionally valuable.</p><p>“I understand! I am cultivating a secret technique that requires external assistance. A sudden inspiration led me to your sect’s Beigong Nandou Refining Talisman. Regardless of its efficacy, I will bear the consequences… Would it be possible for you, True Person, to personally perform the technique?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly explained his intentions.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong hesitated, glancing at Grandmaster Lingxu. After a moment, she said, “I am currently cultivating a Daoist technique and need to enter seclusion for approximately two years. Can True Person Qingfeng wait?”</p><p>“I can wait! I can wait!”</p><p>Overjoyed by the unexpected ease, Qin Sang repeatedly expressed his gratitude to both of them.</p><p>With his part concluded, Qin Sang excused himself and was led to the guest quarters by a Xuangui Sect cultivator.</p><p>That night, Qin Sang and Grandmaster Lingxu departed from the Xuangui Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had arranged to meet True Person Xingqiong again in two years at the Star Valley in Jushanzhi. Although he had considered waiting at the Xuangui Sect, he decided to return, anticipating needing to make further preparations before the Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>After escorting Grandmaster Lingxu back to his residence, Qin Sang didn't linger, taking his leave soon after.</p><p>Back at Crane Cry Mountain, Qin Sang consolidated his cultivation while preparing for his upcoming breakthrough. His remaining merit points were almost depleted.</p><p>As the appointed time approached, Qin Sang departed Crane Cry Mountain alone, heading straight for Star Valley.</p><p>Compared to twenty years prior, Star Valley remained unchanged.</p><p>Returning to the subterranean cavern, Qin Sang carefully explored the underground river, finding no trace of True Person Zhijian.</p><p>For the past twenty years, engrossed in secluded cultivation, Qin Sang hadn't seen True Person Zhijian again. He had, however, received a letter from him through True Person Guzhou, containing merely greetings and an invitation to visit Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Unable to decline such hospitality, Qin Sang pondered, “If this breakthrough goes smoothly, I should visit Star Island Immortal Lake and pay my respects to True Person Zhijian.”</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang began making arrangements within Star Valley.</p><p>One by one, refined Star Essence Stones flew outwards, forming a grand formation encompassing the entire valley. Qin Sang would attempt his breakthrough within this formation. Even if unforeseen circumstances arose, the formation could provide some protection.</p><p>Incidentally, he had learned this formation from his Senior Sister.</p><p>Thoughts of his Senior Sister caused Qin Sang to drift into a momentary daze.</p><p>In the years since his unexpected arrival in this world, he had deliberately avoided dwelling on those he had left behind.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang let out an almost imperceptible sigh, gathering his thoughts and resuming his preparations.</p><p>……</p><p>The appointed day finally arrived.</p><p>That morning, Qin Sang ceased his cultivation and waited until midday, when he finally sensed a familiar aura approaching, unmasked and heading directly towards him.</p><p>He flashed out of Star Valley and saw two streaks of light approaching from afar. It was True Person Xingqiong and True Person Fuji, who had received him at the Xuangui Sect.</p><p>“True Person Qingfeng, you’ve been waiting long.”</p><p>True Person Xingqiong landed before Qin Sang.</p><p>“It’s because I chose such a remote location,” Qin Sang chuckled, inviting them into Star Valley.</p><p>Sensing the abundant Star Essence within the valley, True Person Xingqiong nodded in understanding. “You’ve chosen a blessed land, True Person.”</p><p>True Person Fuji, following behind, scanned Star Valley, her eyes lighting up. “This formation is quite impressive.”</p><p>“I am not skilled in formation arts. This is a rudimentary attempt, and there are many aspects I’m unclear about. I was hoping to ask for your guidance, True Person.”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately produced a blank jade slip and inscribed the formation upon it.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>True Person Fuji hesitated, looking towards her Sect Master.</p><p>True Person Xingqiong smiled faintly. “Rest assured, True Person Qingfeng. Since this is a request from Grandmaster Lingxu, I will do my utmost.”</p><p>“Thank you for your trouble, True Person!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed deeply.</p><p>……</p><p>Late night.</p><p>The moon was absent, leaving the night sky teeming with stars, the Star River particularly brilliant.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a stone platform at the bottom of Star Valley.</p><p>The two True Persons from the Xuangui Sect stood on the eastern peak.</p><p>Having discussed the details during the day, True Person Xingqiong observed the celestial timing and nodded to True Person Fuji.</p><p>True Person Fuji soared outwards, summoning an altar. The seal within differed from the Heavenly Hub Institute’s Proclamation of All Spirits Seal. This one depicted the Big Dipper, with the first four stars especially radiant.</p><p>The altar's two gates opened.</p><p>At True Person Fuji's command, troops divided into four detachments, flying in all directions, primarily guarding the east—the direction of the Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>Simultaneously, True Person Xingqiong ascended into the air, also summoning an altar and her troops.</p><p>Instantly, baleful Qi surged skyward, banners obscuring the heavens.</p><p>Down below, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He could sense that while True Person Xingqiong didn’t have Nascent Soul realm Great Demons in her retinue, two late-stage Transformation realm Demon Commanders led her forces.</p><p>Moreover, for merely casting a talisman, True Person Xingqiong was unlikely to reveal her full strength.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly sighed at the profound foundation of this world's sects, noting that even a powerful sect like the Xuangui Sect still answered to the Dao Court.</p><p>Then, True Essence fluctuations emanated from above.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned solemn. Dismissing extraneous thoughts, he waited patiently.</p><p>Troops arrayed themselves around True Person Xingqiong. Generals waved their spirit banners, and the formations shifted instantly, forming a complex, unified Qi field.</p><p>Standing on the altar, True Person Xingqiong paced in accordance with the celestial movements, her eyes deep as the stars themselves.</p><p>She raised her right hand, extending a finger.</p><p>The Big Dipper diagram within the altar trembled slightly, projecting a stream of light, seemingly enveloping a talismanic shadow, which merged with True Person Xingqiong's fingertip.</p><p>As her finger moved, incredibly complex runes appeared in the void.</p><p>“Star Palace majestic, River of Stars abounds with True Spirits.</p><p>Gather Essence in the Northern Palace, Stars descend upon the Southern Dipper.</p><p>Haste!”</p><p>At this moment, all beings within a thousand miles of Star Valley felt a stirring in their hearts. Looking towards the heavens, they witnessed a wondrous sight.</p><p>The Milky Way, illuminating the world, shone brighter than ever before, stars blazing with radiant light.</p><p>Then, the River of Stars began to flow, the starlight seemingly drawn towards a single point—the Big Dipper!</p><p>In an instant, the Big Dipper emerged prominently from the constellations.</p><p>The seven stars connected.</p><p>Starlight surged from the constellations, pouring into the Big Dipper, making it even more dazzling.</p><p>The next moment, the starry sky seemed to tremble. The connected seven stars, like a drawn celestial bow, shot all the gathered starlight towards the Southern Dipper.</p><p>A celestial arrow, spanning the heavens, pierced through the starfield, reaching the Southern Dipper in a flash.</p><p>The six stars of the Southern Dipper reacted, swallowing the starlight. Then, all six stars flared brilliantly, their light descending from the heavens!</p><p>True Person Xingqiong’s eyes gleamed. Tilting her arm downwards, she pointed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Like a surging river, immense stellar power cascaded into Star Valley, engulfing Qin Sang in an instant.</p><p>As the starlight poured in, it triggered a transformation within the valley.</p><p>The accumulated Star Essence within Star Valley was stirred into a frenzy, rushing towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Bathed in starlight, Qin Sang was enveloped by dense Star Essence.</p><p>The celestial phenomena gradually dissipated, while the light within Star Valley intensified, illuminating the surrounding sea of purple bamboo.</p><p>At that moment, points of light appeared within the valley, connecting to form a vast net, covering the entire area and sealing the starlight within.</p><p>Everything seemed to return to normal.</p><p>True Person Xingqiong withdrew her altar, glanced at the sealed Star Valley, and said to the approaching True Person Fuji, “Let us go.”</p><p>Their purpose was to fulfill Grandmaster Lingxu’s request. Qin Sang's success or failure was not their concern, nor were they obligated to protect him.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected them to act as his protectors, hence the formation sealing the valley.</p><p>True Person Fuji acknowledged with a “Yes,” glancing back frequently as they departed, curious about Qin Sang's chances. Such a grand display suggested a remarkable technique.</p><p>She never imagined someone would utilize the Beigong Nandou Refining Talisman for a breakthrough.</p><p>Within Star Valley.</p><p>Unwavering in his focus, Qin Sang circulated his cultivation technique with all his might, drawing the ethereal and profound Star Essence into his body through his crown.</p><p>His skin instantly flushed crimson, threatening to bleed.</p><p>The familiar agony returned, his flesh, bones, and marrow wracked with pain.</p><p>The stronger the body, the more arduous the process of breaking and rebuilding. Qin Sang’s physique had been transformed, yet he still endured terrible suffering during this Star Essence Infusion.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was well-acquainted with this pain. His only fear was insufficient or inadequate Star Essence!</p><p>His body, like a bottomless abyss, continuously absorbed the incoming power. The Star Essence formed a torrent, surging through him again and again.</p><p>Refining blood and bones, transforming tendons and marrow.</p><p>Strength cultivators tempered their bodies to the utmost limit through repeated trials and transformations.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Phoenix wings manifested on Qin Sang’s back.</p><p>Then, a Vermillion Bird dharma idol materialized above him, shimmering faintly, as if undergoing a transformation of its own.</p><p>His divine sense and cultivation realm had already broken through in advance, laying a solid foundation for this physical breakthrough.  However, Qin Sang’s greatest concern was that, not being a descendant of a Celestial Demon, he might repeat his previous failure.</p><p>Fortunately, his fears were unfounded!</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Thunder echoed within Qin Sang’s body.  He nearly roared towards the heavens as his Qi and blood materialized, a beam of crimson light shooting towards the stars, only to be blocked by the formation.</p><p>Finally, his aura surged dramatically, as if crossing a critical threshold.</p><p>Breakthrough!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
