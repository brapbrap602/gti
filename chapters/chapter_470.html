Chapter 463: A Premature End

His vision returned, growing clearer.  Qin Sang could finally see beyond the blinding white light.

Within the white light, the scenery shifted. A massive, smooth, grey-white stone, embedded in the mountain, formed a sheer cliff face.  A deep groove ran through the stone, from which a white line – a waterfall – cascaded.

Below the falls, a sizable pool had formed. To the left of the pool, remarkably, sat a stone pavilion, perfectly positioned at the edge of the waterfall's spray. One could sit within, sipping tea and admiring the spectacular view.

Sadly, half the pavilion was now collapsed, its stones crushing the tables and chairs below.  Debris littered the ground, a testament to its ruin.

Surrounding the pool was a vast expanse of grassland, lush and vibrant with flowers. The meadow stretched out undisturbed, eerily devoid of any living creatures.

This grassland was completely enclosed by a dense forest of ancient trees, save for a small, stone-paved path that wound into the woods and disappeared amongst the giants.

What he could see was only a tiny fraction of the Zhitain Peak.

Qin Sang, understanding the gravity of the situation, meticulously memorized every detail. He surmised this was where he would likely land.

Having thoroughly observed the waterfall, the grassland, and the surrounding area, Qin Sang's face paled.

This forest was unusual.  At the treetops, countless multicolored, amorphous lights coalesced into a luminous expanse.  Interspersed amongst these lights were crystal-clear orbs, radiating a pure starlight.  These orbs, though fewer than the lights, held an almost palpable clarity, captivating the eye.

They intertwined with the lights, indistinguishable from one another.

Qin Sang knew from Deputy Island Master Xiao that these orbs were the source of Star Yuan Stones.  Seeing so many within the forest, he should have been ecstatic, but instead felt a profound sense of dread.

The lights were no ordinary phenomenon. Even from afar, Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of danger radiating from them, a chilling premonition.  They were the remnants of ancient restrictions, as Deputy Island Master Xiao had warned, and a careless approach would surely prove fatal.

For various reasons, the space within Zhitain Peak was highly unstable, and so were the lingering restrictions. Some fragmented restrictions still possessed terrifying power, easily triggered, incredibly difficult to dispel, demanding utmost caution.

However, the lights lay directly below him. The forest stretched endlessly, and if he continued his descent, he would inevitably fall into it, directly into the path of these dangerous lights.

Certain death!

Qin Sang gasped. This was the peril of Zhitain Peak. Without luck and sufficient strength, only death awaited.

He didn't want to die before even beginning his mission.  The wooden carving from Old Madam Jing remained inert, leaving him to rely solely on his own skills.

He absolutely could not fall into the forest.  Only the pool and meadow appeared relatively safe.

The chaotic suction tossed him about. Using his memory, he fixed the positions of the meadow and the pool in relation to his current location.

Then, he opened his hand, revealing the Yin-Yang compass he had been clutching.  His luck held; in this situation, the compass was ideal.

The compass's magnetic energy flickered.

Qin Sang calculated mentally. When a surge of suction hit, the compass emitted a burst of black magnetic energy, a repulsive force counteracting the incoming pull.  Qin Sang launched himself forward, utilizing the force to shift his body several meters closer to the meadow.

This cycle of black and white magnetic energy repeated itself.

Qin Sang focused most of his attention on the compass, leaving only a fraction of his spiritual energy to maintain his robe, significantly weakening its power. Under the strain of the chaotic suction, its luster dimmed, and small tears began to appear.  He was about to lose a valuable artifact, but he couldn't afford to hesitate.

Fortunately, the sacrifice wasn't in vain.

While falling rapidly, Qin Sang managed to adjust his trajectory, inching closer to the meadow. At the last possible moment, he cleared the forest's edge, narrowly grazing a luminous light, before crashing to the ground!

‘Bang!’

Grass flew.  A deep crater formed in the meadow.

Qin Sang painfully crawled from the hole, gazing up at the restriction he had so narrowly avoided, his heart pounding.


Seeing the glow remain still, he finally relaxed.

Forgetting his relief, he circulated his spiritual energy, brushing off the grass clinging to his clothes, and hastily checked his robe.  The robe had over a dozen crisscrossing tears, truly a sorry sight, though thankfully not completely ruined.  It could be repaired later with the right materials.

He stowed the robe and changed into a lower-quality garment.  

Deputy Island Master Xiao had said that the only advantage of Finger Heaven Peak was the complete absence of living creatures. No beasts, ancient or otherwise, made their home in the mountains; the only danger was the ubiquitous fragments of forbidden magic.  That’s why he’d dared to stand there so openly.

Just as Qin Sang was about to survey his surroundings, he felt a movement from the wooden carving on his chest.  It flew out on its own.

Then Qin Sang felt a weight on his right shoulder—the carving had settled there.  Turning his head, he saw that it had come alive, perched on his shoulder, giving a slight nod.

The carving was now identical to a person, a miniature version of Old Lady Jing, no bigger than Qin Sang’s palm.  Though its ethereal air remained, the feeling it gave was entirely different.  It had the serious air of a tiny adult, even somewhat cute…

A great cultivator could easily crush him with a single finger.  Qin Sang dared not harbor any disrespectful thoughts and quickly banished them.

“I need to suppress my cultivation to the utmost, so I must rely on Daoist Friend Qin to help me travel…”

Old Lady Jing’s cool voice reached him. Qin Sang hummed in response. Seeing Old Lady Jing seated like a Guanyin Bodhisattva, her eyes closed, he knew she was sensing the direction and quietly observed his surroundings.

They only had an hour. After that, the suction from above would disappear for a brief moment—a fleeting opportunity. Then Finger Heaven Peak would close again, and if they missed it, they might never get out.

The meadow where he stood was safe enough, but there were no luminous orbs above; all the orbs in this area had been captured by the forest's magical barriers.  To collect the star essence stones, he would have to navigate the gaps in the barriers.

Qin Sang couldn't help but ask, “Senior, how difficult is it to collect the star essence stones in this forest?  It would be wonderful if we could take all of them here.”

Old Lady Jing opened her eyes and nodded. “With the star spirit net, collecting these star essence stones won't be difficult, and there’s a considerable number. However, we can't take them all.”

Qin Sang was puzzled. “Why not?”
