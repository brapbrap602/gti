<h1>Chapter 1316: The Xu Ling Sect</h1><p>Qing Jun listened quietly to their conversation.</p><p>Earlier, Qing Jun had asked Qin Sang about Bai's background.</p><p>Qin Sang's answer was ambiguous.</p><p>Now, hearing that Bai knew everything about the Dao-cultivating Tree, something even they had never heard of, Qing Jun realized that this person's origins were probably more mysterious than she had imagined.</p><p>Qing Jun glanced at Bai, thoughtfully.</p><p>"So, no matter how great the Dao-cultivating Tree's origins are, it will be no different from other puppets in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his thoughts and said indifferently, "Brother Bai, you easily suppressed the talisman puppet earlier. Is there a way to deal with the soul shadows within the puppet's body?"</p><p>"Not entirely," Bai shook his head, "It's a celestial spiritual root after all, it certainly has uses that other spiritual objects don't. If you obtain an external avatar secret technique, you can transform the puppet into an external avatar, and it won't disappoint you. I suggest you don't cleanse the soul shadows within it now, otherwise you'll only get an obedient puppet. This Dao-cultivating Tree can only seal Yuan Ying stage soul shadows, so even if you eventually raise the puppet's strength to the utmost, it won't be much stronger than it is now; it's not worth it. I'll teach you a method, keep them until you cultivate the external avatar technique, they will still be useful then."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, knowing Bai's advice was right. Unlike Qing Jun, he didn't specialize in puppetry; no matter how strong a puppet was, it was still an external object, incomparable to an external avatar.</p><p>He remembered the *Seed of the Yuan Devil Embryo*.</p><p>Bai scoffed, "That bloodline avatar sorcery of yours is extremely crude; at best you can cultivate a Yuan Ying avatar.  When it self-destructed back then, I said there was nothing to regret. Using it on the Dao-cultivating Tree is a complete waste, not much better than the person who refined the Dao-cultivating Tree into a puppet.  Wait until you get a legitimate Daoist external avatar technique before you do anything."</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, thinking to himself that Bai must have been a Daoist back then.</p><p>In Bai's eyes, everything but Daoism was unorthodox.</p><p>But Qin Sang could only comply.</p><p>Judging by Bai's tone, the external avatar cultivated from the Dao-cultivating Tree had limitless potential, perhaps even reaching realms beyond Yuan Ying. Following his advice wouldn't be wrong.</p><p>However, where could he find a genuine Daoist great technique?</p><p>Whether such top-tier techniques even existed in the world was unknown.</p><p>At least, during the Three Realms War, Qin Sang had never heard of any.</p><p>At this time, Qing Jun smiled beside him, "Thank you, Brother Bai, for sharing these secrets. I've learned a lot too. Congratulations, Junior Brother, on obtaining another treasure. If the Dao-cultivating Tree is truly this miraculous, Junior Brother, if you cultivate a Nascent Soul stage external avatar, it will definitely be of great benefit to your main body. In the Bei Chen region, this would be an unprecedented achievement!"</p><p>"Senior Sister is joking. These are just fantasies. I should not be ambitious and should focus on what's in front of me instead."</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>Qing Jun nodded slightly, approvingly, "It's good that Junior Brother understands this."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then suddenly remembered something and asked Bai.</p><p>Since it was clear that the soul shadows remained due to the Dao-cultivating Tree, was there a way to refine a similar artifact that could separate several soul shadows and seal them inside?</p><p>"Golden Core cultivators can increase their chances of breakthrough by comprehending soul shadows. In the future, when I travel, I will definitely bring the Yuan Ying talisman puppet with me. Keeping the artifact at Qing Yang Temple will also leave a path for the younger generation of the sect."</p><p>Bai pondered for a while, then nodded, "There should be a way, but I need to think about it carefully. Alas! Today has truly been a rollercoaster, almost shaking this old man's Dao heart."</p><p>Bai sighed, looking dejected, stood up, asked Qin Sang for the location of the Deep Earth Cave, and flew out of Peach Blossom Valley without looking back.</p><p>Watching Bai leave, Qing Jun also got up and returned to her cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone in the stone pavilion, looking at the Yuan Ying talisman puppet again and again.</p><p>"I am not afraid of soul shadow backlash, using the method Bai taught me, refining these soul shadows is not difficult. However, I still have the Demon Banner; a mid-Yuan Ying puppet is enough, there is no need to strive for greater strength. It's not necessary to sacrifice the future for the present."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly made a decision and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>In the following time, he stayed in Peach Blossom Valley without going out, focusing on refining the Yuan Ying talisman puppet.</p><p>Months later.</p><p>The mist in Peach Blossom Valley churned, and a figure sped out, pausing briefly before flying north.</p><p>It was Qin Sang!</p><p>During this time, he had been transforming the talisman seals within the Yuan Ying talisman puppet, and hadn't finished yet, but had made significant progress. He could now barely control the puppet to fight.</p><p>Completely subduing the puppet would still take some time, but Qin Sang couldn't wait that long, and decided to visit Bing Han now.</p><p>Bing Han had been inviting him to visit the Xu Ling Sect, implying something significant, as if there was something going on.</p><p>Thinking that Bing Han was friendly with Xiang Qing, and had helped him subdue the Ancestor Saint Fire, Qin Sang guessed that Bing Han was probably planning something and needed help.</p><p>Qin Sang was determined to obtain the Xu Ling Sect's alchemical texts.  He would agree to any terms Ice Han proposed. Bai was secluded in the Deep Earth Cave and couldn't be disturbed; the Spirit Infant Puppet would suffice.</p><p>The talismans within the Spirit Infant Puppet had transformed into puppet seals.  Its attacks were now completely different, lacking the telltale shimmering of spirit talismans. Even the ancestors of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace might not recognize it.</p><p>While Qin Sang wasn't worried about the puppet's presence being discovered, he preferred to avoid unnecessary complications. He had no time for distractions.  Creating an artifact to subdue the South Bright Sun Fire before the Ziwei Palace appeared was his priority.</p><p>Ye Laomo's infiltration of the Sinful God Palace gave Qin Sang a bad feeling. He feared further delay would lead to trouble, making it imperative not to miss the South Bright Sun Fire.</p><p>The Xu Ling Sect was located northeast of the Yu Ling Sect, forming a triangle with the Yu Ling and Taiyi Dan Sects.</p><p>Qin Sang flew north from Peach Blossom Valley, traversing mountains and plains. After countless miles, he arrived at a hilly region. The landscape changed dramatically.  Instead of lush forests, there were only scattered, stunted trees, sparse shrubs, and withered grass – a desolate, desert-like expanse.  Hot winds blew steadily from ahead, carrying the pungent smell of sulfur.</p><p>He had reached the Xu Ling Sect.  Their mountain gate was built upon the convergence of subterranean fire veins, the most concentrated and pure geothermal energy in the entire Xiaohan Region.</p><p>Qin Sang continued, spotting a black river – a solidified lava flow. Life was nonexistent here; not a soul was in sight.  He followed the lava river.  Soon, he landed, scanning a vast area of extinct volcanoes.  Several figures rapidly approached from within the mountains; the Xu Ling Sect disciples had detected him.</p>
