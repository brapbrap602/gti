<h1>## Chapter 1378: Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace)</h1><p>"Is this Dao friend satisfied?"</p><p>The old steward watched Qin Sang withdraw his divine sense from the jade slip and asked with a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly.</p><p>The contents of the *Insect Flower Scripture* (Scripture of Insect and Flora) offered him some inspiration, but unfortunately, it wasn't of much help to his three spirit insects. Moreover, the content was rather shallow, and he wouldn't be able to glean anything useful when nurturing Fourth Transformation (Fourth Change) spirit insects.</p><p>If he could obtain the complete *Insect Flower Scripture*, he might truly gain something.</p><p>He would find an opportunity to visit Hundred Flower Valley and strive to have face-to-face discussions with the high-level cultivators within.</p><p>Hearing the old steward's question, Qin Sang lifted his eyelids and glanced at the scattered jade slips on the table, "Your merchant association has Master Feng (Teacher Feng) backing it. It shouldn't only have this little bit of treasure, right?"</p><p>The old steward chuckled and said, "Master Feng's divine abilities are unparalleled. There are also many senior brothers on Wind Yang Mountain (Mount Wind Yang) with profound magical power, so naturally, there's more than just this. However, although Wind Yang Merchant Association has some renown in the eyes of low-level cultivators, it isn't highly valued on Wind Yang Mountain. Some things aren't easily brought out to be sold in the merchant association. Dao friend should be able to understand."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, put away the *Insect Flower Scripture*, glanced at the old steward, and said faintly, "It seems this poor Daoist (I) needs to pay a visit and seek guidance from Dao friend Feng in person."</p><p>Hearing this, the old steward was stunned.</p><p>In the next moment, the old steward only felt a blur before his eyes, and the person opposite him had vanished into thin air.</p><p>The old steward's expression changed drastically. As if his butt were on fire, he suddenly jumped up from the chair.</p><p>He pushed open the door of the quiet room, about to rush out, when the old steward suddenly remembered something and hurriedly took out a sound transmission talisman.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>...</p><p>The divine bell transmitted sound, its voice shaking the clouds, representing the arrival of a distinguished guest.</p><p>It was said that the divine bell on Wind Yang Mountain was an ancient treasure.</p><p>Within the city, whether mortal or cultivator, everyone who heard the bell felt their blood and Qi churn within their bodies, their minds shaken. They rushed out of their shops and cave dwellings, looking up at the mountain peak.</p><p>But they only saw patches of immortal clouds.</p><p>At the mountain gate of Wind Yang Mountain.</p><p>A Core Formation stage cultivator received the message and hurriedly descended the mountain. Seeing Qin Sang watching the scenery on the stone steps, he quickly stepped forward to salute, "This junior is Chu Huanqiang. I didn't know senior would arrive, and I failed to welcome you properly. I hope senior will forgive me!"</p><p>"I heard that Dao friend Feng has been looking for this poor Daoist. This poor Daoist also happens to want to visit Dao friend Feng, so I accepted the invitation... Why, is Dao friend Feng not on the mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Chu Huanqiang and asked with a frown.</p><p>"So it's senior!"</p><p>Chu Huanqiang suddenly understood and apologized repeatedly, "Reporting to senior, my master and other senior brothers are in the outer sea. Only this junior is left behind. However, my master instructed me long ago that if there was any news of senior, I should immediately return to the mountain. If senior has no important matters, I hope you can stay on the mountain for a while. This junior will immediately send a message to my master..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and nodded, "Very well, lead the way."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Chu Huanqiang was overjoyed.</p><p>Qin Sang declined the formalities and ordered Chu Huanqiang to find him a quiet room. Then, he closed the door to visitors.</p><p>...</p><p>Overseas.</p><p>Still that nameless island.</p><p>Inside the palace, including Master Feng, the three Nascent Soul cultivators from before were present.</p><p>At this moment, the expressions of the three were somewhat tense as they stared intently at the white-clad man sitting cross-legged in the center.</p><p>This person was the white-clad scholar who had frightened away the Bi Fang together with Master Feng.</p><p>The white-clad scholar's eyes were tightly closed, his hands clasped on his lap, palms upward, holding a fist-sized sphere. At first glance, it looked like a pearl, but upon closer inspection, it was known to be a light sphere composed of spiritual light.</p><p>Inside the light sphere, a worm-like, blood-colored thing was wriggling.</p><p>The blood worm was like a living creature, its head raised high, swaying erratically.</p><p>The white-clad scholar remained motionless.</p><p>The speed at which the blood worm swung increased faster and faster.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Master Feng and the others' expressions became even more nervous, afraid of disturbing the white-clad scholar.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>*Pa!*</p><p>The blood worm exploded.</p><p>Fortunately, the light sphere confined it, quickly closing again, but it turned into a drop of blood, quietly suspended in the middle of the light sphere.</p><p>Crimson and dazzling.</p><p>A flush appeared on the white-clad scholar's face, his body trembled slightly, and he opened his eyes, revealing a look of fatigue.</p><p>"Dao friend Shen, are you not injured?"</p><p>Master Feng asked with concern.</p><p>The white-clad scholar shook his head, "That demon rat has already perished. Its bloodline divine power, no matter how strange, couldn't possibly hurt me. However, it did consume too much energy, exceeding my expectations."</p><p>"It's good that you're not injured. Have you discovered that person's whereabouts?"</p><p>Master Feng nodded and pressed on.</p><p>The white-clad scholar smiled wryly, "Not good. After all, I can only imitate the demon rat's bloodline divine power to indirectly sense the mark the demon rat planted on that person, so my perception is very vague. I've only confirmed that this person hasn't left this sea area and is still hidden somewhere."</p><p>Master Feng frowned, but his expression didn't change. He comforted him, "Don't rush. The demon rat has already perished. The demon race won't find him faster than us. Being able to do this is already extremely difficult! If it weren't for Dao friend Shen's marvelous divine abilities in eavesdropping on the demon race's plan and hunting down that demon rat, we would still be kept in the dark, believing that the demon race was truly going to raise an army and invade, being deceived by them!"</p><p>The white-clad scholar didn't take credit for himself and sighed lightly, "Unfortunately, what we can do is still too little! I suspect that the reason that person is hiding in this sea area, not moving for so long, is not just because he is severely injured. I'm afraid he has already figured out a way to erase the mark on his body and is implementing it."</p><p>Master Feng didn't take it to heart and said, "Do your best and leave the rest to fate. Obtaining the treasure on that person is certainly good, but even if that person runs away, there will be no loss to us."</p><p>At this time, the phoenix-crowned female cultivator, who had been listening to their conversation all along, spoke, "The person that the two Dao friends encountered before, the one being hunted by the Bi Fang, could it be..."</p><p>"It's not him."</p><p>The white-clad scholar shook his head, "It can be confirmed that the Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace) traitor that the demon race is looking for is only in the early stage of Nascent Soul, with considerable divine powers, and is extremely good at concealment techniques, which is why he has been able to hide until now, not being caught by the demon race. It is impossible for him to break through to the middle stage of Nascent Soul in a short period of time while being hunted. Moreover, if he also masters lightning evasion techniques, he would have already shaken off the pursuers, not being so miserable."</p><p>"So, that person really just happened to be there and unfortunately bumped into the Bi Fang?"</p><p>The phoenix-crowned female cultivator let out a soft laugh, feeling that the person's luck was truly poor.</p><p>The black-clad swordsman didn't care about Qin Sang, stared at the demon blood in the white-clad scholar's hand, and pressed on, "That guy is really a Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace) traitor? Escaping from the Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace) to here is more than a million miles away, and not from the Boundless Sea (Endless Sea). He was chased by the demon rat all the way, dragging his wounded body, almost escaping along the edge of the demon realm. It's too unbelievable!"</p><p>"What I eavesdropped on is exactly like this," the white-clad scholar said. "This person was hunted by the Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace) in Hidden Sun Realm (Realm of Hidden Sun), panicking and losing his way, escaping into the demon island and being secretly followed by the demon rat. He comes from the Profound Heaven Palace (Mystic Sky Palace), so he definitely doesn't lack divine powers and treasures. In addition, that demon rat coveted the secrets on this person, unwilling to share with others, and chased after him alone, giving this person a chance to catch his breath. If this person hadn't escaped to this sea area and entered our human territory, the demon rat would not have been willing to invite other demon kings to help!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Late again, the next chapter will be later, the owed chapter can only be made up later.</p>
