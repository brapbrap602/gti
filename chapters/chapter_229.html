<h1>Chapter 222. Reunion</h1><p>Qin Sang jumped out of the cave and had not gone far when dozens of cloud beasts swooped down on him.</p><p>Sharp screeches pierced his ears, pressing like an infernal chorus into his brain, goading him to madness.</p><p>The cloud beasts’ powerful wings beat, stirring up spiritual energy that smashed into the ground like a torrential downpour. Though they had not yet spotted Qin Sang, they could detect his life force from such a short distance. It was enough to drive them berserk, even if it meant plowing the earth a yard deep to drag him out.</p><p>A sweeping storm of spiritual energy sealed off Qin Sang’s every avenue of escape, drenching him in a deluge of spiritual power that turned the scene into pandemonium.</p><p>Just then, a scarlet sword light burst from the ground with no warning. Blood-red and dazzling, it pierced the sky after a few flickers, stabbing into the midst of the cloud beasts with a flash.</p><p>Whoop!</p><p>The sword light flared out to a width of dozens of zhang, before dividing into a new scarlet light that did the same.</p><p>In just an instant, the sword had split into thirty-two lights, spreading out into a circular sword array that slowly rotated around the core sword.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had not neglected cultivating the Myriad Formations Sword Array despite his intense focus on his cultivation. He could now split the sword into thirty-two lights, a skill comparable to Wu Yuesheng’s.</p><p>Furthermore, he had become somewhat enlightened as to how to split the sword into sixty-four lights. He just hadn’t mastered it yet due to his cultivation limitations. He believed that as long as his cultivation improved, mastering the sword array would be a matter of course.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Hidden amidst the tumbled rocks, Qin Sang piloted the Ebonywood Sword from afar. As soon as the sword array was complete, he issued a thunderous command, his eyes gleaming with intent to kill.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Ebonywood Sword trembled, and the sword light exploded out, forming a pool of blood around the Ebonywood Sword with sword lights resembling waves splashing out of the pool.</p><p>Murderous and razor-sharp!</p><p>In the form of a blood-red millstone, the sword array began to turn, intent on grinding its enemies into dust.</p><p>The cloud beasts in the sword array were all killed in the blink of an eye. Only two that were comparable to Foundation Establishment stage cloud beasts survived, albeit with severe injuries. They fled, only to be sent tumbling by the sword array, letting out enraged cries.</p><p>Qin Sang had temporarily escaped danger, but the battle had stirred up too much trouble, alerting more cloud beasts in the sky. In the air, a hundred or even a thousand cloud beasts swooped down in flocks.</p><p>Just then, a black shadow sprang out from the tumbled rocks and charged fearlessly towards the cloud beasts. With a single punch, it knocked away a weaker cloud beast and bolted for the distance.</p><p>It was a blatant act of provocation. The cloud beasts were instantly driven into a furious frenzy. The massive flock of beasts immediately turned tail and caught up with the shadow in the blink of an eye, consuming it in a gruesome display of force.</p><p>By this time, Qin Sang had taken the opportunity to flee to a distant spot in another direction.</p><p>The shadow was just a zombie he had used as a sacrificial lamb. Most of the corpse puppets he refined were destroyed this way.</p><p>However, only a limited number of cloud beasts could be distracted by a single zombie. It could only buy Qin Sang a little time, and before he could leave the sea of cloud beasts, they had discovered him again. He had no choice but to repeat his previous tactic.</p><p>After discarding three such zombies, Qin Sang finally made it out of the mountain range and could see the plains ahead.</p><p>At the same time, he approached the edge of the sea of cloud beasts.</p><p>To his dismay, the edge of the cloud beast sea was defended by cloud beasts at the Foundation Establishment stage, and there might even be Nascent Soul stage cloud beasts watching from the skies.</p><p>The horizon was black with cloud beasts.</p><p>Each and every one of them caused the world’s spiritual energy to roil with their actions. With so many powerful cloud beasts gathered together, even Qin Sang’s scalp tingled.</p><p>“The changes in the heavens this time are probably not going to be minor!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed internally.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had gained a deep understanding of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The more terrifying the changes in the heavens, the more active the powerful cloud beasts became. Sometimes, you could deduce the severity of the changes in the heavens from the movements of the cloud beasts, and then decide whether to seek shelter.</p><p>Under these circumstances, it was even more imperative that he not expose himself in the open. He had to escape and find shelter as soon as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite familiar with the various shelters around the Sky Crystal Secret Realm, and he knew that there was a very sturdy shelter nearby that could definitely withstand the changes in the heavens - provided he could escape the pursuit of the cloud beasts.</p><p>“It looks like I’ll have to sacrifice another Corpse Demon.”</p><p>A look of heartache appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. After all, he only had three puppets left, and each one lost represented the loss of a formidable fighting force.</p><p>Compared to his life, however, a mere Savage Corpse was nothing.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang made up his mind, he summoned the Savage Corpse as bait when he suddenly heard a strange noise at his ear. Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat and stopped what he was doing. He continued to urge the Ebony Wood Sword to kill any Cloud Beast that approached and turned his head to look west.</p><p>He saw that for some unknown reason, the sea of Cloud Beasts in the west had also become chaotic. A giant sphere formed by countless Cloud Beasts was slowly flying towards him. Among the screams and roars of the Cloud Beasts, he could vaguely hear the sounds of weapons clashing and the fluctuations of spiritual energy.</p><p>Had someone else also been surrounded by Cloud Beasts?</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He wondered if he should invite this person to cooperate with him in order to save the Savage Corpse when he heard a loud shout from the 'sphere': "Fellow cultivator ahead, there are many Cloud Beasts here. I wonder if you would be willing to join forces with this old man to escape this predicament?"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft cry after hearing this voice, and his expression was somewhat surprised.</p><p>On the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, if two people encountered a Cloud Beast or a celestial phenomenon, it would be common for them to cooperate to face the crisis. As for whether or not these two people would turn on each other, that was something to worry about after they had escaped the danger.</p><p>It was normal for this person to invite Qin Sang to join forces, but what surprised Qin Sang was his voice, which sounded familiar.</p><p>"Senior Cloud Wanderer, is that you?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied loudly.</p><p>The person in the 'sphere' was silent for a moment, then let out a hearty laugh. "Younger Brother Qin, it seems we are fated to meet again. To think that after being separated for so long, I would run into Younger Brother Qin in this place. This is not a place for conversation. Why don't we get rid of these Cloud Beasts first and then find a place to talk in detail?"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised that he was able to meet Cloud Wanderer on the vast wasteland.</p><p>Half a year ago, Cloud Wanderer had gone west, saying that he was looking for a way to solve a hidden problem. Had he only just returned from there? Qin Sang wondered if he had succeeded.</p><p>Thinking about all of this, Qin Sang turned around, pointed his sword to the west, and quickly approached Cloud Wanderer. Along the way, he discreetly reached for the mustard seed pouch and secretly placed the Profound Yin Thunder in his palm.</p><p>The two Soul Devouring Awls that Elder Wu had refined for him before he left had already been used up, but this Profound Yin Thunder had persevered until now.</p><p>It was not that Qin Sang harbored malicious intentions, but one could never be too careful when dealing with others.</p>
