Chapter Ninety-Six: Each Flies Their Own Way

‘Crack!’

His spiritual energy depleted, the spirit stone shattered into several pieces. Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within.  "Go!" he barked in a low voice.

The Ebony Sword, pointed towards the stone cave, trembled and instantly transformed into a streak of light, vanishing from Qin Sang's sight. The speed it achieved in that instant stunned even him.

Next, Qin Sang urged the Emptiness Wind to carry him out of the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation.  He saw Zhao Yan lying prone on the ground, motionless.

A pool of crimson blood stained the ground.

Qin Sang manipulated the Ebony Sword to stab Zhao Yan a few more times.  Flying over, he lifted Zhao Yan's body and saw his eyes wide with lingering terror. Zhao Yan had likely just seen the Ebony Sword before it took his life.

"Whew!"

The tension that gripped Qin Sang finally released, and he collapsed to the ground. Only then did he realize the throbbing pain all over his body and the utter exhaustion that weighed down his spirit, making him long for a deep sleep.

But he couldn't relax yet. He was still in danger. Whether he could escape the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation, and the state of the battle outside, remained unknown.

Fortunately, the Ebony Sword had dispatched Zhao Yan effortlessly, preventing a stalemate.  Qin Sang still had a significant amount of spiritual energy remaining in his spirit stones.

He snatched Zhao Yan's storage pouch and glanced at the mystical orchid nestled safely in its jade case. A grin spread across his face. Being able to retrieve it made all the suffering worthwhile.

If the Yuanzhao Sect had already fallen, he would claim to have encountered a formidable foe, resulting in Zhao Yan's death. He would say he escaped using the Four Clouds Divine Restriction. He believed that by handing over this orchid, the Sect Leader, overjoyed, wouldn't fault him for Zhao Yan's demise.

As for the Kuiyin Sect overcoming the Yuanzhao Sect, the likelihood of that was slim, wasn't it?

He wasn't sure if these excuses would save his life. The exact course of action would depend on the situation after he escaped. He would have to adapt accordingly.

In any case, his priority was survival.

Qin Sang smiled wryly.  What other choice did he have? Such a celestial herb was never meant for someone like him.

Sensing his spiritual energy dissipating, Qin Sang didn't dare delay any longer. He grabbed the translucent jade from Zhao Yan's hand.

The refinement method he learned previously also worked on the translucent jade. After refining it, he realized he didn't need to control all five restriction artifacts simultaneously.  By manipulating the translucent jade with his divine sense, he could control the four triangular cloud banners.  This was why a Qi Refinement cultivator could use it alone.

However, a single person could only unleash a portion of the Four Clouds Divine Restriction's power.

A throbbing pain emanated from his dantian. Qin Sang, enduring the discomfort, stood up, raising the translucent jade.  The four triangular cloud banners automatically rose, rotating around him.

He flicked his fingers, incinerating Zhao Yan's corpse and meticulously erasing any trace of his presence. Then, he stepped into the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation.  To conserve spiritual energy, he only activated the Four Clouds Divine Restriction when he encountered the Disaster Wind.

Controlling the restriction artifact alone was considerably more difficult.  Even with the power left by the Sect Leader, Qin Sang struggled, taking several times longer than before to finally emerge from the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation.

He emerged from the clam shell, only to see the ghost banner still standing outside. He wondered about the condition of the Foundation Establishment cultivator inside.

Calculating the time, he realized not much time had passed since he entered the cavern. The rapidly changing situation and constant danger had made it feel like an eternity.

The magical treasure lay before him, but Qin Sang dared not claim it. If the Foundation Establishment cultivator inside was still alive, he would be in a precarious situation.

Even if he chose to escape amidst the chaos, he would have to reluctantly abandon the mystical orchid and the Four Clouds Divine Restriction.

The cloud banners still held the Sect Leader's residual power. The might of a Golden Core cultivator was unfathomable, and there was no telling if there were secret methods to track him down.

It was better to surrender the orchid and exchange it for a brighter future.

Qin Sang employed the Four Clouds Divine Restriction's concealment technique, vanishing from sight.  The fact that Zhao Yan dared to infiltrate this place right under the noses of the high-ranking cultivators of Yuanzhao Peak indicated that the Four Clouds Divine Restriction was far superior to the Falling Cloud Wings.

Concealing his aura, Qin Sang swiftly swam towards the lake's surface. Slowing down as he neared the surface, he cautiously climbed ashore and hastily fled Yuanzhao Peak, only daring to look up once he was a safe distance away.

He gazed at the scene above with astonishment.

Above Yuanzhao Peak, dozens of figures stood in mid-air, forming a grand formation.

These were all Foundation Establishment cultivators. He wasn't sure if Yu Hua was among them.

In their midst, a white-haired elder held up one hand towards the sky, a massive yin-yang symbol slowly rotating as if supported by his single hand.  Boundless demonic flames blazed on the yin-yang symbol, accompanied by the roars of vicious ghosts as they relentlessly crashed against it.

With his other hand, the elder reached towards the ground, drawing streaks of white energy upwards from Yuanzhao Peak, converging in his palm like a whale swallowing water.


Qin Sang heard that Yuanzhao Peak was the converging point of the spiritual veins of the surrounding mountains. Could that old man be drawing spiritual power from the veins to support the great formation?
But the protective formation was covered in cracks, and the situation seemed dire.
Qin Sang quietly climbed to a high vantage point and saw chaos within the Yuanzhao Sect. Disciples were running around like headless chickens, streaks of light flashing across the sky, and panicked shouts echoing from afar.
After a moment of thought, Qin Sang put away the Four Clouds Divine Restriction and flew towards his own Returning Sun Valley on the Emptiness Wind.
Unexpectedly, he was intercepted by Meng Ruhuai as he passed by Drifting Cloud Valley. All the disciples of Drifting Cloud Valley stood outside the valley, their faces etched with worry.
“Junior Brother Qin, where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere.” Meng Ruhuai’s face was filled with anxiety.
Qin Sang had already prepared an excuse. He replied in a panicked tone, “I was listening to a lecture in the Dharma Hall. When the sect came under attack, our teacher told us to find a place to hide. I only dared to come out now. Senior Brother Meng, what's the situation now? What are the sect's arrangements for us?”
Meng Ruhuai said, “A moment ago, a senior uncle transmitted a message. The sect will gather the power of the great formation and fight the demons to the death. The demonic sect lacks manpower and won't target Qi Refinement cultivators like us. When the formation opens, each hall will flee separately and wait…”
Before he could finish, a sound like a thunderbolt boomed through the sky.
Everyone looked up in horror and saw a huge crack split open at the edge of the protective formation, a corner collapsing. Several mountains at the edge of the formation crumbled, sending waves of rock and earth skyward. Demonic flames fell upon the mountains, instantly flaring up as if to incinerate everything. The disciples of Yuanzhao Sect cried out in alarm.
The protective formation… was broken!
“Run!”
Meng Ruhuai brandished his flying needle magic weapon and shouted.
In an instant, countless streaks of light illuminated the Yuanzhao Sect, like fragile fireflies in the night sky. The disciples of Yuanzhao Sect used every means at their disposal to flee in all directions.
Qin Sang intentionally lagged behind, avoiding Meng Ruhuai. Aside from Meng Ruhuai, he wasn't familiar with the other disciples of Drifting Cloud Valley, so they wouldn't pay him much attention.
After escaping Yuanzhao Sect with the crowd, Qin Sang left the group and flew southwest on his own.
He was most afraid that high-level cultivators from the Kuiyin Sect would be waiting in ambush outside and remained vigilant.
He flew a considerable distance from Yuanzhao Sect without being intercepted. Just as Qin Sang was about to breathe a sigh of relief, he suddenly felt a fierce gust of wind slam into his back, sending him crashing into the forest below.
