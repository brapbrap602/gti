<h1>Chapter 1126: Sword Momentum</h1><p>After their sparring session, the two returned to Peach Blossom Valley.  </p><p>Bai went into seclusion immediately.  </p><p>Qin Sang passed through the peach grove and arrived at the tomb of Elder Green Bamboo. After paying his respects, he returned to his cave abode.  </p><p>He took out the charred wood fragment left behind by Wanderer Yun.  </p><p>Whether it was due to his insufficient cultivation or the fragment being too faint, Qin Sang couldn’t sense Wanderer Yun’s primordial spirit within it.  </p><p>“Bai is right. I should wait until I form my Nascent Soul before attempting this. Only then can I ensure success,” Qin Sang murmured to himself. “After forming my Nascent Soul, I’ll first enhance the Ebony Sword. The remaining Soul-Nurturing Wood should be enough to elevate it to the level of a top-grade treasure. Only then can I fuse it with this charred wood.”  </p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang took out the Calamity-Overcoming Pill.  </p><p>He hadn’t been in the mood to examine it before.  </p><p>*Click!*  </p><p>The jade bottle opened, and a dense spiritual mist lingered without dispersing.  </p><p>Though he didn’t smell the expected medicinal fragrance, Qin Sang felt a sudden clarity in his mind. The golden core and true essence in his dantian stirred, seemingly agitated by the pill’s aura.  </p><p>“Truly, this is a divine Calamity-Overcoming Pill!”  </p><p>Qin Sang calmed his dantian, his gaze turning serious.  </p><p>There was only one Calamity-Overcoming Pill. He couldn’t afford to fail when forming his Nascent Soul!  </p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang sat cross-legged. A flash of light appeared between his brows, and the Ebony Sword flew out.  </p><p>Back in the Surging Sea, after comprehending the technique of sword light division, Qin Sang had never slacked off. He had developed his own sword wheel, undergone the trials of the Sword Path, sparred with puppet sword formations in the Trial Realm, and studied the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*…  </p><p>Yet, he had always been one step away from comprehending sword momentum.  </p><p>Originally, Qin Sang had planned to focus on cultivation. Once he formed his Nascent Soul, he would continue his sword path, and everything would fall into place naturally.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, he had suddenly comprehended sword momentum at this time.  </p><p>Bai had suggested the sparring session to help dispel the gloom in Qin Sang’s heart.  </p><p>During the intense battle, Qin Sang had fought without considering retreat, purely venting his emotions. This had resonated with his sword heart, becoming the catalyst for his breakthrough.  </p><p>However, he had still been slightly short at that time.  </p><p>Fortunately, Bai, with his vast experience, noticed Qin Sang’s unusual state and immediately guessed what was happening. Under Bai’s immense pressure, Qin Sang finally broke through the bottleneck!  </p><p>Sword momentum was the foundation of sword formations. Only by integrating it into a sword formation could its true power be unleashed.  </p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had set aside the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, feeling that his current level of attainment would require too much time to master it. He had thought it better to focus on improving his cultivation and breaking through as soon as possible.  </p><p>Now that he had comprehended sword momentum, studying the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture* would no longer be as difficult. If he could deploy a sword formation, it would greatly enhance his combat power.  </p><p>Various thoughts flashed through his mind.  </p><p>Among them were the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.  </p><p>There were also the myriad transformations of the puppet sword formation he had witnessed.  </p><p>And the next layer of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, which contained fragments related to the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.  </p><p>There were also the words Bai had spoken during their earlier conversation.  </p><p>“Although you cultivate a slaughter-based sword formation, I’ve observed that your sword intent carries a sense of grandeur, not the extremity of a killing sword. Yet, the sword energy you just displayed carried a hint of sorrow.”  </p><p>Qin Sang pondered this.  </p><p>He understood why Bai had felt this way before.  </p><p>Cultivating the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* required comprehending slaughter runes through killing. Even if one wasn’t a bloodthirsty person, emerging from mountains of corpses and seas of blood would inevitably affect one’s state of mind.  </p><p>However, Qin Sang had always been protected by the Jade Buddha, maintaining a peaceful state of mind. He had merely treated this technique as a stepping stone for advancement.  </p><p>Perhaps, among those who cultivated slaughter-based techniques, he was the one with the least killing intent.  </p><p>Moreover, the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* was all-encompassing. The technique was merely the foundation, and each cultivator had their own comprehension, forging their own path.  </p><p>Unintentionally, Qin Sang had followed the technique without deviation, hinting at a path of grandeur. The sorrow in his sword momentum was related to the breakthrough and was only temporary. Once he formed his Nascent Soul, it would return to its proper course.  </p><p>Reviewing the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, Qin Sang noticed that its sword intent differed from his own. It was unyielding and sharp, yet carried a hint of hatred and hesitation, aligning with Elder Green Bamboo’s experiences.  </p><p>The puppet sword formation was different.  </p><p>This sword formation was infinitely variable, extremely intricate, and complex.  </p><p>It was certain that the puppet’s creator had a deep connection to the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. The puppet sword formation was based on the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.  </p><p>“Elder Green Bamboo’s path isn’t entirely suitable for me. I should only absorb the essence of the sword scripture and continue down the path of the technique, without being influenced by Elder Green Bamboo.”  </p><p>Qin Sang was clear-headed and made his choice. “Based on the transformations of the puppet sword formation, I should be able to comprehend some aspects of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation. For now, setting up a sword formation based on this is the most suitable for me. The benefits are obvious. After forming my Nascent Soul, the Ebony Sword will be used to nurture Elder Green Bamboo’s primordial spirit. If I can comprehend the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation on my own, I won’t need my lifebound spirit sword to engage in battle.”  </p><p>After carefully organizing his thoughts, Qin Sang solidified his path.  </p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun had been out of contact for a long time. Only after her return could they enter the Heaven-Pointing Peak.  </p><p>For now, his focus was on cultivation and forming his Nascent Soul. However, with the time freed up from *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement*, he could dedicate some of it to comprehending the sword path.  </p><p>…  </p><p>Five years passed.  </p><p>Time was enough to smooth over everything.  </p><p>The sorrow of Wanderer Yun’s passing faded.  </p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his cave abode.  </p><p>Outside, snowflakes drifted, and the land was frozen for thousands of miles. Yet, Peach Blossom Valley remained warm and spring-like.  </p><p>A white crane flew over, carrying a message talisman in its beak.  </p><p>Qin Sang opened it and found a message from Li Yufu, stating that he had hit a bottleneck in his cultivation and, finding no progress in seclusion, had decided to travel and gain experience.  </p><p>It had been over twenty years since Qin Sang’s return.  </p><p>The cultivation world had enjoyed an unusually long period of peace, giving people the illusion that the Sin Abyss was no longer capable of invasion and that this tranquility would last indefinitely.  </p><p>Li Yufu was talented and his cultivation was not weak. Qin Sang wasn’t worried about him.  </p><p>Noticing that the peach grove looked slightly untidy, Qin Sang walked in and began carefully pruning the branches.  </p><p>The peach trees seemed to exude a sense of loneliness. Senior Sister Qingjun had been away for too long this time. With the master absent, the peach blossoms bloomed but went unappreciated.  </p><p>Just then, the valley’s protective formation was suddenly disturbed.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred as he looked toward the valley entrance, finally catching sight of a flash of red robes.  </p><p>“Senior Sister!”  </p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved to greet her.  </p><p>Qingjun’s demeanor was as striking as ever. As she gazed at the delicate peach blossoms in the valley, her sharp eyes gradually softened.  </p><p>“Oh? You’re almost at the peak of the Golden Core stage!”  </p><p>After a glance at Qin Sang, Qingjun was quite surprised.  </p><p>She was well aware of the efficacy of the slaughter runes in the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, but what surprised her was how much Qin Sang had changed during her absence—not just in terms of cultivation.  </p><p>“I still need a few more years to refine my cultivation,” Qin Sang replied.  </p><p>“Have you prepared for forming your Nascent Soul? How confident are you? It seems the Frosted Domain will soon have another Nascent Soul Patriarch.”  </p><p>As they walked into the peach grove, Qingjun seemed in good spirits and asked proactively.  </p><p>“There’s a small matter related to my Nascent Soul formation that I’d like to ask for your help with,” Qin Sang said, seizing the opportunity. “Elder Green Bamboo once said that a powerful physical body would aid in forming the Nascent Soul. I’ve been cultivating a body-refining technique and need to use stellar energy infusion to break through to the fourth layer. The Heaven-Pointing Peak is the best place for this. I was wondering if the teleportation array and the immortal manor connected to the Heaven-Pointing Peak are still intact?”</p>
