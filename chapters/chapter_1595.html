<h1>Chapter 1586: Reunion with an Old Friend</h1><p>Chapter 1586: Reunion with an Old Friend</p><p>Overhearing nearby cultivators discussing,</p><p>this was Su Zinan's third search area.</p><p>The previous two had yielded nothing.</p><p>Cultivators had gathered on nearby islands, watching the results.</p><p>It was unclear what methods Su Zinan was using.</p><p>The distant sea surface bulged high, water continuously flowing outwards. Qin Sang flew a little higher and saw that the bulge was ring-shaped, forming a bottomless pit in the center.</p><p>Inside the pit, lights of various colors flashed incessantly, and the fluctuations of magical treasures and spells could be clearly perceived.</p><p>Several figures floated in the pit.</p><p>Several were clearly central figures.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, identifying the individuals.</p><p>One of them, in white robes and a jade belt, was the currently prominent Su Zinan; his appearance was quite well-suited to the Yuefei.</p><p>"That old demon wasn't Su Zinan after all," Qin Sang recalled the old man, Wu Lao.</p><p>He remembered the old demon lacked the Dark Moon Mark on his forehead, wasn't a Dark Moon Guard, and wondered about his status in Luye.</p><p>Scanning the others, Qin Sang noticed the man beside Su Zinan.</p><p>This person remained silent, standing quietly, giving off an otherworldly aura.</p><p>"Mo Xingdao, the number one independent cultivator of the Northern Wastelands. What is his relationship with Luye… A Nascent Soul sect indeed, at least three great cultivators openly and secretly! Did the old demon not come? Or is he hidden, waiting to support Su Zinan?"</p><p>Qin Sang observed Mo Xingdao for a while, then activated his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, secretly searching.</p><p>From Su Zinan's side to the outermost onlookers.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned broadly but found no one resembling Wu Lao.</p><p>The sun set into the sea.</p><p>As night fell, the glowing treasures in the pit suddenly extinguished. Su Zinan, with a gloomy face, flew out of the pit, followed by Mo Xingdao and others. The seawater receded, returning to normal.</p><p>Then, ignoring everyone else, Su Zinan flew directly back to the Chi Nan Island chain.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this search had also failed.</p><p>…</p><p>Over the following month,</p><p>Qin Sang followed Su Zinan to many places, each time leaving with high hopes and returning disappointed.</p><p>Su Zinan's activities were erratic, going all over the place.</p><p>After many such instances, Qin Sang began to suspect whether Su Zinan even had a way to pinpoint the Wuwang Palace ruins, or if he was deliberately delaying.</p><p>These days, many cultivators of unclear origins had appeared among the onlookers, some concealing their auras, but they couldn’t hide from Qin Sang’s spiritual sense.</p><p>This didn’t affect his cultivation of the Fire Seed Golden Lotus, so Qin Sang decided to continue waiting for Su Zinan.</p><p>Another half-month passed.</p><p>While Qin Sang was cultivating, the innkeeper sent someone to report that Su Zinan had left the island again.</p><p>Su Zinan's actions were always highly visible, saving Qin Sang the trouble of constant surveillance.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly ended his cultivation, the Fire Lotus seed retreating into his brow.</p><p>Without needing to inquire about Su Zinan's destination, Qin Sang stepped out of the inn and saw streaks of escaping light in the sky, all heading in the same direction.</p><p>He followed unhurriedly.</p><p>He soon discovered that this time was different. Su Zinan left the island and sped towards the southeast, his target clear.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he accelerated, surpassing most of the cultivators.</p><p>Before long,</p><p>everyone followed Su Zinan to a new sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang habitually landed on a deserted island, finding a place with a good view to observe.</p><p>He saw Su Zinan and the others pause on the sea surface, forming a circle, seemingly in discussion.</p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time,</p><p>Mo Xingdao and other Nascent Soul cultivators each received a strangely shaped wooden stake from Su Zinan, then dispersed in all directions. Only a Dark Moon Guard remained beside Su Zinan.</p><p>The stakes were as thick as a thigh, only three feet long, with densely carved grooves. Under the sunlight, they reflected an eerie blood-red light.  It looked like the stake's veins, with blood flowing constantly within.</p><p>Everyone holding a stake formed a circle more than ten miles in diameter. Su Zinan was in the center, suspended above the sea, sitting cross-legged in midair.</p><p>Su Zinan closed his eyes.</p><p>Others began to work busily.</p><p>From such a distance, Qin Sang couldn't see what they were doing, but it seemed to be an array formation.</p><p>After a while, Su Zinan let out an unintelligible growl.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the others immediately threw their stakes into the sea.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Water splashed.</p><p>The stakes plunged into the sea, mostly submerged, with parts sticking out, suspended motionless.</p><p>Simultaneously, Su Zinan raised his hands, quickly completing a hand seal, then pressed his palm downwards, a ray of light shooting into the sea.</p><p>The light silently merged with the seawater.</p><p>Suddenly, the outer stakes changed. The blood in the grooves flowed rapidly, emitting a strong blood-red light.  The stakes resonated with each other, their lights attracting one another.</p><p>‘Swish swish swish…’</p><p>The blood-red light formed lines, connecting all the stakes, creating a complex pattern on the sea surface.</p><p>Su Zinan, the one controlling the array, seemed to be straining greatly. His face was flushed, and he swayed slightly.</p><p>Just as onlookers thought something had gone wrong, Su Zinan abruptly faded and disappeared.  Simultaneously, a Su Zinan appeared above each wooden stake before merging into them.</p><p>"Open!"</p><p>A loud shout rang out.</p><p>The stakes sank into the ocean floor. The water at the center of the array turned to blood, a vibrant crimson, like a blood-red jewel embedded in the sea.</p><p>With a churning sound, the blood surged upwards as a thick beam of blood light, shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>Both Su Zinan's actions and this Bloodwood Array differed drastically from previous attempts.  Anyone with sharp eyes could see this day held a significant change.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the beam of light, then witnessed an astonishing sight.</p><p>The light reached a thousand zhang into the sky and vanished abruptly.  The Bloodwood Array continued to operate, the blood light still a steady column, but only the lower portion was visible.</p><p>An invisible, immense mouth seemed to be swallowing the blood light in the void.</p><p>Cries of astonishment echoed around.</p><p>Qin Sang intently watched where the blood light disappeared, directing his Sky-Eye Butterfly to fully activate its celestial vision. Initially, nothing unusual was detected; there was no barrier as imagined.</p><p>As the blood light intensified, a change finally occurred. A dark spot faintly emerged within the light, rapidly expanding.</p><p>In an instant, the dark spot grew to half the size of the blood light and continued expanding at an alarming rate.</p><p>Even those without the Sky-Eye Butterfly noticed the anomaly in the blood light.  An unknown force tore a gaping hole in the void, resembling some kind of passage.</p><p>"We found it!"</p><p>"Are you sure it's the Wuwang Hall? Was it like this when the ruins were last opened?"</p><p>"Elder Shen was present then!  Hmm? Where's Elder Shen?"</p><p>...</p><p>The island erupted in chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the black hole, his expression grave. The hole was pitch black; for some reason, it filled him with a sense of foreboding, a feeling that intensified as it expanded.</p><p>Suddenly, a grey energy burst from the black hole.</p><p>With a earth-shattering roar, everyone was stunned speechless, staring upwards as the grey energy erupted from the black hole, unleashing incredibly destructive power, crashing downwards.</p><p>A grey waterfall materialized in the void.</p><p>Even from this distance, everyone felt the energy's destructive force, their hearts pounding.</p><p>The grey energy raged downwards.</p><p>Those within the Bloodwood Array were the first to be struck.</p><p>Streams of escaping figures fled the array. Su Zinan and the others were in disarray, their faces etched with fear as they looked back.</p><p>The grey energy was a torrent of extreme chaos.</p><p>The Bloodwood Array was torn to shreds.  The black hole was gone, an endless torrent of grey energy surging forth, a chaotic maelstrom of turbulent energy, spreading outwards at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood why it could level an entire island.</p><p>The sight reminded Qin Sang of the scene when the Ziwei Palace ascended.</p><p>Spatial rifts also contained terrifying spatial currents; even with the protection of the ascension platform, only cultivators at the Nascent Soul后期 stage could hope to survive.</p><p>Of course, the two currents differed.</p><p>Qin Sang distinctly sensed chaotic restrictive energies within the grey energy, likely caused by the destruction of a spirit array or secret realm.</p><p>Even a Transformation stage cultivator probably couldn't create such an array—at least, it was an ancient immortal array of a level beyond comprehension. The Wuwang Hall's resources were far deeper than imagined.</p><p>Much time had passed.</p><p>The Wuwang Hall had become a thing of the past.  Some ancient texts had recently resurfaced, but the relevant records were scarce and unreliable.</p><p>According to research, the Wuwang Hall, during its heyday, was a super-power spanning the mainland and the East Sea, possibly jointly ruled by humans and demons.</p><p>The coexistence of humans and demons within one power was unimaginable to today's cultivators.</p><p>Now, humans and demons are estranged, and the Wuwang Hall lies in ruins. Fortunately, the Central Plains is vast, and the waters between the mainland and the East Sea are expansive and desolate.</p><p>The booming sounds were deafening.</p><p>In just a quarter of an hour, the currents covered a large expanse of the sea before the expansion slowed, transforming the area into a storm, obscuring the sky.</p><p>The surrounding seas were affected, with monstrous waves crashing down.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his protective energy to withstand the gale and looked towards Su Zinan and the others at the edge of the currents.</p><p>Su Zinan looked pale, but thankfully he had escaped quickly and hadn't been directly impacted.  He channeled his energy and shouted, his voice overriding the storm, "Which fellow cultivator is willing to help me enter the Wuwang Hall? My previous offer still stands!"</p><p>Silence reigned from afar.</p><p>After a moment, someone loudly questioned, "Daoist Su, do you intend to traverse these turbulent currents and enter the deepest part?"</p><p>Su Zinan's answer was unexpected. "I don't know much about the Wuwang Hall. Whether it's located deep within the turbulent currents is something we'll only know once we're inside."</p><p>A commotion arose among the crowd.</p><p>The precedents of the Baguan View and the Ganlu Zen Monastery were on everyone's mind.  Common sense dictated that since both sects had returned empty-handed, anyone with any sense wouldn't accompany Su Zinan on this risky venture, lest they suffer the same fate.</p><p>However, Su Zinan's ability to pinpoint the Wuwang Hall so quickly, and the unusual bloodwood array, suggested he knew some hidden secrets.</p><p>Everyone weighed the risks and benefits, and no one responded immediately.</p><p>Su Zinan shook his head, about to lead his party into the turbulent currents, when someone else called out, "Daoist Su, can you tell us why you want to enter the Wuwang Hall? Since you claim to renounce all treasures, you're not going there for treasure, are you?"</p><p>Su Zinan was silent for a moment before replying, "I'm searching for someone!"</p><p>Searching for someone!</p><p>This statement caused an uproar.  Rumors of Nascent Soul cultivators trapped within the Wuwang Hall had been circulating for a while now, starting with the Baguan View and Ganlu Zen Monastery, and now Su Zinan.</p><p>"Who?" someone immediately pressed.</p><p>Su Zinan looked around, unable to locate the speaker. He responded coldly, "I'll wait ten breaths!"</p><p>Nine breaths passed in an instant.</p><p>As the last breath ended, a streak of light appeared on a distant island.  An elderly man with white hair and beard flew to Su Zinan, nodding, "I will accompany you, Daoist Su."</p><p>Su Zinan rejoiced, giving the old man a closer look, surprised, "Are you the Lord of the Qiling Cave?"</p><p>The old man chuckled, "I didn't expect Daoist Su to know of my humble name. It's an honor."</p><p>"Lord, you're too modest.  The Lord of the Qiling Cave in Nan Prefecture – who doesn't know you?  It's my honor to finally meet you in person!" Su Zinan expressed his enthusiasm.</p><p>Seeing that no one else responded besides the Qiling Cave Lord, Su Zinan didn't hesitate and led his group into the turbulent currents.</p><p>As soon as they entered, colorful streaks of light flashed from the various islands, flying near the turbulent currents. After sensing their power, most cultivators retreated.</p><p>Even Golden Core cultivators would likely not survive long in such a place, let alone obtain treasures. They would only risk their lives.</p><p>However, the commotion caused by Su Zinan attracted numerous Nascent Soul cultivators, some alone, others in pairs or small groups.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the turbulent currents alone.</p><p>He chose not to go with Su Zinan.</p><p>Years ago, he had used a sword array, demonic fire, and the Sun God Tree against Old Wu.  If his opponent knew about it, he wouldn't be able to hide it if he encountered danger inside.  He would face the combined attack of three great cultivators, which would be disadvantageous.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a hunch that Su Zinan's intentions were not entirely pure. If Old Deer Demon was trapped in the Wuwang Hall, it contradicted Yuefei's account.  It was still necessary to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed into the turbulent currents.</p><p>The outermost areas were relatively easy; he could dodge the impacts of the currents. But the currents changed very rapidly, and not far in, they became extremely dense, requiring him to withstand them directly.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, activating the protective energy shield.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly observed the surroundings for him.</p><p>He could see other cultivators on both sides. They were all heading in the same direction as Qin Sang, attempting to follow Su Zinan.</p><p>Ignoring others, Qin Sang instructed the Sky-Eye Butterfly to use its full power to track Su Zinan's movements.</p><p>They hadn't gone far when Qin Sang suddenly stopped.</p><p>There was nothing around, yet at that moment, he felt a subtle change, as if entering a different space.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Several turbulent currents struck simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, and he was instantly subjected to the impact of several chaotic forces.  Explosions echoed, his energy shield vibrated, flickering uncertainly.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly increased his energy to stabilize the shield.</p><p>"Hiss... even before entering, the power of the currents is so strong! Nascent Soul stage cultivators without sufficiently strong protective abilities can only stop here."</p><p>Qin Sang prepared himself and continued forward, noticing that cultivators to his left indeed failed to keep up.</p><p>Further on, every step was arduous; more and more people fell behind.  They could only stay nearby, hoping to make some discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew increasingly serious. He had investigated the scene of the previous relic's opening in the Nan Prefecture Archipelago.  While the outermost currents were powerful, they weren't this intense.</p>
