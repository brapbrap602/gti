<h1>Chapter 1776: The Left Thunder Mansion</h1><p>Regardless of the repercussions this might cause at the San Yang Gate, Qin Sang drifted down the mountain and walked away, pondering the recent investiture ceremony.</p><p>The supervising master shattered the gold talisman, failing to complete the final burning and presentation to the celestial court, thus rendering the investiture unsuccessful.</p><p>However, as his consciousness and blood merged with the blank gold talisman, he gained many insights. Combining this with previously acquired secrets, Qin Sang gained a deeper understanding of the sect's rituals and talismans.</p><p>That gold talisman was only a blank talisman.  He felt nothing special when his consciousness and blood merged with it.  The San Yang Gate disciples only saw the talisman transform into a true talisman after the seal was added and it was burned and presented. This shows that the burning and presentation is crucial.</p><p>To illustrate:  it's like in some earthly nations where officials have the power to recommend virtuous individuals for positions, but must first submit a report to the prime minister or even the emperor for imperial approval before the individual can be appointed.</p><p>The talisman is the official seal of the court. With it, one can take up their post, and military officials can command troops.  The 'court' has many interpretations: some say it's Heaven, the Dao; others say it's the celestial court, the heavenly court.  These individuals aren't receiving official positions, but permission to cultivate in this realm.  The talisman allows them a place in this chaotic world, gaining the recognition of the gods, enabling them to summon divine beings.</p><p>Therefore, to Qin Sang, the San Yang Gate's transmission masters and supervising masters are more like officials with the power of recommendation. They have the power to recommend, but not to appoint. They can only set up the altar and make a presentation, acting as intermediaries.  They may not even have the ability to control the sect's altar or talismans.</p><p>Indeed, the investiture altar at Ju Shan is extremely rare; no sect can build one independently; all are inherited from antiquity.  Therefore, if the person conducting the investiture cannot detect Qin Sang's cultivation, then whoever can must be the recipient of the burned and presented talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up to the sky, the azure heavens stretching endlessly into the distance. Where does the talisman go? Where are the gods? Is there a heaven beyond heaven?</p><p>Initially, he was skeptical of Daoist legends, but the existence of the talisman made him think deeply. Could the two courts of the Daoist court be that 'court'?  Is the burning and presentation directly sent to the two courts of the Daoist court?</p><p>If he is ultimately targeted by the two courts of the Daoist court, his actions over the years would seem laughable.  However, Qin Sang feels this is unlikely. Merging a mere strand of consciousness and a drop of blood into the blank talisman shouldn't be so easily detected.</p><p>If the two courts of the Daoist court could control all the sect altars, they could decide who receives an investiture and who doesn't. Cultivators from Ju Shan could not escape the Daoist court's grasp; there would be no need to issue imperial edicts or offer merit to pacify them.</p><p>More importantly, Qin Sang has been pondering the implications of the talisman.  With the chaotic world and the rampant energy of the six ancient heavens, even Nascent Soul cultivators are helpless, nearly losing their path. Could this be the Dao's rule in this realm?</p><p>Then, a talisman that allows cultivators to practice in such an environment possesses an almost world-altering power. What kind of power wields such might?</p><p>Qin Sang believes the talisman's function might only be to connect to this power and protect cultivators. As for the source of this power, it's beyond his comprehension.</p><p>If the two courts of the Daoist court possessed this power, they would have eradicated the demons of Gui Fang long ago. Perhaps there truly is a heavenly court and gods above the heavens!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, withdrawing his gaze. Regardless, if he wants to continue cultivating, he must conform to local customs. He needs the talisman; overthinking is pointless.  He will continue with his plan.  He will do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>After this test, Qin Sang is confident he won't be exposed during the investiture. His next goal is to obtain the High Shang Shen Xiao Talisman!</p><p>…</p><p>A flash of light. Qin Sang emerged from the teleportation array.  Before he could stand still, he was surrounded by several cultivators in armor.</p><p>He wasn't surprised. He presented a seal engraved with thunder runes to their leader and was allowed to pass.</p><p>The streets were sparsely populated, far less bustling than the immortal cities Qin Sang had seen before. He quickly lost interest, heading towards the city center, arriving shortly at a magnificent mansion. After being announced, he entered and met a stately Daoist.</p><p>"Daoist friend, are you Master Mingyue?"</p><p>The Daoist had sword-like brows and star-like eyes. His pupils held a glint of lightning, his gaze sharp and penetrating.</p><p>"It is I, Master Zhang," Qin Sang bowed, presenting the seal.</p><p>The person opposite him was a Master from the Left Thunder Mansion; this immortal city was also property of the Left Thunder Mansion.</p><p>The next initiation ceremony at the Left Thunder Prefecture will be in six months, while the Right Thunder Prefecture's ceremony is two years away.  Qin Sang therefore approached the Left Thunder Prefecture first.</p><p>He still used the pretext of seeking a place for his disciple in the ceremony to approach the Left Thunder Prefecture, thus arriving in this city.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, your devotion to your disciple is deeply felt. However, this mission requires infiltration into the demon kingdom, which is fraught with danger.  Perhaps, considering your disciple’s exceptional talent, this risk is unnecessary?”  Zhang Zhenren said softly.</p><p>The Left Thunder Prefecture allocates some places in each initiation ceremony to cultivators outside the sect, but these cannot be bought with spirit stones.</p><p>There are two ways to obtain a place in the esteemed Shangxiao ceremony.</p><p>One is for the initiate to undergo a talent test alongside the Left Thunder Prefecture's disciples.  Those with exceptional aptitude will be directly granted a place.</p><p>The second is for the initiate’s master to perform a service for the Left Thunder Prefecture, a task reputedly difficult and extremely dangerous.  Of course, the level of danger depends on the strength of the person undertaking it.</p><p>Qin Sang considered that the rules for the second-order Liu Jin Fire Bell ceremony would certainly be stricter than for the first-order. He planned to have Master Qi handle this when he sought advancement to the Right Thunder Prefecture; this time he would act personally.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, Zhenren Zhang, but I’ve made up my mind,”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  He was uncertain how the Left Thunder Prefecture tested aptitude and feared that displaying exceptional talent would attract unwanted attention and unforeseen complications; it was better to make an extra trip.</p><p>Seeing his resolve, Zhang Zhenren said no more. He flipped his hand and produced a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang took it.  The jade slip contained a map of the demon kingdom. It wasn’t detailed, but several locations were marked in blood-red, making them very prominent.</p><p>“This demon kingdom, we call it the Lei Ying Demon Kingdom.  Its ruler is a Golden-winged Thunder Eagle. The map marks the territories of the ruler’s direct descendants. We hope you can retrieve the ancestral blood essence of the Lei Ying royal family…”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren explained.</p><p>Qin Sang committed the map to memory, then pondered, “Must it be from a demon marshal-level royal?”</p><p>“No, any royal descendant will do, as long as enough ancestral blood essence is collected. However, do not underestimate this. Those granted royal status are all descendants with powerful bloodlines; the ruler values them greatly and they are well-guarded by powerful protectors.  Furthermore…”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren paused, “You’ve arrived a little late. Two other cultivators have already departed. You should set off as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Zhenren means we three are competing for one place?”</p><p>Seeing Zhang Zhenren nod, Qin Sang frowned.  The task was not difficult for him, but he feared being beaten to the punch.</p><p>Without further hesitation, Qin Sang took his leave and left the city.</p><p>This city is located southeast of Star Island Lake, bordering several demon kingdom territories.</p><p>Although both are under the jurisdiction of Mount Ju, there is no peace between humans and demons; conflict is frequent.</p><p>Flying eastward, within three days Qin Sang reached the Lei Ying Demon Kingdom. He had memorized the map and, based on the locations of the royal territories, formulated a preliminary plan.</p><p>…</p><p>More than ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared on the border of the Lei Ying Demon Kingdom and produced a jade bottle.</p><p>The bottle was filled with golden blood, shining brilliantly in the sunlight – the blood essence of the Golden-winged Thunder Eagle royals.</p><p>The ruler of the Lei Ying Demon Kingdom was only at the late Transformation stage. If Qin Sang used his full power, the entire kingdom wouldn’t be able to stand against him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn’t want to cause a commotion and attract suspicion. If not for the fear of being preempted, he would have waited longer.</p><p>After a few days of careful investigation, he learned that several royal descendants were traveling together. This was his chance to collect all the blood essence at once.</p><p>Those royal descendants were guarded by Transformation stage demon protectors, yet they couldn’t detect Qin Sang.  He obtained the blood essence without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren took the bottle of glittering golden blood, his eyes widening in astonishment as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“It is indeed royal blood essence.  I didn’t expect you to be so quick!”</p><p>He had expected it to take at least one or two months for a cultivator to infiltrate the demon kingdom cautiously, planning an escape route beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, “It was just good luck, I encountered a group of minor demons traveling.  I happen to be proficient in concealment techniques, and those demons' guards, while strong, lacked keen senses.  I exploited that weakness, rendering the minor demons unconscious before taking their blood.”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren understood. That explained why he hadn't received any reports of a disturbance in the demon kingdom.</p><p>“Please accept this Thunder Talisman. On the day of the initiation ceremony, your disciple can use this talisman to enter the mountain.”</p><p>Zhang Zhenren produced a silvery-white talisman, seemingly woven from threads of lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the talisman, thanked him, and returned to Star Island Lake, waiting quietly on Hu Zhong Island.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang frequently visited Master Qi, receiving guidance and steadily deepening his understanding of the art of refinement.</p><p>He was delighted to find that his experience could be used to nurture the Yunyou Sword.  With his improved understanding, Qin Sang had gained better control over the sword's condition, no longer feeling as clueless as before.</p><p>If his judgment was correct, within a century, the Yunyou Sword would give birth to a spirit embryo, thus advancing to a spiritual treasure!</p><p>He estimated a century because his skills were not yet profound enough; it might happen sooner.</p><p>Ordinarily, several centuries are insufficient to refine a spiritual treasure.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang had only recently broken through to the Transcendent God realm.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword was his innate magic weapon; the speed of its nurturing was directly related to his cultivation level.</p><p>Refining a spiritual treasure requires the right time, place, and people—a confluence of conditions is necessary for a spirit embryo to form.</p><p>Since the Yunyou Sword contained Yunyouzi's true spirit, the birth of a spirit embryo would naturally be easier than creating one from nothing.  If Qin Sang hadn't been worried about damaging Yunyouzi's fragile true spirit, it might have been even faster.</p><p>Furthermore, the Yunyou Sword's core was forged from the Yang Hun Wood, one of the ten divine trees, and Qin Sang had continuously refined it using the *Ji Yuan Technique*.  Finally, he saw a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Confirming this, Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>With the formation of a spirit embryo and the stabilization of the true spirit, he would no longer need to worry about using the sword in battle.</p><p>Moreover, the Yunyou Sword's direct transformation into a spiritual treasure meant it would be the most compatible weapon for him, surpassing any other spiritual treasure.</p><p>Of course, to fully utilize the sword's power, he must quickly restore his cultivation.</p><p>Following this, Qin Sang remained at Master Qi's residence, rarely going out. He spent his time in his cave, continuously using the *Ji Yuan Technique* to refine the Yunyou Sword, only leaving once for the auction held by the Ju Shan Society.</p><p>As the attendant explained, the auction items were traded either through bartering or with Daoist Court merits.</p><p>"Rewind Armor."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. A set of blue armor appeared on his body, completely covering him, including his face.</p><p>This armor, which he had acquired at the auction, was a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally desired armor comparable to a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even considering crafting it himself. However, after consulting Master Qi and considering his current financial situation, he abandoned the idea.</p><p>Beyond that, the auction held another pleasant surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained materials for two types of Emperor Bell talismans; he only lacked the Kun Earth Blood Sand.</p><p>Several months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In a certain watery area east of Star Island's lake, thousands of islands formed a cluster. Cultivators would rather take a detour, adding several days to their journey, than dare to trespass.</p><p>For this was the location of the mountain gate of the Lei Ting Left Manor, a top-tier sect of Star Island's lake!</p><p>Three days later, the Lei Ting Left Manor would hold its initiation ceremony.</p><p>For several days, the subordinate sects of the Lei Ting Left Manor had been sending newly inducted disciples.</p><p>Each initiation ceremony was a rare event.</p><p>On the largest island at the periphery stood a jade stele inscribed with the words "Lei Ting Left Manor."</p><p>A throng of people gathered before the stele, with streaks of light constantly flying in and out.</p><p>This island served as a welcoming island, where the disciples about to be initiated awaited.</p><p>Unnoticed, Qin Sang disembarked from a treasure ship, determined his direction, and headed towards the pavilion beside the stele.</p><p>"Which subordinate sect are you from? Why didn't your master come?" A female cultivator frowned at Qin Sang.</p><p>"My master has other matters to attend to. I came alone."</p><p>Qin Sang acted respectfully, presenting a thunder talisman.</p><p>The female cultivator, after examining the talisman, looked at Qin Sang in surprise, then gave him a token.  "Take this token to the other side of the welcoming island, and choose a room in the Jia-character building. Someone will come for you in three days. Oh, I forgot you haven't started your cultivation yet. I'll have someone take you there..."</p><p>A disciple of the Lei Ting Left Manor led Qin Sang to the building and settled him in.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The outer barrier was activated.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the door and saw a handsome young man with a sword at his waist smiling at him.  "Little brother, are you here for the initiation ceremony? Come with me."</p><p>The handsome young man collected a few more people, and together they boarded a flying boat, soaring into the sky toward the depths of the archipelago.</p><p>The flying boat flew among the clouds.</p><p>Soon, they saw dark clouds gathering ahead, accompanied by incessant thunder.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The flying boat plunged into the depths of the dark clouds and suddenly plummeted, landing on a dark island. </p>
