<h1>Chapter 1480: The Consummate Ice Soul Radiance (Supplementary Update)</h1><p>At this moment,</p><p>The vortex formed by the jade-white Xuan light faltered.</p><p>Inside the Xuan light,</p><p>Liuli, who had been trapped and unable to escape, merged her form with the phoenix-shaped sword, piercing through layers of Xuan light and charging out violently.</p><p>Simultaneously, a strange force took the opportunity to spread out.</p><p>The three snow pythons hidden within the python banner sensed this fluctuation and immediately felt an instinctive suppression, their hearts trembling.</p><p>‘Crackle…crackle…’</p><p>A layer of fine ice crystals climbed onto the python banner and rapidly spread across its surface.</p><p>Being trapped by the python banner was Liuli's own doing.</p><p>She had perfected the Ice Soul Radiance, and with this divine ability alone, she could suppress the snow pythons.  A surprise attack would allow her to counter Shang Lu.</p><p>The prerequisite was that Qin Sang and Shang Lu would need to engage for some time, allowing Liuli to find her opportunity.</p><p>However, Qin Sang temporarily adjusted the plan.</p><p>Liuli hadn’t used her full strength; the power of the Ice Soul Radiance was similar to when she attacked Qin Sang before, yet it still broke through the jade-white Xuan light with extreme speed.</p><p>This was naturally the result of the cooperation between the Heaven-Eye Butterfly and the Ice Soul Radiance!</p><p>Not only was Shang Lu caught off guard,</p><p>The guests were also completely baffled.</p><p>The python banner could be compared to a kind of formation and certainly had weaknesses, but they couldn't imagine how Liuli made such an accurate judgment so quickly that even Shang Lu couldn't react in time.</p><p>Shang Lu had no time to think.</p><p>At this moment, the three snow pythons could no longer control the situation. He had to return to stabilize the python banner and suppress Liuli again before he could concentrate on fighting Qin Sang.</p><p>“Move Mountain!”</p><p>Shang Lu roared.</p><p>The jade ruler violently trembled, and mountain peak patterns appeared simultaneously on all four sides, forming an entire mountain range when connected.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Shang Lu held nothing back. The jade ruler, transformed, its momentum soared, as if possessing the weight of a real mountain range, enough to suppress all things.</p><p>Its power was terrifying, its speed even more frightening.</p><p>In an instant, a ruler shadow appeared above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>This ruler shadow was still only the size of the original, but the mountain patterns inside became extremely clear, as if truly integrated with a mountain range, pressing down from the sky.</p><p>The various peaks of the Listening Snow Tower below trembled, and the lights in this area dimmed compared to the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang, in the forefront, clearly felt an astonishing pressure descending, his internal True Qi even feeling stagnant.</p><p>A tiny jade ruler, comparable to a mountain!</p><p>He and Liuli had naturally made preparations when formulating this plan.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword was already prepared.</p><p>The moment the jade ruler manifested, the Golden Sinking Sword surged upward, its sword light dazzlingly brilliant, charging forward relentlessly, branching into sword beams in mid-air.</p><p>This was already the rudimentary form of a sword formation, a sword formation that Qingzhu had independently comprehended. Unfortunately, it was incomplete. Qin Sang possessed the Seven Souls Killing Formation and wouldn't waste his energy creating a new sword formation.</p><p>The *Qingzhu Sword Scripture* remained at this stage, leaving its completion to future generations.</p><p>Seven sword beams transformed into seven gigantic pillars, firmly resisting the incessantly falling ruler shadow.</p><p>The ruler shadow was obstructed, the pressure still descended, but it was weakened by the sword beams.</p><p>Qin Sang formed a heart seal, activating the third seal of the *Seven Master Buddha Seal*, the Transferring Altar Seal, his blood energy surging, shaking off the pressure as his body moved like a fish.</p><p>Then, without hesitation, Qin Sang went straight for the python banner.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The sword beams shattered, the ruler shadow missing its target.</p><p>After Qin Sang escaped, the Golden Sinking Sword immediately moved out of the range of the ruler shadow, unaffected. Then, the sword body rapidly turned, not following its master, decisively and without delay, it stabbed directly at Shang Lu.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Around the arena, the guests were all tense.</p><p>No one had expected that what had been a lukewarm probing phase had suddenly erupted due to the change in the python banner, instantly escalating to this level.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was the first to react, pointing her jade finger downwards, using the Glacial Nether Nine Prohibitions.</p><p>A prohibition diagram appeared out of thin air, enveloping the falling ruler shadow and dissipating it to prevent it from crashing into the ground and causing unnecessary casualties.</p><p>She looked at Qin Sang, her eyes full of wonder.</p><p>Of all the cultivators present, she understood Qin Sang's strength best.  This person seemed wary of someone and clearly didn't want to reveal his identity.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was quite expectant, wondering what other methods Qin Sang had to resolve this situation.</p><p>On the other side, Hall Master Yin's gaze flickered, also fixed on the arena, his eyes showing no unusual expression. Shang Lu seemed to be at a disadvantage, but the victory was far from decided.</p><p>The python banner became the center of the battlefield.</p><p>The three snow pythons were restless, frantically activating the python banner to resist the spreading Ice Soul Radiance.  They were caught between two fronts. Liuli flew outwards on her sword, seemingly about to break free from the jade-white Xuan light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Shang Lu’s figure flashed, appearing instantly.  He disregarded his earlier vow not to attack Liuli, raising his jade ruler—now restored to its true form—to strike her.  Simultaneously, he swiftly formed hand seals, stabilizing the serpent flag and dispelling the ice.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Liuli ignored the jade ruler, her gaze fixed on Shang Lu.  A deep blue light flashed in her pure eyes, far more intense than on Demon Isle!</p><p>The Ice Soul Radiance reappeared!</p><p>This time, Liuli held nothing back.  After reaching its peak, the Ice Soul Radiance was revealed to the world for the first time!</p><p>A wave of sound rippled through the hall…</p><p>Instantly, the guests rose, including the Grand Elder and Yin Dianzhu. Some overturned tables and jade cups, completely unaware. Their gazes shifted from Qin Sang and Shang Lu, converging on Liuli, their faces etched with astonishment.</p><p>Tong Lingyu glanced at Shi Xue, thoughtful, murmuring, "Listen Snow Tower finally produced a true genius."</p><p>Shi Xue nodded gently, her face filled with pride.</p><p>Listen Snow Tower’s ultimate secret technique—the Ice Soul Radiance.  This power once held immense renown.  Listen Snow Tower’s founder used it to awe the Northern Sea. However, its cultivation was incredibly difficult.</p><p>Listen Snow Tower possessed this treasure, but later generations lacked the ability to pass it on, leading to their gradual decline.  Listen Snow Tower disciples could only cultivate the Ice Soul Radiance to near-perfection, yet that final step felt like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>For millennia, Liuli was the first, achieving this astounding feat at the early Yuan Ying stage. Of course, only Liuli knew that her master, Bing Yao, was the first.</p><p>After reaching its peak, the Ice Soul Radiance became even more mysterious and unpredictable.  Shang Lu only perceived its eruption at the very moment it occurred.</p><p>The audience outside the arena, after noticing Shang Lu's actions, realized the unseen change on the battlefield, deducing that Liuli had mastered the technique.  She had deliberately feigned weakness to lure him in.</p><p>No one anticipated that this sparring match would become a duel between Liuli and Shang Lu, leaving Qingfeng Daoist, the intended main character, as a mere spectator.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A burst of white light erupted from Shang Lu's chest, instantly illuminating everything. The source was a heart-protecting treasure, automatically activating to protect its owner. The moment the Ice Soul Radiance struck, it sprang into action.</p><p>A luminous mirror appeared before Shang Lu, only to be immediately engulfed by the Ice Soul Radiance.</p><p>Shang Lu, seizing the opportunity, retreated in disarray.</p>
