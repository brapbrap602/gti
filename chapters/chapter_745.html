<h1>Chapter 737: Breaking Through the Siege</h1><p>He had thought Qin Sang would be in grave danger facing two great demons, but unexpectedly, Qin Sang not only survived but also swiftly killed them. Even he himself would have found that difficult.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please lend me a hand!"</p><p>Master Yuansan's urgent voice transmitted through a secret message.</p><p>After slaying the Black Hawk, Qin Sang sensed that the other great demons, who had been approaching, were now deterred. Some retreated, while others hesitated. Only the lesser demons, lacking intelligence, continued to charge forward relentlessly.</p><p>Hearing Master Yuansan's message, Qin Sang turned his head and met the gaze of the giant turtle. His heart suddenly tightened.</p><p>Without much hesitation, Qin Sang surprisingly chose to go back, to rescue Master Yuansan.</p><p>The reason was simple: the fury in the giant turtle's eyes was almost overflowing.</p><p>Back then, because it wasn't adept at遁术 , it had been toyed with by Qin Sang. Now, its attempt to use demonic beasts to besiege and kill Qin Sang had backfired, with all the beasts slain.  A small insect, which it could easily crush, had repeatedly defied it. The giant turtle was on the verge of madness.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the giant turtle was about to lose all reason.</p><p>If it decided to pursue him relentlessly, even at the cost of letting Master Yuansan escape, Master Yuansan, upon realizing the animosity between him and the turtle, would certainly not hesitate to abandon him, leading the turtle away and escaping on his own.</p><p>Elsewhere, with his significantly improved遁术, Qin Sang would no longer fear the giant turtle's pursuit. However, they were deep within the beast tide, and breaking through in a short time was impossible. If entangled by the giant turtle, he would be in grave danger.</p><p>Going against the obvious course of action, before Master Yuansan discovered the truth, joining forces with them offered a greater chance of escape, or at least a way to hold out until reinforcements arrived.</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Believing Qin Sang had come to their rescue, Master Yuansan and the others were deeply grateful.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang dare to approach and provoke it, the giant turtle became even more enraged.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately jumped into the encirclement, standing alongside Master Yuansan, enduring the giant turtle's storm-like attacks. As expected, Master Yuansan and the others remained oblivious to the true situation.</p><p>With the addition of Qin Sang as a fresh combatant, and the loss of two great demons on the opposing side, the tide began to turn, and they finally saw hope of breaking free.</p><p>After a secret discussion with Master Yuansan, Qin Sang began to actively pull the battlefield, pushing towards the outer edge of the beast tide.  Chaos reigned all around, obscuring the situation elsewhere.  They feared attracting another great demon like the giant turtle.</p><p>Master Yuansan's strength was considerable, only slightly inferior to the giant turtle.  With Qin Sang's assistance, he could finally unleash his full power.</p><p>His primary magical treasure was a seven-story pagoda of astonishing weight. Its every movement threatened broken bones.  Even the giant turtle had to treat it with caution when it fell from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed a demon beast, slightly weaker than the strange flying fish, get struck and vomit blood when it failed to dodge in time.</p><p>Remembering the easiest path to break through, Qin Sang pointed the direction to Master Yuansan.  The giant turtle, leading the horde of demons, pursued them relentlessly, launching furious attacks, but it couldn't prevent the battlefield from gradually shifting outwards.</p><p>Their vision was stained crimson.</p><p>Qin Sang had lost count of how many demon beasts he had killed. He had also consumed several spiritual pills to replenish his True Essence.</p><p>"We're almost out!"</p><p>Suddenly hearing Master Yuansan's message, Qin Sang was slightly startled. Looking up, he saw they were indeed at the outer edge of the beast tide.  After tremendous hardship, they had finally broken through.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, after we break through, the Daoist and I will hold back this giant turtle. You seize the opportunity to escape and quickly seek reinforcements," Master Yuansan transmitted, his voice filled with exhaustion.</p><p>Before Qin Sang's arrival, they had already been trapped for some time. Master Yuansan, with the highest cultivation and abundant True Essence, could still endure, but the others were severely depleted, nearing exhaustion.</p><p>Several dozen breaths later.</p><p>A gap was torn in the outer edge of the beast tide.</p><p>Seeing the blue sky and ocean outside, some were moved to tears, marveling at the beauty of the world.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Master Yuansan roared, pouring True Essence into the small pagoda. The pagoda rapidly expanded, transforming into a thirty-foot stone tower, smashing heavily towards the giant turtle.</p><p>The stone tower was incredibly heavy and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Serpent unleashed their power, forcing back the surrounding demons. Seizing this opportunity, the others scattered like birds and beasts, each fleeing for their lives.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Master Yuansan also charged outwards.</p><p>As expected, the giant turtle ignored the others, focusing its pursuit on them.</p><p>Flying side-by-side, Qin Sang and Master Yuansan glanced back at the giant turtle. Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  He said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist Yuansan, this demon is relentless.  Earth Island is closest. I've just sent my subordinates to seek reinforcements. If we lure it towards Earth Island, and meet with the other Daoists coming to our aid, we might have a chance to kill it!"</p><p>Master Yuansan glanced at Wood Island, besieged by the beast tide, hesitated for a moment, then sighed, "I still have a few old friends separated on the island. I don't know how they are.  Without getting rid of this demon, I can't go back to save them. Let's do as you say, Fellow Daoist. I hope the Daoists on Earth Island arrive quickly."</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy.  "This beast tide is different from previous ones. I came from the deep sea, and there are more demon beasts constantly arriving.  After occupying Wood Island, they will certainly not stop there.  None of the Five Islands can remain untouched.  I have already explained the stakes. As long as those Daoists aren't short-sighted, they will certainly know what is important."</p><p>"Is what you say true, Fellow Daoist?  Is this only part of the beast tide?"</p><p>Master Yuansan was shocked, then sighed deeply. "The Five Islands have existed for long enough.  It seems the demon race can no longer tolerate them.  I wonder if the Five Islands can withstand this wave. Otherwise, they too will become history, like those small islands of the past…"</p><p>The two changed direction, flying towards Earth Island.</p><p>Although Qin Sang could use a faster speed to shake off the giant turtle, he had designs on it and didn't do so.</p><p>Over the vast sea, two streaks of light flew side-by-side, their speeds matching.  Behind them, the giant turtle tread water, as if walking on waves.  It seemed as if it could catch up at any moment, yet it always remained slightly behind.</p><p>It spat beams of profound light as attacks, almost all directed at Qin Sang, but each was easily dodged.</p><p>After a long chase, Wood Island gradually disappeared from view, leaving only the soaring demonic aura and the intermittent roars.</p><p>Reaching this point, the giant turtle hesitated.</p><p>It realized it had been toyed with again.  These two, on the surface appearing exhausted and near their limit, were actually full of energy.  After chasing for so long, their speed hadn't slowed at all.</p><p>Just as it hesitated, dozens of streaks of light appeared on the distant horizon, accompanied by piercing sounds of breaking air.</p><p>"Reinforcements have arrived!"</p><p>The two were invigorated, turning their heads in unison.</p><p>The reinforcements also noticed the unusual situation here.  Several streaks of light accelerated rapidly, rushing towards them.</p><p>The giant turtle sensed danger, plunged into the water, and paddled furiously with its four limbs, attempting to escape into the depths of the demon sea.</p><p>Qin Sang and Master Yuansan refused to let it escape, doing everything they could to stop it until the reinforcements finally arrived.  Under the siege of numerous cultivators, even the giant turtle's strong defense couldn't hold.  With a roar of unwillingness, it met its end in this place.</p>
