<h1>Chapter 1221: The Embryonic Form</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist, your words are reasonable. The plans of the Sin Abyss have been exposed, and we must also guard against their counterattack. The Old Demon Ye wouldn't dare to bring all his forces into the Blood Lake. Therefore, we should divide our forces into two groups. Half of us will enter the Blood Lake, which should be enough to contend with them, while the other half will remain stationed at the Celestial Plateau," said Daoist Zhenyi, pausing slightly before raising his whisk with a faint smile. "This humble Daoist is not as familiar with the Blood Lake as the rest of you, so it is my duty to stay behind and guard against the Sin Abyss's forces, while also probing for opportunities to counterattack. As for the matters of the Blood Lake, I leave them in your capable hands."</p><p>The Sin Abyss had been scheming for a long time, and there must be great benefits within the Blood Lake. However, it also represented immense risks. With the Sin Abyss's forces pressing close to the gates, the Celestial Alliance bore the brunt of the attack, unlike the Minor Cold Domain, which still had some room for maneuver. Daoist Zhenyi only sought to preserve the Celestial Alliance during his lifetime and had no interest in the treasures of the Blood Lake. Thus, he agreed without further comment.</p><p>Missing the opportunity to seek treasures, the two armored generals were somewhat discontent, but they followed Daoist Zhenyi's lead and would not openly oppose his decision in front of outsiders.</p><p>The Netherfiend Monarch also did not expect Daoist Zhenyi to be so unmoved. He cupped his hands and replied, "Rest assured, Daoist Zhenyi. We will not fail your expectations and will do our utmost to thwart the Old Demon Ye's schemes."</p><p>However, within the Ice Crystal Palace, there were two demon kings who did not belong to the Minor Cold Domain.</p><p>Qingjun spoke up at the right moment, "It is only thanks to the two of you that we were able to uncover the Old Demon Ye's plans. I wonder if the two of you, or perhaps other demon kings, would be willing to lend a hand and join us in entering the Sin Abyss to seek revenge against the Old Demon Ye for his relentless pursuit?"</p><p>The Netherfiend Monarch and the others had no objections. The more allies they had, the greater their chances of victory. In truth, they did not mind other factions sharing in the spoils. Whether they could repel the Old Demon Ye and snatch the treasures from the tiger's mouth was still uncertain. It would be foolish to start a conflict over treasures that were not yet theirs.</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head and immediately refused, "This king's injuries have yet to heal, and I urgently need to return to the mountains to recuperate. Until I am fully recovered, I dare not venture into dangerous places again, lest I never return. However, I can go back and ask the Feather King for his opinion."</p><p>Qin Sang did not directly state his position, "This king nearly lost his life to the Old Demon Ye. If there is a chance for revenge, I would naturally welcome it. However, Fellow Daoist Netherfiend mentioned that the Blood Lake will not open for some time. We can decide then."</p><p>Qin Sang kept silent about the Thunder-Swallowing Hawk Demon King being trapped in the Blood Lake. Even if the Thunder-Swallowing Hawk Demon King were still alive, the situation would not be optimistic. Knowing that there was a demon king trapped in the Blood Lake for two hundred years, on the brink of death, would surely stir anyone's greed. It would no longer be about rescuing someone but about using others to eliminate a rival.</p><p>...</p><p>The gathering of the two domains' leaders was not solely for this matter. Qin Sang and the Serpent King tactfully excused themselves early.</p><p>"I have asked the Feather King for his opinion. He has little interest in the Blood Lake, so it is a good opportunity to let the humans test the Old Demon Ye's strength. Humans are cunning, and those who are not of our kind surely have ulterior motives. If you decide to enter the Blood Lake yourself, be very careful to avoid being schemed against," the Serpent King advised Qin Sang out of goodwill.</p><p>After sharing hardships, he regarded Qin Sang as a close friend.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of guilt, wondering if the Serpent King would turn against him upon learning his true identity.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after returning to the Threefold Pass, Qin Sang received a message from his senior sister, informing him of the discussions in the Ice Crystal Palace. Qin Sang skimmed through it and, seeing that it had nothing to do with him, set it aside.</p><p>From then on, he remained at the Threefold Pass.</p><p>The Sin Abyss continued to deploy their forces at a steady pace, and the two sides engaged in back-and-forth battles. It was said that other battlefields were extremely intense, but at the Threefold Pass, both sides seemed to have an unspoken agreement to go through the motions, sending their disciples to fight a few skirmishes before retreating.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin both joked that they were benefiting from the Moonlight Demon King's presence, as they even had the capacity to support other fronts.</p><p>This situation was perfect for the younger generation to gain experience.</p><p>The demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea took turns coming to the Threefold Pass for training. With their lord's protection, as long as they were not too reckless, they had little to fear for their lives. They eagerly signed up, showing great enthusiasm.</p><p>Even the Serpent King sent some of his lesser demons from Huashan Mountain, asking Qin Sang to look after them.</p><p>The ones who made the most progress were undoubtedly Fat Chicken and Li Yufu.</p><p>Fat Chicken had fully stabilized his realm. With his innate thunder-controlling abilities and the treasures left by his mother, he was unmatched among his peers. His main task was to look after the lesser demons.</p><p>Li Yufu, having experienced the highs and lows of his master's death and receiving personal guidance from Qin Sang, found an opportunity for breakthrough during battle and returned to his cave to seclude himself for advancement.</p><p>Tan Yien, having learned that his father might still be alive, was greatly reassured and was now fully preparing to attempt forming his Golden Core.</p><p>After stabilizing his realm, Bai Hanqiu also voluntarily came to the battlefield to gain experience.</p><p>Disciples from the Demonic Flame Sect, such as Mei Gu, under Qingjun's care, also made progress.</p><p>The White Crane and his beloved wife were inseparable, deeply in love, and no longer showed any signs of the anxiety and misery they had before marriage, making Fat Chicken somewhat envious.</p><p>Under the Cloud Wanderer's command, the two senior officials, the old willow tree and the old macaque, took turns searching for caves overseas. They found a few, but none were satisfactory.</p><p>Qin Sang was also observing these demon beasts, deciding who to pass the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique to.</p><p>He admired the White Cat the most.</p><p>It had good talent, which was why the Cloud Wanderer had enlightened it and taken it as a disciple. Moreover, the White Cat was extremely diligent and wholly devoted to the Dao. Qin Sang saw a reflection of himself in it.</p><p>Passing down the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" would establish his own lineage among the demons and allow the Thousand Bamboo Sea to grow stronger through this technique. In doing so, he would not fail the Cloud Wanderer's trust.</p><p>As for the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture," after much deliberation, Qin Sang decided not to pass it on and would not leave it to the Green Goat Temple in the future.</p><p>The "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture" was different from the "Heavenly Demon Transformation." It was tied to the Slaughter Sword, a rare treasure.</p><p>He was unsure how many treasures with artifact spirits existed in ancient times, but their value was undoubtedly high.</p><p>If someone with ill intentions discovered that both techniques were in the Green Goat Temple, wouldn't it be a clear indication that the two fragments of the Slaughter Sword were in his possession?</p><p>This was not impossible.</p><p>The mysterious person who escaped from the Abyssal Ruins and the residual consciousness of the Azure Phoenix on the stone tablet both indicated that ancient cultivators had survived to the present day, hidden deeply and not isolated cases.</p><p>Among them, there were surely those who could recognize such treasures.</p><p>He did not want to invite disaster because of this.</p><p>These were the embryonic forms of Qin Sang's future forces, steadily growing.</p><p>Qin Sang remained stationed at the Cold Bell Formation, staying in his quiet chamber to cultivate. Cultivation was the foundation, and he also continued to study the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>In the Abyssal Ruins, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation had shown its might, helping him seize treasures from within the malevolent spirits.</p><p>However, while using the sword formation in battle, Qin Sang discovered previously unnoticed flaws and gaps. This was not yet the true power of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation!</p><p>It was a pity that he could not engage in a full-fledged battle with the Old Demon Ye, as that would surely provide deeper insights.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that progress could not be rushed and was not anxious.</p><p>Unknowingly, more than a year passed.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang quietly left the Threefold Pass and arrived at the Demonic Flame Sect.</p><p>Three days later, Xiang Qing returned to the mountains. On this day, the forces under the protection of the Green Sun Demon Sect would choose to go to the Green Sun Demon Sect to offer their tributes.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Confused, just as things had quieted down for a few days, the pandemic flared up again.</p>
