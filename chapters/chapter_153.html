<h1>**Chapter 146: Hunting Demons**</h1><p>**Chapter 146: Hunting Demons**</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden from view, arrived above the protective array of the Rift Valley. He removed his Falling Cloud Wings, revealing his figure.</p><p>The disciples of Mount Shaohua who were present became startled, but after seeing Qin Sang’s identity token they erupted into cheers of relief. They quickly opened the path in the array, allowing Qin Sang to enter, respectfully addressing him as “Martial Uncle.”</p><p>Although the fight between the White Rhino and the Spirit Stone Mine ended, the beast still remained nearby, glaring at the mine from a distance. The disciples were terrified of the animal launching a surprise attack and didn’t dare to deactivate the array. As a result, the mine’s operations had been forced to halt, causing them great unease.</p><p>“My name is Qin Sang and, by the Sect Master’s command, I have arrived to expunge the demon. Where is the person in charge?”</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings with a glance and observed two dozen disciples in the mine. The two with the highest cultivations, a middle-aged man and another with a face that showed more age (appearing to be at least fifty or sixty) were only at the twelfth level of the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>Normally, a Foundation Establishment disciple would be in charge of the mine, but now that the Spirit Stone Mine was nearly exhausted and no longer of great value, Mount Shaohua was unwilling to waste its resources on maintaining it. As a result, the disciples guarding the mine were all cultivators who had no hope of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The older-looking disciple rushed forward, bowing to Qin Sang and respectfully announcing, “Disciple Shen Youdao greets Martial Uncle Qin. Disciple Shen is in charge of the Spirit Stone Mine.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and instructed, “The rest of you, continue maintaining the array. Shen Youdao, explain to me everything you know about the White Rhino Demon Beast.”</p><p>Shen Youdao’s understanding of the White Rhino was limited. He had not dared to confront it head-on due to his lack of power, and as a result had remained safely within the array.</p><p>When the White Rhino attacked the Spirit Stone Mine, it had exhibited a demonic spirit of the early Demon Soul stage. The horn on its forehead could fire water bolts that were both fast and deadly, almost penetrating the mine’s defensive array. Shen Youdao did not know for certain if this was the beast’s innate divine ability, but aside from that, he could only describe the White Rhino as being extremely thick-skinned. The weapons of his fellow disciples had been ineffective against the beast, not even leaving a single scratch.</p><p>There was a significant difference in strength between the Qi Condensation and the Foundation Establishment stages, and there were some demon beasts with incredibly tough bodies, which was an advantage they possessed as a species. Therefore, it came as no surprise that their attacks had not been able to wound the rhino.</p><p>“Are you aware of why it has been attacking the Spirit Stone Mine?” Qin Sang asked casually.</p><p>When demon beasts reached the Demon Soul stage, they would gradually develop their spiritual intelligence, but they were still ruled by their instincts. However, once they had experienced some danger, their spiritual intelligence would rapidly develop, allowing them to intuitively understand the importance of practicing cultivation.</p><p>Unless a demon beast was presented with a significant temptation or driven by hatred, they would rarely leave their lairs.</p><p>Truly evil demon beasts that preyed on humans and were driven by greed were usually those of the low-level Mortal Demon stage.</p><p>The Mortal Demon stage was also when a demon beast was most vulnerable to being killed. As a beast, their existence within the territories of human cultivators was perilous, and not all demon beasts had been as fortunate as Little White, who had encountered the Di Liujiang transformation fluid.</p><p>The Spirit Stone Mine was nearing exhaustion, and only a few barely exploitable veins remained. Mount Shaohua had almost given up on it, so what could have attracted the attention of the White Rhino that made it so persistent?</p><p>Could there be some treasure in the mine that the demon beast had detected?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shen Youdao, causing him to break out in a sweat. He hastily replied, “Returning to Martial Uncle Qin, according to our conjecture, it is quite likely that the aura of the Spirit Eye in the mine is what lured it here. Some time ago, we were excavating a vein below the spirit vein and accidentally caused a cave-in. We nearly destroyed the Spirit Stone Mine’s companion spirit vein, resulting in the leakage of spiritual energy. Although this spirit vein is small, it has a Spirit Eye within it. Originally, there was a Martial Uncle guarding the mine who had opened up a cave dwelling here. If you go into the mine with me, Martial Uncle Qin, you will see it immediately.”</p><p>The two of them walked to the entrance of the cave dwelling. After scanning the area with his divine sense, Qin Sang stepped inside. Indeed, there was a Spirit Eye there. However, the spiritual energy within the cave dwelling was noticeably thinner compared to other Spirit Eye cave dwellings. The ground was covered in cracks, and the broken edges were fresh.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his investigation deeper into the mine and nodded secretly, indicating that what Shen Youdao had said was probably true. If there had actually been any treasure in the Spirit Stone Mine, it would have been discovered long ago by the Foundation Establishment disciple stationed there.</p><p>Treasure, companions, cultivation techniques, and favorable location - these applied to demon beasts as well.</p><p>The Lingshi mine had a strong allure even for monsters, so it was no wonder that the white rhino-like monster wouldn’t give up.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the disciple again for the exact location where he had the incident, and by the time they finished the chat, dusk fell. He asked Shen Youdao to keep watch of the array and await his signal; if the battle did not go well, he would use this as a retreat.</p><p>Then he activated his Hidden Cloud Wings and went invisible, quietly flying out of the Lingshi mine.</p><p>The Yun Cang Great Marsh was vast and deep blue, with water so deep you couldn’t see the bottom, so it was hard to tell where the white rhino-like monster was hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang flew invisibly to the place where the disciple was attacked, looked around and then left quietly. After searching the nearby area for a long time, he finally found a deserted island in the southeast.</p><p>The deserted island was not very big and there were no people in sight. Qin Sang didn’t touch a single tree or plant on the island; first, he set up a simple ban that blocked the island from view and from spiritual power fluctuations. Then he took out six Ten Directions Yama Banners and secretly placed the array on the island.</p><p>After making all the arrangements, Qin Sang stopped concealing his presence. Instead, he pinched a few hand symbols of the “Spirit Escaping Art”, hiding his aura so that it seemed like he was only at the Qi Refining stage, and then activated his Thousand Flight Shuttle and flew towards that region in a swaggering manner.</p><p>He flew from above, nearly reaching the Lingshi mine, but the lake surface below remained calm the entire time.</p><p>“Has the white rhino-like monster abandoned its attempt to snatch the mine?”</p><p>Just when Qin Sang was muttering to himself, he suddenly heard a “whoosh”.</p><p>The lake sprayed water and then a powerful surge of wind shot into the air.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression tightened. His divine sense had been tense the entire time and in the moment the change occurred, he noticed the enemy’s trace. A giant rhino shadow appeared on the water surface which had been motionless before, without any signs.</p><p>Compared to normal white rhinos, this monster was a whole round larger. Lurking at the bottom of the lake, it looked like a colossal beast, and its skin and rhinoceros horn both glistened with a jade-like glow that made it seem very strange, completely different from normal white rhinos.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A crystal water arrow shot out of the lake like a thunderbolt, straight at the Thousand Flight Shuttle in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang was well prepared, and the Thousand Flight Shuttle immediately changed direction, narrowly dodging this sneak attack.</p><p>Right after that, a burst of wind noises came.</p><p>That white rhino-like monster surfaced, raised its head and glared at the light in the air, its eyes ferocious. The light on its single horn flashed continuously, and water arrows shot out like a chain of pearls, blocking all the Thousand Flight Shuttle’s escape routes, bent on riddling Qin Sang with holes.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang thought for a moment and decisively withdrew the Thousand Flight Shuttle, calling out his Ebonywood Sword. He stepped onto the sword and broke through the blockade, turning around and fleeing to the deserted island as fast as possible, putting on the pretense of escaping for his life.</p><p>Before the white rhino-like monster showed up, Qin Sang didn’t notice it in the least, nor did he sense even a trace of monstrous aura. Evidently, this monster was also skilled at escape techniques, so he would trap it with the array first and then slowly deal with it.</p>
