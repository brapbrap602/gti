<h1>Chapter 2098: The Sixth Transformation Divine Ability</h1><p>Holy沐 Plain.</p><p>Holy Lake.</p><p>Minshu and the clan elders activated the grand formation. The Holy Lake was encircled by azure waterfalls, a curtain of water separating the inside from the outside, yet the water within flowed upwards towards the heavens. The relatives of the Clan Leader and the elders, as well as the most esteemed members of the Changyou Clan, had all taken refuge within the Holy Lake.</p><p>The Holy Lake could not accommodate many. As for the remaining clan members outside, they were left to their own fate.</p><p>Beyond the waterfall, a figure quietly materialized, blurred and indistinct. It was Qin Sang's Dharma Body. Arriving to probe the true strength of the sacred grounds, Qin Sang's Dharma Body witnessed this very scene.</p><p>Upon his shoulder, a multicolored light flickered, shaped like a butterfly—the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Man and butterfly observed the waterfall. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly spread its wings, the eye patterns upon them shimmering with a vibrant light that gradually deepened.</p><p>They attempted to penetrate the watery curtain, to peer into the Holy Lake's interior and discern the flow of the grand formation.</p><p>Under the power of the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability, the scene within their vision gradually sharpened. Their gazes pierced the water screen, revealing numerous palaces and pavilions constructed on the shores of the Holy Lake, teeming with Changyou Clan members.</p><p>Due to their long-held reverence and fear of the Holy Lake, none dared to step even half a foot into its waters, remaining on the shore, lest they desecrate their ancestors.</p><p>Shifting his gaze, Qin Sang noticed the stone statues along the Holy Lake's edge. After a moment of contemplation, he continued towards the Changyou Clan's ancestral hall at the lake's center.</p><p>Qin Sang did not detect any of the Changyou Clan's top experts on the shore. They were likely within the ancestral hall, where the core of the Holy Lake grand formation undoubtedly resided.</p><p>Without breaking the formation, it would be impossible to target the ancestral hall.  His gaze returned to the stone statues by the lake.</p><p>These statues depicted various Changyou Clan members, possibly past heroes or powerful figures.  However, they were certainly not mere objects of worship. Their auras were unique, intertwined with the grand formation. Even if they weren't the core, they were undoubtedly crucial components. Perhaps a breakthrough could be found here.</p><p>Qin Sang, patient, meticulously analyzed the flow of the Holy Lake grand formation. He also had another advantage.</p><p>After breaking through to the Sixth Transformation, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly hadn't manifested any new divine abilities like the previous Heaven's Eye Divine Light or the Separation and Reunion Divine Light. Initially, Qin Sang attributed this to the butterfly's past transformation.</p><p>After the Sixth Transformation, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's ability to devour tribulation lightning had noticeably increased. Perhaps it had embarked on a path drastically different from that of a normal Heaven's Eye Butterfly, thus preventing it from comprehending the typical divine abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't overly disappointed. For cultivators, realm was paramount.  A realm's elevation brought about a fundamental change in one's life essence. As long as the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could continue to ascend, even without any divine abilities, he would be content.</p><p>Gradually, however, Qin Sang discovered that this wasn't the case. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly hadn't failed to grasp a divine ability, but rather, the new ability lacked any overt manifestation.</p><p>After some experiments with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang realized that its ability to decipher formations, seals, and barriers had grown significantly stronger, and not merely in potency.</p><p>Previously, breaking a formation relied on the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability to perceive hidden secrets, locate weaknesses concealed by the formation master, unravel its structure, and then deduce a method to overcome it.</p><p>Now, with certain formations, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could traverse them directly. It seemed capable of merging into nothingness, traversing the void, and appearing directly within, without the need for laborious deciphering.  Thus, barriers in the mortal realm were no longer barriers.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Heaven's Eye Butterfly during its Sixth Transformation tribulation, its form flickering in and out of existence as if constantly shifting between reality and nothingness.</p><p>Ghost Mother had once said that a Seventh Transformation Heaven's Eye Butterfly was known as a Void Butterfly.  Qin Sang surmised that its ability was related to its name.</p><p>Could it be that the Sixth Transformation Heaven's Eye Butterfly already possessed the ability to traverse the void, or was it due to its transformation that it had prematurely grasped this divine ability?</p><p>However, in subsequent trials, Qin Sang found that this ability only worked on simpler formations and was ineffective against intricate and tightly woven ones. He suspected this was due to its insufficient cultivation. Moreover, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly couldn't fully control its divine ability, succeeding and failing erratically.</p><p>It was still uncertain whether the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was transforming itself into nothingness or traversing between nothingness and reality. Once it reached the mid-stage of the Sixth Transformation, its divine ability would undoubtedly improve. Only then could he thoroughly investigate.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's assistance, deciphering formations and seals became significantly easier for Qin Sang.</p><p>Examining the stone statues one by one, Qin Sang gradually discerned some clues, then fell into deep thought.</p><p>The statues materialized in his mind, forming a stone statue formation.  Then, one after another, they leaped from their pedestals, exchanging positions and shifting formations.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang grasped several key threads.  Using these as leads, he continued his deductions, making progress.</p><p>He discovered that while the Changyou Clan's Holy Lake grand formation was indeed profound, its power was limited. Given more time, he was confident he could deduce a method to break it.</p><p>Merely breaking the formation wasn't enough. He needed to act swiftly and decisively, controlling the ancestral hall before they could send a plea for help to the Zhuyan Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his deductions, believing it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, whenever he contemplated acting against the Holy Lake grand formation, a sense of unease lingered in his heart.</p><p>At his level of cultivation, illusions were impossible.  There must be something he had overlooked. Frowning, Qin Sang continued to scrutinize the Holy Lake, his gaze finally settling upon the Changyou Clan's ancestral hall.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He had finally detected the anomaly.</p><p>The ancestral hall's aura was linked to the Holy Lake grand formation, radiating a pure azure light. But at intervals, deep within the azure glow, a profound, dark blue shadow would flash, fleetingly.</p><p>The dark blue shadow's appearance was incredibly brief and subtle, easily overlooked.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what it was, but when he focused on it, a sense of foreboding instinctively arose.</p><p>It might be a remnant left by a powerful ancestor of the Changyou Clan or a hidden mechanism from the ancestral hall's construction in ancient times.</p><p>Regardless, the dark blue shadow was extremely dangerous. Qin Sang recalled Si Lu's words, that the ancestral halls of the various Foreign Tribes were far from simple.</p><p>Even if he could forcibly breach the Holy Lake grand formation, if he couldn't control the ancestral hall and prevent them from sending a message, it would be meaningless.</p><p>The path of breaking the formation seemed blocked…</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't discouraged.  He continued to ponder calmly. Just then, he realized another overlooked issue.</p><p>Had the Changyou Clan always kept the grand formation and the ancestral hall activated?</p><p>The Holy Lake grand formation's purpose was to protect the sacred grounds, so its constant activation was understandable. The ancestral hall, however, was a symbol of their ancestors. Even the esteemed Clan Leader of the Changyou Clan couldn't remain within the ancestral hall indefinitely, as that would be considered disrespectful to their ancestors.</p><p>Had those Changyou Clan experts, as if prescient, activated the ancestral hall in advance, guarding against someone?</p><p>Besides him, who else could pose a threat to the Changyou Clan's sacred grounds?</p><p>If they were guarding against the Storm Realm, unless the Changyou Clan already knew… that the Storm Realm possessed a Void Refinement stage expert!</p><p>Qin Sang's previous focus had been on breaking the formation. The discovery of the dark blue shadow brought this question to light. If this were true, was the Changyou Clan Leader's massacre in the Canglang Sea a deliberate attempt to lure him out?</p><p>This couldn't possibly be a scheme orchestrated solely by the Changyou Clan Leader.  What was their true objective?</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang's Dharma Body immediately contacted his true body and decisively left the Holy Lake, flying eastward on his sword.</p><p>…</p><p>Canglang Sea.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang's true body, combining his Dharma Body's discoveries and Si Lu's knowledge, concluded that a conspiracy likely lurked behind the Changyou Clan Leader's actions.</p><p>The question was, how had they been exposed?</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that news of his clash with Yuan Miao had leaked. The appearance of a powerful demon cultivator within the Foreign Tribes' territory was indeed conspicuous and likely to attract attention. The Changyou Clan might have learned of it through some channel, or perhaps someone had alerted them.</p><p>Within the entire territory of the Zhuyan Clan and its vassal clans, only the Storm Realm's demon cultivators were a significant force. It was plausible that the Changyou Clan Leader's suspicions had arisen from this.</p><p>Knowing full well that Qin Sang possessed the strength to defeat Yuan Miao and had allies, the Changyou Clan Leader still dared to confront him. There must be someone backing him.</p><p>Perhaps, realizing he could no longer swallow the Storm Realm alone, the Changyou Clan Leader had changed his tactics and actively sought outside assistance. Another reason could be his own advancement to the second level of the Empty Realm. He now possessed the strength to cooperate with other powerful clans without fear of being overtaken.</p><p>The Changyou Clan Leader's actions had revealed the Storm Realm's existence to other tribes, undoubtedly complicating the situation.</p><p>With the situation unclear, Qin Sang couldn't devise an effective strategy. He could only force out the Changyou Clan Leader's backers first and adapt as needed.</p><p>Only his Dharma Body and Si Lu's companion beast had revealed themselves. If the Changyou Clan Leader's backers proved too powerful, they could still escape.</p><p>…</p><p>On the battlefield, Zai Zhen emerged from the shadows. He lamented Min Zhuo's weakness, showing signs of defeat before forcing out their opponent's true strength.  He also sighed at Qin Sang's decisive action, attacking without hesitation, leaving their prepared arguments unused.</p><p>The appearance of Min Zhuo's backer surprised neither Qin Sang nor Si Lu, and they showed no intention of stopping.</p><p>The Crimson-Feathered Bird plunged into the jade bowl, the remaining half-bowl of water becoming the bird's bath, leaving Min Zhuo dumbfounded.</p><p>Each crimson feather transformed into raging fire.  Flames erupted from the jade bowl, fire streams scattering and spreading rapidly along the surging flood, immediately overpowering its momentum.</p><p>Although Si Lu's breakthrough had only preceded Min Zhuo's by a short time, their respective inheritances were incomparable.  With just a single companion beast, Si Lu was already gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Of course, this was also because Min Zhuo's greatest fear was Qin Sang, devoting most of his attention to guarding against the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body.</p><p>As expected, with the jade bowl entangled by Si Lu, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body effortlessly pierced through the flood, its intense azure light stinging Min Zhuo's eyes.</p><p>In truth, the Changyou Clan also possessed inherited treasures. However, Min Zhuo's time refining them was short, and he hadn't fully grasped their intricacies.  Even if he had, facing the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body, he lacked confidence.</p><p>Fortunately, Zai Zhen didn't continue to watch idly. He finally made his move.</p><p>Zai Zhen opened his mouth to speak, but seeing the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body's overwhelming might, he knew that if he didn't act, Min Zhuo would likely be doomed.  With no other choice, he clenched and unclenched his hand, releasing three golden lights.</p><p>Within the golden lights were three golden rings, flying towards the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body with fierce momentum, targeting its claws and head.</p><p>This treasure was called the Three Hardship Rings, possessing the ability to trap enemies.  If bound by the rings, the enemy would effectively bear three shackles, suffering torment and finding it extremely difficult to escape, hence the name 'Hardship.'</p><p>Contrary to Zai Zhen's expectations, upon seeing the Three Hardship Rings, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body's eyes flashed with disdain. It powerfully flapped its phoenix wings.</p><p>Intense azure light erupted from its wings, and unusual lightning threads flickered between its azure feathers. Unlike the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body's inherent lightning, these threads were deeper in color, exuding a greater sense of weight.</p><p>This was precisely the Azure Phoenix True Lightning that Qin Sang had infused into the Dharma Body beforehand.  With the might of the Azure Phoenix True Lightning, even without relying on any spiritual treasures, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body's strength was unparalleled.</p><p>Now, fueled by the Azure Phoenix True Lightning, the Dharma Body radiated dazzling lightning. Min Zhuo and Zai Zhen only saw a flash of azure lightning streak between the three golden rings with impeccable precision.</p><p>The lightning's speed far exceeded their expectations. Before the three golden rings could react, they were effortlessly bypassed. The distance between the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body and Min Zhuo drastically shortened, and the lightning's speed remained undiminished.</p><p>At this moment, Min Zhuo felt as though the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body was already upon him, his heart filled with dread.</p><p>He never expected that with Zai Zhen's appearance, his situation would become even more perilous.</p><p>The bracelet on Min Zhuo's wrist flashed brightly, releasing eight white lights that transformed into eight jade screens.  The patterns carved on each screen were similar, depicting scenes of rivers, lakes, and seas.</p><p>He deployed these screens to obstruct the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body, but neglected another enemy.</p><p>By now, the void had transformed into a sea of fire. From deep within the flames, a white weasel peered out, its eyes fixed on Min Zhuo. Seizing the opportunity, it abruptly leaped out, its form splitting into two, then four, ultimately multiplying into sixty-four, completely encircling Min Zhuo.  Then, they all pounced.</p><p>Their positioning was meticulous, forming a specific formation. Trapped within, Min Zhuo felt his body grow heavy, his consciousness becoming hazy.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Body was now within striking distance, exacerbating Min Zhuo's predicament.</p><p>"I'll stop the demon bird!"</p><p>Zai Zhen finally realized the gravity of the situation, hastily transmitting his voice as he threw out another treasure.</p><p>This object was neither wood nor metal, resembling a square, pitch-black piece of bark. Deep carvings adorned its surface, like knife marks, forming simple yet profound patterns.</p><p>Seeing this object, a sense of familiarity washed over Qin Sang. In an instant, he understood its nature. It should be something akin to a human cultivator's talisman.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The bark spontaneously ignited, but the flames were unnatural, spewing forth streams of golden liquid that flowed in a specific pattern, forming a circular golden design in the air.</p><p>The golden design covered the sky, resembling a grand formation diagram.  At its center was a gigantic, golden hand, its five fingers outstretched, reaching for the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body.</p><p>Compared to this palm, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body appeared minuscule.</p><p>As a powerful gust of wind swept forth, the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body showed no fear, emitting a long cry. The lightning threads on its body surged towards its claws, transforming them into lightning claws!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Zai Zhen watched as the golden hand was blasted with a hole by the terrifying lightning. The Azure Phoenix Dharma Body pierced through, and Min Zhuo was in mortal danger!</p><p>At the critical moment, the sea churned violently, and a dark golden short spear shot out.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The spear collided with the lightning claws, finally halting the Azure Phoenix Dharma Body's assault.</p><p>There was indeed someone else!</p><p>The Azure Phoenix Dharma Body raised its head, its sharp gaze fixed on the horizon.  It made no further move.</p><p>Zai Zhen finally breathed a sigh of relief, his voice laced with malice, "Min Zhuo called for help, I initially didn't believe outsiders would dare to cause trouble here, but it seems it's true!"</p><p>()</p>
