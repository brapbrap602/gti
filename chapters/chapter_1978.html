<h1>Chapter 1969 Intervention</h1><p>The Emperor was gravely ill.  All factions focused their attention on the struggle for the throne.  Unexpectedly, the catalyst for change came from without.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Yu Lang’s hand trembled, and the teacup fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.  Heedless of the tea splashing onto his clothes, Yu Lang stared intently at several names on the urgent report.</p><p>Qi Prefecture, Ci Zhen Prefecture, Zhong Ning Prefecture…</p><p>Without exception, all were prefectural cities of Lu Province.  The focal point of the Great Liang Kingdom's attack was Lu Province!</p><p>And the prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture in Lu Province was Chen Zhenqing, Master Chen!</p><p>The mortal world, unlike the world of cultivators, lacked communication talismans and spells.  War reports were delayed.  With the Great Liang Kingdom’s invasion, several prefectures were almost instantly isolated. By the time the news was sent out and reached the capital, several days had passed. No one knew whether Lu Province's official army could withstand this surprise attack, or what the current situation in the city was!</p><p>Within the Yan Kingdom, there were four provinces bordering the Great Liang Kingdom.</p><p>Among the four provinces, although Lu Province had experienced several wars, its strategic position wasn't the most crucial.  Logically, if the Great Liang Kingdom were to invade the Yan Kingdom, Lu Province wouldn't be their first choice.</p><p>Precisely because of this, the Yan Kingdom hadn’t deployed its largest force in Lu Province.</p><p>The Crown Prince, after all, was not the Emperor. Interfering with military power was a grave taboo.  Yu Lang, operating in secret, could at most dispatch more garrison troops to Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>The Great Liang Kingdom’s surprise attack on Lu Province had shown absolutely no prior warning.  Yu Lang, close to the central government, hadn't seen any related intelligence, indicating how covert this attack was.</p><p>Caught off guard, how long could Lu Province hold out?</p><p>How long could Zhong Ning Prefecture hold out?!</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>A woman dressed in goose-yellow brocade pushed open the door and entered, carrying a soup bowl.  The woman, possessing exquisite features, carried herself with dignity and a gentle expression.  She was Yu Lang’s lawfully wedded wife, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, surnamed Mu, named Yun Wan.</p><p>“Husband, drink your ginseng soup.”</p><p>Mu Yun Wan glanced at the porcelain shards on the floor and set down the soup bowl, speaking softly.  At this moment, she caught Yu Lang’s gaze, and her heart abruptly tightened.</p><p>What kind of gaze was this?  Lost, helpless, panicked, terrified…</p><p>In the court, no matter how perilous the situation, her husband had always appeared composed. She had never seen such an expression on him.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Mu Yun Wan extended her delicate hand and gently grasped Yu Lang’s, attempting to soothe him with her tenderness.</p><p>Yu Lang seemed to awaken from a dream. "Is the messenger still outside?"</p><p>Mu Yun Wan hummed in affirmation.</p><p>Yu Lang abruptly stood, swiftly removed his official robes, pushed open the back window, and, instead of using the main door, attempted to climb out.</p><p>Just as he was about to climb out, Yu Lang seemed to remember something and turned back to instruct, “When Tao Teng arrives, tell him to wait for me in the study.  I'll go to the Eastern Palace after I return!”</p><p>Even without using spiritual power, Yu Lang was a genuine Innate Realm expert, his lightness skill honed to perfection.  He quickly left these words and, like a nimble cat, vanished into the darkness.</p><p>Mu Yun Wan stood by the window, clutching the window frame tightly, her face filled with worry as she gazed into the pitch-black night.</p><p>…</p><p>By the Jade Waist Lake.</p><p>Qing Yang Tea House.</p><p>Yu Lang, having left the Qin residence, rushed here without stopping, using his lightness skill the entire way.</p><p>The urgent message was placed before Xiao Wu.</p><p>Xiao Wu wasn't as panicked as Yu Lang. After a moment of silence, she said, "Master won't leave."</p><p>Yu Lang understood his senior sister’s meaning.  As if answering her, and as if comforting himself, he said, “Zhong Ning Prefecture is a prefectural city. Even if besieged by the enemy, it shouldn’t fall so quickly…”</p><p>However, they both understood that the Great Liang Kingdom’s sudden border incursion must have been planned for a long time, and they were certain to press their advantage with all their might to gain the greatest benefit!</p><p>On the border, apart from several major fortified passes, the so-called prefectural cities were somewhat lacking. Some had been rebuilt on the ruins of old cities, and their walls were probably only slightly stronger than those of ordinary county towns.</p><p>Yu Lang's voice was strained. “Master has a protective talisman.”</p><p>“Master won't leave!”</p><p>Xiao Wu repeated.</p><p>The protective talisman they had given their Master was only meant to guard against accidents and withstand cultivators’ spells.  They could refine better talismans, but the gods and spirits wouldn’t permit it.</p><p>Once surrounded by an army and facing blades and weapons, a protective talisman wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>Furthermore, given Chen Zhenqing's character, he would definitely choose to live and die with the people!</p><p>"I'm going to Zhong Ning Prefecture!"</p><p>Xiao Wu pointed at her brow.  Spiritual light flashed, emitting a ‘bang’ sound.  A complex rune appeared and then abruptly shattered, as if breaking a seal.  Xiao Wu's cultivation was fully restored!</p><p>In the next instant, Xiao Wu vanished from the spot.</p><p>‘Splash… splash…’</p><p>The lake water rippled, the sounds of the night exceptionally clear, carrying into the Qing Yang Tea House.</p><p>The room was unlit.</p><p>After Xiao Wu left, Yu Lang sat alone in the darkness.  At this critical juncture of changing political tides, he remained there for a long time.</p><p>His senior sister had gone to Zhong Ning Prefecture to save someone. A cultivator interfering in mortal affairs was precisely what he had abhorred most before.</p><p>Yet, at this moment, he couldn’t stop her, dared not stop her.</p><p>No matter what, he couldn’t bear to watch Master Chen go to his death.</p><p>Even though he knew clearly that if Master Chen insisted on staying, choosing to share Zhong Ning Prefecture’s fate, his senior sister would definitely act, forcing back the Great Liang Kingdom's army.</p><p>The mortal realm’s situation, the fate of countless people, would be altered by a single cultivator.</p><p>Yu Lang slowly bowed his head, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>A gust of wind blew in.</p><p>A figure appeared beside him, the young man surnamed Shi.</p><p>Yu Lang hadn't just not stopped his senior sister, he'd made a second arrangement. If his sister couldn't break the seal, he would ask Brother Shi to go to Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>Understanding the situation, the young man said:</p><p>"Still can't figure it out? Heh, you'll learn later, there are many things in this world that you can't figure out!"</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi sighed softly and patted Yu Lang’s shoulder. "You should go back! If Master Chen dies on the battlefield, it can be considered a worthy death.  If you but ask, I’ll slaughter the entire Great Liang army for you, but then your entry into the mortal world would have been meaningless.  I think Master Chen, in the afterlife, would rather see you assist the Crown Prince in ascending the throne, strengthening the Yan Kingdom, and defeating the Great Liang Kingdom honorably, avenging him!"</p><p>…</p><p>The official road was filled with refugees.</p><p>Tonight, the darkness was especially deep.  The people were exhausted, moving forward listlessly.  As long as they had a sliver of strength left, they dared not stop. The enemy army was right behind them; they could only flee, flee towards the interior.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew in the sky, her gaze scanning the ground below.</p><p>Upon entering Lu Province, she followed the official road leading to Zhong Ning Prefecture. If Chen Zhenqing’s family had escaped from Zhong Ning Prefecture, they would definitely take this road.</p><p>At this moment, she finally sensed a familiar aura within her spiritual perception, and immediately descended.</p><p>By the side of the main road, a carriage was slowly moving forward.  The carriage didn't appear particularly luxurious. The driver was a burly man with a fierce gaze, clearly someone not to be trifled with.</p><p>A mother and daughter sat inside the carriage.</p><p>The daughter nestled in her mother's arms, asleep.</p><p>The mother, holding her daughter, was pale and tear-stained.  Her body swayed with the carriage's bumps as she stared blankly into the darkness ahead, her eyes unfocused.</p><p>This mother and daughter were Chen Zhenqing's wife, Chen Liu Shi, and their daughter.</p><p>“Aunt!”</p><p>Chen Liu Shi, not noticing the sudden appearance of Xiao Wu, was startled by the call and turned her gaze before regaining her senses.</p><p>A faint light illuminated the carriage.</p><p>Recognizing Xiao Wu, Chen Liu Shi’s face was filled with surprise. “Xiao Wu, why are you here?”</p><p>"Aunt, Master didn’t leave the city with you?" Xiao Wu had already had a premonition, but facing the reality, her heart was still incredibly heavy.</p><p>"He found an opportunity to send us out of the city, but he refused to leave himself, vowing to live and die with the people in the city!"</p><p>Chen Liu Shi hugged her daughter tightly, tears welling up again. Her voice was filled with sorrow, but also with a hint of strength and pride.  “He did it. He fulfilled the vow he made all those years ago!”</p><p>Xiao Wu remained silent, looking towards Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>The scene of Master Chen declaring his aspirations after drinking at Qing Yang Temple all those years ago was vivid in her mind!</p><p>Chen Liu Shi, remembering something, reached into her bosom and tremblingly took out a letter.</p><p>Throughout their arduous escape, this letter had been meticulously preserved, without a single crease.</p><p>“This is what Zhenqing left for you.”</p><p>Xiao Wu took the letter, unfolded it, and found only eight characters written on it — To die with the people, I die without regret!</p><p>The ink was slightly smudged, evidently hastily folded before it had dried, but one could still sense the powerful conviction and resolve within the bold strokes.</p><p>“Xiao Wu…”</p><p>Chen Liu Shi hesitated and asked, “Are you… not ordinary people?”</p><p>Xiao Wu, so far away in the capital, had suddenly appeared here.  Even riding the most divine steed, such speed would be impossible.</p><p>Back in Qi Pai Village, they had already believed that the Daoist Qing Feng possessed an extraordinary air, a reclusive expert, and that his two disciples were also exceptional individuals.</p><p>However, Chen Liu Shi didn't know just how extraordinary they were.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu nod in acknowledgement, Chen Liu Shi’s eyes gradually brightened. "Can you…"</p><p>"I'll go to Zhong Ning Prefecture right now!"</p><p>Xiao Wu left a restrictive spell on the carriage and then continued to fly towards Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>With her cultivation, the journey from here to Zhong Ning Prefecture would take but an instant, yet she deliberately slowed down, as if hesitating, afraid to approach the city.</p><p>Darkness enveloped the land.</p><p>Xiao Wu flew alone, her speed having slowed to that of a bird.  Finally, she saw the prefectural city of Zhong Ning.</p><p>She still remembered how, when she visited years ago, Zhong Ning Prefecture, having recuperated for many years, had gradually regained its vitality and shown signs of prosperity.  Now, within the city, countless torches illuminated the night sky, also illuminating the broken walls and rubble, and the mountains of corpses and seas of blood!</p><p>Xiao Wu landed on a hill outside the city.</p><p>Standing there, she silently gazed at the city.</p><p>She tightly clutched the letter Master had left. The paper was the finest Xuan paper of the Yan Kingdom.  Blown by the night wind, it rustled, like a white butterfly fluttering up and down.</p><p>Xiao Wu remained motionless, like a statue.</p><p>Within the city, she sensed Master’s aura, but it was devoid of life.</p><p>She was too late!</p><p>Anger, grief, regret, self-blame, sorrow…</p><p>Xiao Wu couldn't distinguish how many emotions she felt.  It was too complex, more complex than when she was betrayed by Meng Yu Su.  She dared not enter the city to face it.</p><p>What should she do now?</p><p>Seek revenge?</p><p>Xiao Wu felt lost, looking at the eight characters in her hand.</p><p>She could easily slaughter the entire Great Liang army, but what would that achieve?</p><p>This was a conflict between two mortal kingdoms.  If she forcibly sought a culprit, from the monarch down to the soldiers, everyone could be considered culpable, but no one had a personal vendetta against Master Chen.</p><p>Moreover, Master Chen had the chance to leave, but he gave it up, choosing to face death calmly.</p><p>He died for his country, died for the people, and declared that he died without regret!</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>The night wind intensified.</p><p>"Master, what should I do?"</p><p>Xiao Wu stared blankly at the deep night sky. Finally, she moved, taking a step down the hill.  She didn't use any teleportation techniques, merely concealing her presence, walking step by step towards the city.</p><p>The city gates were smashed, and the Great Liang soldiers hadn't bothered to repair them, not intending to stay here permanently.</p><p>Along both sides of the main road, corpses were dragged to the roadside and piled together, blood flowing like rivers.</p><p>Xiao Wu walked along the bloody path towards the prefectural government office.</p><p>The city was unusually noisy. The Great Liang soldiers were celebrating their victory amidst the carnage.</p><p>Xiao Wu’s eyes were vacant, as if oblivious to these sounds.  She arrived at the government office unconsciously.</p><p>One of the government office’s doors was also smashed. The guards at the entrance didn't notice a woman brush past them and walk inside.</p><p>The main hall of the government office.</p><p>A large sand table was set up, displaying the entire terrain of Lu Province.</p><p>There was only one person in the hall, the general of the Great Liang Kingdom who had led this army. Holding a candle, he carefully examined the sand table, engrossed in analyzing the war situation.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded from outside.</p><p>Someone reported from outside, “Reporting to General, the identities of those corpses have been confirmed.”</p><p>The general straightened up and said in a deep voice, “Are you certain it’s truly the Prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture, not a body double?”</p><p>The voice outside replied, “It is indeed him! His name is Chen Zhenqing, a man of great prestige in Lu Province!  Advisor Zuo asks if we should take the body or sever the head and hang it at the camp gate.  It would certainly greatly demoralize the enemy!”</p><p>“Chen Zhenqing, although I am from Great Liang, I have also heard of this man. He loves his people as his own children.  There were oversights during the siege, allowing many officials and nobles to escape, but this man, as the chief official, chose to stay and die on the battlefield with his soldiers. It seems the rumors are true! Such a virtuous man, whose integrity remains even in death, how can we allow others to insult him?!”</p><p>The general paused for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "Let him be buried in peace. Give him a proper burial!"</p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p>The person outside acknowledged the order and left.</p><p>…</p><p>The tomb of Chen Zhenqing, Prefect of Zhong Ning Prefecture, Lu Province, Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Xiao Wu stood before the tomb, looking at the grave the Great Liang soldiers had erected for Master Chen.</p><p>She had witnessed the entire process, appearing only after the soldiers had left.</p><p>After a long period of mourning and paying her respects to Master Chen, Xiao Wu’s grip on the letter gradually loosened.</p><p>Finally, she meticulously folded the letter and carefully put it away, then walked out of Zhong Ning Prefecture.</p><p>Leaving Master Chen forever in this land was perhaps his best resting place.</p><p>Xiao Wu found her aunt and, using her abilities, brought them back to Qi Pai Village and settled them in.</p><p>She stood at the foot of the mountain, looking up at Qing Yang Temple on the mountain, hesitating.  In the end, she didn't go up, but summoned a white cloud and flew away.</p><p>Above the white cloud.</p><p>Xiao Wu gazed at the vast land below, her eyes still filled with a sense of bewilderment, unsure of whether what she had done was right or wrong.</p><p>Her flight had no direction.</p><p>She hadn't even noticed that she had deviated from the direction of the capital, and she didn’t know where she had flown to.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Wu's eyes flickered, and she looked towards the distance, a ripple finally appearing in her wooden expression.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Instantly traversing numerous mountain ranges, Xiao Wu appeared above a mountain hollow.</p><p>A moment later, a white figure suddenly leaped out of the hollow and into Xiao Wu’s arms, letting out a cry filled with affection and joy.</p><p>“Ying ying…”</p><p>It was a white fox.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Unknowingly, another Spring Festival arrived.</p><p>Wishing all readers a happy New Year, a prosperous Year of the Dragon, and may you soar to the Nine Heavens!</p><p>I'll also take three days off to rest and spend time with my family.</p>
