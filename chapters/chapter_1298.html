<h1>Chapter 1290: An Opportunity</h1><p>Chapter 1290: An Opportunity</p><p>Qin Sang, Jing Yu, Elder Ji of the Tianxing Alliance, and Cang Qing, a close confidant of the Tunyou Demon Lord, were the only four on this journey.</p><p>The output of these mines is quite valuable. The Two Realms Alliance attaches great importance to them. Qing Jun sent Qin Sang himself, naturally, for a share of the spoils, which would benefit the future development of his sect.</p><p>The recapture of the southern foot of the Tianxing Plateau was a joint effort of the Tianxing Alliance and the Xiao Han domain.  Qin Sang has always been aligned with Qing Jun. Their interests are something that Zhen Daochang and the Tunyou Demon Lord must consider.</p><p>As the saying goes, destruction paves the way for creation.  The spoils of war cannot be returned to their original owners directly; their distribution needs to be negotiated based on merit. This is an opportunity for Qin Sang and the Qingyang Sect.</p><p>Qing Jun isn't particularly interested in these matters, but knowing Qin Sang's ambition to establish a sect, he is doing his best to help him achieve it.</p><p>“The grass is fragrant. It's been a long time since I've smelled the refreshing scent of the steppe,” Elder Ji took a deep breath, a wistful look on his face.</p><p>Cang Qing chuckled, “Those Yuan Ying old ghosts are cunning and value their lives above all else.  However, during the escape, the lower-level cultivators of the Abyss of Sin didn't have many ways to escape, resulting in countless casualties. After this battle, the Abyss of Sin's foundation is shaken. Their losses are devastating, and they will likely be confined to their lair for a hundred years, unable to cause any further trouble. During this century, Elder Ji, you can freely roam the wilderness.”</p><p>“Don't laugh at me, but I once thought we couldn't hold Tianxing City and would become homeless,” Elder Ji sighed, gazing at the surrounding scenery, both unfamiliar and familiar.</p><p>The war, which had lasted intermittently for two hundred years, had changed so much.</p><p>“Qin Daoyou,” Elder Ji, regaining his composure, suddenly turned to Qin Sang, “I heard that several of your disciples are talented young men, calling themselves disciples of the Qingyang Sect.  You must intend to establish a sect, haven’t you decided yet where to establish the Qingyang Sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang, startled by the sudden question, then understood, smiling faintly, “The top-tier spirit veins in Bei Chen Realm are all owned. While I have the ambition to found a sect, I lack the means.”</p><p>“That's no problem!”</p><p>Elder Ji's eyes lit up. “Qin Daoyou personally recovered the southern foot of the Tianxing Plateau, you must have discovered that there are several top-tier spirit veins there. Some sects originally built on those veins were driven away by the Abyss of Sin, and, most heartbreaking of all, some were slaughtered by the Abyss of Sin, nearly exterminated. As long as you are interested, I will report this matter to the Daochang.  Your great achievements far outweigh a mere spirit vein.  If there are any surviving descendants of those sects, I can mediate.  The cultivators of our Tianxing Alliance are all righteous; as long as you agree to take care of them in the future, or accept them as disciples, they will be more than happy.”</p><p>While speaking, Elder Ji subtly glanced at Jing Yu.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance already knew Jing Yu's background.</p><p>This demon king’s power is also unfathomable. Even when he was secluded in the Wuyaya Valley, he had a fearsome reputation.</p><p>What shocked them was that since the Battle of Shuangjing Mountain, Jing Yu has been following Qin Sang, inseparable, seemingly acting as Qin Sang's right-hand man.</p><p>It should be noted that after the counteroffensive of the Two Realms Alliance, the Feather King ordered the Tianyao Hill to withdraw and observe from the sidelines.  The Two Realms Alliance offered generous rewards but failed to enlist a single demon king.</p><p>This led many to speculate about their relationship.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun’s close relationship is well-known.  Dongyang Bo even publicly revealed that Chen Yan, the mysterious beauty who appeared briefly in the past, also seems to have a very deep connection with Qin Sang.</p><p>Because of this, people admire Qin Sang's charm, which is so great that even female demons are captivated by him.</p><p>The bolder among them suspect that Jing Yu has been subdued by Qin Sang as a spirit beast. The more sensible ones, recalling the Battle of Blood Lake, believe that Jing Yu's purpose is to repay a favor.</p><p>Regardless, their friendship is undeniably deep. If Qin Sang can be persuaded to establish his sect on the Tianxing Plateau, he would be gaining more than just Qin Sang himself.</p><p>“All our Tianxing Alliance members would welcome Qin Daoyou with open arms,” Elder Ji hinted.</p><p>Seeing Elder Ji trying to win Qin Sang over in front of him, Cang Qing's expression stiffened, secretly annoyed that Dongyang Bo and Qin Sang were at odds, giving others a chance to exploit this.</p><p>Cang Qing coldly snorted, “The Abyss of Sin is ambitious and will inevitably make a comeback one day.  The Tianxing Plateau is not a good choice, it risks being drawn into war. Although Xiao Han domain is small, it can easily accommodate the Qingyang Sect.  Moreover, the Qingyang Sect can mutually support each other with the Yuan Shen Gate.”</p><p>Some sects, though outwardly glorious, are inwardly decayed and contributed nothing to the recent war.  Heaven-granted treasures and spiritual veins belong to the virtuous."</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to be waiting for a better offer, remaining noncommittal, skillfully evading the question with a few carefully chosen words.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's evasiveness, Elder Ji changed his tone, turning to the furious Zang Qing.  He said calmly, "Fellow Daoist Zang Qing, what is your view on the future?  Is it necessary for Xiaohan Domain and Tianxing League to remain so strictly separated?"</p><p>Zang Qing paused, thoughtful.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised.  "Is this the Daoist's intention?"</p><p>Elder Ji remained noncommittal, continuing, "Xiaohan Domain and Tianxing League were originally one, but later split due to various reasons, creating estrangement and even mutual hostility.  These years of cooperation against the Abyss have fostered familiarity and collaboration. This is the perfect opportunity to resolve old grievances.  I've had this idea for a while, but the urgency of the war prevented me from bringing it up."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The matter was too significant for him to comment on without consulting his senior sister.  However, the merging of the two domains would undoubtedly increase their strength, making them more capable of facing the Abyss. His senior sister would likely approve.</p><p>At this moment, Zang Qing sneered. "Elder Ji, that's easy for you to say.  If the two domains unite, the Tianxing League gets a free share of the spoils in the Ancient Immortal battlefield. What do we get? And who will be in charge after the merger—Tianxing League or Xiaohan Domain?"</p><p>To this pointed question, Elder Ji responded calmly, "All these can be discussed! I believe that if everyone is willing, we can reach an agreement satisfactory to all parties."</p><p>Zang Qing fell silent, and Elder Ji wisely let the matter rest there.</p><p>As they spoke, they had flown thousands of miles across the wilderness.</p><p>The cloud abruptly stopped mid-air. Elder Ji produced a map, studied it, and pointed to the northeast. "Not far from here lies the Mihui Stone mine, second only in value to the largest spirit stone mine. The Abyss Nascent Soul guarding it is clever;  even internal informants haven't been able to locate his hidden lair. Prepare yourselves, we may have a chance to ambush him here!"</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Everyone summoned their magical weapons, silently leaving the cloud, their figures flashing and disappearing into the shadows.</p>
