<h1></h1><p>The demonic fire was on the verge of being seized by another.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang showed not the slightest hint of panic on his face.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton paused, sensing that something was amiss. It felt as though it had overlooked something crucial!</p><p>The Soul-Gathering Gourd was surrounded by swirling soul energy, forming a massive funnel-shaped dark cloud in the air. It released an endless stream of peculiar fluctuations that had a clear effect on the demonic fire.</p><p>Even the Eighteen Demon Banners were powerless to compete with it.</p><p>Qin Sang could only watch helplessly as the demonic fire broke free from the banners, flying faster and faster toward the Soul-Gathering Gourd. The inevitable outcome was that the demonic fire would be controlled by the gourd, changing hands completely!</p><p>At this critical moment...</p><p>A tiny flame suddenly leaped out from the center of the demonic fire.</p><p>This flame was also part of the demonic fire, perfectly blending in. If it hadn't revealed itself, the Jade Skeleton wouldn't have noticed anything unusual. Unlike the other demonic fire that was being drawn toward the Soul-Gathering Gourd, this flame, though seemingly weak, was incredibly stable, completely unaffected by the gourd's influence.</p><p>The flame slowly rose, revealing a fiery lotus seed within!</p><p>The Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed!</p><p>From the very beginning, Qin Sang had secretly hidden the fiery lotus seed within the demonic fire, deliberately masking its fluctuations to deceive the Jade Skeleton's senses.</p><p>The fiery lotus seed was composed of the demonic fire that Qin Sang had refined.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fiery lotus seed dispersed, transforming into a fiery carpet that enveloped the demonic fire, cutting off the Soul-Gathering Gourd's influence over it.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang regained control of the demonic fire. With a thought, the demonic fire's momentum halted abruptly, then plummeted downward, creating distance from the Soul-Gathering Gourd.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare delay, swiftly changing hand seals as he fought fiercely with the gourd for control.</p><p>Seeing the fiery lotus seed, the Jade Skeleton's expression changed drastically. It could clearly sense that the fiery lotus seed bore Qin Sang's aura, indicating an extremely close connection.</p><p>Just moments ago, it had confidently declared to Elder Ye that a cultivator at the early Nascent Soul stage couldn't possibly refine the demonic fire.</p><p>Never did it expect to be proven wrong so quickly.</p><p>The *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* technique had refined the demonic fire to a state nearly identical to Qin Sang's innate demonic fire, leaving a deep imprint of his essence. Even if a descendant of the Nine Nether Clan were to appear in person, they wouldn't be able to reclaim his fiery lotus seed.</p><p>Furious and humiliated, the Jade Skeleton let out a roar.</p><p>The Soul-Gathering Gourd trembled violently, its fluctuations that attracted the demonic fire stirring the soul energy into black streaks that shot down like arrows, aiming directly for the core of the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He immediately dispersed the fiery carpet, allowing the fiery lotus seed to merge back into the core of the demonic fire.</p><p>*Thud! Thud!*</p><p>The black streaks pierced into the fireball.</p><p>The demonic fire began to drift toward the Soul-Gathering Gourd once more.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang couldn't let it succeed. He activated the *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* technique, pulling with all his might.</p><p>A tug-of-war ensued.</p><p>In truth, the Jade Skeleton was also using the Soul-Gathering Gourd to indirectly control the demonic fire, no different from the demon banners.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade Skeleton and Qin Sang were locked in a struggle over the demonic fire, a far more difficult task than seizing an unclaimed demonic fire.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had only refined a portion of the demonic fire, it shared the same origin. Through the fiery lotus seed, Qin Sang had a certain degree of control over the demonic fire, a qualitative difference from the indirect control achieved through the demon banners!</p><p>At its former level of cultivation, the Jade Skeleton could have easily overcome this.</p><p>Unfortunately, it had only just broken free from its seal. Its current cultivation level wasn't vastly superior to Qin Sang's.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The Jade Skeleton and Qin Sang chased and fled, putting some distance between themselves and the others.</p><p>True Unity Daoist and the others watched the battle between Qin Sang and the Jade Skeleton while swiftly moving to support Qin Sang.</p><p>Those who acted were all Nascent Soul Ancestors, the most elite figures of the North Star Realm.</p><p>Each attack was extraordinary.</p><p>Having fought together for years, they were well-versed in coordinated attacks and weren't a disorganized mob. Faced with the combined assault of multiple Nascent Soul cultivators, even a late-stage Nascent Soul grandmaster would have to retreat.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton, unwilling to face the group head-on, found it easy to evade their attacks.</p><p>Without any visible use of techniques, the Jade Skeleton's figure flickered, dodging all the magical treasures and spells. Not a single injury could be seen on its body.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton ignored the others, its cold gaze fixed on Qin Sang, the soul flames in its eye sockets radiating a chilling aura.</p><p>"Reckless fool! Today, I shall grant you your wish!"</p><p>Its plan to seize the demonic fire had failed.</p><p>If the struggle continued, the Jade Skeleton would undoubtedly emerge victorious. However, it had no patience for Qin Sang's tricks and decisively abandoned the Soul-Gathering Gourd.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Seize the fire!</p><p>"Why hasn't Bai made a move yet? I wonder if the time I've bought is enough..."</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's mind was still occupied with other thoughts.</p><p>He had done his best.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Jade Skeleton was impatient. Otherwise, he could have dragged things out a bit longer.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his expression tense. He stood still, his hand twitching slightly as he prepared to unleash the Demon-Binding Rope. The Jade Skeleton was closing in rapidly, and he could wait no longer.</p><p>Just then, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>A deafening roar erupted in the distance, shaking the heavens and the earth.</p><p>The ground trembled several times, growing increasingly violent.</p><p>The source seemed to be the direction of the blood-red altar.</p><p>Deep within the ghostly mist, a cluster of azure light became clearly visible.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton's figure suddenly froze, right in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Its head snapped toward the blood-red altar, its soul flames blazing fiercely, almost bursting out of its eye sockets as it let out a terrifying roar.</p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p>Its voice thundered like a storm.</p><p>Rage surged to the heavens.</p><p>In the next moment, the Jade Skeleton abandoned its pursuit of Qin Sang, disregarding even the demonic fire. It transformed into a streak of purple light and vanished into the sky in an instant.</p><p>True Unity Daoist and the others flew to Qin Sang's side, looking at the now-empty ghostly mist, exchanging puzzled glances.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton had appeared and disappeared like a ghost, leaving no trace.</p><p>"Is that the demon sealed in the Sin Abyss? Elder Ye released it and it took over the Jade Skeleton. To still possess such terrifying strength after being sealed for countless yearsâ€”what level must it have been at in its prime?"</p><p>One of the Nascent Soul cultivators murmured, recalling the earlier scene with lingering fear.</p><p>Even Qin Sang, with all his secret treasures, was no match for the Jade Skeleton. If they had been the target, they would likely be dead by now.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, are you injured?"</p><p>True Unity Daoist asked with concern. Seeing that Qin Sang was only slightly out of breath and not seriously injured, he turned his gaze to the Eighteen Demon Banners. "What is the connection between the demonic fire and the Jade Skeleton?"</p><p>"There must be some connection."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded lightly, offering no further explanation. He recalled the demon banners, inspected them briefly to ensure they were undamaged, and then sealed the demonic fire. "We'll find out if we go and see!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang activated his movement technique at full power, speeding toward the blood-red altar. His eyes were fixed on the cluster of azure light above the altar, his gaze flickering as he tightened his grip on the Demon-Binding Rope.</p><p>True Unity Daoist and Cang Hong Zhenren quickly followed. They glanced at Qin Sang's back, a hint of suspicion in their eyes. They couldn't shake the feeling that Qin Sang was acting strangely, as if he knew something.</p><p>The others hesitated briefly before giving chase.</p><p>The Jade Skeleton's behavior didn't seem feigned. It appeared to have encountered some trouble.</p><p>Not only had it abandoned Qin Sang and the demonic fire, but it had also left the evil formation unattended. The surrounding blood clouds dispersed, and the attacks from the ghostly creatures were no longer as frenzied as before.</p><p>The pressure on the group lessened significantly, allowing them to break through the encirclement and head straight for the blood-red altar! </p>
