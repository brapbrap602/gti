<h1>Chapter 1303: The Scheme</h1><p>Chapter 1303: The Scheme</p><p>Heaven unleashes killing intent, shifting stars and constellations;</p><p>Earth unleashes killing intent, dragons and snakes rise from the land;</p><p>Man unleashes killing intent, heaven and earth are overturned.</p><p>This so-called killing intent of man, is profound and mysterious.</p><p>The cultivators of the Sin Abyss realized that this killing intent must be sought amongst mortals.  Therefore, both righteous and demonic sects acted unusually, sending low-level disciples into the mortal world, controlling mortal kingdoms, stirring up trouble, and creating conflict.</p><p>Within the Sin Abyss, war raged incessantly. Corpses littered the fields, blood flowed like rivers, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Countless people were separated from their families, their homes destroyed.</p><p>Even in their suffering, they still prayed to their immortal masters, begging for divine protection.  These mortals died unaware of the truth: the immortal masters they revered were the true masterminds, manipulating everything.  The immortal masters looked down from their high positions, coldly observing the mortals slaughtering each other, as if watching a herd of fattened pigs.</p><p>Their goal?  To harvest the killing intent of man, to refine pills.</p><p>Such actions bordered on demonic cultivation.</p><p>Yet, the self-proclaimed righteous cultivators, including Tian Zheng and Cang Hong, turned a blind eye. As for the demonic cultivators, they were even more enthusiastic, collecting souls to their hearts' content, enough to refine several kinds of evil arts.</p><p>They successfully collected the killing intent of man.</p><p>But they discovered that this method was too slow, and for some reason, the killing intent was too impure. Wars between mortals were limited in scale; even a nation's destruction yielded little, insufficient for the needs of all the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Most of the Sin Abyss' Nascent Soul cultivators had participated in the hunt for the demon lord and earned merit.  They all expected a share of the spoils—the Ku Yuan Pills must be distributed equally. Otherwise, the Sin Abyss would crumble.</p><p>The first Ku Yuan Pills were tested on select Gold Core peak disciples. These individuals had failed to reach Nascent Soul stage, their lifespans nearing their end, with no hope of breakthrough.</p><p>Shockingly, some of those who took the Ku Yuan Pills successfully formed their Nascent Souls, and appeared completely normal afterwards, showing no ill effects.</p><p>After verifying the pills' efficacy, they couldn't give up.</p><p>Then, they turned their attention to cultivators.</p><p>Perhaps the killing intent of man could be found within themselves.</p><p>Cultivators simply possessed greater power!</p><p>They provoked the Sky Walk League on the plains, confirming the feasibility of this plan.</p><p>Cultivators were far stronger than mortals. Their conflicts were far more intense, yielding purer killing intent.</p><p>The Sin Abyss reached a consensus. Righteous and demonic masters gathered at Xing Heng Sect, forming an alliance and deciding to launch a war against the Sky Walk League!</p><p>Of course, the official reason wasn't pill refinement.</p><p>The low-level cultivators of the Sin Abyss, once mere pawns in a game, became the pieces themselves.</p><p>"Perhaps some individuals harbored ambition, a desire for dominion. But most who waged this war did not seek conquest. The previous stalemate was also deliberate."</p><p>Hearing Qu Huan’s words, the others understood, their anger flaring.</p><p>They only now learned the true intentions of the Sin Abyss' higher-ups. They were all pawns!  If the Sin Abyss had been facing resource depletion and fought for survival, their anger would be far less intense.</p><p>"Refining pills from the killing intent of man, using a formula obtained by soul-searching a demon lord—they actually dared to consume them!"</p><p>Lord Tong You sneered.</p><p>The origin and method of refining the Ku Yuan Pills were clearly sinister.</p><p>"The soul-searched memory fragments, the Blood Lake secrets, and the passage between the two palaces—all were confirmed, indirectly increasing the Ku Yuan Pills' credibility.  Even so, they remained cautious, not blindly consuming them. Over a hundred years, various sects selected Gold Core disciples to consume the Ku Yuan Pills, thus greatly increasing the number of Nascent Soul cultivators in the Sin Abyss, making them capable of easily contending against two realms. The newly formed Nascent Souls were unaware of the pills' origin—they were test subjects, observed by the elders..."</p><p>Pausing, Qu Huan sighed, "Of course, some couldn't resist the temptation and secretly took the pills to force a breakthrough. Many did so. Old Monster Feng was one of them, paying a terrible price."</p><p>The war between the three realms lasted nearly two hundred years.</p><p>Over this time, those who consumed the Ku Yuan Pills seemed normal, showing no ill effects.  Even the patient Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sin Abyss couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>Qu Huan felt a chill. He had almost succumbed to temptation.</p><p>"What was the price?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled her senior sister's words,  "So many people died at the hands of Old Demon Ye. It must be related to the Ku Yuan Pills, right?"</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Qu Huan nodded slightly. "This morning, all the Nascent Souls of the Sin Abyss gathered in Yu City to discuss important matters."</p><p>Ye Laomo suddenly attacked.  Everyone who had taken the Ku Yuan Dan experienced a simultaneous onset of its hidden dangers. In the blink of an eye, Feng Laoguai and the others’ physical energy drained away, their cultivation plummeted, and their spiritual essence withered; their spirit, energy, and essence were all failing!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others gasped.</p><p>Spirit, energy, and essence are the foundation of a cultivator. Any problem with one is extremely serious; the failure of all three is incurable!</p><p>“The worst were the newly-formed Yuan Ying. Except for those who formed their Yuan Ying through their own abilities, everyone else relied on the Ku Yuan Dan. Their Yuan Ying were on the verge of collapse, defenseless against Ye Laomo.  Those older cultivators fared somewhat better, but those who had taken a large amount of the Ku Yuan Dan couldn't resist much either. Ye Laomo captured their Yuan Ying on the spot…”</p><p>Qu Huan recalled the scene, still looking somewhat horrified.</p><p>Ye Laomo bared his fangs and, in full view of everyone, harvested half the Yuan Ying as easily as cutting vegetables.  Before everyone could react to the shock, Ye Laomo had already succeeded, and they couldn't stop him.</p><p>“Looking back, there were signs. Ye Laomo was ambushed and injured six months ago – it must have been deliberate.  From then on, the Zu Yuan forces suffered continuous defeats, ultimately retreating to Yu City, giving the Yuan Ying a chance to gather there.</p><p>“In my opinion, ancient cultivators likely used the Ku Yuan Dan in battle formations, to instantly boost their strength and defeat their enemies, but with terrible long-term consequences.</p><p>“Ye Laomo used some secret technique to delay the onset of these consequences. Today, his plan has come to fruition!</p><p>“It’s probably related to the Youjing Pagoda. When he escaped, he not only destroyed the Youjing Pagoda but also stole all the crystals from its top.</p><p>“The emergence of the demonic figure centuries ago was all part of Ye Laomo’s scheme!”</p><p>Qu Huan’s words revealed the brutal truth of the cultivation world.</p><p>Low-level cultivators were lured into the mortal world, stirring up the mortals' greed and causing them to slaughter each other.  Soon after, they were thrown into the cultivators’ battlefield by the Yuan Ying ancestors, becoming test subjects for the Ku Yuan Dan.</p><p>But those Yuan Ying ancestors were merely pawns in Ye Laomo's hands, ultimately harvested by him. They thought they were the players, but they were all in his game. How many were innocent?</p><p>After this upheaval, not only was half of the Yuan Ying lost, but those who had taken the Ku Yuan Dan were also plagued by its hidden dangers, their strength greatly diminished.  They're barely managing now, but who knows what the ultimate outcome will be?</p><p>Qu Huan witnessed the Zu Yuan's dwindling power and its complete surrender to the Two Realms Alliance.</p>
