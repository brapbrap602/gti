<h1>Chapter 2139: The Formless Tribulation</h1><p>“So Immortal Ning knew about Daiyu Immortal Mountain long ago.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't particularly surprised. With Immortal Ning’s cultivation level, as long as she had been to the Storm Realm, it wouldn't have escaped her discerning eyes.</p><p>The question was, why didn't Immortal Ning take the Immortal Mountain?</p><p>Immortal Ning nodded slightly, but first spoke about the origins of Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>“Legend has it that there were five Immortal Mountains in ancient times. The first was Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Immortal and saintly beings resided within these mountains, and fruits of immortality were abundant. Later, heaven and earth underwent a great change, and the Immortal Mountains drifted away, each finding its own master. Ancient texts record that the roots of these Immortal Mountains were untethered, constantly rising and falling with the tides. Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain and Daiyu Immortal Mountain eventually drifted into the River of Corruption, falling into the boundless void…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively. He had already obtained the ancient texts of the Changyou Clan, which contained similar records, but they weren't as detailed as Immortal Ning’s account.  Both the Foreign Tribes and the Dao Sects recorded this event, and with the actual Daiyu Immortal Mountain as proof, this legend seemed credible.</p><p>Qin Sang listened with a degree of skepticism. The details likely differed greatly from the truth, perhaps even being completely opposite.</p><p>“The origins of the River of Corruption should also be recorded in the Daoist scriptures of the Talisman Sect,” Immortal Ning looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what he had seen and heard in the Talisman Realm. “Legend says that at the beginning of creation, Yin and Yang were undifferentiated, and clarity and turbidity were intertwined. As the Great Dao operated, clear Qi ascended to form the heavens, and turbid Qi descended to form the earth. However, some undifferentiated Qi remained, lingering in the world. This was called the Primordial Qi of the Six Heavens, which transformed into the River of Corruption, breeding calamities…”</p><p>“These accounts originate from the scriptures before the Dao Court’s seclusion. It seems the Dao Court has remained isolated all these years. Before you left, the Dao Court still hadn't reemerged,” Immortal Ning said thoughtfully.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened. Facing a mighty figure like Immortal Ning, with her discerning gaze, he had to be extremely cautious. A moment of carelessness could reveal his origins. Fortunately, these weren't crucial secrets.</p><p>“I wonder how the origins of the River of Corruption are explained in the present world?” Qin Sang asked calmly, his expression unchanged.</p><p>“Variations on the same theme!”</p><p>Immortal Ning commented.</p><p>“In the current cultivation world, the Buddhist theory of the Four Kalpas is prevalent and has many adherents. The Four Kalpas are Formation, Abiding, Destruction, and Emptiness. They explain the operation of the Heavenly Dao and the cycle of birth, death, rise, and fall of all things, including both small and large thousand worlds.</p><p>“Nothing can exist eternally, not even the great thousand worlds. From the beginning of creation to its ultimate demise, everything follows the operation of the Great Dao, experiencing countless tribulations, originating from emptiness and returning to emptiness. This process can be divided into the four periods of Formation, Abiding, Destruction, and Emptiness.</p><p>“Mighty figures have calculated that the great thousand world we inhabit is currently in the first or second period.</p><p>“After the first period, clear and turbid Qi should be completely separated.  The Heavenly Dao hasn’t evolved to that point yet, and the clear and turbid Qi have formed the River of Corruption. As the Great Dao continues to operate and the second period arrives, the River of Corruption will eventually disappear.</p><p>“However, there’s a more pessimistic theory. Looking at the long river of history, this world has already entered the second period, which should be a time of prosperity, yet the River of Corruption still exists. Perhaps a major event disrupted the operation of the Great Dao, leading to a flawed Heavenly Dao, such as the invasion of the Demonic Realm.</p><p>“Regardless of the explanation, they are all based on the theory of the Four Kalpas, and they are not without supporting evidence. Buddhism speaks of the Six Paths of Reincarnation, and Daoism speaks of the Nine Netherworlds. While ghosts and spirits clearly exist in the world, there’s no Yellow Springs or Netherworld. Where do the souls of the deceased go? Where does reincarnation take place? Isn’t this strange?</p><p>“Some believe that the Netherworld should have been born from the River of Corruption, but due to the disruption of the Great Dao, it failed to evolve properly. The River of Corruption is a flaw in the Heavenly Dao, a flaw in the great thousand world…”</p><p>Listening to Immortal Ning’s eloquent explanation, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>These were indeed questions that had puzzled him in the past. The mortal world could naturally give birth to ghosts and spirits, and the Ghost Gate separated Yin and Yang. Yet, the underworld depended on the mortal world, without a true Netherworld or a place of reincarnation. Where did the billions of souls go?</p><p>The ghost soldiers of the Dao Court were also modeled after the Divine Court, and only after Empress Houtu created the酆都Ghost Prison did they have a place to reside.</p><p>However, these weren't the focus of today's conversation, and Immortal Ning only touched upon them briefly without further explanation.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tinge of regret, but he also knew what was important. He listened quietly as Immortal Ning continued, “Daiyu Immortal Mountain and Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain fell into the River of Corruption. Somehow, the Foreign Tribes obtained Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain.  A mighty figure among the Foreign Tribes used the Immortal Mountain as a foundation to create a sacred land. This is the origin of the Foreign Tribe’s Sacred Land and the Yuanqiao Mirage. However, Daiyu Immortal Mountain, which also fell into the River of Corruption, remained lost, unexpectedly landing in a small thousand world, reduced to such a dilapidated state after who knows what it encountered.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but be astonished.</p><p>The Changyou Clan’s ancient texts only recorded that the Sacred Land and the Yuanqiao Mirage might be connected to Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain, without specific details. Perhaps the person who left behind the records didn't know either.</p><p>He hadn't expected Yuanqiao Immortal Mountain to be the foundation of the Sacred Land.</p><p>The Foreign Tribe’s Sacred Land was vast and boundless. All Foreign Tribe cultivators above the Saint Realm cultivated there. It was difficult to imagine what kind of Immortal Mountain could create such a Sacred Land!</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain was only a thousand zhang high. Although it held mysteries Qin Sang hadn't yet unravelled, it was definitely impossible for it to possess such profound capabilities.</p><p>Immortal Ning said the Immortal Mountain was dilapidated, but it was more than just dilapidated. The current Daiyu Immortal Mountain could probably only be considered a fragment!</p><p>No wonder Immortal Ning hadn't taken it. She probably didn't deem it worthy.</p><p>“Was this a test and opportunity that Immortal Ning left for Liu Li? I didn’t understand the situation and have already retrieved the Immortal Mountain, temporarily placing it at the Green Ram Temple. However, I haven’t yet touched the secrets within the mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang's original intention was to find purer Green Spiritual Qi for his breakthrough. Facts proved that this kind of Green Spiritual Qi might not exist.</p><p>Daiyu Immortal Mountain had a grand origin and was undoubtedly valuable, but it was only a remnant mountain with an unknown purpose, and it was left by Immortal Ning for Liu Li. Naturally, Qin Sang wouldn't be too greedy.</p><p>As he was speaking, Immortal Ning interrupted him, “I’m not asking Envoy Qin for the Immortal Mountain.  Liu Li knows that you've taken it, and she certainly wouldn't mind. Although ancient texts don’t mention whether Immortal Mountains can develop a will, divine objects possess a spirit, and they belong to those who are destined for them. Envoy Qin’s ability to retrieve it indicates that the Immortal Mountain has recognized you. If it were someone else, they likely wouldn't be able to take it. You are the destined one. Even if you forcefully give it away, it might be detrimental to that person…”</p><p>Divine objects possessing a spirit was something Qin Sang had suspected, but he hadn't discovered any signs of the Immortal Mountain’s will, nor had he felt himself being recognized. Although this mountain was once one of the five great Immortal Mountains, now reduced to such a state, could it still possess the ability to choose its master?</p><p>In fact, controlling the stone tablet allowed one to manipulate the ancient restrictions within the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Immortal Ning’s inquisitive gaze, as if she was asking what was special about him, why he was recognized.  Little did she know that he was equally confused. The most reasonable explanation was that both he and Daiyu Immortal Mountain came from the Storm Realm. Any cultivator from the Storm Realm with a cultivation level comparable to his could have taken the Immortal Mountain at that moment.</p><p>There was another explanation. Could it be because he had placed the Immortal Mountain into his Small Cave Heaven, thus avoiding some trouble?</p><p>“Compared to Daiyu Immortal Mountain, I’m more interested in the entanglement between Envoy Qin and Liu Li.”</p><p>Immortal Ning showed a gentle smile. “I have thoroughly studied Liu Li’s life experiences. Envoy Qin is an unavoidable figure in her life. Although the time you spent together was short, by a twist of fate, a deep bond already exists between you. Hmm, does Envoy Qin know the origin of the cultivation technique you both practiced?”</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit was roused, and he immediately said, “I implore Immortal Ning to enlighten me!”</p><p>His connection with Liu Li began with the *Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron True Scripture*, but because of this wicked technique, a series of subsequent events unfolded. The hidden dangers left by the wicked technique became Liu Li’s nightmare and torment, causing her to be unable to distinguish whether her feelings were genuine or influenced by the wicked technique, bringing her unimaginable pain.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Qin Sang was the beneficiary, but he didn't want this kind of benefit. Given the opportunity, he would definitely help Liu Li eliminate the hidden danger, allowing her to face her own heart with integrity.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, Qin Sang was willing to accept it.</p><p>However, even now, he hadn't been able to trace the origin of the *Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron True Scripture*. Duke Dongyang claimed that this wicked technique originated from the Purple Star Palace, meaning it was an ancient technique, but clearly not from the sword cultivator lineage.  Qin Sang had searched numerous ancient texts in the Five Elements Alliance, but to no avail.</p><p>“This technique is derived from an ancient cultivation method called the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture*!”</p><p>Immortal Ning explained, “Perhaps the person who created this technique only obtained a fragmented copy and made many presumptuous modifications to the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture*, turning it into a wicked technique. In reality, the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture* is one of the supreme true methods of the Dual Cultivation path!”</p><p>*Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture*, a supreme true method of the Dual Cultivation path!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised and also somewhat delighted. Since it wasn’t a wicked technique, resolving the hidden dangers should be easier.</p><p>Immortal Ning explained, “Despite the modifications, the true meaning of the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture* has been preserved. What many don't know is that the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture* has extremely stringent requirements for cultivators.  It requires dual cultivation with a Dao companion, and both parties must deeply love and completely trust each other, without any doubt or reservation, and believe that their Dao companion will never change their heart.”</p><p>Such a cultivation technique actually existed in the world!</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Immortal Ning continued, “To cultivate the *Vermilion Bird Heart Scripture* is to willingly be deeply affected by the poison of love. Moreover, one party must relinquish their sense of self, completely surrendering their body and mind to the control of their Dao companion. After a certain period, the roles of the two parties will completely reverse. In this way, through continuous cycles of Yin and Yang, they can achieve the wondrous realm of Yin and Yang harmony.  The human heart is fickle!  I ask you, if they didn't truly love each other and completely trust each other, how could they dare to entrust themselves to their Dao companion? In this world, how many such Dao companions are there?”</p><p>Immortal Ning’s question left Qin Sang speechless.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure whether such Dao companions truly existed in the world. He himself certainly couldn’t do it.</p><p>No matter how beloved a woman or how close a relative, he couldn’t let himself lose his sense of self. This had nothing to do with true love.</p><p>Finally knowing the origin of the *Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron True Scripture* seemed to present even greater problems. However, the *Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron True Scripture* might only be derived from a fragmented copy, and he and Liu Li had only cultivated it once. The hidden danger might not be that serious.</p><p>At this moment, Immortal Ning, who had been observing Qin Sang, suddenly asked a question, “How does Envoy Qin view love in the mortal world?”</p><p>In a short period, Immortal Ning had revealed one secret after another, leaving Qin Sang overwhelmed. Before he could digest them, Immortal Ning changed the topic, yet it always hovered around the main point. Qin Sang couldn't grasp the initiative, yet he didn't dare to contradict Immortal Ning.</p><p>“I only follow my heart, letting nature take its course…”</p><p>Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Immortal Ning asked more specifically, “For example, two people who truly love each other, should they cherish the present moment, staying together despite all difficulties and dangers, indulging in joy without thinking about tomorrow? Or should they always keep each other in their hearts, striving for immortality together, supporting each other, forever and ever?”</p><p>“Does Immortal Ning have something specific in mind?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. “Moreover, my cultivation is meager.  Isn’t it too early for me to speculate about life after achieving immortality?”</p><p>Beyond Void Refinement was Body Integration, and beyond Body Integration was Grand Completion.</p><p>Grand Completion cultivators, at least Qin Sang had seen them with his own eyes, and he was getting closer himself, holding a sliver of hope. As for those who ascended to the Immortal Realm, he had only heard legends of the Shaman God so far.</p><p>The path of immortality was ethereal and difficult to find.</p><p>Speaking only of the human race, there was the Great Zhou Emperor, the Jade Emperor; the mighty figure who established the Talisman Dao Divine Court; Empress Houtu, who established the Divine Dao; and the Purple Star Sword Sovereign, the master of the Purple Star Palace…</p><p>Each one of them was exceptionally talented, dominating an era, yet there were no definite rumors that they had achieved immortality.</p><p>Qin Sang's pursuit of the immortal path was unwavering, and he was moving towards it step by step, but he wasn’t arrogant.</p><p>“Immortality is not eternal life.”</p><p>Immortal Ning shook her head.  “Upon reaching the Void Refinement realm, one no longer has to worry about lifespan. The Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation occurs every three thousand years.  For mortals, and even Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation cultivators, isn't that immortality?  And upon reaching the Grand Completion realm, one is free from heavenly tribulations. Isn’t that immortality?”</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang’s heart was shaken. His encounters with mighty figures were always during life-or-death situations, leaving no time to inquire about such matters.  They might have assumed these were common knowledge and wouldn’t have proactively told him.</p><p>Grand Completion cultivators didn't experience heavenly tribulations!</p><p>No worries about lifespan, no worries about heavenly tribulations. That was more than just immortality!</p><p>Could what he had pursued his whole life be attained after breaking through to the Grand Completion realm? If so, what did becoming an immortal mean to a Grand Completion cultivator?</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had revealed his ignorance again in front of Immortal Ning, exposing many of his shortcomings. Yet, he couldn't help it.  The gap in knowledge was impossible to bridge.</p><p>“Grand Completion cultivators can create their own worlds, becoming part of the Heavenly Dao, and some even claim to be embodiments of the Heavenly Dao.  How could they experience heavenly tribulations? What’s more, as long as a Grand Completion cultivator is willing, they can allow their descendants to cultivate within their small thousand world. If their descendants are unable to break through to Void Refinement for a long time, they can prevent the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation from descending, until their descendants break through or their lifespan is exhausted! Of course, the Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation contains a stronger will of heaven and earth, which even Grand Completion cultivators cannot influence.”</p><p>The information Immortal Ning revealed became increasingly astonishing, completely overturning Qin Sang’s understanding of Grand Completion cultivators.</p><p>In truth, the gap between each major realm was like a vast chasm. If he hadn’t witnessed the Sword Domain, Qin Sang would have found it hard to imagine the divine abilities of a Body Integration cultivator.</p><p>However…</p><p>At this moment, Immortal Ning’s tone changed again.</p><p>“Grand Completion cultivators are free from tribulations, yet they face the Formless Tribulation! Heaven and earth are constantly changing, tribulations are ever-present, and creation has its cycles of birth and death. Immortality is not eternal life. Tribulations come and go, elusive and unpredictable.  A single fleeting thought, a spark of nameless anger, can trigger karma and invite disaster!”</p>
