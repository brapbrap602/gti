<h1>Chapter 2240: Attack on the Mountain</h1><p>“Come out, people of Yuanjing Mountain!  Do you intend to hide forever like cowards?”</p><p>“A life for a life! Hand over the murderer!”</p><p>“If you don’t hand over the murderer, we’ll storm the gates!”</p><p>“Yes, storm the gates!”</p><p>“Storm the gates!”</p><p>……</p><p>The crowd blocked the mountain gate, shouting angrily at the mountain.  Their fury was palpable.</p><p>Inside the mountain gate, a group of Yuanjing Mountain disciples gathered before the headmaster’s hall.  Hearing the insults from outside, their faces flushed with anger.</p><p>Currently, Yuanjing Mountain had far more than just the original five master and disciples.  During the seclusion of Master Tongshen, following their master's instructions, they had accepted many new disciples.</p><p>Senior Brother Qingyan was acting as the master's representative in his role as a Celestial Guard. Qin Sang frequently went out and, upon her return, usually remained in seclusion.  Therefore, Qinghong was responsible for the mountain's affairs, assisted by Shuangluo.</p><p>Most of these disciples were under the two of them.  A few days ago, one of these disciples caused trouble, leading to today's crisis.</p><p>The story begins with Yuanjing Mountain’s rebuilding.</p><p>Years ago, Master Tongshen and his eldest disciple, Qingyan, visited the Qingjiang Sect.  There, Master Tongshen engaged the Qingjiang Sect's headmaster in a sparring match, which the Qingjiang Sect headmaster lost.</p><p>This sparring match was essentially a gamble, a test of strength. Afterward, Master Tongshen and the Qingjiang Sect headmaster held a private discussion. As a result,  Master Tongshen not only obtained a mountain for his sect but also nearby cultivation resources – resources that originally belonged to the Qingjiang Sect.</p><p>Near Yuanjing Mountain flows the Qingtuo River, its waters flowing from north to south.  The Qingjiang Sect, built along the upper reaches of the Qingtuo River, was named accordingly.</p><p>Originally, the entire Qingtuo River basin fell under the Qingjiang Sect's control. Other independent cultivators, families, and smaller sects could only rely on their goodwill. The arrival of Master Tongshen and Yuanjing Mountain shattered the peace of the Qingtuo River basin, seizing a substantial portion of territory from the Qingjiang Sect.</p><p>However, this wasn't entirely bad news for the Qingjiang Sect.  As more cultivators relocated, the landscape of Yongtu Immortal City and its surroundings changed significantly. Smaller sects were swept along in the current, many disappearing from history.</p><p>Master Tongshen, a Celestial Guard affiliated with the Immortal City, had served diligently for many years and risen to the position of deputy commander of his squad.  The Qingjiang Sect's headmaster chose to swallow his pride, recognizing Master Tongshen’s influential backing, which ensured peace in the region.</p><p>After the sparring match, both sides agreed to divide the territory along a mountain range in the middle section of the Qingtuo River, agreeing to non-interference.</p><p>However, firstly, because Yuanjing Mountain was an outsider, Master Tongshen didn't want to be aggressive. Secondly, at that time, the sect consisted of only five master and disciples, and their need for external resources was minimal.  Therefore, Master Tongshen didn't forcefully expel the Qingjiang Sect’s influence.  Many resources south of the boundary remained under the Qingjiang Sect's control.  Seeing Yuanjing Mountain’s restraint, the Qingjiang Sect grew increasingly bolder, rendering the agreement meaningless.</p><p>As Yuanjing Mountain's disciples increased, they needed to reclaim those resources to sustain their sect, inevitably leading to friction with the Qingjiang Sect.  Initially, things went smoothly due to Master Tongshen's reputation. Even though displeased, the Qingjiang Sect could only gradually withdraw its forces, unwilling to openly violate the agreement.</p><p>However, when the Qingjiang Sect retreated to the boundary, they encountered a problem. The mountain range serving as the boundary turned out to be a geomantic treasure, containing several valuable resources highly beneficial to Yuanjing Mountain's water-and-fire cultivation techniques.  They absolutely had to secure these resources.  Master Tongshen, having just arrived, hadn't foreseen this and hadn't explicitly defined the mountain range's ownership with the Qingjiang Sect.</p><p>Qinghong and Shuangluo repeatedly negotiated with the Qingjiang Sect.  The process was incredibly difficult, with frequent friction between the disciples of both sects. Thankfully, both sides maintained restraint, avoiding casualties.</p><p>Recently, the Qingjiang Sect suddenly became aggressive and increasingly arrogant.  Qinghong sensed something was wrong, and then the incident occurred: a Yuanjing Mountain disciple killed a Qingjiang Sect official.</p><p>The official's death was suspicious, but ultimately irrelevant. It gave the Qingjiang Sect the perfect excuse to act, culminating in today's situation.</p><p>Qinghong stood before the headmaster’s hall, her expression grave.  Before her knelt a young man in red.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>The young man in red was the one who killed the official. He kowtowed repeatedly, his tiger-like eyes filled with tears.  “I dare not implicate Master and the sect. I’ll accept responsibility for my actions. I’ll give them a life for a life. Let me leave! I’ll repay the sect’s kindness in my next life!”</p><p>The other disciples were filled with grief and sorrow.</p><p>The young man in red was Lan Jingchuan, Qinghong’s eldest disciple, and the third-generation senior brother of Yuanjing Mountain. He was exceptionally talented and virtuous, highly respected among the disciples.  He was the one who accidentally killed the Qingjiang Sect official.</p><p>“Foolish!”</p><p>Qinghong rebuked gently.  “The Qingjiang Sect intends to break their promise. Even if you kill yourself before them, they'll find another excuse to continue their attacks.”</p><p>Shuangluo said softly, "Jingchuan, your Master and I have seen the recording of your fight with the deacon. We know you're telling the truth.  Logically, your final blow could only have severely injured him. His death must have another cause."</p><p>While comforting Lan Jingchuan, Shuangluo used voice transmission to speak to Qinghong: "Senior Sister, have you heard anything about Big Brother and Junior Brother?"</p><p>Her eyes held a shadow of worry.</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect's attack was aggressive, clearly intending to breach the mountain protection array and assault Mount Yuanjing.</p><p>There was something more to this; something they didn't know.</p><p>Their Master was in seclusion, at a critical point in his cultivation. They couldn't disturb him.  The four of them had to face this alone.</p><p>"Big Brother should have received the message. Junior Brother might not be in the city;  we don't know where he is..."</p><p>Qinghong's tone shifted. "It's better that Junior Brother isn't here. If his talent were revealed, with the current uncertain situation, someone might be secretly plotting against him!"</p><p>Mount Yuanjing had kept Qin Sang well-protected. Only the five of them – Master and disciples – knew of his talent. Disciples like Lan Jingchuan had only heard of their young uncle, never seen him.</p><p>Shuangluo felt a chill of fear.</p><p>They suspected the Qingjiang Sect's attack was an attempt to force their Master out of seclusion and disrupt his breakthrough. If the enemy learned of Junior Brother's talent, they would certainly try to kill him.</p><p>As the two communicated through voice transmission, the noise outside grew louder, with some people even shouting insults.</p><p>The crowd before Mount Yuanjing included more than just Qingjiang Sect cultivators. They had brought a body to demand justice, making a great show of it and attracting various factions from the Qingtuo River region.</p><p>At the front of the crowd, a coffin was carried, containing the deceased deacon. His corpse was bizarre: one half was waterlogged and covered in a layer of frost, while the other half was charred, as if burned.</p><p>This strange phenomenon perfectly matched Mount Yuanjing's cultivation techniques.</p><p>Mount Yuanjing disciples practiced both water and fire cultivation methods simultaneously; their attacks always involved both elements, a distinctive feature.</p><p>The deacon's family wailed around the coffin, their cries heart-wrenching.</p><p>Several individuals with refined appearances stood at the back of the crowd, coldly observing Mount Yuanjing.</p><p>Regardless of the bereaved family's cries, the mountain protection array remained silent. Onlookers whispered amongst themselves, mostly blaming Mount Yuanjing.</p><p>"Junior Sister, can you tell anything from the corpse?"</p><p>Qinghong asked through voice transmission.</p><p>The clamor outside didn't affect her; she calmly considered how to resolve the situation.  Solutions existed, but she didn't know the Qingjiang Sect's true strength or the hidden motives behind their actions, so she dared not act rashly.</p><p>The best solution was to examine the body.</p><p>Shuangluo shook her head slightly. "From the appearance of death, it does seem to have been caused by our sect's techniques, seemingly by Jingchuan.  I see no flaw, unless someone else also masters the Water-Fire Harmony chapter."</p><p>Mount Yuanjing's foundation was the Water-Fire Harmony chapter of the *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun*. It wasn't simply water and fire cultivation. Even if someone could cultivate both water and fire simultaneously, they couldn't replicate Mount Yuanjing's unique characteristics.</p><p>Then, someone from the crowd shouted, "Humph! You leave us no choice! We give you one more incense stick's worth of time. If you don't give the Qingjiang Sect an explanation after that, we will attack your mountain protection array!"</p><p>The Mount Yuanjing cultivators were furious.</p><p>Qinghong and Shuangluo exchanged glances. Their delay had been a test of the Qingjiang Sect's resolve, to see how far they would go.  They hadn't expected an actual attack.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>The incense stick burned out, and Mount Yuanjing remained silent.</p><p>The onlookers turned to the Qingjiang Sect, eager to see if they would dare act.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect didn't disappoint. Cultivators surged forward, dropping their disguises.  Leading them was the Qingjiang Sect's head disciple, flanked by elders.</p><p>Except for the Sect Master, almost all of the Qingjiang Sect's elite were present.</p><p>Only then did everyone realize the Qingjiang Sect wasn't bluffing; they truly intended to confront Mount Yuanjing!</p><p>Some shrewd individuals sensed the volatile situation and quietly slipped away, unwilling to get involved.</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect's head disciple stepped forward, looking up at the mountaintop. His gaze seemed to pierce the protective array, towards the disciples in the main hall.</p><p>A raspy voice spoke, “Master Xia was the great-grandson of a former Grand Elder of the Qingjiang Sect.  Elder Xia dedicated his life to the sect, making immeasurable contributions.  Without him, the Qingjiang Sect wouldn't exist today. Now, his descendant has been murdered, and Yuanshan Mountain has shielded the killer. If the Qingjiang Sect swallows this insult, it will demoralize everyone! Today, I, Yu Chen, will seek justice for Elder Xia and his grandson.”</p><p>His words resonated powerfully.</p><p>Yu Chen's eyes narrowed. “Elders, take your positions!”</p><p>His followers responded with a roar.  The Qingjiang Sect elders, each leading a group of disciples, soared into the air, forming a battle array before Yuanshan Mountain, their weapons pointed at the protective barrier.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Yu Chen summoned a magic sword and lunged forward.</p><p>The disciples unleashed their attacks simultaneously.  Streams of light, like writhing dragons, soared into the air, intertwining before forming a gigantic spear, a battering ram aimed at one of the barrier's pillars, ready to strike.</p><p>Qinghong and Shuangluo saw their precarious situation.</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect’s display wasn't a bluff. They had to respond and find a way out.  Holding onto Yuanshan Mountain was unsustainable; a powerful attack on the protective barrier would shake the mountain and alert their master.</p><p>Qinghong flickered, then reappeared, gazing into the distance, her expression softening.  “Senior Brother is back!”</p><p>A giant spear was about to strike Yuanshan Mountain when a lightning flash appeared on the horizon, followed by a roar: “Stop!”</p><p>The speed of the lightning revealed it to be a cultivator’s flight, instantly identifying the newcomer.</p><p>“Yuanshan Mountain's senior brother is here! I hear he’s a highly regarded Immortal Guard in Immortal City. This is going to be good!”</p><p>Qing Yan’s reputation preceded him, sparking discussion among those present.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside Yuanshan Mountain…</p><p>Near a stream, two figures sat at a stone table, playing Go.  One was the Qingjiang Sect leader; his opponent, an elder in green robes.</p><p>It was the Qingjiang Sect leader's turn. He held a piece, hesitant, clearly preoccupied.</p><p>The elder in green robes, sensing this, looked towards the mountain, smiling faintly. “That disciple has returned. There’s only one junior disciple left, an insignificant threat. The situation is resolved. I congratulate you in advance, my friend.”</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect leader looked up, a frown etched on his brow, which only slightly eased at the sight of the approaching cultivator. “Only him?”</p><p>The elder replied calmly, “He is, after all, an Immortal Guard from Yongtu Immortal City.  Assassinating him would cause major trouble. However, with my master's connections, arranging for him to be temporarily separated from his companions is manageable. Once today is over, even if he brings reinforcements, it won't change anything.”</p><p>Pausing, the elder asked, “Are you still worried about that Transcendent Master?”</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect leader, abandoning his game, placed his piece in the box, remaining silent, confirming the elder’s words.</p><p>“Since the Qingjiang Sect has joined Tianjing Sect, we’ll handle this. What are you afraid of? The Qingtuo River will remain yours, no one will contest it,” the elder said proudly.</p><p>While they spoke, Qing Yan arrived at Yuanshan Mountain, furious, standing before the Qingjiang Sect cultivators.</p><p>With Qing Yan's return, Yuanshan Mountain opened its gates, and Qinghong and Shuangluo led their disciples out.</p><p>The Qingjiang Sect leader and the elder in green robes simply watched from afar, making no move.</p><p>Suddenly, the elder’s expression changed. He looked up, spotting a white cloud drifting towards them, seemingly slow yet fast.</p><p>Moments later, the cloud descended, revealing three figures. One was a young man in white, followed by two beautiful women.</p><p>He carried a folding fan, his eyes bright and captivating, a handsome young gentleman.</p><p>The elder in green robes bowed to him, "Old servant greets the Young Master.”</p><p>The young man asked, “How is it going?”</p><p>The elder pointed at Yuanshan Mountain. “Everything is in place according to your instructions. We can close the net today.”</p><p>The young man nodded slightly, gazing at Yuanshan Mountain, his expression changing as he saw Qinghong and Shuangluo emerge.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The young man snapped his fan shut, his eyes alight with admiration.</p><p>“What a pair of peerless beauties!”</p>
