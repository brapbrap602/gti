<h1>Chapter 772: Anomaly</h1><p>Flying Night Devil entered the depths of the Ghost Lands. Aside from accidentally disturbing some wraiths, it didn't encounter any powerful spectral beings.</p><p>This space was vast, with mountains of bones. Countless ancient cultivators had perished here, their souls imprisoned, their minds lost, transformed into wraiths, eternally trapped.</p><p>However, the Ghost Lands had a boundary.</p><p>Flying Night Devil reached the end and touched a sheer cliff face.</p><p>Piles of white bones, broken swords, and shattered armor testified to the ferocity of past battles.</p><p>Other than that, there was nothing noticeably unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Flying Night Devil to continue exploring along one side, then he stepped out of the area enveloped by the Demonic Fire aura.</p><p>He flashed into the ghost mist, arriving before a small pile of bones, and flicked a gust of wind with his finger.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A skeleton, struck by the wind, shattered instantly.</p><p>Startled by Qin Sang, several white shadows rushed out from the bone pile, lunging at him. These wraiths opened their mouths wide, their cries filled with intense resentment.</p><p>Sensing the aura of a living being emanating from Qin Sang, they were even more frenzied than those encountered by Flying Night Devil earlier, craving his flesh and blood.</p><p>Facing the clawing wraiths, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. He snorted coldly and reached out with his hand.</p><p>True Essence burst forth from his palm, surging out and forming a pocket that enveloped all the wraiths. Then, it abruptly tightened.</p><p>The wraiths instinctively sensed danger, but they were powerless against Qin Sang. Enveloped by the True Essence, they were compressed into a fist-sized ball of ghostly Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned with his hand, and the ghostly Qi landed in his palm.</p><p>The wraiths continued to shriek, pale ghostly faces appearing within the ball of Qi in turn, mouths agape, eyes vacant, expressions twisted in agony.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the wraiths coldly, their screams having no effect on him.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, his eyes changed. He softly commanded, "Condense!"</p><p>His True Essence churned, and mysterious and eerie restrictions emerged. In an instant, his True Essence turned black under the influence of the restrictions, becoming incredibly sinister.</p><p>At the same time, the black True Essence began to compress inwards.</p><p>The wraiths trapped within screamed in pain, their expressions even more distorted, but they remained powerless.</p><p>Qin Sang was utilizing the secret technique he had obtained from Yi Tiannie, attempting to refine Soul Threads. This technique was derived from a sinister art of the demonic and ghostly paths, both malicious and evil.</p><p>Unlike the previous time in the Bear Mountain region, these wraiths, after being refined by the sinister art, left nothing behind. Their spirituality had long been lost, making reincarnation impossible.</p><p>As the wraiths vanished, a length of Soul Thread appeared in Qin Sang's palm, writhing around his fingertip like a living thing.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. "The wraiths here can indeed be refined into Soul Threads. Unfortunately, Soul Threads need a banner pole to exist permanently. The banner pole isn't finished yet. I'll have to wait until the next time I enter the Seven Kill Hall to refine more. However, this is a great surprise. Based on Flying Night Devil's earlier exploration, the number of wraiths in this space is vast, enough to refine more than a dozen Ten Yama Banners. After leaving, I can focus on preparing the Spirit Formation for smelting the Profound Iron Pillars…"</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang dispersed the Soul Thread in his hand and chose the opposite direction from Flying Night Devil, intending to explore every corner of the Ghost Lands to avoid any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>The next time he entered, he would focus solely on refining Soul Threads, with no time for distractions.</p><p>Qin Sang and Flying Night Devil searched the Ghost Lands separately, one on the left, one on the right. Qin Sang unsealed his Corpse Pill, shrouding himself in corpse Qi to mask his life force, perfectly blending into the ghost mist.</p><p>After a thorough search, Qin Sang was completely at ease.</p><p>This place was safe, populated only by wraiths, making it an ideal location for refining Soul Threads.</p><p>He recalled Flying Night Devil and decided to leave the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone and head to the Heavenly Tower. Time was ample, and he could thoroughly search for the ancient传送阵 within the tower.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered repeatedly as he sped towards the exit of the Ghost Lands.</p><p>Flying Night Devil also hurried back.</p><p>It moved swiftly and easily through the ghost mist.</p><p>The grayish-white mist parted before Flying Night Devil, creating a passage. Behind it, the mist churned, ghostly figures seeming to appear and disappear within.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, nearly back at the entrance to the Ghost Lands, abruptly stopped, his expression changing. He turned sharply towards Flying Night Devil's location!</p><p>Without hesitation, he activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and Sword Flight within the Ghost Lands. A streak of light pierced through the ghost mist at astonishing speed, startling countless wraiths.</p><p>In a short time, Qin Sang arrived at an open space. Looking at the empty ground, his face was grim.</p><p>Flying Night Devil was gone!</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had sensed Flying Night Devil being attacked.</p><p>The attack was sudden. The enemy, silent and unseen, appeared from behind. Flying Night Devil, unaware until the last moment, was struck.</p><p>Due to the distance, Qin Sang couldn't issue commands in time, leaving Flying Night Devil to rely on its instincts.</p><p>Flying Night Devil resisted fiercely. The enemy didn't seem powerful and couldn't subdue it instantly.</p><p>But then, something strange happened. Flying Night Devil, for some inexplicable reason, ceased resisting and was dragged by an unknown force into the depths of the ghost mist, vanishing without a trace.</p><p>Even more alarming, during this process, the connection between Qin Sang and Flying Night Devil rapidly weakened until he completely lost contact.</p><p>Their connection was based on a soul mark within Flying Night Devil, indicating that the mark had been obscured or erased.</p><p>This unexpected incident caught Qin Sang off guard. Through Flying Night Devil, he only sensed a vague shadow, not even glimpsing the assailant's appearance.</p><p>Sensing the anomaly, Qin Sang immediately rushed to the rescue with all his might, but he was too late. Flying Night Devil had been dragged into the depths of the ghost mist, disappearing completely.</p><p>The place was empty and silent.</p><p>"What is lurking in the shadows?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with anger.</p><p>He and Flying Night Devil had searched separately, confirming only the presence of weak wraiths. He hadn't expected an unknown spectral being to be hidden within the ghost mist, spying on them and snatching Flying Night Devil.</p><p>This spectral being was not only adept at stealth and ambush but also knew how to target his soul mark, indicating high intelligence, unlike the mindless wraiths.</p><p>Why would such an anomaly exist within the Ghost Lands?</p><p>Besides him, no one in the cultivation world could have passed through the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and entered this place.</p><p>Even if a cultivator's soul remained, it would have lost its mind over the endless years, becoming a muddled wraith. Could a wraith have mutated?</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted, fixated on the direction where Flying Night Devil had disappeared. He summoned the Ten Yama Banner and gave chase at full speed.</p><p>All signs pointed to the opponent not being powerful, but possessing incredibly strange abilities.</p><p>As his cultivation advanced, Flying Night Devil's usefulness would diminish, but it still possessed the strength of early Core Formation and remained a powerful asset. Qin Sang couldn't allow it to be taken so inexplicably.</p>
