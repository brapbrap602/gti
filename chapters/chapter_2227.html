<h1>Chapter 2217: Flying Spirit Falls</h1><p>While a female cultivator collected the Skywind Tree, meteors descended onto two stone platforms nearby.</p><p>A longsword, sheathless, fell onto the platform to her left.  A faint aura emanated from it, revealing it to be a spiritual treasure, though its power remained unknown.</p><p>On the platform to her right, a bamboo scroll appeared, revealing a title inscribed in four small golden characters –  "Misty Moon Frost Bloom."</p><p>Many cultivators present possessed spiritual treasures, but most looked towards the scroll.  Several showed interest upon reading the inscription.</p><p>"Misty Moon Frost Bloom" is a secret technique that once flourished among the Water Tribes.  Remarkably, many tribes could cultivate it, integrating it into their innate divine abilities.</p><p>Legend says its creator later became a Saint Realm powerhouse, and this technique was their magnum opus before reaching the Saint Realm. It's not merely an offensive technique; understanding its intricacies might allow one to grasp the creator's state of mind at the time.</p><p>However, this technique later vanished, known only by name to the current generation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A white rainbow shot out from the ancestors' disciples' camp, transforming into a white silk in mid-air, unfurling and extending towards the platform.</p><p>A fair-faced youth gracefully floated onto the silk, walking across it as if on a path.  With flowing robes and exceptional bearing, he effortlessly reached the platform and bowed to the person there.</p><p>"I am Bai Bo. May I ask your name?"</p><p>"Cang Hao!"</p><p>The person on the platform was also a youth, but his cheeks resembled fish gills, making him considerably less attractive.</p><p>He hailed from the Misty Sea.</p><p>Both camps had established rules: no other restrictions, anyone could choose a platform first.</p><p>"I've heard of this secret technique for many years and longed to study it, but had no chance.  Seeing it now, I'm overjoyed, please forgive my intrusion!" Bai Bo bowed.</p><p>Cang Hao frowned, "Do common cultivators have the right to participate in this trial?"</p><p>"One must try to find out."</p><p>Bai Bo glanced skyward, then pointed outside the mountain, "This place is cramped; let's fight outside!"</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The white silk shattered, its fragments scattering.  Strange changes then occurred in the void.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>The sound of crashing waves filled the air. The silk had transformed the void into a vast expanse of water, a deep, azure blue.</p><p>Just as Bai Bo and Cang Hao flew off the platform, the water spread, engulfing them.</p><p>Cang Hao didn't resist, but before submerging, he opened his gills, emitting a roar like thunder and wind, instantly causing the water to churn violently.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>Shortly after they entered the water, huge waves surged, and a giant unicorn whale surfaced.  Just its head appeared, resembling a small mountain.</p><p>Half its body leaped from the water before diving down.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Those watching outside could feel the whale's terrifying impact.  Few could escape unscathed from its horn.</p><p>The water then began to spin rapidly, forming a vortex that almost covered the entire water expanse.</p><p>The swirling water pulled the unicorn whale into the vortex's center.</p><p>Bai Bo's water expanse, created with his treasure, was being used against him.</p><p>The unicorn whale and the vortex collided with earth-shattering force.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>After a stalemate, the unicorn whale's horn pierced the vortex's center. The vortex halted abruptly, then with a 'boom', shattered, the water reverting to the white silk fragments.</p><p>Cang Hao fell from the fragments, the whale's horn almost piercing his chest.</p><p>Cang Hao retreated, shouting, "Your skill surpasses mine, I yield!"</p><p>The unicorn whale stopped its pursuit.  Its body, composed of water, retracted. Bai Bo reappeared, offered a polite concession, and gathered the silk fragments.</p><p>The fragments returned to Bai Bo, but failed to reform.  Frowning, he stored them in his sleeve and returned to the platform.</p><p>Seeing no new competitors, he followed the female cultivator's example, refining the platform, and then used his spiritual energy to grasp the scroll.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his spiritual energy hand was shattered by a powerful force. The scroll then shot into the sky.</p><p>In an instant, it vanished from sight.</p><p>All the ancestors' disciples, including Bai Bo, wore grim expressions.</p><p>It was clear that the powerful figures behind the scenes had deliberately excluded certain individuals.  In contrast, the Mist Sea cultivators received rewards simply by stepping onto the stone platforms, naturally boosting their enthusiasm.</p><p>On the stone platform beside her, the ancestor's disciple eyed the sword before him.  Sensing an approaching presence from beyond the mountain, he felt a significant headache coming on.</p><p>The two exchanged names and immediately clashed.</p><p>As they fought fiercely, meteors rained down from the heavens, quickly illuminating the divine mountain with firelight.</p><p>"Look, what kind of pill is that?"</p><p>"Hey! That broken spear… it looks like the legendary Yanhuang Divine Spear! An elder once used it to great effect."</p><p>"And that!  It's a Yulu shell! The Yulu clan vanished from the Great Thousand World long ago. Legend says their shells possessed extraordinary power, arousing human greed that led to their extinction…"</p><p>…</p><p>Each falling meteor brought a rare treasure, eliciting gasps of wonder.  Pills, spiritual treasures, precious materials, cultivation techniques – everything imaginable was present, each item of immense value.</p><p>The distribution of these treasures was clearly orchestrated.  The lowest landing point was never below the middle of the mountain, with the higher the location, the greater the value of the treasure.</p><p>"It seems Hongtian and the others intend to drive those ancestor's disciples to the foot of the mountain.  I wonder what secret lies at the summit…" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>At that moment, another meteor fell, causing a collective gasp. Its landing point was a stone platform near the mountaintop.</p><p>Following the pattern, this treasure should surpass all previous ones in value.  When Qin Sang saw what it was, he silently confirmed his suspicions. It was one of the treasures he had his eye on.</p><p>The meteor contained a jade pendant.  To be precise, the pendant itself wasn't the most valuable thing; it represented eligibility – possessing it granted access to a treasure land called Feiling Waterfall.</p><p>It was said that immersing spiritual treasures in Feiling Waterfall for a period could greatly enhance their spirituality, potentially giving birth to a spirit and transforming them into innate spiritual treasures. No cultivator could resist such a temptation.</p><p>Each of the treasures Qin Sang coveted was invaluable, and he estimated their landing spots would be roughly the same. The situation was unfolding differently than he anticipated.  Relying solely on personal strength to compete for the top positions was clearly insufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed the surrounding cultivators. Many eyes shone with avarice at the jade pendant within the meteor, including the Avian Prince! If this meteor had landed on the peak, he would have undoubtedly dashed for it.  The Avian Prince possessed extremely high cultivation and the support of Avian experts; only the Mermaid Queen and a few others could contend with him.</p><p>Even without the Avian Prince, the other contenders were formidable, each backed by powerful forces.  To participate in the competition for such treasures, Qin Sang would either need to persuade the Yuanxiang Clan Chief to assist him, or he would have to face numerous powerful opponents alone.</p><p>"Windmill Copper!"</p><p>Yuan Ren suddenly spotted a treasure, his eyes lighting up. He did a backflip, attempting to leap onto the divine mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang looked and saw that Yuan Ren's target was a millstone-sized copper block, yellowish in color with black patterns resembling wind on its surface – Windmill Copper, a precious material.</p><p>A block of this size was extremely valuable, but however much there was, it remained just a material, far inferior to something like access to Feiling Waterfall.  The landing point of the Windmill Copper also indicated its value – still some distance from the summit – yet it was enough to tempt Yuan Ren.</p><p>"Get back here!"</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief, quick-eyed and quick-handed, grabbed Yuan Ren by the scruff of the neck and threw him to the ground.  Everyone was stunned by the Clan Chief's ferocity.</p><p>"Big Brother…"</p><p>Yuan Ren, unharmed, scrambled to his feet, completely bewildered.</p><p>"Have you lost your mind?!" the Yuanxiang Clan Chief scolded, his face dark.  "Doesn't our clan treasury have Windmill Copper?  Why this particular piece?"</p><p>"But… I only need Windmill Copper. The one in the clan is only fist-sized…" Yuan Ren mumbled, not feeling he'd done anything wrong.  Other treasures, however good, were not what he wanted, so he didn't take them.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan Chief sighed inwardly.  Yuan Ren's mentality was rare, but inconvenient at the wrong time.</p><p>"Without my command, you are not to move!" the Yuanxiang Clan Chief roared.</p><p>"Oh," Yuan Ren rubbed his head and obediently stood aside.</p><p>By this time, many cultivators had already stormed the divine mountain, creating battlefields within and outside, engaging in fierce combat.  Most were individuals with little backing; the major and powerful clans were still observing.</p><p>Someone whispered a few words into the Yuanxiang Clan Chief's ear.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader furrowed his brow.  After a moment, he turned and approached Qin Sang.</p><p>“Master Qin…”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed what the Yuanxiang clan leader wanted to say and glanced at Hong Yue.</p><p>Hong Yue remained unmoved and silent.</p><p>Both the Yuanxiang clan leader and Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  It seemed Hong Tian had no intention of accepting the Yuanxiang clan.  This left the Yuanxiang clan leader with only one option: to seek favor with the Jiaojiao clan leader.</p><p>Having allied themselves with different powerful figures in the Sacred Realm, even with their close relationship, they could no longer easily cooperate in this situation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang heard Hong Yue's voice transmission:  “Master Qin, I will help you secure a position…”</p><p>After a pause, Hong Yue added, “But Master Qin should act within your means!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The Zhuhuai clan was merely a vassal clan of the Yuren clan, unable to compare with the superior clans. Hong Yue was the only support Hong Tian offered him, and thankfully, Hong Tian didn't have unrealistic expectations.</p><p>The situation of those ancestor's disciples had become extremely passive. Those competing for positions near the Mist Sea received rewards, their enthusiasm palpable.  In contrast, their side could only watch the treasures longingly, a scattered group. How could they compete like this?</p><p>At this rate, most of them would be relegated to the foot of the mountain; the positions near the summit were simply out of reach!</p><p>Several insightful individuals, like Xi Rui, eloquently explained the dangers, urging everyone to unite. The idea that sacrifice leads to gain seemed to bear some fruit.</p><p>Just then, a woman in palace attire, standing beside Xi Rui, flew towards the sacred mountain. The stone platform she chose was near the summit!</p><p>The Jiao Ren Queen and the Yuren Prince looked back at their followers.</p><p>Immediately, a man in a green robe flew out from the crowd, laughing heartily. “I happen to be quite interested in that bottle of Linghuan Sand. If you are wise, you will withdraw.”</p><p>The woman in palace attire coldly snorted, "You should be the one to withdraw!"</p><p>As soon as she spoke, several figures surged from the crowd, flying behind the palace-attired woman, glaring at the man in green and unleashing a powerful aura.</p><p>Only one could win. These individuals chose to support the woman, knowing that regardless of the outcome, they would be among the losers. However, the woman had promised them compensation.</p><p>The man in green was Zhu Yi, from a superior clan of the Water Department.  Unafraid of the strong opposition, he gave an order, and his clan's elite warriors, along with those of their vassal clans, soared into the air.</p><p>Both sides faced each other, their auras clashing in the air.</p><p>Sensing the disturbance, others fighting nearby unanimously avoided the area, leaving the battlefield to them.</p><p>With Zhu Yi's clan's intervention, a fierce battle between top powers began.</p><p>Meteors continued to fall. Qin Sang's astral body remained motionless, eyes fixed on the sky, awaiting new meteors.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's physical body slowly rose, gazing at the cave Liuli had created, his expression grave.</p><p>He sensed a change in aura – Liuli was breaking through her bottleneck!</p><p>Shortly after, the ground shook, and the spiritual energy around the cave fluctuated wildly.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, and thick fog billowed, masking the disturbance.</p><p>However, as time passed, the fluctuations intensified, making concealment increasingly difficult. This was actually a good sign, indicating Liuli's progress was very smooth.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a mixture of joy and worry.  He was happy that Master Ning hadn't exaggerated; at this rate, Liuli should be able to break through.</p><p>He worried that the situation had completely deviated from their expectations. The sacred mountain had attracted many powerful individuals, and he was uncertain what impact this would have on the Illusory Domain and Liuli's tribulation!</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang gazed into the depths of the Illusory Domain.</p><p>Most near the sacred mountain were captivated by the battles and the falling meteors, few noticing a faint moon rising on the horizon.</p><p>“The moon's shadow appears, the timing is perfect…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. The moon's shadow was a signal, signifying that the moment they had been waiting for was approaching.</p><p>A violent wind howled, accompanied by thunder.</p><p>Liuli's breakthrough caused a startling celestial phenomenon.  Moreover, Qin Sang faintly sensed the suppression of heavenly might; Heaven itself had taken notice!</p><p>Qin Sang vanished, leaving the mountain to avoid being affected.</p><p>He stood on another mountain, far from Liuli's cave, quietly observing the celestial phenomena without making unnecessary movements, for heavenly might was extremely difficult to conceal.</p><p>“What? That fluctuation… is it heavenly might?”</p><p>“A heavenly tribulation! Who is undergoing tribulation!”</p><p>“Impossible! How could someone be undergoing tribulation here?”</p><p>…</p><p>The fluctuations of heavenly might spread to the vicinity of the sacred mountain, shocking everyone who sensed them.</p><p>It was clearly the aura of a three-fold tribulation!  Could someone be breaking through to the Sacred Realm in the midst of battle? Who was audacious enough to do so here?</p><p>However, those present soon noticed something amiss – the heavenly might was too weak, reminding them of their own breakthroughs to the second level of the Void Realm.</p><p>But this was also illogical.  How could someone at the first level of the Void Realm enter the Sacred Land?</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader glanced at Qin Sang. Besides Qin Sang, only he knew the truth.</p>
