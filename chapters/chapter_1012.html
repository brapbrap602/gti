<h1>Chapter 1004: Trials</h1><p>Chapter 1004: Trials</p><p>The situation in the Demon Sea is volatile.</p><p>Qin Sang spent a long time researching and finally determined his target.</p><p>He initially planned to ask Yuan Zhu about the distribution of demon clans' forces within the Demon Sea.</p><p>The area explored by cultivators was limited, confined to the area between Tian Wu Island and Da Huang Island, and a nearby stretch of sea. Yuan Zhu, being from the Jiao Long clan, must possess extensive knowledge of the demon tribes.</p><p>However, Qin Sang reconsidered; the question was too sensitive.</p><p>He and Yuan Zhu were of different species, brought together by chance, developing a certain degree of friendship.</p><p>Only the Jiao Long King and other demon kings had betrayed Yuan Zhu, not the entire demon race.  His purpose was to cultivate by slaying demons; Yuan Zhu wouldn't, and couldn't, stop him, but neither would he aid in the slaughter of his own kind.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to avoid mentioning it altogether, to prevent any friction.</p><p>He didn't board a ship. Leaving Da Huang Island, he summoned his Jiao Soul Chariot and flew alone into the depths of the Demon Sea.</p><p>En route, Qin Sang studied the secret technique Yuan Zhu had given him.</p><p>The greatest dangers in the Demon Sea were beast tides and transformed great demons.  With this secret technique, combined with the "Heavenly Demon Transformation," he believed that as long as he wasn't too reckless, he should be able to navigate the Demon Sea freely.</p><p>Initially, he occasionally encountered other cultivators.</p><p>As Qin Sang ventured deeper, cultivators became increasingly scarce, until the sea became a demon beast's domain.</p><p>Years later.</p><p>On a deserted island.</p><p>The vegetation withered, a bleak scene.</p><p>Except for the occasional chirping of insects deep within the jungle, the vast island was eerily silent; no birdsong, no roars of beasts.</p><p>The dry grass swayed, and a figure slowly emerged – Qin Sang.</p><p>A Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched on his shoulder, its large eyes wide open.</p><p>After surveying the island for a moment, Qin Sang flicked his wrist, and a ring flew out, its light flashing as it released a beast trapped within the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring – a golden-scaled giant python.</p><p>Despite Qin Sang's significantly increased strength, capturing another spirit beast as powerful and intelligent as the two-headed… [creature name unclear in original text] proved extremely difficult.</p><p>Over the past few years, he had traveled throughout the Demon Sea, searching for a suitable spirit beast, finally catching this golden-scaled python.</p><p>Among mid-Core Formation demon beasts, this python was relatively strong, but its intelligence was far inferior to the two-headed… [creature name unclear in original text]; it couldn't act independently. Its greatest use would be as bait.</p><p>The golden-scaled python was ferocious and untamed.  As soon as it was released from the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, it reared up, its vertical pupils fixing a cold, dark gaze on Qin Sang.</p><p>It was clear that if Qin Sang's strength ever waned and he couldn’t control it, the python would without hesitation devour its master.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed forward, his voice a thunderclap, stunning the golden-scaled python.</p><p>The python's eyes flashed with fury; unwilling, but bound by the magical artifact, it could only submit, silently slithering towards the depths of the island.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>A tiger's roar suddenly echoed from ahead, like a clap of thunder.</p><p>The small island trembled, dead leaves rustled down, and the dry grass flattened under the sound wave.</p><p>Simultaneously, the golden-scaled python shrieked.</p><p>Qin Sang had been stealthily following, standing in a tall tree, watching the swirling dust as the two beasts clashed.</p><p>The golden-scaled python was clearly at a disadvantage; its opponent was a tiger demon.</p><p>"Late Core Formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled with satisfaction.  "This tiger demon must be the ruler of this area!"</p><p>Deep within the Demon Sea, without a nautical chart, Qin Sang could only search for beasts himself. He had spent a long time in this area before discovering clues, leading him to the tiger demon's lair.</p><p>The golden-scaled python was losing ground, showing signs of defeat.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer, his figure flashing as he darted onto the battlefield. He pointed at the tiger demon, his true essence surging, his Blackwood Sword appearing.</p><p>The sword hummed, a dazzling beam of light transforming into a giant sword, descending upon the tiger demon!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The tiger demon realized that Qin Sang was the greater threat. It vibrated its tiger paw, forcefully sending the python flying.</p><p>Its mouth opened wide, emitting a cloud of demon fog.</p><p>Amid the chaos, the tiger demon's form shifted, seemingly attempting to evade the sword. Its body tensed, radiating a violent aura, as if it were about to charge and kill Qin Sang.</p><p>A true overlord, indeed powerful.</p><p>The stench of blood filled the air.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang showed no sign of panic; he had effortlessly anticipated the tiger demon's move. Calmly, he lightly tapped his Blackwood Sword, and the sword wheel reappeared!</p><p>This sword wheel was even denser and brighter than before.</p><p>Qin Sang, while honing his swordsmanship, gained insights into the sword path. Though he hadn't yet grasped the subtleties of sword techniques, he felt he was headed in the right direction and continued to refine his sword wheel.</p><p>His spirit sword and sword wheel both improved, the latter's power far exceeding its previous capabilities.  Like a blazing sun, it illuminated the deserted island, whirling towards the tiger demon.</p><p>In an instant, blood splattered.  Even late-stage Golden Core cultivators would find such a powerful demon troublesome and prefer to avoid conflict.  Yet, the tiger demon's powerful body was injured by the sword wheel, its claws dripping with blood. Had the demon been less vigilant, its limb might have been severed.</p><p>The intense pain enraged the tiger demon. Its roar was distorted. It let out a furious bellow, its aura surging. A colossal shadow, resembling a giant tiger dozens of feet tall, materialized behind it, looming over Qin Sang and creating immense pressure.</p><p>Instead of fear, Qin Sang felt excitement. The stronger the demon, the greater the pressure, and the more effective the training.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword wheel collided with the tiger's shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang engaged the tiger demon solely with his sword techniques, completely immersed in the battle.  The clash was massive, extending from the island into the sea.  Disappointingly, the demon displayed no further abilities beyond the giant shadow.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The shadow was shattered by the sword wheel.  The tiger demon let out a mournful cry and fled.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to pursue when he sensed something, abruptly turning his head north. A feeling of unease washed over him.  He decisively retracted his spirit sword and launched a star-shaped projectile.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The tiger demon died instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the demon's corpse, his three-colored escaping light flashing as he fled without hesitation.</p><p>Shortly after his departure, a gale swept in.  A figure emerged from the waves, flickering into view on the island.  Seeing the ravaged landscape, it let out a cold snort.</p><p>The newcomer was humanoid with a beast's tail—a transformed demon!</p><p>"Impressive escape technique. No wonder it dared to run rampant!  Hmm? This aura… Could the intel be wrong?  Not a cultivator, but some shameless old geezer bullying the young?"</p><p>The demon sniffed, eyeing Qin Sang's direction with suspicion, ultimately deciding against pursuit.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had repeatedly changed direction, escaping to a considerable distance.  For days, he'd sensed a change in the atmosphere, suspecting his recent high-profile actions and prolonged stay in this sea area had attracted the attention of the demon race.</p><p>"A transformed demon personally dispatched. I was discovered. I can't stay here. I'd better find a more remote sea area…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.  Being cornered by a transformed demon would be extremely dangerous.  He found a secluded spot, quickly processed the demon corpse, and continued southward.</p>
