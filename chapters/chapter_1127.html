<h1>Chapter 1119: The Nascent Soul Tribulation</h1><p>For over ten days, the waters remained calm and undisturbed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu took advantage of this period to separately scout the surrounding waters, eliminating any potential dangers.</p><p>At dawn, they returned from afar and landed on the island.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak, when suddenly, an inexplicable pressure emerged without warning. Its source was the small island where Yunyouzi resided.</p><p>At first, the pressure was faint, but it sent shivers down the spines of Qin Sang and Li Yufu.</p><p>Immediately after, the spiritual energy in the surrounding heavens and earth began to fluctuate violently.</p><p>In an instant, the once calm waters were whipped into a frenzy, with towering waves crashing against the shore. A terrifying storm was about to descend.</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu exchanged a glance, their expressions turning grave.</p><p>"It's the Heavenly Tribulation!" Qin Sang said in a low voice, speaking quickly. "As we discussed earlier, you guard the north. I'll take care of the other directions."</p><p>"Understood!" Li Yufu wasted no time, immediately mounting his sword and flying northward, leaving behind a trail of thunderous echoes.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's guidance, he had already mastered the Sword Energy Thunderclap technique.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the vortex at the center of the storm, summoned his white crane, and sent a message to Bai.</p><p>"Go and guard the west. If any demonic beasts appear, kill them on sight."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed westward, and the white crane eagerly took off. Having been confined in the Peach Blossom Valley for so long, it was finally free to stretch its wings, its cries filled with excitement.</p><p>Soon after, Bai and Qin Sang also set off, heading east and south respectively.</p><p>Four Golden Core-level experts now guarded the island.</p><p>Meanwhile, the storm grew increasingly fierce.</p><p>At the center of the storm, the grand formation could no longer conceal itself, and the spirit island emerged into view.</p><p>Yunyouzi stood alone atop a mountain peak, gazing up at the heavens.</p><p>It was midday, and the sky had been clear just moments ago. But with the arrival of the storm, dark clouds appeared out of nowhere, blanketing the sky in mere moments.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>The dark clouds rumbled with thunder, and streaks of lightning danced across the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air some distance away, his eyes fixed on the spirit island.</p><p>Suddenly, a brilliant light erupted from the center of the storm. Amidst the dazzling radiance, the shadows of spirit banners and precious mirrors appeared, forming a massive light barrier that enveloped Yunyouzi.</p><p>"What a powerful spirit formation!"</p><p>Even from this distance, Qin Sang could sense the formidable power of the formation.</p><p>He knew that such an intricate formation must have been meticulously prepared by Yunyouzi to aid in his tribulation. Seeing that Yunyouzi had made such thorough preparations, Qin Sang felt slightly reassured.</p><p>Surrounded by the spirit formation, Yunyouzi was obscured by the illusions conjured by the precious mirrors and spirit banners. Even with his Heavenly Eye technique activated, Qin Sang couldn't clearly see Yunyouzi's true form or ascertain his condition.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderclap echoed, and the clouds grew thicker.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced upward.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Tribulation consisted of wind, thunder, fire, and the inner demon tribulation. What they were witnessing now was merely the prelude to the formation of the Nascent Soul. The first tribulation wasn't even the thunder tribulation, yet the thunder within the dark clouds already carried such terrifying power.</p><p>When the true thunder tribulation arrived, its ferocity would be unimaginable.</p><p>The space around them grew dim.</p><p>Gigantic waves surged.</p><p>The storm intensified.</p><p>Yet, the spirit formation around Yunyouzi remained radiant, showing no signs of weakening.</p><p>As time passed, the fluctuations of spiritual energy grew more violent.</p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth became restless, forming visible waves that surged toward the spirit island like a whale drawing in water, converging above Yunyouzi's head.</p><p>Compared to the scope of influence during Qin Sang's Golden Core formation, Yunyouzi's current impact was like comparing a small stream to a vast ocean.</p><p>Pure spiritual energy merged and compressed in the air, sparkling with points of light, creating a dreamlike scene reminiscent of a starry sky.</p><p>The starry sky hung high above, with starlight converging into a flowing river of stars.</p><p>Before long, a deafening roar shook the heavens and earth. The starry sky suddenly contracted, and the boundless spiritual energy transformed into a blinding pillar of light that descended from the sky!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The spirit island trembled, and for a moment, the storm and thunder seemed to pause.</p><p>At the same time, where the starry sky had been, vibrant clouds of seven colors inexplicably appeared, more vivid and beautiful than the most stunning sunset.</p><p>"It's done!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu exclaimed simultaneously, but their hearts grew even more tense.</p><p>The appearance of the colorful clouds, with the spiritual energy still intact, indicated that Yunyouzi had successfully condensed his Nascent Soul. Only one hurdle remained—the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, the brief pause ended, and the storm, dark clouds, and lightning began to fiercely retaliate, displaying the full might of heaven and earth, striking fear into all who witnessed it.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed that the radiant light of the spirit formation around Yunyouzi began to flicker uncertainly.</p><p>"The Heavenly Tribulation has begun!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>This was the first time he had witnessed a Heavenly Tribulation firsthand, and he recalled the information he had read before.</p><p>It was said that among the myriad living beings in the world, each faced a different Heavenly Tribulation on their path of cultivation.</p><p>For cultivators, the first two tribulations were the Yin Fire and the Soul Wind, followed by the Heavenly Thunder.</p><p>The Yin Fire ignited from the Yongquan acupoint at the base of the body, burning upward through the Muddy Pellet Palace. If the physical body was weak, the internal organs would turn to ash, and the limbs would decay. The Soul Wind, on the other hand, arose within the soul, like a blade scraping bone, piercing through the Purple Mansion.</p><p>Although these two tribulations also affected the external world, their manifestations were not as grand.</p><p>Fortunately, the strength of these three tribulations varied. The Soul Wind and Yin Fire were less powerful than the Heavenly Thunder. As long as one wasn't too reckless and made adequate preparations, they could generally survive the first two tribulations.</p><p>Moreover, both the physical body and the soul would gain significant benefits after enduring these tribulations.</p><p>The true life-and-death struggle lay in the Heavenly Thunder and the Inner Demon Tribulation!</p><p>"The Yin Fire has already ignited."</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the center of the storm, noticing the fluctuations in the spirit formation, and thought to himself.</p><p>The Yin Fire and Soul Wind tribulations were nothing to worry about. Qin Sang shifted his gaze, carefully scanning the surroundings to ensure no ill-intentioned individuals had infiltrated the area, potentially disrupting Yunyouzi's tribulation.</p><p>Uncertain about the white crane's situation, he moved swiftly, patrolling back and forth.</p><p>Some minor demons at the bottom of the lake, startled by the power of the Heavenly Tribulation, chose to flee in panic, none daring to approach.</p><p>Seeing that all was quiet, Qin Sang returned to his original position, his eyes fixed on the center of the storm.</p><p>At that moment, he noticed that the storm had grown even more violent. Around Yunyouzi, the space had become darker than before, and the wind seemed to take on a tangible form, as if a layer of gray mist had descended.</p><p>"Is this the Soul Wind? The Yin Fire has been successfully overcome."</p><p>Qin Sang was too far away to sense the power of the Soul Wind.</p><p>He glanced upward at the churning dark clouds and the continuous thunder.</p><p>"After overcoming the Soul Wind, the Heavenly Thunder is next."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his gaze returning to the center of the storm. Suddenly, his brow furrowed.</p><p>"Why does the manifestation of this gray Soul Wind seem a bit unusual?"</p><p>According to the records Qin Sang had read, the external manifestation of the Soul Wind usually signified the arrival of the tribulation's most powerful moment, after which it would gradually weaken.</p><p>But now, it seemed something unexpected had occurred!</p><p>The gray Soul Wind continued to gather, forming a thick, impenetrable barrier.</p><p>The surrounding storm, influenced by this, became even more ferocious. The waves near the spirit island grew exceptionally violent, showing no signs of abating.</p><p>Amidst the raging wind and rain, one couldn't help but worry that the spirit island might be torn apart.</p><p>This tribulation showed no signs of ending!</p><p>"What's going on? Could the records be inaccurate, or has something happened to Yunyouzi?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened as he stared intently at the center of the storm.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I slacked off for nothing and now have to stay up late to catch up. The next update will be very late, so everyone should get some rest early.</p>
