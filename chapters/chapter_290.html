<h1>**Chapter 283: Autumn Swan Market**</h1><p>The ancient immortal's cave, where Autumn Swan Market was located, consisted of two layers—inner and outer.</p><p>Due to the great fame of Autumn Swan Market, later generations became accustomed to referring to the cave with the market's name instead.</p><p>The outer layer was just outside the protective formation, also known as the real Autumn Swan Market.</p><p>As the protective energy of the restriction gradually weakened over the years due to various reasons, it was first discovered and established into a market by the owner of Autumn Swan Market to deceive people.</p><p>Later, the market was destroyed by the Cloud Beast, and this place became ruins. The remnants of the restriction were also completely destroyed and could not be repaired, so it was completely abandoned and exposed to the world, becoming a lair for the Cloud Beast.</p><p>Therefore, every time the protective formation reached its low point and everyone gathered at Autumn Swan Market, they had to first join forces to clear out the Cloud Beast that occupied the area.</p><p>There wasn't much to say about the protective formation. It contained wind, water, fire, and earth, balancing yin and yang. Every time one entered the formation, the formation encountered would change.</p><p>Yu Kong just briefly described the experience from his last visit. The probability of encountering the same formation was very low this time.</p><p>Yu Kong focused on introducing what the crowd cared about most—several hidden treasure locations within the cave.</p><p>The original appearance of the cave was a towering green mountain. Although the mountain was large, it had been thoroughly searched. There were five places recognized as key locations where treasures could be found.</p><p>The first to be discovered, and the place the cave owner valued the most, was a place referred to as the Worshiping Hall.</p><p>There was no plaque above the Worshiping Hall, but it was built on the mountaintop, the highest point in the entire cave. There was a clay statue enshrined in the hall, from which one could tell that the cave owner showed great respect to it.</p><p>Everyone suspected that the clay statue was likely the ancestor of the cave owner, so some also referred to the place as the Grandmaster Hall.</p><p>As the location of the Worshiping Hall was unusual, its significance was extraordinary and very eye-catching. From the beginning, this hall became the most important target for intruders. The restrictions of the hall had been breached early on, and every single treasure stored within, none of which were of poor quality, had been taken away.</p><p>Even so, there were still many people who repeatedly searched the Worshiping Hall, even the clay statue had been turned over. After discovering that it had indeed been completely looted, they finally relinquished the place.</p><p>Now, only a few people were left seeking their luck there.</p><p>The next was a unique existence second only to the Worshiping Hall, called the Secret Jade Wall. It was embedded in the back mountain cliff.</p><p>Meditating quietly while seated in front of the Secret Jade Wall gave one a chance to receive the heritage of the cave owner.</p><p>It was said that a Golden Core cultivator had once tried to take away the Jade Wall, cleaving the mountain cliff with his palm but failing to injure the Jade Wall in the slightest. Instead, he was injured by the restriction and never returned again.</p><p>However, no one had yet figured out the conditions for receiving the heritage, and the greater probability was that one would gain nothing and have to leave when the protective formation was about to recover, making the trip pointless.</p><p>Therefore, very few people now went to meditate in front of the Secret Jade Wall.</p><p>Aside from these, there were seven places scattered throughout the mountains that resembled the Spirit Treasure Pavilions. These seven places were also the main targets of those who entered the cave now.</p><p>All kinds of magical tools, medicinal pills, and jade slips could be found in the Spirit Treasure Pavilions, but the treasures and restrictions within each of the seven pavilions varied greatly.</p><p>Sometimes, the amount one gained depended not only on one's strength but also on luck.</p><p>Yu Kong did not conceal his objective, which was a Spirit Treasure Pavilion located in the back mountain.</p><p>This was because the pavilion was the furthest, its restrictions were strong enough to deter some people, and he had gone there on his previous visit, so with his previous experience, he was confident in gaining more treasures this time.</p><p>...</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu, another group of people just passed by in a hurry. It's possible that something has changed at Autumn Swan Market. Shouldn't we pick up the pace?"</p><p>Everyone watched as more than ten streaks of escaping light sped toward the direction of Autumn Swan Market at the end of their line of sight. Elder Mu 藤 seemed impatient and asked aloud.</p><p>It was no wonder that Elder Mu 藤 was anxious. This wasn't the first time they had been overtaken by people in the past two days, and it seemed that the protective formation at Autumn Swan Market had undergone new changes.</p><p>Yu Kong looked around and said, "Looks like everyone thinks along the same lines as Fellow Daoist Mu 藤, so let us set off."</p><p>Countless Cloud Beasts occupied the mountains.</p><p>Over time, this place had become a lair for Cloud Beasts, and there was no trace of Autumn Swan Market to be seen at all.</p><p>In the middle of where the Cloud Beasts gathered, there was a broken mountain.</p><p>The mountaintop had collapsed due to an external force, revealing a jagged, broken edge. In the center of the broken edge, there was a bottomless, round cave from which an array of colored lights constantly burst forth. Amid these lights, various strange phenomena such as hurricanes and flames intertwined.</p><p>The light was too much for the Cloud Beasts to endure and they dared not approach it, proved the power of the light.</p><p>The cave was the entrance to the lair, originally shielded by forbidden spell, but exposed after the destruction of Qiuhong market.</p><p>Jumping into the cave would lead into the defensive magical array, but the defensive magical array was currently in a strong phase.</p><p>When the low point arrived, the light would grow very dim and could hardly escape the cave; that was when the power of the defensive magical array was greatly weakened and the best time to enter the array.</p><p>By this time, many cultivators had gathered on the peaks at a distance from the broken mountain, most of them coming in pairs, and rarely did anyone come alone.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Yu Kong to occupy a low peak, with their sight falling on the cave.</p><p>He knew little about the defensive magical array and could not make anything out of it. His eyes moved until he found Ge Yuan and Yun Youzi. The three exchanged a glance before casually looking away as if they were complete strangers.</p><p>“No wonder these old ghosts are all here. In at most half a month, the low point will arrive!”</p><p>Yu Kong watched intently for a long time before coming to this conclusion. He then muttered, “It is time to move to clear out the Cloud Beasts.”</p><p>There were numerous Cloud Beasts here, but the number of cultivators gathered here was also increasing and each of them was not weak. It would only take some time to clear out the Cloud Beasts.</p><p>As expected, right after Yu Kong finished speaking, an old man in the advanced stage of Foundation Establishment rose into the air and said in a loud voice, “Fellow Daoists in the middle or advanced stage of Foundation Establishment, join me in taking down the Cloud Beast leader. The other fellow Daoists can team up to surround and kill the Cloud Beasts. The spoils of war belong to those who kill the Cloud Beasts. The real treasures are still in the lair, so do not harm the harmony for the sake of petty gain.”</p><p>This old man was quite prestigious. He was immediately responded to after speaking.</p><p>Yu Kong did not dare go against the old man’s command. He turned his head and gently reminded, “Do not get separated. Watch each other's back and stay alert. There are too many Cloud Beasts. Once the battle begins, the situation will turn chaotic, and someone may get ambushed.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had rehearsed this before and immediately assumed their formation, led by the most powerful Elder Mu Teng. Sisters Xiu worked well together to guard the rear, giving no chance for anyone with evil intentions to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded and felt relieved. He was about to move when he suddenly heard someone sneering from the left.</p><p>“Old Ghost Yu, you are really that afraid to die. You’ve gathered so many people – have you chosen which of them will be your scapegoats?”</p><p>A ray of遁光 stopped in front of everyone. It was Sheng Yuanzi!</p><p>Chapter 283: Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace</p><p>The ancient cultivator's cave, where the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace is located, is divided into two layers.</p><p>Because of the marketplace's fame, later generations habitually referred to the entire cave by the marketplace's name.</p><p>The outer layer is outside the protective formation, which is the actual Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace.</p><p>Due to the weakening of the restrictive spells over time, and for various other reasons, this outer layer was discovered first and developed into a marketplace by the cave's owner as a cover.</p><p>Later, the marketplace was destroyed by Cloud Beasts, and the area was reduced to ruins. The remaining restrictions were also completely destroyed by the Cloud Beasts, making restoration impossible. Thus, it was abandoned, exposed to the elements, and became a Cloud Beast nest.</p><p>Therefore, every time the protective formation weakened, and people gathered at the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace, they first had to join forces to clear out the Cloud Beasts inhabiting the area.</p><p>There isn't much to say about the protective formation itself. It contains the elements of earth, wind, water, and fire, incorporating the cycle of yin and yang. Each time one enters, the formations encountered are different.</p><p>Yu Kong only briefly described his previous encounter; it was unlikely they would encounter the same formations this time.</p><p>What Yu Kong focused on, and what everyone was most concerned about, were several treasure locations within the cave.</p><p>The original form of the cave was a towering mountain. Although vast, it had been thoroughly explored. Five locations were generally recognized as key areas containing treasures.</p><p>The first to be discovered, and the most valued by the cave's owner, was a place known as the Offering Hall.</p><p>There was no plaque on the Offering Hall. However, it was built on the summit, the highest point of the entire cave. Inside, a clay statue was enshrined, demonstrating the cave owner's reverence for it.</p><p>It was suspected that the clay statue might represent the cave owner's ancestor, leading some to call it the Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Due to its unique location, significance, and prominence, the Offering Hall was the primary target for intruders from the beginning.  Its restrictions were broken early on, and the treasures stored inside, all of high quality, were plundered.</p><p>Many continued to search the Offering Hall afterward, even lifting the clay statue, only to confirm it had been completely emptied.</p><p>Now, only a few individuals remained, hoping to find something overlooked.</p><p>Next was a unique location second only to the Offering Hall, called the Legacy Jade Wall, embedded in the cliff face of the rear mountain.</p><p>By meditating before the Legacy Jade Wall, there was a chance to inherit the cave owner's legacy.</p><p>It was said that a Golden Core cultivator once attempted to remove the jade wall, striking the cliff with their palm.  The wall remained unscathed, while the cultivator was injured by the restrictions, and the attempt was abandoned.</p><p>However, no one had figured out the conditions for receiving the inheritance.  More likely than not, one would gain nothing, sitting in vain until the protective formation strengthened, forcing them to leave empty-handed.</p><p>Therefore, very few people now attempted to comprehend the Legacy Jade Wall.</p><p>Besides these, there were seven locations scattered throughout the mountain, similar to treasure vaults. These seven locations were the primary targets for those entering the cave.</p><p>Talismans,丹药, and jade slips could be found within these treasure vaults. However, the treasures and restrictions varied considerably among them.</p><p>Sometimes, the amount gained depended not only on strength but also on luck.</p><p>Yu Kong didn't hide his intentions; his target was a treasure vault located in the rear mountain.</p><p>Firstly, because this vault was the furthest, with strong restrictions, fewer people would compete for it. Secondly, he had been there before and, with his prior experience, was confident in obtaining more treasures this time.</p><p>…</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu, another group has just hurried past. Perhaps there's a change at the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace. Shouldn't we increase our pace?"</p><p>Everyone watched as over a dozen streaks of light sped towards the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace in the distance. Elder Mu Teng seemed impatient and voiced his inquiry.</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's urgency was understandable. They had been overtaken by several groups in the past two days. It appeared that the protective formation of the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace might be undergoing new changes.</p><p>Yu Kong glanced around and said, "It seems everyone shares Fellow Daoist Mu Teng's thoughts. Let's move."</p><p>Countless Cloud Beasts occupied the mountain.</p><p>With the passage of time, the area had become a Cloud Beast nest, and no trace of the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace remained.</p><p>In the center of the Cloud Beast horde was a broken mountain.</p><p>Its peak had collapsed due to some external force, revealing a jagged edge.  At the center of this edge was a bottomless, circular pit. Multicolored lights constantly erupted from the pit, interspersed with various phenomena like hurricanes and flames. </p><p>The Cloud Beasts were terrified of the light and dared not approach, a testament to its power.</p><p>The cavern served as the entrance to the hidden dwelling, originally concealed by a barrier that was destroyed during the Fall Market's devastation.</p><p>Leaping into the cavern would trigger the protective formation, which was currently at its peak strength.</p><p>During the waning period, the light would dim considerably, barely extending beyond the cavern. At that time, the formation's power would greatly diminish, making it the optimal time to enter.</p><p>By now, many cultivators had gathered on the distant peaks surrounding the Broken Mountains. Most traveled in groups; lone cultivators were rare.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Kong occupied a low peak, their gaze fixed on the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about the protective formation and couldn't discern much. His eyes scanned the area, finally locating Ge Yuan and Wandering Scholar. The three exchanged glances before subtly looking away, feigning unfamiliarity.</p><p>"No wonder these old foxes are all here. The waning period will arrive in half a month at most!" </p><p>Yu Kong, after observing for a long time, reached this conclusion and then murmured, "It's time to deal with the Cloud Beasts."</p><p>Although the Cloud Beasts were numerous, the cultivators gathering here were increasing, and each one possessed considerable strength. Eliminating the Cloud Beasts would only take some time.</p><p>As if on cue, an elderly cultivator in the late Foundation Establishment stage flew up and announced, "Fellow Daoists of mid-Foundation Establishment stage and above, join me in targeting the Cloud Beast leaders. The rest of you, work together to encircle and eliminate the other Cloud Beasts.  The spoils belong to whoever makes the kill. The true treasures lie within the dwelling. Let's not squabble over petty gains."</p><p>This elder held considerable prestige, and his words were met with immediate agreement.</p><p>Yu Kong dared not disobey the elder's command. He turned and softly reminded his companions, "Stay together, cover each other, and be vigilant. There are too many Cloud Beasts, and once the fight begins, it will be chaotic.  Ambushes are not unheard of."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had rehearsed this scenario. They quickly formed a defensive formation, led by the most powerful, Elder Mu Teng. The Xiu sisters, with their seamless coordination, took up the rear, leaving no opportunity for opportunistic attacks.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded, reassured.  Just as he was about to depart, a voice sneered from the left, "Old Fox Yu, you're truly a coward, gathering so many people. Have you chosen your scapegoats yet?"</p><p>A streak of light landed before them, revealing Sheng Yuanzi!</p>
