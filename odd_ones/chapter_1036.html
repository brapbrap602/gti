  <div class="chapter-c">
   A mechanical army had just arrived at a desolate planet outside the
          Star Zone through hyperdrive. A white desert with no end in sight
          covered the planet.
   <p class="calibre5">
    Psionic Prime led the others and slowly landed on the ground. There
            was a small black dot hovering one meter above ground. It was a
            Divine Mechanical Throne.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s original body sat right on it with his eyes closed,
            focused on controlling the Lord’s Avatar and the remote troops.
            Blue-gold lightning sparked around his body and disappeared when
            more than a meter away from him, entering into the Quantum Infinite
            Distance Transmission Channel to enhance his troops afar.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The army stepped onto the ground, and Han Xiao opened his eyes at
            the same time.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Welcome back.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Lord, we have not failed you.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Psionic Prime walked at the front. He stamped the spear onto the
            ground, took out the magical container that sealed the Psionic Prime
            Spear, and offered it up with both hands.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao looked over. Inside the translucent crystal ball was the
            Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy that was sealed, shrunk countless
            times. It was like red fog that kept changing its shape.
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Well done.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao grabbed the magic ball and toyed with it a bit. He then
            looked at the troops before him.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This army had battled Ravenlaude and his peak strength. Their
            victory did not come easy. Tons of normal troops had been destroyed.
            Almost every mechanical soldier had wounds on their body, and the
            exterior armor of many of them had cracked open, showing their
            insides that were flickering with electric sparks.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Among the ten or so Apostle Weapons, four were paralyzed by
            Ravenlaude and brought before Han Xiao by the others, lying on the
            ground and unable to move. Han Xiao had to repair them himself for
            them to recover.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Apostle Weapons had the ability to repair themselves, but there was
            a limit. Once the damage they suffered exceeded a certain extent, or
            their tinder energy lowered beyond the warning line, they would
            enter a paralyzed or hibernation state. These four Apostle Weapons
            were all melee combat soldiers. Although they did not die at
            Ravenlaude’s hands, they had taken tons of damage.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “You’ve done a good job.” Han Xiao nodded. He raised his palm. Four
            silvery-white nanoparticles flew out and fused into these four
            Apostle Weapons. Their bodies shivered, and their exterior damage
            started to slowly recover.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Leave them like this for the time being. I’ll have to give them a
            full repair inside the secondary dimension factory for them to fully
            recover.” Han Xiao then stared at Psionic Prime and smiled. “So,
            have you anything learned?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Psionic Prime nodded. “Our neurons and memory storage collected all
            the combat data. The database for fighting with Beyond Grade As has
            new examples and is more comprehensive. The next time we fight with
            Ravenlaude or another Beyond Grade A Mage, we’ll be able to design
            more targeted strategies to decrease damage incurred and increase
            efficiency.”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Apostle Weapons were all mechanical lives with growth potential.
            Their learning ability was very powerful. The fighting process with
            all kinds of strong opponents would become part of the Apostle
            Weapons’ combat experience that would make them stronger, or even
            acquire special combat techniques.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Very good. This is the first time you guys have defeated a Beyond
            Grade A at his fullest without the help of a Lord’s Avatar. I’m very
            satisfied with the results.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao gave them a few compliments. Then, he let the machinery set
            up space stabilization traps and shattered the magic ball with his
            hand.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Ravenlaude had only just sealed the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy
            when it was snatched away by Secret Master, so there was no time to
            set any magic arrays or whatnot. Brute force was all it took to
            break the container. Nonetheless, only Beyond Grade As would be able
            to break something like this so easily; Calamity Grades would not be
            able to.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Ka-cha!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The crystal magic ball exploded and turned to dust.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Boom!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The moment the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy came out from the
            ball, it instantly expanded and wanted to escape to the secondary
            dimension. However, the mechanical army had set up the trap, so it
            could not escape.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, Han Xiao raised his hand, opened his palm, and performed
            a pull gesture at the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Whoosh!
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    A powerful absorption force erupted from his hand. The Primal Chaos
            Mysterious Energy flew to Han Xiao and entered his body. The red
            energy cloud was soon completely absorbed.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Hiss!”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao inhaled deeply, and red light shot out from his eyes.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    According to the research the Universal Civilizations had on Primal
            Esper Ability Entities, only Espers and ordinary people could become
            owners. However, Han Xiao planned to test out how true this
            information was with his own body. After all, his first choice
            would, of course, be himself using it. He had to try to see if he
            was suitable.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He was not worried about failing. The damage caused by not being a
            compatible owner could kill Calamity Grades, but it would at the
            very most only cause a little bit of damage to Beyond Grade As.
            Plus, he humbly felt that his regeneration ability was not too bad,
            so he was not afraid at all.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Cells were the residence of Primal Esper Ability Entities. As soon
            as the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy entered his body, it
            automatically fused into each and every one of his cells. Intense
            agony exploded in Han Xiao’s body!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao could clearly feel that due to the difference in Energy
            Attributes, the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy and his own energy
            conflicted and produced a feeling that was similar to rejection. The
            more Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy his cells absorbed, the more
            intense the pain became.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, compared to the pain he went through during Promotions,
            this was child’s play. Han Xiao frowned slightly, opened the status
            bar in the interface, and looked at it.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">

   <p class="calibre5">
    “Huh, that’s a ton of debuffs.” Han Xiao’s mouth twitched.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    His original plan was that even if he turned out to be unsuitable,
            he could try to forcefully endure the load brought by the Primal
            Chaos Mysterious Energy with his regeneration ability, so he would
            be able to use the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. However, when he
            saw all these debuffs, he knew that this would not work.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Looks like I won’t be able to become the owner.”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao shook his head. The energy in his body vibrated and
            immediately pushed out the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, which
            made him feel refreshed instantly. All the debuffs from earlier
            disappeared.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Before the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy could do anything, Han
            Xiao took out a containing device for energy entities that had the
            appearance of a seventy-centimeter-long pipe. Its middle was yellow
            nano glass. Without saying a word, he contained the Primal Chaos
            Mysterious Energy once again.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Seeing the mini Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy inside bashing left
            and right but not able to pass through the specially-made energy
            restraining field, Han Xiao shook the pipe and made the Primal Chaos
            Mysterious Energy roll over a few times. He chuckled.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Although I can’t become the owner, with my technology, it won’t be
            hard to make use of the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. Mages can
            seal it in a special colossus and turn it into a fighting puppet, so
            I can build a special mechanical body to become the Primal Chaos
            Mysterious Energy’s host too. I shall artificially create a
            mechanical owner. However, it’ll take a lot of testing to find a way
            to build the host…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao thought about how to deal with the Primal Chaos Mysterious
            Energy.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, at that moment, a weak psychic wave escaped from within the
            container that was filled with a sense of resignation. A sexless
            voice suddenly appeared in Han Xiao’s mind.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Hi, Mr. Beyond Grade A, can we have a chat?”
   </p>
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Hmm? The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy is talking? Right, this guy
            is an independent life form that has a conscience.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao raised his brows, looked at the contained in his hand with
            interest, released his psychic barrier, and formed a psychic
            communication link with the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “You’re the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “This is just what you people call me. My real name is Mossenil Kad
            Piroye ‘Red Spirit’ Dito…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    After dozens of words, the name still had yet to finish. Han Xiao
            could not take it anymore and interrupted its self-introduction.
            “Stop, it’s too troublesome. I’ll just call you Ah K.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Ah… Ah K…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy’s tone was stiff. It probably had
            never heard such a nice nickname before.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Don’t mind the details. What did you want to talk to me about?” Han
            Xiao raised his brows.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “What do you plan to do with me?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao thought about it and told the truth. “I plan to build a
            host that can contain you, to make you fight for me. If that doesn’t
            work, maybe I’ll find a new owner for you.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “As expected.” The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, however, was not
            angry about it. “I’ve seen many Beyond Grade As. When I fused with
            you earlier, I found that you’re one of the few stronger ones even
            among Beyond Grade As. I’m powerless to resist, so I’ll let you do
            whatever to my body. Be gentle, ok? I don’t like it rough.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Why did the way you said that sound kind of weird?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao coughed and said with curiosity, “You’re going to become my
            puppet, so aren’t you angry?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “My life is longer than you can imagine. I’ve experienced everything
            there is to experience. It’s not like you’re the first one to want
            to control me. You’re just another passerby in my life.” The Primal
            Chaos Mysterious Energy’s tone was casual and carefree.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “… Didn’t expect you to be so open minded.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s mouth twitched, and he did not know how to describe this.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “If you’d lived as long as I, you’d know the feeling of loneliness.
            It’s the most horrifying feeling in the entire universe. Therefore,
            I hibernate most of the time. In fact, the experiences I have
            fighting alongside my owners are the more exciting and colorful
            memories.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy was very honest. As an ancient
            Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy that spent most of its time sleeping,
            he had no need to hide his real thoughts.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao suddenly thought of what had happened to Evans not long ago
            and asked, “So, you actually are eager to find an owner?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “During my hibernation, I let my sub-bodies find compatible
            candidates everywhere, and when the day comes that I’m interested in
            it, I’ll find an owner to start a new adventure.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s cheeks twitched.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    What’s going on with the world? Even Esper Abilities look for spare
            tires‽
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Ptooey! Bad Esper Ability!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, this explained what had happened to Evans—it was a story of
            a side chick becoming the main chick.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    There are way too many things wrong with this…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “You’re so cooperative now, so why did you try to escape just now?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “I like to be on the controlling side… but I can still enjoy being
            on the passive side,” the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy replied.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao rolled his eyes. So, basically, it’s because you have no
            choice but to cooperate because…
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    He initially thought that the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy would
            resist and fight to its death, but to his surprise, the truth was so
            refreshing and novel.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    However, it made sense when he thought about it. For an energy
            entity that had lived this long, few things probably mattered. It
            definitely resisted when it was caught the first time, but once one
            let that bottom line be crossed, one would start to fall into an
            endless abyss.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao somewhat understood why the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy
            was like this—it was ancient indeed, but without enough strength,
            how ancient it was did not matter.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As someone once said, ‘If you cannot fight it, enjoy it.’
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As time passed on, the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy slowly
            developed this personality of not caring about anything.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This time, the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy actively started a new
            conversation and asked, “It’s been so long since I awakened. What’s
            the situation in the universe now? What major events have happened
            in the past years? Who are you? Tell me, tell me.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Since you’re so cooperative, I’ll tell you…” Han Xiao shook his
            head. Through the psychic link, he quickly transmitted tons of data
            to the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy sensed the data joyfully. “Looks
            like while I was asleep, quite a number of big things have happened
            in the universe. I recall that when I fell asleep, the Beyond Grade
            As were not the ones existing now, and there were not this many of
            them.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “So, how long did you sleep for?” Han Xiao asked.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Hundreds of years? A thousand years? Sigh, why would I remember
            that? Time is meaningless to me.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy sighed and said in a fond,
            reminiscent tone, “Before the birth of Beyond Grade As, us Primal
            Esper Ability Entities still existed. Not to toot my own horn, but
            think about it. In the era when individual powers had yet to reach
            the Beyond Grade A realm, we represented peak strength. Countless
            people yearned for our power… Our era only ended when Beyond Grade
            As appeared.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Primal Esper Ability Entities were extremely ancient. They
            definitely had a glorious history in the distant past. They might
            even have been the ‘protagonists’ of some era.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This seemed to be a group of people with quite a lot of stories to
            tell.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao suddenly thought of something. “Then, do you know where the
            other Primal Esper Ability Entities are?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “So much time has passed. I lost track of where they went long ago…”
            This time, Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy paused. He then suddenly
            changed his tone, which became motivated and energetic. “However, I
            might know where one guy is. If you’re interested, I can help you
            capture him.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “… Why are you suddenly so excited?” Han Xiao responded doubtfully.
            Could it be that you like to beat up your teammates too?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Truthfully, that guy is my arch enemy. I’ve never liked him. We
            fought every day long ago, and countless owners died. If you’re
            interested, I’m very willing to help,” the Primal Chaos Mysterious
            Energy said with anticipation.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao was a little surprised to hear this.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Not only did he capture the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy, but he
            now got a surprise gift? Buy one get one free?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Damn, I didn’t even bring Feidin here!
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Could it be that when Secret Master pitied me earlier, he secretly
            increased my luck?

   <p class="calibre5">
    Hmm, or maybe this is a scam.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao caressed his chin and asked, “What’s its name?”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “Its name is Na… Oh, according to what you guys call it, it should
            be the Holy Light Particle.”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Holy Light Particle?
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    This was a familiar name too. In his previous life, it served the
            same host as the Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy. It was Evans’
            second Esper Ability.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    As a crucial character in the EsGod storyline, Evans had quite a
            number of protagonist type opportunities. The Primal Chaos
            Mysterious Energy wanted him to help it take back the part of its
            body that EsGod had taken away, so it helped Evans become stronger
            at all costs. It probably had told him about the Holy Light Particle
            like it did Han Xiao.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Evans, however, had a very unique body, which shockingly happened to
            be compatible with the Holy Light Particle too. The two Primal Esper
            Ability Entities somehow achieved an agreement, let go of their past
            beef, and decided to share their owner. At that time, Evans was the
            first ever owner of multiple Primal Esper Ability Entities in the
            history of the universe.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    Speaking of which, the man was quite talented. Even though he could
            no longer be an owner, recruiting him into the army would increase
            the army’s luck.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “No problem, no number of Primal Esper Ability Entities is too many.
            Where’s the Holy Light Particle?” Han Xiao was interested.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    “As far as I know, it stays in a secondary dimension over very long
            periods of time. It’s a world made of materialized light; everything
            is made of colorful light. Solid light looks like bright gems, and
            liquid light looks like thick and dense milk…”
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    The Primal Chaos Mysterious Energy described the dimension with as
            much detail as possible, clearly showing his strong hostility to his
            arch enemy.
   </p>
   <p class="calibre5">
    At the same time, a notification popped up on Han Xiao’s interface.
