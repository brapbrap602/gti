<h1>**Chapter 319 Earthfire Wutong Tree**</h1><p>**Chapter 319 Earthfire Wutong Tree**</p><p>He sat down heavily on the sand, sitting there in a daze for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang patted the dust off his body and stood up.</p><p>The melancholy in his eyes had already disappeared, replaced by calmness.</p><p>The young man in the tight-fitting suit was lying on the ground. Qin Sang stuffed a healing spirit pill into his mouth. His wounds had already healed. However, his sea of qi and meridians were still sealed by restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang woke him up and continued to use the Spirit Seizing Curse.</p><p>After learning that these two people were itinerant cultivators who had wandered into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and only had a slight friendship with Yu Daiyue, and no deep background, Qin Sang no longer had any misgivings.</p><p>The young man in the tight-fitting suit was not as tough as Yu Daiyue. He wept and begged for mercy.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him.</p><p>Amidst the young man in the tight-fitting suit’s terrified gaze, Qin Sang first sealed his primordial spirit according to the secret technique in the Heavenly Corpse Scripture, then applied numerous corpse refining restrictions, turning him into a living corpse embryo, and put him away in the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>He only had to wait until he obtained the Soul Guiding Grass to use this person to experiment with and refine his first living corpse.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out the scarred man’s corpse, spent a little time, and also refined him into a fierce corpse, put him away and let him slowly cultivate the corpse.</p><p>When he was done, Qin Sang discovered that after all these years, the Diffused Earth Qi and five elements yin objects he had brought with him were almost completely used up.</p><p>Refining living corpses, whether in terms of difficulty or what was required, was several times more than fierce corpses. He did not know if the remaining amount would be enough.</p><p>He could still buy the five elements yin objects in Hanging Skull Pass. However, the Diffused Earth Qi was extremely rare.</p><p>It seemed that it was time for him to return to his sect.</p><p>It had been many years since he had come out. He should also go back and take a look. He did not know how the Nine Fantasy Heavenly Orchid was doing.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts wandered as he opened the mustard seed pouches of Yu Daiyue and the other two.</p><p>To his surprise, the scarred man’s mustard seed pouch actually contained a segment of the Earthfire Wutong Tree’s main root. Moreover, it looked fresh, as if it had been dug up recently. It seemed that the trap was definitely carefully set by Yu Daiyue and the others.</p><p>Nine truths and one falsehood was the best lie, the trap that was most difficult to discover.</p><p>At that time, he had only been at the Qi Accumulation Stage Initial Stage. If he had not had good luck and happened to have agreed to the Cloud Wanderer, he would have been able to refuse Yu Daiyue’s invitation. If he went, he would really have been in danger.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly and picked up the gnarled and rugged long root.</p><p>There was only a main root and no Earthfire Wutong Tree’s spiritual liquid. He did not know if they had sold it or refined it themselves.</p><p>He used his spiritual energy to form a blade to remove the impurities on the main root, then extracted the purest spiritual wood essence and directly allowed the Ebony Sword to absorb it.</p><p>There were two killing seals inscribed on the Ebony Sword, which helped him break through to the Qi Accumulation Stage Middle Stage.</p><p>However, inscribing two killing seals had already almost reached the Ebony Sword’s limit. If he did not continue to improve it, it would not be able to withstand the pressure of a third killing seal.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had the Blood Drenched Mushroom, which could directly improve his cultivation after refining it, he would not be able to break through to the Qi Accumulation Stage Late Stage without improving the Ebony Sword’s strength and comprehending the killing seals.</p><p>The natal spiritual sword and killing seals were a bottleneck for Qin Sang. However, this kind of bottleneck could be seen and was tangible.</p><p>After refining the Earthfire Wutong Tree, Qin Sang sorted these spoils of war away and destroyed the mustard seed pouch.</p><p>What made Qin Sang sigh the most was Yu Daiyue’s mustard seed pouch. Inside, there were all kinds of jade slip secret manuals, all of which could help break through secret techniques.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s view, the vast majority of these were completely unfounded and extremely ridiculous.</p><p>For example, there was a secret technique that was the silver needle acupuncture method. It was clearly derived from mortal martial arts. However, Yu Daiyue had carefully collected it as if it were a treasure. He might have even tried it himself.</p><p>After healing his wounds and adjusting his breath, Qin Sang opened the sand cave and headed to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm.</p><p>When Teng Nan saw Qin Sang again, he also congratulated him. Afterwards, Qin Sang stayed in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm and trained nearby.</p><p>Ten months later, Qin Sang left the Cloud Beast’s Nest and returned to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm.</p><p>There were less than two months until the auction in Yin Mountain Pass. Qin Sang decided to first sort out his training methods in the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm, and then set off for Yin Mountain Pass in the near future.</p><p>The cave abode was quiet. Qin Sang entered meditation.</p><p>He had broken through to the Qi Accumulation Stage Middle Stage. The Nurturing Sword Chapter of the Primordial Spirit brought new changes. Qin Sang had already understood everything in this period of time.</p><p>The most obvious thing was the cultivation speed. With an extra killing seal, Qin Sang could not only comprehend the next killing seal a bit faster, his cultivation speed had also increased a level. According to his own estimation, it was definitely stronger than four spiritual root cultivators.</p><p>Even if he was slightly inferior to tri-spiritual root cultivators now, he would be able to surpass them once he completed the inscription of the third killing seal.</p><p>Based on his current cultivation speed and adding the Blood Drenched Mushroom, Qin Sang estimated that at most in another twenty years, he would be able to break through to the Qi Accumulation Stage Late Stage.</p><p>After his trip to Qiuhongfang City, Qin Sang failed to resolve the hidden flaw in his cultivation foundation. However, he obtained three thousand-year-old spiritual herbs, which was a very good harvest and definitely not in vain.</p><p>The saved time in cultivation practice gave him more opportunities to find a chance to establish his core and a way to repair his foundation.</p><p>This speed was considered middle-level among his fellow disciples in Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Of course, the premise was that he could upgrade the Ebony Wood Sword and wouldn't have other distractions in the meantime.</p><p>If Qin Sang's aptitude was better, his current cultivation speed would be even more amazing. No wonder Senior Qingzhu was able to establish his core in forty years.</p><p>It's a pity that his aptitude was what it was, and he couldn't envy others.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang left seclusion, bid farewell to Teng Nan, and flew toward Changyangfang City.</p><p>He decided to go to Yinshanguan along the border of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, so he entered the Taiyi Dan Pavilion branch in Changyangfang City and prepared to sell some sundries and buy some spiritual pills.</p><p>The elder in charge of the store was a Foundation Building Early-stage cultivator with the surname Liu.</p><p>Manager Liu recognized Qin Sang. When he saw him coming in, he hurriedly stood up and bowed. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I recently received news from Junior Fellow Daoist Youyouzi. He has now left seclusion and decided to cultivate in his original cave for a while. He heard that you once went to find him and sent me a message. If you have important business, you can go directly to his cave."</p><p>Qin Sang was indeed preparing to consult Youyouzi about his cultivation foundation and ask him to help him find some solutions.</p><p>So before going to the Tianjing Secret Realm, he asked Manager Liu to help him keep an eye out for Youyouzi. He didn't expect Youyouzi to have already left seclusion and take the initiative to send him a message.</p><p>"Senior Liu, I wonder if Senior Youyouzi has made any progress in his recent seclusion? Could he have broken through to the Foundation Building Mid-stage?"</p><p>Youyouzi was able to successfully establish his core at such an advanced age. His aptitude was definitely not as bad as his own. It was just that he had left a flaw during the breakthrough, which caused his cultivation progress to be slow after establishing his core.</p><p>If the Jiuhua Green Frost Grass was effective in resolving his hidden injuries, there shouldn't be a problem with him breaking through to the Foundation Building Mid-stage.</p><p>"I don't know about that."</p><p>Manager Liu shook his head gently and said with admiration, "However, Junior Fellow Daoist Youyouzi is often able to create miracles. As Fellow Daoist Qin said, he might really have advanced to the next level!"</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving Changyangfang City, Qin Sang pondered for a moment. Instead of returning to Xuanlangguan, he flew directly east.</p><p>Youyouzi was cultivating in seclusion at his cave. He would definitely not leave within one or two years. He might as well wait until the auction was over before going to find him.</p>
