<h1>Chapter 2174: Sea of Radiance</h1><p>Since Liao Chen was ready to depart, the three of them immediately left the cave and flew towards Heart Lake.  They were currently in the southern part of the Sacred Land, with Heart Lake to their north. Even with smooth sailing, it would take about twenty days to reach it. They chose Feng Huo Mountain as their meeting point because it was relatively close to their initial destination, the hidden realm.</p><p>The three flew side-by-side, with Qin Sang and Liuli shielding Liao Chen in the middle.  They also awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly for vigilance, planning to detour decisively upon sensing danger.</p><p>After flying for several days, Liao Chen silently calculated the time and worriedly said, “The spiritual mist in Heart Lake is about to dissipate.”</p><p>Heart Lake, similar to the Mist Sea, was shrouded in spiritual mist that dissipated only some time after the opening of the Sacred Land. Unlike the external mist, however, the spiritual mist contained numerous dangers that could threaten even Void Refinement cultivators. Countless experts from the Yi Ren tribe perished in Heart Lake.  Later, everyone learned their lesson and waited for the spiritual mist to dissipate before entering.</p><p>They were already too late.</p><p>“Slowing down might not be a bad thing,” Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Senior is right,” Liao Chen nodded, continuing to concentrate on his injuries.</p><p>Their journey continued without further incident.</p><p>However, their expressions weren't relaxed; their moods grew heavier instead.  Almost every day during their journey, they witnessed bursts of radiance, sometimes as many as three times a day, not counting the ruins left behind by the devastation.</p><p>Without any protective formations, the radiance ravaged everything, leaving countless massive scars on the Sacred Land.</p><p>This was definitely not a good sign!</p><p>They flew for several more days, getting closer to Heart Lake, and the frequency of the radiance increased, leaving the earth riddled with holes.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, seeing worry in each other's eyes.</p><p>Was the entire Sacred Land like this, or was the radiance more frequent the closer they got to Heart Lake?</p><p>If it was the latter, would Heart Lake be completely unrecognizable?</p><p>By this time, Liao Chen's injuries had improved somewhat. They accelerated their pace, traveling day and night, finally arriving at Heart Lake.</p><p>Standing on the shore of Heart Lake, the three were stunned by the sight before them.</p><p>Where was Heart Lake?</p><p>Before them lay a sea of radiance.  Boundless radiance rippled like water, forming an ocean of multicolored light!</p><p>Qin Sang took out his topographical map and glanced at it. Heart Lake was indeed ahead, but where was it?</p><p>All three were at a loss. They had anticipated various situations, but never that Heart Lake would vanish.</p><p>What should they do now? Was the hidden realm still there? Where would Liuli go to overcome her tribulation? How would Qin Sang absorb the essence of the immortal mountain to restore Mount Taiyu? And where was that innate spiritual treasure now?</p><p>Qin Sang looked far into the distance, using his Sky-Eye divine ability, but could only see endless radiance. Heart Lake had numerous islands; now, not a single island or drop of water was visible.</p><p>“What do we do?” Liao Chen asked, bewildered.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to ask the same question. Should they charge into this sea of radiance?</p><p>Perhaps the hidden realm within Heart Lake was still stubbornly resisting the radiance, but entering the sea of light would attract the gray figures. Qin Sang was not afraid, but Liao Chen and Liuli might not be able to withstand the gray figures for long.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Liuli could not possibly calmly overcome her tribulation. Moreover, the absorption of immortal mountain essence by Mount Taiyu was not something that could be accomplished overnight; it required a long process. Even if the immortal mountain essence hadn't been dispersed by the radiance, could he hold out until Mount Taiyu absorbed enough?</p><p>This upheaval could very well turn all their plans into a pipe dream.</p><p>“Wait here, I'll investigate the radiance,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Liuli replied, “Be careful, Qin Dao You.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded at them and dashed into the sea of radiance. Almost the instant he was enveloped by the radiance, he felt a violent gust of wind rushing towards him. The wind was extremely sharp, and the style was very familiar—it was a sword technique he had used against the gray figures before.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Metal clashed against metal. A sword shadow was repelled by the Gray Warbler Sword, only to turn in mid-air and attack again.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. The gray figure before him actually knew the technique he had used last time. This meant that the gray figures had not been annihilated; all the radiance was interconnected. Once he touched the radiance, the gray figures would reappear, and their power would only grow stronger.</p><p>Last time, Qin Sang had been very cautious, and he hadn't revealed his strongest trump cards. Liao Chen, however, had been injured by the gray figures using his own divine abilities!</p><p>Liao Chen, outside the radiance, saw this scene and realized the same thing, his face turning pale.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A gray figure retreated once more, unsuccessful. Qin Sang only parried with his Gray Warbler Sword.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's speed surged, and he dashed towards the heart of the radiant sea.</p><p>His speed was matched by the gray figure, which relentlessly pursued and attacked him.</p><p>As Qin Sang flew farther, his gaze constantly scanned the area, but he sensed no trace of any protective formations.</p><p>He knew that there were numerous hidden realms around the edge of Heart Lake, but now they had all vanished.</p><p>Just as he was about to give up, his eyes flickered, seeming to notice something.  He abruptly reversed course, leaving the radiant sea.</p><p>The gray figure pursued him. The Gray Warbler Sword and the sword light wielded by the gray figure clashed, followed by several consecutive strikes that obliterated the gray figure. After its death, no new gray figures emerged from the radiant light.</p><p>Liao Chen rushed forward, worry etched on his face.  He asked urgently, "Friend Qin, what have you found?"</p><p>"I saw a cultivator emerging from the depths of the light sea. He might know what happened. I'm going to ask him."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang transformed into a Siyou cultivator and flew alone along the edge of the light sea.</p><p>The timing was perfect.</p><p>The cultivator had just emerged from the light sea and dealt with the gray figure when he saw Qin Sang approaching.  His expression turned wary.</p><p>This person was tall and slender, with a long, white tail like a lynx's, and bare feet resembling tiger claws.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized him as a Liangqu cultivator. Though not one of the superior clans, the Liangqu were still powerful among the imperial clans.  The Liangqu and Siyou were both clans of the Heavenly Department; otherwise, the cultivator wouldn't just be showing hostility, he'd have attacked directly.</p><p>"Greetings, fellow cultivator.  What is your name?" Qin Sang bowed politely, according to the customs of the Yi people.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>The Liangqu cultivator questioned, his voice deep and commanding.</p><p>"I serve under the Imperial Lord. My Daoist name is Qingfeng," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"Qingfeng?" The Liangqu cultivator frowned. "I've never heard of you. You can call me Yin Xuan."</p><p>"I was previously unknown, having only recently joined the Imperial Lord's ranks. It's understandable that Daoist Yin hasn't heard of me," Qin Sang smiled. "I've just arrived and found Heart Lake completely transformed.  I've taken the liberty of stopping you, Daoist Yin, because I saw you emerge from the light sea and wanted to ask a few questions."</p><p>Yin Xuan's expression softened slightly. He nodded and said gruffly, "Ask away."</p><p>Being from the same Heavenly Department, they might cooperate later.  It wouldn't hurt to be courteous.</p><p>Qin Sang's most pressing questions were: why had Heart Lake become this radiant sea? Did Heart Lake still exist, or had it been completely destroyed by the radiant light?</p><p>Yin Xuan countered, "Where did you come from? Has the radiant light erupted elsewhere?"</p><p>"We came from the south…"</p><p>Qin Sang recounted his journey.</p><p>Yin Xuan said, "So it seems Heart Lake is the source of the radiant light, which has spread across the entire sacred land. When I first arrived, I landed near Heart Lake and waited for the spiritual mist to dissipate. Then I saw radiant light frequently emerging from the mist.  After the mist cleared, Heart Lake had sunk and vanished, leaving this scene."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  "So you mean Heart Lake wasn't destroyed by the radiant light, but sank as a whole?"</p><p>"Destroyed and sunken are the same thing. Who dares enter the bottom of the radiant sea to investigate? Several top experts tried to dive in, but all fled in panic and disarray, barely escaping. We can only wait and see if there will be a change," Yin Xuan shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, but suddenly thought of the secluded space where the Thunder Hall was located.</p><p>Ji Xia had been in a hidden realm, pierced by the radiant light, and plunged into that space.</p><p>Could Heart Lake have also sunk into that space?</p><p>He kept a calm expression and continued, "Forgive my boldness, but you entered the radiant sea to seek opportunities, right? Are there any surviving hidden realms or legacy estates?"</p><p>Yin Xuan sighed, "That was my intention, but without the skin, how can the fur remain?  Heart Lake is gone, so what hidden realms or legacy estates could there be? Even if there were some surviving, going in now would be suicidal!"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.  Was there something else happening in the radiant sea that he hadn't noticed?</p><p>"You'll find out soon enough," Yin Xuan cryptically replied, turning towards the radiant sea.</p><p>Qin Sang also looked, and after about a stick of incense, he saw the depths of the light sea churning. A wave rose, moved outwards, grew taller, and gradually transformed into a colossal tidal wave.</p><p>Before the wave reached them, Qin Sang felt its overwhelming power and his face changed.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The earth shook violently.</p><p>The tidal wave surged forward, destroying everything in its path. Qin Sang looked up at the wave's peak and felt like an insignificant ant.</p><p>Yin Xuan was right. Even if some hidden realms remained, anyone inside now would face a double whammy of giant waves and powerful formations. The chances of survival were slim.</p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Daoist Yin!"</p><p>Seeing the massive waves surging towards the edge of the Light Sea, accelerating without pause, their power reaching terrifying levels, Qin Sang hastily thanked him and turned back.</p><p>Yin Xuan grinned, then left.</p><p>Meanwhile, Liuli and Le Chen also noticed the waves from the depths of the Light Sea. Sensing the danger, they retreated.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang finally returned, urging them repeatedly. Seeing his urgency, the two didn't dare delay, fleeing with all their might.</p><p>Between the mountains, three figures sped outward side-by-side. Qin Sang helped them, preventing them from falling behind.</p><p>During their flight, Qin Sang noticed other figures streaking across the sky.  These were cultivators who had been hiding around Heart Lake, now also fleeing.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, they crossed countless mountains and valleys.  Suddenly, a deafening roar like thunder exploded behind them.</p><p>The three looked back, shocked. The giant wave had reached the edge of the Light Sea.  A radiant glow swept across the land, instantly swallowing a large area and spreading outwards at an alarming rate. The spectacle was terrifying.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The wave showed no sign of stopping, but thankfully they had reacted quickly; the radiant glow shouldn't catch them.</p><p>Just as they breathed a sigh of relief, a new catastrophe struck.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden warning in his heart, shouting "No!" He enveloped the two with his true energy, sharply altering their trajectory upwards, and they ascended rapidly.</p><p>Liuli and Le Chen allowed Qin Sang to carry them, looking down at the ground below.</p><p>A constant cracking sound echoed as enormous fissures appeared on the earth, shattering it.  Rocks flew through the air, and the radiant glow shot out from the chasms, piercing the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, narrowly avoiding the glow with the two. He glanced around, his expression darkening.</p><p>At that moment, the radiant glow was erupting intensely around the Light Sea.  Dozens of bursts were visible, with countless more seemingly brewing.</p><p>The glow expanded outwards. In the blink of an eye, several bursts connected, blocking their path. They could only navigate through the gaps.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>…</p><p>The catastrophe intensified.  The radiant glow filled the sky, transforming this world into a canvas, wildly splashed with light.</p><p>The three accelerated their escape, constantly changing direction, but still couldn't avoid the glow. A burst erupted right in front of them.  Trapped between two bursts, they had nowhere to go, watching helplessly as the light engulfed them.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed three gusts of wind appear beside them, and three grey figures charged towards them.</p><p>Liuli lightly flicked her fingers, a cloud of ice mist appearing around her. The edges of the mist solidified into nine ice shields, rotating continuously, their energies interconnected, forming an impenetrable defense against the grey figures’ attacks.</p><p>She had been warned by Qin Sang to defend, not attack. Unlike Le Chen, she had only been slightly grazed by the glow’s edge, not revealing much of her strength to the grey figures.</p><p>Le Chen’s situation was the most perilous.  Still recovering from his injuries, he faced a grey figure almost as strong as himself, under immense pressure.</p><p>Golden light shone, countless golden palm shadows appeared, emitting the sound of dragons and tigers roaring, nearly engulfing Le Chen.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A sword light slashed diagonally in front of Le Chen, instantly destroying half the palm shadows.</p><p>Le Chen breathed a sigh of relief, retreating to Qin Sang's side.  "That's the Mila Palm Technique. Qin Zhenren, attack its eighth shadow!"</p><p>Knowing his own technique best, the grey figure's Mila Palm Technique, learned from Le Chen, wouldn't exceed the master's understanding. And the weakness was also learnt.</p><p>As Le Chen said, Qin Sang attacked the eighth shadow with his sword. It worked!  A thunderous roar erupted as the grey figure's body trembled, and the palm shadows dissipated.</p><p>The moment was fleeting. Qin Sang used the Grey Warbler Sword to slash an arc of light. Two resounding bangs echoed as two grey figures were forced back.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang used his sword light to carry the two, speeding through the radiant glow. The three grey figures pursued relentlessly.</p>
