<h1>Chapter 1929: Azure Sand</h1><p>Qin Sang remained silent at first, taking another step forward.</p><p>This time, Ling E was prepared and immediately retaliated, his Daoist robe billowing abruptly.</p><p>Strange lines, dense as a swarm of locusts, surfaced on the robe's surface, twisting like snakes and insects crawling across his body.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>These serpentine creatures, radiating light of various colors, actually detached from the robe, transforming into streams of Qi that surged towards Ling E's head. In the void above him, they condensed into a bizarre, multicolored mass of energy.</p><p>*Whooooosh! Whooooosh! Whooooosh!*</p><p>The chaotic energy mass howled like a furious wind.</p><p>As it twisted and contorted, a humanoid outline gradually emerged, its limbs abnormally elongated and disproportionate.</p><p>The figure stretched out its limbs and lunged towards the poisonous miasma.</p><p>This scene resembled a soul leaving its body, except that this figure was multicolored and faceless.</p><p>*Plop!*</p><p>The figure plunged into the poisonous miasma, instantly merging with it.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang heard faint sounds of something tearing through the air, echoing all around him, omnipresent.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The poisonous miasma churned violently, suddenly giving birth to countless snake-like creatures.  Some were as large as pythons, others as small as maggots, all swarming towards Qin Sang from every direction.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have fallen into a sea of insects, the scene around him enough to make one's scalp crawl.</p><p>As these grotesque creatures were about to touch him, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.  His figure suddenly twisted with incredible speed.</p><p>*Plop! Plop! Plop!*</p><p>The serpent-like creatures lunged, but only grasped at afterimages.</p><p>Within the densely packed sea of insects, finding a gap seemed impossible, yet Qin Sang found one. In the blink of an eye, he had broken through the second layer of poisonous miasma.</p><p>When he stopped, his body remained pristine, without a trace of the insect-like creatures.</p><p>At this moment, the sea of insects abruptly froze.</p><p>Not because Qin Sang had dispelled them, but because Ling E himself had given up.</p><p>Even with all his effort controlling the Eight Destructive Miasma Formation, he couldn't stop the other party's advance. Ling E understood that the other party's words weren't exaggerated.</p><p>Further resistance was pointless.</p><p>The Soulfall Abyss experts, including Tu Yuan, were already enough to give him a splitting headache. Ling E watched Tu Yuan break through the formation without fleeing immediately because he lacked absolute certainty of escaping. He had been waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>Now, with the arrival of another mysterious expert, Ling E knew that his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sea of insects retreated like a receding tide.</p><p>"You're not from the Soulfall Abyss!"  Ling E forced himself to remain calm, his voice deep.</p><p>Among the entire Soulfall Abyss, besides their ancestor who had already cultivated the Indestructible Bone, no one else could break his Eight Destructive Miasma Formation so easily.</p><p>If the Soulfall Abyss ancestor had come personally, the attack wouldn't have been so restrained.</p><p>This person either possessed profound knowledge of formations and restrictions, or had cultivation comparable to the Soulfall Abyss ancestor.</p><p>A Void Refinement expert? Impossible!</p><p>Ling E was startled by his own thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang finally spoke, "This Daoist has no connection to the Soulfall Abyss."</p><p>Ling E searched his memory for this Daoist, but found nothing. "If Daoist Priest isn't an accomplice of the Soulfall Abyss, then you've come for me?"</p><p>"Indeed. This Daoist wishes to invite fellow Daoist to assist me with a task. If you agree, this Daoist will help you overcome this tribulation and escape their clutches."  Although Qin Sang hadn't attacked, he was keenly aware of Tu Yuan and the others' movements.</p><p>When they discovered that what Tu Yuan had shattered was merely a manifestation, they immediately became alert.</p><p>Tu Yuan ordered a temporary halt to the assault on the formation and was currently searching everywhere for Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>Ling E hadn't anticipated such a turn of events.</p><p>He couldn't help but recall his earlier speculation, his eyes suddenly brightening. "Could it be that the Cloud Capital Heavenly Dao Sect wants to purge the Soulfall Abyss' corpse demons?"</p><p>Besides the Cloud Capital Heavenly Dao Sect, who else would dare to oppose the Soulfall Abyss?</p><p>Otherwise, why would this Daoist Priest Qing Feng risk incurring the wrath of the Soulfall Abyss to save him?</p><p>"Where did fellow Daoist's thoughts wander off to?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "This Daoist seeks you for my own matters. I have no intention of targeting the Soulfall Abyss, but I also do not fear them."</p><p>Ling E sensed a powerful confidence in Qin Sang's tone, but instead of feeling relieved, he felt uneasy. He sneered, "What do you want me to do for you? The Soulfall Abyss also constantly demands that I work for them. How do I know I'm not jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire?"</p><p>"I only require fellow Daoist to refine some potent poisons for me, as repayment for saving your life.  Once a sufficient quantity has been refined, fellow Daoist may leave as you please. Until then, this Daoist will not control you with things like Corpse Soul Pills. Refining potent poisons, delving into the Dao of Poisons, is also beneficial to your own cultivation. Why not do it?"</p><p>Qin Sang made no attempt to hide his intention to exploit the favor.</p><p>For some reason, hearing this, Ling E felt slightly more at ease. "Before fulfilling Daoist Priest's request, wouldn't I still be restricted?"</p><p>"Ask yourself this, fellow Daoist. If you pay no price, why would this Daoist risk offending the Soulfall Abyss to save you? While this Daoist does not fear the Soulfall Abyss, I also do not wish to invite trouble. Fellow Daoist will cultivate at this Daoist's cultivation grounds in the future.  As long as you remain within the vicinity of the grounds, this Daoist will not interfere… I'll give you five breaths to consider."</p><p>Qin Sang waited for three breaths before hearing Ling E's response. "What about Tu Yuan?"</p><p>"This Daoist can take you away before the Soulfall Abyss notices, or I can suppress these Soulfall Abyss cultivators and leave them to you to deal with."</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, the poisonous miasma parted, revealing a direct path to a mountain peak.</p><p>Atop the peak stood a man, gazing towards them.</p><p>The man's face was unusually pale, his recent exhaustion evident, yet he still possessed the demeanor of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Qin Sang smiled faintly, flashing to Ling E's side. "Fellow Daoist is indeed a decisive person."</p><p>"Choosing the lesser of two evils!" Ling E mocked himself, then his expression turned solemn as he bowed. "I choose the second option. Please assist me, Daoist Priest!"</p><p>As if fearing that Qin Sang wouldn't dare to oppose the Soulfall Abyss, he hastily added, "Refining potent poisons, relying solely on my own cultivation techniques and divine abilities is insufficient. Refining poisons is like refining medicine, it requires precious materials and the use of poison techniques to harmonize the medicinal properties. Otherwise, only mediocre results can be achieved. Daoist Priest's strength is unfathomable, so your requirements must be extremely high.</p><p>"My sect's inheritance includes a vein of Azure Sand. Azure Sand is one of the most compatible spiritual materials for our sect's inheritance. My master passed it down to my junior brother, but it was seized by the Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>"That mineral vein is unique. Deep underground, a special space has been opened. Cultivating our sect's techniques within it is greatly beneficial. It also holds considerable advantages for certain evil techniques of the Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>"This is the wondrous creation of heaven and earth, a natural geomantic treasure land. Once destroyed, recreating it is as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p>"Therefore, neither our sect nor the Soulfall Abyss has completely mined the Azure Sand. We only extract a portion when needed.</p><p>"With Azure Sand, I am confident in refining exceptionally rare poisons!"</p><p>Ling E spoke incessantly, but seeing Qin Sang watching him without saying a word, his gaze sharp as two swords, easily piercing through all his thoughts, he couldn't help but feel intimidated and subconsciously closed his mouth.</p><p>"Tu Yuan mentioned a rift between you and your junior brother.  There must be more to the story. But it doesn't matter. This Daoist doesn't care about your schemes, as long as you can fulfill my request!"</p><p>Qin Sang had overheard the previous conversation between Tu Yuan and Ling E.</p><p>He didn't care what Ling E was plotting, as long as Ling E worked diligently.</p><p>Ling E's expression remained unchanged, his tone becoming even more respectful. "Back then, the Soulfall Abyss ancestor personally laid down a grand formation to seal the Azure Sand mineral vein.  Not many in the entire Soulfall Abyss are qualified to cultivate within. Tu Yuan is one of them. With his cultivation and status, he definitely possesses a 'key' that allows him to freely enter and exit!"</p><p>A fierce glint flashed in Ling E's eyes.</p><p>He was precisely trying to incite Qin Sang to seize the 'key' and infiltrate the Azure Sand mineral vein to steal all the Azure Sand.</p><p>While this wouldn't shake the foundation of the Soulfall Abyss, it would allow him to vent his anger and reclaim what belonged to him.</p><p>Thinking of this, Ling E hurriedly added, "Moreover, Tu Yuan definitely has a soul tablet left in the Soulfall Abyss.  He cannot be killed yet. After emptying the Azure Sand mineral vein, then we can end his wretched life!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. "This Daoist has already said, I came for you. Those people are yours to deal with!"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang raised a hand and clenched it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth formed a small spiritual tide, madly converging and compressing into his palm, forming a sphere of light the size of a hilltop.</p><p>"Truly a Void Refinement Grandmaster!"</p><p>Ling E's pupils constricted.  All doubts vanished from his heart as he focused on controlling the Eight Destructive Miasma Formation in cooperation.</p><p>Outside the formation:</p><p>Tu Yuan and the others quickly searched the surroundings, but found nothing.</p><p>That person had vanished into thin air, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Tu Yuan's brow furrowed deeply. Even his senior brothers couldn't manipulate things under his nose without him noticing, unless that Daoist priest had already escaped undetected before being brought here.</p><p>If the news had leaked, it would be a considerable problem.</p><p>Tu Yuan's eyes flashed with cold light as he summoned a subordinate skilled in tracking. "Spread out and search! If you encounter the Daoist priest, kill him without mercy!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a loud explosion erupted from within the poisonous miasma.</p><p>This sound, comparable to a clap of thunder, shook the minds of all the Soulfall Abyss cultivators, their gazes snapping towards the miasma.</p><p>The poisonous miasma suddenly churned violently, a massive wave of fog surging outward. Behind the giant wave, there seemed to be some terrifying fluctuation.</p><p>Tu Yuan sensed a life-or-death crisis and yelled, "Not good!"</p><p>Before he could issue any commands, the wave of fog had already rushed out of the formation, pressing down on them.</p><p>The Soulfall Abyss cultivators had formed a formation to prevent Ling E from escaping, but facing this wave of fog, they were utterly defenseless.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The corpse formation was instantly shattered by the wave of fog, many cultivators sent flying, crashing heavily onto the ground.</p><p>The Soulfall Abyss cultivators, mostly corpse cultivators, possessed powerful physical bodies, yet their protective corpse Qi was broken, allowing the poisonous miasma to invade.</p><p>The Eight Destructive Miasma Formation was meticulously arranged by Ling E, infused with countless poisonous substances over the years. Once the miasma entered their bodies, those with weaker cultivation perished instantly.</p><p>Even Tu Yuan couldn't withstand the impact. Caught off guard, he tumbled into the valley.</p><p>A screech like a night owl echoed from within the valley.</p><p>Tu Yuan didn't let rage cloud his judgment. Realizing that something unusual must have happened, he slammed into the ground, a ghostly light flashing on his body as he attempted to burrow underground.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ground was hard as iron.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Tu Yuan was flung back up, his expression changing drastically. He tried to escape the valley, but it felt as if the sky was collapsing on him. Then, a figure flashed before him.</p><p>Ling E glared at this enemy who had almost driven him to despair, his teeth gritted with a hint of satisfaction.</p><p>"Old Ghost Tu Yuan, did you ever think this day would come?!"</p><p>…</p><p>"Daoist Priest, it's here."</p><p>After rescuing Ling E, the two immediately rushed towards the Azure Sand mineral vein.</p><p>The vein was located southwest of Ling E's cave, almost at the edge of the Twilight Mountains.</p><p>Beyond this point lay vast stretches of wasteland, the Soulfall Abyss situated within, the sole ruler of the desolate landscape.</p><p>Even the most reckless fiend devils in the Twilight Mountains wouldn't dare trespass into the wasteland lightly.</p><p>Ling E, holding the restrained Tu Yuan in one hand, pointed towards a mountain range ahead with the other.</p><p>Amidst the towering peaks and dense forests, this mountain range appeared ordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang, his eyes imbued with divine light, saw a formation concealing the mountain's spiritual energy. This formation was undoubtedly the work of a master. If he were to break it, it would take considerable effort and would certainly alert the formation's creator.</p><p>After carefully sensing for a moment, Qin Sang nodded to Ling E.</p><p>Ling E immediately took a blood-red jade token from Tu Yuan's waist, flew forward, and using Tu Yuan's aura as a guide, cast several incantations, embedding the jade token into the formation.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Blood-red light suddenly appeared on the mountaintop, as if a blood-red hole had been carved out of the void.</p><p>Ling E flashed to a position above the blood-red hole.</p><p>"Greetings, Lord Tu Yuan," two Soulfall Abyss cultivators flew out, about to bow in respect, when they suddenly sensed something amiss.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>Their reaction wasn't slow. They immediately tried to close the formation and send a message for help, but Qin Sang and Ling E were too swift.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The two were smashed into the mountain, alerting everyone within.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ling E appeared on the mountaintop one after another.</p><p>"There are no Nascent Soul cultivators here," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Before this, I'd heard some vague rumors of fiend devils disappearing without a trace.  But the Twilight Mountains are chaotic; disappearances are commonplace, no one pays attention. Now it seems there might be the Soulfall Abyss behind it. I wonder what that old ghoul is planning." Ling E said gravely. "I'll eliminate these corpse demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He hadn't detected anything unusual in Cloud Capital Mountain before. He wondered if the Cloud Capital Heavenly Dao Sect had noticed anything.</p><p>Whatever the Soulfall Abyss was doing, it was likely directed at the Cloud Capital Heavenly Dao Sect, having nothing to do with him.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on a nearby rock, spreading his divine sense, penetrating the mountain, reaching directly into its depths.</p><p>"Truly remarkable!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled.</p><p>Within his perception, there truly was a mineral vein with an exceptionally unique aura within the mountain's belly.</p><p>It could be confirmed as the Azure Sand mineral vein, but after forming the complete vein, it was significantly different from a single piece of Azure Sand.</p><p>The vein's path resembled an Azure Dragon, sealed within the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated for a moment, deciding not to split the entire mountain apart to extract the entire Azure Sand vein, as doing so would reveal his identity as a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Gradually separating the vein with his True Essence penetrating the mountain wouldn't be much slower.</p><p>Gradually, that unique aura completely vanished, a fine geomantic treasure land thus destroyed.</p><p>Ling E secretly lamented the loss, but upon seeing the extracted granules of Azure Sand, he immediately cast those thoughts aside.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The mountain's interior rumbled continuously.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Granules of azure sand detached from the vein, shooting towards the sky, then collected by Ling E.</p><p>After extracting all the Azure Sand, Qin Sang erased the traces, creating some camouflage, and immediately left the area with Ling E.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
