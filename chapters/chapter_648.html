<h1>Chapter 640: The Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit</h1><p>“Such a large poisonous spring is quite rare.  Unfortunately, its toxicity is too weak, requiring an extra purification step. It's not as good as the smaller springs controlled by the Imperial Spirit Sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood by the lake, her spiritual sense spreading out, surveying her surroundings.</p><p>Though it was a poisonous spring, the water was no different from any other, remarkably clear.</p><p>The formation of poisonous springs is complex, many arising from sudden cataclysmic changes in the spiritual energy of the land, accumulating toxins.  Even after the spiritual energy returns to normal, the poisonous spring remains.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the earth and crevices with her spiritual sense, searching inch by inch.</p><p>“Senior, have you found anything?”</p><p>At this moment, Cui Xuanzi arrived, panting heavily.  Before Cui Xuanzi could speak, Qin Sang's figure flickered, and she vanished into the deepest part of the mine, thoroughly searching the cave.</p><p>At the mouth of Black Wind Valley, a sword light pierced through the gloomy wind, circled in the air, then sped towards the heart of the Western Frontier, disappearing in an instant.</p><p>A moment later, Cui Xuanzi returned to the valley entrance.</p><p>He bowed respectfully in the direction Qin Sang had gone.</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, Cui Xuanzi finally straightened up, withdrew his gaze, glanced into Black Wind Valley, a hesitant expression on his face.  Finally, he shook his head slightly and shouted inwards, “Seal the entrance! No one is allowed to enter or exit except for me.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Spiritual energy surged within Black Wind Valley, sealing the entrance.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi departed on a wind current, returning to the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>As soon as he entered, he saw his junior brother, Tong, emerge from the shadows.  Seeing Cui Xuanzi alone, Tong approached anxiously, about to speak, but Cui Xuanzi glared at him sharply.</p><p>Tong immediately understood and remained silent.</p><p>The two of them silently flew back to the sect leader's hall, drank tea and chatted for a while, then activated a mechanism to enter a secret chamber.</p><p>After activating the chamber's restrictions, both breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Tong could barely contain himself.  “Senior Brother Sect Leader, he didn't discover the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit in the poisonous spring, did he?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi closed his eyes in thought, shaking his head.  “No. The Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit isn't ripe yet.  The spiritual fruit's power won't leak out from the ancient restriction until then, and the spring wouldn't show any unusual activity. Since Black Wind Valley was discovered, countless cultivators have come and gone, yet none discovered that ancient restriction. No matter how high his cultivation is, he couldn't easily detect it. If it weren't for our uncle's good fortune, happening to enter Black Wind Valley to refine the poisonous spring when the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit was ripe, our Five Insects Sect would have missed out on this spiritual fruit.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Tong nodded repeatedly.  “The Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit can actually help poisonous insect-type spiritual insects undergo a third metamorphosis!  It was always considered a legend, but now we know it's true.  Our uncle was incredibly lucky, encountering such a great opportunity. His spiritual insect underwent a metamorphosis, and he then successfully formed his Golden Core. And there were actually three Thousand-Handed Spider Fruits on the tree!  Unfortunately, they didn't ripen at the same time. Nearly a hundred years have passed since the first one ripened, and only now is the second showing signs of ripening…”</p><p>Tong rambled on, receiving no response.  Seeing Cui Xuanzi lost in thought, he curiously asked, “Sect Leader Senior Brother, what are you thinking about?”</p><p>“I'm recalling if there were any oversights in my words and actions recently, especially when facing that old ghost Qin.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi said in a low voice, “This person is definitely not just some hermit cultivator who stays in his cave.  Even a single flaw could lead to his discovery.”</p><p>Tong felt the same way, sighing.  “This time was truly full of twists and turns. My heart was all over the place. Thankfully, we managed to protect Black Wind Valley and the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit. Otherwise, with the spiritual fruit about to ripen, if Black Wind Valley fell into other hands, the fruit would be lost. Fortunately, Senior Brother bravely risked it all to befriend that old ghost Qin… When that old ghost Qin was there, the Thunderclap Fort and Hundred Flowers Palace attacked together. Such a coincidence! Could it have been orchestrated by Senior Brother?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi snorted.  “If it were me, the regional hegemon of Bear Mountain would have been someone else by now! Tong, don't treat Golden Core cultivators like fools, always trying to scheme against them. I merely sensed an impending storm and knew Thunderclap Old Man's nature, so I used the situation to my advantage. He believes most in the Witch God, seeking the Witch God's protection in everything. Choosing the Witch God Festival for such a big event is very likely. Even if he hadn't come this time, I would have found a way to shelter under that old ghost Qin. As long as I'm a loyal and useful dog, would he dare discard me?”</p><p>Tong looked pained. “Sect Leader Senior Brother, you've suffered too much.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shook his head. "We've been working so hard to buy ourselves a few more years, until the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit ripens. What's the big deal?"</p><p>Tong, his junior brother, said resentfully, "The fruit is almost ripe. Once senior brother consumes the essence, our sect will have a third-generation spirit insect, and we won't have to bow to anyone anymore!"</p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi stopped Tong. "Let's not forget that the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit only increases the chances, it doesn't guarantee a successful transformation. Even if we succeed, and I successfully form the Golden Core, we mustn't disrespect Old Qin. If I were to curry favor with him as a Golden Core cultivator, I'm sure he wouldn't refuse."</p><p>Tong's face was full of resentment. "Once senior brother forms the Golden Core, we can rule the roost. Why should we remain subservient...?"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Tong's expression changed. "Senior brother, after you form the Golden Core, are you also going to leave the Five Insects Sect?"</p><p>"What are you thinking? The Five Insects Sect is stuck in the Western Frontier; what kind of future is there? This person's background is extraordinary, and there must be a powerful force behind him.  He might be our chance to leave the Western Frontier.  A little humility won't hurt us."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi glared at him, then frowned, suddenly remembering something. "Are you still resentful towards our uncle?"</p><p>Tong remained silent.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi sighed. "Back then, our uncle and the sect weren't on good terms. He was an orphan brought back by our grandmaster, but his becoming an orphan was also related to our grandmaster...These are secrets I haven't told you."</p><p>Tong was shocked.</p><p>"...Before our uncle left, he left the Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit tree to the sect and subdued all opposing forces, ensuring the Five Insects Sect's prosperity for a hundred years. He did everything he could. We are the ones who are incompetent and have let down our ancestors."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi looked ashamed.</p><p>"Forget it!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi waved his hand. "The past is the past. As long as I can form the Golden Core, these are minor issues. Listen to your senior brother, don't have any more unnecessary thoughts.  The woman Old Qin left behind, take good care of her and cultivate her at any cost."</p><p>"Her?"</p><p>Tong hesitated. "Senior brother, what do you think is the relationship between the Mute Girl and Old Qin?  Arranging her in the sect's best cave for cultivation has already caused some discontent among the disciples..."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi also frowned.</p><p>He initially thought that the Mute Girl was favored by Old Qin because of her exceptional talent.  Later, he discovered she was a four-spirit-root cultivator.</p><p>Since joining the sect, the Mute Girl had only focused on cultivation and did not interact with anyone.  Even her 'cheap master' couldn't get a word out of her.</p><p>One might mistake her for a mute.</p>
