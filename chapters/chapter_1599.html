<h1></h1><p>Jia Domain.</p><p>Having shaken off his pursuers, Qin Sang returned to his rented cave dwelling. Opening the jade casket for a closer look, he was astonished to find the downy feather had darkened slightly and its shape had also changed.  It seemed alive, writhing constantly, though the movement was subtle, perceptible only after some time.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, choosing not to open the seal rashly. Instead, he channeled his divine sense, probing into the jade casket to subtly investigate.  He sensed a trace of danger from the feather, confirming it was no ordinary object.</p><p>“Just how much of a threat can this thing pose to the Scarred Man?”</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated. He didn't doubt the power of the Myriad Poison Mountain's supreme treasure, but so much time had passed, and there were too many variables. The Scarred Man might very well have found a way to suppress the residual poison.</p><p>Besides, the most dangerous aspect of the Scarred Man was the Jade Beetle.</p><p>Pinning all his hopes on a single item was unwise.</p><p>Putting the jade casket away, Qin Sang retrieved the Dream Severance Powder. He had finally gathered all the necessary pills for his Gu cultivation technique and could begin preparing for the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation.</p><p>Next, he needed to forcibly elevate the Crimson Desert Worm to the late stage of the Third Transformation. Using pills with significant drawbacks wouldn't be a problem, as it wouldn't affect the final outcome of the Gu refinement.</p><p>Then, he needed to continuously feed the Fire Jade Centipede with spirit herbs for a year.</p><p>Everything was ready; he only needed to proceed step by step.</p><p>Within his meditation chamber, Qin Sang divided the space into three areas, releasing the Fire Jade Centipede, Blazing Silkmoth, and Crimson Desert Worm. Light flashed in his palm as a pill bottle appeared. He poured out three pills and flicked them toward the three spirit insects.</p><p>Driven by the alluring fragrance of the pills, they swallowed them whole, excitedly scurrying within the confines of the restriction.</p><p>While they digested the pills, Qin Sang didn't need to constantly watch over them.  He sat in meditative posture, focusing on his own cultivation.</p><p>Black light flickered between his brows.</p><p>The Fire Lotus emerged, having bloomed a little more than before.  The layered petals were now visible, resembling a lotus on the verge of full bloom.</p><p>A demonic banner flew out from Qin Sang's sleeve.  Wisps of demonic fire stirred, slowly being refined by Qin Sang and then merged into the Fire Lotus.</p><p>As his understanding of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* deepened, this process should have been faster.</p><p>However, the current speed was considerably slower than twenty years ago.</p><p>The reason was not only his approaching bottleneck but also because he was nearing the purest core essence of the demonic fire.</p><p>At lower cultivation levels, before practicing the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, Qin Sang could only utilize the outward aura of the demonic fire when wielding the banner, similar to the Solar Divine Bird formed from the aura of the Southern Bright Ember Fire.</p><p>With his cultivation's advancement and his practice of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he could directly control the demonic fire in combat, but he hadn't touched the core essence sealed within the Profound Iron Pillar.</p><p>It was certain that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was a technique employed by Nascent Soul cultivators or even those of higher realms. After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang would definitely be able to refine all of the demonic fire he had gathered.</p><p>Currently, only a wisp of demonic fire essence remained within most of the eighteen demonic banners.</p><p>Due to his insufficient cultivation, when Qin Sang attempted to refine the demonic fire essence, the pressure increased dramatically, and progress became extremely slow, contributing to his bottleneck. If he could completely refine the demonic fire essence, it would signify his complete mastery of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, and his divine sense would undoubtedly experience a leap.</p><p>Achieving this was incredibly difficult!</p><p>Since arriving at Flying Cloud Crossing, Qin Sang had maintained contact with Jiang Mu, closely monitoring the movements of various parties and waiting for a high-profile Exchange Assembly and auction.</p><p>For the next year, Qin Sang followed his plan, feeding the three spirit insects.</p><p>In the eleventh month, the Crimson Desert Worm, as expected, advanced to the late stage of the Third Transformation.  Due to the potent nature of the pills it had consumed, the Crimson Desert Worm became the most volatile of the three spirit insects, barely able to maintain stability at this realm.</p><p>Trapped within the restriction, they remained close to each other, clearly visible to one another. They spent day and night together, longing to devour each other, yet separated by an invisible barrier.</p><p>The most docile was the Fire Jade Centipede, lazily coiled, hardly sparing a glance at its two companions.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A pill was shot into the restricted area.</p><p>Accustomed to being spoon-fed, the three spirit insects leaped up, swallowing the pills, their small eyes fixated on each other, filled with greed, wanting to steal each other's share.</p><p>“The time is almost ripe…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured. After a moment of thought, he collected the three spirit insects into his spirit beast pouch. He rose and exited his cave dwelling, boarding his beast carriage. He parked the carriage at a post station on the north bank of Flying Cloud Crossing and flew towards the wilderness.</p><p>Finding a relatively open valley, Qin Sang flicked his fingers repeatedly, sending out streaks of light that formed a spirit array in the open space. Upon activation, a semi-circular crimson light barrier appeared.</p><p>Next, he summoned the three spirit insects and placed them within the spirit array, still separated by restrictions.</p><p>His Thousand Treasures Ring shimmered, and over a dozen jade bottles flew out. With a series of ‘bangs,’ the bottles opened on their own, scattering spirit herbs across the void like celestial maidens scattering flowers, their various fragrances mingling.</p><p>There were pills, powders, and even spirit liquids.</p><p>These were all essential ingredients recorded in the *Gu Classic*.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed with his finger, categorizing the spirit herbs and adding them to the spirit array one by one according to the prescribed steps. He didn't know much about alchemy, but this felt similar to refining pills, with the spirit array serving as the cauldron, ultimately refining a single spirit insect.</p><p>The spirit herbs mingled within the spirit array, forming a visible stream of medicinal power that spiraled above the array, forming a ring.</p><p>Smelling the fragrance, the three spirit insects grew agitated, but they were firmly pressed to the ground by the restrictions, emitting sharp screeches.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the bottle of medium-grade Dream Severance Powder and flicked it toward the Fire Jade Centipede. After consuming it, the centipede's mind regained some clarity.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly released the restrictions.</p><p>The Blazing Silkmoth and the Crimson Desert Worm immediately transformed into crimson streaks of light, plunging into the stream of medicinal power. The Fire Jade Centipede, still somewhat dazed, swayed its head. Seeing the other two spirit insects devouring the spirit herbs, it panicked and dove in as well.</p><p>Initially, with ample spirit herbs, the three insects devoured them greedily, too preoccupied to fight. But soon they began to compete.</p><p>The spirit herbs amplified their ferocity.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, having consumed the Dream Severance Powder, fared slightly better. The Blazing Silkmoth and the Crimson Desert Worm had become utterly frenzied. Upon encountering each other, they attacked without hesitation.</p><p>Before long, the Fire Jade Centipede was forced to join the battle.</p><p>The three spirit insects clashed.</p><p>The Blazing Silkmoth spewed lava.</p><p>The Crimson Desert Worm's entire body emanated a crimson aura, transforming into a fire spirit, realistic enough to be mistaken for the real thing.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede wasn't adept at combat, but its natural talent granted it high resistance to such attacks. Furthermore, it possessed the highest cultivation and retained a sliver of intelligence, its instinct for self-preservation still intact, resulting in the lightest injuries.</p><p>As time passed, the battle within the spirit array intensified, broken carapaces and severed limbs flying everywhere.  The sickening sound of chewing could be heard from time to time.  The Fire Jade Centipede's sliver of clarity was gradually worn away.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang administered another dose of Dream Severance Powder.</p><p>Finally, the Crimson Desert Worm succumbed first, seized by the Fire Jade Centipede and the Blazing Silkmoth. Its plump body was torn in two.</p><p>“Crunch! Crunch!”</p><p>Chewing on their enemy’s remains, the Blazing Silkmoth and the Fire Jade Centipede grew even fiercer, glaring at each other before simultaneously lunging forward.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked in the final batch of pills. The two spirit insects fought while absorbing the pills, the battle escalating in brutality.</p><p>In the end, the Fire Jade Centipede, using its mostly severed appendages, tightly constricted the Blazing Silkmoth, enduring the torrent of lava, biting through the silkmoth's abdomen and burrowing inside.</p><p>The Blazing Silkmoth thrashed violently, emitting a shrill cry. The more it struggled, the greater its pain. Suddenly, its body stiffened, its life force rapidly fading.</p><p>‘Splat!’</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede chewed its way out of the Blazing Silkmoth, devouring the remaining corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang held the last bottle of Dream Severance Powder, his expression grave, his gaze fixed on the Fire Jade Centipede.  It started by ravenously swallowing, then gradually transitioned to small, savoring bites.</p><p>Simultaneously, the color of the Fire Jade Centipede’s carapace began to change, emitting a faint golden glow.</p><p>Having consumed the entire corpse, the Fire Jade Centipede, still unsatisfied, scoured the ground for remaining fragments, wasting nothing.  Finally, it lay on the ground, its body contorted.</p><p>The golden glow intensified.</p><p>Starting from the carapace, the Fire Jade Centipede's entire body turned a reddish-gold.</p><p>During this transformation, the Fire Jade Centipede’s aura steadily climbed, accelerating rapidly.  Flames flickered around its body as it began to spin a cocoon.</p><p>“It’s finally done!”</p><p>A look of joy appeared on Qin Sang’s face.  Without hesitation, he administered the final dose of Dream Severance Powder. The Fire Jade Centipede’s aura gradually stabilized as it slumbered within the fiery cocoon.</p><p>It was unknown what laws governed the transformation of spirit insects.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede’s slumber was surprisingly short.  In less than six months, Qin Sang sensed movement within the fiery cocoon. He returned to the same location and set up the formation.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The fiery cocoon split open, and the Fire Jade Centipede crawled out. Sensing the Heavenly Tribulation, it raised its head, emitting a series of screeches, then lowered its head to devour the cocoon.</p><p>Its body was a brilliant reddish-gold, gleaming with a metallic sheen.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Tribulation clouds manifested, dark clouds gathering, lightning flashing, and thunder roaring.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately changed his hand seals, and the surface of the spirit array manifested a series of Profound Mirrors. This formation incorporated the Profound Mirror Formation, assisting the Fire Jade Centipede in overcoming the tribulation.</p><p>The tribulation clouds converged, lightning coursing within.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s expression shifted, and he flashed out of the valley.</p><p>The Central Plains was densely populated, especially the Six States of Jiang Zuo.</p><p>Although the location Qin Sang chose for the Fire Jade Centipede’s tribulation was in the wilderness, there were still several sects nearby, including some with Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>The appearance of the Heavenly Tribulation was a grand spectacle.</p><p>A Nascent Soul Patriarch, startled awake from his meditation, flew into the air, glanced towards the horizon, and shot off. Exhaling a cloud of white qi, his figure merged with it and vanished.</p><p>Soon, spotting the tribulation clouds from afar, the Nascent Soul Patriarch paused slightly, a look of surprise on his face. "Hmm? This tribulation cloud is rather peculiar... Could it be..."</p><p>Recalling something he had read in an ancient text, the Nascent Soul Patriarch's eyes lit up with excitement.  He suddenly noticed another streak of light approaching from the north and let out a cold snort, accelerating forward.</p><p>However, before he could approach the tribulation clouds, the Nascent Soul Patriarch heard two strange grunts, ‘Heng! Ha!’  A sharp pain pierced his nascent soul, and his figure staggered. He was shocked to discover that his old rival had also been affected.  Their escapes halted abruptly, their auras fluctuating wildly.</p><p>“One step further, and you die!”</p><p>A bellow resonated clearly amidst the rumbling thunder.</p><p>Simultaneously, a streak of silvery-white lightning tore through the sky, striking directly into the valley, momentarily illuminating half the sky, revealing a faint human figure.</p><p>The two Nascent Soul cultivators stopped in their tracks,不敢越雷池半步 not daring to cross the thunderous boundary.</p><p>No wonder a Fourth Transformation spirit insect appeared here.</p><p>With the盂兰盆会 approaching, many old monsters who had been in seclusion for years were emerging. Recently, all sorts of rumors had been circulating around Flying Cloud Crossing. This person was likely one of them.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The mountains trembled, the valley bathed in silver light.</p><p>After a single tribulation lightning strike, the tribulation clouds dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze around, flashing down into the valley. He released the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to absorb the residual lightning threads, confirmed the Fire Jade Centipede's safety, collected the spirit insect, and vanished.</p><p>Only after he had long departed did the two Nascent Soul cultivators dare to approach.</p><p>For a time afterward, others lingered in the vicinity, but they found nothing.</p><p>After a long detour, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling at Flying Cloud Crossing and released the Fire Jade Centipede for inspection.</p><p>Thanks to his thorough preparations, the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation hadn't left any serious lingering issues. The Dream Severance Powder had largely dispelled its ferocity, and its mind was relatively clear. It even recognized Qin Sang as its master, obediently coiling in his palm, dyeing it reddish-gold.</p><p>It still needed a period of recuperation to fully recover.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully touched the Fire Jade Centipede's mind, still sensing lingering ferocity, and patiently soothed it for a while, carefully examining its condition.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned, Qin Sang opened his eyes, deep in thought.</p><p>“This transformation undoubtedly enhanced its sensory abilities. And then there's the reddish-gold carapace, incredibly hard, and seemingly possessing other powers, capable of withstanding harsh environments and improving its survivability. The premise of treasure hunting is staying alive, which makes sense…”</p><p>Qin Sang valued the Fire Jade Centipede’s treasure-hunting ability most, having no expectations for its combat prowess. This outcome was satisfactory.</p><p>He suddenly recalled something.</p><p>He had previously assumed the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't grasped any divine abilities during its Third Transformation, perhaps because its increased resistance to fire hadn't manifested any obvious changes.</p><p>What troubled Qin Sang was that after the Fire Jade Centipede’s advancement, the Fire Melting Pill no longer provided any benefits. He needed to find other spirit herbs.</p><p>He had a lead on the Fat Silkworm, but it required devouring high-rank Gu insects, and the cost of cultivating Gu insects was making Qin Sang wince.</p><p>“Three Fourth Transformation spirit insects are truly too much to bear…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, returning the Fire Jade Centipede to slumber and retrieving an invitation with a flip of his hand.</p><p>Jiang Mu had personally delivered it a month ago, inviting him to an auction two months later.</p><p>The auction was to be held in a county city a thousand miles south of Flying Cloud Crossing, advertised as potentially featuring treasures that would drive Golden Core cultivators mad.</p><p>The fact that Jiang Mu had solemnly delivered the invitation to Qin Sang's residence spoke volumes. The top-tier Exchange Assembly he had been anticipating was finally about to begin!</p><p>Taking advantage of this time, Qin Sang first returned to Pu Mountain.</p><p>Stopping before his cave dwelling, his original body hesitated, then turned and left without entering.</p><p>While his original body was active in Flying Cloud Crossing, his avatar had been in secluded cultivation within the Clear Void Illusionary Realm, focusing solely on comprehending the *Ice Soul Divine Light*.</p><p>The ice disc provided a plentiful supply of cold煞 energy.</p><p>His avatar’s divine abilities had greatly improved. If it weren't for the need to simultaneously refine the cold煞 energy and modify the divine ability to suit himself, it would likely have already reached mastery!</p><p>Unfortunately, his avatar was currently at a critical juncture in its breakthrough and couldn't leave seclusion. His original body would have to attend the Exchange Assembly alone.</p><p>Returning to Flying Cloud Crossing, Qin Sang organized the items within his Thousand Treasures Ring, selecting those suitable for trade, along with various other miscellaneous items.</p><p>At a top-tier Exchange Assembly, bartering was the primary mode of transaction, with spirit stones holding little significance.</p><p>Gains and losses were entirely up to one's own judgment.</p><p>When the time came, Qin Sang departed Flying Cloud Crossing early, traveling south by boat, meandering along the waterways.  He disembarked at a county city named Tian Zhong, located on the west bank of Flying Cloud Crossing.</p><p>The Six States Hall's choice of Tian Zhong was intriguing. Tian Zhong was said to be located at the very center of the Six States of Jiang Zuo, the heart of the Five Great Sects.</p>
