<h1>Chapter 1570: The Snow Fox's Divine Abilities</h1><p>Countless Cold Spirits filled Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>He swept his gaze across them, spotting only a few scattered Cold Spirits with thin blue lines on their foreheads, the Cold Spirit leaders mentioned by Yanshan Laoren.</p><p>One resembled a small sika deer, its hooves delicately tapping the snowy surface as it pranced about, lively and spirited.</p><p>The blue line on its forehead was approximately three inches long, the longest among all the Cold Spirit leaders.</p><p>However, these leaders weren't clustered together; they were dispersed, indicating they were simply playing in the snow rather than being drawn by the Snow Fox.</p><p>“The Snow Fox is extremely sensitive to the aura of strangers. Once startled, it will hide, making it nearly impossible to find. We can only wait for the next time the snowfall weakens. Fellow Daoist, you must remain concealed. One more thing, before finding the Snow Fox, do not rashly use your divine sense.”</p><p>Yanshan Laoren offered a word of caution.</p><p>As he spoke, he reached for his waist, producing a water droplet.  Gently rubbing it between his fingers, the droplet spread out, transforming into a thin membrane that enveloped his entire body.</p><p>Covered by the water membrane, light passed directly through Yanshan Laoren’s form.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that Yanshan Laoren took such precautions even before pinpointing the Snow Fox's active area.  It underscored just how acute the Snow Fox's perception must be.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as Yanshan Laoren gradually blurred before his eyes, ultimately leaving behind only a faint shadow to facilitate communication.</p><p>Qin Sang readily followed suit.</p><p>Within the *Qingwei Records*, the cultivation manual for his External Body Incarnation, there was a technique called the Minor Qingwei Evasion Art, particularly well-suited to this icy environment.</p><p>Moreover, his External Body Incarnation was formed from spirit wood, lacking the aura of flesh and blood.  With deliberate concealment, deceiving the Snow Fox's perception shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang executed the Minor Qingwei Evasion Art, merging into the snowy night.</p><p>Within the heavy snow, two faintly discernible figures moved across the snowy plains.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren led the way. Clearly not his first time here, he methodically traversed several straight lines, quickly mapping out the distribution of Cold Spirits across the snowy expanse.</p><p>The two stopped at the other side of the snowfield.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren glanced around and said, “There are no gatherings of Cold Spirit leaders on the surface.  The Snow Fox isn't here. We must search the ravines beneath the snow layer.”</p><p>“Where's the best place to start?”</p><p>Qin Sang trusted that Yanshan Laoren already had a plan and asked directly.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren looked north, pointing, “Without using divine sense, a random search could take too long. If the snowfall intensifies, we'll miss this opportunity. The ravines are a chaotic maze, but I've discovered some patterns before… Let's descend from that location!”</p><p>They immediately set off, flying northward for more than ten li before landing on the snowy surface and silently merging into the snow.</p><p>Passing through the snow layer,</p><p>Qin Sang was instantly met by a biting, bone-chilling wind, laced with ice shards and snow particles.  Colliding with the icy walls, the wind formed perpetual whirlwinds.</p><p>It was colder here than on the surface.</p><p>The thick snow layer blocked all light.</p><p>Yet, below wasn't completely dark.  The Cold Spirits emitted a faint blue glow, barely noticeable on the surface but serving as the sole light source here.</p><p>The icy wind blew from the depths of the ravines.  The Cold Spirits, with their ethereal bodies, were tossed about by the wind, their expressions filled with delight.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren and Qin Sang flew downwards for some distance, one leading, one following. They stopped roughly midway down the ravine and began flying forward, searching along the ravine, one scanning above, the other below.</p><p>The number of Cold Spirits was even greater beneath the snow layer.</p><p>They also had to avoid the Cold Spirits to prevent causing a commotion and startling the Snow Fox.</p><p>Even following Yanshan Laoren's planned route, it was a monumental task.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang observed a wide variety of Cold Spirits.  Lost in thought, he even considered whether these Cold Spirits could be put to any use.</p><p>He recalled a secret art within the Xuan Tian Palace that could refine attendants similar to Cold Spirits.  With careful nurturing, they could even evolve into beings comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After searching for a while, Qin Sang captured a Cold Spirit leader.</p><p>The term "leader" didn't imply any actual authority over other Cold Spirits. It was simply Yanshan Laoren’s designation for them.  Cold Spirits rarely fought amongst themselves, their nature inherently peaceful.</p><p>Such creatures were exceedingly rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>Holding the Cold Spirit leader, Qin Sang began to study it. Yanshan Laoren noticed Qin Sang's actions but only glanced over, saying nothing.</p><p>“A simple creature, its body entirely composed of cold energy.  Somehow, it developed sentience, but its potential is limited. I wonder if the strongest leaders might exhibit any differences…”</p><p>Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>Releasing the Cold Spirit leader, Qin Sang considered capturing others when Yanshan Laoren’s voice suddenly rang out, “Look above!”</p><p>Qin Sang halted, looking upwards.</p><p>Ahead and slightly above them, three blue points of light, significantly brighter than others, flickered in the darkness.</p><p>Based on experience, only Cold Spirit leaders could emit such bright light.</p><p>This was the first time they'd encountered three Cold Spirit leaders traveling together.</p><p>“We found them so quickly?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. They'd only been beneath the snow layer for less than an hour.</p><p>“Let's take a look,” Yanshan Laoren whispered, pushing his concealment treasure to its limit as he silently approached.</p><p>Of course, within the Skyeye Butterfly’s vision, Yanshan Laoren’s movements were crystal clear.</p><p>Qin Sang also completely concealed himself, following behind Yanshan Laoren.</p><p>The three Cold Spirit leaders, one resembling a flying horse and the other two like birds, flitted about the wide canyon, sometimes drawing close, sometimes separating.</p><p>They bumped into each other, playfully swatting.</p><p>Cold Spirits, being formed of cold energy, were incorporeal. Such collisions didn't actually cause harm.</p><p>While it looked like playful interaction, Yanshan Laoren explained they were actually fighting.  They only behaved this way when competing for something. This was the most intense their conflicts could get.</p><p>They trailed the three Cold Spirit leaders, for the moment only seeing these three.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren urged Qin Sang to be patient and continue following them.</p><p>The three Cold Spirit leaders, oblivious to being followed, continued their chaotic battle as they sped through the ravines, without a clear direction, moving much faster than ordinary Cold Spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren patiently followed them, traversing dozens of ravines before finally spotting two new Cold Spirits.</p><p>Upon seeing each other, both sides let out sharp cries and joined the fray.</p><p>It was a truly comical free-for-all.</p><p>These Cold Spirits had no concept of alliances.  One moment they were cooperating to pummel another, the next they turned on each other, only to be beaten in turn.</p><p>Five Cold Spirit leaders engaged in such a chaotic battle was a rare sight.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren became even more certain that the Snow Fox was active nearby.</p><p>However, he dissuaded Qin Sang from searching on his own, suggesting it was safer to stick with the Cold Spirits, as they would eventually lead them to the Snow Fox.</p><p>So the two observed the inevitably inconclusive battle.</p><p>As time passed, more and more Cold Spirit leaders joined the fray.  Initially, they wandered aimlessly nearby, but later, as if guided by something, they surged towards a single direction.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren's spirits lifted, and they quickly followed.</p><p>The Cold Spirit leaders accelerated, chirping excitedly.  Those in front abandoned the fighting, flying headlong, while those behind seemed anxious, employing all means to hinder their rivals.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren deliberately slowed down, maintaining their distance.</p><p>Soon,</p><p>The ravine reached its end.</p><p>Turning a corner, the terrain suddenly opened up into an elliptical space.</p><p>This space connected to more than a dozen canyons.  Icy winds poured in from all directions, converging within the space. The strange winds whistled, drowning out the cries of the Cold Spirits.</p><p>When the five Cold Spirit leaders burst into the space, dozens were already present, all engaged in combat with their neighbors.</p><p>They paused momentarily before immediately joining the melee, seemingly without knowing who they were fighting.</p><p>Watching this bizarre scene, Qin Sang was speechless.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren, however, seemed accustomed to such a sight, transmitting to Qin Sang to pay attention to the center of the group of Cold Spirit leaders.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze, noticing that the wind, swirling with ice particles and snow flakes, had formed a white vortex at the center of the space.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren remained still, and Qin Sang could only wait patiently.</p><p>The chaotic battle continued for a while.</p><p>Then, without warning, all the Cold Spirit leaders ceased fighting, falling into an eerie silence.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a white stream of air erupted from within the vortex.</p><p>With the Skyeye Butterfly's divine ability, Qin Sang finally saw clearly.</p><p>At the heart of the vortex was a white fox, slowly rising, carried by the air current.</p><p>The fox was pure white, its fur fine and smooth, without a single blemish.  It was sleeping, limbs curled, fluffy tail wrapped around itself, its head resting on its tail, forming a ball.</p><p>It seemed to have been awakened by the commotion of the Cold Spirit leaders.</p><p>The fox's narrow eyes twitched slightly, slowly opening, revealing crystalline, clear pupils that reflected the figures of the surrounding Cold Spirit leaders.</p><p>Its tail twitched, and the fox gracefully rose, stretching languidly, shaking its body. Tiny hairs floated off.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly saw clearly that these hairs were actually fine ice threads, indicating the Snow Fox wasn’t a creature of flesh and blood.</p><p>Seeing the shed fur, the Cold Spirit leaders suddenly became agitated, scrambling to snatch them, revealing these were what they truly desired.</p><p>The Snow Fox paid no attention to the Cold Spirits’ actions.  Choosing a ravine, it departed with light, graceful steps.</p><p>After securing their prizes, the Cold Spirit leaders followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang took it all in, hearing Yanshan Laoren's transmission, “Quickly follow. Let’s see if you can still see it when it disappears.”</p><p>As the Snow Fox moved, its form flickered in and out of visibility, an ability likely stemming from instinct.</p><p>Connecting his mind with the Skyeye Butterfly, Qin Sang pursued.</p><p>It was unclear where the Snow Fox was headed.</p><p>It moved at a steady pace, leading the group of Cold Spirit leaders on a leisurely stroll beneath the snow layer.</p><p>After some distance, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  The Snow Fox gradually faded, reappearing a breath later.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Yanshan Laoren's voice reached his ear, filled with anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in confirmation, “I can see it.  It’s just a simple concealment technique.”</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly hadn't disappointed him.  Qin Sang inwardly praised it.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren expressed his satisfaction, his tone laced with a hint of joy, though he remained cautious. “The Snow Fox may have other abilities. Back then, Sect Master Situ exhausted every effort, even resorting to the precious treasures of Bu Nian Shan and setting a trap, but it still escaped, leaving behind only two small pieces of Cold Crystal.  To this day, we can't figure out how it managed to get away.  Moreover, the same trap can only be used on it once…”</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang asked, “Fellow Daoist, you understand its habits better than I. Do you have a plan? Should we directly capture it?”</p><p>Yanshan Laoren hesitated for a moment, then said, "We have no other choice. Fellow Daoist, don't you have a restrictive divine ability?  You can give it a try.  Even if we can't capture it, we can follow it to its lair. If even you are shaken off by it, we can only withdraw and devise another plan.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Skyeye Butterfly to keep a close watch on the Snow Fox, silently invoking the incantations for the Xuan Tian One Qi Great Capture Hand.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren positioned himself behind Qin Sang, discreetly retrieving a thin cord.  Anticipating the Snow Fox's direction, he moved ahead through the snow layer, attempting to intercept it.</p><p>A moment later,</p><p>The Snow Fox, oblivious to everything, continued its unhurried pace.</p><p>Suddenly, it seemed to sense something, its body tensing as its paws froze.</p><p>Behind it, a giant hand formed of profound energy materialized out of thin air, its five fingers outstretched as it reached to grab the fox.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang emerged from the shadows, calling out, “Now!”</p><p>Wherever the profound energy hand passed, the Cold Spirit leaders were frozen in place, expressions of fear etched on their faces.</p><p>The space around the Snow Fox solidified.</p><p>During the thirty years of protecting his main body, the External Body Incarnation had diligently cultivated, advancing this divine ability to the Grand Completion stage, its power now vastly different.</p><p>The restrictive power of the profound energy hand was especially formidable. Even cultivators of the same realm would struggle to break free.</p><p>The Snow Fox possessed peculiar abilities, its strength difficult to gauge, so Qin Sang held nothing back.</p><p>At the same time, a thin cord shot down from above, vibrating slightly as concentric ripples, like water waves, spread towards the Snow Fox.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren struck simultaneously.</p><p>Faced with the double restriction, the Snow Fox remained seemingly unaffected, completely unrestrained as it lunged downwards, its body vanishing into thin air.</p><p>Seeing the divine ability fail, Qin Sang immediately dispelled the profound energy hand, focusing all his attention on the Skyeye Butterfly. He indeed saw a blurred shadow.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang exclaimed, “Quickly, pursue it!”</p><p>Hearing this, Yanshan Laoren's face lit up with delight, closely following Qin Sang in pursuit.</p><p>The Snow Fox was slightly slower than them.</p><p>However, during the chase, they discovered that the Snow Fox could blink through space, as if teleporting, effortlessly widening the distance between them.</p><p>Moreover, this divine ability allowed it to pass through rock and stone.</p><p>Qin Sang, already gripping his Snowtreading Divine Saber, sliced open a passage in the wall.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The two burst through the shattered rock, continuing to lock onto the Snow Fox, relentlessly pursuing it.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang and Yanshan Laoren deployed various restrictive techniques, yet none could hinder the Snow Fox.</p><p>Yanshan Laoren muttered, no wonder his previous attempts to capture the Snow Fox had all ended in failure.</p><p>The Snow Fox wasn't descending straight down but moving diagonally forward, heading towards a specific direction.</p><p>“We guessed right! It's likely heading back to its lair!”</p><p>Yanshan Laoren exclaimed softly.</p><p>With this discovery, the two were no longer anxious, trailing the Snow Fox from a safe distance.</p>
