<h1>Chapter 2042: Xuwei</h1><p>Jian Nu said, "This old servant sent a message to Master, then returned to await True Person, but never saw Master."</p><p>They knew the dangers Tianyue Shangren would face, but they could do nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Fellow Daoist, are you returning to Baiyujing? Does Senior have any instructions?"</p><p>Jian Nu said somewhat茫然ly, "This old servant's cultivation is meager, unable to assist Master by his side. Master said he would be unsettled for a while, and allowed this old servant to decide my own path, no longer confined to Baiyujing. But this old servant has no relatives in the Great Thousand World, and old acquaintances have vanished without a trace along with the Dao Court. Besides Baiyujing, I know not where to go."</p><p>Since following Tianyue Shangren, he had considered himself a servant, utterly loyal to Tianyue Shangren, meticulously carrying out every command. Suddenly granted freedom, he was at a loss.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then said, "I am heading to Kanzhou to establish a Daoist Abode overseas. You might as well come with me to Kanzhou. If you wish to travel the Great Thousand World, the vastness of the Eastern Sea is yours to explore, and we can also look after each other. If you wish to enter secluded cultivation, this poor Daoist will reserve a cave dwelling for you in the Daoist Abode."</p><p>He chuckled, "The Daoist Abode I have chosen is located within the territory of foreign races, surrounded by enemies. I'm afraid peace will be hard to come by, but you won't lack opportunities to hone your swordsmanship."</p><p>If Qin Sang were forced to flee, Jian Nu remaining in Great Zhou could serve as support. Since he had escaped safely, it would be better to keep Jian Nu by his side.</p><p>Jian Nu was a pure sword cultivator, having received Tianyue Shangren's true inheritance. His swordsmanship was exceptional, likely unrivaled below the Void Refinement stage, undoubtedly a powerful combatant.</p><p>This whole time, Qin Sang had been pondering how to resolve the crisis and survive in the foreign race territory after finding the Storm Realm.</p><p>Relocating the entire realm was the worst option.</p><p>The myriad tribes of the Storm Realm, countless souls, even if Qin Sang's Small Cave Heaven were completely intact, he didn't know how many trips it would take. Moreover, space was unstable, and living beings couldn't survive within for long.</p><p>Using other artifacts for migration would inevitably cause a huge commotion. How could the foreign races along the way sit idly by? By then, the path ahead would be blocked, pursued from behind, and how many could ultimately survive?</p><p>Qin Sang believed that as long as the Storm Realm hadn't been destroyed, the situation wasn't desperate. Perhaps the Chang You Clan was attempting to devour the realm for themselves, blocking news and preventing other foreign races from interfering. Or perhaps the powerful beings of the foreign races, proud of their status, deemed the Storm Realm no threat to them, and left it to their subordinates to handle.</p><p>However, once he appeared in the Storm Realm, the nature of things would change.</p><p>With the Storm Realm suddenly becoming a Void Refinement power, the powerful beings of the foreign races surely wouldn't stand idly by. Therefore, even if he and Su Nu found the Storm Realm, they couldn't act rashly, directly attacking and repelling the Chang You Clan. They had to consider the geopolitical environment and employ strategy.</p><p>The internal situation of the Storm Realm was also complex. The various regions were originally separated by storms, with diverse customs and countless sects, as well as human, witch, and demon races, each with their own grudges and entanglements.</p><p>Both internally and externally, everything required careful unraveling and patient handling.</p><p>Thus, the Nascent Soul battle strength of the Storm Realm was crucial, the backbone, and it might be necessary to ask Jian Nu to lead the Storm Realm cultivators in battle.</p><p>Upon receiving Qin Sang's invitation, Jian Nu didn't hesitate and readily agreed, "At True Person's command!"</p><p>Having gained another powerful ally, Qin Sang's heart was filled with joy. He took Jian Nu to meet Su Nu and Gu Ya.</p><p>After introductions, Qin Sang only said Jian Nu was an old friend, not revealing his origins, and the two women didn't inquire further.</p><p>Learning of Jian Nu's cultivation level, Gu Ya was also overjoyed.  This time, they had brought back so many experts; hopefully, the Storm Realm could hold on until the day they arrived!</p><p>...</p><p>"This is Xuwei City."</p><p>Qin Sang smelled the slightly salty sea breeze and stepped on the stone slabs beneath his feet. The ground was solid.</p><p>He looked around, the sky was clear and boundless.</p><p>Under the azure sky, rooftops stretched in all directions like a forest. The pavilions and buildings here had a unique style, often adorned with objects from the sea, their shapes peculiar and colors vibrant. The roof tiles were made of polished special spirit shells, as clear as glazed tiles, shimmering under the scorching sun like waves washing over the immortal city.</p><p>The land was almost flat, not a single high peak in sight, like a vast, spread-out pancake extending in all directions, so vast it seemed endless.  The sea was nowhere to be seen, and if not for the scent of the sea breeze, one would think they were still on land.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the legend of the giant turtle, this immortal city seeming to lie upon a turtle's shell. The Xu and Wei constellations belonged to the northern Black Tortoise of the Seven Constellations; this city being named after them must have a reason.</p><p>Xuwei City was the capital of Kanzhou, one of the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, located in the Eastern Sea.  It was said that Kanzhou's territory was almost entirely at sea, composed of numerous islands.</p><p>"Brother Qin, have you sensed the giant turtle's will?"</p><p>Su Nu emerged from behind Qin Sang. She was quite interested in the legend of the giant turtle and had just attempted to probe the depths of the earth with her divine sense, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea, no different from any other place.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "A giant turtle capable of supporting an immortal city would possess unimaginable cultivation, beyond our reach. Even if it were still alive, Xuwei City wouldn't allow others to disturb its slumber, and would certainly set up a grand formation."</p><p>Jian Nu and Gu Ya followed behind them.</p><p>Gu Ya, one step closer to her sect, couldn't hide her excitement.</p><p>Jian Nu, undisturbed by external matters, simply glanced around before withdrawing his gaze, his mind never leaving his natal spirit sword.</p><p>After making some inquiries and understanding the layout of Xuwei City, the first place Qin Sang naturally wanted to visit was the Five Elements League.</p><p>Xuwei City was elliptical, its interior resembling the markings on a turtle shell, divided into sections. Like other large immortal cities, small teleportation formations were needed to travel within Xuwei City.</p><p>Arriving at the Five Elements League's area, Qin Sang first rented a courtyard to settle everyone down, then went to the Five Elements League alone.</p><p>After Qin Sang left, with nothing to do, Su Nu planned to invite the other two to go out and explore.</p><p>Each of the Eight Great Celestial Provinces had unique products. While other Celestial Provinces bordered the sea, Kanzhou was the only celestial province situated entirely at sea, possessing advantages unmatched by other provinces.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jian Nu had already entered meditation in his room.</p><p>"I don't know where Brother Qin found such a devoted cultivator!"</p><p>Su Nu shook her head, not pressing the matter.</p><p>...</p><p>"The Five Elements League."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the deep courtyard ahead, surprised that the Five Elements League in Xuwei City had this style.</p><p>No matter where in the Eight Great Celestial Provinces, the Five Elements League's signboard design and font were identical, differing only in color to indicate rank.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the courtyard, feeling himself pass through a layer of restrictive formations. Inside, there was indeed a different world.</p><p>The courtyard was deep and vast, each compound having its own independent restrictive formations.</p><p>From the outside, Xuwei City appeared sparse with vegetation, greenery hard to come by. Within the courtyard, however, clear springs flowed, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>A servant girl immediately came forward to greet him. Qin Sang presented his token, and the servant girl showed respect, leading him through a side corridor to a small courtyard where an octagonal stone pavilion stood.</p><p>"Elder Qin, please wait a moment in the pavilion. This servant will go and invite Elder You."</p><p>The servant girl bowed and withdrew.</p><p>Entering this space, Qin Sang sensed pure earth fire energy, knowing there must be a superior fire chamber within the courtyard.</p><p>"If Xuwei City is built upon a turtle's back, why would there be earth fire veins? The city's spiritual energy is so abundant, where do the spiritual veins originate? Could it be drawn from the giant turtle's life force?"</p><p>This thought suddenly crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Shortly after, sensing someone approaching, Qin Sang looked towards the pavilion entrance and saw a man in black robes slowly walking towards him. His expression was cold, his complexion fair and hair black, his age indeterminable. This must be Elder You.</p><p>This person's cultivation was similar to his own.  The one in charge of the Kanzhou Five Elements League must be someone else, but he wasn't yet qualified to be treated as a distinguished guest by such a figure. Being received by Elder You was quite appropriate.</p><p>The elders of the Five Elements League also had different ranks.  Qin Sang only held the title of Guest Elder, with no authority to interfere in the League's affairs.</p><p>Elder You held significant power within the League, and if dispatched to other immortal cities, he would be a local lord, not to be underestimated by any force.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed, "Greetings, Elder You."</p><p>"Greetings, Elder Qin."</p><p>Elder You returned the greeting, the coldness on his face softening slightly. After the formalities, he went straight to the point, "Elder Qin, have you come from another Celestial Province? What brings you here, and do you require any assistance from the League?"</p><p>The Five Elements League would try to fulfill the requests of every Guest Elder, as long as they weren't excessive.</p><p>Seeing Elder You's dislike for beating around the bush, Qin Sang stated his purpose, "This Qin has always been without a fixed abode, wandering about, which is not a long-term solution.  This time, I've come to Kanzhou to see if there are any suitable cultivation grounds. I wonder if the League has a detailed sea chart for this Qin to peruse?"</p><p>Hearing this, Elder You's spirits lifted. "Elder Qin plans to stay in Kanzhou long-term?"</p><p>A passing Guest Elder wouldn't be of much help to their branch, a perfunctory courtesy would suffice.</p><p>If the other party planned to settle in Kanzhou, it was a different matter, worth putting effort into attracting them.</p><p>"What are Elder Qin's plans? To seek shelter under an established power, or to establish your own Daoist Abode? If it's the former, the League has a few vacant cave dwellings that Elder Qin can choose from. In addition, this one has cultivated in Kanzhou since childhood, and due to the League's connections, I have dealings with many renowned sects and can make introductions for Elder Qin.  With Elder Qin's abilities, once word gets out, those sects will surely compete to extend invitations.  Rest assured, Elder Qin, our League doesn't have that many restrictions, and the two are not mutually exclusive."</p><p>Elder You was genuinely considering Qin Sang's interests.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal, "This Qin knows little about Kanzhou and wishes to understand the situation before making a decision."</p><p>"That's only natural, this one was presumptuous." Elder You nodded and immediately ordered someone to fetch the sea chart.</p><p>The sea chart was inscribed on a jade slip.  With a flick of his divine sense, Qin Sang grasped the full picture.</p><p>It seemed Elder You wasn't trying to make things difficult for him, providing the entire sea chart of Kanzhou.</p><p>Little information could be gleaned from the sea chart. If Qin Sang truly wanted to establish a Daoist Abode here, he would have to explore it personally. Naturally, he didn't have that much time. After a brief glance, he looked towards the eastern border of Kanzhou, but found little information about the outside world.</p><p>He didn't find the location of the Sea of Fog that he cared about most.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, his true essence manifesting the sea chart, pointing to an immortal city on the eastern border, curiously asking, "Is this the League's furthest branch?"</p><p>This city was built on Sleepless Island, and was thus named Sleepless City.</p><p>Sleepless City had a teleportation formation connecting it to other immortal cities, almost bordering Kanzhou. Other immortal cities were the same, these cities acting like gateways to Kanzhou, firmly guarding its borders.</p><p>Judging by Elder You's tone, Kanzhou hadn't expanded its territory for a long time.</p><p>"The situation at sea seems unfavorable..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>The Five Elements League had a branch in Mount Wuyu, beyond Dezhou, in the dark territories, but not a single branch beyond Kanzhou.</p><p>Elder You looked towards where Qin Sang was pointing, nodding in agreement. He faintly guessed Qin Sang's intention, suspecting that this person might not want to be restricted and desired to establish a Daoist Abode in the deep sea.</p><p>"Elder Qin, having just arrived in Kanzhou, you might not be aware.  Beyond other Celestial Provinces, the surrounding areas are mostly still dominated by our human race, influenced by Great Zhou, and capable of communication. Kanzhou is different.  The sea is teeming with monstrous creatures, and the vast ocean is home to countless monstrous tribes. The aquatic races of the Eastern Sea are even more numerous..."</p><p>As he spoke, Elder You seemed to recall something, saying with a hint of emotion, "This one has heard a saying since childhood, a rumor that the sea wasn't originally our human race's territory. Relying on the grand teleportation formations, reinforcements were constantly sent, allowing us to gain a foothold and gradually develop it into a Celestial Province.  There is the Dragon Palace in the Eastern Sea, ruling over all monsters, the king of the Eastern Sea's aquatic races.  However, in my thousands of years of cultivation, I can't recall how many monster uprisings have occurred, but I've never seen a true dragon emerge from the Dragon Palace."</p><p>"A true dragon?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.</p><p>Many legends spoke of true dragons, all describing them as sacred beasts, auspicious beasts blessed by the heavens and earth's fortune. If there truly were dragons in the world, they would undoubtedly be apex powerhouses.</p><p>The situation in the Eastern Sea was incredibly complex.</p><p>There were the Eight Great Celestial Provinces of the human race, the foreign races of the Sea of Fog, the mysterious Dragon Palace, and who knew how many other races and powers existed.</p><p>Elder You also extended a wisp of true essence, attaching it to the edge of the sea chart. A mist arose, transforming into another sea chart.</p><p>However, the content of this sea chart was much simpler and more vague compared to Kanzhou's.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that there were also human sects within, and quite a few.</p><p>"This is a chart drawn ten years ago. The situation in the deep sea is even more volatile than Kanzhou's, and it should be surveyed anew.</p><p>"Elder Qin, please look. These sects were all founded by our human race, each powerful and with a long heritage.  It is said that there are also hidden, peerless experts cultivating in the deep sea.</p><p>"But Elder Qin, don't think that without Great Zhou's Heavenly Law there, it's truly unrestrained.  Our level of cultivation is not enough to act with impunity.</p><p>"To gain a foothold there, race isn't the primary factor. One must possess sufficient strength to deter external enemies, requiring alliances with other powers.  Within these alliances, there are also rules, perhaps even stricter than Great Zhou's Heavenly Law.</p><p>"As this one said before, there is no peace in the Eastern Sea!"</p><p>Following Elder You's guidance, Qin Sang looked over them one by one, finding that the deeper into the sea he looked, the weaker the human forces became.</p><p>There were also monster tribes there, creating a situation of mixed human and foreign races. It was unknown whether they coexisted peacefully.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He saw a mark Elder You had made in the distant sea, with the characters 'Sea of Fog'.</p>
