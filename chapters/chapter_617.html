Chapter 610: Silver Needle Lock and Stone Bridge Zen

Chen Yan's eyes shifted, filled with a chilling killing intent.
Unfazed, Duke Dongyang spoke in a cold, eerie tone.
“Cultivating the Profound Jade Cauldron Scripture results in the birth of a heart demon due to the dual cultivation practice. The more individuals involved in this practice, the stronger the heart demon becomes. Moreover, it becomes deeply rooted, almost impossible to erase.
“Some have sought secret methods to eliminate the heart demon, only to find them futile. The heart demon can resurface at any time.
“The vast majority of those who cultivate this method fail. Before even sensing a breakthrough opportunity, they succumb to the ever-growing heart demon, suffering backlash and perishing.
“Even if they manage to find a sliver of opportunity to reach Nascent Soul, many fail to overcome the heart demon tribulation, perishing during the Nascent Soul tribulation.
“Successful cases are few and far between, and almost all are exceptionally talented. Some, no less talented than you, achieved Nascent Soul after only one use of this forbidden technique.
“With their talent, even without resorting to forbidden techniques, their chances of reaching Nascent Soul were high, with a boundless future. Using the forbidden technique only plants a hidden danger, destabilizing their Dao Heart, and leaving them tormented by the heart demon.
“For this very reason, cultivators with poor talent cannot use it, and those with good talent are unwilling and dare not use it. This method eventually became forbidden.
“However, this isn't the most terrifying hidden danger of the Profound Jade Cauldron Scripture!”
At this point, Duke Dongyang paused, glancing at Qin Sang.
“The dual cultivation process of this forbidden technique is essentially a contest of willpower and Dao Heart between the two parties, resulting in three possible outcomes.
“If the cultivator succeeds, it goes without saying.
“If the cultivator fails, suffering backlash from the other party, their Dao Heart might be shattered, turning them into a demonic slave. In the case of women, there’s a more pleasant name: Dark Maiden.
“This situation mostly occurs in cultivators who have used this forbidden technique multiple times. Their heart demon grows stronger, their Dao Heart becomes unstable, and it’s only natural for the tables to turn.
“Then there’s your situation, where the other party persists to the end, and the cultivator isn’t consumed by backlash. It’s a stalemate. While it avoids the tragic outcome of becoming a demonic slave, the other party becomes an indelible mark on the cultivator’s heart!”
“The world is unpredictable!”
Duke Dongyang’s lips curled into a strange smile.
“Lady Chen Yan, you vehemently refused me back then, not allowing my Core Formation disciples to be your cauldron. You must have sensed something, didn't you?
“While Dao Heart isn't solely determined by cultivation level, those with higher cultivation, having experienced enlightenment multiple times, generally possess a stronger Dao Heart and willpower.
“Who would have thought that a disciple with such poor talent, a five-element spiritual root, barely managing to establish their foundation with the help of Dragon Ginseng, would have such a firm Dao Heart, even one on the verge of Nascent Soul couldn’t break it?
“I myself wasn't entirely sure, repeatedly testing you, yet you never revealed a flaw. Later, during your tribulation, I accidentally discovered that you actually used the Silver Needle Lock technique within yourself, and only then did I confirm it!”
Listening to Duke Dongyang's lengthy explanation, Qin Sang was completely bewildered.
Recalling the dual cultivation process from back then, his mind had been preoccupied with his own foundation, fearing being drained dry, and he hadn't sensed any so-called Dao Heart struggle.
Did Duke Dongyang conceal the key details of the Profound Jade Cauldron Scripture from Chen Yan, leading her to be unaware and show mercy?
Or was it the jade Buddha's protection that spared him from this calamity?
Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Chen Yan.
What exactly was this so-called mark that drove Chen Yan to use the Silver Needle Lock on herself?
Chen Yan seemed to have indeed been exposed by Duke Dongyang.
Her face was extremely pale, biting her lip until it bled.
Duke Dongyang showed no intention of stopping, indifferent to Chen Yan's reaction. “You thought using the Silver Needle Lock technique to shield the mark's influence would solve the problem naturally after Qin Sang’s death? How naive! If this forbidden technique's hidden danger could be resolved by the mere Silver Needle Lock technique, would it still be called forbidden?”
Duke Dongyang pointed at Qin Sang. “Believe it or not, if I kill him right now in front of you, your Dao Heart will instantly collapse, your cultivation plummeting from Nascent Soul back to Core Formation!  You still want to save your master? Dream on!”
These words made both Qin Sang and Chen Yan’s faces change drastically.
Qin Sang never imagined that his fate was inexplicably tied to the woman who had used him for dual cultivation.
One instance of selling himself had led to this lingering disaster.
But on second thought, if he truly became an indelible mark on Chen Yan’s heart, she would have to protect his life with all her might to prevent her cultivation from plummeting.
For him, this might actually be a good thing.
Just then, Chen Yan suddenly spoke coldly, “If that’s the case, why haven’t you killed him yet? If my cultivation falls back to Core Formation, you can easily seize the blood pearl and achieve your goal.”
Hearing this, Qin Sang also realized this point. He hadn’t expected Chen Yan to be so calm, not falling for Duke Dongyang’s bluff, and immediately identifying the crux of the matter.
With Duke Dongyang’s deep scheming and ruthless methods, since he had already shown his hand, he definitely wouldn't hold back.
There must be some falsehood in his words.
That he had an impact on Chen Yan was likely true.
But whether his death would truly cause Chen Yan’s Dao Heart to collapse and her cultivation to fall back to Core Formation was questionable. Duke Dongyang's actions indicated that he wasn’t entirely certain and feared unforeseen circumstances.
A flicker of annoyance flashed in Duke Dongyang's eyes, but his tone remained calm. "Lady Chen Yan, you're welcome to gamble. At most, I’ll lose one opportunity to find the treasure. But what price will you pay? Not only will you fail to save your master this time, but your own cultivation will also fall back to Core Formation. Returning to Nascent Soul will be as difficult as ascending to heaven, and you might never have the chance to save your master again! Even if your master's cultivation is extraordinary, trapped in the Demonic Abyss, how many more years can she survive?"
Seeing Chen Yan’s silence, Duke Dongyang looked up at the bronze hall's ceiling.
"Lady Chen Yan, let me be honest. The true treasure in this tower isn't in the Demonic Abyss, but above! That treasure is also the key to sealing the Demonic Abyss. Once I obtain it, I can easily break the seal.
"Unless absolutely necessary, I don't want to create an irreconcilable feud with you and your master.
"The hidden danger of the Profound Jade Cauldron Scripture isn’t entirely without a solution.
"I have a Buddhist cultivation technique called Stone Bridge Zen, a rare esoteric method of the emotionless path.
"I've already sealed Qin Sang's cultivation with a restriction talisman.
"Once I hand him over to you, you only need to take him back to your cave and keep him. At the opportune moment, cultivate the Stone Bridge Zen, embrace the mark as your true heart, and wholeheartedly treat him as your most intimate lover, spending every moment together.
"When your love reaches its peak, intertwined and inseparable, then cultivate the emotionless path, killing your husband to achieve enlightenment.
"Not only will this resolve the hidden danger, but it might even turn misfortune into blessing, further enhancing your cultivation!"
