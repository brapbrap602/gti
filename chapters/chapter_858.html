<h1>Chapter 850: The Unexpected</h1><p>Two great demons met at the entrance of the valley.</p><p>The giant bear roared, its running shaking the earth and mountains.</p><p>The golden eagle soared into the sky, dodging the bear's charge.</p><p>Its eyes flashed with golden light, staring at the distant forest, as if it had discovered something. Seeing the bear relentless, it let out an angry cry.</p><p>Prompted by the eagle, the bear turned its dark head, even more enraged, believing that the treasures in its territory had been stolen by a despicable thief.</p><p>In an instant, the golden eagle flew in the air, and the giant bear ran on the ground. The earth trembled, ancient trees snapped, and wind swept the fallen leaves. The speed of the two demons was surprisingly even.</p><p>And, with the bear's roar, the surrounding monsters began to gather here, the beginnings of a beast tide gradually taking shape.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang and the others, who were flying away, also noticed the commotion.</p><p>"Not good, that golden eagle's magic is extraordinary, it might have discovered the traces we left. We've been exposed."</p><p>Kong Yun landed on an ancient tree and looked back.</p><p>A golden lightning bolt streaked across the layered clouds in the sky, rushing towards them.</p><p>Smoke billowed on the ground, there was more than one great demon.</p><p>"The valley was originally within the territory of a demon bear. I don't know where the golden eagle came from. Its strength is probably no less than the bear's. Both are late Core Formation demons, very troublesome."</p><p>Yue Xiangu was injured by the True Demonic Qi, but after taking the elixir, her injury had been suppressed.</p><p>"It will take several hours to escape from here to outside the island.  We might run into other demons' territories along the way, and several fierce battles are unavoidable.  With our strength, as long as we are not trapped in a beast tide, escaping shouldn't be difficult. Only Sunu's cultivation is too weak. A casual blow from a great demon could kill her. We can't let her face such danger..."</p><p>Since they were exposed, there was no need to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others discussed as they rushed out of the dense forest, their escape lights breaking through the air, flying with all their might.</p><p>The peace of the Demon Island was shattered. Qin Sang and his companions were trapped in the demon's nest, with powerful demons in hot pursuit, not daring to stop for a moment.  Qin Sang activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, his true essence continuously depleting.</p><p>Among the four, his cultivation was the weakest, and his true essence the least.</p><p>Fortunately, it wasn't a critical moment requiring full-speed escape. He didn't need to fully activate the talisman.  Holding spirit stones, Qin Sang could keep pace with the others.</p><p>Mountains and rivers retreated beneath their feet.  Fearless demons attacked them along the way, but were easily dealt with.</p><p>The biggest problem was the golden eagle and the giant bear in pursuit. Their speed and endurance were strong, and the distance between them was slowly closing.</p><p>The chase continued for more than two hours.</p><p>The golden eagle, using some unknown magic, suddenly closed the distance significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others wanted to eliminate the golden eagle first, but it was very alert, maintaining a safe distance, spitting thunder and shooting golden feathers to harass them, which was extremely annoying.</p><p>They saw the golden eagle sending signals, probably summoning other great demons, attempting to encircle them.</p><p>Therefore, although they were stronger than the golden eagle and the giant bear, they didn't dare to stop and fight. These two demons were cunning and tough, and it was impossible to kill them quickly. Doing so would only waste time.</p><p>As time passed, Qin Sang and the others' true essence was greatly depleted, and the endurance of the golden eagle and giant bear was also tested. Neither side could maintain top speed indefinitely.</p><p>However, their speed was still fast, and the gathering demons were left far behind.</p><p>Less than an hour away from escaping the Demon Island, they heard a strange neigh nearby, like the sound of a horse.</p><p>Then they saw a white light shoot out from the side. It was a Heavenly Horse.</p><p>"Another Core Formation demon!"</p><p>Zhu Shan Weng exclaimed.</p><p>Their escape lights stopped abruptly, and they saw the Heavenly Horse riding the clouds, while the golden eagle and the black bear behind them were invigorated.  After communicating with calls, the great demons surrounded and attacked them.</p><p>Demonic Qi soared from the horizon, and other great demons were approaching.</p><p>"We must make a decision. My strength is likely greater than yours. I'll stay behind. Fellow Daoists Zhu Shan and Kong Yun, help me hold back these three demons. Daoist Qing Feng, your escape technique is the best. Conserve your energy, find an opportunity, and immediately take Sunu away. We'll meet outside the island."</p><p>Yue Xiangu handed Sunu over to Qin Sang.</p><p>The treasure was still in her hands, so she wasn't worried that Qin Sang wouldn't protect Sunu wholeheartedly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect Yue Xiangu to actually stay behind and entrust Sunu to him. But on second thought, even if he stayed, the possibility of death was small.</p><p>Their strength wasn't weak, and they weren't afraid of the demons. It was only because of Sunu that they were hesitant. If he took Sunu away first, the others could deal with the situation calmly.</p><p>They quickly discussed.</p><p>At this time, the Heavenly Horse and other demons had arrived.</p><p>Both the golden eagle and giant bear were top-tier great demons, while the Heavenly Horse was slightly weaker.  When the two sides met, they immediately engaged in a fierce battle.  Qin Sang shielded Sunu, blocking the residual energy for her.  Seeing an opening, with sword light and dragon soul intertwined, he burst forth with extreme speed, instantly breaking through the encirclement and speeding away.</p><p>The three demons weren't stupid. Seeing Qin Sang escape, they assumed the treasure was on him and immediately abandoned their other targets.</p><p>Yue Xiangu quickly ordered them to intercept.  Her silk thread magic weapon had recovered and entangled the three demons, exceptionally strong.  Zhu Shan Weng and Kong Yun also attacked with all their might.  Yue Xiangu staying behind was the right choice.  The golden eagle and giant bear were ferocious and powerful, and only a late Core Formation expert like her could hold them back.</p><p>Qin Sang shook off the three demons and sped towards the edge of the island without looking back.</p><p>Sunu looked at the battlefield behind, then at Qin Sang in his cloak, her lips slightly pursed.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn't encounter any other great demons on the way.</p><p>Qin Sang escaped to the edge of the Demon Island in one go. Looking back, demonic Qi filled the sky, a chaotic scene of demons, the former peace completely shattered.</p><p>At this time, he could still faintly see the black clouds at the center of the island.</p><p>He quickly glanced and found that Yue Xiangu and the others were still behind, so he didn't stay any longer. After confirming the direction, he flew towards the agreed-upon location.</p><p>Sunu was very well-behaved and didn't say a word, which saved Qin Sang a lot of trouble.</p><p>Demons outside the island were also attracted by the phenomenon. The sea was turbulent.  Qin Sang cleared a path with the Ebony Sword, finally escaping the horde.  He thought he was safe, but unexpectedly, not far away, three lights appeared from nowhere and flew towards them.</p><p>They were clearly the escape lights of cultivators on flying swords â€“ three strangers.</p><p>"There are still surviving cultivators nearby?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and frowned slightly.</p><p>The other party had already spotted them and were flying straight towards them at a considerable speed.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, shielding Sunu behind him. Secretly, he grasped the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings in his hand.  With a light tap of his finger, the Ebony Sword flew into the air, pointing forward, unleashing its sword Qi without reservation, displaying his hostility and warning the other party.</p><p>The escape lights stopped far in front of them, revealing three figures. Looking at Qin Sang and Sunu, they also seemed surprised.</p>
