Chapter 372: Giant Hornets


“How many are there?”
Yun Youzi asked.
Qin Sang replied, “Only one spotted so far.”
Yun Youzi mused, “We’ve been careful in the market, haven’t made any enemies.  This doesn’t seem directed at us. Could it be someone's revenge, brought upon us by someone else?”
“Could Kong Xin have inadvertently leaked the news about the cold gold ore?” Qin Sang glanced at Kong Xin’s back. He was diligently leading the way, unusually compliant.
As for the woman in red and the others, their behavior was unremarkable.  Qin Sang and Yun Youzi hadn’t noticed anyone leaving marks or sending messages.
“It’s possible!”
Yun Youzi pondered, “I’ll watch the rear. Qin, you keep an eye on Kong Xin and the others. If it’s nothing, great. If things change, we either capture the ringleader first or escape using the spirit bamboo boat.  It's best if we can take Kong Xin with us. The Wuyaya Valley is complex and unpredictable; it can't be explained in a few words. We still need Kong Xin to guide us…”
Qin Sang nodded. “Senior, buy me some time. Once I can unleash my talisman treasures, I won’t fear any ghosts or demons.”
“Good!”
…
The winding path led upward after a distance. Qin Sang set up several warning talismans along the way, none were triggered.
After an hour's walk, the cave mouth finally appeared ahead.
Confirming the outside was safe, everyone filed out, finally escaping the oppressive passage.
The cave exit was halfway up the mountain, the nest of demons directly overhead.  Everyone held their breath, following Kong Xin through the mountain.
Before reaching the foot of the mountain, Kong Xin suddenly stopped, turning to the master and apprentice, pointing to the left and whispering, “The herbs you need grow on that cliff over there. I'll take you there. The others can rest here for a bit, I’ll be quick.”
Looking in the direction Kong Xin indicated, they could only see a chaotic expanse of blood-red mist.
It was just below the demon's nest, with swirling blood miasma and deafening demon howls – clearly not a safe place.
The woman in red and the others were unwilling to risk their lives for others and were about to agree, when Qin Sang suddenly said, “This place is on the edge of the demon nest.  If Kong goes alone and encounters danger, we might not be able to rescue him in time. It’s safer to go together.  What do you two think?”
Qin Sang's suggestion wasn't to risk the master and apprentice's lives; it was a test.
If Kong Xin was lying, and there were no herbs, then something was wrong with Kong Xin.
Yun Youzi immediately understood Qin Sang's intentions.
The woman in red and the cultivator surnamed Bao exchanged glances, pondered for a moment, and then agreed.
The cultivator surnamed Bao fanned himself, jokingly addressing the master and apprentice, “You don't mind us snatching the herbs, right?”
The master and apprentice exchanged glances. The master chuckled, “The herbs I need are Blood Poison Flowers, not of high quality, but with peculiar properties. They're only useful for my apprentice's illness, nothing else.  I doubt they’d interest you.  We'd be grateful for your escort.”
Reaching a consensus, they changed direction, traversing the mountain without incident. Soon, they found their path blocked by a deep abyss.
From the abyss came not only demonic roars, but also a strange buzzing sound.
Kong Xin pointed across the abyss, “Look, the Blood Poison Flowers are there.”
Everyone looked, and saw a crack in the cliff face on the other side, where a silver-plate-sized, blood-red flower grew – the very herb the master and apprentice needed.
Oddly, there were dozens of enormous black spheres hanging on the cliff face below the Blood Poison Flower.
Upon closer inspection, everyone gasped.
They were beehives!
The hives were pitch black. Even more terrifying, enormous black hornets, each the size of a fist, occasionally flew out.
The buzzing sound was from these hornets.
The hornets were ferocious, with three pairs of blood-red wings, and barbed stingers at their tails, glowing with an eerie green light – clearly venomous.
One might be manageable, but there were thousands in these hives.
Judging from the spiritual energy fluctuations in their wings, these were no ordinary hornets.  They had likely mutated over countless years in the blood miasma.


Even Foundation Establishment cultivators would likely face a grim end if caught in a swarm of these poisonous bees.

"Fellow cultivator, do you intend to collect the Blood Poison Flower while facing these poisonous bees?"

The cultivator surnamed Bao watched the buzzing bees, his scalp tingling.  A look of shock appeared in his eyes, and he unconsciously took a few steps back, fearing he might be discovered.

The master and disciple were also surprised by the number of strange poisonous bees, their faces grim.

The elder said resolutely, "I've searched far and wide for years to find this Blood Poison Flower. I must try."

Kong Xin said sternly, "As agreed, I've brought you here, completing my task.  Collecting the Blood Poison Flower is up to you. The remaining payment…"

The elder tossed a pouch to Kong Xin, bowing. "Thank you, fellow cultivator."

Kong Xin checked the pouch, a satisfied smile appearing on his face.  "These poisonous bees are not easy to deal with. Fellow cultivator, please be careful. We must continue deeper into the Unyielding Valley, so we won't accompany you."

At that moment, Qin Sang, who had been silent, suddenly moved, darting to the edge of the abyss. After a moment's thought, he took out a spirit-binding rope.

He brushed the rope, concealing its glow, and then flicked it, sending the rope silently towards the beehive.

Seeing Qin Sang's action, fearing they might be affected, the others quickly moved back.

Only Yunyouzi remained behind Qin Sang, holding his magical weapon, ready to rescue him.

Everyone was curious about the bees, but no one wanted to risk provoking them.  Seeing Qin Sang willing to take the lead, including the elder, nobody stopped him.

Qin Sang ignored their thoughts; his aim was simply to capture a few bees.

If he wasn't mistaken, these bees should be a rare insect called Ghost Head Bees.

Among the relics of Elder Di Que, the jade slip left by the Golden Core cultivator from the Imperial Spirit Sect, described Ghost Head Bees, noting them as a rare insect.

However, these bees differed significantly from those in the jade slip. The most obvious difference was their three pairs of blood-red wings; true Ghost Head Bees have transparent wings.

These bees were also larger than the described Ghost Head Bees.

Since obtaining the jade slip, this was Qin Sang's first encounter with such insects.

He didn't have the time or resources to search the cultivation world for rare insects like Elder Di Que, but this opportunity was one he wouldn't miss.
