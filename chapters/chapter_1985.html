<h1>Chapter 1976: Serving Tea</h1><p>A streak of light shot out from the Soul-Stealing Abyss, incredibly swift. It traversed the wasteland, entered Duskfall Mountain, and headed east.</p><p>The light resembled a grey wave of smoke cleaving the sky, rolling and surging.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The sound of its passage was like thunder from heaven, earth-shattering, bringing unprecedented shock to the wasteland and Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>Countless cultivators were jolted awake from their meditative states, their faces filled with horror.</p><p>Even before the sound reached them, a terrifying pressure permeated the world.</p><p>It felt as if the sky was about to collapse!</p><p>Instinctive fear caused countless people to tremble, huddling in their caves, shivering.</p><p>Doomsday was upon them; the heavens were collapsing, and there was nowhere to escape.</p><p>The thought of resistance never even entered their minds; the pressure felt like the will of Heaven itself.</p><p>Born between heaven and earth, how dare they defy the will of Heaven?</p><p>…</p><p>In a valley, greenery was like a sea, ancient trees towering.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>Joyful sounds echoed from the woods.</p><p>Through the gaps in the leaves, a group of white-furred, long-armed spirit monkeys could be seen chasing and playing.</p><p>These monkeys leaped from branch to branch with ease, incredibly agile.</p><p>Their movements had a strange rhythm, like a unique, innate martial art.</p><p>The monkeys noticed nothing.</p><p>On a nearby tree, a faint human figure stood, observing the monkeys with interest, fingers moving slightly, seemingly mimicking their movements.</p><p>Suddenly, the person’s expression changed.  The figure flickered, pressing close to the tree trunk, their body becoming like water, seeping into the bark, merging with the ancient tree.</p><p>The tree's bark twisted, revealing a terrified human face.</p><p>The monkeys sensed the anomaly, letting out sharp cries, scattering.</p><p>Even hidden within the tree, the person felt unsafe. They escaped from the trunk into the ground, using secret techniques to hide within the roots.</p><p>The next moment, the streak of light flew overhead.</p><p>Underground, a figure the size of a cicada huddled in the tree roots, trembling uncontrollably, not daring to return to the surface for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>A peculiar peak in Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>The scenery was beautiful, the spiritual energy abundant.</p><p>Here stood a sect named the Eight Cauldrons Sect, known for being both righteous and shadowy, quite famous throughout Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect's founder was a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Subsequent sect leaders failed to surpass the founder, until the current leader discovered flaws in their cultivation techniques.  Removing these flaws, the current leader broke through to the Divine Transformation stage, a prodigious talent indeed.</p><p>Because of the current leader's feat, the Eight Cauldrons Sect's reputation spread throughout Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>However, this leader was very sensible, not rushing to expand the sect. They focused on steady progress, and disciplined their disciples against arrogance.</p><p>One day, the tranquility of the mountain gate was shattered by urgent bell tolls.</p><p>The Xuan Bell's sound meant the Eight Cauldrons Sect faced a life-or-death crisis.</p><p>Along with the bell, came the Sect Leader's roar, "Quickly activate the mountain-guarding formation!"</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect disciples were terrified; they had never seen their leader so urgent and panicked.</p><p>The moment the formation activated, the terrifying pressure swept over them.</p><p>Even the mountain-guarding formation could not block the pressure.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect disciples trembled, involuntarily kneeling on the ground.</p><p>In front of the Leader's Hall, the Eight Cauldrons Sect Leader stared fixedly at the streak of light in the sky, maintaining composure with immense willpower.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with awe, horror, and intense anticipation!</p><p>…</p><p>The river flowed endlessly.</p><p>The river ran between two mountains, the terrain treacherous, the current swift.</p><p>Whitecaps constantly splashed on the surface.</p><p>Occasionally, river fish leaped from the water.  The moment they fell, a slender black shadow would emerge from beneath the surface, revealing a pointed mouth full of sharp teeth, swallowing the fish in one gulp.</p><p>When the pressure arrived…</p><p>In an instant, the wind howled, the waves surged, and the water from the riverbed seemed to be churned up.</p><p>The streak of light flew by, disappearing into the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The river gradually calmed, and a creature, neither snake nor fish, floated to the surface, belly up, lifeless.</p><p>It was the fish-eating beast.</p><p>It had been so terrified it died instantly!</p><p>…</p><p>The higher one's cultivation, the more intensely they felt the power of the streak of light's owner.</p><p>They finally witnessed a legendary Void Refinement cultivator, one capable of controlling the heavens and the earth, but such an impact was not something everyone could withstand.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu seemed very urgent, dashing through the air, making no effort to conceal his movements.</p><p>He had reason to be; the Heavenly Dragon Pillar was unearthed by the Nine Immortals of Yun City. Only two people were present at the Soul-Stealing Abyss; they were powerless to stop the Nine Immortals.</p><p>Even a moment's delay might allow the Nine Immortals of Yun City to seize the advantage.</p><p>Concealing his aura was pointless; in the vicinity, only Gu Yunshou possessed the qualifications to compete for the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>With the Panlong Heavenly Pillar's appearance, even Gu Yunshou couldn't remain idle and would undoubtedly descend the mountain.</p><p>The value of a single Panlong Heavenly Pillar surpassed all other relics combined. The gentlemen's agreement between the two sects did not include the Panlong Heavenly Pillar!</p><p>Gu Yunshou's manifestation, though less spectacular than that of the Minghu Ancestor, still caused quite a stir in Yunshan, his speed undiminished.</p><p>...</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang, having left his secluded dwelling at some point, soared into the sky, gazing north.</p><p>"He's already come out?" he murmured, quite surprised.  A Refinement Void cultivator acting, shaking the world.</p><p>His manipulations in the Fire Domain, intervening in the mortal realm, were all designed to lure two Refinement Void cultivators out of hiding.  His wish had been granted, yet it was unexpectedly swift and easy.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure of the Red Fire Copper Pillar's true worth.  It might have been enough to alarm two Refinement Void cultivators, but he hadn't held high hopes.  As long as it sparked conflict between the two sects and exacerbated their animosity, it would have served its purpose.</p><p>He had prepared a two-pronged approach, intervening in the mortal world while making his move, gradually dragging both sects into a mire.  He hadn't anticipated such a quick victory; his subsequent plans became unnecessary.  Clearly, the Red Fire Copper Pillar’s value far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Losing such a treasure didn't bother Qin Sang; it wasn't important.  Instead, he felt a surge of excitement, eager for action.  Excellent!  Some of his ideas could finally be tested.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he looked down at Qingyang Temple.  Smoke curled from the cooking fires in the village below.</p><p>Yu Lang had achieved great success; the academy had become a sacred place in the hearts of Yan Kingdom's people, with scholars constantly visiting as pilgrims.  Qipai Village had thrived, expanding and prospering, becoming a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his palm downwards.  An invisible curtain enveloped the land, obscuring it from mortal eyes and concealing all energy fluctuations.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain peak where Qingyang Temple stood suddenly split.  The fissure ran through the mountain, bisecting the temple's main hall.  The mountain slowly leaned to either side, teetering on the brink of collapse. The mountain's interior was exposed, flashing with lightning, and the main altar appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged high above the altar, eyes closed in meditation, his hands forming lightning seals.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A muffled thunder, seemingly from the depths of the earth, echoed across the land.  The mortals below heard nothing; their lives continued undisturbed. Even nearby cultivators remained oblivious.  Qin Sang intentionally suppressed all unusual phenomena, yet his actions didn't cease; his hand seals changed rapidly, increasingly fast.  Each completed seal released a lightning talisman, sinking into the main altar.  Lightning then erupted from the altar, shooting towards the heavens; divine thunder filled the sky.</p><p>In an instant, a vast sea of lightning formed. Qin Sang stood within this sea of thunder; beneath him, the lightning coalesced into an enormous altar, connecting heaven and earth, brewing divine power, yet remaining dormant.</p><p>The main altar below then manifested another anomaly, emitting a blinding silver light, overshadowing even the celestial lightning sea above. A silver ‘sheet’ emerged from the altar, radiating an intensely mysterious aura.  The silver sheet was covered in writing that constantly shifted.  These characters were incredibly profound, embodying the ultimate principles of heaven and earth; a single character seemed to contain boundless knowledge.  Mortals who even glanced at it risked mental collapse and having their brains burst.</p><p>The silver sheet trembled, poised to escape the altar and shoot skyward, but Qin Sang held it in check.  His actions initiated the altar, accumulating power, not yet unleashing its full potential.</p><p>The main altar's appearance activated the entire array.  In the four cardinal directions, Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou—four Divine Transformation cultivators—sat cross-legged atop their respective sub-altars, solemn-faced.  They served as the four pillars of the array, stabilizing the four cardinal points and protecting the main altar.</p><p>Qin Sang’s will, transmitted through the main altar, flowed through the array; the sub-altars beneath the four Divine Transformation cultivators blazed with lightning.  Other sub-altars also had masters presiding over them – fire spirits, monsters; almost no humans, all in their original forms. Over the years, they had been placed under the four Divine Transformation cultivators, learning thunder techniques, achieving varying degrees of mastery.  Now, these creatures, mimicking human postures, followed the silent commands, casting spells, their bodies enveloped in raging thunder and fire; as if the altars themselves were burning.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't demand high comprehension from them; they only needed to wield thunder magic, garrison the branch temples, and secure the temple formations.</p><p>The four transformed gods followed Qin Sang's guidance, and the branch temple masters in turn obeyed the four transformed gods.</p><p>Branch temples and the main temple—all temple masters were interconnected, forming a vast temple formation covering the land!</p><p>Qin Sang was the master of the main temple, the controller of the formation.</p><p>For the first time, he truly activated the formation, feeling the entire array, revealing a strange expression.</p><p>At this moment, what came to his mind were the scenes in the talisman world.</p><p>The remnants of the Daoist court, relying on the temple altars, gathered the power of Daoism.  Grandmaster Zhang, using the altar to summon a deity, broke through and annihilated the Great Multiplicity.</p><p>The astonishing power was awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang finally experienced the power of the temple altar firsthand—it truly lived up to its reputation!</p><p>However, the altar beneath him was certainly not among the top ones in the entire Daoist court.</p><p>The path to immortality was long; he still had a long way to go.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, slowly opened his eyes, and stood on the thunder altar.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang took a step to his left, and an exact duplicate of himself remained where he stood.</p><p>Two Qin Sangs stood side-by-side, one the original, the other a Dharma body.</p><p>This was a true Dharma body, not the incarnations from his past lives.</p><p>The Dharma body slightly raised both hands, palms down.  Sword light flashed, and a sword shadow appeared, the sword hanging upside down, slowly rotating.</p><p>This sword was the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>Moreover, it was the Grey Warbler Sword, transformed into a spirit treasure, having nurtured a spirit embryo!</p><p>‘Hum! Hum!’</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword, as if sensing its master's thoughts, emitted a sharp sword cry, full of spirit.</p><p>The spirit sword burst forth with killing intent; its blade would follow its master's will, cutting down all enemies!</p><p>“Caw! Caw!”</p><p>Accompanying the sword cry was a strange bird call.</p><p>A ring of fire danced around the Grey Warbler Sword—it was the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird, seemingly suppressed for too long, lacked any saintly demeanor; its call was full of excitement, urging Qin Sang:  "Quick! Quick! Quick! This Vermilion Bird can't wait! The first merit is mine!"</p><p>This foolish bird was indeed audacious, seemingly hoping for chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird knew what they were about to do, yet showed no fear or worry.</p><p>The Dharma body flicked its sleeve, putting away the Grey Warbler Sword and the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>Simultaneously, a green light appeared behind Qin Sang's original body. The light was pure, accompanied by a phoenix cry, summoning the Azure Dragon Dharma form!</p><p>The Azure Dragon spread its wings, its wings obscuring the sky.</p><p>The Azure Dragon Dharma form stretched its body, flew high into the air, and plunged down, transforming into a green light that poured into Qin Sang from the top of his head.</p><p>The Dharma form and physical body merged, and Qin Sang's aura instantly changed.</p><p>At the same time, five-colored light flashed, and Xiao Wu appeared.</p><p>Returning to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have forgotten the mundane world, shedding her worldly dust.</p><p>She still had her eyes closed, standing beside Qin Sang, serene and innocent.</p><p>The original body took Xiao Wu's small hand, nodded to the Dharma body, and headed northeast.</p><p>…</p><p>Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou left the mountain gate, traveling west alone.</p><p>His escape technique was quite unique. He pointed his purple bamboo staff forward; the tip touched the void, and purple light burst forth.</p><p>The purple light was like lightning, instantly traversing mountain ranges. When the purple light's power waned, Gu Yun Sou would reappear within it.</p><p>The purple electricity continuously leaped, gradually reaching the edge of Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou held his staff in one hand and used the other to perform calculations, his expression not relaxed.</p><p>"That corpse demon, I don't know if its supernatural powers have been perfected. If so, it will be difficult to deal with…"</p><p>While pondering, Gu Yun Sou suddenly felt something, his expression changing drastically. He heavily tapped the void with his purple bamboo staff, stopping the purple electricity.</p><p>In front of him, on a mountaintop, stood a strange Daoist, looking back with his hands behind his back.</p><p>"Which Daoist friend, why are you obstructing this old man!"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou shouted sternly, not making a rash move.</p><p>He sensed the aura of a Dharma form from Qin Sang.</p><p>Although some exceptionally gifted demon cultivators could comprehend Dharma forms at the transformation god stage, they could never possess such powerful and intense Dharma form energy!</p><p>Something unusual must be afoot.</p><p>This Daoist was a stranger to him, yet he blocked his path at this time. Was he a helper summoned by the corpse demon?</p><p>"This Daoist is Qingfeng. I have long admired Daoist friend Gu Yun Sou's reputation and have come to pay my respects."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from afar, stepping aside to reveal what was behind him: a stone table carved into a chessboard, two stone stools, and black and white chess pieces.</p><p>The chessboard and pieces were carved from ordinary stone, using local materials.</p><p>"I hear that Daoist friend is skilled in chess. I would like to invite you to a game. What do you think?" Qin Sang invited with a gesture.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou narrowed his eyes, observing Qin Sang for a moment, then looked at the chessboard, seemingly thinking.</p><p>After a while, he actually flew forward, landing beside the chessboard, lightly tapping the ground with his purple bamboo staff.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his Daoist robe, sat down, and instructed, "Xiao Wu, serve tea!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Xiao Wu walked up with a tea tray.</p><p>Like a well-behaved young Daoist boy, she knelt down neatly beside him, arranging the teapot and teacups, meticulously preparing tea.</p>
