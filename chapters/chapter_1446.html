<h1></h1><p>The ice box rested in his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang, following his previous experience, attempted to break the seal.</p><p>Within the cave dwelling, flashes of pale light erupted from time to time, an encroaching chill  that condensed into a layer of frost on the walls.</p><p>The ice box vibrated frequently, yet there was no sign of it opening.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang ceased his actions, his brow furrowed as he gazed at the ice box.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even with his transformed divine sense, he remained helpless against the seal on the ice box. Just now, he had tried every method he could think of.</p><p>Holding the ice box in his hand, Qin Sang sat still, his gaze distant, as if contemplating something.</p><p>His divine sense was no less powerful than that of a Great cultivator.</p><p>If he couldn't open the ice box with this much power, and still had no clue, there were only two possibilities: either his divine sense was still not strong enough, or some specific requirement had to be met.</p><p>If even a Great cultivator couldn't open it, then in the foreseeable future, Qin Sang would likely have to keep the ice box in the Thousand Jun Ring, treating it as if it didn't exist.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang was lost in thought, associating it with the white-clothed man who stole the ice box, and associating it with the Myriad Demons Assembly .</p><p>As expected, he would personally attend.</p><p>"Old Demon Hun killed so many Nascent Soul cultivators from the Xuan Tian Palace, incurring a mortal feud. Will the Xuan Tian Palace still participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly? As the largest event in the North Sea, the Myriad Demons Assembly is the largest trade fair among Nascent Souls. If the white-clothed man is alive, he might be lurking on Hun Demon Island. If the Xuan Tian Palace wants to find the traitor and retrieve the ice box, they should send people to investigate secretly. I wonder if they have a way to sense the ice box. Before I go to Hun Demon Island, should I leave the ice box in the cave dwelling?"</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought when, suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck him.</p><p>He decided to do the opposite, take the ice box to Hun Demon Island, and test the Xuan Tian Palace!</p><p>This Myriad Demons Assembly was the best opportunity.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace had a feud with Old Demon Hun, entering the demon path's heartland ; they certainly wouldn't dare to act recklessly on Hun Demon Island.</p><p>Furthermore, Mother Ghost had said that the state of the Xuan Tian Palace Lord was not right; he was probably healing. With the Xuan Tian Palace Lord unable to act, it would be difficult for others to restrain Qin Sang.</p><p>There were only two possible outcomes.</p><p>If he was not discovered, it would mean that the Xuan Tian Palace had no way to sense the location of the ice box, or that Qin Sang's Demon Fire Seal could block the Xuan Tian Palace's detection.</p><p>Then there would be no further worries.</p><p>Leaving the ice box behind for research, or using it for other purposes, could be considered slowly.</p><p>If the Xuan Tian Palace locked onto Qin Sang, it would mean the Demon Fire Seal was ineffective.</p><p>He had no better way to hide the ice box anyway.</p><p>Even if he could hide it for a while, as long as the Xuan Tian Palace searched persistently, with their strength and vast influence, they would eventually lock onto him. Bringing it back to the North Chen Region wouldn't be safe either; when the Xuan Tian Palace Lord recovered and came knocking, crossing the storm belt, the trouble would be even greater.</p><p>It would be unwise to make enemies of the North Sea's top power for an ice box that couldn't be opened.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't even know what was inside the ice box. It was likely a treasure related to the ice path, which might not be useful to him.</p><p>Since that was the case, it would be better to negotiate a deal with the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang didn't steal the ice box. As long as he expressed this intention, the Xuan Tian Palace would have no reason to offend a top expert; they would definitely be eager to cooperate.</p><p>Taking advantage of the Xuan Tian Palace Lord's weakness, Qin Sang could extract more benefits.</p><p>*Ding! Ding!*</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the ice box gently with his finger, carefully considering the matter. What could he obtain from the Xuan Tian Palace?</p><p>First, without a doubt, was the sea chart to the Central Province.</p><p>Thinking of the sea chart, Qin Sang was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>The sea chart was not a shameful treasure. With Mother Ghost's strength, if she wanted the sea chart, she could directly ask for a look; the Xuan Tian Palace had no need to hide it at all.</p><p>Could it be that Mother Ghost's goal was not just this?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly, thinking the possibility was high. It was a pity that Tan Hao knew so little about Mother Ghost, otherwise, he could make requests based on that.</p><p>Second, the white-clothed man's cultivation art.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the white-clothed man was a rare spirit cultivator and was very interested in this type of art.</p><p>Third, the Xuan Tian Palace had a long history, dominating a region. The sect must have treasured countless scriptures, perhaps including secret techniques for breaking through to the late stage of the Nascent Soul realm or even the Deity Transformation realm.</p><p>It depended on how valuable the ice box was, and how much he could exchange for it.</p><p>At the very least, he wanted some spiritual pills and magical artifacts; the Xuan Tian Palace could definitely provide them.</p><p>Rather than risk making countless enemies, holding onto an ice box that he didn't know when he could open, it was better to exchange it for things that could help him cultivate.</p><p>For cultivators, the Great Dao was fundamental!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was weighing the pros and cons, he sensed that the cave dwelling's restrictions had been triggered. Tan Hao had returned.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the ice box and took out the Solar Divine Tree to take a look. He discovered that the fire aura on the divine tree was gradually turning dark red. Once it condensed into a Solar Divine Bird, it could be used by him.</p><p>He tried to subdue the Southern Bright Separation Fire  with the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, but as expected, the result was still failure.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his magical artifacts, got up, and walked out of the cave dwelling, calling out to Tan Hao.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you've finally come out of seclusion."</p><p>Tan Hao breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Myriad Demons Assembly was approaching, and he was worried that Qin Sang would miss it, but he didn't dare disturb his seclusion. He was extremely anxious.</p><p>"Recently, the Myriad Demons Assembly has been the talk of the town. Many fellow cultivators have already set off. How have you considered it, Brother Qin?"</p><p>"No rush."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, "Did you find any news?"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, having already recorded the information he had found and handing Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang delved his divine sense into it, quickly scanning over the less important details, focusing on the news of Huang Longshi's Palace's emergence.</p><p>Below the Nascent Soul realm, Tan Hao had few opponents.</p><p>It was impossible to learn all the secrets, but he could find out sixty to seventy percent of them.</p><p>The matter was widely circulated.</p><p>Not only because Huang Longshi's Palace had appeared in the world, but also because it was related to the grudges between the North Sea's top sect and the Boundless Sea's top expert.</p><p>Huang Longshi's Palace emerged in a sea area in the eastern part of the Boundless Sea. Many people had suspected it before and searched there countless times, but to no avail.</p><p>Old Demon Hun had likely been closely monitoring the area, so he noticed the signs as soon as they appeared.</p><p>The four Xuan Tian Palace Nascent Soul cultivators who discovered Huang Longshi's Palace, including an Elder, were brutally murdered by Old Demon Hun while trying to seize the treasure. Including Qi Wang and the other two, Old Demon Hun had massacred several Nascent Soul cultivators in a short period of time.</p><p>There were also other rumors that several other demons participated in the massacre.</p><p>Old Demon Hun and the others, disregarding offending the Xuan Tian Palace, must have obtained great benefits.</p><p>The Cold Bone Devil Hand on the list likely came from Huang Longshi's Palace.</p><p>Huang Longshi once discovered the secret realm of the ancient demonic sect Cold Bone Path, obtaining the Cold Bone Path's inheritance, which was no secret in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>"It is said that there are even more treasures of the Cold Bone Path at the Myriad Demons Assembly. Why is that old demon in such a hurry to sell them? Is he really eager to exchange them for something? Tan Hao can't find out these things; True Person Yinquan should know some of it. I happen to have something to ask him."</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, pondered for a moment, and took Tan Hao away from the cave dwelling.</p><p>After sending Tan Hao to a safe place near Hun Demon Island, Qin Sang agreed on a way to contact him, and then changed direction, heading to Bright Pearl Island alone.</p>
