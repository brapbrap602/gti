<h1>Chapter 1265: Jade Bones, Brocade Skin</h1><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>*Crash…*</p><p>Under attack, the cage shook, its black chains swaying, runes flashing incessantly.</p><p>Jingyu sensed the danger and quickly summoned her thunder bead, creating a protective barrier.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>Dozens of crimson lightning bolts shot out, striking the barrier.</p><p>The thunder bead trembled, but quickly stabilized, firmly blocking the crimson lightning.</p><p>After testing the defenses, a hint of joy flashed in Jingyu's eyes.  However, she didn't rush in. Instead, she attacked the seal while carefully observing the skeleton within the cage.</p><p>The skeleton was humanoid, its face resembling that of a human, but its bone structure was significantly larger than a normal person's.  It was unclear whether it belonged to an ancient race similar to humans, or if it had cultivated some unique technique.</p><p>The blood pool bottom held more than just this skeleton; several similar cages were present.</p><p>The cage at the center of the blood pool held the strongest seal.  This was where the ancient cultivator Ye Laomo and Qing Jun sought to find.</p><p>The ancient cultivator had survived to this day, imprisoned in the blood pool with his skeletal remains.  His cultivation in life was likely comparable to Ye Laomo's.</p><p>This was the core of the Blood Prison, protected by layers of defense: the Black Tower Formation outside and the blood pool cages within, yet this wasn't enough—he was also bound by shackles.</p><p>Those corpse flowers and blood ambers, rooted in the cracks of the bones, drew sustenance from the ancient corpse, their beauty both captivating and tragic, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Now that the corpse had become a skeleton, the corpse flowers had transformed into blood ambers.</p><p>The seal was weakest where the cage was damaged. Jingyu successfully broke the seal, darted into the cage, and the corpse flowers and blood ambers were within her grasp.</p><p>Looking at the lifeless skeleton, Jingyu hesitated slightly and created another illusionary projection with her thunder bead.</p><p>The illusionary projection flew to the skull, extending a claw towards a blood amber on the skull.</p><p>The moment the projection touched the blood amber, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Without warning, the skeleton emitted a thick crimson aura, followed by countless crimson threads.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The illusionary projection was powerless to resist.  The threads pierced it, entangled it, and shattered it instantly.</p><p>The threads, seemingly sentient, relentlessly followed the connection between the illusion and its source, and shot towards Jingyu.</p><p>The skeleton's transformation was incredibly fast.</p><p>The threads reached Jingyu in an instant.</p><p>Jingyu was startled. She had meticulously examined the area several times and hadn't noticed anything unusual.  Without time to think, she quickly activated her thunder bead, her entire body flashing with thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The threads were stopped by the thunder bead and the thunder emanating from Jingyu, but they clung to her like a tenacious parasite, spreading and forming a blood cocoon around her.</p><p>Jingyu trembled, her gaze fixed on the source of the threads. She noticed the skeleton had turned into a blood-bone, but other than releasing the threads, it didn't move.</p><p>Seeing this, she was surprised. It didn't seem to be a corpse's reanimation.</p><p>While resisting the threads' intrusion, she carefully examined the blood-bone and finally noticed runes faintly emerging within it; the runes were the source of the threads.</p><p>"Is it a curse left by the blood-bone before death, born of resentment, to kill anyone who touches it? Or is it a trap set by the ancient cultivator?"</p><p>Jingyu pondered silently.</p><p>She had been lured to the blood pool's surface by the ancient cultivator once, luckily escaping his scheme without touching the blood-bone.</p><p>"There's no sign of external manipulation," she mused. "If it's a trap set by the ancient cultivator, then that person must be in dire straits, too weak to control the threads. Otherwise, I'd be in serious trouble. With so many people here, he hasn't made a move, which speaks volumes."</p><p>Since it wasn't a corpse reanimation, she felt relieved.</p><p>While the threads were strange, they were ownerless.  With some effort, she should be able to find a way to break free, though it would take some time.</p><p>With that in mind, Jingyu attacked the threads with all her might.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Qing Jun, tracking Ye Laomo, had also reached the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>The scene before him was similar to what Jingyu had seen.</p><p>Countless black chains extended from all directions, converging on a massive cage, though every pillar of this cage was intact.</p><p>Within the cage, a figure sat cross-legged.</p><p>Qing Jun stared, momentarily stunned by the sight of the prisoner.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the cage, his face directly facing her.  He resembled a skeleton, his flesh completely gone, leaving only bone and skin.  A thin, almost transparent layer of skin clung to the bone structure like tightly stretched silk, smooth and fine.  Every trace of muscle, organ, and blood vessel had vanished, leaving a shriveled body indistinguishable from a skeleton.</p><p>His skull was the same; his eye sockets were deep, with what seemed to be a faint inner glow in the empty sockets. His teeth, however, were intact, clearly visible through the skin, his expression seeming to be a mixture of a smile and sneer.</p><p>Strangely, his bones were crimson, like blood, not the usual stark white.  They shone with a jade-like luster – they were jade bones! He looked less like a man and more like a statue crafted from jade and silk.</p><p>A chill ran down Qing Jun's spine at the bizarre sight, filling her with apprehension towards the jade bones.  Jing Yu had insisted this person was alive, wreaking havoc, yet now the jade skeleton remained motionless, showing no signs of life. Had he transformed himself into this unnatural state to survive?</p><p>At that moment, Ye Laomo, who had arrived earlier, stood before the cage, examining the jade skeleton. Ye Laomo's pupils and sclera were gone, leaving only black eyes fixed on the bones.</p><p>Sensing Qing Jun's presence, Ye Laomo turned, his eyes returning to normal.  He said calmly, "You intend to stop me?"</p><p>Qing Jun raised a hand, and the Five Directions Pagoda spun, gently settling in her palm. "We are enemies, not friends.  There's no need for questions.  Unless you vow to withdraw your forces, end this conflict, and surrender the jade bones and all you know to be jointly controlled by the Three Realms."</p><p>Ye Laomo scoffed, remaining silent.  With a sweep of his sleeve, a beam of light shot out, containing a crystal-clear arrowhead, seemingly forged from ice.</p><p>The arrowhead emitted an intense chill; the surrounding blood froze, and the black chains were quickly coated in frost that spread towards the cage.</p><p>With a *crack*, the arrowhead shattered, releasing several white shadows that lunged at the cage, fiercely exhaling freezing air.  The ice on the cage grew thicker, cracking ominously.</p><p>The seal seemed to have met its match; the runes were frozen, unable to retaliate, their glow fading. Ye Laomo clearly had planned this, preparing something to counter the seal.</p><p>Qing Jun frowned.  The cage was seamless, the seal intact, making it difficult to determine whether the jade bones were feigning death or truly extinguished, trapped by the seal.</p><p>Did Ye Laomo not worry that once the seal was broken, the jade bones would escape while they fought?</p>
