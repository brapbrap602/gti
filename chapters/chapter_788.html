<h1>Chapter 780: Ascending the Tower</h1><p>Pure, unadulterated killing intent.</p><p>Somehow, ancient cultivators had sealed this sword intent within the ancient hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was awestruck, gazing at the hall, lost in thought.</p><p>He knew the Seven Kills Hall and the Purple Star Palace were deeply connected, but he hadn't expected to find such sword intent within the Celestial Tower, so closely related to the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Scripture*.</p><p>Could the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Scripture* be a cultivation technique created by the ancient cultivators of the Seven Kills Hall?</p><p>The first five levels of the technique had ended up in the Purple Star Palace.</p><p>Could the complete technique be hidden within the Seven Kills Hall?</p><p>The creator of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Scripture* must have been an extremely powerful cultivator.  The technique couldn't possibly stop at the Golden Core stage; there had to be more.</p><p>The ancient teleportation formation, the cultivation technique…</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had a new goal.</p><p>The two killing talismans left by Senior Qing Zhu would only last him until the late stage of Core Formation. If he could find the complete technique, he wouldn't have to place all his hopes on them.</p><p>Besides, Senior Qing Zhu had been missing for years without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang had not only searched himself but also asked Elder Zou and others for help, yet he hadn't even heard a single rumor.</p><p>With Senior Qing Zhu's talent and cultivation, it was impossible for him to travel without leaving any trace. Qin Sang suspected something had happened to him.</p><p>The cultivation world was unpredictable; anything could happen.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, what are you looking at?"</p><p>The old woman looked at Qin Sang curiously. "Did you find something unusual?"</p><p>Qin Sang came back to his senses and shook his head. "No, I was just observing the unique restrictions on the teleportation hall.  Unfortunately, the ancient restrictions are too profound; my abilities are too meager to comprehend them."</p><p>"Don't be discouraged, Fellow Daoist Qin. If the restrictions here were so easy to understand, the secrets of the Celestial Tower would have been uncovered long ago. I've heard that even Nascent Soul ancestors can only ascend one level at a time according to the rules here.  Since there's nothing unusual, let's quickly enter the teleportation hall. We've already waited outside for a while; it's best to proceed as soon as possible…" the old woman reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, putting aside his thoughts.  The five of them landed on the stone steps in front of the teleportation hall.</p><p>As they approached the hall, a wave of icy coldness washed over them, enveloped by an aura of death and decay. The doors of the teleportation hall were tightly shut, silent within.</p><p>The cultivators who entered before them had already gone through the hall, transported to higher levels.</p><p>They paused briefly, then quickly walked forward.</p><p>The teleportation hall had eight entrances, distributed on each side of the hall.  It was said that each entrance led to the teleportation formation, but the puppets behind each door would be different.</p><p>There was no need for such caution on the first level.</p><p>They pushed open the door in front of them and entered.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The door closed automatically with a thud.</p><p>Before them was a long, wide corridor, stretching straight ahead. The walls were made of blue bricks, bare of any decoration.</p><p>They exchanged glances and stepped inside.</p><p>As they proceeded, blue light flickered on the walls, and puppets of all shapes and sizes emerged, a truly bizarre spectacle.</p><p>The deeper they went into the corridor, the more puppets attacked them.</p><p>Unfortunately, these puppets were too weak to even slow them down. They sped through the corridor, leaving behind broken puppets that dissolved into the blue stone.</p><p>Further ahead, they encountered an intersection.</p><p>It was like a maze.</p><p>Finding the ancient teleportation formation wasn't difficult, but if one's cultivation was insufficient, it would be hard to say how long they could last under the relentless attacks of so many puppets.  Moreover, the maze changed constantly; it was different every time, so memorizing the route was useless.</p><p>They agreed on a signal and split up to search the maze, quickly locating the teleportation formation.</p><p>Soon, they stopped.  A three-foot-high stone platform appeared before them, with the teleportation formation glowing faintly on top.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>The Di surname man stepped onto the platform first, followed by the others.  With a flash of light, they were teleported away.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang gazed intently at the corridor behind him, his eyes deep in thought.</p><p>After they split up at the intersection, he had searched everywhere, even using his Ebony Wood Sword and activating the killing talismans on his spirit sword, but he sensed nothing.</p><p>"Could the secret of the technique be on a higher level?"</p><p>With this question in mind, Qin Sang entered the second level.</p><p>The second level was similar to the first.</p><p>They cooperated closely and efficiently, quickly reaching the third level and finding the teleportation formation in its hall.</p><p>They focused on their journey, not bothering to open any ancient halls or secret chambers they encountered along the way.</p><p>Upon reaching the fourth level, the puppets were indeed stronger.  Early Core Formation cultivators would have to fight and retreat if surrounded here.</p><p>They formed a defensive formation, each with their assigned role.</p><p>The group of five flew through the darkness.</p><p>A bronze mirror floated above their heads, and a small silver shield revolved around them. The shield belonged to the Wu surname man.  These two magical treasures served as their defense.</p><p>However, for now, the old woman alone was enough to handle the puppets.</p><p>The Yin surname woman was protected in the center, responsible for detecting the puppets' movements and weaknesses.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded his Ebony Wood Sword, destroying over a dozen puppets shortly after entering the fourth level.</p><p>No one noticed the strange look in Qin Sang's eyes, sometimes fixed on his spirit sword, sometimes on the distant blue light.</p><p>Before, he could effortlessly destroy the puppets without needing to find their weaknesses. Now it was different. The puppets here were incredibly durable, not easily destroyed.</p><p>As a result, Qin Sang gradually noticed something peculiar.</p><p>He realized the puppets' weaknesses weren't random.  The entire process of engaging with them, defending against their attacks, and exploiting their weaknesses to counterattack provided excellent swordsmanship training, helpful for comprehending the Dao of the Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had already independently grasped Sword Qi Thunderclap; he was certain this feeling wasn't an illusion!</p><p>Since he was working with four others, his experience wasn't as pronounced.</p><p>He imagined that if he were to challenge the tower alone, the feeling would be much stronger while battling the puppets.</p><p>This place was not only a trial ground but also a treasure trove for sword cultivators.  If he could continuously train in the Celestial Tower, his swordsmanship would undoubtedly advance by leaps and bounds, and grasping Sword Light Splitting would be just around the corner.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Seven Kills Hall was open for too short a time.  In such a short period, significant gains were impossible, and no one would waste precious time here.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>The others, unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, focused on their journey, searching for the teleportation hall.</p><p>Before long, they successfully located it.</p><p>The fourth level's teleportation hall was noticeably more dilapidated, with two of its doors destroyed.  And that wasn't the worst of it.  It was said that on the sixth level, the teleportation hall vanished entirely, leaving only a lone teleportation formation floating in the void.</p><p>This was a good thing for them, as they wouldn't have to face the onslaught of puppets.</p>
