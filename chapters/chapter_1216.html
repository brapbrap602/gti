<h1>Chapter 1208: The Evil Spirit</h1><p>Two figures stood beside the Serpent King.  One was a human cultivator, elegant and refined, the other a cold lizard that had already taken on its demon form.  A mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, and two transformed great demons.  The cold lizard was the weakest of the three, only in the early stages of transformation.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang knew these two were the helpers the Serpent King had mentioned. The human cultivator’s surname was Lu, and the cold lizard likely discovered the great demon's lair.  The three of them were under fierce attack, severely outnumbered, and struggling to escape. The cold lizard had even been forced to reveal its true form.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He stopped in the distance to observe, quickly turning his attention to their opponents.  Two people and a strange entity were involved in the attack.  The two were undoubtedly Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyss of Sin.  While Qin Sang hadn't seen them personally, he recognized them from their profiles: one a black-robed cultivator surnamed Ma, the other an elderly grey-robed cultivator known as Jiang Chenzi, both renowned Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Each wielded a strange banner.  Despite being Yuan Ying cultivators, they were only in the early stages and outnumbered.  The Serpent King's side should have been significantly stronger, yet they were trapped.  However, their real opponent wasn't the two cultivators, but the strange entity.</p><p>Qin Sang found it strange because he had never seen anything like it before. It appeared as a gigantic azure serpent, its body immense, its tail coiled, its upper body upright, towering a hundred zhang high. Yet its form was as ethereal as a spirit, a serpentine entity.  Compared to it, even the Serpent King, a fellow serpent demon, looked like an ant.</p><p>Neither human nor demon, the serpent spirit's eyes shone like stars, yet they held intense malice, rage, and madness—a cauldron of negative emotions, devoid of reason.  It wasn't alive, but more like an evil spirit, driven only by slaughter and destruction.</p><p>Even from a distance, Qin Sang felt a chill at the serpent spirit's gaze. He couldn’t imagine how such a being, filled with hatred for all things, could have come to be. He wondered what the Serpent King and his allies had done to provoke it.  The spirit focused solely on them, ignoring the two from the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>"Blood Lake!"</p><p>The fat chicken in the Hun Yuan Tong Xin ring shrieked, as if witnessing something unbelievable.  Qin Sang's gaze shifted. He noticed boundless dark clouds splitting apart behind the battlefield, letting through thick blood-red light that sent chills down his spine.</p><p>The source of the light was a vast lake, its waters a disturbing shade of blood.  The lake was calm, undisturbed.  He wondered if the evil spirit originated from it.</p><p>The chicken fell silent.  Qin Sang, too preoccupied to pay it mind, continued to watch the battlefield, his eyes flickering. He located the treasure that attracted the Fire Jade Centipede: a human-head-sized ball of white metal, resembling white copper, but seemingly fluid, not solid.</p><p>Its radiant white light blazed like the sun, too intense to look at directly.  Qin Sang had never seen such a material before. The centipede's reaction, and the white copper's properties, suggested it was extraordinary!  But the ball of white copper was inside the evil spirit!</p><p>Next to it were two other items: a broken stone axe and a blood jade, both clearly significant, likely as valuable as the white copper. To obtain them, he'd have to attack the evil spirit—plunder its very heart.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The evil spirit, consumed by hatred for the Serpent King and his allies, enraged by its inability to quickly kill them, unleashed an earth-shattering roar of fury.  It opened its maw, and a ball of azure light, brimming with destructive energy, shot forth like lightning.</p><p>The Serpent King and his allies' faces fell. The Serpent King himself was relatively unscathed, though his breath was ragged. The cultivator Lu was bleeding from his seven orifices, too injured to wipe the blood from his face. The cold lizard, a huge lizard capable of manipulating cold energy, was dwarfed by the serpent spirit and, being the weakest, could only defend itself, despite continuously emitting icy blasts.</p><p>As the azure light approached, they tried to dodge. The two Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyss of Sin watched coldly and simultaneously activated their banners.  Runes flared on the banners, and a vortex appeared on the surface of each, emitting two streams of blood-red light that converged in mid-air, forming a torrent that slammed into the Serpent King’s group, restricting their movement.  The Yuan Ying cultivators' control was precise; the torrent targeted only the Serpent King’s group, avoiding the evil spirit. At first glance, it looked as though the evil spirit was actually an ally of the two Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>In truth, the vengeful spirit had been fighting on their side all along.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Lu, we of the Abyssal Mire did not wish to be enemies. Since you’ve all stumbled into the Mire and fallen into our trap, you can’t blame us for being ruthless!”  Jiang Chenzi said coldly.</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Ma, clad in black robes, chuckled strangely. “Heh heh, you outsiders daring to trespass into the Mire are simply courting death! This serpent spirit, before its death, was tortured for who knows how long, its sanity destroyed, leaving only resentment and obsession, transforming it into a pure vengeful spirit. You provoked it, ensuring a fight to the death. Even we had to carefully plan and call for help before daring to confront the spirit. It’s just bad luck for the three of you. Had you not encountered the vengeful spirit, perhaps you could have truly stolen the treasure undetected.”</p><p>They attacked, their tone laced with mocking ridicule, their expressions unusually relaxed.</p><p>After all, the vengeful spirit wouldn’t attack them. The two of them didn’t need to directly confront the Serpent King's group. They just needed to seize the opportunity to strike, cutting off the Serpent King's escape route, preventing their retreat.</p><p>Then, at their leisure, they would wait for the vengeful spirit to eliminate the Serpent King’s group.  They would easily reap the benefits, and then deal with the weakened vengeful spirit, seizing the treasure within its body.</p><p>Come to think of it, they should really thank the Serpent King’s group; not only did they deliver the treasure, but they also bore the brunt of the vengeful spirit’s wrath.</p><p>Crisis descended.  Faced with the mockery, the Serpent King and his companions couldn't retort, focusing intently on the vengeful spirit's movements, their minds racing, desperately searching for a way to escape.</p><p>“Han Li!”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu bellowed.</p><p>Han Li opened its mouth, spitting out the snow pearl.</p><p>Instantly, a chill filled the air.  Goose-sized snowflakes appeared around the snow pearl, forming a snowy expanse.  Almost simultaneously, the cultivator surnamed Lu made his move. He held a thumb-sized gourd, tilting it slightly.  Boundless river water poured forth.</p><p>The river water flowed into the snowfield, instantly freezing into thick ice, forming a huge ice sphere around the snow pearl.  The deep blue light within the ice sphere was profound and mysterious, the intense chill seeming to freeze the very soul.</p><p>A Yuan Ying Grandmaster and a transformed great demon, using this method, combined their powers.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The snow pearl, still controlled by Han Li, shot straight towards the green light.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu coughed violently a few times, a flush appearing on his face. This combined attack with Han Li had aggravated his injuries.</p>
