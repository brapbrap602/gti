<h1>Chapter 1221: Taking Shape</h1><p>Chapter 1221: Taking Shape</p><p>“Friend Daoist, you are right.  Zui Yuan’s plan is exposed, and they will expect a counterattack.  Ye Lao Mo wouldn’t dare take all his forces.  We’ll split into two groups. Half will enter Blood Lake, enough to hold our own. The other half will defend Skywalk Plateau.”</p><p>True One Daoist paused slightly, swirling his whisk, and smiled gently.  “I know Blood Lake far less well than you all.  I’ll stay here to guard against Zui Yuan’s main force, and try to probe and counterattack.  Blood Lake is in your capable hands.”</p><p>Zui Yuan has been meticulously planning this; Blood Lake must hold something of great value.</p><p>But it also represents enormous risk.</p><p>With Zui Yuan’s army at the gates, the Skywalk Alliance is the first to bear the brunt; unlike the Little Cold Region, we have no room for maneuver.</p><p>True One Daoist only wishes to protect the Skywalk Alliance in his lifetime, and isn’t concerned with the treasures within Blood Lake, so he readily agreed.</p><p>Missing this chance for treasure, two armored generals showed some displeasure, but they all followed True One Daoist without question, and wouldn’t contradict him in front of others.</p><p>Lord Tongyou also hadn’t expected True One Daoist’s lack of interest, and replied with a bow.  “Daoist, rest assured, we will not disappoint you, and will do our utmost to foil Ye Lao Mo’s schemes.”</p><p>However, there were two Demon Kings within Ice Crystal Palace who weren’t from the Little Cold Region.</p><p>Qing Jun spoke opportunely, “It is thanks to the two Daoists that we were able to uncover Ye Lao Mo’s plot.  Would the two of you, or any other Demon Kings, be willing to join us in confronting Zui Yuan and avenge the attack by Ye Lao Mo?”</p><p>Lord Tongyou and the others had no objections; more hands meant a better chance of success.</p><p>In truth, they weren't opposed to others sharing the spoils.</p><p>Whether they could defeat Ye Lao Mo and seize the treasure was far from certain.</p><p>Squabbling over treasures that didn't even belong to them yet would be foolish.</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head and refused immediately.  “My injuries aren't healed, and I need to return to the mountains to recuperate. I dare not risk another dangerous mission until I am recovered, lest I meet my end. However, I can ask Yu Wang for his opinion.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t give a direct answer.  “I almost lost my life at Ye Lao Mo’s hands. If there’s a chance for revenge, I would gladly take it. However, Daoist Tongyou mentioned that Blood Lake won’t open for some time; we can decide then.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained tight-lipped about the Thunder Hawk Demon King being trapped in Blood Lake, not mentioning a word.</p><p>Even if the Thunder Hawk Demon King was still alive, his situation would not be optimistic.</p><p>Knowing there was a Demon King trapped there for two hundred years, nearing the end of his life, would make anyone’s heart race. It wouldn’t be a rescue, but an assassination using another’s hand.</p><p>…</p><p>The gathering of leaders from the two regions wasn't just for this matter.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Serpent King tactfully took their leave.</p><p>“I’ve asked Yu Wang; he isn’t interested in Blood Lake. It’s a good chance for the human cultivators to test Ye Lao Mo’s strength. The human race is cunning. Those not of our kind surely have ulterior motives. If you go to Blood Lake, be careful and avoid being tricked.”</p><p>The Serpent King warned Qin Sang out of good will.</p><p>After sharing hardships, he considered Qin Sang a close friend.</p><p>Qin Sang felt embarrassed, wondering if the Serpent King would turn on him when he discovered his true identity.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon after returning to Three Fold Pass, his senior sister sent a message, informing him of the discussions in Ice Crystal Palace.  Qin Sang glanced at it, seeing that it didn't concern him, and tossed it aside.</p><p>After that, he remained in Three Fold Pass.</p><p>Zui Yuan continued their slow, deliberate deployment, and the two sides fought back and forth.</p><p>It was said that other battlefields were extremely intense, but at Three Fold Pass, both sides seemed to have an unspoken agreement to take it easy, sending disciples to fight a short, ceremonial battle before withdrawing.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin both joked that they were benefiting from the Moonlight Demon King’s presence. They even had the resources to support other areas.</p><p>This situation allowed the younger generation to gain experience.</p><p>The demons of Thousand Mountain Bamboo Forest took turns coming to Three Fold Pass for training.  Since they had their masters to protect them, as long as they weren't too reckless, their lives were largely safe, and they all eagerly signed up.</p><p>The Serpent King even sent his young demons from his 化龙山 (Hua Long Mountain –  I avoided a direct translation that might be confusing) to Three Fold Pass, asking Qin Sang to look after them.</p><p>The ones making the most progress were undoubtedly Fatty Chicken and Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Fatty Chicken had completely stabilized his cultivation. His innate thunder control ability, combined with his mother’s legacy treasures, made him an unmatched opponent at his level; his main task was looking after the young demons.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, having experienced the highs and lows of his master's death, and receiving personal guidance from Qin Sang, found his breakthrough in battle, and returned to his cave for seclusion to advance to a higher realm.</p><p>Tan Yi En, having found assurance that her father might still be alive, dedicated herself to preparing to break through to the Golden Core stage.</p><p>After solidifying her realm, Bai Han Qiu also actively joined the battlefield training.</p><p>Mei Gu and the other disciples from Demon Flame Sect, under Qing Jun’s care, also made their own progress.</p><p>Bai He and his beloved wife are inseparable, completely absorbed in their blissful life, their pre-marriage anxieties and sorrows a distant memory.  Even Pang Ji is envious of their happiness.</p><p>Two of Yun Youzi's most trusted advisors, Lao Liu Shu and Lao Ma Hou, are taking turns searching overseas for suitable caves. They've found a few locations, but none are quite satisfactory.</p><p>Qin Sang is observing the various beasts, considering who to bestow the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* cultivation technique upon. He favors the white cat.  Its natural talent is evident—otherwise, Yun Youzi wouldn't have chosen it as a disciple.  Furthermore, the white cat is exceptionally diligent and devoted to its path, reminding Qin Sang of himself.</p><p>Passing down *Tian Yao Lian Xing* serves a dual purpose: establishing his own lineage within the demon world and strengthening the Qian Shan Zhu Hai region with this powerful technique, fulfilling Yun Youzi's expectations.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang decides against sharing the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* technique, and will not leave it to the Qing Yang Temple in the future.  Unlike *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, this technique is intrinsically linked to the Sha Jian artifact.</p><p>He doesn't know how common spirit-possessed treasures were in ancient times, but their value is undoubtedly immense.  If word were to get out that both techniques resided at the Qing Yang Temple, it would essentially announce the existence of the two Sha Jian fragments in his possession.</p><p>And this is not entirely improbable. Bai's escape from Yuan Xu, the mysterious individual, and the lingering consciousness of the Qingluan on the stone tablet all point to the fact that surviving ancient cultivators are not unique, but rather, well-hidden.  Among them, there are undoubtedly those who would recognize the significance of what he possesses.</p><p>He doesn't want to attract a deadly calamity.</p><p>These are the nascent forces under Qin Sang's command, slowly growing stronger.  Qin Sang remains within the Han Ling Great Array's quiet chamber, focusing on cultivation—the foundation of all strength—and continuing to study the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>In Yuan Xu, the Seven Souls Killing Array proved its worth, enabling him to seize a treasure from a malevolent spirit.  However, while using the array against opponents, Qin Sang discovered previously unnoticed flaws and shortcomings; it has yet to unleash its true power!</p><p>He regrets the lack of a chance to fight Ye Lao Mo in a full-fledged battle; it would have provided invaluable experience.  Knowing that mastery cannot be achieved overnight, he patiently continues his practice.</p><p>Over a year passes unnoticed.  One day, Qin Sang secretly leaves San Die Guan and travels to Mo Yan Men.  Three days later, the tribute offerings to the Qing Yang Demon Sect, under the protection of Qing Yang Demon Sect's influence,  will be delivered on this day.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Stunned.  Just when things calmed down, the outbreak flared up again.</p>
