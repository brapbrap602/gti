<h1>Chapter 1774: Pursuit</h1><p>Chapter 1774: Pursuit</p><p>“He’s not dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed Elder Mou being overwhelmed, and yet here he was, still alive, escaping the attack at Yitian Peak, a major thorn in her side.  So many top experts were present, and none of them noticed Elder Mou's subtle movements, allowing him to slip away.</p><p>“I just used the fire curse seed and still sensed a faint reaction,” Bai explained. “It’s weak, indicating that even if Elder Mou survived, he’s in dire straits. His physical body is probably destroyed; he must have used some life-saving technique. He’s moving secretly, trying to escape the chaos. What do you think?”</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>This was an unprecedented opportunity.</p><p>If Elder Mou successfully faked his death and escaped, both righteous and demonic cultivators would believe he was dead, wiping the slate clean of his past crimes, allowing him to continue wreaking havoc later.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the cliff where Elder Mou had fallen, silent. Bai said nothing more; the decision rested solely with Qin Sang.</p><p>“A Foundation Establishment cultivator pursuing a Nascent Soul cultivator…”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a slow breath. The thought was suffocating.</p><p>All the top experts were focused on the ancient demon, unable to spare attention elsewhere. Besides, something seemed amiss at Yitian Peak, making everyone uneasy.</p><p>Compared to the ancient demon, Elder Mou was a minor threat.  Trying to use others to deal with him was risky, and Qin Sang would also risk exposing the gray energy within her.</p><p>Her only ally, Senior Qingzhu, was engaged in a fierce battle with a demonic spirit; her condition was unknown.</p><p>She had to do it herself!</p><p>The idea was insane; no one would dare attempt it.</p><p>But it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, pacing back and forth.</p><p>“Both attackers appeared suddenly, their strength comparable to Elder Mou’s, and they were merciless. The power of the stele was terrifying. Elder Mou was attacked from both sides; it couldn't have been premeditated. Even if he used a life-saving technique, he must have paid a heavy price, barely clinging to life.”</p><p>Qin Sang was acutely aware of the danger of that moment.</p><p>“Elder Mou was undoubtedly severely injured.  His injuries would be further aggravated in the Spirit Suppression Realm. His Nascent Soul hasn't left his body. But even with top experts like Lingzhuzi present, everyone overlooked his escape. That means the stele’s strike must have been capable of destroying a Nascent Soul, leading everyone to believe Elder Mou was certainly dead…”</p><p>“In the Spirit Suppression Realm, critically wounded and sustained by a life-saving technique, how much strength could Elder Mou possibly retain?”</p><p>“Summoning Lightning Technique, the Ten Directions Yama Banner, the Star Conch… My own strength isn't weak.”</p><p>“Essentially, all the most renowned human experts are here; there’s no risk of interruption.  Assassinating Elder Mou wouldn't risk anyone suddenly interfering.”</p><p>“Even if the Demon Lord has loyalists down the mountain, they lack the cultivation to enter the Spirit Suppression Realm. Besides, Elder Mou, a man of such cunning, would dare confront other demonic cultivators after losing his physical body and suffering a severely damaged Nascent Soul? I doubt I even need to lift a finger; those demonic cultivators would take care of him.  He would definitely avoid their locations and escape from another direction, exactly as I hope.”</p><p>“If Elder Mou still has the strength… if the assassination fails…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression hardened slightly.</p><p>“Since it's a sneak attack, if I fail, I’ll flee immediately to the mountaintop. If Elder Mou isn't afraid of being discovered by Lingzhuzi and the others, he’s welcome to chase me.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced, anticipating various possibilities. Assassinating such a formidable foe required careful planning and meticulous execution.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting. Miss this chance, and once Elder Mou escaped the Seven Killing Hall, finding him again would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the surging demonic energy.</p><p>The sudden chasm filled her with a sense of foreboding.  Looking into its depths, she felt a chilling fear, her spine growing cold.</p><p>There’s something terrifying down there!</p><p>Qin Sang felt uneasy and dared not linger nearby.</p><p>Furthermore, Senior Qingzhu’s condition was uncertain; whether she could suppress the demonic spirit was unknown.</p><p>The situation was unclear, with no immediate resolution, and she had to prepare for any eventuality.</p><p>If she couldn't return to Xiao Han Domain and was forced to remain in the Cang Lang Sea, Elder Mou’s existence would keep her on edge, a constant threat.</p><p>“Wait! If Elder Mou still has the strength to teleport, then we might…”</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to make a decision, a crucial problem occurred to her.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators rarely defeat Nascent Soul cultivators; one reason is that they can't restrict Nascent Soul teleportation, making it virtually impossible to kill them.</p><p>"You've forgotten my background?"</p><p>Bai chuckled lightly. "Although I've lost my cultivation, my insight and judgment remain sharp.  Yuan Ying teleportation isn't unsolvable for high-level cultivators, and even if I can't restrain him, I can still track his movements."</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then overjoyed.</p><p>Giving the star conch to Bai was the right decision.</p><p>"Let's do it!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately made a decision.  Scanning the area, she chose a route, bypassing the battlefield, and silently moved towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Bai tracked Mou Lao Mo's trail, discovering that he initially moved slowly, gradually distancing himself from the Demon Lord and others before daring to increase his speed and flee down the mountain. He remained extremely cautious, stopping and starting frequently, constantly changing direction.</p><p>As Qin Sang had predicted, Mou Lao Mo dared not approach other demonic cultivators.  Only after he was certain no one had discovered he was still alive did he deliberately detour to escape behind the mountain.</p><p>This was the moment Mou Lao Mo was most alert.  Qin Sang didn't directly pursue him. Instead, she concealed her presence and went down the mountain, silently passing through stone forests and ancient temples, ignoring forbidden areas and secret realms, and slowly closed in on Mou Lao Mo.</p><p>When Qin Sang crossed a stone forest, she finally caught up with Mou Lao Mo. Bai softly transmitted a message: "He's just ahead."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, using all her strength to mask her aura, quietly slipped out of the stone forest, her figure blending into the shadows of the mountains, commanding her Heaven's Eye Butterfly to activate its divine ability.</p><p>With the power of the Heaven's Eye, Qin Sang quickly detected something unusual.</p><p>Beneath a cliff, a dried-up riverbed, stones smoothed by the flow of water, still shone with a luster. The riverbed, once lush with aquatic plants, was now filled with fossilized vegetation, resembling countless thin swords.</p><p>Within these fossilized plants, there was a subtle fluctuation of space, slowly moving downstream.</p><p>Fearing Mou Lao Mo would sense her, Qin Sang didn't dare to directly observe the interior of the fluctuation.</p><p>She was secretly surprised; she hadn't expected to confirm Mou Lao Mo's trail so easily.</p><p>"Mou Lao Mo must be using secret techniques to prolong his life, doing his best to hide under the noses of those masters. He can't maintain this for long; therefore, as soon as the great battle occurred, he desperately fled. Now, his aura is unstable, and he can no longer conceal it..."</p><p>Bai, having heard Qin Sang's description, reached a conclusion consistent with hers.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang didn't attack directly. Maintaining a distance, she trailed Mou Lao Mo, observing him quietly.  She had the Fire Curse Seed, so she wasn't worried about losing him.</p><p>Unknowingly,</p><p>Qin Sang found they were nearing the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Having confirmed Mou Lao Mo's condition, she made a decisive move. She couldn't wait for him to leave the Spirit Suppressing Domain.</p>
