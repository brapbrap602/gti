<h1>Chapter 702: Cold Mist</h1><p>After entering the Thousand Demon Sea.</p><p>Following the marked sea chart, the group rested on islands along the way to recover their depleted spiritual energy.  For two days, all was calm; they encountered no danger.  Guided by the chart, they remained cautious and traveled slowly.</p><p>Their journey was uneventful until the seventh day in the Thousand Demon Sea. By then, they had reached the sea's heart.  Occasionally catching glimpses, they sensed increasingly terrifying demonic auras.  The group became apprehensive, constantly vigilant, and gradually grew impatient.  The stout cultivator repeatedly reassured them.</p><p>"The chart indicates a small reef ahead," the scholar in green robes suggested, consulting the map.  "Let's rest there before continuing."  Everyone agreed.</p><p>In the Thousand Demon Sea, they dared not fly until exhaustion, for encountering a demonic beast while depleted would be extremely perilous.</p><p>As they spoke, a dark spot appeared on the sea's surface.  Upon closer inspection, it was a tiny reef, barely large enough for a dozen people to meditate. In the vast ocean, it was a welcome sight.</p><p>Confirming the absence of demonic beasts, they flew to the reef, taking turns on watch while the others sat cross-legged, grasping spirit stones, and recovering their strength.</p><p>Soon, their spiritual energy was fully restored.  Just as they were about to leave, the stout cultivator suddenly pointed in another direction. "Let's go there!"</p><p>Joy filled the group.  "The cave dwelling is there?"</p><p>The stout cultivator nodded. "My friends, your hard work has paid off. The cave dwelling is on an island a short distance ahead. We should reach it in about two hours."</p><p>"What are we waiting for? Let's go!" the thin old man exclaimed excitedly, leaping forward.</p><p>The others quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>This area was uncharted, seemingly unclaimed by powerful demons. The stout cultivator led them in an almost straight line. After two hours, a dark line appeared ahead.</p><p>As they drew closer, the line became clearer, revealing the outline of an island.</p><p>The sight of the island filled them with surprise.</p><p>It was far larger than they anticipated, stretching for dozens of miles north to south. Such a large island was rare in the Thousand Demon Sea; they had encountered only this one during their travels.</p><p>The island was lush with vegetation, vibrant and teeming with life.</p><p>Confident that no demonic beasts inhabited the island, they accelerated.  As they neared, the stout cultivator suddenly cried out, "No! Look there, the cold mist is spreading! The barrier is failing!"</p><p>Without the stout cultivator's warning, the group, from their vantage point, had already spotted the island's only anomaly.</p><p>In the south-central part of the island lay a hill.  The hilltop was covered in lush grass, but at its center, a blue mist was spreading. Even from this distance, under the midday sun, a faint chill emanated from it.</p><p>This was the cold mist the stout cultivator had mentioned; somehow it had emerged from a subterranean cave, like a sapphire embedded in the earth.</p><p>However, the scene surrounding the mist was far less idyllic.</p><p>Almost the entire grassy hilltop was encased in ice.  The blades of grass were like sharp blades, forming a blinding white expanse, clearly frozen to death.  The ancient trees around the hilltop were also affected, coated with frost, transformed into icy trees.</p><p>Furthermore, under the mist's influence, the cold was slowly spreading, threatening to transform the entire island into an icy wasteland, freezing all life.</p><p>No wonder they found no demonic beasts around the island; the cold mist's aura likely drove them away.</p><p>"How could this happen so quickly?"</p><p>The stout cultivator, distraught, rushed toward the cold mist.</p><p>While the stout cultivator examined the barrier, Qin Sang also approached, wrapping his palm with spiritual energy before cautiously reaching into the mist.</p><p>Upon entering, the mist showed no outward change, yet Qin Sang immediately felt an intense chill, piercing his spiritual energy and reaching his hand, threatening to freeze it instantly.</p><p>Then Qin Sang realized that the cold mist was subtly trying to penetrate his body.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.  He quickly activated his cultivation technique to dispel the mist.  Sensing the immediate drain on his spiritual energy, he pondered.</p><p>This cold mist was peculiar. In terms of coldness alone, it was not as intense as the Xuan Frost Gale, but the gale could be countered by spiritual energy and dispelled with warm objects. The cold mist, however, was different.</p><p>The biting cold seeped through everything; external protection was useless.  It was clear that once inside the cave, they’d need to constantly circulate their cultivation techniques to withstand the chilling mist.</p><p>Qin Sang, following the stout cultivator, soon came to a ten-foot square cavern resembling a pool.  Deep and mysterious, it was sealed by a strange barrier, slowly emitting the icy fog.</p><p>Others, making similar discoveries, showed varying expressions.</p><p>The stout cultivator, after examining the cavern entrance, let out a long sigh of relief, gesturing for everyone to retreat before speaking with a relieved tone.</p><p>“Thank goodness! We arrived just in time. The barrier holds, though my earlier recklessness caused a crack, allowing some mist to escape.  The barrier itself isn't in immediate danger.”</p><p>“However, if more mist leaks, the island's unusual activity will inevitably alert nearby powerful demons, forcing us to flee.</p><p>“Friends, time is of the essence. Let's go in now?”</p><p>A scholar in a green robe flew to the top of an ice tree, surveying the surroundings.  “Brother Fan, recklessly entering the cave as newcomers isn’t wise.  Are there lurking demons? If we enter, and they surround the island, we’ll be trapped.”</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he looked at the stout cultivator.</p><p>The others understood the implication.</p><p>Qin Sang silently agreed.  Entering the cave would consume a great deal of energy, and eliminating nearby threats was necessary.</p><p>“Brother Lan makes a valid point,” the thin elder agreed.</p><p>The stout cultivator’s face stiffened, but under everyone’s gaze, he could only concede. “Brother Lan, what do you suggest to ensure our safety?”</p><p>The green-robed scholar smiled. “It’s simple. We conceal our auras, spend some time scouting the area. The escaped mist's influence is limited and poses no real threat. In my opinion, the cave’s barrier is still strong and won't be breached by the mist anytime soon.  Brother Fan is simply overreacting.”</p>
