<h1>Chapter 1219:  News of the Ancestral Sacred Fire</h1><p>Chapter 1219:  News of the Ancestral Sacred Fire</p><p>Qin Sang patiently listened to Mei Gu finish.  The disciple of the Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master was very cautious; Mei Gu never directly revealed her intentions, only casually mentioning seemingly unimportant things during each exchange of cultivation experiences.  Combined with information gathered through other channels, a picture gradually emerged.</p><p>What most caught Qin Sang's attention was that the Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master returned to the sect periodically, often staying on Shen Gang Peak.  And during his last return, he had traveled with Bing Han, the Sect Master of the Xu Ling Sect!</p><p>There were other things as well. For example, this disciple's cultivation was similar to Mei Gu's, yet she couldn't go to the top of Shen Gang Peak to obtain the Qingyang Gang Jade needed for cultivation; she had to rely on a senior cultivator to do it for her.</p><p>...</p><p>Putting it all together, it could be confirmed that the Qingyang Demon Sect hadn't completely suppressed the Ancestral Sacred Fire! However, it was still uncertain whether the Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master already had a solution. Bing Han, the Xu Ling Sect's Sect Master, was also skilled in fire control techniques. If the Qingyang Demon Sect's Sect Master had invited her to help resolve this hidden danger, this presented an opportunity!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he pondered for a long time. After giving Mei Gu some guidance, Qin Sang left Shi Qu Mountain, instructing Fat Chicken to inquire about the progress of finding an overseas base in Qianshan Bamboo Sea, and having the white cat and the others take turns training at Sandie Pass. He then returned to the Yuan Shen Sect, disguised as a Yuan Shen Sect elder.</p><p>Bai's cave dwelling was sealed shut, indicating a prolonged seclusion. Qin Sang activated the restriction in front of the cave dwelling and waited for two full days before Bai opened it and came out.  Qin Sang unexpectedly found Bai somewhat listless.</p><p>"Brother Bai, have you been trying to force a breakthrough?"  Qin Sang noticed something was wrong and asked, frowning.</p><p>Bai gave a wry smile. "After years of seclusion, I've made no progress. I became impatient, and almost suffered a backlash from the Corpse Soul Pearl, nearly leading to disaster. Luckily, I regained my senses at the last moment.  I only suffered minor injuries, and I'm mostly recovered now."</p><p>"You've endured countless years of hardships. Why rush?" Qin Sang hadn't expected Bai to face such a situation. He had thought that being trapped by demonic fire, enduring endless desolation and despair, would have tempered Bai's mind to withstand anything.  Unexpectedly, even he was in such a hurry.</p><p>Bai said apologetically, shaking his head without speaking. Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't say anything more, trusting that Bai, with his experience, wouldn't make the same mistake again. He took out the bones inscribed with bone curses. "Not long ago, I followed clues left by Tan Hao and found the Tian Shi Sect's headquarters. Although I didn't find any scriptures, I did find these bones.  The origin of these bones is unusual. They might belong to the person who guided the Tian Shi Sect's Sect Master in establishing the Tian Shi Sect..."</p><p>"Brother Qin, you even found the Tian Shi Sect's headquarters, but you didn't see Tan Hao?" Bai was surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang responded with an 'Mm'. "I only found a place where Tan Hao briefly stayed – a branch of the Tian Shi Sect. After he rescued that mysterious person, he disappeared, and the trail went cold. I'll have my friendly cultivators help search for him later. I suspect that mysterious person and Brother Bai are from the same era…"</p><p>Bai pondered. "The Tian Shi Talisman is so difficult to deal with, it certainly doesn't seem like something created by a Yuan Ying cultivator.  Hearing you say this, Yuanxu seems like a prison for high-level cultivators. That person could survive in such a place to this day; his origin must be extraordinary. His cultivation might have even surpassed mine in the past. It's a pity I didn't go with you; otherwise, I might have remembered something."</p><p>The passage has been exposed, making it difficult to infiltrate Yuanxu again.</p><p>As Bai spoke, he picked up the bones and examined them, immediately becoming engrossed.  Seeing his reaction, Qin Sang was overjoyed—it wasn't a wasted trip after all.</p><p>"So that's it! So that's it!" After examining all the bone curses, Bai muttered to himself, his expression invigorated, seemingly having gained much.</p><p>"Thank you, Brother Qin. The Tian Shi Sect's secret arts must originate from these bone curses. As long as I understand these curses, I can refine the Corpse Soul Pearl and advance to Corpse King!"</p><p>Bai was filled with excitement and immediately wanted to return to seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  Being able to help Bai break through was worth it. As for whether he could use the bone curses to figure out a way to undo the Tian Shi Talisman, that would have to wait until after Bai emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Just as Bai was about to go in, he suddenly remembered something.  "Right! Has there been any sign of the Zi Wei Palace appearing?" He had heard Qin Sang mention that a spirit tide would precede the Zi Wei Palace's appearance, and it was about time.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Bai had always been interested in the Zi Wei Palace. Last time, due to time constraints and his insufficient strength, he hadn't been able to explore it thoroughly.</p><p>"The spirit tide has appeared. The next appearance will surely be within a hundred years!"</p><p>"As expected.</p><p>Bai nodded lightly, then suddenly changed her tone, asking Qin Sang, "You control the passage between the two realms. When are you planning to return to the Canglang Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, "It seems the Ziwei Palace will appear more frequently. There's no need to rush back to the Canglang Sea.  The chances of finding a second fragment of the Killing Sword there are slim, and I'm not strong enough to search the Demon Sea recklessly. I have a Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn. I plan to travel to the other three realms after encountering a bottleneck in my cultivation, broadening my horizons in the process."</p><p>"Besides the Killing Sword fragment, the Southern Ming Li Fire is what most attracts you to the Ziwei Palace, right? Have you decided what treasure you'll refine to subdue the spirit fire?" Bai seemed very interested in Qin Sang's plans.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "I only have a few ideas. I've been busy lately and haven't had time to think it through carefully. If worst comes to worst, I can subdue it later."</p><p>Bai disagreed with Qin Sang's approach.  "The Ziwei Palace is clearly on the verge of major changes, whether good or bad remains to be seen, leading to instability within. If ancient restrictions within change and someone else discovers the Southern Ming Li Fire, they will surely covet such a top-tier spirit fire and compete with you for it. In my opinion, the sooner you subdue it, the better."</p><p>"Brother Bai's words are not without reason. I will consider it carefully."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Bai. The Xiaohan region is unstable, the Zuyuan are ambitious, and the future is uncertain. Securing the treasure first will bring peace of mind.</p><p>Speaking of refining, Qin Sang's mind stirred, and he took out a piece of white bronze.</p><p>"Brother Bai, do you recognize this?"</p><p>Bai looked at it for a while and shook his head. "I can't recall what it is, but this white bronze actually repels spiritual sense, preventing any investigation of its interior. It's definitely no ordinary object."</p><p>When spiritual sense penetrates the white bronze, it causes a burning pain; this is why Qin Sang hadn't been able to ascertain the white bronze's properties.</p><p>Now that Bai wasn't in a hurry to retreat, he inquired about the war and the Zuyuan situation. There was nothing to hide, so Qin Sang told him everything he knew.</p><p>After reviewing the Yuan Shen Gate's archives, Qin Sang found no record related to the white bronze. That night, he left the Yuan Shen Gate and returned to Li Yu Fu's cave dwelling.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu, as expected, had successfully established his foundation and was consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>After instructing Bai Hanqiu, Qin Sang took Li Yu Fu and rejoined Fatty Chicken and the other demons, heading back to the Three-layered Pass.</p><p>He received a message from his senior sister: the alliance between the two realms had sent people to investigate the situation at the Wuyaya Valley.  After their return, all the Yuan Ying cultivators would be summoned for a meeting.</p>
