<h1>Chapter 2234:  Slaying the Hawk</h1><p>Qin Sang and the others were completely unaware of the approaching enemy, an enemy they themselves had inadvertently guided.  They leaped back and forth on the stone pillars, struggling to cross the hundred-zhang-wide pool.</p><p>Then Qin Sang stopped, turned, and looked behind him, his expression grave.</p><p>“Junior Brother, what is it?”</p><p>Qing Yan also looked behind, but the mist was thick; nothing was visible.</p><p>“Senior Brother, did you feel a tremor? Someone’s here, breaking the formation!” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Could it be Master…?”</p><p>Qing Yan blurted out, immediately realizing his mistake.  Their master couldn't have escaped so quickly, and if he wanted to enter, he wouldn't need to break the formation; he could simply use the secret passage.</p><p>At this realization, Qing Yan and the others were startled. “It must be a Golden Eagle Clan strongman! We don’t know how far away he is. Junior Brother, quickly subdue the Stone Embryo Fire; we’ll hold him off here!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly. The enemy was at least a Transformation Stage cultivator; even with the formation in the pool, Qing Yan and the others wouldn't stand a chance against him. They only knew how to break the formation, not how to control it.</p><p>Elder Tongshen hadn’t anticipated the Golden Eagle Clan breaking the formation so quickly. Now it was up to them. Logically, to save their lives, they should abandon the Stone Embryo Fire.</p><p>He glanced around, thinking that while they couldn't control it, they might still be able to use it.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang immediately explained the formation-breaking method to Qing Yan, urging them to get to the other side quickly. Then he retreated alone, taking out several jade bottles.</p><p>After reaching the Golden Core stage, he could refine more potent poison pills. However, the herbs needed for poison pills that could harm Yuan Ying cultivators were incredibly expensive.  Elder Tongshen's resources were limited, he couldn't just ask Qin Sang for whatever he wanted.</p><p>Qin Sang always prioritized his own safety. He had cobbled together enough materials to refine a few poison pills for self-defense, and then begged Elder Tongshen to refine two more for him.</p><p>His mastery of formations was beyond imagination; he could even set up a poison formation within the pool’s existing formation. Even if it couldn't kill the enemy, it could severely hinder him.</p><p>All they needed was to buy some time, subdue the Stone Embryo Fire, and then use the main formation to shake off their pursuer.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending a poison pill into the mist. It exploded, spreading its invisible effects.</p><p>With the grace of a lotus flower, he leaped across several stone pillars, launching a poison pill with each jump, until his supply was exhausted.  Then he quickly rushed towards the opposite bank.</p><p>Qing Yan and the others reached the other side and looked back to see Qin Sang following close behind. From the shore, the pool showed no mist, as if it had never existed.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Just as Qin Sang landed, a loud boom echoed behind them.</p><p>Everyone was startled.  A huge handprint had been punched into the stone wall.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>Rocks tumbled down, and a young man with a hooked nose emerged.  He wore a black robe with gold trim and sported a pair of eagle wings on his back, clearly not human.</p><p>The Golden Eagle Clan youth swept his gaze across the area, his eyes falling on the cave beside the pool. His expression darkened, and he sneered, “Hmph!  Little thieves, you dare steal treasure under my very nose!”</p><p>His voice grated like two pieces of metal scraping together.</p><p>Even across the pool, Qing Yan and the others could feel the immense pressure radiating from him, their hearts sinking.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't even glance at the youth. He walked towards the stone wall, pressed his hand against it, and a bright white light erupted from the fissure.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang about to be drawn into the white light, the Golden Eagle Clan youth exploded with rage, “You little thief, dare you!”</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A golden light shot out from the youth, transforming into a gigantic, razor-sharp eagle claw.</p><p>Qing Yan had no doubt; if that claw caught their heads, their brains would be splattered.</p><p>Faced with this imminent danger, they didn't retreat, instead summoning their treasures and preparing to block the Golden Eagle Clan youth, buying Qin Sang time.</p><p>Then, a strange thing happened.</p><p>The eagle claw reached the pool’s surface and abruptly disappeared, the golden light dissipating without a trace.  The air remained still.</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Even the Golden Eagle Clan youth was stunned. He felt his connection to his eagle claw technique inexplicably severed, as if a giant beast lurked in the void, swallowing his technique whole.</p><p>Qing Yan and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Qing Hong thought of Qin Sang and urged, “Junior Brother, stay calm! Don’t panic; we’re here!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, stepped into the white light, and disappeared.</p><p>A young man of the Golden Eagle tribe, momentarily forgetting Qin Sang, finally took a closer look at the pool. He immediately realized the pool held a secret, explaining why it had swallowed his magical abilities.</p><p>However, having come this far, he wouldn't be stopped by a mere pool.</p><p>Under the worried gazes of Qing Yan and the others, the young man snorted coldly and leaped to the pool's edge.</p><p>...</p><p>Behind the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the stone before her.</p><p>The space was small, with a raised stone platform on the ground. The platform was slightly concave, and on it rested an oval stone, or perhaps a stone egg.</p><p>The stone egg was about the size of a human head, slightly larger, and perfectly shaped like a hen's egg.</p><p>On the stone platform, Qin Sang saw countless runes, left behind by the elder.</p><p>Her gaze swept over the runes. She attempted to activate the restriction, confirming it was still active and functioning properly. Then, she focused her spiritual sense on the stone egg.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang sensed a unique energy within the stone egg—like a flame, but not violent, instead gentle and warm.</p><p>Penetrating the shell, Qin Sang saw a spiritual flame, its color a dark yellow, calm and still.</p><p>"This is the Stone Womb Fire…"</p><p>Qin Sang had never heard of this kind of rare fire in the mortal world, nor did she know its power.  Judging by its color, and the elder's notes, the Stone Womb Fire was ripe for the taking.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, facing the platform, forgetting the powerful enemy behind her, casting aside all distractions, and focusing all her attention on the stone egg.</p><p>The Stone Womb Fire seemed gentle, but that might be deceptive. Qin Sang needed to understand its nature first.</p><p>As if sensing an outsider, the Stone Womb Fire pulsed slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuation from the Stone Womb Fire and thought, "It's not as docile as it looks."</p><p>Changing her mind, Qin Sang didn't dare touch the Stone Womb Fire rashly. Instead, she focused on the restrictions inscribed by the elder.</p><p>Guided by the elder's inscription, Qin Sang effortlessly gained control of the restrictions. When she touched the Stone Womb Fire again, the experience was vastly different.</p><p>With danger imminent, Qin Sang remained calm and collected. She experimented with the restrictions while devising a plan to subdue the Stone Womb Fire.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang summoned a fire lotus.</p><p>This was a fire lotus she had refined using the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' technique, absorbing subterranean flames beforehand.</p><p>Thanks to the foundation laid by the elder, Qin Sang quickly formed a clear plan.</p><p>These restrictions could act as a conduit, helping her separate a wisp of the Stone Womb Fire's energy, which she could then refine with the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus'.</p><p>Once this wisp was refined, she would be closer to the Stone Womb Fire.  Subduing it, using either the 'Water-Fire Harmony' technique or the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' would be much easier.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang acted swiftly. The fire lotus slowly floated toward the stone egg, hovering just above it.</p><p>The runes on the stone platform simultaneously shone brightly. The light from the runes resembled centipedes, crawling upwards until the entire stone egg was covered in glowing runes.</p><p>Qin Sang remained composed and began to separate the Stone Womb Fire.  With the aid of the restrictions, her progress was remarkably smooth.</p><p>A wisp of fire flickered, separated itself, rose gently, passed through the shell, and was drawn into the fire lotus.</p><p>Qin Sang was intimately familiar with every detail of this technique and methodically refined the wisp of fire.</p><p>For a moment, a hint of dark yellow flame appeared on the surface of the fire lotus, then vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  She summoned the fire lotus's energy and touched the Stone Womb Fire again.  It felt undeniably closer.</p><p>With the help of the restrictions, things could only get easier from here.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang remember the Golden Eagle warrior.  The lack of noise outside suggested that he hadn't crossed the pool yet.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to use the fire lotus to absorb the Stone Womb Fire. However, as she absorbed more, she began to feel strained.</p><p>The 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' technique requires at least the Yuan Ying stage for smooth cultivation. Even when Qin Sang was close to the peak of the Golden Core stage, she struggled with it. Now, at an even lower cultivation level, it was only her familiarity with the technique that allowed her to force its use.</p><p>Nevertheless, she had done enough.</p><p>With this foundation of Stone Womb Fire, Qin Sang could use the 'Water-Fire Harmony' technique to refine the remaining Stone Womb Fire without fear of backlash.</p><p>Feeling she was reaching her limit, Qin Sang immediately switched techniques and activated the 'Pure Dew Returning Elixir' technique.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>The sound of flowing water echoed within her body.</p><p>Moments later, a clear spring actually flowed from Qin Sang's body, like a jade ribbon circling her.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The stone egg lifted.</p><p>The stone egg pulsed, and flames gathered beneath it, forming a lotus that gently lifted it towards Qin Sang.  The fire lotus steadied the stone egg.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated a stream of water, circling the egg.  Water and fire met, but instead of clashing, they remained strangely calm, seemingly undisturbed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't intend to leave them undisturbed. He began to channel his cultivation, drawing a wisp of the stone egg's fire into the water.  Others, even with protective enchantments, would have proceeded cautiously, but Qin Sang acted boldly.</p><p>A wisp of fire entered the water, causing ripples, yet remaining stable. It then seemed to transform into water itself, flowing within the current, ultimately entering Qin Sang's body.</p><p>A flush rose on his face, but his body remained firm. Moment after moment, more wisps of fire entered him—a second, third, fourth…</p><p>The stone fire gradually shrank, until only a tiny ember remained. Finally, the last wisp was absorbed, and with a 'crack', the egg crumbled to dust; its purpose fulfilled.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath.  He examined himself inwardly: a fire lotus bloomed in his Purple Mansion, and a Xuanhuang flame in his dantian.  His true essence rotated around the flames. He hadn't even begun to cultivate the Water-Fire Harmony technique, yet he felt the benefits of the stone fire already.</p><p>"The Way of Yin and Yang, truly profound!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled, took a pill to recover his true essence, and rose.</p><p>Emerging from behind the stone wall, he found Qing Yan, Qing Hong, and Shuang Luo staring at the pool, dumbfounded.  Seeing Qin Sang, Qing Hong started, "Junior Brother! You're out so quickly! What about the stone fire? Did you fail?"</p><p>Qing Yan and Shuang Luo anxiously awaited his answer.</p><p>"I've refined it,"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Relief washed over the three, but their expressions turned complex; the reason being the powerful Golden Eagle cultivator in the pool.</p><p>After Qin Sang entered the stone wall, the Golden Eagle had observed for a while before leaping into the pool.  The creature was indeed formidable; it quickly located the first stone pillar.</p><p>The Golden Eagle, moving intermittently, consistently deduced the correct positions. Qing Yan and the others could only watch helplessly.</p><p>Just as their anxiety peaked, a sudden change occurred.  The Golden Eagle seemed to encounter something, its aura fluctuating as it roared in anger.  It made several missteps, triggering the formation's backlash, and became quite disheveled.</p><p>That was just the beginning. They watched as the Golden Eagle thrashed about wildly, its aura growing more erratic, seemingly battling an invisible foe. This further enraged the formation's defenses.</p><p>Qing Yan, Qing Hong, and Shuang Luo were stunned.  They didn't understand the cause, but suspected it was related to Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Qin Sang, witnessing the Golden Eagle's plight, couldn't help but smile. His poison array, cleverly integrated with the pool's formation, confused its target and, combined with the poison pill's effects, could easily trip up even a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>However, if the cultivator acted carefully, they would only suffer injuries and delays, not such a spectacular downfall. This Golden Eagle, likely impatient to claim the treasure, underestimated Qin Sang and his companions, leading to its predicament.</p><p>"Serves him right! Don't blame me!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed with cold light.  He was desperately poor, and this was a rare chance to get rich.  Moreover, the Golden Eagle might possess clues to the *Great Treatise on Yin-Yang Correspondences*, a classic whose acquisition would be invaluable.</p><p>"After refining the stone fire, I can now manipulate a portion of the formation's power," Qin Sang said, his eyes narrowed on the Golden Eagle.</p><p>It was true. The formation and the stone fire were symbiotic; Qin Sang could indeed borrow some of its power.  However, the removal of the stone fire had weakened the formation's foundation, meaning it wouldn't last long.</p><p>"Junior Brother, you wouldn't...?"</p><p>Qing Yan and the others were shocked by Qin Sang's ambition. Against a Transformation Realm cultivator, their only thought had been escape, never counterattack.</p><p>"This beast is at its end.  Why not give it a try?  Senior Brother, Senior Sister, be patient and watch me take this beast's head!"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, his confidence inspiring awe in his companions as he stepped into the pool.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>The water's surface erupted.  Waves crashed against the pillars, and thick mist obscured the three's vision. Qin Sang's movements were too fast; he vanished from sight in an instant, before they could react.</p>
