Chapter 650: Sudden Change!

Manager Bai told Qin Sang about three more locations rumored to have spirit insects. He had recently discovered these places, but they were far away, and the information wasn't reliable.  Although these three were all extraordinary insects, some had unsuitable talents, and the cultivation methods for others were unknown.  They were inferior to the Skyeye Butterfly as a natal insect.

Qin Sang pondered silently.

Seeing this, Manager Bai said, “There's one more place where such spirit insects might exist, and that's within the eminent sects beyond the Western Frontier. They might have some.”

Qin Sang chuckled. “Would they be willing to sell?”

Manager Bai shook his head. “I'm afraid not! The rankings on the Witch Insect List only really apply to smaller sects and rogue cultivators. They don't mean much to the major sects and powers. These spirit insects are practically useless to us and rogue cultivators. We don't know how to cultivate them, and it's difficult to even reach their second transformation. However, some major sects possess the complete cultivation methods for certain spirit insects. These methods are absolute secrets, practically the foundations of their sects, and they won't easily sell them to outsiders.”

Qin Sang had anticipated this. The major sects of the Witch Clan were indeed extraordinary, possessing a deep understanding of insect control. Any one of them was no less capable than the Spirit Control Sect.

If it weren't for the Redfire Gold and the Spirit Control Sect's heritage, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to hope for more and would have to settle for the insects at the top of the Witch Insect List, like everyone else.

After bidding farewell to Manager Bai, Qin Sang visited a few more trading companies and left Hundred-Foot Village that evening.

The newly gathered information wasn't very promising, and Qin Sang was now leaning towards choosing the Skyeye Butterfly as his natal insect.

After putting some distance between himself and Hundred-Foot Village, Qin Sang stopped hiding his cultivation. He mounted his sword and flew back towards the Bear Mountain region.

He traveled day and night without delay.

Just as he was about to enter the Bear Mountain region, Qin Sang abruptly stopped his sword, raised his right hand, and retrieved something from the Thousand Jun Ring. After seeing the change in the object, his expression shifted slightly.

The mother coin of the Green Cicada Money lay in his palm.

The center of the mother coin, which had been empty due to the missing child coin, now held a child coin!

The child coin had returned!

After teleporting, Qin Sang had only given one child coin to Ya Gu.

Ya Gu had crushed the Green Cicada Money child coin!

Qin Sang gripped the Green Cicada Money and looked towards the Five Insect Sect, his gaze flickering.

Ya Gu had pleaded with him not to take back the Green Cicada Money, considering it the first gift he had given her and wanting to keep it as a memento.

Qin Sang understood Ya Gu's feelings, knowing that she wouldn't crush the Green Cicada Money unless she was in dire straits.

What danger could Ya Gu have encountered within the Five Insect Sect?

Qin Sang didn't believe Cui Xuanzi would dare harm Ya Gu.

Cui Xuanzi was clever. Even if Ya Gu's Cold Gold Sword and Devouring Cone were exposed, it wouldn't be worth the risk of offending a Foundation Establishment cultivator to kill her and steal her treasures.

The question now was, when did Ya Gu crush the Green Cicada Money?

The Green Cicada Money needed to be within a certain range to be sensed.

After Qin Sang left the Bear Mountain region, he went beyond the Green Cicada Money's sensing range. Only when he returned to the Bear Mountain region, like now, would the child coin, sensing the mother coin, return!

He hadn't entered the Bear Mountain region yet; this was the limit of the Green Cicada Money's range. This meant Ya Gu hadn't crushed the child coin recently, and it was likely she had done it some time ago!

The Green Cicada Money couldn't transmit messages, so Qin Sang didn't know what had happened to Ya Gu.

However, when the Green Cicada Money was crushed, the person crushing it would retain traces of the child blood's aura. The mother coin could vaguely sense that person's approximate location.

To Qin Sang's surprise, the location sensed through the Green Cicada Money was to the east of his current position, downstream of the Green Clothes River.

The Five Insect Sect was to his north, upstream of the Green Clothes River.

Why had Ya Gu left the Five Insect Sect?

It had only been six months since Ya Gu joined the Five Insect Sect.

Qin Sang had given her some cultivation-assisting pills and the Winged Serpent Village priest's relics. Her cultivation resources were far more abundant than his had been back then.

However, her talent wasn't good.

In such a short time, Qin Sang estimated she could at best cultivate to the peak of the third level of Qi Refinement. The fourth level was a hurdle that couldn't be overcome with pills alone.

At the third level of Qi Refinement, even in the relatively safe Bear Mountain region, danger lurked everywhere.  Ya Gu leaving the Five Insect Sect at this time was puzzling.

Qin Sang gripped the Green Cicada Money tightly and glanced coldly towards the Five Insect Sect. Knowing that saving a life was paramount, he immediately changed direction, sparing no spiritual essence or pills. He used Sword Qi Thunder Sound and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, traveling at his fastest speed.

Ya Gu had shown him kindness. Now that she was in danger, he had to save her. He only hoped he wasn't too late.

Furthermore, Ya Gu's sudden departure from the Five Insect Sect must have a reason. If Cui Xuanzi had any ulterior motives, he could only find out by locating Ya Gu.

The Sword Qi Thunder Sound was a remarkably fast movement technique.

A brilliant sword light streaked across the sky, as dazzling as a meteor. Its powerful aura swept across all directions without restraint.

Countless birds and beasts fled in terror along the way.

Mortals who heard the thunder-like sound and saw the dazzling sword light knelt on the ground, calling out to the gods.

The Green Cicada Money could only provide an approximate location, and Qin Sang sensed vaguely that Ya Gu was moving.

Passing over a large village, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  His divine sense swept downwards, and he detected a Foundation Establishment priest within the village.  He then directly used his spiritual essence, forming a giant hand that snatched the priest from his cave.

"Aaah..."

The priest screamed in terror.

He had been peacefully cultivating in his cave when the cave's restrictions were suddenly broken by brute force. Before he could react, a giant hand formed of spiritual essence grabbed him like a chick, leaving him completely powerless to resist.

Anxious to save Ya Gu, Qin Sang's speed didn't falter as he grabbed the priest. He flew across several mountain ranges in the blink of an eye.

"Tell me, what has happened recently in the Bear Mountain region?" Qin Sang demanded, holding the priest in his hand, his gaze icy.

The priest felt the terrifying pressure emanating from Qin Sang and was greatly shocked. However, he was a seasoned veteran after all. Seeing that Qin Sang had no intention of killing him, he quickly steadied himself and said with a trembling voice, "Four months ago, a Foundation Establishment expert suddenly appeared at the Five Insect Sect and subdued the surrounding area. Using the authority of a Golden Core cultivator, he forced us to search for a secret realm within a thousand-mile radius.  Other than that, nothing major has happened."


Qin Sang narrowed his eyes. "Has there been any unusual activity at the Five Insect Sect in the past few days?"

"I don't know what Senior means... As far as I know...  No."  The priest carefully observed Qin Sang.

Qin Sang questioned the priest further, but seeing that he genuinely knew nothing, he casually tossed him down.

The priest, having narrowly escaped death, was pale and muttered, "Trouble is brewing... trouble is brewing...  The Bear Mountain region will be in chaos! I'd best leave while I still can..."


After dropping the priest, Qin Sang continued at full speed.

Soon, he reached the Green Clothes River and saw Thousand Household Village not far ahead. The Green Cicada Money indicated that Ya Gu was even further downstream.
