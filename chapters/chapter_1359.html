<h1></h1><p>"If you could focus solely on the Immortal Dao, you might not lack the opportunity to surpass me."</p><p>Ye Laomo suddenly became dispirited, his tone filled with regret.</p><p>If the Ascension Platform hadn't given him the opportunity for 'Ascension,' he would have been the sole supreme being in the Northern Chen Realm, all his former powerful enemies trampled beneath his feet.</p><p>Standing alone at the pinnacle, with no companions.</p><p>It would indeed be very lonely.</p><p>Around the Azure Platform, the spatial turbulence grew increasingly dense; after a little while longer, it might be too late to leave even if they wanted to.</p><p>Beneath the Ascension Platform.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Heavenly Hành Alliance all showed a hint of worry in their eyes.</p><p>Ye Laomo had said before that only those in the late Nascent Soul stage had a glimmer of hope, and it seemed this was no false statement; both the Tongyou Demon Lord and True Person Canghong had been forced to retreat.</p><p>Only True Daoist was still persevering.</p><p>The two Twin War Generals of the Heavenly Hành Alliance were True Daoist’s true disciples, practically raised by True Daoist, as close as father and sons; they were like ants on a hot pot, anxious beyond measure.</p><p>True Daoist’s figure swayed in the storm, his eyes tightly closed, deaf to Ye Laomo’s mockery.</p><p>A strange light flickered on his body, using all means at his disposal, not considering a way out in the slightest, with no intention of retreating, desperately staking everything!</p><p>A trace of astonishment flashed in Ye Laomo’s eyes, and he put away his mocking expression, regarding True Daoist seriously.</p><p>At this moment, the Ziwei Palace flew higher and higher, disappearing into the spatial storm.</p><p>A piece of land appeared in the sky, inlaid in the void.</p><p>The Immortal Palace ascends!</p><p>"It is time."</p><p>Ye Laomo murmured, lightly tapping his feet.</p><p>The Ascension Platform trembled.</p><p>The Azure Platform shook once, and a beam of azure light shot out, rushing towards the depths of the void, ancient runes permeating, the azure light enveloping everyone.</p><p>"Don't forget your promise to me!"</p><p>Bai suddenly opened his eyes, shouting loudly, forming a hand seal, the Fiend Binding Cords on the Jade Skeleton shattering inch by inch, the remaining power erupting completely.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, Bai’s entire body of flesh and bone writhed, crackling.</p><p>'Pa! Pa!'</p><p>He severed his own hands and feet.</p><p>This wasn’t enough!</p><p>Bai was a refined corpse, seemingly unable to feel pain, his eyes without the slightest fluctuation, mechanically taking out every bone in his body, placing them in front of him.</p><p>Each bone bore a Bone Curse, arranged according to a pattern.</p><p>He was actually going to repeat the old path of the mysterious person in the water prison, refining himself into a Bone Array!</p><p>This scene, even in the eyes of Nascent Soul cultivators, was too shocking.</p><p>'Pa!'</p><p>Finally, only Bai’s head remained, placing himself in the core of the Bone Array.</p><p>Ye Laomo was also somewhat stunned.</p><p>He valued Bai highly, but had never spoken out to win him over, because he had his own plans in mind.</p><p>With the strength of Bai and Qing Jun, it was impossible to safely pass through the spatial turbulence, and they would inevitably ask him for help; what he wanted was the knowledge in Bai’s brain, leaving a wisp of remnant soul would be enough.</p><p>"I didn’t expect this guy would mutilate himself; could there be something I didn’t anticipate?" Ye Laomo thought to himself.</p><p>The Bone Array was complete!</p><p>In this instant, everyone on the Azure Platform felt a tightness all over their bodies, being carried by the azure light, involuntarily flying towards the void.</p><p>The Immortal Palace happened to be located on the path of the azure light.</p><p>The spatial storm blocked some of the power, but if their own strength was insufficient, the result would be being crushed into mincemeat by the spatial storm, their corpses and bones not remaining!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the spatial storm was overhead.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The azure light was impacted.</p><p>The Bone Array flickered with pale light, sheltering Qing Jun.</p><p>True Daoist coughed up blood, his face like golden paper; he smiled bitterly, raised his eyelids, and looked at Ye Laomo, as if sighing and self-deprecating, "I am not as good as you."</p><p>The Twin War Generals saw this scene, kneeling and wailing in sorrow, "Master!"</p><p>Ye Laomo only cared about observing Qing Jun and the Bone Array.</p><p>The Bone Array crackled.</p><p>A wisp of soul light wrapped around decayed wood, flying out from the Bone Array and entering a small wooden carving around Qing Jun's waist; the wooden carving initially had no facial features, gradually changing into Bai's appearance.</p><p>At the same time, the Jade Skeleton suffered heavy damage, finally unable to hold on, and completely fell amidst unwilling roars.</p><p>He did not die in the prison of the Sin God Palace.</p><p>He survived from ancient times to the present.</p><p>But died in the hands of a group of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>After the Jade Skeleton fell, a wisp of gray energy shot towards Qing Jun's brow, much larger than before.</p><p>Qing Jun's delicate body trembled, her beautiful head slightly raised.</p><p>The scene from Ye Laomo's previous breakthrough reappeared; the aura on her body skyrocketed, breaking through the late Nascent Soul stage in an instant, on par with Ye Laomo!</p><p>At this moment, even if the heavens collapsed and the earth cracked, it couldn't cover up Qing Jun's unparalleled elegance!</p><p>Beneath the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Everyone was numb; within a single day, two great cultivators were born in the Northern Chen Realm in succession!</p><p>They could also guess that Qing Jun’s breakthrough was likely to be fishy (had ulterior motives); it seemed like she was devouring the Jade Skeleton to strengthen the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, and then fuse it with herself.</p><p>It wasn't like Ye Laomo, who broke through on his own.</p><p>This kind of breakthrough, either left hidden dangers or could only temporarily maintain the realm of the late Nascent Soul stage, and would fall back later. But this small flaw did not affect Qing Jun's stunning everyone!</p><p>How old was she?</p><p>She wasn't from the same era as Ye Laomo at all.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Ye Laomo stared blankly at Qing Jun, not knowing what to say; it seemed he wasn't alone, Qing Jun's talent made even him ashamed, sighing leisurely, "With your talent, you are rare even in past generations. But they weren't as lucky as you, ultimately trapped in this cage, wasting their lives, turning into a pile of loess (yellow earth) like mortals."</p><p>Qing Jun's cultivation tended to stabilize, offering the Five Direction Pagoda, glancing at Ye Laomo, "You talk too much."</p><p>"The opposite of the Ascension Platform is an unknown land, which must contain dangers, we can cooperate," Ye Laomo changed his plan, actively trying to win over Qing Jun.</p><p>"You should focus on living first."</p><p>Qing Jun said indifferently.</p><p>Ye Laomo frowned.</p><p>Qing Jun flicked her finger lightly.</p><p>A stream of light flew down, heading straight for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense to scan it, discovering that inside were Qing Jun and Bai's messages for him.</p><p>Everyone’s sight was drawn to the stream of light, their expressions varied.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed their strange gazes, and his mind stirred; he did not put away the stream of light, but instead openly displayed the contents within.</p><p>The relationship between Bai, Qing Jun, and him was known to everyone.</p><p>Others would definitely suspect that they left him something before they left, and many incidents would arise later.</p><p>The handwriting floated in the void.</p><p>Everyone was stunned, gratefully looking at Qin Sang, greedily watching.</p><p>At this time, the speed of the collapse of the outer hall was getting faster and faster; here, one could already see billowing smoke.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>"The outer hall is going to be destroyed! Quick, leave!"</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone came back to their senses and quickly fled, driving their escape lights.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p>The outer hall was destroyed, and the Ascension Platform would also be destroyed!</p><p>This situation was something neither he nor Bai had anticipated.</p><p>In Bai's message, he taught him how to activate the Ascension Platform, without using such bloody means as Ye Laomo, of course, the difficulty of preparation was also not small.</p><p>When Qin Sang's cultivation was sufficient, he could reactivate the Ascension Platform.</p><p>Without the Immortal Palace opening the way, the cultivation requirements for 'Ascenders' were even higher; I am afraid that the newly-broken-through great cultivators like Ye Laomo and Qing Jun were no longer enough, but at least it was a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang didn’t hide anything, even if he made the message public, it didn't matter; let each rely on their own ability.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even the last hope was cut off!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed uncertainly, and he suddenly raised his head.</p><p>Most of the Immortal Palace had disappeared into the void.</p><p>The azure light closely followed the Immortal Palace and flew in.</p><p>At the moment when the azure light disappeared, Qin Sang and Qing Jun's eyes met across the subtitles; from then on, the two worlds were separated, not knowing when they would meet again.</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>In the subtitles that the message had transformed into.</p><p>Most of it was Bai’s message, Qing Jun only left two sentences.</p><p>"Junior Brother, I leave the Yuan Mirage Sect to you."</p><p>"I will wait for you on the road ahead!"</p><p>(End of Volume 3!)</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>1 Volume 4 "Azure Silk," please look forward to it</p><p>2 This volume also basically followed the outline, nothing to say, report on the recent situation.</p><p>In May, I said that I felt my health getting worse and worse, and changed the update plan. The situation was better, but I still felt uncomfortable in my neck. I checked it.</p><p>Good fellow!</p><p>Not only is uric acid high, but the thyroid gland may also have problems, and people are numb.</p><p>I am a dignified Shandong man. I have lived for more than 20 years before writing books. Except for my own death-seeking bumps, I have never worried about my body!</p><p>After the Dragon Boat Festival, I asked for annual leave and ran to several places, almost turning the hospital into my home.</p><p>During this time, I was really writing forcibly, and my mentality almost collapsed.</p><p>If I had sent a single chapter at that time, it is estimated that negative energy would have exploded.</p><p>Of course, since I am in the mood to share it now, it will of course bring good news!</p><p>Fortunately!</p><p>Fortunately!</p><p>It is determined that the problem is not big and it can be recovered with rest.</p><p>When people are in a good mood, they really eat well and sleep well. I went home the day before yesterday and slept for a day and a night. As a result, I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep last night. That was a literary inspiration.</p><p>I finished writing the missing updates from the Dragon Boat Festival and the alliance master’s bonus update in one breath.</p><p>I am going to have breakfast now and go back to sleep soundly.</p><p>It is customary to rest at the end of the volume, one or two days.</p><p>Because the leave is about to run out, there are also a lot of work matters that have accumulated, and I have to sort out the next volume outline, and I feel that one day is not enough.</p><p>Ask for a wave of tickets, isn’t it too much!
