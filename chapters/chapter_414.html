<h1>Chapter 407: A Lesson for You</h1><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A terrifying collision shook the entire cave.  Qin Sang nearly lost his footing from the shockwave. Blinding silver light filled the cave, turning his vision white.  He couldn't see a thing.</p><p>When the light finally dimmed, the Nine Nether Demonfire had vanished.  The Ten Yama Encirclement Formation was in ruins, several ghost banners scattered on the ground. Fortunately, they weren't the target of the lightning sphere, and Qin Sang had wisely withdrawn his main soul at the last moment, sparing it from destruction.</p><p>His magic treasure, however, seemed to have suffered. The large banner lay on the ground, its spiritual light dim, its power gone. The banner's surface was rolled up, revealing a faint crack.</p><p>Fatty Chicken was free.</p><p>Its body was charred black, its feathers singed, leaving it a bald, black chicken.  It was still plump, though, especially its fleshy wings and round belly.</p><p>Despite its sorry appearance, Fatty Chicken's injuries weren't serious. Its wings could still flap, its fat legs kicking at the air. The Nine Nether Demonfire hadn't touched it; the magic treasure had been struck by the lightning sphere before the flames could reach it.</p><p>But it was furious.  Recovering from the shock, it opened its beak to squawk, but its beak, too, was burnt black, and its cry was hoarse and grating.</p><p>The cry abruptly cut off, swallowed mid-squawk.</p><p>A cloud of black miasma descended, enveloping Fatty Chicken. Its wings stiffened, and it fell to the ground with a thud, bouncing slightly.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to destroy his top-grade magical tool, releasing all the poisonous miasma within the Sky Poison Net to buy himself even a sliver of time.</p><p>The terrifying power of the lightning sphere had startled him, especially the crack on his magic treasure.  Alarmed, he worried about its condition.</p><p>Even after using his magic treasure, he'd barely managed.  Without it, he wouldn't have had a chance to ambush Fatty Chicken.</p><p>These thoughts raced through his mind, but Qin Sang's movements were fluid.  He unleashed the poisonous miasma, and with the image of a dragon appearing on his body, he shot towards the jade pool like lightning.</p><p>Stepping onto the pool's edge, Qin Sang felt a surge of relief that the lightning sphere didn't automatically attack.</p><p>He jumped into the pool, reaching for the Bloodheart Mulberry within the spiritual spring.</p><p>As his hand touched the wood, a blood-red light emanated from it, spreading like a living thing along Qin Sang's arm.  He shuddered, feeling a strange, chilling, and unclean sensation assault his mind.  The jade Buddha pendant dispelled it.</p><p>As expected of one of the Ten Divine Woods, it was truly extraordinary.</p><p>With no time to examine it closely, Qin Sang threw the Bloodheart Mulberry into his storage pouch, a huge weight lifting from his shoulders.  Just as he was about to retreat, he glanced up and noticed a stone door behind the jade pool.</p><p>A secret chamber!  There was more to this cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He'd been wondering why the cave only contained a Thunder Swallow egg, a Bloodheart Mulberry, and an unknown spiritual herb.  While valuable, they didn't seem worth the trouble for two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Could the real treasure be inside the secret chamber?</p><p>The thought flashed through his mind, but he wasn't swayed by greed.  Obtaining the Bloodheart Mulberry was already a stroke of immense luck, and he had risked everything for it.</p><p>The Sky Poison Net was ruined, and the poisonous miasma, now uncontrolled, couldn't hold Fatty Chicken for long.</p><p>Once it awoke, the consequences of his greed would be dire.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away, resolutely turning around.  He activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and flew towards the cave entrance.</p><p>Passing Fatty Chicken, Qin Sang scooped up his scattered tools and treasures.  He quickly checked the condition of his magic treasure and sighed.</p><p>He hadn't been mistaken. There was indeed a crack on the banner!</p><p>Fortunately, the damage wasn't severe. The lightning sphere wasn't as destructive as he'd initially feared.</p><p>The damage was due to Qin Sang's weak cultivation. The treasure was wasted on him, unable to reach its full potential.  It had been directly impacted by the lightning because of Qin Sang's limitations, hence the damage.</p><p>A Core Formation cultivator could have easily repaired it with core fire.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.  He couldn't repair the treasure himself and couldn't ask another Core Formation cultivator for help. He could only put it away for now.</p><p>He had two Ten Yama Encirclement Banners.  He couldn't use both simultaneously anyway, so the damage to one didn't affect his overall strength.</p><p>All in all, trading a top-grade magical tool and some damage to his magic treasure for the Bloodheart Mulberry was a worthwhile exchange, even a huge profit.</p><p>Thinking of the Bloodheart Mulberry and the bright future of his Ebony Wood Sword, Qin Sang's gloom vanished, replaced by elation.</p><p>The cave entrance was in sight.  Hearing Fatty Chicken's enraged squawks behind him, a mischievous thought struck Qin Sang.  He turned and shouted, "Little Fatty! Little Black Fatty! Let Grandpa teach you a lesson:  the world is dangerous.  It's always good to have more magic treasures! They're quite handy! Haha..."</p><p>He wasn't sure how demon beast ages worked.  Fatty Chicken had just hatched, so it was practically an infant.  He was over seventy, so calling himself its grandpa wasn't too far-fetched.</p><p>Fatty Chicken seemed to understand, its cries growing shriller.</p><p>He felt a gust of wind behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed as he burst out of the cave and into the icy wind.</p><p>Looking back, he saw, as expected, that Fatty Chicken, despite its high cultivation and lightning control abilities, was afraid of the soul-chilling Frostwind.</p><p>Inside the cave, it had been protected by the underground fire vein.</p><p>At the entrance, Fatty Chicken didn't dare cross the threshold.  It flapped its wings and hopped around, its large, white-rimmed eyes filled with rage, letting out a continuous stream of squawks.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was cursing him, but since he didn't understand bird language, he figured it was just insulting itself.</p><p>As he flew deeper into the icy chasm, the smile on Qin Sang's face faded, replaced by a serious expression.</p><p>He had the Bloodheart Mulberry, but it wasn't time to celebrate yet.  Only when he safely escaped could he truly relax.</p><p>He wondered how the battle between the Nascent Soul cultivators was progressing, hoping there wouldn't be any major changes.</p><p>Clutching the Red Elixir, Qin Sang swiftly ascended.</p><p>Nearing the exit, he slowed down, holding his breath as he cautiously peeked out and scanned the distant sky.</p><p>The wind howled.</p><p>The battle between the three powerful figures was still raging.  Qin Sang couldn't see the Wuji Sect Master or the Thunder Swallow, only flashes of sword light and lightning colliding like dragons.</p><p>The man in black remained seated in meditation, surrounded by dozens of identical Black Tortoise Shells arranged in a mysterious formation.</p><p>The formation had a small gap, missing a few shells.</p><p>Once all eighty-one Black Tortoise Shells were gathered, the formation would be complete!</p>
