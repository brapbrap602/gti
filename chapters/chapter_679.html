<h1>Chapter 671: New Abilities</h1><p>Only able to refine magical artifacts.</p><p>Huiwen showed some disappointment at this news, but didn't let it show.  "To be praised by Sister Ran Luo, it must be extraordinary.  Please don't be so modest. I'm just an ordinary guest retainer, my position is far below yours.  Once we arrive at Duoyan Island, I hope you will look after me."</p><p>The journey was long. After a while of casual conversation, the three lost interest and each sat cross-legged in a corner of the carriage, entering meditation.</p><p>More than ten days later, Qin Sang noticed the caravan's speed had noticeably increased. Upon inquiry, he learned they were selling goods along the way to the various Wu tribes' settlements.</p><p>It seems these merchants know the urgency; they aren’t reckless risk-takers.</p><p>The journey proved their worries unfounded. While some Wu cultivators did eye the caravan, the situation remained calm.</p><p>In the latter half of the journey, many animal carts were emptied, allowing Qin Sang to occupy one alone, finally achieving some peace and quiet.</p><p>Ran Luo said they would reach Wushen Mountain by noon the following day, and Qin Sang felt a great anticipation. He wondered what the legendary Demon Sea would look like.</p><p>That night, while Qin Sang was meditating, he suddenly felt a stirring and opened his eyes, looking at the insect container at his waist.</p><p>‘沙沙……’</p><p>A rustling sound came from the container—a sound Qin Sang knew well: the sound of the fat silkworm.</p><p>Since the fat silkworm had swallowed the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and spun its cocoon, more than half a year had passed, and it had remained asleep, showing no sign of emerging.</p><p>In this time, his main insect Gu, the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly, had advanced to the mid-stage of its first transformation.</p><p>The fat silkworm, merely in its second transformation, was taking such a long time to molt—a rarity among all spirit insects.</p><p>Qin Sang sometimes wondered if the fat silkworm couldn't withstand the power of the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, had failed its transformation, and died inside the silver cocoon.</p><p>“Fat again?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened the container and took out the fat silkworm, looking at it with a disgusted expression.</p><p>The expected sight of the silkworm transforming into a butterfly didn't happen. The silkworm was still plump and multi-colored, seemingly unchanged except for being larger than before it spun its cocoon.</p><p>Its little eyes were also bigger, now visible to the naked eye, and its sly, lazy gaze was easier to detect.</p><p>The fat silkworm wriggled on Qin Sang's finger, rubbing against his hand in a display of affection.</p><p>It was hungry and wanted to eat.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the fat silkworm's expressiveness had greatly improved, indicating a significant increase in intelligence during this transformation.</p><p>He glanced at the insect container—the silver cocoon was gone.  Qin Sang tossed out several spirit fruits. The fat silkworm, no longer picky, ate greedily.</p><p>This fellow might have been bought off by the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, or perhaps it realized it couldn't escape and had resigned itself to its fate.</p><p>Seeing it eat heartily, Qin Sang, as if by magic, produced another purplish-red spirit fruit in his other hand and dangled it before it.</p><p>This was a poisonous fruit similar to the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, though far weaker. Qin Sang, inspired by the fat silkworm’s transformation after consuming the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, had bought many similar poisonous fruits in Pingbo Port.</p><p>He didn't know how to cultivate the fat silkworm, nor could he find any information, so he could only proceed by trial and error.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the fat silkworm lazily glanced at the poisonous fruit and then went back to eating, seemingly treating it no differently than the other fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang was frustrated and tried all the poisonous fruits in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Among them was a highly valuable poisonous flower that Qin Sang had intended to use only when it reached the late stage of its second transformation.  However, none of these roused the fat silkworm’s interest.</p><p>“What exactly does this thing like to eat?”</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely frustrated and distraught.</p><p>Although the fat silkworm was loyal to Ya Gu, Ya Gu wouldn't be waking up anytime soon. Since the fat silkworm was now obedient, cultivating it would be a great help.</p><p>But the fat silkworm's picky appetite left Qin Sang at a loss.</p><p>After a while, having eaten several spirit fruits, the fat silkworm was full, but it was clearly only filling its belly; the fruits weren’t helping its cultivation.</p><p>“After the transformation, I wonder what abilities this fellow has gained?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>After the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly hatched, Qin Sang discovered its camouflage secret.</p><p>On its wings, there is a kind of pollen-like dust. When encountering an enemy, it can use this dust to disguise itself as an ordinary butterfly.</p><p>The ability to conceal itself would only appear after the second transformation.</p><p>Being only in its first transformation, Qin Sang could easily see through its disguise, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator might not.</p><p>This shows how strong the Thousand-Eyed Butterfly’s camouflage ability is. It’s very good at self-preservation—no wonder even Qin Sang couldn’t see through it after its second transformation.</p><p>The fat silkworm was no match for the celestial butterfly.</p><p>Before its transformation, Qin Sang used the Nine Nether Magic Fire to pressure the fat silkworm. He found that the creature only knew how to eat and had no other abilities.  He expected the transformation to bring about some change.</p><p>Seeming to sense Qin Sang's ill intent, the fat silkworm trembled but dared not flee.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang used the insect-controlling technique of the Imperial Spirit Sect to communicate with the silkworm, urging it to demonstrate its new abilities.  He threatened it with the Nine Nether Magic Fire, promising to roast and eat it if it failed.</p><p>The silkworm's intelligence had indeed improved considerably; it quickly grasped Qin Sang's meaning.</p><p>Its fat body arched upward, its eyes closed tightly, and its head seemed to strain with effort.</p><p>*Pop!*</p><p>A vibrant multicolored light suddenly burst forth from the silkworm's body, rapidly expanding outward to a degree that surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang was fortunate to have previously set up a detection-blocking enchantment on his vehicle.</p><p>The aura emitted by the silkworm was also multicolored, like a rainbow, strikingly beautiful.  The radiant halo expanded rapidly until it enveloped both Qin Sang and the silkworm, seemingly reaching its limit.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and waved his hand within the multicolored aura, feeling nothing unusual.</p><p>He released his spiritual sense to carefully investigate, but still found nothing remarkable.</p><p>"An ability that takes this long to manifest... it can't just be for show, can it?"</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something.  He retrieved a purple jade bottle from his Qianjun Ring, held his breath, carefully opened the stopper, and released a wisp of blue mist which quickly dissipated, becoming odorless and colorless.</p><p>This was a potent poison Qin Sang had obtained during his Foundation Establishment stage, extracted from the glands of a poisonous toad.  It could kill silently; even a Foundation Establishment cultivator could fall victim if careless.</p><p>As soon as the poison mist left the bottle, Qin Sang noticed a ripple in the multicolored aura. The poison was immediately repelled, unable to penetrate the aura in the slightest.</p><p>"It has the ability to repel poison. Not bad."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, satisfied that the silkworm had not disappointed him.</p><p>The cultivation world boasts countless varieties of poisons. Some terrifying poisonous lands are too dangerous even for Nascent Soul Masters to enter. Furthermore, the Demon Sea houses numerous poisonous beasts, forcing cultivators to avoid them for fear of contamination.</p><p>It remained to be seen how many types of poisons the multicolored aura could resist and what its limits were. Further testing was needed.</p><p>The silkworm's cultivation was still low, but it certainly had great potential.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, resolving to find a way to cultivate it as quickly as possible.</p>
