<h1>Chapter 1765: Pursuit and Escape</h1><p>Deep within the Guidi Mountains.</p><p>A yellow rock, about the size of a millstone.</p><p>The Dream Weaver Flower was hidden within the stone.</p><p>This spirit herb couldn't be simply classified as a plant; at this moment, to Qin Sang's senses, it was just a rock.</p><p>Qin Sang had never encountered a spirit herb with such unique properties before, and he proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>Silently, a strange force seeped from Qin Sang's palm into the earth, slowly approaching the yellow stone.</p><p>This force masked its fluctuations exceptionally well, subtle and silent, penetrating layers of rock, reaching the vicinity of the yellow stone.  It felt like a pair of invisible hands, closing soundlessly.</p><p>Inside the yellow stone, the Dream Weaver Flower remained rooted, absorbing the earth's energy, completely unaffected.</p><p>Meanwhile, deep within the Guidi Mountain range, around each of the numerous flower seeds, restrictions appeared, as if cradled by calyxes.</p><p>The moment was right. Qin Sang prepared to collect the flower. The force surrounding the Dream Weaver Flower and the ‘calyxes’ of all the seeds converged simultaneously.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed something, his expression changing drastically.</p><p>While collecting the spirit herb, he had left the Sky Eye Butterfly outside to monitor the mountain's surroundings.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to act, the Sky Eye Butterfly suddenly sent a warning:  a major incident had occurred at the Demon Marshal's Mansion!</p><p>At both ends of the Guidi mountain range.</p><p>Two large Demon Marshal Mansions were located.</p><p>The Demon Marshal's Mansions could be considered like human cities, housing countless well-trained demon soldiers who guarded the Demon Marshal's Palace.</p><p>During his previous investigations, Qin Sang observed these demon soldiers training and patrolling daily—a formidable force, but with predictable routines.</p><p>After observing them for a while, he had a good grasp of their patterns, believing they posed little threat unless he was surrounded.</p><p>Everything had been normal until today.</p><p>Suddenly, war drums thundered through the Guidi Mountains. The sound echoed throughout the range.</p><p>In an instant, squads of strangely shaped demon soldiers soared into the air, their murderous aura and demonic energy filling the sky.</p><p>The cloudless sky was filled with dark clouds, and a howling wind raged.</p><p>Birds, beasts, wood spirits, and stone monsters – a small Demon Marshal's Mansion, yet it displayed a variety of demons, a chaotic scene.</p><p>However, most of the demons had low intelligence, their formations disorganized despite their attempts at order.</p><p>The true elite were the Demon Marshal's personal guards.</p><p>The Crimson Tail Demon Marshal, a fire crow who had attained enlightenment, had mainly avian soldiers, naturally skilled in aerial flight.</p><p>The Shadow Dark Demon Marshal, a transformed shadow wolf, commanded mainly beast soldiers, each capable of cloud-riding and mist-walking.  Together, their magic conjured gusts of chilling wind.</p><p>Qin Sang, located deep within the Guidi Mountain range, closer to the Crimson Tail Demon Marshal's Mansion, felt the fluctuations in the earth's energy after receiving the Sky Eye Butterfly's warning.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then deeply puzzled.</p><p>He hadn’t even begun to harvest the Dream Weaver Flower; the earth's veins hadn't been disturbed. How could he have alerted the Demon Marshal's Mansions?</p><p>Did they possess special means to monitor the surrounding earth veins?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted rapidly, his movements freezing.</p><p>Harvesting the Dream Weaver Flower couldn't be rushed, but the current situation allowed no delay.</p><p>While Qin Sang didn't believe the two Demon Marshals could threaten him, he had to consider the Demon Marquis.</p><p>If he insisted on harvesting the Dream Weaver Flower and was surrounded by the two Demon Marshals, by the time the Demon Marquis arrived, he would face utter annihilation!</p><p>Yet, the Dream Weaver Flower was already disturbed.  If he stopped now, the spirit flower would escape, rendering his efforts futile.</p><p>Finding another such herb might take many years.</p><p>As Qin Sang found himself in a dilemma, the two Demon Marshals appeared amidst their troops.</p><p>‘Roar… Roar…’</p><p>The demon soldiers surrounded their marshals, letting out excited roars.</p><p>The Crimson Tail Demon Marshal transformed into a red-haired female demon, burning flames seeming to flicker in her crimson eyes. With a command, a crimson demonic wind swept her elite troops into the sky.</p><p>A similar scene unfolded at the Shadow Dark Demon Marshal's Mansion.</p><p>Seeing that both Demon Marshals were leaving the mountains and not targeting him, Qin Sang felt a slight relief, yet remained astonished.</p><p>The simultaneous departure of the two Demon Marshals was certainly no small matter.</p><p>Was it an order from the Marquis's mansion, or had some other incident occurred nearby?</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the details, but felt an inexplicable sense of foreboding.</p><p>This was the Demon Marquis's territory, deep within the Guifang Kingdom, a land filled with enemies.  Involvement in any incident would be highly detrimental; he had to leave immediately!</p><p>The Demon Marshals' sudden departure was advantageous; Qin Sang no longer had to worry about being discovered.</p><p>He wasted no time, focusing all his energy on the arcane technique, making every second count.</p><p>Curving lines spread across the surface of the yellow stone where the magical flower was hidden.  Qin Sang's actions disturbed the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>The flower instinctively tried to transfer to other seeds, to escape, but its connection to them was severed!</p><p>At that moment, all the seeds were enclosed within the calyx, isolated from the outside world.</p><p>Confined to the small space within the yellow stone, the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower crashed around wildly, unable to break free.</p><p>Having secured the flower, Qin Sang immediately proceeded to the next step.</p><p>Simultaneously, all the barriers he had set were activated, and the ‘calyx’ containing the seeds slowly rose.</p><p>A faint image of the flower first appeared on the surface of the yellow stone, then gradually solidified, revealing the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower itself, its four petals trembling gently.</p><p>Just then, a faint rumbling sound echoed from the base of Gui Die Mountain, like a minor earthquake.</p><p>This was an anomaly caused by separating the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower from the earth's energy veins, disturbing the earth's qi.</p><p>However, the tremor was very slight by the time it reached the surface. With the demon commander absent, even if the demon soldiers guarding the commander's mansion noticed it, they wouldn't suspect anything.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Points of light continuously flew from the ground beneath Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Each point of light represented a seed, until finally, the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower ‘grew’ at his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the vibrant magical flower; it was the most troublesome medicinal herb he had ever harvested.</p><p>All the seeds trembled in unison and merged into the main body.</p><p>The seeds also contained some medicinal properties; harvesting the plant and all its seeds was essential for a complete collection.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade box he had prepared and carefully stored the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower. Then he climbed to a high vantage point.</p><p>The Sky Eye butterfly landed on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the Marquis's Mansion.  The territory was vast; it was difficult to discern what was happening there simply by observing the sky, and he had no interest in investigating.</p><p>Having obtained the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flower, his objective was achieved. He eagerly desired to return to He Ming Mountain, to focus on his cultivation until his breakthrough.</p><p>With a push of his foot, Qin Sang leaped from the mountaintop and flew west.</p><p>After leaving Gui Die Mountain, Qin Sang felt increasingly uneasy, his expression becoming ever more serious.</p><p>He hadn't traveled far before encountering two groups of demon soldiers, both led by commanders under the Marquis's command, marching rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that all the Marquis's commanders had been mobilized!</p><p>His ominous premonition intensified; he maintained his speed, continuing forward.  As expected, he encountered more of the commander's troops.</p><p>By a nameless river, hidden in the treetops, Qin Sang coldly watched a detachment of demon soldiers disappear into the distance.</p><p>He pondered silently.</p><p>Over this period, he had observed a pattern.</p><p>The two demon commanders from Gui Die Mountain were heading towards the Marquis's Mansion in the east.  The commanders he encountered later, however, were heading northwest, seemingly pursuing someone.</p><p>“Could someone be causing chaos at the Marquis' Mansion right now?”</p><p>Under the circumstances, Qin Sang couldn't help but think so.</p><p>He muttered a curse under his breath and considered his situation.</p><p>West was the shortest route out of Gui Fang, but judging by the demon soldiers' movements, continuing west could lead him into a clash. North was also impossible, and behind him lay the Marquis's Mansion.</p><p>To avoid being caught in the crossfire, he had to go south.</p><p>The besieged party might be human cultivators, but Qin Sang had no intention of rescuing them, nor did his strength permit it.</p><p>Qin Sang made an immediate decision and changed course.</p><p>Although eager to escape, Qin Sang dared not use the fastest Thunder Escape technique. Demons roamed everywhere, and the thunder escape technique was too conspicuous; using it would undoubtedly make him a target.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had other options. He leaped down from the canopy and transformed into a spiritual wood body.</p><p>He carefully controlled his size to be roughly the same as his original form. This limited his combat ability but provided greater agility.</p><p>The moment his feet touched the ground, Qin Sang suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The next instant, a tree-man emerged from a ancient tree deep in the woods, then silently vanished again.</p><p>Using the abilities of his spiritual wood body, Qin Sang moved through the undergrowth.</p><p>His aura blended seamlessly with the surrounding plants, easily deceiving the demon soldiers.</p><p>Despite its seemingly clumsy appearance, the spiritual wood body was surprisingly fast.</p><p>While Qin Sang steadily headed south, Cui Wei Zhenren was being pursued by two demon marquis, his situation precarious.</p><p>His unexpected exposure left him completely unprepared.</p><p>Seeing two demon marquis approaching, Cui Wei Zhenren realized that the Marquis had been prepared. Even if his plan to lure them out had succeeded, capturing the demon would be impossible.</p><p>Aware of his extreme danger, Cui Wei Zhenren didn't hesitate; he turned and fled.</p><p>The armored giant and the Marquis had been waiting, and they wouldn't let him escape, pursuing him relentlessly.</p><p>Liuhou's cultivation was inferior to the Golden Armored Giant, but he excelled in escape techniques.  The two demons, side-by-side, fled with lightning speed.</p><p>"That old geezer!"</p><p>Liuhou gritted his teeth. He and Cuiwei Zhenren were old acquaintances.</p><p>"Why aren't his reinforcements here yet?"</p><p>The Golden Armored Giant was puzzled. He didn't believe Cuiwei Zhenren would dare to come alone.</p><p>Liuhou didn't answer, his attention partly focused on contacting his forces outside, giving orders.</p><p>All the demon soldiers in the territory were mobilized.</p><p>The Guifang Kingdom and the Daoist Court had been fighting for years, reaching the pinnacle of battlefield tactics. They frequently achieved victory against the odds, and under the leadership of the Demon Marquis, they could unleash astonishing combat power.</p><p>However, ambushing Dongxuan Zhenren wouldn't be easy; meticulous planning was required.</p><p>Liuhou's subordinates, scattered throughout the territory, seemed disorganized but were actually well-ordered, gradually closing the net.</p><p>The distance between them and Cuiwei Zhenren was steadily shrinking.</p><p>At that moment, the Golden Armored Giant uttered a surprised sound, his flight abruptly halting.  His golden armor emitted a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, four colossal pillars, each a thousand meters high, erupted from the surrounding mountain peaks, reaching towards the heavens.</p><p>The two demons had just stepped into the range of the four pillars.</p><p>If Qin Sang were nearby, he would have felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Inside the four pillars, one half blazed with crimson flames, the other half radiated chilling white frost.  The clinking of chains echoed continuously—the Water-Fire Heavenly Prison he had once witnessed!</p><p>However, the prison erected by that Duotan Lord was incomparable in both scale and power to this one.</p><p>Four pillars formed the prison.</p><p>Water and fire intertwined.</p><p>Within the heavenly fire, countless red rays shot out.</p><p>On the other side, the frost froze the very air.</p><p>Any being unfortunate enough to fall into the prison was either incinerated or frozen to death, instantly becoming a lifeless husk.</p><p>This was a true death prison; only the two demons who had just entered remained alive.</p><p>Liuhou instinctively wanted to retreat.</p><p>The Golden Armored Giant roared, transforming within the blinding golden light into a golden-haired giant ape comparable in size to a mountain.</p><p>A terrifying aura shook the heavens and earth, but the four pillars of the prison remained unmoved, as endless water and fire surged towards them.</p><p>The Golden-haired Giant exhaled a plume of white breath, letting out a disdainful snort, unyielding.  Standing atop two peaks, it puffed out its chest, raised its immensely powerful arms, and forcefully pushed outward.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The water and fire were pushed back.</p><p>The Golden-haired Giant seemed to have opened a gate in the void, resisting the prison's binding force. The shock caused the two nearest pillars to tremble violently.</p><p>It suddenly raised its head, its sharp gaze piercing through the gap between water and fire, "So it's you!"</p><p>Three figures were now suspended above the prison.</p><p>Cuiwei Zhenren, along with the arriving reinforcements, the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor, and a dark-skinned man.</p><p>"Xuanjing Hou, long time no see!"</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor spoke from above, his tone calm.  But this was no time for pleasantries, so he nodded to the dark-skinned man.</p><p>The dark-skinned man threw a scroll.  The scroll unfurled in the high air, releasing eight silver talismans that shot towards the two demons.</p><p>This was originally a trap, but now it was only being used to delay them.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>The Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor frowned at Cuiwei Zhenren. He had arrived as promised, yet Cuiwei Zhenren had fled first.</p><p>"I overestimated myself," Cuiwei Zhenren didn't defend himself, saying gravely, "The demons were prepared. We need to leave quickly. There will be support outside Guifang."</p><p>Without further hesitation, the three fled, showing no intention of staying to fight.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>Seeing the three escape, the Golden-haired Giant roared to the heavens, its flesh bulging, its immense qi and blood surging into its arms.  With a mighty push, there was a tremendous *boom* as the four pillars collapsed, the prison shattered by its force!</p><p>Blazing fire scattered, frost raged, transforming the surroundings into a desolate wasteland.</p><p>Then, the Golden-haired Giant leaped, its fists smashing into the eight talismans.  Liuhou's back swayed, shooting a white ray that transformed into a sword, aiding the Golden-haired Giant in breaking the talismans.</p><p>The Golden-haired Giant's power was unmatched, shattering all eight talismans.</p><p>At that moment, Liuhou's face suddenly darkened, "Someone has infiltrated the Marquis' mansion!"</p><p>The Golden-haired Giant was startled, scoffing, "Are they after the treasures in my brother's mansion?"</p><p>Liuhou frowned.  To prevent leaks, many precious items had not been moved, and their loss would be significant, though the Daoist Court officials certainly wouldn't be interested in them.</p><p>"A feint!"</p><p>The Golden-haired Giant snorted, "Fourth Brother and the others should have arrived. Send a message for Fourth Brother to keep an eye on the thief. We'll continue the pursuit, leaving none alive!"</p><p>Liuhou nodded.</p><p>He had more than one helper, but he couldn't expect them all to stay here for a nebulous enemy.</p><p>Xuanjing Hou, his closest friend, had stayed for several years at his invitation.</p><p>Upon discovering the enemy, he immediately sent a warning. His helpers came via the Marquis Mansion's teleportation array.  But as soon as they left, someone infiltrated the mansion.</p><p>Liuhou followed the plan and sent a message. Seeing the Golden-haired Giant fly away in a golden light, he quickly pursued. </p>
