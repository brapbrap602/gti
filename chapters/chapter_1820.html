<h1>Chapter 1811: The Jade Old Man</h1><p>The White Tiger’s ferocious aura surged forth from the starry sky, then vanished back into the void, its image dissolving into nothingness.</p><p>The sacred beast, the White Tiger, seemed to have made only a brief appearance, while the malevolent ghost was utterly extinguished, its form collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang darted to the ghost, extended his right hand, pierced its brow, and extracted an object from its skull.</p><p>A transparent orb.</p><p>The orb was pure and flawless, like crystal, no larger than a bean.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang ascertained that it was not a demon core, yet the ghost had been about to detonate the orb before the White Tiger’s aura swiftly killed it, thus preserving the orb.</p><p>“It seems to be condensed from pure flower poison…”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a clue, his expression turning serious, carefully sealing the orb and storing it in his storage ring.</p><p>This was not the time for investigation.</p><p>With the ghost dead, the flower spirits, far from being deterred, were filled with even more resentment; the blood flowing down their cheeks became even brighter and more striking.</p><p>The resentment drove the flower spirits mad, causing them to scream at Qin Sang, their teeth like fangs. Their screams, imbued with terrifying resentment, were shrill and piercing, echoing across the field of bone flowers.</p><p>The void churned.</p><p>The clouds were a combination of resentment and flower poison, black as ink.</p><p>The vibrant pollen was gone, all stained black.  The clouds of resentment and poison filled the void; the deepest resentment in the world could be no more intense.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>A hurricane seemed to sweep across the bone flower field. The clouds of resentment and poison violently surged, their roar deafening.</p><p>The overwhelming black clouds twisted and writhed, finally forming giant black dragons that charged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Thick resentment enveloped Qin Sang, and the phantoms of countless flower spirits appeared beside him, staring intently and reaching out to pull him into the resentment, to share their endless torment.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the strange pulling force, coldly snorted, and lightning suddenly flashed in his eyes.</p><p>A flash of lightning revealed an extremely complex talisman.</p><p>The talisman shot into the sky, piercing through layers of resentful clouds.</p><p>The next moment, a brilliant flash of lightning erupted within the black clouds. Those with sharp eyesight could see a thunder seal at the center of the lightning.</p><p>Mysterious runes flickered within the seal—the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal!</p><p>This talisman, carrying the third-rank spell of the High Heaven God’s Palace, was now used by Qin Sang for the first time. The talisman transformed into a seal, commanding thunder, wielding heavenly punishment!</p><p>A thunderclap split the sky!</p><p>The seal erupted with blinding light, thunderbolts crashing down, earth-shattering and soul-stirring.</p><p>The lightning was so bright that Qin Sang, beneath the seal, was momentarily invisible.</p><p>When the lightning dissipated, Qin Sang's surroundings were completely clear. The flower spirit phantoms pulling at him were instantly destroyed by the thunder.</p><p>From above, a large hole appeared in the clouds of resentment, completely devoid of black clouds, cleansed by the thunder.</p><p>The remaining flower spirits seemed stunned, their screams ceasing.</p><p>Time seemed to stand still for a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a breath, nodded slightly, very pleased with the power of the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal. It had been worth the effort he had expended to obtain it from the High Heaven God's Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally hoped to gain a powerful spell while pacifying his primordial energy, feeling it would not have been a waste of effort.</p><p>Undeniably, the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal exceeded his expectations.  He had only been practicing it for ten years and was still far from mastery.</p><p>Indeed, it was a powerful thunder technique!</p><p>No wonder there was uncertainty surrounding the High Heaven God's Palace, yet the Thunder Left and Right Palaces still hadn't considered changing techniques; countless disciples continued to train there, and the Celestial Court seemed to place great importance on the High Heaven God's Palace.</p><p>With a sigh, Qin Sang didn't stop, fleeing the flower field.</p><p>He didn't know what kind of space this was, nor where he was.</p><p>Unable to determine his direction, Qin Sang simply chose a random direction to escape the flower field.</p><p>If the flower spirits couldn't leave the field, his situation would improve.</p><p>As flower spirits were born from spirit flowers, Qin Sang reasoned that they couldn't stray too far from the flowers.</p><p>As for the ghost-like flower fairy, the orb revealed its connection to the flower spirits; but as there was only one such ghost, its origins remained unclear for now.</p><p>Qin Sang aimed for a mountain pass.</p><p>The edge of the flower field was surrounded by mountains, beyond which lay a vast expanse. There was a clear opening ahead of Qin Sang.</p><p>This wasn't a true mountain pass; between two high mountains was a mountain ridge, about half a mountain high, resembling a gate in the mountains.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder escape techniques broke through the clouds of resentment, swift as lightning.</p><p>First, the thunder seal, then the thunder escape techniques; anyone seeing this would believe Qin Sang to be a thunder cultivator.</p><p>Of course, the Grey Warbler Sword, paving the way for its master, also displayed swordsmanship far beyond the ordinary.</p><p>Sword light carved a path, dancing with lightning.  One by one, the flower spirits fell beneath the blade, swathes of the bone-flower field wilting.  Yet more flower spirits continued their relentless assault on Qin Sang, an endless tide.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A rainbow-like sword energy cleaved a chasm through the cloud of malice.  The next moment, Qin Sang landed on a ridge, gazing beyond the mountains.  The sight before him was despairing, his expression instantly darkening.</p><p>*Huff… huff…*</p><p>Behind him, the cloud of malice surged, engulfing the ridge.  The flower spirits were not, as Qin Sang had thought, confined to the field; they could leave.</p><p>Ahead lay a wide, valley nestled among mountains, mirroring the first:  more bones, more spirit flowers—another, even larger, bone-flower field.  The bones here were ash-grey, the flowers sparse, yet they too nurtured flower spirits.</p><p>As he stood on the ridge, he saw the flower spirits rising from their cocoons, turning their heads in unison, their deep eyes fixed on him, resentment swirling within.  The malice intensified as the cloud of resentment chased Qin Sang over the ridge, the spirits' eyes bleeding, their screams piercing the air.</p><p>Enemies on all sides.  Having barely escaped one field, Qin Sang found himself in a desperate situation.</p><p>“Is this space… a world of evil spirits?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was grave. These flower spirits were unlike anything he had ever encountered, born and nurtured amidst the bones.  Remembering the evil spirits he had just slain, a deep unease settled over him.  Patch after patch of bone-flower fields, each teeming with these unnatural spirits… it was hard to believe this was natural.  This was far beyond any illusion created by magical powers.</p><p>Were more fields beyond those mountains? How many of these fields existed? Qin Sang didn't know.  However, noticing the differences between the fields, he judged that the one ahead was of inferior quality to the one he had just traversed.  Following this pattern, the fields seemed to degrade in quality in this direction, suggesting a possible escape route.</p><p>This was merely a deduction, based on limited information, requiring verification.  Silently calculating the limits of his poison beads and his endurance, Qin Sang paused briefly on the ridge, then his Grey Heron Sword shot forward like a streak of light.</p><p>Without another evil spirit to impede his path, Qin Sang, though he failed to capture one alive, crossed the second field without major hindrance.  Man and sword once more traversed the field.  Behind him, the vast, relentless cloud of malice and the tenacious flower spirits pursued, a spectral procession.  If he couldn't shake them, he would be exhausted to death, even if the poison didn't kill him first.</p><p>He glanced coldly over his shoulder, then ahead, noticing several particularly high peaks.  His expression shifted. He made directly for the tallest, reaching its summit in an instant.</p><p>He looked up at the sky.  The light was dim, seeming deep and profound, yet Qin Sang sensed a subtle distortion in the void. He dared not fly higher, wary of this power.  He stared at the heavens, lost in thought.</p><p>During his flight, Qin Sang continually considered ways to escape.  If he couldn't outrun the flower spirits, he had to leave this place. He recalled the drifting mists, which reflected the image of the fields. Could these mists be passages connecting the fields to the outside world?</p><p>The sky remained inscrutable, showing no clear signs. Trusting the abilities of his Sky-Eyed Butterfly, he commanded it to watch the heavens, alert for any unusual phenomena.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his gaze, surveying his surroundings.  Countless mountains stretched before him, rising and falling in a regular pattern, not chaotic. It was easy to imagine that the valleys between were filled with more bone-flower fields. The more he saw, the more unsettling it became.</p><p>The cloud of malice was about to crest the peak.  Qin Sang quickly scanned the mountains.  The nearby fields’ flower spirits were disturbed, gathering as dark clouds.  The clouds were too dense to see any light from magical powers or artifacts. He couldn’t locate the two cultivators and had to act on his own strategy.</p><p>Just as he was about to look away, his gaze solidified.</p><p>“These mountains… they seem familiar…” he murmured.</p><p>Comparing this landscape to another seemingly unrelated scene, a spark of understanding ignited in Qin Sang’s eyes.  The layout of the mountains and valleys perfectly matched the structure of a palace!</p><p>Considering the valleys as palace halls, and the mountain ranges as courtyards and pathways, he looked toward his point of entry. There was a valley parallel to the first field he encountered, roughly the same size—a perfect match for two main halls.</p><p>The field he'd just crossed, along with the surrounding valleys, matched the ninth section of the palace in both position and size.  He looked ahead…</p><p>A vast mountain range, formed by countless peaks, stretched before Qin Sang, extending into another massive range in the distance.  Smaller flower fields dotted the landscape between them.</p><p>The two mountain ranges reminded Qin Sang of the large parade ground in the eighth courtyard and the passageway in the seventh courtyard of the palace.  While he didn't understand the connection, the discovery was undoubtedly good news.</p><p>"Following the mountain ranges, corresponding to the palace gate locations, could this be the way out?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, instantly leaving the summit.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Thunder echoed through the mountains, its power immense.  Black clouds were already rising over the distant flower fields.  He couldn't conceal his presence; it was futile. The flower spirits were extremely sensitive to outsiders, and no secret technique could mask him.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the mountain range corresponding to the parade ground. Black clouds blotted out the sun, and countless flower spirits shrieked, creating a terrifying cacophony.  He seemed to be flying amidst a swarm of ghosts, a breathtaking sight.</p><p>The mountain ranges rapidly receded behind him.  Qin Sang partially linked his mind with the Sky-Eye Butterfly, feeling its thoughts.  As expected, the butterfly had noticed something. Qin Sang glanced upward, lost in thought.</p><p>Quickly, Qin Sang passed through the mountains.  A mountain ridge ahead resembled a dragon, lying prostrate on the earth.  He continued at full speed, constantly pondering as he flew, his gaze sweeping over the peaks below.  Suddenly, he remembered something.</p><p>When passing through the seventh courtyard's passage, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had seen a hidden door in the wall.  If the palace corresponded to the flower fields, what did the hidden door correspond to?</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the entire mountain range, immediately identifying several peaks. Based on their distance, the hidden door's location was nearby!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Lightning flashed across the mountains, suddenly plunging him down before a mountain.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang instructed the Sky-Eye Butterfly to shift its attention from the sky to the surroundings.  After a moment, it made a discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered, landing before a stone wall. Behind him was a field of flowers; this peak was located at the edge of the mountain range.  On the stone wall was a very hidden secret door!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed as he speculated where the door led. Then he frowned, looking at the bones at his feet.  These bones were grayish-white, but interspersed among them were several black bones.  Qin Sang took a black bone fragment, confirming it was human bone, but why the different color? The black bones were incomplete, scattered everywhere.  The poisonous clouds were closing in.</p><p>Unable to understand, Qin Sang decided to break open the secret door.  The door was protected by poison-based restrictions, similar to the seventh courtyard's archway, but the restrictive force was chaotic and seemed incomplete.  There were also several cracks on the door.  Qin Sang pressed his palm against the door, absorbing a little of the poison to identify the pattern. With a clang, his sword struck the stone door!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The restriction vibrated, and the stone door opened a crack.  Simultaneously, a thunderclap resounded through the mountains.  The mountains blazed with white light as the thunder seal reappeared, destroying the closest pursuing flower spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, slipping into the space behind the door, quickly closing it behind him, remaining vigilant.  Entering the door blocked out the noise, bringing a welcome silence.  He keenly sensed the absence of poisonous air within, the flower poison blocked outside.</p><p>He concentrated on the door, waiting a while to ensure the flower spirits weren't attacking before relaxing.  He had accumulated a significant amount of flower poison and had finally found a place to recover.  But he still didn't know where he was, and his mind remained cautious.  A quick glance revealed a mountain cave, seemingly not very deep.</p><p>His Grey Warbler sword formed a protective light around him. Qin Sang quietly walked deeper, soon reaching the end.  The sight before him caused his pupils to constrict slightly.</p><p>The end of the cave was a circular stone chamber with smooth walls, clearly man-made.  In the center sat an altar, on which rested a statue. Three cushions were scattered before it. One cushion held a skeleton, kneeling before the altar, indicating it had been praying before death.  The skeleton was jet black, matching the broken bones outside.</p><p>The statue was seven inches tall, carved from white jade, with a gentle, benevolent-looking old man. The jade old man had the air of a celestial being.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, first noticing the skeleton.  When his gaze met the jade old man's eyes, however, he inexplicably felt a trace of malice, causing him to feel a sudden chill. He sensed no unusual energy from the statue, and after a moment's contemplation, suspected the malice might be a result of the carver’s technique.  But having witnessed the spiritual practices of this world and the strange methods of Daoists and the mysterious gods, he didn't dare to be careless with any statue. He stood there, gazing at the jade old man, his expression grave.</p>
