<h1>Chapter 996: Reforging the Spirit Sword</h1><p>Chapter 996: Reforging the Spirit Sword</p><p>Mou, the Demon Lord, was a towering figure in the demonic path.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi, the leader of the righteous path, slaying demons and eliminating evils, was expected; but the Demon Lord also took action, which was quite surprising.</p><p>No one knew what heinous crime Mou had committed to incur the wrath of both the righteous and demonic paths.</p><p>Then, the truth came out.</p><p>Mou dared to violate the rules established by the human ancestors, massacring cultivators at the Qi Sha Hall, recklessly slaughtering those who had achieved the Nascent Soul stage.  Even more hateful, he blocked the only entrance to the Qi Sha Hall – an unspeakable act.</p><p>Such atrocious behavior enraged everyone; he deserved to die.</p><p>This joint effort by both righteous and demonic cultivators wasn't just to punish Mou, but also to warn others.</p><p>"I've heard that Qi Sha Hall is a dragon's lair and tiger's den, but now I know that the greatest danger isn't just the ancient restrictions within, but also the human heart.  I wonder what Mou was trying to achieve by slaughtering Nascent Soul stage cultivators; in the end, he met such a fate," the shopkeeper sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>"Luckily, the two great cultivators didn't stand idly by.  The Yuan Ying Ancestors, seeing Mou's end, are surely terrified and will be more careful, not daring to carelessly violate the Four Saints' Decree anymore," he added.</p><p>"What's the Four Saints' Decree?"</p><p>Qin Sang, hearing these words for the first time, curiously asked.</p><p>"It's understandable that you haven't heard of the Four Saints' Decree; after all, it doesn't concern us Nascent Soul stage cultivators much.  It's mainly to restrain the Yuan Ying Ancestors.  I only learned about it from a senior cultivator.  You see Four Saints Mountain? As the name suggests, the Four Saints' Decree was jointly established by these four saints.  The decree spread throughout the world; no one dares disobey!"</p><p>The shopkeeper pointed outside and continued, "This island is called Tian Xing Island, also known as the Sacred Island, because it was once the training ground of the Four Saints, and our human race rose from here!</p><p>"You probably know something about the history of the human race.</p><p>"Once, our human race was weak, while the Witch Clan was prosperous.</p><p>"Before the Four Saints, most of the Cang Lang Sea was occupied by the Witch Clan, and we humans could only huddle in the North Sea. At the worst times, we were forced to flee to the Yu Mo region.</p><p>"The Four Saints turned the tide, repelling the Witch Clan and saving the human race from disaster. They then led the human race to counterattack, forcing the Witch Clan to retreat to the Witch God Continent. This marked the beginning of the human race's rise.</p><p>"The Four Saints' prestige reached its peak, and they established the Four Saints' Decree. Several clauses relate to Qi Sha Hall; one of them forbids Yuan Ying cultivators from slaughtering lower-level cultivators within Qi Sha Hall.</p><p>"However, as time went by and the world changed, the situation within the human race has shifted countless times. Many people don't remember, or don't care about the Four Saints' Decree.</p><p>"Even fewer low-level cultivators like us know about it.</p><p>"It is said that Qi Sha Hall was discovered by the Four Saints. They found a treasure, an immortal cultivation technique, in Qi Sha Hall, which greatly increased their cultivation, enabling them to suppress the Witch Clan's experts…"</p><p>The shopkeeper recounted the story in detail.</p><p>Hearing these secrets, Qin Sang finally understood the background.</p><p>No wonder the Four Saints enjoyed such high prestige, worthy of the human race's reverence to this day.</p><p>"Thank you for explaining,"</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, then his curiosity led him to ask, "What happened to Mou? Was he also destroyed along with Tian Xing Island?"</p><p>"That…"</p><p>The shopkeeper furrowed his brow, shaking his head. "That's hard to say. There's no definite news; the Demon Lord and the Heavenly Dao Sect haven't made an announcement.  However, I think that Mou, only a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, facing Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord, probably couldn't escape."</p><p>Then, as if remembering something, he said fearfully,  "Even if Mou managed to survive, he certainly wouldn't be doing well.  Not only the righteous and demonic paths, but the three major trading alliances are also attacking him while he's down.  It is said that a chamber of commerce in Dongji Alliance was controlled by Mou, and the high-ranking officials were brutally murdered. Now, the entire chamber of commerce no longer exists…"</p><p>The shopkeeper listed Mou's crimes, which can only be described as innumerable.</p><p>The chamber of commerce that Mou slaughtered was the Qiong Yu Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Qin Sang was also terrified.</p><p>If he had fallen into that person's hands, he didn't know what kind of torture he would have suffered.</p><p>At the same time, he was somewhat dazed.</p><p>He thought he would never be able to get revenge on Mou, but someone unexpectedly avenged him.</p><p>In a way, both incidents were related to him.</p><p>Mou intercepted him, massacred cultivators in Qi Sha Hall, and later controlled the Qiong Yu Chamber of Commerce, all to hunt him down, so it could be considered self-inflicted.</p><p>The only regret is that he couldn't be certain whether Mou was dead or alive.</p><p>He still needs to be careful in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, after arriving at the Heavenly Dao Sect, he could inquire about the details of that battle.</p><p>Even if Mou escaped, he would surely be seriously injured.</p><p>"Should I hand over the Fire Curse Seed? Or should I look for him myself?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and rejected his ideas.</p><p>He wasn't clear about Mou's condition, and he couldn't take unnecessary risks.</p><p>Bai had said that the Fire Curse Seed didn't contain many fire curses, and his self-created refinement method wasn't perfect.  Once activated, the fire curses would 'burn out' quickly, and their range was limited. Searching for someone in the Canglang Sea with them would be like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Handing over the Fire Curse Seed meant revealing everything.  Even the eighteen demonic banners would make the Demon Lord envious; if exposed, Bai couldn't possibly protect himself.</p><p>"The wheel turns," he mused.</p><p>Though not personally avenging himself, Qin Sang was still in high spirits.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the shopkeeper, Qin Sang stayed on Xing Island for a while longer, searching for Ran Luo.  Although Ran Luo had introduced him to the Chamber of Commerce, he hadn't interacted with her much, later communicating directly with Elder Zou. Ran Luo wasn't high-ranking in the Chamber of Commerce; if she hadn't been caught in the crossfire, she should still be alive.</p><p>He didn't find Ran Luo, but he did learn about some Chamber of Commerce members who had been killed by Mou Lao Mo – Ran Luo's name wasn't among them.</p><p>"I hope she's alright..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer. Leaving Xing Island, he flew towards the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>...</p><p>The island where the Heavenly Dao Sect was located was one-third larger than Landou Gate.  The entire island belonged to the Heavenly Dao Sect; no other sects were present.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Sect wasn't tyrannical.  Except for the core area around the mountain gate, there were no restrictions elsewhere.  However, few dared to cause trouble there.</p><p>A market established by the Heavenly Dao Sect was located on the coast.  This was forbidden ground for the demonic path, but for righteous cultivators, it was arguably the safest place in the Canglang Sea after Xing Island, attracting countless cultivators.</p><p>It was called a market, but it was actually a city.</p><p>Qin Sang, using a disguise, blended into the city and, using the same tactic as before, opened a small shop in the market as a refiner.  He didn't need the Nine Nether Demon Fire; he was still capable of refining magic treasures.</p><p>After much consideration, he decided not to directly contact the Heavenly Dao Sect. He would stay in the market and first find out who the Ning family sword cultivator was.</p><p>He rented a shop and a cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his dwelling, going nowhere.  He sensed that the Ebony Sword was nearing the completion of its transformation!</p>
