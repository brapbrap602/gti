<h1>Chapter 2052: Haitang Academy</h1><p>“What trouble?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Su Nu said, “After learning of this matter, I wanted to find them. However, during the investigation, I discovered another force secretly searching for them as well. Fortunately, I noticed it in time and retreated into the shadows.  I simultaneously investigated this force and finally confirmed it to be a group of foreign tribesmen from Lansha Prefecture. These two also sensed the danger and became elusive, never being pinpointed. But they are, after all, alone and isolated, with no outside help in Lansha Prefecture. Hiding everywhere, they are probably at their wit's end…”</p><p>“You want to rescue them from that force?”</p><p>Qin Sang grasped Su Nu’s intention.</p><p>The Storm Realm was locked within the Sea of Mists. If they wanted to go to the Storm Realm, they would inevitably have to pass through the territory of the foreign tribes. If, as they speculated, the Changyou Tribe was a Heavenly Tribe, they might even have to traverse through the Water Tribes' territory.</p><p>Several human cultivators traveling for an extended period through foreign territory, no matter how well they concealed themselves, would inevitably encounter unforeseen circumstances. Sooner or later, they would be exposed.  The foreign tribes were not without experts, and each tribe possessed unique divine abilities.</p><p>Regarding the Sea of Mists, they could be said to be completely ignorant. Finding a foreign tribe guide was essential.</p><p>Regardless of these two individuals’ identities, if they could escape from the Heavenly Tribe to Lansha Prefecture, they could lead them from Lansha Prefecture back to the Heavenly Tribe.</p><p>Furthermore, after finding the Storm Realm, how to manage relations with the surrounding foreign tribes would also require careful consideration.  There wasn’t just one Changyou Tribe in the Sea of Mists. Even if he eradicated the Changyou Tribe, there were other foreign tribes.</p><p>The powerful foreign tribes would be pleased to see the Changyou Tribe destroy the Storm Realm. However, once the Storm Realm had the ability to destroy the Changyou Tribe, they certainly wouldn't stand idly by and would inevitably intervene.</p><p>If one wished for lasting stability in the Sea of Mists, the best method was to start from within the foreign tribes and find supporters. These two might present an opportunity.</p><p>“Their cultivation shouldn’t be weak, right?” Qin Sang immediately followed up with another question.</p><p>Su Nu hummed in agreement, “Both are definitely Void Realm experts. At least one is at the Second Stage of the Void Realm, equivalent to our Soul Formation Stage, but their precise cultivation level is still unknown. Their divine abilities are quite profound, possibly related to concealment and transformation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to have evaded capture for so long without revealing their true identities.”</p><p>After a pause, Su Nu gave a helpless smile, “I must appear foolish before Brother Qin. I still don’t even know if they are male or female.”</p><p>“Do you know which tribe they belong to?”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. “Have you found out why they fled to Lansha Prefecture? Why are those foreign tribes pursuing them?”</p><p>“Due to the fear of being discovered, I didn’t dare to investigate extensively, so the information I obtained is limited. The narrative I managed to glean from the foreign tribes’ forces is that these two Heavenly Tribe individuals abandoned their own tribe and fled all the way to Lansha Prefecture. They must possess some great secret, and may have even stolen some treasure. Even if they haven’t, within the foreign tribes, cultivation corresponds to status. These two are definitely important figures of some tribe. Capturing them would be a great achievement, and the Jiaoren would certainly bestow generous rewards. Of course, this might be deliberately released disinformation, and outsiders have no way of knowing the truth.” Su Nu briefly described all the information she had gathered to allow Qin Sang to make a judgment.</p><p>“A great secret? A treasure of the foreign tribes?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. He wouldn’t be tempted by such a claim. No matter how good a treasure of the foreign tribes was, it might not be suitable for humans.</p><p>“So, there are quite a few foreign tribe experts searching for them. Wanting to extract them is like snatching food from a tiger’s mouth! Have you noticed any signs of other forces intervening?”</p><p>Seeing Su Nu shake her head, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. Only needing to face the foreign tribes, the pressure was much less. In this situation, there was no need to consider Body Integration Stage experts. If the foreign tribes dispatched Saint Realm experts, they would have already captured the two.</p><p>“You must already have a plan. Have you discovered their whereabouts? Is there a way to take them away unnoticed before other foreign tribes act?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew that with Su Nu’s intelligence, she must have already formulated a strategy, which was why she had urgently summoned him.</p><p>As long as they didn’t encounter Saint Realm experts from the foreign tribes, Qin Sang was confident that even if he wasn't a match, it wouldn't be difficult to escape. However, the divine abilities of the foreign tribes were unpredictable and difficult to guard against.  It was best to avoid conflict if possible.</p><p>“Very difficult! I’ve been keeping an eye on those foreign tribes and discerned some clues from their movements. I judge that those two’s whereabouts might have been discovered. There are definitely foreign tribe experts watching them. It’s impossible to extract them silently. In fact, if the foreign tribes weren't worried about other forces intervening and hadn’t conducted a large-scale search, we wouldn’t have any openings to exploit.”</p><p>Su Nu’s expression was grave. She continued, “Even if we contact them in advance, it would be difficult to gain their trust. It would be better to appear when they are in danger.  They would have no choice but to leave with us.  Previously, alone, I didn’t dare to take the risk. Since Brother Qin has arrived, we might try.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought. After a moment, he asked, “Where are they hiding now?”</p><p>“Haitang Academy!” Su Nu said.</p><p>“Haitang Academy?”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled, recalling hearing this name on the way and that it was said to be somewhat special.</p><p>“Haitang Academy is also a dominant force in Lansha Prefecture. It’s very different from other forces. It’s a sect, but also an academy that imparts knowledge and instructs the masses. Haitang Academy is quite renowned in Lansha Prefecture, but not because of its strength.”</p><p>Su Nu seemed to have thought of something amusing and chuckled, “As the name suggests, Haitang Academy values classics and respects propriety, believing that if all people under heaven are courteous and observe etiquette, and all things follow rites and laws, then it will be an era of great peace.</p><p>‘At the beginning of life, human nature is inherently evil.’  Toward the common people, they should be guided to study, so that everyone becomes a gentleman. Reading ten thousand books will teach them etiquette, honor, and disgrace, suppressing evil thoughts and戾qi. Hence the name ‘Academy.’</p><p>“Because of this, under the governance of Haitang Academy, everything is regulated by laws and decrees, especially for outsiders, which are extremely strict. They refer to outsiders as ‘External Poisons,’ believing that allowing them to enter their territory, with the influx of pollution unrestricted, will inevitably corrupt those who observe etiquette over time, leading to the deterioration of social customs and shaking the foundation of the Academy. Therefore, outsiders who wish to enter Haitang Academy must obtain permission and must always abide by the Academy’s rules. Otherwise, they will be expelled at best, and punished severely at worst.</p><p>“Therefore, Haitang Academy has issued four Gentleman Tokens to the outside world. Outsiders holding a Gentleman Token may enter.</p><p>“The four Gentleman Tokens are Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum. Different tokens have clear restrictions on the places one can go, the things one can do, and so on. The Plum Token is the highest, and the Chrysanthemum Token the lowest.</p><p>“Those who can obtain the four Gentleman Tokens are individuals and forces recognized by Haitang Academy. Once their conduct fails to meet the Academy’s requirements, the Gentleman Token will be immediately revoked.</p><p>“Haitang Academy doesn't subscribe to the philosophy of ‘teaching without discrimination.’ They believe that humans are the most intelligent of all beings, and the vast world should be ruled by humans. The status of foreign tribes is no different from that of beasts.  Therefore, Gentleman Tokens are almost never issued to foreign tribes. Those two somehow managed to sneak into Haitang Academy, making that group of foreign tribes momentarily hesitate to act…”</p><p>The various rules of Haitang Academy sounded somewhat bizarre, but after understanding the Great Way of Ascension, Qin Sang didn’t find them strange.</p><p>“So, it’s not easy for us to enter Haitang Academy to find them?”</p><p>Su Nu nodded, “Even for those considered gentlemen by Haitang Academy, upon initial contact, they can only be granted a Chrysanthemum Token. After undergoing trials and gradually improving, acting without a single misstep, will they be granted the highest Plum Token. However, it's not impossible to find a workaround. I have befriended a few fellow Daoists over the years. By paying a price, I can try to acquire a Bamboo Token.  Remaining in the Turbulent Wave Sea Region is for the convenience of action.”</p><p>The Bamboo Token was the third rank, allowing access to a wider range than the Chrysanthemum Token, but judging from Su Nu’s tone, it seemed insufficient.</p><p>“Are those two hiding beyond the Bamboo Token’s range?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew that if Haitang Academy could establish such rules, they had the ability to enforce them. They certainly had detection methods to prevent outsiders from trespassing.</p><p>“Indeed. We might have to take some risks.”</p><p>Su Nu looked at Qin Sang. She had already laid out all the advantages and disadvantages; it was up to Qin Sang to weigh them.</p><p>Heavenly Tribe foreigners were rare.  Missing this opportunity, they could only contact the Water Tribe foreigners first and change guides later, adding a lot of trouble.</p><p>Of course, Su Nu dared to entertain the idea of snatching food from a tiger's mouth because she had witnessed Qin Sang's fight with the two Palace Masters of Liyu Palace and knew that Qin Sang's strength was unfathomable. Otherwise, she wouldn't take such a risk.</p><p>After Su Nu finished speaking, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>The foreign tribe force pursuing them wasn't weak, but it wasn’t enough to make him shrink back. However, before taking action, the more thorough the preparation, the better.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang’s heart stirred.  He said, “I might be able to obtain a higher Gentleman Token.”</p><p>Su Nu was somewhat surprised. The higher the rank of the Gentleman Token, the more difficult it was to obtain. She had been investigating in Lansha Prefecture for many years and could only obtain a Bamboo Token. She didn’t know what method Qin Sang had.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stood up and said, “I don’t have absolute certainty, but it's worth a try. The Bamboo Token must also be acquired. Do you need my help here?”</p><p>With Qin Sang saying this, he had made up his mind to act.</p><p>“No assistance is needed for now. I’ve already prepared everything.” Su Nu rose to see him off.  “I await Brother Qin's good news!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and, without hesitation, walked out of the market and transformed into a streak of sword light, vanishing into the distance.</p><p>Passing by the immortal city where Gu Ya and Jian Nu were located, Qin Sang called them out and pointed to a location. Su Nu had considered their escape route. Once they succeeded, they would hide in this place, which could avoid the eyes and ears of the foreign tribes.</p><p>Gu Ya and Jian Nu couldn't help them, so they were to go there and wait in advance.</p><p>Having given his instructions, Qin Sang flew directly out of the Turbulent Wave Sea Region and took out Songfeng Jiushi’s letter.  This letter was to be delivered to a cultivator with the Dharma name Xuan Xiang. The force behind this person was called Liunian Xiao Xuan.</p><p>Qin Sang had made inquiries. Although Liunian Xiao Xuan wasn't exactly a household name in Lansha Prefecture, it was equivalent to the Six Prefectures Hall in Zhong Prefecture. Next, it depended on how much weight the names Qiandie Shenque and Songfeng Jiushi carried.</p><p>…</p><p>Younan Island.</p><p>This island was isolated in the center of a vast ocean, with no other large islands within thousands of miles, yet it was bustling with activity.  Beams of light constantly departed and landed. On the island was a large and prosperous immortal city.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his sword light in advance and rode on a white cloud, flying slowly and unhurriedly, confirming the address on the letter.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang quickly found Liunian Xiao Xuan.</p><p>From the outside, Liunian Xiao Xuan looked more like a place for enjoying tea and tranquility, devoid of any mercenary air.</p><p>A young woman with both beauty and grace approached, her voice gentle as she inquired about his purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang directly stated his intentions, “I’ve been entrusted to deliver a letter to Fellow Daoist Xuan Xiang of your esteemed establishment. I wonder if Fellow Daoist Xuan Xiang is present?”</p><p>The young woman’s smile faded as she bowed respectfully, “Please follow me to the guest pavilion, Senior. I will immediately report your arrival.”</p><p>Qin Sang was ushered into the guest pavilion. Before he had finished a cup of spiritual tea, a middle-aged cultivator hurried over.</p><p>“Are you Fellow Daoist Xuan Xiang?”  Qin Sang rose and offered a respectful bow.</p><p>“Indeed, it is I! May I ask for your Dharma name?” Xuan Xiang returned the bow. “Which fellow Daoist entrusted you with this letter?”</p><p>“This humble Daoist’s surname is Qin, and I am a Guest Elder of the Five Elements Alliance. Before coming to Lansha Prefecture, I was entrusted by Songfeng Jiushi. The letter is here. Please take a look, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang presented the letter.</p><p>“So it's Elder Qin. My apologies, my apologies!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s expression became even more solemn. He excused himself and examined the restrictions on the letter. “It is indeed from Songfeng Jiushi.”</p><p>Qin Sang sat down and quietly sipped his tea.</p><p>After reading the letter, Xuan Xiang put it away and looked at Qin Sang, “I am already aware of the matter Songfeng Jiushi mentioned. I will have someone send a reply to Songfeng Jiushi shortly.  I am truly grateful to Elder Qin for traveling thousands of miles to deliver this letter.”</p><p>“It was merely a small effort,” Qin Sang said casually.</p><p>Xuan Xiang, however, didn’t see it that way. Usually, if Songfeng Jiushi had any instructions, a simple notification would suffice. This time, he specifically sent someone with a letter.  He naturally understood the implication.</p><p>Moreover, the title of Five Elements Alliance Guest Elder was enough to warrant his attention.</p><p>“A friend of Songfeng Jiushi is a friend of mine. Elder Qin has personally come to Lansha Prefecture. You must have important matters.  Is there anything I can do?  Please don't hesitate to ask.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, this person was so straightforward and got straight to the point.  Qin Sang showed a hesitant expression.</p><p>Seeing this, Xuan Xiang said, “Our establishment previously encountered a crisis and relied on Qiandie Shenque to overcome it. Elder Qin, there's no need to be polite.”</p><p>Since that was the case, Qin Sang didn’t hesitate and explained his situation, believing that with Liunian Xiao Xuan’s influence, it shouldn’t be difficult to obtain a Gentleman Token.</p><p>“A Gentleman Token?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang frowned. “A Bamboo or Chrysanthemum Token wouldn’t be difficult, but… Could Elder Qin be searching for some kind of spiritual item?  Our establishment might have it in our collection.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and said apologetically, “This matter concerns a secret of mine. Please forgive me for not being able to disclose it.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang understood and didn’t press further. He pondered and said, “Elder Qin might not be aware, but only a handful of people in all of Lansha Prefecture are qualified to obtain a Plum Token. At most, I can only secure a temporary Orchid Token for you.”</p><p>“Temporary?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Xuan Xiang nodded, “It's equivalent to asking an Orchid Token holder to vouch for you. It lasts for a maximum of one month.  During this period, if you commit any offense, the punishment will be increased. Elder Qin must remember to leave before the time limit expires.”</p><p>Hearing the implied meaning in Xuan Xiang’s tone, Qin Sang's heart stirred.  He asked, “If I accidentally break the rules, it won't implicate you, Fellow Daoist, will it?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang smiled confidently, “Unless Elder Qin openly attacks the Academy!  It’s merely a guarantee. Haitang Academy’s rules are so numerous; who can guarantee they will never make a mistake?  It would be nothing more than some quibbling.  My position isn’t so easily shaken.”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed, “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Fellow Daoist.  I will certainly be cautious in my words and actions!”</p>
