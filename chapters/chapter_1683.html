<h1>Chapter 1674: Nine Steps to the Apex</h1><p>Within the Palace Lantern Illusion.</p><p>When Zi Lei Zhenren learned the truth from Fan Lao Mo,  the statue was already mostly blackened. The black and red were clearly demarcated, yet strangely merging. The Demon Child's power seeped through the passage, increasingly infused into Zhu Wu Dao's body.  Zhu Wu Dao's strength steadily rose.</p><p>They tried to communicate with the spirit of the artifact.  However, during this time, the spirit seemed solely focused on purging the defilement infecting its core, completely ignoring the Demon Child's taunts and Zi Lei Zhenren's calls.  The artifact spirit was unconcerned with stabilizing the seal. The seal was now facing internal and external threats.</p><p>The Demon Child unleashed its fury, its frenzied assault proving effective. The seal trembled more violently, causing increasingly terrifying phenomena in the outside world.</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The sounds of fracturing echoed like a storm across Di Shou Mountain.  Visible to the naked eye, numerous 'giant pythons' covered the barrier, cracks as dense as a spiderweb, making it impossible to maintain the barrier's integrity.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The first collapse finally occurred near the summit, forming a huge void, unleashing a torrent of fierce winds.  From the outside, one could clearly see the winds forming a black tornado that soared into the sky, colliding with the array of magic swords high above.</p><p>Soon, more and more such tornadoes appeared, blanketing Di Shou Mountain within moments!  Witnessing this terrifying sight, everyone felt Di Shou Mountain was about to collapse, their hearts pounding with fear. What kind of battle was raging on the mountain to cause such devastation?</p><p>At the edge of the Earth Phase Hall.</p><p>A stone stele suddenly shattered, its upper half flying far away, disintegrating into rubble mid-air. The stele was an array artifact, a vital node of the Earth Phase Hall's protective mountain array, now destroyed from within.</p><p>Tai Yue Sect's master, Yue Lingtian, emerged from behind the broken stele. It was unclear what he had encountered in the Earth Phase Hall, but he was dusty and travel-worn, his Daoist robe torn in several places, and a long gash on his left wrist that looked like a knife wound.</p><p>Yue Lingtian didn't immediately tend to his wound, his gaze drawn to Di Shou Mountain.  His plan was to obtain the Earth Phase Hall's legacy before ascending Di Shou Mountain; then, the situation would be clear, allowing him to act calmly based on the circumstances.</p><p>Now, Di Shou Mountain seemed to have undergone some unforeseen change.</p><p>Go, or not go?</p><p>Yue Lingtian pondered, a spiritual light washing over his body, restoring his robe to its pristine state.  Ultimately, he decided to take flight, heading towards Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the others on the mountain felt the changes more acutely.</p><p>The pervasive cracking sounds were unsettling.  A change occurred, whether good or bad, was unclear. As the barrier shattered, the fierce winds had an outlet, and the waves generated by the barrier’s destruction suppressed the wind array, reducing its intensity.  The fierce winds on the mountain gradually thinned, and visibility began to improve.</p><p>As the anomaly unfolded.</p><p>The chase in the medicinal garden continued, unaffected by the outside world. He Gao Zhenren, transformed into a spirit crane, was agile and nimble. As he moved through the garden, he analyzed the garden's formations, intending to use them to shake off Su Mo and his companion.</p><p>However, the two joined forces again, their combined strength overwhelming.  All the obstacles He Gao Zhenren created failed to achieve their intended effect, being readily crushed.</p><p>Su Mo and his companion pursued relentlessly, managing to keep track of He Gao Zhenren's faint energy signature to prevent losing him. He Gao Zhenren's mastery of formations was admirable; in such a short time, he had achieved this level of skill. The two had tried several times to intercept him, but He Gao Zhenren saw through their plans.</p><p>Their chase left the medicinal garden in ruins.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A stone forest behind them collapsed.</p><p>Hearing the shattering sounds, He Gao Zhenren knew he hadn't shaken them off.  He snorted coldly, his crane shadow flapping its wings, suddenly soaring several meters into the air. With a clear crane cry, his speed increased dramatically!</p><p>Before He Gao Zhenren now lay a previously unseen area shrouded in spiritual mist.</p><p>Su Mo and his companion, upon seeing this, would undoubtedly be surprised. While circling with He Gao Zhenren, they had practically traversed the entire medicinal garden, yet had not discovered this area concealed by spiritual mist.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, their relentless pursuit, believing they had the advantage, had unwittingly allowed He Gao Zhenren to deceive them.  He Gao Zhenren's movements seemed erratic, but in reality, he was systematically exploring the changes in the garden’s formations, searching for this place, and concealing its unusual nature.</p><p>Of course, this deception couldn’t last long. Once they reacted and investigated carefully, they would discover the truth.</p><p>In truth, Su Mo and his companion's actions weren't wrong.  No matter the opponent's schemes, all they needed to do was focus on He Gao.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>He Gao's figure, swift as an arrow, shot into the spiritual mist.</p><p>The next moment, Su Mo and his companion swiftly arrived, their eyes widening at the sight of the mist.</p><p>…</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>A furious roar erupted from within the mountain.</p><p>At that very moment, Zi Lei, instead of focusing on destroying Wu Dao's plot and preventing the ancient demon's release, suddenly withdrew from the battle, flashing towards the mountaintop.</p><p>Leaving him to fight Wu Dao alone!</p><p>With Zi Lei present, Fan Lao Mo dared to gamble.  If it were only him, seeing the situation was hopeless, he wouldn't have fought the ancient demon to the death.</p><p>"The demonic calamity rises again, transforming gods vanish without a trace. Can you remain untouched?"</p><p>Zi Lei's tone was calm.</p><p>As the leader of a major Xuanmen sect, Zi Lei's composure and cultivation were truly remarkable.  Even faced with such crisis, he remained as unhurried as ever.</p><p>This calmness, however, grated on Fan Lao Mo's nerves, nearly driving him to furious outburst.</p><p>Despite his anger, he couldn't argue.</p><p>In the past, the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect didn't adhere to any single path; Daoism, Buddhism, demonic cultivation, and even unorthodox practices were all accepted.  Yet, when the demonic calamity arrived, everyone faced the same consequences.</p><p>The ancient demons never showed favoritism towards demon cultivators.</p><p>Once a realm was tainted by the ancient demons, escape was futile, no matter how far one fled.</p><p>"Friend, please be patient. I have a plan to subdue the demon; I'll be back soon."</p><p>Zi Lei had made his decision, leaving these calm words behind as he flew to the summit.</p><p>Instantly, a dazzling purple light erupted from the peak of Di Shou Mountain, accompanied by rolling thunder that echoed through the ruins.</p><p>Both inside and outside Di Shou Mountain, everyone witnessed countless purple lightning bolts on the summit, as if a thunder god had descended, clad in thunder robes and an imperial crown, commanding the lightning and subduing all.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others felt it, gazing towards the peak, unsure of Zi Lei's intentions.</p><p>Zi Lei's gaze, cold and distant, swept across the mountain, before abruptly settling on the medicinal garden.</p><p>In the medicinal garden.</p><p>Three figures had forced their way in. The spiritual mist had dissipated, revealing the garden's interior.</p><p>There was no magnificent or wondrous sight, only a clear spring, its water flowing gently, pure and natural.  The only unusual aspect was the exceptionally dense spiritual energy.</p><p>In the spring grew a vine, its roots in the water, its leaves lush and vibrant green.  Beneath the leaves, two fruits were faintly visible, round like bright moons, their spiritual light creating an illusion – a vision of a moon palace, fairies dancing around celestial fruits…</p><p>The light was actually a phenomenon created by the extremely concentrated spiritual energy.</p><p>They had seen this type of medicinal herb at the entrance to the garden.</p><p>"Lingxi Celestial Fruits!"</p><p>Su Mo and his companion's expressions changed drastically, uttering exclamations in unison.</p><p>Then they saw He Gao reach out, a spell flying from his palm, striking the protective barrier causing cracks to appear.</p><p>The Lingxi Celestial Fruits were real!</p><p>At the time, the female cultivator had planned to use real Lingxi Celestial Fruits to set a trap. After all, the fruits were useless for cultivating the spiritual body of a spirit treasure, and using real ones would be more effective.</p><p>Unfortunately, the protective barrier was too strong. Before she could completely break it, she discovered that the two Daoist masters were about to leave, so she had to use the garden's array to project the image of the vine.</p><p>While a projection, it was still real.</p><p>A mix of real and fake would deceive even powerful cultivators.</p><p>He Gao, being closest and well-versed in array formations, had sensed something, but couldn't be sure.  After all, who would use Lingxi Celestial Fruits as a trap? It was too extravagant.</p><p>He circled the garden, searching for the Lingxi Celestial Fruits and observing the flow of the spiritual veins, finally gaining an understanding.</p><p>The Lingxi Celestial Fruits were undoubtedly the most precious medicinal herbs in the entire garden, and the protective barrier here was intimately connected to the garden's formations, making it the strongest point.</p><p>By this time, He Gao had a thorough grasp of the garden, and the protective barrier posed no challenge.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The barrier broke, causing chaos throughout the garden.</p><p>The greatest chaos was here.</p><p>Just as He Gao was about to break through the light barrier, two figures suddenly charged forward, Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao, attacking from either side.</p><p>Since entering the ruins, Mo Xing Dao had rarely shown his prowess. Only a treasure like the Lingxi Celestial Fruits could make him act so recklessly.</p><p>Even cooperating with Su Zinan, with whom he’d just settled a deadly feud, and offending the Daoist sect, was a price he was willing to pay!</p><p>Two Lingxi Immortal Fruits, just enough to share.</p><p>He and the puppet were almost one, their momentum earth-shattering. Su Zinan, with his dual souls merged, was even more powerful.  Their combined assault targeted the heart of Crane Gao Zhenren.</p><p>In an instant, Crane Gao Zhenren found himself facing the might of two top-tier experts, enduring immense pressure.</p><p>He didn't turn around. His eyes suddenly turned cold. A cold snort escaped his throat, and his form vanished, transforming into a graceful, ethereal crane.</p><p>A red crest bathed in sunlight, frost-white feathers untarnished, bearing an extraordinary aura.  </p><p>This transformation was more refined than any previous one.</p><p>In a flash, a crane's cry echoed, and the crane split into ten shadowy images, each in a different pose, each imbued with Daoist essence.</p><p>Ten shadows formed a circle, instantly creating a formation.</p><p>Ten Crane Shadows!</p><p>This wasn't merely a powerful divine ability of Crane Gao Zhenren; it integrated his profound mastery of formations and prohibitions, a creation born from the culmination of his abilities.</p><p>Standing alone, forming his own array, he faced Su Mo and his puppet without fear!</p><p>The crane shadows swirled.</p><p>Su Zinan's eyes narrowed.  His true body and dual souls combined their power, wielding the black ruler, leaving trails of ruler shadows in the void as it slammed towards the crane formation.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Instantly, some crane shadows dissipated.</p><p>Su Zinan was stunned. He abruptly turned his head.  While Mo Xingdao's attack was impressive, it fell far short of the expected power of a man and puppet united as one.</p><p>This sight made Su Zinan's face turn pale.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's puppet had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Simultaneously, beside the clear spring and the green vines, a figure appeared—Mo Xingdao's puppet! But it was smaller, now of average human height.</p><p>Su Zinan wasn't the only one astonished; Crane Gao Zhenren was equally surprised, unable to comprehend how Mo Xingdao had accomplished this.</p><p>Regardless of their thoughts, the puppet reached out to grasp the green vine!</p><p>Just as they were filled with shock and anger, a shout echoed.</p><p>From the mountain peak.</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren saw everything in the medicinal garden. The imperial crown on his head emitted a brilliant light, separating from his head and shooting into the sky, instantly transforming into a thundercloud.</p><p>"Purple Thunder followers, where are you?!"</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren's eyes widened slightly, his presence as deep as an abyss.</p><p>The Thunder Lord's fury shook the mountains and earth.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, the Poison King, and others were all startled by the thundercloud.  Its aura dispelled the baleful winds around the medicinal garden, revealing the scene within.</p><p>"Lingxi Immortal Fruits!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically.  No wonder he hadn't found them on Kun Dao.</p><p>Who could have predicted that Kun Dao would dare use them as bait before even securing them?</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, Kun Dao was insane. He pursued her, obtained the Crimson Immortal Pendant, yet missed the chance for divine transformation.</p><p>The Lingxi Immortal Fruits weren't Celestial Linglongs; they were useful to him too!</p><p>The battle for the immortal fruits was decided. Returning was now impossible.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Three purple rays shot down from the thundercloud, plunging into the clear spring and transforming into human forms mid-air.</p><p>Purple Thunder followers materialized from the thunder, clad in thunder armor, their expressions serious, their eyes purple, lacking pupils, only strands of lightning coursing within.</p><p>Three Purple Thunder followers, each radiating powerful energy, each wielding a thunder rope, instantly arrived beside the puppet.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The puppet had just grabbed a green vine when its body shuddered violently. Its incredibly strong body was pierced by a thunder rope, the other end held by a Purple Thunder follower.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the puppet forcefully seized a Lingxi Immortal Fruit.  The moment the confinement formed, it flickered and, unbelievably, broke free from the chains and vanished into thin air.</p><p>The puppet escaped with the fruit, returning to Mo Xingdao's side, its chest a gaping wound, still bleeding with thunder, a horrifying sight.</p><p>"Yin-Yang Escape Technique!"</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang, Crane Gao Zhenren, Su Zinan, the Poison King...</p><p>Everyone who witnessed this was shocked.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Escape Technique was an innate ability of the Yin-Yang Ghost Fiends, comparable to that of a divine transformation expert. (Note:  Because the "Tianxiao" and "Tianyao" of Yin-Yang Tianxiao are too similar, and easily misinterpreted as being the same level, it has been changed to Yin-Yang Ghost Fiends.)</p><p>"Yin-Yang… Yin-Yang…"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind repeated these two words.</p><p>He had already suspected something was amiss with Mo Xingdao's puppet. Now, he was practically certain that Mo Xingdao had purchased the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal!</p><p>He never imagined the crystal contained such a powerful divine ability. Qin Sang chuckled wryly, he had indeed entered a treasure mountain yet failed to recognize its riches.  He missed his senior sister.</p><p>He could only blame his limited knowledge.</p><p>It was a transaction, each taking what they needed, each relying on their own judgment.</p><p>Did he regret it?</p><p>Perhaps not.</p><p>The Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal bought him the Thousand Knot Divine Net, allowing him to cultivate the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* so smoothly. If he had been distracted by puppetry, could he have advanced so far?</p><p>As his thoughts raced, he heard an explosion. Qin Sang looked intently and saw that amidst the chaos in the medicinal garden, the thundercloud simultaneously shot out a purple thunder seal, striking a valley near the mountain peak.</p><p>Light and shadows danced as the seal pierced through the barrier.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang saw a jade-like mountain wall.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, as the seal's residual power struck the jade wall.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The jade wall shattered. Amidst the varied expressions, fragments flew, and a vague figure emerged, seemingly neither Buddha nor Daoist.</p><p>The figure was several dozen feet tall, radiating an ethereal aura. With a single step, he raised a finger, gently drawing a line in the void, leaving a momentary mark.</p><p>The mark and figure vanished in an instant, leaving only a lingering echo, the mark seeming to pulse with the ebb and flow of the Dao.</p><p>Everyone forgot their regrets, entranced by the sight.</p><p>Just then, the Purple Thunder followers abandoned their pursuit of the puppet, collected the last Lingxi Immortal Fruit, and returned, kneeling in the air, presenting a thunder plate bearing the fruit to Purple Thunder Zhenren.</p><p>He took the fruit and ate it.</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren gazed at the Daoist mark, pondering for a moment, then suddenly burst into laughter, startling everyone.</p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p>His laughter rang out.</p><p>Purple Thunder Zhenren lightly adjusted his thunder robe and stepped forward.</p><p>Steps seemed to appear in the void.</p><p>He ascended nine steps, reaching the pinnacle!</p><p>By then, the barrier had shattered, and the celestial swords circling the heavens retreated.</p><p>劫云生。(Calamity clouds arose.)</p>
