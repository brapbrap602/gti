<h1>Chapter 1255: Corpse Flower Blood Amber</h1><p>Chapter 1255: Corpse Flower Blood Amber</p><p>Using the Intermittent Blood Mulberry as bait, but instead of catching the chicken, they lost the rice.  Qin Sang didn't find it funny.</p><p>Pang Ji was even more terrified, lamenting the dangers of the world.</p><p>"In this black tower formation, someone has survived from ancient times to the present?"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>After rescuing Bai, experiencing the Seven Killing Hall demonic tribulation, activating the Qingluan phantom, and seeing the bone formation left by the mysterious person at the Tian Shi Sect headquarters, Qin Sang had become accustomed to such things.</p><p>The Purple Micro Palace's change had far-reaching consequences.  Ancient restrictions changed, and all sorts of demons and ghosts emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang felt mixed emotions.</p><p>Gladly, more ancient cultivators surfaced, among whom there were certainly those who remembered ancient secrets.</p><p>Worriedly, if another ferocious demon lord appeared, Bei Chen Realm didn't have a Nascent Soul cultivator to turn the tide and reseal the demon lord.</p><p>The entire Bei Chen Realm would suffer.</p><p>Blood Lake is a dangerous place, but also a treasure land, with Intermittent Blood Mulberry, Boiling Blood Evil Flower, and spirit herbs that attract Jing Yu.</p><p>Even more preciously, few people dared to venture there.</p><p>I wonder how much Ye Laomo and the others know about this place, do they know that there are ancient cultivators surviving, hiding a hidden danger?</p><p>Could it be that they came for that ancient cultivator?</p><p>Three or two people being deceived is possible, but Qin Sang didn't believe that all the Guilty Abyss cultivators had gone mad, helping Ye Laomo release an ancient demon, unless they had received some information beforehand.</p><p>"I don't know what that person's origin is, perhaps he is the ancient cultivator you mentioned, perhaps a senior who mistakenly wandered in and was trapped here as well. But this person is not benevolent, he is full of malice towards me, definitely not a good person!"</p><p>Jing Yu said resentfully.</p><p>Years ago, what attracted Jing Yu was a spirit object called Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>The conditions for the formation of Corpse Flower Blood Amber are extremely harsh.</p><p>First, in an extremely Yin and evil place with strong blood energy, several unique and rare spirit flowers must grow.</p><p>After these spirit flowers bloom, if they are not picked and do not wither, over time they absorb too much blood energy, gradually crystallizing and transforming, washing away impurities, becoming amber-like.</p><p>Shaped like a gemstone, it is also a spirit medicine for the Yao race.</p><p>Corpse Flower Blood Amber contains blood poison; human cultivators avoid it like the plague, but powerful Yao race cultivators, when on the verge of a breakthrough, can directly consume Corpse Flower Blood Amber. After refining it, they forcefully impact their own bloodline power, thus finding a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p>However, if their strength is insufficient, they will instead be taken advantage of by the blood poison and die on the spot, with no cure.</p><p>It is a spirit medicine, but also a poison.</p><p>The Yao race both loves and hates Corpse Flower Blood Amber.</p><p>"I was attracted by the fluctuations of the Blood Lake seal, I saw the illusory images of several Corpse Flower Blood Ambers, floating uncertainly on the Blood Lake, possibly shattering at any moment, and I also discovered that the Blood Lake seal was loosening, so I thought it was a heaven-sent opportunity, and teamed up with another fellow cultivator of the Yao race who was secluded in the Wuyaya Valley to break the seal and enter…"</p><p>Jing Yu recalled and said, recounting his previous experiences.</p><p>The Blood Lake seal would fluctuate once every ten years.</p><p>Over time, they had long since become accustomed to it and didn't find it strange.</p><p>This time, the magnitude of the tremor was simply greater.</p><p>After Jing Yu entered, he saw the main body of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber on the mountaintop, floating in the center of the basin, that is, within this black tower formation.</p><p>They didn't have the ability to remotely take the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, so they had to personally enter the basin to find it.</p><p>At that time, the restriction on the blood gate was not as strong as it is now. The two Yao race cultivators attacked for a while and pushed open a crack, sneaking in.</p><p>After falling into the black tower formation, the two Yao cultivators avoided the flesh and blood puppets, searched here, found the center of the formation, and were about to take the Corpse Flower Blood Amber when they suddenly felt something was wrong.</p><p>“We were trapped at the bottleneck for too long and were bewitched. We ignored so many anomalies along the way.</p><p>“I don't know if he lured us in to trick us into helping him break the seal, or if he regarded us as food. Seeing that we had noticed him, he immediately bared his fangs.</p><p>“I am naturally proficient in lightning escape, and at the cost of serious injuries, I escaped.  Even though he was sealed, he could still manipulate the flesh and blood puppets here and hunt us down. When I finally found the blood gate, I discovered that the blood gate was closed, and I was powerless to open it myself.</p><p>“Fortunately, he couldn't run rampant all the time. I escaped with difficulty in the black tower formation, persevering until he fell asleep.  As for that fellow cultivator, his whereabouts are unknown, and he has not appeared since.”</p><p>Jing Yu sighed, paused, and then said, "I was seriously injured, and while healing my injuries I searched for a way out.  After that, he would wake up once every ten years. Even with a ten-year interval, in this Yin and evil place, it was very difficult for me to recover. That period of time was very miserable, and my injuries became increasingly severe.</p><p>I accidentally discovered this dungeon. I was at death's door, and although I knew it might not be safe, I had no other choice…"</p><p>Jingyu stroked Pangji's head gently, saying, "Fate was kind. The dungeon's seals only imprisoned, not harmed me, allowing us to reunite."</p><p>Jingyu recounted her experiences calmly, but Qin Sang and Pangji sensed the sheer terror.  Escaping the clutches of evil, only to be trapped in a dungeon, potentially forever…what despair!</p><p>After hearing Jingyu's ordeal, Qin Sang still knew little about the ancient cultivator sealed within.</p><p>"The Blood Lake seal fluctuates every ten years. Is that person trying to break the seal? If they can control flesh puppets, why not use them to attack the seal, or to find sustenance?" Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>Jingyu recalled, "From my observations, the flesh puppets don't belong to that person. They were birthed by the Black Tower array and are somehow forcibly controlled. Even under control, these puppets can't harm the array or the seal, likely unable to leave its range."</p><p>"That makes sense," Qin Sang nodded, frowning. "But, so many cultivators from both realms entered, yet the flesh puppets showed no reaction. I didn't receive any warning from the You幽魔君.  We were forced to separate, and that person didn't seize the opportunity to capture sustenance. Are they sleeping soundly, or is there another plot?"</p><p>Jingyu pondered, then said solemnly, "Perhaps it's not unwillingness, but inability!"</p><p>"What do you mean?" Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Jingyu's eyes. "Before I hid in the dungeon, I noticed the number of flesh puppets under that person's control was decreasing. Even in the dungeon, I could sense the fluctuations caused by their attempts to break the seal.  In the last two periods when that person should have awakened, there was no activity…"</p><p>"You mean…"</p><p>"Even if that person isn't dead, they're also at death's door!" Jingyu stated definitively.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood Ye Lao Mo's scheme.  A mere Corpse Flower Blood Jasper wouldn't warrant such a large-scale operation.  The Abyss of Sin likely learned of the ancient cultivator sealed within Blood Lake somehow.</p><p>An ancient cultivator on their last legs!  A treasure trove!</p><p>The question remains: will they continue to imprison the cultivator, or will the cultivator escape and unleash chaos?</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the Demon Lord firsthand, and the memory still haunts her.</p>
