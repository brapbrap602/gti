<h1>Chapter 2139 The Calamity of the Formless</h1><p>“So, Ning Zhenren knew about Mount Da Yu all along.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t overly surprised.  Given Ning Zhenren’s cultivation, if she had ever been to the Storm World, nothing could escape her perception.</p><p>The question was, why didn’t Ning Zhenren take the mountain?</p><p>Ning Zhenren nodded slightly, but began by explaining the origins of Mount Da Yu.</p><p>“Legend says there were originally five immortal mountains in ancient times: Mount Da Yu, Yuanjiao, Fang Hu, Yingzhou, and Penglai.  Immortal beings resided within them, and elixirs of immortality were plentiful.  Later, due to cataclysmic changes in the heavens and earth, the immortal mountains scattered, each finding its own master. Ancient texts record that the roots of these mountains were not connected to anything, and they constantly rose and fell with the tides.  Yuanjiao and Da Yu ultimately fell into the River of Filth, sinking into the unknown…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently. He had already obtained the Changyou clan's scriptures, which contained similar accounts, but they weren't as detailed as Ning Zhenren's.  Both the Yi Ren and Daoist sects recorded this event, and the existence of Mount Da Yu itself provided further evidence, making the legend seem credible.</p><p>Qin Sang listened with an open mind, understanding that the details were likely significantly different from the truth, perhaps even completely inaccurate.</p><p>“The origins of the River of Filth should also be recorded in the Daoist scriptures of the Fu Yao sect,” Ning Zhenren said, looking at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what he had seen and heard in the Fu Yao World.  “Legend says that at the dawn of creation, Yin and Yang were undifferentiated, the clear and turbid were not separated. As the Dao unfolded, the pure Qi ascended to become the heavens, and the turbid Qi descended to become the earth. Yet, some undifferentiated Qi remained, existing in the world as the Six Celestial Primordial Qi, which transformed into the River of Filth, breeding demonic evils…”</p><p>“This comes from the Daoist scriptures predating the Daoist Court's seclusion. It seems the Daoist Court has been isolated from the world for many years. Even before you left, it hadn't emerged into the world,” Ning Zhenren mused.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. A powerful cultivator like Ning Zhenren had discerning eyes. He had to be extra careful in his responses; any oversight could expose his origins. Thankfully, these weren't crucial secrets.</p><p>“What explanations are currently given for the origins of the River of Filth?” Qin Sang asked calmly, his expression unchanged.</p><p>“The fundamentals remain the same!”</p><p>Ning Zhenren commented.</p><p>“In the current cultivation world, the Buddhist concept of the Four Calamities is widely accepted.  These Four Calamities – Formation, Residence, Decay, and Emptiness – explain the operation of the Dao, the birth, death, prosperity, and decline of all things; both small and great worlds are included.</p><p>“Nothing can exist forever, not even a great world. From its creation until its annihilation, it follows the course of the Dao, undergoing countless calamities along the way. Its journey from existence to non-existence can be divided into four periods: Formation, Residence, Decay, and Emptiness.</p><p>“Some powerful cultivators have calculated that our great world is currently in its first or second period.</p><p>“Once the first period is over, the clear and turbid Qi should be completely separated. Currently, the Dao hasn’t evolved to that point yet. The clear and turbid Qi formed the River of Filth. As the Dao continues to unfold and the second period arrives, the River of Filth will eventually vanish.</p><p>“However, there's a more pessimistic theory. Looking back at history, this world has already entered the second period, and should be in its prime. Yet, the River of Filth still persists. Perhaps it's because this world once experienced a major catastrophe that disrupted the operation of the Dao, resulting in a flawed Dao, such as a demonic invasion.</p><p>“Regardless of the explanation, they are all based on the theory of the Four Calamities and are not without supporting evidence. Buddhism speaks of six realms of reincarnation, Daoism of nine hells.  The existence of ghosts and spirits is undeniable, yet there is no Yellow Springs or Netherworld; where do the dead go, and where is the cycle of rebirth?  Isn't this strange?</p><p>“Some believe that the Netherworld should be born from the River of Filth, but its evolution was disrupted due to the interruption of the Dao. The River of Filth is a flaw in the Dao, a flaw in the great world…”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought as he listened to Ning Zhenren's explanation.</p><p>These were indeed questions he had pondered before.  Ghosts and spirits can naturally appear in the mortal world, the Ghost Gate divides Yin and Yang, but the underworld depends on the mortal world without a Netherworld or cycle of rebirth. Where do the countless souls of the world go?</p><p>The Daoist Court's ghost soldiers, modeled after the Celestial Court, only had a place to exist thanks to the creation of Fengdu Ghost Prison by Hou Tu Huangdi.</p><p>However, these were not the main points.  Ning Zhenren only touched upon them briefly without detailed explanation.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of regret, yet he understood priorities. He silently listened as Ning Zhenren continued, “Mount Da Yu and Yuanjiao fell into the River of Filth. For reasons unknown, Yuanjiao was obtained by the Yi Ren.  Using the mountain as a foundation, a powerful Yi Ren cultivator created a sacred land, hence the origins of the Yi Ren sacred land and Yuanjiao City. However, Mount Da Yu, which also fell into the River of Filth, remained missing until it appeared in a small world, its state severely damaged.”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>The Changyou clan's scriptures only mentioned a possible connection between the sacred land and Yuanjiao City and Mount Yuanjiao, without specific details.  Perhaps those who left the records didn't know either.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mount Yuanjiao was the foundation of the sacred land.</p><p>The vast expanse of the Otherkin Sacred Land is where the powerful beings of the Otherkin Sanctuary cultivate.  It’s unimaginable what kind of divine mountain could give rise to such a place!</p><p>Mount Taiyu, however, is only a thousand zhang high.  While Qin Sang hasn't fully understood it, it could never possess such profound mystery.</p><p>Master Ning said the mountain was damaged; it’s far more than damaged!  Mount Taiyu is probably just a fragment now!</p><p>No wonder Master Ning didn't take it; it was likely beneath her notice.</p><p>“Is this Master Ning’s test and opportunity for Liuli? I don't know the full story, but I've taken the mountain and placed it temporarily at Qingyang Temple.  I haven't yet disturbed its secrets…”</p><p>Qin Sang originally sought purer Green Spirit Qi for a breakthrough.  It turns out such qi might not exist.</p><p>Mount Taiyu has immense origins and is certainly precious, but it's now only a remnant mountain of unknown use, and left for Liuli by Master Ning.  Naturally, Qin Sang wouldn’t be overly attached to it.</p><p>Just then, Master Ning interrupted, “I’m not asking for the mountain from you, Qin Shijun. Liuli knows you've taken it, and surely won't mind.  While ancient texts don't record whether the mountain developed a will, divine objects are sentient; those with affinity possess them. You were able to take it, showing the mountain recognized you.  Anyone else would likely not be able to.  You are the destined one; even if you forcibly gave it away, it might harm rather than benefit the recipient…”</p><p>Divine objects are sentient.  Qin Sang had suspected this, but he detected no sign of the mountain's will, nor felt any recognition.  Even though it was once one of the Five Great Divine Mountains, in its current ruin, does it still have the ability to choose its master?</p><p>In fact, controlling the stele allows manipulation of the mountain's ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Master Ning's probing gaze, as if questioning what made him special, why he was recognized.  He was just as baffled. The most reasonable explanation is that both he and Mount Taiyu originated in the Storm World.  Any Storm World cultivator of comparable cultivation could have taken the mountain at that moment.</p><p>Another explanation: could it be because I stored the mountain in my Lesser Heaven, thus avoiding some trouble?</p><p>“More than Mount Taiyu, I’m interested in the entanglement between Qin Shijun and Liuli.”</p><p>Master Ning smiled gently.  “I’ve thoroughly investigated Liuli’s life; Qin Shijun is a figure she can't avoid. Although your time together is short, fate has intertwined you deeply.  Qin Shijun, do you know the origin of the cultivation technique you both practiced?”</p><p>Qin Sang perked up, repeatedly saying, “I beg Master Ning for enlightenment!”</p><p>His and Liuli's bond began with the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing*, but this heretical technique caused subsequent changes. The lingering effects became a nightmare and torment for Liuli. This made her question whether her feelings were genuine or influenced by the technique, causing unimaginable suffering.</p><p>Undeniably, Qin Sang benefited, but he didn’t want this. Given the chance, he would help Liuli resolve the problem, allowing her to face her heart honestly.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, Qin Sang was willing to accept it.</p><p>Yet, to this day, he hasn't found the origins of the *Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing*.  Lord Dongyang said it originated from the Purple Micro Palace—an ancient technique, but clearly not from the sword cultivation lineage. Qin Sang searched extensively in the Five Elements League's archives, finding nothing.</p><p>“This technique is derived from an ancient cultivation method called the *Hongluan Heart Sutra!*”</p><p>Master Ning explained, “Perhaps its creator only obtained a fragmented version of the *Hongluan Heart Sutra*, making alterations that turned it into a heretical technique.  In reality, the *Hongluan Heart Sutra* is a top-tier method of Yin-Yang dual cultivation!”</p><p>The *Hongluan Heart Sutra*, a top-tier dual cultivation method!</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed and also relieved. If it wasn’t a heretical technique, resolving the lingering effects should be easier.</p><p>Master Ning explained, “Despite the alterations, the true meaning of the *Hongluan Heart Sutra* remains. However, the *Hongluan Heart Sutra* has extremely demanding requirements for cultivators.  It requires a couple to cultivate together, both deeply in love, fully trusting each other, without the slightest doubt or reservation, believing their partner will never change their heart.”</p><p>Such a cultivation technique exists?!</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a sense of unease.</p><p>Master Ning continued, "To cultivate the Crimson Phoenix Heart Sutra, one must willingly embrace the poison of love. One partner must surrender completely, body and soul, to the other's control. After a certain time, their roles will completely reverse. Through this continuous cycle of yin and yang, they achieve a harmonious union. However, hearts are fickle!  Unless you truly love and trust each other implicitly, how could you dare surrender yourself to your partner? How many such couples truly exist in this world?"</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent at Master Ning's question.</p><p>He wasn't sure such couples existed, and he certainly couldn't do it himself.  No matter how much he loved a woman or how close a relative was, he couldn't allow himself to lose his self; it had nothing to do with love.</p><p>Learning the origins of the  Primal Mother Cauldron Scripture seemed to bring even greater trouble.  However, perhaps it was only derived from a fragment, and he and Liuli had only practiced it once, so the risks might not be so severe.</p><p>At that moment, Master Ning, who had been observing Qin Sang, suddenly asked, "How do you view love in this world, Master Qin?"</p><p>Master Ning had revealed one secret after another in rapid succession, overwhelming Qin Sang.  Before he could process one, Master Ning changed the subject, always skirting the main point, leaving Qin Sang unable to seize the initiative, yet afraid to contradict the Master.</p><p>"I follow my heart and let things take their course…"</p><p>Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Master Ning asked more specifically, "For instance, should two people deeply in love cherish the present moment, remaining together no matter what hardships they face, enjoying their happiness without thought of tomorrow? Or should they always keep each other in their hearts until they achieve immortality, supporting each other through life's journey?"</p><p>"Master Ning seems to be hinting at something?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. "Besides, my cultivation is still quite limited.  It seems too early for me to contemplate immortality."</p><p>Beyond the Void Refinement stage is the Unity stage, and beyond that, the Great Ascension stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen Great Ascension cultivators, and he was getting closer himself, a glimmer of hope existing.  As for those who ascended to the Immortal Realm, he had only ever heard legends, such as that of the Witch God.</p><p>The path to immortality is elusive.</p><p>Among humans alone, the Jade Emperor, the ruler of the Great Zhou, the powerful cultivator who founded the Divine Talisman Court, the creator of the Divine Path, the Empress Houtu, and the Purple Star Sword Venerable, ruler of the Purple Star Palace…</p><p>Each was incredibly talented, dominating their respective eras, yet there was no clear evidence to suggest any had achieved immortality.</p><p>Qin Sang's pursuit of immortality was unwavering, and he pressed onward, step by step, but he was not arrogant.</p><p>"Immortality is not eternal life,"</p><p>Master Ning shook his head. "Reaching the Void Refinement stage removes the worry of lifespan. The Great Heavenly Tribulation occurs every three thousand years, which for mortals, and even Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators, is practically immortality. Reaching the Great Ascension stage, you are free from heavenly tribulations entirely, isn’t that immortality?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shaken. His encounters with powerful cultivators had been during life-or-death situations, leaving no time for such questions. The others might have considered this common knowledge and unlikely to offer such explanations unsolicited.</p><p>No Heavenly Tribulation at the Great Ascension stage!</p><p>No worries about lifespan, no worries about tribulations, it was more than immortality!</p><p>Could he achieve everything he sought by breaking through to the Great Ascension stage? If so, what would immortality mean for a Great Ascension cultivator?</p><p>Qin Sang realized he had again shown his weakness to Master Ning, revealing too much. Yet he felt helpless; the gap in knowledge was insurmountable.</p><p>"Great Ascension cultivators can create their own realms, becoming part of the Heavenly Dao itself. Some even call themselves embodiments of the Heavenly Dao.  Why would they face a tribulation? Moreover, if a Great Ascension cultivator wishes, they can allow their descendants to cultivate within their own lesser thousand worlds, preventing the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation from descending upon them until they break through or their lifespans end. Of course, the Six-Nine Great Heavenly Tribulation, imbued with a far stronger Heavenly Will, is beyond even a Great Ascension cultivator's influence."</p><p>The information Master Ning revealed was increasingly shocking, completely overturning Qin Sang’s understanding of Great Ascension cultivators.</p><p>In fact, the gap between each major realm was like a chasm.  If not for witnessing the Sword Domain, Qin Sang wouldn’t have been able to imagine the power of a Unity stage cultivator.</p><p>However…</p><p>Master Ning's tone shifted again.</p><p>"Great Ascension cultivators face no tribulation, but there is the tribulation of formlessness! Heaven and earth are ever-changing, calamities are constant, life and death exist in the cosmos; immortality is not eternal life.  Calamities come and go, unpredictable. Even a fleeting evil thought or a sudden burst of anger can trigger karmic consequences and bring misfortune!"</p>
