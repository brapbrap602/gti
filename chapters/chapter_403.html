<h1>Chapter 396: Corpse Transformation</h1><p>A portion of the Netherfire was diverted by Qin Sang to fend off the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Simultaneously, fearing Yu Hua might still retaliate, Qin Sang unleashed the remaining Netherfire, completely obliterating his Ten Directions Yama Formation.  Only after confirming Yu Hua was unconscious and utterly defenseless did he regain his composure, rushing to Yu Hua’s side to seal his energy sea, placing a restriction to turn him into a living corpse, before storing him in the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa, having lost its target, looked puzzled, vanishing on the spot and returning to its lair.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved his scattered Five Elements Breaking Spell Swords and pointed them at the barrier.</p><p>He didn't choose to leave the Ice Palace.</p><p>Firstly, he was unsure what disturbances the destruction of the Flying Horned Dragonfish nests might cause.  Would they leave the dark pool?  If he encountered them in the passage, escaping in his current state would be difficult.</p><p>Secondly, he feared Yu Hua might have accomplices waiting outside.</p><p>The space behind the barrier, however, offered a rare haven, guarded by the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The sensible course of action was to recover from his injuries and then figure out a way to leave.</p><p>Upon teleporting to the Ice Palace, Qin Sang immediately collapsed.</p><p>Reflecting on the recent ordeal – from delaying the Flying Night Rakshasa for Yun Youzi to encountering and killing Yu Hua – it hadn't taken much time, yet he was severely injured, his mind taut and unrelieved.</p><p>All he wanted was a deep sleep, to forget everything.</p><p>But that was impossible.</p><p>Mustering his strength, Qin Sang sat up, supporting himself on his arms, only to hiss in pain, his face contorting as his upper body doubled over. He clutched his dantian, gritting his teeth to endure the agony.</p><p>Drops of cold sweat hit the ground, freezing into icy beads.  The slightest movement had aggravated his energy sea, feeling like a knife twisting within.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang felt slightly better.  Examining his internal condition, he saw his depleted essence blood and the ravaged state of his energy sea and meridians, causing him to wryly smile.</p><p>Since encountering Yu Hua, he had repeatedly overtaxed his energy sea, forcibly refining and absorbing pills, and feeding his ghost with his essence blood. Although he'd had a chance to consume healing pills, it had still caused significant damage.</p><p>Now, his injuries were compounded; the state of his energy sea and meridians was horrific.</p><p>Even with medicinal pills, a complete recovery would take considerable time and nurturing.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, took out a bottle of pills, and swallowed them. As the medicinal power spread through his meridians, his injuries began to improve.</p><p>After a short period of meditation, Qin Sang awoke, looked at Yu Hua, and gathered a ball of ice water, splashing it on Yu Hua's face.</p><p>Yu Hua shivered, waking from his unconsciousness.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Yu Hua was startled, instantly realizing his predicament. He struggled, but found his entire body immobilized, his spiritual power sealed, rendering him as helpless as a mortal.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Hua quickly composed himself, a feat that impressed Qin Sang.</p><p>“Zhao Yan's death was not unjust!”</p><p>Yu Hua, even in defeat, remained defiant, his gaze dark as he stared at Qin Sang.  “Back at the Yuanzhao Sect, your cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage, right? You were just implanted with the Heart-Eating Insect by Yi Tian Nie, and then sent to the Yuanzhao Sect. How did you resist the Heart-Eating Insect Gu?”</p><p>“Want to know?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was playful.  “I won’t tell you!”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Yu Hua raged, his face reddening, gnashing his teeth. “Without killing me, you intend for me to serve you in the future? Don't delude yourself!”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  “Don’t worry, Qin will give you a swift death! However, I need to ask you a few things first, before sending you on your way.”</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished, he unleashed the spell in his palm, the Soul-Seizing Spell striking Yu Hua.</p><p>He didn’t bother to engage Yu Hua.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang sensed that Yu Hua had a death wish.  With such a cunning old demon, interrogation would be ineffective, potentially yielding false information, allowing Yu Hua to trick him in his final moments.</p><p>The Soul-Seizing Spell took effect, Yu Hua's eyes clouded momentarily, and Qin Sang seized the opportunity to question him.</p><p>Yu Hua’s cultivation was far superior to his, and the Soul-Seizing Spell's duration was limited. Qin Sang prioritized the questions he desperately needed answers to.</p><p>First, the method to counter the Heart-Eating Insect Gu.</p><p>Second, the identity, cultivation level, injuries, and the whereabouts of the remaining members of the Kuiyin Sect, specifically those at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>He was about to ask his third question when Yu Hua's eyelids suddenly rolled back, his soul rapidly decaying.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, probing Yu Hua's soul space with his spiritual sense, discovering his soul was incredibly dim and on the verge of disintegration.</p><p>Was this caused by the Nine Nether Infernal Flame?</p><p>Yu Hua's primordial spirit was decaying rapidly. Qin Sang fought against time, embedding the Corpse Talisman into Yu Hua's primordial spirit space, merging it with his spirit.</p><p>If he could successfully draw in the malignant energy and turn Yu Hua into a living corpse, Qin Sang would possess a powerful corpse puppet, significantly boosting his strength.</p><p>However, the final step in creating a living corpse was extremely difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  His current cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage; the success rate wouldn't be high. To be safe, he'd better wait until he broke through to the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Holding Yu Hua, Qin Sang stared at his neck, his brow suddenly furrowing. A strange urge surged from deep within him – a craving for blood, almost instinctive…</p><p>Qin Sang raised his arm, observing its unnatural pallor, devoid of any color, a chill running through him.</p><p>These symptoms were mentioned in Wu Shang's letter, the effects of corpse transformation.</p><p>However, Wu Shang didn't have a jade Buddha and was controlled by the Corpse Talisman; his urge was far stronger than Qin Sang's, requiring constant consumption of cultivator blood to barely fight the transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, his face devoid of panic.</p><p>The moment the Corpse Talisman touched his primordial spirit, he was certain that he could remove it using the jade Buddha if he wished.</p><p>Once the Corpse Talisman was broken, the corpse transformation should stop. If Wu Shang hadn't lied in his letter, the corpse puppet enchantment, modified by him, had a way to be reversed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was unsure. If he used the corpse path to condense a Corpse Pill, the degree of transformation would be very deep. If he became a Flying Night Rakshasa, and then broke the Corpse Talisman, could he still reverse it and return to normal?</p><p>"This path… I shouldn't choose it unless absolutely necessary."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>In his primordial spirit space, Qin Sang 'saw' the Heart-Eating Insect Gu clinging to the surface of his primordial spirit. From Yu Hua, he had learned the secret method to subdue it.</p><p>But Qin Sang suddenly didn't want to subdue it anymore.</p><p>Combined with the complete poison Gu method and the *Empty Yuan Seal*, he could suppress the Heart-Eating Insect Gu's fluctuations to a minimum.</p><p>From Yu Hua, Qin Sang learned much information.</p><p>For example, the surviving Golden Core cultivator of the Kui Yin Sect was at the early Golden Core stage, hiding near Qingyang City, severely injured and still unrecovered.</p><p>The remnants of the Kui Yin Sect under his command had adopted the alias 'Infernal Flame,' diligently searching for medicinal herbs to heal their injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his secret method, using the *Empty Yuan Seal* to seal the Heart-Eating Insect Gu.</p>
