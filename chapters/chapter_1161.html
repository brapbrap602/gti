<h1>Chapter 1153: Nascent Soul Stage</h1><p>Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed his past, recalling his journey.</p><p>Compared to his previous breakthroughs, this Nascent Soul stage seemed less arduous, almost effortless.</p><p>But reflecting on each experience, every effort and ordeal he endured for this breakthrough, which one was truly easy?</p><p>Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained this during his Qi Condensation stage.  Yi Tiannie of the Kuiyin Sect, using insect-gu techniques, controlled him, forcing him to infiltrate the Yuanzhao Sect at great risk, stealing the orchid amidst the chaos.</p><p>Even then, the herb required another five hundred years to mature.</p><p>Qin Sang thought he'd never use it in his lifetime.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yi Tiannie survived, lurking within a corpse for decades under Qin Sang’s nose, until Qin Sang unleashed the Xuantian Thunder, giving Yi Tiannie an opening to attack.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, but thanks to the Corpse Pill he’d refined, he narrowly escaped, killing Yi Tiannie and obtaining the precious Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Later, he wandered the Canglang Sea for over a hundred years, entering the Seven Killing Hall three times, finally finding a teleportation array and returning to Xiao Han Domain to cultivate the herb with the Three Lights Jade Liquid, and commissioning Yunyouzi to refine the Du E Pill for him.</p><p>Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall appeared prematurely, the amount of liquid far less than before, and with a Nascent Soul cultivator, Elder Ye of the Dongji Alliance, lurking nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang, only at the mid-Golden Core stage, collaborated with Ming Wei and traded with Su Nu, facing constant danger, using every means to seize the Soul Cleansing Liquid under the watchful eyes of everyone present.</p><p>On Yi Tian Peak, he encountered a sudden change, fleeing into a toxic swamp, nearly becoming a meal for Ya Gu.</p><p>Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>A life-bound insect-gu is a secret technique of the Witch Clan.</p><p>As a human, he lacked the Witch Clan's talent and had to give up a treasured artifact.</p><p>Without the Jade Buddha protecting him from the insect-gu turning against him, and with the extremely rare Crimson Fire Gold on his person, Qin Sang wouldn't have chosen this path, and certainly wouldn't have dared to choose the Sky Eye Butterfly as his life-bound insect-gu.</p><p>The process of acquiring the Crimson Fire Gold was fraught with peril:  a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator used as a pawn by Elder Di Que, then nearly subjected to body-snatching by Daoist Xuan Yu.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly underwent a transformation, gaining mastery over thunder, ultimately swallowing Azure Luan’s blood to reach its fourth transformation.</p><p>Body Refinement.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement", a demonic cultivation technique!</p><p>The technique, engraved on a bone flute, was divided into three parts, scattered across three cultivation worlds, eventually collected by Qin Sang.</p><p>Again, it was the Jade Buddha that enabled Qin Sang to cultivate this technique.</p><p>He visualized the Azure Luan, intensely refining his body, seeking a breakthrough by any means necessary; he infiltrated the Lan Dou Sect in the Canglang Sea, and later, at the Golden Core stage, infiltrated the Demon King’s treasury, stealing a treasure from a demon king in the transformation stage.</p><p>Of course, the more significant aspect was the "Chapter on Cultivating the Soul Sword."</p><p>The hardships during cultivation were beyond description.</p><p>Having endured all this, he finally reached this height!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled those experiences, reliving the emotions, immersing himself in the memories.</p><p>Each hurdle.</p><p>Each near-death experience.</p><p>Each joyous harvest.</p><p>…</p><p>His brow furrowed at times, then cleared, then a joyful expression appeared, the fluctuations of his emotions gradually lessened until his heart was still, finally producing boundless confidence.</p><p>Having overcome countless hardships, the Nascent Soul stage was his for the taking!</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The jade bottle opened by itself.</p><p>The Du E Pill leaped out.</p><p>Lingering mist swirled, creating an ethereal atmosphere around Qin Sang.</p><p>He closed his eyes, swallowing the pill, immediately feeling a surge of coolness spreading through his body, his true essence nearly boiling.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious, focusing on refining the pill’s power, comprehending the Dao,</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the island.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the others had been waiting for half a month.</p><p>The island remained unusually calm.</p><p>Understanding that impatience was useless, they diligently protected Qin Sang, patrolling the surrounding area periodically to prevent accidents.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>After patrolling, they returned to Bai's side, their eyes showing a degree of worry. Qin Sang had been silent, remaining unseen, making them wonder if he wasn't ready yet.</p><p>“Senior…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu opened his mouth, about to ask something, when Bai suddenly looked up, staring in the direction of the island.</p><p>The next moment, Li Yu Fu and the three demons sensed the abnormality.</p><p>A fierce wind arose, and huge waves surged!</p><p>The calm lake surface was instantly thrown into chaos.</p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth became restless, violently fluctuating, then madly surging towards the small island where Qin Sang was located, mirroring the scene of Yunyouzi’s tribulation.</p><p>“He's beginning to form his Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Bai’s face lit up, quickly making arrangements.</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the three demons dispersed.</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>Spiritual energy converged, incredibly dense, coalescing into a visible tide of spiritual power that swirled around the center of the storm, emitting muffled thunderous sounds.  Simultaneously, dark clouds gathered in the sky. Although it was daytime, the sky quickly darkened, and actual lightning appeared within the clouds.</p><p>As time passed, the phenomenon became even more spectacular.  All the spiritual energy in the world was swept up, converging towards the storm's center, accumulating more and more, its radiant light growing increasingly intense until the sky above the island seemed to become a sea of light.</p><p>Bai watched the sea of light intently, his expression showing some tension.  He knew this was the crucial moment; Qin Sang had undoubtedly already taken the Du E Dan.</p><p>Success meant the formation of the spirit infant. Failure meant an unknown wait until the next opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>The sea of light spun rapidly, its scale expanding, but it stubbornly remained aloft. Bai's expression grew increasingly grave.</p><p>Suddenly, the sea of light underwent a dramatic change.  All the luminescence frantically converged towards the center, the spiritual energy compressed to its limit, then with a ‘hum’, it plunged straight into the island!  In an instant, the sea of light dissipated, replaced by radiant霞光.</p><p>Seven-colored clouds appeared, strikingly beautiful – a sign of successful spirit infant formation!</p><p>Everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief, happy for Qin Sang, their expressions also tinged with envy and longing, hoping for a similar day for themselves.</p><p>However, the spirit infant formation was only the beginning.  The phenomenon, instead of disappearing, intensified.</p><p>On the island's peak, Qin Sang sat cross-legged with closed eyes, his body trembling slightly. Invisible dark flames appeared in the void.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang successfully formed his spirit infant, a heavenly tribulation arrived. The dark flames ignited within him, burning throughout his five organs and limbs, making him feel completely enveloped by the flames, as if his entire body would be reduced to ash.</p><p>This tribulation was not particularly difficult. Qin Sang, proficient in body refinement, had little to worry about. Although his body trembled, he silently endured the burning sensation by resisting the dark flames with his physical strength.</p><p>He had already endured the excruciating pain of the Qingluan blood essence impact, which was no less severe than this.  Qin Sang was accustomed to such pain.  He even managed to use this opportunity to refine his body further, improving his cultivation of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique by another level.</p><p>Once the dark flame tribulation ended, Qin Sang took restorative pills, and his condition quickly recovered, almost to the point of feeling unsatisfied.</p><p>The dark flames vanished, and a gray wind appeared!</p><p>Qin Sang's surroundings suddenly darkened, with the gray wind gathering around him.  He experienced the same ordeal as Yun Youzi, and a heavy feeling settled in his heart.</p>
