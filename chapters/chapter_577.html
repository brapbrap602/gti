<h1>Chapter 570: Master</h1><p>Besides this, there was nothing unusual about the courtyard.</p><p>No trace of a spirit array remained, nor were there ubiquitous, perilous ancient restrictions. Not even the shadow of an ancient beast could be seen. It was just like an ordinary courtyard, yet it existed within the mystical Purple Star Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were filled with questions, but seeing Chen Yan's coldness, they dared not ask, holding their doubts within.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light flew into the courtyard. Chen Yan caught it in her palm, her lips moved slightly, then she flicked it back.</p><p>They waited for a full quarter of an hour before a white rainbow flew in.</p><p>It turned out to be Duke Dongyang. Master Fengming, Iron Crown, and the others were nowhere to be seen, likely having started their own treasure hunts.</p><p>After Qin Sang and the others greeted him, Duke Dongyang waved them back.</p><p>“Lady Chen Yan truly cares for her juniors.”</p><p>Duke Dongyang watched them, smiling. “We owe it to Lady Chen Yan for bringing these five in safely.”</p><p>Chen Yan snorted. “You said before entering the Celestial Mountains that they would be needed to control the Five Element Beast Seals to break the formations. Naturally, I had to protect them. What do you mean by that, Daoist Dongyang?”</p><p>Duke Dongyang waved his hands. “Don’t overthink it, Lady Chen Yan. I was merely speaking casually… By the way, the Nascent Soul cultivators from both regions gathered just now. They’re eager to meet you, Lady Chen Yan, having learned of Shaohua Mountain's new Nascent Soul expert. I made excuses for you, but it's not a long-term solution.”</p><p>Chen Yan considered this. “We'll discuss matters outside the Purple Star Palace.  Will the Abyss's sudden attack affect our entry into the Celestial Mountains?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Duke Dongyang shook his head firmly. “This opportunity comes only once every few centuries. Now that we’re here, how can we leave without trying?  After we leave the Purple Star Palace, both regions will surely put aside their differences and unite against the enemy. As for the details, we can discuss them later. However…”</p><p>Duke Dongyang’s tone shifted. “The Abyss's attack might be a blessing in disguise. Old Ox-Nose self-destructed his natal magic treasure, and the other Celestial Alliance cultivators are either dead or injured. They likely won't be in any mood to compete with us, so they're not a threat. With fewer rivals, our chances are even greater. It all depends on you, Lady Chen Yan.”</p><p>Chen Yan's voice was low. “As long as you keep your promise and help me rescue my master, I will honor our agreement. I’ve already sworn an oath, so you needn’t worry.”</p><p>“I believe you are a woman of your word!”</p><p>Duke Dongyang clapped his hands and laughed, looking up at the boundless sea of clouds. “We’ve wasted a lot of time. We still need to pass through several checkpoints in the outer palace before entering the inner palace. Even with our combined strength, we must be careful with these five. If anything happens, we won’t find any replacement Foundation Establishment cultivators in this Purple Star Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stood at the edge of the courtyard, not daring to eavesdrop.</p><p>After a while, Duke Dongyang beckoned them over.</p><p>“To save time, Lady Chen Yan and I will take you directly to the inner palace. If we encounter danger, use the Five Element Beast Seals for protection and follow our commands…”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others readily agreed, memorizing Duke Dongyang’s instructions before setting off.</p><p>Duke Dongyang led the way, followed by Qin Sang’s group in formation, with Chen Yan at the rear.</p><p>The seven flew into the air, heading directly towards the depths of the Purple Star Palace. To accommodate Qin Sang and the others, their speed was moderate.</p><p>Above, clouds churned, and chaotic spiritual currents swirled. They flew just slightly higher than the ancient trees, their view widening.</p><p>Looking ahead, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of similar palace courtyards stretched out before them, arranged in an orderly, yet scattered pattern.</p><p>Most were collapsed and dilapidated, abandoned like the one they had just left.</p><p>However, some palaces remained intact, even shimmering with the light of ancient restrictions.</p><p>Beams of light, each a different color, shot skyward, hinting at extraordinary treasures within.</p><p>These palace clusters were surrounded by mountains, obscuring the view beyond.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something peculiar.</p><p>Despite the many who had entered, few dared to fly in the open air. He only saw a handful of scattered figures.</p><p>He glanced at the protective shield around him. The turbulent currents impacting the shield were easily repelled.</p><p>It seemed these currents were more dangerous than they appeared.</p><p>Duke Dongyang's objective was clear: the highest peak in the depths of the palace complex.</p><p>Unlike the other peaks, this mountain was barren and desolate, covered in rocks. It was a mountain of stone, with sheer cliffs rising vertically.</p><p>Perched on the rocks were dark figures, too distant to see clearly.</p><p>These figures seemed to be living creatures, and Qin Sang couldn’t help but steal another glance.</p><p>Layers of rocks, like the steps of a pyramid, led to a simple stone palace near the summit, strikingly prominent.</p><p>This stone palace was the only man-made structure on any of the surrounding peaks; the others were covered only with lush, ancient trees.</p><p>“Are we going into the ancient palace?” Qin Sang wondered, turning his gaze downward.</p><p>Along the way, he saw figures moving between the palaces. Although they didn’t dare to fly, their speed was impressive. Some rushed towards the intact palaces, but most, like them, were headed for the stone palace on the mountain!</p><p>Their journey was smooth until they reached the foot of the stone mountain.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang could finally see that the dark figures were vulture-like demonic beasts.</p><p>They didn’t seem powerful individually, but their numbers were staggering!</p><p>From the foot to the summit, every boulder held one, perhaps tens of thousands in total. The dense mass of dark figures was chilling.</p><p>Qin Sang was reminded of the Bloodwing Ghost-Head Wasp nest in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>This mountain was a demonic beast nest, and these vulture-like creatures were far more formidable than the wasps.</p><p>Because of the earlier delay, they weren’t the first to arrive.</p><p>Others were already ascending the mountain, using various methods to conceal their presence and aura, deceiving the beasts' senses.</p><p>One Golden Core cultivator held a black gourd, from which poured foul-smelling black smoke. The beasts, taking him for one of their own, ignored him.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang wondered what method Duke Dongyang would use, he heard a shout, “Ascend!”</p><p>Then, Duke Dongyang casually swung his sword.</p><p>Rainbow-like sword energy erupted, instantly obliterating the demonic beasts in their path, clearing a way forward!</p>
