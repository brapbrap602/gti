<h1>Chapter 1479: The Serpent Banner (4k)</h1><p>Shi Xue emphatically agreed, “Exactly, there’s no reason to separate a Daoist couple!”</p><p>Tong Lingyu lightly tapped the table, saying calmly, “Shang Zhangzuo was indeed a bit reckless.”</p><p>Yin Dianzhu and the others exchanged glances, but didn’t dare press the matter further.</p><p>Reaching the Yuan Ying stage, once a couple forms a Daoist partnership and cultivates dual cultivation techniques or secret arts, their strength becomes inextricably linked.  Separation inevitably leads to a significant loss of power.</p><p>There was truly no reason to force a Daoist couple apart.</p><p>With the support of Listening Snow Tower and the Grand Elder behind them, and Shang Lu’s own actions at the wedding ceremony, they couldn’t push too hard.</p><p>If Shang Lu sought help, allowing unrelated individuals to interfere, it would be both inappropriate and illogical. Their previous appeals to “true feelings” would become a laughingstock.</p><p>This Qingfeng Daozhang’s willingness to endure the humiliation, left them with no good options.</p><p>Yin Dianzhu and the others looked at Shang Lu, who remained silent and frowning.  They wondered if he really intended to fight two opponents alone. Unless, of course, Shang Lu could somehow find another partner right now.</p><p>To everyone’s astonishment…</p><p>Shang Lu didn’t hesitate. He stepped down from the cloud bed, moved to the platform, directly facing Qin Sang and Liuli, and nodded slightly. “Good! I accept the Daozhang’s proposal.”</p><p>He was actually going to fight two opponents!</p><p>This was completely unexpected.</p><p>While Elder Qingfeng was making his first public appearance, he already had a considerable reputation within the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>His solo infiltration of the demon's lair, the delivery of crucial intelligence that helped the Xuan Tian Palace gain a strategic advantage and avoid needless casualties, were all well-known facts.</p><p>This proved his exceptional abilities.</p><p>Liuli, the senior disciple of Listening Snow Tower’s previous sect leader and the current leader’s younger sister, certainly didn't lack cultivation techniques or divine powers; her ability to challenge opponents above her level was considered normal.</p><p>Shang Lu was essentially challenging two cultivators of the same level simultaneously.  These two were also a dual-cultivating couple, their minds and hearts connected; their combined strength was far more than a simple addition of their individual powers.</p><p>A ludicrous thought crossed everyone's minds: Could this sect leader, in charge of an entire lineage, be so emotionally entangled that this challenge was merely a way to find peace of mind?</p><p>Or perhaps, he was aiming for two birds with one stone.</p><p>Otherwise, why his persistence?</p><p>If it were solely for the dispute over the Cleansing Pool,</p><p>Shang Lu fighting two opponents, without it being a life-or-death battle, if Qingfeng Daozhang deliberately concealed his abilities, Shang Lu would be unable to gauge his true strength.  The challenge would be meaningless.</p><p>Someone glanced at the Yue cultivator who had come with Shang Lu.</p><p>This person sat calmly on the cloud bed, holding a jade cup, appearing completely composed and confident.</p><p>This raised further doubts: Had Shang Lu anticipated this situation and made preparations beforehand?</p><p>Given Shang Lu’s intelligence, it was entirely possible.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He considered the same possibility. Shang Lu’s decisiveness suggested he had some kind of advantage.</p><p>The words had already been spoken, and there was no point in backing down.</p><p>So, there was no need to refuse. He also wanted to see the skills of this Tian Shan sect leader.  It remained to be seen who would be testing whom.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a quick glance and nodded to Shi Xue.</p><p>Both sides had agreed, and no outsiders could intervene.</p><p>Shi Xue coldly glanced at Shang Lu, waved her whisk, and the northern cloud beds drifted southward, clearing the space at the north of the platform.</p><p>"Since this is a sparring match, let this cloud wall be the boundary. Anyone who falls outside it will be considered defeated."</p><p>Shi Xue waved her whisk again, creating a circular cloud wall in mid-air, large enough for three people to fight.</p><p>Shang Lu furrowed his brow, but ultimately didn’t object. He was the first to enter the enclosed space.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli followed, taking their positions at the other end, facing Shang Lu.</p><p>On the cloud beds,</p><p>excitement shone in the eyes of the guests.</p><p>No one had expected to witness not only a grand wedding ceremony, but also such an exciting event. The Tian Shan sect leader disregarding his status to participate personally—they all felt their trip was worthwhile.</p><p>They maneuvered their cloud beds to find the best viewing spots and focused their attention.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned to Yin Dianzhu, saying, “Yin Dianzhu, perhaps we should move closer to the arena and keep a close watch. Today is a joyous occasion, we must avoid the two sides getting too heated and harming the harmony of the sect.”</p><p>“Agreed!”</p><p>Yin Dianzhu moved his cloud bed closer to the cloud wall.</p><p>Tong Lingyu flew to the opposite side.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu, Shi Xue and the others also prepared themselves.</p><p>Inside the cloud wall,</p><p>Shang Lu looked deeply at Liuli and said in a low voice, "Liuli, I said before that I didn't want to fight you, and that still stands. I'll just have to restrain you for a while."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Shang Lu patted a pouch at his waist.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three white lights shot out.</p><p>This was followed by piercing, shrill howls.</p><p>The howls were like demonic sounds.  Lower-level cultivators felt a dizzying sensation, nausea, and intense discomfort upon hearing them.</p><p>“Heaven Mountain Snow Python!”</p><p>Someone gasped.</p><p>Everyone looked, and saw three white lights swelling in the wind. In an instant, they took shape above Shang Lu, transforming into three giant pythons, each over thirty feet long.</p><p>These pythons were similar in appearance, all covered in pure white scales, their crimson tongues flicking from gaping maws, their eyes fierce and terrifying.</p><p>They were nearly dragons, their aura comparable to the dragon that pulled Qin Sang's chariot.</p><p>“Three Heaven Mountain Snow Pythons, all late-stage Demon Core cultivators!  Snow Pythons are difficult to cultivate;  at this high level, there can't be many more on Heaven Mountain.  Shang Zhangzu has quite the resources; no wonder he dared to accept this challenge!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in awe.</p><p>Among the guests were many Nascent Soul masters.  Three late-stage Demon Core Snow Pythons were rare, but not enough to cause them undue concern.</p><p>However, the Heaven Mountain lineage possessed a Python Banner.  If used with the Snow Python's abilities, its power would be quite troublesome, even for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>No wonder Shang Lu was so confident!</p><p>Ignoring the onlookers, Shang Lu, having released the Snow Pythons, immediately waved his sleeve, releasing a ball of white light which transformed into a Python Banner.</p><p>The banner depicted Heaven Mountain Snow Pythons.</p><p>With the pythons hissing, the banner flew above Shang Lu, its streamers unfurling.</p><p>The Snow Pythons seemed to feel a call, their bodies thrashing violently as their massive forms shot towards the banner.</p><p>Then, a strange sight occurred.</p><p>The three pythons rapidly became translucent, like ice sculptures.  Instead of knocking the banner away when they struck it, they merged into the banner's surface and vanished.</p><p>Instantly, the Snow Python images on the banner came alive, now three more pythons.</p><p>Thick dark clouds gathered above the arena.</p><p>Each time the banner moved, it brought a bone-chilling wind, waves of cold air pouring forth as the pythons writhed on the banner, exhaling icy breath.</p><p>A blinding white wind swept across the arena, obscuring the three figures from sight.</p><p>Without a word, Shang Lu pointed at his opponent.  “Go!”</p><p>The banner spun rapidly, its momentum immense as it pressed down from the air.</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang and Liuli quickly exchanged information, understanding the situation.</p><p>Since Snow Pythons were difficult to cultivate, few had ever seen the Python Banner. Heaven Mountain cultivators usually kept only one Snow Python; Shang Lu had three.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't underestimate any opponent, especially the head of the Xuan Tian Palace lineage.</p><p>Light flickered from his fingers as the Golden Sinking Sword shot through the air.</p><p>After being reforged, the Golden Sinking Sword was completely different.  Qin Sang now wielded the sword intent of the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture," such that even if Elders Mei and Lan were present, they wouldn't easily see through the disguise.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang awakened his Heaven's Eye Butterfly to search for weaknesses in the Python Banner.</p><p>The spiritual sword flew out.</p><p>The Python Banner, carrying the icy wind, attacked.</p><p>Qin Sang originally intended to use his sword to protect Liuli, both to gauge the banner's strength and prevent Shang Lu from attacking them separately, thus giving Liuli a chance to act.</p><p>However, he heard Liuli's voice.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his mind.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword's momentum shifted, releasing an extreme sharpness. A breathtaking sword light suddenly slashed out, brilliant and dazzling.</p><p>This unyielding sword intent, so pure, moved the onlookers.</p><p>This was the swordsmanship of Green Bamboo.</p><p>He had broken through to Nascent Soul on his own, his swordsmanship gradually freeing itself from the constraints of the "Soul Cultivation Sword Chapter," merging with his personality. The last few moves of the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" were his masterpiece.</p><p>This was one of those moves.</p><p>The "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" lacked the power of the original scripture’s sword array, but it was undoubtedly a powerful sword technique, a pity that Green Bamboo died young before reaching his peak.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword pierced the void, its light like a cold moon, directly targeting the Python Banner.</p><p>The icy air surged, but it couldn't hinder it in the slightest.</p><p>The Python Banner flapped, the Snow Pythons restless, writhing on the banner, wildly exhaling cold air.</p><p>The cold air condensed into a jade-white light.</p><p>‘Pff!’</p><p>The sword light arrived, piercing the jade-white light.</p><p>The next moment, the sword light and the jade-white light both dissipated, without any earth-shattering spectacle, simply vanishing into nothingness, returning to calm.</p><p>After this attack, Qin Sang gained a clearer understanding of the power of the Serpent Flag.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>The Serpent Flag relentlessly unleashed another wave of jade-white light, vanishing into the biting wind.  Instantly, countless spectral snow serpents materialized in the void, clawing and snapping at them.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  Just as he was about to raise his sword to defend, his expression shifted. His sword technique changed; he reversed the Golden Sinking Sword and slashed downwards.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sharp sound resonated. A jade ruler solidified from nothingness.  Simultaneously, the void rippled, and a figure was forced into view – Shang Lu.</p><p>Once the Serpent Flag was deployed, it could be controlled by the snow serpents, allowing Shang Lu to focus on Qin Sang.  He secretly manipulated the jade ruler to close in, but Qin Sang detected his movements.</p><p>Even without the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang's spiritual sense was easily able to perceive the approaching ruler.</p><p>After the Sky-Eye Butterfly broke through to the mid-fourth stage, its Sky-Eye abilities improved significantly. Qin Sang had personally tested its enhanced power.  If the butterfly had possessed this level of power when they entered the Jing Hai Sect, he certainly could have discovered the 混魔老人 before he was detected.</p><p>Of course, the spiritual awareness of a Grand Cultivator is exceptionally keen; the Sky-Eye Butterfly needed to maintain a certain distance and could not stare openly.</p><p>Shang Lu’s spiritual sense was far inferior to that of a Grand Cultivator. His action was instantly exposed; Qin Sang merely reacted a fraction of a second slower.</p><p>Forced to reveal himself, Shang Lu showed no sign of frustration, a slight smile playing on his lips instead.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed, and he propelled himself into the air.  The moment he moved, lotus petals condensed around him, sharp as blades. They whirled around him, transforming into a blizzard of ice, attempting to cut him down.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, escaping unharmed. However, Shang Lu had achieved his goal of dividing his opponent's attention.</p><p>The Serpent Flag appeared overhead, snow serpents raising their heads.  Jade-white light swirled, forming a vortex in the void, within which a figure, vaguely visible, could be seen.</p><p>The phoenix-shaped sword hung defensively.  The snow serpents pressed their attack, the jade-white light continuously generating sword qi, making it difficult to break free from the Serpent Flag’s hold.</p><p>"Now we can focus on our sparring," Shang Lu said, glancing at the figure entangled by the Serpent Flag, a smile on his face.</p><p>"Sect Master Shang has impressive methods," Qin Sang replied, his expression unwavering. His words trailed off as he attacked with his sword.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the Golden Sinking Sword unleashed three powerful sword beams, each as potent as the first.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The three beams, arranged in a triangular formation, appeared before Shang Lu in an instant.</p><p>Shang Lu, his gaze now serious, responded, "Remarkable swordsmanship!"</p><p>He then pointed at the jade ruler. The ruler shot forth, abruptly expanding into a giant staff, intercepting the three sword beams and smashing down with immense force.</p><p>Such a blow, if it landed squarely, would not only shatter the sword beams but also damage the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang remained suspended in the air, expressionless.  Meanwhile, the Sky-Eye Butterfly was focusing on the Serpent Flag, searching for weaknesses.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his engagement with Shang Lu. With a thought, he merged the three sword beams.</p><p>From the viewing platforms, the onlookers instinctively squinted, seeing only a blinding column of light, powerful enough to pierce the heavens, clashing fiercely with the jade ruler.  The path of Qingzhu allowed for no retreat.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening thunderous roar shook the ground. The viewing platforms trembled, and the hearts of the spectators pounded as they waited anxiously for the outcome.</p><p>The blinding light dissipated. Qin Sang and Shang Lu remained standing, seemingly evenly matched.</p><p>However, the guests understood this was merely the appetizer; both were still probing, holding back their most formidable abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang did not look at Shang Lu. His gaze fell upon the Golden Sinking Sword.  In the next moment, the sword vanished, replaced by countless points of starlight, transforming into a sea of sword beams.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his hand forward, causing waves in the sword sea; ten thousand swords surged, radiating a destructive aura, towards Shang Lu.</p><p>Shang Lu's eyes flickered. Knowing his opponent possessed formidable swordsmanship, he wanted to test their skills.</p><p>After glancing at the other side, confirming that the figure would not be able to break free from the Serpent Flag anytime soon, Shang Lu waved his hand; the jade ruler multiplied into countless pieces, engaging Qin Sang in a chaotic fight.</p><p>Sword beams and ruler shadows clashed and intertwined everywhere.  Qin Sang continually altered his sword technique, the Golden Sinking Sword humming, engaging the jade ruler in countless exchanges; neither gained the upper hand.</p><p>Shang Lu’s expression grew increasingly relaxed; a smirk played on his lips as he sneered,</p><p>"Is this the limit of your swordsmanship?"</p><p>As the words left his mouth, a faint *click-click* sound suddenly arose.</p><p>The sound was almost imperceptible, but to Shang Lu, it was like thunder.</p><p>Shang Lu's face turned pale; he abruptly turned towards the Serpent Flag.</p>
