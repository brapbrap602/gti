<h1>Chapter 619: The Witch Insect List (Extra chapter for the盟主,  Da Hongzao's Mother!)</h1><p>The Strange Insect List is merely a compilation made by the Imperial Spirit Sect, based on the experience of senior cultivators and referencing ancient texts unearthed from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Sect is renowned for its beast-controlling techniques. Qin Sang even suspects that the Imperial Spirit Sect was established by the Sky Demon Mound, with disciples specializing in insect control being only a part of it.</p><p>“Don’t you think they resemble Blood Winged Hornets?”</p><p>Qin Sang walked to a Blood Winged Hornet corpse.</p><p>This Blood Winged Hornet’s blood wings were completely burned, leaving only its round body.</p><p>Yuan Hu looked down for a while, thoughtfully saying, “Now that you mention it, it does resemble the Blood Winged Hornet ranked 520th on the Witch Insect List. I wonder why it mutated and developed blood wings. Blood Winged Hornets have long since disappeared from the Western Frontier; how could they suddenly reappear, and as mutants?”</p><p>Yuan Hu turned to the Tianyue Village priest, “Great Priestess, before these strange hornets appeared, did you notice any other abnormalities?”</p><p>The Great Priestess shook her head, “Hunters from the village discovered that the surrounding prey had disappeared. They followed the tracks here and saw the hornets building their nest. We tried several times, but we couldn’t defeat them, so we sent a message to the Five Insects Sect for help.  The area around here is all Tianyue Village's hunting ground, and there were no abnormalities before. These hornets seem to have appeared suddenly.”</p><p>It seems that the Witch Insect List also includes Blood Winged Hornets, but it's quite different from the Imperial Spirit Sect's Strange Insect List.</p><p>The Witch Insect List seems to have a clear ranking for spirit insects.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Sect, however, doesn't. Their Strange Insect List only lists a catalog, with descriptions of the characteristics of strange insects. Some are simply retellings of legends from ancient texts, without any absolute ranking.</p><p>On the Strange Insect List, the Imperial Spirit Sect gives a high evaluation to the Blood Winged Hornet.</p><p>According to an ancient text, the cultivation world has seen several instances of Blood Winged Hornets undergoing transformation, achieving strength comparable to Yuan Ying cultivators, and even possessing the potential for further transformation.</p><p>Because of this, the Blood Winged Hornet is qualified to be included in the Strange Insect List.</p><p>However, the Witch Insect List seems to place less importance on the Blood Winged Hornet, ranking it several hundred places lower.</p><p>What criteria does the Witch Insect List use?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>“There are quite a few larvae in the nest. Giving you two wouldn't be a problem.  However, I don't have a container for spirit insects. If you have an extra one, could you sell it to me?”</p><p>“I happen to have a white bamboo insect basket; I’ll trade it for two larvae.”</p><p>Yuan Hu's face lit up, and he took out a slender-necked bamboo basket, meticulously woven – a specialized container for spirit insects.</p><p>Out of goodwill, Yuan Hu reminded Qin Sang, “You don't even have an insect basket, so it seems you don't specialize in insect cultivation. If you plan to use these strange hornets as your lifebound insect Gu in the future, you should carefully consider it.  The transformation of spirit insects is already difficult, and mutations may affect their transformation. In severe cases, they may even lose the ability to transform.  Each person can only have one lifebound insect Gu, and it requires immense effort to cultivate. If you discover something is wrong later, and want to change, you will have to start all over again, which will greatly delay your progress!”</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt that lifebound insect Gu was similar to lifebound artifacts.</p><p>Except for special cultivation methods like the *Metaphysical Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter*, each cultivator can only have one lifebound artifact.  Could lifebound insect Gu also occupy a lifebound artifact slot?</p><p>Two against one sounds good.</p><p>However, if the lifebound insect Gu cannot transform in time and cannot keep up with the cultivator's own strength, it will become useless.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, thanking Yuan Hu for his kindness.</p><p>He had been raising Blood Winged Hornets for so many years and already suspected that in order to survive in the Wuyagou Valley, the Blood Winged Hornets had mutated, but at the cost of losing their potential for transformation.</p><p>Putting the nest into the white bamboo insect basket, Qin Sang bid farewell to the three and traveled west.</p><p>On the geomantic map, Bear Mountain and the Five Insects Sect are located in the northwest.</p><p>The entire Bear Mountain region is very barren; mountains with spirit veins are rare, and those with well-developed spirit veins are almost all occupied by large villages ruled by shamans and priests.</p><p>These large villages are like small countries within the Xiaohan Domain, each controlling a large area; however, the number of their subjects is far fewer than in the Xiaohan Domain – they are mostly villages similar to Thousand-Household Villages of ordinary people.</p><p>The Thousand-Household Village is affiliated with a large village called the Winged Viper Village.</p><p>These large villages are intertwined and interconnected; affecting one will affect all.  Qin Sang's injuries were not yet healed, so he didn't want to be too high-profile and cause conflict with local forces.</p><p>West of the Bear Mountain region, deeper into the Western Frontier, the terrain becomes even more treacherous and difficult to survive in; some unclaimed spirit veins are occupied by demonic beasts.</p><p>With the strength of the Flying Night Rakshasa, seizing a cave dwelling would not be difficult.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A dark shadow plummeted from the sky, crashing heavily onto the rocks.  Feathers scattered.</p><p>It was a large black eagle, its wings spanning at least thirty feet, a majestic creature. A powerful mid-stage spirit beast, the king of the surrounding beasts.  The eagle was skilled in escape techniques, incredibly fast.  An ordinary False Core cultivator would likely struggle to catch it if it truly fled.</p><p>But it had the misfortune of encountering Qin Sang and the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The impact dazed the eagle. As it staggered to its feet, a shadowy figure appeared like a ghost.  Before the eagle could react, a spectral hand seized its neck. A sharp crack, and the beast was dead.</p><p>From the mountaintop, Qin Sang watched the Flying Night Rakshasa effortlessly slay the beast.  He instructed it to bring the corpse and guard the cave entrance while he entered.</p><p>The mountain's spirit vein was decent, more than sufficient for his alchemy.  With everything prepared, Qin Sang planned to remain secluded until he successfully formed his Core.</p><p>The eagle's death was silent and unnoticed; none knew the cave's master had changed. The Flying Night Rakshasa stood guard at the entrance like a stone statue.</p><p>Inside, Qin Sang sat cross-legged in meditation.  Thanks to spirit pills and cultivation, his spiritual sense had mostly recovered. But he couldn't wait any longer. He awoke from his meditative state, his hand flipping open a jade box.</p><p>Inside lay a purple spirit fruit, encircled by cloud-like patterns, exuding a rich, strange fragrance—the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit!</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box and traced the fruit with his finger, his expression shifting, a mixture of emotion crossing his face.  The price he paid for his Foundation Establishment, the trials and tribulations he endured… finally, he could make amends.</p><p>He owed this fruit to Yun Youzi.  He wondered if the old man had overcome his tribulation, and how he fared.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang tilted his head back and swallowed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit whole. He then channeled his spiritual sense into his ebony sword, absorbing the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth to refine the fruit.</p><p>The fruit's skin was incredibly tough.  Combined with his restricted spiritual energy, he could only rely on killing talismans, slowing the refining process considerably.</p><p>It took a full half-day before Qin Sang finally refined the fruit. The fruit transformed into an extremely pure medicinal energy, merging into his body.</p><p>Qin Sang had consumed the Profound Pattern Harmony Pills and other elixirs, healing nine-tenths of his injuries.  Yet, a seemingly insurmountable gap remained.  No matter what he tried, he couldn't fully recover.</p><p>Now, nourished by the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, his foundation was finally completely restored!</p>
