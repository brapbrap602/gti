<h1>Chapter 1697: Firefly</h1><p>The poison beads, including the earlier fat silkworms, have limited uses due to their single function.  Obtaining poison immunity would change things dramatically.</p><p>Also, there's the *Tianjue Danghun Divine Needle* obtained from the Strange-Faced Man. Qin Sang still vividly remembers the needle's power. If she could refine it using the poison from the beads, it would be another extremely lethal weapon.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang was immediately excited. She immediately asked Gui Mu for advice on refining the poison beads. She learned that refining the poison beads and absorbing the Gu King weren't quick tasks, and could only be done gradually.</p><p>Next, they discussed setting off as soon as possible to send Qin Sang's main body to Luye for healing, lest unforeseen complications arise.</p><p>More importantly, Gui Mu's preparations were nearly complete, and she was eager to begin.  She only waited for Ya Gu to stabilize before crossing the void.</p><p>Time was of the essence.</p><p>That night, everyone decided to depart.</p><p>They deliberately avoided the Central Plains and the major sect settlements, choosing dangerous and difficult terrain to remain hidden.</p><p>Apart from Qin Sang's injured main body, Gui Mu, Liuli, and the avatar were all top-tier experts. The difficulties along the way posed no obstacle; they proceeded smoothly to the Northern Wastelands.</p><p>The Northern Wastelands are sparsely populated and a melting pot of people.  Once there, they would be relatively safe. As long as they didn't encounter the two tribes' Nascent Soul cultivators head-on, Qin Sang's main body's safety could be ensured.</p><p>Shen Chen had moved Luye nearby earlier.  They found the ‘anchor point’, boarded Luye, and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The Northern Wastelands cultivators were completely unaware that a massive object was floating above them.  Judging by its direction, it was heading towards the North Sea.</p><p>Shortly after sending Qin Sang back, Liuli took her leave.</p><p>Her separation from the nuns of the Yan Yue Monastery was abrupt. She was previously protecting Qin Sang and couldn't contact them, so she needed to return quickly to deliver the inheritance of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect and reassure everyone.</p><p>During this time, Liuli specifically visited Ya Gu, but Ya Gu hadn't awakened, so Liuli could only offer silent blessings.</p><p>She had already returned the Bingyi Divine Disk to Qin Sang.</p><p>Her and Qin Sang's avatar's cultivation bases were similar but different.</p><p>The avatar followed Qin Sang's past methods, prioritizing breakthroughs and actively approaching the cold煞 energy within the Bingyi Divine Disk. Liuli, however, consistently adhered to her own path, using the disk only as a reference, and thus her comprehension of the cold煞 energy didn't take long.</p><p>Even so, she gained considerable insight and was eager to return to seclusion.</p><p>“This is Luye's token. The anchor point on the token won’t change. In the future, Madam only needs to bring the token there, and the Luye formation will sense it.”</p><p>Qin Sang's main body specially came out of seclusion, produced a black iron token, and gave it to Liuli. Then he said, “I plan to set up a formation in Luye, imitating the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, to nurture the Bingyi Divine Disk and the Fire Rhinoceros Bead, and refine the Taiji Celestial Stage, hoping to achieve Nascent Soul.  Being able to bring this formation out of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect was all thanks to Madam’s help; I wouldn't dare to enjoy it alone.  After Madam's breakthrough, remember to prepare for the refining of the Ice and Fire Token.”</p><p>He had already obtained the memories of Old Man Yanshan from Su Zinan.</p><p>It turned out that the two ice boxes Old Man Yanshan took from the Snowfield Tomb back then contained a Water-Phase Token and a record of the tribulation-crossing formation, as well as part of the Water-Phase inheritance.</p><p>Qin Sang thus learned the true names of the Bingyi Divine Disk and the Fire Rhinoceros Bead, and the methods for refining the Taiji Celestial Stage and the Ice and Fire Token, saving himself a lot of effort in personal comprehension.</p><p>After the windstorm subsides, it won’t be too late to look for materials for refining.</p><p>As for the Bingyi Divine Disk and Fire Rhinoceros Bead, as long as the formation maintains and continuously replenishes their power, they can not only protect one person during a tribulation, but also benefit relatives and descendants, serving as the foundation of a sect.</p><p>The tribulation-crossing formation is unnamed. The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect usually calls it ‘Overcoming Three Calamities.’  This formation was also pieced together by the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect using various treasures. It has been proven to protect against the Three Calamities, and even has a certain effect on Nascent Soul Tribulations.</p><p>Of course, it can also be used for Core Formation Tribulations.</p><p>However, because replenishing the energy of the two treasures takes time, the Ice and Fire Token can only be used once, and the Taiji Celestial Stage also risks being destroyed in the tribulation.  Moreover, the Ice and Fire Token and the Celestial Stage are extremely difficult to refine, so the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect established a rule that disciples must advance to Nascent Soul before using them.</p><p>Qin Sang often wondered if the outcome would have been different if Yunyouzi had had this formation to protect him during his tribulation.</p><p>Watching Liuli leave.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, turning to return to his cave.</p><p>He then saw Gui Mu, who had appeared at some point, leaning against a tree, arms crossed, pursing her lips.  “Gone?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Gui Mu clicked her tongue, slightly curious. “What a frosty beauty. How did you get her, you little rascal?”</p><p>Gui Mu immediately saw that there was a significant problem between Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>It wasn't that she sensed the mark of the demonic technique, but rather, the couple's awkward behavior was simply too obvious to someone as perceptive as she was.  Ghost Mother found it unsettling.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment, then asked, "I hear there is a method of achieving enlightenment through the seven emotions. But if those emotions become disordered and one is manipulated, how can one find liberation?"</p><p>Ghost Mother, shrewd as she was, understood his implication immediately.  Her lips curved into a slight smile. "Unblocking is better than blocking."</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, thinking about Lili and the demonic mark. He and Ghost Mother had just discussed it.</p><p>Even Ghost Mother had no better solution for the demonic mark.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Ghost Mother’s meaning, and he believed Lili would too. For example, Dongyang Bo’s technique of achieving enlightenment through killing one's husband.  Using the demonic mark for something might not only solve the problem, but also bring benefits.  Qin Sang wouldn't sacrifice himself, of course, but he could adapt the idea.</p><p>However, this was wishful thinking. They couldn't truly understand the extent of the demonic mark's influence on Lili.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that Lili's rejection of his help, her deliberate distancing, wasn't solely due to the demonic mark; she might have developed a mental demon, unbeknownst to herself.</p><p>Such a mental demon could only be overcome through self-realization. Qin Sang's interference would only backfire.</p><p>A soft sigh echoed through the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped dwelling on these matters. With a wave of his hand, he brought out all the remaining possessions of the deceased Witch Clan cultivator, arranging them before him.</p><p>Some of these treasures were commonly used by both races. Qin Sang practiced the Witch Clan's natal insect-蛊 technique and could use some of them. But most were deeply imbued with the Witch Clan's mark, so he set them aside.</p><p>After sorting through everything, only two star platforms remained.</p><p>On Mount Di Shou, Qin Sang had worried that merging the platforms might cause unusual phenomena.  Now, with the ship Lu Ye having drifted into the uninhabited northern wilderness, he no longer had such concerns.</p><p>Qin Sang left the cave, set up an array around it, and placed the two star platforms before him.</p><p>He extended his hands above the platforms, sensing their connection to the stars. The familiar feeling reminded him of the "Celestial Demon Transformation Technique," a practice he'd long abandoned.</p><p>He didn't intend to resume it, however. He would continue refining the demonic fire and practicing the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique. Healing didn't interfere with refining his spiritual awareness.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Qin Sang brought his hands together, merging the star platforms.</p><p>Surprisingly, they instantly fused, a dazzling starlight erupting from the crack between them as the two platforms' power began to merge spontaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need to do anything.</p><p>The anticipated cataclysmic event didn't occur.</p><p>Soon, the starlight dimmed.  Qin Sang looked closely and found that the crack in the center had vanished. They were now a single, perfectly round stone platform.</p><p>A faint starlight still shimmered around it, as before.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then moved, sitting cross-legged on the platform.  He activated the "Celestial Demon Transformation Technique," feeling that the speed at which he absorbed stellar energy was faster than before, but otherwise there were no changes.</p><p>Black Serpent Ancestor's prized disciple infiltrated major human sects to steal the star platforms. The deceased Witch Clan cultivator carried them to Central Plains.  If the platforms were that simple, it would have been a pointless endeavor.</p><p>Qin Sang was clueless, unable to unlock the platforms' secrets.</p><p>One day, Lu Ye drifted into the North Sea, stopping at a very ordinary stone island.</p><p>Located in the western North Sea, in the far northwest corner of Central Plains, it was remote and perpetually battered by storms, deserted, yet chosen by Ghost Mother as her ascension location.</p><p>Ghost Mother triggered the restriction on Qin Sang's cave dwelling to relay the message.</p><p>She had decided to immediately set up the ascension array, aiming to ascend within a month.</p><p>While Qin Sang had anticipated this, the suddenness still left him somewhat melancholic.  He welcomed Ghost Mother inside and brought out the deceased Witch Clan cultivator's belongings for her to choose from.</p><p>It was less a gift for Ghost Mother and more for Ya Gu's protection.</p><p>Ghost Mother understood this perfectly and didn't hesitate.</p><p>"Quite the stash..."</p><p>She picked and chose, taking some items and returning several to Qin Sang.  "You cultivate our clan's natal insect-蛊, refine these according to my instructions, and they'll be useful. Take this Impurity-Removing Pearl, for example. After refining it, have your butterfly swallow it. You two can jointly control it, significantly enhancing its power.  And this Green Spirit Stake—its crude craftsmanship has preserved the Green Spirit Mushroom's properties. Extract it; it'll greatly accelerate your cultivation of the 'Pan Hu True Scripture' spirit-feeding technique…"</p><p>Ghost Mother readily offered guidance, and Qin Sang carefully noted it all.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't fully grasped the *Pan Hu Zhen Jing* before his master ascended. He could only vaguely remember Gui Mu's words, promising to understand them later.</p><p>Next, improving the Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation was paramount.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang took out the Xingtai and asked Gui Mu to examine it.</p><p>Returning to the Canglang Sea was currently impractical.</p><p>Although he had a sea chart, the storm zone was teeming with crazed beasts, making it extremely dangerous.  Qin Sang couldn't guarantee the same luck as last time.</p><p>In his hands, the Xingtai could only aid in cultivating the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique; it couldn't be used to draw stellar energy for breakthroughs, falling short of his expectations and remaining unused.</p><p>If the Xingtai could help in the breakthrough to the Transcendence stage, keeping it hidden would be foolish.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Gui Mu took the Xingtai, examining it closely, her brows furrowed.  “Are you sure this is an artifact of our clan?”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled and explained the origins of the two Xingtai.</p><p>Gui Mu pondered for a moment, then said, “Our clan possesses numerous magical treasures related to stellar energy, but I have no memory of one with a similar energy signature to this Xingtai. Of course, not only is my cultivation sealed, but my memory is also severely fragmented; this part may have been erased.  There seem to be different clans in the Upper Realm Wu tribe, each with distinct inheritances. This could be a treasure from any of them, depending on the bloodline of the main Canglang Sea Wu clan branch. However, in my opinion, two other possibilities are most likely…”</p><p>“One: this treasure is unrelated to our clan.  I recall you mentioning that the Canglang Sea Wu clan's lineage is incomplete, forcing them to cultivate human techniques.  They might all be outsiders. Two: this treasure is incomplete, lacking a key component, thus preventing both of us from activating its internal restrictions.”</p><p>With that, Gui Mu tossed the Xingtai back to Qin Sang.  Except for traversing the void, nothing else interested her.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the Xingtai, lost in thought. It seemed the mystery could only be solved upon his return to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Stone Island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gui Mu stood side-by-side, gazing at a pool of water with serious expressions.</p><p>His transformed self led the Mingyue Guards in patrolling the perimeter; Shen Chen moved Lu Ye to a distance as instructed.</p><p>A bamboo bed floated in the pool. Ya Gu, dressed elegantly, lay peacefully on it, her expression serene, asleep.  A faint image appeared on her forehead—the Fat Silkworm, its body writhing, seeming to bid farewell to Qin Sang.  Gui Mu had been quite thorough in her recent examinations, making it quite thin.</p><p>The water was still.</p><p>An earthen altar had been erected around the pool, with a large formation laid out.</p><p>All preparations were complete.</p><p>“Begin.”</p><p>Gui Mu said softly.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, gave Ya Gu one last look, and slowly stepped back.</p><p>Gui Mu ascended the altar, gazing at the heavens.</p><p>It was late at night, moonless, with a myriad of stars across the sky.</p><p>Until midnight.</p><p>Gui Mu lowered her gaze, nodded to Qin Sang, and suddenly raised her arms.</p><p>There was no sound, yet Qin Sang’s heart pounded, drawn into a strange rhythm.</p><p>A sacrificial dance!</p><p>Gui Mu held her arms high, her body twisting as if to embrace the heavens. After a brief pause, she exploded into even more powerful movements.</p><p>Under the night sky, Gui Mu moved like a serpent, each motion imbued with a unique rhythm, harmonizing with nature.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively held his breath, almost losing himself in it, when he heard the sound of wind and thunder.  He looked up to see clouds gathering in the sky, lightning flashing, followed by falling rain.</p><p>Heaven and earth responded to Gui Mu's dance!</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>The pool remained undisturbed. The altar emitted a strange light, continuously gathering towards the bamboo bed, becoming increasingly radiant, as if all the light in the world was shining on Ya Gu!</p><p>Gui Mu completed her final pose, stamping her foot on the altar.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The altar, Stone Island, and the surrounding sea trembled violently, the heavens responding with thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly looked up, surprised to find that the Milky Way seemed to tremble, the stars flashing briefly.</p><p>The next moment, Gui Mu's body stiffened, a stream of light shooting from her forehead and into Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the crucial moment had arrived; he held his breath. The light at the center of the altar became blindingly bright, and the bamboo bed gradually turned transparent, then vanished.</p><p>When the light reached its peak intensity…</p><p>Ya Gu and the bamboo bed disappeared.</p><p>“Next time we meet, remember to call her by her real name.”</p><p>Gui Mu's voice echoed in Qin Sang's ears, ethereal and melancholic.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the center of the altar, suddenly noticing a glimmer of light.</p><p>Like a firefly, it flew above his head, circling and lingering.</p><p>Qin Sang tilted his head, feeling a coolness on his cheek.  He touched it with his finger; it felt wet, causing his heart to tighten.</p><p>The next moment, the light shot upward, fast as lightning, its speed exceeding description.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the light shot into the heavens, disappearing into the myriad stars.</p>
