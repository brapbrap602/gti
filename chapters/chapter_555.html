<h1>Chapter 548: Spirit Tide</h1><p>The stone hall's massive doors were tightly shut.  Moonstones, embedded in the surrounding walls, emitted a soft luminescence, illuminating the vast interior.  Scattered throughout the hall were meditation cushions and other items, upon which cultivators of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace sat in deep meditation.</p><p>Several Shangyuan Qingjing Palace cultivators stood near a teleportation formation, explaining the situation to the newly arrived cultivators.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, the Spirit Tide is currently at its peak. Please wait here in the hall until it subsides, at which point we will escort you to Hanging Skull Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang, among the first to arrive, having experienced this before, was in better shape than his previous teleportation.  He nodded to the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace cultivators, found a corner, and after a brief meditation, fully recovered.</p><p>He remembered his last arrival coinciding with a celestial phenomenon. Back then, the grand formation here could protect the entire valley. Now, everyone was huddled inside the stone hall. The Spirit Tide's power truly lived up to its reputation.</p><p>The stone hall constantly trembled. The seven-colored protective light on the stone doors flickered erratically, demonstrating the intensity of the onslaught outside.</p><p>The unknown is the most terrifying.</p><p>Unable to see what was happening outside and with the barrier on the stone doors appearing so fragile, everyone felt uneasy.</p><p>Qin Sang rose and approached the cultivator who appeared to be in charge. The man, dressed like a middle-aged Daoist priest, was clean-shaven and at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Brother. I am Qin Sang of Shaohua Mountain.”</p><p>Shaohua Mountain and Shangyuan Qingjing Palace were close, and their disciples often addressed each other as Senior Brother.</p><p>The man sized up Qin Sang, then suddenly seemed to recognize him, cupping his hands in greeting. "No wonder you look familiar! You are the renowned Shadowless Sword, Senior Brother Qin! I am Chen Kuicing. It is an honor to meet you, Senior Brother Qin.”</p><p>“You flatter me…”</p><p>Qin Sang keenly noticed something odd in Chen Kuicing’s eyes when he heard his name.</p><p>Not only Chen Kuicing, but several other Shangyuan Qingjing Palace disciples also reacted similarly. Those with less stable minds showed even more pronounced expressions.</p><p>This oddity wasn't respect or admiration; it definitely wasn't directed at the reputation of the Shadowless Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this look yesterday and guessed the reason.</p><p>The renowned Shadowless Sword, rumored to be the strongest cultivator below the Golden Core realm in Shaohua Mountain, was considered one of the most promising Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Small Cold Region to achieve Golden Core.</p><p>Back then, his cultivation wasn't even at the pseudo-Golden Core realm.</p><p>Later, in the battle at Pointing Sky Peak, he bravely seized the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, two rare medicinal herbs, attracting the envy of countless people.</p><p>In the eyes of others, Shadowless Sword's consumption of these two spirit herbs guaranteed his ascension to Golden Core, adding another Golden Core expert to Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Unexpectedly, two years ago, news suddenly spread from Shaohua Mountain that Shadowless Sword had failed to form his Golden Core after consuming the spirit herbs, causing an uproar.</p><p>“What a waste!”</p><p>Whenever this matter was mentioned, countless people lamented, cursing and wishing they could take his place.  Rumor had it that even some Shaohua Mountain disciples felt the same.</p><p>Reputation can be a burden!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head in resignation.</p><p>He had performed well in the Chaotic Islands, but he maintained a low profile. His two magical treasures weren't suitable for open use, and he hadn't been so flashy.  Somehow, he had become famous.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his own limitations. Back then, without using the Ebony Sword, he wasn't the strongest.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain alone had many direct disciples of Golden Core cultivators.  These individuals had abundant resources and the protection of their masters, eliminating the need to risk their lives on the battlefield for advancement.</p><p>This fame had granted him access to Pointing Sky Peak, but it also placed him in the spotlight, with countless people watching for him to fail.</p><p>Just wait until I return from the Ziwei Palace, and I'll make your jaws drop!  Qin Sang thought, pretending to be oblivious to their thoughts, maintaining a calm demeanor. "In Senior Brother Chen’s opinion, how long will this Spirit Tide last? I remember there’s still some distance to Hanging Skull Pass. I wonder if the journey is perilous?"</p><p>No matter how low Qin Sang had fallen, they wouldn't dare to insult him.</p><p>Chen Kuicing and the others only dared to harbor these thoughts inwardly, outwardly displaying great respect.</p><p>“In reply to Senior Brother Qin, the Spirit Tide has been brewing almost continuously. Fortunately, it has ebbs and flows. Essentially, every few days, there's a brief lull. You can only travel to Hanging Skull Pass during these lulls. Don't worry about safety en route. The Hanging Skull Guard also ventures out during these lulls to clear out Cloud Beasts, preventing them from accumulating into a threat.  Their patrol route happens to pass by here.  Should any unforeseen circumstances arise…”</p><p>Chen Kuicing paused, subtly gesturing towards the depths of the stone hall.  “Our Martial Uncle will surely intervene.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood. There was a Golden Core expert from Shangyuan Qingjing Palace stationed here.</p><p>It wasn't surprising. This ancient teleportation formation was of significant importance and couldn't be compromised.</p><p>…</p><p>After patiently waiting for two more days in the stone hall, the tremors noticeably weakened.</p><p>Alerted, everyone rose and gathered before the stone doors.</p><p>The vibrations gradually subsided, and the barrier stabilized. However, Chen Kuicing still made them wait for another two hours before opening the doors.</p><p>"Everyone, follow me!" Chen Kuicing said with a strange smile.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>As the doors opened, a gust of wind surged in. The first few Foundation Establishment cultivators gasped, staggered by the force, and nearly fell.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to rush out of the stone hall, then was startled.</p><p>Before him was a flat expanse.</p><p>The valley he remembered was reduced to half a cliff behind him, the other half somehow leveled!</p><p>The Spirit Tide was terrifying, even altering the terrain.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air, bracing himself against the wind, silently observing.</p><p>Apart from the incessant wind, there were no thunderbolts, heavenly fire, or blizzards, phenomena Qin Sang had become accustomed to. It appeared less menacing than the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>But looking up at the sky revealed the truth.</p><p>Above, multicolored, ethereal lights filled the sky, constantly shifting and changing. These lights permeated the entire sky, and upon closer inspection, they were revealed to be the reflections of extremely condensed spiritual energy, resembling a tidal wave.</p><p>Gazing further ahead, the picture became clearer.</p><p>Where heaven met earth, spiritual energy surged like a tide, vast as the sea, boundless and magnificent.</p><p>The immense waves collided, piling higher and higher, eventually forming towering waves that crashed in all directions, wreaking havoc.</p><p>Everyone felt as if a true ocean hung above them, about to pour down from the sky!</p><p>As the giant waves raged, a deafening roar erupted, making their hearts pound.</p><p>The Spirit Tide brought not only a breathtaking spectacle but also a terrifying pressure.</p><p>An omnipresent pressure from above and below made them feel as if they couldn't breathe.</p><p>There was also a profound sense of helplessness.</p><p>Only then did they realize how small and fragile they were in the face of true celestial power.</p>
