<h1>Chapter 2150 The Tai Xu Golden Book</h1><p>“Back then, when the Real Person used their Dharma body, the thunder seal technique they used… could it be activated using the Thunder Altar?”</p><p>Shaoshi asked.</p><p>During the great battle with Lu Wang, the thunder talismans Qin Sang used were mostly suitable for large-scale battles. Even within the Imperial family, only a handful of cultivators qualified to enter the Sacred Grounds, limiting the use of these talismans.</p><p>Even if they subdued a group of ferocious beasts within the Sacred Grounds, it would be difficult to train them into a well-disciplined army in a short time.</p><p>“There are ferocious beasts in the Sacred Grounds?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, secretly wondering if the Yi Ren clan's Sacred Grounds were similar to the Nether Sea in the Talisman Realm.</p><p>Shaoshi chuckled, “Although the exact location of the Sacred Grounds is unknown, it only opens when the Nether River recedes, suggesting a close connection.  It’s likely that the ancestors deliberately captured them from the Nether River and kept them there.  You should know that it's not just ferocious beasts; there are also incredibly powerful beasts comparable to Saint Realm cultivators! Qin Real Person must be extremely cautious within the Sacred Grounds. If you sense anything unusual, it's best to stay far away.”</p><p>Mahayana-stage beasts!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  They not only had to guard against fellow cultivators of the same level entering the Sacred Grounds but also avoid the beasts.  He wondered if the environment in the Sacred Grounds was similar to the Nether River, hoping that the beasts weren’t skilled at concealing their presence, allowing him to detect danger early.</p><p>Shaoshi was focused on the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman. This talisman contained the Five Thunder secrets, but it was first and foremost a thunder talisman, and one of the most complex and profound among third-order thunder talismans.  Qin Sang not only could use it but also had complete control over it, so it should be sealable within the treasure orb.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang activated the altar again, using the Thunder Altar to deploy the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman.</p><p>A thunder seal appeared in the sky.</p><p>The spectacle it produced was less impressive than the Sacrifice Thunder Oath Scroll, but its power was undeniable.  Among the third-order offensive thunder talismans recorded in the Five Thunder Envoy's Seal, none could surpass it in power.</p><p>The thunder seal was surrounded by thunder, its power latent, slowly descending from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the treasure orb in advance, transforming it into a silver sphere.</p><p>With experience from the last time, Qin Sang was now adept at the process. The thunder seal entered the sphere, and the resulting turbulence was quickly controlled, eventually settling firmly in place.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed his consciousness into the treasure orb, focusing his senses. Because he had detected the pulsation before, he consciously sought it out this time.  At the moment the seal was about to complete, he detected another fleeting pulsation, confirming that his previous perception wasn't a mistake.</p><p>The clouds dispersed and the thunder faded.</p><p>The area around Qingyang City returned to calm.</p><p>The silver sphere contracted to its smallest size, reverting to the treasure orb, slowly falling into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The orb’s appearance remained unchanged, but its spiritual light was even more dazzling.  Through that light, one could see a small thunder seal nestled among densely packed lightning within the orb – the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart True Seal.</p><p>The thunder seal hung steadily in the center of the orb, ready to be activated with a thought from Qin Sang.</p><p>Shaoshi said, “Good.” Although they hadn't sealed the Sacrifice Thunder Oath Scroll, sealing the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman had still achieved their goal.  He took out a sheet of golden paper and said, “Qin Real Person, if you have no other requests, you can leave your Dharma name on this and formalize our oath.”</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely. He saw clusters of white light floating on the surface of the golden paper, twisting and shifting like mist on the sea, transforming into various strange runes. When his spiritual sense touched the runes, words appeared in his mind.</p><p>The text was the oath they had just discussed, binding both him and the Si Huang side’s actions, mutually agreed upon.</p><p>On one side of the golden paper, there was a red seal bearing the name of the Si Huang.</p><p>Shaoshi explained, “This is the Tai Xu Golden Book.  It itself is a rare treasure coveted by all races, immensely valuable.  The Imperial family only possesses three sheets over the years.  Once both parties sign their Dharma names, the Golden Book will self-immolate, establishing the oath. Any party that breaks the oath will face punishment, which will automatically dissolve once the matter is concluded.”</p><p>“What kind of punishment?” Qin Sang had scanned the Golden Book's text and found no mention of punishment.</p><p>“Those who betray their oaths will encounter misfortune, said to vary from person to person, unpredictable and unavoidable. The Tai Xu Golden Book's power has been proven countless times, and this treasure originates from the Sacred Grounds. If anyone wants to betray their allies, they must think twice before acting. Compared to karmic oaths, major clans trust the Tai Xu Golden Book more in critical situations.”</p><p>Shaoshi said meaningfully, “No one can tamper with the Tai Xu Golden Book. If Qin Real Person is worried, you can send a letter to the Zhu Yan clan to inquire, but don’t reveal our agreement.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of trouble. He asked Shaoshi to stay a few more days and sent a letter.  The reply came quickly, confirming Shaoshi's description of the Tai Xu Golden Book.</p><p>The Tai Xu Golden Book originated from the Sacred Grounds, implying that its creator was at least a Mahayana-stage cultivator.  Qin Sang certainly didn't want to test its power on himself.</p><p>The so-called Daoist name can be fabricated at will;  the real name, Qin Zhenren, or even the title of  Five Thunder  Temple Commander will do. The key is the essence imprinted within the Golden Book.</p><p>Qin Sang personally wrote the three characters 'Qin Zhenren'. As the final stroke was completed, the Golden Book ignited spontaneously without fire,  releasing golden flames that burned fiercely, leaving not even a trace of ash.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly, watching the golden flames. He sensed an inexplicable energy entering his body, but upon searching, he couldn't find it.</p><p>The Tai Xu Golden Book bestowing a Daoist name established an alliance. The expression of the Shao Shi softened,  "The Mirage Orb…"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately produced the Lu family's Mirage Orb.</p><p>The Shao Shi accepted it, saying cheerfully, "I shall return to the clan and report the good news to the Grand Emperor.  Later,  Qin Zhenren, will you join us at the Yuanjiao Sea Market?"</p><p>"I've already made plans to travel with the Yuanxiang Clan Chief.  It's not too late to visit the Grand Emperor at the Yuanjiao Sea Market," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>The Shao Shi nodded. "Very well! I bid you farewell, Qin Zhenren. Until next time!"</p><p>With that, the Shao Shi left Qingyang Temple, departing in a rainbow-like arc.</p><p>After the Shao Shi, Si Lu arrived at the main hall.</p><p>"Regarding this journey to the Sacred Land, do you have anyone in mind?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Initially, Si Lu had intended to use assisting Qin Sang's entry into the Sacred Land as leverage to avenge himself. However, he didn't understand the rules; even now, as the Yan King, he couldn't achieve this.</p><p>Qin Sang could also travel with Si Lu, essentially gifting the Lu family's Mirage Orb to the Grand Emperor.  The Grand Emperor's conditions would certainly be more lenient.</p><p>However, having gained some understanding of the Sacred Land and with Ning Zhenren's entrustment, Qin Sang dared not be careless. He believed that more allies were better, so he didn't use the Si family's quota, allowing Si Lu to bring an additional companion.</p><p>The cost was that he would need to perform a task for the Grand Emperor. After weighing the matter, Qin Sang considered it worthwhile; the luminous pearl was an unexpected bonus.</p><p>Unfortunately, it couldn't be an outsider; the choice had to be made from the Si You clan. Si Lu lacked top-tier experts.</p><p>"Shi Mu and the others are not trustworthy enough, and my stepmother is not skilled in combat. Among my father's remaining ministers, the Grand Marshal has the highest cultivation. He cultivates a powerful life-or-death secret technique. Once unleashed, even mid-stage cultivators would have to retreat," Si Lu said.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed to the image of the elderly man.</p><p>The elderly man was at the peak of the initial stage of cultivation, but was hindered by a bottleneck, making no progress.  In the previous Yan King's court, aside from Xia Changshi, some might have surpassed the Grand Marshal in cultivation, but the Grand Marshal's position always ranked second only to Xia Changshi. After the previous Yan King's death, Si Lu and Xia Changshi disappeared. The Grand Marshal, gathering the remnants of the Yan King's forces, navigated the conflict between the imperial family and the Lu family, preserving their foundation. His intelligence and strength were both reliable.</p><p>"Good. It will be him! After entering the Sacred Land, I need to meet with the Grand Emperor first, which might take some time. You can attend to your own affairs and we can arrange a meeting point later," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Si Lu joyfully replied, "My father left instructions within the Mirage Orb. With the Grand Marshal's help, there's hope of obtaining that opportunity!"</p><p>Qin Sang was pleased that Si Lu could gain an opportunity in the Sacred Land and improve his strength. The stronger his allies, the more stable Qingyang Zhi's position in the Mist Sea would be.</p><p>After discussing the details, Si Lu took his leave.</p><p>Having seen both off, Qin Sang carefully reviewed everything, satisfied there were no oversights. Next, he would wait for the Ni River tide to recede.</p><p>Taking out the luminous pearl, Qin Sang played with it for a while before putting it away and flew towards the fire chamber.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, the golden light was somewhat dim.</p><p>The golden liquid within the eight golden bodies was nearly depleted. Qin Sang silently channeled his secret technique to replenish it, his consciousness sweeping over the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock.  The spiritual embryo of the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock seemed increasingly tranquil, its response to Qin Sang's probing gentler than before.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, continuing to comprehend the sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Thirty years passed in a flash.</p><p>After decades of recuperation, Qingyang Zhi was no longer shrouded in gloom. The scars of war had almost been erased by time, leaving only the wounds etched in people's hearts from the death of loved ones, occasionally causing pain.</p><p>The Five Thunder Temple was on the right track.  Peace and stability brought prosperity. All clans, sects, and independent cultivators flourished.</p><p>Some cultivators in the Four Jing regions began to leave Qingyang Zhi and explore the depths of the Storm Sea, some establishing branch temples for their own sects, others carrying the edicts of the Five Thunder Temple to expand its territory and gain merit.</p><p>By now, Qingyang Temple had become a sacred place in the hearts of all cultivators in Qingyang Zhi, its status unparalleled.</p><p>Once a small temple founded by Ji Xin Dao Ren, Qingyang Temple has grown into a powerful entity, its territory exceeding even the largest domains of the former Storm World. Qin Sang has not disappointed Yun Youzi's expectations!</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Behind the main peak, Qin Sang's cultivation has made this area another restricted zone.</p><p>Normally, only Li Yu Fu and others occasionally visit, mainly to ask questions about their cultivation.  With Qingyang's internal and external affairs settled, disciples handle minor matters, leaving Qin Sang free.</p><p>Warm sunlight fills the forest.  Amidst the mist, Qin Sang sits under a tree, a ball of golden light hovering before him – the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock!</p><p>Recently, the eight golden statues, having exhausted their power and shattered, finally helped Qin Sang refine this treasure!</p><p>The spirit of the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock has submitted to Qin Sang, acknowledging him as its master. However, when using it, Qin Sang feels some stiffness.</p><p>This is a hidden flaw from the ancient technique, causing some damage to the treasure – an unavoidable consequence, as Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang sits motionless, seemingly pondering something. After a while, his expression shifts slightly, and he casts a hand seal.</p><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock rises, its golden light dispelling the mist, as if cloaking half the peak in a golden robe.</p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p>A crisp sound.</p><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock's surface radiates light, a strange ripple spreading. The surrounding golden light subtly changes.</p><p>Qin Sang bathes in the golden light, concentrating his senses, lost in thought.</p><p>After a long time, a look of understanding dawns on his face. He opens his eyes, raises a hand, and the golden light flows like water through his fingers.</p><p>"So the power of the Void Realm is like this..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmurs to himself.</p><p>His understanding of the Void Realm surpasses even the Grand Deacon.</p><p>In his view, the Void Realm is somewhat "gilt on the outside, rotten within," mimicking the Dharma Realm but only in form.</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s a power many Nascent Soul cultivators can only dream of achieving in a lifetime.</p><p>When Yun You Jian ascended, the sword Qin Sang unleashed could be considered a Void Realm sword, but it was created through his own understanding. His comprehension is still shallow, one-sided. Compared to the Void Realm mastered by peak Nascent Soul experts, his Void Realm sword has many shortcomings, such as only being usable in sword techniques.</p><p>Those top experts not only understand the Dharma Realm as well as Qin Sang, but have also spent years studying it, developing unique applications of the Void Realm's power. Qin Sang has only made initial progress; what he lacks is time.</p><p>By studying the Void Realm's power within the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, Qin Sang gained some insights. If he can fully grasp it, his use of the Void Realm sword will undoubtedly improve, usable even through the Grey Ying Sword, though its power won't match Yun You Jian.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang is also very satisfied with the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock. This treasure's power lies in its ability to "bind," complementing sword formations, allowing him to advance or retreat freely even when facing formidable foes, adding to his confidence for the journey to the Sacred Land.</p><p>After further studying, Qin Sang changes his hand seals, using the blood refinement technique from the *Chong Xuan Codex*.</p><p>A drop of essence blood is forced out. Qin Sang's fingers fly, casting complex hand seals. The blood droplet trembles, splitting into fine threads, forming a spiderweb-like blood net floating before him.</p><p>The blood threads are incredibly thin, seemingly fragile enough to break in a light breeze. Yet Qin Sang doesn't stop.  Under the continuous hand seals, the threads become intensely red and are then drawn toward the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock.</p><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock is completely enveloped by the blood net. The threads writhe on its surface, slowly seeping inside.  A strange crimson flash flickers within the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang senses a connection of blood between him and the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock. The stiffness isn't significantly altered, but by consistently using this technique, he can minimize the hidden flaw.</p><p>Putting away the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, Qin Sang looks towards the edge of the forest. "Yu Fu, come in."</p><p>At the edge of the forest.</p><p>Li Yu Fu waits patiently. He has been waiting for a while, sensing Qin Sang's spellcasting and not disturbing him.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu swiftly enters the forest, approaching Qin Sang and presents a sealed message.</p><p>"Reporting to Master Uncle, this just arrived from the Zhu Yan tribe, requesting your personal perusal."</p>
