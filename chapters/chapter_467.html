Chapter 460: A Comparison


Qin Sang felt apprehensive as he spoke.
Fortunately, Granny Jing didn't get angry.
"It is indeed a problem for you,"
Granny Jing pondered for a moment, then said to Qin Sang, "Come with me."
Before the words left her mouth,
Qin Sang felt his body tense, enveloped by a spiritual force.  Before he could react, his vision changed drastically. After a whirlwind journey, he soon heard the sound of waves crashing nearby.


Night had fallen.  A faint blush of sunset lingered where the western sky met the water.
A few stars twinkled in the sky.
The moon was not yet prominent.
Beneath his feet lay a boundless expanse of water.
Qin Sang abruptly turned his head; behind him stretched a continuous, endless sea of mist.


How long had it been?
They had left Qin Sang's cave dwelling and arrived outside the True Water Illusion Array.
Qin Sang's mind was a blur. He hadn't seen anything, and had no idea how Granny Jing had silently transported him through the large array without alerting anyone!
If everyone in the Tianxing Alliance were as powerful as Granny Jing, Xiaohan Domain would have been utterly defeated long ago.


Qin Sang was still shaken.
Granny Jing said calmly, "You wanted to know if I could evade a Nascent Soul cultivator's perception?  Actions speak louder than words."
Qin Sang subconsciously swallowed, "Senior, where are you taking me?"
"You'll know when we arrive."
Granny Jing said indifferently, and took out another wooden carving.
The carving was of a Qingluan bird. Like the previous female figure, it was lifelike, capturing the divine essence of the mythical bird, as if it were about to take flight at any moment.


Indeed, when Granny Jing touched the Qingluan carving with her finger, it came to life.
After a clear phoenix-like cry, the Qingluan's wings suddenly fluttered, scattering glittering dust as they moved; a breathtaking sight.
The Qingluan chirped sweetly, showing great affection for Granny Jing, and danced around her. As it flew, its body grew larger with the wind, rapidly transforming into a real mythical bird, freely stretching its wings.
Qin Sang had read descriptions of the ancient Qingluan bird in old texts—this was identical!


At this moment, there wasn't a trace of the wooden carving left.
Puppetry?
Or some other kind of spell?
Qin Sang's eyes widened, awestruck by Granny Jing's alchemic-like skill.  Then he felt himself lift, the Qingluan had willingly taken them both onto its back.


It spread its wings, soared into the wind, and ascended to the heavens.
…


Shaohua Mountain gate.
Thick fog and dark clouds.
One could vaguely see the numerous peaks and pleasant scenery of the sect.
Familiar sights appeared before them.
The Qingluan soared, crossing the vast Yun Cang Marsh, carrying them to the gate of Shaohua Mountain.


Qin Sang was puzzled and turned to Granny Jing.
"I'll wait for you at Shaohua Mountain."
Granny Jing looked at the Qingluan, a gentle smile on her face. With a gesture, she called the bird back.  The Qingluan let out a reluctant cry, its body rapidly shrinking.  When it landed in Granny Jing's palm, it transformed back into a wooden carving, exactly as it was before.
Granny Jing nodded slightly to Qin Sang, then her figure faded and disappeared into thin air.
Her voice lingered.


Qin Sang quickly used his escape technique to steady himself, fully activating his spiritual sense, but he couldn't perceive anything. Granny Jing had completely vanished.
At that moment, Qin Sang's heart stirred, suddenly realizing that the Shaohua Mountain Granny Jing mentioned wasn't the sect, but the main peak within the sect.
The Nascent Soul ancestor of the sect, Dongyang Bo's cave, was located on top of Shaohua Peak!
At this moment, Qin Sang understood what "seeing is believing" truly meant.
He chickened out.


Qin Sang's expression fluctuated, before finally making up his mind. He mounted his Youluo Cloud and flew towards the mountain gate.
"Who's there…"
As he approached the mountain gate's array, he was spotted by the patrolling disciples.
The sect's defenses were much tighter now.
The mist swirled, and three Qi Refinement disciples, one male and two female, emerged from the array. Their gazes swept around, and upon seeing Qin Sang, their alert expressions softened. They bowed respectfully, delightedly saying, "It's Uncle-Master Qin! We greet Uncle-Master Qin!"
Qin Sang's reputation from the Yun Cang Marsh had reached the sect.
Many inexperienced disciples admired him greatly.
Qin Sang grunted, "I've returned to attend to an important matter and will leave shortly. Open the array."


Three disciples exchanged glances, hesitantly saying, “Please forgive us, Master Qin. Recently, the Sect Master ordered that everyone must possess a sect token or a direct order from the Sect Master to open the barrier…”

This order undoubtedly came from Qi Yuanshou.

It seems the conflict between Xiaohan Region and the Tianxing Alliance is far from over; the emergence of Zhitain Peak was merely a minor incident.

There’s no telling when it will end.

Qin Sang mused inwardly, took out her sect token, and threw it into the array.

After verifying Qin Sang's token, the three disciples opened the barrier.

Despite her urgency, Qin Sang remained outwardly composed.  She first returned to her cave dwelling before heading towards Xiaohua Mountain.

Xiaohua Mountain was no longer a restricted area for Foundation Establishment disciples.  Golden Core masters sometimes held lectures there, and there were also discussion halls for the sect's disciples. This wasn't Qin Sang's first visit.

However, with the unrest in Xiaohan Region, Foundation Establishment disciples were scattered, leaving the discussion halls much quieter.

How will she prove it?

Qin Sang pondered, her figure silently landing on the celestial steps.

As Qin Sang approached the white jade archway, her expression suddenly changed. Glancing sideways, she discovered a woman in flowing white robes beside the jade pillar, seemingly appearing out of thin air.  Qin Sang had meticulously scanned the area a moment before; it had been completely empty.

“Are you Granny Jing? Or…”

Qin Sang's voice was hesitant.

No wonder she hesitated. This woman bore no resemblance to Granny Jing, but was identical to the wooden carving Granny Jing had given her.  The real person surpassed the carving in grace.  Her hands were as white as snow, her black hair like satin, reaching her waist. Clad in simple white robes, devoid of any adornments, her beauty was in no way inferior to that of Fairy Chenyan.

Her eyebrows were delicately arched, her eyes deep and幽邃, radiating detachment and coldness.  She exuded the same otherworldly air, ethereal and graceful.

Previously, Fairy Chenyan was unparalleled in Qin Sang's experience.  Comparing this woman to her, Qin Sang found a significant difference in their temperament.

She recalled her impression of Fairy Chenyan:  a faint, persistent melancholy in her brows, and eyes holding an unwavering firmness bordering on stubbornness. That night, there was also a bewilderment Qin Sang couldn't comprehend, pulling Fairy Chenyan down from the heavens into the mortal realm.

This woman, however, was a true celestial maiden, untouched by worldly affairs.  Her gaze was cold and indifferent, as if observing all of the mortal world without the slightest ripple of emotion.
