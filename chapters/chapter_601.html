Please Vote!)</p><p>Countless powerful sword intents hung suspended in the void, each carrying a terrifying aura. Qin Sang passed through them without disturbing them, likely thanks to the Ebony Sword and the Killing Talisman.  This ancient hall only allowed disciples who cultivated the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* to enter. Any other intruders would immediately face the annihilation of a thousand swords.</p><p>With every step Qin Sang took, a stone sword would be roused, unleashing its sword intent. He parried with his sword, absorbing the essence of each intent.  Sometimes, it was a lone figure practicing swordsmanship, exhibiting exquisite techniques. Other times, it was a scene of carnage – mountains of corpses and seas of blood, a lone swordsman standing amidst it all, their killing intent shaking the heavens.  Or it might be a mysterious sword light in the void, its origin and destination unknown.</p><p>…</p><p>Each was unique, a fleeting glimpse, incredibly brief, the background blurry, only the sword intent clear. How much one could comprehend depended entirely on oneself. Qin Sang could only do his best to remember as much as possible.  As expected, the sword intents grew stronger the farther he went.  Reliance on his own abilities alone would have made his progress slow and arduous, impossible to traverse with such ease.  When the Ebony Sword showed signs of strain against the sword intents, Qin Sang would immediately withdraw, allowing the intents to strike his Yuanshen space, where they were dispersed by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Along the way, he absorbed many profoundly obscure things, most of which he couldn't immediately comprehend, but committed to memory.  Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel at the benefits of a legacy. Often, what hindered cultivators was a mere membrane, easily pierced. Some receive guidance from their sect or masters, easily overcoming obstacles. Others, however, stumble blindly, perhaps never finding their way.</p><p>These stone swords couldn't have been left by a single person. No two sword intents were alike, yet they all stemmed from the same cultivation method, diverging along different paths.  Information was scarce.  Even with Qin Sang's keen eyes, he couldn't discern the cultivation levels of these swordsmen, but their strength was undoubtedly immense.  A sect possessing such powerful individuals—how could they have been annihilated?</p><p>Time marches on, and the world changes.  Even they couldn't achieve immortality.  The inheritance is only a fragment, countless ancient texts containing no records whatsoever. Everyone vanished, swallowed by the river of time, leaving only these stone swords, preserving a pitiful trace of sword intent, the sole remaining mark. By this, one can catch a glimpse of the brilliance of past masters.</p><p>…</p><p>The path of swords was long.  Qin Sang walked through the forest of swords, step by step, pushing back the darkness, yet still the end was not in sight. Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped. He finally saw something different.</p><p>At the end of the path, a stone door!  The door, opened by an unknown hand, was ajar, the interior equally dark. Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, checking even the gaps between the stone swords, but found nothing unusual.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's remains were likely ahead!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly.  Generally, large sects wouldn't have just one trial ground. Each location typically had only one type of trial. Could there be another trial ahead? This variable was unmentioned by Granny Jing.</p><p>This place was likely a trial ground for Foundation Establishment cultivators. The Jade Buddha could only protect his Yuanshen.  While he could easily traverse this path of swords, he might not be able to pass other trials.  With this thought, Qin Sang's mood grew heavier, and he quickened his pace towards the stone door.</p><p>‘Creak…’</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the stone door.  Upon seeing what lay beyond, his expression relaxed.  Inside was a small, square ancient hall, much smaller than the sword path outside, without other trials. The ancient hall was quiet, seemingly without danger.</p><p>A false alarm. Qin Sang stood before the door, carefully examining the hall.  Though dim, its small size allowed a clear view. The walls and floor were constructed of green stone bricks, the same as outside, but there were no stone swords, giving it a rather empty feel.  The only thing inside was a waist-high altar at the center of the hall.  The edge of the altar seemed to be engraved with many strange runes, resembling a spirit array.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's remains weren't here!</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.  This outcome was unexpected.  Elder Qingzhu had appeared briefly on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and then completely vanished, a timeline coinciding with the last opening of the Ziwei Palace.  Granny Jing was quite certain that Elder Qingzhu disappeared within this ancient hall. Her information should be reliable; everything he encountered before entering this hall matched her description.</p><p>Where was the problem?</p><p>Unwilling to give up, Qin Sang hurriedly checked the hall's walls, hoping to find a hidden door, but found none.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the altar in the center of the stone hall.  Trying a tentative step, finding no obstacles, she swiftly approached the altar.</p><p>The altar was square, with steps extending down on all four sides.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the altar in a few strides.  Seeing the complete array on the altar, she immediately felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>"This… could it be an ancient teleportation array?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, astonished.</p><p>The array on the altar was in the shape of a Bagua (eight trigrams), its eight corners aligned with the Bagua positions.  It was densely covered with mysterious runes.  Currently, all eight corners were empty, but clear recesses indicated where spirit stones should be placed.</p><p>Seeing this array, Qin Sang immediately recalled the ancient teleportation array in the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.  She had used it twice before and the memory was vivid.</p><p>The shapes were identical; even the ancient restrictions and runes were over 90% the same.</p><p>The difference was that this one was much smaller than the Shangyuan Quiet Palace's array; its center only allowed one or two people to stand.  Furthermore, the ancient runes in this array were even more numerous than those in the Shangyuan Quiet Palace array, appearing unusually dense within the confined space, almost pressed together.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang needed no further testing to confirm: this was an ancient teleportation array!</p><p>The end of the sword path was an ancient teleportation array. Was the sword forest outside actually a protective measure for the array, not a trial?</p><p>Where did this teleportation array lead?</p><p>Could it be that Senior Qingzhu didn't die, but instead left Xiaohan Region using this array?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but let her thoughts wander, staring at the ancient teleportation array.  She finally confirmed that the array was intact.  If the corresponding array on the other side wasn't damaged, it could be activated simply by inserting spirit stones into the eight corners!</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>At that moment, her peripheral vision caught something:  a man-made inscription on a stone pillar at the edge of the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.  She quickly moved to the pillar and saw a line of writing.</p><p>The writing was very scribbled and barely legible, clearly hastily written.</p><p>Next to the writing were two very complex symbols that immediately caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Two killing talismans!</p>
