<h1>Chapter 180: Granny Jing</h1><p>Shopkeeper Wu also understood that there was no spiritual spring up for auction on the black market, and his tone of voice changed as he said: “If fellow Daoist Qin is interested in the black market, I can make an introduction. Besides, there is also a secret shop in Wen Yue’s Market Place aside from the black market. It was opened by a respected senior. In fact, it’s a place where like-minded fellow Daoists could gather. Most of the members are rogue cultivators, and they barter with each other in the secret shop. They can also post missions. If there’s something you need, or if you encounter any difficulties, everyone can work together to solve it. That’s definitely better than facing it on your own.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised to hear this, but after some thought, it was not strange for a place like this to exist. On Shao Hua Mountain, there were similar small circles among fellow disciples. If Qin Sang was unable to purchase outside, he had intended to seek Senior Brother Wen’s help with an introduction.</p><p>“Requirement are likely needed to join these gatherings, right? What are they?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu nodded: “Indeed, two requirements are needed. The first is a joint recommendation from at least three members. Fellow Daoist Qin doesn’t need to worry, because I can help Fellow Daoist Qin find two more friends to help. The second requirement is that one’s identity and history needs to be stated clearly and can withstand investigation, with nothing hidden in the slightest. Because most of the people are rogue cultivators, everyone is very cautious. The reason why they join the secret shop is for mutual assistance, with the intention of preventing people who are tainted by vice and harbor malicious intentions from mixing in.”</p><p>After speaking, Shopkeeper Wu looked at Qin Sang with a somewhat awkward appearance, unsure of what was on his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled upon hearing this. There was nothing that couldn’t see the light of day with his identity. The only reason he had concealed his cultivation level from Shopkeeper Wu was due to habit, which essentially eliminated the trouble in communicating. Upon hearing Shopkeeper Wu say this, he took out his token and handed it to Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>“I, Qin, cultivate on Shao Hua Mountain. Shopkeeper Wu may hand this token over to that senior. If it’s necessary to go to Shao Hua Mountain to find other fellow disciples for verification, I, Qin, will fully cooperate.”</p><p>“Senior Qin!”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu had long ago guessed Qin Sang’s identity. Upon seeing this token representing a Foundation Establishment disciple of Shao Hua Mountain, he was actually somewhat surprised, but not overly shocked. He stood up, desiring to bow in respect.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual energy and gently pressed down on Shopkeeper Wu, asking: “Fellow Daoist Wu, have I offended you in any way over these recent years?”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu blinked blankly, “What is the meaning of Senior Qin’s words? This junior has received Senior Qin’s patronage, and it is only with Senior Qin’s guidance that my armament refining realm was able to attain some growth. How could I ever…”</p><p>“It’s fine if you haven’t offended me,” Qin Sang said with a serious expression, “Fellow Daoist Wu and I became acquainted when we were both unknown figures. The first time I came to Fellow Daoist’s shop, I was indeed at the Qi Refining stage. I was only able to make a fortunate breakthrough later on. Our cooperation on several occasions was also very pleasant. Fellow Daoist and I should continue to address each other as fellow Daoists in the future. There’s no need to speak of any seniors anymore. Otherwise, how would I still be able to have the cheek to ask Fellow Daoist Wu for assistance?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu’s expression was somewhat hesitant. Upon seeing that Qin Sang was being persistent, he could only go with the flow and cupped his hands, saying: “Thank you for Fellow Daoist’s regard. If there is anything Fellow Daoist Qin may have to ask of this one, this humble one will definitely do his utmost…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded with a smile: “That’s just right! I have come this time with another request to ask of Fellow Daoist Wu…”</p><p>Upon seeing the black tiger demon corpse, Shopkeeper Wu was extremely shocked. In his Wen Yue’s Market Place business, he had mostly refined some low and mid-grade magical tools for rogue cultivators. He had truly never seen such a monster corpse at the mid-stage of the Demon Spirit stage. Furthermore, it was an almost complete monster corpse.</p><p>Not long after sending over the corpse of a white rhinoceros, another even more powerful black tiger had been slain. It seemed that the strength of this Fellow Daoist Qin was even more fearsome than he had imagined. Shopkeeper Wu also developed intentions of making friends.</p><p>In truth, he desired even more so to refine a Dharma artifact. However, Qin Sang insisted on refining a spirit devouring cone, so he had no choice but to do it according to Qin Sang’s request.</p><p>Once the details were finalized, Shopkeeper Wu put away the black tiger demon corpse, locked up his shop, and led Qin Sang toward the secret shop.</p><p>What made one cluck in wonder was that the secret shop was actually opened in an area where mortals resided. Qin Sang and Shopkeeper Wu turned down one street after another, and finally stopped before a small shop known as Peach Bamboo Pavilion.</p><p>The small shop was exceptionally tranquil, and there was not a single customer present. The shopkeeper was an old woman who looked to be seventy or eighty years old. The old woman’s form appeared somewhat hunched, and her face was deeply wrinkled. She was currently sitting on a bamboo chair, seemingly asleep.</p><p>Upon seeing this old woman, Qin Sang’s gaze turned slightly stern. He actually felt somewhat unable to see through her. It was very likely that she was a Foundation Establishment mid-stage, or even late-stage, cultivator.</p><p>According to what Shopkeeper Wu said, this person’s surname was Jing, and she was respectfully addressed as Granny Jing by everyone. She had suddenly appeared in Wen Yue’s Market Place a few decades before and had opened this secret shop. She started to organize gatherings for rogue cultivators, and had always been able to preside over justice. She was highly respected and had an excellent reputation.</p><p>In the past, there was a rogue cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage in the secret shop who had suddenly risen up with intentions to kill and steal treasure, and after they succeeded, they absconded to escape. Unexpectedly, Granny Jing disappeared for a month. She ultimately returned with that cultivator’s head, and since then, no one had harbored any dissatisfaction.</p><p>“Has this person lost hope in reaching Golden Core and started to live in retirement?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>“Wu Yang greets Granny Jing.”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu hastily walked to the old woman and bowed respectfully.</p><p>The old woman opened her eyes. Her gaze was crystal clear, and she turned her attention to Qin Sang. "Daoist Wu, you have come. And this is...?"</p><p>Her voice was aged and raspy, but it had no ominous undertones. It was like that of a gentle elder.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward. "I am Qin Sang from Mount Shaohua. Greetings, Granny Jing."</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu then explained their purpose for being there. Earlier, on their way, he had met up with two friends of his, and together they had recommended Qin Sang for membership. However, they still needed Granny Jing's approval. Otherwise, the number of people in the secret shop would definitely not be so low.</p><p>Intrigued after hearing Qin Sang's background, Granny Jing gave him a thorough once-over and let out a chuckle. Her words were sharp. "Daoist Qin, you come from a famous sect. Are you not afraid of being mocked by your sect members should they learn that you are associating with the likes of us?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. "In Qin Sang's eyes, we are all cultivators. We should not judge each other based on our origins. As long as one has a heart for the Way, this younger generation will respect them."</p><p>These were his true thoughts.</p><p>The path of cultivation is arduous and fraught with dangers!</p><p>Only those who have walked a path of cultivation understand how difficult and lonely it can be. Those who can overcome the many trials and tribulations, those whose hearts remain firm in the Way, they are his models.</p><p>Granny Jing narrowed her eyes and looked at Qin Sang for a long time. Her tone carried both a sense of reminiscence and emotion. "You too are a fool for cultivation... The rules of the secret shop, I presume Daoist Wu has already told you about them. However, this old woman will reiterate them once more. Those who covet treasures and kill their companions, this old woman will personally execute! Daoist Qin, do not think that just because your cultivation base is high and your background deep, this old woman will be unable to do anything to you. The time of each gathering is at the beginning of each month, at this old woman's shop. Give me your cave abode address, Daoist Qin, so that I can contact you."</p><p>Qin Sang and Shopkeeper Wu exchanged a glance, both somewhat surprised. They hadn't expected to pass through so easily. However, Qin Sang was naturally grateful and hurriedly agreed, leaving behind the address to Huilong Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang then laid out his request.</p><p>The old woman did not ask any further questions. "This old woman understands. If there is any news, I will send a letter to Huilong Temple to inform Daoist Qin."</p>
