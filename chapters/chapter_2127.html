<h1>Chapter 2117: The Undying Eight Extremes Diagram</h1><p>Inside the royal carriage, a scroll hung in mid-air, depicting the locations and terrain of the major regions of the Storm World. Min Zhuo entered, hearing King Lu and others discussing where to attack.</p><p>After listening quietly for a while, King Lu looked at him and asked, “Clan Chief Min Zhuo has battled these foreign tribes for many years. What strategies do you have? Please share them freely.” The Grand Minister, Lu Gan, and several of King Lu’s generals all looked at Min Zhuo. Only the Imperial Tutor remained silent, eyes closed in contemplation.</p><p>Min Zhuo looked straight ahead, his mind racing.</p><p>The Storm World can be roughly divided into three regions.  Considering the East Sea, Central State, and Western Lands as one, we have the Central State continent, the undisputed heart of the Storm World. The other two regions are relatively remote.</p><p>He had heard Lu Gan and others advocate for a three-pronged attack, with King Lu, the Grand Minister, and the Imperial Tutor leading separate armies to simultaneously attack the three regions.</p><p>There are currently no signs of reinforcements arriving from elsewhere for the foreign tribes. The Si You army holds a significant advantage.</p><p>The most important factor is the unknown number of Nascent Soul experts among the enemy. If the Si You army can tie them up, and the main force presses forward in a relentless attack, there's a chance to crush them and swiftly secure victory.</p><p>With their territory lost, those Nascent Soul experts' morale will surely plummet.  Then we can devise a plan to defeat them one by one.</p><p>However, the Imperial Tutor hasn’t expressed an opinion, and the swift collapse of the foreign tribes doesn't seem advantageous to Min Zhuo.</p><p>He stepped forward, replied affirmatively, and pointed to a location on the map, recounting the events of previous battles.  “…There's a teleportation array connecting the North Sea and the Central State continent, allowing for timely reinforcements between the two. Only there, a place the foreign tribes call the Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea, is most remote.  In the past, our clan targeted this area and successfully occupied it, but it was later retaken. However…"</p><p>Min Zhuo's tone changed, “Previously, I hadn't yet broken through, and the enemy lacked Nascent Soul experts. Our past experiences are inapplicable now.  Our previous strategy of conquering one region and then the whole, gradually encroaching, was feasible. But now, the strength of the foreign tribes is unfathomable.  And there are previously unseen altars.  Master Qin would likely not place much importance on the gain or loss of a single region. It could even be a trap.”</p><p>King Lu mused, “Clan Chief Min Zhuo, are you suggesting that splitting our forces would play right into the enemy's hands and lead to our defeat in detail?”</p><p>“These are merely my conjectures, lacking concrete evidence.”</p><p>Min Zhuo bowed slightly, “The intelligence from various regions, and what Daoist Lu Gan personally discovered, are consistent.  The foreign tribes are constructing countless altars in all the major regions. If these altars belong to the same array, and all three regions are within the array, the person controlling it from the main altar can direct the array's power anywhere.  Attacking any one area would be the same. Thus, dividing our forces would weaken us, while the enemy, through the array, could concentrate their strength in one place. In that location, we would face a superior enemy!”</p><p>Pausing, he added, “Of course, this assumes they’re building a killing array! If these altars are only for defense and cannot attack—just a turtle shell—then they are insignificant!”</p><p>King Lu laughed, “Clan Chief Min Zhuo's idea coincides with the Grand Minister's.  Our priority now is to ascertain the nature of those altars.”</p><p>Min Zhuo said humbly, “The Grand Minister is surely far-sighted and already has a plan. My humble words are laughable.”</p><p>King Lu waved his hand, turning to the map, then pointed at the Western Lands, his voice booming, “Then let's boldly attack them head-on!  The Western Lands will be our target!”</p><p>Everyone responded with obedience.</p><p>Lu Gan said coldly, “I'm eager to meet Master Qin again!  I just hope the altars aren't merely a facade, masking their escape!”</p><p>“If they wanted to escape, they wouldn't have waited until today,” the Grand Minister shook his head slightly, stepped forward, and took over the deployment of troops from King Lu.</p><p>The Grand Minister didn't assign a task to the Imperial Tutor.  Through several attempts at probing, the Imperial Tutor’s attitude had been made clear.</p><p>Lu Gan and others received their orders and departed.</p><p>The army set out, heading straight for the Western Lands, their momentum unrestrained, causing a change in the weather wherever they passed.</p><p>King Lu nodded in satisfaction, exchanging a glance with the Grand Minister. The Grand Minister turned to the Imperial Tutor and bowed, “We'll reach the Western Lands shortly. When does Your Excellency plan to deploy the Undying Eight Extremes Diagram?”</p><p>The Undying Eight Extremes Diagram was the array diagram King Lu obtained from the Si Emperor.</p><p>It was said to be incredibly powerful, obtained by King Lu to counter the enemy’s altars.  If the enemy launches a surprise attack, as long as this diagram is used, there is no need to worry about being caught off guard and suffering heavy losses.</p><p>The royal family considered the Undying Eight Extremes Diagram a priceless treasure.  While the Si Emperor agreed to lend it, it must be controlled by the Imperial Tutor personally.</p><p>The Shaoshi lifted an eyelid, his expression languid.  "Oh?  We haven't even encountered the enemy, and you're already deploying this?"</p><p>"Deploying the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu preemptively allows us to react to any unforeseen circumstances.  Waiting until the battle begins will be too late. This war won't be decided overnight. We need the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu to create a secure rear, bolster morale, and allow us to steadily advance, gradually revealing the enemy's strength. My King's request for the map is precisely for this moment.  Furthermore…rumor has it that the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu is difficult to use, and while its deployment is spectacular, its full power isn't immediately realized; it requires continuous refinement and gradual enhancement. Is this true?"</p><p>Though phrased as a question, the Grand Consecrate's tone was certain.</p><p>The Shaoshi's eyes flickered. "I didn't expect the Grand Consecrate to be so knowledgeable about the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, even aware of these secrets. Truly well-versed, no wonder you come from…" he trailed off meaningfully.</p><p>Yuan Miao and Min Zhuo exchanged glances, privately speculating about the Shaoshi's cryptic comment.</p><p>The Grand Consecrate chuckled, unmoved, his gaze fixed on the Shaoshi's sleeve.</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>The Shaoshi rose, a faint gleam flashing from his sleeve as a small, ochre scroll emerged.</p><p>In the next instant, he stood outside the palanquin. With a flick of his sleeve, the scroll blazed with light, unfurling slowly.</p><p>Intense ochre light radiated from the scroll, filling the sky and enveloping the surrounding ships and cultivators in a yellow glow.</p><p>The scroll hovered before the Shaoshi, its surface shimmering with light, depicting ever-shifting, fantastical scenes – neither mountains nor water, yet both.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after deploying the scroll, the Shaoshi remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the sea.  Lu Wang and the others didn't urge him, waiting silently.</p><p>Not far away, a dark shape appeared on the horizon – an island.</p><p>Lush and verdant, it seemed deserted.</p><p>The Shaoshi's expression shifted slightly.  The scroll flew towards the island, then suddenly inverted above it, its ochre light engulfing the entire landmass.</p><p>Then, an astonishing sight unfolded. As the ochre light spread, the island began to 'melt'.  Rock and earth softened, flowing from the mountaintops like a massive mudslide. Soon, all the peaks and hills dissolved, the entire island liquefying like a sand dune. Only the vegetation remained, flowing with the earth.</p><p>Suddenly, a yellow light erupted from the island, shooting towards the scroll. The earth and rock followed the light, flowing upwards, being absorbed by the scroll. In the blink of an eye, half the island was gone, the scroll seemingly possessing infinite space, its consumption relentless.</p><p>Finally, the entire island vanished, the sea filling the space, leaving no trace.</p><p>The scroll whipped back, its yellow light even more intense. Now, a swirling ochre wind could be seen within its image.</p><p>The Shaoshi's hands moved in rapid succession, casting several spells. The ochre wind rose, transforming into a violent gale that filled the sky.</p><p>The air turned dusky yellow.</p><p>High-cultivation practitioners looked down, astonished to discover a new landmass beneath them.</p><p>Clearly, this land was formed from the absorbed island, but far larger, due to thinner crust.</p><p>The army advanced, the Shaoshi continuously manipulating the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, absorbing countless islands. The soldiers no longer needed their ships, standing firmly on a vast, floating landmass that moved faster than any vessel, large enough to accommodate them all.</p><p>Finally ceasing his work, the Shaoshi pressed his palm downward. The scroll shuddered, sinking into the ground and disappearing.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, a satisfied expression on his face. He produced a jade slip and handed it to the Grand Consecrate.  "According to the marked locations on this, station guards to aid me in absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth, to further refine the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu. I do not wish to be disturbed during this process."</p><p>The Grand Consecrate replied solemnly, "We understand the gravity of the situation, and will not disturb the Shaoshi!"</p><p>The Shaoshi nodded, lightly tapped the ground, and vanished, disappearing into the earth.</p><p>Lu Wang and the others looked around. The land was a natural landscape of rolling hills, towering peaks, strange rocks, and dense forests – showing no signs of artificial creation.</p><p>The army was forming ranks on the land, awaiting orders.</p><p>The scene was as if they had brought their entire homeland with them, ready to fight for it.</p><p>Vast expanse of water, a tranquil blue.  A bird plunged into the sea, seizing a small fish.  As it prepared to return to the sky, a shadow suddenly enveloped it.</p><p>The bird looked up, astonished by the sight before it, dropping its prey unnoticed.  A landmass was flying in the sky, moving with incredible speed, vanishing towards the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"My Lord Lu, beyond this sea lies the Western Lands," Min Zhuo indicated, pointing ahead.</p><p>Lord Lu chuckled softly, "I wonder what preparations the remnants of the Yan Shan family have made to greet us."</p><p>Before the words had left his mouth, a dull rumble of thunder echoed from the east.  The sky was clear and the sun was high, yet the thunder was distinct. Those with weaker cultivation felt a surge of blood and unease as the sound reached them.</p><p>Lord Lu and his companions’ faces changed, their gazes fixed on the horizon. At first, the sky appeared calm and unremarkable. As the army advanced, however, the eastern sky suddenly darkened.</p><p>The darkness was fleeting, instantly illuminated by dazzling lightning. In the distance, countless thunder dragons and lightning serpents danced across the heavens, their power felt even from afar.</p><p>This was no ordinary thunderstorm. The lightning circled the sky, poised yet still, clearly a magical incantation. However, the scale of this spell was breathtaking; the horizon was a shimmering silver expanse, transformed into a boundless sea of thunder. It was impossible to fathom the amount of lightning contained within, or the terrifying power it could unleash.</p><p>"It's the Thunder Altar!"</p><p>The High Priest declared gravely, Lord Lu and the others’ expressions grew even more serious.  Everyone knew that among magical arts, thunder magic was the most ferocious.  Defensive thunder magic was rare; this Altar array was almost certainly a weapon of war!</p><p>One must enter the tiger's den to capture its cub!</p><p>The Siyou army did not halt, maintaining its speed as it approached the thunder sea.  The thunder roared, then a booming voice, louder than the thunder itself, rolled across the sky.</p><p>"Halt!"</p><p>Lord Lu looked to the High Priest, who understood immediately. He cast a spell, halting the landmass, creating a standoff with the thunder sea.</p><p>Then, a man from Lord Lu's retinue shouted, "Who are you? Why are you blocking our path!"</p><p>The other side didn’t respond, instead demanding fiercely, "Who are you? How dare you intrude upon my sacred grounds!"</p><p>"Hahahaha…" Lu Gan erupted in laughter, stepping forward, "Are you Qin Zhenren? Do you remember me?  Today, I'm here to settle our old score!"</p><p>The voice from the other side was cold, "So it's you. A defeated foe, hardly worth mentioning!"</p><p>Lu Gan seethed, coldly sneering, "You're facing your death and don't even realize it.  I warned you then, now is your chance to hand over that villain.  If you persist in your folly, today will be your end!"</p><p>Only a contemptuous sneer answered him.</p><p>At that moment, a figure appeared silently beside Lord Lu—the Master Tutor had emerged.</p><p>Lord Lu stopped Lu Gan from speaking further, flying into the air and bowing slightly,  "I am Lord Lu.  Qin Zhenren, why don't you show yourself and speak?"</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the thunder sea churned, coalescing into a human figure—an exact replica of Qin Sang.</p><p>He gave a casual bow, saying lightly, "Lord Lu of Hanjiang, I've heard much of you! Has Lord Lu led a personal expedition to vanquish me?"</p><p>Lord Lu wasn't offended, smiling serenely, "Qin Zhenren, you are free to leave at any time. We act under the Emperor’s orders to subdue rebels. War or peace depends on your choice."</p><p>He then glanced towards the figure behind Qin Sang, "Qin Zhenren is not of our people.  Why not bring out the true culprit?  Or is the esteemed Young Master of Yan Shan, along with the Yan King's top advisor, Xia Changshi, too cowardly to face us?"</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang’s true form presided over the main altar, while cultivators at the various subsidiary altars held their positions, jointly powering the array. The thunder sea was a manifestation of a portion of the array’s power; its true might remained hidden.  At the heart of the thunder sea, Qin Sang himself stood beside a feathered firebird, observing the unfolding events.</p><p>The firebird was Si Lu's companion beast. Si Lu knew he couldn’t escape and was prepared to confront them, but Lord Lu's provocation ignited his anger.</p><p>The firebird blazed, transforming into Si Lu's form. He nodded to Qin Sang and flew towards the front lines.</p>
