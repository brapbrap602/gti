<h1>Chapter Four Hundred: Perseverance</h1><p>The further Qin Sang went, the more alarming the scene became. Cracks began to appear in the ice beneath his feet.</p><p>At first, the cracks were small, just thin fissures snaking through the ice, barely visible without close inspection. Gradually, they multiplied, spreading like a spiderweb through the depths of the ice cave. These were clearly fresh cracks, raising concerns about the cave's stability.</p><p>The profound ice within the cave, ancient and incredibly hard, had existed for untold years.  Qin Sang knew, without the use of magical treasures, he himself could hardly cause such widespread damage. The epicenter of whatever caused this devastation was still further ahead. What had happened? What kind of enemy had Yun Youzi encountered?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>It happened again. The tremors weren't regular, sometimes occurring in quick succession, sometimes with long pauses in between.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, staring ahead in astonishment.  There, in the depths of the blizzard, stood an ice sculpture.  Within it, facing away from him, was a frozen figure.</p><p>Yun Youzi!</p><p>Even from behind, Qin Sang recognized him instantly. Yun Youzi was here, frozen solid. Encased in ice, he still stood tall within the ice cave, like an ancient pine rooted to the frozen ground, his back straight, facing the onslaught of the wind and snow.  Layer upon layer of snow and ice accumulated on him, thickening the icy shell.  Yun Youzi remained motionless.</p><p>The tremors that shook the ice cave, the force that had hinted at an encounter with an ancient beast, originated from even further ahead. Yet, Yun Youzi’s current condition was dire.  He exuded an aura of deathly stillness; Qin Sang couldn't sense his life force at all.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He was about to rush forward when a faint cracking sound, barely audible above the howling wind, stopped him. Only Qin Sang's sharp hearing could have picked it up.</p><p>The sound came from the ice encasing Yun Youzi.</p><p>Intrigued, Qin Sang paused and looked down at Yun Youzi's left leg.  Yun Youzi wasn't standing with his feet together; his left foot was half a step ahead of his right. At the moment the cracking sound occurred, a flicker of spiritual energy, a faint cyan glow, emanated from his legs, causing the ice to crack from within.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ice didn't shatter. The cracks were instantly filled and reinforced by the relentless wind and snow, leaving only faint lines.  No wonder Yun Youzi's icy shell was crisscrossed with so many fissures.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't given up.  His internal spiritual energy pulsed weakly, again and again, finally shattering the ice on his leg. Seizing the opportunity, he moved, taking a large step forward with his left leg, his body leaning slightly forward.</p><p>When he tried to move his right foot, he was once again imprisoned by the ice. He was now in an awkward position, his left leg stretched far forward, while his upper body remained upright, unyielding against the oppressive wind and snow.</p><p>That single step seemed to have consumed a tremendous amount of energy. Yun Youzi didn't continue. He held this position, seemingly gathering strength for the next step.</p><p>Qin Sang silently approached from behind, finally seeing Yun Youzi’s face.</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression was blank, his eyes closed.  His white hair and beard were frozen into stiff needles by the wind and snow. He looked like a lifelike ice sculpture. Only the faintest flicker of life force indicated that he was still alive, still fighting.</p><p>The Flawless Pearl floated before his forehead, while a cyan lamp rested on his chest.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood. Yun Youzi was relying on the Flawless Pearl to protect his spirit, resisting the invasion of the terrible cold. The cyan lamp likely served a similar purpose to the Red Elixir.</p><p>However, Yun Youzi was expending all his energy just to withstand the cold with the Flawless Pearl’s aid. He could barely spare any attention to maintain the cyan lamp.  Its flame was so weak it was almost invisible, flickering precariously. Keeping the lamp lit was a struggle, enough to prevent his body from freezing completely, but not enough to melt the ever-thickening ice.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't given up; he was constantly gathering strength. The cyan glow that had cracked the ice was the result of him accumulating enough power to take a single step. He was inching forward, step by agonizing step, until he reached this point.</p><p>Now, Yun Youzi was completely focused, his eyes closed, all his attention on the Flawless Pearl and the cyan lamp. Only his unwavering determination guided him forward. He was oblivious to Qin Sang’s presence beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Yun Youzi, then walked past him towards what he could see in the distance.  At the edge of his vision, in the depths of the blizzard, an ice-like flower swayed on the ice wall.</p><p>It was a lily.</p><p>The Nightfall Lily, a heavenly treasure!  It grew within the ice, its leaves and stem intertwined with the frozen surface, almost indistinguishable from it.  The flower, as crystalline as ice, looked incredibly delicate, as if it might shatter at the slightest touch.</p><p>In this harsh environment, the Nightfall Lily bloomed, proud and aloof. Like a fairy in the snow, it stood alone, untouched by the world.</p><p>The fierce wind and snow, powerful enough to destroy everything, parted around the Nightfall Lily, as if reluctant to disturb its tranquility.</p><p>Looking closely, Qin Sang noticed a spirit array surrounding the Nightfall Lily. It was likely set up by the cultivator who first discovered the lily, to protect and nurture it until maturity. The array not only shielded the lily from the harsh elements, but also concealed its aura, preventing its fragrance from attracting monstrous beasts.  For some reason, the cultivator never returned to harvest the mature Nightfall Lily.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Yun Youzi had gathered a little more strength and was trying again.  This time, the effort was short-lived. He only managed to move his right foot a short distance, less than half a step.</p><p>He paused again, continuing to prepare.  His face betrayed no frustration, no urgency, no despair.  Only calmness.</p><p>And beneath that calmness, a shockingly resilient strength.</p><p>Driven by his unwavering determination, Yun Youzi focused solely on the Nightfall Lily, inching forward step by step, unaware of Qin Sang beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Yun Youzi for a moment, then walked past him to the Nightfall Lily, examining it closely. He glanced at the lily itself, but his attention was primarily on the spirit array.</p><p>Good. The protective array around the Nightfall Lily wasn't a deadly killing formation. Its primary function was concealment. For a cultivator who reached this point, breaking the array wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang turned back to watch Yun Youzi, who had taken another step forward.  The ice encasing him was even thicker now.  The distance, though seemingly short, was a chasm for Yun Youzi in his current state. The closer he got, the fiercer the wind and snow became.  Yun Youzi was nearing his limit. Qin Sang wasn’t sure if he could make it.</p><p>The odds were against him.</p><p>A strong will wasn't always enough.</p>
