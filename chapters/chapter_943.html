<h1>Chapter 935: The Deal</h1><p>Hearing Bai’s self-defense, Qin Sang’s mind stirred. It seemed he wasn't the first cultivator to discover the Netherworld Fire.</p><p>This was normal.  While the Ghostlands were secluded, the Seven Kills Hall had opened countless times, with countless cultivators entering. Unless it was a true death trap, every corner would have been explored.  Many late-stage Golden Core cultivators, possessing treasures to withstand the purple mist’s poison, could delve deep into this place.</p><p>However, judging by Bai’s tone, Qin Sang seemed to be the first to traverse the Netherworld Fire and enter the Ghostlands.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He charged into the ghostly mist, using his sword wheel to carve a path.  His avatar and the two-headed… (creature name unclear, needs clarification in original text)  joined him.</p><p>Qin Sang, along with his avatar and the two-headed… (creature name), kept Bai talking to buy time while searching for his true form, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.</p><p>Finally, Bai's location was pinpointed by the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang calmly activated the *Lei Control Technique*.</p><p>Bai, empowered by manipulating the ghostly mist, had greatly increased his strength. However, the *Lei Control Technique*, wielding the supremely yang and powerful thunder force, had a certain counteracting effect on ghosts.  It could not only dispel the mist but also trap Bai within it.</p><p>Employing the *Lei Control Technique* might severely injure, or even destroy, the Flying Night Rakshasa, but Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate. Compared to the Rakshasa, the Ten Directions Yama Banner was far more important.</p><p>Bai’s offer of a trade made Qin Sang admit to a flicker of interest.  This person could be an ancient being who lived since antiquity, and even if he had lost his memories, any unintentional recollection could reveal shocking secrets, immensely beneficial to Qin Sang’s future cultivation.</p><p>But a trade wasn't Qin Sang’s preference.  Bai likely felt similarly; otherwise, he would have openly appeared and negotiated.</p><p>Bai obviously didn't anticipate Qin Sang's superior strength, that his mastery of the ghostly mist and resentful spirits couldn't suppress him. Hence, he proposed a trade under the guise of mutual benefit.</p><p>Besides, the Eighteen Demon Banners were what Qin Sang truly coveted.  A vague trade versus an easily obtainable top-tier magical treasure—he'd choose the latter.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>The *Lei Control Technique* neared completion. Electric arcs flashed across Qin Sang’s body, crackling loudly.</p><p>The surrounding ghostly mist and spirits, encountering their nemesis, shrieked and retreated.</p><p>"What secret technique are you using?"</p><p>Bai, sensing something amiss, became alert and cried out.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered without answering, his fingers weaving hand seals as he rapidly executed the technique.</p><p>The power of the *Lei Control Technique* began to manifest.  Electric lights flickered around Qin Sang, bathing him in thunder; an endless stream of thunder force surged towards his fingertips.  And his fingertips pointed directly at Bai’s hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang had tempered the *Lei Control Technique* by challenging heavenly thunder during a storm.  But the thunder he now commanded was different from heavenly thunder.  Not only was its power incomparable, but due to the presence of star煞 (unclear meaning, needs clarification in original text), it possessed a dark and gloomy aura, lacking the heavenly thunder's brilliance.</p><p>Even so, the *Lei Control Technique* wielded by Qin Sang was beyond the capabilities of a Golden Core cultivator to withstand.</p><p>"Woo…"</p><p>The resentful spirits within the ghostly mist felt the danger and grew restless.</p><p>For the first time, the composure vanished from Bai’s eyes. Previously, he had believed he could at least fight Qin Sang to a standstill, hence his arrogance.  Now he realized Qin Sang possessed the means to defeat, even kill him.</p><p>Bai was terrified, frantically darting through the ghostly mist to confuse Qin Sang.  But he was already locked onto by the Sky Eye Butterfly’s divine ability, rendering his efforts futile.</p><p>"Stop! I surrender!"</p><p>Bai screamed.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, his hand seals shifting.</p><p>Deep within the Ghostlands, thunder rumbled.</p><p>Qin Sang, with phoenix wings sprouting from his back, stood suspended in mid-air, his clothes billowing, his gaze cold.  He controlled the thunder, possessing an air of cleansing evil spirits and illuminating the world.</p><p>Of course, he wasn't that strong yet; he could only eliminate Bai and some of the surrounding resentful spirits.</p><p>With the thunder locked onto him, Bai felt doom approaching and panicked, repeatedly yelling: "Dare kill me, and you won't live either! There are powerful enemies lurking outside the Netherworld Fire; you'll die if you leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe his lies.</p><p>The only ones who could kill him now were Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>He considered himself very cautious.  While he had offended two Nascent Soul masters, he hadn't given them a reason, hiding for decades; how could they find him here?</p><p>Therefore, he remained unmoved, watching the technique nearing completion.</p><p>"Don't you have divination techniques?  Go check outside. Someone is lurking near the Infernal Fire! A Yuan Ying cultivator! Only I can help you escape and survive this!"</p><p>Bai regretted not having more mouths. Seeing Qin Sang remained stubborn, he almost bit through the steel teeth of his flying night-fork, his voice becoming sharp.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes flashed, his hand seals faltered slightly, a hint of doubt appearing.</p><p>Bai's tone didn't sound false. Could a powerful enemy really be watching?</p><p>The canyon is the only entrance to the Ghostland.</p><p>One man could hold the pass against ten thousand.</p><p>If what Bai said was true, with a Yuan Ying master guarding the canyon, escape would be impossible.</p><p>He had hidden himself perfectly, never revealing his intentions, and outsiders shouldn't know about his interest in the Nine Nether Infernal Fire. Who was blocking the entrance?</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang calm down, Bai breathed a sigh of relief, afraid Qin Sang would change his mind. He quickly swore, "This Ghostland is so small. Even if I deceive you for a while, can I deceive you forever? Where else can I run? If I lie, I'll willingly offer my neck to the blade!"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, staring into the depths of the ghost mist for a long time, then said indifferently, "Disperse the ghost mist first. I'll spare your life for now."</p><p>Bai remained silent for a moment before agreeing.</p><p>With a loud "boom," the ghost mist scattered. The vengeful spirits regained their freedom, causing another commotion.</p><p>Bai stood alone before Qin Sang, calmly meeting his gaze.</p><p>Qin Sang stared into Bai's eyes for a while, his arm trembled slightly, and the electric light around him slowly dissipated as the power of thunder retreated into his body.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai finally relaxed. "The deal I proposed... you had to see it to believe it.  That person is blocking the Infernal Fire. I'll use the ghost mist to hide our presence. Go and see for yourself…"</p><p>Bai, wisely, avoided any suspicious actions and proactively moved towards the Ghostland entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then followed closely, always ready to use the *Thunder Control Technique*. If Bai made a move, he would kill him instantly.</p><p>Soon, they arrived before the Nine Nether Infernal Fire.</p><p>After Bai gestured, he guided a wisp of ghost mist towards Qin Sang to conceal his figure and aura.</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached, hugging the rock face, sending out his Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe outside.</p><p>No one was there.</p>
