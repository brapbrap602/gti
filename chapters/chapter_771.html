<h1>Chapter 763: Resonance</h1><p>Compared to the Ebony Sword, the Two-Headed Serpent posed a greater threat.  There was no time to recall his natal spirit sword.</p><p>The young man's expression darkened.  Without hesitation, he urged the golden ring towards the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The golden ring shifted horizontally, its momentum no less than a storm, slamming into the wind blades.</p><p>A series of metallic clangs echoed within the storm as countless wind blades shattered, unable to penetrate the golden ring's defenses. A golden light pierced through the storm with unstoppable force.</p><p>After tearing through the storm, the golden ring swiftly returned.</p><p>The Ebony Sword had arrived by then. As the young man prepared to retrieve the golden ring, the Ebony Sword abruptly changed direction, heading straight for his wrist.</p><p>He instantly guessed Qin Sang's intention. The jade bracelet was his only protection against the poison and thus his opponent's only weak point.  Naturally, he valued the bracelet immensely and had been anticipating this, determined not to let his opponent succeed.</p><p>True Essence surged within him. His armor erupted with divine light, firmly shielding the bracelet as he retreated.</p><p>The golden ring flew back rapidly, unable to catch up, buzzing loudly. Suddenly, it erupted into a series of afterimages.</p><p>‘Swish…’</p><p>At this critical juncture, the Ebony Sword was caught by the golden ring's afterimages.</p><p>‘Crack… Crack…’</p><p>Crisp cracking sounds echoed as the Ebony Sword shattered the afterimages one by one. Although its momentum remained strong, the sword's light dimmed, clearly affected.</p><p>As more afterimages attacked, the Ebony Sword's speed drastically decreased.  It struggled mightily, like a fish trapped in a net.</p><p>Just then, the Ebony Sword abruptly stopped, and a burst of blood-red light splashed out.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The smile that had just appeared on the young man's face froze. He stared blankly at the jade bracelet.</p><p>His protective divine light had been useless, easily penetrated by the blood-red light.</p><p>The jade bracelet, affected by the bloody light, rapidly lost its luster, turning pale in the blink of an eye. The young man's cyan protective shield fluctuated violently before finally shattering.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a crisp sound, the jade bracelet broke in two and fell to the ground.</p><p>The bracelet was merely a poison-warding artifact crafted from a rare and unique spiritual material, specifically designed to counter the purple mist. It didn't possess inherently powerful abilities and was destroyed on the spot after being contaminated by the Bloodfiend Divine Light.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The jade bracelet hit the ground. The crisp sound resonated within the young man's heart like a thunderclap!</p><p>With his protection shattered, the purple mist surged forward. The young man was jolted awake and hurriedly channeled his True Essence, using all his strength to resist the poisonous mist.</p><p>His face was contorted with rage as he glared at Qin Sang, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>“You dare destroy my bracelet! You must die!” he roared furiously.</p><p>The bracelet was his most vital possession.  Without it in the Forbidden Purple Mist Zone, he would be constantly battling the poison's erosion, his strength drastically reduced.</p><p>If the bracelet weren't an artifact that needed constant activation, he would have stored it within his dantian.</p><p>He never imagined such a sinister method like the Bloodfiend Divine Light, capable of directly attacking an artifact's core, bypassing any protective divine light.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>The Ebony Sword flew back.</p><p>Its task complete, Qin Sang withdrew it into his Nascent Soul and summoned the Ten Yama Banners. Hearing the young man's roar, he scoffed, "I'd like to see who dies today…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly deployed the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>The banners unfurled, forming a defensive formation, shielding Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>At that moment, a golden light shot towards them.  Had Qin Sang been a moment slower, he would have been struck.  The golden light was aimed directly at his sleeve.</p><p>The young man's intention was clear: kill the Fat Silkworm and they would be back on equal footing, both facing the poisonous mist.</p><p>After losing the bracelet, his first instinct wasn't to flee but to attack Qin Sang with all his might, seizing the only opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang had exhausted nearly all his strength using the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, Sword Qi Resonance, and Sword Light Splitting to create the opportunity to destroy the bracelet.  He refused to let himself be cornered again.</p><p>Extremely alert, he noticed the young man's movement and instantly retreated into the Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>The golden ring, imbued with tremendous power, collided with the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>The banners trembled violently.</p><p>In an instant, the surroundings transformed into a ghostly realm, filled with chilling Yin energy.  Both middle-grade magical treasures, the golden ring and the Ten Yama Banners, were locked in a stalemate.</p><p>With the Two-Headed Serpent's assistance, the banners seemed to be gaining a slight advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately sensed the young man's weakening strength, clearly hampered by the poison.</p><p>This was his chance!</p><p>With a calm expression, Qin Sang rapidly formed hand seals. The Ten Yama Banners vibrated as Nine Nether Demon Fire erupted from the flags, converging into a torrent that surged towards the golden ring.</p><p>However, as the Nine Nether Demon Fire appeared, Qin Sang sensed a strange, inexplicable anomaly.</p><p>This sensation had only occurred once before, on Frostflame Island, triggered by the cold mist emanating from the Winter Nether Coldflame.</p><p>This time, the sensation was even stronger, almost urgent.</p><p>And the source of the resonance… was deep within the Forbidden Purple Mist Zone!</p><p>This was completely unexpected. He hadn't anticipated the Nine Nether Demon Fire reacting here.  Could there be some kind of spiritual fire hidden deep within the Forbidden Purple Mist Zone?</p><p>On Frostflame Island, the resonance had been triggered by the cold mist, a direct emanation of the Winter Nether Coldflame's power.</p><p>Could the purple mist here be related to a spiritual fire?</p><p>A spiritual fire capable of triggering the Nine Nether Demon Fire must be extraordinary, possibly on par with the Winter Nether Coldflame.</p><p>Frostflame Island had first attracted swarms of demonic beasts, then been occupied by a transformed demon and the Island Lord of Boundless Heaven Island.  Qin Sang had risked everything to steal a small wisp.</p><p>Even that small wisp, refined into a fire pearl, had become his strongest trump card.</p><p>So, upon sensing the Nine Nether Demon Fire's reaction, Qin Sang's heart surged with excitement.</p><p>This time, the spiritual fire was hidden deep within the Forbidden Purple Mist Zone, with no one to compete for it. If he could find it, he could at least refine several fire pearls, and if he could subdue it… even better.</p><p>The Winter Nether Coldflame was a power that even the Island Lord of Boundless Heaven Island and a transformed demon feared!</p><p>His only concern was the uncertainty of the spiritual fire's location and its distance. If it was at the heart of the Forbidden Purple Mist Zone, the poison there would be incredibly potent.  He wasn't sure if the Fat Silkworm could withstand it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang realized this wasn't the time to dwell on such thoughts. He instantly cleared his mind, suppressed the Nine Nether Demon Fire's restlessness, and urged it to counterattack the golden ring.</p><p>He had even used his only chance with the Bloodfiend Divine Light to deal with this young man.</p><p>Merely forcing him back wouldn't be enough.</p><p>Since the young man had shown murderous intent, Qin Sang, not one for mercy, wouldn't let him escape.</p><p>While the young man's attack seemed fierce, it couldn't be sustained. The threat of the poison would only intensify.  If he couldn't kill Qin Sang quickly, his only option would be to flee, escaping the poisonous mist's range as quickly as possible for any hope of survival.</p>
