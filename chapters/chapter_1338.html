<h1>Chapter 1330: A Change of Events</h1><p>“Everyone, rest assured. The power of the ancient prohibitions doesn’t extend beyond the dark clouds. However, if anyone dares to enter, it's a different story,” Daoist Cang Hong said, partly answering, partly warning.  “It seems Ye Laomo isn't here. Let's proceed according to the plan and split up.”</p><p>At this time, Tianmu Butterfly had also carefully searched the surroundings and found nothing unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze from the dark clouds and looked towards the depths of the Sinful God Palace.</p><p>This place was once a vast palace complex, but now it's difficult to guess what these palaces were used for.  Some palaces have collapsed, others are in ruins, strewn with rubble and debris; not a single intact structure remains.</p><p>A complete wasteland!</p><p>Countless ancient prohibitions float in the void, everywhere.  The Abyssal Ruins are insignificant compared to this place.  Myriad prohibitions intersect, layer upon layer, influencing each other, making many areas highly unstable and impassable!</p><p>Through the tireless exploration of cultivators from generations past in the Sinful Abyss, several relatively safe paths have been found.</p><p>“Where is the passage to the Ziwei Palace?”</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi asked.  Everyone was curious; they had been observing for a long time but couldn't find any apparent entrance.</p><p>“Above!”</p><p>Daoist Cang Hong raised his head, gazing into the depths of the Ziwei Palace. “It's hard to see from here. After crossing this palace ruin, you'll see a place where thunder gathers within the dark clouds; the passage is hidden there.  Our predecessors had noticed the anomaly and speculated, but the power of the thunder generated by the ancient prohibitions is too terrifying. Many tried but gave up; one predecessor even perished within.”</p><p>“You extracted the soul of the fiend and obtained the secret technique to control the ancient prohibitions?”</p><p>Someone interjected.</p><p>“Correct,” Daoist Cang Hong nodded. “The passage's prohibitions are intricately linked to the Ziwei Palace. Whenever the Ziwei Palace is dormant, the passage closes. Ye Laomo had to wait until now to enter. Even so, we can't stop him. The phenomenon of the passage opening isn't obvious, making it difficult to judge his movements...”</p><p>No longer harboring any hope, the group split up according to their pre-arranged assignments and entered the palace ruins.</p><p>Despite having a map, they remained cautious.</p><p>Qing Jun and Lu Boyuan led the way, providing cover, with Qin Sang in the middle using his Celestial Eye ability.</p><p>The palace complex was vast; they had been walking for half an hour.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang awakened the Fat Silkworm and Fire Jade Centipede. If there were any treasures or medicinal herbs here, they might be able to sense them.</p><p>He hadn't forgotten the sword spirit either, constantly monitoring the changes in the killing sword.</p><p>The three secret realms were connected; fragments of the killing sword were hidden in both the Ziwei Palace and the Seven Killing Hall, and the Sinful God Palace should be no exception.</p><p>Perhaps it had already been thoroughly looted, but after all this time, neither creature reacted, and the sword spirit showed no signs of awakening.</p><p>The path was winding.</p><p>After walking an unknown distance, Qing Jun at the front stopped, softly saying, “We're out!”</p><p>Outside the ruins, it remained dim and oppressive.</p><p>After emerging from the ruins, they saw what Daoist Cang Hong had described.</p><p>Deep within the Sinful God Palace, the frequency of lightning strikes in the dark clouds was higher than outside, as if attracted by something, with some continuously striking the same spot.</p><p>However, they were still far away and couldn’t see clearly.</p><p>Mountains stretched ahead, looming large.</p><p>Iron chains crisscrossed the mountains, and the ruins of ancient castles were faintly visible.</p><p>Flying was ill-advised in this place; after a brief pause, they used their body techniques to move towards the mountains.</p><p>The mountain peaks were treacherous, with cliffs everywhere, connected by thick iron chains.  A chilling wind blew, biting with icy cold.</p><p>Despite being Yuan Ying cultivators, the cold still affected them as they walked the chains, turning their faces pale.</p><p>After crossing several icy peaks, they found nothing of value.</p><p>Beyond the mountains lay a swamp.</p><p>Qing Jun took out the map, pointing to a location within the swamp. “One of the forbidden zones is here. The swamp’s filth has corrosive power; the further in you go, the stronger it becomes. Be careful everyone.”</p><p>Everyone summoned their treasures, maintaining a half-person height, and moved towards the target.</p><p>They encountered numerous ruins along the way, some completely destroyed, some still faintly glowing, but all broken and dilapidated.</p><p>Judging by their shape, these ruins looked like cages, countless cages in the vast swamp, holding an untold number of people.</p><p>After passing countless cages, they finally reached the forbidden zone.</p><p>This place is called a forbidden zone because it is unique, completely different from the other cages.</p><p>A large area, surrounded by empty space.  Other cells clearly encircled this one, indicating its central importance.</p><p>The forbidden area was ancient and heavily guarded, pitch-black.  Even from outside, everyone felt a sense of danger.</p><p>Four grey stone pillars protruded from the forbidden area's ceiling, only their tops visible, almost reaching the dark clouds.</p><p>Upon arrival, the group immediately made a discovery.  "The forbidden area has been opened! Ye Laomo has been here!"</p><p>A stone path led from the entrance to a black door. Its iron lock was broken, and the protective barrier destroyed!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The group reacted swiftly, dispersing and forming a battle formation.</p><p>The door was ajar, revealing a silent interior.</p><p>Someone questioned, "Could Ye Laomo be setting a trap, delaying us?"</p><p>"Possible!"</p><p>Qing Jun, bold and skilled, stated, "Let's investigate before deciding whether to contact the others."</p><p>The group carefully proceeded along the stone path.</p><p>Ye Laomo's trail was clear, leading straight to the path's end.  Doors along the way had been broken.</p><p>Without incident, they reached the forbidden area's depths.</p><p>"Only a few levels left before the core. If Ye Laomo is inside, we should summon reinforcements," Lu Boyuan stopped Qing Jun, transmitting his message.</p><p>The group quietly withdrew, contacting the other two teams of cultivators before taking up positions at the entrance.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the other two forbidden areas within the Zuishen Palace, Cang Hong Zhenren and Tongyou Mojun were leading their respective exploration teams.</p><p>They, too, found traces left by Ye Laomo, but quickly realized these were decoys, only present on the outer perimeter.</p><p>Upon receiving Qing Jun's message, the two teams immediately set off for the swamp forbidden area.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others waited outside, discussing their next plan.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang noticed something amiss in the depths of the dark clouds near the passage, and looked up sharply.</p><p>The others noticed the anomaly as well.</p><p>The surrounding lightning intensified, and a millstone-sized ring of lightning gradually formed at its center.</p><p>Initially small, the ring grew larger over time.</p><p>Streams of multicolored light erupted from the ring's center, scattering after entering the void.</p><p>The group exchanged glances.</p><p>Several Zuishen cultivators accompanying them looked equally bewildered.</p><p>Such phenomena had never been observed, even when the passage was previously opened!</p>
