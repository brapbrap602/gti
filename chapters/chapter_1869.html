<h1>Chapter 1860: Water Generates Wood</h1><p>Leaves fluttered wildly.</p><p>Spiritual flags stood tall, their banners unfurled.  Qin Sang retreated into the formation, immediately taking a pill and holding the Five Elements Crown in his palm. He then focused a portion of his consciousness on soothing the agitated spirit within the artifact.  He would likely need to rely on this treasure again soon, so calming the spirit was crucial to unleashing the Great Five Elements Forbidden Light again.</p><p>At that moment, the sky above clouded over, suddenly darkening.  Layers of shadowy waves washed across the celestial barrier.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sky barrier tore open, revealing a vaguely serpentine figure resembling a dragon.</p><p>All the spiritual flags trembled violently.  Celestial energy flowed within the flag array, converging towards the center as the flags shook, coalescing into a crescent-shaped, azure blade.</p><p>The blade pointed towards the rift in the sky.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A beam of azure light shot skyward!</p><p>The Wood Spirit Qi in the void seemed drawn to it, rushing frantically towards the blade.  The blade, like a bottomless pit, absorbed everything, growing increasingly brilliant. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a hundred-meter-long giant blade, its power surging to an astonishing degree.</p><p>With this single strike, it shattered the celestial barrier.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The aggressive wave of shadowy waters was cleaved in two. The black fish apparition, its eyes narrowing slightly, lashed out its tail, leaping into the air.</p><p>The Sea-Swallowing Clam beneath it silently merged with the shadowy waters, reappearing an instant later in front of the blade's path.</p><p>Now only palm-sized, the clam's two shells were half-open, its mouth aimed at the blade.  A sudden burst of white light erupted.</p><p>Upon contact with the white light, the blade, as if caught in an immense suction force, twisted and deformed.</p><p>Finally, the hundred-meter-long blade was completely swallowed by the seemingly tiny Sea-Swallowing Clam.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>The clam shells closed, all light instantly vanishing.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The Sea-Swallowing Clam vibrated wildly. With a whoosh, the shadowy waters surged back, engulfing the clam, its tremors gradually weakening.</p><p>The shadowy waters stopped spreading, gathering into a mass beneath the black fish apparition.</p><p>The black fish apparition's gaze pierced the celestial barrier, observing the scene below, its eyes flickering uncertainly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang take shelter within the formation and cease fleeing, Ling You Wang didn't immediately pursue him. Instead, he hovered above, observing the scene.</p><p>Within the formation:</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his gaze, his eyes half-closed.</p><p>The attack was sudden; he hadn't had time to do more. Earlier, he had only managed to set up this formation.</p><p>This formation was a flag array he'd purchased years ago in Jushan.  It was capable of both offense and defense, quite ingenious.</p><p>Because the array's characteristics were highly suited to the jungle domain, Qin Sang had paid a hefty price to acquire the flags.</p><p>The jungle domain was already highly advantageous to Qin Sang. Coupled with this flag array, he was confident in facing any opponent of the same level. Thus, after obtaining the array, he had merely mastered its deployment without spending more time refining and improving it.</p><p>But who could have imagined that he would attract a demon king?</p><p>During the chase, Ling You Wang had shown extremely keen perception.  Even with the flags integrated into the trees, it was difficult to conceal them from him.</p><p>As expected, the previous strike had not harmed Ling You Wang in the slightest.</p><p>It might be better to openly display the flag array to deter Ling You Wang and buy himself some time.</p><p>One fish and one man, one in the sky, one on the ground, faced off against each other.</p><p>The black fish apparition moved restlessly within the shadowy waters, like a hunter seeking the perfect moment to strike.</p><p>After its initial attack, the flag array fell somewhat silent as a new blade coalesced between the flags, poised to strike again.</p><p>At this moment, Ling You Wang understood why Qin Sang had desperately fled here: he had prepared a supporting formation in advance.</p><p>In this location, the formation's power far exceeded what it could achieve elsewhere.</p><p>However, to rely on a spiritual array to drive him back, a mere flag array wouldn't be enough.</p><p>If this young man only had these tricks, then his death sentence could be pronounced!</p><p>Below the celestial barrier, the lush forest spread out before him.  Ling You Wang took everything in, confirming there were no other hidden dangers, a sneer flashing in his eyes as he commanded the shadowy waters to tear open the celestial barrier and descend into the jungle domain.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Shadowy water poured down from the sky.</p><p>A black waterfall hung in the air, waves surging. The black fish apparition, like a swimming dragon, descended.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed unaware of the scene above, his eyes closed, standing motionless beneath the flag array.</p><p>Under the impact of the waterfall and the black fish apparition, the flags flapped violently, yet the blade image within the array did not strike; with a *bang*, it shattered, returning to celestial energy, swirling around the flag array.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The surrounding Wood Spirit Qi was also stirred, converging and initially drawn by the celestial energy, forming a giant vortex above the flag array.</p><p>A thick, jade-green light enveloped the flag formation above, like a heavy, jade canopy.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A waterfall crashed against the canopy, the earth shook, and the shockwave swept outwards, shattering countless ancient trees.  The surrounding area was in ruins.</p><p>The force was immense, yet it failed to pierce the canopy, only causing it to tremble slightly. Qin Sang within the spirit array remained unharmed.</p><p>At that moment, the black fish apparition’s aftershock arrived.  From above, it surveyed the scene and lashed out with its two long whiskers.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Sea Swallowing Clam appeared beside the apparition, its treasure inverted, its two shells wide open.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>The dark waves, as if guided, parted into two streams, flowing towards either side of the canopy and solidifying there.</p><p>The waves rose higher and higher, forming two colossal walls of water in an instant, trapping the flag formation and Qin Sang between them.</p><p>The two walls of water resembled the Sea Swallowing Clam, and the moment they formed, they squeezed inwards with a thunderous roar.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The cliffs collapsed in a cataclysmic event.  The terrifying water waves were merely a superficial manifestation; the flag formation endured unimaginable pressure. The canopy deformed, several sections disintegrating, threatening to burst at any moment.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Two bolts of lightning suddenly streaked through the darkness, striking the canopy in rapid succession.</p><p>These "lightning bolts" were actually the black fish apparition's whiskers, the treasure remaining fused with them.  The whiskers left two prominent whip marks on the canopy's surface. Before the fissures could close, they lashed out again.</p><p>The lightning strikes continued relentlessly, like a torrential storm.</p><p>Even with the flag formation's power and the canopy's resilience, it couldn't withstand the continuous attacks from the two treasures.</p><p>*Bang bang bang…*</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>…</p><p>The spirit array trembled, and the jade-green light on the flags fluctuated violently.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang finally opened his eyes, storing the Five Elements Crown.  He inwardly examined his energy sea, sighed, looked up at the sky, and underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p>He fully unleashed his spirit wood body. His body rapidly grew taller, his limbs elongated, his skin became rough, and the poisonous hairs on his body resembled moss on tree bark.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang transformed completely into a tree spirit!</p><p>Just then, the whiskers struck the canopy again, finally tearing it apart.  The torrent of water surged in, the canopy collapsing into shapeless ruin.</p><p>Cracks appeared on the shafts of some flags, and some banners threatened to detach from their poles.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed. He swept his sleeve, gathering the remnants of the array, transforming himself into a withered tree.</p><p>Ling You Wang immediately sensed the simultaneous disappearance of the flag formation and Qin Sang’s aura. All his attacks landed on empty space.  Surprise flickered in his eyes as he abruptly turned, his gaze fixed on a distant ancient tree.</p><p>Within a breath, the tree withered, its leaves falling. A tall tree spirit emerged from the tree trunk, leaving behind the dry tree.  They met eyes, neither yielding.</p><p>From his poisonous hairs to his transformation into a tree spirit, Qin Sang's form remained unusual.</p><p>His aura confirmed the tree spirit was Qin Sang. The black fish apparition's surprise deepened; it sensed that Qin Sang’s depleted blood energy had been rapidly restored to its peak.</p><p>Had he consumed precious elixir, or was there another secret here?</p><p>Having attained the rank of Demon King, Ling You Wang could directly absorb energy from the world to nourish himself. Even after self-reducing his cultivation, he could still utilize the remnants of his apparition to retain some of his Demon King abilities.</p><p>While far from his peak, he appeared to be at the level of a peak Demon Marquis, his recovery speed far surpassing that of a Demon Marquis.  After chasing Qin Sang for so long, he showed no signs of fatigue.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly couldn't match this, so why was his recovery so rapid?</p><p>Ling You Wang scrutinized Qin Sang, sensing the unique aura of the spirit wood body, and a guess formed in his mind.  With a subtle thought, his two whiskers lashed out at Qin Sang.</p><p>White tendrils tore through the air.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>In that instant, his vision seemed to contain only those two lightning bolts, a sense of impending annihilation overwhelming him.  Without hesitation, he silently activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal and threw a punch.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A fierce gust of wind created a violent thunderclap in the void, instantly clashing with the two lightning bolts.</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>*Snap!*</p><p>Qin Sang's arm trembled, his feet retreated, then he saw a flash of white as the whiskers attacked again.</p><p>The whiskers were like two agile dragons.</p><p>With his spirit wood body, the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, Ming Shan Armor, and the occasional use of the Wandering Cloud Sword, Qin Sang fought Ling You Wang on equal footing.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, ordering Tian Mu Die to watch the Sea Swallowing Clam.  Unexpectedly, Ling You Wang showed no intention of using the treasure, instead only fighting with his two white whiskers.</p><p>This played right into Qin Sang's hands.  Qin Sang suddenly abandoned his defensive stance, turning to attack the black fish Dharma image in a reckless, furious counterattack.</p><p>The battlefield shifted constantly, leaving a trail of smoke and devastation in the forest.  Through the dust, a monstrous fish and a tree-like figure clashed relentlessly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A deafening sound echoed as the two figures separated after a fierce collision. Qin Sang retreated a thousand meters, gasping for breath, his ferocity undiminished.  The black fish Dharma image also appeared grim, clearly strained.</p><p>Pain shot through Qin Sang's body, the injuries and depleted blood signifying the intensity of the battle. Yet, he showed no sign of retreat.  He shuddered, and a green light enveloped him.</p><p>The surrounding wood spirit energy surged into Qin Sang like a whale swallowing water, healing his wounds and rapidly replenishing his Qi.</p><p>"As expected!"</p><p>Ling You Wang's expression shifted, unsurprised.  Instead of shock, a cold sneer played on his lips.  "Mere showmanship!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat at Ling You Wang's gaze, a foreboding sensation washing over him.  The confidence drawn from the forest seemed to falter.</p><p>The black fish Dharma image then rose, its dark waves surging towards the sky, transforming into thick rain clouds that covered a vast expanse.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A torrential downpour suddenly erupted.</p><p>The rain was fierce.  Qin Sang stood alone, unable to fathom Ling You Wang's intentions.  He dared not let the rain touch him, using his zhenyuan to deflect the water.</p><p>However, he soon discovered the rain possessed no special power, just ordinary raindrops, harmless.</p><p>The relentless rain continued, accumulating on the ground, filling every pit and valley, forming rivers that flowed freely.  The area was saturated with moisture, the rain greedily absorbed by the plants.</p><p>Then, a strange phenomenon occurred.  The trees within the rain's reach seemed nourished, suddenly growing wildly.  Trees killed in the battle were reborn.  New saplings sprouted and grew into towering trees in moments, their growth unrelenting.</p><p>Soon, the forest in this area towered above its surroundings, a striking contrast.  The wood spirit energy became increasingly dense.</p><p>"Water nourishes wood?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, deducing the cause of this change, a principle of the five elements' generative cycle.</p><p>But why would Ling You Wang do this?  This was akin to supplying him with wood spirit energy—the more he had, the stronger he would become.  Was Ling You Wang actively aiding his enemy?</p><p>But as Qin Sang continued to draw on the wood spirit energy, he was shocked to discover an unexpected impediment.  The more new wood spirit energy appeared, the greater the obstruction, affecting even the normal wood spirit energy.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang finally understood Ling You Wang's plan!</p><p>Ling You Wang, through some unknown ability, had caused the wood spirit energy generated from the rain-nourished plants to repel his wood body, as if it were still under Ling You Wang's control.  This wood spirit energy was mixed in with the normal wood spirit energy.</p><p>While unable to completely block Qin Sang from absorbing wood spirit energy, it significantly slowed his recovery, increasing his burden until it became unbearable.</p><p>Ling You Wang had cleverly used this method to counter the invincible Houtian Wooden Man Stele!</p><p>The rain beat down, *pitter-patter*, like a rhythm echoing in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang froze, transforming into a withered tree.  He then emerged from a living tree outside the rain.</p><p>Ling You Wang, no longer a demon king, lacked the power to cover the entire forest, nor to completely harness its boundless wood spirit energy. Qin Sang could simply use his spatial displacement to continuously move, exhausting Ling You Wang.</p><p>However, looking up, Qin Sang saw the Sea Swallowing Clam appear above, instantly draining the rainwater, and the forest returned to normal.</p><p>The Sea Swallowing Clam then turned towards Qin Sang, showering him with endless water.</p><p>The rain followed.</p><p>In an instant, the surroundings were transformed into a watery expanse. Two long whiskers, accompanying the rain, struck down like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang, like a trapped beast in the rain, fought before moving to another location to recover.</p><p>Ling You Wang seemed to be at his wit's end, unable to further restrict his spatial displacement.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew it couldn't be that simple.  He was racking his brain, searching for a solution.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, neither combatant noticed a figure appearing beyond the sky, gazing down before fading, silently approaching. </p>
