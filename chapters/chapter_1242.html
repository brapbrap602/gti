<h1>Chapter 1234: Encounter</h1><p>Qin Sang and Pang Ji were both startled.</p><p>They were avoiding Fenglei Mountain, doing nothing, yet still alarmed the Blood Thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted quickly, enveloping Pang Ji with his true essence and instantly escaping a great distance.  However, the Blood Thunder, like a malignant tumor, pursued relentlessly, no matter how many times Qin Sang changed direction, he couldn't shake it off.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood instantly, quickly withdrawing his spiritual sense while his figure swiftly moved.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The Blood Thunder finally gave up the chase and retreated, leaving behind residual thunder power in the air like scattered blood blossoms, quickly dissipating.</p><p>Pang Ji was still shaken.</p><p>While being pursued by the Blood Thunder, it felt its demonic blood was about to freeze, its body stiff, locked by the Blood Thunder's power. If struck, it could have been seriously injured.</p><p>If the Blood Thunder possessed any other strange abilities, the consequences would have been far worse than just injury.</p><p>It turned to Qin Sang, unsure if it was its fault, or something Qin Sang had done, that had alarmed the Blood Thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then transmitted his voice: “Stay behind me, focus on activating the Thunder Bead, sense your mother's location, don't do anything else.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Pang Ji knew that to rescue its mother here, it could only rely on Qin Sang and obeyed implicitly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fenglei Mountain and moved again, this time further away.</p><p>He used his spiritual sense to probe; this time the Blood Thunder didn’t react.</p><p>“This Blood Thunder is truly strange, able to sense spiritual sense.  Even if the spiritual sense doesn't touch the Blood Thunder, as long as it gets close, it will be pursued. However, the Blood Thunder's range of perception is limited; just be mindful of concealing your spiritual sense and stay far away.  The warnings of our ancestors were not groundless…”</p><p>Qin Sang moved, probing the rules of the Blood Lake.</p><p>Gradually gaining insight, he began to accelerate.</p><p>…</p><p>“Master, ahead seems to be the strange mountain marked on the fragment.”</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Pang Ji saw a stone mountain, rising straight up and down, like a sheer stone pillar, very eye-catching, suitable as a landmark. The fragment depicted just such a mountain.</p><p>The scenery here was drastically different from the Fenglei Mountain they'd seen before.</p><p>There were no Blood Thunders or阴风 (yin feng, chilling wind) here, but the mountain was covered with blood-red strange trees.  These blood trees, rooted in the crevices, grew horizontally, like spikes growing out of the mountain, making the whole mountain resemble a spiked club.</p><p>The blood trees themselves were as hard as metal, the leaves like iron sheets with jagged edges, surrounded by blood-red clouds. If anyone were caught here, they would suffer the agony of being sawn apart and their soul corroded.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the fragment, located the mountain, and observed the surrounding terrain, confirming it was the place.</p><p>“According to the markings on the map, the inner Blood Lake is considered North, and we’ve landed on the southwest side. From here, going straight east, and back and forth twice, we'll have almost explored the outer perimeter of the Blood Lake…”</p><p>Qin Sang acted according to the plan.</p><p>Pang Ji followed Qin Sang closely, diligently activating the Thunder Bead, but to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang silently recorded what he saw and heard. The outer perimeter was relatively easy because places similar to Fenglei Mountain were all separated by a distance; the intervening areas were safe.</p><p>But this only applied to the outer perimeter.</p><p>…</p><p>In a field of chaotic rocks, there was a giant pit hundreds of meters in diameter, bottomless and mysterious.</p><p>At this moment, a Golden Core cultivator, a treasure mirror on his head, was slowly descending into the depths of the pit.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>From time to time, blood-congealed tentacles emerged from the pit, whipping at the cultivator, with immense strength.</p><p>His expression was calm; the treasure mirror on his head shimmered with seven-colored light, transforming into a soft barrier that yielded to the force of the tentacles, softening their impact; he hadn't been breached yet.</p><p>The blood-colored tentacles were imposing, but the cultivator had pre-emptively set up hidden restrictions at the entrance, making it impossible for anyone passing by to detect anything unusual.</p><p>This cultivator was engrossed in his fight against the endless tentacles emerging from the pit, completely unaware that a man and a beast had arrived, observing everything.</p><p>It was Qin Sang and Pang Ji.</p><p>Although the cultivator's restrictions were ingenious, they could not withstand the Celestial Eye divine ability.</p><p>He was the second person Qin Sang had encountered.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered two cultivators, both Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Qing Jun and the others must have already gone ahead.</p><p>“These fellows indeed have expert guidance, their goals are clear, not all here to die. It seems that all factions have hidden information, not completely ignorant of the Blood Lake.”</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, silently nodding.</p><p>After two glances, Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and moved towards the distance.</p><p>These Golden Core cultivators’ knowledge was limited; capturing them was pointless.</p><p>Qin Sang observed that the restrictions in this cave were formidable, requiring considerable effort even for him.  He couldn't afford to waste time here.</p><p>After searching for a long time, the Thunder Bead remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Thunder Falcon Yao Wang, if still alive, was unlikely to be trapped in the outer regions of the Blood Lake.</p><p>If trapped deeper within the Blood Lake, he risked being caught in the crossfire of the cultivators from the two realms.  Qin Sang didn't want to be the first to engage, but he couldn't delay too long either.</p><p>Continuing his advance, Qin Sang occasionally tested the power of the ancient restrictions.</p><p>As he hurried along, just as Qin Sang was about to pass between two peaks, his expression suddenly changed. He urgently ordered Fat Chicken, "Return to the Unity Ring immediately!"</p><p>Fat Chicken was startled, fearing danger. It quickly scanned its surroundings, but found everything calm.</p><p>Blood energy swirled and blood thunder frequently erupted from the peaks on either side, but they were still far away, unlikely to attack suddenly.</p><p>Despite this, Fat Chicken dared not be negligent.  It knew its master's abilities far surpassed its own and there must be a reason, so it quickly retracted the Thunder Bead and hid inside the Unity Ring.</p><p>The bracelet glowed, and Qin Sang flicked his sleeve; his figure vanished.</p><p>After disappearing into the shadows, Qin Sang cautiously activated his Celestial Eye ability, peering through the peaks towards a distant mountain.</p><p>It was a barren peak, desolate and strewn with rocks; nothing else, and no one.</p><p>But through Qin Sang's vision, there was a subtle difference in the mountain's appearance. On a protruding rock platform, a faint white light, invisible to the naked eye, indicated something unusual.</p><p>The sight of the white light evoked a familiar feeling.</p><p>The light was shrouded in chaos.</p><p>With the enhanced Celestial Eye butterfly's abilities, Qin Sang faintly discerned a magical artifact emitting the white light, and within the light, a figure.</p><p>"It's him!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Before he could see the figure clearly, he ordered the Celestial Eye butterfly to withdraw its power to avoid detection.</p><p>He would never forget this artifact: Dongyang Bo's lifebound treasure – the Diamond Wheel!</p><p>Back at the Purple Micro Palace, Dongyang Bo had used the Diamond Wheel to capture him and take him to the bronze hall to threaten Chenyan. Without the Blood Impurity Radiance, Qin Sang would likely not have survived.</p><p>"He's not with Shijie and the others? What's he doing here?"</p><p>Qin Sang believed his chances of success were slim and hadn't planned to act now, but unexpectedly, he encountered Dongyang Bo in the outer reaches of the Blood Lake.</p>
