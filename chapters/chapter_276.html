<h1>Chapter 269: The Ten Great Sacred Trees</h1><p>“Brother Qin, focus
    on recovering first. This old Daoist can still hold on for a while.”</p><p>Yun Youzi urged Qin Sang to recover
    quickly as he steered the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.</p><p>Qin Sang took out two bottles of Green Spirit Pills and
    handed them to Yun Youzi in case of emergencies. He discreetly gripped the Ten Yama Banners in his palm and sat
    cross-legged on the flying boat, beginning to meditate.</p><p>The fire spirits pursued them relentlessly, but the
    Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was even faster than the last time Qin Sang had seen it. The situation was tenuously
    stable.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly relied on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. Once the Jiao Dragon spirit within it
    recovered, he estimated its speed would at most be comparable to the flying boat.</p><p>However, the flying boat
    seemed to consume little spiritual energy, while the talisman's consumption was astonishing. From this perspective,
    the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, with only one Jiao Dragon spirit, was inferior to the flying boat.</p><p>It was
    evident how extraordinary the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat was. With this treasure, even if Yun Youzi couldn't defeat a
    Foundation Establishment cultivator, escaping wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>While recovering, Qin Sang started a
    conversation with Yun Youzi.</p><p>“My experience is similar to yours, Senior. I don't know what happened in the
    legacy ruins. The caverns suddenly collapsed, and those fire spirits appeared out of nowhere…”</p><p>Qin Sang echoed
    Yun Youzi's account.</p><p>Yun Youzi sighed. “Before entering the ancient cultivator’s ruins, several seniors warned
    us. Now it seems something must have happened above. If we can't find a way out, we can only drift along. No one
    knows where the River of Magma ultimately leads. This old Daoist fears being stranded alone in some unknown
    dangerous place, unable to escape. Fortunately, I met Brother Qin. At least we can look out for each other in times
    of danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. Yun Youzi was right. Two people were better than one, and Yun Youzi's
    flying boat was a significant advantage.</p><p>“Senior, have you encountered any locations where the circular
    restrictions have weakened? Perhaps they couldn't withstand the tremors and have cracked.”</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his
    head. “No, I’ve only explored underground twice. Once was an underground palace filled with firebirds several times
    stronger than those in the Trial Space. I didn't dare go down there. The second time was this one. Have you
    encountered any, Brother Qin?”</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Qin Sang nodded. “To be honest, Senior, when I
    was in the Trial Space, I happened to be assigned to the lowest chain. At first, I didn't understand the rules of
    the trial and went down to take a look. I found that the restrictive formations in the Trial Space were dim, and
    there were even cracks on them. Although they were still strong then, after the tremors, they might be breakable.
    However… I'm not sure where the Trial Space is located.”</p><p>Escaping was the priority. Qin Sang found a reason to
    share his discovery with Yun Youzi to discuss it together.</p><p>Hearing this, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up. He pondered,
    “The Trial Space and the ancient cultivator's ruins seem to be two separate spaces, but they are essentially one,
    separated by restrictions and connected by the stone stele. It might be near the stele.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in
    agreement. "That's what I thought as well.”</p><p>“It’s worth a try!”</p><p>Yun Youzi’s spiritual energy flashed,
    and the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat immediately changed direction, rushing into a tributary.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced
    down at the four spirit bamboos on the flying boat and casually asked, “Senior, this bamboo boat is astonishingly
    fast. What kind of spirit bamboo is it made of? It’s quite extraordinary.”</p><p>He only asked casually, not really
    expecting Yun Youzi to explain everything.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi didn’t hesitate and said with some pride,
    “This flying boat is this old Daoist's proudest creation. It's made from four stalks of Flying Spirit Bamboo, which
    I obtained by chance. Although this bamboo is not one of the Ten Great Sacred Trees, it’s a rare spirit bamboo,
    known for being extremely light. After refining it into a flying boat, this characteristic gives it such speed. I’ve
    faced many life-threatening situations during my travels, and it was this boat that saved me. Oh… I remember Brother
    Qin’s natal spirit sword is a pure wood embryo. Do you need spirit wood to enhance it?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang nod,
    Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment, then said, “Brother Qin, if you need it, I can give you a section of Flying Spirit
    Bamboo after we escape this danger.”</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned and waved his hands repeatedly. “How can I accept
    this? This flying boat is so important to you, Senior. How can I damage it? I don't deserve such a generous
    gift!”</p><p>He never expected Yun Youzi to be so generous, offering such a precious gift after a casual
    conversation. He really didn’t dare to accept it, and even felt a bit wary.</p><p>Yun Youzi smiled and explained,
    “Don’t worry, Brother Qin. This bamboo has already been refined into a magical tool. As long as its essence isn’t
    damaged, this old Daoist only needs to nurture it for a few days to replenish the missing part. It won't affect the
    tool’s power. Of course, the separated Flying Spirit Bamboo won’t be as good as the original. It will be similar to
    ordinary spirit wood, but it will still retain some of the Flying Spirit Bamboo’s characteristics, which is quite
    rare.”</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood, but still shook his head and refused, "Thank you for your kindness,
    Senior. Unfortunately, my natal spirit sword is special. It requires the most primordial spirit wood. Refined spirit
    wood has altered spirituality, not only unable to improve it, but actually harmful to the spirit sword."</p><p>"I
    see…"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded thoughtfully and consoled him, "Brother Qin, don't be discouraged. Flying Spirit Bamboo
    is not the only unique marvel in the world. You will eventually find spirit wood of the same level in the future.
    Perhaps you'll have the chance to obtain one of the Ten Sacred Trees and elevate your natal spirit sword to the
    level of a magical treasure in one fell swoop."</p><p>"Senior, please don't tease me. The Ten Sacred Trees only
    exist in legends. They are divine objects that even Nascent Soul ancestors covet. I've only seen them in ancient
    texts. I don't even know if any exist in the entire Small Cold Region."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile. Of course,
    he desired the Ten Sacred Trees. Not even a whole section, but even a small piece would suffice to eliminate his
    worries about the Ebony Sword's quality before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>But such divine objects were
    a matter of chance, not something one could actively seek. With the decline of the cultivation world today, the very
    existence of the Ten Sacred Trees was questionable.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi gave a
    mysterious smile, "Brother Qin, you underestimate the Small Cold Region and the Ancient Battlefield. From what I
    know, let's not even talk about distant occurrences, within the last ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have
    appeared at least three times!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up and asked in surprise, "Do they really
    exist in the Ancient Battlefield? How do you know, Senior?"</p><p>"I also heard it from my master, Realist
    Piaoya…"</p><p>Yun Youzi explained briefly, then began to elaborate for Qin Sang, "The Ancient Battlefield was
    formed from the great battles of ancient mighty figures. Deep within the battlefield, spatial rifts are dense and
    dangers abound. Even Nascent Soul cultivators dare not trespass. There are some immortal abodes that have never been
    explored. Whenever one appears, it is accompanied by countless rare treasures. My master said that within the last
    ten thousand years, the Ten Sacred Trees have indeed appeared three times. However, only a few were qualified to
    compete for them, so the news didn't spread widely and remained largely unknown." </p>
