<h1>Chapter 1974: The Coiling Dragon Celestial Pillar</h1><p>White clouds drifted above the battlefield.</p><p>Cultivators, both righteous and demonic, crowded one side of the clouds.  On the other side stood Qin Sang alone, yet no one dared approach him.</p><p>The scene wasn't so much a confrontation between righteous and demonic forces, but rather Qin Sang facing off against a multitude.</p><p>Qin Sang's presence had turned the tide of the battle. Three powerful late-Yuan Ying demonic cultivators had fallen to him in succession, throwing the demonic ranks into chaos.</p><p>The righteous cultivators, however, hadn't taken advantage of this to wipe out the demons. Instead, they were wary of Qin Sang.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang's displayed cultivation hadn't surpassed the Yuan Ying stage, yet he exerted unparalleled pressure on everyone.</p><p>Those who had personally engaged Qin Sang felt it most acutely.</p><p>No matter what techniques or treasures they used, Qin Sang could instantly see their weaknesses.  He'd use comparable or even weaker power, yet always strike first, defeating them with a single move, leaving them floundering and struggling to defend themselves.</p><p>His other methods seemed unremarkable; his terrifying perception was his only apparent weapon.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi and the cloaked figure observing from afar couldn't discern more.</p><p>Sent by the two major factions, both possessed early-Transformation Deity cultivation, enough to overawe the various forces.</p><p>In their eyes, Qin Sang was undeniably a late-Yuan Ying cultivator; he showed no trace of Transformation Deity aura.</p><p>This only made them more uneasy.</p><p>How could a Yuan Ying cultivator have such uncanny perception?</p><p>The cloaked figure said coldly, "This person is likely from Mount Yun Du, isn't he?"</p><p>Human affairs are settled among humans.</p><p>This game wouldn't be played by the two major factions themselves.</p><p>However, there was always a chance of underhanded tactics.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi scoffed, "Dealing with you demonic scum requires no such methods!  Qingfeng Daozhang established the Green Sheep Temple in the mortal world, dispensing medicine and healing the sick, tempering himself in the mundane world. I only accidentally learned of a reclusive master in Yan, and spent considerable effort to recruit Qingfeng Daozhang.  It's simply your bad luck, missing out on such a master!"</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>The cloaked figure gave Qin Sang a deep look, stamped his foot, causing the mountain peak below to tremble, then vanished into the air.</p><p>They had lost this round.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi smiled, watching the cloaked figure go, then used a sound transmission technique: "Daozhang Qingfeng, might I have a word with you?"</p><p>The voice reached Qin Sang's ears. He nodded slightly and flew towards them.</p><p>His movement caused an immediate stir among the cultivators.  The ancestors of both righteous and demonic sides looked thoughtful, silent, and dared not leave, as if awaiting a final judgment.</p><p>"I am Yun Shan, greetings, Daozhang," Yun Xian Shi stood on the mountaintop, bowing distantly with an easy demeanor.</p><p>"You must be Yun Xian Shi. My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Qin Sang landed gracefully.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi said humbly, "Thank you, Daozhang, for upholding justice and subduing the demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't respond, but smiled faintly, "My rather inept disciple is ambitious but lacking in talent. Fortunately, he received your patronage and avoided becoming a laughingstock.  I am indebted to you, Xian Shi."</p><p>Yun Xian Shi laughed heartily, "Your disciple is righteous and unparalleled. If it were anyone else, I wouldn't have bothered!  He'll bear the weight of the world in the future, Daozhang, so don't be too protective!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "Xian Shi means the turmoil isn't over?"</p><p>"Precisely!" Yun Xian Shi said seriously, "The demonic forces are strong, disrupting the mortal realm. The fate of a single region cannot decide the overall situation.  I'll certainly need your help in the future."</p><p>After a pause, Yun Xian Shi added, "Daozhang's triumph over the demonic evils is undeniable. In the future rewards will not disappoint."</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi glanced at the direction where the cloaked figure left, "Daozhang's appearance will draw the attention of the demons, making you a thorn in their side. Be careful in the future!"</p><p>"I'm a humble mountain hermit, rarely leaving the Green Sheep Temple. Let them come if they dare."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a cold smile.</p><p>He wouldn't fear any demons. The more, the merrier!  It would be best if several more true disciples from the Falling Soul Abyss came; to truly stir the waters.</p><p>Then who would remain neutral?</p><p>Let them see this game wasn't so easy to play!</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, transformed into a green light, and soared into the sky, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>He seemed to have come and gone at will, intervening only a few times.  The victory or defeat of the righteous and demonic cultivators had nothing to do with him.</p><p>He exuded an air of carefree freedom.</p><p>Yun Xian Shi slowly retracted his smile, thoughtful.  Even face-to-face, he couldn't be certain of Qin Sang's cultivation.</p><p>The mortal realm lacked the spiritual energy of Mount Yun Du and Mount Mu Luo, but occasionally produced a Transformation Deity cultivator.</p><p>Each additional Nascent Soul cultivator significantly increases our chances of victory.</p><p>Master Yun withdrew his gaze, looked towards the battlefield, pondered for a moment, then flew over calmly to clean up the aftermath.</p><p>Yu Lang achieved his ambition; the Yan Kingdom unified the land, and its monarch established an unprecedented achievement.</p><p>Afterward, before the imperial dais, there were not only mortals but also cultivators.</p><p>However, the war was far from over.  Yu Lang's desired golden age might be a long time coming.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Sensing his avatar's return, Qin Sang's main body eyelids flickered, drawing some of his attention away from the altar.</p><p>At this moment, the altar beneath him was radiant and wondrous, far exceeding its former state.</p><p>The main altar's repair was complete, signifying the restoration of the entire array.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood what the fourth-order spirit talisman was.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang voraciously absorbed everything, marveling at the profoundness of the fourth-order talisman and the wonder of the Thunder Altar.</p><p>A fourth-order talisman shouldn't be something a Void Refinement cultivator should be able to handle, yet Qin Sang, with the aid of the Thunder Altar and the array, was able to access and partially comprehend its mysteries.</p><p>It was this Thunder Altar that gave Qin Sang the confidence to face two Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes; his pupils flashed with lightning, his eyes seeming to contain two balls of thunder.</p><p>Only when his intense gaze softened could one see that the lightning in his eyes was a reflection of the fourth-order talisman.</p><p>"Whew…"</p><p>After a long time, Qin Sang let out a long breath, and the strange phenomenon in his eyes gradually disappeared.</p><p>"What a powerful fourth-order talisman!  What an amazing Thunder Talisman!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>The power was too strong, too profound; it deeply attracted him, and he was almost unable to extricate himself.</p><p>At intervals, he had to withdraw his attention, fearing he would become completely immersed.</p><p>He blinked, and his eyes returned completely to normal.</p><p>After resting for a while, Qin Sang once again immersed his mind in the Thunder Altar, free from distractions.</p><p>Regardless of the turmoil in the outside world, Qingyang Temple remained calm.</p><p>Yu Lang didn't burn a second bamboo slip, and Master Yun didn't come to disturb him.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, five more years passed.</p><p>Generations rose and fell.</p><p>From countless small, scattered countries, they merged into several powerful nations, vying for dominance.</p><p>A new era of chaos had arrived!</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>A slightly hoarse voice broke the stillness of the underground dwelling.</p><p>"Finally discovered, have they?"</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, his vision piercing through the earth and stone, looking towards the north. The piece he played had begun to move!</p><p>…</p><p>The Fire Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang's former cultivation ground.</p><p>After Qin Sang moved his cultivation ground, this place became a desolate lava lake, only inhabited by fire spirits.</p><p>Cultivators from the Falling Soul Abyss and Yun City occasionally passed by, rarely paying attention to what lay beneath.</p><p>Before this, both sides had searched countless times, confirming that the ruins were not here.</p><p>One day, a cultivator from Yun City made an unexpected new discovery.</p><p>This person's Daoist name was Yun Xi, one of the Nine Immortals of Yun City.</p><p>Yun Xi, leading several disciples, was on their way to another place when they passed this area.  Casually activating the Dragon Ring Golden Bell to scan the lava lake, they unexpectedly detected a faint reaction from beneath the surface.</p><p>The Dragon Ring Golden Bell was a magical artifact crafted by their sect, used to locate the ruins of the Panlong Ancient Array.</p><p>It resembled a bell, adorned with dragon-shaped carvings, hence its name.</p><p>“Ding-ling-ling…”</p><p>The Dragon Ring Golden Bell emitted an almost imperceptible sound.</p><p>Yun Xi gazed downwards, both surprised and delighted.  He never imagined that there was a hidden ruin here, undiscovered.</p><p>However…</p><p>Yun Xi hesitated, because the reaction from the Dragon Ring Golden Bell was too faint. If he hadn't been a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator personally activating the artifact, he would have surely overlooked it.</p><p>"Perhaps that's why it has remained hidden for so long,"</p><p>Yun Xi thought to himself. He called a disciple to quickly return and report the news, then personally led his people into the lava lake.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>The lava, like boiling water, swallowed them whole.</p><p>Yun Xi deliberately slowed his descent, carefully sensing his surroundings.</p><p>Apart from the somewhat chaotic flow of the underground fire veins, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>After descending for a while, logically they should be closer to the ruins, yet the bell's sound hadn't intensified.</p><p>Yun Xi remained calm and continued deeper, following the sound of the bell, finally arriving near the ruins.</p><p>Lava surrounded them on all sides.</p><p>Yun Xi clearly knew the ruins were hidden within the lava before him, but the bell's sound remained weak.</p><p>He found this strange and realized that these ruins must have something unusual about them.  He cautiously approached, tirelessly circling the edge of the ruins.</p><p>Gradually, he began to discern a pattern.</p><p>Every time a remnant of the Panlong Ancient Array was unearthed, Yun Xi would personally explore it.  Regardless of its unique characteristics, each site shared a common origin and discernible pattern.</p><p>He entered the ruins alone, without waiting for his fellow disciples, meticulously dismantling the restrictions.  Upon witnessing the interior, the cause became clear.</p><p>"What a mess!"</p><p>The site was severely damaged; within a few more years, it risked being swallowed by magma.  Initially believing it lacked significant value, Yun Xi felt a pang of disappointment. Then, he noticed something unusual.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He suddenly accelerated, darting towards the center of the ruins.  He stared in astonishment at the sight before him.</p><p>"Brother Yun Xi, have you found anything?"</p><p>A familiar voice called from behind.  The speaker, Yun Yuan, was also one of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du.</p><p>Yun Yuan, following the markings, found Yun Xi and the same breathtaking sight, his face etched with surprise. The ancient restriction here seemed familiar, yet far more intricate and mysterious than any they had encountered before.  Undoubtedly, this must have been a vital part of the Panlong Ancient Array!</p><p>After observing for a while, both secretly lamented the site's severe damage, despite the exquisite ancient restriction.</p><p>"Wait, no!"</p><p>Yun Xi exclaimed, pointing to a specific part of the restriction. "Here..."</p><p>"A section has broken away!"</p><p>Yun Yuan cried out simultaneously.  They both concluded that the damage wasn't ancient, but rather recent.  The detached section was likely extremely valuable.</p><p>However, the underground magma flowed in all directions.  The existence of the subterranean fire veins made the underground labyrinthine and made it impossible to determine where the fragment had fallen.</p><p>"I'll summon others!" Yun Yuan immediately prepared to leave and gather more people.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Yun Xi stopped him. "Go yourself, only tell Sister Yun Mi and the others.  Instruct them to come here secretly, avoid alarming anyone else!"</p><p>Summoning only the Nine Immortals of Yun Du would be slower, but ensured absolute trust.  The  Luo Hun Yuan must not know!</p><p>"Understood."</p><p>Yun Yuan departed immediately.</p><p>Soon, the Nine Immortals of Yun Du gathered at the ruins. After careful analysis, they split up to search.  They spread out systematically around the ruins, taking turns appearing elsewhere to avoid suspicion from the Luo Hun Yuan.</p><p>After months of searching, they finally found a possible trace.  Following the trail, they ventured further south, gradually entering desert territory. Here, the trace became increasingly clear.</p><p>Their anticipation mounted.  With a final push, they found their target. Before them was an underground stone forest: hundreds of stone pillars stood amidst the magma, forming a unique formation.</p><p>"Look! A hidden realm here."</p><p>"These carvings...they resemble the style of a sect that vanished ten thousand years ago, I think it was called Hong Yang Mansion."</p><p>"It seems the core fragment drifted here and is trapped within this hidden realm…"</p><p>The group quickly analyzed the situation and prepared to enter the realm. The Nine Immortals of Yun Du had explored every dangerous hidden realm in the Fire Domain.</p><p>However, as they navigated the stone forest, breaking through layer upon layer of restrictions, a roar echoed from the depths of the forest, shaking the entire structure.</p><p>"That aura… bad! Form the array!"</p><p>Yun Xi shouted, raising a long spear, aiming it upwards. The Nine Immortals also summoned their weapons—a diverse array of blades, spears, swords, and halberds—each emitting a similar energy signature.  The nine combined their power to form the Yun Bing Xuan Array, attempting to cover the entire stone forest, but it was too late!</p><p>A massive wave of magma crashed upon them, carrying tremendous force.  They recognized the energy signature instantly – the same as the Panlong Ancient Array's restrictions.  Clearly, the detached fragment had drifted here, crashing into the hidden realm, maintaining a precarious balance until their arrival shattered it, triggering an instant eruption.  They had not sensed any anomaly beforehand, otherwise they would have been more cautious.</p><p>Now, they had no time for such reflections.</p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p>The earth trembled, sandstorms raged. Sand dunes cracked, the ground ripped apart, and the subterranean magma, pent up for eons, erupted violently.  Hundreds of miles away, one could see magma surging high into the sky, staining the heavens crimson.</p><p>The Nine Immortals' greatest fear had come to pass.  As the magma erupted, a strange energy wave spread out.</p><p>In a hidden ruin, a direct disciple of a Ming Hu ancestor suddenly raised his head, disappearing in a flash.  Shortly after, he reappeared near the fissure.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Yan Xin Jade in his hand shone with a light even brighter than the earthfire!</p><p>…</p><p>"A Panlong Heavenly Pillar! There's actually a Panlong Heavenly Pillar here!"</p><p>At the bottom of the Luo Hun Yuan, the Black River surged, emitting a raspy, ecstatic voice.</p>
