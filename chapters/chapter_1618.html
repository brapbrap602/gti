<h1></h1><p>“Someone came out of the thunder!”</p><p>“Is that really a person? Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>……</p><p>Cries of astonishment erupted aboard the treasure ships.</p><p>Many on board had witnessed Su Zinan opening the Unfettered Palace. They knew firsthand that the thunder was far more terrifying than the Gray Tide back then.</p><p>A single bolt of lightning could obliterate them.</p><p>Fortunately, they were at sea. Had they been on land, the mountains beneath the lightning would have been riddled with holes and completely collapsed.</p><p>How could anyone survive such a barrage of thunder?</p><p>The sound of the wind and waves vanished, completely drowned out by the thunder. A hole of lightning seemed to have appeared in the sky, raining down an endless torrent of bolts, growing increasingly dense. Then, the sea of thunder began to expand outward.</p><p>“Hurry! Run!”</p><p>Someone shrieked.</p><p>The approaching thunder carried the aura of death.</p><p>Several treasure ships fled in panic, their protective formations at full power, weaving through the wind and waves in a desperate escape.</p><p>These weren't merchant ships crewed by mortals. They were all controlled by cultivators, and the quality of the treasure ships was decent, so none had yet capsized from the monstrous waves.</p><p>However, one ship was too close to the thunder, its speed no match for the expanding lightning. It was swallowed by countless bolts.</p><p>There were no screams.</p><p>Not even the sound of the ship’s protective barrier shattering could be heard.</p><p>By the time the others looked back, they saw only a blinding silver light. In the blink of an eye, the treasure ship had vanished.</p><p>No one on board escaped; all perished with the ship.</p><p>And that ship had a Golden Core cultivator at the helm!</p><p>Everyone was terrified.</p><p>Now, they felt no joy. Even if it was the Unfettered Palace emerging, it was too dangerous; even Nascent Soul cultivators would perish.</p><p>Preoccupied with escaping, no one paid attention to the sky.</p><p>The celestial changes were just beginning. Within the thunder, immensely powerful lightning energy converged, forming a silvery-white ring of lightning. Both inside and outside the ring, violent lightning crackled.</p><p>Beyond the ring were raging wind and waves, the boundless sea.</p><p>Within the ring lay a connection to another realm.</p><p>An aura of destruction pervaded this space. Lightning never ceased, the flashes too bright to discern anything within.</p><p>Occasionally, gaps appeared in the lightning. Only then could a glimpse of the realm’s depths be seen, fleeting and elusive.</p><p>Mountains rose and fell within, ancient palaces clustered like a forest.</p><p>One could imagine that it must have once been a scene of immortal splendor.</p><p>Now, the beauty was ravaged by lightning, transformed into an abyss of thunder. The surviving ancient immortal formations were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Besides the lightning, waves of Gray Tide swept across the realm, one after another.</p><p>In this hellish environment, there were actually people, and more than one!</p><p>Inside the ring of lightning, two figures hovered in the air, one on the left, one on the right.</p><p>These were the figures the people on the treasure ships had seen.</p><p>Surrounded by lightning, their true appearances were obscured, resembling two humanoid bolts of lightning. They were pushing against the lightning and Gray Tide, facing tremendous resistance.</p><p>Their goal was to break through the ring of lightning and escape this realm!</p><p>At that moment, amidst the earth-shattering thunder, chanting and a sharp shriek echoed. The sounds weren’t loud, but the thunder couldn’t drown them out.</p><p>The chanting came from the figure on the left.</p><p>As time passed, the chanting grew firmer, and the lightning surrounding the figure gradually gave way to a golden, radiant Buddha light.</p><p>The shriek emanated from the figure on the right. A cyan light burst forth from within the surrounding lightning, like a sharp cyan sword piercing through the electrical discharges.</p><p>The two figures exerted their power simultaneously. Buddha light and cyan light erupted, stabbing into the ring of lightning.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ring blazed brilliantly, then abruptly dimmed, cracking apart.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the two figures charged out of the ring, returning to the mortal realm. They transformed into two streaks of light, one gold, one cyan, instantly escaping the range of the thunder.</p><p>After their escape, the external lightning, instead of receding into the ring, intensified. The cracked ring showed no signs of reforming, its instability evident.</p><p>The ring shattered into several segments, the fragments drifting apart and expanding.</p><p>From the fissures, even more powerful and violent lightning energy dispersed outwards, bringing apocalyptic devastation to the entire sea region.</p><p>However, the most dramatic changes occurred within the ring.</p><p>As the ring tore apart, the inner realm seemed to lose some constraint, gradually merging with the mortal realm. This caused spatial tremors, leading to even more astonishing celestial phenomena.</p><p>The cultivators piloting the fleeing treasure ships felt a shift and turned to look, awestruck by the sight.</p><p>A magnificent immortal mansion faintly materialized in mid-air.</p><p>The mansion seemed suspended between heaven and earth, gradually ‘growing’ out of the void.</p><p>Mountains resembled slumbering true dragons, revealing only the tip of the iceberg as the ancient palaces and immortal mansion emerged.</p><p>“The Unfettered Palace!”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>No other place could possess such an aura.</p><p>The Dao and Buddhist sects, along with Su Zinan, had only seen fragments of the Unfettered Palace when they opened it. Now, they were witnessing the true form of this ancient immortal sect!</p><p>Protective formations within the Unfettered Palace flickered frequently.</p><p>Under the relentless assault of the violent lightning and Gray Tide, the formations extinguished one by one. Each extinguished light marked the destruction of an immortal palace.</p><p>The Unfettered Palace was already riddled with holes, practically ruins, teetering on the brink of annihilation.</p><p>Now, it suffered further devastation.  When all surviving palaces were destroyed, the mountains began to crumble, and ultimately, the entire immortal mansion!</p><p>Before everyone’s eyes, the immortal mansion, from its emergence to its destruction, lasted a mere dozen breaths.</p><p>The space, filled with lightning and Gray Tide, continued to grind the mansion's fragments until the entire structure was reduced to dust.</p><p>The two who had escaped watched the scene unfold behind them, silent for a long time.</p><p>One of them was an old monk with white eyebrows and a white beard.</p><p>The old monk's face was wrinkled, his attire a worn kasaya. He held Buddhist beads in his hand. Though his appearance was that of an elderly man, his eyes were remarkably bright and penetrating.</p><p>“Amitabha,” the old monk chanted, pressing his palms together as he witnessed the mansion's destruction.</p><p>Beside him was a captivating woman.</p><p>Her figure was alluring, her face breathtakingly beautiful. Her eyes shimmered like water, a single glance capable of intoxicating others. Every gesture exuded charm, effortless and natural.</p><p>She was clearly not human. Three fluffy fox tails swayed behind her, yet they didn’t seem out of place, adding to her unique allure.</p><p>“The Unfettered Palace is completely destroyed. What a pity about the treasures inside, including many of my clan's precious artifacts," the woman sighed, her voice mesmerizing.</p><p>Unfazed by her beauty, the old monk gazed at the familiar world and sighed, “I never expected to be trapped in the Unfettered Palace for three hundred years! No wonder that old devil Lu hesitated several times and gave up on entering the core of the immortal mansion when he found it. Thanks to your assistance and precious treasure, fellow Daoist, otherwise my tribulation within the Unfettered Palace would have been perilous indeed!”</p><p>“We were both in the same boat. I had to look out for myself.”</p><p>“This humble monk has truly burdened you, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>The old monk spoke sincerely.</p><p>The woman crossed her arms, her ample bosom accentuated, and said languidly, “It’s not entirely your fault, old monk. Who could have predicted the sudden appearance of the Heavenly Demonic Sound? It caught us off guard, leaving us both severely injured.  Otherwise, even if we couldn't break the core’s ancient prohibitions with our combined strength, we wouldn’t have been trapped in the Unfettered Palace for three hundred years…”</p><p>She surveyed her surroundings, her tone turning serious. “The Heavenly Demonic Sound hasn’t vanished. It truly wasn’t the Unfettered Palace’s power, it's a Heavenly Change!”</p><p>“Heavenly Demonic Sound!”</p><p>The old monk muttered the words, his usually placid expression rippling as he glanced towards the South Sea. “Back then, when the South Sea Immortal Palace ascended, fellow Daoist Dan Yu ventured too deep and couldn't retreat in time, being swept away with the palace. I considered myself fortunate for being astute and withdrawing quickly, never imagining the palace's ascension would trigger a Heavenly Change, turning us into trapped beasts... That time might have been the last chance for ascension.”</p><p>“Was it truly ascension?”</p><p>The woman was skeptical. “Who knows where that old bull-nose was taken, dead or alive! That old devil Lu was lucky, heading to the Return Ruins before the Heavenly Change. He probably found the Waypoint Gate and escaped this calamity.”</p><p>“Whether it's truly a Heavenly Change remains to be seen. It's merely our speculation and requires verification.”</p><p>The old monk spoke cautiously.</p><p>“What verification do we need? Just look at them, and we’ll know,” the woman said, pointing to the sea, selecting one of the treasure ships and beckoning it with a delicate gesture.</p><p>The treasure ship was struggling against the wind and waves, trying to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, the seawater below surged, forming a massive water column that lifted the entire ship into the air.</p><p>Finally, enveloped in a bubble of water, the ship drifted towards them.</p><p>Caught by surprise, the cultivators within the cabin were unsure what was happening. They rushed out to investigate, only to freeze, their eyes fixated.</p><p>Whether male or female, their eyes saw only the woman, not the old monk.</p><p>The woman’s fox tails swayed gently, the tips of the fur twitching as if teasing their hearts, leaving them captivated and restless.</p><p>“Late Golden Core,” the woman said, glancing at a scholar in white robes.</p><p>The scholar’s pride in his mental fortitude crumbled under that single glance. His face flushed, only one thought consuming him – she looked at me!</p><p>“He’s unaffected by the Heavenly Demonic Sound, so Nascent Soul cultivators most likely are as well. Only we Nascent Soul cultivators, capable of sensing the Heavenly Secrets, can ‘hear’ the Heavenly Demonic Sound!”</p><p>The woman was vexed. “It seems the Heavenly Change isn’t limited to the Middle State. It likely encompasses the entire realm! Even if it's not a Heavenly Change of this realm but orchestrated by someone, such terrifying divine ability is no different from the Heavenly Dao to us! If the Heavenly Demonic Sound persists, reaching the Return Ruins will be problematic, let alone ascension!”</p><p>Finally, she gritted her teeth, “Without achieving immortality, we are but ants!”</p><p>The old monk remained silent for a moment, then said, “There’s still a difference. If it’s not a Heavenly Change, one day, the Demonic Sound might cease its endless madness, allowing for communication and ceasing its constant assault on our minds. If it's a consequence of the Immortal Palace's ascension, further investigation of the South Sea Immortal Palace might reveal the cause.”</p><p>“I recall you saying the Unfettered Palace was the first to control the South Sea Immortal Palace in recorded history. Which sect came next?”</p><p>“After the Unfettered Palace’s devastating internal conflict between humans and demons, the South Sea Immortal Palace was briefly unclaimed until the Formless Immortal Sect rose to prominence in the Southern Border. We must start with the Formless Immortal Sect…” The old monk was well-versed in this history, recounting the sects that controlled the South Sea Immortal Palace over the years.</p><p>The woman scoffed, “Wasn’t the Formless Immortal Sect dismantled by you?”</p><p>Seemingly oblivious to her mockery, the old monk continued, “The Formless Immortal Sect's downfall began with the demonic disturbance, the release of brutal ancient demons from the Immortal Palace.  The demons originated from the palace, the palace’s ascension triggered the Heavenly Change, so the Heavenly Demonic Sound might be related to the ancient demons! The Formless Immortal Sect’s mountain gate vanished into the unknown. There should be records preserved within.”</p><p>“An ancient demon capable of triggering a Heavenly Change isn't something a mere Formless Immortal Sect could suppress!”</p><p>The woman was doubtful of the old monk's plan.  Remembering the scholar in white who had been left hanging, she asked, “Has any Immortal Palace descended in the South Sea over the past three hundred years?”</p><p>“Immortal Palace?”</p><p>The scholar was bewildered. He couldn't recall any significant events, but desperate to impress the goddess before him, he racked his brains.</p><p>The woman’s smile vanished, her expression turning cold as she struck at the treasure ship with a backhand.</p><p>With a boom, the water bubble burst.</p><p>An illusory handprint rapidly expanded in everyone’s vision.</p><p>Facing imminent death, the others snapped out of their trance, their faces filled with terror.</p><p>Screams filled the ship.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden light enveloped the treasure ship, blocking the handprint and lowering it back to the sea. A faint, soothing chant echoed in their ears, causing them to grow drowsy, collapsing to the deck, forgetting their recent ordeal.</p><p>The woman glanced at the old monk, her expression unchanged, not bothering to dwell on this minor matter.</p><p>The old monk flicked his sleeves, sending out several beams of light. “Though we wasted three hundred years, the time wasn't entirely fruitless. These treasures will be of great use in the future. How do you intend to handle them, fellow Daoist?”</p><p>The woman took two items without hesitation, her gaze falling on two of the remaining beams of light.</p><p>One was a square cauldron, the other a mottled, strange pill.</p><p>"Human artifacts. Keep them with you! However, you must obtain my consent before using them!"</p><p>The old monk agreed and retracted them into his sleeve.</p><p>Suddenly, his face turned a sickly yellow, his aura fluctuating wildly. He pressed his palms together, chanting a scripture before regaining his composure.</p><p>Once the old monk recovered, the woman asked, puzzled, "With the Heavenly Demonic Sound constantly assaulting our minds, you risked further injury. Aren't you afraid of damaging your foundation, worsening the situation?  According to our original plan, we could have escaped unharmed within five years. Having already been trapped in the Unfettered Palace for three hundred years, why the rush to force our way out?"</p><p>The old monk looked north, towards Golden Jade State, and said, "The Ullambana Festival is approaching."</p><p>“Ullambana Festival?”</p><p>The woman paused to recall this human festival, held every five hundred years.  She mused, “You think the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect will appear then? Heh, with Nascent Soul cultivators missing and us remaining hidden, the world is about to descend into chaos. It's indeed a golden opportunity for them, and they can conveniently help us locate the Formless Immortal Sect's mountain gate.  Quite the plan you have…”</p><p>“That is one reason.”</p><p>The old monk glanced back, seeing the storm subsiding, the Unfettered Palace completely erased from the world, leaving no trace.</p><p>He set off towards Golden Jade State.  “The journey east to the Return Ruins is fraught with peril. Before departing, this humble monk must eliminate the lurking malice.”</p><p>The woman looked at him incredulously. “Old monk, you can barely protect yourself, yet you’re still concerned about that broken-down Zen temple?  If we fail to ascend, we face death and the dissipation of our Dao.  With the Heavenly Demonic Sound blocking the cultivation path of this realm's cultivators, they might not even reach Nascent Soul anymore.  Even if the sect’s legacy lasts for ten thousand years, what meaning does it hold?”</p><p>“Amitabha! The legacy itself is the meaning.”</p><p>The old monk flew north, his steps firm.</p><p>“My sect forged me, and I shall forge my sect!”</p>
