<h1>Chapter 1261: Star River Records</h1><p>Four cultivators activated their magical treasures, simultaneously attacking the ancient barrier.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun's Yin Thunder Gourd spewed countless Yin thunders, which fused into a dark cloud, flashing with gloomy lightning, yet subtly exuding a yang energy. This treasure was refined using the most yin energy from the earth, then further refined with demonic arts, incorporating heavenly thunder and gradually transforming it into Yin thunder.  Besides his lifebound treasure, it was the artifact Tongyou Mojun invested the most effort into.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to use demonic fire as his primary attack. He brought out all eighteen demonic banners, prepared for unforeseen circumstances, but restrained his power, making it appear similar to his previous twelve-banner deployment. Even so, the demonic fire's power was still awe-inspiring. Tongyou Mojun couldn't help but glance at it several times.</p><p>Jingyu transformed into his beast form, preparing for battle.  His Thunder Beads hovered before him, as he unleashed bursts of essence, imbuing the beads. The beads glowed brightly, eventually culminating in a small shadow of a thunder hawk, which shot towards the ancient barrier like an arrow from a bow.</p><p>The three attacks arrived almost simultaneously. Qing Jun's Five Directions Pagoda was the fastest. The Pagoda, embodying the principle of "镇" (镇 – to suppress, pacify), was a treasure of suppression, capable of influencing the five directions and also suppressing others' attacks for defense.  This ability could be used on the ancient barrier.  Only palm-sized, emitting faint black light, it didn't appear to possess the imposing aura of a top-tier artifact.</p><p>Approaching the ancient barrier, the Pagoda suddenly paused, and a gigantic shadow of the pagoda materialized in the void, identical to the original.  The moment the shadow appeared, the surrounding blood mist ceased its flow.  The shockwaves from the clashing formations were also stopped.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The pagoda shadow struck the ancient barrier directly, suppressing its fluctuations. At the same time, Qin Sang's and the others' attacks followed closely, piercing through the pagoda shadow.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demonic fire, Yin thunder, and beast shadow merged perfectly, striking the barrier's weakest point.  Already riddled with cracks, this was the barrier's most vulnerable spot.  The combined assault caused the cracks to rapidly spread, leading to a sudden shattering of the ancient barrier, sending fragments flying.</p><p>The barrier's shattering created a terrifying hurricane. However, the Five Directions Pagoda had weakened its power, and when it reached Qin Sang and the others, they managed to withstand it with their artifacts.  Meanwhile, the barrier emitted a brilliant light, attempting to repair itself.  While they could break the barrier due to its pre-existing damage, their strength wasn't enough to harm its core, allowing it to self-repair.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda trembled repeatedly, its shadow stubbornly suppressing the barrier and slowing its recovery.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun, with the Yin Thunder Gourd above his head, led the charge, using Yin thunder to pave the way. Qin Sang and Jingyu followed, with Qing Jun bringing up the rear after putting away his Five Directions Pagoda.</p><p>As they attacked the ancient barrier, those in the blood pool sensed it...</p><p>Above the blood pool, Ye Laomo, the Blood Demon incarnation, and Tianzheng Laoren were focused on breaking the seal. Tianzheng Laoren, worried about the battle, occasionally glanced towards the entrance of the blood pool. Seeing the flag gate formation remaining firm, firmly blocking the enemy, he felt relieved.</p><p>The three figures used the same secret technique, rapidly sending runes into the blood pool; some merged into the blood, others drifted towards the black chains. Under their continuous spellcasting, the blood pool's seal was on the verge of breaking.  The blood pool's water could no longer remain calm; large waves rose, pulling at the black chains, causing a loud splashing sound.</p><p>At that moment, Tianzheng Laoren sensed the ancient barrier's fluctuations, his expression changed drastically. Immediately guessing the cause, he yelled "No good!" and dashed towards the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>Ye Laomo and the Blood Demon incarnation remained oblivious to the outside world, ignoring Tianzheng Laoren's actions, and increased their spellcasting speed, racing against time to break the seal!</p><p>Tianzheng Laoren's face was grim.  His opponent seemed to know the blood lake as well as they did, quickly finding the Black Tower array's core and tracking them down, and also knew precisely where the ancient barrier was weakest. They had obtained this information through soul searching the ancient demons.  Where did their opponent learn this?</p><p>Tianzheng Laoren pondered this, when he saw a crack appear in the ancient barrier ahead, emitting the familiar aura of Yin thunder.</p><p>"Tongyou Old Demon!"</p><p>Tian Zheng Old Man coldly snorted. He had clashed with Tongyou several times and instantly recognized the newcomer.  He wasn't sure how many followers Tongyou had.</p><p>Tian Zheng knew he couldn't let him enter and disrupt Ye Old Demon's work on the seal.  With a sweep of his sleeve, a meteor streaked across the blood mist.</p><p>A scroll was wrapped within the starlight.</p><p>The scroll slowly unfurled, revealing a boundless expanse of deep space.  Then, stars appeared one by one, coalescing into a starry sea—a star chart.</p><p>It seemed a simple picture, but the depicted cosmos felt real, the stars shifting constantly.</p><p>When the star chart fully opened, it vanished without a trace.  The omnipresent blood mist disappeared with it.</p><p>The space transformed into the starry sea depicted on the chart, sealed by the artifact.</p><p>Tongyou, having just passed through the ancient barrier, found himself in chaos, unlike what Jingyu had described. Then, a colossal star, trailing a long cometary tail, hurtled toward him with terrifying speed!</p><p>Facing the star, Tongyou felt insignificant, like an ant.  He seemed destined to be pulverized.</p><p>Undeterred, Tongyou coldly said, "The Star Chart! Tian Zheng Old Ghost, so it's you!"</p><p>He then summoned his Yin Thunder Gourd. Countless thunderbolts erupted, charging towards the star.</p><p>The formidable star, pierced by the Yin Thunder, shattered like a bubble pricked by a needle, vanishing instantly.</p><p>Tongyou was unharmed.  He heard Tian Zheng's voice, laced with threat, "Tongyou Old Demon, you managed to track us here. I underestimated you! But do you know what's sealed beneath? Ignorant fool, beware of your demise!"</p><p>Tongyou sneered, shouting, "Just some ancient cultivator suppressed here!  Suffering torture and endless solitude, even if he hasn't become a demon, he must be mad by now! You recklessly opened the Blood Pool seal, releasing this demon. Did you consider the countless lives in Beichen Territory?"</p><p>Tian Zheng was shaken.</p><p>Tongyou knew this place incredibly well, the Blood Pool seal, and the ancient cultivator.</p><p>Tian Zheng's mind raced.  Unlike the approach used in the Abyss where they found the Blood Lake after searching the demons' souls, Xiao Han territory knew about the Blood Lake long ago.  Had he been here before?</p>
