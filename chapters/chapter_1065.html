<h1>Chapter 1057: Jade Palaces and Cloud Mansions</h1><p>Ning Wu Hui walked intermittently, occasionally changing direction, as if searching for something.</p><p>After crossing several mountain ranges, his gaze swept across the landscape and landed on a distant peak. After observing it for a moment, a joyful expression appeared on his face.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>Qin Sang was a little surprised. They hadn't reached the Spirit Subduing Region yet.</p><p>He looked closely. The mountain was tall, its peak touching the Celestial Barrier and shrouded in rosy clouds. However, among the mountains surrounding倚天峰 (the name of the peak is omitted as it's unimportant to the story), similar peaks were not uncommon, and nothing seemed particularly special about this one.</p><p>Before long, the two arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The space within the secluded valley was more stable than elsewhere, but it wasn't devoid of spatial rifts. This mountain happened to have one such rift, stretching across its mid-slope.</p><p>They were already accustomed to such sights. After confirming that there were no other dangers on the mountain, they concealed their figures and flew upwards.</p><p>A man-made stone path was clearly visible, winding its way through the forest and valleys towards the summit.</p><p>Along the stone path, there were dried-up stream beds, dilapidated pavilions, and collapsed ancient halls. However, these were all commonplace, with no remaining restrictions and no traces of a hidden realm.</p><p>This kind of mountain had undoubtedly been explored by cultivators long ago.  Having determined it held no value, it was gradually abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Ning Wu Hui, stopping only when they reached the summit.</p><p>Now, they were practically standing beneath the Celestial Barrier, with shimmering rosy clouds all around.</p><p>Experiencing the power of the Celestial Barrier up close was chilling.</p><p>There was a cluster of ancient halls on the summit, which must have been magnificent and exquisite in the past. But when the ancient cultivators departed and the restrictions vanished, the halls couldn't endure.</p><p>Scourged by time, the halls were covered in dust, with scenes of collapse and ruin everywhere.</p><p>The main gate was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The two walked through the empty doorway, extremely cautious, leaving no trace.</p><p>Passing through several chambers, they entered a spacious plaza.</p><p>The plaza was circular, surrounded by broken stone pillars. Some were reduced to their bases, while the intact pillars had long since lost their luster, returning to their mundane state.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui walked to the center of the plaza, looked up, and gazed at the Celestial Barrier above.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, quietly watching Ning Wu Hui's actions. A strange glint flashed in his eyes as he vaguely guessed where the path Ning Wu Hui mentioned was located.</p><p>The rosy clouds were dazzling, but Ning Wu Hui's eyes were like stars, his gaze piercing through the clouds to see the essence of the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>After searching for a while, Ning Wu Hui suddenly took a step forward, then shaped his hand like a blade and slashed upwards.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>True Essence transformed into a crescent-shaped blade aura, disappearing into the depths of the rosy clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened at this sight. He secretly channeled his True Essence, worried about triggering a backlash from the Celestial Barrier. Even if they could escape safely, the resulting phenomenon would be impossible to conceal.</p><p>If it attracted a Nascent Soul ancestor, they would be in trouble.</p><p>However, what he feared didn't happen.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui continued to strike with his palm, sending streaks of True Essence into the Celestial Barrier. His footsteps shifted continuously, following a specific pattern. The rosy clouds became turbulent, but not significantly so.  Despite being repeatedly attacked, the Celestial Barrier didn't retaliate.</p><p>Suddenly, a heart-palpitating fluctuation emanated from within the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Fortunately, the fluctuation appeared and disappeared quickly, like ripples on water, dissipating not far from its origin.</p><p>“Go! Remember, don't leak the slightest fluctuation of True Essence or divine sense!”</p><p>Ning Wu Hui shouted in a low voice and soared into the air.</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, casting aside all his worries. He flashed into the plaza, closely following Ning Wu Hui, and charged straight into the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>He watched helplessly as he was gradually engulfed by the rosy clouds of the Celestial Barrier, his vision fading to nothing. He didn't dare to use his divine sense to probe.</p><p>He instantly prepared all his protective measures.</p><p>As he ascended, Qin Sang suddenly felt his whole body tighten. A powerful wind descended upon him.  He stabilized himself and charged upwards against the gale.</p><p>The good news was that, apart from the wind, there was no backlash from the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>Only the wind grew increasingly fierce.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly felt his body lighten.  He was pulled by Ning Wu Hui, and his feet landed on solid ground.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang quickly opened his eyes and witnessed a breathtaking scene.</p><p>He didn't know whether he was above the Celestial Barrier or within it.</p><p>The rosy clouds were still present, but they were no longer monotonous.</p><p>He was surrounded by a boundless sea of clouds, interwoven with the rosy light, creating a fantastical spectacle of flowing colors.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened in disbelief. He couldn't imagine such a world existing within the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>He quickly looked down and saw a long white jade corridor extending from the depths of the sea of clouds, abruptly ending beneath his feet.</p><p>Even more astonishingly, there was a breach in the Celestial Barrier beneath the corridor. He didn't know if it was a deliberately created exit or damage caused by some external force.</p><p>This breach could only be discovered from above.</p><p>Each of Ning Wu Hui's palm strikes had precisely hit the location of the breach, finally opening a small gap for them to enter.</p><p>“Are we really above the Celestial Barrier? No, there's a barrier around us too!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>He discovered that rosy clouds and interwoven runes, radiating a dangerous aura, surrounded the white jade corridor.</p><p>They were amidst the clouds and rosy light, with nothing but the white jade corridor beneath their feet. Everything else seemed illusory.</p><p>In the direction the white jade corridor extended, there were shadows of jade palaces and cloud mansions, resembling celestial dwellings.</p><p>To the north, west, and east…</p><p>In every direction, there were clusters of celestial palaces and mountains. The mountains seemed adorned with vibrant flowers, creating an incredibly beautiful scene.</p><p>The clouds and rosy light weren't static. As they shifted, the palaces and mountains appeared and disappeared, sometimes fragmented, sometimes whole.</p><p>He couldn't tell if they were illusions created by some restriction or if the palaces were real, their appearance merely distorted by the Celestial Barrier.</p><p>Below the Celestial Barrier, including the inner halls, everything was desolate. The void itself was shattered, riddled with spatial rifts.</p><p>Some areas were clearly once extraordinary, belonging to powerful figures. Yet, they couldn't escape the ravages of time, falling into complete ruin, with barely a single intact hall remaining.</p><p>But within the Celestial Barrier, the celestial palaces were perfectly preserved, their former glory intact.</p><p>This was likely the celestial court envisioned by mortals.</p><p>Only the presence of immortals was missing.  Without inhabitants, the celestial palaces were silent and lifeless.</p><p>Stunned by these sights, Qin Sang turned his head to look in the final direction.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze fixed on something.</p><p>There were no celestial palaces in that direction, only emptiness.  A section of a black tower flickered in and out of view. Its top was unseen, its height unknown.</p><p>“The Heavenly Tower!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled. He recognized this tower shadow as the upper half of the Heavenly Tower!</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang understood a lot. Thoughts raced through his mind. When everyone saw him fall from the top of the tower, it wasn't in the outer halls but above the Celestial Barrier!</p>
