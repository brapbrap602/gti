<h1>Chapter 1307: The Cloud Platform</h1><p>The grand hall was deathly silent.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi sighed inwardly and quietly instructed his trusted aides to monitor the movements of the Two Realms Alliance. These old fellows were unruly and would not fully obey his commands.</p><p>"Where are the trusted followers of the Demon Lord Ye being held now?"</p><p>An elderly man suddenly spoke up, turning his gaze toward the cultivator surnamed Qi.</p><p>Just as the cultivator surnamed Qi was about to respond, a middle-aged man beside the elderly man sneered, "The Demon Lord Ye has clearly gone mad. Do you really think you can use these people to threaten him? His trusted followers and disciples are nothing more than tools to divert attention. The Demon Lord Ye would never reveal any secrets to them."</p><p>"Now that I think about it, I’ve never heard of the Demon Lord Ye having any blood relatives still alive. However, his disciples were quite talented. What a pity."</p><p>Someone remarked indifferently.</p><p>Given how many forces the Demon Lord Ye had offended, it was easy to imagine the fate of his disciples. Unable to find the Demon Lord Ye, they could only vent their anger on them.</p><p>These old fellows were not lacking in methods of torture. Death would be a mercy.</p><p>Even among the Nascent Soul cultivators, there were loyalists to the Demon Lord Ye, such as Jiang Chenzi. However, without them having to lift a finger, the Demon Lord Ye had already killed them all, imprisoning their Nascent Souls. This showed just how ruthless and sinister the Demon Lord Ye was.</p><p>The other demonic elders had only submitted to the Demon Lord Ye out of fear of his overwhelming strength, not out of loyalty.</p><p>"I’ll go take a look."</p><p>The elderly man snorted coldly and stood up, walking out of the hall.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi silently mourned for those people.</p><p>At that moment, a ripple of energy suddenly came from outside the hall.</p><p>"The True Lord has returned!"</p><p>Everyone stood up abruptly.</p><p>In the next moment, True Lord Canghong pushed the door open and entered. The elderly man quickly stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Seeing that True Lord Canghong had returned alone, a sense of foreboding rose in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>"I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you all. My strength was insufficient, and I failed to stop the Demon Lord Ye. He escaped into the Palace of Sinful Gods. Fairy Qiuzhi is currently setting up a formation to seal the exit of the Immortal Sect."</p><p>True Lord Canghong glanced around the room, his tone slightly heavy. "Additionally, I’ve just received some news…"</p><p>An hour later, everyone filed out of the hall, each wearing a grave expression and moving with urgency.</p><p>…</p><p>At the camp of the Two Realms Alliance.</p><p>The group was engaged in a lively discussion, debating methods to break the formation.</p><p>Suddenly, a junior Golden Core cultivator entered to report and presented a jade slip.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi took the jade slip and, after reading it, showed a hint of surprise. He chuckled and said, "This is a letter from True Lord Canghong. The Sinful Abyss wants to negotiate."</p><p>"Negotiate or surrender?"</p><p>Everyone was astonished.</p><p>They had long anticipated this day. Even if they drove the enemy out of the Sinful Abyss, it would be difficult to completely annihilate them, especially since they still had top-tier experts on their side.</p><p>They just hadn’t expected it to happen so soon.</p><p>"Negotiate!"</p><p>Elder Zhenyi emphasized, "The specific terms will be discussed face-to-face tomorrow morning. What do you all think?"</p><p>As he spoke, Elder Zhenyi passed the jade slip around for everyone to read.</p><p>"It’s not surprising that they want to negotiate. The Withered Origin Pill is a complete scam. Continuing the fight would bring no benefit to the Sinful Abyss."</p><p>"However, if we don’t push them to the brink, they won’t easily submit. Negotiating now will make it difficult to extract the best terms."</p><p>"There’s no harm in meeting them first. Let’s see what they can offer. If the talks fall through, we can always resume fighting!"</p><p>"I wonder if the Demon Lord Ye is alive or dead. Their eagerness to negotiate suggests there’s been some new development. They must have discovered something. We need to get to the bottom of this."</p><p>"Exactly! We must uncover all the details about the Demon Lord Ye!"</p><p>"True Lord Canghong mentioned in his letter that he’s willing to discuss matters related to the Demon Lord Ye with us. It seems he wants to use this as a bargaining chip."</p><p>…</p><p>The group continued to debate, and the topic quickly shifted to the Demon Lord Ye.</p><p>Clearly, like the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Sinful Abyss, their interest in the Demon Lord Ye far outweighed everything else. To them, annexing the Sinful Abyss was merely about seizing territory, far less important than the secrets the Demon Lord Ye held.</p><p>True Lord Canghong had seized upon this very point!</p><p>Lord Tongyou lightly tapped the table with his finger and said in a deep voice, "This war has caused heavy losses to both realms. The people yearn for stability, and it’s time to recuperate. However, as my fellow Daoists have rightly pointed out, we can’t let them off so easily. The Sinful Abyss must compensate for the losses they’ve inflicted on our two realms! Moreover, with the current reversal of fortunes, if they wish to negotiate, they’ll have to hand over certain things. Additionally, the offensive plan we’ve just finalized will proceed as scheduled!"</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>Negotiations were fine, but the Sinful Abyss should not think they could use talks to buy time!</p><p>At that moment, Qu Huan suddenly spoke up, "I don’t care about the rest, but tell them they must deliver a Yellow Nether Vine!"</p><p>"A Yellow Nether Vine? Isn’t that one of the most precious spiritual herbs of the Starry Constancy Sect? It’s said that only one mature Yellow Nether Vine appears every thousand years, and it’s never allowed to leave the sect!"</p><p>Elder Ji exclaimed in surprise, immediately recognizing the origin of the Yellow Nether Vine.</p><p>Qu Huan chuckled, "Elder Ji is indeed well-informed! That’s right. If the Yellow Nether Vine weren’t so rare, I would have obtained it long ago."</p><p>Elder Zhenyi nodded slightly, "Brother Qu’s contributions are evident to all. Since Brother Qu has made this request, we will do our utmost to secure it for him. Fellow Daoists, if you have any demands, feel free to bring them up now so we can negotiate with clear objectives."</p><p>The initial list of participants for the negotiations was set: Elder Zhenyi, Elder Ji, Lord Tongyou, Lord Qing, and Qin Sang, along with Qu Huan, who was most familiar with the Sinful Abyss.</p><p>"Hmm? Is Brother Leng still outside?"</p><p>Elder Zhenyi turned to Qin Sang and asked in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "Don’t worry, Elder. I’ll send a message to Brother Leng explaining the situation. If he hasn’t returned by tomorrow morning, we won’t wait for him."</p><p>After breaking the defensive formation of Yu City, Lord Qing had approached Qin Sang, saying she had an urgent matter to attend to and needed to leave immediately. She had not returned since.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled but didn’t press for details, temporarily taking on his senior sister’s responsibilities.</p><p>Fortunately, the Sinful Abyss had holed up in the city and dared not launch any attacks, so no unexpected developments had occurred.</p><p>…</p><p>Throughout the night, the area outside the city was ablaze with light as the Two Realms Alliance methodically prepared for battle, undeterred by the upcoming negotiations.</p><p>At dawn the next day.</p><p>A glimmer of morning light appeared in the east, intertwining with the golden barrier.</p><p>Lord Qing had still not returned.</p><p>The battle erupted, and the sounds of killing shook the heavens.</p><p>Few noticed as five figures quietly soared into the sky.</p><p>White clouds gathered high above, forming a broad cloud platform. As they stepped onto the platform, several figures appeared on the other side, with True Lord Canghong at the center.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized a familiar face—Fairy Qiuzhi.</p><p>Their eyes met, and they nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>Though they had fought fiercely, there was no deep enmity between them. In fact, they held a certain respect for each other’s abilities.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you dare to leave the city? Aren’t you afraid we’ll strike here?"</p><p>Elder Zhenyi flicked his horsetail whisk, his eyes narrowing as he spoke in a cold tone.</p><p>"Feel free to try."</p><p>True Lord Canghong seemed unperturbed. His gaze swept over the five of them, and when he noticed Lord Qing’s absence, his expression remained calm as he stepped onto the cloud platform.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye Butterfly and noticed that these people were enveloped in a faint golden armor, seemingly of the same origin as the golden barrier conjured by the formation.</p>
