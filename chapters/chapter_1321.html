<h1>Chapter 1313: Arrangements</h1><p>Chapter 1313: Arrangements</p><p>“The Heavenly Corpse Sect didn't exist for long.  It's said to have suddenly declined, the reasons lost to time. I, due to my cultivation of corpse refinement techniques, investigated the sect and learned a few things. The Heavenly Corpse Sect turned cultivators into living corpses—a cruelty unparalleled even among the demonic path, terrifying all who heard of it.  Their extermination by a coalition of forces isn’t surprising.”</p><p>The Judge, eager to reclaim the Death Jade, was forthcoming.</p><p>Qin Sang, recalling the Corpse King found in the Immortal Tomb, guessed at the reason for the Heavenly Corpse Sect's swift downfall.</p><p>The sect's master, years ago, entered the Purple Micro Palace and died there under mysterious circumstances. The Corpse King, likely one of his creations, was trapped in the Immortal Tomb until Bai discovered it.</p><p>Beyond the sect master, no one knew about the mysterious person in the water prison, or if they did, they couldn't contact them.</p><p>Thus, the Heavenly Corpse Sect, leaderless, faced internal strife and external threats.</p><p>In the cultivation world, sects like the Heavenly Corpse Sect, fleeting and short-lived, are countless.  Those that endure usually possess heirloom treasures that protect them.</p><p>For example, the Nascent Soul puppet of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.</p><p>“In recent years, have you heard anything about the Heavenly Corpse Sect, or any related individuals?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>The Judge pondered for a long time before shaking his head. “No.  If you wish to find the Heavenly Corpse Sect's descendants, I'll dispatch someone to search.  Cultivators of the corpse path are unique; if they need corpses, traces will certainly be found.”</p><p>The Judge volunteered.</p><p>This was precisely Qin Sang's aim.  “Excellent!  I'll trouble you.  I need anything related to the Heavenly Corpse Sect, whether descendants or techniques. Remember, keep it quiet; we don't want to alert anyone. Perhaps they will contact you instead.”</p><p>The mysterious figure behind the Heavenly Corpse Sect, imprisoned in the water prison, still managed to stir up the sect, suggesting a restless spirit.</p><p>The premature appearance of the Purple Micro Palace, Ye Laomo's conspiracy, the mysterious figure behind the Heavenly Corpse Sect…</p><p>The cultivation world seems calm, but undercurrents surge.</p><p>If this person wishes to rebuild the Heavenly Corpse Sect, the quickest way is to subdue other corpse path demonic cultivators.</p><p>The Judge detected the implication in Qin Sang's words, startled, his guard heightened.</p><p>“The Three Realms War is over; you haven't had a chance to fight.  Keep the Death Jade with you for now.  Don't worry, I won't touch it.  I'll return it once you've gathered the materials or found the person I need.”</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hand, placing a restrictive enchantment on the Death Jade in front of the Judge before storing it in his spatial ring.</p><p>The Judge watched helplessly, sighing inwardly before bowing and taking his leave.</p><p>Once the Judge was gone, Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, watching the direction of the Judge's departure, saying,  “He wasn't hiding anything. That mysterious person has been sealed for years, likely recovering from injuries.  We can only wait for them to emerge… Take me to the Heavenly Corpse Sect's main hall.”</p><p>Soon, the two entered the water prison.</p><p>Bai examined the seals in the water prison and also visited the Heavenly Corpse Sect's main hall, finding nothing.</p><p>Then they returned to the original branch hall.  All signs indicated that Tan Hao had not returned after leaving.</p><p>Unable to find any useful information, Qin Sang informed his senior sister and left the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>Although the Three Realms had reached a peace agreement, Qin Sang had killed and injured several Nascent Soul cultivators. Many likely resented him, so he avoided making visits.</p><p>Southern foot of the Sky Walk Plateau.</p><p>First tier, Wan Ye Mountain.</p><p>Wan Ye Mountain stood tall, its peak perpetually capped with snow. Below the snowline, lush vegetation thrived.</p><p>The mountain was rich in spiritual energy.  A sect once resided there but was annihilated by the Abyss of Sin, which then occupied it.</p><p>Now ownerless, Qin Sang had claimed Wan Ye Mountain as a temporary base for the Green Sheep Sect.</p><p>He didn't intend to establish the sect here, only setting up basic protective formations.</p><p>The location is near the grasslands, where most of the resources Qin Sang received are located.  Wan Ye Mountain would serve as a transit point and resting place for disciples.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Two streaks of light, one green, one red, flew towards them: Li Yu Fu and Mei Gu.</p><p>Approaching Wan Ye Mountain and scanning the area, Li Yu Fu said, “It seems we're early.  Tan and the others haven't arrived yet.”</p><p>Mei Gu nodded. “Let's wait at the foot of the mountain. We’ll pay our respects to Master once everyone’s here.”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu landed on a large rock at the mountain base, gazing at the magnificent scenery.</p><p>They had recently received a message from Qin Sang, summoning them to Wan Ye Mountain for a meeting.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, full of ambition, envisioned a bright future. He turned his head, gazing at Wan Ye Mountain, increasingly captivated.  He mused that although the mountain was somewhat small, its spiritual energy was rich, making it a worthy location for their sect. He wondered about his senior's intentions.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing sound tore through the air. In a blink, four figures landed before them: Pang Ji, Bai Mao, Shangguan Li Feng, Tan Yi En, and Bai Han Qiu.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng had been fighting alongside Li Yu Fu for some time, forging a strong bond between them. Li Yu Fu knew of Shangguan Li Feng's long-standing acquaintance with Qin Sang and treated him with respect.</p><p>After greeting Shangguan Li Feng, Li Yu Fu turned to Pang Ji and Bai Mao. "Fellow Daoists, when will Senior Liu Shu and Senior Ling Hou arrive?"</p><p>"They can't make it," Pang Ji replied, a flicker of worry in his eyes. "My mother entered seclusion a few days ago, aiming for a breakthrough.  The two seniors need to stay behind in Qian Shan Zhu Hai to prevent any disturbances."</p><p>Li Yu Fu noticed Pang Ji's distress and offered comfort. "Daoist Chi Lei, rest assured. Senior Jing Yu is blessed by Heaven; she will surely succeed in her breakthrough!"</p><p>Jing Yu's heavenly tribulation was imminent.  Failure in this breakthrough would mean death, a secret known only to Qin Sang and Pang Ji. Pang Ji suppressed his anxiety, nodding slightly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai Han Qiu, having achieved Foundation Establishment, followed behind Tan Yi En. Tan Yi En, already at the False Core realm, approached Mei Gu and whispered a few words.</p><p>Mei Gu's face fell; sadness clouded her features.</p><p>With everyone assembled, they ascended the mountain on foot, passing through a dense forest to reach a cave at the summit.  The scene was breathtakingly beautiful, a pristine expanse of white.</p><p>A large ice door, emanating a chilling aura, stood within the cave. It opened automatically, revealing Qin Sang inside.  They all approached and paid their respects.</p><p>Upon learning of Jing Yu's seclusion, Qin Sang could offer little help beyond mentioning the corpse flower amber, which should greatly increase her chances of success.</p><p>"Where is Zhao Shan Ran?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Mei Gu responded sorrowfully, "Master, disciple Zhao failed his Golden Core breakthrough and passed away in his cultivation chamber some time ago."</p><p>Even the煞妖丹 (Sha Yao Dan - Demon Slayer Pill, note:  This is kept in its original language because a direct translation would lose cultural nuance and understanding of the context within the cultivation system.) could not guarantee a successful Golden Core formation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded impassively, accustomed to life and death. "I had planned to entrust Zhao Shan Ran with the sect's daily affairs, but alas, he couldn't overcome this hurdle. Until a suitable replacement is found, the rest of you will share the responsibilities of running Qing Yang Guan."</p>
