<h1>Chapter 870: The Scheme</h1><p>It was too early to dwell on these matters. Qin Sang didn't know the refining method and couldn't create more Beast King Banners, so he stored the nine he had in the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>“So many treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened the black-robed cultivator's storage pouch.  His divine sense swept over the contents, and he was stunned.</p><p>There were four high-grade spirit stones alone, along with several rare refining materials and spirit herbs.</p><p>This cultivator was wealthier than any peak Core Formation cultivator Qin Sang had killed before.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, this cultivator had been tasked with infiltrating Sky Fortune City and recruiting rogue human cultivators. Naturally, he carried many treasures, and this was only what remained after some had already been used.</p><p>What an unexpected windfall!</p><p>He had been expecting a difficult search for high-grade spirit stones, but now he had four, plus the one given by the Fang youth.  More than enough to refine the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>He had no time to examine his loot now. He transferred everything to the Qianjun Ring, intending to sort through it later.</p><p>The successive battles had taken a toll on him. Qin Sang consumed a few medicinal pills, held a spirit stone, and entered meditative practice, focusing on recovering his true essence.</p><p>Once his true essence recovered to six or seven-tenths, he stopped cultivating, stood up, and looked into the distance.</p><p>The downpour showed no signs of stopping; the dark clouds grew thicker.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder roared, creating a chaotic scene in the night.</p><p>He couldn't see the battlefield clearly from here. After a moment of thought, he deactivated the surrounding restrictions, concealed himself within the storm, and stealthily moved closer.</p><p>Soon, a golden light appeared in the distant sky.</p><p>The sound of roars, mixed with the wind, rain, and thunder, faintly reached his ears.</p><p>“The Beast King Banners!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. “The fight is still going on!”</p><p>He suppressed his aura, preparing to get closer and assess the situation.</p><p>However, before he could approach, the golden light suddenly vanished, and the roars abruptly ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>He frowned. The battle had ended so quickly that his disruption of the Beast King Banner formation seemed to have had little effect.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, Black Serpent Mountain had won.  It appeared the mysterious cultivators hadn't been able to put up much of a fight, trapped and killed by the Beast King Banner formation.</p><p>This wasn't surprising. The mysterious cultivators couldn't have unleashed such powerful lightning techniques without a cost; they might have been exhausted.</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples, lying in wait, were fresh and ready.</p><p>With one side weakened and the other at full strength, the outcome was predictable.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat frustrated that his plan hadn't succeeded.  He couldn't exploit the chaos.  It seemed he would have to swallow this resentment for now and seek revenge later.</p><p>His gaze shifted towards the small island. There was no movement; the Kui Dragon was likely slain.</p><p>A few moments later, several streaks of light flew to the island, revealing the Fang youth and the others. They were carrying captives, having not only defeated their opponents but also captured a few alive.</p><p>They weren't unscathed, though. Most were pale, their robes torn, and their faces etched with anger.</p><p>An uninjured Black Serpent Mountain disciple searched the island, collecting the belongings of Chu Heng and the others.  Then, they dismembered the Kui Dragon, taking anything of value.</p><p>The Fang youth's eyes darted around, seemingly on guard. After searching without finding anything, he waited for his fellow disciples to finish and barked, “Withdraw!”</p><p>“Hmph! That brat got off easy, causing us so much trouble!”</p><p>“We’ll kill him sooner or later, to avenge Fourth Senior Brother and Junior Brother!”</p><p>“Tear him to pieces!”</p><p>…</p><p>The group cursed and swore vengeance as they flew away from the island.</p><p>Then, the Fang youth waved his hand, releasing several talismans.  Everyone vanished instantly, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The downpour continued. The small island was a mess, but the traces of battle and blood were gradually washed away, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>…</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples were nowhere to be found.</p><p>The Fang youth and his companions were extremely cautious, leaving no trace. Qin Sang couldn't find them, unable to track them. After lingering for a while, he silently retreated, forced to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang stared into the rainy night, his expression flickering. He was unwilling to let it go and wouldn't give up easily, but he needed to carefully consider his next move.</p><p>He still didn't know the identities of the mysterious cultivators. If he could determine their origins, he might glean Black Serpent Mountain's objectives and find opportunities to disrupt their plots.</p><p>As far as he knew, the nearby sea was barren, with almost no islands possessing spirit veins.  No sect had established themselves here.</p><p>Rogue cultivators wouldn't establish caves here either.</p><p>The mysterious group was stronger than some mid-sized sects, possessing a guardian spirit beast like the Kui Dragon, yet they were hiding in this place. It was puzzling.</p><p>It might take some time to ascertain their identities.</p><p>Or he could simply leak the news of Black Serpent Mountain cultivators infiltrating and massacring human cultivators, using the major human factions to hunt them down without lifting a finger.</p><p>He couldn't let them off easy.</p><p>However, with the attention of both human and demonic cultivators, as well as various other forces, currently focused on the Demonic Sea, the effectiveness of this approach was uncertain.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang remembered something else. His expression changed, and he abandoned the matters here, summoning his flying sword and heading straight for Sky Fortune City.</p><p>His avatar was still in the cave in Sky Fortune City!</p><p>He had killed two direct disciples of Black Serpent Mountain. They wouldn't let it go, and his identity, including the location of his cave, was easy to trace.</p><p>If his avatar was exposed and discovered by Black Serpent Mountain, there would be trouble.</p><p>Apart from the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of anyone else, but his avatar was still weak and couldn't withstand much. Any Black Serpent Mountain disciple could easily capture or kill it.</p><p>He didn't have time to refine another avatar.</p><p>Compared to revenge, his avatar was much more important, connected to the ancient teleportation formation. He couldn't allow anything to happen to it, not even a sliver of a chance.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Black Serpent Mountain had spies in Sky Fortune City; otherwise, they couldn't have recruited so many human rogue cultivators so easily.</p><p>The shopkeeper was highly suspicious.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang didn't dare linger. He had to relocate his avatar to a safe place before Black Serpent Mountain could act, so he could plan his next move without worry.</p><p>Even if it meant missing the opportunity for revenge, he couldn't take that risk.</p><p>Qin Sang raced against time, almost without stopping.</p><p>When his true essence was depleted, he summoned the Two-Headed Vulture.</p><p>Traveling day and night, he returned to the waters near Sky Fortune City in less than two months.</p><p>Donning his cloak and assuming the identity of Daoist Qing Feng, Qin Sang swaggered into the city. He wasn't worried; even if the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch came personally, he wouldn't dare kill anyone within Sky Fortune City.</p><p>Upon entering the city, Qin Sang didn't rush to the cave on Bao Gu Mountain.  He went straight to the marketplace. He soon arrived near the shop, only to find it closed in broad daylight.</p><p>The shopkeeper had vanished!</p><p>“This person was indeed suspicious!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and quietly withdrew.</p>
