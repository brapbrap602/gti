<h1>Chapter 532: Forced Entry</h1><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang overheard Wu Youdao's words and realized that if he didn't seize the opportunity to leave the Azure Yang Sect, he might never be able to.</p><p>After giving instructions to everyone, Wu Youdao flew alone towards the inner sect.</p><p>Qin Sang waited until Wu Youdao's figure disappeared before emerging from the shadows and quietly approaching the mountain gate.  A peaceful resolution was no longer possible; he had to force his way out.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared for a major confrontation with Wu Youdao. With his current strength, he could put up a fight. However, he couldn't fight within the Azure Yang Sect; otherwise, he had no chance of winning.  He planned to make his move when Wu Youdao entered Divine罡 Peak to deal with the Ancestral Holy Fire, when he would be preoccupied and escape would be more likely.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering how and when to act, he suddenly saw a flying ship approaching from outside the Azure Yang Sect. It was the same pod-shaped ship from before, but its speed was even greater than when it left!</p><p>"So fast?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the others to return so quickly.  Wu Youdao definitely hadn't entered Divine罡 Peak yet, but he knew he couldn't wait any longer and immediately made his decision.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, activating his movement technique and concealing his aura as much as possible, racing towards the mountain gate.</p><p>At the stone monument, six people stood, startled by the approaching flying ship. They watched as it drew closer.  As soon as their fellow disciples returned, they would follow Wu Youdao's orders and reactivate the grand formation, sealing off the sect.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The flying ship sped through the sky, the roar growing louder, like thunder.</p><p>Suddenly, the elder with the highest cultivation among the six sensed something. He turned abruptly, scanning the area below the stone platform.</p><p>The area below the platform was a steep cliff face, devoid of vegetation.</p><p>Further down the mountainside, the slope became gentler. Although there were green pines and cypresses, the area remained clearly visible.</p><p>Everything seemed normal.</p><p>The others noticed the elder's unusual behavior and followed his gaze, but found nothing. Seeing the furrow in his brow, they asked in surprise, "Senior Brother, what are you looking at...?"</p><p>The elder scanned the area again, shaking his head doubtfully. "Perhaps it was my imagination.  For some reason, just now..."</p><p>Before he could finish, his eyes suddenly flashed.  He threw a punch towards the edge of the stone platform, shouting, "Come out!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The punch reached the edge of the platform, where it was stopped by an invisible barrier and silently shattered.</p><p>"What is that!"</p><p>The others finally saw it then: a monstrous, fanged figure, like a demon, had appeared in front of the dissipated punch, startling them.</p><p>The monster had approached so close without them noticing.</p><p>Moreover, the monster had come from *inside* the sect!</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised. With his concealment skills, he shouldn't have been discovered so quickly.</p><p>Then, he noticed a strange connection between the elder who had seen through his disguise and the stone monument.</p><p>In a flash of insight, Qin Sang understood. It wasn't that his concealment technique was poor, but that the elder was likely the one controlling the formation and had used the stone monument to detect him.</p><p>This minor setback wouldn't shake Qin Sang's resolve.</p><p>Now exposed, Qin Sang didn't say a word.  He kicked off the stone platform, his figure flashing like lightning as he charged towards the mountain gate.</p><p>"Stop him!" the elder roared, reacting swiftly.</p><p>The others hurriedly summoned their magical artifacts.</p><p>Of the five artifacts, three were identical bronze awls.  These awls were wreathed in Azure Yang Demonic Fire, the two seeming to be perfectly integrated.</p><p>But they were too slow.  Qin Sang reached them in an instant. With a thought, his Ebony Sword shot out even faster, erupting with terrifying sword energy.</p><p>"A Magical Treasure?"  The group was shocked.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Ebony Sword sliced through a flying sword and left a deep gash on one of the bronze awls, nearly destroying both artifacts.</p><p>Their faces paled at this fierce display.  Unwilling to confront the Ebony Sword directly, they scattered.</p><p>Their morale broken, Qin Sang achieved his goal.  Escape was paramount, so he retrieved his sword and dashed outwards.</p><p>Just as he was about to pass the stone monument, it suddenly glowed brightly.</p><p>A dazzling beam of light shot skyward, the disturbance noticeable for miles around.  Qin Sang's vision blurred, and a thin light barrier appeared before him.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  He glanced back to see the elder behind the stone monument, forming strange hand seals and staring at him with a grim expression.</p><p>"Who are you? What is your purpose in infiltrating my sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, ignoring the elder. Gripping the Ebony Sword, he struck the light barrier with all his might.</p><p>He couldn't possibly break through a complete formation.</p><p>However, it was currently being hastily maintained by the elder alone and hadn't fully activated.  Its power was significantly diminished.  Furthermore, Qin Sang was breaking *out*, and the monument was primarily designed to stop intruders from entering.</p><p>Suddenly, a long howl echoed from the inner sect. Qin Sang knew without looking that Wu Youdao had been alerted.</p><p>'Crack…'</p><p>The light barrier cracked under the Ebony Sword's assault.</p><p>After a few more strikes, it began to crumble.</p><p>Just then, a stream of flames, fast as lightning, shot out from the inner sect, crossing the outer mountains in the blink of an eye. Wu Youdao's furious roar, filled with killing intent, echoed.</p><p>"Who dares trespass in my Azure Yang Sect!"</p><p>Though he didn't turn around, Qin Sang could clearly sense Wu Youdao's rapidly approaching aura, the powerful pressure like needles on his back.</p><p>His heart pounding, Qin Sang pushed his Corpse Pill to its limit, his sword flashing even faster.</p><p>Finally, the light barrier shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang burst through, relieved.  Without hesitation, he soared into the air on his sword, preparing to flee.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a powerful gust of wind from behind.</p><p>The wind carried a sharp edge, even more so than his Ebony Sword.</p><p>"Get back here!" Wu Youdao roared.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare underestimate the attack. He dodged at the last moment, a streak of Azure Yang Demonic Fire barely missing him.</p><p>Within the demonic fire was another bronze awl.</p><p>However, Wu Youdao's awl was a low-grade Magical Treasure. Golden lines spiraled around its surface, creating a bizarre vortex that seemed to draw one's spirit in as it spun, moving with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang spared it a glance and continued to flee!</p><p>He was out of the Azure Yang Sect now and didn't need to worry about his escape route being cut off.  But he still needed to retrieve the treasures he'd left outside before he could properly confront Wu Youdao and find a chance to escape for good.</p>
