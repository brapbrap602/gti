<h1>Chapter 1258: The Dual Nine Palaces Formation</h1><p>A deafening roar erupted!</p><p>The thunderous light spat out by Jingyu transformed into a tempest of lightning, with electric serpents wildly dancing, threatening to tear apart the blood mist. At the same time, the dark thunder of the Nether Demon Lord exploded in unison.</p><p>Chongyi Daoist's expression remained calm as he activated a secret treasure, swiftly unleashing a strange radiance. Qin Sang and the others also displayed their unique abilities, lending their assistance.</p><p>Their target was the black pagoda at the center!</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p>Jingyu's words were true—the black pagoda withstood their bombardment as if it were a real entity, showing no signs of being an illusion.</p><p>The thunderous energy erupted, churning the blood mist into chaos, accompanied by a deafening roar.</p><p>The tremors spread far and wide, shaking the entire formation.</p><p>At this moment, within the core of the black pagoda formation.</p><p>The cultivators of the Sin Abyss had already dispelled the illusions, found the passage, and entered the real world hidden beneath the illusions.</p><p>This was a vast, eerie, and terrifying space, filled with an extremely dense blood mist.</p><p>Standing here, one could clearly see the four towering black pagodas at the corners.</p><p>These four black pagodas were real. Between them, a barrier formed by a restriction isolated this space from the outside world.</p><p>Like the black pagoda formation, the restriction was inevitably damaged, but due to its location at the core of the formation, it was well-protected, with only minor damage.</p><p>This space was devoid of other structures, extremely empty, with only a square blood pool comparable to a lake. The blood pool was filled with blood, and the blood lake manifested outside was made of this very blood.</p><p>The stench of blood was overwhelming, containing a deadly blood poison. A single breath would cause a splitting headache and a dazed consciousness.</p><p>At the edge of the blood pool, numerous black chains were scattered.</p><p>These black chains, made of an unknown material, emitted a gem-like luster, covered in various strange runes—some broken, others intact.</p><p>Each chain was as thick as a human head, interlocked and incredibly heavy.</p><p>One end of the chains was fixed at the edge of the blood pool, while the other end extended into the pool, sinking deep into the blood, connecting to something unknown below.</p><p>At this moment, above the blood pool, Old Demon Ye sat cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>On either side of Old Demon Ye were two figures—one was Tianzheng Elder, and the other was Old Demon Ye's Blood Demon avatar, who had somehow returned to join them.</p><p>The group, centered around them, all looked down at the blood pool below, continuously attacking the seal with their magical treasures.</p><p>The blood pool remained calm and undisturbed.</p><p>However, the black chains constantly emitted runes, blocking all incoming attacks.</p><p>As they continued their relentless assault, the light emitted by the runes began to fragment.</p><p>Just then, Tianzheng Elder's expression suddenly changed. He flipped his hand and produced an ancient mirror.</p><p>Before he could activate the mirror, a violent tremor shook the area.</p><p>Tianzheng Elder channeled his true essence into the mirror. He had left a contingency outside, and sure enough, he saw a group of figures attacking the illusion of the black pagoda.</p><p>But before he could get a clear look, a cold snort echoed from the mirror, and the image shattered.</p><p>"Not good! They've caught up to us!"</p><p>The group was shocked.</p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p>"How could they decipher the black pagoda formation's patterns so quickly and find the core of the formation?"</p><p>...</p><p>They were all baffled. They had previously used tactics to split their enemies into two groups, buying time, thinking they were foolproof. Yet, an unexpected turn of events had occurred.</p><p>The enemy had arrived ahead of schedule and seen through the illusions.</p><p>This was completely unforeseen!</p><p>Tianzheng Elder's expression shifted uncertainly. He glanced at Old Demon Ye, who was intently focused on the blood pool, attacking the seal without paying any attention to the commotion outside.</p><p>He then looked at Old Demon Ye's Blood Demon avatar.</p><p>The Blood Demon avatar sneered, "Don't look at me. I personally led them astray. Unless they have a grandmaster of formations among them, who knows how they found this place?"</p><p>"Even Leng Yuntian of the Yuan Shen Sect doesn't have such abilities!"</p><p>Tianzheng Elder declared firmly, utterly perplexed, unable to figure out where they had slipped up.</p><p>But the facts were before them, leaving no room for further thought. They had to respond and block the incoming enemies.</p><p>He glanced at the blood pool, then surveyed the surroundings, making arrangements. "The seal is about to be broken. No matter what, we can't let them in. Earlier, Fellow Daoist Ye and I used a secret technique obtained from a soul-searching demon to carefully investigate. The person sealed beneath the blood pool should no longer be able to cause trouble and is of no concern. Fellow Daoist Ye and I are enough to handle this. Please assist Fellow Daoist Jiang Chenzi in setting up the Banner Formation at the entrance to block the enemy!"</p><p>With that, Tianzheng Elder looked at Jiang Chenzi and the other two holding the banners.</p><p>The banners were the formation's core.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the others exchanged glances, then activated the banners and left.</p><p>Outside the illusion.</p><p>Under the continuous bombardment of the Nether Demon Lord and the others, the black pagoda in the illusion was severely damaged, violently shaking before finally collapsing.</p><p>As the black pagoda collapsed, its fragments suddenly vanished, leaving behind a dark, gaping hole.</p><p>Jingyu transmitted a message, saying this was the entrance. The group was overjoyed and was about to investigate when they saw three small banners slowly rise from within, followed by a burst of blood light.</p><p>At the same time, a loud shout echoed, "Get back!"</p><p>"Banner Formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted.</p><p>The Sin Abyss cultivators were indeed here. Their breaking of the illusion had alerted them, and they had set up the Banner Formation to wait in ambush.</p><p>To enter, they would first have to break the Banner Formation.</p><p>In the next moment, the Banner Formation surrounded them, disappearing in a flash, only to be replaced by an endless sea of blood light that enveloped them.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The group, experienced as they were, immediately attacked together as soon as the Banner Formation appeared, targeting one of the banners.</p><p>The banner transformed into a gate, fluttering noisily. As the group attacked, figures emerged from behind the gate, led by Jiang Chenzi.</p><p>"Break!"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi roared, pointing a finger at them.</p><p>The gate surged, and waves of blood light rushed forth like a mighty river, carrying immense force that scattered their spells and caused their magical treasures to flicker and fall apart.</p><p>The group was shocked and quickly recalled their treasures. Then, the blood light ahead intensified, and the gate, along with Jiang Chenzi and the others, vanished into thin air.</p><p>"This is the true power of the Banner Formation. Thankfully, I acted quickly, or else the Snake King and I might have been trapped!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, his heart racing.</p><p>Previously, only Jiang Chenzi and the other two had controlled the formation, and they hadn't had time to set up the complete Banner Formation before he used the Blood Filth Divine Light to taint one of the banners, breaking the formation.</p><p>Now, with the Sin Abyss Nascent Soul cultivators joining forces to set up the formation, its power was incomparable.</p><p>The Blood Filth Divine Light had already been used, and the Sin Abyss wouldn't give him another chance to attack the banners.</p><p>For a moment, they were all trapped by the blood light, unable to locate the three banner gates. The Banner Formation grew increasingly fierce, with endless blood light transforming into towering waves, creating a terrifying and suffocating scene.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Nether, quickly form the Dual Nine Palaces Formation!"</p><p>Qingjun shouted.</p><p>The Nether Demon Lord nodded, flipping his hand to produce several slender jade talismans.</p><p>These talismans were as thin as paper, each engraved with a vivid celestial palace diagram.</p><p>This Dual Nine Palaces Formation was a set of formation tools specially crafted by the Two Realms Alliance for the Blood Lake expedition, requiring immense effort and resources.</p>
