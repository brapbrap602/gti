<h1>Chapter 1124:  A Shared Practice</h1><p>Chapter 1124:  A Shared Practice</p><p>Qin Sang knew.</p><p>Over the years, Yun Youzi had chosen many people.</p><p>Among them were certainly talented individuals from both the human and demon races, each more gifted than he, each with a greater chance of achieving more.</p><p>Yet, he entrusted Jiao Mu to Qin Sang.</p><p>This was not just trust, but also Yun Youzi's recognition of Qin Sang, and his boundless expectations.</p><p>“Rebirth through a spirit, Senior, can you truly return?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s grip tightened on his palm.</p><p>After hearing Yun Youzi’s words in the jade slip, Qin Sang had answered without hesitation.</p><p>If there was a chance to save Yun Youzi, who else could do it but him!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a heavy weight on his shoulders.</p><p>On the path to immortality, he carried a burden called responsibility.</p><p>“Master Uncle.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu, seeing Qin Sang standing there speechless, couldn’t help but call out.</p><p>“Yu Fu, from now on, it’s just you and me,”</p><p>Qin Sang pulled himself from his thoughts, patted Li Yu Fu’s shoulder, and sighed softly.</p><p>He silently put away the Jiao Mu and the Du E Dan. He had no heart to examine any treasures right now.</p><p>“Let’s go back,”</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, towards the direction of Da Sui, and said in a low voice, “The person is gone, there's no need for sorrow. We, the younger generation, must strive forward, and not disappoint our predecessors.”</p><p>Although Yun Youzi had left a contingency plan, both Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu understood that hope was slim.</p><p>Li Yu Fu vowed, “This disciple will surely carry on the legacy of Qing Yang Temple.”</p><p>They erased their tracks and returned to the cave.</p><p>Inside the cave, Tan Yi En and Bai Han Qiu both knew that Yun Youzi was about to undergo his tribulation.</p><p>If he succeeded, there would be another Yuan Ying ancestor to protect them.</p><p>Except for their slightly weaker foundation compared to the top sects, they were no different from disciples of the larger sects. The senior and junior siblings had lost their minds for cultivation, sitting in the hall, anxiously awaiting the outcome.</p><p>The outer mountain formation was activated, and spiritual light flickered.</p><p>“They’re back!”</p><p>Tan Yi En’s face lit up.</p><p>The two rushed out of the cave to greet them, but only Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu returned.</p><p>Seeing their expressions, the siblings sensed something was amiss.</p><p>“Grand Master…”</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, “Senior’s tribulation failed. Keep this in your hearts, don't spread it.”</p><p>The two stood there dumbfounded, unable to believe it.</p><p>Tan Yi En murmured, “The Yuan Ying tribulation is so terrifying…”</p><p>Qin Sang and Li Yu Fu went to the mountain’s forbidden area.</p><p>There was an altar there, with three spirit tablets on it.</p><p>Jixin Dao Ren, Mingyue, and Li Yu Fu’s disciple, Jing Tian.</p><p>Jing Tian was a mortal. Even though Li Yu Fu never forgot his disciple, frequently providing him with spirit pills and tending to his health, it was ultimately futile.</p><p>However, Jing Tian had many disciples, revitalizing the secular lineage of Qing Yang Temple.  The Qing Yang Temple on Cui Ming Mountain was now a thriving Taoist temple.</p><p>Li Yu Fu meticulously placed Yun Youzi’s spirit tablet at the top and kowtowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the spirit tablets, at the familiar names one by one.</p><p>Back then, when he returned from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he had seen Yun Youzi's spirit tablet at Qing Yang Temple and joked about it with Li Yu Fu.  Now it had become reality.</p><p>“The soul-birthing sword spirit…is it possible for Senior to be reborn through that trace of primordial true spirit, borrowing the sword spirit’s body?”</p><p>Qin Sang secretly communicated with Bai.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang had already told Bai everything and sought his opinion.</p><p>Without a doubt, if Jiao Mu were to be integrated into a treasure, the Ebony Sword was the best choice. He still had half a piece of Soul-Nurturing Wood; upgrading the Ebony Sword to a top-grade treasure wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>This sword, being Qin Sang's life-bound treasure, would be easier to control during the integration process, preventing damage to Yun Youzi's primordial true spirit.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had been searching for a way to upgrade a treasure to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Now he knew the method.</p><p>But he would rather not!</p><p>Bai remained silent for a long time, then suddenly asked, “If I say there’s no hope, would you give up?”</p><p>Qin Sang silently shook his head.</p><p>He knew he wouldn't give up.</p><p>After a pause, Bai continued, “The immortal path pursued in cultivation is also ethereal and elusive. Among the countless beings, countless cultivators, who can be certain of achieving immortality? In this vast world, there are wonders beyond imagination. In the world of cultivation, anything is possible!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood this reason all too well.</p><p>Where is the immortal path?</p><p>Is there still a possibility for Ya Gu to awaken?</p><p>Can Yun Youzi be reborn?</p><p>Or are these just beautiful hopes?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what the outcome would be.  He could only remain unwavering, steadily moving forward step by step.</p><p>Bai thought for a moment and reminded him.</p><p>"I didn't expect his origin to be Qing Fu Zheng Zhu."</p><p>"If it were an ordinary wood spirit, even if you captured a living one and refined it into a treasure, it wouldn't be easy to upgrade it to a spiritual treasure."</p><p>This celestial treasure, born from the essence of heaven and earth, is unlike ordinary plants.  Even after perishing in a heavenly tribulation, it retains its primal spirit.</p><p>Cultivating sentience in such treasures is incredibly difficult, and they have many natural enemies. Out of millions, very few ever achieve spiritual awareness.</p><p>Integrating this piece of scorched wood into your artifact will almost certainly imbue it with spiritual essence. Whether it will develop a weapon spirit is uncertain; it depends on your cultivation and luck.</p><p>However, be extremely careful if you don't want to harm that fragile primal spirit. Don't treat it like you did the Soul-Nurturing Wood; ideally, wait until you form your Nascent Soul.</p><p>Fully integrating the scorched wood into your Ebony Sword and merging it with the primal spirit will take a long time.</p><p>During this process, it’s best not to use the Ebony Sword in combat…</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Thank you for your advice. I understand.”</p><p>Protecting Yun Youzi’s primal spirit is paramount; sacrificing some fighting ability is acceptable.</p><p>He has other artifacts, so he’s not worried.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang’s *Yuan Shen Sword Cultivation Chapter* will no longer inscribe new killing talismans. His cultivation will focus on the seven sword souls.  He won't be able to use his soul-linked sword, but his cultivation won't be affected.</p><p>After the ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed for a while.</p><p>“Before I form my Nascent Soul, don't worry about establishing your sect. Focus on cultivation. In the immortal world, cultivation is paramount!”</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang warned the three disciples.</p><p>He looked at Li Yu Fu, concerned about his mindset. “Yu Fu, you are exceptionally talented, a true disciple of your Grand Master. You should strive for greater heights in the immortal path. While reviving Qingyang Temple is your Grand Master’s wish, it’s a minor matter compared to your own cultivation. Don't let it become an obsession that traps you, it's not what your Grand Master would want…”</p><p>Li Yu Fu was silent for a moment before bowing. “Disciple will heed your teachings.”</p><p>Whether Li Yu Fu truly understood remains to be seen. This is a karmic obstacle; only he can overcome it.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He glanced at the cave, as if Yun Youzi were still inside cultivating.</p><p>Recent events felt like a dream.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and flew back to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Mist swirled.</p><p>The spirit array activated.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to enter the valley when Bai suddenly emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag, looking at Qin Sang and asking, “Fancy a sparring match?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused.</p><p>“Very well!”</p><p>A flash of light.</p><p>The two flew towards the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p>
