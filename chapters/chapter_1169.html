<h1>Chapter 1161: The Soul-Carving Pill</h1><p>Approaching the Magma Gate, a wave of intense heat washed over me.  </p><p>The location, carefully chosen by Daoist Jiupao, was too fiery for other sects, but perfectly suited for Magma Gate disciples practicing the Seven Suns Scripture.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the foot of the mountain, gazing up at the Magma Gate's protective formation.</p><p>The scene on the volcanic mountain hadn't changed much since Qin Sang's last visit.</p><p>Crimson leaf trees covered the mountainside, their branches interwoven with buildings and pavilions. The protective formation, a swirling mass of red smoke, drifted slowly in the air.</p><p>Under the scorching sun, the scene shimmered with vibrant light.</p><p>After a careful observation, Qin Sang confirmed the formation remained unaltered.</p><p>This formation, a legacy from Ancestor Kuiyin and meticulously arranged by Daoist Jiupao, was amplified by the geothermal heat, growing stronger with time. Its countless variations made it incredibly complex, beyond the capabilities of the Magma Gate disciples to modify.</p><p>Carrying his token, Qin Sang was intimately familiar with all the formation's intricacies.  With his current cultivation, infiltration would be effortless and undetectable.</p><p>He arrived at a grove of crimson leaf trees, his form blurring before disappearing into the woods.  The red smoke above stirred only slightly before settling back into stillness.</p><p>Several low-level disciples were cultivating within the grove.</p><p>Later, a patrol of disciples passed by, equally oblivious to his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang moved silently through the woods, every word and action of the disciples falling within his perceptive range.</p><p>In a medicinal garden, two disciples were using magical tools to create rain clouds, watering the spirit herbs.</p><p>"Senior Brother, I heard that Master Zhao just returned from the Yinquan Gate, and he doesn't look too good. You went to the Headmaster's Hall earlier, did you see Master Zhao? Did you hear anything?"</p><p>The younger, a pretty girl, whispered to the young man beside her.</p><p>The young man glanced at her.  "You girls are always gossiping!"</p><p>"It's not gossip!"</p><p>The girl pouted, unconvinced. "All sects affiliated with the Qingyang Sect take turns defending the front lines. Everyone knows it's our turn next. Among the nearby sects, Yinquan Gate is the strongest, relaying orders from the Qingyang Demon Sect.  We have no choice but to obey. Master Zhao's trip to Yinquan Gate must be about this.  His grim expression means the task is likely dangerous. We're just worried about the sect, what's wrong with that?"</p><p>The young man shook his head, a wry smile playing on his lips. "You're still so quick-witted!  With our level of cultivation, what difference does knowing the reason make? We should focus on cultivating the spirit herbs and contributing to the sect."</p><p>Despite his words, deep worry clouded his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely through the spirit fields.</p><p>Along the way, he overheard several similar conversations.  Most disciples showed concern for their sect and lacked excessive aggression.</p><p>It was unexpected; the Qingyang Demon Sect's influence had stretched so far, even integrating the nearby demonic sects.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect was an oddity in the demonic world, shunned by the righteous sects due to its cultivation methods and location, forcing its affiliation with the demonic path, yet its conduct remained relatively upright.</p><p>This didn't mean the Qingyang Demon Sect was benevolent.</p><p>The cultivation world was fundamentally a survival of the fittest; even righteous sects engaged in power struggles, but at least some lines were drawn.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want the Qingyang Temple to become entangled with the demonic path. If the Magma Gate was filled with cruel and bloodthirsty individuals, he wouldn't consider incorporating it into the Qingyang Temple, lest it corrupt its foundation.</p><p>It seemed that Mistress Mei was managing the sect well.</p><p>This was also influenced by the surrounding environment. With the Qingyang Demon Sect's control, the area avoided becoming a purely predatory world, unlike other demonic territories.</p><p>Learning from the disciples that Mistress Mei was currently on the mountain, Qin Sang quickened his pace, heading towards the summit.</p><p>The Headmaster's Hall.</p><p>A woman in court attire was talking to an elderly man; both wore expressions of anger.</p><p>The woman was Mistress Mei, a Core Formation cultivator whose appearance hadn't changed much since Qin Sang's last meeting; she appeared frail.</p><p>Yet, this seemingly delicate figure had shouldered the burden of the sect, leading it through war and surviving in the cracks.</p><p>Not only had the Magma Gate not fallen, but it had also steadily grown in influence.  Even more remarkable was that her own cultivation hadn't suffered.</p><p>The elderly man was Zhao Shanran, one of the four Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Magma Gate.</p><p>His cultivation was lower than Mistress Mei's, only at the Pseudo-Core Formation stage.</p><p>The once ambitious youth was now an old man, his hair silvered by time.</p><p>"Brother Lu really appeared at Yinquan Gate?"</p><p>Mistress Mei's brow furrowed, seemingly grappling with a difficult problem.</p><p>"Senior Sister, you once helped Elder Qi, he wouldn't lie to us about this."</p><p>Elder Qi unexpectedly discovered Lu's trail.  The chatter among Yinquan sect members suggests collusion with their leader.</p><p>Zhao Shanran shuddered at the memory. "If Elder Qi hadn't warned me, and I'd taken the other path, Lu would have killed me! It's unjust that such a despicable man like Lu could even achieve Golden Core!"</p><p>Aunt Mei sighed, "Years ago, we each received one of four Zanpo Pills.  Lu's talent was the best among us; it's not surprising he reached Golden Core."</p><p>"He had two Zanpo Pills, not one!"</p><p>Zhao Shanran, closest to the late Red Leaf Daoist, gritted his teeth, frustrated at his inability to avenge him.</p><p>Aunt Mei shook her head. "The battlefield is inherently dangerous; there was no definitive proof of Red Leaf's death at the time…"</p><p>"Lu murdered Red Leaf!  You're too kind, Sister. You should have listened to me and killed him then!  I suspect Yinquan's involvement in Lu's escape. This time, Yinquan likely forged an imperial edict, intending to wipe us out and then seize Moyan sect under Lu's name." Zhao Shanran exclaimed indignantly.</p><p>"Brother, don't rush.  Lu's fate is secondary.  The priority is dealing with Yinquan."</p><p>Aunt Mei remained calm, advising Zhao Shanran.  Glancing at the door, she continued, "Yinquan's demand for a Golden Core cultivator is standard, I'll go myself. But their demand for additional personnel is excessive.  We've already lost many disciples. If they take more, Moyan sect will be completely empty."</p><p>After a pause, Aunt Mei said gravely, "Their main goal is to get me away. We can negotiate the other terms.  I'll manage at the front lines; don't worry about my safety. Yinquan can't do whatever they want.  But you, Brother, stay behind and be vigilant…Remember what we used to do?"</p><p>Aunt Mei's eyes burned.</p><p>"One word!  Endurance!"</p><p>Zhao Shanran let out a long breath. "I'm incompetent for failing to achieve Golden Core, unable to assist you, Sister! Don't worry, after you leave, I'll seal the mountain.  Thank goodness you didn't give the grand array talisman and diagrams to Lu. I'll see how much he can do to break through the grand array personally laid out by the sect master!"</p>
