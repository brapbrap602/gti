<h1>Chapter 901: Breaking the Formation</h1><p>Chapter 901: Breaking the Formation</p><p>That night, during the encirclement and annihilation of the Kuilong, the mysterious figure desperately tried to save it, unleashing powerful lightning magic from afar.  The intense lightning almost drove them to their doom.</p><p>Qin Sang first escaped the lightning, but then, due to his exposed identity, he was ambushed and attacked by cultivators from Black Snake Mountain.  Events unfolded rapidly, forcing him to flee and making contact with the mysterious figure impossible. He never saw their faces.</p><p>He wondered if those cultivators who used the lightning magic were the disciples of Douniu Peak expelled from Lan Dou Sect.  Otherwise, why were they so secretive and unknown?</p><p>Back then, the mysterious cultivators were tricked by a young man surnamed Fang into revealing their lightning magic, then trapped and killed by the Black Snake Mountain's Beast King Banner.  Their fate wasn't good; they were likely completely annihilated, or perhaps even captured.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced, connecting all the events of this period.  However, these were only guesses. Only by seeing those people’s faces could he confirm his suspicions.</p><p>If it truly was Black Snake Mountain, what was their goal?</p><p>Qin Sang felt uneasy, recalling the pool discovered by the Sky Eye Butterfly tracking the insect.</p><p>He was also worried about the Sky Eye Butterfly's situation, so he concealed himself and silently infiltrated the Dark Thunderwood forest.</p><p>As Qin Sang arrived, the flag formation set up by Zhao Songqiao continued to erode the Dongming Island formation.</p><p>Within the black, strange smoke, the figure of an insect flickered, rushing into the white mist, attempting to open a passage.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside Dongming Island.</p><p>On the other side of the entrance, the sea appeared calm, only slight ripples disturbing the surface.</p><p>Any cultivator with sufficient cultivation approaching this area would sense that the scene wasn't real, but a disguise created by some illusion.</p><p>Within the illusion, several oddly dressed cultivators were present.</p><p>A mirror floated above their heads; the illusion was created by this magical item. However, these people clearly weren’t focused on the disguise, resulting in a rather crude illusion—sufficient to conceal their presence and avoid being discovered.</p><p>They controlled black flags, forming a flag formation identical to Zhao Songqiao's, but with significantly greater power, launching a full-scale attack on the Dongming Island formation.</p><p>These black flag formations seemed to be interconnected, cooperating internally and externally with incredible efficiency and extraordinary power.</p><p>Within the black smoke, shadowy monstrous beasts seemed to emerge, baring their fangs, relentlessly attacking the white mist.</p><p>The surrounding space was tainted by the black smoke, countless strands flowing, transforming into the sharpest weapons, piercing the mist and shattering the densely packed runes in the formation.</p><p>“Faster!”</p><p>The person in black robes, their second senior brother, urged anxiously.</p><p>The others remained silent, not daring to slacken.</p><p>The eldest brother, with only two blood pythons, faced numerous Nascent Soul cultivators alone.  Nobody knew how long he could hold out. If Lu Zu escaped, all their plans would fail.</p><p>‘Hiss… hiss…’</p><p>The black smoke grew denser, its power increasing, changing shape constantly, manifesting as swords, spears, and halberds, relentlessly assaulting the white mist.</p><p>Finally, the white mist thinned, runes shattered, and the passage was about to open.</p><p>Within the formation, Zhao Songqiao looked up at this scene, his hands clasped tightly, his expression complex.  He seemed hesitant and worried, his inner struggle evident on his face.</p><p>In the end, he chose to stay.</p><p>Having come this far, there was no turning back.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A muffled sound startled Zhao Songqiao, causing him to look up sharply.</p><p>The white mist was finally pierced by the black smoke, followed by several figures emerging one after another, landing before him with swift movements.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was shocked; the terrifying aura emanating from these people filled him with fear.</p><p>At this moment, he finally saw the familiar figure, hope dawning in his eyes.  He didn't dare look at anyone else, quickly walking to the person and kneeling, saying, “Junior pays his respects to Elder Xue and the other elders.”</p><p>This person was the shopkeeper surnamed Xue from Tianxing City.</p><p>He looked towards the person in black robes.  The latter surveyed his surroundings and nodded, saying, “This is indeed the Dark Thunderwood; the Thunder Cave lies beneath. You, junior, have done well.”</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue smiled slightly, saying, “Rise. It seems you’ve truly done your best. Take these; wait outside. Cultivate diligently; Xue has a close bond with your ancestor, and I wouldn’t want his line to end.”</p><p>With that, Shopkeeper Xue tossed a jade bottle containing several pills to the black-robed man.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao’s eyes shone brightly, his face filled with excitement, his hand trembling as he grasped the bottle tightly.</p><p>“Go to the Thunder Cave now. The tenth junior brother can’t maintain the flag formation for much longer.”</p><p>Although we obtained the jade amulet from the deserter at Douniu Peak, no one knows if the Lan Dou Gate has altered the Lei Ku cave's restrictions.  It might take some effort…"</p><p>Urged by the man in black robes, everyone followed the insect, heading straight for the pool.</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue looked back and saw Zhao Songqiao leaving through the black smoke passage.</p><p>The man in black robes noticed his action and said calmly, "Shopkeeper Xue, rest assured. I've already instructed the tenth disciple. Zhao Songqiao has rendered great service; we will only erase his memory from this period, not harm his life. After all, Master said this item is extremely important, perhaps a Wuzhu tribe artifact. If it were to get out, it could bring disaster to our Black Snake Mountain. You should understand."</p><p>Shopkeeper Xue's heart tightened, and he quickly explained, "I understand, senior brother. It's just that recalling the years of mutual support between him and his ancestors, I feel somewhat sentimental."</p><p>The man in black robes didn't comment, continuing, "Reward and punishment are clear-cut, a rule set by Master.  This applies not only to Zhao Songqiao, but to you as well. Although the fourth disciple unfortunately met with an accident, your contributions to the sect, junior brother, are clear to me, and I have already reported them to Master. Upon our return to the mountain, Master will reward you."</p><p>"Thank you, second senior brother!"</p><p>The worry in Shopkeeper Xue's eyes lessened slightly.</p><p>The Dark Thunderwood forest was large, but for cultivators at the Golden Core stage, its size wasn't an issue.  While they spoke, they reached the pool.</p><p>The insect buzzed once and flew into the man in black robes' embrace.</p><p>The man in black robes stood at the pool's edge, his eyes flashing with brilliant light as he gazed into the depths.</p><p>Then, a small jade amulet appeared in his hand. He silently chanted a few words, and tossed it into the pool.</p><p>Upon entering the water, the amulet caused a whirlpool to suddenly appear in the pool.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The whirlpool grew larger.  Just as a look of satisfaction appeared on the man's face, it froze.</p><p>The stone steps, which should have been at the bottom of the pool, were absent.</p><p>"It's been altered!"</p><p>The man in black robes' expression darkened.</p><p>The others gathered around, staring at the pool. Someone said, "The amulet still works, indicating the previous restriction hasn't changed. It's just that an additional layer has been added."</p><p>The man in black robes nodded. "It seems we can't avoid alarming them. We'll have to forcefully break the restriction. Get the Beast King Banners, form the array, quickly!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Following orders, everyone took out their Beast King Banners.</p><p>Their cultivation levels varied, as did the number of banners they controlled.  They had fewer than eighty-one banners in total, but their combined power was still considerable.</p>
