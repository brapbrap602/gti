<h1>Chapter 1192: Progress</h1><p>Cutting off delusions and refining the Dao heart is something no cultivator dares to overlook on their path of cultivation. Qin Sang experienced the rise and fall of desires and thoughts, but his true heart never strayed, and no inner demons arose. He even bypassed the inner demon tribulation during his Nascent Soul Heavenly Tribulation. For now, this was undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p>Qin Sang had saved himself the step of resisting inner demons and didn’t need to exhaust his efforts searching for rare treasures to suppress them. This meant his breakthrough and cultivation speed would undoubtedly be much faster. However, Qin Sang didn’t know how long the Jade Buddha could protect him. When the Jade Buddha was no longer with him, would his Dao heart, which had never been tempered by inner demons, remain steadfast?</p><p>Thus, he dared not act recklessly. Even without inner demons, he couldn’t afford to relax. However, refining his Dao heart would be much easier, and he wouldn’t need to tread as cautiously as other cultivators, as if walking on thin ice. Qin Sang had never imagined that the Jade Buddha, which could suppress inner demons, might one day become an obstacle.</p><p>He attempted to stir up his desires using the *Demonic Seal of No Birth* technique, hoping to provoke an inner demon. But it was like a still lake, with not a ripple in sight. If no inner demons arose, how could the demonic seal manifest?</p><p>“The *Demonic Seal of No Birth*… truly lives up to its name—‘no birth’ indeed,” Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>He gently caressed the jade slip, finding no immediate solution, and had no choice but to set aside this sinister technique for the time being. However, the technique wasn’t entirely useless. Since his senior sister had once cultivated it, the technique itself did have the effect of breaking through bottlenecks. When he had time, he could delve deeper into it and perhaps grasp some of its true essence.</p><p>The purpose of a cultivator’s travels was to broaden their horizons and gain insights through analogies. After sitting in meditation for a long time, Qin Sang stood up and left the side hall. He exited the city lord’s mansion, concealed his aura, and quietly arrived at an abandoned courtyard in the city.</p><p>Before long, a figure stealthily entered—it was Mei Gu.</p><p>“Disciple pays her respects to Master!” Mei Gu, having received the message, hurried over. Under Qin Sang’s personal guidance, she had corrected her past mistakes, and her cultivation had significantly improved.</p><p>Qin Sang motioned for Mei Gu to rise. Seeing her progress, he nodded slightly and asked in a deep voice, “How many disciples were killed or injured in the recent battle?”</p><p>“Reporting to Master, after delivering the letter to Senior Leng as ordered, I received his covert protection. In this battle, only a few disciples were accidentally injured…” Mei Gu reported in detail.</p><p>She was inwardly curious. During this time, she had secretly gathered information on the Nascent Soul cultivators of the two regions but still couldn’t determine her master’s true identity. Given his close relationship with Sect Master Leng of the Yuan Shen Sect, he was likely a senior from the righteous path, but she didn’t know which ancestor he was.</p><p>After listening to Mei Gu’s report, Qin Sang nodded lightly and asked, “What about the task I assigned you? Any progress?”</p><p>Mei Gu’s expression turned serious. She knew this was the real reason her master had summoned her. Fortunately, she had always treated this matter as a top priority and had never slacked off.</p><p>“After arriving at Stone Song Mountain, I found a way to befriend fellow disciples of the Qingyang Demonic Sect and uncovered some information about the Divine Peak. After the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s sect master formed his Nascent Soul, he secluded himself on the Divine Peak for an entire year. When he emerged, the green mist on the peak surged, covering the entire mountaintop. The phantom of the Ancestral Sacred Flame was also enveloped by the green mist, and its previously restless and violent aura completely vanished…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank upon hearing this.</p><p>Could the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s sect master have subdued the Ancestral Sacred Flame immediately after forming his Nascent Soul? The aura of the Ancestral Sacred Flame on the Divine Peak was no weaker than the Winter Nether Cold Flame. Qin Sang had assumed that the sect master would need at least mid-Nascent Soul cultivation to achieve this.</p><p>There was only one explanation: the Ancestral Sacred Flame was actually the Qingyang Demonic Flame left behind by the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s founding ancestor. Since the sect master cultivated the same technique, he could easily refine it.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s cultivation technique was unique. If a disciple failed in their cultivation and perished, they would leave behind a seed of demonic flame, which others could refine—a great supplement to their cultivation. This was also why the righteous path did not recognize the Qingyang Demonic Sect.</p><p>This made things more complicated. If the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s sect master hadn’t resolved the Ancestral Sacred Flame’s instability, there might still be room for negotiation. But if he had already subdued the flame, why would he hand it over? This person’s strength was likely far beyond what the rumors suggested.</p><p>Unless there was a treasure he couldn’t refuse, other methods would be futile. Would he have to search for another spiritual flame? Qin Sang frowned inwardly.</p><p>He had originally planned to meet this demonic sect master, but the man had been sent out on patrol by Elder Zhenyi, and they had missed each other.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang’s thoughts, Mei Gu continued reporting the information she had gathered. “There’s a strange occurrence. After the sect master descended the mountain, he strictly forbade all disciples above the late Foundation Establishment stage from ascending the mountain to absorb Qingyang Divine Jade. Instead, the sect distributes it periodically for their cultivation.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Qin Sang’s eyes flickered.</p><p>This was indeed strange. Qingyang Divine Jade was the purest form of divine energy. When Qin Sang had infiltrated the Qingyang Demonic Sect, the Ancestral Sacred Flame had already been extremely volatile, and the spiritual energy was chaotic. Yet, disciples were still allowed to ascend the mountain to absorb it. They just couldn’t recklessly draw energy near the summit, as it would trigger a flame surge. But now, they weren’t even allowed to ascend the mountain.</p><p>This didn’t seem like the behavior of someone who had subdued the Ancestral Sacred Flame.</p><p>“Recently, I befriended a fellow cultivator who is a direct disciple of the Qingyang Demonic Sect’s sect master and is highly regarded. She must know many secrets, but she is naturally suspicious. I’m afraid of arousing her suspicions, so I haven’t dared to ask too much yet. I’ll need to wait until we’re more familiar before…”</p><p>After finishing her report, Mei Gu felt uneasy, fearing her master would reprimand her for not making sufficient progress.</p><p>“You’ve done well,” Qin Sang nodded, knowing that such matters couldn’t be rushed. Mei Gu had already done remarkably well. “These pills are newly acquired and can aid Golden Core cultivators in their cultivation. Focus on gathering information and avoid unnecessary actions. Don’t rush for results, and always prioritize your safety.”</p><p>As the saying goes, a wise ruler doesn’t send hungry soldiers to war. He took out a jade bottle containing pills obtained from the remnants of the old demon Pei.</p><p>“Thank you, Master!” Seeing that her master not only didn’t reprimand her but also showed concern for her, Mei Gu’s fear of him lessened, and her gratitude became more sincere.</p><p>After sending Mei Gu away, Qin Sang transformed back into the Demon King and returned to Threefold Pass with the little demons of Thousand Bamboo Sea. Jing Lin and Si Di, being perceptive, arranged for the little demons without needing Qin Sang to say much. The old horse monkey took advantage of this time to swiftly return to the mountain to deliver orders.</p><p>The war continued, with skirmishes breaking out at other passes, but Threefold Mountain remained eerily quiet. The Sin Abyss seemed to think this place was too formidable to breach and had no plans to attack from here. Jing Lin and Si Di, however, took the initiative and launched attacks, discovering that the Zen Spirit had set up a camp a hundred miles from Threefold Pass, personally stationed there. It was difficult to break through their defenses.</p><p>After several back-and-forth skirmishes, things gradually quieted down.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang, as agreed, presided over the Cold Bell Formation and rarely left the high tower, ensuring his cultivation wasn’t interrupted. The seven sword souls were finally nearing complete integration with the seven souls.</p><p>He had been keeping an eye on Shaohua Mountain and recently received confirmed news. Since the war began, Mu Yifeng, Che Yutao, Qiu Mubai, and others had been in seclusion at their sect and had never appeared on the battlefield.</p>
