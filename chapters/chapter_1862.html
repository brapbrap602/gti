Chapter 1853: Traces of the Spirit Tree


Illusion or reality?


For a moment, Qin Sang felt a surge of confusion.


Along the way, he had burst twenty or so bubbles with his grasp, and countless others had shattered against the waves of light.


All signs indicated that the scenes within the bubbles were mere phantoms, not truly existent.


Yet, he had inexplicably pulled a red tile from one such phantom.


Qin Sang held it before his eyes, turning it over and over, confirming its tangible existence.


Cool to the touch, its surface gleamed, seemingly still damp with dew.


The red tile appeared to be forged from a special kind of spirit rock, capable of bearing inscribed restrictive runes.


Whether because it had left the bubble, or because the Eight-Cornered Pavilion's restrictions had long since been eroded by time, the runes had lost all their power, making their origin indiscernible.


This suggested the Eight-Cornered Pavilion was the work of a cultivator, and these were no ordinary illusions.


“Are these bubbles passages to some hidden Cave Heaven, or are they fragments of a shattered Cave Heaven, existing in a peculiar state between reality and illusion?”


Qin Sang couldn't fathom the answer, but he didn't feel discouraged, long accustomed to such enigmas.


During his years at the Healing Altar, he had witnessed too many things that defied conventional understanding. Ultimately, the reason was his own insufficient cultivation and limited perspective.


Storing the red tile, Qin Sang continued his descent, soon spotting another bubble. He approached it, reaching out his hand.


His hand entered the bubble without resistance.


As before, the bubble burst with a pop, the scene within vanishing, leaving his hand empty.


Undeterred, he continued his attempts until, with the fourth bubble, he finally grasped something.


Qin Sang looked up at the massive boulder resting in his palm, speechless.


The boulder, nearly a hundred zhang tall and shaped like a goose egg, was an ordinary rock, devoid of any mystical properties.


The scene within the bubble had depicted a cliff, with this boulder perched precariously on its edge, seemingly about to fall.


Qin Sang had seen a cave on the cliff face, clearly an Immortal's dwelling, and had intended to retrieve something from within.


It turned out that acquiring something, treasure or mundane object, was entirely a matter of luck.


True Essence flowed from his palm, reducing the boulder to dust.


Based on his previous encounters, Qin Sang judged that the Vajra Bodhi Tree likely resided within one of these bubbles. However, even if he found that bubble, he might not be able to retrieve a Vajra Seed.


“Since this chaotic phenomenon is caused by the emergence of the Vajra Bodhi Tree, the tree itself should be different…”


Qin Sang pondered, continuing to cleave through the waves.


From then on, he attempted to grasp every bubble that came near, retrieving a bizarre assortment of objects, none of significant value.


Gradually, Qin Sang discerned a pattern.


The deeper he ventured into the valley, the higher the probability of retrieving something. The bubbles seemed to transition from reality to illusion as they drifted out of the valley, eventually dissipating completely into nothingness.


After some time, another discovery confirmed this pattern.


‘Bang!’


As Qin Sang reached for a bubble, a faint blue light shimmered on its surface, repelling his fingers.


His eyes flickered as he scrutinized the bubble.


Inside, there was a clearly man-made platform, surrounded by four bare stone pillars of unknown purpose.


He applied a bit more force, and with a ‘crack,’ the blue light dispersed, the bubble shattering.


Immediately afterward, the platform and pillars materialized before Qin Sang.


The four pillars, a thousand zhang tall and perfectly intact, exuded an aura of ancient decay.


Slightly startled, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then watched as a wave of light crashed against them, instantly reducing the platform and pillars to dust.


After encountering these pillars, it was as if Qin Sang had crossed the boundary between reality and illusion.


Further down, he encountered bubbles with lingering blue light at regular intervals.


Protected by the blue light, the scenes within these bubbles had yet to transition to illusion and were real.


Qin Sang speculated that the blue light might be a unique form of restrictive power.


As bubbles continued to burst, revealing a variety of real objects, Qin Sang felt like he was traversing a shattered world. Unfortunately, he had yet to find an ancient cultivator's dwelling.


However, these were not his primary concern. Here, Qin Sang sensed the presence of Wood Spirit Qi permeating the space!


It was only a faint trace, but it invigorated him, and he immediately followed the sensation to its source.


Before long, Qin Sang found the origin of the Wood Spirit Qi.


It emanated from another bubble, filled with lush greenery.  Only the dense canopy and a multitude of green leaves were visible, suggesting the presence of dozens of ancient trees.


Qin Sang tentatively reached out, his worries dispelled. The blue light restriction could protect the bubble from dissipating but couldn't completely isolate its interior. Wood Spirit Qi still seeped out.


It was also possible that the vibrations within the Sea of Light had created flaws in the blue light restriction, though Qin Sang didn't yet understand its nature and couldn't discern these flaws.


This was undoubtedly a good thing. Qin Sang fully activated his Spiritwood Body, sensing the Wood Spirit Qi within the valley.


Even though it was all Wood Spirit Qi, the aura emitted by different plants varied. Superior spirit wood possessed a purer and richer aura. His Spiritwood Body, with its acute sensitivity, could distinguish these subtle differences. Using this ability, he had a chance of finding the Vajra Bodhi Tree.


Spiritwood Body, Heavenly Eye Divine Ability.


Apart from being outnumbered by Ling You Wang and the other demons, Qin Sang's abilities were no less potent, perhaps even superior. What followed was a silent contest of strength.


As he continued to descend, the bubbles became increasingly dense.


Initially, Qin Sang would attempt to burst any bubble that seemed to harbor secrets, hoping for a reward.


Gradually, he ceased his frequent attempts, as the blue light restrictions on the bubbles grew stronger, making them impossible to burst casually.


He kept his goal firmly in mind. Even if these bubbles contained genuine treasures, missing the Vajra Seed would be a greater loss.


After a while, the Wood Spirit Qi in the void noticeably intensified, emanating from all directions, swirling and dispersing within the waves of light.


Qin Sang focused on the purest and richest strand of Wood Spirit Qi he sensed, constantly moving.


His search yielded a bountiful harvest, adding several spirit herbs to his Thousand Jun Ring.


The Healing Altar's existence transcended ordinary time, allowing spirit herbs to mature beyond measure, their medicinal properties reaching their peak, untouched and gathering dust.


Unfortunately, he still hadn't found the Vajra Bodhi Tree.


"Hmm?"


Just then, Qin Sang's expression shifted, the faint green light surrounding his body suddenly brightening.


The green light enveloped a large area, then locked onto a specific direction. Sensing briefly, he was overjoyed.


He had detected a new strand of Wood Spirit Qi, far purer and richer than that of the other spirit herbs. Even if it wasn't the Vajra Bodhi Tree, it was exceptionally valuable.


Without hesitation, he changed direction, pursuing the source of this Wood Spirit Qi.


Meanwhile.


Elsewhere in the valley.


Ding Xiang Hou and another demon lord clad in white armor stared at the bubble before them, their faces alight with delight.


Golden light radiated from within the bubble, revealing a spirit tree amidst the dazzling brilliance.


Due to their angle, they could only see the tree's crown, but that was enough.


Among the leaves, a single spirit fruit hung: a Vajra Seed!


"We found it first!"


The white-armored demon lord rubbed his hands excitedly, his gaze fixed on the Vajra Seed.


Upon entering the valley, they were awed by its vastness and constant tremors.  Faced with competition, they decided to split up to expedite their search for the Vajra Bodhi Tree.


Ling You Wang went alone.


To guard against Qin Sang, Ding Xiang Hou and the white-armored demon lord paired up, while the remaining three demon lords formed another group, providing mutual support.


Splitting into three groups proved highly effective.


"I wonder how my friend plans to…"


The white-armored demon lord glanced at Ding Xiang Hou, a flicker of greed in his eyes.  No one knew how many Vajra Seeds a single tree could bear.


They could break the blue light restriction on the bubble, secretly keep a small portion, and present the majority to Ling You Wang. It seemed entirely feasible.


He was interrupted mid-sentence by Ding Xiang Hou's cold snort. "Yuan Hou, be careful what you say. Don't let treasures cloud your judgment. We found the divine tree first. His Majesty will surely reward us handsomely. Why bother with unnecessary risks? We must report to His Majesty quickly and break the restriction before anything goes wrong!"


The valley's constant tremors and chaotic energy greatly limited their communication talismans and divine abilities, preventing them from directly contacting Ling You Wang.


"Yes, yes, yes…"


Yuan Hou nodded repeatedly, no longer daring to mention the matter.  Together with Ding Xiang Hou, he enveloped the bubble with their blood Qi and flew towards the area where Ling You Wang was located.


They had already tested the blue light restriction on the bubble and found it remarkably resilient, difficult to break in a short time.


Breaking the blue light restriction would undoubtedly cause a significant disturbance.  With a mysterious expert still lurking nearby, caution was paramount.


Unfortunately, they couldn't store these bubbles in storage artifacts, otherwise, it wouldn't be so troublesome.


Ding Xiang Hou devoted part of his attention to vigilance, while Yuan Hou focused intently on the bubble.


"Be careful," Ding Xiang Hou cautioned.


The bubbles here weren't uniform.  In the same location, some had begun to dissipate while others remained real. They couldn't rely on past experience to predict where a bubble would start to dissipate.  There were certainly other factors at play, not entirely related to location.


Therefore, they didn't dare fly directly towards the valley's exit with the bubble.


They feared that if they crossed a certain point, the blue light restriction might suddenly vanish, catching them off guard and allowing the Vajra Seed to fade into nothingness – a truly regrettable outcome.


After all, they knew very little about the blue light restriction.


As they were flying, Ding Xiang Hou suddenly frowned, sensing something, and abruptly turned around.


Deep blue light surged like ocean waves, the crests glowing brightest, forming shimmering blue lines that outlined the contours of the waves.


Layer upon layer of light waves rolled in, the bubbles within them resembling fish in the sea, a captivating sight.


Amidst these waves, a sharp streak of lightning, its edge honed to a razor's sharpness, disrupted the harmonious scene. It sped towards them with unerring accuracy.


"It's him!"


Ding Xiang Hou instantly recognized Qin Sang's Thunder Escape technique and cursed inwardly.


The enemy seemed to know they had found the spirit tree, flying towards them at full speed.  Even seeing it again, Ding Xiang Hou was astonished by the sheer velocity of the escape light.


"What should we do?"


Yuan Hou was equally alarmed.  Seeing the escape light firsthand, he realized that Ping Hou's previous description hadn't been exaggerated in the slightest.


This person could suppress Ping Hou and kill Gui Hou in front of His Majesty. Yuan Hou knew he wasn't a match for him, and even with Ding Xiang Hou, he felt uneasy.


Ding Xiang Hou knew they couldn't possibly outrun this person.  He stopped, his expression shifting between dark and light.


In an instant, he made a decision. "Yuan Hou, quickly go and inform His Majesty. I will hold him off!"


Yuan Hou's heart sank further at these words. Did Ding Xiang Hou lack confidence in the two of them repelling this person?


Ding Xiang Hou had more on his mind. This person's escape technique was extraordinary, making it difficult for them to inflict any damage.  Meanwhile, the enemy could continuously harass them, probing for weaknesses and waiting for an opportunity to strike.


If they were separated and attacked individually, and Yuan Hou died first, he would be left alone, unable to escape or inform Ling You Wang, putting him in an even more precarious position.


Ling You Wang's cautionary words made Ding Xiang Hou wary of underestimating this person.


However, Ding Xiang Hou considered himself among the top demon lords in the Ghost Fang Kingdom.  Even if he wasn't a match for this person, he could hold him off for a while.


"Be careful, my friend!"


Yuan Hou understood the stakes and obeyed the order.  He immediately manifested his demon form, summoned his escape light, fully activated his divine abilities, and flew away.


He didn't take the bubble with him. If this person targeted him, he would have no chance of survival.


Ding Xiang Hou flicked his robes, storing the bubble in his sleeve, and gazed at the approaching escape light.


The enemy seemed to have guessed Yuan Hou's intentions, his escape light veering to intercept him.


Ding Xiang Hou sneered inwardly, transforming into white smoke and flitting through dozens of light waves to position himself between the enemy and Yuan Hou.


"He must be going to inform Ling You Wang…"


Qin Sang observed their actions and sighed inwardly.


Lacking sufficient manpower, they had been beaten to the punch.  Fortunately, he had received guidance and tracked down his target.


Seeing Yuan Hou's escape light disappear, Qin Sang knew he had no chance of intercepting him. He turned his gaze back to Ding Xiang Hou, killing intent flashing in his eyes.


In that case, he would seize the spirit tree before Ling You Wang arrived!


'Boom!'


Their gazes clashed across the waves of light, both man and demon feeling a jolt, their expressions grim.


'Crack!'


Amidst the sound of thunder, Qin Sang burst through the waves, his figure materializing within the lightning.


He looked at Ding Xiang Hou's sleeve.


Qin Sang twitched his lips, a smile appearing on his face. Due to its unusual nature, it appeared more like a sinister grin to ordinary eyes.


“Fellow Daoist, by blocking my path, do you wish to share the divine tree with me? I am not greedy. We can join forces to break open the bubble. Considering that you still need to offer tribute to the Demon King upon your return, I will only take thirty percent. How about it?”


Ding Xiang Hou appeared to ponder seriously, as if genuinely considering the proposal. Finally, he said with feigned regret, “I dare not make such a decision on my own. It would be better to wait for His Majesty to arrive and discuss it with you face-to-face. If we can transform conflict into harmony, it would be a joyous occasion for all.”


Qin Sang hadn't held out much hope, nor did he dare gamble on the Demon King's character. He sighed softly, raised his hand, and pointed. Sword light flashed like lightning, striking directly at Ding Xiang Hou.


Ding Xiang Hou was already prepared.


He didn't utter any nonsense about "finders keepers."  Not only had they clashed before, but even if they were strangers, encountering each other before a treasure meant only one eternal rule applied:  Virtue prevails!


'Whoosh!'


His long beard danced in the wind as countless strands of white Qi wove into a net.


Ding Xiang Hou summoned his elephant trunk, which spewed forth two streams of white Qi, merging with the net to form a sturdy barrier before him.


Peering through the gaps in the net, Ding Xiang Hou's eyes narrowed as he watched the approaching Cloud Wanderer Sword.


"This sword is truly extraordinary! No wonder a single strike from it left Ping Hou so disheveled…"


With this thought flashing through his mind, Ding Xiang Hou tapped his foot, transforming into white smoke and retreating.
