<h1>Chapter 1768: Baishi Zhi</h1><p>Northern Pole Exorcism Court.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Wandering Emissary still received Qin Sang.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you’ve completed the Dharma Decree so quickly?”</p><p>The Wandering Emissary looked at the unharmed Qin Sang, a hint of surprise in his expression.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little perplexed. This Dharma Decree, seemingly dangerous, requiring infiltration of a Demon Marquis’ territory, was actually incomparable in difficulty to those decrees involving intelligence gathering and assassinating Demon Commanders.</p><p>If it weren’t for True Person Zhi Jian stirring up this trouble, he would have been even more successful.</p><p>“I am fortunate to have fulfilled my duty.”</p><p>Qin Sang presented the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>The Wandering Emissary reached out to take it, and after carefully examining it, a strange glint flashed in his eyes.  Then he retrieved a thumb-sized jade talisman and handed it to Qin Sang: “This is Senior Ling Xu’s token. It contains a special mark left by him. Fellow Daoist, holding this, you can go to Senior Ling Xu’s residence in Baishi Zhi, Xu Yi Jing, and meet him.”</p><p>The location of Grandmaster Ling Xu’s residence was no secret. Qin Sang had already inquired about it beforehand.</p><p>Solemnly accepting the jade talisman, Qin Sang bowed and said, “If the Emissary has no further instructions, this humble Daoist will take his leave.”</p><p>“Please, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Wandering Emissary escorted Qin Sang out of the hall. Standing in front of the hall, he pondered for a long time, then suddenly realized something and hurriedly left.</p><p>……</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>True Person Cui Wei entered the Northern Pole Exorcism Court. The guards, upon seeing the Nine Heavens Investigating Emissary, all bowed in respect.</p><p>The more astute among them noticed the somber expression on True Person Cui Wei’s face and felt a jolt of alarm. They behaved even more respectfully, fearing his displeasure.</p><p>Walking directly into his official residence, True Person Cui Wei had just settled down when the Nine Heavens Wandering Emissary walked in quickly.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”</p><p>The Wandering Emissary bowed deeply. Seeing his master’s expression, he understood the reason.</p><p>A few days ago, he received intelligence that his master’s plan had failed, and he had fled the Ghost Fang Kingdom in disarray, though the details were unclear.</p><p>The Wandering Emissary carefully observed his master’s face and said, “That demon, Marquis Liu…”</p><p>“It was this master who overestimated himself!”</p><p>True Person Cui Wei sighed. There was nothing to hide in front of his own disciple, so he explained the reason for his exposure. Finally, he gave a self-deprecating laugh, “As they say, misfortune is where fortune lies. Unexpectedly, that Marquis Liu was extremely vigilant and had already invited experts to guard his territory. If this master hadn't been exposed early, and Marquis Liu had acted hastily without sufficient preparation, the losses might have been greater.”</p><p>Hearing this, the Wandering Emissary’s expression showed sudden understanding. “So that’s how it is! True Person Qing Feng brought the Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower earlier, and I thought…”</p><p>“True Person Qing Feng?”</p><p>True Person Cui Wei raised his eyes. “The one who accepted the Dharma Decree, he returned?”</p><p>“He returned ten days ago.  His Qi was full, and he was unharmed. This disciple hadn't received the intelligence report at the time, so I didn't ask further,” the Wandering Emissary nodded.</p><p>True Person Cui Wei leaned back slightly and scoffed, “This person can evade Marquis Liu’s eyes and return safely; his abilities are not insignificant. This time, it was also his good fortune.”</p><p>A token from a Grandmaster Alchemist was incredibly precious.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, a Dharma Decree for merely gathering spirit herbs would hardly be exchanged for such an opportunity unless the spirit herbs were urgently needed by that Grandmaster.</p><p>The Wandering Emissary spoke softly, “This disciple, initially unaware of the inside story, upon seeing this person’s unexpected return, investigated further.  It can be confirmed that Qing Feng is an alias; this person’s identity is fake.”</p><p>True Person Cui Wei was not surprised by this.</p><p>In Ju Shan Zhi, this kind of thing was commonplace.</p><p>Besides those wanted by the Celestial Court, many cultivators outside the Dao Sects also liked to disguise their identities.</p><p>This was a strategy for survival in the cracks between two colossal powers. If they offended the Celestial Court or the Ghost Fang Kingdom, they could immediately discard this identity and transform into someone else.</p><p>True Person Cui Wei hummed, his tone calm.</p><p>In fact, this Dharma Decree was part of a plan to lure out the enemy.  The Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower was real, but Grandmaster Ling Xu issuing the Dharma Decree had True Person Cui Wei’s influence behind it.</p><p>Once the plan was launched, the person accepting the Dharma Decree would undoubtedly face certain death, perhaps even ten deaths without life.</p><p>The cultivator accepting the herb-gathering task couldn't be too strong or too weak. Within the Dao Sects, those with such cultivation were either pillars of a particular sect or held high positions in the Celestial Court. The loss of one would be a significant blow, and other colleagues would not stand idly by.  The candidate could only be found outside the Dao Sects.</p><p>When Qin Sang accepted the Dharma Decree, his information had already been delivered to True Person Cui Wei’s desk.</p><p>Upon learning that this True Person Qing Feng was the one who uncovered the conspiracy behind the Demon God and slew Marquis Liu’s Demon Commander, True Person Cui Wei was overjoyed.</p><p>Through the Dharma Decree, one could inconspicuously send someone to their death, although the selection couldn't be too meticulous. What if the investigation revealed a powerful background? Should they use them or not?</p><p>It could be said that the origin of this matter was related to True Person Qing Feng. This person couldn’t be a spy for the Ghost Fang Kingdom and was the most suitable candidate.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Noticing the strange expression on his disciple’s face, a sudden flash of inspiration struck True Person Cui Wei.</p><p>Previously, he hadn't suspected anything.</p><p>Because the Demon God’s disturbances were not limited to that one place, it wasn't an isolated incident.  During this period, news of Demon God sightings had come from various locations, which had aroused their attention.</p><p>What if Marquis Liu went against the grain, and this person was a spy he had planted?</p><p>At the cost of a Demon Commander’s life, setting an ambush in his territory, luring him into a trap…</p><p>Thoughts churned in True Person Cui Wei's mind.  Logic told him this possibility was small.</p><p>Whether or not to infiltrate the Ghost Fang Kingdom, the decision was in his own hands.</p><p>Within the Celestial Court, his informed colleagues all opposed this plan. He, in order to obtain more accurate intelligence and present meritorious service to the Governing Altar, had decided to take the risk.</p><p>It seemed unlikely for Marquis Liu to mobilize his forces for something so intangible.</p><p>“Did you find his true identity?”</p><p>True Person Cui Wei pressed.</p><p>The Wandering Emissary said shamefully, “Not yet!  However, this person once entered this place, and he holds True Person Zhi Jian’s talisman. He should have a close relationship with him…”</p><p>Saying this, the Wandering Emissary channeled his True Essence, conjuring an image of a corner of the Immortal City in the air, pointing to a courtyard within.</p><p>True Person Cui Wei’s gaze narrowed slightly. “True Person Zhi Jian, who recently swept clean Ling Du Mountain?”</p><p>The Wandering Emissary nodded.</p><p>True Person Cui Wei closed his eyes slightly, leaned back on the couch, and after pondering for a moment, said, “No need to investigate further.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang, within his cave dwelling, was completely unaware of these events.</p><p>Having obtained the token, Qin Sang didn’t immediately go to Baishi Zhi to visit Grandmaster Ling Xu. He continued to return to his cave dwelling for arduous cultivation.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Refining Form* had not yet reached great completion. Qin Sang planned to wait until he was close to a breakthrough before setting off.</p><p>Crane Cry Mountain was a rare place where he could cultivate peacefully.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Eighteen years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>For eighteen years, Qin Sang cultivated diligently, rarely venturing out.  Only when he needed pills would he go out, spending merit points to exchange for them at the Celestial Court.</p><p>In fact, with the Dragon Transformation Pool’s spirit liquid and this world’s blessed environment, Qin Sang didn’t have a great need for external resources. It was in order to reach his peak cultivation as quickly as possible and leave himself ample buffer time that he purchased pills in large quantities.</p><p>Hard work paid off. After a full eighteen years, Qin Sang finally cultivated the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* to the peak of the fourth level!</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up and dashed out the door, his entire being like a ferocious beast.</p><p>The Dire Wolf, resting outside, jolted awake and rolled to its feet, its fur standing on end.</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from Qin Sang, the Dire Wolf’s pupils dilated, revealing deep fear.</p><p>“Congratulations, Immortal Lord, on achieving great completion of your divine power!”</p><p>The Dire Wolf prostrated itself on the ground.</p><p>Because its Soul Altar had been seized and it hadn't obtained a Demon Core, fearing that continued cultivation would lead to mental disarray, it hadn’t made much progress these years, playing the role of a watchdog for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the abundant power within his body and smiled faintly, “In a few years, I’ll send you to the Demon Kingdom.”</p><p>With his physical strength realm breaking through, he once again possessed the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator, considered a strong individual in this world.</p><p>The secrets the Dire Wolf knew were all its own conjectures.  Even if it spoke, others wouldn't believe it; they were inconsequential.</p><p>Dismissing the Dire Wolf, Qin Sang flipped his palm and took out the bone flute.</p><p>The bone flute was smooth and white, emitting a faint fluorescence, giving a warm and gentle feeling.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Refining Form* originated from this treasure.</p><p>However, since Qin Sang started cultivating this technique until today, the technique within the bone flute had only revealed the first four levels, the rest covered by mist.</p><p>Qin Sang was only a step away from breaking through, yet the bone flute remained unchanged.</p><p>“Will the subsequent levels only appear after the breakthrough?”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, lost in thought.</p><p>……</p><p>Baishi Zhi.</p><p>Xu Yi Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang, clad in a crane cloak, appeared before a bamboo forest.</p><p>The bamboo forest was lush and vibrant, exuding an air of natural freshness. A small path meandered towards the depths of the forest.</p><p>Sensing this rare tranquil atmosphere, Qin Sang inwardly admired it. This place was the core area of the Xu Yi Jing Altar Immortal City.</p><p>Planting such a vast bamboo forest in this precious land where every inch was worth its weight in gold – this was truly the essence of hiding in plain sight.</p><p>Standing before the path, Qin Sang bowed towards the empty bamboo forest.  “This humble Daoist, Qing Feng, pays respects to Grandmaster Ling Xu.”</p><p>Not long after, a young boy emerged from the bamboo forest, returning Qin Sang’s bow formally and methodically.  After checking the token, he said crisply, “The Grandmaster invites you in.”</p><p>There were only a few thatched huts in the depths of the bamboo forest.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang easily met Grandmaster Ling Xu.</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu was an elderly man with white hair and a youthful face, holding an ebony dragon-headed staff. His eyes were especially bright and piercing.</p><p>He didn't conceal his aura, revealing only early Nascent Soul cultivation, but his fame was unmatched by cultivators of the same level.</p><p>“Greetings, Grandmaster Ling Xu.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed deeply.</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu stroked his beard and smiled, “True Person Qing Feng, this old Daoist remembers you. Thanks to you bringing back the complete Dream Weaving Four Seasons Flower last time, the medicinal properties were exceptional. This old Daoist successfully refined that batch of spirit pills, and their quality was superb. This old Daoist had long wanted to meet you, but unexpectedly, it took eighteen years.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist cultivated in Crane Cry Mountain for eighteen years, I did not intend for the Grandmaster to wait so long,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Are you here to use this token?”</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu glanced at the jade talisman in the boy's hand.  “I remember the Celestial Court sending a message to inquire; you wanted to use the token to have me request Grandmaster Xuan Ji Men’s assistance.”</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu shook his head slightly, “Those who seek this old Daoist all ask for pills to be refined.  You are the first to forgo the opportunity for pill refinement and seek something else.”</p><p>Saying this, Grandmaster Ling Xu stood up, tapped the ground lightly with his dragon staff, and walked outwards, “This old Daoist just happens to have a matter and intends to visit an old friend at Xuan Ji Men. We can take care of both matters together.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned, then overjoyed.  He hurriedly followed. Grandmaster Ling Xu’s personal appearance held more weight than a letter.</p><p>The two first went to Xu Yi Jing's teleportation formation.</p><p>With Grandmaster Ling Xu present, they didn't encounter any scrutiny.</p><p>When Qin Sang emerged from the teleportation hall, he saw a sight far grander than the Xu Yi Jing Immortal City.</p><p>The Immortal City before him seemed to be built in the sky.</p><p>Below, immortal clouds swirled endlessly, supporting this enormous city.</p><p>It was just at the time of sunset, and Qin Sang happened to be facing west.</p><p>At the edge of the Immortal City.</p><p>There, the colorful clouds spread, golden light filled the sky, and within seemed to be layers of immortal mountains and golden halls, reaching the azure heavens, resembling a celestial palace.</p><p>“Even the legendary Nine Heavens Golden Palace wouldn’t be more magnificent than this.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze lingered.</p><p>This was Baishi Zhi!</p><p>This Baishi Zhi referred solely to this Immortal City, the location of Baishi Zhi's Governing Altar!</p><p>It was said that the Great True People of the Northern Pole Exorcism Court, the Third Rank Nine Heavens Golden Palace Upper Secretary Nine Heavens Investigating Emissary, the Full Third Rank Nine Heavens Golden Palace Upper Immortal, Nine Heavens Inspecting Emissary, and even higher-ranking celestial officials resided within those cloud palaces and immortal halls.</p><p>Qin Sang had long admired this place. Without Grandmaster Ling Xu accompanying him, he wouldn’t dare to come here alone.</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu didn’t notice Qin Sang’s unusual reaction and pointed outside the city, “It’s still a five-day journey to Xuan Ji Men. Let’s not delay and leave the city quickly.”</p><p>After leaving the city, Grandmaster Ling Xu, wanting to admire the scenery, declined to ride a beast-drawn carriage or palanquin. Qin Sang was happy with this, as it provided a good opportunity to build a relationship with the Grandmaster.</p><p>The two walked at a leisurely pace, flying slowly at a low altitude.</p><p>The vicinity of the Governing Altar was the most civilized place and also where the Dao Sects held the most power.</p><p>Before they had traveled far, they passed by the mountain gates of several sects.</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu wasn't as aloof as rumored, but quite talkative. Qin Sang flattered him appropriately, and both were quite pleased.</p><p>Finding an opportunity, Qin Sang inquired about the Azure Frost Pill with Grandmaster Ling Xu.</p><p>“Eh? This pill seems somewhat different from what this old Daoist has learned… Could you show me the pill formula?”</p><p>After hearing Qin Sang's description, Grandmaster Ling Xu immediately became interested.</p><p>Qin Sang readily obliged and presented the pill formula.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the formula, Grandmaster Ling Xu became absorbed, silent for a full day and night.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently guarded the Grandmaster.</p><p>“Hu! What an exquisite pill formula! The Dao of Alchemy is truly vast and profound; what this old Daoist knows is merely superficial!”</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu sighed with emotion and looked at Qin Sang somewhat eagerly, “Where did Fellow Daoist obtain this… Mm, this old Daoist has been presumptuous!”</p><p>The Azure Frost Pill was a legacy of the Wu Clan.</p><p>In the Dao of Alchemy, there were significant differences between the Wu Clan and the Human Clan. Qin Sang had realized this when he used his avatar to cultivate the Dao of Alchemy.</p><p>“If the Grandmaster is interested, this humble Daoist will search more thoroughly after returning. If I can obtain similar pill formulas, I will immediately send them to the Grandmaster’s residence,” Qin Sang said carefully.</p><p>The *Pan Hu True Scripture* was a secret manual on insect control passed down by the Ghost Mother. The pill formulas recorded within included some even more valuable than the Azure Frost Pill, but Qin Sang didn't intend to present them directly.</p><p>“This old Daoist thanks you in advance, Fellow Daoist!”</p><p>Grandmaster Ling Xu put away his joyful expression and pondered, “The last ingredient you lack, Fellow Daoist, the Sky Centipede Root, if I am not mistaken, should now be called the Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo. Unfortunately, this old Daoist is currently unaware of its whereabouts.  If Fellow Daoist manages to gather all the ingredients in the future, this old Daoist can refine a batch for you free of charge.” (End of Chapter)</p>
