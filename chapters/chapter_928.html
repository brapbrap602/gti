<h1>Chapter 920: Return Journey</h1><p>Chapter 920: Return Journey</p><p>Wind隐 Island.</p><p>One of the most mysterious islands in the  裂风 archipelago, its fame stems from the Wind隐 Island auction.  Rare items, such as the Seven Kills Hall jade tokens that are difficult to obtain elsewhere, can be found there.</p><p>It is rumored that behind Wind隐 Island are not only Yuan Ying masters, but also the shadows of three major trading alliances.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>The Wind隐 Island auction concluded.</p><p>Three Seven Kills Hall jade tokens were purchased at high prices by three mysterious cultivators.</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang, weary from his travels, returned to Poison Island.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu's family was cultivating on Poison Island. Upon learning of Qin Sang's return, they hurriedly came out to greet him.</p><p>Nearly twenty years had passed.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife's appearances had not changed much, but Bai Ying'er was no longer a young girl. Although she had always stayed on Poison Island, sheltered from the outside world, her demeanor was more composed than before.</p><p>The biggest change was their cultivation.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu had reached the False Core stage, while Bai Hong was still stuck at the late Foundation Establishment stage, though she was said to have gained some insight, and a breakthrough was imminent.</p><p>Most astonishing was Bai Ying'er.  Thanks to her innate Water Jade body, she successfully reached the Foundation Establishment stage without the use of Foundation Establishment pills, leaving Qin Sang quite impressed.</p><p>As soon as he returned to his cave dwelling, the two-headed  beast rushed towards Qin Sang, then darted to Bai Ying'er's side and lay down, letting her groom it.</p><p>Bai Ying'er covered her mouth and smiled. First, she bowed respectfully to Qin Sang, then sat cross-legged, placing the two-headed beast on her lap. A layer of water-elemental energy appeared on her palm as she gently stroked its fur, her lips close to the beast's ear, softly speaking to it.</p><p>The two-headed beast wagged its tail and hummed contentedly.</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow.</p><p>The two-headed beast, after a period of apparent despondency, had been spending all its time with Bai Ying'er.  It had almost caused trouble once, and Qin Sang had to clean up the mess.</p><p>“Senior, did you manage to obtain the Seven Kills Hall jade token?”</p><p>Seeing his daughter and the two-headed beast together, Bai Zhongqiu smiled, bowed to Qin Sang, and curiously asked.</p><p>After more than a decade of interaction, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife had come to understand Qin Sang's character better and were less intimidated by him.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed.  “Luckily, I got everything I needed.  I didn’t expect so many people to be vying for the jade tokens; the price was far higher than I anticipated.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, clearly pained by the expense.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the spiritual items obtained from the Black Snake Mountain cultivators; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so confident.  Entering the Seven Kills Hall was a life-threatening endeavor, yet many cultivators risked their lives for the chance of breakthrough and immortality.</p><p>“I've recently obtained some necromancy techniques and need to close myself off for a while. There's nothing that requires your attention for now.  Stay on the island and cultivate. I will have more instructions for you after I finish my seclusion.”</p><p>After giving his instructions, Qin Sang entered his cave dwelling.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu and his wife exchanged glances, feeling both joy and apprehension.</p><p>They rejoiced at being allowed to remain on Poison Island to cultivate, in such a secluded and safe cave dwelling with abundant spiritual energy—a dream for countless cultivators.</p><p>But they also worried about what dangerous tasks Qin Sang might assign them upon his emergence.</p><p>Regardless of the thoughts of others, Qin Sang entered his cave, activated the protective barrier, and with a ‘bang’, took down a black coffin from behind.</p><p>He opened the coffin lid, revealing his external avatar lying inside.</p><p>The avatar's eyes suddenly snapped open, revealing a pair of blood-red pupils that shot out bloodthirsty malice, staring fixedly at Qin Sang. For a moment, the entire cave seemed to transform into a sea of blood.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed slightly as he cast several incantations at the avatar. The blood-red color in the avatar's eyes slowly faded, gradually returning to normal. The avatar rose from the coffin and sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion.</p><p>“The rapid cultivation technique truly harbors great hidden dangers!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave as he looked at his external avatar.</p><p>He had found that the avatar couldn't achieve the required level of cultivation on its own, so he had given it a blood bead and used the rapid cultivation technique from the "Seed Yuan Devil Embryo" manual.</p><p>The consequences quickly manifested.</p><p>“Before, although my cultivation was a level lower than the avatar's, I could still control it with the Jade Buddha's power and prevent backlash. Now, after swallowing only one blood bead, I'm already showing signs of losing control. I have to constantly use the techniques from the 'Seed Yuan Devil Embryo' to pacify the demonic soul.  Once the avatar reaches the peak of the Core Formation stage, I will probably only be able to control it in battle by activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation. Otherwise, it will have to remain dormant.”</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the black coffin.</p><p>The coffin, gleaming with metallic luster, looked unassuming, but was actually a magical treasure, crafted by Qin Sang himself.</p><p>This treasure is arguably Qin Sang's first personally crafted magic artifact.  Qin Sang named it the Heavenly Corpse Coffin. Its design was inspired by the corpse coffin crafting techniques detailed in the *Tian Yin Corpse Manual*.</p><p>After comprehending some of the runes on the Xuan Tie pillar, Qin Sang's alchemy skills greatly improved. He successfully crafted his first magic artifact using some precious妖骨 (yao gu) and spiritual materials he had saved.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Coffin can conceal the aura of his external avatar, shielding it from external spiritual sense detection.  As long as the avatar is inside the coffin, its identity remains hidden.</p><p>Of course, that's only one of its functions.</p><p>In combat, the Heavenly Corpse Coffin can transform into armor for the external avatar.  Qin Sang also found a long-blade magic artifact among his previous spoils of war for the avatar to use.</p><p>After all, the external avatar lacks powerful innate abilities, so crafting suitable magic artifacts is crucial to enhancing its strength.</p><p>“I just bought a piece of Black Yuan Gold at the Feng Yin Island auction.  Incorporating it into the Heavenly Corpse Coffin will significantly boost its defense, second only to that Golden Light Armor from back then. However, Black Yuan Gold is incredibly hard.  Even with the Nine Nether Demon Fire, I can only barely melt it, leaving me with no energy left for crafting.  It seems I'll have to wait until I return to Tian Xing Island. I recall Tian Xing Island has a top-tier alchemy workshop. I can leverage some power from the protective city array and draw upon the power of the underground fiery veins…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, already having a plan to upgrade the Heavenly Corpse Coffin.</p><p>He'd decided to return to Tian Xing Island.</p><p>The Dong Ming Island battle was thirty years ago; any major repercussions should have subsided.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect leader couldn't possibly remain stationed at Tian Xing Island indefinitely.  As long as he doesn't encounter a Yuan Ying master, even if he runs into Elder Lu, with Qin Sang's current strength, the outcome is far from certain.</p><p>The Demon Sea Uprising ended over twenty years ago.</p><p>As for what happened in the aftermath of the Demon Sea Uprising, and how the aggressive demons were repelled, Qin Sang, having remained hidden in this remote area, lacked accurate information.</p><p>Over two decades have passed; the Demon Sea should have largely returned to normal.</p><p>"A gentleman waits ten years for revenge. I wonder if you still remember Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.</p><p>He hadn't forgotten that he'd stolen a treasure coveted by the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch.</p><p>To avoid exposing his identity and attracting the attention of Yuan Ying cultivators, he only has one chance to act!</p>
