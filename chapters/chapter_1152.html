<h1>Chapter 1144: The Call of Thunder</h1><p>Endless void.</p><p>This place was unknown, shrouded in endless thunderclouds.</p><p>At the horizon, there was only a vast expanse of radiant light, with thunder surging like an ocean. Beyond that, nothing else could be seen.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix spread its wings, spanning thousands of feet, comparable to a mountain. Such a colossal creature was almost unimaginable, existing only in legends.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had truly witnessed the divine beast, the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>Facing the awe-inspiring might of heaven and earth, as well as the Azure Phoenix, even if it was just an illusion, Qin Sang's mind buzzed incessantly, and the world seemed to spin around him.</p><p>In this place, Qin Sang suddenly realized how insignificant he was. A single thundercloud contained enough thunderous power to reduce him to ashes in an instant.</p><p>This was the Thunder Marsh of Heaven and Earth, a forbidden land for all living beings!</p><p>Even shape-shifting demons or Nascent Soul ancestors would find it nearly impossible to move here.</p><p>Yet, the Azure Phoenix showed no fear, leisurely gliding through the thunderclouds, effortlessly weaving between them. Countless bolts of lightning continuously struck the Azure Phoenix, but not even a single feather was disturbed.</p><p>A faint blue light emanated from the Azure Phoenix's body.</p><p>When the lightning touched the blue light, it immediately became docile, then dissipated without a trace, leaving only ripples in its wake.</p><p>"What realm does the Azure Phoenix belong to? Could it be the legendary Heavenly Demon?"</p><p>Qin Sang was terrified.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix treated the heavenly thunder as if it were nothing, not even using its true essence, yet the lightning couldn't harm it in the slightest. Its cries carried a sense of ease.</p><p>Such power was terrifying, beyond imagination.</p><p>"Wait! It's absorbing the power of the thunderclouds!"</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang noticed something. The Azure Phoenix wasn't resisting the lightning; no wonder the thunderclouds couldn't harm it. The bolts of lightning were being actively drawn to it.</p><p>Whether resisting or absorbing the thunderclouds, both were unimaginable feats for ordinary beings.</p><p>"It's a Thunder Phoenix!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He guessed that the Azure Phoenix wandering through the thunderclouds in the illusion was likely the true form of the Azure Phoenix shadow sealed within the mysterious stone slab.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun had only caught a glimpse of it and hadn't seen its full form. When she crafted the Azure Phoenix puppet, she could only imagine its abilities, granting it the power to control fire.</p><p>The scene in the void was monotonous.</p><p>Constantly enveloped by thunder, Qin Sang couldn't clearly see the Azure Phoenix's expression. It seemed to be in a hurry, its gaze fixed ahead as it flew swiftly through one thundercloud after another.</p><p>The radiant light still lay far in the distance.</p><p>The endless thunderclouds seemed to stretch on forever.</p><p>After the initial shock, Qin Sang regained his composure and tried to break free from the illusion.</p><p>"Such a terrifying Azure Phoenix, no wonder it could leave a shadow that persists to this day. Was it just a shadow sealed within the mysterious stone slab? What exactly entered my body?"</p><p>He was worried about his own condition.</p><p>However, as soon as this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang suddenly felt a tearing pain, instantly pulling him out of the illusion.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Qin Sang let out a piercing scream.</p><p>This was a pain he had never experienced before. Even the agony he endured during his breakthrough with the infusion of star energy paled in comparison.</p><p>Every part of his body was in pain.</p><p>His flesh, meridians, bone marrow, and dantian were being torn apart by an unfamiliar force, as if searching for something, but it couldn't find anything.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he were about to be torn into countless pieces.</p><p>Even now, Qin Sang still didn't understand why this was happening.</p><p>But recalling the shadow of the Azure Phoenix, his visualization of the Heavenly Demon, and his cultivation of the "Heavenly Demon Refinement," which carried the aura of the Azure Phoenix, Qin Sang could vaguely guess something.</p><p>This force was extremely violent, carrying the aura of thunder, identical to the Azure Phoenix in the illusion.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun had first come into contact with the stone slab, which later fell into the hands of the Serpent Demon King.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingjun was human, while the Serpent Demon King was a shape-shifting snake demon. Neither had the bloodline of the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>In their hands, the mysterious stone slab had behaved normally. Activating it with true essence only caused the shadow of the Azure Phoenix to appear. Yet, the moment Qin Sang touched it, the shadow emerged, and the power of the Azure Phoenix invaded his body.</p><p>This was definitely no coincidence!</p><p>Waves of pain assaulted him. Qin Sang knew that if this continued, his fate would be dire!</p><p>"Heavenly Demon Refinement!"</p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>To undo the knot, one must tie it. Whether it would work or not, this was his only lifeline.</p><p>Enduring the immense pain, Qin Sang forced himself to focus and activated the technique.</p><p>In that instant, the power of the Azure Phoenix seemed to find two outlets, rushing madly toward the phoenix wings on Qin Sang's back.</p><p>These wings were formed by the Heavenly Demon Transformation technique, not physical entities, but they were so solid that they created an illusion. As the power surged into them, the wings shone brightly, making it hard to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Suddenly, cracks appeared on the wings.</p><p>Even the illusory wings couldn't withstand this power and were on the verge of destruction.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could catch his breath, he inwardly cursed and frantically activated the technique to reform the wings.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang made a new discovery.</p><p>After receiving the infusion of star energy, his body had reached its limit, just a step away from breaking through to the fourth layer. Now, after activating the technique, he faintly sensed signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>But time was not on his side.</p><p>The good times didn't last. The power of the Azure Phoenix was too violent and overwhelming.</p><p>Before he could comprehend the Heavenly Demon Form described in the technique, he could no longer endure the terrifying impact.</p><p>'Crack, crack...'</p><p>Cracks continued to appear.</p><p>The wings deformed and twisted, on the verge of exploding.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang's injuries were worsening.</p><p>"Am I going to die here?"</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but he immediately dismissed it, focusing all his energy on breaking through!</p><p>He would never give up his will to survive!</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly noticed a faint suction force in his dantian, absorbing the power of the Azure Phoenix.</p><p>"Heaven's Eye Butterfly!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed to discover that the one absorbing the Azure Phoenix's power was his life-bound insect, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly!</p><p>The divine beast Azure Phoenix and the spirit insect Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Two completely unrelated creatures. Why could the Heaven's Eye Butterfly absorb it?</p><p>"Thunder! That's it! The Thunder Control ability! It's the Thunder Control ability!"</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood.</p><p>This was the power of the Thunder Phoenix!</p><p>After a mutation, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had also gained the ability to control thunder. Although it had been of little use before, it now played a crucial role, acting as a catalyst.</p><p>It could also endure the power of the Thunder Phoenix, sharing the burden with its master, and benefiting in the process!</p><p>"After absorbing it, will it evolve or mutate?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>Soon, the suction force grew stronger. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly absorbed more and more of the Azure Phoenix's power, slightly alleviating Qin Sang's pain. The wings stabilized temporarily, giving him a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>He focused all his energy on the "Heavenly Demon Refinement," seeking a breakthrough.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the falcon demon's furious curses: "Are you insane? Run! You're courting death, but I'm not ready to die yet!"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was startled, his mind snapping back to reality.</p><p>The entire treasure vault was in chaos. The phenomena caused by the Azure Phoenix's shadow had already burst out of the vault!</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Finally, I've caught up.</p><p>It's the last day of the month.
