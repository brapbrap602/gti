<h1>Chapter 1777: High Ascendant Divine Empyrean Talisman</h1><p>Flying ships arrived one after another.</p><p>Thunderclap Left Prefecture disciples occupied the front, followed by the lower sect disciples. Qin Sang and the others stood outside the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around. There were only a dozen or so people beside him, all outer sect disciples like himself.</p><p>Over a thousand disciples had come to receive the talisman, yet only a handful of spots were given to outsiders, demonstrating the rarity of the High Ascendant Divine Empyrean Talisman.</p><p>The last flying ship descended.</p><p>The handsome young man who had brought Qin Sang here approached, clouds forming beneath his feet. He addressed Qin Sang and the others, "Follow me to the Bestowal Court."</p><p>A young man next to Qin Sang, unable to contain his curiosity, pointed to the vast队伍 ahead and asked, "Aren't they going?"</p><p>Qin Sang was also puzzled.</p><p>During the days he'd waited, the Thunderclap Left Prefecture had already organized all the disciples who had come to receive the talisman and tested their aptitudes.</p><p>He, because of the thunder talisman he held, was exempted from the test.</p><p>Could there be more trials?</p><p>The handsome young man glanced sideways and said, "They are disciples of the main sect and lower sects. They have to undergo another trial before receiving the talisman.  Although generally not too many are eliminated, if anyone thinks they can rest easy just by getting here, hehe..."</p><p>The handsome young man smiled meaningfully, "However, since you're not disciples of our sect, you don't have to undergo the trial. Just wait three days in the Bestowal Court."</p><p>Hearing this, the other young men visibly relaxed. Qin Sang understood; this trial was likely intended to observe the disciples' temperament, comprehension, and the like.</p><p>The handsome young man led the group, flying through the air.</p><p>The Thunderclap Left Prefecture disciples watched them pierce through the thunderclouds with complex expressions, many of them uneasy.</p><p>The waters surrounding the island were covered by thick thunderclouds.</p><p>Entering the thunderclouds, it was pitch black at first, then thunderclaps roared in their ears as silver serpents danced around them.</p><p>Having just embarked on the path of cultivation, they had never experienced such a scene. Their faces paled, eyes filled with alarm.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning shot straight towards them, instantly causing a flurry of cries.</p><p>"Don't be afraid."</p><p>The handsome young man calmly raised his hand, grasped the lightning, and played with it in his hand. The violent lightning became utterly docile.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the other young men felt a mix of fear, envy, and anticipation.  After receiving the High Ascendant Divine Empyrean Talisman, they too could possess such divine abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang saw it clearly.</p><p>The moment he caught the lightning, the handsome young man used a kind of thunder talisman. But he hadn't taken out a physical talisman, nor had he summoned an altar or drawn a talisman in the air. The talisman materialized with a mere thought.</p><p>As they spoke, the handsome young man flew higher and higher, countless thunderclaps exploding around them.</p><p>Then, a massive shadow appeared within the depths of the thunderclouds.  As they drew closer, they realized it was a magnificent hall.</p><p>This hall actually floated within the thunderclouds, enveloped by lightning. An invisible barrier seemed to exist around it, preventing the lightning from intruding.</p><p>The words ‘Bestowal Court’ were inscribed on the hall. A jade staircase extended downwards from the plaza in front of the hall, seemingly endless.</p><p>"We're here. Wait here and don't wander off."</p><p>The handsome young man set them down, then turned and flew back.</p><p>The group exchanged glances and found places to sit. Qin Sang calmly surveyed the surroundings and sat down in meditation.</p><p>Three days passed in a flash.</p><p>Starting from noon on the second day, people gradually climbed up the jade staircase, the numbers increasing steadily. As the handsome young man had said, over ninety percent of the disciples passed the trial.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The sound of bells and drums resonated throughout the heavens.</p><p>The main gate of the Bestowal Court opened, and a Daoist priest in a tall hat emerged.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang witnessed elaborate rituals unseen in the Three Suns Sect.  The Daoist priest spent half an hour just reading the ritual regulations before allowing everyone to enter the Bestowal Court.</p><p>Two rows of Thunderclap Left Prefecture disciples, holding banners and ceremonial objects, filed out, guiding everyone into the Bestowal Court.</p><p>The internal layout was similar to the Three Suns Sect.</p><p>A tall incense burner was placed in the vast plaza, smoke curling upwards.</p><p>As the smoke drifted out of the burner, it dissipated into nothingness. The disciples felt their minds become exceptionally clear; the burner clearly held a type of spiritual incense.</p><p>The difference lay in the inscription on the plaque of the main hall.</p><p>"Thunder Patriarch Hall!"</p><p>Seeing these three powerful, ancient characters, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly. He looked inside the hall.</p><p>The main gate of the Thunder Patriarch Hall was already open, revealing the scene within.</p><p>An altar stood in the center of the hall. Behind the altar, there was no statue, but a hanging divine image.</p><p>The image depicted a divine being, lofty and solemn, clearly the work of a master.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunderclap Universal Transformation Heavenly Venerable!</p><p>Qin Sang felt this divine image wasn't a magical treasure, but likely an ordinary painting. Yet, for some reason, gazing at this divine being, he unconsciously dismissed any frivolous thoughts, his expression turning serious.</p><p>‘Dang dang…’</p><p>The sound of chimes rang out. The courtyard fell silent, respectfully welcoming the three masters: the Conferring Master, the Supervising Master, and the Recommending Master.</p><p>There were also six Protecting Masters: the Protecting Dharma Master, the Protecting Scriptures Master, the Protecting Altar Master, the Protecting Precepts Master, and the Protecting Dao Master.</p><p>Offering incense, paying respects, invoking the divine, venerating the ancestors, performing the ritual, activating the altar...</p><p>Though not as meticulous as the Daoist sects, the entire process still took a full three hours.</p><p>The disciples receiving the talisman had just embarked on the path of cultivation, with no trace of magical power. Their backs and waists ached, but they dared not show the slightest negligence.</p><p>Before the final bestowal, they even had to perform repentance.</p><p>Repentance referred to communicating with the deities, confessing sins, and seeking forgiveness.</p><p>Led by the master, they chanted the "Heavenly Repentance Scripture." While others sincerely repented, Qin Sang sneered inwardly. He had been steeped in bloodshed throughout his cultivation. If the repentance scripture was true, how could the deities tolerate him?</p><p>Finally, the ritual reached the most crucial step—the bestowal of the talisman!</p><p>The Recommending Master stood before the Thunder Patriarch Hall, reciting the names of the disciples. The disciple whose name was called entered the hall to receive the talisman.</p><p>Naturally, the outer sect disciples were last. By the time it was Qin Sang's turn, only a few disciples remained in the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward quickly, bowed, and entered the hall.</p><p>The Conferring Master was a white-bearded elder with early Nascent Soul cultivation. He glanced at Qin Sang and then looked away.</p><p>Since Qin Sang wasn't a disciple of the Thunderclap Left Prefecture, the Conferring Master naturally wouldn't offer him any guidance. Without a word, he directly activated the altar.</p><p>Above the altar, a golden seal hung suspended.</p><p>A blank talisman materialized before Qin Sang. As his essence blood and divine sense fused into it, the seal was stamped, and the talisman split into two.</p><p>One part merged into Qin Sang's forehead, while the other, guided by the Conferring Master's hand, flew back to the altar and spontaneously combusted.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, the talisman burned to ashes, the flames extinguishing, informing the deities above.</p><p>Among cultivators, this step was vividly described as establishing a talismanic contract, from then on having a name registered in the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang knelt on a prayer mat, eyes closed, motionless, seemingly comprehending something.</p><p>If he were a core disciple of the Thunderclap Left Prefecture, after receiving the talisman, he would also need to receive the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts of the Daoist sect. Thunderclap Left Prefecture disciples usually chose three of the Nine Precepts, at least strictly observing them within the Orthodox Unity lineage.</p><p>This was the initial voyage into the teachings, the ladder to ascending the Dharma path, and required utmost caution.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't a core disciple, so he was spared those formalities.</p><p>The Conferring Master flicked his dust whisk, and the Recommending Master outside the hall called out the next name.</p><p>As if startled awake, Qin Sang lowered his head, rose, and retreated out of the hall.  As he exited, someone approached with a wooden tray.</p><p>Thunderclap Left Prefecture disciples would be bestowed with robes, magical instruments, and other items. For him, there was only a single jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them, picked up the jade slip, and was guided out of the Bestowal Court.</p><p>After all the bestowal rituals were completed, someone escorted Qin Sang and the other outer sect disciples back to the Welcoming Island.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to stay, immediately boarding a treasure ship and departing the Thunderclap Left Prefecture.</p><p>Standing at the stern, Qin Sang gazed at the receding Thunderclap Left Prefecture, a contemplative expression on his face.</p><p>The bestowal process had been smoother than expected. The Thunderclap Left Prefecture hadn't shown any suspicion towards him, and the altar hadn't reacted strangely to his cultivation level.</p><p>Not long after leaving the Thunderclap Left Prefecture, Qin Sang disembarked on a small island, rented a cave dwelling, and eagerly examined his talisman.</p><p>"High Ascendant Divine Empyrean Talisman!"</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his mind sinking into his Purple Mansion.</p><p>A golden talisman now shone within his Purple Mansion. Every time he sensed the golden talisman, Qin Sang felt a blood connection, as if it had become one with him!</p><p>This was the talisman he had received — the Supreme Orthodox Unity Boyhood Spirit Official General Talisman.</p><p>The talisman wasn't a physical object but an illusion, composed of incomprehensible runes, resembling a transparent spiritual talisman.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang needed to construct an altar.</p><p>Once the altar was complete, the talisman would manifest within it as a seal.</p><p>However, even before the altar was constructed, Qin Sang already felt a difference.</p><p>A few faint wisps of true essence returned to his empty Qi Sea. Qin Sang didn't suppress it with his divine sense, savoring the long-lost feeling of stabilized true essence.</p><p>Moreover, this true essence was derived from refining the world's spiritual energy. He didn't need any complicated procedures and could directly draw the world's spiritual energy into his body within a certain limit.  As it entered his body, it felt as if it had been purified, returning to normal.</p><p>He flipped his palm and took out a spiritual stone of this world, able to directly absorb its spiritual energy as well.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on comprehending the talisman.  A mysterious power seemed to protect him, isolating him from the chaotic forces between heaven and earth, shielding his true essence from external influences.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know where this mysterious power came from. When his mind delved into the talisman, he only felt a vast emptiness, as if reaching the nine heavens, yet also profoundly deep and heavy. This contradictory feeling left Qin Sang baffled.</p><p>He could only put his faith in the Daoist legends for now.</p><p>Of course, the talisman's protection was limited. If his true essence exceeded the Foundation Establishment stage, surpassing the limits of this talisman, the chaotic forces between heaven and earth would still affect it.</p><p>Generally, cultivators in this world, upon reaching the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, would receive a second-order talisman before attempting a breakthrough.</p><p>Otherwise, without the protection of a talisman, external influences would cause their true essence to go out of control. Even if they broke through, they would have to suppress their cultivation to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>After carefully pondering, Qin Sang didn't rush to construct the altar. He took out the jade slip received at the Thunderclap Left Prefecture and began to examine it.</p><p>The jade slip's contents consisted of three main parts.</p><p>First, were the various key points of altar construction.</p><p>It listed several spiritual materials suitable for constructing a golden seal altar, mostly thunder-attribute spiritual objects, with almost no mention of soldier and horse altars.</p><p>After all, outside the Daoist sects, most cultivators lacked the ability to raise soldiers and horses. Even among the direct disciples of the Thunderclap Left Prefecture, very few cultivated the soldier and horse altar.</p><p>Second, was a "Myriad Gods' Thunder Authority Celestial Guide."</p><p>The Celestial Guide depicted the holy images and divine names of various thunder deities, serving as a guide for invoking their presence.</p><p>Constructing the altar and inviting the deities were essential steps after receiving the talisman.</p><p>Banner-Holding Jade Maiden, Jade Light Boy, Thunder Light Jade Maiden, Thunder Master Boy, Hail Master Boy, Western Terrace Wind and Rain Official, Wind-Chasing Cloud-Spreading Official, Lightning-Wielding Thunder-Crashing Cloud-Rushing Messenger, Flying Cloud Messenger, Hail-Bringing Warrior, Evil-Subduing Warrior...</p><p>Holy images of one deity after another flowed through Qin Sang's sea of consciousness.</p><p>Looking through all the holy images, Qin Sang found that the Thunderclap Left Prefecture mostly venerated thunder deities, and the deities in the Celestial Guide were all jade maidens, boys, messengers, and warriors.</p><p>This was normal. Each level of talisman required invoking a deity of the corresponding rank. It was impossible to invite a guardian deity of a higher rank.</p><p>Even if one succeeded in invoking a higher-ranked deity, the altar likely couldn't withstand it, leading to an altar explosion.</p><p>In the "Myriad Gods' Thunder Authority Celestial Guide," most of the holy images were gray, with only three illuminated: the Purple Light Jade Maiden, the Wind-Chasing Cloud-Spreading Official, and the Water Thunder Lightning General.</p><p>This indicated that invoking these three deities was the easiest.</p><p>Invoking other deities might consume a significant amount of time and energy, ultimately failing to summon a guardian deity.</p><p>Invoking a deity wasn't guaranteed success, requiring prolonged visualization of the holy image, sensing the celestial heart, and the higher the deity's rank, the more difficult it became.</p><p>The entire Celestial Guide only highlighted three deities.  Qin Sang wondered if the Thunderclap Left Prefecture was hiding something.</p><p>He doubted the Thunderclap Left Prefecture had any reason to hide information.  It was likely that outsiders, not cultivating the Thunderclap Left Prefecture's techniques and therefore incompatible with the talisman, could only invoke these three deities.</p><p>Continuing to read, the third part was a Dharma incantation called the "Invoke Truth Jade Talisman Incantation."</p><p>This incantation was to be cultivated while invoking the guardian deity.</p><p>"Should I invoke a deity?"</p><p>Seeing that most of the jade slip's content pertained to deity invocation, Qin Sang held the jade slip, lost in thought.</p><p>He was curious whether deities truly existed.</p><p>Were guardian deities truly manifestations of divine will descending, or were they projections of the mind created by visualizing the deities' holy images?</p><p>If they were projections of the mind, why could some deities be invoked while others couldn't?</p><p>However, actively invoking a deity gave Qin Sang a sense of unease.</p><p>Ultimately, it was because of the Jade Buddha. The origin of these deities was unknown, and to protect the Jade Buddha's secret, Qin Sang instinctively resisted allowing external deities into his body.</p><p>In reality, invoking a deity wasn't mandatory. From what he had seen of the demon talisman on the serpent demon, Qin Sang knew one could also invoke one's inner truth as a guardian deity, also known as an inner deity.</p><p>As far as he knew, demon talismans all invoked inner truth, one of the key differences between demon talismans and Daoist talismans.</p><p>This also occurred among cultivators in the Ju Mountain Region.</p><p>Some sects' talismans, due to various reasons, received no response from their corresponding deities or any other deities, forcing them to invoke their inner truth.</p><p>But it was said that inner truth was less stable than deities. Cultivators who practiced such talismans faced a arduous and precarious cultivation path, resorting to it only out of necessity.</p><p>Possessing the Jade Buddha, he didn't need a guardian deity.  However, he still wanted to use the altar to protect the Sky Eye Butterfly and the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang decided to invoke his inner truth.</p><p>Perhaps, due to the Jade Buddha, the inner truth he invoked would be more stable than others'.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang skipped the "Myriad Gods' Thunder Authority Celestial Guide," memorized the "Invoke Truth Jade Talisman Incantation," withdrew his divine sense, and prepared to construct the altar.</p><p>Before constructing the altar, the first priority was to comprehend the talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the various methods he had gathered and focused his mind once more on the talisman.</p><p>Gradually, a talismanic form materialized in his mind.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
