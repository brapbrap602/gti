<h1>Chapter 1110: Nascent Soul Arrival</h1><p>“The Violet Palace and Seven Kills Hall seem to be the work of the same person!” Qin Sang paused, lost in thought.</p><p>“It seems these two places are connected by more than just a teleportation formation. There must be a deeper connection.  It's no wonder the Violet Palace held the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, while the Seven Kills Hall’s Celestial Tower sealed a sword intent of the same origin.  If that’s the case, could the Seven Kills Hall also hold the complete *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*?”</p><p>Qin Sang reconsidered, thinking that even if it existed, finding it would be extremely difficult.</p><p>The inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall opens only once every few centuries. This time, the interval was the shortest yet, still over a hundred years.</p><p>It was said that the inner hall was larger and more dangerous than the outer hall, and the time allowed for exploration was limited.</p><p>By his calculations, Senior Qing Zhu should have entered the inner hall twice. Judging by the notes he left on the Sword Path, he hadn’t found the subsequent cultivation techniques either.</p><p>“At lower realms, without sufficient cultivation or resources from powerful backers, talent determines everything. After reaching Nascent Soul, things shouldn't be as constrained as before.  The Great Dao is boundless, and there are countless possibilities in the cultivation world!  However, without the boost from the killing talismans, my cultivation path will undoubtedly be more arduous than those with greater talent. Fortunately, I already have two top-grade magical treasures as a foundation, so my strength isn't inferior.  I can use this to slowly search for solutions.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the inner hall, his eyes flickering. "If the Seven Kills Hall and the Violet Palace remain unchanged, after I form my Nascent Soul, I'll be able to freely travel between the two and thoroughly search the inner hall…"</p><p>Just then, a sharp whistling sound broke through the air, startling Qin Sang from his thoughts.</p><p>He turned to see a streak of light not far away, heading towards the entrance of the inner hall, just like him. The aura was powerful, belonging to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang became wary, restraining his own escaping light and flying discreetly.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator didn't even glance at him, quickly passing by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, more and more streaks of light flashed among the outer hall mountains, most heading straight for the inner hall entrance. Seeing this, Qin Sang hastened his pace.</p><p>Flying past the Celestial Tower, Qin Sang soon arrived at the edge of the Immortal Restriction, seeing the full view of the Seven Kills Hall palace.</p><p>The palace was dilapidated, with a collapsed corner.</p><p>The plaque was mottled, the ink peeling, worn and cracked in many places, exuding an ancient aura.</p><p>In front of the palace was a white jade plaza, large enough to accommodate several hundred people.</p><p>This wasn't the edge of the plaza. The abrupt break at the edge seemed to be cut off by the Immortal Restriction, leaving only a portion.</p><p>Surprisingly, the white jade on the plaza was intact and new, smooth as a mirror, clearly reflecting figures.</p><p>There were already dozens of people on the plaza.</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the edge of the plaza, hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.  As soon as he entered, he felt something strange, a faint wave sweeping over him.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and quickly inspected himself, checking the Corpse Puppet Pouch and the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings.  Finding nothing unusual, he calmed down.</p><p>Someone noticed Qin Sang and looked over.</p><p>Qin Sang’s strength wasn't outwardly apparent.  Without using his Demonic Transformation, he looked like an ordinary late-stage Core Formation cultivator.  Those who looked him over quickly lost interest.</p><p>This suited Qin Sang just fine.</p><p>He inconspicuously walked to the back of the crowd, standing in a corner of the plaza, his gaze sweeping over the entire area.</p><p>As he entered the plaza, more and more people arrived, and the number of cultivators gradually increased.</p><p>"This gathering represents a portion of humanity's peak power…" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Not to mention the Nascent Soul patriarchs, every Core Formation cultivator on the plaza was formidable.  Mid-stage Core Formation cultivators were in the minority.</p><p>However, considering the vastness of the Boundless Sea and the prosperity of humanity, it wasn't surprising to see so many experts.</p><p>"Spiritual Pearl!"  Qin Sang carefully observed the crowd and immediately spotted a familiar figure.</p><p>He noticed that the cultivators' positions were deliberate. It was easy to tell who belonged to which group, standing together and chatting amicably. There were also those who were clearly at odds, keeping a distance between them.</p><p>"With Spiritual Pearl at the head, that group must be righteous cultivators."</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the Nascent Soul cultivators. Some could be identified by their appearance and sect, while others wore plain Daoist robes, making it difficult to determine their affiliations.</p><p>The righteous Core Formation disciples all stood obediently behind their Nascent Soul elders, conversing with acquaintances.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Ning Wu Hui; she probably hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>“On the other side of the plaza, furthest from the righteous cultivators, must be the demonic cultivators.” Qin Sang shifted his gaze.  He noticed a figure standing at the front with their hands behind their back, silent.</p><p>The demonic Nascent Soul cultivators all stood behind this figure, not daring to disturb them.</p><p>Even just seeing their back, one could sense their extraordinary aura.</p><p>"Able to suppress all the demonic cultivators, this person is most likely the Demon Lord."  Qin Sang's gaze moved between Spiritual Pearl and the Demon Lord.</p><p>"I didn't expect the Demon Lord and Spiritual Pearl to personally come here. The Seven Kills Hall truly deserves its reputation as a sacred ground for humanity!" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Between the righteous and demonic factions were other groups of cultivators, a mixed bag, their numbers rivaling, or even exceeding, the other two, and their strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p>It seemed that there were quite a few factions who didn't want to be involved in the conflict between righteousness and demons.</p><p>As Qin Sang speculated about their identities, more cultivators arrived on the plaza.</p><p>Two cultivators stood beside Qin Sang.</p><p>One of them looked around curiously, finally realizing what was amiss. "Brother Shen, why aren't there any witch tribe cultivators on the plaza this time?  I remember the last time I came to the Seven Kills Hall, there were quite a few, even the Grand Witch Doctor came."</p><p>The other cultivator, surnamed Shen, chuckled. "They'd like to come in, but not if they value their lives! Brother Lu, you don't know, only human cultivators are allowed to enter the inner hall. If any witch tribe cultivators or transformed demons dare to step inside, they'll be immediately detected by the grand formation on the plaza. If they force their way in, they'll be killed on the spot!"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu was startled, quickly glancing around the plaza.</p><p>“Don’t bother looking, Brother Lu.  The grand formation here, even if it’s not an ancient Immortal Formation, must be left behind by a human grandmaster. It normally remains hidden, only revealing its power when triggered.  The Seven Kills Hall is our sacred ground precisely because of this. I heard they only opened the outer hall to the witch tribe before to foster an alliance in the Demonic Sea and share the pressure from the demonic beasts.  The inner hall is sealed by the Immortal Restriction, with only this one entrance. Even if they let the witch tribe in, they wouldn’t dare to do anything!”  Shen said decisively, his expression full of pride.</p><p>Overhearing this conversation, Qin Sang finally understood the nature of the wave he felt earlier.</p><p>White Crane, controlled by the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, was considered his spirit beast. Dumb Aunt and Bai also had his Heavenly Corpse Talismans and were considered his subordinates.</p><p>That was why he hadn't triggered the grand formation.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
