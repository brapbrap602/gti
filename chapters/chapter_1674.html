<h1>Chapter 1665: Strange Fragrance</h1><p>Death Seal, Heavenly Thunder, Magnetic Light.</p><p>Any one of these three attacks would likely kill an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator instantly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, a master of physical cultivation, is far less restricted by the Nine-Origin Earth Magnetic Divine Light than a spell cultivator. Many magical treasures and abilities are either unusable or easily deflected and weakened by the magnetic force.</p><p>His audacity in seizing the treasure while enduring the Death Seal and Heavenly Thunder stemmed from his unshakeable confidence in handling any situation.</p><p>However, he didn't anticipate a third party lurking, hidden so perfectly.</p><p>The combined assault, though his Lohan Golden Body was strong, proved too much.  The Lohan Golden Body shattered instantly.  Kun Dao, having patiently waited for this opportunity, seized the moment and struck!</p><p>Feeling the sticky blood on her palm, Kun Dao smiled.</p><p>In Kun Dao's eyes, Master Huaiyin's robust qi blood was even more alluring than a Nascent Soul cultivator's.</p><p>But her triumph was short-lived.  Her prey didn't succumb as expected, instantly dying and becoming a helpless victim.</p><p>By now, Kun Dao had channeled the Magnetic Light through Master Huaiyin's wound into his inner organs, preparing to detonate it and completely obliterate his vital organs.</p><p>"What fiend dares attack!"</p><p>A furious roar suddenly erupted.</p><p>The shout held a soul-stirring power.</p><p>It was the Heavenly Dragon Chant, an esoteric Buddhist secret, a thunderous chant capable of subduing enemies.  Cast by Master Huaiyin, empowered by his qi blood, its power was terrifying.</p><p>Those with weak minds would have their souls tremble and their hearts shatter.</p><p>Kun Dao stiffened slightly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, somehow, had turned, facing Kun Dao. His tongue chanted sutras, his eyes, blazing with Buddhist light, now ignited with furious killing intent.</p><p>At that moment, Master Huaiyin was enveloped in dazzling Buddhist light. The fragments of his shattered Lohan Golden Body didn't disperse but coalesced, reforming into a qi blood golden dragon, empowering him to unleash the Heavenly Dragon Chant.</p><p>The qi blood golden dragon merged with the chant, forming substantial sound waves.</p><p>Master Huaiyin himself was weak and dying.</p><p>His golden body shattered, his internal organs damaged, severely wounded,  using the Heavenly Dragon Chant in this state, further exhausting his qi blood, he was at his wit's end.</p><p>The chant couldn't subdue Kun Dao, only buying a brief respite.</p><p>In this state, Master Huaiyin's outstretched right hand remained unmoved, resolutely reaching for the fragment, while his left hand returned to his chest.</p><p>His fingers curled inwards, forming a hand seal.</p><p>Kun Dao shook off the chant's impact, seeing that Master Huaiyin still coveted the treasure, inwardly scoffing at his recklessness, preparing to kill him, when she felt her arm, plunged into Master Huaiyin's body, suddenly constricted.</p><p>An incredible force erupted from within Master Huaiyin, forcing all the Nine-Origin Earth Magnetic Divine Light back into her.</p><p>Kun Dao felt the Nine-Origin Earth Magnetic Divine Light compressed around her palm, unable to harm Master Huaiyin.  The force intensified, threatening to throw her away.</p><p>Even more shocking, Master Huaiyin, nearly dead, was bathed in a golden light emanating from the hand seal, his vitality visibly surging.</p><p>This golden light originated from Master Huaiyin's hand seal.</p><p>Wherever the golden light touched, it was as if misfortune turned to fortune.  Master Huaiyin's meridians resonated with rumbling thunder, his complexion improved, the qi blood golden dragon reformed, and the Lohan Golden Body reappeared!</p><p>In an instant, Master Huaiyin was nearly back to his peak. Except for the horrifying wound on his back, no one would guess that he had just been severely injured, nearly killed.</p><p>"Fiend, die!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin roared again.</p><p>This wasn't the Heavenly Dragon Chant, but his voice resonated with strength.</p><p>His Lohan Golden Body lowered its head, striking Kun Dao with a palm aimed at her forehead.  A golden dragon circled his Lohan arm; wherever it passed, concentric golden ripples formed, creating a tremendous storm, scattering the Magnetic Light, threatening to shatter the void.</p><p>Kun Dao was at the storm's center, her arm still embedded in Master Huaiyin's wound. If she didn't retreat, she would suffer the full force of the Lohan Golden Body's strike.</p><p>In less than a breath, the situation had drastically changed, leaving one dizzying.</p><p>Kun Dao's sneak attack nearly killed Master Huaiyin, yet the situation instantly reversed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were both astonished.  Astonished by the sudden, stealthy attack, and astonished by Master Huaiyin's formidable power.</p><p>The attacker's concealment was perfect, their timing impeccable, clearly a premeditated ambush.  They themselves might not have escaped.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine. If not for the fire jade centipede's warning, he would have been the target. Master Huaiyin had taken the blow for him.</p><p>A thought flashed, and his Heavenly Eye pierced through the Nine Yuan Magnetic Divine Light.  Qin Sang saw the attacker's attire, and his gaze was immediately drawn to something at her waist.</p><p>It was a fiery red jade pendant, its interior seeming to contain flowing magma, identical to the pendant in the Bingyi Palace tribulation vision. The fire jade centipede's reaction confirmed it was the pendant that attracted it.</p><p>"Crimson Immortal Pendant!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his eyes shining brightly, his mind awash with thoughts. Without hesitation, he cast the Thunder Sound and Soul Capture incantations again.  He'd planned this.</p><p>The attack was identical to the first, only the target was now the female cultivator.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, hailing from Xitu, had few enemies in Zhongzhou. The female cultivator's immediate attack showed her to be ruthless and bloodthirsty. She had been observing him repeatedly, clearly with malicious intent. Even without the Crimson Immortal Pendant, Qin Sang would not have shown mercy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang pondered the cultivator's origins. He'd never seen her since entering the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, nor was there any memory of her in the weeping spirit cave master's remnant soul.  However, her actions provided clues.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain she was behind the Xingge explosion and the emergence of the ancient cultivator's treasure.  She could use the divine prohibition for concealment and manipulate the Nine Yuan Magnetic Divine Light, but her control must be limited; otherwise, she wouldn't have needed such an elaborate scheme.  Direct control of the prohibition would have caused widespread panic.</p><p>"Is she an accomplice of Zhu Wu Dao?"  Qin Sang considered a possibility.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao had gathered a group of monsters, keeping a close eye on the weeping spirit cave master and others, guarding against betrayal – that was normal.  Furthermore, in the weeping spirit cave master's memories, Zhu Wu Dao mentioned many Wuxiang Immortal Sect descendants hiding in the shadows, some watching them, constantly hunted by other forces, living in fear, unable to reveal their identities.</p><p>Now that the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's遺府 had appeared, those forces were likely restless. These individuals, possessing treasures of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy, moving freely in the Di Shou Mountain, wasn't surprising.</p><p>Various thoughts raced through his mind, yet they did not affect his judgment or actions.</p><p>As he attacked, Qin Sang reversed his retreating movement.  His phoenix wings beat forcefully, leaving a black trail of fire in the void as he counterattacked.</p><p>As Qin Sang surged forward, Master Huaiyin, multitasking, reached into the pile of fragments with his other hand. Before the attack, he had intended to take all the treasures.  The Poison King would arrive soon after; even resisting an attack from Qin Sang and Su Zinan wouldn't leave him unscathed.  If the female cultivator’s belongings held information about Di Shou Mountain, it could be useful in dealing with the monster-faced man.  Although he'd obtained the even more valuable Xinjin Yuangjing, sufficient to replace the spiritual object he sought, his agreement with the Poison King remained, and his opportunity here was linked to the Poison King.  He couldn't simply break his promise.</p><p>Severely wounded, Master Huaiyin dared not be careless and had to make choices.</p><p>He gathered the golden light in his palm, taking only the Xinjin Yuangjing.  With a powerful tremor of his arm, he flung the other treasures far away to avoid further attacks.</p><p>Some treasures were destroyed in the explosion.  Few remained.  Among them were four swords: two long swords – one originally lying on the female cultivator's lap, presumably her sword – and two finger-sized swords, one gold and one jade.  The small swords lacked scabbards, their shape resembling sword talismans.  There was also a black jade box, sealed, its light flickering, apparently due to the intense impact.</p><p>Qin Sang, focused on the jade pendant at the female cultivator's waist, glanced at the treasures and did not change his target. However, Su Zinan, whose eyesight wasn't as sharp as the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's, and whose vision and perception were blocked by the Nine Yuan Magnetic Divine Light surrounding Master Huaiyin, could only see a blurry figure of the female cultivator. He hadn't yet noticed the pendant.</p><p>While he was uncertain, seeing the treasures flung away by Master Huaiyin, his expression shifted. Su Zinan's figure flickered, he too lunged forward, gathering the remaining power of the Death Seal, aiming for the female cultivator.  His thoughts mirrored Qin Sang's: the female cultivator’s origins were unclear; she was a valuable prize, best captured alive.</p><p>However, Su Zinan was more adept at seizing opportunities, appearing to be after the treasures.  He was always enveloped in a faint mist, a manifestation of the two main spirit energies of the magic banner, countering the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism. As long as the main spirits didn't leave his body, he wouldn't be discovered. Even the Sky-Eye Butterfly didn't notice it, mistaking it for a protective treasure.</p><p>For a moment, the four forces converged, and a chaotic battle was about to begin.  The heavenly thunder struck again.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instinctively defended, unexpectedly finding that it was directly targeting Kun Dao.  He couldn't figure out why Qin Sang was helping, so he didn't think about it too much. His golden Arhat palm struck down, forming a thick golden gale.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Kun Dao was locked by the heavenly thunder and the Buddha's palm, appearing exceptionally vulnerable. The celestial dragon chant and soul-seizing incantation followed in quick succession, further shaking her spirit.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang summoned the Sun God Tree.  Within the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism's divine light, the Sun God Bird was easily thrown off course. He had to wait to close the distance before making his move.</p><p>Although it sounds complicated, Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin reacted extremely quickly, leaving Kun Dao almost no opening.  It seemed Kun Dao was about to be fatally injured.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang saw Kun Dao retract her arm, spread her limbs wide, close her eyes, and open her mouth, letting out a heart-wrenching scream. The shriek was so piercing that even through the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism, Qin Sang felt as if needles were piercing his eardrums.</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>The Poison King was approaching, vaguely hearing the woman's shriek, his expression extremely serious.  Master Huaiyin's two angry shouts, coupled with this shriek, indicated an unforeseen change.  The Poison King had confidence in Master Huaiyin's strength, but these sounds made him uneasy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't good at dealing with the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism, falling behind.</p><p>Thinking of this, the Poison King didn't hesitate. He flicked his sleeve, muttered an incantation, and extended his index finger.  A black line flew out of his sleeve. The Poison King's finger brushed against one end of the black line, creating a black demonic wind that pierced through the layers of Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism, rushing towards the battlefield first.</p><p>The Poison King's gaze was heavy, his speed slowed considerably as he remotely controlled his insect gu through his mind.</p><p>Hearing the scream, Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding. He then saw the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism's divine light around Kun Dao frantically converging, forming a yellow-black pillar of light that shot upwards, directly confronting the giant palm of the golden Arhat.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kun Dao acted hastily, unable to perfect it. The protective Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism divine light became thin, unable to withstand the heavenly thunder and the death seal.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Amidst the thunderclap, the giant palm was obstructed.  The heavenly thunder and the death seal pierced through the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism, striking Kun Dao almost simultaneously.</p><p>Surprisingly, Kun Dao didn't die instantly from these two attacks.  Her injuries were much lighter than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>An unknown greyish mist appeared on Kun Dao's body. This mist was chaotic in form, incongruous with the Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism divine light.</p><p>Amidst Kun Dao's screams, the mist swelled wildly.  Simultaneously, the space around her began to tremble, becoming extremely unstable. The surrounding Nine Yuan Earth Magnetism divine light shattered. Master Huaiyin's gaze turned serious; he sensed danger.</p><p>His recovery technique was already difficult to maintain and wouldn't last long. He had already intended to retreat after obtaining the Xinjin Yuan Crystal. Seeing Kun Dao repelled, he made a decisive decision and withdrew.</p><p>Kun Dao's shoulder suffered from the lightning strike, her skin torn and bleeding, with the blood vaporized by the lightning. Her chest was hit by the death seal; a clear 'death' character was imprinted on her body, and her vital essence was drawn towards the seal by an unknown force.</p><p>But none of this was fatal; the mist seemed to have blocked most of the power.  As the space and divine prohibition fluctuated, Kun Dao's figure became increasingly illusory.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang understood immediately: Kun Dao was escaping!  But to his disappointment, Master Huaiyin chose to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm, the Sun God Tree reappeared, slowly rotating in his palm. The three divine birds on it were about to take flight.</p><p>However, Kun Dao moved faster.  The mist, like a vast ocean, surged from an unknown space. Wherever it passed, the void cracked, revealing fissures.</p><p>All three knew this wasn't a void fissure, but gaps in the divine prohibition. The other side of the fissure should be the exit, the one they had been desperately searching for, yet none of the three wanted to go in.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The fissures spread rapidly, soon encircling Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Su Zinan finally saw Kun Dao's face clearly, his eyes widening: "Fire Rhinoceros!"</p><p>He finally understood why Qin Sang had decisively attacked Kun Dao – he was attracted by this treasure.  Without hesitation, he charged towards Kun Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan advanced, but Master Huaiyin did the opposite, retreating repeatedly without any hesitation.</p><p>At that moment, a strange hissing wind came from afar. A demonic wind rushed over, with thin black lines faintly visible within it.</p><p>The Poison King had finally arrived!</p><p>Master Huaiyin's mind relaxed, he hurriedly charged towards the demonic wind, seeing the Poison King following behind.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Seeing Master Huaiyin's wounds, the Poison King was shocked.</p><p>Master Huaiyin let out a soft sigh, his breath labored, and sighed, "I'm afraid I can no longer accompany you, my friend."</p>
