<h1>Chapter 1716: The Demonic Clan War</h1><p>Somewhere in the East Sea.</p><p>The tranquil sea surface warped strangely, inexplicably sinking inward. The water cascaded down, forming a circular pit surrounded on all sides.</p><p>Yet, from the pit's center, a steady stream of water gushed forth like a surging spring, bubbling and flowing.  Its highest point even rose above the sea level.</p><p>Sunlight reflected on the water, constantly revealing glimpses of lush green jungles within, as if a dry, waterless world existed within the depths of the pit—a mirage-like spectacle.</p><p>This peculiar place was known as a sacred ground by the East Sea’s Demonic Clans, called the Water Ripple Sacred Ground.</p><p>The entrance to the Water Ripple Sacred Ground was the central water flow. Leaping down from its highest point, if unimpeded, one could directly enter the sacred ground's interior.</p><p>Ever since its discovery, due to the precious treasures produced within, the Water Ripple Sacred Ground had always been claimed, though ownership frequently changed hands.</p><p>Naturally, restrictions and guardians were also abundant here.</p><p>Currently, the master of the Water Ripple Sacred Ground was the Azure Fox Holy King, and the guardians were all demon soldiers from the Holy King's Palace.</p><p>Just like the shimmering reflections on the surface, the interior of the Water Ripple Sacred Ground was a vast expanse of land covered in dense forests. Looking up from within the forest, one could see the azure dome formed by the seawater, making it seem like an island submerged beneath the ocean.</p><p>The jungle was dense.</p><p>No man-made structures or figures could be found within the forest. The guardians stayed at the jungle's edge, not daring to cross the boundary.</p><p>Strangely, whether it was day or night outside, a faint blue light consistently filtered down, unchanging in brightness.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A bright light shone from the waterway.</p><p>The guards raised their weapons, expressions grim. Then, a silver, circular scale drifted in.</p><p>The commander, a transformed Great Demon, lifted his webbed hand to catch the scale. White light surged from his palm, enveloping it. After a moment, his expression softened, and he waved his arm behind him, personally opening the waterway.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>The water flow parted to both sides.</p><p>A handsome young man flew in. Layers of scales grew on his neck, and his exposed hands were also covered in fine scales.</p><p>The young man was clearly acquainted with the commander. They nodded to each other in greeting.</p><p>Noticing the question in the young man’s eyes, the commander nodded and transmitted his voice, reminding him: “The Child God Great Saint and the White Withered Great Saint are both within the sacred ground. You may go and pay your respects.”</p><p>The young man seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. He cupped his hands and hurried away.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before entering the forest, a majestic voice questioned him, "What's the rush?"</p><p>The young man stopped abruptly at the edge of the jungle and bowed from afar. Holding up an object with both hands, he spoke in a solemn tone, "Reporting to Great Saint, there's a confidential message!"</p><p>In his palms, a point of red light floated, transforming into a red fish at times, and a scroll at others, constantly shifting.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The red light flew into the jungle on its own.</p><p>The young man stood where he was, not daring to move.</p><p>Within the forest.</p><p>Two figures sat cross-legged on either side of a pool.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize both of them instantly, having clashed with them before.</p><p>One was the Green Furred Rat Demon, who had once disguised himself as a man in green armor and infiltrated the Six Provinces Hall Treasure Exchange, known in the Demonic Clan as the Child God Great Saint.</p><p>The other was the Lord of White Withered Mountain, the White Withered Great Saint.</p><p>Both demons were powerful generals under the Azure Fox Holy King. Now, while conflicts raged outside, they both guarded this pool, seemingly waiting for something within it to emerge.</p><p>The Child God Great Saint no longer wore the armor that masked his demonic aura. He had changed into a suit of heavy armor, covered in dark, intricate patterns. Judging by the纹路, it was a bone armor.</p><p>He stared at the pool, calculating with his fingers, "Once these Water Ripple Essences mature, and this King obtains half, the required amount will be met. Then, relinquishing the Water Ripple Sacred Ground will be of no consequence."</p><p>Water Ripple Crystals were the most precious treasures of the Water Ripple Sacred Ground, immensely beneficial to demonic cultivation. However, the East Sea’s Demonic Clans still hadn't uncovered the origins of the Water Ripple Crystals; they were only found within this sacred ground.</p><p>"It's rare that those fellows aren't vying for them.  Along with the Holy King's previous rewards, this King has nearly gathered enough," the White Withered Great Saint chuckled.</p><p>Years ago, he had let the Fire Demon escape, failing to complete the Holy King's command. He had remained apprehensive, fearing the Azure Fox Holy King's wrath.</p><p>Only in recent years had his jovial mood returned.</p><p>The Child God Great Saint snorted, "That Black Lion is eyeing Li Han Stream. The Li Water Bright Sand produced there is, in terms of value alone, even greater than the Water Ripple Crystals!"</p><p>"With the situation in such disarray, minor details shouldn't be our concern.  Before those major clans discern the true state of the Holy King's Palace, quickly gathering treasures is the priority. Once these treasured lands fall back into their hands, it won't be so easy for us to snatch them from the tiger's mouth…"</p><p>As the White Withered Great Saint spoke, he glanced sideways, and the red fish flew through the dense forest, landing in his hand.</p><p>The Child God Great Saint restrained himself slightly, ceasing his argument.</p><p>The White Withered Great Saint commanded the demon kings of White Withered Mountain. Though not comparable to the major clans, it was still a considerable force. After the deaths of his two sworn brothers, his own power was inferior to the White Withered Great Saint's.</p><p>Since even the other party thought so, he couldn't be too arrogant.</p><p>He glanced at the White Withered Great Saint opposite him and was surprised to find the latter frowning after reading the confidential message.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>The Child God Great Saint inquired.</p><p>"Rebellious movements…" The White Withered Great Saint's expression was peculiar as he tossed the red fish to the Child God Great Saint.</p><p>This was a message sent by a spy within the Dragon Whale Clan. Planting spies within the Dragon Whale Clan was incredibly difficult. Only exceptionally trustworthy and crucial information would be relayed outwards, risking exposure.</p><p>After reading the message, the Child God Great Saint's face also changed.</p><p>"They dare to launch a full-scale attack so soon?  That Dragon Whale has gone mad!"</p><p>Wars in the cultivation world were rarely swift, often stretching for hundreds, even thousands of years.</p><p>Though the Dragon Whale Great Saint had long harbored rebellious intentions, he was currently still in the probing stage. Other clans leaned towards the Dragon Whale Great Saint, but fearing the Azure Fox Holy King, most remained on the sidelines.</p><p>The demons of the Holy King's Palace were keenly aware of this, patiently maneuvering while secretly plundering resources.</p><p>Yet, unexpected complications arose.</p><p>Something unusual must be afoot!</p><p>The White Withered Great Saint pondered, "That old cunning Dragon Whale might have some secret method, having already discovered something. Otherwise, even with his arrogance, the old geezers of the other clans, with their cunning minds, wouldn't gamble everything. The Holy King's annihilation of the entire Water Monkey Clan still holds sway!"</p><p>"Send word to Black Lion, prepare quickly. With movements from the various clans, there will likely be signs soon. No matter what, before the Water Ripple Crystals mature, we absolutely cannot show weakness…"</p><p>The Child God Great Saint rose and paced by the pool, then suddenly said, "Do you think the Holy King is still in this realm?  I wonder what treasures she obtained from the Unfounded Palace and the Formless Immortal Sect, or perhaps that old monk whispered some slander, leading to her decision to ascend in less than a century."</p><p>"The Holy King always means what she says; you know her temperament, don't you? Soon after the hunt for the culprit, the Holy King withdrew from worldly affairs. I've sent subordinates to Sweet Dew Zen Monastery several times with messages, but there's been no response. Since she clearly stated that we should fend for ourselves, even if the Holy King's Palace is razed to the ground, she will absolutely not intervene."</p><p>The White Withered Great Saint shook his head, holding no hope.</p><p>In fact, over the years, a considerable number of powerful factions had gathered under the Azure Fox Holy King's banner. Even without her, the Holy King's Palace remained a top power in the East Sea.</p><p>But the Azure Fox Holy King had always acted on whims, having killed and plundered from every major demon clan.</p><p>Once there was no Soul Formation expert to hold the fort, the East Sea clans would surely destroy the Holy King's Palace to vent their hatred.</p><p>Two fists couldn't fight against four hands, and with the Dragon Whale Clan on the opposing side, no demon king would be willing to perish alongside the Holy King's Palace. Chaos had just begun, and they were already seeking their own escape routes.</p><p>The two demons discussed for a while longer, leaving trusted subordinates to guard the Water Ripple Sacred Ground, then departed separately.</p><p>…</p><p>Since Qin Sang's appearance, the East Sea had been fraught with trouble.</p><p>Several great battles had erupted among the East Sea’s Demonic Clans. The Dragon Whale Great Saint had gained the upper hand, while the Holy King's Palace, unable to resist, retreated step by step, losing all its former glory.</p><p>A vast expanse of the sea.</p><p>Beneath the surface, a school of tens of millions of needlefish chased the ocean currents. Looking down from the surface, it resembled a colossal creature swimming beneath the waves.</p><p>This was a common fish in the East Sea, typically attracting no attention.</p><p>Amidst the school, a needlefish, indistinguishable from the others, was carried along by its kin. Yet, its eyes held a spark of intelligence not found in the others, mixed with anxiety.  Still, it dared not make any unusual movements, obediently following the school.</p><p>Behind the school, thousands of miles away.</p><p>A mass of dark clouds, carrying demonic winds, disrupted the tranquility of the sea, pressing forward.</p><p>A closer look revealed that the dark clouds were actually composed of numerous demonic beasts: shrimp soldiers and crab generals, fish and turtle warriors, and various other bizarre creatures. Though a motley crew, their formation was relatively orderly.</p><p>Most striking was a group of pure white, winged demonic beasts resembling celestial horses. With their robust figures and imposing aura, they stood out from the disorganized horde. These were the renowned Four-Winged Divine Steeds, a powerful clan of the East Sea.</p><p>Upon a flying chariot sat two middle-aged men in white robes, bearing striking resemblances to each other.</p><p>“Elder Brother, why not let our men capture that scout?”</p><p>The man seated lower frowned and asked.</p><p>The other, holding a jade fan and wearing an imperial crown, smiled upon hearing this, “Let him return to report the news. Let them believe that our Divine Steed Clan is being coerced by Dragon Whale, intentionally slowing our advance.”</p><p>His younger brother suddenly understood, "Elder Brother wants that Dragon Whale to test the Holy King's Palace's strength first?"</p><p>“Precisely,” the crowned man gently waved his jade fan, “Now, our clans are moving together, dividing into five routes, and have already surrounded the Holy King's Palace army. If the Azure Fox Holy King doesn't appear, they face annihilation, and the Holy King's Palace will fall. This battle will determine whether the Holy King is still here or not!"</p><p>His younger brother agreed, “I didn't expect that Dragon Whale would be willing to pay such a hefty price to utilize his clan's Sacred Bone! If the Azure Fox Holy King has truly ascended, our victory is assured. If the Holy King intervenes, Dragon Whale can rely on the Sacred Bone to contend with her, and we can immediately retreat to our ancestral lands in time.  However…”</p><p>He hesitated slightly, a wary glint in his eyes, "The Azure Fox Holy King is capricious.  She once eradicated the entire Water Monkey Clan simply because their tribute of spiritual wine was insufficient…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the crowned man interrupted, “Back then, we didn’t know the Holy King’s nature.  Our clans weren't united, failing to advance and retreat together, allowing her to exploit the situation. Now, every clan has suffered under the Holy King’s Palace’s tyranny, deprived of their share of treasures from the sacred grounds. They harbor resentment and have long suffered under the Holy King’s Palace. Were it not for this, how could Dragon Whale’s call to arms attract so many followers?  Then, united and supporting each other, with our ancestral lands as our backing, we won’t fear the Azure Fox Holy King's retaliation. At worst, we'll endure humiliation again. She can’t remain in this realm forever, can she?”</p><p>His younger brother nodded, “Elder Brother is right. Even if we retreat, being able to seize the treasures within the sacred ground will make this campaign worthwhile.”</p><p>As they spoke, the demon army crossed vast stretches of the sea.</p><p>During their advance, information from various sources converged.</p><p>As time passed, the smiles on their faces grew wider.</p><p>The fastest, the Dragon Whale Great Saint, had almost caught up to the enemy army, while the Holy King's Palace army continued to contract, hesitant to engage in a decisive battle. It didn't look like the Holy King was present at all.</p><p>Of course, it could also be a ploy to lure them in deeper.</p><p>But the Dragon Whale Great Saint was bearing the brunt of it, so what did it have to do with them?</p><p>…</p><p>Though the sky was clear, with the sun high above, this stretch of sea was incredibly gloomy, filled with a chilling aura.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Turbulent waves churned in the sea.</p><p>Hurricanes swept across the heavens and earth, and demonic aura filled the sky.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint stood atop a whale shark’s back, his arms thick with muscle. His right hand gripped a chain connected to an iron cage.</p><p>The black cloth covering the cage was pulled back, revealing a blood-soaked bone radiating an intense crimson light, conspicuous on the battlefield, exuding a terrifying, ferocious aura.</p><p>Ninety-nine dragon whales swayed around him, their blood surging, resembling blood whales, letting out mournful roars, ready to detonate their bodies and merge with the Sacred Bone at any moment.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint’s eyes were wide, fixed on the area ahead.</p><p>He could already see the tail end of the Holy King’s Palace army. According to the agreement, the encirclement and annihilation should commence in a stick of incense's time.</p><p>The Holy King's Palace army, backed by the Holy King's Palace, even without the Holy King present, was not to be underestimated. The Dragon Whale Clan alone couldn't annihilate them.</p><p>However, the news from other sources indicated that, except for his own trusted forces, the other armies had slowed down for various reasons.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint sneered; he knew exactly what those fellows were thinking.</p><p>However, his confidence in launching this decisive battle didn't stem from these allies, but from a single person!</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint glanced sideways, seeing a figure standing on the back of a dragon whale nearby.</p><p>This person hadn’t been there a moment ago, appearing suddenly.</p><p>Clad in a Daoist robe, with an otherworldly demeanor, this person stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a stark contrast to the battlefield, merely a few feet behind him.</p><p>Yet, aside from the Dragon Whale Great Saint, none of the demon kings in the entire army had noticed his presence.</p><p>Even the Dragon Whale Great Saint only sensed him after he drew near, thanks to the Sacred Bone.</p><p>Though the Dragon Whale Great Saint had deliberately left a path for him within the demonic formation, this person’s ability to appear and disappear so mysteriously still startled him. He secretly thought that after years of reckless actions, that vixen had finally met her match.</p><p>“What guidance does the True Monarch have?”</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint bowed his head slightly, asking softly.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and said, "This humble Daoist has traveled around discreetly and hasn't sensed the Azure Fox Holy King's aura. Fellow Daoist can proceed with hunting down the Holy King's Palace army without worry. This humble Daoist will assist you in breaking their battle formation."</p><p>"If the Azure Fox Holy King appears on the battlefield, how much confidence does the True Monarch have in slaying her?"</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint was quite ambitious.  If he had to pay a steep price and use the sacred object, he wouldn't be satisfied with merely seizing the Holy King's Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head without elaborating, his eyes flickering for a moment before his figure vanished abruptly.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Great Saint drew the attention of all parties. While he explored in secret, all signs indicated that the Azure Fox Holy King was likely gone, at least not in the East Sea.</p><p>He intended to use this demonic clan war to confirm his suspicions, ideally overthrowing the Holy King's Palace and plundering its treasury.</p>
