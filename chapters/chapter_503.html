<h1>Chapter 496: Removing the Gu</h1><p>After eliminating Priest Jiupao, Qin Sang immediately returned to the Earth Sinkhole. The Feitian Yecha's condition was worsening; the cracks on its Core were not healing and were, in fact, spreading.</p><p>The Earthly Yin Qi he'd collected in the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle was merely a drop in the bucket. He had to return to the Earth Sinkhole as soon as possible.</p><p>With Priest Jiupao and the four Demonic Flame Envoys dead, the Demonic Flame Sect was practically extinct. There were still some remnants of the Kuiyin Sect within its ranks, and Qin Sang initially wanted to raid their mountain gate, but there wasn't time.</p><p>Reaching the Earth Sinkhole with the utmost speed, Qin Sang summoned the Feitian Yecha.</p><p>The Feitian Yecha's Qi was in disarray. Its external injuries had mostly healed, but its body was withered, almost mummified. The wound on its dantian hadn't fully recovered either. Wisps of Corpse Qi continuously leaked out, its Qi Sea nearing depletion. Its Corpse Core was pale and cracked.</p><p>Priest Jiupao couldn't unleash the true might of a Core Formation cultivator, and the Feitian Yecha was also not comparable to a genuine Feitian Yecha.  The outcome of the battle was already quite favorable. Qin Sang had been prepared for the Feitian Yecha to be completely crippled.</p><p>"Finally back," Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>His divine sense swept over the Feitian Yecha, confirming that its injuries weren't irreversible. Only then did he truly relax.</p><p>Placing several restrictions on the Feitian Yecha to seal its Qi, Qin Sang directed it to jump into the Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Core Formation cultivators from Mount Shaohua rarely came to such a barren place. As a precaution, Qin Sang had the Feitian Yecha descend as deep as possible.</p><p>Reaching the Feitian Yecha's limit, Qin Sang found a protruding rock face and had it sit in meditation, bathed in the Earthly Yin Qi to heal.</p><p>The Feitian Yecha had to absorb and refine the Earthly Yin Qi itself to recover. Qin Sang couldn't do much.</p><p>This would take time, and Qin Sang couldn't stay there indefinitely.  Uncertain, he remained in the Earth Sinkhole for three days, observing whether the Feitian Yecha could withstand the erosion of the Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>During these three days, Qin Sang also took care of another matter: removing the Heart-Eating Worm Gu from his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He'd known the method to remove the Gu for a long time.  However, with Priest Jiupao and the others still alive, he'd kept it as a potential bargaining chip.</p><p>Now, with only insignificant remnants of the Kuiyin Sect left, such elaborate schemes were unnecessary.</p><p>The Heart-Eating Worm Gu had been with Qin Sang for decades, ever since he left the Kuiyin Sect. From the initial anxiety it caused, feeling like a poisonous needle constantly pricking him, to later being used as bait to lure and kill Kuiyin Sect remnants, it had witnessed his growth.</p><p>Although he was no longer threatened by the Gu, Qin Sang felt a sense of relief after its removal. He was rid of not only the poisonous Gu, but also the dark memories of his time in the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>The Heart-Eating Worm detached from Qin Sang's Nascent Soul and flew out of his Nascent Soul space, instantly losing its vitality. Its worm-like body stiffened and floated before him.</p><p>Two fangs protruded from its mouthparts, gleaming coldly, appearing fierce and eerie.</p><p>Then, the Heart-Eating Worm suddenly began to disintegrate from its head, eventually turning to dust.</p><p>It was originally a corpse, manipulated by the Gu technique and refined into a Gu worm. Each Heart-Eating Worm corpse could only withstand the Gu technique once. Once the technique was undone, it vanished completely.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The Feitian Yecha was safe.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Earth Sinkhole alone, preparing to find a suitable place for his Core Formation preparations.</p><p>He didn't return to his sect, nor to Dragon View Temple.  The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were too crucial. He wasn't entirely trusting of his fellow disciples and planned to reveal himself only after refining the spirit herbs.</p><p>The best place for secluded cultivation was naturally the Spirit Eye Cave, where the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid grew.</p><p>To maintain its secrecy, Qin Sang hadn't opened it since returning from Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>The sky was clear.</p><p>Riding on a cloud, Qin Sang didn't head directly to the cave. Instead, he took a detour and landed on a deserted island, the same one where they had gathered before their journey to the Heavenly Corpse Cave.</p><p>The island was unchanged.</p><p>The birds' nest was long abandoned.</p><p>Of the eight who set out, only Qin Sang remained.</p><p>Before leaving the Chaotic Islands, Qin Sang had left a message for Li Yufu, instructing him to leave a communication talisman on the island if he had any news about Wanderer Yun.</p><p>He still had a Purple Star Secret Decree. The opening of the Purple Star Palace wasn't far off. If Wanderer Yun didn't need it, he'd better sell it quickly.</p><p>After so many years without any news, Qin Sang had given up hope.  Unexpectedly, upon landing on the island, he discovered a spirit array.</p><p>The array was intricately designed but served no other purpose than to contain a deliberately left trace of blood Qi. Qin Sang was certain it belonged to Wanderer Yun.</p><p>Had Wanderer Yun returned?</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang touched the spirit array, and the blood Qi within exploded with a 'bang'.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Qin Sang considered for a moment and then concealed himself.</p><p>He trusted Wanderer Yun, but he was wary of any unforeseen circumstances or manipulation.</p><p>Soon, two familiar streaks of light flew from the horizon.</p><p>One was Li Yufu's.</p><p>The other was the unique light of the Flawless Pearl!</p><p>"Disciple greets Senior Uncle!" Li Yufu bowed to Qin Sang. He was still at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, but after years of experience on the battlefield with Qin Sang, his demeanor had changed significantly.</p><p>"Brother Qin!" Seeing Qin Sang, Wanderer Yun landed and strode over, laughing heartily. "I saw your message from Yufu and brought him here. I've been waiting for you."</p><p>Qin Sang apologized, "I've been busy with a trivial matter recently..."</p><p>"No worries, I knew you must have important matters to attend to. I haven't been idle either. I was looking for an old friend and also guiding Yufu's cultivation..."</p><p>Wanderer Yun waved his hand, signaling Li Yufu to stand guard outside. He looked Qin Sang over and said seriously, "Brother, you're still at the Pseudo Core Formation stage. Haven't attempted Core Formation yet?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Core Formation is a difficult hurdle. I'm not confident."</p><p>"It's a pity I can't help you with that." Wanderer Yun sighed softly and encouraged Qin Sang, "Brother, you obtained the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower. Those are the best spirit herbs for aiding Core Formation that can be found in the Small Cold Realm today. You'll definitely succeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that news of him acquiring the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower must have spread throughout the Small Cold Realm. It wasn't surprising that Wanderer Yun knew.</p><p>Speaking of Core Formation, Qin Sang quickly asked, "Senior, have you recovered from your soul injuries after searching for heavenly treasures all these years? I recently obtained two Purple Star Secret Decrees. Do you still need one?"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the two decrees for Wanderer Yun to see.</p><p>"Purple Star Secret Decrees? So many!" Wanderer Yun was astonished. He then unhesitatingly took one and put it away.</p><p>"Haha... Of course I need one! You've gone through so much trouble, Brother Qin! If I hadn't brought you good news, I wouldn't have the nerve to accept this."</p>
