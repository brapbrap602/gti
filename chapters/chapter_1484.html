<h1></h1><p>"What if the treasure isn’t in its original location? How will I find it?"  </p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the contents of the jade slip.  </p><p>As expected, the restrictions around the Body Cleansing Pool were not static. Each lineage guarded their secrets closely, making it impossible to fully understand all the patterns of the restrictions. More often than not, he would have to rely on his ability to adapt on the spot.  </p><p>He was worried that the restrictions inside the Body Cleansing Pool might also change, causing the treasure to shift to another location.  </p><p>Additionally, his forceful intrusion into the depths of the pool might trigger unpredictable changes.  </p><p>Back then, Bing Yao’s strength had been insufficient, and she knew little about the situation at the bottom of the Body Cleansing Pool. Based solely on the information in the jade slip, Qin Sang couldn’t make an accurate judgment.  </p><p>His cultivation method was different from that of Liuli and her master, so he couldn’t sense the fluctuations of the treasure.  </p><p>The Frost Soul Divine Light sealed by Liuli in the spirit talisman was lifeless and could only be used to pry the treasure loose.  </p><p>The space at the bottom of the Body Cleansing Pool wasn’t large, but it was filled with ancient restrictions.  </p><p>Once the time was up, the Body Cleansing Pool would automatically close and generate a repelling force. Even with the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang wouldn’t be able to search every inch of it.  </p><p>"There shouldn’t be anything else at the bottom of the Body Cleansing Pool…"  </p><p>Liuli furrowed her brows slightly, pondering for a moment before revealing another secret.  </p><p>"My master once sensed a familiar fluctuation at the bottom of the Body Cleansing Pool, which was strikingly similar to that of another forbidden area in the Holy Land—the Gluttonous Lake. She suspected that the restrictions between the two places were connected.  </p><p>"However, even if the two places are linked, it would require a high level of cultivation to influence the Body Cleansing Pool from the outside.  </p><p>"My master originally planned to wait until her strength was sufficient, then coordinate with a disciple entering the Body Cleansing Pool to work from both inside and outside to obtain this treasure. Unfortunately, shortly after leaving the Holy Land, my master departed from the Profound Heaven Palace and never had the chance to return.  </p><p>"When the time comes, I will simultaneously enter the Gluttonous Lake and trigger the restrictions at the bottom of the lake. But my cultivation is insufficient, so I’m afraid I won’t be of much help to you."  </p><p>Speaking of her master, a trace of sadness flickered in Liuli’s expression. She briefly explained, "My master once said that with the help of this treasure, the perfected Frost Soul Divine Light could be further refined, bringing about a wondrous transformation. Originally, this treasure could have been used to save my master, but now it’s no longer needed. For me, the more important thing is that refining this treasure could give me another chance to break through my bottleneck."  </p><p>Liuli had already considered the possibility of failing to break through and had prepared a backup plan. She was confident that she could persuade Qin Sang with the opportunity to enter the Body Cleansing Pool.  </p><p>As long as they could overcome this hurdle, the issue of the demonic technique’s imprint could be resolved gradually.  </p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, thinking to himself that this was the reason.  </p><p>Looking at Liuli, Qin Sang was reminded of himself.  </p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally realized a commonality between him and Liuli.  </p><p>Though their convictions and choices differed, they shared similar experiences.  </p><p>Qin Sang had also been plagued by the hidden dangers of a demonic technique, persistently seeking a solution and never giving up, eventually making it to where he was today.  </p><p>Now, Liuli was the same.  </p><p>Only by taking one step at a time and overcoming each obstacle would they eventually see the light.  </p><p>"Whether it works or not, it’s always good to have an extra layer of preparation," Qin Sang said, immediately discussing the details of the plan with Liuli.  </p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang and Liuli left the cave together, heading toward the main peak.  </p><p>Shi Xue was in the main hall, absentmindedly handling mundane affairs. When she saw the two figures appear at the door, she immediately put down the jade slip in her hand and stood up, asking repeatedly, "Have you two reached an agreement?"  </p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli nodded in unison.  </p><p>Shi Xue looked back and forth between the two, a smile appearing at the corner of her mouth. "Truly a match made in heaven! Alright, enough joking. I’ll draft a letter and have it sent to Lingxiao Peak and the other lineages. Given the current turmoil with the demon beasts at the border, we’ll skip the usual formalities. We’ll ask Hall Master Jiang to choose an auspicious date, and on the day of the wedding, we’ll invite all the lineages to witness the ceremony…"  </p><p>She also understood that Qin Sang and Liuli were putting on a show and weren’t truly becoming cultivation partners.  </p><p>All the usual betrothal and engagement rituals could be skipped, keeping everything simple.  </p><p>However, some necessary ceremonies still had to be performed.  </p><p>Liuli was the closed-door disciple of the previous master of the Listening Snow Pavilion and the junior sister of the current master. The ceremony had to be grand to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the Listening Snow Pavilion lineage.  </p><p>In essence, cultivators weren’t much different from mortals in this regard.  </p><p>Shi Xue already had a plan in mind, and the disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion would handle the laborious tasks, sparing Qin Sang and Liuli the trouble.  </p><p>As Shi Xue rambled on, Qin Sang felt a sense of unreality. Since dedicating himself to the path of immortality, he had never imagined he would one day have a wedding, and such a complicated one at that.  </p><p>Given his temperament, even if he were to sincerely form a cultivation partnership with a fellow cultivator, he wouldn’t go to such lengths. At most, he would set up a memorial tablet in his cave, pay respects to his parents from his past life, and find some solace in that.  </p><p>Shi Xue, however, was very enthusiastic about the matter, growing more excited as she went through each detail. Suddenly, she remembered something. "I almost forgot. Before the ceremony, you two must first go to Lingxiao Peak to pay your respects to the Palace Master and the Grand Elder. Especially since the Daoist wasn’t originally a disciple of the Profound Heaven Palace, this ritual cannot be skipped. The sooner, the better."  </p><p>A look of concern flashed across her face. "The Palace Master’s insight is unparalleled. Are you confident you can deceive him?"  </p><p>When cultivators form a partnership, it must be based on shared ideals and harmonious Dao rhythms. It’s not like mortals, where a wedding ceremony makes them husband and wife.  </p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance. "It should be fine."  </p><p>"That’s good."  </p><p>Shi Xue didn’t press further, choosing to trust them. "Wait here for a moment. I’ll write a letter for you to take to the Yuanji Hall and deliver to Hall Master Jiang. The Daoist should also meet Elder Jiang."  </p><p>Next, Shi Xue struck an ancient bell, summoning disciples from all peaks to publicly announce Qin Sang’s status as a guest elder and the joyous news.  </p><p>As the bell rang, figures flew out from each peak.  </p><p>The entire Listening Snow Pavilion, including two Nascent Soul cultivators who had just returned from the battlefield and were recuperating in the mountains, gradually gathered at the main peak.  </p><p>While Qin Sang and Liuli waited in the main hall, Liuli gazed in the direction of Lingxiao Peak, hesitating for a moment before sending a voice transmission. "Be careful of the Palace Master."  </p><p>"Hmm?"  </p><p>Qin Sang’s expression suddenly stiffened, and he stared intently at Liuli, his gaze scrutinizing.  </p><p>Liuli remained silent for a moment before saying, "Before leaving, my master warned me. She said that every time she faced the Palace Master, she felt an inexplicable sense of unease. Back then, shortly after leaving the Holy Land, my master left the Profound Heaven Palace alone. During her travels, she encountered a great opportunity, discovered the Frost Soul Essence, and quickly broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage. Yet, instead of returning to the Profound Heaven Palace, she crossed the storm belt and went to the North Star Realm. When trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, my master also forbade me from seeking help from the Palace Master."  </p><p>"The reason?"  </p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely.  </p><p>Liuli’s eyes showed a trace of confusion. "Perhaps even my master wasn’t sure. It was just a feeling. Cultivating the Frost Soul Divine Light makes one’s spiritual senses sharper than most. She only said that if I ever returned to the sect and the Palace Master was still alive, I should stay as far away from him as possible and avoid being alone with him."  </p><p>Qin Sang frowned deeply, lost in thought for a long time before looking up and asking, "I’ve heard that Yin Changsheng is from the era before the Chaos Demon Elder."  </p><p>"Yes," Liuli nodded.  </p><p>---  </p><p>---  </p><p>Last night, an urgent matter came up, and I was so busy that I didn’t finish until noon.  </p><p>I wrote the请假条 (leave note) but was interrupted by a phone call. When I checked later, I realized I forgot to post it. My apologies.  </p><p>I’ll make up for it with this chapter. I’ll grab a bite to eat and then get back to writing.</p>
