<h1>Chapter 1288: Rout</h1><p>Chapter 1288: Rout</p><p>“Elder Ye’s entire army has fled?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was full of astonishment, finding it hard to believe.  Back at Bingjing Palace, after much deliberation, everyone had rejected several plans that, while potentially effective, carried significant risks.  They had ultimately chosen the safest option.</p><p>Everyone understood that completely annihilating the Zu Yuan forces was impossible.  The plan was to steadily push Elder Ye and his men back to their stronghold, leveraging their superior strength to maintain a period of peace.  The Tianxing Alliance had suffered heavy losses in recent years and could not afford any more mistakes. Reclaiming lost territory and recuperating were the urgent priorities for all factions within the Alliance.</p><p>Xiaohan region boasted numerous talented cultivators and a vibrant atmosphere; time was on their side. They were reluctant to take unnecessary risks and make a wrong step. Yuan Ying cultivators never considered short-term gains.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun didn’t dare hope to break through Shuangjing Mountain in one battle. They planned to wait until Qing Jun fully understood the changes in Shuangjing Mountain's formation before launching a general attack.</p><p>They never expected that Zhenyi Daoist would achieve such a stunning victory in a single battle.</p><p>“The Daoist only sent a brief message, and the details are still unclear. It seems that after learning that Grandmaster Canghong was at the outer camp of Wangdong City, he correctly predicted that Zu Yuan would send urgent reinforcements to both locations after the incident. He secretly left Daoists Xiang Qing and others behind, preventing them from appearing. Instead, they lay in ambush along the Zu Yuan’s inevitable route.  Unexpectedly, they ambushed Elder Ye, engaging in fierce fighting until the Daoist arrived. After a fierce battle, Elder Ye spat blood in public, causing chaos among the Zu Yuan troops.  It seems that Single Song and the others were traveling with Elder Ye, but he sent them to Shuangjing Mountain, allowing the Daoist to seize this opportunity.”</p><p>Jing Lin was ecstatic.  The Tianxing Alliance had been suppressed by the aggressive Zu Yuan forces for far too long; this was an unprecedented victory.</p><p>“Even with the Daoist personally involved, forcing Elder Ye to retreat wouldn't be easy, right? Daoist Xiang and the others engaging Elder Ye must have been extremely dangerous. How are they injured?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked repeatedly, imagining the intensity of the battle. Elder Ye, known as the number one expert in Beichen Region, was no ordinary figure.</p><p>Jing Lin's joy subsided. He hesitated, “The Daoist didn’t mention it in the message; it seems the losses were acceptable.  By the way, the Daoist specifically thanked you, Qin Daoist, in his letter. Elder Ye's self-destruction of his incarnation resulted in far more severe injuries than we anticipated!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless. He never expected the aftermath of the Blood Pond battle to yield such unexpected results.</p><p>Zhenyi Daoist was truly cunning. He publicly made his deployment at Bingjing Palace, yet secretly left Xiang Qing and others to set an ambush; even Qin Sang and Qing Jun were kept in the dark.</p><p>The two sides had been fighting for many years; mutual infiltration was quite normal.</p><p>Thinking back, perhaps Zhenyi Daoist had sent everyone he suspected to assist Qin Sang and Qing Jun? Thankfully, everyone around Qin Sang when she exchanged identities with Lady Luo was trustworthy.</p><p>“What does Daoist Leng say?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts turned, realizing the value of this news. The fall of a large camp, and such a disastrous rout, would certainly cause unrest among the Zu Yuan forces.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Shuangjing Mountain had already received the news!</p><p>Qin Sang raised her head, a cold gleam in her eyes, her gaze like a sword, piercing through the formation, seeming to see the panicked enemy.</p><p>…</p><p>Shuangjing Mountain.</p><p>After the battle, Fairy Qiu Zhi began planning the retreat, arranging troops, and ordering a count of the supplies in the warehouse, categorizing them.  Anything that could be carried away would be, and the rest would be destroyed as much as possible.</p><p>Just as everyone on Shuangjing Mountain was bustling about, an urgent report arrived, like a bucket of ice water poured over their heads.  Everyone felt a chill.</p><p>In the main hall.</p><p>Qiu Zhi and others had grim expressions, silent, the atmosphere suffocatingly heavy.</p><p>“Elder Ye was personally present; how could there be a defeat…”</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Song muttered, unable to accept the reality.</p><p>“Alright, it's done.  There's no point in saying more. I've gathered you all to discuss what we should do next!”</p><p>Fairy Qiu Zhi said coldly. When she first received the news, her reaction was the same as the cultivator surnamed Song's, suspecting it to be a false report. After confirmation, she immediately realized that Shuangjing Mountain was in grave danger!</p><p>Before she finished speaking, urgent alarms suddenly sounded from the camp.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Wangdong City.</p><p>This was a giant city second only to Tianxing City in the Tianxing Alliance; it was also a formidable fortress with strong defenses.</p><p>The east wall of Wangdong City was built on a cliff, sheer and inaccessible.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance forces east of Wangdong City, whose mountain gates had been destroyed by the Zu Yuan, had all gathered here.</p><p>They had their backs against Tianxing City, with no escape route.  </p><p>As the saying goes, a desperate army fights best. The Tianxing Alliance cultivators fought to the death. Since the Zuyuan forces began their offensive, Wangdong City had remained impregnable, never once breached. </p><p>Countless shimmering, intricate protective formations filled the sky above the city, forming a dazzling, dome-like barrier.</p><p>The city walls were reinforced with dense arrays of protective enchantments, thick layers of glacial ice fused to the stone, making them incredibly strong.</p><p>The hundred-zhang-wide walls were now teeming with people.</p><p>Outside the city, a vast, dark mass of Zuyuan soldiers could be seen, clearly visible among them were tall, glowing crystal towers, each carried aloft by groups of low-level cultivators.</p><p>The light from the towers combined with the glow of spells and magical artifacts, forming a chaotic assault aimed at Wangdong City.</p><p>A fierce battle raged.</p><p>Wangdong City, a truly exceptional fortress, endured a relentless barrage of attacks. While the city's protective barrier and walls shook, they showed no signs of damage, boosting the defenders’ morale.</p><p>Unlike the other two fronts, here the Zuyuan forces were besieging the city, while the Two-Realm Alliance remained entrenched within their defenses.</p><p>However, this battle had been raging for a long time, the tide having already turned once.</p><p>High above the battlefield.</p><p>Lord Canghong glared at Wangdong City, his anger evident.</p><p>Persuaded by Elder Ye, he had decided to retreat.</p><p>He had received reports from the other two camps, learning of the Two-Realm Alliance's deployment. Consequently, when Lord Tongyou and Lord Dongyang attacked, he didn't take them seriously, instead focusing on preparing for the retreat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Lord Tongyou's assault was a feint. Only upon receiving the urgent report of Elder Ye's camp being overrun and his army routed did Lord Canghong realize they had fallen into a trap!</p><p>The Two-Realm Alliance had shown incredible audacity in drawing troops away from Wangdong City.</p><p>If this city, standing strong for millennia, fell into Zuyuan hands, they could easily hold it, threatening the heartland of the Tianxing Alliance and eliminating the need to retreat.</p><p>The vulnerability of Wangdong City presented a golden opportunity, yet Lord Canghong had been deceived by Lord Tongyou, failing to see through the ruse, leading to a grave mistake.</p><p>This wasn't entirely Lord Canghong's fault, however.  Ultimately, the problem stemmed from their blind faith in Elder Ye, the number one cultivator in Beichen.  Elder Ye not only possessed immense power but was also known for his exceptional strategy – and yet, he had fallen into a trap.</p><p>Even the loss of Shuangjing Mountain wouldn't have shocked Lord Canghong as much.</p><p>Earlier, Lord Canghong had noticed something was amiss with Elder Ye, but he hadn't anticipated the extent of his injuries.</p><p>Now, their only chance to turn the tide was to capture Wangdong City!</p>
