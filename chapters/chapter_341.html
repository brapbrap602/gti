<h1>Chapter 334: Reunion with an Old Friend</h1><p>Chapter 334: Reunion with an Old Friend</p><p>Tan Hao desperately tried to escape, but the disparity in cultivation was too great. The masked man easily caught up.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A powerful gust of wind struck from behind, as swift as thunder.</p><p>Tan Hao's heart pounded.  He didn't dare stop, hastily throwing a shield-like magical artifact behind him.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A sharp metallic sound.</p><p>The masked man's flying sword easily knocked the shield away.  Pausing only momentarily, the sword flashed again, continuing the pursuit.</p><p>One magical artifact after another was thrown out, all either knocked away or destroyed.  The distance between them not only failed to widen, but instead grew shorter.</p><p>“Keep running, let's see how far you can go…”</p><p>The masked man's mocking voice echoed in Tan Hao's ears, close at hand.</p><p>Deceived by Tan Hao and having wasted so much time, the masked man's anger was hard to contain. With the mentality of a cat toying with a mouse, he intended to thoroughly tease Tan Hao to relieve his frustration.</p><p>A fierce look flashed across Tan Hao's face. His escape technique abruptly stopped, then he spun around, his palm swiftly releasing a stack of talismans.</p><p>A loud dragon's roar resounded.</p><p>These talismans contained identical incantations. After shattering, more than a dozen ice dragons, formed from ice crystals, appeared out of thin air, roaring angrily towards the heavens.</p><p>Roaring fiercely, they attacked the masked man, their claws and teeth bared.  They formed a dragon formation, jointly assaulting the masked man.</p><p>The masked man, still quite composed and prepared, deftly weaved through the ice dragons. His flying sword circled him, slashing out sharp sword energy, each strike precisely targeting the dragons' weak points.</p><p>Explosions and desperate roars echoed as one ice dragon after another was decapitated, their bodies disintegrating into a flurry of ice shards, scattering like a snowfall.</p><p>The scene was quite beautiful.</p><p>However, Tan Hao had no time to appreciate the view. His final resort was easily countered by the masked man, who wasn't even slightly injured.</p><p>This was the gap between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages.</p><p>Lacking powerful magical artifacts and talismans, and without mysterious and unpredictable techniques and incantations, he couldn't bridge this gap.</p><p>Tan Hao ceased his futile struggle. He looked towards the southwest, his gaze seemingly penetrating the boundless swamp, towards his cave and the only family member waiting within.</p><p>The Jing Shen Dan had been purchased, but it would never reach its destination.</p><p>From the moment he decided to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield at the Qi Condensation stage, Tan Hao had anticipated this day.</p><p>Without reaching Foundation Establishment, life in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was a constant struggle for survival.</p><p>Over the years, thanks to the mask's help, he had several times narrowly escaped death, surviving the perilous Ancient Immortal Battlefield. But the mask wasn't a panacea; this day had finally come.</p><p>His eyes held not much despair, but rather a sense of resignation and relief.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed softly, murmuring, “Xiao Jie, big brother is going ahead of you, to scout the path ahead…”</p><p>He held a dagger in his right hand, a means of self-destruction.</p><p>The cultivation world was rife with torturous methods, some resembling the most brutal human punishments, the very thought making one's blood run cold. He could clearly sense the masked man's hatred; he would rather die by suicide than fall into his hands!</p><p>Otherwise, he would suffer a living death!</p><p>Tan Hao had long accepted this.</p><p>Just as Tan Hao was about to raise his arm, a sudden, piercing scream came from the swirling ice shards ahead.</p><p>The scream was from the masked man!</p><p>Tan Hao froze, a look of astonishment on his face. He knew his talismans were incapable of eliciting such a sound from the masked man, unless…</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>A small, slender, emerald green flying sword, stained with blood, flew out from the ice shards.</p><p>The warm blood froze upon contact with the ice, turning into crimson ice shards.  The flying sword then nimbly reversed its course.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A nearby ancient tree trembled violently.</p><p>The flying sword, impaling a body, was firmly embedded in the tree trunk.</p><p>The corpse was covered in a thin layer of ice, but two bright red sword wounds remained visible on the chest.</p><p>The masked man's eyes were wide open, unable to close, reflecting his terror and panic. Clearly, he hadn't even had time to react to the surprise attack before being struck down by the flying sword.</p><p>This was the first supernatural ability of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*: the power of shadowless movement.</p><p>The masked man, feeling completely safe and toying with Tan Hao, never expected a third party to appear.  He was caught unawares by the ebony sword, and killed instantly.</p><p>Against opponents of the same cultivation level, opportunities to use the ebony sword for a close-range sneak attack are rare. But against lower-level cultivators, this ability is incredibly effective!</p><p>There was no need for talismans or the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The ebony sword disdainfully tossed the masked man's corpse into the mud, then the sword energy wrapped around the corpse's storage pouch, flying back to its owner.</p><p>The decaying mud quickly swallowed and corroded the masked man, leaving no trace.</p><p>At this moment, a figure emerged from behind an ancient tree.  They sheathed their sword, caught the storage pouch, glanced at it with disappointment, shook their head, and put it away before looking towards Tan Hao.</p><p>The situation had dramatically shifted from near-certain death to the masked man's sudden demise. Tan Hao immediately understood that he had stumbled into a double-cross.</p><p>Tan Hao's expression was one of disbelief and uncertainty. He couldn't determine whether this turn of events was good or bad.</p><p>The person who could so easily kill the masked man must be even stronger.  Both the masked man and this mysterious person could easily kill him. However, unlike the masked man, this person hadn't killed him outright, suggesting a possible chance of survival.</p><p>Feeling the person's gaze through the cloak, Tan Hao's heart pounded. He quickly presented his own storage pouch, bowing deeply, "Thank you, senior, for saving my life. I have nothing to repay you with except my meager possessions. I hope you won't disdain them."</p><p>For a long time, the storage pouch remained untouched.</p><p>The mysterious person stood motionless, showing no intention of killing.</p><p>This made Tan Hao incredibly anxious.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Tan Hao, pondering for a moment before finally removing their cloak, revealing their face.  "Tan Hao," they said, "Long time no see. Do you remember your old friend?"</p><p>Tan Hao was startled, lifting his head sharply to see Qin Sang's face.</p><p>His eyes showed initial confusion, then a wave of recognition as distant memories were awakened; Qin Sang's appearance hadn't changed much in decades.</p><p>"You… Qin…"</p><p>Tan Hao pointed at Qin Sang, utterly astonished.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sighing slightly, "Decades have passed since we last met. I never expected to see you again today.  How have you been, Tan?"</p>
