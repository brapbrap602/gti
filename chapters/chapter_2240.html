<h1>Chapter 2231: Dire News</h1><p>In a mountain cave.</p><p>Three figures emerged from a distortion in the air—Qin Sang and two others.</p><p>“We’ve lost those golden eagles…”</p><p>Qing Hong glanced outside, carefully setting down Miss Shuang, then turned to Qin Sang, her tone surprised.</p><p>“Those poison pills… were made by you, Junior Brother?”</p><p>After their location was exposed, Qin Sang anticipated more golden eagles might be drawn to them.  Knowing the two women would be no match, he preemptively laid a poison array in the river using the pills.</p><p>The spirit tool pouches of this era are small.  Master Tongshen kept many spirit herbs in a mountain treasury;  Qin Sang, while retrieving herbs, secretly took some higher-grade ones to make the poison pills, acting with foresight.</p><p>Both poison and arrays can kill enemies of higher levels.  Qin Sang's poison array was especially refined; Qing Hong didn't even realize it existed.</p><p>The river water turned venomous, instantly killing the golden eagle leader.  This terrified the others, preventing them from entering the river, allowing Qin Sang and the others to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang attributed it to luck, saying he accidentally created poison pills while making spirit pills, unaware of their potent lethality, enough to kill even a near-transfigured golden eagle leader.</p><p>Qing Hong exclaimed, “No wonder Master praised you so highly! Junior Brother, you truly are a prodigy! I thought we were all going to die, but thanks to you, we escaped.  My sister and Miss Shuang owe you a great debt.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Sister Qingfeng,” said Miss Shuang, her voice weak from her injuries and the healing pill she’d just taken.</p><p>Qing Hong feigned displeasure, “I rescued Miss Shuang from the enemy, shouldn't she thank me first?”</p><p>Miss Shuang blushed, “Thank you, Senior Sister Qing Hong.”</p><p>Qing Hong continued, “Saving someone's life is a big debt!  I'm his senior sister; him saving me is natural.  But Miss Shuang… will you, as in those storybooks, repay my junior brother by… marrying him?”</p><p>Miss Shuang, never having been teased like this before, blushed crimson, like a sunset sky.  She quickly lowered her head, almost burying her face in her chest.</p><p>Qing Hong, realizing she'd gone too far, pinched Qin Sang's arm playfully, laughing,  “Miss Shuang, don’t be afraid. My junior brother is still a child, he doesn’t understand such things, he won't force you.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, batting away her hand, “Senior Sister, please don't joke. We aren't safe yet. If the golden eagles' elders come after us, my poison pills won't work on them.”</p><p>“Dense!  Insensitive!”</p><p>Qing Hong glared at him, “Miss Shuang's injuries should be stable now. Let's continue.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Miss Shuang softly responded.</p><p>The three left the cave. Miss Shuang kept her head down, avoiding Qin Sang's gaze, causing Qing Hong to secretly chuckle.</p><p>Following Senior Brother Qing Yan’s map, they pressed on.</p><p>Fortunately, they encountered no pursuers.  Traveling day and night, they finally reached their destination.</p><p>The location Senior Brother Qing Yan chose was a hidden treasure— nestled in the woods, surrounded by towering mountains and lush greenery, almost as beautiful as Yuanjing Mountain.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Their flight landed. Qing Hong surveyed the surroundings, highly satisfied. “Senior Brother has excellent taste!”</p><p>She sensed a spirit array here, one passed down from their Master, likely set up by her brother.</p><p>With a flick of her sleeve, a shimmering water surface appeared like a mirror, reflecting their images before shattering to reveal a forest scene.</p><p>Senior Brother Qing Yan had been tasked with finding a new estate, but hadn't expected to use it so soon.  It was still in its original, unrefined state.</p><p>This didn’t deter Qing Hong and the others. She used simple spells to gather stones and wood, quickly constructing several buildings.</p><p>“The mountaintop will have the Ancestral Hall and Master’s private quarters…  oh, and perhaps a private room for Senior Lu! Below, rooms for the four of us, guest rooms and a welcoming pavilion. Master and Senior Lu enjoy drinking, so we’ll need a wine cellar.”</p><p>The junior disciple's alchemy skills are so impressive, we absolutely must build him a top-quality furnace. Let's put it on the back mountain…"</p><p>Qinghong bustled about, surveying the terrain, inspecting the spiritual veins, and planning the layout of the mountain gate, muttering to himself.</p><p>Qin Sang and Miss Shuang watched silently from the side, unable to interject.</p><p>"Master hasn't arrived yet.  We may not stay here long, all this effort will be wasted.  Shijie, why don't you start by carving out a few quiet rooms for Miss Shuang to recover?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Miss Shuang beside him. Since leaving the cave, she had been subtly avoiding his gaze. Now, she deliberately turned her head, staring intently at the foot of the mountain, as if captivated by something there.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, Qin Sang noticed a blush rising on Miss Shuang's ears.</p><p>The girl, though seemingly cold and aloof, was surprisingly shy.  Qinghong's earlier remark had only been a joke.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly, stretching and taking a deep breath. The fresh scent of plants mingled with two faint, maidenly fragrances, filling his nostrils.</p><p>With Master paving the way in cultivation, lacking nothing materially, with the sect shielding them from hardship, his days consisted of focused cultivation, occasionally teasing a young lady.  The atmosphere within the sect was truly excellent, a stark contrast to his time at Shao Hua Mountain. His youthful spirit was gone, and with it, that particular mindset.</p><p>Sadly, neither reality nor illusion allowed him peace of mind.</p><p>"How do you know Master won't stay long?"</p><p>Qinghong, his train of thought interrupted, was quite displeased, retorting, "I underestimated you.  Small but shrewd, quite the caring one, aren't you!"</p><p>Unintentional words, yet meaningful to the listener.  Miss Shuang's ears turned completely crimson.</p><p>Qinghong looked suspiciously at the two of them, snorted, and casually built a few quiet rooms.</p><p>The three of them entered their respective rooms to cultivate and wait for their Master.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang awoke from meditation, sensing the activation of the mountain's protective formation.  Rushing out of his room, he saw his Master and senior brother flying in from beyond the mountain, followed by several other figures.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Qinghong went to meet them.  Master and senior brother both looked exhausted, as did those behind them.</p><p>Master Tong Shen nodded slightly, turning to address the group, "The mountain is humble, our hospitality is lacking. Please forgive us.  Everyone, please choose a suitable spot to carve out your own cave dwelling and rest as soon as possible."</p><p>"Master, you are too kind!"</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>"We won't stand on ceremony…"</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone repeatedly bowed their hands, dispersing into the mountain to create their own caves, leaving only an elderly man with white hair behind.</p><p>"Master Zhou, please!"</p><p>Master Tong Shen gestured with a hand, then said to Qinghong, "Let's talk inside."</p><p>Fortunately, Qinghong had already constructed a large hall.  Everyone entered in succession.  They heard Master Tong Shen instruct, "This place is too close to Ling Kong Mountain; we can't stay long! Three days from now, once everyone has fully recovered, we will set off for Yongtu Immortal City."</p><p>Qinghong asked, "Master, what is Yongtu Immortal City? And where is Elder Lu? Why didn't he return with you?"</p><p>"Elder Lu…"</p><p>Master Tong Shen's expression fell, turning to Miss Shuang, "Shuangluo, this is something your master left for you."</p><p>He produced a crystal-clear ring.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered; he recognized the ring.  He had seen it on Mr. Lu before—it was his dimensional storage ring.</p><p>Miss Shuang understood what it meant. Her body trembled slightly in disbelief, unable to reach for it.</p><p>"Elder Lu was the first to discover some clues about the Golden Eagle tribe and gave us timely warning, allowing us to escape this calamity. However, while investigating, he unfortunately fell at the hands of a powerful Golden Eagle warrior. Before he left, perhaps sensing his fate, he entrusted this ring to me, instructing me to give it to you if anything happened to him…"</p><p>Master Tong Shen sighed, gently placing the ring in Miss Shuang's hand.  "Elder Lu and I were close friends for hundreds of years. You are his only disciple; I will naturally take care of you.  Consider Qingyan and the others your siblings. I will treat you the same as them.  Elder Lu's spirit will always protect you."</p><p>The man surnamed Zhou added, "Miss Shuangluo, please accept our condolences! We also owe Elder Lu a debt.  If you ever need anything, just let us know; we will do what we can!"</p><p>Shuangluo clutched the ring tightly.  Unlike most, she did not wail or cry out in grief, only letting two lines of clear tears fall, yet conveying immense sorrow. Without a word, she suddenly turned and ran out of the hall.</p><p>"What a cruel fate, Frost!"</p><p>Qinghong wept along with her.  Frost had already lost her master, and now her senior master was gone too. Qinghong, heartbroken, kept wiping away tears.  Seeing Qin Sang unmoved, he angrily kicked him. "You idiot! What are you doing just standing there? Hurry and chase after her!"</p><p>Master Tongshen looked over. "The three of you leave and take care of Frost.  Master Zhou and I have important matters to discuss."</p><p>"Yes, Master."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others left the hall. Qingyan was injured and needed to retreat to heal. Qin Sang and Qinghong quickly found Frost sitting on a cliff edge, staring blankly east, the abyss a step away.</p><p>"Frost, don't do anything rash!"</p><p>Qinghong rushed to her side and held her.  "Though Elder Lu is gone, you still have your master and us. We're like sisters..."</p><p>"Elder Lu wouldn't want to see you so despondent."</p><p>"You must be strong, take care of yourself, and carry on Elder Lu's legacy. That's the best way to honor her memory..."</p><p>Qinghong offered comfort, but Frost remained unresponsive.  Raising her head, she saw Qin Sang leaning against a tree, arms crossed, seemingly watching the scene unfold. Enraged, she snapped, "Are you mute? Can't you say anything?"</p><p>"This isn't Frost's first loss. Does she really need comforting? If she can't move on, she should channel her grief into strength, train harder, and one day avenge her masters," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Qinghong gritted her teeth, wanting to kick Qin Sang, but Frost suddenly raised her head, a spark of light flickering in her dull eyes. She took a deep breath, wiped away her tears, and bowed deeply to Qin Sang. "Thank you, Daoist friend, for your guidance."</p><p>"You really understand? Revenge is necessary, but don't let hatred blind you," Qinghong worried.</p><p>"According to Master, I should call you junior brother," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Thank you, junior brother."</p><p>Frost smiled, her sadness seemingly gone. "Senior sister, junior brother, I'm going to train."</p><p>She flew towards her quiet room. Qinghong tried to follow, but Qin Sang stopped her.</p><p>"Will this really work? Won't junior sister go astray?" Qinghong whispered.</p><p>"Time heals all wounds," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"Sigh, our junior sister has lost her family. We must take care of her, and you too, junior brother!" Qinghong sighed, then quickly bowed. "Greetings, Master."</p><p>"What were you two saying?" Master Tongshen appeared, looking at his disciples.</p><p>"Oh! Nothing!"</p><p>Qinghong pointed to the quiet room. "I'll go check on junior sister."</p><p>"Go," Master Tongshen shook his head, then addressed Qin Sang. "Qingfeng, come walk with Master in the mountains."</p><p>"Yes, Master."</p><p>Qin Sang followed Master Tongshen along the cliff.  Where Master Tongshen walked, the vegetation parted, rocks split neatly, forming a path.</p><p>They walked in silence to the mountaintop. Master Tongshen stood on a large rock, hands behind his back, gazing west. They remained there until sunset, stars appearing in the night sky.</p><p>Master Tongshen looked up, then turned to Qin Sang.  Seeing no impatience, he said, "Your senior siblings lack your composure."</p><p>Qin Sang showed no pride. "Master is troubled?"</p><p>"Oh?" Master Tongshen was surprised. "You can tell I'm troubled?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. "Disciple is inexperienced, but not foolish."</p><p>Master Tongshen laughed. "Then tell me, what troubles me?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned thought. "I suspect two things trouble Master."</p><p>"First, our move to Yongtu City. Leaving our home... we don't know if the daoists there will accept us, whether we'll meet friends or foes, or how the monsters will treat humanity. The future is uncertain, and Master worries for us, and for humanity's future."</p><p>Master Tongshen nodded slightly. "And the second?"</p><p>"Second, Master once said you entered the mortal world for cultivation, disguising yourself as a beggar to find opportunities. Disciple didn't understand then, but I do now."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression showed concern. "The cultivation world respects strength. If Master breaks through, our problems will be solved. But Master returned early for disciples, and now this… Master may never have another chance to descend into the mortal world, so Master also worries about their own cultivation."</p>
