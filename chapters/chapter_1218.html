<h1>Chapter 1210: All Means Unleashed</h1><p>Qin Sang, fearing detection, did not wait to approach the battlefield before launching his attack.</p><p>Thus, none of the numerous cultivators present noticed him until he revealed himself.</p><p>In just an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang, relying on his extraordinary movement technique, charged into the battlefield.</p><p>The Serpent King, the Lu-named cultivator, and the Frost Lizard, all seasoned veterans, acted with perfect coordination the moment they saw Qin Sang, making the most optimal decisions.</p><p>The Frost Lizard once again summoned the Snow Pearl, joining forces with the Lu-named cultivator to counterattack the malevolent spirit.</p><p>At that very moment, the malevolent spirit's tail swept across the battlefield.</p><p>The Snow Pearl spun rapidly, surrounded by swirling snow and biting cold winds.</p><p>'Crack...'</p><p>The malevolent spirit's tail visibly began to ice over, its movements slowing down.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Serpent King, without even glancing at the malevolent spirit, reversed his black blade and slashed towards Jiang Chenzi and his companion.</p><p>Having experienced the power of the black blade before, Jiang Chenzi and his companion dared not be careless. They quickly joined forces to activate the treasure banner before them, conjuring a blood sword to block the blade's energy.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang inwardly praised.</p><p>Truly top-tier experts, their timing impeccable. The combined attack of the Lu-named cultivator and the Frost Lizard perfectly restrained the malevolent spirit, giving Qin Sang a better opportunity to strike.</p><p>Of course, their true intention was to escape as quickly as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang was willing to draw the malevolent spirit's attention, something they were more than happy to let him do.</p><p>Even the Serpent King did not believe Qin Sang could easily retrieve the treasure from within the malevolent spirit. To seize the treasure, they would first need to weaken the malevolent spirit significantly and drive away the YuanYing cultivators from the Sin Abyss.</p><p>With Qin Sang joining, their side's strength increased greatly, but it would still be difficult to achieve in a short time. Moreover, the Lu-named cultivator was severely injured, barely suppressing his wounds, and urgently needed a safe place to recover.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Chenzi and his group must have already contacted other reinforcements. If they delayed any longer, other YuanYing cultivators from the Abyssal Ruins would arrive, and escape would become impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed aside his scattered thoughts.</p><p>The malevolent spirit was right before him. Facing such a massive body and terrifying aura, Qin Sang felt immense pressure, a faint sense of suffocation creeping in.</p><p>His expression remained calm, showing no fear as he coldly stared at the malevolent spirit, revealing his killing intent only now that he had arrived.</p><p>"Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The spirit sword shot through the air, its tip aimed at the malevolent spirit!</p><p>At this moment, the battlefield was divided into three sections.</p><p>The YuanYing cultivators from the Sin Abyss, furthest away, finally reacted, emerging from the shadows, their movements noticeably slower, appearing detached from the main conflict.</p><p>The Serpent King faced Jiang Chenzi and his companion alone, his black blade clashing against their blood sword.</p><p>The Frost Lizard shielded the Lu-named cultivator, fully activating the Snow Pearl, desperately entangling the malevolent spirit's tail. Qin Sang appeared on the other side of the malevolent spirit, his spirit sword leaving his body.</p><p>In an instant, everyone's gaze was involuntarily drawn to the sword light, their vision blurred, their minds swayed.</p><p>"A supreme-grade treasure!"</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the Ebony Sword, the same thought flashed through everyone's minds, their expressions shifting in various ways.</p><p>Among them, the Serpent King was the most shocked.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang possessed a set of formation flags with power comparable to a supreme-grade treasure, but now he had produced yet another supreme-grade flying sword, earning him the title of the Treasure-Laden Demon King.</p><p>Could a newly ascended demon king truly possess such wealth?</p><p>It had taken him years of effort and countless resources to refine his black blade to the level of a supreme-grade treasure.</p><p>"The Thousand Bamboo Sea's foundation is truly deep!"</p><p>The Serpent King attributed this to the most mysterious Bamboo Demon, the master of the Moonlight Demon King.</p><p>The malevolent spirit, sensing the malice directed at it, turned its massive head, its eyes blazing with fury, locking onto Qin Sang, the source of its hatred.</p><p>It despised the Serpent King and his companions, but that did not mean it would not retaliate against others. Otherwise, Jiang Chenzi and his group would not have been so cautious.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The malevolent spirit, enraged, shifted its attention to Qin Sang, determined to obliterate this audacious ant from existence.</p><p>Its head lunged forward, fangs bared, completely disregarding the Ebony Sword. A green light flickered in its throat, ready to deliver a fatal blow to Qin Sang.</p><p>Having observed this move during the battle, Qin Sang was prepared. Knowing he could not allow the malevolent spirit to unleash this attack, he swiftly changed his sword technique, causing the Ebony Sword to split into countless sword lights.</p><p>The sword lights flowed like water.</p><p>In an instant, the sword formation materialized.</p><p>At this moment, the blood-lit space dimmed.</p><p>The area around the malevolent spirit turned murky, as if night had fallen, shrouded in a gray veil.</p><p>The light grew extremely dim, all the sword lights vanishing from sight. Even the Ebony Sword itself merged into the formation, becoming invisible, shrouded in mystery, making it difficult to discern.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see thin gray threads crisscrossing within the formation, constantly shifting and changing.</p><p>If one attempted to sense it with their spiritual awareness, they would feel a faint, stinging pain.</p><p>The malevolent spirit was enveloped by the sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back, fully activating the Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation.</p><p>This opportunity would only come once. Although the malevolent spirit lacked intelligence, its instincts remained. After suffering once, it would learn to evade and counterattack, making it difficult to lure it into the formation again.</p><p>Against the malevolent spirit, the Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation was far more lethal than the Frost Lizard's methods.</p><p>The pain coursing through its body drove the malevolent spirit into a frenzy. The green light forming in its mouth dimmed momentarily, interrupted by this attack.</p><p>A single moment was all Qin Sang needed!</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang flapped his wings and without hesitation rushed to the malevolent spirit's side. With a swift motion of his sleeve, the Twelve Demon Banners he had prepared earlier spun rapidly, embedding themselves deep into the malevolent spirit's body.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>An endless stream of Nine Nether Demon Fire surged from the banners, unable to coalesce. The demon fire, like dark tendrils, pierced deep into the malevolent spirit's body.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire was particularly effective against such spiritual entities.</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence in daring to snatch the treasure from the tiger's mouth stemmed from the Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation and the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have prioritized his own safety, either continuing to observe and wait for an opportunity or simply giving up.</p><p>At most, out of respect for his friendship with the Serpent King, he would have restrained one or two YuanYing cultivators from the Sin Abyss, helping create an opportunity for escape, but never daring to engage the malevolent spirit directly.</p><p>This was the Abyssal Ruins, the heart of the Sin Abyss, where several YuanYing cultivators could appear at any moment, trapping them here.</p><p>'Sizzle...'</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire, like a persistent parasite, 'burned through' the malevolent spirit's body under the astonished gazes of everyone, reaching its core and wrapping around the piece of white bronze.</p><p>"He really can seize the treasure from within the malevolent spirit!"</p><p>Everyone was stunned by the sight.</p><p>In the next moment, the Nine Nether Demon Fire touched the white bronze, curling back like a wave.</p><p>The white bronze showed no reaction, enveloped by the Nine Nether Demon Fire, and flew out of the malevolent spirit's body.</p><p>Although the stone axe and blood jade were not far from the white bronze, Qin Sang did not hesitate to withdraw the Nine Nether Demon Fire, as if he had not seen the other two treasures at all.</p><p>A clear, ghostly light erupted from within the malevolent spirit, its wounds rapidly healing.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire still within its body was being extinguished by the ghostly light, struggling to break free. Finally, just before being completely extinguished, it managed to bring the white bronze out.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was not greedy, or else even the white bronze would have been returned.</p>
