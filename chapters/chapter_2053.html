<h1>Chapter 2044:  The Father's Legacy</h1><p>Elder You seemed considerably more enthusiastic than their last meeting, inviting Qin Sang to sit at the stone pavilion.</p><p>“I’ve been awaiting Elder Qin for some time…”</p><p>Elder You presented two jade boxes, pushing them towards Qin Sang.  “Please examine these items.”</p><p>Qin Sang, having already formed a suspicion, gestured to open the boxes.  One contained numerous golden seeds, resembling small gourds, with delicate, petal-like veins extending from their rounder end, even sketching out the calyx;  quite unique, with occasional sparks of electricity flickering across the petals. These were the Golden Veined Seeds.</p><p>The other box held a wisp of grayish, ethereal substance, light as a breeze, seemingly about to dissipate with a puff – the Ethereal Wind.</p><p>Both were exactly what Qin Sang needed. Elder You had previously mentioned the alliance possessed rare treasures, but Qin Sang hadn't expected them to be offered so readily.</p><p>The quantity of spiritual materials in the boxes was sufficient, yet although tempted, Qin Sang didn't reach for them, instead looking up at Elder You.</p><p>“Elder You, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>As a guest elder, one would naturally be treated with high regard when favored, typically receiving gifts without significant obligation.  Qin Sang knew he hadn't yet earned the right to have the Five Elements Alliance simply bestow these items upon him.</p><p>Elder You hadn't even mentioned any conditions before presenting the items, a fact which naturally aroused Qin Sang's suspicions.</p><p>“Hehehe, Elder Qin has arrived at the perfect time,” Elder You said, their expression relaxed. “The alliance recently received a commission and is recruiting personnel.  Some days ago, I reported Elder Qin’s abilities; instructions came down to invite you. If you accept this task, these two items are your reward, regardless of success or failure.  If you succeed, the client may offer further substantial gifts.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two jade boxes.  The reward was undeniably valuable, but it also hinted at the difficulty of the task.</p><p>“What is the nature of this commission?” Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>“Those who seek out the Five Elements Alliance naturally do so for matters of refinement,” Elder You explained. “Elder Qin can rest assured, there’s no danger. However, the client is very secretive about the treasure they wish refined; even the alliance is unaware of the details. Only upon arrival at the client's mountain gate, after accepting the commission, will you be informed.”</p><p>Hearing it was about refinement and not treasure hunting, Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. As an outsider, accepting an invitation for treasure hunting easily led to being manipulated. Unless absolutely necessary, he wouldn't willingly place himself in jeopardy.</p><p>The two treasures lay before him, making it impossible for Qin Sang to deny his interest.  However, he needed clarification, and after some thought, he said, “I have only recently arrived; my skills haven’t been properly assessed. Why would such a secretive commission, with such a generous reward, fall to me? Is there some hidden reason, or is the client… difficult to work with?”</p><p>“There’s no need for assessment.  Who would dare question the refinement skills of a guest elder of this alliance? As for the client, there’s no need for worry.  They cultivate Xuanmen Daoist practices, certainly not demonic or evil.  The hidden reason, as I mentioned, is that the client requires someone with a clean background.  Most elders in the alliance cannot meet this requirement, and several candidates we recommended were rejected, causing much trouble. We were even considering recruiting from the outer Tianzhou region,” Elder You said, a look of helplessness on their face.</p><p>A clean background?</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred. Although Elder You hadn't explicitly stated it, the implication was clear.  In terms of a clean background, no one could compare to him, an outsider with no ties to any faction in Kanzhou.</p><p>“I can’t say more, nor can I say less! Can you at least reveal the refinement requirements and the timeframe?  Otherwise, if I’m stuck there for too long, it would disrupt my own affairs.”</p><p>Though his words contained a hint of dissatisfaction, Elder You easily detected Qin Sang’s interest, promptly producing a jade slip.  “All the information is within.”</p><p>Simultaneously, Elder You placed a contract on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang received it, examined it carefully, pondered for a moment, then nodded, signing the contract and gathering the two jade boxes with a wave of his sleeve.  “I’ll undertake this task.  May I ask the name of the client?”</p><p>Elder You rejoiced, “It's the Luohua Temple. A Real Person from the Luohua Temple awaits outside. I’ll summon him immediately to meet Elder Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, remembering a name he had seen on a sea chart. “Is it a Daoist sect?”</p><p>“Precisely!” Elder You nodded.</p><p>Following the collapse of the Divine Court, many Daoist sects throughout the vast world were descendants of the Dan-Ding school.  Due to their connection with the Fu-Ling school, Qin Sang naturally felt more favorable toward Daoist sects; they were generally easier to deal with than those of the heretical and demonic paths.</p><p>Elder You gave the order, and shortly after, a servant led in a young Daoist priest, hair styled in a Daoist bun, adorned with a jade hairpin, exuding a refined demeanor and clearly possessing the cultivation of a late-stage Nascent Divinity cultivator.</p><p>“Poor Daoist Yu Hong greets both senior elders,” Real Person Yu Hong bowed, neither humble nor arrogant in the presence of two Void Refinement cultivators. His gaze then shifted to Qin Sang.</p><p>“This is Elder Qin. He has signed the contract.  Please discuss the return date yourselves. I shall not disturb you further.”</p><p>Elder You rose to leave, then suddenly remembered something and said to Qin Sang, "I've already issued an order to our various branches to investigate other spiritual materials.  Please be patient, Elder Qin. We should have good news upon our return from Luohua Mountain."</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, Elder You!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood to see him off, then returned to the pavilion and invited True Person Yu Hong to sit.  "Does your sect have any further requests of me?"</p><p>"No other requests.  When can you depart, Elder Qin?" True Person Yu Hong sat upright.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, asked a few more questions, and seeing that True Person Yu Hong was very tight-lipped, said, "I'll make some arrangements upon my return and leave tonight."</p><p>Leaving True Person Yu Hong at the Five Elements Alliance, Qin Sang returned to his cave abode, woke his sword servant, and instructed him, "I've been invited to refine a treasure for someone and will likely be away for some time.  Remain in Xuwu City and keep an eye on the Five Elements Alliance."</p><p>That night, Qin Sang and True Person Yu Hong left Xuwu City. After several changes of location, they arrived at a fairy city called Yanling.</p><p>Kan Prefecture's fairy cities are all built on islands; often, one island is one city.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang learned about the local customs of Kan Prefecture.  Within the fairy cities, stability is generally ensured, but not necessarily outside.</p><p>In the vast ocean, the death of a few people barely makes a ripple.  Large forces establish their own sects outside the fairy cities, becoming local rulers.  Frequent clashes occur between these factions, and the fairy cities cannot interfere.</p><p>Luohua Temple is located outside Yanling City.  After leaving Yanling City and flying for several days, they saw mountains and lush green forests stretching endlessly before them on the sea.</p><p>Some of Kan Prefecture's islands are like continents in the eyes of cultivators from the Lesser Thousand World.  Countless mortals live here, with numerous countries and temples, all under the rule of Luohua Temple.</p><p>The island is abundant in spiritual energy and vitality. The creatures here are constantly bathed in green spiritual energy. The mortals are all sharp-eared, sharp-eyed, and physically fit.  Generations of this have changed their physique, making it easier for exceptional talents to emerge.  These talents are then recruited into immortal sects, ensuring their continued existence.</p><p>In the eyes of the major sects, these are superior people, a carefully cultivated population group of significant value, even tradeable.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately slowed his flight speed, intending to learn some experience in managing his own sect from Luohua Temple.  Once they arrived, True Person Yu Hong did not urge him, patiently following behind and answering any questions Qin Sang had.</p><p>Luohua Temple was orderly, with disciples flying about, each performing their duties.  The difference in the people was clear; Bi Shui Village's foundation was shallow, incomparable to Luohua Temple.</p><p>A glimpse reveals the whole picture; this is the foundation of a renowned sect.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that Luohua Temple was not a top-tier sect in Kan Prefecture, its current master reportedly only at the late Nascent Soul stage. He wondered what the power of those at the Unity or even Mahayana stages was like, realizing he had a long way to go.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang saw a peculiar peak rising in front, shrouded in immortal clouds, with a vast, boundless swamp in the distance.  Several temples were faintly visible among the mountains, all obscured by a strange aura.</p><p>"Elder Qin, that is our sect's gate," True Person Yu Hong flew forward to lead the way.</p><p>Before they entered the mountain, they heard a gong sound and the roar of water.  A ribbon of water shot out from among the peaks, its waves extending to their feet, followed by celestial music as teams of female immortals in feathered robes and cloud-like attire, holding qins, zithers, and lutes, came walking on the water.</p><p>Strong men stood on either side, guarding them.</p><p>At the head of the group was an exceptionally tall elder with a refined air. He bowed to them, his voice booming.</p><p>"Greetings to True Person Yu Hong, this immortal is Elder Qin, I presume? The master is waiting for you at the Profound Water Palace."</p><p>This man seemed to hold a high position in Luohua Temple. True Person Yu Hong stepped aside and said, "Thank you, Daoist Mi, for leading the way."</p><p>"This way, immortal."</p><p>Elder Mi, with a respectful demeanor, waited until Qin Sang stepped onto the water before turning to lead the way.</p><p>A waterway led directly to the Profound Water Palace deep within Luohua Temple.</p><p>Traveling on the waterway, the scenery of the sect was visible.  Luohua Temple disciples, seeing the water flowing from the sky, knew distinguished guests had arrived, and bowed from afar, respectfully seeing them off before returning to their tasks.</p><p>However, what caught Qin Sang's attention most was not the scenery or the disciples of Luohua Temple, but Elder Mi and some particularly outstanding strong men.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the elderly man surnamed Mi, while moving, occasionally revealed his wrist from his robe sleeve.  He had significantly more grey body hair than a human, and peculiar tattoos on his skin—not the kind of sacred markings used by the Wu people.  Whether these were birthmarks or later additions was unclear.</p><p>His bodyguards were clearly of the same tribe. Some wore only armor; through the gaps in the plates, Qin Sang saw that their arms were covered in tattoos, all very similar. Their torsos bulged with muscle, but lacked tattoos.  Their arms were particularly thick and powerful.</p><p>Apart from the heavily tattooed arms, abundant hair, tall stature, and unusual appearance, they weren't so different from humans.</p><p>Recalling Elder You's words, Qin Sang said, "Forgive my boldness, Daoist Mi, but are you not of human descent?"</p><p>The elderly man replied respectfully, "I humbly report to the Upper True One, we are descendants of the Ju Fu tribe."</p><p>Master Yu Hong explained, "The Ju Fu are a different race.  Years ago, for unknown reasons, a branch of their people was driven from the Mist Sea. While adrift, they encountered an ancestor of our sect, who took them in and brought them to the mountains. They willingly pledged their loyalty to our Luo Hua Temple, and the Temple Master allowed them to work here."</p><p>The elderly man bowed deeply, saying, "We are eternally grateful for the Temple's kindness in giving us a place to live and allowing our people to prosper."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, Elder You wasn't wrong.  Though this Mi was of a different race, Master Yu Hong's attitude indicated considerable trust and influence.</p><p>"The Ju Fu tribe..."</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the elderly man and his people more closely.  He noted their powerful builds, but also their somewhat pointed and weaselly faces.  This was particularly noticeable in the older Mi.  A thought occurred to him, and he said, "I have seen your kin, the Chang You tribe.  They have four ears, but lack your arm tattoos.  Their appearance is somewhat similar. Is there a connection between your tribes?"</p><p>"The Chang You tribe?"</p><p>The elderly man pondered for a moment, then nodded.  "Among the various tribes, the Ju Fu do have some close relatives.  There does seem to be a tribe called Chang You. However, according to our elders, among the different races, except for the ever-flourishing Feather People and Merfolk, other tribes have risen and fallen.  Before our branch was banished, we seemed to have lost contact with the Chang You. They may have migrated elsewhere, or perhaps they have already declined. We only know the name now."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.  If the Chang You couldn't even conquer the Storm Realm, they probably weren't very powerful.</p><p>As they spoke, they reached the edge of the water. Before them stood a magnificent jade palace, and an ethereal-looking old Daoist stood before it.</p><p>Seeing the Daoist, Qin Sang felt a slight tremor. The man's aura was profound and deep, reminding Qin Sang of the Meng Island Master he'd encountered on the way to Great Zhou.  However, facing such a powerful person, Qin Sang felt much calmer than before.</p><p>This must be the current Luo Hua Temple Master, who changes his Daoist name to Luo Hua upon ascension.</p><p>Luo Hua Master laughed heartily and swept his whisk.  "We secretly invited Elder Qin, fearing that a grander invitation might attract unwanted attention.  Please forgive our lack of formality."</p><p>"Master is too kind!"</p><p>Qin Sang reached the water's edge, bowed slightly, exchanged pleasantries with Luo Hua Master, and they walked towards the palace together.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang sensed several powerful auras.  He knew that Luo Hua Temple hadn't invited only him; other Daoists must be inside.</p><p>Master Yu Hong and the others waited outside.</p><p>Luo Hua Master looked at Qin Sang, saying, "I see Elder Qin has no attendants; it seems you might be interested in acquiring some. The Ju Fu are quite capable; would they meet with your approval?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, pausing. "The Master is willing to offer them as a gift?"</p><p>He looked back at the elderly Mi.  Despite his people being offered as gifts, his expression showed no shame, and the others stood tall, eager to be chosen, seemingly proud rather than humiliated.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  It seemed this tribe had been completely subdued by Luo Hua Temple; their spirit was broken.</p><p>"To follow Elder Qin would be their good fortune," Luo Hua Master said calmly.</p><p>"Let's discuss the main matter first. We can talk about this later."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explicitly refuse, thinking that taking a couple of Ju Fu might be useful in manipulating relations between the tribes.</p>
