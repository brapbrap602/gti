<h1>Chapter 1580: The Ullambana Assembly</h1><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Qin Sang returned directly to Zhuozhou from the Northern Wastelands, heading first to Mount Bu Nian.</p><p>The sky was clear and vast.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain that marked the entrance to Mount Bu Nian, where the "White Cloud Waterfall" stone tablet once stood.</p><p>He looked up, but the sky was cloudless.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended a certain distance, but the magnificent cloud waterfall was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>He released his divine sense, but couldn't detect any fluctuations from Mount Bu Nian's protective formation, not even the "White Cloud Waterfall" stone tablet was there.</p><p>He had intended to ask Situ Yu about Elder Yanshan's origins, but now he couldn't even find the sect's entrance. Mount Bu Nian's protective formation was no ordinary barrier, and he couldn't force his way in.</p><p>Mount Bu Nian's seclusion wasn't a jest; it had truly withdrawn from the world.</p><p>It wouldn't be appropriate to intrude.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently and flew away on a rainbow arc.</p><p>Back in the Clear Void Illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang and his avatar sat facing each other, taking out the spoils of their journey: two pills, an ice disc, and a few of Yue Fei's belongings.</p><p>Her spatial pouch had survived.</p><p>To make her act more convincing, and to prevent Su Zinan from obtaining the pouch and discovering her scheme, Yue Fei had only prepared necessary pills and other items for herself after the possession.  Su Zinan’s bestowed treasures were mostly left on the body he originally inhabited.</p><p>She truly was the beloved concubine of the Nascent Soul Patriarch's adopted son.</p><p>Despite destroying so many treasures in the ice cave battle, Yue Fei still had two fairly powerful magical artifacts in her spatial pouch.</p><p>The most precious was the splitting silver bracelet.  Qin Sang had confiscated it after Yue Fei's 'death.' It could restrict an opponent's magical artifacts, making it a unique and potentially invaluable treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to keep it for himself.</p><p>The two artifacts in the pouch were of lesser quality, suitable for gifting to the Xie family and the Loutai Abbey.</p><p>When he had time, he would refine them, ensuring Luye wouldn't recognize them.</p><p>Besides these, the spatial pouch also contained a large number of spirit stones and various pills, a windfall for Qin Sang, more than enough to cover his daily needs, relieving him from having to personally procure resources.</p><p>After all, the Xie family and Loutai Abbey couldn't fully support him yet.</p><p>He carefully categorized and stored everything.</p><p>Qin Sang then turned his attention to the legacy of the Water Aspect Master: the two snow-white pills.</p><p>Both he and his avatar had carefully examined them during their journey. The avatar had even tried circulating various ice-based divine abilities, but could only confirm that the pills weren't meant for increasing cultivation.</p><p>Finally, there was the ice disc.</p><p>Slightly larger than Qin Sang's palm, the disc had two layers.  Within the inner layer, a constant flow of energy circulated, confined within and never leaking out.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if it was Cold煞 energy. After retrieving it from the spirit array, it no longer exuded any Cold煞 energy; it simply felt cool to the touch.</p><p>A divine object concealing its true nature.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the ice disc for a long while, noticing the energy's unpredictable fluctuations.  Sometimes it transformed into majestic mountains and rivers, sometimes into ice crystal palaces.</p><p>Other times, it displayed various incomprehensible scenes, without any discernible pattern.</p><p>Each scene lasted less than a breath before shifting into something new.</p><p>The ice palace was breathtakingly magnificent. Just from the images on the disc, Qin Sang could sense its awe-inspiring beauty. He wondered if such a place truly existed in the world.</p><p>Unable to decipher the meaning of the scenes, Qin Sang considered for a moment, then handed the ice disc to his avatar, instructing him to refine it using the same method as refining a magical artifact.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The ice disc wasn't a magical artifact and couldn't be refined, nor was it a spiritual treasure. Otherwise, even without knowing the Through-Treasure Formula, he would have sensed the unique fluctuations of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The good news was that the avatar had successfully activated the Cold煞 energy within the ice disc, so cultivation wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>“The Cold煞 energy in the ice disc is incredibly dense, more than enough to support my avatar in cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light!  Could it be that the Water Aspect lineage requires this special treasure specifically to provide Cold煞 energy for cultivation?” Qin Sang pondered, then his expression suddenly shifted. “Wait…”</p><p>Inspiration struck. Approaching it from the perspective of array formations, he finally discovered something. “It's like an array tool, but it can't form an array on its own. Instead, it's used in conjunction with a specific type of spirit array, possibly as the array core…  The power of such an array must be astonishing!”</p><p>He couldn't be certain; this might only be one of the ice disc's functions.</p><p>Just like the pills, it all came down to one thing: to understand their true purpose, he needed to obtain the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance.</p><p>For now, it could only serve as a treasure for assisting cultivation.</p><p>The avatar put away the ice disc, preparing to cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light and gradually familiarize himself with the disc. Once he mastered the Ice Soul Divine Light, he would continue researching its other functions and attempt to cultivate with its aid.</p><p>This time, the avatar would be in secluded cultivation for a long period.</p><p>The main body yielded the cave dwelling to the avatar, switching their roles.</p><p>The cave's restrictions were sealed.</p><p>After a brief period of adjustment, and not yet in a hurry to cultivate, the main body quietly left Mount Pu, flying southeast.  Nearing the border of Zhuozhou, he stopped and entered a large market called Yanshui Market.</p><p>Yanshui Market was under Mount Bu Nian’s jurisdiction, one of the largest markets in Zhuozhou.  It was unclear how Mount Bu Nian’s seclusion would affect the market, but there were no apparent changes yet.</p><p>In the Nineteen States of Misty Rain, where sects ruled, there weren't many markets or cities exclusively for cultivators. Those that existed were typically small, secluded marketplaces catering to local trade.</p><p>In larger cities, cultivators and mortals coexisted, but there was a clear distinction between them.  Mortals generally dared not disturb the immortals.</p><p>Flight was prohibited within the market.</p><p>Having offended Luye not long ago, Qin Sang used a secret technique to alter his appearance.  With a few flashes, he entered the heart of the market and quickly found his target: the Six States Hall branch.</p><p>This was the largest Six States Hall branch in Zhuozhou.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang reached the entrance of the Six States Hall, three Golden Core cultivators emerged. The first floor hall was bustling with people, and even Qi Refining cultivators were rare.</p><p>The three Golden Core cultivators, two men and one woman, seemed to have made substantial gains, all wearing smiles.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, one of the men glanced at him, noting his ethereal yet unfamiliar aura, and feeling a flicker of curiosity.</p><p>As they passed each other, a thought suddenly crossed the man’s mind.  He secretly activated his Spirit Eye divine ability, a faint spark of lightning flashing in his left pupil.</p><p>He prided himself on the subtlety of this divine ability, having used it countless times to observe others without ever being detected.</p><p>However, as soon as the spark appeared, the man felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his left eye. He shuddered, cried out, and clutched his eye.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>His companions were startled. Blood seeped through his fingers, filling them with alarm and anger. “You…”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The man, fighting back the agonizing pain, pushed his companions away. He dared not move, consumed by fear, his voice trembling. “This junior was disrespectful, I deserve death!”</p><p>The other party paid no attention, walking into the Six States Hall without looking back.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior, for sparing my life!”</p><p>The man, as if granted a reprieve, hurriedly pulled his companions away.</p><p>After running a considerable distance, he removed his hand.</p><p>His companions were horrified to see his left eye mangled and bloody.  His painstakingly cultivated divine ability was ruined, and they didn't even know when he had been attacked. “Could that person…”</p><p>The man, having narrowly escaped death, felt incredibly fortunate. He said bitterly, “I used this divine ability to peek at the Star Picking Sect’s Patriarch and wasn’t discovered…  Fortunately, this Senior was magnanimous.  It's a blessing to be alive.  I almost dragged you down with me.”</p><p>The three whispered briefly, not daring to linger in the market, and quickly departed.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Having lightly punished the offender, Qin Sang paid him no further mind and entered the Six States Hall.</p><p>The chief steward of this Six States Hall branch was surprisingly a Nascent Soul cultivator. He had witnessed the scene outside and hurried downstairs to personally greet Qin Sang, escorting him to a quiet room.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, declining the offer of tea, and produced a token.  “This is my token. Please examine it.”</p><p>The chief steward accepted the token, excused himself, and verified it with a secret technique.  He bowed deeply and returned the token to Qin Sang.  “The token is genuine.  This humble one is Jiang Mu. Greetings, Fellow Daoist Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the gesture, greeting Jiang Mu in turn.  “Has anyone presented a token seeking me in recent years?”</p><p>“Please wait a moment, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Jiang Mu personally went to check, returning after the time it takes to burn an incense stick.</p><p>Receiving a negative response, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>A hundred years ago, Liu Li had journeyed westward to cultivate Buddhist Dharma, disappearing without a trace. He wondered where she was and whether her cultivation had borne fruit.</p><p>He collected his thoughts and stated his purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang wished to purchase information from the Six States Hall regarding various major powers in the Central Continent, not limited to the present era, the Nineteen States of Misty Rain, or any specific time period. The older, the better.</p><p>Though surprised, Jiang Mu wasn't entirely taken aback.  He guessed that Qin Sang might have discovered a secret realm or some treasure of unknown origin, and was seeking clues related to it.</p><p>He had encountered such situations numerous times.</p><p>However, such endeavors were akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, and only a very few were lucky enough to find a lead.</p><p>As long as there were spirit stones, everything was negotiable.</p><p>They reached an agreement. Qin Sang produced a pouch of spirit stones, and Jiang Mu immediately had scrolls brought in, leaving Qin Sang alone in the quiet room to peruse them.</p><p>Qin Sang erected several isolating restrictions. He first flipped to the scrolls of the Eight Scenery Sect and the Ganlu Chan Monastery, scanning the names, checking for all renowned experts above the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>It was no secret that the Nascent Soul Patriarchs of both sects frequently appeared before the public, awe-inspiring all around.</p><p>Patriarch Liesu of the Ganlu Chan Monastery, a Buddhist Saint!</p><p>And Huang Xi, a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, the Patriarch of the Eight Scenery Sect!</p><p>Moreover, they were from the same era, their breakthroughs to the Nascent Soul realm occurring within two hundred years of each other.</p><p>“Both are Nascent Soul Patriarchs!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave.</p><p>It was almost certain that the two individuals cursed by the Water Aspect Master in his testament were the Patriarchs of these two sects.</p><p>The fall of the Formless Immortal Sect coincided with the rise of the Eight Scenery Sect and the Ganlu Chan Monastery. What exactly happened back then?</p><p>The Water Aspect Master's resentment was palpable, leading Qin Sang to suspect that they were the masterminds behind the Formless Immortal Sect's demise. He hurriedly flipped through the scrolls, skimming jade slips one after another, until he finally found the entry for the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Strangely, for such a large sect, the information in the scrolls was extremely limited. No matter how many times he read it, he couldn't find any useful information, not even the location of the Formless Immortal Sect's mountain gate.  It had clearly been deliberately erased.</p><p>“The Eight Scenery Sect and the Ganlu Chan Monastery intend to eradicate all traces…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The situation was unclear, involving two top sects of Buddhism and Daoism, and fraught with hidden dangers. He couldn't investigate openly.</p><p>"A super-sect wouldn’t have only one inheritance. As the saying goes, ‘A centipede dies but doesn't stiffen.’ The Water Aspect Master's inheritance has already emerged, can the others be far behind? The Nascent Soul Patriarchs of Buddhism and Daoism constantly patrol, deterring them. Now, with rumors of their disappearance rampant, the Southern Barbarian Gu God Sect and the Northern Wastelands Demonic Sect are restless. The descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect, having lain dormant for so long, should be emerging soon, shouldn’t they?"</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger lightly on the jade slip.</p><p>His tribulation was approaching.  He might as well wait and see; all the monsters and demons would reveal themselves.</p><p>With a plan in mind, Qin Sang reviewed all the other scrolls, committing them to memory.  He then called for the attendant waiting outside to remove the scrolls and requested Jiang Mu's return.</p><p>"I have one more matter to entrust to your esteemed hall. Please assist me in gathering treasures that can enhance divine sense, be it miraculous pills, secret techniques, or magical artifacts."</p><p>This was Qin Sang's primary objective.</p><p>After breaking through to the late stage, refining the demonic fire had become much easier for Qin Sang.</p><p>At the time, he believed that if this trend continued, he had a good chance of achieving a divine sense comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator through further refinement of the demonic fire.</p><p>However, after three years of arduous cultivation since his breakthrough, Qin Sang realized he might have been too optimistic.</p><p>The speed of refining the demonic fire remained impressive, but there was a hidden concern.</p><p>He cultivated the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus," strengthening his divine sense by refining the demonic fire, and he was still far from reaching the third level of the secret technique – the transformation of the fire lotus into a lotus platform.</p><p>But this didn't mean there were no bottlenecks.</p><p>As time passed, the more demonic fire the fire lotus absorbed, the higher the demands on him became, and this increase exceeded the rate of his divine sense's growth.  There was likely a limit, a point where his divine sense and the fire lotus would reach a certain equilibrium.</p><p>He was grateful for the Soul Nurturing Wood, which subtly provided him with immense benefits. Otherwise, cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" wouldn't have been so smooth.</p><p>Continuing to forcefully refine the demonic fire, whether it would lead to a breakthrough or a loss of control, was unpredictable.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experience, the probability of success was negligible.</p><p>He either needed a significant advancement in his realm or had to find another way to achieve a breakthrough in his divine sense.</p><p>Of course, with the Cloud Wanderer Sword infused with the Soul Nurturing Wood, his soul was constantly nourished by the soul light, and he would eventually be able to refine all the demonic fire, though it would take a very long time.</p><p>The approaching chaos in the Central Continent was also an opportunity.</p><p>He wanted to further enhance his strength, not just to protect himself in the turmoil, but also to reap some benefits.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to utilize external objects, hence his approach to the Six States Hall.</p><p>This was the real business!</p><p>Beaming, Jiang Mu immediately produced a jade slip, displaying the Six States Hall’s treasures.  "Please take a look, Fellow Daoist Qin. Not long ago, the hall acquired a Wu Ding Flower, which can be refined into the Wu Ding Pill, having notable effects even on us Nascent Soul cultivators.  I can make the decision to gift the pill formula to you, Fellow Daoist.  In addition, this "Turtle Guidance Technique" is an unparalleled secret technique for cultivating divine sense, created by a renowned Nascent Soul cultivator from the Eastern Sea Immortal Mountain.  It later fell into the hands of Extinction Island and has been refined by several generations of cultivators…"</p><p>Qin Sang examined them one by one, but ultimately shook his head.</p><p>The Wu Ding Flower was only one of the main ingredients of the Wu Ding Pill. Gathering all the ingredients for the formula would take who knows how long, and the effects weren’t that impressive.</p><p>As for the "Turtle Guidance Technique," he had obtained secret techniques of that level at the Xuan Tian Palace.  By the time he encountered a bottleneck, it likely wouldn't be of much use.</p><p>A glimpse into the bigger picture.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s high standards, Jiang Mu's smile faded, and he re-evaluated Qin Sang, his estimation rising considerably.</p><p>He put away the jade slip, pondered for a moment, and said, “Fellow Daoist Qin, are you aware of the Ullambana Assembly?”</p><p>“The Buddhist Ullambana Assembly?  I’ve heard it’s held only once every thousand years,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>“Not a thousand years, but actually every five hundred years.”</p><p>Jiang Mu explained,  “Buddhism has the Ullambana Assembly, and Daoism has the Zhongyuan Ghost Festival. They’re essentially the same, simply held in rotation by Buddhism and Daoism, with different names.  It’s the grandest event in the Central Plains.”</p>
