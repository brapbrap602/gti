<h1>Chapter 467: The True Purpose</h1><p>This was clearly an abandoned place.</p><p>Just like the stone pavilion by the pond he had seen when he first entered, it had endured countless years of decay and neglect.</p><p>But after noticing the strange behavior of the restriction fragments, Qin Sang dared not underestimate this place.</p><p>Could there be a peculiar power lingering in the plaza, repelling the restriction fragments?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways and saw Granny Jing also fly up from his shoulder, looking around. He knew this must be Granny Jing's destination.</p><p>She had gone to great lengths to come here, there must be a reason, perhaps some kind of treasure hidden within.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head and looked at the center of the plaza. It was the most conspicuous spot, but it was completely covered by a pile of stone pillar fragments, concealing whatever lay beneath.</p><p>He knew his limits, suppressed his curiosity, and dared not entertain any greedy thoughts.</p><p>Once his agreement with Granny Jing was fulfilled, Qin Sang just wanted to leave immediately.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang transmitted his voice, "Senior, are you..."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang's words were interrupted by a muffled sound.</p><p>The source was right in the center of the plaza.</p><p>This sound was very abrupt. Granny Jing hadn't made any move, and the sound came from beneath the rubble in the center of the plaza.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He turned his gaze and saw the piled-up stone pillar fragments suddenly bulge, as if something was about to break free from within.</p><p>With this bulge, the bottom of the stone pillar fragments suddenly lit up. The light penetrated everywhere, and beams of white light shot out from the cracks, instantly dispelling the darkness of the entire plaza and illuminating everything.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang felt a surge of alarm. His first thought was to leave quickly. He didn't want to get involved in this mess.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang made up his mind. Without waiting for Granny Jing's response, he immediately turned to leave.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. Just as Qin Sang was about to move, a powerful spiritual power fluctuation suddenly emerged from the depths of the plaza, directly blasting apart the pile of stone pillar fragments.</p><p>In an instant, rubble flew everywhere, and dust filled the air.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, an unexpected scene unfolded before Qin Sang's eyes. Three figures shot up into the sky.</p><p>People!</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. He hadn't expected anyone else to be here.</p><p>Vice Island Master Xiao had no reason to lie to them. There were only countless restriction fragments in Pointing Sky Peak, no living beings, let alone people.</p><p>These three people suddenly rushed out from the rubble. They were clearly not among the sixty-five people who had entered with him. Could there be another entrance to Pointing Sky Peak?</p><p>Who were they?</p><p>Was Granny Jing not here to search for treasure, but after them?</p><p>As the stone pillar fragments exploded, a calm voice came from among the three, "Reporting to Elder, this is not the Immortal Mansion, but another secret realm!"</p><p>A more excited voice rang out, "Uncle, look at these! They're Star Essence Stones! The Sect Master's divine eyes are indeed sharp. The Immortal Mansion is indeed related to Pointing Sky Peak!"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Someone!"</p><p>...</p><p>They appeared too quickly. Qin Sang had no time to hide and was easily discovered.</p><p>The voices of the three abruptly stopped. They clearly hadn't expected to encounter someone as soon as they entered. Six pairs of eyes stared at Qin Sang, who was about to flee.</p><p>The dust settled.</p><p>Qin Sang saw their faces.</p><p>Three people: an old man and two young men.</p><p>The old man was in the middle, and the young men flanked him on both sides.</p><p>The old man wore a strange silver robe. A detailed star chart was depicted on the robe. The silver robe shimmered with starlight, as dazzling as a real starry sea, attracting attention.</p><p>The young man on the old man's left was the one who had spoken first. He wore ordinary clothes, his hands clasped behind his back, his expression as calm as his voice. He was clearly no ordinary person.</p><p>When facing the old man, he showed respect.</p><p>From this, and the fact that the young man in ordinary clothes addressed him as Elder, it could be seen that the old man's status was definitely very high.</p><p>The other young man held a feather fan and had a rather handsome appearance and extraordinary temperament. He was the most frivolous of the three.</p><p>He was excitedly pointing at the orbs of light outside the plaza when he suddenly noticed Qin Sang. The smile on his face instantly froze, and he looked a little strange.</p><p>Their outward auras weren't strong, all at the Foundation Establishment stage, but this didn't mean their cultivation was limited to this level.</p><p>Elder, Uncle...</p><p>These titles were not something ordinary people could bear. The old man and the young man in ordinary clothes were likely suppressing their cultivation, just like Granny Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He didn't see anything on them that indicated their identity and couldn't guess their origins. He quickly turned his gaze to Granny Jing for help, only to find that she had disappeared at some point.</p><p>The surroundings were empty. Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>The handsome young man shouted, pointing at Qin Sang, speaking rapidly, "Elder, I recognize this person! He's Shadowless Sword of Lesser Hua Mountain, quite famous in the Azuremist Great Marsh. My senior brother sent a message earlier that he was chosen by the Serpent Witch and entered Pointing Sky Peak with him. This person was among them."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the handsome young man. He was sure he had never seen this person before and didn't know who the 'senior brother' was.</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang could only be certain that they were from the Cold Light Realm or the Heavenly Alliance, not from outside the realm.</p><p>Qin Sang forced a smile on his face, but before he could speak, the old man's eyes flashed with killing intent. He coldly uttered two words.</p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. The moment he was discovered, he knew that this wouldn't end peacefully. He wasn't naive enough to think that they would let him go after their secret had been exposed.</p><p>He had hoped that if they were from the Cold Light Realm, he might be able to stall for time with words.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they were even more ruthless, directly resorting to killing without a word.</p><p>Before the old man finished speaking, the handsome young man eagerly summoned a flying sword, looking at Qin Sang with disdain, and shouted, "Hold on, Uncle, let me test him first and see what the so-called Shadowless Sword is capable of. He hasn't even reached the False Core Realm, yet his reputation almost surpasses Senior Brother's."</p><p>The young man in ordinary clothes frowned slightly and glared at the handsome young man, admonishing, "This trip concerns important matters of the sect. How can you be so reckless? Kill him first and then..."</p><p>At this moment, unnoticed by anyone, a figure in flowing white robes quietly appeared in the center of the plaza.  With an indifferent gaze, they looked at the old man and the two young men, and said in a cold voice, "Only the Elder came. Is Cold Cloud Sky still hiding in the sect, acting like a coward?"</p><p>The three were startled.</p><p>"Who!?"</p><p>"Who's there!?"</p><p>...</p><p>Cold Cloud Sky!</p><p>Hearing this name, it was like a thunderbolt striking Qin Sang's mind. He immediately realized their true identities.</p><p>Cold Cloud Sky, the Sect Master of the Mirage Gate!</p><p>Rumored to be a Nascent Soul Grandmaster!</p><p>The old man was addressed as Elder by the two young men. There was only one possibility: the Mirage Gate's Elder, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator second only to the Serpent Witch in fameâ€”Elder Starpalm!</p><p>Granny Jing's target was actually the Mirage Gate Sect Master!</p>
