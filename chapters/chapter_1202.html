<h1>Chapter 1194: The Corpse Ghost Immortal</h1><p>Upon hearing the mention of "Earth Fiend Qi," Qin Sang knew that Tan Hao had found the right person. He had encountered various corpse-refining techniques, but the method of refining corpses by absorbing Earth Fiend Qi was unique to the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Art*, making it the most distinctive feature.</p><p>"If he's a rogue cultivator, it seems the legacy of the Heavenly Corpse Sect in the Sin Abyss has likely been severed. That person probably stumbled upon the ruins of the Heavenly Corpse Sect somewhere, just like I did, and obtained its secret techniques..." Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>This wasn't surprising. Through the channels of the Two Realms Alliance, he had been gathering information about the sects in the Sin Abyss but had yet to find any connection to the Heavenly Corpse Sect. Tan Hao was quite fortunate to have encountered such a person.</p><p>"What else have you found out?" Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>"The captive knew very little about him. He only knew that this person went by the name 'Corpse Ghost Immortal' and was already a Golden Core expert when he appeared near the Near Scar Mountain. As for where he came from, no one could say," Tong Jinshan recalled the scene from back then. "Tan Daoist took the Corpse Ghost Immortal's belongings. He must have continued investigating afterward, but he never mentioned anything to us. I don't know what else he might have discovered."</p><p>Corpse Ghost Immortal. A mere Golden Core cultivator, yet with such a grandiose title. Qin Sang snorted inwardly. "Has Tan Hao never sent any messages since he left?"</p><p>"No," Tong Jinshan sighed softly. "When he bid me farewell back then, I guessed he might be heading to the Sin Abyss. I tried my best to dissuade him, but he was determined to go. Once he left, there was no news of him..."</p><p>Tan Yien's expression darkened. He knew his father had only recently formed his Golden Core. While that made him a formidable figure in the cultivation world, the Sin Abyss was the enemy's stronghold. With no news for so long, it was likely that his father had met a grim fate.</p><p>After asking a few more questions and realizing that Tong Jinshan didn't know much more, Qin Sang rewarded him with some items and had Tan Yien see him off.</p><p>"Uncle-Master..." Tan Yien returned, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him. "I'll find a way to deal with your father's situation. Right now, your top priority is to prepare for forming your Golden Core. Even with the Fiend Demon Pill, there's no guarantee of a breakthrough. Stay at the Threefold Pass for now. Experiencing the battlefield will also temper you."</p><p>He dismissed Fat Chicken and Tan Yien, then returned to his meditation chamber to ponder the matter.</p><p>"Corpse Ghost Immortal, Near Scar Mountain... The information is still too scarce! A rogue Golden Core cultivator should have been somewhat famous back then, but this person has been dead for so long. With the passage of time, how many would still remember a Golden Core cultivator from a century ago? Trying to uncover this person's identity or find Tan Hao is like searching for a needle in a haystack."</p><p>Sending juniors to the Sin Abyss would be sending them to their deaths. Qin Sang would have to investigate personally, but even then, there was no guarantee of success. The Sin Abyss was a place where every cultivator was a soldier, and they possessed strange methods like the Dark Crystal Tower. If he encountered a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss, he could rely on his various means to ensure his safety, but once exposed, it would be difficult to infiltrate again.</p><p>Qin Sang held little hope of finding Tan Hao. With no news for so long, the outcome was all but certain.</p><p>The brothers Tan Jie and Tan Hao. One willingly became a test subject for demonic arts, buying his elder brother a slim chance of survival. The other carried his comatose younger brother, tirelessly searching, dedicating his life to waking him up.</p><p>The bond between the brothers was deep, each willing to die for the other. Even in the brutal world of cultivation, the light of genuine affection still shone brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly. After some thought, he decided to seek advice from Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>A few days later.</p><p>After communicating with Senior Sister Qingjun, Qin Sang received a map she had personally drawn during her travels in the Sin Abyss. It recorded the routes she had taken and her observations.</p><p>Qingjun reminded him that the Sin Abyss had not yet mobilized its forces at that time, and the situation was vastly different from now. Most of the information she had gathered was likely outdated.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang did not possess Qingjun's abilities. Her disguise techniques were derived from her expertise in puppetry and could only be used on herself, leaving Qin Sang to fend for himself.</p><p>"Most of the Sin Abyss's experts are concentrated here. Setting out now to infiltrate the Sin Abyss would reduce the chances of being discovered. However, the Ebony Sword will take a few more months to fully absorb. Waiting a bit longer wouldn't hurt. By then, with the Ebony Sword and the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, I might even be able to kill a Nascent Soul cultivator if I encounter one, preventing any leaks..."</p><p>Qin Sang had already decided to personally investigate the Sin Abyss.</p><p>The Heavenly Corpse Sect's corpse-refining techniques were highly unique, offering a path to rapid advancement. Qin Sang had reaped many benefits from them before. Finding the Heavenly Corpse Sect's legacy might allow him to further develop his expertise in corpse refinement.</p><p>Bai's advancement was still a distant prospect. Even if he could glean something from the Corpse Soul Pearl, it was uncertain whether it could be applied to Mute Girl.</p><p>As for Qin Sang's agreement with the Two Realms Alliance, killing a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss would be more than enough to repay the debt for the Golden Sinking Wood. Leaving now wouldn't raise any objections.</p><p>In the following days, Qin Sang focused on comprehending the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, preparing for his journey, while also gathering as much information as possible about the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, two months had passed.</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was meditating in his chamber, a streak of light flew in.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the light and examined its contents, feeling somewhat surprised.</p><p>"The Serpent King is visiting?"</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang personally went to the edge of the formation to welcome him.</p><p>"It's been a while, dear in-law. How have you been?" The Serpent King greeted Qin Sang with a smile, his tone carrying a hint of teasing.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. A month ago, Bai He and Yue'er had held their wedding in the Thousand Bamboo Sea. Although Qin Sang hadn't returned, he had been in constant communication with the Serpent King about the matter and had sent Fat Chicken with gifts.</p><p>According to Fat Chicken, Yue'er now followed Bai He like a shadow, and Bai He had become very well-behaved.</p><p>"Please, come in!" Qin Sang warmly welcomed him.</p><p>Back in the meditation chamber, they sat facing each other. The Serpent King glanced around the chamber's simple furnishings and remarked, "It's precisely this ascetic lifestyle that has allowed you to achieve such greatness, isn't it? Back then, Qian Ji refused to admit defeat, but now it's clear that you held back. He used all his divine abilities, yet you only brought out nine of your Twelve Demon Banners, and your innate divine ability remained unused..."</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the Demon Banners and the *Thunder Control Art* couldn't be hidden. However, they had clearly misunderstood, mistaking the *Thunder Control Art* for his innate divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the misunderstanding with humility and then inquired about the Serpent King's purpose for visiting.</p><p>The Serpent King's expression turned serious. "I won't beat around the bush. Qian Ji and I insisted on obtaining your spirit insect because we suspected it was the Celestial Eye Butterfly. We wanted to use it to break ancient restrictions and explore a cave that might belong to an ancient great demon. Since Qian Ji lost the bet, the matter of the spirit insect is no longer relevant. Would you be willing to accompany us on this journey in a few months?"</p><p>The Serpent King was direct, laying out his intentions clearly.</p><p>"An ancient great demon's cave?" Qin Sang was taken aback. "Where is this cave located?"</p><p>He suddenly understood. After the Celestial Eye Butterfly's advancement, its ability to break restrictions had become even stronger. No wonder the Serpent King had been so persistent about the spirit insect back then.</p><p>"The Sin Abyss."</p><p>"The Sin Abyss's territory is no smaller than the Skywalk Plateau..." The Serpent King shook his head slightly, his voice grave. "Not just anywhere, but the very source of the name 'Sin Abyss'â€”the great chasm that runs through most of the Sin Abyss. The cave is located deep within the Sin Abyss!"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Last night, I finally finished organizing the clutter in my neighborhood. Things are mostly back to normal now, and I can finally breathe freely.</p><p>This chapter was written early in the morning. I'll make up for last night's chapter today.</p><p>In the coming days, I'll do my best to catch up on the missed updates.</p>
