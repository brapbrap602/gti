<h1>Chapter 1672: Return to Position</h1><p>As time passed, the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror no longer simply adhered to the surface of the seal, but embedded itself completely, continuously sinking inward.</p><p>During this process, it didn't provoke any ripples or counterattacks from the seal; it was as subtle as the gentle nurturing of spring rain, demonstrating the mirror's profound magical power.</p><p>When the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror penetrated the interior of the seal, the scene inside was unexpected. It wasn't the vibrant colors they anticipated, but a world devoid of light.</p><p>Darkness, oppression.</p><p>Through the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror, this feeling was transmitted to Fan Laomo's consciousness, causing him to inwardly tremble.</p><p>Soon, the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror revealed that this wasn't pure darkness; there was actually a light source. At the heart of the darkness, a point of light flickered.</p><p>Its colors were divided into five, echoing the seal.</p><p>The Tian Hao Ancient Mirror then moved towards it, reflecting a five-colored crown.</p><p>The mirror stopped beside the five-colored crown. The ethereal lotus within the mirror slowly floated outwards. As the lotus moved, its closed petals opened layer by layer, returning to the form of the Myriad Illusions Ethereal Lotus.</p><p>A mass of black energy rose and fell in the lotus heart, gradually coalescing into a human-like outline—Fan Laomo himself!</p><p>At this moment, Fan Laomo's state was very peculiar. He hadn't entered in his physical body, but had used a secret technique to transform into a phantom body, attaching himself to the treasure mirror and using the Tian Hao Treasure Mirror as a carrier to bring his phantom body inside.</p><p>Although not his physical form, and subject to certain limitations, he could still utilize many of his magical powers through his phantom body.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Fan Laomo opened his eyes, which were black, with what looked like two ethereal lotuses within his pupils.</p><p>“Is this the treasure?”</p><p>His black eyes moved, a hint of doubt in Fan Laomo's gaze. Here, the five elements converged, the energy chaotic. His gaze fell upon the five-colored crown; he was about to carefully analyze its structure when he saw it tremble.</p><p>Five-colored radiance instantly illuminated all directions. Fan Laomo felt that although the crown's shape hadn't changed, it was completely different from before. A peerless treasure was awakening.</p><p>In fact, Fan Laomo truly felt something awakening within the five-colored crown…</p><p>This something seemed to be… consciousness!</p><p>Consciousness awak…ening?</p><p>An unprecedented feeling stunned Fan Laomo. Then, the feeling became even clearer, definitely not an illusion. In an instant, or perhaps even less, a more real sensation appeared.</p><p>It was the feeling of being watched!</p><p>The source of the ‘gaze’ was the five-colored crown.</p><p>The phantom body was impervious to heat and cold, yet at this moment, it suddenly shivered. A chill shot straight to the top of his head, almost causing him to cry out in alarm, “Spirit!”</p><p>Spirit!</p><p>The five-colored crown had actually given birth to a spirit!</p><p>In fact, the Tian Hao Ancient Mirror of the Tian Hao Tower and the Eight Scenery Palace Lamp of the Eight Scenery Pavilion were both treasures. The presence or absence of a treasure to suppress the sect's fortune is a mark of top-tier sects; the Ganlu Zen Temple naturally wasn't lacking.</p><p>But treasures not only vary in power, but also in strength.</p><p>Distinguishing the strength of treasures, spirituality is an undeniable factor.</p><p>When spirituality is refined to its peak, a spirit is born, marking a treasure's rebirth.</p><p>The Tian Hao Ancient Mirror and the Eight Scenery Palace Lamp had never directly clashed, and neither sect would proactively reveal its secrets, but it's certain that they were still far from giving birth to a spirit.</p><p>The timeframe is difficult to calculate; it could be hundreds or thousands of years, or it might never happen.</p><p>Because even if spirituality is refined to its peak, it's still in a chaotic state, and may not necessarily give birth to a spirit. This stage is also known as the ‘Spirit Shaping’ stage, the difficulty comparable to a cultivator breaking through a major realm bottleneck.</p><p>Even harder!</p><p>Of course, this information was gleaned by Fan Laomo from ancient books collected by his sect. Cultivators in the Central Plains are as numerous as the grains of sand on a riverbank, not lacking in powerful cultivators. Yet, there is no clear record of a treasure giving birth to a spirit.</p><p>In this world, cultivators possessing treasures are few and far between. Those at the late Yuan Ying stage are still using various secret techniques to elevate their life treasures to pseudo-treasures, striving towards true treasures.</p><p>Who dares to dream of the unattainable spirit?</p><p>At this moment, besides his shock, Fan Laomo suddenly understood what the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had sealed away at Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>It was to suppress the spirit!</p><p>Treasures might choose their masters, requiring the "Treasure Control Scripture" to control. If a spirit exists, how could it willingly submit to a cultivator's enslavement?</p><p>Back then, during the demonic tribulation, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had used this treasure several times, always accompanied by powerful formations. Now, looking back, each formation was different, but they all subtly conformed to the Way of the Five Elements.</p><p>It's estimated that this was to control the treasure and to suppress the spirit, preventing it from causing havoc.</p><p>In an instant, various thoughts crossed his mind. Fan Laomo thought he understood the truth, yet his mind remained tense, sensing the spirit's gaze.</p><p>A furious rage was palpable.  This was the culmination of several failed schemes, betrayals, and the realization that even his home had been infiltrated.  The spirit's anger, fueled by accumulating setbacks, burned fiercely.</p><p>Under the gaze of this intensely angry spirit, Fan Laomo's heart pounded.  Seeing the jade pieces on the five-colored crown radiate brightly, he felt a sudden sense of danger.</p><p>Without a moment's hesitation, he instinctively flung out his right hand. A stream of dark green light shot forth.  Within the light, countless glittering dark green grains were visible, their surfaces shimmering with green light like tiny phosphorescent embers, chilling to the bone.</p><p>This was a treasure Fan Laomo had painstakingly crafted from various poisonous substances.  Called the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand, it was designed to corrupt magical artifacts.  When using his illusionary body, he could temporarily bring a spiritually connected treasure into the battle as an ability.  His aim was to seize the spiritual treasure, preventing Zhu Wudao from controlling it and thus greatly increasing his power. The Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand was his first choice.</p><p>Though he hadn't expected to encounter the spirit, it proved fortuitous.  However, Fan Laomo was unsure how effective the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand would be. He was even less certain about the true power of the five-colored crown that housed the spirit.</p><p>He coveted the crown intensely, but understood the importance of acting within his capabilities.  He dared not attempt to seize it directly, opting for a gradual approach.</p><p>So, as he unleashed the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand, Fan Laomo retreated toward the Myriad Illusions Dark Lotus, unwilling to lose this illusory body here.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Fan Laomo was very close to the five-colored crown. The Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand instantly enveloped it, the grains transforming into points of foul phosphorescent fire, clinging to the crown's surface, staining it with dark blotches.  The crown's luster was dulled, tainted by the dark green malevolent light.</p><p>But at that moment, Fan Laomo's face contorted in shock.</p><p>Just as the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand was about to strike the crown, a hidden tide of darkness erupted from beneath it.  The black tide surged violently, carrying a terrifying demonic aura that even this great demon found chilling. It smashed into the five-colored crown with ferocious force.</p><p>This impact caused the five-colored crown to tremble violently, its radiant light flickering.  The spirit, caught off guard, was unable to react in time and was struck by the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand.</p><p>The black tide was the true seal!</p><p>He had been used!</p><p>Fan Laomo was shocked and enraged.  It was too late to retract the Foul Yin Phosphorescent Sand.  Many questions flooded his mind.</p><p>What was the relationship between the spirit and the black tide? If the five-colored crown was part of a seal, why hadn't the spirit counterattacked or warned him when he delved deeper into the seal?</p><p>…</p><p>On Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang misled the Poison King, luring him away, while relentlessly pursuing the Kun Dao.</p><p>The Sun God Tree and the Four-Headed Serpent Seal combined their power, delivering several powerful blows. Despite the protective barrier, the Kun Dao was injured, her wounds worsening.  She was also forced to focus on expelling the sword intent Qin Sang had left within her, leaving her almost defenseless and relying solely on escape.</p><p>Though his avatar was absent, Qin Sang had the upper hand, no longer needing to actively maintain his protective energy field.  He moved with ease.</p><p>From outside the mountain, one could see bursts of colored smoke – red and black – blooming down the slopes of Emperor's Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The Golden Immersed Sword hung inverted above Qin Sang's head, its intent accumulating silently.</p><p>Qin Sang held the Sun God Tree in one hand, while in the other, the Devilfire Flame Dragon coiled, both attacking in turns.</p><p>Ignoring her injuries, the Kun Dao focused on suppressing and expelling Qin Sang's sword intent.  Just before Qin Sang forced her to reveal her true form, she finally dispelled the last of his sword intent.</p><p>Unknowingly letting out a breath of relief, the Kun Dao suddenly shifted dozens of meters within the barrier, then froze. The Devilfire Flame Dragon followed closely.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The intense impact, transmitted through the barrier, struck the Kun Dao again, further damaging her already ravaged body.</p><p>It wasn't sword intent!</p><p>How did he discover me?</p><p>The Kun Dao was close to madness, but Qin Sang didn't give her time to think. The Devilfire Flame Dragon relentlessly pursued her, the increasing severity of her injuries a stark reminder that her physical form was nearing its limit.</p><p>"The time is ripe."</p><p>Qin Sang had been carefully assessing the Kun Dao's condition.</p><p>The moment the thought occurred, a sword light blazed forth like a dragon.  Wherever the Golden Immersed Sword passed, a sword array reformed.</p><p>At that moment, unexpectedly, an enraged roar erupted from the barrier.  A figure flashed, and Kun Dao fell, eyes closed, lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang barely avoided pulverizing Kun Dao, swiftly diverting the demonic fire and retracting his sword energy.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Sword threads wrapped Kun Dao's body and floated before Qin Sang.</p><p>"She's dead..."</p><p>After a brief check, Qin Sang confirmed Kun Dao's demise, utterly bewildered. He hadn't expected such decisiveness; she had committed suicide when the situation turned unfavorable.  He had pursued her this far intending to capture her alive.</p><p>Regardless, his primary objective was achieved. Qin Sang looked to Kun Dao's waist, snatched a crimson jade pendant, and felt a surge of intense solar energy, his body heating up. Its power rivaled the chilling aura of the mysterious ice disc.</p><p>"A fine treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, elated.  With this, he now possessed both crucial artifacts from the tribulation formation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang scanned Kun Dao's body, but found no storage pouches. Had she found nothing in the medicinal garden?  Considering the unusual details, Qin Sang's suspicions grew, convinced Kun Dao's suicide was unnatural.</p><p>Just then, another roar echoed.</p><p>The sound's origin was unclear – seemingly from the mountaintop, or perhaps the barrier itself.  Though not loud, it was undeniable, carrying immense rage that chilled the heart.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, his brow furrowed.</p><p>…</p><p>The roar disturbed more than just Qin Sang.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang's main body…</p><p>The Poison King, having pursued the illusory body, quickly realized he'd been tricked, sensing the commotion created by Qin Sang's main body in the distance. He turned to leave.  The illusory body served more than just as bait.</p><p>As the Poison King moved, a chilling sensation washed over him. He turned to see a serpent, wreathed in icy flames, lunging through the gale.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>The Poison King's expression darkened. He raised his hands, and the poisonous clouds around him coalesced above his head, meeting the serpent.</p><p>The moment they clashed, the Poison King sensed something was wrong and quickly summoned poisonous sand, firing it at the cloud. The cloud contracted, becoming several times denser.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>The serpent charged into the poisonous cloud.  The cloud vibrated violently, nearly torn apart, but the poisonous sand held it together.  The outer layer of poisonous mist froze into oddly colored ice under the icy flames.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice shattered.  The poisonous sand, with the remaining poisonous cloud, recoiled.</p><p>The Poison King gracefully retreated several dozen meters, his phoenix eyes narrowed as he saw the illusory body return from the gale.</p><p>"A spiritual treasure?"</p><p>The Poison King's first observation was the four-serpent mark on the illusory body's head.  Spiritual treasures in Central Plains were few.</p><p>The Poison King counted them mentally but didn't recognize this one. The records related to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect didn't mention it either.  Although only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, wielding a spiritual treasure made the opponent formidable.</p><p>But why did a mid-Nascent Soul ally suddenly appear beside Qin Sang?</p><p>Recalling the sudden fluctuations he'd sensed near Qin Sang, the Poison King's expression changed.  "This is... your clone? No, an external avatar!"</p><p>The illusory body's aura was perfectly unified, unlike a mere clone.  This explained everything.  This person not only possessed exceptional strength in their main body but also an avatar wielding a spiritual treasure – this alone explained why the rebel fell to him.</p><p>"First a late-Nascent Soul puppet, now an external avatar... this place truly harbors hidden dragons and crouching tigers..."</p><p>The Poison King sighed, laughing.  "Do you think one avatar can stop me?"</p><p>His identity revealed, the avatar made no further pretense, content to converse with the Poison King, buying time for the main body.  "Poison King, why the hostility?"</p><p>"I only ask for a response…"</p><p>The Poison King repeated his offer, promising a great reward.</p><p>"Once this is over, and my main body is free, I'll contact you…"</p><p>The avatar's words were cut short.</p><p>"Since the avatar can't decide, I'll have to ask your main body directly," the Poison King roared, transforming into a streak of light and fleeing.</p><p>The Poison King realized the other party had little interest in returning the Gu King. To stop now was foolish.  Wait for the other party to solve their problems, return triumphant, and then leisurely deal with the Gu King? Or beg for a handout?  Only by creating more trouble could he seize the initiative!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The light just appeared when the serpent struck.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Poison King stopped, feigning retreat, turning to face the avatar and pouncing with even greater speed.</p><p>The avatar was prepared. His eyes were icy white, a bone-chilling white light flashed before him, as he retreated. The icy light formed a barrier, a wall of ice, a precaution regardless of danger.</p><p>The avatar acted with extreme caution, preventing the Poison King from using that moth-like Gu insect, circling at a distance, harassing with the spiritual treasure and icy light, never getting close.  He couldn't stop the Poison King, but he could delay him.</p><p>Until the roar echoed, causing both to pause in surprise.</p>
