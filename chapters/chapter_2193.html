<h1>Chapter 2183: The Hall of Seals</h1><p>“Is this ancient battle armor?”</p><p>Fu Jiang, seeing the armor in Qin Sang’s hands, curiously asked.</p><p>Over this period, he had accepted reality. As long as he and the chieftain remained safe, even being forced to leave the sacred land was better than both perishing.  If Qin Sang kept his promise and exchanged the treasures from the Bi Xie Ancient Hall with the He Gou tribe, it wouldn't be a wasted trip.</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang was curious about. He examined it carefully, shook his head slightly, and said, “It doesn’t seem so!”</p><p>Then, Qin Sang successively infused the armor with true energy and spiritual sense, attempting to activate the treasure, but it was like a stone thrown into the sea, with no response.</p><p>Perhaps because the armor wasn't fully assembled, it clearly lacked other parts, requiring them to overcome each challenge. But Qin Sang felt something strange about this armor; his intuition told him it wasn't battle armor.</p><p>Besides this, there were many unsolved mysteries. For example, what were the thunder crystals after the death of the Thunder Generals, and why could they be integrated into the Golden Page Seal? And what was the relationship between the [unclear character] pearls and these things?</p><p>These questions could probably only be answered by opening the deepest thunder hall.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the armor to Liuli and Fu Jiang; they were equally baffled, unable to discern its nature.</p><p>Putting away the armor, Qin Sang found the vermilion gate leading to the next hall. With a gentle push, he opened it.</p><p>What met their eyes was yet another square courtyard, similar in size to the one outside, but with only two large halls facing them, positioned on the left and right.  Between the two halls was a vermilion gate leading deeper inside.</p><p>Simultaneously, they sensed fluctuations in the thunderclouds.</p><p>“Huh? There are only two Thunder Generals here?”</p><p>After the previous battle, Liuli and Fu Jiang were no longer as afraid of the Thunder Generals; they even considered using them later to hone their divine abilities.</p><p>What was strange was that the previous hall had three Thunder Generals guarding it, while this one only had two, and the spirit array in the courtyard seemed to be the same as the one outside.</p><p>Logically, the difficulty should increase the further they went.</p><p>“Something’s amiss!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, looking up at the thunderclouds, but without engaging in combat, nobody knew the Thunder Generals' true abilities.</p><p>After the last battle, they had discovered some patterns, and felt more reassured.</p><p>Even if they couldn't defeat the Thunder Generals, as long as they adopted a defensive stance and persevered for a while without being killed, there was still a way out. They could then open the vermilion gate and retreat, avoiding being trapped forever.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang thought that provoking the Thunder Generals left only two options: life or death, with no turning back. He guessed this place was a forbidden area of an ancient Daoist sect, where trespassers would die.</p><p>After discovering this pattern, he thought otherwise. He suspected it was an opportunity intentionally left behind by the ancestors of the Yi Ren tribe, though these treasures had origins connected to the ancient Daoist sect.</p><p>When leaving behind trials, the Yi Ren ancestors often showed mercy. Therefore, in the sacred land's secret realms and hidden tombs, many seemingly dead ends always had a way out.</p><p>Qin Sang remained skeptical about the effectiveness of such trials. However, the Yi Ren tribe's ability to become one of the dominant forces in the East Sea, with its many powerful individuals, certainly had some connection to the sacred land.</p><p>To determine the peculiarity of this level, they decided to try. The three of them recovered their energy on the spot, and then immediately crossed the threshold.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Lightning struck from the heavens, transforming into Thunder Generals, issuing their familiar warning.</p><p>The following scene was largely similar to before—the Thunder Generals attacked, the spirit array was activated, and silver mist filled the surroundings.</p><p>However, after engaging in combat, Qin Sang immediately noticed a difference. The two Thunder Generals before him had the same divine abilities and cultivation as the previous ones, but they possessed the ability to fight together.</p><p>Upon the first contact, Qin Sang nearly suffered a setback. Fortunately, he was prepared and reacted quickly, preventing himself from losing his composure.</p><p>Two Thunder Generals comparable to the late stage of the Refinement Void realm, capable of combined attacks, were far more powerful than a simple sum of their individual strengths. They were no easier to deal with than the previous three Thunder Generals.</p><p>Qin Sang used various techniques to stabilize his position, and the corpse cultivator Min Zhuo, Liuli, and Fu Jiang seized an opportunity to join the battle.</p><p>Silver mist swirled, and the battlefield was in chaos.</p><p>Seven figures clashed constantly, indistinguishable from each other  attempting to divide the two Thunder Generals.</p><p>But the two Thunder Generals’ coordination was too tight, and every strike was incredibly powerful. Liuli and the others could only evade their attacks. Qin Sang tried several times but failed to separate them. He then sent out his phantom body, which wielded the Gray Warbler Sword, intending to find an opportunity to trap one of them with a sword array.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang grasped the pattern of the Thunder Generals' attacks. His phantom body immediately activated the sword technique.  With a flash of sword light, one Thunder General vanished into thin air. The other Thunder General, enraged, turned towards the sword array, and Qin Sang's main body used the Sun Wheel Seal to block the front.</p><p>Liuli and the others didn't hesitate, charging into the sword array to support Qin Sang.  With their combined attack, they successfully killed the Thunder General trapped in the array, and then turned to eliminate the remaining one.</p><p>This lone thunder general, despite fierce resistance, was overwhelmed and nearing defeat.  The situation looked promising, yet a sudden unease settled over the group.  They all instinctively looked towards the thunderclouds.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A lightning bolt struck, momentarily blinding them.</p><p>“No good! Kill it!”</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Grey Oriole Sword, attacked repeatedly, but was a step too slow. The lightning reformed into a new thunder general, joining the battle.</p><p>With this reinforcement, the thunder generals renewed their assault, shattering Qin Sang's group's offensive.</p><p>“So that’s it!  We can’t just defeat them one by one. We must kill one within a certain timeframe!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, yet remained calm. If they could separate them once, they could do it again.</p><p>They repeated their tactic, eliminating one thunder general while focusing all their might on the other, successfully defeating it before a new one could be summoned.</p><p>The silver mist dissipated. Qin Sang opened the two large halls.  As expected, they contained more parts of the armor: two skirt plates.</p><p>Their objective in the Thunder Hall became clear: collect a complete suit of armor.  Armor styles varied greatly; there was no standard design.  No one knew how many pieces were in the Thunder Hall, but based on the parts Qin Sang had collected—boots, leg armor, and skirt plates—in that order, the final piece was likely a helmet and crest.</p><p>Qin Sang's curiosity about the armor grew, but the deeper they went, the stronger the thunder generals became. He wasn't confident he could obtain all the pieces at once, so he decided to proceed step by step.</p><p>After a rest, they pressed on.</p><p>The next challenge was again guarded by two thunder generals.  They were masters of combined attacks and used spirit formations to adapt to their opponents' moves, causing significant difficulties.</p><p>The group proceeded cautiously, testing the generals' defenses, for the Fu clan leader was nearing awakening. After an hour, they retreated to the previous courtyard, where the Fu clan leader was waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang described the battle in detail.  They devised a new strategy and attacked again, succeeding without a hitch. This time, Qin Sang acquired the breastplate and tail pieces.</p><p>The lower half of the armor was nearly complete.</p><p>With renewed vigor, they continued, facing progressively harder challenges.</p><p>The thunder generals themselves didn't change; sometimes their numbers increased, sometimes the power of their spirit formations was amplified, and their combined attacks were astonishing.</p><p>If it were only Qin Sang, he couldn't have gone this far. Even with Liuli and the others, they were increasingly strained.</p><p>Over time, Qin Sang acquired more pieces: waist protector, belly armor, breastplate, shoulder armor, arm guards, arm protectors, gauntlets, and a neck guard—protecting every part of the body except the head.</p><p>The final pieces, the head armor, were next.  They didn't know how many pieces it comprised, nor how many halls remained.  The thunder generals’ strength was nearing their limits.</p><p>Another vermilion gate blocked their path.</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions stood before it, not opening it immediately. They had just rested, and their expressions were serious.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng," the Fu clan leader cautioned, "in my judgment, even with our full assistance, we can probably only manage one more challenge. Unless the helmet is a single piece, it will be extremely difficult to obtain all the parts."</p><p>Qin Sang saw this as well, without needing the Fu clan leader to point it out. The central Thunder Hall was clearly visible, and reaching it would undoubtedly require more than one or two challenges.</p><p>The armor pieces were fragmented along the way, and the helmet pieces would likely be similarly divided, making it difficult for them to obtain.  Knowing this, Qin Sang couldn't give up now that they had come this far.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing, simply thanking everyone, his tone firm.</p><p>"I can seize the opportunity to unseal the Emperor's Conscript Talisman," Liuli transmitted through voice communication.</p><p>"No need to rush,"</p><p>Qin Sang responded, also through voice communication. Unsealing the talisman was precious and needed to be reserved for critical moments. They hadn't reached the Heart Lake yet, and it was best to conserve it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Besides Liuli, the Fu clan leader, as the head of his clan, possessed considerable power.  Now recovered from his injuries, he could unleash his strength, briefly achieving the power comparable to a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"I'll open the door..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at everyone, pushing open the vermilion gate.</p><p>He was clad in the Ming Mountain Armor, supporting the Five Elements Crown in one hand, and holding a spirit tablet in the other. Sword light swirled around him, and the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock floated above his head.  Except for the Yunyou Sword and the unseen Tianmu Butterfly, he had displayed all his abilities.</p><p>He had already planned to send the Fu clan leader out of the sacred place; otherwise, he wouldn't have revealed so many of his capabilities to outsiders.</p><p>Having witnessed Qin Sang's true strength, the Fu clan leader and Fu Jiang felt no resentment. Even at their peak, they would have likely faced the same outcome. His strength was comparable to the top experts of the Water and Sky Divisions.</p><p>Qin Sang, even with his considerable strength, wasn't confident in overcoming the Thunder Palace.  It was unclear for whom these trials were intended.</p><p>Stepping across the threshold, three bolts of lightning struck from the heavens, the ground shook violently, and silver mist surged.</p><p>Immediately, a fierce battle erupted.  The group expertly shifted formations, with Qin Sang and the Fú Clan Chief leading the charge against the Thunder Generals, facing the initial, brutal onslaught.</p><p>Though only three Thunder Generals were visible, the spirit array beneath their feet possessed endless variations, making them incredibly difficult to defend against. Moreover, additional lightning bolts continued to descend from the heavens as the battle progressed.</p><p>As the Fú Clan Chief predicted, they managed to slay the Thunder Generals, but they were pushed to their limits.</p><p>The Fú Clan Chief used a powerful bloodline technique, paying a significant price and requiring time to recover.</p><p>Fú Jiang’s face was pale, a bloody hole in his left shoulder, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow from a thunder spear.</p><p>Liuli remained unharmed, but faced extreme danger, skillfully escaping thanks to her and Qin Sang's quick thinking.</p><p>Opening the palace doors, Qin Sang sighed upon seeing the contents within, "It's a faceplate."</p><p>As expected, the helmet was also fragmented into several pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the Thunder Palace, seemingly close yet presenting insurmountable challenges.</p><p>Liuli and the others meditated to recover, while Qin Sang approached the vermilion gate alone, releasing Xie Tianjiao.</p><p>Xie Tianjiao, imprisoned and silenced since his capture, finally spoke, pleading repeatedly, "I was blind and foolish, cultivation is difficult. I beg Daoist Qingfeng to show mercy. I am willing to…"</p><p>Before he could finish, he screamed, as Qin Sang shoved him through the vermilion gate.</p><p>"If you live through this, I'll spare your life!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, then closed his eyes, focusing his senses.</p><p>After a short time, Qin Sang shook his head slightly.  His perception was severed, but he had a general idea of the next trial.</p><p>Ji Xia, the Yuanxiang Clan Chief, and others remained missing.  Given their strength, without the Yunyou Sword, passing this trial was impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, standing motionless, lost in thought.</p><p>Liuli and the others finished their meditation and, seeing Qin Sang remain there, waited patiently, not daring to disturb him.</p><p>'Rumble… rumble…'</p><p>Loud booms echoed from outside, not thunder from the storm clouds, but vibrations in the void itself.</p><p>Everyone understood—the radiant light was assaulting the barrier between the silent space and the sacred land. The storm clouds were turbulent, suggesting the radiant light could breach the barrier at any moment, sweeping across the area.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, activating a golden page marking, returning to the sacred land.</p><p>Instantly, radiant light filled his vision, a sword shadow striking him head-on.</p><p>The island outside was devastated. The mountain where the hut stood trembled, the hut itself collapsed, its spirit array exposed and teetering under the assault of the radiant light.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang casually deflected the sword shadow, a plan forming in his mind, returning to the Thunder Palace.</p><p>He gathered everyone, using his true energy to create a diagram. He turned to the Fú Clan Chief, "Fú Clan Chief, can you discern the pattern in this drawing?"</p><p>The Fú Clan Chief examined it closely, finding it familiar, realizing that it depicted the palace complex.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't sketched the outlines of the palaces, but rather marked key points: the location of each palace, and the position of each Thunder General within the storm clouds before their appearance.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>The Fú Clan Chief quickly noticed something, glancing back, "This seems to be a large array?"</p><p>"Precisely! The entire palace is an array! And there…"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the most prominent Thunder Palace, "…is the eye of the array!"</p><p>Liuli and Fú Jiang also understood, Fú Jiang exclaiming, "This seems to be a sealing array?"</p><p>A meticulously crafted array, with numerous Thunder Generals at the Nascent Soul stage—what exactly was sealed within?</p><p>They also grasped Qin Sang’s intention: since each palace was a part of the array, they could wait for the radiant light to break it for them.</p>
