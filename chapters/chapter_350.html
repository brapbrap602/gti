Chapter 343:  At a Loss

Qin Sang had planned to inquire about the Ziwei Palace from fellow disciples upon returning to her sect.  Yun Youzi's words only strengthened her resolve to investigate thoroughly.

The two discussed the Ziwei Palace for a while longer. Qin Sang used her spiritual energy to conjure an image of the Ziwei Secret Realm and showed it to Yun Youzi.

"Senior, do you have any plans for your next destination?" Qin Sang asked.

Due to a hidden soul injury, Yun Youzi was stuck at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, unable to break through despite intense cultivation. He needed to find a way to address his current predicament.

Yun Youzi nodded. "I have two options, neither of which is easy. I haven't decided where to go yet.  My reasons for coming to Yinshan Pass are twofold: to investigate the Ziwei Secret Realm, and to gather necessary items.  Qin Sang, you may not know this, but Yinshan Pass, due to its unique location, attracts cultivators from all walks of life—neither righteous nor demonic.  Rare items often appear here. If you have the time in the future, you should visit several times."

Yun Youzi had been traversing the Ancient Immortal Battlefield since the Qi Condensation stage, so he was well-traveled and knowledgeable.

Qin Sang thought of the You Luo Cloud and nodded in agreement. This flying artifact was extremely useful; it would be impossible to acquire such a thing so easily elsewhere.

"Senior, please don't hesitate to ask if you need anything." Qin Sang said.

She and Yun Youzi were kindred spirits in a way. Seeing Yun Youzi's arduous journey for treatment, Qin Sang felt empathy. Given their friendship forged in the Qiuhong Market, she wouldn't hesitate to help.

Yun Youzi bowed and smiled. "Then I thank you in advance, Brother Qin."

Qin Sang waved her hand. "I need to ask for your help first.  I don't know if Manager Pu has mentioned it to you, but a close friend of mine is severely injured, his primordial spirit on the verge of dissipation…"

Qin Sang briefly explained Tan Jie's condition.

Unable to assess Tan Jie's condition without seeing him, the two set off outside the city.

Tan Hao was anxiously waiting in his cave abode. Upon seeing Yun Youzi arrive, he quickly stepped forward, bowing deeply. "Junior Tan Hao greets the Daoist Master. Thank you for your assistance."

For years, Tan Hao had used an alias; he only used his real name in front of Qin Sang.

"Daoist Tan, please don't stand on ceremony."

Yun Youzi supported Tan Hao. "Though my medical skills are humble, at Brother Qin's request, and in appreciation of Daoist Tan's unwavering loyalty, I will do my utmost.  Let's see your brother without delay."

"Please, Daoist Master and Brother Qin…"

Tan Hao hurriedly stepped aside, inviting them into the cave abode.

Inside the spacious tree hollow, a crystal coffin rested on a wooden bed. Tan Jie lay within, still showing no signs of waking.

"Hmm? This artifact is quite good."

Yun Youzi's eyes lit up upon seeing the crystal coffin, offering a casual comment before focusing his attention on Tan Jie, carefully observing his complexion.

After observing for a while, Yun Youzi gently opened the crystal coffin, his eyes half-closed as he probed Tan Jie's body and, most importantly, his primordial spirit with his spiritual sense.

Silence filled the cave abode.

Qin Sang and Tan Hao dared not disturb Yun Youzi, standing silently to the side.

Tan Hao's hands were clasped tightly together, his eyes fixed on Yun Youzi. His intense nervousness was evident in his gaze.

After a moment, Yun Youzi opened his eyes, closed the crystal coffin, glanced at Tan Hao with a look of compassion, and shook his head slightly at Qin Sang.

Qin Sang's heart sank.

Tan Hao gritted his teeth, his voice hoarse. "Daoist Master, whatever the outcome, just tell me straight!"

Qin Sang also nodded to Yun Youzi, signaling him to speak freely.

Tan Hao, devoted to his comatose brother for forty years, had certainly been tempered by hardship; he could bear any outcome.

Yun Youzi spoke frankly.

"My assessment may not be accurate, but it's for your reference.

Daoist Tan Jie's condition is precarious, as you've likely noticed.

His primordial spirit is extremely weak, on the verge of dissipation.  Unless there's a legendary immortal elixir, I can't think of a way to cure him.

Even if you gather many Tranquil Spirit Pills, it won't delay the inevitable for long—perhaps a year or two at most… Daoist Tan, you must prepare yourself!"

Yun Youzi's tone was heavy.

Qin Sang sighed inwardly; her assessment was similar to Yun Youzi's.

Tan Jie was at the end of his life; even if a soul-healing elixir could be found, it was unlikely to be effective.

Upon hearing Yun Youzi's words, the last of Tan Hao's hope shattered. His body trembled violently, his arms supporting the crystal coffin as he stared at Tan Jie within, his eyes bloodshot but tearless.

After a long moment, suppressing the sadness in his eyes, he spoke in a relatively calm voice.  "Thank you for your efforts, Brother Qin and Daoist Master.  I… had a premonition, but I didn't want to believe it. It's my fault for being too weak, for failing him…"

Tan Hao's hand clutched the crystal coffin, his knuckles white, his voice filled with self-reproach and regret.


Yun Youzi stood up and exchanged a few words with Qin Sang through voice transmission. He left behind two prescriptions, both for nourishing the soul.  Remarkably, the required herbs were inexpensive, and while the effect was modest, it would likely extend Tan Jie's life by a few months.

But what meaning did those few months hold?

Yun Youzi sighed, shaking his head sadly. "Brother Qin, I've also rented a cave dwelling nearby, waiting for the auction. I won't disturb you further.  While I was examining him, I used a secret technique to help Daoist Tan Jie.  With a couple more treatments over the next few days, perhaps we can buy him some more time…"

Seeing Yun Youzi's weariness, Qin Sang quickly escorted him back to his cave for rest.

After seeing Yun Youzi off, Qin Sang returned to Tan Hao's cave.  Witnessing Tan Hao's deep grief, he hesitated for a moment before carefully broaching the idea he'd been considering.

"Brother Tan, I know of another secret technique that might prevent Tan Jie's soul from dissipating, but it comes at a very heavy price. A price that may be unbearable… Would you be willing to consider it?"

"What technique?"

Tan Hao abruptly looked up, seizing Qin Sang's arm with intense emotion, like a drowning man grasping at a lifeline.  "Brother Qin, I'll pay any price! As long as it helps Tan Jie, I'm willing to die!"

"Brother Tan, please calm down. Let me explain.  This price isn't for you, but for Tan Jie.

"If we use this technique, no one can predict what will happen to Tan Jie. He may never find peace.

"Furthermore, this technique only seals Tan Jie's soul, maintaining its current state and preventing further dissipation. It won't cure him.

"Brother Tan, please consider this carefully before making a decision…"

What Qin Sang referred to was using the Heavenly Corpse Talisman to seal Tan Jie's soul.

Years ago, his senior sister Qing Ting searched for this talisman; Qin Sang suspected it was for this very purpose.  Seeing Tan Jie's condition, he immediately thought of this method.
