<h1>Chapter 1936: Seeking Medical Aid</h1><p>Mingyue.</p><p>A common name, yet one Qin Sang could never forget.</p><p>How distant a memory it was.</p><p>The image of a young Daoist boy surfaced before Qin Sang's eyes, still vivid as ever.</p><p>Mingyue, who brought him a small wooden stool and examined his injured leg. Mingyue, overjoyed when Silentheart Daoist decided to keep him. Mingyue, filled with admiration as he diverted the stream to the Daoist temple. Mingyue, drooling at the sight of him roasting meat. Mingyue, feasting with him in the city. Mingyue, diligently studying the Dao, medicine, and martial arts. Mingyue, soaking with him in a medicinal bath. Mingyue, alongside Silentheart Daoist, healing and saving lives…</p><p>It was a pity that his abrupt departure back then had become an eternal farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang gently rubbed the Thousand Jun Ring. The painting that Mingyue had personally drawn, he had always kept it.</p><p>The person in the painting was none other than himself, a single image capturing that joyous period of time.</p><p>He hadn't witnessed it firsthand, yet he could imagine Mingyue's expression as she held the brush and painted.</p><p>The time spent at Green Ram Temple was filled with pure and genuine emotions.</p><p>It was also the one brief, rare period of tranquility and serenity in Qin Sang's long life. How could he ever forget?</p><p>Everyone watched Qin Sang, puzzled by his sudden pause and the nostalgic expression on his face after asking the question, remaining silent for a long while.</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized the youth before him.</p><p>Many in the world were named Mingyue.</p><p>Yet, for some unknown reason, this youth alone had dredged up the memories of Mingyue buried deep within his heart.</p><p>Was it because of that untainted, childlike innocence?</p><p>Based on Vermillion Bird's description and his own observations, though he didn't understand the full story, Qin Sang could make a fairly accurate guess.</p><p>The youth dared to hunt demonic beasts with a mortal body to avenge his teacher, and dared to argue his case before cultivators. His courage was commendable.</p><p>Was that all?</p><p>Oh, this youth's talent was unremarkable.</p><p>Three Spiritual Roots: Metal, Fire, and Wood.</p><p>But even exceptional talent wouldn't move Qin Sang. The vast world was boundless, with countless mortals. A Heavenly Spiritual Root might take some time to find, but if Qin Sang sought Dual Spiritual Roots, it wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>Moreover, with Qin Sang's current abilities, even with the dismal talent of Five Spiritual Roots, he was confident he could forcefully propel someone to the Nascent Soul realm. The path to God Transformation might be challenging, but achievable.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his experiences since descending the mountain. Perhaps he had lived too long; no matter what he encountered, it always evoked thoughts of old friends and past events, unveiling dust-covered memories.</p><p>Wandering aimlessly after descending the mountain, finding peace wherever he went, this carefree attitude unknowingly mirrored his state of mind at Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Touched time and time again, had he subconsciously been seeking a vessel for that memory?</p><p>This youth had appeared, and his name happened to be Mingyue.</p><p>Perhaps this was destiny… Qin Sang mused.</p><p>“I’ve been called Mingyue ever since I can remember. It was the name my parents gave me. My teacher said he would give me a courtesy name when I come of age,” the youth answered honestly, his expression revealing deep sorrow and resentment when mentioning his teacher.</p><p>The two Immortal Cultivators who had been so arrogant moments ago now knelt on the ground, trembling.</p><p>Yet, the youth would never forget the scene he had just witnessed.</p><p>“What is your surname?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Qin,” the youth replied.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, then chuckled. It truly was fate!</p><p>“Are you willing to cultivate with me?” Qin Sang stopped pondering the what-ifs, choosing to follow his heart and act on instinct.</p><p>These words not only startled Daoist Jingchun, but also Vermillion Bird.</p><p>Luo Hou and Taiyi were both surprised and envious.</p><p>“Are you crazy?!” Vermillion Bird couldn't comprehend it. They had merely watched a play, how did Qin Sang end up with a disciple?  Throughout their travels, Qin Sang had never shown any intention of taking on a student.</p><p>“Just because his surname is Qin? This village seems to be called Qin Village. Everyone here is surnamed Qin. Why don't you just take them all and establish a Qin Family Temple?”</p><p>Vermillion Bird flew in front of Qin Sang, staring with wide, round eyes, trying to discern his thoughts, only to be flicked away by Qin Sang's finger.</p><p>These words further shocked everyone present, leaving them speechless in disbelief.  Silence filled the air.</p><p>The two kneeling cultivators fell into deep despair.</p><p>The precepts of the Xinhuo Sect wouldn't take their lives.</p><p>But they had offended the disciple of a great power, a power even Daoist Jingchun addressed as Senior!</p><p>If their master found out, not only would he not plead for them, he would probably expel them from the sect first.</p><p>The youth himself was completely stunned.</p><p>Seeing the youth dazed and bewildered, the old village chief, exasperated, reached out his large hand and pressed the boy's head to the ground. "Hurry up and kowtow to your Master!"</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>A solid kowtow pulled the youth out of his stupor.</p><p>“Will I have to leave home to cultivate?”</p><p>“I travel the world. If you cultivate with me, naturally, you must leave here. Moreover, there’s a distinction between mortals and immortals. One day, you will have to sever ties with the mortal world.”</p><p>“A distinction between mortals and immortals,” the youth murmured, repeating these words. Suddenly, he looked at the two kneeling figures. “After cultivating, will I also possess the power of immortals?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew what the youth truly wanted to ask. “They are not immortals, only cultivators. I am the same, only my cultivation is higher than theirs.  They can bully mortals at will, and cultivators stronger than them can treat them the same way. That is how the world is.”</p><p>“The world!” The youth clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t elaborate further. The youth was intelligent and could grasp his meaning.  There must be many cultivators in the world who, like him, harbored sincere hearts. But how many could maintain their original intentions? After experiencing hardship, most would eventually learn to protect themselves and nothing more.</p><p>Besides, could this kind of world truly be changed?</p><p>Perhaps even mighty Grand Completion cultivators could only reshape a small portion of it for a limited time.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, I have the honor of witnessing such a fortuitous event.”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun also sensed the situation and interjected tactfully, “Young Daoist friend has turned misfortune into blessing. Your future will surely be boundless.  Rest assured and follow the Daoist Master to cultivate. The Xinhuo Sect will protect Qin Village and will not allow anyone to harm it in the slightest!”</p><p>He then swept a sharp gaze over the two before him.</p><p>“These two acted recklessly and violated the law. They will not be spared!”</p><p>The youth looked back at the villagers and found a woman in the crowd.</p><p>The woman was his teacher’s wife.  After her husband’s death, she had been deeply affected, her health frail, and she was bedridden.  During the recent upheaval, she had managed to walk out, supporting herself against the wall.</p><p>Upon seeing the youth sprawled on the ground, she had nearly collapsed from anxiety, but fortunately, Daoist Jingchun's appearance had resolved the situation.</p><p>Supported by others, the teacher's wife's panic and anxiety hadn't yet subsided.</p><p>Seeing Mingyue looking over, his teacher’s wife urged him repeatedly, “Mingyue, hurry and pay respects to your Master.  You will have a bright future.  Your teacher, knowing this in the afterlife, will surely be happy for you.  Your teacher’s wife has so many people to care for her, you needn't worry.”</p><p>Tears welled up in the youth’s eyes.  He no longer hesitated and kowtowed deeply. “Disciple pays respects to Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, pondered for a moment, and said, “Today, I, on behalf of your teacher, bestow upon you the courtesy name Yulang.  From now on, you shall be known as Yulang, both as your courtesy name and Daoist name.”</p><p>A virtuous character like jade, as bright as the moon.</p><p>“Yulang, a good name! A good Daoist name! Senior taking on a disciple under the governance of my Xinhuo Sect is also a great blessing for the Xinhuo Sect, and must be celebrated!  Senior and fellow Daoist friends, please grace my sect with your presence, allow me to express my humble gratitude…”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun was even more enthusiastic than Qin Sang, the master himself.</p><p>“Cultivators don’t have so many formalities,” Qin Sang shook his head, handing Qin Yulang a jade bottle and transmitting his voice, “These pills can regulate Qi and blood, prolong life, and enhance longevity. Bid farewell to your family and friends properly. I will await you where you slew the demon.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang and the others flickered and vanished from the villagers’ sight, leaving behind a regretful Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>"Are you really taking on a disciple?"</p><p>Vermillion Bird still hadn't figured it out and continued to question him after they landed on a mountaintop.</p><p>"I simply wanted to take on a disciple, to give Little Five a junior brother for company, is that alright?" Qin Sang ruffled Little Five's hair.</p><p>Images of Li Yufu, Mei Gu, Bai Hanqiu, Shen Chen… flashed through his mind.</p><p>Were they well?</p><p>Little Five nodded repeatedly, smiling brightly.</p><p>“Why not find a genius with a Heavenly Spiritual Root? This guy… although young, he has courage, strategy, which is not bad. His character seems upright, he understands respect for his master…”</p><p>Vermillion Bird glanced down at the traces of the trap below, muttering to herself, more worried than Qin Sang, the master himself.</p><p>“Are you evaluating someone else’s character?” Qin Sang laughed, his mood uplifted after taking on a disciple.</p><p>Vermillion Bird flew into a rage. “Just you wait, I may not be able to beat you, but I can certainly beat your disciple!”</p><p>Less than a stick of incense later, a figure ran up the mountain path. It was Yulang.</p><p>He carried a bundle almost as large as himself. Fortunately, he had trained in martial arts, otherwise he would have been crushed by it.</p><p>Seeing the figures on the mountain, Yulang felt a lightness beneath his feet as a gentle breeze lifted him up, depositing him before Qin Sang, still panting.</p><p>“Master,” Yulang set down the bundle and bowed respectfully, producing a short sword, looking uneasy.  “This was a gift from Daoist Jingchun. Disciple didn’t dare to accept it, but…”</p><p>“Since it’s Daoist Jingchun’s goodwill, keep it.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it. It was a decent top-grade magical artifact. Daoist Jingchun knew his boundaries.</p><p>“Let me introduce you…”</p><p>Qin Sang introduced his disciple to everyone.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Vermillion Bird, Senior Luo Hou, Senior Taiyi, Senior Sister…”</p><p>Yulang bowed to each one, his demeanor respectful.</p><p>Vermillion Bird was pleased and no longer mentioned bullying Qin Sang’s disciple.  She even presented a welcoming gift.</p><p>During their travels slaying demons and eliminating evils, Vermillion Bird had pocketed quite a few good items.</p><p>Taiyi and Luo Hou also offered gifts. Qin Sang presented Little Five’s gift on her behalf and also produced a storage artifact, packed the miscellaneous items inside, and handed it to Yulang.</p><p>Before even embarking on the path of cultivation, Yulang had already amassed considerable wealth.</p><p>Recalling the hardships of his own early cultivation days, Qin Sang couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>Vermillion Bird's smugness didn't last long. She soon reverted to her role as a mount, grumbling and complaining.</p><p>Flying in the sky, Yulang was filled with both wonder and apprehension, sitting stiffly, afraid to move.</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated how to instruct his new disciple.</p><p>Having taken on a student on a whim, he only began to consider these things afterwards.</p><p>Entering the Dao wasn't difficult. He could choose any basic cultivation method from the Metal, Fire, or Wood categories.</p><p>The path forward, however, required careful consideration.</p><p>He possessed numerous inheritances. Not to mention his own cultivation methods, just the Wood element alone included the complete inheritance of the Wood Phase lineage from the Formless Immortal Sect, which seemed quite suitable for Yulang.</p><p>The Talisman Dao of the Dao Court was also a possibility.</p><p>As the Lord Emissary of the Five Thunders Court, wielding the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal, he was qualified to establish an altar and transmit the Dao without going through the Divine Court.</p><p>Daoist techniques had existed before the emergence of the Divine Court and Dao Court.</p><p>However, he could only transmit Thunder techniques within the scope of his own cultivation and couldn't utilize the power of the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't make a decision immediately.  Teaching required adapting to the student's aptitude, and he didn't understand his disciple well enough yet.</p><p>“Take this ‘Willow Whispering Heart Sutra’ and contemplate it for now,” Qin Sang wrote the scriptures on paper and briefly explained their meaning.</p><p>Yulang was literate, which saved a lot of trouble.</p><p>While Qin Sang explained the scriptures, Taiyi and Luo Hou listened attentively. Unfortunately, the content of the scriptures was too elementary, and a Void Refinement cultivator couldn't make them sound profound. There wasn't anything that could enlighten them.</p><p>The group rode Vermillion Bird, flying over mountains and rivers.</p><p>They were getting closer and closer to the main altar.</p><p>Taiyi, who had been looking down at the mountains and rivers below, seemed to recognize a landmark. "Lord Emissary, we are approaching the Yan Kingdom."</p><p>“The Yan Kingdom is one of the most powerful nations.  The Yan Kingdom and the surrounding countries can be considered the heart of all nations, rich in resources, strong in national power, with people living in peace and prosperity.  When I first left my cave dwelling and traveled abroad, I journeyed from those small border countries to the Yan Kingdom, which truly broadened my horizons. I still remember it now.  I wonder if the Yan Kingdom has changed dynasties…”</p><p>Taiyi sighed.</p><p>“Did you not find a Thunder Altar nearby?”</p><p>Taiyi pointed towards his cave dwelling.  “I only found the ruins of a Thunder Altar in the Great Liang Kingdom, east of the Yan Kingdom. Unfortunately, my knowledge is limited, and I can’t distinguish between a branch altar and a main altar.  I also suspect that the Yan Kingdom and other countries, being situated at the heart of all nations, might have something special about them. Unfortunately, I found nothing.”</p><p>“Are there no cultivators near the Yan Kingdom who practice the Thunder techniques of the Dao Court?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“I haven’t found any,” Taiyi shook his head.</p><p>The branch altars all left behind inheritances, yet the main altar had none.</p><p>It seemed he could only rely on his own search, Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>“The main altar must be within the Yan Kingdom.  The Thunder Altar in Great Liang is definitely not the main altar.  With such severe damage, there’s no need to go there!”</p><p>This time, Qin Sang could narrow the search area down to within a single prefecture. With everyone searching together, if the main altar had left behind any traces, they would surely find it!</p><p>“What a large river!”</p><p>Yulang clutched Vermillion Bird’s feathers, gazing at the ground below, his face full of wonder.  He had gradually become more comfortable with everyone, no longer as taciturn as he was at first.</p><p>“Let’s go down and have a look!”</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang spoke, Vermillion Bird immediately shook everyone off, complaining incessantly, “This Vermillion Bird is exhausted!”</p><p>“This is the Ping River, flowing from Great Liang,”  Taiyi, revisiting the familiar place, still remembered some details.</p><p>Everyone landed, and Qin Sang sat down on the ground. He needed to make one last deduction, narrowing the search area as much as possible.</p><p>For three days and nights, Qin Sang remained motionless.</p><p>On the evening of the third day, Qin Sang stood up. “Let’s go!  Let’s pay a visit to the River God of the Ping River.”</p><p>Utilizing the terrain and water veins could also aid his judgment. Although countless years might have brought changes to the landscape, perhaps some vestiges remained.</p><p>The River God Temple was located within the Yan Kingdom, not on this stretch of the river.  The group soared through the clouds, flying along the river’s surface.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after flying for a while, before they found the deity of the water palace, they made a peculiar discovery.</p><p>Something on the river surface shimmered in the sunlight.</p><p>Despite being called the Ping River, its waters were not calm at all.  The shimmering object turned out to be a piece of ice, drifting on the river’s surface.</p><p>Within the ice block was a person, like a frozen corpse!</p>
