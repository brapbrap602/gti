Chapter 476: Speculation


Qin Sang hesitated.  "With Senior Qingzhu's strength, to have fallen there... that place must be extremely dangerous. I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage..."


"Qingzhu's death was due to other causes. However, that place is located within an ancient hall in the inner palace of Ziwei Palace.  Naturally, it's dangerous. If you're afraid of death..."


Mid-sentence, Granny Jing abruptly paused, turning to look outside the hall.  She seemed to have noticed something, her brow furrowing.  After a moment's thought, she pointed to the handsome young man Qin Sang was carrying, asking, "What do you plan to do with this person?"


"I..."


Qin Sang opened his mouth to speak.


Before he could answer, Granny Jing shook her head. "I don't care what you intend. Let me warn you, this person's identity is not simple. If you don't want to be implicated, you'd better not take him out of Zhitian Peak, not even his body.  Including the few magical artifacts and talismans on him—they're unique, belonging only to the Yuanshen Sect."


Qin Sang nodded gravely. "Senior, don't worry, I understand the risks. But the spatial storm caused by the Palm Star Elder is across from us, and Zhitian Peak will be sealed in less than half an hour. Will we make it in time?"


"Don't worry. Though the plaza's spirit formation is damaged, the remaining array is enough to stabilize the space and smooth out the spatial storm.  As long as we can open this door..."


Granny Jing looked down at the stone platform, her fingers dancing as she sent out several streams of spiritual energy, landing them on the stone platform at her feet.


As the runes on the stone platform lit up, the entire hall began to shake.


It trembled violently like an earthquake, intensifying steadily. Strong light emanated from the stone pillars surrounding the hall; each pillar top held a mid-grade spirit stone.


A beam of light shot from each pillar towards the stone platform, converging above Qin Sang and the others.


Qin Sang quickly looked up and saw, where the lights met, an exceptionally pure eight-sided crystal, suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating.


The crystal was neither too large nor too small; one could barely grasp it in a single hand. It seemed to be absorbing the power of the pillars, growing brighter and brighter.


The runes on the stone platform and the crystal were connected by a beam of light, a strange power flowing down, revealing a hidden door on the stone platform. The light emitted by the crystal converged in front of the door.


Once it reached a certain point, Granny Jing pointed at the crystal, and all the changes abruptly stopped.


Granny Jing nodded slightly, muttering, "As expected, the appearance of Zhitian Peak activates this restriction... Wait a quarter of an hour for the spatial storm on the other side to subside, then open this door and leave.  Stay in the hall during this time, don't touch the crystal, and don't leave. The space of this immortal mansion is even more unstable than Zhitian Peak. If you can't suppress your cultivation, you'll meet the same fate as the Palm Star Elder. The same goes when you return to Zhitian Peak; it's best not to use the Void Thunder there..."


"Think it over. Before the opening of Ziwei Palace, wait for me at Xuanlu Pass..."


With that, Granny Jing leaped off the stone platform. Her white clothes fluttered as she vanished with incredible speed, reaching the exit in the blink of an eye.


Qin Sang hadn't expected Granny Jing to leave so abruptly.  Urgently, he called out to her, "Senior, no need to consider it, I'll go!"


If Ziwei Palace was as Granny Jing described, once inside the inner palace, as long as he was careful, he should be fine.


As for where Senior Qingzhu died and how dangerous it truly was, he needed to see it for himself.


This trip to Ziwei Palace, even if he couldn't obtain Senior Qingzhu's cultivation techniques, he could scout the way, gaining experience for next time, making it much easier when Ziwei Palace opened again.


Besides, Granny Jing was elusive, and this might be his only chance. He might regret it forever if he missed it.


This trip was essential.


Qin Sang spoke rapidly, feigning concern, "I heard that those of us with insufficient cultivation need a token to enter Ziwei Palace. Tokens are extremely rare and difficult to obtain. I wonder if I could possibly..."


Granny Jing paused slightly, turning to look deeply at Qin Sang before waving her hand, sending something flying before she disappeared.


Qin Sang caught it; his palm felt something soft.


Upon unfolding it, it was indeed a piece of sheepskin, almost identical to his own.


Holding the sheepskin, Qin Sang pondered, "I wonder if Yunyouzi obtained any heavenly treasures? Has he recovered from his injuries? Will he still enter Ziwei Palace?"


Even if Yunyouzi didn't need it, selling it would fetch a good price.


Putting away the sheepskin, Qin Sang recalled his recent encounters and observations, falling into deep thought.


He had a nagging feeling that this immortal mansion held a deeper secret, but the barrage of information from Old Woman Jing had left him reeling, giving him no time for reflection.

Gazing at the empty hall, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly lit up.  He recalled something – the reason for Senior Qingzhu's defection from Shao Hua Mountain.

Senior Qingzhu's beloved had perished while exploring an immortal mansion.  She had found a great treasure, but news leaked, leading to her being ambushed and killed by her fellow explorers, including two Golden Core cultivators from the Yuan Shen Sect.

Following this, Senior Qingzhu stormed out of the sect, spending over a decade exacting revenge.  He eventually hunted down and killed the two Yuan Shen Sect Golden Core cultivators, avenging his beloved.

The immortal mansion, the Yuan Shen Sect, Leng Yuntian, Old Woman Jing, Senior Qingzhu, Zi Wei Palace…

What kind of treasure would be worth the Yuan Shen Sect's Golden Core cultivators risking their reputation and breaking all conventions to murder and steal?

Could this "great treasure" have been merely a key?

Qin Sang looked up at the crystal, mentally piecing things together.

Senior Qingzhu and his beloved's fate…

The Star Yuan Stones on Zhi Tian Peak could be used to power ancient arrays, highly significant to the Yuan Shen Sect…

Both Senior Qingzhu and Old Woman Jing harbored grudges against the Yuan Shen Sect…

Old Woman Jing possessed an unusual amount of knowledge about Senior Qingzhu and the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen"...

And Old Woman Jing’s personality – she fiercely hated those who murdered and stole, and those who killed their companions. There must be a reason for that.

The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more he suspected a deep connection between Old Woman Jing and Senior Qingzhu.

Could the immortal mansion where Senior Qingzhu's beloved perished be this very place?

Could that ambush have been the genesis of everything, its repercussions still echoing today?

Behind the two Yuan Shen Sect Golden Core cultivators who ambushed Senior Qingzhu's beloved, could there have been another mastermind?

If so, could it be that… the one who gravely wounded Leng Yuntian in Zi Wei Palace…

Was Old Woman Jing's attack on Leng Yuntian purely personal, or was there more to it?

Lost in thought, Qin Sang wove together countless conjectures, realizing that all the questions converged on a single point – the relationship between Old Woman Jing and Senior Qingzhu.

Or perhaps, the relationship between Old Woman Jing and Senior Qingzhu’s beloved.

The sect records couldn't be entirely false. Senior Qingzhu was an ascetic cultivator, brave enough to cultivate the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen," undoubtedly a dedicated cultivator pursuing the Dao.

There was no record of Senior Qingzhu having any close relatives.
