<h1>Chapter 780: Ascending the Tower</h1><p>Chapter 780: Ascending the Tower</p><p>The killing intent was pure and extreme.  </p><p>Some ancient cultivator, using an unknown method, had sealed this sword intent within the ancient hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was struck by the sword intent, gazing at the hall, lost in thought.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall and the Purple Micro Palace were intricately linked, but Qin Sang hadn't expected such sword intent to be sealed within the Heavenly Tower, and its close relationship with the *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>Could the *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter* have been created by an ancient cultivator of the Seven Kills Hall?</p><p>The first five levels' cultivation techniques had spread to the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Then, could the complete techniques be hidden within the Seven Kills Hall?</p><p>The creator of the *Yuanshen Sword Cultivation Chapter* must have been an ancient cultivator of extremely high cultivation; this technique couldn't be limited to the Golden Core stage, it surely had a continuation.</p><p>Ancient teleportation arrays, cultivation techniques…</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had a new goal.</p><p>The two killing talismans left by Elder Qingzhu could only sustain him until the late stage of Core Formation; if he could find the complete cultivation technique, he wouldn't have to rely entirely on them.</p><p>Furthermore, Elder Qingzhu had been missing for a long time, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>For years, Qin Sang had not only searched himself, but also asked Elder Zou and others for help, yet he hadn't even obtained a rumor.</p><p>Given Elder Qingzhu's talent and cultivation, it was impossible for him to leave no trace while traveling the world. Qin Sang suspected that he might have had an accident.</p><p>The cultivation world is unpredictable; anything could happen.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, what are you looking at?"</p><p>An old woman looked at Qin Sang strangely. "Have you discovered something unusual?"</p><p>Qin Sang snapped out of it, shaking his head. "No, I was just curious about the unique restrictions on the teleportation hall. Unfortunately, ancient restrictions are too mysterious, and my abilities are too low to comprehend them."</p><p>"Daoist Qin, don't be discouraged. If the restrictions here were easy to understand, the secrets of the Heavenly Tower would have long been solved. I heard that even Nascent Soul masters can only ascend layer by layer according to the rules here. Since there's nothing unusual, let's quickly enter the teleportation hall. We've been waiting outside for quite some time, it's best to break through as soon as possible..."</p><p>The old woman reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, putting his thoughts aside. The five of them leaped onto the stone steps in front of the teleportation hall.</p><p>Upon closer contact with the hall, a wave of coldness swept over them, an atmosphere of death and decay enveloped them. The teleportation hall's doors were tightly shut, the inside silent.</p><p>The cultivators who had entered before them had already entered the hall and been transported to higher levels.</p><p>They paused slightly, then quickly walked forward.</p><p>The teleportation hall had eight entrances, distributed in eight directions. It was said that each entrance led to a teleportation array, but the puppets behind each door would be different.</p><p>On the first level, they didn't need to be so vigilant.</p><p>They directly pushed open the door in front of them and entered.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The door automatically closed with a muffled sound.</p><p>Before them was a long, wide corridor, stretching straight ahead. The walls were built of blue bricks, without any patterns.</p><p>They exchanged glances and stepped inside.</p><p>Along the way, blue light frequently flashed on the walls, and puppet after puppet burst from the walls, grotesque and varied, a feast for the eyes.</p><p>The deeper they went into the corridor, the more puppets attacked them.</p><p>Unfortunately, these puppets were too weak to even impede their progress.  The group sped through the corridor, leaving behind a trail of broken puppets, dissolving into the blue stone.</p><p>Ahead, they encountered a crossroads.</p><p>It was like a maze.</p><p>Finding the ancient teleportation array wasn't difficult, but if their cultivation was insufficient, under the attacks of so many puppets, it was hard to say how long they could last. Moreover, the maze here changed constantly, different each time, making memorizing the route useless.</p><p>They agreed on signals, splitting up to search the maze, quickly locating the teleportation array.</p><p>Soon, the group stopped; before them appeared a three-meter-high stone platform, and the teleportation array was on it, emitting a faint white light.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>The man surnamed Di stepped onto it first, followed by the others. A flash of light, and they were teleported away.</p><p>At the last moment, Qin Sang's gaze was deep, fixed on the corridor behind him.</p><p>When they encountered the fork in the road and split up, he searched everywhere, and later even summoned the ebony sword and activated the killing talisman on his spirit sword, but sensed nothing.</p><p>"Could the secret of the cultivation technique be on a higher level?"</p><p>With this doubt, Qin Sang entered the second level.</p><p>The second level was similar to the first.</p><p>The group worked closely together, highly efficient, and quickly ascended to the third level, where they found the teleportation array in the teleportation hall.</p><p>They hurried on their way, encountering ancient halls and secret chambers along the way, but did not open them to search for treasure.</p><p>Upon reaching the fourth level, the puppets were indeed stronger.  Early Core Formation cultivators, if attacked here, would only be able to fight and retreat.</p><p>They took up their formations and cooperated.</p><p>The five of them flew through the darkness.</p><p>They flew, each with a bronze mirror hovering above their heads and a small silver shield orbiting them for defense; the shields belonged to the Wu surname cultivator.  For now, however, the old woman alone was sufficient.</p><p>The Yin surname cultivator was protected in the center, responsible for observing the puppets' movements and weaknesses.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding her ebony sword, had destroyed over a dozen puppets shortly after entering the fourth level.</p><p>No one noticed the peculiar glint in Qin Sang's eyes, sometimes fixated on her sword, sometimes drifting towards a distant green light.</p><p>Before, she could effortlessly dispatch the puppets, making the search for weaknesses unnecessary.  But here, the puppets were exceptionally tough, difficult to destroy easily.</p><p>This led Qin Sang to a subtle discovery.  She realized the puppets' weaknesses weren't randomly assigned.  The entire process – engaging the puppets, deflecting their attacks, and exploiting their weaknesses to counterattack – honed her swordsmanship remarkably, aiding her comprehension of sword techniques!</p><p>Qin Sang, who had already mastered Sword Qi Thunder Sound, knew this feeling wasn't an illusion!</p><p>Because they were working as a team of five, her perception wasn't as sharp.  She suspected that if she were tackling this alone, the experience would be far more intense.</p><p>This was not just a trial; it was a treasure trove for sword cultivators.  If she could continue training in the Heavenly Tower, her swordsmanship would undoubtedly progress rapidly, the mastery of Sword Light Diversification within reach.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Seven Killing Hall's opening was too brief.  In such a limited time, significant progress was impossible, and nobody would waste precious time here.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, the others focused on their journey, searching for the transmission hall.</p><p>They soon found it.</p><p>The fourth level's transmission hall was noticeably dilapidated, with two doors destroyed.  Worse yet, rumor had it that the sixth level lacked a hall altogether, only a solitary transmission array floating in the void.</p><p>This was fortunate for them; they wouldn't face a puppet onslaught.</p>
