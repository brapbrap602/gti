<h1>Chapter 2146: Omens Appear</h1><p>“This is my Daoist temple!”</p><p>Qin Sang reached the mountaintop, slowly ascended into the sky, looked around, and saw boundless mountains and fields.</p><p>Su Nu and Zhu Que were currently in seclusion at Qingyang Temple.  With three cultivators at the Transcendent Void realm guarding the place, and having gained the Zhuyan tribe's acceptance, they were no longer a small clan, even among the Yi people.</p><p>The four masters of the Jingtan had been selected.  Besides the originally appointed Li Yu Fu, Bao Xi, and Yun Xin Shi Tai, there was another, jointly nominated by various factions.</p><p>This person, who called himself Shen Qian Dao Ren, was a cultivator from Central State who rose to prominence after the cataclysm. He was a master networker, maintaining friendly relations with both righteous and evil cultivators, and even enjoying connections with the East Sea's demon tribes and the Western Lands' Buddhist sect—a truly remarkable independent cultivator.</p><p>He had never joined any sect, yet he smoothly weathered numerous tribulations, repeatedly achieving meritorious service, and frequently breaking through cultivation bottlenecks thanks to rewards, eventually reaching his current position as a Jingtan master—a truly legendary figure.</p><p>Below the Jingtan, the positions in various subordinate temples and branch temples were gradually being filled.</p><p>A corner of the main temple was surrounded by demonic energy; it was where Long Jing, by order, commanded demon soldiers guarding the area.  Other demon soldiers were dispatched to various locations to protect Qingyang.</p><p>Several others led skilled Wu people in planting Chihua trees.</p><p>Within Qingyang, immortals, gods, humans, demons, and Wu people all occupied their respective places, presenting a vibrant and prosperous scene.</p><p>At that moment, a message talisman arrived. Qin Sang scanned it with his divine sense and learned that the Shao Shi was visiting. The Shao Shi was still en route but had sent a formal notice to Qingyang Temple in advance.  Li Yu Fu, who happened to be at the temple, received the notice and hurriedly informed Qin Sang.</p><p>“He's arrived quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, the Shao Shi had arrived earlier than he expected.  The lack of advance messengers to gauge his position, and the direct dispatch of the Shao Shi himself, indicated that the Si Huang was determined to obtain the蜃楼珠 (蜃楼珠 -  *let's just call it the "Mirage Orb" for simplicity*).</p><p>With a step, Qin Sang vanished from the main temple.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>That day, the temple gates suddenly swung open, accompanied by the ringing of bells and drums—the customary greeting for honored guests.</p><p>Qin Sang personally went down the mountain to welcome them.</p><p>Outside the mountain, a rainbow paved the way, stretching from the far west. Eight celestial horses pulled a palanquin along the rainbow bridge, swiftly arriving before Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Shao Shi stepped out of the palanquin, smiling and bowing, “Old man has made a presumptuous visit, disturbing Qin Zhen Ren.”</p><p>“The visit of the Shao Shi elevates our humble abode!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, stepping aside to invite the Shao Shi to enter the mountain.</p><p>Walking side-by-side with Qin Sang, the Shao Shi seemed to have forgotten their past enmity, speaking cordially, “My surname is Si.  ‘Shao Shi’ is a title bestowed by the Si Huang, a mere formality. As the saying goes, ‘enemies become friends’. I greatly admire Qin Zhen Ren, and I wonder if I have the honor of being addressed as Si Dao You by Qin Zhen Ren?”</p><p>Si?</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Si Lu’s words; one of the four great royal families had the surname Si, a rare surname among the Si You people.</p><p>Could the Shao Shi be from a royal family, yet serve under the Si Huang?</p><p>Qin Sang had no interest in delving into the underlying causes and grievances, readily complying, and said: “My utmost honor.”</p><p>The Shao Shi laughed heartily.</p><p>Seeing the Shao Shi's disinterest in elaborate formalities, Qin Sang dismissed everyone with a wave of his hand and invited the Shao Shi to Ying Ke Peak.</p><p>In the grand hall, only Qin Sang and the Shao Shi sat facing each other.</p><p>The Shao Shi glanced outside the mountain, sighing, “In just a few decades, Qin Zhen Ren’s Daoist temple has taken on a completely new look!”</p><p>“Dao You Si is too kind,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>The Shao Shi shook his head slightly, “I trust my intuition. If Lu Wang were to attack now, I would do my utmost to dissuade him, and the Lu family could escape calamity!”</p><p>Qin Sang responded with a smile, feigning ignorance, “Dao You Si isn’t here to mourn Lu Wang, is he?”</p><p>“Qin Zhen Ren is jesting.  My intentions couldn't be hidden from you.  The Mirage Orb from the Lu family should still be in Qin Zhen Ren’s possession, correct?”  The Shao Shi bluntly stated his purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t deny it, nodding, “Even if I were to trade it, I would prioritize the most powerful royal family.  Recently, many Si You experts, including Dao You Si Lu, have tried to contact me, but they were all turned away.”</p><p>The Shao Shi relaxed, “That’s good! What are Qin Zhen Ren’s intentions?”</p><p>“Dao You Si, are you acting on the Si Huang’s behalf? What conditions has the Si Huang offered?”  Qin Sang didn’t answer but countered with a question.</p><p>Qin Sang’s question was direct, aiming to uncover the other party's bottom line.</p><p>The Shao Shi didn’t take it as an offense.  Both sides understood each other's intentions, so being straightforward was better. He replied calmly, “It depends on Qin Zhen Ren’s wishes.  It would likely be pills, spiritual treasures, or other rare artifacts. As long as Qin Zhen Ren is willing to trade, our demands will not be unreasonable, and we will do our best to satisfy them.”</p><p>The terms were exceptionally generous, practically allowing Qin Sang to name their price.  The royal family clearly felt confident, but Qin Sang sensed something amiss; Si Huang seemed overly eager.</p><p>If Si Huang had been genuinely unconcerned about the cost, they would have sent the Lesser Master much sooner.  This delay suggested Si Huang intended to stall, to negotiate.</p><p>"Is the Sacred Ground about to open?" Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren is indeed perceptive," the Lesser Master sighed, knowing concealment was futile. The Sacred Ground affected every clan; if Qin Sang chose to investigate, they would uncover the truth.</p><p>Si Huang hadn't anticipated this development, and the urgency was palpable.  After obtaining the mirage shell, they still needed to analyze the previous owner's intelligence, verifying its authenticity, identifying opportunities, and strategizing.</p><p>This intelligence was invaluable. The royal family coveted other mirage shells, but couldn't seize them without cause, lest they incur the wrath of the ancestors within the Sacred Ground.  Si Huang had stopped Lu Wang from a complete annihilation years ago precisely because the location of the Yan Shan Si family's mirage shell remained unknown.</p><p>"Rumor has it that the Polluted Lands show signs of activity. While unconfirmed, a great tide is likely imminent. If not this time, then certainly the next low tide."</p><p>Like the smaller tides of polluted miasma, the great tides lacked a precise schedule; only a rough timeframe could be estimated. Minor tides could vary by decades, major ones by centuries.  Once the signs appeared, the tide would swiftly arrive.</p><p>Presumably due to unconfirmed reports, the Yuan Xiang clan leader hadn't sent a message. If the next low tide was the great tide, only a few decades remained.</p><p>Qin Sang, having heard from Ning Zhenren that this would occur within a millennium, had felt ample time.  They now felt fortunate to have prioritized strengthening their abilities, aiming to refine the Kun Tian Golden Lock before the next low tide.</p><p>The Lesser Master was unusually candid.</p><p>Qin Sang realized this was precisely the situation they desired.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang addressed the Lesser Master: "I am uninjured and lack no spiritual treasures.  However, having heard tales of the Sacred Ground, despite being an outsider, I am drawn to it, filled with curiosity and anticipation…"</p><p>The Lesser Master was surprised. "Qin Zhenren wishes to...?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>The Lesser Master vehemently shook their head. "Qin Zhenren is not a descendant of our Yi Ren clan. The Sacred Ground does not permit outsiders…"</p><p>"Is there truly no possibility?" Qin Sang interrupted. "Has the Si You clan, or indeed the entire Yi Ren clan, never had precedent? I vaguely recall a clause in the ancient pact…"</p><p>The Lesser Master paused, their expression changing.</p><p>This clause had never been invoked by the Si You clan.  Entry permits to the Sacred Ground were limited; who would relinquish one to an outsider?  Furthermore, the consent of all mirage shell owners within the clan was necessary.</p><p>Si Huang had likely forgotten this rule; few within the Si You clan even remembered it.  The fact that Qin Zhenren knew was impressive.</p><p>The Lesser Master had arrived brimming with confidence, unprepared for Qin Sang's request, now hesitant.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently, sipping their tea.</p><p>"Would Qin Zhenren compete with my clan for opportunities within the Sacred Ground?" the Lesser Master asked, frowning.</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge of the Sacred Ground came from the Han Jiang Lu and Yan Shan Si families' mirage shells. If they also sought the opportunities those shells described, conflict with the royal family would be inevitable.</p><p>"I will avoid the royal family as much as possible, and we can make a sworn oath afterward," Qin Sang replied lightly. "A mirage shell has two slots; I'll take one, leaving the royal family with one extra.  Why hesitate, Daoist Si?"</p><p>The Lesser Master stiffened. "Qin Zhenren won't demand further conditions! That's absolutely unacceptable! Do you understand the cost of persuading other mirage shell owners to allow an outsider?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. "Daoist Si should report to Si Huang first, and we can discuss further then."</p><p>The Lesser Master hesitated, aware of the time constraint, yet unable to decide.  Si Huang needed to consider carefully.</p><p>The Lesser Master sighed inwardly, unwilling to prolong the meeting.  After a brief conversation, they took their leave.</p><p>Watching the palanquin head west, Qin Sang pondered. The Lesser Master had arrived with considerable treasures, but they had to relinquish them for access to the Sacred Ground.</p><p>…</p><p>After the Lesser Master's departure, Qin Sang returned to the Fire Chamber.</p><p>Within, eight golden figures surrounded the Kun Tian Golden Lock, channeling golden liquid. The lock's repulsive force was weakening.</p><p>"There should be sufficient time," Qin Sang murmured, sensing this.</p><p>Since returning from Ziyun Mountain, they had barely cultivated, dedicating their time to the sword array and the Kun Tian Golden Lock aside from managing Qingyang.</p><p>The sword array had also made significant progress.</p><p>Before the sacred site opens, even if the Azure Dragon Sword Formation isn't fully mastered, it can be used against enemies.  Three formations combined will be even more powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang, using golden liquid to enhance the golden statues, continued to study the sword formations.</p><p>After Shaoshi left, there was no news for months, showing how difficult this condition was for the Emperor.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't wait for Shaoshi, but instead the Yuanxiang clan leader arrived, bringing similar news.</p><p>"The next two low tides will be followed by a large tide; Qin Zhenren should prepare.  Join us at the Yuanjiao Assembly; you can bring some fellow cultivators and younger generations," said the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>"Will it expose our tracks?" Qin Sang worried.</p><p>According to Ning Zhenren, he needed to avoid Liuli, remaining hidden to avoid detection by their opponents.</p><p>"It's fine. The Yuanjiao Assembly is first, then the sacred site. Powerful individuals from various clans will attend the assembly, including many friendly outsiders. Countless rare treasures will be there; it's too valuable to miss. The assembly will end before the sacred site opens. The gate to the sacred site has its own monitoring abilities. As long as Qin Zhenren obtains the recognition of the Siyou clan, with the power of all the mirage beads enhancing you, you can pass through the gate without telling other tribes. To avoid trouble, the Emperor will certainly help conceal your identity…"</p><p>The Zhuyan clan has already sent in many outsiders, and the Yuanxiang clan leader is experienced.</p><p>Qin Sang felt relieved, sighing, "It's a pity Shaoshi is out of contact. I wonder what the Emperor truly intends."</p><p>"Since he didn't refuse outright, it's negotiable. The Emperor is likely testing others' attitudes. Let's wait a little longer."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader didn't just come to deliver a message; he also wanted to observe the government hall.</p><p>Qin Sang was generous, opening the teaching hall and inviting the Yuanxiang clan leader inside.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader was amazed, repeatedly praising it.  Truly worthy of the Dao Court that once shook the Great Thousand World!</p><p>…</p><p>As the Yuanxiang clan leader predicted, shortly after his visit, Shaoshi finally returned.</p><p>Qin Sang invited Shaoshi to Yingke Peak. After some pleasantries, Shaoshi got straight to the point, delivering good news.</p><p>"During this period, I was ordered to contact several cultivators who control the mirage beads. Persuading them wasn't easy. However, despite the difficulties, it's not hopeless."</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, listening as Shaoshi continued, "The Emperor must confirm one point: that helping Qin Zhenren enter the sacred site at great cost won't become a problem for us."</p><p>"I've said I can make a solemn oath…"</p><p>"The Emperor wants Qin Daoist to become our ally!"</p><p>Shaoshi interrupted, "After entering the sacred site, please meet with us first to break a seal. Rest assured, it won't take long. Afterwards, you'll still have plenty of time to explore."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>After entering the sacred site, he definitely needed to meet with Liuli and the others as soon as possible.  Regardless of how long breaking the seal takes, there might be dangers and other opponents. It means he's trading a mirage bead and himself for just one chance to enter.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "If I could be brought in every time, perhaps I'd consider it."</p><p>"That's not impossible, as long as Qin Zhenren always sides with the royal family. Most of the opportunities in the sacred site are useless to outsiders. Compared to others, Qin Zhenren is more trustworthy."</p><p>Shaoshi said seriously, "Don't refuse so quickly. Listen to the following conditions…The royal family obtained a treasure in the sacred site, called the [Name of the bead], a thunder-type artifact.  It doesn't have overwhelming power itself, but it can store a thunder technique. When facing enemies, releasing the bead will unleash the technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed suddenly.</p><p>"You've thought of it. We originally had no certainty about that seal, but with Qin Zhenren's help, it's different. We want you to use the Thunder Altar to cast the thunder talisman used to kill the Grand Attendant, and seal it into the [Name of the bead].  Although the bead can only store one technique at a time, it can be reused.  Once successful, the Emperor will give the bead to Qin Zhenren as payment," Shaoshi's tone was somewhat persuasive.</p><p>Such a treasure exists!</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply moved, saying solemnly, "Are you sure this bead can store that thunder talisman?"</p><p>Shaoshi hesitated; he wasn't entirely sure. The talisman was too powerful.</p><p>"Let's try! With the power of the Thunder Altar, even sealing a slightly weaker talisman would be a powerful aid."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to speak, when he felt something strange with his primordial spirit.</p><p>His Yunyou Sword was trembling!</p>
