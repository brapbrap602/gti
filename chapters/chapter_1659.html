<h1></h1><p>The great hall was windowless.</p><p>The only light source was the protective aura of the Ruyi Pearl, dispelling the darkness and casting flickering shadows within the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, scanning his surroundings. Finding himself alone, he thought it strange.</p><p>Recalling the sudden shift, he was certain he hadn't caused it. Some other variable must have come into play, but he couldn't understand why he'd been transported here, and alone at that.</p><p>“What did Zhu Wudao do?”</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively thought of Zhu Wudao. The man knew the Boundless Immortal Sect best.  Calculating the time, Zhu Wudao, having waited too long for the Weeping Soul Cave Master, should already be on the mountain.</p><p>His gaze swept across the hall.</p><p>The space was vast and empty, devoid of furnishings save for a two-tiered jade platform in the center, resembling some sort of altar. However, the altar showed no signs of spiritual light; it seemed to have been abandoned.</p><p>He was about to approach the altar to examine its purpose but hesitated, thinking it best to ascertain his location and find an exit before acting rashly in this unclear situation.</p><p>“No doors…”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished. The entire hall was devoid of doors. Restrictive formations flickered on the walls, making it clear they wouldn’t shatter easily. Looking up at the dome, he saw no skylight either.</p><p>A faint tremor came from the ground, suggesting the area outside the hall wasn't peaceful.</p><p>This deepened his confusion. The exit likely still lay with the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed forward, approaching the altar. Just as he began to examine it closely, a brilliant light suddenly erupted, not from the altar itself, but from the other side.</p><p>The light illuminated the entire hall, then vanished in an instant.</p><p>But the hall didn't fall back into darkness; another sphere of light immediately flared.</p><p>*Swish! Swish!*</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four spheres of light ignited in sequence. As their radiance faded, four figures materialized, each exuding a formidable aura no weaker than Qin Sang’s.</p><p>Recognizing the four, Qin Sang's expression stiffened, and he inwardly groaned.</p><p>Su Zinan, Mo Xingdao, and Zhu Wudao joining forces was within his expectations. But when had Old Devil Fan entered and joined them?</p><p>The newcomers were indeed Zhu Wudao and the other three.</p><p>Qin Sang had crossed paths with two of them before, resulting in minor grudges. At the time, it hadn't escalated to life-or-death conflict.  But now, outnumbered and trapped within this hall with no escape route in sight, how could they not harbor ill intentions?</p><p>Even with his confidence, Qin Sang wouldn't dare face four Grand Cultivators alone.</p><p>"Where's the Purple Thunder Patriarch?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, his eyes darting around.</p><p>Yet no other lights appeared after the four materialized.</p><p>Could it be that the three Daoist Grand Cultivators weren't on Emperor Bestowal Mountain?</p><p>Meanwhile, eight eyes locked onto Qin Sang, each of the four with different expressions.</p><p>“The Fire Devil!”</p><p>Su Zinan blurted out, then his face lit up with delight.  It was as if a precious item, sought after with great effort, had fallen into his lap.  If they could slay the Fire Devil here, they'd not only obtain the tribulation treasure, but also secure the third host soul for the Demonic Banner!</p><p>Seeing that the hall was sealed, Su Zinan threw back his head and laughed.  "Did you ever think you’d see this day?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  He and Old Wu had fought to a draw; why did Su Zinan seem to harbor such deep hatred for him?  Either he blamed him for Yuefei's death or he knew something about the tomb of the Water Phase Master!</p><p>Old Devil Fan had been observing Qin Sang with a constant smirk.  Hearing Su Zinan's laughter, he exclaimed, "Fellow Daoist Su also has a grudge against this fiend?  The heavens have eyes!  Truly, those who commit many injustices will surely perish; they walk straight into hell!"</p><p>Killing intent flashed in his eyes.  Dark light swirled in his palm, and he discreetly gripped nine Yin Devil Nails.</p><p>In the battle outside the Immortal Sect, Old Devil Fan had suffered a setback. The memory of his three Yin Devil Nails being instantly shattered was still fresh, so this time, he was prepared with nine.</p><p>Su Zinan had been sending secret messages, urging the others to attack. He and Mo Xingdao already had an alliance, but Zhu Wudao and Old Devil Fan’s thoughts were deep and unfathomable. The Ice Instrument Divine Disc on Qin Sang wouldn't be recognized by others, but it certainly couldn’t escape Zhu Wudao’s discerning eyes. Su Zinan didn’t want the two devils to reap the benefits after a fierce battle.</p><p>Pleased that he had persuaded Old Devil Fan without much effort, Su Zinan’s joy was cut short when he saw the corner of Qin Sang’s mouth curl up.  Not only was he unafraid, but he even wore a sneer.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang’s hand on the edge of the altar turned black. Nine Nether Devil Fire surged forth without reservation, crashing fiercely into the altar!</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Su Zinan's expression shifted drastically.  Black light blazed in his palm, abruptly transforming into a black ruler.  The ruler’s shadow, without a hint of flourish, sliced through the void, aiming for Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's face darkened, and the nine Yin Devil Nails flew from his hand.</p><p>But Qin Sang was too close to the altar.  Though their movements were swift, the devil fire was faster.</p><p>The moment the four appeared, Qin Sang had already scanned the altar with his divine sense. Since the Boundless Immortal Sect built this hall, they couldn’t have left no exit; it must be related to the altar.</p><p>Upon scanning, he indeed discovered the key. The altar was the core of the hall's restrictive formations. Moreover, a powerful force outside was constantly bombarding the hall, causing tremors and destabilizing the altar.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The devil fire poured into the altar.</p><p>Runes on the altar flashed explosively, and under the impact of the devil fire, the restrictive formations immediately descended into chaos.</p><p>This was undoubtedly adding insult to injury.  Under the combined internal and external assault, the entire hall vibrated with a buzzing sound. The five within felt the ground shake violently beneath their feet, then witnessed the altar shatter, leaving behind a blinding white light.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating this, retreated swiftly. The next instant, he heard a loud crash behind him.  A section of the stone wall had slammed against the protective aura of the Ruyi Pearl.</p><p>At some point, the hall had begun to collapse. The dome was the first to be blown away, clouds and mist pouring in, followed by the surrounding walls.</p><p>Finally, the foundation of the hall was ripped apart by the immense force, turning into a torrent of rubble that was swept into the depths of the clouds and mist.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…*</p><p>The five within reacted quickly, flying into the air before the hall completely crumbled, avoiding injury.</p><p>The only things affected were the attacks from Su Zinan and Old Devil Fan, which were disrupted by the fluctuations from the altar. Qin Sang evaded them effortlessly.</p><p>*Whooosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The wind howled, and the clouds churned.</p><p>The five stood amidst the clouds, their bodies shimmering with protective auras of various colors, clearly having activated their respective defensive treasures to withstand the turbulent currents within the clouds and mist.</p><p>Qin Sang was still facing four opponents.</p><p>During the standoff, they all silently observed their surroundings.</p><p>Above and below, the clouds and mist were omnipresent, limiting visibility.</p><p>Faintly, they could make out the silhouette of the divine mountain above, its peaks towering even higher and more majestic than the mountain scenery they'd seen before.  Seeing this, they realized this was the true Emperor Bestowal Mountain!</p><p>They were inside, but still within the range of the grand formation. The turbulent clouds and mist were a result of the formation's disruption.</p><p>What seemed like a lengthy process only took an instant for cultivators of their level to grasp the situation.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others weren't in a hurry to ascend the mountain, their eyes still fixed on Qin Sang with predatory intent.</p><p>Zhu Wudao had no personal grudge against Qin Sang.</p><p>After entering the hall, he had been wary of the Daoist masters, and one of the reasons he had gathered allies was to prevent being cornered by them.</p><p>The Daoists had entered Emperor Bestowal Mountain earlier than they had.</p><p>Surprisingly, even now, the Purple Thunder Patriarch hadn't appeared.</p><p>Zhu Wudao felt a slight relief. He looked around, then at Qin Sang with surprise and curiosity. "May I know this fellow Daoist's esteemed name? Could you be a descendant of the Fire Phase? It's a pity that in the Transmission Hall, Fellow Daoist was unwilling to forge a positive connection. Otherwise, this old man might have been able to mediate and resolve the grudges between you all. As long as there's no deep-seated hatred, I believe Fellow Daoist Su and Senior Brother Fan would give me some face…"</p><p>“Why waste words with him?  Even without a grudge, it wouldn’t hurt to eliminate this person, one less competitor for the treasures!”</p><p>Old Devil Fan was still smarting from the loss of his nine Yin Devil Nails and blamed it all on Qin Sang.</p><p>Su Zinan remained silent, holding the black ruler before him.  A fine net slipped from his sleeve into his hand. Silently chanting incantations, the Dragon Sinew Net expanded, filling the air.</p><p>The Dragon Sinew Net could shrink or expand, as small as a hair or large enough to seal the heavens and earth!</p><p>Capturing Elder Yanshan's nascent soul had been partly thanks to this net.</p><p>The net might not be able to stop Qin Sang, but delaying him for a moment would suffice. Even if Zhu Wudao remained neutral, they still had three on their side. Su Zinan didn't believe they couldn't take Qin Sang down!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Dragon Sinew Net vanished, replaced by a grid of shimmering lines in the air.</p><p>The lines crisscrossed, about to close.</p><p>At some point, a pair of magnificent phoenix wings had manifested behind Qin Sang.  He targeted a point within the depths of the clouds and mist, then, man and sword united, transformed into a bolt of lightning and flew away!</p><p>A thunderclap echoed through the air.</p><p>"Such incredible speed!"</p><p>Su Zinan and the others were startled, watching helplessly as the lightning bolt zipped through a gap in the net.</p><p>Only after the lightning passed did a black lotus bloom at the gap. Demonic energy surged from its core, forming a cage, but it only trapped a wisp of cloud, missing its target.</p><p>Old Devil Fan's expression froze, then he roared in fury. Flipping his left palm, the black lotus shot upwards, inverting itself and emitting countless black rays.</p><p>Wherever the black rays touched, black lotuses bloomed one after another.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of lotuses filled the sea of mist, bobbing up and down among the clouds, transforming it into a lotus pond.</p><p>Qin Sang's lightning遁光 entered the lotus pond. An icy aura pervaded the area, surrounding him on all sides. No matter how he maneuvered, he couldn't escape.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!*</p><p>The black lotuses surged towards him, sharp as blades.  If caught, Qin Sang would be minced into pieces.</p><p>Protected by the Ruyi Pearl's aura and wielding the devil fire, Qin Sang's momentum was unstoppable, annihilating countless black lotuses.</p><p>However, Old Devil Fan's goal was merely to delay Qin Sang and force him to divide his attention. Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao moved simultaneously, flanking him from left and right.</p><p>Just then, a sharp shout rang out from the depths of the cloud sea: "Myriad Illusionary Lotuses!"</p><p>The voice carried an undeniable killing intent.</p><p>Hearing it, Zhu Wudao and the others changed color.</p><p>Immediately after, a thunderclap even more awe-inspiring than Qin Sang's lightning escape reverberated from the depths of the cloud sea.  Five thunder pythons burst into view, charging into the lotus pond, combining with Qin Sang's devil fire to sweep away all obstacles in their path.</p><p>Behind the thunder pythons, two figures emerged from the clouds, the Eight Scenery View’s two Patriarchs.</p><p>“The two Patriarchs have finally arrived!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded from afar.</p><p>After escaping the hall, he hadn't worried about his situation.  His Heavenly Eye divine ability had pierced through the clouds and mist, revealing the presence of the Purple Thunder Patriarch and Patriarch Hegao. They must have entered earlier, cracking the jade pavilion's space and entering the mountain before the shift, which was why they weren’t transported into the hall.</p><p>As for why only the two Eight Scenery View Patriarchs were present and not Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang didn't know. But with these two here, Zhu Wudao's side wouldn't dare target him any further.</p><p>He had attacked them in the Transmission Hall, and now he needed their help to escape. The situation had shifted dramatically.</p><p>“It’s you.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Patriarch Hegao’s expression was wary. Qin Sang had just attacked them; he held no favorable impression.</p><p>“The incident in the Transmission Hall was a misunderstanding. I apologize to the two Fellow Daoists. These Boundless Immortal Sect remnants deliberately sabotaged the formation, their motives suspicious and warranting investigation!”</p><p>Qin Sang redirected the blame towards Zhu Wudao, his figure flickering as he landed near the two Patriarchs.</p><p>Behind him, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao, who had been in hot pursuit, were forced to stop, hesitating.</p><p>The Purple Thunder Patriarch's gaze shifted to Old Devil Fan.  "Fellow Daoist Fan is also colluding with the remnants of the Boundless Immortal Sect?"</p><p>Old Devil Fan chuckled, withdrawing his Myriad Illusionary Lotuses, and instead, turned accusatory.  "Old Bullnose, I heard they were able to activate the Boundless Immortal Sect because you deliberately allowed it?"</p><p>The anger on his face had vanished; Qin Sang was no longer in his sights.</p><p>“After we leave, this poor Daoist will give you an explanation,” the Purple Thunder Patriarch said calmly.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Old Devil Fan shook his head repeatedly. “I don’t want any explanations. You just need to tell me what happened in the Immortal Palace!”</p><p>The Purple Thunder Patriarch frowned, knowing he couldn’t hide it any longer. He sighed inwardly and said, “If this poor Daoist knew the details, there wouldn’t be a need for such elaborate measures. After this matter concludes, this poor Daoist will join forces with Sweet Dew Zen Monastery to open the Immortal Palace.  At that time, we will invite your esteemed sect and various sects from the Central Plains to witness.”</p><p>Seeing them reach an agreement so easily, Zhu Wudao felt a sense of foreboding, his expression darkening.</p><p>He glanced at Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao.  Since the Daoists appeared, these two had been keeping their distance, acting as if they wanted to disengage.</p><p>Earlier, Mo Xingdao had forced him to reveal the Wordless Jade Tablet, and now, they had used his Gold Phase Token to enter.  He had outlived his usefulness; their intentions were clear.</p><p>The only good news was that Yue Lingtian wasn't present.</p><p>Seeing the Purple Thunder Patriarch's candor, Old Devil Fan couldn't press him too hard.  He subconsciously glanced at Zhu Wudao, hesitating.</p><p>At that moment, Zhu Wudao's voice whispered into his ear.</p><p>Surprise flickered in Old Devil Fan's eyes, and he declared righteously, "Junior Brother Zhu openly violated the sect’s rules, colluding with the remnants of the Boundless Immortal Sect! This is an unforgivable crime!  This elder will personally bring him back to the sect to enforce the sect's laws…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the Purple Thunder Patriarch’s figure blurred.</p><p>Old Devil Fan knew something was wrong. A deafening thunderclap erupted beside him.  Blinding lightning engulfed where Zhu Wudao stood, obscuring his figure.  Then, a clear crane's cry echoed as an immortal crane soared into the sky!</p><p>The two Eight Scenery View Patriarchs, sharing a single mind, had taken action when they realized they couldn't persuade Old Devil Fan.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang bowed to them from afar, his phoenix wings beating rapidly as he flew towards the mountain without looking back.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao exchanged glances, ignoring Zhu Wudao behind them, and pursued Qin Sang.  "Don't escape!"</p><p>Old Devil Fan was left alone, cursing under his breath.</p><p>…</p><p>Below the sea of clouds.</p><p>Two figures hid in a corner, not daring to move as they sensed the battle of Grand Cultivators above.</p><p>"So many Grand Cultivators."</p><p>The female cultivator stuck out her tongue, sensing the powerful auras in the clouds, grateful for her senior brother's decisiveness.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist stared intently upwards.  Sensing three auras flying away, while the others became a chaotic mess, he said, "Let’s go!"</p><p>The two concealed their auras, carefully traversing the area.</p>
