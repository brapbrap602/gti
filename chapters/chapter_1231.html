<h1>Chapter 1223: The Request</h1><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands clasped behind his back in front of the inner gate of the Verdant Sun Demon Sect.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's gaze pierced through the sect's protective barriers, focusing on the tallest peak—Divine Apex Peak.  </p><p>Though still distant, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision was exceptionally keen.  </p><p>The last time Qin Sang had visited, Divine Apex Peak was engulfed in swirling winds and ceaseless lightning.  </p><p>At its summit, a chaotic green shadow danced wildly, and the Ancestral Sacred Flame raged uncontrollably. Even from afar, one could sense the terrifying power that seemed on the verge of eruption, filling the heart with deep unease.  </p><p>Now, however, Divine Apex Peak was shrouded in a jade-like mist. The winds had calmed, the lightning had vanished, and even the green shadow of the Ancestral Sacred Flame had been suppressed by the sect's grand formation, rendering the peak far more tranquil than before.  </p><p>Yet, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine vision penetrated the formation, revealing faint ripples of disturbance beneath the surface.  </p><p>The Verdant Sun Demon Sect had only temporarily suppressed the Ancestral Sacred Flame!  </p><p>The scene before him largely confirmed Qin Sang's suspicions. He nodded subtly to himself, withdrawing his gaze and turning his attention to Xiang Qing, who was swiftly approaching.  </p><p>Qin Sang had only slightly concealed his presence, but it was enough to evade the detection of fellow Nascent Soul cultivators. However, his movements had been noticed by Xiang Qing the moment he stirred.  </p><p>This, of course, was Qin Sang's intention.  </p><p>He ceased his concealment, allowing the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator to radiate freely.  </p><p>Sect Master Dong's mind buzzed, leaving him utterly bewildered.  </p><p>Only two words echoed in his mind:  </p><p>"Nascent Soul... Nascent Soul..."  </p><p>Like a curse, they repeated over and over.  </p><p>Sect Master Dong stood frozen, his body stiff and his back cold with dread.  </p><p>Elder Qingfeng was a Nascent Soul cultivator!  </p><p>He, a mere mortal, had once dared to entertain thoughts of challenging a sect founded by a Nascent Soul cultivator, even leading a group to their doorstep. That he hadn't been struck down on the spot and sent to the underworld alongside Lu Xing was nothing short of a miracle, a stroke of luck that had exhausted all the fortune he had accumulated over eight lifetimes.  </p><p>Even if Elder Qingfeng had wiped out the entire Yin Spring Sect, would the Verdant Sun Demon Sect dare demand his life in return?  </p><p>Xiang Qing emerged in a flash, his eyes flickering with surprise as he took in Qin Sang's unfamiliar face. He cupped his hands in greeting and said, "I am Xiang Qing. May I ask for your esteemed name, fellow Daoist?"  </p><p>"I am Qingfeng," Qin Sang replied calmly, returning the gesture.  </p><p>Sect Master Dong had yet to regain his composure.  </p><p>The young disciple, though shocked upon seeing Qin Sang, was far less overwhelmed. He knelt before Xiang Qing and said, "Reporting to the Patriarch, Elder Qingfeng is the founding ancestor of the Blazing Demon Sect."  </p><p>"The Blazing Demon Sect?"  </p><p>Xiang Qing paused, taking a moment to recall the sect. He then scrutinized Qin Sang more closely.  </p><p>He remembered that the Blazing Demon Sect had only a single Golden Core cultivator as its sect master. The so-called founding ancestor had long been absent from the scene, yet here he was, having quietly ascended to the Nascent Soul realm.  </p><p>What was the purpose of this unannounced visit?  </p><p>Xiang Qing recalled that the Blazing Demon Sect had once been a subordinate of the Verdant Sun Demon Sect.  </p><p>Had this man, upon reaching Nascent Soul, developed ambitions of his own and come to pay his respects?  </p><p>Regardless, as a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Cold Domain, there was no reason to turn him away. If he behaved appropriately, all would be well. But if he acted recklessly, Xiang Qing wouldn't mind teaching him a lesson.  </p><p>Suppressing his doubts, Xiang Qing gestured politely, "This is no place for idle conversation. Daoist Qingfeng, why not join me in my cave abode for a cup of fine wine? I happen to have another esteemed guest with me."  </p><p>"Very well," Qin Sang agreed, following Xiang Qing with graceful ease.  </p><p>As they departed, the young disciple heard Xiang Qing's voice in his ear, instructing him to escort Sect Master Dong to rest.  </p><p>"Sect Master Dong..."  </p><p>Hearing the disciple's call, Sect Master Dong snapped out of his daze.  </p><p>A flurry of thoughts raced through his mind. Would Elder Qingfeng hold a grudge against him? Should he prostrate himself and beg for forgiveness? Had he committed any grave offenses in recent days?  </p><p>By the time he regained his senses, Qin Sang had already departed, leaving Sect Master Dong feeling a profound sense of loss.  </p><p>When he turned to look for Mountain Shaking Lord, he found that the man had long since vanished.  </p><p>...  </p><p>In front of Xiang Qing's cave abode, ancient pines and cypresses surrounded a stone platform that jutted out, forming a terrace facing Divine Apex Peak.  </p><p>On the stone table lay a jug of fine wine, and seated beside it was Bing Han, the sect master of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.  </p><p>She wore a white palace gown with a pink shawl draped over her shoulders. Though her beauty paled in comparison to her senior sister and Chen Yan, she was still a stunning figure, her eyes brimming with vitality.  </p><p>Standing beside the table was another figure.  </p><p>Seeing this person, Qin Sang couldn't help but smile inwardly.  </p><p>It was an old acquaintance—Wu Youdao.  </p><p>Years ago, when Qin Sang had infiltrated the Verdant Sun Demon Sect to forcibly refine the Verdant Sun Divine Apex, he had been discovered and engaged in a fierce battle with Wu Youdao.  </p><p>Times had changed.  </p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had just formed his Corpse Core and was slightly weaker than Wu Youdao. He had to exhaust all his means to force Wu Youdao to abandon the chase. Now, Qin Sang had ascended to the Nascent Soul realm, while Wu Youdao remained at the mid-Golden Core stage, relegated to standing by during gatherings of Nascent Soul cultivators.  </p><p>However, judging by the fluctuations in Wu Youdao's aura, he wasn't far from a breakthrough.  </p><p>Xiang Qing, still somewhat confused, briefly introduced Qin Sang to Bing Han.  </p><p>After exchanging greetings, the three took their seats.  </p><p>Xiang Qing dismissed Wu Youdao, then took out a golden goblet and personally poured wine for Qin Sang. He then turned his gaze to Qin Sang.  </p><p>"My sudden visit may have disrupted your pleasant gathering. I hope I haven't caused any inconvenience," Qin Sang said with a calm demeanor, expressing his gratitude.  </p><p>Bing Han, equally curious about Qin Sang, remarked, "I never expected there to be a hidden gem in the Cold Domain. Judging by your aura, fellow Daoist, your breakthrough wasn't recent, was it?"  </p><p>In the world of cultivation, there were many reclusive ascetics who devoted themselves entirely to their practice, detached from worldly affairs.  </p><p>However, with the ongoing war between the Two Domains Alliance and the Sin Abyss, no one wished to see their homeland fall into enemy hands, forcing them to live under another's roof. Thus, most cultivators contributed in some way, whether great or small.  </p><p>Even those who lived in seclusion couldn't remain entirely unknown.  </p><p>Both Bing Han and Xiang Qing, one representing the righteous path and the other the demonic, were unfamiliar with Qin Sang. His claim of being the founder of the Blazing Demon Sect, based solely on his word, carried little credibility.  </p><p>This man, with his unclear origins, had suddenly appeared. Could he be a spy from the Sin Abyss?  </p><p>The two exchanged a glance, maintaining their composure as they waited to hear what this Daoist had to say.  </p><p>"I indeed ascended to Nascent Soul not long ago. I came here today to personally express my gratitude to Fellow Daoist Xiang for looking after my less-than-capable disciples," Qin Sang said, raising his golden goblet in a toast to Xiang Qing.  </p><p>Xiang Qing frowned slightly, raising his cup in return. "You flatter me. I have always treated all subordinate sects equally. Since you've come unannounced, Daoist Qingfeng, you might as well speak plainly."  </p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang remained evasive, Xiang Qing grew impatient and wished to cut to the chase.  </p><p>In truth, Qin Sang had been secretly observing Divine Apex Peak. A closer look only confirmed his earlier suspicions.  </p><p>He had borrowed the identity of the Blazing Demon Sect's founder for this very reason. If his assumptions proved incorrect, he could simply feign ignorance and return to devise another plan.  </p><p>With a serious expression, Qin Sang decided to stop beating around the bush. "I came here today to propose a transaction with Fellow Daoist Xiang. I have a way to help you resolve a pressing concern!"  </p><p>As he spoke, he pointed toward the summit of Divine Apex Peak.  </p><p>Xiang Qing and Bing Han's expressions shifted slightly.  </p><p>Seeing their reactions, Qin Sang knew he had struck a chord.  </p><p>Xiang Qing's face darkened. "What do you mean by that, Daoist Qingfeng? What pressing concern are you referring to?"  </p><p>Qin Sang met Xiang Qing's gaze squarely, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.  </p><p>"You've used the grand formation to seal the Ancestral Sacred Flame, thinking it would conceal the truth. Perhaps it fools others, but not me. The Ancestral Sacred Flame is only temporarily suppressed. The underlying danger remains, and the longer it's delayed, the harder it will be to resolve. When the suppression finally fails, the Ancestral Sacred Flame will erupt with catastrophic force, destroying not just Divine Apex Peak, but far more..."</p>
