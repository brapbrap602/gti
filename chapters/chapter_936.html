<h1>Chapter 928:  Fang Laomo</h1><p>Qin Sang quickly dismissed the minor incident, drawing closer to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>This time, he arrived earlier.</p><p>It was said that because the immortal array constantly shifted, the Wu tribe's method of breaking the array differed from last time, and there might be a chance to observe.</p><p>The waves grew stronger.  Qin Sang knew he was nearing the Seven Killing Hall.  After flying a short distance, his vision opened, revealing the massive sea crater and the wind wall before him, just as awe-inspiring as before.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, then swept his gaze around, unexpectedly finding only two figures.</p><p>The Grand Shaman and other Nascent Soul cultivators were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang retreated slightly, then flew around the wind wall in another direction.</p><p>Just as he was about to reach the other side of the crater, Qin Sang paused, his face showing surprise.  Ahead, more than a dozen cultivators stood close together, intently observing something.</p><p>So that's why there were so few people elsewhere; they were all here.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, sheathed his ebony sword, and casually took out a flying sword, using his swordsmanship for protection. He had too many enemies, all from powerful factions, and didn't want anyone to associate him with his identity.</p><p>When he had visited Old Man Zou, he had also left his Heaven Corpse Coffin and his body double elsewhere.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang broke through the waves and flew to the front, not far from the group.</p><p>The others glanced at Qin Sang before returning their attention to what was in front of them.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang also saw the scene.</p><p>Before the wind wall, for some unknown reason, it was unusually calm. The hurricane seemed to be blocked by some force, unable to penetrate this area, consistently diverting around its edges.</p><p>This kind of place was unique within the storm belt.  Several cultivators were suspended there, clearly divided into two groups, each with about fifteen people.</p><p>"Wu tribe and human Nascent Souls!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, horrified to discover that each of those figures possessed a terrifying aura; without exception, they were all Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>"They arrived a long time ago. There's no wind or waves here; this tranquility... is it the power of a spirit array?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his gaze sweeping over these Nascent Souls before focusing on the surface of the sea below. Even Nascent Soul cultivators didn't dare to be careless in the face of the grey hurricane; only a powerful spirit array could achieve this.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as he discovered countless white specks floating beneath the surface of the sea. "Those white specks are the manifestation of the spirit array's power. The person controlling the array must be the Grand Shaman of the Wu tribe, a late-Nascent Soul cultivator."</p><p>He had long admired the Wu tribe's Grand Shaman.  He shifted his gaze toward the Wu tribe Nascent Souls, easily finding a white-haired woman surrounded by the others.</p><p>The woman wore a luxurious robe, the patterns on which resembled divine runes.  She wore a half-mask, thin as a cicada's wing, also engraved with mysterious patterns.</p><p>Her lips were full and scarlet, her eyes exceptionally bright, seemingly captivating.</p><p>All signs pointed to this woman being the Wu tribe's Grand Shaman.</p><p>"With white hair, yet her skin is like a young girl's—her age is unreadable, but she's definitely an old monster," Qin Sang dared not stare at the Grand Shaman. He shifted his gaze towards the human faction.</p><p>To dare to confront the Grand Shaman, the human faction's strength should not be much weaker. Last time, the Demon Lord had come in person...</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred as he spotted an old Daoist holding a whisk, his eyes half-closed, his demeanor refined, seemingly indifferent to everything.</p><p>The old Daoist wore a moon-white Daoist robe with the ancient characters "天道" (Tiandao) imprinted on it.</p><p>"Could this be the天道宗 (Tiandao Sect) Sect Master, Ling Zhuzi? His aura is no less than the Grand Shaman's.  Truly deserving of his reputation!"</p><p>Qin Sang had spent a considerable time in the Canglang Sea and was familiar with the major human factions.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was another late-Nascent Soul cultivator among humans, a leader of the righteous path, on par with the Demon Lord.</p><p>Other human Nascent Souls either surrounded Ling Zhuzi or deliberately kept a distance, showing him deference and respect.</p><p>"Those should be the demonic Nascent Souls.  It seems the Demon Lord isn't here this time. Are the two great cultivators taking turns attending to the Wu tribe?"</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang guessed the situation.</p><p>At this moment, Nascent Soul cultivators from both factions gathered here, yet none spoke, and they made no move, seeming to be waiting for a certain moment.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others naturally didn't dare to urge them and honestly waited on the periphery.</p><p>It was impossible to tell the time inside the storm, but Qin Sang estimated it was already the hour of Xu (7-9 pm). In another hour or so, the Grand Shaman would use the array to break the array.</p><p>As time passed, more and more cultivators arrived. Qin Sang continued to observe secretly but didn't see Old Man Zou or the others, wondering if they were hiding their identities.</p><p>Several Nascent Soul cultivators from both clans weren't completely asleep; some occasionally glanced at the Golden Core cultivators outside.</p><p>"What is it, Old Devil Mou? Are you looking for someone?"</p><p>Several Nascent Soul cultivators from the demonic path stood together.  Without their Demon Lord to back them, they were quite subdued in the presence of two powerful cultivators.</p><p>An elder in a blood-red robe suddenly opened his eyes, glancing sideways at a black-robed demonic cultivator beside him. He noticed the man's behavior seemed unusual.</p><p>Old Devil Mou chuckled, evading the question. "Old Blood Fiend, you're still so fond of meddling in other people's business. The Demon Lord isn't here this time, so be careful. Don't fall into the hands of that old geezer."</p><p>The elder in blood-red robes shrugged it off. "The Witch clan is a common enemy of our human race. Daoist Lingzhuzi wouldn't be so obtuse."</p><p>Despite his words, a serious look flashed in the blood-red robed elder's eyes.</p><p>Old Devil Mou opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted.</p><p>Lingzhuzi abruptly opened his eyes, turning towards the space outside.  A radiant light flickered in his eyes.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators were startled. They followed Lingzhuzi's gaze, but saw only a chaotic storm.</p><p>Just as everyone was puzzled, they suddenly heard a sharp cicada chirping sound.</p><p>The sound was unusually urgent, initially very faint, yet it cut through the thunderous roar of the storm, clearly reaching everyone's ears.</p><p>"Dry Leaf Cicada! It's Old Devil Fang!"</p><p>"Him!  What's that old monster doing here?"</p><p>Hearing the cicada's cry, the human Nascent Soul cultivators' faces changed.</p><p>Even Lingzhuzi showed a serious expression.</p><p>Conversely, the Witch clan cultivators had hints of joy on their faces, as if the newcomer was a powerful reinforcement.</p><p>The cicada's chirping grew louder, seemingly overpowering the storm. Wave after wave of sound assaulted their ears, causing an unsettling irritation.</p><p>A moment later, a gust of wind suddenly tore through the storm. The cicada's chirping reached a fever pitch, affecting the Golden Core cultivators, making their expressions somewhat strange.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The gust of wind rushed into the calm space and dissipated quickly, revealing its source.</p><p>Gasps of disbelief filled the air.</p><p>The newcomer wasn't a cultivator, but a cicada, no bigger than a fist!</p><p>The cicada's wings resembled dry leaves.  Cultivators familiar with spiritual insects instantly recognized it as a rare and legendary insect – the Dry Leaf Cicada!</p><p>The Dry Leaf Cicada appeared, its twin eyes shining with an unnerving intelligence, as if containing a human soul.</p><p>The Grand Shaman darted towards the Dry Leaf Cicada, his voice filled with surprise. "Daoist Fang, I didn't expect you to come as well."</p>
