<h1>Chapter 926:  Zou Lao's Invitation</h1><p>Before this, Qin Sang needed to try using the power of the Ba Xue Fruit to forcefully break through to the late stage of the third transformation of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.  </p><p>Within the perilous Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>More strength meant a better chance of survival.</p><p>In a quiet chamber of his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a star platform, adjusting his state, with a jade box containing the Ba Xue Fruit beside him.  With his current physical strength, he wasn't as afraid of the impact of the medicinal power.</p><p>During his previous breakthrough to the third level, Qin Sang had consecutively taken Qing Wu Root and Ba Xue Fruit to forcibly break through the barrier.</p><p>The remaining medicinal power after breaking through the bottleneck carried a risk of collapse due to his insufficient physical body, so he had to activate the Tian Yao transformation, transferring most of it to his phoenix wings.</p><p>Even so, he benefited greatly from the remaining medicinal power he refined, otherwise he wouldn't have broken through so quickly.</p><p>Now, even if the breakthrough failed, consuming the Ba Xue Fruit would still significantly enhance his physical body.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's condition reached its peak.</p><p>He closed his eyes, opened his mouth wide, and directly swallowed a Ba Xue Fruit.</p><p>As the medicinal power spread in his abdomen, Qin Sang, experienced in dealing with this, had a contorted expression but his body remained still. He forcibly endured the initial impact, methodically managing the medicinal power.</p><p>The violent medicinal power surged like a tide, rampaging through his body. Qin Sang's face turned pale, and he let out a muffled groan, but he didn't manifest his phoenix wings. Instead, he endured the pain, preparing to let his body refine the fruit's medicinal power.</p><p>His skin was translucent, clearly showing the boiling flesh and blood.</p><p>Qin Sang felt like his body was being torn apart, and a tingling pain emanated from the depths of his bone marrow – an unbearable experience for ordinary people. He sweated profusely, emitting a strange odor.</p><p>It seemed that more impurities were being expelled, though the effect was far less than during his breakthrough.</p><p>Wave after wave of medicinal power was stubbornly endured by Qin Sang.</p><p>He let out a long breath, discovering that he was soaked in sweat. Slowly clenching his fists, he felt a clear improvement in his physical body, but he was still some distance from a breakthrough.</p><p>After all, he had been practicing this technique for a short time.</p><p>Qin Sang inspected his internal condition and muttered to himself, “Most of the medicinal power is latent within my body. I must refine it before I can consume more Ba Xue Fruit.  Ba Xue Fruit is not like Qing Wu Root; taking two fruits together risks collapsing my body and requires transferring the excess to my phoenix wings, which is wasteful. I don't need to strengthen my phoenix wings and improve my escape techniques right now. Furthermore, my physical body should be strengthened step by step, building a solid foundation. Relying solely on medicinal herbs will inevitably lead to hidden problems.”</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang suppressed his thoughts and circulated his cultivation technique to refine the remaining medicinal power.</p><p>More than a year passed like this.</p><p>A figure flew out of the cave dwelling, disappearing into the azure Demon Sea in a few blinks.</p><p>Qin Sang, carrying the Heavenly Corpse Coffin, flew towards Great Waste Island.</p><p>His external body was currently sealed within the Heavenly Corpse Coffin. After refining the blood beads, his cultivation had reached the peak of the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The hidden dangers of the rapid cultivation technique were now fully evident.</p><p>The disparity in cultivation between Qin Sang and his external body was too great.  The power of the Jade Buddha remnant in his soul sword and the secret techniques in the *Zhong Yuan Mo Tai* were no longer sufficient to subdue his external body's demonic soul.</p><p>The ferocious demonic intent couldn't be resolved.  His external body was a true demon. If released, Qin Sang would be the first victim.</p><p>Only by activating his Tian Yao transformation could Qin Sang forcibly suppress the backlash and control his external body in battle.</p><p>Normally, he could only seal the external body in the Heavenly Corpse Coffin to keep it dormant.</p><p>More than ten days later, Qin Sang's遁光 slowed, landing on Great Waste Island, and used the teleportation array to return to the Inner Sea.</p><p>He had an appointment with Elder Zou to meet on Tian Xing Island before the Seven Kills Hall opened. He wondered if Elder Zou had the patience to wait for him until now.</p><p>Back in Tian Xing City, Qin Sang went straight to the Qiong Yu Commerce Guild shop.</p><p>‘Daoist Qingfeng, you’re finally here! Daoist, you're elusive, disappearing for years at a time.  Zou almost thought…’</p><p>Elder Zou quickly walked into the shop. His gaze swept across the room, and upon seeing Qin Sang, he sighed in relief.</p><p>“Elder Zou thought I perished?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s lips curled into a smile, then his expression turned serious. “I’ve been preparing to enter the Seven Kills Hall, delaying my arrival for a few days. Fortunately, I haven't missed the deadline. Has Elder Zou already made arrangements to act with the friends from the East Pole Alliance?”</p><p>Elder Zou nodded. “Indeed, I was a bit late, and the jade talismans outside have already been distributed. Even the occasional ones that appear are being sold at exorbitant prices.”</p><p>I, too, need to do something for the Merchant League first, just like last time with the Daoist Master. Fortunately, two fellow Daoists accompanying me have some connection with Mr. Zou and can offer some assistance.”</p><p>Hearing Mr. Zou say this, Qin Sang nodded without asking further, unwilling to be drawn into the turmoil of the Merchant League.</p><p>Mr. Zou paused slightly before continuing, “Over the past few years, I’ve traveled extensively, finally identifying three locations that are crucial to visit.  I’m fairly confident about the first two.  However, the last location, a hidden area, is said to contain ancient restrictions and is extremely dangerous; I need help. I've already persuaded two fellow Daoists to assist. If you, Daoist Master, manage to obtain your desired treasure beforehand, feel free to join us there to explore.  After entering, apart from the herb I need, we’ll divide the rest of the treasures equally.”</p><p>Mr. Zou then produced a map and pointed it out to Qin Sang.</p><p>The map was extremely detailed, showing two hidden locations Qin Sang had never heard of, revealing the effort Mr. Zou had invested.</p><p>His lifespan was nearing its end; this was his last gamble.</p><p>“Flower Fairy Lake?”</p><p>Upon seeing the location Mr. Zou pointed to, Qin Sang looked surprised. It was the entrance to Flower Fairy Lake, where he and Madam Liu had ambushed Cui Ji.</p><p>Mr. Zou noticed the change in Qin Sang’s tone, “Daoist Master, have you been there?”</p><p>From beneath his cloak, Qin Sang glanced at Mr. Zou and shook his head. “I only passed by, I didn't dare enter. Mr. Zou, you wouldn’t be going into Flower Fairy Lake, would you? That’s one of the Seven Killing Palace’s three most toxic areas…”</p><p>“Daoist Master, rest assured,” Mr. Zou chuckled, interrupting Qin Sang, “We’ll only operate on the outermost edges of Flower Fairy Lake. The toxins there aren't as potent as those in the depths. With our cultivation, we can withstand it for a while.  Plus, I’ve prepared some antidote pills, enough to last until we leave. Take this token; crush it at the entrance, and I'll sense it.”</p><p>“If I manage to resolve my own issues, I will consider joining you, Mr. Zou.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the token.</p><p>Meanwhile, he was thinking that even without Mr. Zou's invitation, he would try to go to Flower Fairy Lake if he had a chance, to see if he could use the fat silkworm's abilities to gain something.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite happy to help Mr. Zou.</p><p>He was quite familiar with Mr. Zou and knew his character. If he could help him achieve Nascent Soul stage, he'd gain a powerful ally.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang knew that achieving Nascent Soul was not easy.</p>
