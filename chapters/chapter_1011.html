<h1>Chapter 1003: Years Apart</h1><p>Qin Sang followed the two women through the stone path.</p><p>Ahead, the path suddenly brightened, and a scene like a peach blossom spring appeared before their eyes.</p><p>Flowers bloomed in profusion, waterfalls cascaded, and young girls danced among the flowers, with bees and butterflies fluttering around them.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, and felt his mood relax a little.</p><p>He had once thought that if he didn't pursue the ethereal immortality, finding a paradise-like cave and spending the rest of his life there would be a life not lived in vain.</p><p>“Our sect has long been in decline.  Master, as the sect leader, only had the cultivation of late Foundation Establishment. After Master passed away, we set up an additional defensive formation, then went out to recruit more disciples. Our sect is humble; please forgive its appearance, Daoist.”</p><p>Wang Shi gently brushed a strand of hair from her forehead and said with a smile.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Wang Shi, feeling that she was different from before, as if she had undergone some kind of transformation, but he couldn't say why.</p><p>Under the curious gazes of the young girls, Qin Sang followed the two women into the bamboo house.</p><p>“These disciples have good aptitude. You two have worked hard.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the Wang sisters' sect only had female disciples, and he smiled inwardly.</p><p>Wang Xiang bustled about, first serving spirit tea, then bringing out a pile of spirit fruits, claiming they were incredibly delicious, and repeatedly urging Qin Sang to try them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony, and chatted with the two women, reminiscing about the past.</p><p>“By the way, Fei You warned me and then we separated.  Has he been here?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Wang Shi smiled faintly and said, “It wasn't in vain that the two of you followed you, Daoist. Fei You is quite thoughtful. He didn’t come back, but he managed to send a message, which is how we learned that your strength has far surpassed our imagination.”</p><p>Wang Shi's beautiful eyes flickered, and she asked with some confusion, “Fei You said you had several late Core Formation cultivators following you. Where are the other fellow Daoists?”</p><p>“Fei You exaggerated a bit. You've met the Two-Headed Vulture. Its strength has greatly increased, and it can indeed fight late Core Formation cultivators. One of the others was just my avatar. As for the other Daoist, they weren’t following me, but happened to be there and helped. However…”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile. “After Fei You left, I was found by Old Devil Mou. First, my avatar self-destructed, and then I was forced to release the Two-Headed Vulture to escape with my life…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the situation, and the two women gasped in alarm, their faces filled with tension.</p><p>Being pursued by Old Devil Mou had cost him dearly.</p><p>Qin Sang had no one to confide in, and today he finally felt some relief.</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and he said in a deep voice, “Old Devil Mou might still be alive. He will definitely keep looking for me. You and Fei You must be careful in the future and not reveal your true identities.”</p><p>Wang Shi was startled. “With righteous and demonic cultivators gathered to hunt down Skywind Island, Old Devil Mou actually managed to escape?”</p><p>Wang Xiang was both shocked and angry. “That old devil deserves to die! Fortunately, my sister and I were careful enough. We always conceal our identities when we go out.”</p><p>“Old Devil Mou’s cultivation is second only to Grand Patriarchs, and his methods are诡异.  His strength among Nascent Soul ancestors is top-notch.  Escaping death isn’t impossible.”</p><p>Qin Sang then asked about Ran Luo's whereabouts.</p><p>He learned from Wang Shi that after the chaos in the Demon Sea, Old Zou had become disheartened and withdrawn from worldly affairs.  Ran Luo and some other members in the Demon Sea soon left the merchant association to seek their own fortunes.</p><p>They were still in contact.</p><p>After receiving Fei You’s warning, the Wang sisters immediately sent a message to Ran Luo, who also went into hiding in time and was now safe.</p><p>After their conversation, Qin Sang learned that the Wang sisters were not doing well.</p><p>They knew their hopes of reaching Nascent Soul were slim, and most of their savings from the Demon Sea had been used to develop their sect. After this incident, they didn’t dare to go out and seek opportunities casually.</p><p>Not only did they not have the money to buy pills to clear demonic qi, but they didn't even have their own lifebound magic treasures.</p><p>Wang Shi was still using the jade writing tablet Qin Sang had given her years ago.</p><p>They had collected some spirit materials for refining magic treasures, but they were reluctant to hire a skilled refining master.</p><p>“Show me the spirit materials you’ve collected. Since I’m free recently, I’ll see if I can help you refine some magic treasures.”</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The two women’s faces lit up with joy. “Thank you, Daoist.”</p><p>They had never seen Qin Sang refine magic treasures, but they didn't doubt his abilities at all.</p><p>After asking about their requirements, Qin Sang went to the nearest market city to Spring Peak Island and rented a refining chamber.</p><p>Although it wasn't his first time refining magic treasures, Qin Sang was still very cautious.  Not only did they need to be successfully refined, but they also needed to be compatible with the two women, to serve as their lifebound magic treasures.</p><p>Since they were only low-grade magic treasures, the bones and hides of Core Formation demon beasts could be used as refining materials. Qin Sang added some of his own, enhancing the power of the treasures slightly.</p><p>Soon after, two magic treasures were created.</p><p>Back at the bamboo pavilion, Qin Sang raised his hand, and two streaks of light flew out, floating in mid-air, flickering and transforming into a phoenix hairpin and an elegant flying sword.</p><p>Not only were they powerful, but they were also beautiful and appealing.</p><p>Seeing the treasures, the two women couldn't take their eyes off them.</p><p>“This is my hairpin!”</p><p>Wang Xiang grabbed the hairpin, unable to put it down.  She grinned foolishly for a while, then put it in her hair and danced in front of the mirror, admiring herself.</p><p>Wang Shi gently stroked the flying sword, feeling it resonate with her, and couldn't help but be captivated.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang’s gaze, Wang Shi blushed and bowed to him. “Thank you, Daoist.  Words cannot express our gratitude. We will always remember your kindness.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. “I don’t have many friends in the Vast Ocean. These two magic treasures are a small token of my regard. After this farewell, I don’t know when we will meet again. Take care, fellow Daoists.”</p><p>“Are you leaving now, Daoist?”</p><p>Wang Shi sensed something in Qin Sang's tone and her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>Wang Xiang stopped dancing, her brows furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the two women two masks, which he had specially refined to conceal their appearances and auras. He then stood up, bowed, and without hesitation, strode out.</p><p>The two women hurriedly followed.</p><p>At the exit of the stone wall, Qin Sang turned to bid farewell to the two women, summoned his Flood Dragon Soul and flying chariot, and soared into the sky.</p><p>After a long while, Wang Xiang softly said, “Sister, let’s go back.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>…</p><p>Flying over the boundless sea, Qin Sang looked up at the clear blue sky.</p><p>This wasn't the first time he'd experienced such a parting, and he didn’t know how many more he would face in the future.</p><p>It had been over a century since he left the Small Cold Region.</p><p>He didn’t know how many of his old acquaintances were still alive, and how many had become dust.</p><p>Separated by life and death.</p><p>However, thinking back, he hadn't made many true friends in the Vast Ocean. He probably had more enemies than friends.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly, put away his thoughts, and looked ahead.</p><p>He traveled almost non-stop, returning to Sky Fortune Island.</p><p>After entering the city, Qin Sang remembered the stories of the Four Saints he had heard before. He paused to admire Four Saints Mountain for a moment, then walked towards the teleportation hall.</p><p>After teleporting to Great Wilderness Island, he skillfully went to purchase the latest nautical charts.</p><p>Ordinary demon beasts posed no threat to him. To comprehend the Killing Talisman, he had to venture deeper into the Demon Sea to find stronger opponents.</p>
