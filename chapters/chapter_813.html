<h1>Chapter 805: The Star Spirit Net</h1><p>“Success!”</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang, and he quickly suppressed all distractions, concentrating on completing the hand seals of the cultivation technique.</p><p>The Azure鸾 vanished into his body upon entering.</p><p>This was merely Qin Sang's visualization, using the Azure鸾 as a conduit to draw the power of the stars into his body.</p><p>At this moment, invisible to Qin Sang, a faint light enveloped him. It was the power of the celestial stars. He had successfully taken the first step.</p><p>With stellar energy entering his body, he bypassed the refinement stage. Driven by the cultivation technique, the stellar power circulated throughout his body, a refreshing sensation spreading through his being, his flesh and blood seemingly rejoicing.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was immersed in this comfortable feeling, a sudden change occurred within his Purple Mansion. A sinister and terrifying force invaded, directly assaulting his Nascent Soul.</p><p>“The Star Scourge!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank as he focused on the state of his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He had great confidence in the Jade Buddha, but he was also worried about unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>This power was peculiar, unlike anything he had encountered before.</p><p>There were legends of extraplanar demons in the cultivation world, said to be incredibly terrifying, capable of slaying even the most powerful cultivators. He wasn't sure if this force had any connection to them.</p><p>The Star Scourge was the name given by the Great妖 who created this cultivation technique.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Turbulence stirred within his Purple Mansion. Qin Sang felt waves of icy coldness. The Star Scourge brought with it immense terror.</p><p>The Star Scourge surged madly towards his Nascent Soul.</p><p>At the moment of contact, the Buddha's light emanating from the Jade Buddha didn't even ripple. The Star Scourge was like hitting a wall, completely blocked by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>Unable to penetrate the defense, the Star Scourge slowly dissipated.</p><p>As long as it didn't invade his Nascent Soul, expelling it would be much easier. The Nascent Soul was precisely the most vulnerable part of every cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang had just breathed a sigh of relief when a tearing pain suddenly coursed through his body, causing him to frown.</p><p>He discovered that when the celestial star power began to temper his body, it was no longer so comfortable. His flesh and blood felt as though they were being repeatedly torn apart and reconstructed. Pain and comfort alternated during the refinement process.</p><p>Qin Sang fully circulated the cultivation technique, experiencing the changes in his physical body.</p><p>When he awoke from his meditative state, he felt a stickiness and realized that his body was covered in a thin layer of sweat.</p><p>Tempering the body with stellar energy, while strengthening the physical body, also expelled impurities within.  Although Qin Sang hadn't cultivated any body refinement techniques, his body had been tempered during his successive breakthroughs, so the effect wasn't very pronounced.</p><p>The benefits of a higher cultivation level were evident.  The initial cultivation speed would be faster.</p><p>With a flash of spiritual light, Qin Sang wiped away the sweat, feeling refreshed.  Looking at the dissipating starlight around him, he thought to himself that this cultivation technique was quite discreet. He could practice it at Bao Gu Mountain, no longer needing to wander around.</p><p>He looked inward, examining the state of his physical body.</p><p>Cultivating a demonic technique, and visualizing the Azure鸾, a demonic creature, although the process went smoothly, he couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive, worried about potential problems.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined himself, relieved to find no disharmony.</p><p>He continued to meditate and cultivate, drawing in stellar energy until dawn, when the rising sun brought a sense of heat, and he finally stopped.</p><p>After a night of diligent cultivation, the gains were substantial, and Qin Sang was very satisfied.</p><p>This was indeed a top-tier cultivation technique. Qin Sang could clearly feel his physical body transforming under the tempering of the celestial star power. Reaching the level of the Hooked-Nose man wasn't just a pipe dream.</p><p>“Years of travel, several battles in the Seven Kills Sect, including two life-or-death struggles against two powerful late-stage peak enemies, have deepened my understanding of the Killing Talismans. I don't need to deliberately seek out battles for now. There’s still no news of the Ten Divine Woods, and I’ll likely face a bottleneck in my cultivation soon. I might as well cultivate both techniques simultaneously. I’ll practice the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* at night, striving to break through to the third level before the Seven Kills Sect opens again. Cultivating both Dharma and body, possessing a combat prowess comparable to a late-stage peak cultivator, is the only way to pass the Sword Path...”</p><p>Qin Sang was determined to follow this path. The *Celestial Demon Transformation* gave him the capital to forge a new path.</p><p>"However, breaking through the bottleneck won't be easy. Stellar Infusion..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the description of the cultivation technique. Stellar Infusion required a location abundant in both celestial star power and spiritual energy. The ideal place was Finger Peak.</p><p>Reaching Finger Peak was currently impossible. He could only find a similar special location in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>"The requirements for the second level bottleneck aren't that high... Right!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered something. He rummaged through his Qianjun Ring and retrieved a ball of silk thread.</p><p>This ball of thread appeared tangled, but with a gentle flick from Qin Sang, it unfolded into a large net, floating in the air. It was the Star Spirit Net given to him by Granny Jing.</p><p>Back then, this Star Spirit Net had helped him quickly collect Star Essence Stones and win first place at Finger Peak. Now it could play a role again!</p><p>“The celestial star power drawn into the body can't be fully utilized, and it's a pity to let the dissipating starlight go to waste. The Star Spirit Net can capture it and allow me to reuse it, which is much more efficient than drawing in new star power, further increasing my cultivation speed. Moreover, with the Star Spirit Net, I can gather enough celestial star power to complete the first Stellar Infusion and break through to the second level of the cultivation technique...”</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the brighter his eyes became.</p><p>He hadn't expected an artifact that had lain dormant in his Qianjun Ring for decades to play such an amazing role in his cultivation.</p><p>Of course, without the Jade Buddha, all of this would be a fantasy.</p><p>Other demonic beasts cultivating this technique would be exhausted from refining the Star Scourge, and wouldn't have the energy to think about reusing it. Only he dared to be so unrestrained.</p><p>"The third level bottleneck requires countless times more celestial star power than the second level, exceeding the limits of the Star Spirit Net. However, the technique also provides an alternative method: consuming spirit herbs that strengthen the physical body.  It requires a combination of three spirit herbs, all of which are unheard of.  I'll inquire about them when I return. As for the fourth level, the requirements are even more stringent.  One must first comprehend the Celestial Demon Dharma Form before breaking through. There are no shortcuts, and it’s probably no easier than Nascent Soul formation.  My current realm is insufficient, it's too ethereal, I have no clue..."</p><p>Qin Sang spent the entire day consolidating his cultivation, exploring his potential, and deepening his understanding of the cultivation technique.</p><p>When night fell, he deployed the Star Spirit Net, enveloping himself within it, and began to cultivate.</p><p>During his cultivation, starlight surrounded him. The starlight that would normally dissipate was now captured by the Star Spirit Net and reintegrated into his body.</p><p>This cycle continued, and his cultivation speed was indeed much faster than the previous night!</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, his face filled with delight. This cultivation technique was very suitable for him. It was a pity it was created by demonic cultivators, so he could only benefit from its body refinement aspects. It was an incomplete technique.</p><p>Otherwise, when he reached the end of the *Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter*, he could completely switch to cultivating the *Celestial Demon Body Refinement*.</p><p>Having just started, Qin Sang was eager to continue, and remained on the island.</p><p>For ten consecutive days, he cultivated at night and consolidated his understanding during the day, thoroughly grasping the true meaning of the cultivation technique before finally leaving the deserted island and flying back to Tianxing Island.</p><p>He needed to break through to the second level as soon as possible so he could cultivate the Celestial Demon Transformation.</p><p>The Celestial Demon Transformation was the most important divine ability of the first three levels of the technique, granting exceptional combat power.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if he, as a human, could cultivate it successfully, but he was filled with anticipation.</p>
