Chapter 1837: Refining Void's Heavenly Might


A shadow in the clouds outlined the silhouette of a colossal bear. Only its upper body, already occupying half the sky, was visible to the naked eye.  Mountains and rivers sprawled beneath the bear, appearing exceptionally small.  The bear stood between heaven and earth, like a deity gazing down upon all creation, driving mountains and rivers before it, accompanied by wind, thunder, lightning, and a vast tide of spiritual energy.

At this moment, the earth trembled, and the heavens shook.

A Dharma Idol!

Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his face paling as he recalled rumors about Spirit Leap King. This demon was precisely a bear that had achieved enlightenment.

His worst fears had materialized. Spirit Leap King had not been lured away by Grand True Man but had personally come to capture him!

Ahead, auspicious clouds filled the Healing Platform, seemingly within reach, yet Qin Sang felt an illusion of immeasurable distance.

‘Rumble!’

The earth shuddered.

It was unclear whether the colossal bear Dharma Idol was charging across the ground or if the mere image of the Dharma Idol was creating such a spectacle.

In the blink of an eye, dark clouds spread across the sky. The colossal bear Dharma Idol drew closer. Although still far away, at the Dharma Idol's speed, the distance was insignificant.

Terror gripped Qin Sang. This was instinct, unrelated to his mental fortitude.

It wasn't his first time facing the Dharma Idol of a Refining Void stage demon cultivator.  Years ago, when he emerged from the altar with Dao Court experts, he had encountered a Dharma Idol blocking the path.

Back then, others shared the pressure, and the Dharma Idol targeted the Dao Court Immortals. He was merely collateral damage. However, the feeling of dread remained vivid in his memory.

Qin Sang had believed that, now capable of slaying late-stage Nascent Soul Demon Marquises and possessing the Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol, he might fare better when encountering a Demon King.

Only when truly facing this crisis did he realize how simplistic his understanding of Refining Void experts had been.

At this moment, only one thought remained in Qin Sang's mind.

Escape!

‘Rumble…’

Thunder roared.

Qin Sang dared not hold back, frantically channeling the Azure Phoenix's innate lightning power through his integrated Dharma Idol.

Blinding lightning erupted from the phoenix wings, engulfing Qin Sang, transforming him into a sphere of lightning.

The demons saw the lightning sphere and noticed one side, facing the Healing Platform, bulging slightly.  Then, electric arcs sparked outwards, extending into a bolt of lightning that strained towards the auspicious clouds. The main body of the lightning sphere couldn't keep up, resembling a water droplet.

Suddenly, the surrounding demons snapped awake, realizing this wasn't an illusion. The lightning sphere was changing precisely as they saw it.

Time seemed to stretch infinitely, with every subtle shift of the lightning sphere clearly displayed.

The lightning, which should have been incredibly swift, seemed to encounter immense resistance, slowing down!

This stemmed from the colossal bear Dharma Idol in the distant sky.

Too far away to arrive in time, the Dharma Idol couldn't stop Qin Sang, could only watch as he escaped into the Healing Platform.

However, at this moment, the Dharma Idol's massive eyes locked onto the lightning sphere, unleashing a dazzling divine light, like a sun and moon hanging in the sky, its scorching radiance piercing the void.

Qin Sang's mind reeled as if struck a heavy blow, and then he discovered something even more terrifying.

He had the illusion that the sky was collapsing!

The surrounding Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi underwent a bizarre transformation, solidifying like cast iron, imbued with an astonishing Heavenly Might, transforming the world he should freely traverse into a cage!

Refining Void experts could directly manipulate Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi.

It was said that when they cast Divine Dao techniques, they could merge with Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi to a certain extent, drastically increasing their power, making them incomparable to earlier realms.

For instance, a Dao technique Qin Sang learned at the Profound Heaven Palace, the *Profound Heaven One Qi Great Capture Hand*.

Nascent Soul cultivators used their own True Essence to condense a Profound Heaven giant hand, at most drawing upon some Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi through Celestial Resonance, infusing it with the might of heaven and earth.

Refining Void cultivators, however, could directly control Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, transforming it into a colossal hand capable of seizing stars and capturing the moon.

No matter how vast one's True Essence, how could it compare to the boundless Heaven and Earth?

Now, Qin Sang truly experienced the terror of a Refining Void expert. Even from afar, unable to reach with their divine abilities, they could manipulate Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi, using Heavenly Might to imprison him, easily shattering his escape technique!

The surrounding demons quickly grasped the situation, their hearts filled with awe for Spirit Leap King, and they looked at Qin Sang with grim smiles.

Their emotions had fluctuated wildly in a short span.

First, they were shocked by Qin Sang's power, watching helplessly as he escaped.

Now, they were invigorated.

But immediately following, their expressions froze.

‘Screech!’

A resounding phoenix cry emanated from Qin Sang, echoing through heaven and earth.

Azure light flickered around Qin Sang, and then an Azure Phoenix flew out from his crown, spreading its wings.

The Azure Phoenix appeared illusory, incomparable to the colossal bear Dharma Idol, yet their auras shared similarities.

The divine Azure Phoenix soared, its feathers scattering points of azure light like a starry tail, a magnificent sight.

The moment the Azure Phoenix appeared, the colossal bear Dharma Idol's gaze fixed.

The Dharma Idol resisted the Heavenly Might, and the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Qi began to flow again, breaking the cage around Qin Sang.

The pressure on Qin Sang lessened dramatically. He let out a long cry, transforming into a bolt of lightning, and under the astonished gazes of the demons, he charged into the auspicious clouds, disappearing into the mist.

‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’

‘Rumble…’

A fierce wind howled, lightning flashed and thunder roared. The colossal bear Dharma Idol arrived, carrying celestial phenomena, stopping outside the Healing Platform, its eyes gleaming.

The shadow enveloped the demons, jolting them awake.

“This subordinate is incompetent, please punish Your Highness!”

The demons knelt, their faces filled with trepidation, including the demoness.

The culprit had escaped into the Healing Platform right before their eyes.  Even Spirit Leap King's personal intervention couldn't stop him. They didn't know if his wrath would be vented upon them.

The demoness's face paled slightly.  Just now, she had exerted all her strength, barely dodging the Sun God Bird, escaping with her life.

The colossal bear Dharma Idol ignored the demons, its gaze fixed on the auspicious clouds, as if trying to see through them.

The demoness gritted her teeth.  The only option now was to redeem herself.  “This subordinate will lead a team into the Healing Platform and swear to bring back his corpse!”

The colossal bear Dharma Idol glanced at the demoness, slightly narrowing its eyes. “Forget it! His aura doesn't match. He is not our target! And…”

The dark clouds retreated.

Spirit Leap King's true form never appeared, leaving only a faint remark:  “You are not his match.”

Qin Sang vanished, the Dharma Idol retreated.

Calm returned outside the Healing Platform.  Fu Hou and the other demons soon received the news and rushed over.

The demons looked at the auspicious clouds outside the Healing Platform, their expressions varied.

…

Inside the Healing Platform.

Qin Sang charged through the auspicious clouds without pausing, swiftly traversing the outer golden halls, crossing the Nine-Bend Star River, entering the depths of the Healing Platform.  His heart pounding, he finally escaped back to his cave dwelling with his last breath.

Recalling his recent experience, Qin Sang shuddered, remaining silent for a long while.

He had anticipated that frequent travels between the two locations might lead to unforeseen circumstances.  He had simply relied on his considerable strength, believing he could resolve most crises.  Who would have thought he would encounter a Demon King on his first trip?

His survival was pure luck.

Moreover, Qin Sang still didn't understand the reason, having been chased for reasons unknown.  While grateful, he felt mostly helpless.

“The Source of Calamity is becoming increasingly dangerous…”

Qin Sang sighed inwardly, deciding that he shouldn't act rashly unless absolutely necessary.

With the escalating conflict between the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom, similar incidents were bound to occur.  He wouldn't be so lucky next time.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang's desire to avoid the impending chaos intensified.

He summoned his Dharma Idol, looking up at the slowly flapping wings of the Azure Phoenix, thinking, “I owe my life to you this time.”

The Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol was his greatest reliance.

The Dharma Idol could help him withstand the Refining Void's Heavenly Might, providing a sliver of hope, but it was clearly not strong enough.  He was still powerless against a Demon King.

“If *Demonic Refinement* breaks through to the fifth level, mid-stage, the Dharma Idol will definitely transform further.  I wonder if I'll be able to protect myself against a Demon King…”

Qin Sang pondered, realizing that *Demonic Refinement* should remain his focus.

In fact, that's precisely what he had been doing for the past eight years.

After breaking through to mid-stage Nascent Soul, Qin Sang could sense that the insights gained from his battle with Xia Hou might not be sufficient to propel him to late-stage Nascent Soul.

After all, Xia Hou wasn't at his peak, and Qin Sang's strength couldn't be simply measured by his realm.

To break through to late-stage Nascent Soul, he needed to find stronger opponents and engage in exhilarating battles!

Such opponents, within the Ghostfang Kingdom, were likely only the top Demon Marquises under the Demon Kings, or perhaps geniuses who had grasped the Dharma Idol ahead of time.  All of them held high positions and were rarely seen.

Even when venturing out, they seldom traveled alone.  Conflicting with them might attract a Demon King.

Compared to *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, *Demonic Refinement* was easier to break through.  Qin Sang's choice was obvious.

“Cultivate to the peak of the fifth level, mid-stage as quickly as possible, and attempt a breakthrough. Put other matters aside for now…”

Qin Sang made his decision.

The Aperture Poison Fruit's toxicity was far more potent and concentrated than the flower dew.  Despite the short eight years, his progress had been astonishing.

He had intended to allocate some time to gradually explore the Healing Platform, searching for the path to ascension, but now he changed his mind.  It wouldn't be too late to act after his breakthrough.

This pursuit had instilled a sense of urgency in Qin Sang, a feeling that great change was imminent.

His gaze darkened as he stared at the cave's stone door, closing his eyes for a long time before retrieving the Poison Fruit extract and swallowing a drop.

…

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

During these ten years, Qin Sang only returned once when his Radiant Flower Pills ran out.  The rest of the time, he remained in his cave dwelling, diligently cultivating.

That trip went smoothly.  The Source of Calamity remained unchanged, the previous incident seemingly forgotten.  Qin Sang had deliberately inquired at Ju Mountain City, but only gathered vague rumors, not credible enough to believe.


At this time, within the cave dwelling, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, not cultivating, but performing a type of Witch Clan secret art.

The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew out from his dantian, spreading its wings and hovering before him.

Man and insect faced each other, motionless for a long time, the cave falling into an eerie silence.

If someone were present, they would see a thin thread of blood extending from Qin Sang's brow.

The blood thread was incredibly fine, barely visible to the naked eye.  The other end connected to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, spreading into a net that covered its entire body, including its wings.

The dispersed blood threads appeared even more fragile, lightly covering the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's surface.  As time passed, they seemed to be slowly merging into its body.

Gradually, a faint bloody glow appeared on the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, and the patterns on its wings were embedded with blood threads, fusing silently.


After an unknown amount of time, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly gently fluttered its wings, seemingly in some pain.

Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, sensing the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's thoughts, gently soothing it and retrieving a Radiant Flower Pill to feed it.

The Heaven's Eye Butterfly quickly calmed down, absorbing the medicinal power.

Several more hours passed, and Qin Sang abruptly opened his eyes, his expression serious. He continuously formed various hand seals, not directing them towards the Heaven's Eye Butterfly but merging them into the blood thread at his brow.


‘Snap!’


The blood thread broke.  Then, a rich bloody light surged from Qin Sang's brow, revealing a strange Dharma Seal within.


The Dharma Seal flashed, vanishing into the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's body.


The Heaven's Eye Butterfly stiffened for a moment, the Heaven's Eye patterns on its wings shining brightly. As the divine light flowed, its aura began to fluctuate dramatically!


Fifth Transformation, Mid-stage!


With a constant supply of Radiant Flower Pills and Qin Sang's continuous feeding of his essence blood using the secret art, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly finally advanced, though still much slower than Qin Sang.


This highlighted Qin Sang's astonishing current cultivation speed.


Looking at the flitting Heaven's Eye Butterfly, sensing its joy and excitement, Qin Sang smiled silently, lifting his finger and letting it perch there, feeling its transformation.


Spirit insects only grasped new divine abilities after undergoing transformations or mutations.  After advancing, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's existing abilities, including the Parting and Reunion Divine Light, had grown stronger, allowing it to assist him further.


After helping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly stabilize its cultivation, Qin Sang summoned the Spirit Beast Pouch. A thin line swam out from within, coiling around Qin Sang's palm.


The Fire Jade Centipede, also supported by pills, had reached the peak of the Fourth Transformation, late-stage, just a step away from transformation.  Qin Sang waited a few more years for its cultivation to solidify before attempting to help it break through.


Retrieving the Azure Frost Pill from his Thousand Jun Ring, Qin Sang took one from the jade bottle.  The pill's aura diffused, immediately agitating the Fire Jade Centipede, which lunged for the hand holding the pill, transmitting an incredibly urgent desire.


It couldn't resist the allure of the Azure Frost Pill.


“Feeding this pill to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly back then would have also been beneficial.  All three Azure Frost Pills are for you.  Don't disappoint this poor Daoist…”


Qin Sang muttered, flicking his finger gently.


The Azure Frost Pill flew towards the Fire Jade Centipede, which immediately embraced it, refining it into its body amidst flickering firelight.


The Azure Frost Pill could help spirit insects break through. Its medicinal properties were extremely overbearing, causing the Fire Jade Centipede to curl up tightly.


Qin Sang also used techniques to assist its refinement. Unfortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede wasn't his 본명 Spirit Insect, preventing him from using many profound secret arts from the *Panhu True Scripture*.


After a long while, the medicinal power began to fade, and the Fire Jade Centipede's contorted body relaxed.


During this process, its aura fluctuated, but it didn't truly break through, gradually subsiding.


“It failed.”


Qin Sang shook his head slightly.


This was within his expectations, so he wasn't too disappointed.


He gently tapped the Fire Jade Centipede's carapace with his finger, helping it suppress the chaotic medicinal power within its body.


Though the breakthrough failed, residual medicinal power remained. Refining this would also be beneficial, laying the foundation for the next breakthrough.


Therefore, the three Azure Frost Pills didn't need to be consumed consecutively. He would administer the second pill after some time, progressing gradually.


After the Fire Jade Centipede fell into slumber, Qin Sang stored it in the Spirit Beast Pouch and resumed his own cultivation.


…


Another seven years passed.


Qin Sang remained in the Healing Platform's cave dwelling, enduring the boredom and solitude.


On this day, the cave was as quiet as ever.


The Heaven's Eye Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, seemingly also asleep, occasionally fluttering its wings.


Suddenly, azure light flashed across Qin Sang's body.  Phoenix wings materialized, abruptly spreading open.


The Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol emerged within the azure light.


Startled awake by the sudden change, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly immediately took flight, hovering before the cave's stone door, standing guard.
