<h1>Chapter 1314: The Curious Artifact</h1><p>Chapter 1314: The Curious Artifact</p><p>“Recently, all of you have worked together diligently in preparation.  The Grand Ceremony will be held upon our return from Ziwei Palace.  I will invite many fellow practitioners to witness the event. We must not diminish Qingyang Temple's prestige.”</p><p>Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>He thought to himself, Qingyang Temple is newly established, and its strength is still too weak. The number and cultivation levels of its disciples are far from comparable to other sects.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to be selective rather than accepting everyone.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, leveraging his reputation, had recruited many new disciples, including some Golden Core cultivators, but they were still under observation and could not be entrusted with important tasks yet.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone was overjoyed but also felt a heavy responsibility.</p><p>Qin Sang's reputation had spread throughout Bei Chen.</p><p>At that time, most Yuan Ying stage cultivators in Bei Chen would likely attend the ceremony, so they couldn't afford to make a fool of themselves.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out a jade slip.</p><p>“Yu Fu, arrange personnel to prioritize the mining of these spirit ore veins.”</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planned to thoroughly study the art of refining weapons, requiring a vast number of materials for practice.  He didn't need to worry about these small matters; the younger generation could handle them.</p><p>Afterwards, Li Yu Fu and the others took their leave, but Shangguan Li Feng stayed behind.</p><p>“Master, I've made up my mind. I will walk the path of the killer! From now on, I abandon the blade and cultivate the sword!”</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng unbuckled the long dao from his back, his expression firm.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, gazing into Shangguan Li Feng's eyes.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng showed no fear, meeting Qin Sang's gaze with unwavering composure.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>“Good! I will now transmit to you the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*!”</p><p>…</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang brought Shangguan Li Feng to Qingzhu's tomb.</p><p>“Senior Qingzhu has shown me great kindness, for which I can never repay. The Sword Scripture is his final work. Unfortunately, I can only comprehend its intent, not fully cultivate it; I am only considered half a disciple. From now on, I will pass on the teachings of my master and transmit the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture* to you.”</p><p>Before Qingzhu's tomb, incense smoke curled upwards.</p><p>Qin Sang paid his respects to Qingzhu with three bows, his back to Shangguan Li Feng, and said in a low voice.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng, with a solemn expression, stepped forward and kowtowed respectfully to Qingzhu,</p><p>“Disciple Shangguan Li Feng, pays respects to his master! Thank you, Master, for transmitting the scripture!”</p><p>Qin Sang said softly, “By cultivating the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, you become Senior Qingzhu's disciple. We are already old friends; from now on, consider us equals, call me Senior Brother.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng was startled, hesitant to overstep his bounds, before finally saying, “Junior Brother greets Senior Brother Qin!”</p><p>Qin Sang patted Shangguan Li Feng on the shoulder.</p><p>He didn't particularly like ranking people based on cultivation level. The rules of Qingyang Temple would certainly not be like those of Xiaohua Mountain.</p><p>“This sword scripture embodies Senior Qingzhu’s life’s work. He was exceptionally talented, but unfortunately, his fate was ill-starred, and he met an untimely end, a great loss. Otherwise, Bei Chen would soon have another Grand Cultivator.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed with regret. He deeply admired Senior Qingzhu, and every time he thought of the peach blossom tree in Youming Valley, he couldn't help but lament.</p><p>“You are the first to cultivate the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, and you will also be the head of the sword cultivator lineage of Qingyang Temple.  I hope you will not forget your initial aspirations and not disappoint Senior’s efforts!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn as he handed the scripture to Shangguan Li Feng.</p><p>Shangguan Li Feng knelt on both knees, raised his hands above his head to receive the scripture, and then kowtowed to Qingzhu's tomb, vowing to dedicate his life to the sword path.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded secretly. “Get up. We also have a senior sister, Senior Qingzhu’s daughter. I’ll introduce you to her when the opportunity arises. Your sudden switch from dao to sword will surely bring some discomfort. Don't rush into seclusion; first, find Yu Fu and get a spirit sword suitable for you, and recruit some promising sword cultivators. After some outside experience, then come back to cultivate the scripture; you'll gain more that way.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A few days after Shangguan Li Feng left, Qing Jun returned.</p><p>During those days, Qin Sang had been engraving puppet seals onto a Yuan Ying spirit puppet and had encountered difficulties, so he immediately left seclusion to seek Qing Jun’s advice.</p><p>In the stone pavilion,</p><p>The two sat opposite each other. The Qingluan puppet shrank in size and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, showing considerable affection.  One might mistake Qin Sang as the puppet's master.</p><p>At that moment, the Tianmu butterfly flew out on its own.</p><p>A phoenix and a butterfly played together.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet stood aside, and Qing Jun extended her hand to gently press down.</p><p>The next moment, the Yuan Ying puppet shone brightly, and both the talisman and puppet seals appeared in its body simultaneously. The two forces collided and intertwined, seemingly devouring each other in chaotic struggle.</p><p>Its facial expression reflected intense struggle, and its eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>“It’s not a major problem. I overlooked some key points earlier. A slight modification will suffice.”</p><p>Qing Jun quickly understood the situation. With a few taps of her jade fingers, streams of light flowed into the soul-infused puppet.</p><p>Soon, the puppet seal calmed down, and the talisman no longer pressed aggressively. The two forces coexisted peacefully.  The talismans were being transformed into puppet seals, and Qing Jun worked much faster than Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, relieved, leaned back in the wooden chair, leisurely sipping a cup of peach blossom wine brewed by her senior sister.  She watched Qingluan and the Tianmu butterfly playfully chasing each other, feeling more relaxed than ever before.</p><p>“Senior Sister, what happened earlier? Do you need help? I plan to visit Bing Han at the Xu Ling Sect in a few days to learn about artifact refinement. I expect to stay there for a while.”</p><p>Qing Jun replied, “It’s fine. I still need to verify some things. You just do your own thing. Bing Han is quite shrewd. Getting the Xu Ling Sect’s legacy from her will be difficult. Be careful and don’t fall for her tricks.”</p><p>At that moment, a whooshing sound came from the valley.</p><p>Bai had left seclusion.  Before his figure even arrived, his voice echoed, “My cultivation base is now stable. I need to use earth-sha spirit energy to further cultivate and strive to improve my strength before the Zi Wei Palace appears. Qin, you mentioned a place called Di Chen Cave. Where is it?”</p><p>Bai appeared before the stone pavilion. Seeing Qing Jun, he seemed somewhat wary, his expression turning serious as he bowed, “Greetings, Daoist Qing Jun.”</p><p>Then, Bai’s gaze shifted to the soul-infused puppet in front of Qing Jun.</p><p>“Di Chen Cave is near Shao Hua Mountain, guarded only by Qi Condensation disciples. As long as Brother Bai doesn’t cause a commotion, you don’t need to worry about being discovered by Dong Yang Bo…”</p><p>Qin Sang said, sipping her peach blossom wine, when she suddenly sensed something amiss with Bai’s aura.</p><p>She looked sideways. Bai’s eyes were vacant, his face blank as he stared at the soul-infused puppet with an expression of disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, calling out, “Brother Bai…”</p><p>“This thing…”</p><p>Bai, eyes fixed, pointed at the soul-infused puppet, his voice trembling, “Where did you get this?”</p><p>Qin Sang then remembered that Bai had never seen a soul-infused puppet before.  Judging by his expression, could there be some secret about it?</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned serious, and she sat up straight.</p><p>Qing Jun also looked surprised, putting away her secret technique.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged a glance.  Qin Sang said, “This is a soul-infused puppet, a legacy of the Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace. I obtained it some time ago at Blood Lake. Dong Yang Bo was plotting against Gong Liang Yu, and I happened to be there and seized it. I didn’t mention it to you before… Brother Bai, do you recognize this?”</p>
