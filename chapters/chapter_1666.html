<h1>Chapter 1657: The Seven Mansions and Their Divisions</h1><p>As the demonic fire infused it,</p><p>the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel resembled a black demonic pearl.</p><p>A fine Buddhist treasure, now defiled by demonic fire, it could be called a demonic artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang’s consciousness sank into the Mani Jewel, sensing his protective energy shield was still intact.  The demonic fire was strengthening the shield; perhaps “Demonic Fire Shield” would be a more accurate name.</p><p>Demonic fire served as the power source for the shield.</p><p>It was certain that not only demonic fire, but other spirit fires could also be absorbed by the Mani Jewel. The stronger the spirit fire, the stronger the shield.</p><p>Discovering the Mani Jewel’s properties filled Qin Sang with both surprise and joy.</p><p>He was surprised by the jewel’s ability to contain all fires—how exquisite!  Based on his understanding of artifact refinement, this was simply impossible!</p><p>At least, Qin Sang hadn't yet tested the limits of the shield's power.  He continuously infused the Nine Netherworld Demonic Fire, and the shield correspondingly strengthened, showing no signs of slowing.</p><p>His joy stemmed from obtaining this extraordinary treasure, which would bring immeasurable improvements.</p><p>Skilled in fire manipulation, he had obtained the Nine Netherworld Demonic Fire and the Southern Ming Li Fire, two top-tier spirit fires, through fortunate circumstances.  He never lacked offensive capabilities, but his defensive abilities were lacking.</p><p>After breaking through to late-stage Nascent Soul, he felt the protective shield provided by the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel was insufficient.</p><p>As an artificer, he had considered crafting a protective artifact for himself, but suitable materials were hard to find, and his energies were focused on the Fire Seed Lotus, causing the project to be shelved.</p><p>In times of danger, he either relied on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's ability to perceive illusions for early warning, or on his superior escape techniques to quickly get out of dangerous situations and engage the enemy.</p><p>However, when facing danger from all sides, this weakness became apparent.</p><p>A wise man avoids danger. Qin Sang’s approach had been to retreat whenever possible, even if it meant missing opportunities.</p><p>With the Mani Jewel in hand, the situation was completely different!</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demonic Fire, an offensive spirit fire, transformed into a strong Demonic Fire Shield once infused into the Mani Jewel, providing exceptional defense.</p><p>The drawback was the inability to be both offensive and defensive simultaneously. The shield only remained active while the demonic fire and the Mani Jewel were unified.  The demonic fire remained Qin Sang’s most convenient and commonly used offensive technique, which he could not abandon.</p><p>Without his natal spirit sword, his sword array's power was slightly weaker; the Sun God Bird was powerful enough, but lacked agility.</p><p>Of course, using the shield to defend against enemy attacks would greatly deplete Qin Sang's true energy, but this was a minor issue compared to the other drawback.</p><p>He would need to adapt his approach based on the situation, relying on his mastery of the demonic fire to shift between offense and defense. This would severely test his ability to seize opportunities.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang retracted the demonic fire, suspending the Mani Jewel before him and refining it slightly. It was surprisingly smooth, likely due to his prior refinement of the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, saving him much trouble.</p><p>Just as he was about to explore the Mani Jewel's other functions, his secondary body transmitted a thought.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Mani Jewel transformed into a beam of Buddha light and, like the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, could be stored within his dantian.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, flashing to the top of the forest canopy, looking up at the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>Having just left the Yang Flame Divine Ban, he had a general grasp of the Five Elements Divine Ban.</p><p>Clouds and mist encircled the mountain, representing the manifestations of the Five Elements restrictions. The core of the restrictions was the Five Elements Divine Ban, arranged according to the cyclical generation of the elements, with each ban displaying unique phenomena.</p><p>For example, in the Yang Flame Divine Ban, fire flickered, and the clouds and mist resembled fire clouds.</p><p>There were clear boundaries between the Yang Flame Divine Ban and its neighboring bans.  The clouds and mist to the west were dark yellow and dense, indicating the Earth Element Divine Ban to the left. Therefore, he deduced that the Metal Element Divine Ban would be to the left of the Earth Element Divine Ban, close to the shady side of Emperor's Mandate Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected the Metal Element Divine Ban would undergo a change, instructing his secondary body to monitor it. His suspicion was confirmed.</p><p>The Metal Element Divine Ban shone with countless points of light, like stars, dyeing the clouds and mist into a golden sunrise.</p><p>However, there was now turmoil in those clouds and mists. Although the light had not dimmed, and even appeared brighter, there was a sense of fragmentation, with parts colliding, indicating conflict within the ban itself.</p><p>This fragmentation wasn't obvious, obscured by the layers of clouds and mist, but it couldn't escape Qin Sang's keen eyes.</p><p>And not just Qin Sang's.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, Mo Xing Dao, the Poison King, and Master Huai Yin, all high-cultivation individuals with sharp eyes,</p><p>could also discern the signs.</p><p>After brief consideration, Qin Sang made his decision—he would enter the Metal Element Divine Ban to investigate!</p><p>With his newly obtained Mani Jewel, while his ability to withstand the celestial fire in the Yang Flame Divine Ban had greatly increased, breaking through the ban would still take effort.</p><p>The Metal Element Divine Ban had clearly been affected by something.</p><p>For them, even a slight flaw in the protective formation, if seized upon, could be turned into a winning opportunity, an easy escape.  There was no reason to miss a shortcut!</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind to go, but before acting, he first withdrew his clone.  The purpose of this trip was the uninscribed jade tablet beyond the Five Elements Divine Restriction. Breaking the restriction was the top priority; he could unleash his clone to help in a fight later.</p><p>With the Mani Pearl, his main body's safety was assured.  His clone, however, was inferior to others, let alone the elusive and mysterious expert secretly watching, who might even be a hindrance.</p><p>Putting away his clone, he also hid the Fire Jade Centipede in his sleeve. Qin Sang’s figure darted forward, re-entering the Five Elements Restriction, unaware that Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were also retreating from the Yangyan Divine Restriction, making the same choice.</p><p>Luckily, the restriction's range was vast, and the two parties didn't encounter each other on the outskirts.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang entered the depths of the cloud and mist, arriving at the edge of the Gold Element Divine Restriction.  Unexpectedly, from the outside, this place was dazzling with clouds and mist.  Up close, however, Qin Sang saw a gloomy and dim scene.</p><p>Various formations and restrictions flooded Qin Sang's mind. Many could create this kind of scene, but none quite fit.  Unable to understand it, he could only try it himself.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Golden Sinking Sword, activated the Gang Fire Shield for protection, and stepped in!</p><p>In an instant, the world spun.  All ambient sounds disappeared, along with the light, nearly plunging him into the darkness of a late night, in a vast wilderness; only Qin Sang's figure stood alone, making the place feel even more desolate.</p><p>Silence reigned.  The Yangyan Divine Restriction rained down celestial fire, yet here, it was dark and quiet—two extremes.</p><p>Qin Sang stood firmly, looked down, and saw rough, sloping rocks under his feet, with boulders scattered around. There was no path, but that didn't stop him from climbing.</p><p>"Is this the true mountain body of Di Shou Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. Through the Sky Eye Butterfly, he had basically confirmed that these rocks were not illusions, they were real.  He had been directly sent into the mountain. Where was the Gold Element Divine Restriction?</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, a feeling rising in his heart, and quickly raised his head.  Above the heavens, stars shone.</p><p>There was no moon here, only the flickering starlight. Compared to the real world, the stars here were sparse, not even forming a complete galaxy; the sky seemed incomplete, and the starlight was not bright enough.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, motionless for a long time. He had a feeling that there were eyes on each star, watching him, and the qi of all the stars had locked onto him.  He felt like he had been thrown into a star sea, cut off from the world.</p><p>Under his gaze, the starlight gradually brightened, but the ground remained dim and quiet; the stars shone only on Qin Sang!</p><p>The starlight entered Qin Sang's pupils.  His Sky Eye divine ability pierced through the essence of the stars, revealing them to be swords suspended high in the sky!</p><p>"This is... a sword formation!"  Qin Sang realized.</p><p>This place used a sword formation to replace the function of the Gold Element Divine Restriction, maintaining the cycle of the Five Elements. Qin Sang was curious how the array master had accomplished this.</p><p>He soon discovered the secret.  These star-like sword intents were fewer than the stars in the heavens, hence their sparseness, but their positions corresponded to something.</p><p>Three Enclosures, Four Symbols; only one Symbol was selected!</p><p>"The Western Seven Mansions! The White Tiger constellation!"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked. The array master had actually used swords to create a star constellation—a breathtaking feat.</p><p>The White Tiger represents metal and symbolizes slaughter.</p><p>As this thought arose, Qin Sang felt as if his whole body was targeted by sharp sword qi, a chilling atmosphere, and even through the Gang Fire Shield, he felt an inexplicable stinging sensation.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, this was one of the top sword formations of the Golden Phase Hall—the Seven Mansions Dividing Field Sword Formation!</p><p>The Seven Mansions are the White Tiger constellations.  The swords drew power from heaven and earth, channeling the star constellations; the White Tiger descended into the world, representing the ultimate killing power of the world's swordsmanship.  The Golden Phase lineage, with its sword cultivators, jointly deployed the Seven Mansions Dividing Field Sword Formation, slaying demons during the demonic calamity and achieving immortal glory.</p><p>The Seven Mansions Dividing Field Sword Formation was perfectly suited for this place.</p><p>...</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin searched around Di Shou Mountain.  They had already detected anomalies in the Gold Element’s direction but, lacking information, had not acted hastily.</p><p>After circling the mountain, they indeed made a discovery. They found several traces of battles, using clues to track the movements and identities of those who fought.</p><p>"This must be the work of Old Daoist Zi Lei."</p><p>The Poison King pointed to a scorched area in the forest. The life force of the plants there had been extinguished, but a unique thunderbolt aura remained underground.</p><p>The Poison King was familiar with this aura; it was unique to Zi Lei Zhenren, the master of the Eight Scenic Views.</p><p>The Eight Views lightning cultivation method is incredibly difficult, with only a few achieving entry-level proficiency, and even fewer reaching mastery.  In the present day, only Elder Zi Lei has attained such a high level.  Even among the Eight Views' past masters, his talent is unparalleled.</p><p>The Poison King, drawing in a wisp of energy, felt the purple qi swirling in his palm, and couldn't help but praise Elder Zi Lei's skill.  This served as a warning to Master Huaiyin not to underestimate him.</p><p>Relations between Daoist and Buddhist sects had been relatively amicable in the past, but the Eight Views' clandestine appearance here was intriguing.</p><p>Master Huaiyin nodded. He was already familiar with Elder Zi Lei's reputation.  Seeing the lingering effects of the battle firsthand, he couldn't help but admit that the reality surpassed expectations.</p><p>Judging by the remnants of the battle, both sides were comprised of two peak-level experts. The opposing side seemed to have been pursued relentlessly by Elder Zi Lei and Elder Hegao, or perhaps they were simply trying to escape and avoid prolonged combat.</p><p>"I sense the aura of a Yin Demon," Master Huaiyin said, hands clasped.</p><p>The Poison King chuckled, "It's undoubtedly Fan Laomo's Ten Thousand Demons Yin Scripture. It seems the old devil was forced to unleash the ninth transformation of the Myriad Illusion Nether Lotus, barely managing to withstand Elder Zi Lei's lightning techniques.  He's not worried about his Nether Lotus being shattered, either! The other person's aura is more mixed, but their power is considerable…"</p><p>Following the trail, Master Huaiyin reached the edge of the clouds, stating firmly, "They pursued their quarry this far!"</p><p>The Poison King looked into the depths of the clouds, observing the turbulent scene. "The unusual phenomenon might be their doing. Master, you saw how this mountain is sealed by a five-elemental restriction.  Any entrance will be blocked. Since we haven't found the old thief's tracks, we might as well follow them."</p><p>Master Huaiyin agreed. The two entered the clouds and soon arrived at the sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Another section of the Seven Stars Division Sword Formation.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao faced a similar predicament to Qin Sang, battling the formation's attacks, observing the stars, sensing the formation's energy, and searching for an escape route.</p><p>…</p><p>Below Emperor's Mandate Mountain.</p><p>The nuns of Yan Yue Temple faced a difficult choice.</p><p>Yan Yue Temple's legacy includes both Gold and Water aspects of divine power.  The ruins of both halls held significant allure. In addition, Emperor's Mandate Mountain displayed strange phenomena, and an unknown celestial hall, somewhere, presented a momentous opportunity.</p><p>Four destinations – which to choose?</p><p>Finally, the abbess decided to split into two groups.  They had discovered that the Gold Hall remained untouched, with no signs of others nearby, making it relatively safe.</p><p>Leaving half of her less powerful followers behind, she repeatedly urged them to be cautious and to withdraw if they encountered any difficulty.</p><p>The Gold Hall was commissioned from an Earth aspect master of formations.  While not as complex as the myriad halls of the Earth Hall, it was still quite extensive, encompassing many mountains. Sword cultivators were independent and disliked being too close to others' dwelling places.</p><p>The hall integrated various sword formations, nested within each other. Every mountain peak was a sword; affecting one would affect all, making it the most dangerous of the five halls.</p><p>The other group, led by the abbess herself, included most of the skilled nuns, among them Liuli.</p><p>They first circled Emperor's Mandate Mountain, noticing surging mists halfway up, and clouds further above – clear signs of danger. They decided to observe for a while, bypassing Emperor's Mandate Mountain and proceeding to the Water Hall.</p><p>Then, they were stunned.</p><p>The Water Hall had vanished, replaced by a vast expanse of ice.  Its legacy was completely obliterated.</p><p>"What a ruthless killer!"</p><p>The nuns gritted their teeth in frustration, but could do nothing.  Even if they knew the culprit, there was no way to retaliate.</p><p>With a sigh of resignation, the abbess noticed Lang… nearby and rushed over, relieved that Lang… hadn't been harmed.</p><p>Knowing a map of the Wuxiang Celestial Gate was located on the first floor, the abbess entered the Jade Pavilion. She was surprised to find the map intact.  She ordered her followers to prepare for action, activating the restriction.</p><p>The Wuxiang Celestial Gate materialized before them.</p><p>Liuli stepped forward, standing beside the abbess, quietly inquiring about the location of the Celestial Hall's teleportation array.</p><p>The abbess consulted Yan Yue Temple's records to identify the most likely locations for the array, but remained unsure. This map would help eliminate possibilities.</p><p>The abbess studied the map, pondering, drawing on her memories of texts and the scenery she had witnessed. Comparing these with the map, she eliminated three locations, but remained uncertain about two.</p><p>"Clifftop… Northern Forbidden Zone…"</p><p>The abbess pointed twice.</p><p>Liuli committed them to memory.</p><p>Overhearing the abbess' plan to seize any opportunity presented by other cultivators vying for the Celestial Hall's treasures while searching the Gold Hall and Emperor's Mandate Mountain, Liuli decided to search for the Celestial Hall alone.</p><p>The abbess worried about Liuli facing many powerful cultivators alone; the treasures of the Wuxiang Celestial Gate were already enough for them. However, Liuli was adamant.</p><p>Her goal of seeking her master had guided her cultivation, and any other treasure was secondary.</p><p>"I will be careful," Liuli stated resolutely, leaving the Jade Pavilion alone.  "If you find a special sword manual on cultivating spiritual swords in the Gold Hall, please bring it back."</p>
