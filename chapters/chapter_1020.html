<h1>Chapter 1112: Spiritual Root of Heaven</h1><p>The leaders of the three major merchant alliances arrived together.</p><p>A group of Foundation Establishment cultivators remained silent, curiously watching the powerful cultivators in the front row, expecting a good show.</p><p>Disappointingly, after exchanging greetings, they ceased further interaction.</p><p>The mottled gate of the Seven Killing Hall seemed to possess some magical allure, captivating the attention of all the Nascent Soul masters, who stared intently without uttering a word.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed the three alliance leaders.</p><p>Having joined the East Pole Alliance for so long, he finally saw the leader in person—the refined scholar.</p><p>The three alliance leaders were notoriously enigmatic, rarely appearing in public, leading to much speculation.</p><p>Even their cultivation levels remained a mystery.</p><p>Some claimed their cultivation was comparable to the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi, also powerful cultivators; otherwise, neither the righteous nor demonic paths would tolerate the alliances' existence.</p><p>Other rumors suggested their strength was somewhat weaker, necessitating their alliance.</p><p>With the leaders standing nearby, but not revealing their auras, Qin Sang couldn't gauge their true realms.</p><p>The Demon Lord's earlier words gave Qin Sang some insight.</p><p>The three alliance leaders were akin to cultivators possessing priceless treasures, thus they dared not easily leave their secluded abode. Their cultivation might be slightly inferior to the Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi.</p><p>Of course, these were merely Qin Sang's conjectures.</p><p>A subtle unease settled in his heart.  He hadn't expected the various human leaders to gather here. The situation within the Seven Killing Hall was exceptionally complex, and he only hoped it wouldn't affect him.</p><p>Shortly after the arrival of the three alliance leaders, several more groups of cultivators arrived—all members of the alliances.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, one familiar face emerged from among them.</p><p>Su Nu!</p><p>Decades ago, during the chaos in the Demon Sea, Qin Sang, along with Yue Xiangu, ventured deep into the Demon Sea to obtain the Maoshan Vine and secure passage back to the Inner Sea. They rescued a woman—Su Nu.</p><p>Since then, Qin Sang hadn't visited Yue Xiangu and hadn't seen Su Nu again.</p><p>He hadn't expected this reunion.</p><p>Su Nu, along with several Foundation Establishment cultivators, followed closely behind the East Pole Alliance's Nascent Soul master, her gaze unwavering, as she entered the plaza and stood behind the alliance leader.</p><p>Yue Xiangu was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"Following the alliance leader into the Seven Killing Hall, she holds such a high position within the East Pole Alliance! Could she not be Yue Xiangu's disciple?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly.</p><p>He'd initially suspected the relationship between Yue Xiangu and Su Nu, and now it seemed far from straightforward.</p><p>"Eh? Her cultivation…."</p><p>Qin Sang gasped, his eyes flashing with sudden shock.</p><p>Su Nu's cultivation was clearly at the late Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p>When they rescued her, she was merely at the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>In just a few decades, Su Nu had transcended several realms, including the challenging Foundation Establishment stage, reaching the late stage, a level not inferior to his own. This was astonishing.</p><p>At that time, Qin Sang was already at the middle Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Compared to her, Qin Sang felt his years of cultivation had been wasted.</p><p>Only a Spiritual Root of Heaven, unhindered by the Foundation Establishment limitations, could explain such an astounding cultivation speed.</p><p>"I missed the chance to befriend a cultivation genius."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>No wonder she caught the eye of the East Pole Alliance leader, and Yue Xiangu spared no effort to save her.</p><p>Besides rare spiritual herbs and ancient cultivation techniques, the resources available in the East Pole Alliance far surpassed those of Shao Hua Mountain.  Su Nu's rapid breakthrough was perfectly reasonable.</p><p>Chen Yan, Su Nu.</p><p>He had encountered two cultivation geniuses with Spiritual Roots of Heaven. Their reputation was well-deserved. He just wondered if Su Nu would also be trapped at the Nascent Soul bottleneck, like Chen Yan.</p><p>Qin Sang noted Su Nu's position among the crowd, following closely behind the Nascent Soul cultivator, highlighting her status.</p><p>Su Nu stood there silently, head bowed.</p><p>She seemed to sense something and glanced back, a hint of confusion in her eyes, before returning her gaze to the entrance of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>"Junior Sister, what's wrong?"</p><p>A handsome young man beside her leaned in, asking with concern.</p><p>Su Nu frowned slightly, shaking her head.  "Nothing. Why hasn't the Seven Killing Hall opened yet? I heard this time it's different from the past, only a hundred years have passed. The trial realm the alliance leader mentioned… could something have gone wrong?"</p><p>"As long as the Seven Killing Hall opens normally, we'll be able to enter the trial realm. Junior Sister, don't worry. This senior brother will do his best to obtain a bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid for you. Besides, the alliance leader favors you so much, even if there's no Soul Cleansing Liquid in the trial realm, they will certainly find a way to help you find a similar herb. With your talent, you don't need to worry about Nascent Soul breakthrough at all."</p><p>The young man patted his chest, speaking confidently.</p><p>"I'm not worthy of such kindness from my senior brother and the alliance leader. I just wish my senior brother good luck in obtaining the Soul Cleansing Liquid and achieving a Nascent Soul breakthrough soon."</p><p>Su Nu's expression turned serious, speaking obediently.</p><p>No one noticed a layer of gloom flashing in her beautiful eyes.</p><p>……</p><p>The crowd waited before the Seven Kills Hall for a full hour, the number of cultivators arriving steadily dwindling.</p><p>Suddenly, the ancient plaque above the Seven Kills Hall blazed with light.</p><p>This sight invigorated the assembled cultivators.</p><p>The light from the plaque grew even brighter, too intense to look at directly.</p><p>The hall itself, and the entire white jade plaza, began to tremble gently.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The doors of the Seven Kills Hall swung open of their own accord.</p><p>Simultaneously, the light from the plaque condensed into a single column of light that shot down to the ground, dividing the entrance to the Seven Kills Hall into two, before the hall returned to its usual stillness.</p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd, but no one dared to act rashly. All eyes turned to the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi looked to the Demon Lord.</p><p>The Demon Lord waved a hand dismissively.  “Go on, I’m not interested in such trivial matters.”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi, unoffended, walked up the steps to the entrance of the Seven Kills Hall, reaching into the column of light as if to touch the plaque itself.</p><p>After a moment, Ling Zhuzi nodded subtly, withdrew his hand, and turned to the assembled cultivators, giving a slight smile. “The entrance to the trial realm is now open. You may enter.  It seems the inner hall is unaffected by its premature opening.  You may all proceed without worry.”</p><p>The crowd rejoiced.</p><p>……</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>At the edge of a celestial barrier, a considerable distance from the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>In a mountain hollow, several cultivators were hidden, their auras completely suppressed.</p><p>One of them was none other than the Nine-Phoenix King!</p><p>“King Jiao Long, you lured us here under false pretenses.  Speak plainly! How much longer must we wait before entering the inner hall? Are you certain we can infiltrate the human sacred grounds undetected? Don't forget, we're all trapped within the Inner Sea. If we're discovered, escape is impossible. We’ll be at the mercy of those cultivators.”</p><p>A burly man growled, his voice laced with impatience and apprehension.  </p><p>Strangely, a large black turtle shell was visible on his back.</p><p>The man’s words were directed at a dignified middle-aged man, who turned to the Nine-Phoenix King in response.</p>
