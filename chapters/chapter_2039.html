<h1>Chapter 2030: Attachment</h1><p>Elder Three's spiritual senses, while not as sharp as the two Transcendent Void cultivators, immediately sensed something was terribly wrong upon witnessing their reactions and the terrifyingly calm expression of Young Master Xin.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A long whip flew from Elder Three's sleeve, its crimson shadow lashing mercilessly towards Young Master Xin.</p><p>As the whip shadow approached, Young Master Xin's eyes remained unwavering.  Suddenly, Elder Three felt a sharp constriction, letting out a muffled groan as he was kicked away by Mingling.</p><p>The whip's formidable power was no match for Mingling's strength, and both it and its wielder were flung away, failing to harm Young Master Xin in the slightest.</p><p>At this moment, Zhong Liang and Pei, abandoning their fight, focused their attention.</p><p>Young Master Xin's figure began to fade, as if an invisible door were opening in the void, allowing her to escape. If she were merely fleeing, their reaction would not have been so intense.</p><p>However, Young Master Xin had long been planning this, using herself as bait, and manipulating Elder Three to lure them here. This clearly indicated a much grander scheme.  Unless she was unconcerned about future repercussions against the Xin family, she would never dare allow them to leave alive!</p><p>A mere Nascent Soul cultivator daring to scheme against two Transcendent Void cultivators simultaneously sounded like a fantasy, yet it was happening before their eyes.</p><p>They couldn't understand how Young Master Xin had done it, but an ominous feeling intensified, an unprecedented sense of grave danger closing in on the two Transcendent Void cultivators.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Pei, furious and humiliated—a moment ago he’d felt so in control—felt as if he'd been slapped.</p><p>Zhong Liang retracted his golden sword, allowing Pei to fully control the Profound Sun Limitless Array. Abandoning the attempt to capture Mingling, he channeled the array’s power into the Nine Suns, which blazed with intense light.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Streams of fire erupted from the suns, hurtling toward Mingling and Young Master Xin. The terrifying heat seemed capable of igniting the void itself.</p><p>Before the fire reached them, flames erupted on Mingling's surface.</p><p>Elder Three, caught in the crossfire, stripped of Mingling's protection, experienced firsthand the power of the Profound Sun Limitless Array.  Even though the fire wasn't aimed directly at him, he felt like he was about to be incinerated.</p><p>Simultaneously, Zhong Liang attacked. His nine-storied pagoda trembled slightly, each level emitting a wave of dark golden light, dyeing the entire structure in dark gold.</p><p>To the naked eye, the pagoda seemed countless times heavier, plummeting downward with devastating force.  Even a mountain wouldn't withstand its impact; if Mingling were struck, serious injury was inevitable, and Young Master Xin, hidden within, would be in grave danger.</p><p>The pagoda and the fire streams, either attack capable of easily obliterating any Nascent Soul cultivator.  That the two were cooperating to deal with a mere Nascent Soul cultivator was a cruel irony.</p><p>As death approached, Young Master Xin showed no fear, her gaze cold and resolute.</p><p>"Haven't you two been wanting Mingling all along?  Consider it a gift!"</p><p>Mingling roared, its body flooded with pure darkness. Its form dissolved into a pool of black water, from which countless arms surged out, grasping towards their enemies, as if trying to drag them into a dark abyss.</p><p>Black figures erupted from the arms, as Mingling transformed into countless beings, launching a frenzied assault. These shadowy figures shattered and exploded against the fire and the pagoda, yet the black water flowed endlessly, the void itself becoming viscous.</p><p>At this moment, Mingling unleashed unimaginable power. The cost, however, was tremendous; everyone present felt Mingling rapidly consuming its essence, a self-destructive act.</p><p>To deal with them, Young Master Xin was willing to sacrifice the Xin family's ancestral Mingling in a final, suicidal gambit!</p><p>Despite Mingling's protection, they failed to capture Young Master Xin.</p><p>Her figure completely vanished, leaving behind only a black stone inscribed with strange, indecipherable runes.</p><p>Pei and Zhong Liang stared at the black stone, an intense sense of danger washing over them.</p><p>Both ignored Elder Three, allowing him to escape with his life.  Elder Three, his strength far inferior to the two Transcendent Void cultivators, knew that if Young Master Xin's plan succeeded, they might survive—but he would certainly die!</p><p>Shockwaves continued to wash over him as he fled, like a leaf adrift on a storm-tossed sea.  Just as he neared escape…</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The void trembled incessantly.</p><p>Elder Three’s heart skipped a beat, then he saw a terrifying sight.</p><p>The sky was falling!</p><p>Several islands ahead began to crack and groan.  Mountains split, sending countless boulders tumbling.  As the islands shattered, the void seemed to collapse, and the dense black clouds above lost their support.  The center of the collapse was behind him; black clouds surged in from all directions. Elder Three saw black currents of cloud falling from the sky. This wasn't just dark clouds; the entire island mountain array was collapsing, unleashing devastating energy towards them.</p><p>At the array’s core, the black clouds collapsed in a tumultuous waterfall of destruction.  Elder Three was too late to escape.  He was engulfed, his protective aura shattered, spitting blood, instantly gravely wounded.  The destructive power of the collapsing array was terrifying, capable of obliterating everything.</p><p>He glimpsed two figures,  Pei Gongfeng and Zhong Liang Sanren, desperately trying to escape, repeatedly pushed back by the cloud torrent.  Despair was etched on their faces.</p><p>Deep within the array…</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze was drawn to the scene behind him: islands crumbling, collapsing, black clouds converging towards a single point.  It looked like a deep pit, the lowest point, a vortex drawing in the clouds.  Qin Sang watched as a massive, torrential downpour of clouds cascaded downwards, the destructive storm expanding dramatically.</p><p>In that moment, Qin Sang understood.  The array wasn't collapsing from the outside in; the outer edge was the origin of the destruction. The array was imploding, its destructive energy converging at that one point. That place was the most dangerous; his current location was, paradoxically, relatively safe. Perhaps he didn't need to hide in the Qianjun Ring after all.</p><p>But why was the array collapsing?  The origin point wasn’t near him, so the Qianjun Ring was probably irrelevant.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed. He saw a figure.</p><p>This person appeared seemingly out of nowhere, standing atop a crumbling island:  Young Master Xin!</p><p>Young Master Xin stared at the cloud pit, her expression tense.  As she sensed the increasingly violent energy, she relaxed, a look of relief on her face – exactly as she had anticipated.</p><p>Her relief was short-lived; she froze, seeing Qin Sang in the distance.</p><p>Her eyes widened in disbelief.  She couldn’t believe she was seeing him here.  This was deep within the array.  Qin Sang should have been in the valley refining the crossing vessel. Even if he’d sensed the danger, he should have fled to the outside.</p><p>The array’s destruction was now in full swing.  Pei Gongfeng and Zhong Liang Sanren had almost certainly perished. The destructive storm would last for a long time before subsiding, forming a natural barrier separating the inside and outside.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang should never have been here.</p><p>Young Master Xin’s expression was clear to Qin Sang.  A thought struck him:  Had Young Master Xin triggered the array’s collapse?</p><p>Young Master Xin's subsequent actions surprised him.</p><p>She quickly composed herself, flying towards him, her expression calm.  She bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Elder Qin! I’m relieved to see you safe.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, a knowing glint in his eyes. “Young Master Xin, I imagine you didn’t expect to see me here either?”</p><p>Young Master Xin hesitated.</p><p>“Young Master Xin, what a bold move!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Young Master Xin, then turned towards the cloud pit, sighing.  “Pei Gongfeng is likely doomed.”</p><p>His lament was sincere.</p><p>Even with Young Master Xin’s composure, her earlier expression had revealed much. He’d long sensed a complex relationship between Pei Gongfeng and the Xin family, but he never imagined Young Master Xin would dare to orchestrate his death.  And if he knew that a Nascent Soul mid-stage cultivator, Zhong Liang Sanren, was also killed, he would be even more astonished.</p><p>Young Master Xin remained silent for a moment, before nodding.  “Unless a miracle occurs, Pei Gongfeng will perish here.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Young Master Xin with surprise.</p><p>She looked drained; her Mingling spirit was gone.  Even without knowing the details, Qin Sang guessed that manipulating such a powerful entity would come at a cost.  For her to still act so composed in front of him was unusual.</p><p>“Young Master Xin, you must be somewhat disappointed that you didn’t manage to eliminate me as well,” Qin Sang said calmly, though his tone held a hidden threat.</p><p>“Elder Qin, you misunderstand!”</p><p>Young Master Xin quickly explained, “My invitation for Elder Qin to refine the artifacts was genuine.”</p><p>Furthermore, I did intend to use Elder Qin, but only to attract Protector Pei's attention, distract him, and thus make him overlook me, luring him into my trap.  I have no grievance against Elder Qin, and never intended to harm him; otherwise, I wouldn't have deliberately left him in the valley.”</p><p>She pointed towards a cloud-filled crater. “Senior must have seen that only those at the very center during the destruction would have a chance to survive. I painstakingly used myself as bait to trap and kill Protector Pei, and the valley is still some distance from there. With Senior’s spiritual awareness and strength, once you sensed anything unusual, you could definitely escape. You might be slightly disheveled, but there was absolutely no danger to your life!”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, sensing the distant fluctuations. He knew there was some truth in Young Master Xin’s words. If he had stayed in the valley and reacted quickly enough to escape the formation, he likely would have survived.</p><p>However, these explanations weren't enough.</p><p>“Young Master Xin truly is a remarkable woman. I myself didn't have a guaranteed chance of defeating Protector Pei, yet you killed him. But the cost must have been great, wouldn't you say?”</p><p>He remained noncommittal, his gaze sweeping over Young Master Xin’s back, probing.</p><p>Young Master Xin understood the implication, and after a long silence, she took a deep breath and nodded heavily.</p><p>“Elder Qin, your insight is sharp! That’s right, I paid a great price.  I left Mingling there as well, to perish with them.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. He had thought Mingling was severely injured, or that Young Master Xin was in poor condition and temporarily unable to control it, but he never expected it to perish with Protector Pei.</p><p>Was Young Master Xin revealing this out of desperation?  But even if she tried to hide it, it would be futile; it would be immediately obvious as soon as he made a move.  By proactively revealing Mingling's self-destruction, she was showing that she and the Xin family no longer posed a threat. This meant he didn’t need to act immediately; he could patiently listen to her continue, perhaps finding a way forward. She was indeed clever.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't attack immediately; not entirely because of her words, but because he discovered strange lights flashing repeatedly in the deepest part of the formation as it was collapsing.</p><p>Clearly, there was a hidden secret here.</p><p>Young Master Xin’s action was likely a double-pronged strategy; her presence here alone meant she had a purpose.</p><p>Her ability to control the self-destruction of the formation showed her intimate knowledge of the place, making her useful to him.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, Young Master Xin solemnly continued, “With Mingling gone, the Xin family has no support. I am willing to lead the Xin family, to become your subordinate, Elder Qin, and serve at your command!”</p><p>“Subordinate?”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “I don't want to follow in Protector Pei’s footsteps.”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed softly, “To be honest with Elder Qin, I didn't just kill Protector Pei; I also killed the wandering cultivator Zhong Liang.”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  This Zhong Liang seemed to be another Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>Killing two Nascent Soul cultivators in one go – even he couldn’t do that.  Qin Sang had to reconsider his assessment of Young Master Xin.</p><p>“This was a gamble with the Xin family's fate; I wouldn’t have taken such a risk if I hadn't been forced. After my father's death, the Xin family was beset by internal and external troubles, and Zhong Liang intended to seize the family's assets, forcing me to seek refuge under Protector Pei.</p><p>“But while Protector Pei had some friendship with my father, he was also deceitful and coveted the Xin family and me.</p><p>“He cultivated a certain technique that he could never perfect.  It happened that a family secret technique I cultivated had a subtle resonance with his. He intended to wait until I perfected my technique to forcibly absorb my cultivation. In the best case, I would become his concubine; in the worst, he would kill me.</p><p>“Most importantly... Mingling was flawed from its birth. It has protected the Xin family for many years, reaching its limit.  Its lifespan was ending, and we couldn't find a way to prolong it!”</p><p>Young Master Xin sighed, “Without Mingling, the Xin family and I are at the mercy of others. Protector Pei would only become more unscrupulous. For years, we exhausted our resources to satisfy Protector Pei's desires.  If he had treated us sincerely, why would I have resorted to such desperate measures?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved by Young Master Xin's accusations.  “How do you know I won't be the next Protector Pei?”</p><p>“Elder Qin, do you think I have any other choices?”</p><p>Young Master Xin countered.</p><p>“The Xin family can't help Elder Qin much, but we can do small tasks. Although the treasures of Protector Pei and Zhong Liang perished with them, their cultivation grounds remain ownerless. Elder Qin surely needs people to help manage them…”</p>
