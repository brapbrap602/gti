<h1>Chapter 2039: Layered Formations</h1><p>Ripples danced on the water's surface.</p><p>Qin Sang sat alone, regulating his inner energy, his breath long and slow, gradually merging with the natural world.</p><p>At that moment, two carp swam by, circling a rock in the lake, their tails flicking gently, seemingly quite content.</p><p>Gradually, more fish gathered around the rock.</p><p>There was no bait nearby, and they didn't understand why, but they instinctively felt extremely comfortable there, reluctant to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang, in a state between sleep and wakefulness, imagined himself transforming into a fish in the lake, casting aside all distractions, preparing for the formidable enemy.</p><p>Since leaving the tomb, he hadn't had a long period of seclusion to consolidate his cultivation. But the Wu clan's incantations were not as brutal as Lei Zu's body-tempering method.  Though his foundation was affected, Qin Sang's enlightenment preceded his cultivation advancement, so it remained within manageable limits, and he was not afraid of battle.</p><p>The sun dipped below the horizon, wild geese flew south.</p><p>With a ‘splash,’ water sprayed as the fish scattered.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, the state of oneness with nature broken. He calmly watched a flying vessel approaching from the east. The vessel was uniquely shaped, with a palace on top and two enormous, white wings extending from its sides, flapping as it rode the wind.</p><p>Within the palace.</p><p>A refined-looking man sat with his eyes closed, cultivating his inner energy. This was Ling Du, the second master of the Li Yu Palace.</p><p>Others sat cross-legged on cushions below, cultivators from Bi Shui Village and Li Yu Palace positioned on either side.</p><p>In the past, although Bi Shui Village's power was inferior to Li Yu Palace, they never cowered before the Li Yu Palace cultivators. Now, having submitted, they were implicitly inferior, heads bowed, their morale low.</p><p>Suddenly, Ling Du felt something, stood up, his eyes flashing, shouting, "Stop!"</p><p>The vessel came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>Everyone was startled and confused.  They only heard Ling Du's order: "No one is to leave the White Feather Vessel!"</p><p>Immediately, Ling Du created a phantom body and departed in a streak of light. Everyone rushed out of the palace, seeing the rainbow-like light streaking westward, but the lake surface remained calm, without any unusual occurrences.</p><p>"Who dares obstruct my path?!"</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly stood up, watching the streak of light approach, revealing a person in the sky, the second master of Li Yu Palace.</p><p>It was rumored that this second master favored luxurious clothes and fine jade; indeed, he looked like a worldly prince.</p><p>Qin Sang did not judge him by appearance.  After sensing him, he found the man's cultivation was indeed remarkable, only a step away from the mid-Void Refinement stage. Whether he could break through at any moment, as rumored, was impossible to tell from his appearance.</p><p>"I am Qin Sang. You must be Master Ling of Li Yu Palace?" Qin Sang bowed politely, saying calmly, "Master Ling, if you are here because of Bi Shui Village, you may return. I will visit in person another day."</p><p>Ling Du's gaze narrowed slightly. He calmly asked, "Was it you who killed the Scattered Cultivator Zhong Liang? That cunning old fox, Zhong Liang, understood reason and knew his limits. I wonder why he offended you?"</p><p>His tone revealed no emotion, making it unclear whether this was a routine inquiry or an accusation on behalf of Zhong Liang.</p><p>Ling Du examined Qin Sang. He saw that Qin Sang's cultivation was only slightly weaker than his, but his energy was unstable, perhaps due to a shaky foundation.</p><p>Such a person had managed to kill the Scattered Cultivator Zhong Liang? Could there be other experts in Bi Shui Village?</p><p>"The Scattered Cultivator Zhong Liang was not killed by my own hand, but I was indeed present. As for the reason, Master Ling might inquire.  The cultivators who have died miserably in Feng Ju Jade Gate recently... you might find out why…"</p><p>Qin Sang intentionally left his words vague.  Ling Du, however, filled in the blanks.</p><p>Recently, more and more news had come out of Feng Ju Jade Gate; powerful cultivators were gathering there, engaged in constant battles. Many who failed to escape, or those greedy for riches, had become casualties and could not get out. Among them were renowned experts from both the Eastern Province and the Darklands. After this upheaval, a reshuffling of power was likely.</p><p>Ultimately, people die for wealth, birds for food.</p><p>Almost all conflicts stemmed from greed, and Zhong Liang was probably no exception.</p><p>Ling Du glanced towards the west bank of the Qiong Lake. Bi Shui Village was unusually quiet. He suspected Zhong Liang might have been injured while vying for treasures in Feng Ju Jade Gate, and Qin Sang had simply taken advantage of his weakened state.</p><p>Now that Zhong Liang was dead, Bi Shui Village was Qin Sang's spoils of war. But Li Yu Palace would never tolerate an outsider controlling Bi Shui Village and interfering in Qiong Lake.  He immediately shouted, "I don't care about your feud with Zhong Liang.  The current leader of Bi Shui Village has already led his entire sect to submit to this palace, signing a formal agreement. From now on, Bi Shui Village is a subordinate sect of Li Yu Palace!"</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, revealing a contract that unfurled in mid-air, the characters glowing brightly.</p><p>"The contract is here, witnessed by heaven and earth!  Do you still dare to stop me?" Master Ling bellowed.</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, "Without the sect's seal, this contract is worthless.  Does Palace Master Ling think this is so easily done? Besides, the Bi Shui Village master was merely confused; now seeing the situation clearly, he has submitted to me."</p><p>Ling Du coldly snorted, "Submitted? I say you seized it by force!  With our sect in trouble, Li Yu Palace must avenge it. Today, I will drive out the aggressors from Bi Shui Village and set things right!"</p><p>He took a sudden step forward, his imposing presence like a crashing wave, bearing down heavily.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Water surged a thousand feet into the air.</p><p>The lake stones beneath Qin Sang’s feet groaned under the pressure. His face darkened, but he showed no fear.  "Since Palace Master Ling persists in his folly, let's settle this with our hands!"</p><p>Both knew a fight was inevitable; their argument was merely a prelude to justify their actions.</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, a dazzling golden light erupted before Ling Du, like a golden sun hanging in the air. The light was like golden needles, causing pain to the eyes.</p><p>Ling Du attacked first.  From the golden light emerged a small golden hammer. Its head, smooth and round, transformed into a golden lightning bolt, appearing instantly above Qin Sang's head, aimed at his crown, and slammed down!</p><p>Before the hammer arrived, Qin Sang felt a heavy blow to his spirit, a sudden palpitation; he dared not underestimate it.</p><p>The hammer's might could shatter mountains with ease.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The lake stones under Qin Sang shattered, the lake surface caved in, forming a circular pit around him, exposing the lake bottom.</p><p>Just as the hammer was about to strike Qin Sang, a thunderous roar, like a clap of thunder, echoed.</p><p>Ling Du's expression changed slightly. He changed his incantation, pulling the golden hammer back, hovering before him. He looked at Qin Sang, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was seen holding a spirit tablet-like treasure, as large as a tombstone, wielding it with great force.  With a swing, he knocked the hammer back.</p><p>"A Strength cultivator?"</p><p>In the vast world, among humankind, spirit cultivators are the mainstream.</p><p>Though surprised, Ling Du wasn't overly shocked.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang roared, soaring into the air, attacking like a ferocious beast. The huge spirit tablet was disproportionate to his body, yet he wielded it as lightly as a feather, moving with powerful force.</p><p>This spirit tablet was obtained from Old Ancestor Ming Hu, kept as Qin Sang's weapon.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't summon his Qingluan Dharma image; instead, he merged it with his true form, secretly activating the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, feeling boundless strength surge through his body.</p><p>Ling Du, having gauged Qin Sang's abilities and seeing no change in tactics, formed a hand seal, stroking the golden hammer.</p><p>The hammer grew as large as a mountain, colliding head-on with the spirit tablet.</p><p>Their battle unfolded with unrestrained power, instantly alarming the forces surrounding Lake Qiong.</p><p>Subtle gazes were cast towards the lake's center.</p><p>...</p><p>Bi Shui Village.</p><p>Having lost their last defense, the Bi Shui Village disciples offered no resistance and were subdued by Su Nu and others.</p><p>The mountain gate was resealed, the mist closed in, and Bi Shui Village had changed hands.</p><p>Above the main village.</p><p>All Bi Shui Village disciples were imprisoned, their movements restricted by formations, only able to vent their anger with their eyes.</p><p>Su Nu ignored them, selecting Zhong Liang Scattered Cultivator's true disciples and interrogating them with spells. Soon, Bi Shui Village held no more secrets.</p><p>Several peculiar wooden tokens were found on these disciples; Su Nu gave them to Xin Sheng, saying, "With this token, you can access the core of the protective formation. Quickly go and control it!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Xin Sheng and the others retreated to carry out their orders. Su Nu was also busy, making various arrangements in anticipation of a battle with Li Yu Palace.</p><p>If they controlled the formation, relying on Bi Shui Village, and with her and Qin Sang defending together, even if all three Palace Masters of Li Yu Palace came, it would be difficult to break through.</p><p>Amidst her busy preparations, Su Nu still paid attention to the battle at the lake's center.</p><p>Su Nu felt gratitude towards Qin Sang, mixed with curiosity.</p><p>During the Seven Killing Hall's Demon Sealing Battle, Qin Sang had shown extraordinary abilities. Now, having successfully broken free from the lesser world and ascended to the Greater Thousand World, entering the Refining Void Realm, he was truly a rare genius.</p><p>Yet, Su Nu herself had achieved all this.</p><p>She wanted to know what other qualities Qin Sang possessed that made the Sovereign remember him, sparing no expense to send her here to wait at Feng Ju Jade Gate.</p><p>When Bai God General learned the news, he personally rushed over.</p><p>It was clear they were old acquaintances, which further puzzled Su Nu. If they were old friends, why didn't they meet?</p><p>Bai God General ordered himself to assist Qin Sang, and his tone suggested no ill intent towards Qin Sang.</p><p>What secrets were hidden here?</p><p>Su Nu couldn't understand and focused on the battle.</p><p>...</p><p>The center of the lake.</p><p>Qin Sang's arm muscles bulged as he swung his spirit tablet, repeatedly clashing with the golden hammer more than a dozen times in a single breath. The surrounding earth trembled and waves seemed to crash around them.</p><p>This brutal, physical combat was far more satisfying than a typical magical duel. However, Qin Sang's intention wasn't simply to fight; he wanted to test his newly mastered swordsmanship against Ling Du.</p><p>Ling Du, wielding the golden hammer, relentlessly attacked.  Seeing Qin Sang's ferocious momentum and inability to be overcome, he decided to change tactics.</p><p>The golden hammer's attack slowed, a change Qin Sang immediately noticed. He pressed his attack, a whirlwind of blows aimed at Ling Du.</p><p>Although Ling Du was only present as a spiritual body, being approached by a physical cultivator would severely limit him.</p><p>Ignoring Qin Sang's advance, he moved his lips, his right finger glowing with spiritual light as he drew a circle on his chest.</p><p>Just as he was about to finish the circle, Ling Du felt something was wrong, a warning bell ringing in his heart. He immediately stopped the spell, but it was too late. He heard the sound of a sword before seeing it, his vision suddenly plunged into darkness.</p><p>In an instant, starlight dispelled the darkness, revealing that he had been transported to a starry sky.</p><p>"A Sword Cultivator!"</p><p>Only then did Ling Du realize his opponent was both a physical and spiritual cultivator—a Sword Cultivator!</p><p>A Sword Cultivator's attacks are always incredibly swift and deadly.  Even with a fair fight, Ling Du doubted he could avoid the sword array.  Being initially deceived by the show of physical strength made it even worse.</p><p>Trapped in the sword array, Ling Du knew he’d made a mistake and would have to adopt a defensive strategy.</p><p>Among cultivators in the vast world, Sword Cultivators are some of the most feared opponents. Once a Sword Cultivator gains the upper hand, their attacks are relentless, leaving no room for counterattack.</p><p>Yet, Ling Du showed no fear.</p><p>In his view, a true Sword Cultivator wouldn't bother with deceptive tactics; they would simply strike directly.  All this elaborate maneuvering felt unnecessary.</p><p>At this level of cultivation, the pursuit of Dao is paramount, and a cluttered skillset is a hindrance.</p><p>Since this wasn't a pure Sword Cultivator, Ling Du believed he could find a weakness in the sword array.</p><p>Squinting, he surveyed the celestial expanse. The stars were formed from sword energy.  He couldn't locate the actual swords, but he recognized the constellation as the Western Seven Mansions.</p><p>The starlight trembled, spiritual energy locking onto Ling Du.</p><p>Instantly, the sword stars moved, their energy sharp and intense.  Thousands of sword lights crisscrossed the sky, about to strike.</p><p>Unfazed, Ling Du remained still, raising his golden hammer above his head, its point aimed at the sky, poised to strike, yet not quite moving, ready to meet the incoming sword light.</p><p>Simultaneously, Ling Du opened his palm, revealing a collection of fine sand.  The sand was multicolored, like crushed gemstones.  It swirled around him, forming a ring.</p><p>Incredibly, Ling Du sat cross-legged, ignoring the sword light. He flicked his fingers, sending bursts of spiritual energy into the sand ring.  The sand glowed sequentially, like a tinkling chime.</p><p>The sword light arrived, a celestial river cascading down.</p><p>The golden hammer vibrated, striking out forcefully.</p><p>The array roared, lightning flashed, and terrifying scenes manifested.</p><p>Ling Du remained steady as a mountain, concentrating on manipulating the sand.  Soon, however, he felt the golden hammer faltering, and his spiritual body felt a stinging pain. He frowned but didn’t stop his technique, his robe billowing above him, transforming into a cloud.</p><p>The golden hammer and the cloud, hard and soft respectively, formed a formidable defense. Qin Sang continued to attack, but instead of shifting to another sword array, he closed his eyes and seemed to be contemplating something.</p><p>Finally, Ling Du completed his technique, rising to his feet. He grasped the sand, then tossed it into the air.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The sand scattered like a celestial shower, transforming into stars.</p><p>Multicolored spiritual light filled every corner of the void, less bright than the sword stars, but far more numerous.</p><p>As these sand stars mingled with the sword stars, the sword light faltered.  Ling Du's eyes gleamed, noticing a weakness despite the swift stabilization of the sword stars. With a confident smile, he raised a jade ring and struck a point in the void.</p><p>The void trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes but didn't stop Ling Du's advance.  With a point of his finger, he manifested the Southern Vermillion Bird sword array.</p><p>Thanks to his enlightenment from the sword path, the Southern Vermillion Bird array was finally complete, strengthened by a real Vermillion Bird, making it more powerful than the Western Seven Mansions array.</p><p>Ling Du broke through the Western Seven Mansions array, only to find another blocking his way.  He was about to repeat his strategy.</p><p>But this time, Qin Sang didn't continue the Four Symbols array. With a thought, the Western sword stars transformed into meteors, shooting towards the Southern starfield.</p><p>This was another insight he'd gained from his journey—overlapping arrays, perhaps the best approach before mastering the Four Symbols array!</p>
