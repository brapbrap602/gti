<h1>Chapter 1103: The Binding Demon Chain</h1><p>Chapter 1103: The Binding Demon Chain</p><p>“It wasn’t the same one from back then, but a descendant.  Hidden in the magma, unable to leave the ancient cultivator's mansion, it somehow survived undiscovered.  Amazing that after all these years, it’s still stuck at the peak of its second transformation.  These strange insects are truly difficult to evolve…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>At that moment, small waves rippled across the magma’s surface. A crimson shadow shot out like an arrow, lunging towards the jade plate.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in a flash.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede realized its mistake, but it was too late.</p><p>Qin Sang captured it effortlessly, recovering the lost insect!</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede’s size hadn’t changed much since its first transformation, only its body had become completely crimson, with a deeper, richer glow, like a long piece of fiery jade.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede spread its hundred legs, manipulating flames, struggling in Qin Sang’s hand.  But how could it break free from Qin Sang’s restraints?</p><p>“This thing, already in its second transformation, doesn’t seem to have any powerful abilities. Could it only be used for treasure hunting?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. Seeing the centipede’s futile struggles, he smiled faintly, beckoned the jade plate back, and guided the Crimson Fire Gilded Gold towards the centipede's mouth.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede froze, then swallowed the Crimson Fire Gilded Gold without hesitation, showing no gratitude, immediately resuming its struggle.</p><p>“Stubborn creature!  It's not very intelligent.  Not as clever as the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, and far inferior to the Fat Silkworm.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>To plant a soul imprint, he’d have to do it while it was transforming into a pupa.</p><p>However, the gap in cultivation between them was vast. Qin Sang used several secret techniques from the Witch Tribe and the Imperial Spirit Sect to forcibly subdue the Fire Jade Centipede’s resistance.</p><p>After a period of taming, he finally managed to make the Fire Jade Centipede somewhat obedient.</p><p>“I’ll leave the remaining Crimson Fire Gilded Gold for it. Maybe it will help it evolve.”</p><p>Having unexpectedly obtained a third strange insect, Qin Sang was in high spirits, feeling that the trip had been worthwhile.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had lived in the ancient cultivator’s mansion for many years and was very familiar with the place.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Fire Jade Centipede to lead the way.  Using the power of the Tortoise Shell Mystic Water to protect himself, he dived into the magma, successfully finding a passage through the ancient prohibitions, and infiltrated the interior of Heavenly Peak.</p><p>The deeper he went, the more Qin Sang realized the extent of the destruction. If not for the Fire Jade Centipede, he would have most likely returned empty-handed.</p><p>Returning to a familiar place.</p><p>The interior of Heavenly Peak was severely damaged, and the number of firebirds was far fewer than before.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions were still relatively stable and hadn't been completely destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang was not afraid of the firebirds. He released his spiritual sense and searched thoroughly.</p><p>From the mountain pass to the bottom, he found no trace of the spirit talismans.</p><p>“As I thought!”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “The Xuan Yu Daoist was trying to lure me out… The Inner Scene Yuan Talisman was most likely destroyed along with Xuan Yu Daoist’s death.”</p><p>His gaze swept downward, and he saw that the stone platform and stone hall were still there.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang’s eyes suddenly narrowed. He was surprised to find that the stone hall, which Xuan Yu Daoist had been unable to open even after exhausting his strength, now had its restrictive glow extinguished.</p><p>Whether this was due to damage caused by some event, or someone had visited and opened the stone hall, remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang flickered, landing on the stone platform.</p><p>The restriction had been destroyed. Using his true essence to form a giant hand, he easily moved the stone platform.</p><p>The sight inside was unexpectedly simple.</p><p>The space within the stone hall was extremely low, giving an incredibly oppressive feeling. There was no altar, nor any place where treasures might be stored, as he’d imagined.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang thought the place had been completely looted, he unexpectedly discovered a black iron chain in a corner.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Bai suddenly flew out of the corpse puppet bag and picked up the chain.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p><p>This iron chain was remarkably similar to the one they had seen in the Treasure Pavilion of the trial realm, only longer.</p><p>But that wasn't the only surprising thing.</p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p>Bai handed the chain to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his spiritual sense for a brief probe.</p><p>The chain was clearly a treasure forged by ancient cultivators, and the ancient restrictions and fluctuations within it were identical to those of the Xuan Iron Pillar used to refine the Demon Banner!</p><p>However, the restrictions within the Xuan Iron Pillar were far more complex and profound than those of the chain.</p><p>When discovered by the Kuiyin Ancestor, the Xuan Iron Pillar had already been broken in two, while this chain was most likely intact.</p><p>“The Treasure Pavilion was isolated by the light sphere, and you still found it familiar. Can you recall its origin now?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, looking up.</p><p>Bai said calmly, "The iron chain from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion is probably not genuine. It's a later imitation of a true treasure. This chain should be called the Demon-Binding Chain. I only remember that it was specifically crafted to subdue ancient demons..."</p><p>"Demon-Binding Chain! To subdue ancient demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>That black iron pillar was highly valued by the Kuiyin Patriarch because it could suppress the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Could these two be similar treasures?</p><p>"Friend, do you remember if there are any other treasures similar to the Demon-Binding Chain?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked.</p><p>Bai shook his head.  "I can't remember, but there must be. This Demon-Binding Chain has limited power and cannot be used against high-level ancient demons... I remember that this type of treasure requires a corresponding array to unleash its full power, but I can't remember how to set up the array."</p><p>Bai looked down at the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed the unusually complex runes etched on the ground.</p><p>But the array's power had long since been lost.  Based on these remaining traces alone, it was impossible to restore it.</p><p>"Was this place also a cage to seal ancient demons?  We don't see any demons; I wonder if they escaped or perished long ago."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>"The Yitian Peak's Demon-Subduing Stele suppressed a Demon Lord, the Kuiyin Patriarch discovered the black iron pillar in the Ziwei Palace, and here we have the Demon-Binding Chain. Could these all be treasures of a similar type, meant to subdue ancient demons?"</p><p>The high-level ancient demons Bai mentioned certainly had cultivation exceeding that of Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>It was unclear what level of ancient demons the Demon-Binding Chain was used against. Unfortunately, without the spiritual array, they couldn't activate this treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a demon banner and summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The demon fire seemed to shrink back a bit when facing the Demon-Binding Chain, but not as noticeably as with the black iron pillar.</p><p>The imitation Demon-Binding Chain from the Hundred Treasures Pavilion—the Four Saints somehow learned about the Demon-Binding Chain, created an imitation to subdue ancient demons, and discovered it wasn't very effective, so they left it in the trial realm.</p><p>"Let's record these runes first.  Friend, if you have free time, research them; perhaps you can restore the spiritual array.  There are suspected demon shadows appearing in the Abyss of Sin. If we had a complete Demon-Binding Chain, dealing with them would be much easier..."</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip and copied the runes on the ground.</p><p>At the same time, he thought about the black iron pillar.</p><p>Once he refined the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire into a fire lotus, the black iron pillar would no longer be needed.</p><p>If he could repair this treasure and obtain the corresponding array formation method, he would gain a powerful weapon for subduing ancient demons.</p><p>"The Kuiyin Patriarch used half of the black iron pillar to refine the Ten Directions Yama Banner. I only obtained three banners; the other seven are scattered somewhere. I need to find them all before I can even think about repairing it."</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself.</p>
