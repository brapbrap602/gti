<h1></h1><p>The four individuals stared intently, focusing on the crimson light.</p><p>They only felt an intensely hot aura assailing them from within, instantly causing the surrounding seawater to boil.</p><p>The scene before them defied their expectations, and they all withdrew their expressions of joy, looking at each other in dismay.</p><p>They had originally thought that attacking this place would reveal a gate, or the full form of the formation sealing the entrance, but they never imagined such a scene.</p><p>It seemed to be an active subterranean flame vein inside, rather than the Buddhist Sect's remains they had envisioned.</p><p>Just as the four of them were at a loss.</p><p>The crimson light suddenly ceased to overflow, and rapidly contracted toward the center. The scorching aura was also suppressed, and the formation was about to return to its original state in the blink of an eye.</p><p>If the crimson light disappeared, their previous attack would have been in vain.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede could not last much longer.</p><p>In any case, they had to enter the Pure Sea Sect within the time the insect formation could be maintained!</p><p>Seeing this situation.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances.</p><p>"Continue!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu shouted.</p><p>The Serpent Spear emitted a cold and eerie light, resembling a python revived at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang also had the same idea. Having reached this point, he had even offered up the Fire Jade Centipede. Whether the Pure Sea Sect was inside or not, there was no reason to give up.</p><p>Therefore, he decisively urged the Golden Sinking Sword to its limit, transforming it into a streak of golden light.</p><p>Qi and Wang's actions were not slow either. The flag formation revolved, and a more condensed azure water sword emerged.</p><p>The four Core Formation cultivators were now holding nothing back.</p><p>Black, gold, azure.</p><p>The naked eye could only see the strange light emitted by the three attacks, converging at one point in an instant. The four Core Formation cultivators' control was exquisite to the extreme, compressing their attacks to the limit, and erupting violently the moment they touched the crimson light!</p><p>The subsequent scene exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p>The crimson light ceased its contraction. After a brief pause, it surged out in all directions at an even faster speed than before, and the seawater boiled once again.</p><p>Simultaneously rushing out, was an extremely violent crimson flame aura. Suppressed for countless years, it finally broke free from its seal with Qin Sang and the others' help, and was now venting!</p><p>Sensing the power of this aura, Qin Sang and the other three's expressions all changed.</p><p>Not only did they dare not rush forward, but they retreated backwards in unison, avoiding its sharp edge.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The formation was stimulated by the crimson light, and its outline finally appeared!</p><p>Wherever the crimson light passed, faint golden Buddhist light emerged out of thin air. Each Buddhist light was a layer of barrier, as thin as a cicada's wing, layered upon layered.</p><p>When all the Buddhist light appeared, the scene that emerged was very peculiar.</p><p>Each and every barrier formed by the Buddhist light joined together, transforming into an unopened Buddhist lotus, tightly closed!</p><p>The Buddhist lotus bud was the complete appearance of the entire formation.</p><p>The crimson light rampaged inside the Buddhist lotus.</p><p>The Buddhist light was dazzling, contending in brilliance with the crimson light.</p><p>Within their field of vision, they could only see the red and gold light, but only Qin Sang, with the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, could vaguely see something unusual at the center of the crimson light.</p><p>That place was most likely the location of the Pure Sea Sect's entrance.</p><p>However, neither Qin Sang nor Valley Master Mu dared to approach the Buddhist lotus rashly at this time. They obediently retreated to the side, observing the changes from a safe distance.</p><p>"Could it be that this is just a subterranean flame vein?"</p><p>The Qi surnamed cultivator muttered.</p><p>"It shouldn't be that simple," the Wang surnamed female cultivator shook her head, "Why would the Pure Sea Sect be built on a subterranean flame vein about to erupt? And if the subterranean flame vein erupts, why didn't they relocate, and instead expend so much effort to set up a formation to seal it?"</p><p>...</p><p>They nervously watched the changes inside the Buddhist lotus, exchanging thoughts.</p><p>Thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind one after another, and suddenly, he had an ominous premonition. He turned his head and asked, "How many Core Formation cultivators are near the Emptiness Spirit Sea?"</p><p>"There aren't many good places in the Boundless Sea, and the Core Formation cultivation grounds are far apart, each minding their own business. Nearby, apart from us, there is only the current Island Master of Nine Precepts Island, Real Person Holding Precepts. What is Daoist thinking of?"</p><p>The Qi surnamed cultivator looked over in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the Buddhist lotus, "I want to know, if the news leaks, how many people will be attracted here? How fast can they arrive?"</p><p>Before his voice faded.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderous roar suddenly came from within the Buddhist lotus.</p><p>The collision between the crimson light and the Buddhist lotus had reached its most intense point.</p><p>The Buddhist lotus shook, and under the illumination of the Buddhist light, the surrounding area turned into a golden ocean. The aura of the crimson light was not inferior at all, even surpassing it, breaking through layers of Buddhist light barriers.</p><p>Amidst the thunderous sound, the Buddhist lotus burst open!</p><p>In an instant, a crimson-gold ripple charged out in all directions at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>"Not good! Scatter!"</p><p>Feeling the power of the ripple, the four of them instantly changed their expressions.</p><p>The crimson flame aura that had been suppressed for who knew how long, plus the shattering of the Buddhist lotus formation, the two forces mixed together, and if they were struck by it, they would likely meet with a disastrous end.</p><p>'Bang, bang, bang...'</p><p>Four figures successively broke through the surface of the sea and flew into the air, watching the scene in front of them in horror.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A massive pillar of crimson-gold light shot into the sky.</p><p>Whether in scale or momentum, it was far from comparable to the anomalies previously seen by the Qi surnamed cultivator.</p><p>The four of them all raised their heads, unable to see the end of the light pillar.</p><p>The light pillar showed no sign of disappearing, and instead became more and more intense.</p><p>Huge waves surged to the sky.</p><p>The tranquility in the Emptiness Spirit Sea was completely shattered.</p><p>Their expressions changed uncertainly. The thing Qin Sang worried about had happened.</p><p>These two forces showed no signs of weakening. They were completely powerless to suppress them. If this continued, cultivators tens of thousands of miles away would likely be alarmed by the anomalies.</p><p>Once this news spread, it would inevitably sweep through most of the Boundless Sea at the fastest speed, attracting other Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>Fortunately, those people needed time to arrive. Qin Sang and the others should be able to enter the Pure Sea Sect earlier.</p><p>...</p><p>Far away.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo and Real Person Holding Precepts also saw this scene.</p><p>Real Person Holding Precepts was slightly stunned. He also realized that if they couldn't find a way to enter as soon as possible, the opponents they would face next would not only be the four in front of them.</p><p>He couldn't help but rejoice, fortunately, he had the foresight to invite Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo stared intently at the crimson-gold light pillar, with a hint of sinister intent in his eyes.</p><p>"More harm than good!" (Failure outweighs success / They screw everything up!)</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo snorted angrily, heavily tapping his black bamboo staff.</p><p>Real Person Holding Precepts glanced at him in surprise, wondering why he had lost his composure.</p><p>...</p><p>"What do we do now?"</p><p>Qi and Wang both looked at Valley Master Mu.</p><p>They revealed a trace of bitter smiles, "Are we expending so much effort just to make wedding clothes for others (working for someone else)?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu pondered for a while, went underwater to investigate, returned to the surface of the water, and shook his head slightly, "The fluctuations generated by the collision of these two forces are still continuing to strengthen. We can't see the real scene inside. Even if we force our way in, we will face a situation with nine deaths and one life." (extreme danger)</p><p>"Entering now is certain death with no chance of survival!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly interjected, looking deeply at the seabed, "Below the entrance, there must be other dangers, such as a guarding formation! For now, we can only wait for this crimson flame aura to weaken before attempting again. Otherwise, resisting the crimson flame aura while dealing with other crises, even if the four of us join forces, it will be difficult to protect ourselves."</p>
