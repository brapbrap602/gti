<h1>Chapter 1880:巡天</h1><p>South Heavenly Gate!</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  During the Zhitang Battle, Left Real Person had revealed some Daoist secrets to him.</p><p>“The Divine Court! The Divine Court is actually in the Moon Palace!”</p><p>Through the moonlight, past the South Heavenly Gate, Qin Sang vaguely saw a vast expanse.</p><p>The South Heavenly Gate, with its golden pillars and beams, was adorned with coiled dragons and phoenixes, supported by Xuanwu turtles, and surrounded by Qilin.</p><p>Beyond the gate, it seemed like a world of immortals—clear light and clouds, a bright celestial river, a scene of heavenly wonder.</p><p>Long bridges spanned the clouds and seas, some disappearing into the white clouds, others connecting to divine mountains and cloud-capped peaks.</p><p>On the divine mountains, white clouds swirled around blossoming flowers, spiritual gardens, and immortal orchards.</p><p>The mountains were a deep blue, the water a vibrant green, the wind pure and refreshing.</p><p>The pines were deep green, the bamboo jade-colored, the grass emerald.</p><p>A vibrant, hazy mist shrouded strange and beautiful flowers, eternally blooming, forever green.</p><p>Between the cloud-capped peaks stood exquisite pavilions and jade palaces, layered towers and grand halls.</p><p>Golden halls lined up behind golden halls; immortal palaces beyond immortal palaces.</p><p>They rose endlessly, reaching into the heavens, a majestic scene of stars, mountains, and rivers.</p><p>It was truly as if:  A celestial palace emerged from the sea of clouds, and starlight flowed together like a celestial raft.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to see countless immortals riding clouds and dragons, soaring through the air, floating on leaves across water, feasting on celestial winds and dewdrops, and absorbing the purple qi of the East.</p><p>If he hadn't known this was the Daoist Divine Court, at this moment, Qin Sang might have believed he was about to ascend to immortality, to enter the realm of the immortals.</p><p>The scene was breathtakingly grand.</p><p>However, these sights didn't feel real to Qin Sang, like looking at flowers in a mirror or the moon in water.</p><p>A deathly silence pervaded the immortal realm. Although the pines, cypresses, and bamboo on the immortal mountains were lush, they lacked vitality, seeming illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang even began to doubt the existence of this "immortal realm," suspecting it might all be an illusion.</p><p>The bright moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>From the ground, not only could the brilliance of the star chariot be seen, but the moonlight also grew increasingly bright, the lunar halo expanding.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned against the jade seat, his hands gripping the armrest.  He shifted his gaze from the moon to the earth below.</p><p>The dragon chariot soared.</p><p>Mountains, rivers, and lakes bathed in moonlight rapidly shrank in his field of vision.  Qin Sang saw the island where Mo Xingdao was secluded, Jianxin Island, Huchong Island, the north and south banks of Xingdao Xianhu, and the East and West Great Rivers.</p><p>And the outlines of the vast mountains and land beyond…</p><p>At this moment, he was incredibly nervous. The scale of the Taiyi Star Chariot was too great, causing the moon to change and the entire realm to tremble.</p><p>The moment the golden dragon appeared, Qin Sang realized something was wrong, but it was too late to stop it.</p><p>The Taiyi Star Chariot's response to the moon, this anomaly, could not be hidden from the perceptive senses of this realm's powerful beings.</p><p>Qin Sang felt eyes looking at him.</p><p>Regardless, his secret was certainly exposed; the Daoist Court's True Monarch and the great妖族saints would come for him.</p><p>He naturally leaned toward the Daoist Court, but it wasn't his decision to make.</p><p>What seemed like thousands of miles might only be a blink of an eye for powerful beings; no one knew which side would arrive first.</p><p>If both sides arrived simultaneously, and he was caught in a conflict between such powerful beings, the outcome would certainly not be good.</p><p>Knowing his fate was uncertain and escape impossible, Qin Sang steeled his heart, letting the star chariot rush toward the Moon Palace.  If he could reach the Divine Court before the True Monarch and the saints, there might still be a chance.</p><p>In fact, he was powerless to stop the golden dragon.</p><p>Something in the Divine Court seemed to attract the golden dragon, which, like it was eager to return home, forcefully pulled the jade chariot toward the Moon Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to control the Taiyi Star Chariot and communicate with the golden dragon, but was met with only loud dragon roars, unable to make it stop.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Taiyi Star Chariot and the Divine Court?</p><p>What connection did the Seven Killing Hall have with the Daoist sect?</p><p>Qin Sang had countless questions, but he had no time to think about them now.  He withdrew his gaze, nervously watching the moon in the sky.</p><p>In the Zhitang battle, the True Monarch and the great saints had only shown a glimpse of their abilities, capable of striking targets thousands of miles away. With the moon hanging high in the heavens, Qin Sang worried he wouldn't even have a chance to enter the Divine Court.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's anxieties were quickly dispelled.</p><p>Not only was the golden dragon faster than he'd imagined, but as Qin Sang sped toward the Moon Palace, the moon was also approaching him.</p><p>The central moon was like a passage to the Divine Court, possessing an immense pull on the golden dragon, enlarging in his eyes at an unimaginable speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang felt enveloped by the lunar halo, bathed in the cool moonlight, experiencing a sensation of traversing space.</p><p>In such a short time, he couldn't possibly have flown to the moon; he hadn't even felt the impact of the gale-force winds.</p><p>And the South Heavenly Gate was right ahead!</p><p>…</p><p>Zhitang.</p><p>A Daoist priest appeared above the golden hall, looking up at the sky with a solemn expression.</p><p>A glint flashed in the Daoist's eyes.  He raised his right hand, fingers moving in a complex hand seal, but before he could complete it, a golden dragon pulled the jade palanquin into the lunar halo.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The earth, mountains, rivers, seas, and the moon itself trembled.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere in Jushan.</p><p>A caravan sped along the road under the moonlight.  Deep ruts showed the heavy weight of the carts, laden with goods.</p><p>Guards on horseback patrolled the sides of the caravan, keeping watch on the dense forest bordering the road.</p><p>In the lightest carriage at the front, two men whispered.</p><p>"The information is reliable. If we reach Linyin City within three days, the goods will be worth ten times as much…"</p><p>Their conversation was cut short by shouts from outside.  Their faces changed as they felt the ground shake, like ten thousand horses thundering.</p><p>One hurriedly peeked through a crack in the curtain.  All the guards stared at the sky, no sign of bandits.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>The man frowned, scolding them. He too looked up, then froze.</p><p>…</p><p>A secluded mountain peak.</p><p>The door of a stone cave was ajar. A stone table stood before it, laden with fine wine and fruit. Three Daoists sat around it; one sang while the others beat time on jade bowls.</p><p>At the height of their merriment, the singing stopped.</p><p>They abruptly stood, knocking over the table without noticing, and soared into the air, staring at the familiar moon with expressions of shock.  As cultivators, they saw more than ordinary people.</p><p>…</p><p>The Evil Plains.</p><p>Howls rose and fell in chaotic din.  Here too, the moon's transformation was visible.  The beasts of the Evil Plains, agitated by the lunar anomaly, grew restless, and soon skirmishes broke out in many places.  A powerful aura stirred deep within the plains.</p><p>…</p><p>The Evil Sea.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>Though there was no storm, huge waves rose on the sea.  After each wave, mysterious dark shadows swam beneath the surface.</p><p>Chaos spread silently across the sea.  In some places, the water was stained crimson, spreading ominously.  Towering waves threatened to shatter the sea itself, exuding an aura that terrified other creatures.</p><p>…</p><p>The tranquility of Zhitan was shattered.  Figures flew from the Golden Hall.  The celestial officials, startled by the anomaly, gaped at the celestial phenomenon in disbelief.  Similar scenes unfolded in Jingtan, Dutan, various Daoist sects, the palaces and mansions of Guifang, Jushan sects and solitary cultivators' hermitages…</p><p>…</p><p>The Daoist lowered his hand, withdrew his gaze, and looked east, towards the direction of Baishi Zhitan.</p><p>At the same moment, a female cultivator, her feet resting on a bamboo leaf, looked in his direction.</p><p>Their gazes met across the distance, each seeming to see the other's grave expression.</p><p>The anomaly was too sudden, without warning.  No one expected the Divine Court to appear at this time; the Daoist Court was completely unprepared.</p><p>Two hundred years of planning, ruined in an instant!  The one who opened the Divine Court was also unexpected, yet somehow logical.</p><p>The two True Monarchs seemed to have exchanged a silent message, then both turned their gaze to Jushan.  They looked towards Xingdao Xianhu, Swordheart Isle.</p><p>On Swordheart Isle.</p><p>The Swordheart True Person stood above the island, gazing at the moon, his surprise still evident.  His deep gaze, full of divine insight, pierced the lunar halo, seeing the Divine Court and the jade palanquin, and the figure within.</p><p>Then, he sensed a gaze from afar, looked west, and crushed a talisman.</p><p>"Swordheart Daoist friend?"</p><p>A Daoist's voice echoed in his ears, a questioning tone tinged with reproach.</p><p>The Swordheart True Person sighed apologetically.  "This too was unforeseen. It was my oversight."</p><p>The distant Daoist began to speak, then his mind was jolted. He focused his divine vision, looking past Jushan, towards Guifang.</p><p>He saw that Gongan Zhitan, the capital of Guifang, was shrouded in demonic clouds, demonic energy billowing into the sky.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>A drum beat shook the heavens and earth!</p><p>The Daoist's expression changed drastically.  He asked urgently, "Does our previous agreement still stand?"</p><p>The six primal qi of this world are omnipresent.  The Daoist sect is trapped in this world. Daoist cultivators rely on the Divine Court for cultivation, their power tied to the Imperial Seal of Merit.  This seal limits their cultivation and actions, yet they cannot leave this world.</p><p>This world is not a naturally formed Lesser Thousand World. It was created by Daoist ancestors in a time of crisis, using the Divine Court to separate it from the Greater Thousand World, preserving the Daoist lineage.</p><p>Without the Divine Court, they cannot return to the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>If the four regions were united, and the four seals combined, the Daoist Court might still produce a new Celestial Master, reopen the Divine Court, and revitalize the Daoist sect.</p><p>Alas, fate is fickle.  The Jushan Zhitan was destroyed, the armies and spirits rebelled, and the situation deteriorated.  Daoist True Persons and True Monarchs tried various methods to break the deadlock, but the inherent limitations of this world made all their efforts fail.</p><p>Two hundred years passed before a turning point arrived.</p><p>The Jushan Zhizhitai  inexplicably trembled.  Two True Monarchs sensed disturbances emanating from the Divine Court.  Simultaneously, an outsider approached the Daoist Court:  Zhijiejing Zhenren .</p><p>Both sides made a pact, agreeing to help the Daoist Court return.</p><p>However, the Divine Court's reappearance would inevitably shake the Great Thousand Worlds, potentially attracting other Celestial Master-level powerhouses.</p><p>The Daoist Court's Talisman Gods represent the pinnacle of talismanic cultivation.  </p><p>Talisman Gods above the Dongzhen realm, such as the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universal Saving Heavenly Venerable, are considered invaluable treasures by anyone.  </p><p>Even if the Daoist Court's former enemies were gone, these powerhouses would not hesitate to seize a Talisman God.</p><p>The return to the Great Thousand Worlds presented both external and internal threats.</p><p>The internal threat was the Guifang Kingdom. As expected, the Great Saint of the Yaozu  wasted no time in beating the Demon-Summoning Drum.</p><p>The original plan involved the Daoist Court simultaneously preparing for the Divine Court's restoration and using the Divine Dao as bait to lure demons into a trap, proactively offering the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragments.</p><p>If the Guifang Kingdom's Great Saint truly achieved divine unification and entered the Divine Dao, becoming a ghost-god, the Daoist Court, after regaining control of the Divine Court, could easily subdue Guifang Kingdom using the Divine Court's suppression of ghost-gods, resolving the internal threat and focusing on external enemies.</p><p>During the Daoist sect's self-imposed seclusion, the external Divine Dao also evolved significantly, diverging greatly from the Divine Dao cultivated by the Daoist sect through talismanic techniques.</p><p>Zhijiejing Zhenren brought external Divine Dao scriptures into this world. The Daoist Court modified them and secretly sent them to Guifang Kingdom, offering the demons new enlightenment.</p><p>For countless years, the Daoist sect and Guifang Kingdom relentlessly sought solutions, attempting any glimmer of hope.  If the Great Saint gained insight, they would certainly attempt to cultivate the new Divine Dao, thus falling into the trap.</p><p>Meanwhile, to avoid alarming the demons, the True Monarchs were to remain inactive; the task of finding the Divine Court fell to Zhijiejing Zhenren.  A true sword cultivator, devoted solely to the sword, his foundation lay in the sword, not the Divine Court.  Through unwavering sword cultivation, he was able to enter the Jushan Zhizhitai.</p><p>Zhijiejing Zhenren made multiple trips to the Jushan Zhizhitai, gradually gaining clues, and successfully lured Guifang Kingdom into the trap.</p><p>Everything seemed to be proceeding smoothly, then a sudden unexpected event occurred.</p><p>The Divine Court's emergence was triggered by Qin Sang's divine palanquin, and the Daoist Court's preparations were far from complete.</p><p>Without a Celestial Master's decree, even the True Monarchs could not immediately enter the Divine Court, despite finding the South Heavenly Gate.  However, there was one exception:</p><p>The Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragments!</p><p>The Fengdu Ghost Mansion was once connected to the Divine Court, essentially becoming a part of it.  Knowing the Divine Court's location, one could use the fragments to send demon cultivators who had become ghost-gods into the Divine Court.</p><p>Even if the Yaozu Great Saint had not entered the Divine Dao, they could use the fragments to forcibly enter the Divine Court!</p><p>If demons seized the Divine Court, the consequences would be unimaginable, turning the offered Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons fragments into a death warrant.</p><p>These were minor concerns.</p><p>The Daoist looked towards the vast void, his brow furrowed. The Divine Court's unexpected appearance sent tremors throughout the Great Thousand Worlds, impossible to conceal.</p><p>If Zhijiejing Zhenren broke the contract and abandoned the Daoist sect, the sect, powerless against both internal and external threats, would face annihilation!</p><p>Zhijiejing Zhenren laughed, a resounding laugh that echoed through the heavens:  "We sword cultivators take the straight path, never the crooked one. How could I break my word?  I would rather die than betray my oath!"</p><p>Zhijiejing Zhenren stepped forward, walking on air, ascending to the heavens.</p><p>His sword servant stood on the island, filled with worry, when they heard Zhijiejing Zhenren's shout: "Tonight is the time for you to fight and break through!  Go quickly!"</p><p>The sword servant was shocked, bowed respectfully, and raised their spirit sword, flying north towards the Evil Wasteland.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Divine Court.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived riding a dragon, sensing that they had passed through an invisible barrier, effortlessly flying beneath the South Heavenly Gate without hindrance.</p><p>Upon passing through the South Heavenly Gate, Qin Sang suddenly saw a figure blocking their path.</p><p>"Daoist Zhijiejing?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>The figure was indeed Zhijiejing Zhenren, but their form was ethereal, seeming to be a projection of their spiritual essence.</p><p>"I am Tianyue!"</p><p>Zhijiejing Zhenren said gravely.</p><p>At that moment, their aura was drastically different from the Zhijiejing Zhenren Qin Sang knew.</p><p>Tianyue?</p><p>The Tianyue Sage of Beichen Realm?</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically.</p><p>"I am entrusted to help you reach the Void Refining realm in this world."</p><p>Tianyue Sage looked at Qin Sang's divine palanquin, their eyes complex. "I thought it was the power of the Phoenix Feather, but the Daoist Court's Divine Inspection Palanquin… no wonder you could break the barrier and enter this realm!"</p><p></p>
