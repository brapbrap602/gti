<h1>Chapter 171: The Ancient Seal</h1><p>Within the mountain pass, Demonic Qi surged.</p><p>Although the Ancient Demon had been ambushed and its power diminished, combined with the Eastern Alliance Leader, it still forced the Western Alliance Leader into a corner, pushing her back step by step with the sword formation. Her situation was extremely perilous.</p><p>The Demon Lord rushed onto the battlefield to rescue the Western Alliance Leader.</p><p>A strange smile appeared on the Ancient Demon's face. "Learning my formation and disrupting me once is fine, but do you really think I'm helpless? I wanted to keep a demonic servant, but it seems I'll have to cultivate one later."</p><p>Receiving the command, the Eastern Alliance Leader attacked with full force.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword formation collapsed, converging into a single spiritual sword that slashed towards the Western Alliance Leader like a rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader was forced to use her precious flute to defend, its divine light dimming.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Ancient Demon crushed the Eastern Alliance Leader's skull with a backhand, extracting his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The Nascent Soul, bound by demonic shackles, wore a look of agony. Knowing it was about to be devoured, it instinctively resisted the Ancient Demon.</p><p>The Ancient Demon snorted, suppressed the Nascent Soul, stuffed it into its mouth, and chewed voraciously. Its aura surged.</p><p>The chain marks on its body instantly faded even more than before.</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Using the residual power of the sword formation, the Ancient Demon flickered, its body practically pressing against the Western Alliance Leader. It stared emotionlessly into her eyes.</p><p>Their gazes met.</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader's face was filled with terror.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Terrified out of her wits, the Western Alliance Leader desperately tried to defend, but suddenly felt a chill in her chest. Looking down, she saw her body ripped open.</p><p>Her Nascent Soul escaped, but unlike the Northern Alliance Leader, she didn't even have a chance to teleport before being instantly restrained, then grabbed by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Startled, the Demon Lord retreated from the mountain pass without hesitation.</p><p>He glanced around.  Elder Mu had been killed by the Demon Subduing Stele, and the Western Alliance Leader had been devoured by the Ancient Demon. A wave of sorrow washed over him.</p><p>The Demon Lord glared at Ling Zhuzi. If it weren't for this person's interference, if he hadn't been entangled for so long, he could have saved at least one of them.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The old woman and the old man were seated on one side of the mountain pass.</p><p>The old man was taking a medicinal pill, and the old woman was helping him heal.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and Lady Li were on the other side.</p><p>The Demon Lord stood alone at the entrance to the mountain pass.</p><p>The three parties faced each other, with the Ancient Demon surrounded in the middle.</p><p>"Three human grandmasters gathered together, what a grand occasion!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon sneered, chewing on the Nascent Soul with a look of relish.  Facing three Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators, it showed no sign of panic.</p><p>As long as the human cultivators didn't attack, it had no intention of making a move. It was focused on absorbing the power of the three Nascent Souls to break the seals on its body.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you must be Fairy Nangui? I didn't expect that Fairy Nangui, once known as the most beautiful woman in the Boundless Sea, is now nearing the end of her life.  So you're a descendant of the Four Saints Palace, no wonder you suddenly disappeared."</p><p>The Demon Lord sensed the old woman's resentful gaze, but remained unfazed, greeting her with a smile.</p><p>"I also didn't expect the once chivalrous descendant of Demon Island to become so vile and vicious!"</p><p>Fairy Nangui said angrily.</p><p>She had already learned the whole story from her senior brother and harbored deep hatred for the Demon Lord.</p><p>"I calculated that the Four Saints Palace would definitely have top experts, so I had Elder Mu on standby, but I didn't expect there would be two. It seems the Four Saints Palace is recovering its strength. Worthy of being descendants of the Four Saints, your foundation is truly deep.  Victory and defeat are common, Fairy Nangui. If you want revenge for your fellow disciples, I'm happy to oblige. However, with the Ancient Demon and that old geezer watching, this might not be the best time.  Besides, your aura seems a bit strange. Could it be that you've used the infamous Sacrificial Yuan Method of the Four Saints Palace? I doubt it can last long!"</p><p>The Demon Lord sighed, expressing regret.</p><p>"I also know the Sacrificial Yuan Method, do you want to try it? Cough, cough..."</p><p>The old man was consumed with rage.</p><p>Although the Sacrificial Yuan Method could temporarily boost one's cultivation, the price was extremely high.</p><p>At the time, he saw that the Ancient Demon hadn't yet broken the seal and the situation wasn't critical, so he didn't use it. Unexpectedly, so many people with ulterior motives were watching him, vying for the Demon Subduing Stele.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi waved his horsetail whisk. "This humble Daoist has no intention of making enemies with any of you, but we cannot release the Ancient Demon, lest the Boundless Sea be plunged into chaos."</p><p>"Hypocrite!"</p><p>The Demon Lord scoffed. "Who was it that tried to seize the Demon Subduing Stele just now?"</p><p>"If I had known beforehand that you were trying to unseal the Ancient Demon, Demon Lord, I would have stopped you with all my might. Unfortunately, I only discovered you were gathering people and preparing the Five Elements Reversal Killing Formation. I only learned the truth after following you here."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi said solemnly.</p><p>The Demon Lord's eyes narrowed, and he suddenly understood. "Elder Yin's disappearance, was that your doing?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi admitted it frankly. "It took quite a bit of effort."</p><p>"I only mentioned it to Elder Yin once, and hadn't even begun preparations, yet you…"</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted. He knew there must be more to it, but he didn't pursue the matter further. He changed the subject, saying, "So what if the Ancient Demon is released? The three of us, plus the Demon Subduing Stele, can easily slay this demon. Are you truly content to remain at the Nascent Soul late-stage? This demon surely knows many secrets. If we capture it and search its soul, we can definitely find a way forward!"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi's expression flickered, and he glanced at the Ancient Demon.</p><p>The Ancient Demon was devouring the Nascent Soul, breaking the seals, and didn't react angrily to the Demon Lord's words.</p><p>The Ancient Demon was indeed powerful, but as events had shown, it was far weaker than the legends suggested.</p><p>At this time, Fairy Nangui helped her senior brother stabilize his injuries and said coldly, "The Ancient Demon can be killed, but do you think there's only one Ancient Demon here?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord were startled.</p><p>Fairy Nangui snorted and pointed to the stone stele. "Mount Yitian holds a massive ancient seal. Back then, a crack appeared in the seal, releasing the Ancient Demon, which slaughtered countless human cultivators. Four ancestors sacrificed their lives to seal the Ancient Demon here! Those altars scattered throughout the inner and outer halls, their true purpose is to repair the ancient seal. Sealing the Ancient Demon is merely a secondary function. The Demon Subduing Stele is not some supreme treasure, but the core of the ancient seal, used to suppress the Ancient Demon.  Feel free to examine it after we suppress the Ancient Demon. If you dare release the Ancient Demon, you can take the Demon Subduing Stele with you."</p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p>Judging by Fairy Nangui's tone, she didn't seem to be lying.</p><p>"It's said that there were Deity Transformation experts among the Four Saints. Did they truly have to sacrifice their lives to seal this demon?"</p><p>The Demon Lord was stunned, shocked by the Ancient Demon's past power.</p><p>Fairy Nangui's words had revealed a mystery.</p><p>If the Four Saints were willing to intervene, with the Wu Clan's strength, they shouldn't have been able to offer much resistance.</p><p>The two clans had a blood feud, yet in the end, they only drove the Wu Clan to the Wu God Continent and stopped, giving the Wu Clan a chance to recover. It turned out that something had happened at the Seven Kills Hall!</p><p>"If the ancient seal is opened, will more Ancient Demons be released? How many demons are sealed beneath this mountain?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi exclaimed.</p><p>"This demon has swallowed three Nascent Souls. The three of us will have difficulty suppressing it in a short time, and the Demon Subduing Stele requires some time for my senior brother to prepare after each use.  We must act quickly. If you don't want a horde of demons to run rampant, send someone to repair the altars immediately."</p><p>Fairy Nangui handed the Demon Subduing Stele to the old man.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi hesitated.</p><p>Of those present, the only one who could leave to repair the altars was Lady Li.</p><p>If Lady Li left, he would be alone.</p>
