<h1>Chapter 1858: Overturning Heaven and Earth</h1><p>“Senior Zuo?”</p><p>Liu Zhenren, guarding beside Zuo Zhenren, noticed the change in Zuo Zhenren's expression and softly inquired.</p><p>“Phew……”</p><p>Zuo Zhenren exhaled a turbid breath and opened his eyes.</p><p>They were still at the edge of the sea of fire, clusters of green flames flickering like ghostfire, thousands upon thousands of them, floating behind them.</p><p>After the upheaval caused by the Divine Court's emergence, the Healing Platform had been quite peaceful.  The flames within the sea of fire burned steadily, and the surrounding view was unobstructed, making this place safer than others.</p><p>Seeing Zuo Zhenren awaken, Liu Zhenren hurriedly described the scene he had witnessed earlier, while discreetly observing Zuo Zhenren's complexion.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's complexion had become somewhat ruddier, but from his aura, Liu Zhenren couldn't sense any obvious change, unsure of the extent of his injuries.</p><p>“Even if Senior Zuo recovers fully, I'm afraid we won't make it in time…”</p><p>Liu Zhenren glanced towards the Southern Heaven Gate. He was unclear about the purpose of this journey, but the震撼 (zhèn hàn - awe-inspiring sight) he experienced upon seeing the Southern Heaven Gate remained vivid in his memory.</p><p>During this time, experts from both sides must have been converging there, leaving them far behind.</p><p>Suddenly, Liu Zhenren noticed a peculiar change in Zuo Zhenren's expression, seeing him slightly turn his head, his brow furrowed as he gazed towards the southeast.</p><p>Following Zuo Zhenren's gaze, Liu Zhenren extended his senses, but failed to detect any anomaly.</p><p>His spiritual perception was far less acute than Zuo Zhenren's. His heart tightened abruptly, and he quickly scanned his surroundings, his face filled with vigilance.</p><p>“Wait here for a moment and be careful. I'll be back soon,” Zuo Zhenren gazed into the distance, pondered briefly, gave instructions, and rose to leave.</p><p>“Senior… protecting Senior is this junior’s duty.”</p><p>Liu Zhenren hurriedly stopped Zuo Zhenren, his face filled with concern. “I don't know what anomaly lies there, and Senior's injuries…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Zuo Zhenren waved his hand, interrupting him. “It's nothing! I faintly sensed a familiar fluctuation, possibly an old nemesis, seemingly engaged in a struggle with someone. I'll go take a look. If the other party is a fellow Daoist of our Immortal Sect, we must seize the opportunity to rescue them.”</p><p>Saying this, Zuo Zhenren looked towards the depths of the Healing Platform and sighed softly. “Countless illusory realms separate the Southern Heaven Gate and us. I fear that by the time we arrive, the victor will already be decided, rendering our efforts futile. If I can save a fellow Daoist and lessen the losses for our Immortal Sect, I won’t have crippled my cultivation in vain…”</p><p>Hearing these words, Liu Zhenren tactfully fell silent. Since Zuo Zhenren dared to go, he must have been confident and should have suppressed his injuries.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren would be more agile and easily concealed if he acted alone, able to advance and retreat freely. Bringing him along would only increase the risk of exposure.</p><p>“Be careful, Senior.”</p><p>Liu Zhenren bowed as he saw him off.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren nodded, stepped into the void, and vanished with a few flickers.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, a man and a demon were engaged in a frantic chase amidst the illusory realms.</p><p>These illusory realms were not as vast as the Sea of Light, and within a short time, they had already traversed a dozen of them.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax for a moment. The Spirit Nether King was pursuing him too closely. Although he was familiar with the layout here, it was still difficult to set traps under the Spirit Nether King's watchful eyes.</p><p>The demon king's spiritual senses were incredibly sharp. Without meticulous planning, it would be impossible to lure him into a trap.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Lightning flashed across the sky, bringing gusts of wind.</p><p>This illusory realm was a wind domain. The wind was crimson, creating the illusion of being above magma, but in reality, this place was extremely cold, even colder than other illusory realms filled with ice and snow.</p><p>Past scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p>This place offered no exploitable features, but the next illusory realm did, and it was worth a try.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>After flying through the crimson, frigid wind for a while, Qin Sang suddenly felt a wave of warmth. The crimson color ahead vanished, replaced by emerald streams of light. Multicolored radiance, like a dream, unfolded before him, forming a breathtakingly beautiful canvas.</p><p>The streams of light danced ceaselessly. Within them, inconspicuous, slender beams of light, perpendicular to the sky, appeared sparsely, only at the intersections of different streams, lasting for a brief moment before vanishing.</p><p>Qin Sang plunged into the streams of light, and the Blackfish Dharma Form, carrying the Nether Waves, immediately followed. It paused briefly outside the streams of light, its deep eyes gazing intently for a moment before a loud splash echoed as the giant waves crashed open a path!</p><p>During the chase, the streams of light remained undisturbed.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his Heavenly Eye divine ability, stared at the Nether Waves. His eyes flickered, and his escaping light passed between two streams.</p><p>Soon, the Blackfish Dharma Form caught up. Just as the first wave of Nether Waves spread towards him, a beam of light, only as thick as a thumb, suddenly condensed between the two streams.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang heard a thunderous roar behind him, like mountains collapsing and the earth splitting.</p><p>A visible, gigantic ring of light formed explosively, drawing in endless streams of light towards its center.  Faintly, he could see a shadowy figure within, gone in a flash. The Blackfish Dharma Form's whereabouts were unknown, as if it had been swallowed.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could rejoice, a long, dark shadow emerged from the bottom of the ring of light. Its long body swayed with astonishing speed, seemingly unaffected, and in the blink of an eye, it rushed out of the ring, the sound of rushing water echoing below as the Nether Waves reappeared.</p><p>Through the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang saw the mockery in the Spirit Nether King’s eyes, and his heart sank.</p><p>Qin Sang attempted this twice more, managing only to delay the Spirit Nether King momentarily, unable to shake him off, giving Qin Sang a deeper understanding of the demon king's abilities.</p><p>However, the Spirit Nether King, having pursued him this far, could only remain close behind, seemingly not holding back, indicating he genuinely couldn't catch up.</p><p>“If it can remain like this until the Jungle Domain, that would be good…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, his mind less tense than before, contemplating how to utilize the terrain next.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang felt a inexplicable sense of unease. He quickly glanced around, yet everything appeared normal.</p><p>They were currently traversing a desolate Gobi desert, dry winds whipping up swirling yellow sand.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed an increase in humidity in the air, instantly realizing something.  Shock flashed across his eyes.</p><p>The surrounding humidity grew heavier, the ground becoming damp.  Simultaneously, the earth began to tremble, and the sound of water faintly echoed from the left.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a gigantic wave, nearly a thousand zhang high, appeared in the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s vision, sweeping away everything in its path.</p><p>The wave was earth-shattering, its momentum awe-inspiring!</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately guessed the source of the wave.</p><p>He knew the Spirit Nether King was a fish demon transformed into human form and must possess powerful water manipulation divine abilities. While escaping, he deliberately avoided illusory realms related to water.</p><p>Near the Gobi, there was an illusory realm of a bottomless pool. This water must have been drawn from there by the Spirit Nether King.</p><p>Drawing upon the power of the illusory realm and able to cross the boundaries between realms, the demon king, despite having crippled his cultivation, could still unleash such divine abilities!</p><p>Qin Sang was astounded.  His escaping light abruptly changed direction.</p><p>Behind him, the Blackfish Dharma Form had, at some point, stood upright, its head slightly tilted, facing the pool as it inhaled fiercely. Its fish mouth opened wide, revealing rows of sharp teeth.</p><p>Outside the Gobi, the previously calm pool rippled. The water bulged high, as if a dragon from the heavens was sucking it up. A continuous stream of water formed a thick water column, being drawn towards the sky, its destination unknown.</p><p>The boundary between the Gobi and the pool was chaotic. The earth crumbled, forming a storm, yet it couldn't stop the water from surging into the Gobi, like a water dragon, churning up furious waves. Water vapor formed thick rain clouds that swept across the sky.</p><p>The Blackfish Dharma Form suddenly turned its head, fixated on the fleeing Qin Sang, its eyes blazing with intense killing intent. It lunged towards the rain clouds.</p><p>“Splash!”</p><p>Torrential rain suddenly poured down upon the Gobi, thick water vapor filling the entire space.</p><p>The downpour carried a strange rhythm.  Boundless water vapor condensed around Qin Sang, forming a curtain of rain that trapped him.</p><p>Sensing danger, the sword light surrounding him faltered. The Cloud Wanderer Sword shot out.</p><p>At that moment, the water vapor around Qin Sang reached its peak density, as if he were in a vast ocean.</p><p>A blinding light suddenly erupted.  The void transformed into a crystalline scene, twisting and distorting until it materialized into a colossal fish, its body as massive as a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang happened to be within the fish’s mouth. Before he could react, a terrifying suction force erupted beneath him. His escaping light dimmed, and he plummeted instantly.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>Qin Sang felt as though he were on a ship amidst raging waves, his vision filled with a vast ocean, tossed about by wind and rain.</p><p>Just as he was about to be swallowed by the fish, the Cloud Wanderer Sword trembled. Its sword light, like a dragon, expanded a thousand zhang in an instant, slashing at the giant fish.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The power of a single sword stroke could shatter mountains.</p><p>The fish’s mouth was cleaved open by the sword.  The sword light, with unstoppable momentum, split open the fish's head.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the suction force weaken dramatically.  Without hesitation, he flapped his phoenix wings fiercely, surging upwards.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A bolt of lightning shot out of the fish’s mouth, and the suction force continued to diminish.</p><p>However, at that very moment, for some reason, Qin Sang's sense of unease intensified dramatically.  Not daring to be careless, he commanded the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to exert its Heavenly Eye divine ability to its fullest.</p><p>His vision was filled with a watery world.</p><p>As he took in the rain clouds above and the giant fish below, Qin Sang finally pinpointed the source of his unease.  His heart trembled violently.</p><p>The next moment, the lightning bolt abruptly stopped in mid-air, then reversed course, plunging back into the fish’s mouth.</p><p>This action clearly seemed like it was throwing itself into the net.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang felt a dizzying sensation of the world turning upside down. The entire space had flipped.</p><p>The Gobi remained below, the illusory realm unchanged.</p><p>Yet the rain clouds now appeared beneath Qin Sang's feet, while the giant fish hovered above, its body completely intact, overlooking him with its mouth wide open.</p><p>Qin Sang was already within its mouth. Had he not been alerted beforehand, he might have been unknowingly swallowed!</p><p>Qin Sang had not anticipated that the Spirit Nether King could perform such a heaven-and-earth-overturning divine ability.  His reaction was slightly delayed. Not only did the Cloud Wanderer Sword miss its mark, but he also failed to escape in time as the fish's mouth rapidly closed.</p><p>In this critical moment, a golden sun slowly rose behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Golden light illuminated the fish’s mouth, shining through its head, dyeing the surrounding rain clouds a pale gold.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the entire fish radiated golden light.</p><p>It was as if the rain had cleared, giving way to the morning sun, and within the sun, a golden fish swam.</p><p>Golden scales shimmered, the gaps between them widening. The fish's body was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>Even under the impact of the Sun Wheel Seal, the fish's mouth remained tightly closed.  Its body rapidly shrank, violently twisting and contorting.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The Gobi shuddered under the impact, the ground cracking as rainwater instantly filled the fissures.</p><p>At that moment, a crimson spark flickered within the fish’s body, like a fiery red arrow, piercing through from within.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the Sun God Tree with one hand, his face grave, realized the Sun Wheel Seal could not destroy the giant fish. He had no choice but to summon the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Moreover, he was ready to activate the Five Elements Crown at any moment.</p><p>This treasure had been with him for many years.  Nurtured over time, although Qin Sang had not tamed its spirit, he could now unleash the Great Five Elements Extinction Divine Light without awakening the spirit.</p><p>However, after a single strike, the spirit would be stirred.  Continuous use would likely fully awaken it, leading to both internal and external strife. He would need to divert his attention to pacifying it, and thus, he rarely used it.</p><p>Nine Sun God Birds crashed into the fish's body.</p><p>From the outside, a conspicuous red spot appeared on the fish, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Terrifying flames surged from the red spot. Streams of fire radiated astonishing, violent power, finally tearing open a wound on the fish!</p><p>Golden Sun, flowing fire!</p><p>With both divine abilities and treasures unleashed, Qin Sang finally broke free.</p><p>Before the crimson fire could dissipate, a thunderbolt erupted from within it.</p><p>The giant fish desperately channeled water vapor towards the wound, but it was ultimately in vain. Qin Sang wrestled free.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Qin Sang rushed towards the edge of the water vapor without looking back.</p><p>The rain cloud relentlessly pursued, finally showing signs of exhaustion as it began to recede.</p><p>The rain clouds blanketed the Gobi, and the Blackfish Dharma Form reappeared amidst the clouds, gazing at Qin Sang's retreating figure, ripples appearing in its deep eyes.</p><p>Then, it glanced back, and a soft sigh echoed from the clouds.</p><p>The divine ability just performed required five talisman slots to execute. He had relied on his Dharma Form and the water from the pool to unleash it, its power resembling its former glory, but its true might was only six or seven tenths of its prime.</p><p>Although he had lured this person into unleashing a sword strike, he hadn't expected him to still have reserves.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this attack would never have failed so easily. But now, it was different. The forcibly condensed fish body was inherently unstable, and in order to draw the water into the Gobi, he was essentially attacking both the Gobi and Qin Sang simultaneously.</p><p>This was no ordinary Gobi, but an illusion conjured by ancient divine abilities.</p><p>The current Spirit Nether King was essentially rejected by heaven and earth. His full-powered attack could only be maintained for a very short time.  He could only watch helplessly as Qin Sang sped away, powerless to stop him.</p><p>Qin Sang now also discerned some clues, but uncertain whether the Spirit Nether King had other schemes, he dared not relax, wanting to get as far from the pool as possible.</p><p>He would also avoid other water bodies along the way to prevent a repeat of this incident.</p><p>“Splash!”</p><p>The Blackfish Dharma Form lashed its long tail, riding a rain cloud in pursuit.</p><p>Without anyone to maintain it, the rain cloud rumbled and completely collapsed, the torrential rain evaporating before it could even reach the ground.</p><p>The Gobi returned to its dryness, devoid of any moisture.</p><p>The pool rippled one last time, then became still.</p><p>As he rushed out of the Gobi, Qin Sang kept his eyes fixed behind him, noticing the Spirit Nether King in close pursuit, showing no sign of weakness despite having just unleashed a powerful divine ability.</p><p>……</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren was also traversing the illusory realms, occasionally glancing towards the Southern Heaven Gate.</p><p>Gradually, the fluctuations ahead became more pronounced, clearly perceptible even through the illusory realms, like a guiding light.</p><p>At the moment the Spirit Nether King drew water from the pool, Zuo Zhenren paused, his gaze intense. After staring for a moment, a thoughtful expression appeared on his face. He looked back towards the blue Sea of Light, then increased his speed towards the battlefield.</p><p>As they drew closer, Zuo Zhenren intended to slow down and conceal his presence, but he found that he would quickly be left far behind. He had no choice but to retrieve a talisman from his sleeve.</p><p>Rubbing it between two fingers, the talisman spontaneously combusted, transforming into a pair of fiery wings. With each flap, they left a trail of fire that lingered in the air.</p><p>……</p><p>After this battle, Qin Sang's exhaustion intensified, his vital energy and blood depleted. He darted erratically through the illusory realms like a headless fly, his urgency noticed by the Spirit Nether King.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Jungle Domain drew ever closer!</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>On the train back, posting then editing.</p><p>Thank you for your concern.  The departed have passed, the living must move forward, living up to the expectations of our elders.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
