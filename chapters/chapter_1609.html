<h1></h1><p>Shen Chen was quite perceptive. After paying his respects and formally acknowledging Qin Sang as his master, he followed closely behind him, behaving as a proper disciple.</p><p>Returning to the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Jiang Mu dismissed his attendants, and Qin Sang also instructed Shen Chen to wait outside.</p><p>“There’s a matter I’ve been unclear about. Would Fellow Daoist be willing to enlighten me?”</p><p>Jiang Mu personally served fragrant tea.</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip. “Fellow Daoist Jiang is asking about those meteorite fragments. I just don’t know if you’re asking for yourself, or on behalf of someone else?”</p><p>Jiang Mu’s gaze sharpened slightly. “What if it’s on behalf of someone else?”</p><p>“Those meteorite fragments relate to a secret. Unfortunately, the clues have gone cold, and with my limited power, I can’t divide my attention in the near future. However, although this secret is important, I don’t intend to keep it to myself.  I wouldn’t mind cooperating with a powerful faction.”</p><p>Qin Sang was basically making it clear.</p><p>If he could find the Ascension Platform in the future, complex preparations would be needed to activate it. He couldn't be like the Jade Bone Devil Lord or Old Devil Ye, slaughtering Nascent Soul cultivators in the Central Continent to refine Blood Infants. With Bai’s guidance, he could choose other methods, but those required vast resources.</p><p>Finding collaborators was inevitable.</p><p>The Six Continents Hall was a good choice, but Jiang Mu's identity and cultivation level were a bit lacking.</p><p>Jiang Mu fell silent for a moment, then said, “Ten years ago, Hall Master Mu came to Flying Cloud Ferry personally. He intended to pay you a visit, but learned that Fellow Daoist Qin was in secluded cultivation, so he didn't disturb you. I’ll immediately have someone contact the main hall.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>When night fell, Jiang Mu brought a rosy-cheeked, full-faced elder with white hair and a youthful complexion. This was the Hall Master of the Six Continents Hall, Mu Tongshu.</p><p>Mu Tongshu had a benevolent countenance, without the imposing air of a Grand Cultivator. He looked very much like a genial merchant focused on profits.  He didn't deliberately conceal his cultivation in front of Qin Sang, revealing himself to be a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>“I’ve arrived late, making Fellow Daoist Qin wait,” Mu Tongshu said with a smile before he spoke, cupping his hands in greeting.</p><p>Jiang Mu took the initiative to withdraw and closed the door to the quiet chamber.</p><p>“Greetings, Hall Master Mu.”</p><p>Qin Sang rose and returned the courtesy.</p><p>The Hall Master of the Six Continents Hall truly was a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>Confirming it with his own eyes, Qin Sang still felt quite surprised.  This person hadn't appeared at the Treasure Exchange Meet, using other means to project the aura of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s understanding, the large trading companies in the cultivation world all had intricate connections with sects, essentially existing as vassals, or even established by disciples under the direction of their sects.</p><p>The Central Continent was no exception.</p><p>As the peak fighting force of a sect, Grand Cultivators wouldn't personally manage such matters. The managers of trading companies were at most Nascent Soul mid-stage elders whose path to greater cultivation was blocked, contributing their remaining energy in other ways, such as the Pavilion Master of the Seven Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang had investigated before but hadn't found out which power backed the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Now it seemed that with this Hall Master at the helm, the Six Continents Hall didn’t need to rely on any sect.</p><p>“Does Fellow Daoist find it strange that I, Mu, preside over a small trading company, so lacking in ambition?” Mu Tongshu guessed Qin Sang’s thoughts, speaking with a slightly self-deprecating tone.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “The Six Continents Hall is no small trading company. Besides, everyone has their own aspirations.  I'm a solitary cultivator, even less accomplished than Hall Master Mu.”</p><p>“That’s because Fellow Daoist is a seeker of the Dao, unburdened and with only the Immortal Path in your heart!”</p><p>Mu Tongshu’s expression turned wistful, as if recalling something.  “When I was young, the old Hall Master brought me into the Six Continents Hall and took me as his disciple, which led to what I am today. I can't abandon this connection.”</p><p>The two sat facing each other.</p><p>Neither was in a hurry to get to the main topic.</p><p>After some pleasantries.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly inquired about the background of the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Mu Tongshu frankly admitted, “Fellow Daoist can consider the Six Continents Hall a sect, except that our foundation is built upon commerce, and we don't have a grand mountain gate.  Managing a trading company in the Central Plains is no easy task, especially since our Hall doesn't want to be anyone's vassal. Fortunately, the various powers balance each other, allowing our Hall to survive in the cracks, though not without some necessary flattery and enduring insults from many sides. It wasn't until I broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage that our situation improved.”</p><p>The implication was that the Six Continents Hall wasn’t affiliated with any power.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. For the Six Continents Hall to maintain its independence and develop such a large influence, its successive Hall Masters must have invested tremendous effort.</p><p>This was thanks to the intricate yet long-term stable environment of the Central Plains cultivation world.</p><p>All parties needed such a neutral trading company, not overly interfered with by other forces, and therefore tacitly allowed the Six Continents Hall to exist.</p><p>Qin Sang toyed with the jade cup in his hand, then said after a moment of thought, “Hall Master Mu must already know the reason.  Frankly speaking, the reason I went to such lengths is because those meteorite fragments might be related to the secret of Ascension.”</p><p>“Ascension?”</p><p>Mu Tongshu’s pupils contracted, his face showing suspicion. “Is this treasure related to the Eight Sceneries Palace and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery?”</p><p>Although cultivators in the Central Continent didn’t know the true nature of ‘Ascension,’ they all knew a public secret.</p><p>After Nascent Soul cultivators achieved a certain level of cultivation, they would visit these two great Immortal Sects.</p><p>So, when Qin Sang mentioned Ascension, Mu Tongshu immediately associated it with them.</p><p>The main hall of the Six Continents Hall was located in Tianzhong Prefecture, between the two great Immortal Sects, so Mu Tongshu knew a bit more.</p><p>Those Nascent Soul cultivators seemed to have reached some kind of agreement with the two great Immortal Sects. After leaving these sects, they rarely interfered in the cultivation world again.</p><p>The outside world suspected that the two great Immortal Sects used the method of Ascension as a bargaining chip in exchange for the compliance of other Nascent Soul cultivators, maintaining their dominant position.</p><p>“Not so!”</p><p>Qin Sang stated the conclusion he had reached after years of contemplation. “The Immortal and Buddhist sects may know the truth of ‘Ascension,’ but they don't share it with us Nascent Soul cultivators. Let’s assume ‘Ascension’ is real.  The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Immortal and Buddhist sects need to deter all sides and maintain their supremacy, so their continued presence in this realm is understandable.  But throughout history, among other Nascent Soul cultivators, there have been solitary figures like Old Devil Lu, who had no intention of establishing power. Why would they also remain in this realm and stay in secluded cultivation for so long?  Presumably, even for Nascent Soul cultivators, Ascension isn’t easy.  Moreover, if the two great Immortal Sects are secretly manipulating things, how can we guard against them?”</p><p>“Do you know of another method of Ascension?” Mu Tongshu’s face registered shock.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head with a soft sigh.  “To be honest, I'm not certain, otherwise the truth of ‘Ascension’ wouldn't remain in their hands.  But even if there's a sliver of a chance, it’s worth a try.”</p><p>He wasn’t ready to reveal to Mu Tongshu that late Nascent Soul cultivators had a chance to ascend using the Ascension Platform.</p><p>If Mu Tongshu wasn’t trustworthy and sidelined him or leaked the information, the situation could spiral out of control.</p><p>No one knew how many times the Ascension Platform could be used.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that other Ascension Platforms might be like the one in the Purple Subtlety Palace, destroyed after a single use.</p><p>“Ascension…”</p><p>Mu Tongshu seemed lost in thought.</p><p>For Grand Cultivators like them, Ascension was still a distant matter, separated by the difficult hurdle of reaching the Deity Transformation stage.  But just as Qin Sang had said, even a glimmer of hope must be grasped tightly.</p><p>Thinking ten steps ahead.</p><p>Even if he couldn't use it, it could benefit future generations.</p><p>But how could he be sure that Qin Sang’s words were true?</p><p>Mu Tongshu spoke frankly, voicing his doubts.</p><p>Qin Sang spread his hands and said matter-of-factly, “Whether Hall Master Mu believes it or not, I can't offer any proof!  It’s too early to discuss Ascension.  First, we need to investigate the origin of the meteorite fragments, whether there are any similar treasures in the cultivation world, and their origins… Your Hall’s branches are spread throughout the Central Plains, your information network is vast, and this wouldn't require a significant investment.”</p><p>Mu Tongshu pondered for a moment, then suddenly said, “Would our Hall have the honor of inviting Fellow Daoist Qin to be a Guest Elder?”</p><p>“I would be delighted.”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang and Hall Master Mu bid each other farewell.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Shen Chen. “What cultivation method do you practice?”</p><p>“Reporting to Master, it’s a Metal-attribute cultivation method, the ‘Yao Guang Formula.’”</p><p>Shen Chen immediately retrieved a jade slip and presented it to Qin Sang with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly looked it over.</p><p>The ‘Yao Guang Formula’ wasn’t a top-tier cultivation method, but several of its associated divine abilities were actually helpful for refining tools. In a sense, it was very suitable for Shen Chen.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't without better cultivation methods. After considering it, he decided to let Shen Chen continue cultivating the ‘Yao Guang Formula’ and consider changing it after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Changing cultivation methods required a lot of effort and could affect cultivation progress.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t cultivating a similar method, but with his insight, guiding Shen Chen a little posed no problem. After some thought, he left numerous annotations in the jade slip and tossed it back to Shen Chen.</p><p>“From now on, focus on your cultivation and increase your cultivation level as quickly as possible. Don't be distracted by refining for the time being, but remember not to neglect it. Take these pills as needed.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out some jade bottles from his Thousand Jun Ring, along with some refining manuals he had collected, and handed them all to Shen Chen.</p><p>The pills were freshly purchased from the Six Continents Hall.  A portion of the Crocodile Demon’s remains was sufficient, and the Six Continents Hall even gave him a discount.</p><p>The status of Guest Elder had its perks.</p><p>Shen Chen accepted everything.</p><p>Amidst his delight, he finally realized something.  His master hadn't taken him as a disciple for no reason. Judging by his master's tone, his current realm was too low, and he would only be useful after becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Nascent Soul, something Shen Chen had only dared to dream of before, now seemed within reach with this convenient master.</p><p>Shen Chen had been struggling in the cultivation world for many years and didn’t feel any discomfort.</p><p>There was no such thing as unearned kindness.</p><p>The most frightening thing was being useless!</p><p>Besides, this convenient master valued his refining talent, not his life.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't care what Shen Chen was thinking. He raised his hand and pressed his fingers between Shen Chen’s eyebrows.</p><p>Shen Chen felt a trance, and a fragmented formation suddenly appeared in his consciousness.  He could only see the tip of the iceberg for now, but he could sense the extreme complexity of the spirit formation, unlike anything he had ever seen.</p><p>“This is a part of a complete spirit formation. Remember what I said before, you can only comprehend it, don’t rashly try to activate it!” Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Shen Chen quickly withdrew his mind, filled with awe and trepidation.  “This disciple obeys!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Forcefully pushing Shen Chen to the Nascent Soul stage might result in the same outcome as the Strange Face Man’s disciple, lacking experience and abilities that didn't match his realm.</p><p>However, Shen Chen wasn’t like Bai Hanqiu or Mei Gu. He had no prior connection with Qin Sang and they didn’t have a deep relationship.</p><p>Qin Sang’s impromptu decision to take this disciple was mainly due to his refining talent.  Combat ability wasn't important, and it was different from accepting a true inheritor.</p><p>After a few more instructions.</p><p>Qin Sang initially intended to send Shen Chen away, but after a moment of thought, he said, “Stand aside. I’m going to refine something. You can observe from the side.  Don’t rush to comprehend anything, just imprint it in your mind.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Shen Chen huddled in the corner, filled with excitement and anticipation. This was his first time witnessing a Nascent Soul cultivator refining a tool.</p><p>Qin Sang brushed his finger across the Thousand Jun Ring, and a demon core appeared in his palm. It was the Crocodile Demon’s demon core.</p><p>The first Crocodile Demon had been killed by the Sunbird, leaving only a mangled corpse. Its spirit and demon core were destroyed.  The second Crocodile Demon’s demon core, however, was perfectly preserved.</p><p>The Crocodile Demon’s spirit dissipated after Qin Sang searched its soul, leaving only a pure and flawless demon core.</p><p>Shen Chen was mesmerized.</p><p>“A Transformation stage demon core!”</p><p>Shen Chen was deeply shaken, gaining a new understanding of his convenient master's power.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the demon core in his hand.</p><p>After killing the Crocodile Demon and obtaining the crocodile bones, Qin Sang had been thinking about how to use them for his own purposes. The crocodile bones could summon a thousand-foot giant crocodile, possessing extraordinary power.  If he could utilize it, he would have another powerful method.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't a demon and didn't possess the Crocodile Demon’s bloodline, so he couldn't subdue the crocodile bones.</p><p>He didn't have the Crocodile Demon’s bloodline, but he had the Crocodile Demon’s corpse and demon core. This Crocodile Demon had refined the crocodile bones during its life, and the bones had already recognized its aura.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to use this to deceive the crocodile bones. He had spent the past decade cultivating and formulating a plan, and now had a solution.</p><p>With the demon core in hand.</p><p>A mass of black flames suddenly emanated from Qin Sang’s palm. The Demonic Fire’s aura was extremely violent, yet in Qin Sang’s hand, it appeared docile.</p><p>Shen Chen stared wide-eyed at the Demonic Fire in Qin Sang’s hand, swallowing hard, both fearful and envious.</p><p>He felt that the Demonic Fire could easily kill him.</p><p>If only he could be like his master and subdue such terrifying Demonic Fire.</p><p>The Demonic Fire enveloped the demon core.</p><p>The flames appeared remarkably gentle.</p><p>Next, the demon core actually began to soften, its round shape collapsing into an oval, until finally it transformed into a thin sheet.</p><p>Cultivators who obtained demon cores mostly used them for alchemy.</p><p>This was the first time Shen Chen had seen a Transformation stage demon core used for refining, and he completely forgot his previous distractions, focusing intently on Qin Sang’s movements.</p><p>In Shen Chen’s view.</p><p>The Demonic Fire pulsed rhythmically several times. Qin Sang retrieved several rare spirit materials and inscribed runes that Shen Chen couldn’t understand. The demon core then drastically changed shape, finally becoming a transparent glove.</p><p>Each step was so fluid and seamless, it captivated him.</p><p>However, Shen Chen didn't understand the power of this glove.  It didn’t seem like a magical treasure, which puzzled him.</p><p>After the glove was formed, Qin Sang took out a small jade bottle.</p><p>The jade bottle contained a bright red liquid, pure as a red gemstone.  This was the refined blood essence Qin Sang had extracted from the Crocodile Demon’s corpse.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade bottle opened, and the blood essence flew out on its own, hovering above the glove.</p><p>Qin Sang’s fingers moved like a spinning wheel, drawing a thread from the blood essence. Like embroidery, he wove a blood-red hand that slowly descended, merging with the transparent glove.</p><p>Suddenly, a burst of blood-red light erupted.</p><p>Shen Chen focused his gaze and saw a blood-red glove suspended within the crimson light. It was extremely thin, scarlet as blood, and exuded a terrifying, ferocious aura, as if a great demon had been reborn!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blood glove flew to Qin Sang’s left hand, its aura and the crimson light receding as it turned transparent once more, soft as if it were nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the crocodile bones and grasped them with his left hand, removing the Demonic Fire seal.</p><p>The crocodile bones began to struggle again.</p><p>But this time was different.  As Qin Sang activated the blood glove, the crocodile bones gradually quieted down.</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>Although he had consumed a Transformation stage demon core and blood essence to refine merely a tool to control the crocodile bones, it was worth it.</p><p>“From now on, I’ll call you the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand!”</p>
