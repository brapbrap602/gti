<h1>Chapter 596: The Gathering Spirit Hall</h1><p>He had observed the activation of the ancient teleportation array at the Shangyuan Quiet Palace. He remembered they used mid-grade spirit stones then, and this one should be no different.  This one before him seemed smaller but more complex than the one at Shangyuan Quiet Palace; the activation method should be similar.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Eight spirit stones fell into their corresponding slots.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't held out much hope, but he tried activating the runes on the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the last spirit stone was placed, the altar trembled. The runes on the ancient teleportation array rapidly lit up, and the entire ancient hall hummed.</p><p>The ancient teleportation array grew brighter, and a powerful spiritual wave was about to erupt.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed. He immediately stopped activating the array and forcefully removed the eight mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p>He had only meant to try it. He hadn't expected this ancient teleportation array to be intact—that Elder Qingzhu hadn't destroyed the other side after she went through.</p><p>Stepping onto the array platform would have transported him there, but Qin Sang unhesitatingly abandoned the idea.</p><p>The decision was easy. Qin Sang certainly wouldn't leave Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>He hadn't obtained the Three Lights Jade Liquid yet. The Nine Illusory Sky Orchid was still in the Yun Cang Great Swamp.  He hadn't fulfilled his promise to Yun Youzi. These were all crucial to his future success in forming the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Furthermore, after they issued the warning, they helped the two domains repel the Zu Yuan sneak attack, and he received a public promise from those Nascent Soul cultivators about a precious artifact.</p><p>His future was bright.</p><p>To abandon this advantageous position and go to an unfamiliar place would be foolish.</p><p>While a great battle was coming, leaving the Ziwei Palace would allow him to immediately form the Golden Core, escaping his cannon-fodder status and no longer facing the precarious life of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Plus, his sect had two Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>As the saying goes, great wealth comes with great risks.</p><p>The great battle might even be a stroke of luck.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He now suspected the other side wasn't a safe place, and that Elder Qingzhu had either encountered danger or was trapped by something.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's sword cultivation allowed her to easily improve killing talismans; with her talent, the possibility of her forming the Nascent Soul was extremely high.</p><p>The last opening of the Ziwei Palace was only over two hundred years ago.</p><p>Leng Yuntian was still alive, and Granny Jing clearly had a close relationship with Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>With her unfinished revenge and waiting family, her disappearance was abnormal.</p><p>Considering her usual style of action, it simply wasn’t normal.</p><p>Qin Sang's current cultivation was too weak, far inferior to Elder Qingzhu's back then, and time was pressing. Even if there were treasures on the other side, he couldn't go.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang decisively abandoned the idea, put away the spirit stones, and dashed out of the ancient hall.</p><p>By the lake, Yun Youzi waited.  Seeing Qin Sang return safely, he relaxed, rushing to meet him.</p><p>Qin Sang mentioned some things in the ancient hall, but Yun Youzi knew nothing about them, leaving him somewhat disappointed.</p><p>…</p><p>“The vegetation here is far too lush; there must be a reason!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountaintop, pointing to a valley below, and stated firmly.</p><p>This valley was wide, covered in weeds and ancient trees like everywhere else.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, the ancient trees were incredibly tall, the entire forest almost level with the mountains on either side. The oldest ones even surpassed the highest peaks; their enormous crowns resembled small mountains.</p><p>Even the weeds were unusually thick, almost like small trees themselves. The wildflowers were as big as washbasins.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace had been uninhabited for ages, and the vegetation elsewhere was also lush, but rarely with so many tall ancient trees like here.</p><p>Yun Youzi agreed, nodding. “That’s right. The life force here is too exuberant. It’s most likely the Three Lights Jade Liquid’s doing! The Three Lights Jade Liquid gathers the essence of Heaven and Earth, its life force is so intense that it's called a miraculous healing medicine. The Gathering Spirit Hall is here, and even if the Three Lights Jade Liquid is well-sealed, after so many years, the creatures within dozens of miles are bound to be affected.”</p><p>“Yi Tiannie said the Gathering Spirit Hall is hidden within the void.  Many experts noticed the unusual vegetation here before, and they turned the valley upside down, but couldn't find the source.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace had no day or night; the clouds stretched endlessly, blocking out the sun, yet the light in the sky was still blinding.</p><p>Qin Sang squinted, staring at the edge of the cloud sea.</p><p>The clouds there were shifting, creating waves.  Similar to the outer land fragments, there were turbulent currents.</p><p>The turbulent currents in the cloud sea were even more terrifying, as powerful as the gale winds of the ninth heaven; not even Nascent Soul cultivators dared to enter.</p><p>Fortunately, the Gathering Spirit Hall was located in the lowest layer of the turbulent currents, a place their strength could withstand.  However, cracking the remnants of the formation there would be much more difficult; it all depended on Yun Youzi.</p><p>"So it's here. No wonder..."</p><p>Yun Youzi glanced twice, then confidently soared into the sky, signaling Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>"The Gathering Spirit Hall is just a remnant formation. There are bound to be many fissures; breaking it shouldn't be too difficult.  Qin, you need to lead the way with your sword, following my instructions."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, unsealed the Corpse Pill, and transformed into a sword light, flying forward.</p><p>Reaching a high altitude, their view broadened considerably.  The highest peak was the most striking, piercing the clouds. Faintly, they could see strange lights flickering on the mountain, like tiny specks.</p><p>Whether it was due to intruders or simply its nature was unclear.</p><p>Several beams of light shot up into the sky within their range of vision.  Just as Qin Sang arrived, he saw one beam extinguish, understanding that the restriction there had likely been broken.</p><p>"Qin, ten zhang to the right, strike the West Palace position with your sword!"</p><p>Following Yun Youzi's directions, Qin Sang immediately obeyed.</p><p>Judging by Yun Youzi's tone, the remnant formation of the Gathering Spirit Hall seemed to correspond to the constellations, but to Qin Sang, it was pure chaos.</p><p>If relying on Yi Tiannie's memories, they would have to resort to brute force, breaking into the formation and searching for weaknesses – a method fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>But Yun Youzi was confident and provided clear directions.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang shifted ten zhang horizontally and swung his sword towards the heavens.</p><p>In what appeared to be empty space, a star-like fissure opened the moment the ebony sword struck, vanishing instantly.</p><p>The next moment, both man and sword disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace vanished from their sight.</p><p>Surrounding them was an endless darkness, with faint glimmers of light in the distance, all extremely dim. With no reference points in any direction, a sense of dread crept in, urging them towards those lights.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his sword energy, protecting them both as he looked around in bewilderment.</p><p>He knew they were inside the formation and that there were many weaknesses, but finding a way to break the formation instantly was beyond his capabilities.</p><p>Yun Youzi calculated with his fingers, his eyes like a hawk's, fixed on several converging points of light.</p><p>Pointing at the lights, he said gravely, "That should be the Kui position, the formation's eye happens to be circulating there—the key to breaking the formation. Now that it's dilapidated, it's even easier to break. Let's go."</p>
