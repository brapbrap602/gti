<h1>Chapter 413 Ascetic Cultivation</h1><p>Early one morning.</p><p>The Sword Pavilion was still closed.</p><p>Qin Sang was in the cave dwelling in the back courtyard. The defensive restrictions of the cave were deactivated. Qin Sang, with undivided attention, stared at a spirit array before him.</p><p>This spirit array was a family heirloom of Shopkeeper Wu, specifically designed for refining magical artifacts.</p><p>This array could condense spiritual energy into fire. Setting up the array wasn't complicated. The most valuable material required was a peculiar spiritual material called Flamespirit Stone.</p><p>Using Flamespirit Stone as a catalyst, spiritual fire was born. Shopkeeper Wu called this fire "Stonefire."</p><p>This Stonefire had nothing to do with the legendary divine fire, Samadhi True Fire. Their power levels were worlds apart.</p><p>However, this array-generated Stonefire had one advantage: it was very gentle and easy to control, especially suitable for beginners.</p><p>Besides that, it also had some merits. Its power depended on the quantity of Flamespirit Stone. If there were enough Flamespirit Stones, it could even be勉强 used to refine high-grade artifacts.</p><p>With this spirit array, Qin Sang didn't need to rent Earthfire for refining, saving a lot of money.</p><p>However, the price of Flamespirit Stone wasn't low. It was foreseeable that Qin Sang would operate at a loss for a long time.</p><p>The spirit array was deployed. Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the center of the array. Before him, a thumb-sized pale white flame appeared out of thin air. The flame was very calm, without any flicker, appearing static at first glance.</p><p>But the flame's temperature was high, waves of heat washing over him.</p><p>The air distorted.</p><p>Qin Sang enveloped the flame with his divine sense. As Shopkeeper Wu said, the flame was gentle. After familiarizing himself with it, he could easily control it. During refining, he wouldn't have to worry about losing control of the flame and ruining his efforts.</p><p>Such a small flame was obviously insufficient to support refining.</p><p>With a flip of his palm, Qin Sang took out several white Flamespirit Stones, flicking them into the spirit array. Immediately, the flame swelled several times larger.</p><p>The temperature in the cave dwelling suddenly rose.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, controlling the newly enlarged flame. Then, he swept his hand over his storage pouch, and several items flew out, floating beside him.</p><p>There were several white spider silks and some碧 green jade stones, even more dazzling than the most precious gems in the mortal world.</p><p>Cold Spider silk and Azure Jade Stone, these were common spiritual materials in the cultivation world, with mixed spiritual properties, at most suitable for refining low-grade artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to start with low-grade artifacts, solidifying his foundation and gradually improving.</p><p>He chose these two materials to refine a spirit sword imbued with water element power, a decent weapon for low-level cultivators.</p><p>Every step was meticulously planned, including the specific artifact to be refined. This was a plan carefully formulated after a long night's discussion with Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>Thanks to Shopkeeper Wu's generous guidance, Qin Sang had the confidence to proceed.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a palm-sized piece of Azure Jade Stone. With a slight exertion of his fingertips, the stone cracked with a 'snap.' Qin Sang skillfully removed the impurities from the Azure Jade Stone, neither too much nor too little.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang tossed the Azure Jade Stone fragments into the Stonefire.</p><p>The flame flickered, burning away the impurities in the Azure Jade Stone, leaving only the purest essence, containing abundant water element power.</p><p>However, this water element power was very volatile, making it difficult to coalesce and form a sword.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately picked up a spider silk and threw it in. The silk melted, like cold marrow, very viscous. It dripped onto the Azure Jade Stone, gradually calming the volatile energy.</p><p>This process was repeated. The two spiritual materials blended together, eventually fusing into one, then transforming into the shape of a sword.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reached into the flames and pulled out a three-foot long green blade.</p><p>The blade was slender, entirely green, with a striking white stripe in the middle.</p><p>It was normal for the first refining attempt to be successful. With Qin Sang's mid Foundation Establishment cultivation, his control over divine sense and spiritual power far surpassed Shopkeeper Wu's. Failing to refine a low-grade artifact would have been strange.</p><p>After examining the spirit sword for a while, Qin Sang reflected on the process, then casually tossed the sword aside and continued refining.</p><p>One low-grade spirit sword after another was produced. Qin Sang became more and more proficient. He recalled the contents of the jade slip, feeling his understanding deepen.</p><p>He experienced a few accidental failures midway due to experimenting with new techniques, but it was inconsequential.</p><p>A month later, Qin Sang finally emerged from the cave dwelling and entered the shop. He glanced around, pointed his finger, and a shelf appeared out of thin air, filled with spirit swords.</p><p>There were not only low-grade spirit swords, but also a few mid-grade ones.</p><p>The small shop finally had a bit of "Sword Pavilion" ambiance.</p><p>This was the result of Qin Sang's month of hard work. He had practiced diligently, tested all his ideas, and even started attempting to refine mid-grade artifacts to thoroughly understand that part of the jade slip's content.</p><p>The gains were substantial, but some content still required time to comprehend. There was no need to remain in the cave dwelling. He could go to the Boundless Valley during this period.</p><p>He could gain experience, summarize his insights, and collect spiritual materials needed for refining in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>After returning from his excursions, he would study refining and cultivate.</p><p>In the coming years, he would lead an ascetic life, not wasting a single moment. The driving force was the foreseeable rich rewards in the future!</p><p>He pushed open the door.</p><p>The midday sun shone in, warming him.</p><p>Pedestrians on the street, hearing the commotion, looked over in surprise, wondering which shopkeeper was so lazy to open for business so late.</p><p>"I need to find an assistant," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang went to the mortal employment agency and returned with two people.</p><p>One was a slender teenager, thin as a rail, named Ning Youwei, a cultivator, but only at the second level of Qi Refining.</p><p>The other was Ning Youwei's mother, recently recovered from a serious illness, also frail.</p><p>Ning Youwei and his mother were natives of Sunnyward Market. Ning Youwei's mother married a cultivator in her youth, Ning Youwei's father.</p><p>His father had poor talent and low cultivation, but with his cultivator status and ancestral blessings, he owned a cave dwelling in the market and lived a relatively comfortable life.</p><p>Unfortunately, misfortune struck. Ning Youwei's father disappeared without a trace during a trip outside the market. Mother and son depended on each other, and then Ning Youwei's mother fell seriously ill.</p><p>The son was filial, selling all his father's belongings, and finally selling the cave dwelling to a cultivator to obtain spiritual medicine and cure his mother's illness.</p><p>However, this left them destitute, without even a place to live.</p><p>Ning Youwei's talent was even worse than his father's. His cultivation was barely stronger than a mortal's, making it extremely difficult for him to improve his situation. To make a living, he even competed with mortals for work.</p><p>Qin Sang verified Ning Youwei's story and brought them back to the shop.</p><p>Anyone would do, and such a person was trustworthy.</p><p>He didn't expect booming business anyway, just someone to watch the shop.</p>
