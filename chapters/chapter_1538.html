<h1>Chapter 1529: Eight Views Palace </h1><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The group flew out of the small island, intercepting the path ahead. They arrived at a desolate expanse of sea and hovered in mid-air, beginning their preparations.</p><p>The purple-robed elder reached to his waist and retrieved a palm-sized jade talisman.</p><p>The talisman was milky white, its surface smooth and flawless, without any patterns or inscriptions, appearing utterly ordinary.</p><p>Silently, the jade talisman left the purple-robed elder's palm and floated before him.</p><p>Then, the elder's purple robe billowed slightly, a hazy purple light emerging, revealing dense and mysterious thunder patterns. It was as if the robe was woven purely from strands of lightning.</p><p>Thunder rumbled faintly.</p><p>Suddenly, purple lightning surged wildly towards the elder's right arm.</p><p>The elder formed a two-fingered hand seal and rapidly pointed at the jade talisman. The purple lightning condensed into an intensely concentrated point of light at his fingertips. Then, using his hand as a brush and the purple lightning as ink, he swiftly and seamlessly inscribed a design.</p><p>The small rune contained within it a myriad of transformations, clouds and thunder interacting, stars and constellations arrayed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The rune sank into the jade talisman.</p><p>In an instant, the jade talisman blazed with purple light, no longer appearing ordinary. It resembled a piece of thunder jade, born of heaven and earth, absorbing endless purple lightning and containing terrifying power, poised but not yet unleashed.</p><p>Simultaneously, the others dispersed around the elder, each taking their position and retrieving identical golden swords.</p><p>The golden swords were only palm-length, forged from Mystic Gold.</p><p>They were clearly from the same sect, their starting sword incantations identical, employing the same sword art.</p><p>"Sword, arise!"</p><p>As the sword incantation was completed, everyone shouted in unison.</p><p>Sword energy surged, and the golden swords rang out. Suddenly, they reversed their blades, the tips pointing towards the central purple lightning jade talisman. The sword bodies vibrated slightly, carrying a peculiar rhythm.</p><p>At that moment, the purple-robed elder appeared above the jade talisman, sitting cross-legged in mid-air, chanting silently.</p><p>For a time, sword energy and purple lightning echoed each other. Two distinctly different forces combined in an unusually harmonious manner, forming a spirit array that controlled the surrounding area.</p><p>This was one of the renowned grand formations of the Central Plains' Daoist sects—the Sword Jade Thunder Resonance Formation!</p><p>At this moment, the spirit array was concealed and not yet activated.</p><p>The golden swords had vanished into the void at some point, along with the others, hidden by the formation, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.</p><p>In the void, only the purple-robed elder and the purple lightning jade talisman beneath him remained. Purple light flowed, sometimes forming a ball of lightning, sometimes transforming back into the shape of a jade talisman, but its fluctuations were also suppressed to the lowest level.</p><p>However, the elder's attention was not on the purple lightning jade talisman.</p><p>His right arm was gathering purple lightning, while his left hand rested flat on his knee, palm facing upward. A golden pearl had appeared there at some point, engraved with the image of a Buddhist Vajra.</p><p>Having made all the preparations, the purple-robed elder heard a thunderous roar from deep within the storm. The sound was faint, coming from a great distance.</p><p>They knew very little about the ferocious beasts.</p><p>Even with the sect's experts present, possessing two top-tier grand formations, and having prepared an escape route, they dared not relax their vigilance in the slightest.</p><p>This was the first time the purple-robed elder had heard such a strange roar, indicating it was a new type of ferocious beast they had not encountered before, further fueling their caution.</p><p>The roar gradually drew closer; the ferocious beast was being drawn in by the bait.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the purple-robed elder soon felt that something was amiss. The ferocious beast seemed to have changed direction midway, and the roar was becoming increasingly indistinct.</p><p>The others also noticed the anomaly. The long-bearded Daoist emerged from the void, gazing into the distance. A flash of insight struck him, and he said, "Although this bait was painstakingly found, its attraction to the ferocious beast is quite limited. Its effectiveness certainly can't compare to fresh blood, flesh, or a Nascent Soul… There might be a Nascent Soul cultivator nearby! It's taken so long to lure a ferocious beast here. If that person leads it near the barrier and scares it away, wouldn't all our efforts be in vain? The higher the cultivation realm, the stronger the attraction to the ferocious beast. Let's send one person to lure the beast back."</p><p>"A passing fellow Daoist?"</p><p>The purple-robed elder's expression shifted slightly, and he was about to rise.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist flashed forward, blocking the elder's path. "Let me go. Senior Brother is indispensable for controlling the formation's core. Although my cultivation is not as profound as Senior Brother's, I have mastered a few more escape techniques."</p><p>The purple-robed elder pondered briefly. "Very well, be careful, Junior Brother. This is not a matter of utmost secrecy. Just scare that person away; hunting the ferocious beast is the priority."</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist nodded slightly, transforming into a green rainbow and piercing through the air. The golden sword he controlled was taken over by another person, who divided their attention to manage it.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Qin Sang was fleeing towards the Central Plains with all his might.</p><p>The ferocious beast sensed something it intensely disliked ahead, instinctively making it unwilling to approach. However, due to hunger, it was reluctant to give up on the blood and flesh in front of it.</p><p>Ferocious beasts were driven by madness, not by consideration of gain or loss, but solely by instinct.</p><p>The closer it got to the Central Plains, the more agitated and restless the ferocious beast became, wavering back and forth.</p><p>From its roar, Qin Sang could discern the nuances, further confirming his previous deduction.</p><p>The barrier of the cultivation world had the effect of repelling ferocious beasts!</p><p>No wonder he had never heard of ferocious beasts attacking the Northern Sea. If there were no barrier for protection, even if humans could adapt to the storm belt, they would likely have long since been buried in the bellies of ferocious beasts.</p><p>He didn't need to take risks to escape.</p><p>Even with the Crescent Moon Rhinoceros Horn in hand, being swept into the hurricane was extremely dangerous.</p><p>It seemed that approaching the barrier would be enough to frighten the ferocious beast away.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly relieved, but he would not truly relax, constantly monitoring the ferocious beast's movements.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, as he got closer to the Central Plains, not only did the ferocious beast's roar become filled with agitation, but its behavior also began to become erratic. Its speed fluctuated, and two instincts within its body were in conflict.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the ferocious beast and charged forward with all his might.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A sudden, earth-shattering thunderclap erupted from behind.</p><p>The ferocious beast let out an unprecedentedly shrill screech.</p><p>The roar overwhelmed the storm, as if a bolt of heavenly lightning had struck down directly above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>Following that, Qin Sang sensed a powerful energy appearing behind him, emerging from nothingness and brewing at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In an instant, even the extremely chaotic Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth was stirred.</p><p>At this moment, the ferocious beast was still some distance away from him, but Qin Sang's senses were extremely clear. The ferocious beast had indeed stirred the Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth!</p><p>This was a divine ability possessed only by Soul Formation cultivators.</p><p>When a cultivator breaks through to the Soul Formation stage, they can initially mobilize the Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>This is a true metamorphosis, a step closer to the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>With a single thought, they can summon wind and rain, comparable to a deity.</p><p>The legends of terrestrial immortals and the like refer to Soul Formation cultivators. Nascent Soul cultivators, despite their considerable abilities, are still far inferior.</p><p>"A Soul Formation ferocious beast!"</p><p>Although Qin Sang had guessed as much, he was still shocked when faced with this change in the Heavenly Mystery.</p><p>It turned out that mobilizing the Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth was not just a symbol of Soul Formation cultivators.</p><p>When the ferocious beast attacked, it triggered a strange phenomenon in the Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth, seemingly invoking a trace of Heavenly Might.</p><p>Despite the distance, Qin Sang still felt a sense of impending doom, as if he had no place in this world.</p><p>This feeling was not very obvious, far from being rejected and suppressed by the heavens and earth, but that inexplicable pressure was absolutely real.</p><p>Soul Formation cultivators had not yet truly mastered this ability; they could only mobilize the Elemental Qi of Heaven and Earth, not control it, utilizing only a fraction of its power.</p><p>Of course, compared to Nascent Soul cultivators, the difference was like heaven and earth.</p><p>Even a late-stage Nascent Soul Grandmaster, wielding top-tier divine abilities and Dharma treasures, would naturally feel inferior in the face of a Soul Formation cultivator if they lacked the means to resist the pressure. They would have the illusion of struggling against the heavens and earth, feeling defeated before even fighting.</p><p>This was the gap in realms!</p><p>This ferocious beast could be considered the most powerful enemy Qin Sang had ever encountered in his life!</p><p>The original realm of the Seven Kill Palace's Demon Lord was certainly higher than that of the ferocious beast, but Qin Sang was not qualified to face the Demon Lord directly.</p><p>Although the Demon Lord's divided soul was powerful, suppressing all the cultivators, it was only through Qing Zhu sacrificing his life that they managed to win. However, when the Demon Lord attacked, Qin Sang did not feel the same way he did now, indicating that the Demon Lord had not exceeded the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had overestimated the ferocious beast as much as possible, but now it seemed he was still too optimistic.</p><p>If the cultivation world's barrier hadn't made the ferocious beast hesitant, he might have had no choice at this moment but to jump into the dangerous place that could help him escape, no matter how perilous it was.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A dense blood energy surged from deep within the storm.</p><p>The threat Qin Sang felt originated from this.</p><p>The surrounding world was dyed blood-red by the blood energy, and the area below became a sea of blood. Blood waves rose, and the ferocious beast, covered in crimson, floated and sank in the sea of blood.</p><p>It was impossible to see the ferocious beast's full appearance.</p><p>The exposed parts of the ferocious beast's body had four blood holes, which were actually four giant eyes, arranged in a completely irregular pattern. Without exception, they were all fixed on the direction Qin Sang was fleeing, their madness mixed with greed.</p><p>Its skin was very smooth, without scales. Thick, sticky blood seemed to constantly seep out of its skin, emitting an extremely foul and eerie stench.</p><p>The conflict between its two instincts had driven the ferocious beast to desperation.</p><p>Amidst its roars, the ferocious beast's speed increased dramatically, carving a deep, bottomless trench in the sea. Then, its four giant eyes simultaneously shot out beams of blood-red light, forming a pillar of light in front of it, which shot out explosively!</p><p>In an instant, a blood-red corridor appeared in the storm belt, piercing through the void and connecting the ferocious beast and Qin Sang. However, the blood light became much thinner towards the end.</p><p>The threat was approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed it and abruptly turned his head, his vision filled with crimson.</p><p>A foul, nauseating stench assaulted him.</p><p>Even after crossing such a great distance, the blood light's momentum was still astonishing.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it hastily, pushing his escape technique to the extreme.</p><p>But the blood light seemed to have a will of its own, pursuing him like a bone-clinging maggot, and its speed was even faster than his.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The blood light surged like a tide, roaring like thunder. Although the lightning bolt that Qin Sang had transformed into was fast, after crossing several storms, it still could not avoid being swallowed by the blood light.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>His external incarnation appeared in time, unleashing a long-prepared secret technique.</p><p>Frigid energy shot at the void behind Qin Sang, condensing into a ball and instantly transforming into a thick ice mirror.</p><p>With a 'bang,' the blood light and frigid light intertwined, and a bursting sound was heard. Qin Sang and his incarnation's bodies trembled simultaneously, but then their faces revealed expressions of joy.</p><p>The power of the blood light was not as terrifying as it looked, likely weakened by the storm, and had reached the end of its strength.</p><p>Of course, a single strike from a Soul Formation ferocious beast, even the residual power, was not to be taken lightly. The ice mirror eventually shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang had already activated the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl, its protective罡罩  shielding him.</p><p>Only a huge boom was heard, and the罡罩's golden light burst forth, colliding with the blood light, creating a sun of blood-red and gold. Qin Sang's body, like an arrow loosed from a bow, was smashed towards the sea surface by a tremendous force.</p><p>It looked disastrous, but in reality, Qin Sang was unharmed. He hadn't even needed to use the Demon Fire or the Divine Sun Tree. The blood light seemed to be all bark and no bite.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could rejoice, another change occurred.</p><p>The blood light, which was showing signs of dissipating, suddenly formed a vortex, with Qin Sang at its center.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression froze. The ferocious beast still had a backup plan, knowing how to deceive and conceal its true killing move.</p><p>Little did he know that although the ferocious beast was driven by madness, its instincts would guide it to make the correct choices. Perhaps it had accidentally used this sneak attack before and successfully killed its enemy, imprinting it in its instincts.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The blood-red vortex formed rapidly, and space seemed to distort slightly, threatening to grind Qin Sang inside into mincemeat.</p><p>The change came suddenly, and trapped in the vortex, Qin Sang dared not use the Divine Sun Tree to blast an opening, or he would be affected as well.</p><p>He remained calm in the face of danger.</p><p>Because his previous judgment was correct, the Heavenly Mystery of the storm was chaotic. The ferocious beast attacking from such a distance was not yet enough to make him sit and wait for death.</p><p>The Fire Lotus flew out from between Qin Sang's eyebrows, rotating, and merged with the Demon Fire in the Demon Banner. After years of refinement, the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus' had greatly advanced, and Qin Sang could control more Demon Fire through the Fire Lotus.</p><p>At the same time, the incarnation also took over the main body's Golden Sink Sword, unleashing a hundred-zhang sword energy.</p><p>The Fire Dragon formed by the Demon Fire plunged headfirst into the vortex. Its body, composed of flames, immediately twisted, as if it would be torn apart by the blood-red vortex.</p><p>Fortunately, the Demon Fire was inherently formless, and even if torn apart, it could reassemble without issue. It charged into the vortex without any hesitation.</p><p>The incarnation deliberately delayed its attack by half a beat, the sword energy following closely behind the Demon Fire, slashing into the gap torn open by the flames.</p><p>With the main body and the incarnation working together, Qin Sang exerted all his strength, unleashing divine abilities one after another, desperately resisting the suction force of the vortex and charging outwards.</p><p>The ferocious beast sensed that its prey was about to escape its control and roared repeatedly.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist was following the roars, rushing towards this area.</p><p>"Huh? That person was caught up to by the ferocious beast?"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist heard the unusual roar of the ferocious beast, his expression shifting slightly. He increased his speed again, but his aura was still suppressed to the lowest level.</p><p>Rapidly approaching the battlefield.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist finally saw the blood light that traversed the storm. Although he could not yet clearly see the two sides, he could sense the power of the blood light. He clicked his tongue and said, "Indeed, it's another Soul Formation ferocious beast. This fellow Daoist's cultivation hasn't reached the late stage yet. I'm afraid his chances are slim…"</p><p>Stopping at a distance, the long-bearded Daoist waited leisurely for a while, then heard the ferocious beast's frustrated roar. He let out a light exclamation and chuckled, "It seems he escaped. He has some skills! But we can't let the ferocious beast continue to approach the cultivation world, lest it be frightened away. Otherwise, I would definitely let you spar with it a bit longer to test its divine abilities."</p><p>Gently stroking his long beard, the long-bearded Daoist raised his hand, drawing a talisman in mid-air. Then, he pointed, and the spirit talisman transformed into a sword, shooting towards the end of the blood light.</p><p>Simultaneously, the long-bearded Daoist deliberately approached the ferocious beast, releasing his aura.</p><p>The ferocious beast's roar was filled with delight.</p><p>It sensed new prey, more enticing than the previous one, and further away from the aura it disliked and feared.</p><p>Without hesitation, the ferocious beast immediately abandoned Qin Sang and turned to pounce on the long-bearded Daoist.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist also dared not get too close to the ferocious beast, turning and fleeing.</p><p>Qin Sang, along with his incarnation, rushed out of the vortex and was about to continue fleeing when he discovered that the ferocious beast had turned and left. He was secretly puzzled, not expecting the ferocious beast to give up so easily.</p><p>Just then.</p><p>Suddenly, a green light flew over.</p><p>"A Sword Talisman! Someone's nearby!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted, and he was secretly alarmed. He immediately recalled the Demon Fire.</p><p>The Sword Talisman hovered in mid-air, shimmering with green light.</p><p>From it, an unquestionable voice emanated.</p><p>"This is the Eight Views Palace's training ground. Unrelated individuals, leave immediately, lest you say you were not warned!"</p>
