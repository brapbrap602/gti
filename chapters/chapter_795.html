<h1>Chapter 787: The Trial</h1><p>Chapter 787: The Trial</p><p>The appearance of this sword light is certainly related to the cultivation technique itself; it concerns a secret, and must have a deeper meaning.</p><p>Soul cultivation of the sword.</p><p>Sword soul fusion.</p><p>Unfortunately, they only obtained a fragmented scroll, lacking the subsequent parts.</p><p>Qingzhu called this sword light a "sword soul," because it truly merged with his own soul.</p><p>Strangely, he didn't feel any abnormality at all, and the power of this sword light was not stronger than others; outsiders couldn't feel any difference.</p><p>Qingzhu felt that if he could comprehend the sword soul, he might be able to glimpse the greatest secret of this cultivation technique, but unfortunately, he failed.</p><p>After obtaining the "Cultivating the Yuan Devil Embryo," Qingzhu had a feeling, and he pondered this demonic cultivation technique.  Through the sword soul, he created a similar secret technique, attempting to use the sword soul to cultivate a devil seed.</p><p>In the end, he actually succeeded.</p><p>Moreover, because of the sword soul, the devil seed was very stable, not requiring harming others.  He only needed to find a newly deceased low-level cultivator's corpse to cultivate the Yuan Embryo and refine an external avatar.</p><p>However, the hidden dangers of the external avatar still existed.</p><p>Qin Sang had long heard of the demonic sect's external avatar secret techniques, all of which were exceptionally evil and dangerous.  He didn't expect that Senior Qingzhu could create an alternative path based on the demonic cultivation technique.</p><p>The Blackwood Sword trembled, splitting off a beam of sword light.</p><p>The sword soul left him puzzled. He summoned the sword light before him, gazing at it for a long time, but couldn't accurately perceive the difference Senior Qingzhu mentioned.</p><p>He also couldn't figure out what use the sword soul had. Since forming the Golden Core, he had only used it as an unexpected method.</p><p>This is all the content in the jade slip.</p><p>The location of the teleportation array, which Qin Sang most wanted, and the Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) portion of the cultivation technique, were both missing.</p><p>"Senior Qingzhu successfully teleported here back then, using the alias of the Spirit Turtle Island Master outside, and once entered and exited the Seven Killing Hall... With his cultivation, the things he found must be more than mine…"</p><p>Qin Sang regained his composure, feeling that after he went out, he needed to investigate what Spirit Turtle Island was.</p><p>Perhaps, Senior Qingzhu is still alive.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip. He wasn't in the mood to study "Cultivating the Yuan Devil Embryo" now. He paid his respects to the place where the jade slip was stored, then stood up and looked towards the depths of the corridor.</p><p>Hope rekindled in his heart. Senior Qingzhu guiding his successors here might have other implications. Could something be hidden at the end of the corridor?</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, finding nothing unusual inside.  Thinking of the various puppets he encountered below, out of caution, he still summoned the Ten Directions Yama Banner and summoned his two-headed… (creature).</p><p>This was the seventh level. If there were puppets, their strength would be extraordinary; he didn't have much confidence.</p><p>After making preparations, Qin Sang summoned a corpse puppet and stepped into the corridor.</p><p>After walking ten feet, a change occurred.</p><p>The corridor suddenly lit up with a blinding light.  A large mass of green light had condensed on the ceiling at some point, and without a word, it smashed down towards him.</p><p>The formless green light, however, was incredibly powerful, like a mountain pressing down. The corpse puppet in front was instantly vaporized, and Qin Sang's face immediately changed drastically.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, the green light seemed to sense something and suddenly disappeared silently, leaving only a few strands that shot towards Qin Sang with a "whoosh."</p><p>The light cluster appeared, then suddenly vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, but seeing those few strands of green light heading straight for him, he didn't dare let them touch him. He turned to escape and study them later.</p><p>Then he was startled.</p><p>This surprise was extraordinary. Qin Sang was horrified to find that his escape route was cut off!</p><p>Behind him was empty, yet an inexplicable barrier appeared.  No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't move it an inch.</p><p>The next moment, the green light struck.</p><p>The green light didn't harm Qin Sang, but went straight for the magic treasures on his body, floating over.  The Golden Yao Lock and the Ten Directions Yama Banner were not spared.</p><p>Then Qin Sang discovered that his connection with the Ten Directions Yama Banner was severed.</p><p>Looking down, he saw that after the magic banner was touched by the green light, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was directly repelled, and the Golden Yao Lock also "clanged," falling to the ground and bouncing a few times.</p><p>The two-headed… (creature) suddenly disappeared, and the Primal Unity Ring also fell to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang, still shaken, stared blankly at all this, realizing that the green light hadn't harmed him.  He breathed a sigh of relief and quickly picked up his magic treasures to examine them.</p><p>He checked himself and found that the magic treasures weren't destroyed, but were sealed by some kind of strange restriction. The two-headed… (creature) was sound asleep in the Unity Ring, and even the fat silkworm and the Sky Eye Butterfly inexplicably fell asleep.</p><p>"Eh? What about the Blackwood Sword…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he summoned the Blackwood Sword.</p><p>The sword light flashed, the Blackwood Sword moving nimbly, without any abnormality.</p><p>The ebony sword, his soul-bound weapon, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, his soul-bound insect Gu, should ideally be equally close to him. Yet, only the butterfly is restricted…</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, sheathing the ebony sword and surveying her surroundings.</p><p>The green light had dissipated, the passageway unchanged.  But Qin Sang knew things were different now.</p><p>The barrier behind her remained, a gentle pressure pushing back against her if she approached it, preventing retreat.</p><p>Just then, a nearby brick glowed, and two shadowy figures lunged forth.</p><p>“Here they come!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed.  Unexpectedly, they weren’t puppets, but two sword-wielding ‘people’!</p><p>These two were identical, their expressions wooden, swords clutched in their arms, seeming equally devoted to the sword, like sword cultivators.  Their appearance and posture were human-like, unlike the strange puppets on the lower levels.</p><p>The two sword cultivator figures appeared, bowed to Qin Sang with their swords, then, without a word, attacked.</p><p>“Trial!  The Sword Path!”</p><p>Two words sprang to Qin Sang’s mind; she guessed the purpose of this trial.</p><p>All external forces are sealed from those entering the passageway.  Only the sword in one's hand remains. One person, one sword, against all the swordsmen emerging from the walls.</p><p>Forward, no retreat, unwavering!</p><p>This was a genuine Sword Path, attuned to the Way of the Sword, clearly designed for cultivators of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*. Recalling the power of the light orb, other cultivators would likely have been pulverized.</p><p>This confirmed the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter* originated from the Seven Kills Hall!</p><p>Cultivators rely on external forces. With magical treasures sealed, their power is significantly reduced.</p><p>Qin Sang was self-aware. Though she cultivated the Killing Path sword techniques, she primarily used them to enhance her cultivation. Compared to those lifelong devotees of the sword, she wasn’t a true sword cultivator.</p><p>Her swordsmanship wasn't on par with true sword geniuses, she hadn't mastered sword light differentiation.</p><p>She surpassed cultivators of the same realm because of her magical treasures.</p><p>Now, armed only with the ebony sword, how far could she go? How strong were the swordsmen at the passage's end?</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to ponder; the two figures were upon her.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>They vanished, leaving only blinding sword light in her vision.</p><p>Two sword beams intersected, incredibly sharp.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, stung by the light, and reached out.</p><p>In an instant, the ebony sword transformed into a three-foot long blue blade, settling in Qin Sang’s hand.</p>
