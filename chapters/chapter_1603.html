<h1></h1><p>With the Soul Calming Incense in hand,</p><p>Qin Sang felt confident.</p><p>“The item I seek remains unchanged, still a treasure that can enhance divine sense.  There's no need for me to elaborate on its value, as I'm sure you all have your own judgments…”</p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at the Nine Refinements Spirit Returning Pill, the implication clear.</p><p>While he was willing to trade Puppet Crystals for the Nine Refinements Spirit Returning Pill, now that he possessed the Soul Calming Incense, a single pill wouldn't satisfy his appetite.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's condition, a brief silence fell over the area surrounding the pool.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied. Some stared fixedly at the Soul Calming Incense, while others carefully scrutinized Qin Sang.</p><p>Such a treasure, regardless of whether one practiced Daoism, Buddhism, Ghostly Arts, Demonic Cultivation, whether human or demon, regardless of their cultivation method, no one would be unmoved, and the more, the better.</p><p>Yet, heart demons are formless and intangible, impossible to fathom. Treasures that can suppress heart demons are rare in the cultivation world, their value immeasurable.</p><p>If one were to obtain such a treasure, who wouldn't cherish it as their lifeblood?</p><p>No one expected to encounter the legendary Soul Calming Incense at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>“We've only heard of the Soul Calming Incense in legends, never seen it with our own eyes. How can we be sure this incense is genuine?” someone asked cautiously.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the jade box, blocking everyone's view. “Whichever fellow Daoist presents a treasure of comparable value can light this incense.  The Soul Calming Incense suppresses heart demons fundamentally by stabilizing the mind. Even if one doesn't currently suffer from heart demons, they can still experience its unique effects.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, will you only accept treasures of this kind? I have an item…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could finish, a man in black abruptly stood up, flashing to the edge of the pool, his voice filled with urgency.</p><p>Before this person could state his offer, the Daoist elder in the Daoist robe forcefully interrupted, “This old man hasn't said no yet. There’s no need to be so hasty, everyone. Jiang You!”</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang presented the Soul Calming Incense, Jiang You's eyes had been glued to the jade box, unable to look away.</p><p>Hearing the Daoist elder's shout,</p><p>Jiang You snapped back to reality, a wry smile appearing on his lips.</p><p>Faced with the Soul Calming Incense, it would be a lie to say he wasn't tempted, but he had to suppress his greed.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall was the organizer of the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>As the Vice Hall Master, if he acted out of line, it would be a devastating blow to the reputation of the entire Six Provinces Hall, rendering them unable to stand in the cultivation world. It would be a grave mistake for a small gain.</p><p>As precious as the Soul Calming Incense was, it wasn't worth such a reckless act.</p><p>Flashing forward to block the man in black, Jiang You said sternly, “Fellow Daoist, please return to your seat. Do not be impatient!”</p><p>Locked onto by an aura from the shadows, the man in black felt a chill in his heart. After a moment of silence, he returned to his seat, somewhat dejected.</p><p>However, those present were all overlords, unruly and untamed, not easily subdued by a few words from Jiang You. Discordant voices immediately arose, “While the host has priority, the highest bidder should win. As long as the treasure meets the requirements, anyone can bid! This lord won't waste words. Three Azurefall Ginseng Fruits in exchange for this Soul Calming Incense. Can the host offer a higher price?”</p><p>Qin Sang followed the voice.</p><p>The speaker wore azure armor, his entire body concealed within, completely blocking any view.</p><p>He had a companion sitting to his left, similarly clad in armor of a similar design, but in grayish-white.</p><p>At the beginning of the Treasure Exchange, the gray-armored man had questioned Jiang You, demanding the host reveal themselves, his tone quite impolite, which had caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>In the current era where Dharma Cultivators reigned supreme, even Nascent Soul cultivators rarely wore armor-type magical treasures all the time like they did.</p><p>Perhaps it was a deliberate act to conceal their identities at the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, a commotion erupted among the attendees. Many were stunned by the azure-armored man's offer.</p><p>The Azurefall Ginseng Fruit was a precious spiritual fruit that could be directly refined to strengthen divine sense. Its rarity was comparable to the Soul Calming Incense.</p><p>This person offered three at once, showing his determination to obtain the Soul Calming Incense!</p><p>Having heard of the Azurefall Ginseng Fruit, Qin Sang was overjoyed. "Fellow Daoist, would you mind showing me the ginseng fruits?"</p><p>The azure-armored man said indifferently, “To be honest with you, fellow Daoist, I haven’t brought the Azurefall Ginseng Fruits with me… I have an Azurefall Ginseng Fruit spiritual root in my residence, which has borne a few fruits that will ripen within ten years. Fellow Daoist only needs to accompany me to the East Sea, and you’ll see for yourself. If you have any concerns, I can first offer a few other treasures as collateral…”</p><p>The azure-armored man couldn't produce the Azurefall Ginseng Fruits.</p><p>The crowd was initially inclined to mock him, but his subsequent words were even more shocking.</p><p>An Azurefall Ginseng Fruit tree was enough to support an entire sect!</p><p>“Which Immortal Island Lord of the East Sea is this?”</p><p>“The Heart邈 Sect or Nine Heavens Island? Doesn't seem like it!”</p><p>“Judging by the style of the armor, it feels like it's from the Water Mirror Seven Islands.”</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, everyone wildly speculated about the azure-armored man's identity.</p><p>Three Azurefall Ginseng Fruits were a great temptation.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was all talk.</p><p>Who could guarantee there wouldn't be a trap waiting if they followed this person to the East Sea to retrieve the treasure?</p><p>It was more practical to hold the treasure in one's own hands.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to respond, instead turning to the Daoist elder.</p><p>The Daoist elder had been deep in thought since the azure-armored man spoke.</p><p>He seemed to have made a decision and first asked the Daoist nun beside him, “Fellow Daoist, would you be willing to exchange this bottle of Myriad Year Azure Cloud Dew for other treasures? This old man has a few more items for you to choose from.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Daoist nun was firm, “I only want the Nine Refinements Spirit Returning Pill!”</p><p>As everyone watched in surprise, the Daoist elder picked up the spiritual pill and handed it to the Daoist nun.  “The Myriad Year Azure Cloud Dew is a must-have for this old man. Please take it, fellow Daoist!”</p><p>He didn't want the Soul Calming Incense anymore?</p><p>The Daoist nun hadn't expected things to go so smoothly.  She was momentarily stunned, then overjoyed.  Carefully opening the pill bottle, she took a light sniff, a look of intoxication appearing on her face. "The pill is authentic. Many thanks, fellow Daoist!"</p><p>The Daoist elder nodded with a smile, watching the Daoist nun leave. He then turned to Qin Sang and asked, “It seems you won't change your mind either?”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noticing a strange look in the elder's eyes. He was curious about what treasure the elder would offer.</p><p>The Daoist elder sighed lightly, a trace of reluctance in his voice. “This item was originally intended for myself, obtained by chance.  If it weren’t for fellow Daoist presenting such a marvel as the Soul Calming Incense, I would never have traded it…”</p><p>As he spoke, he retrieved a soft silk pouch from his spatial pouch.</p><p>The pouch was only the size of a thumb, very delicate, but its surface appeared rough, woven from grayish-black silk thread in a seemingly random and disordered pattern. It didn't look like anything precious.</p><p>The top of the silk pouch was cinched closed.</p><p>The treasure wasn't the pouch itself, but what lay within.</p><p>The Daoist elder placed the pouch in his palm, carefully touching it.</p><p>Before the item within was even visible, a strange fragrance emanated from the pouch.</p><p>Instantly, the intense aroma filled Qin Sang's nostrils, an indescribable sensation causing him to involuntarily reveal a look of intoxication.</p><p>Not just Qin Sang, but others smelled it as well.</p><p>The strange fragrance filled the area around the pool, overpowering all other scents.</p><p>All eyes focused on the opening of the silk pouch, only to discover that the Daoist elder hadn't opened it fully. Instead, he had made the opening transparent, revealing a glimpse of a small, golden-yellow object inside.</p><p>It was the size of a small fingernail, resembling gold.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>“Have you, fellow Daoist, ever heard of a spiritual insect called the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon?” the Daoist elder asked Qin Sang, holding his palm flat.</p><p>The Immortal Grease Bee Dragon, a wondrous insect of the world!</p><p>On the Spirit Controlling Sect's list of wondrous insects, it ranked even higher than the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Coincidentally, it was said that the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon's divine abilities were related to illusion arts, making it a natural enemy of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly. Its appearance wasn't that of a dragon, but rather resembled a bee. The 'dragon' in its name was derived from the 'Mirage Dragon.'</p><p>There were also legends that the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon possessed true dragon bloodline and could eventually transform into a true dragon.</p><p>Comparatively, the first legend seemed more credible.</p><p>Qin Sang, having studied the Dao of Insect Control for many years, how could he not know?</p><p>“Is this truly Near-Dragon Saliva?” Qin Sang asked in surprise.</p><p>Near-Dragon Saliva, as its name suggested, was similar to the legendary Dragon Saliva, carrying an unparalleled fragrance, unforgettable after a single whiff.</p><p>Seeing it today, it truly lived up to its reputation.</p><p>Near-Dragon Saliva was a wondrous substance secreted by the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist truly has remarkable knowledge!”</p><p>The Daoist elder nodded slightly, relieved that Qin Sang recognized it.  “The Immortal Grease Bee Dragon only secretes Near-Dragon Saliva, condensing its essence Qi, when breeding. The Immortal Grease Bee Dragon only has one opportunity to reproduce in its lifetime, which shows how precious this substance is.  The offspring of the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon can consume it to rapidly transform, while cultivators who refine Near-Dragon Saliva can strengthen their primordial spirit and enhance their divine sense.  More importantly…”</p><p>Pausing slightly, the elder said solemnly, “This piece of Near-Dragon Saliva comes from a five-times transformed Immortal Grease Bee Dragon!”</p><p>A five-transformations spiritual insect!</p><p>A realm equivalent to a Deity Transformation cultivator!</p><p>Another commotion stirred the crowd, many exclaiming that their trip had been worthwhile.</p><p>The Soul Calming Incense, the Azurefall Ginseng Fruit tree, and Near-Dragon Saliva…</p><p>These treasures, which could be considered supreme treasures, were rare even at a Treasure Exchange of this level!</p><p>With these items appearing, others dared not present their own lesser treasures.</p><p>No one noticed</p><p>At the edge of the seating area, beneath the shadow of an ancient cypress tree,</p><p>A young Daoist sat on a meditation cushion. He hadn't completed a single trade from the start and had been silently observing since the Daoist elder stepped forward, outwardly impassive.</p><p>Until Qin Sang presented the Soul Calming Incense.</p><p>The young Daoist seemed tempted several times, but ultimately and reluctantly gave up on bidding.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Near-Dragon Saliva within the silk pouch, sensing the lingering aura of the high-level spiritual insect, secretly astonished.</p><p>If it were Near-Dragon Saliva secreted by a four-transformations Immortal Grease Bee Dragon, he would have considered it carefully. But now, there was no need for hesitation, despite the small size of this piece.</p><p>Near-Dragon Saliva secreted by a five-transformations spiritual insect contained higher-level Dao principles, offering immeasurable benefits that couldn't be measured by size.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't blinded by the treasure.  He looked up and asked the elder, “How can one refine Near-Dragon Saliva?  Why have you kept it until now?”</p><p>'Food' prepared by the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon for its offspring.</p><p>For him, a different race, to refine it, it probably wouldn't be so simple. He certainly wouldn't be able to absorb it completely.</p><p>The Daoist elder knew that Nascent Soul old ghosts were all cunning and nearly impossible to deceive. Thus, he revealed the drawbacks of Near-Dragon Saliva, “Firstly, Near-Dragon Saliva deteriorates upon contact with outside Qi. This pouch is woven from a piece of the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon's nest and must be kept sealed within.  Once opened, it's best to refine it all in one go.  Secondly, Near-Dragon Saliva contains a peculiar energy. The offspring of the Immortal Grease Bee Dragon can consume it directly, but this energy is detrimental to us cultivators. The loss of potency is one thing, but when enduring the impact of this energy, one must carefully separate and expel it from the body.  As for how long this process takes, this old man can’t say for sure. It could be a hundred years, even several hundred. That’s why this old man hesitated before… However, if you are a Spirit Cultivator, it should be much faster.”</p><p>In the Daoist elder's eyes, since Qin Sang hadn't shown interest in any other items and specifically requested this type of treasure, he was most likely a Spirit Cultivator.</p><p>In fact, others shared this speculation.</p><p>Spirit Cultivators were even rarer than Body Cultivators.</p><p>There were sects in the Middle Continent that produced Spirit Cultivators, but rarely did they produce peak experts.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally listed his advantages.</p><p>The secret art, *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Nine Nether Devil Fire.</p><p>Soul Nourishing Wood.</p><p>…</p><p>Even true Spirit Cultivators didn’t possess so many supreme treasures.</p><p>More importantly, the Jade Buddha.</p><p>He wondered what kind of impact the Near-Dragon Saliva would bring and whether the Jade Buddha could withstand it.</p><p>The elder obviously wouldn't explain in detail.</p><p>Perhaps he didn't know either.</p><p>Thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind. He opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly heard the azure-armored man's gloomy voice, "My Azurefall Ginseng Fruits are no less valuable than Near-Dragon Saliva, and can be directly refined without any issues, with immediate effects!  I can add another one. I hope fellow Daoist will reconsider!”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands and apologized, "This one has limited vision and only values what's before him."</p><p>The azure-armored man snorted angrily.</p><p>Unexpectedly, seeing that he couldn't persuade Qin Sang, he changed his target, shouting at the Daoist elder, "Old Daoist, what about you? Azurefall Ginseng Fruits for that Dragon Saliva of yours… I can also produce some of the treasures you seek!  You dare to host the Treasure Exchange, you wouldn't be as timid as this小子, would you?"</p><p>Others, also interested in the Near-Dragon Saliva, tentatively made offers.</p><p>However, the drawbacks mentioned by the elder deterred most.</p><p>The elder hadn't concealed his cultivation after stepping forward; he was a late Nascent Soul grand cultivator. Even he didn't dare to refine the Near-Dragon Saliva easily, which showed that the risks were not exaggerated.</p><p>If it took too long, even with a greatly enhanced divine sense, the price of stagnant cultivation was too high.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation loomed like a sword.</p><p>Most cultivators didn't dare to be distracted.</p><p>Comparatively, they desired the Soul Calming Incense more.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang and the Daoist elder happened to desire each other's treasures, leaving no opportunity for others to interfere.</p><p>Under the azure-armored man's indifferent gaze,</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the jade box forward.</p><p>The Daoist elder carefully undid the restrictions on the jade box, lit the Soul Calming Incense, verified its authenticity, and with uncontainable joy, quickly handed the Near-Dragon Saliva to Qin Sang.</p><p>Everyone was pleased!</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Near-Dragon Saliva and stored it in his Thousand Ton Ring. Without lingering, he stepped down towards the pool, his figure pausing almost imperceptibly.</p><p>The Treasure Exchange continued.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The elder placed a spatial pouch on the water platform, the sound rather heavy.</p><p>"A large amount of Shimmering Silver, in exchange for treasures other than Myriad Year Azure Cloud Dew. Shimmering Silver can be bought with spirit stones outside, but as you all know, Shimmering Silver from the same vein can be refined to obtain Celestial Pivot True Silver. The larger the quantity, the higher the value.  This old man’s Shimmering Silver all comes from the same vein, more than enough to refine into highly pure Celestial Pivot True Silver suitable for crafting pseudo-spiritual treasures.  Its value cannot be measured in spirit stones.  Of course, if any of you can present top-grade spirit stones, that's a different story…"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>If I don't post a single chapter, it means my condition is still good, and I'll try to update as much as possible.</p>
