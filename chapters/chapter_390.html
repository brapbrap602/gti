Chapter 383: The Flying Horned Dragons


A land of ice and snow.


Snow fell heavily.


A biting wind swept in.


Qin Sang channeled her spiritual energy to protect herself from the cold, curiously observing her surroundings.


After encountering Xiao Cao with Yun Youzi, everything around them shattered like a mirage, the world abruptly changing.


Only then did those present realize that the seemingly real plants and trees were, in fact, illusions.


In an instant, the sky darkened, merging with the boundless snow, obscuring everything from view.


The wind howled.


The land transformed into an ice field.


A vast expanse of white met the eye, the wind and snow like knives, cutting across Qin Sang and Yun Youzi's bodies.


Qin Sang suspected that an ordinary person here would have been flayed alive.


Besides the howling wind, nothing could be heard.


Yun Youzi, squatting on the ground, stood up, nodded to Qin Sang, and braved the wind and snow, walking towards the depths of the ice field.


The forest was not large; if they used flying swords, they could reach the end in an instant.  But after returning to the true nature of the ice field, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi walked for a long time, yet still couldn't reach the edge.


The ice field seemed endless.


At this moment, Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if they had broken the illusion or triggered some restriction, being transported to another place.


“Qin, after this, return the way you came.  You won't need to go through all this; you can leave in ten breaths,” Yun Youzi transmitted his voice, promptly reminding Qin Sang.


“I learned from an old text left by a senior that this place has that herb. I later found this place, but last time I only dared to follow the text, not daring to venture elsewhere.  If you're not absolutely certain, Qin, it's best not to go deeper into the ice field.”


Qin Sang nodded, understanding her limitations and not wanting to risk it.


Before she could respond, Yun Youzi suddenly stopped. Qin Sang noticed a crack in the ice field ahead, with crystal-clear ice walls on either side.


The ice layer was of unknown thickness; as far as Qin Sang could see, it was all ice.


“It's below!”


Yun Youzi created a burst of light, leaping into the ice crack.


Seeing Yun Youzi fly in openly without concealing his figure, Qin Sang knew there was likely no danger in the ice crack and followed without hesitation.


The two flew rapidly down along the ice wall.


Soon, Qin Sang suddenly heard the sound of rushing water.  She and Yun Youzi stopped their flight, hovering in mid-air, looking down.


Below was still a thick layer of ice, but strangely, a river flowed on top of the ice, unfrozen, its water swift and crystal clear.


The river was completely transparent, without fish or shrimp.  Surrounded by ice, it appeared a pale blue.


Then, Yun Youzi landed on the river's surface, following the flow of the water.


‘Whoosh…whoosh…’


They walked in a world of ice, under the silent ice layer, only the sound of the river flowing and hitting the ice, crisp and pleasant.


After walking some distance, a silver light suddenly appeared ahead, followed by dozens of silver points.


These silver lights moved irregularly in the icy river; under their illumination, the ice appeared even more deep blue.


In a world of blue, the silver lights were like stars, leaping, chasing...


The scene was extremely beautiful, like a dream.


From afar, the true nature of the silver lights was unclear.  Qin Sang suddenly noticed that the moment the silver lights appeared, Yun Youzi's expression turned grave.  Her heart tightened, knowing the lights were not simple and possibly very dangerous.


“Those silver lights are Flying Horned Dragons, a rare ancient beast.”


Qin Sang heard Yun Youzi’s voice transmission.


“The silver light is the power of lightning condensed on their tentacles, also their most adept attack method. Last time I encountered them unexpectedly, I suffered greatly before I could escape.  Their numbers seem to have grown. Fortunately, I’m prepared this time…”


Saying this, Yun Youzi fumbled and took out a jade bottle.


The jade bottle contained a few drops of clear liquid, resembling water. When the bottle was opened, an intoxicating fragrance filled the air.


Yun Youzi tilted the bottle, carefully pouring out some of the liquid.


The liquid flowed into the icy river and disappeared.


Yun Youzi capped the bottle and handed it to Qin Sang, confidently saying, “I searched through many ancient texts before finding a way to deal with these Flying Horned Dragons, creating this bottle of Drunken Demon Saliva specifically for them.”


A few drops in the river, and they'll be intoxicated for a short time.  We just need to avoid waking them, and we can easily pass..."

"Let's go!"

The two moved silently forward, soon seeing the true form of the flying-horned fish-dragons.

The glacial river converged here into a deep, bottomless pool. On the surface of the pool, floated creatures resembling ancient salamanders, completely transparent, their internal organs clearly visible.  The larger ones were several zhang long, the smaller ones still a zhang or more.  From their heads protruded a sharp tentacle, like a single horn, emitting the silvery light.

At the edge of the pool, Qin Sang clearly sensed the incredibly violent power of lightning contained within the tentacles.  If released, it would cause terrifying destruction.  Even worse, there were so many of them!

Qin Sang silently rejoiced. Yun Youzi hadn't exaggerated; the Drunken Demon Saliva was incredibly effective. The flying-horned fish-dragons lay in the water like corpses, drifting with the current, truly intoxicated.

Reflecting on Yun Youzi's preparations along the way, Qin Sang found the mere gathering of these spirit materials incredibly difficult, let alone refining them into various elixirs. No wonder Yun Youzi had almost missed their appointment.

Seeing this, Yun Youzi was overjoyed, urging, "Qin Lao Di, quickly enter the ice cave!"

Qin Sang looked and saw an ice cave on the opposite shore of the pool. Knowing the opportunity was fleeting, he immediately flew on his sword, entering the ice cave with Yun Youzi following close behind.

The moment they crossed the pool, the effect of the Drunken Demon Saliva wore off. The flying-horned fish-dragons flipped over, resuming their playful activities, completely unaware of the intrusion.

...

The lush jungle remained unchanged.

A man in grey robes appeared silently outside the jungle, his breathing somewhat rapid.  The jungle's end was visible at a glance. He surveyed the unusually calm forest, a hint of doubt flashing in his eyes.

After a moment's thought, the man in grey robes darted into the forest, finally stopping beneath the ancient tree where Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had previously been.

He then began a meticulous search of the surroundings.

No signs of a battle…

No concealing formations or arrays…

The doubt on the grey-robed man's face deepened, tinged with growing impatience.

Suddenly, the grey-robed man seemed to discover something. He whirled around, his eyes fixed on a small plant at the base of the ancient tree.  His lips curled into a strange smile.
