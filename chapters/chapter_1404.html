<h1>Chapter 1396: The Ascendance Ritual</h1><p>Chapter 1396: The Ascendance Ritual</p><p>Qin Sang, possessing the original Witch Clan's life-bound insect Gu technique, wasn't interested in Baihua Valley's modified version.</p><p>He was curious about how much Baihua Valley still understood about the fourth transformation of the life-bound insect Gu!</p><p>Lower-level Baihua Valley disciples couldn't possibly know these secrets.</p><p>After briefly speaking with a few disciples, Qin Sang lost interest.  After reviewing the classics in the scripture library, he returned to his bamboo house to cultivate, awaiting news from Lan Jingsi.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang again took out the ice box, attempting to break the seal.</p><p>The results remained the same, progress was slow.</p><p>He wasn't discouraged in the slightest; a stronger seal meant a more valuable treasure, something worth looking forward to.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Baihua Valley's forbidden area.</p><p>Lan Jingsi sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, her figure blending into the darkness, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>Before her, an extremely complex spirit array was laid out, shaped like an altar.</p><p>After a short while, Lan Jingsi raised a hand, her jade fingers gently tapping the center of the array.</p><p>The array emitted a burst of white light, radiating an invisible fluctuation, its brightness flickering.</p><p>After a few breaths, it returned to darkness, everything as usual.</p><p>Lan Jingsi's expression remained unchanged, continuing her meditation.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lan Jingsi repeated the process.</p><p>This time, a new change finally occurred.</p><p>The white light vibrated, rapidly converging towards the center of the array, forming a sphere of light.</p><p>Then, a man's voice came from within the light sphere.</p><p>“Junior Sister…”</p><p>Lan Jingsi opened her eyes, looking at the light sphere, repeatedly saying, “Senior Brother, you've come out? What were the results?”</p><p>“We only probed the outer perimeter… haven't truly entered… not very optimistic…”</p><p>Perhaps due to the distance, the voice on the other side sounded somewhat blurry and intermittent.</p><p>“What happened… using the precious Sky-Listening Talisman… only three left…”</p><p>A worried tone was conveyed in the voice.</p><p>Seeing her senior brother's misunderstanding, Lan Jingsi quickly said, “Senior Brother, rest assured, everything is fine in the valley! A few days ago, Master Feng brought someone who wanted to visit Senior Brother…”</p><p>“A friend of Master Feng… who is it…”</p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time.</p><p>Lan Jingsi flew out of the forbidden area, heading straight for the bamboo house where Qin Sang resided.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed this and immediately opened the bamboo house's restriction, inviting Lan Jingsi in.</p><p>“I just received a reply from Senior Brother,” Lan Jingsi said without beating around the bush, “Senior Brother said he can reveal it to you… his insect Gu's fourth transformation was achieved using a certain secret technique.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, not expecting it to be so easy.  While overjoyed, he didn't lower his guard, solemnly asking, “Does Senior Brother Mu have any requests?”</p><p>Lan Jingsi shook her head, “Please allow me to explain the advantages and disadvantages of this technique first.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively.</p><p>Lan Jingsi said, “This technique is called the Ascendance Ritual.  Essentially, it uses external objects and forces to stimulate the insect Gu's potential, forcibly helping it advance to the next realm.”</p><p>The Ascendance Ritual.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled, he hadn't heard of this technique on the Witch God Continent.</p><p>Would stimulating the insect Gu's potential with external objects cause serious harm?</p><p>If it meant sacrificing future development for a single advancement, Qin Sang would certainly hesitate.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could voice his concerns, Lan Jingsi proactively explained, “The first time the Ascendance Ritual is used, the impact on the insect Gu is not severe, and there are ways to compensate.  However, repeated use not only drastically reduces the success rate, but also causes irreversible damage to the insect Gu. Even with the initial use of the Ascendance Ritual, the success rate is less than 20%, and that's for Baihua Valley cultivators who are well-prepared.  Your chances of success using the Ascendance Ritual on your Fire Jade Centipede are definitely lower than ours!”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't deterred by her words, immediately asking, “Is the Ascendance Ritual only for the fourth transformation? How can we improve the success rate of the Ascendance Ritual?”</p><p>From Lan Jingsi's words, Qin Sang sensed a different meaning, his heart pounding.</p><p>The fact that Baihua Valley cultivators had a higher success rate with the Ascendance Ritual than outsiders might be due to their cultivation of life-bound insect Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang also happened to possess a life-bound insect Gu!</p><p>Furthermore, his indirect inquiries about the Fire Jade Centipede were actually aimed at finding a way to help his Heaven-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Whether the Fire Jade Centipede could advance wasn't important,</p><p>if the Heaven-Eye Butterfly could be enhanced using the Ascendance Ritual, even just a small realm within the fourth transformation, it would be a tremendous achievement!</p><p>“As for your first question, I haven't actually considered it.  Baihua Valley's ancestors have always used the Ascendance Ritual for the fourth transformation, there's no precedent for using it after the fourth transformation. However…”</p><p>After a moment of thought, Lan Jingsi said, “When our ancestors passed down the Ascendance Ritual, they didn't specify that it could only be used to break through to the fourth transformation. Stimulating potential for advancement, this approach should be applicable to any realm.”</p><p>The difference lies only in the subtlety of the secret arts stimulating potential, and the value of the external objects used. The spiritual objects required for the Ascension Ritual are all extremely valuable; I imagine they would be effective even for a minor advancement in the fourth transformation of a spirit insect.”</p><p>Pausing, Lan Jingsi continued, “Improving the success rate can only be done from within. The closer the bond between the master and the spirit insect, the more intimate and trusting the insect is towards its master, the higher the chance of success.  Furthermore, the master's own cultivation level also has an impact.”</p><p>Lan Jingsi glanced at Qin Sang.  “To be frank, my own spirit insect is only at the peak of its third transformation. I plan to wait until I reach at least the peak of the early Nascent Soul stage before considering helping it break through. Daoist Friend is already in the mid-Nascent Soul stage, so you don't have to worry about that aspect. But I'm not sure what method you used to subdue your spirit insect, or how close your bond is.”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned ignorance. “The Baihua Valley lineage is unique in the cultivation world. Might I borrow some of your insights?”</p><p>Lan Jingsi apologized. “It's not that we are unwilling, but our Baihua Valley techniques are special; they are of no use to cultivators above the Golden Core stage.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, ceasing his inquiries.</p><p>On the surface, he appeared thoughtful, but inwardly he was overjoyed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after arriving in the North Sea, he had a lead on the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Lan Jingsi had used the term 'leap', not a simple breakthrough. Does this mean it doesn't require cultivation to the peak of the current stage?</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet witnessed the Ascension Ritual, so he couldn't judge.</p><p>If he could help the Sky-Eye Butterfly advance, even just one stage, it would be enough.</p><p>Without the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper and Soul Shadow, Qin Sang didn't know how he would break through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Helping the Sky-Eye Butterfly quickly catch up to his own cultivation level was crucial. Due to the nature of his spirit insect, it would provide assistance in future breakthroughs.</p><p>Every little improvement was invaluable!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced; he was determined to obtain the Ascension Ritual.</p><p>However, he knew things wouldn't be so simple.  He didn't directly ask about the ritual, instead changing his tone and asking, “Valley Master Mu must have something to instruct me?”</p><p>Lan Jingsi said solemnly, “My senior brother has instructed me to convey a message: if Daoist Friend Mingyue wishes to learn about the Ascension Ritual, he is requested to make the arduous journey to the Boundless Sea. My senior brother wishes to meet with you.”</p><p>Lan Jingsi produced a jade slip containing a nautical chart.</p><p>She placed it on the table, leaving the decision to Qin Sang.</p>
