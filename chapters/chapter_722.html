Chapter 714: Black Flames


Qin Sang was extremely cautious about refining his first magical treasure.  He took out the jade slip given to him by Shopkeeper Wu and reviewed the refining insights over and over again, carefully comprehending them.

*Whoosh!*

The Ten Yama Envoys Banner enlarged to about ten feet tall, planted in the ground in front of Qin Sang in a triangular formation. The banner's surface fluttered, and Nine Nether Demon Fire gathered in the center, appearing deceptively calm.

Qin Sang pondered for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the various spirit materials. He selected the easiest one to refine, a spirit material called Silver Stone, and drew it into his palm.

The Silver Stone was rough and pitted, like a rock embedded with countless silver beans.

Qin Sang tossed it into the Nine Nether Demon Fire and channeled his true essence.

*Whoosh!*

The Nine Nether Demon Fire expanded and contracted, enveloping the Silver Stone.

The Silver Stone tumbled within the flames.

The power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire was far greater than ordinary earth fire. The surface of the Silver Stone quickly showed signs of melting, but because the refining process demanded a high level of skill from the refiner, the process was still slow.

As smoke billowed, and after a long period of refinement, impurities were purged, leaving behind the purest essence. A large piece of Silver Stone was ultimately reduced to a clump of silver paste the size of a dragon's eye.

Qin Sang wiped the sweat from his forehead and hurriedly retrieved a jade bottle, storing the silver paste inside.  He pinched the bottle's mouth, lifted it to his eyes, and gently shook it.

The silver paste only vibrated slightly on the surface, extremely viscous.

Strangely, there were faint black threads within the silver paste, appearing out of place within the silvery-white liquid.

Qin Sang's expression turned thoughtful. These black threads were the residual power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire after refining spirit materials. He had encountered them more than once when refining magical instruments.

It was just that the color of the silver paste was so pure that they were a bit more noticeable.

Having discovered that this residual power didn't significantly affect the refining of magical instruments and could even enhance their power, Qin Sang didn't bother to remove them; instead, he welcomed their presence.

However, magical treasures were different from magical instruments.

Magical treasures possessed greater power and demanded higher refining standards.

There was a possibility that the presence of Nine Nether Demon Fire wouldn't affect magical instruments but could cause the refining of magical treasures to fail.

Furthermore, when refining magical instruments, Qin Sang only needed to use Nine Nether Demon Fire to refine one or two core spirit materials. Other auxiliary spirit materials could be refined with earth fire, making the process easier.

Every spirit material in a magical treasure was crucial. Qin Sang had to refine each one individually, ultimately resulting in a stronger Nine Nether Demon Fire aura within the treasure.

Qin Sang restored his true essence while pondering the advantages and disadvantages.

Based on his past refining experience, the power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire had already fused with the spirit materials during the refining process.  The likelihood of a sudden outburst during the final stage of refining the magical treasure was low.

And if the refining succeeded in this way, the power of the magical treasure would be greatly enhanced, making it worth a try.

Afterward, Qin Sang proceeded with the refining process step by step.

Activating the Nine Nether Demon Fire consumed true essence too quickly to allow for continuous refining, forcing Qin Sang to be patient and proceed slowly.

Finally, when the last material, the Eternal Camphor, was refined, Qin Sang let out a sigh of relief. He sat down cross-legged and cultivated for a day and a night to wash away his fatigue.

Qin Sang looked at the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the various spirit materials, his gaze sharpening slightly. He suddenly extended his hand and beckoned.

The Yin Ring shot into the demon fire with a *whoosh*.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang's fingers flickered, and several spirit materials flew in as well. Although the Yin Ring was damaged, using it as a guide made refining the Yang Ring prototype much easier.

As time passed, all the spirit materials fused together. Beside the Yin Ring, a Yang Ring prototype of the same size was born.

Qin Sang popped a handful of spirit pills into his mouth and added a few more spirit materials.  The outline of the Yang Ring became increasingly clear, and the rate at which Qin Sang's true essence was consumed was equally alarming.

Qin Sang had lost track of time. He was fully focused on refining the magical treasure, diverting some of his attention to monitor his true essence to prevent it from depleting and ruining his efforts.

Time passed.

By now, all the spirit materials had been thrown into the flames by Qin Sang.  In the center of the demon fire, two bracelet-sized golden rings could be clearly seen standing side by side.

The originally outlined Yang Ring had solidified. The Yin and Yang Rings resonated with each other, vibrating slightly. Although they weren't touching, they already emitted a clear ringing sound.

The next step was crucial!

Qin Sang's expression was serious, not daring to relax in the slightest. At this moment, he held nothing back, directly unsealing his Corpse Pill and pouring all his true essence into the Ten Yama Envoys Banner.

Flames surged, and the ringing sound echoed through the cave, like a demonic resonance.

Deep within the demon fire, the Harmony Rings vibrated intensely, then suddenly fell silent.

The next moment, a bright light erupted!

*Whoosh, whoosh...*

A rapid whooshing sound suddenly rang out. The Nine Nether Demon Fire fluctuated, and then two ring shadows abruptly shot out.

With quick reflexes, Qin Sang reached out and grasped them, his true essence transforming into a large hand that firmly gripped the Harmony Rings. The treasure's struggle weakened, finally yielding and falling into Qin Sang's palm.

A look of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face as he examined the two rings.

The Yin and Yang Rings were identical in shape, completely white and perfectly round. The previously damaged Yin Ring, full of cracks and dull in luster, was now fully restored.

However, unlike before, faint black flames flickered intermittently on the surface of the white rings, most noticeably on the Yang Ring.

Qin Sang knew these black flames were the residual power of the Nine Nether Demon Fire. Fortunately, they hadn't caused any adverse effects during the refining process.

"How will the black flames affect the Harmony Rings?"

Qin Sang was curious and filled with anticipation.

After confirming that the treasure was flawless, he immediately activated his divine sense. The Harmony Rings were now equivalent to a new magical treasure, without any other imprints, and could be directly refined.

A moment later, he stored the treasure in his Qi Sea.  It wouldn't be long before he could claim it as his own, wielding it as an extension of himself.

Several days later.

Qin Sang, who was in the midst of cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked down at his dantian and, with a thought, a white light shot out, transforming into a ring that he caught in his hand.

This was the Yang Ring of the Harmony Rings.

After successful refinement, the Yin Ring remained in the cultivator's dantian, serving both as an early warning system and a means of remotely controlling the Yang Ring, while the Yang Ring was used to subdue demonic beasts.

Qin Sang probed the Yang Ring with his divine sense, closing his eyes slightly.  After examining it, he tried channeling his true essence into it.

A buzzing sound rang out, and the Yang Ring emitted a bright white light, projecting a series of white ring shadows downward. The further down they went, the larger the ring shadows became, forming a pagoda-like structure.

These ring shadows resembled some kind of shackles, possessing a peculiar binding power, though there was no target in front of them.

And on the surface of these ring shadows, faint black flames flickered, preventing them from being purely white.

Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly lit up with intense delight.

The Yang Ring's binding power was far greater than he had anticipated.

Originally, the Harmony Rings could only restrain demonic beasts at the early Core Formation stage. Now, it might be possible to use them to subdue demonic beasts at the mid-Core Formation stage!
