<h1>Chapter 1472 A Visiting Card</h1><p>Chapter 1472 A Visiting Card</p><p>Leaving the Water Palace,</p><p>Qin Sang lost no time in escaping overseas, far from the demon realm. He found a deserted island and left the demon corpse there.</p><p>Most of the frog-fish's essence was in its venomous scales. Qin Sang didn't have high hopes, and after dissecting the corpse, he indeed found no so-called poison pellet.</p><p>At that moment, the fat silkworm suddenly squeaked and jumped out, twisting its body to burrow into the frog-fish's lower jaw. It then pulled out a small, transparent sac.</p><p>“This… could it be a poison sac?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, but he didn't stop it.</p><p>The fat silkworm stole a glance at Qin Sang. Seeing his tacit approval, it chirped with even greater joy, spitting out a seven-colored halo that enveloped the poison sac before swallowing it whole. Then, it disappeared into Ya Gu's body as swiftly as a flash of lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang watched, secretly thinking that this creature was indeed picky. During its travels in the demon realm, it had encountered several poisonous beasts, but the fat silkworm had scorned them all. Only the poison sac of this transformed great demon could tempt it.</p><p>The reason, he guessed, was not only the frog-fish's high cultivation, but also that its innate ability was entirely related to poison.</p><p>“After swallowing the poison sac, I wonder if the fat silkworm can advance to the fourth transformation. In the demon realm, such poisonous beasts are rare. I heard there's a poisonous cloud steed, a general under the Nine-Headed Great Saint, who usually cultivates in the Myriad Demons Cave and rarely appears, making it difficult to get hold of.”</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang processed the frog-fish's remains, refining them into spiritual materials and storing them in his Qianjun Ring before heading south.</p><p>This was a sort of homecoming.</p><p>Passing Fengyang Mountain, Qin Sang returned to the String Moon Realm, but without disturbing Feng Shangshi and the others, he traveled discreetly.</p><p>From the demon realm to the Star Sand Islands and then to the String Moon Realm, although he hadn't found any fragments of the Killing Sword, he had broadened his horizons considerably, making the trip worthwhile.</p><p>He traveled south leisurely, secretly approaching the large and small sects of the String Moon Realm.  He would leave as soon as he confirmed the absence of any Killing Sword fragments, ensuring he didn't disturb anyone and wouldn't waste much time.</p><p>Qin Sang’s speed was extraordinary, and he soon arrived at the most dangerous place in the String Moon Realm—the Bottomless Demon Cave!</p><p>Years ago, when Qin Sang was purchasing materials to refine the Golden Sinking Sword, a Nascent Soul cultivator from the String Moon Realm had invited him to explore the Bottomless Demon Cave together, using it as a condition.  He had refused.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't intend to venture deep into the Bottomless Demon Cave either.</p><p>His strength was far greater now, but he lacked the time. He had to return to Xuan Tian Palace before the Sacred Land opened.</p><p>The exit of the Bottomless Demon Cave was surrounded by a ring of stone mountains, nestled between three peaks.</p><p>The three peaks were entirely composed of piled stones, devoid of any greenery. The surrounding area, for tens of miles, was equally desolate and lifeless.</p><p>Standing at the cave entrance, a chill inexplicably ran down Qin Sang's spine. After staring for a while, he summoned his spiritual sword for protection and jumped in.</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang emerged from the cave.</p><p>The cave was indeed as legendary – bottomless, with ancient restrictions layered within. Qin Sang carefully infiltrated deep into the cave’s belly, reaching a point even he found dangerous.  His sword spirit remained unresponsive, indicating a low probability of the Killing Sword fragments being there.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley was located to the east of the Bottomless Demon Cave, on the other side of the Black Swamp.</p><p>Crossing the Black Swamp, Qin Sang found the mountain gate of Hundred Flowers Valley according to his memory.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the scenery here had drastically changed.  The miasma that once covered a vast area had dissipated, and the giant mountain range within the miasma, as well as Hundred Flowers Valley itself, had vanished.</p><p>The sight before him was no different from any other part of the Black Swamp.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, discerning the strangeness. He awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Indeed, a great formation was concealing the true landscape.</p><p>Such a large-scale undertaking by Hundred Flowers Valley… Had something major happened recently? Or had Valley Master Mu failed to escape the clutches of the Mixed Demon Elder, as Qin Sang had guessed?</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly. He revealed himself from the shadows, approaching the edge of the illusionary array and sending a stream of light into it.</p><p>A moment later…</p><p>Suddenly, shadows flickered ahead, and the miasma appeared, rolling back to either side, revealing a familiar voice from within, "Daoist Mingyue, Mu has been waiting for you for a long time!"</p><p>“Valley Master Mu, long time no see!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart settled slightly as he smiled towards the miasma.</p><p>Valley Master Mu emerged from the miasma to greet him personally.</p><p>Seeing Valley Master Mu's slightly pale face, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He sensed an instability in his aura, as if he were wounded, and asked with surprise, "Valley Master Mu, what…"</p><p>Valley Master Mu's voice was bitter, "Daoist, your guess is correct. I was severely injured by the old demon and haven't recovered yet. My strength is greatly affected."</p><p>With that, Valley Master Mu invited Qin Sang into the array.</p><p>The two flew towards Hundred Flowers Valley, conversing as they went.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Valley Master Mu, realizing the severity of his injuries, which were impossible to conceal.</p><p>Master Mu recounted the events of that day, "Thankfully, the Daoist Master finally channeled the power of the Thousand Buddhas Wall, hindering the Old Demon Hun. I gained a chance to breathe and escape the ghost spirit's assault.  Sadly, Daoists Qi and Wang couldn't escape. Not only were their physical bodies destroyed, but their primordial spirits were captured, and the Old Demon intended to search their souls. Unable to bear seeing them suffer such torment, I self-destructed my Black Demon Ants to disrupt the Old Demon's soul-searching technique, resulting in severe injuries to myself…"</p><p>Afterward, Master Mu, knowing he was too weak to continue vying for the treasure, sadly left the Jinghai Sect, taking the descendants of Daoists Qi and Wang with him to protect them from the Old Demon's wrath.</p><p>Upon returning to Hundred Flowers Valley, he sealed the valley, remaining there to this day.</p><p>At this point, Master Mu's expression darkened. He said coldly, "In recent years, people of unknown identity have been active nearby, spying on Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>"Is the Old Demon so brazen?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. It seemed the Old Demon Hun hadn't given up.</p><p>Master Mu coldly snorted, "In the Xuan Yue Realm, I wouldn't fear that demon. If I weren't injured, I would have already confronted him! I've been worried that the Daoist Master also fell victim to the Old Demon. Seeing you safe, I can finally rest easy."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled inwardly, understanding that Master Mu's true concern was the Myriad Spirit Fruits.</p><p>This was precisely why he had come.  Without beating around the bush, he admitted to obtaining the Myriad Spirit Fruits with the guidance of the Fire Jade Centipede, but he concealed the true number, claiming to have only four.</p><p>He didn't mention the Myriad Spirit Fruit tree or the events at the Buddha Hall treasure hunt.</p><p>Master Mu neither confirmed nor denied, clearly not entirely believing him, but he didn't call him out on it.</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang saw many unfamiliar faces within the valley—the descendants of Daoists Qi and Wang.</p><p>Lan Jingsi, who had been in seclusion, emerged from her cave dwelling to greet Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a fervent eagerness in Lan Jingsi's gaze. Her spirit insect Gu was still at the peak of its third transformation and she had been hesitant to advance it, needing a Myriad Spirit Fruit to increase her chances of success.</p><p>Each with their own thoughts, the three engaged in cheerful conversation, settling into a bamboo building.</p><p>After some pleasantries…</p><p>Qin Sang said, "My visit is twofold: to see Master Mu and to ask a favor of you both."</p><p>Master Mu conveniently ignored the first part.  "Daoist Master, what troubles you?  As long as it's within Hundred Flowers Valley's capabilities, my junior sister and I will do our best to help!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "It wouldn't be worth troubling you both if it were a trifling matter. My Fire Jade Centipede is about to face its fourth transformation, as you both know. After learning of the ascension technique, I've traveled far and wide, gathering spirit materials, but such treasures are rare and incredibly difficult to obtain. I imagine Hundred Flowers Valley must have a treasured collection, so I've come to humbly request your assistance."</p><p>Master Mu, well aware of this, looked troubled, adopting a hesitant demeanor. "This...the materials required for ascension are incredibly rare and vital to our valley's legacy. After generations of use, we have only a few remaining, I'm afraid…"</p><p>"I understand. I was presumptuous!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, rising to leave. "Let's pretend I never mentioned this…"</p><p>"Daoist Master, wait!"</p><p>Master Mu, unprepared for Qin Sang's unexpected move, quickly rose to stop him. Seeing the playful glint in Qin Sang's eyes, he felt ashamed of his pretense and directly stated his terms. "I can provide the Daoist Master with a complete set of materials needed for ascension. However…I hope you'll understand our predicament.  The Yuan Yin Water and two other crucial materials will be exchanged for three Myriad Spirit Fruits—a fair price, I believe. I will gift the other materials without charge."</p><p>Qin Sang replied with a wry smile, "I only have four Myriad Spirit Fruits, and you're asking for most of them."</p><p>Master Mu stated seriously, "Even if it were a completed Tranquil Spirit Incense, along with several additional materials, I wouldn't dare to make such a request.  The Myriad Spirit Fruit is just one ingredient in the Tranquil Spirit Incense, and its effects are limited, so this price is quite reasonable."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't agree.</p><p>His claim of having only four Myriad Spirit Fruits, rather than any other number, subtly indicated his bottom line.</p><p>He could spare three Myriad Spirit Fruits, but Master Mu would have to offer more in return.</p><p>"A complete set of materials, plus two separate portions of Yin Underworld Soil!" Qin Sang held up one finger, then two more.</p><p>"Why so much Yin Underworld Soil, Daoist Master?"</p><p>Master Mu, prepared to haggle, was surprised by Qin Sang's unusual request.</p><p>He exchanged a look with Lan Jingsi and pondered, "Daoist Master, you don't know, Yin Underworld Soil is an extremely rare material.  Our ancestor traveled across the North Sea and only found a small piece in an ancient cultivator's cave. After generations of use by Hundred Flowers Valley, very little remains, and we've never been able to replenish it. This has become our biggest problem."</p><p>My junior sister and I must consider future generations. We can only provide the Daoist Master with one more portion of Yinming Earth," Mu Guzhu said firmly.</p><p>Qin Sang understood that this was non-negotiable.  He mused silently; he had requested three portions of Yinming Earth to prepare for three spirit insects. However, the Fat Silkworm wasn't his spirit insect, and his chances of successfully raising its level were extremely low. Furthermore, the Fat Silkworm was currently devouring the poison sac, and might break through to its fourth transformation without needing any level-up.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang dropped his insistence and offered a different condition, "This humble Daoist is a latecomer to the art of insect control, and my experience is limited.  I hope Valley Master Mu can offer some guidance."</p><p>"That’s easily done!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu clapped and laughed, readily agreeing.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled as well, taking out three jade boxes and placing them on the table. Valley Master Mu signaled to Lan Jingsi, who carefully examined the Wanling Fruits. Though the fruit skins were slightly dull and wrinkled, they were undeniably Wanling Fruits.</p><p>Lan Jingsi went to the treasure vault and quickly returned, giving Qin Sang a pouch. Qin Sang carefully counted the contents and confirmed everything was correct.  The Yinming Earth was a grayish-white stone; its surface showed no unusual characteristics.</p><p>Both sides put away their treasures, both pleased with the exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang then planned to stay at Hundred Flowers Valley for a while to learn insect control techniques. Valley Master Mu held a grand banquet in Qin Sang's honor.</p><p>Amidst the convivial atmosphere, a disciple suddenly reported that a Golden Core stage cultivator had arrived outside the formation, claiming to be a successor of the Hunmo Elder, requesting an audience with the Valley Master.</p><p>The lively atmosphere immediately turned frigid.</p><p>Qin Sang swirled the wine cup in his hand, silent.</p><p>Valley Master Mu slammed his hands on the table, enraged. "That old demon is rampant! I didn't bother with him before, but he dares to come to our door! Bring that person here and kill him! Throw the corpse to the poisonous insects!"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, whispering, "Valley Master Mu, please calm down. Even in war between nations, envoys are not killed. Let's see what Hunmo Elder wants."</p><p>The Hunmo Elder’s envoy’s timing was peculiar—choosing this moment to appear. Something felt amiss.</p><p>Valley Master Mu frowned and instructed a disciple, "The Daoist is right. Spare his life for now. Go and bring that person in!"</p><p>A moment later, the disciple led a young man in a black robe into the hall. The black-robed youth, facing the three Yuan Ying cultivators who hadn't concealed their auras, remained calm and composed, bowing and saying, "Junior Yun Haifeng greets the three seniors."</p><p>"What is your relationship with Hunmo Elder?  What brings you here?" Lan Jingsi asked.</p><p>"He is my grandmaster!"</p><p>The black-robed youth kept his head down, not daring to look up.  "My grandmaster instructed me to deliver a visiting card, but not to the two seniors of Hundred Flowers Valley. It must be presented when Hundred Flowers Valley opens its gates to welcome a distinguished guest."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Valley Master Mu and Lan Jingsi both turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was highly likely that Hunmo Elder was after Qin Sang.  Unable to find him directly, he was using his connection with Valley Master Mu. Qin Sang guessed this possibility and wondered what the old demon was up to.</p><p>Hadn't he been relentlessly pursuing him at the Wanmo Conference? Now he wants reconciliation?</p><p>"Where is the visiting card?"</p><p>The black-robed youth spoke with utmost respect. "Forgive my impoliteness, but I dare ask, Senior, are you the one my grandmaster met at the Buddhist temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Indeed."</p><p>Receiving confirmation, the black-robed youth didn't dare to ask more questions, immediately presenting a visiting card and standing quietly to the side.</p><p>Under the curious gazes of Valley Master Mu and Lan Jingsi, Qin Sang unfolded the visiting card, read it, his expression strange, and remained silent.</p><p>"Is the old demon threatening the Daoist?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu, even more curious, used voice transmission to ask.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and handed the visiting card over.</p><p>Valley Master Mu unfolded and read it, his expression slightly stunned. He said incredulously, "This old demon actually wants to reconcile with the Daoist and cooperate fully?"</p><p>The content of the visiting card was simple.</p><p>Hunmo Elder claimed to admire Qin Sang's abilities.  Since neither side had suffered irreparable losses, nor was there a blood feud, he hoped they could bury the hatchet.</p><p>They had a common enemy, a powerful one, which served as a basis for their alliance.</p><p>Furthermore, Hunmo Elder admitted his initial wrongdoing, offering treasures as an apology to resolve their enmity and jointly plan a momentous undertaking.</p><p>If Qin Sang was interested, they could meet and discuss, with the location to be determined by Qin Sang, demonstrating his sincerity.</p><p>From the words of the black-robed youth and the content of the visiting card, Valley Master Mu deduced that Qin Sang and Hunmo Elder had clashed at the Jinghai Sect, resulting in a feud.</p><p>Hunmo Elder seemed to have gained little advantage and acknowledged Qin Sang as a peer, proactively seeking reconciliation.</p><p>Moreover, the force that could compel two top-tier experts to unite against it could only be the Yaozu or the Xuantian Palace in the entire North Sea. What else had Master Mingyue done to offend them?</p><p>Valley Master Mu’s thoughts raced, gaining a deeper understanding of Qin Sang's strength and further solidifying his desire to cultivate a friendship.</p><p>He was even more curious about the momentous undertaking Hunmo Elder mentioned, but he also understood that it was akin to "colluding with a tiger," fraught with extreme risk.</p><p>Valley Master Mu looked up at Qin Sang, guessing how he would decide.</p>
