<h1>Chapter 2258: Omens</h1><p>For the past ten years, Qin Sang has primarily focused on refining the Azure Sky Thunder and cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony technique.</p><p>As for the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, he only needed to cultivate for a few days at calculated intervals, to avoid making his progress seem too astonishing.  However, Qin Sang felt a constant sense of urgency, ultimately choosing to reach the mid-Nascent Soul stage within this decade.</p><p>During this time, the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird also remained unseen, diligently refining the Azure-Star Illumination divine ability.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang most was that, during the refinement of the Azure Sky Thunder, he actually developed his own true Azure-Crested Bird Thunder!</p><p>Qin Sang was certain this was genuine Azure-Crested Bird Thunder, indistinguishable from that of the Azure-Crested Bird clan, because he could refine it further, just like the clan's cultivators, eventually possessing his own Azure-Crested Bird True Thunder!</p><p>“What does this mean? Am I human or a demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang was baffled.</p><p>Since entering the illusionary realm, the *Celestial Demon Transformation* has exhibited many unusual aspects.</p><p>This situation was unprecedented, and Qin Sang didn't know whether it was good or bad, so he could only proceed step by step.</p><p>“Senior, you’re finally awake.”</p><p>One day, while Qin Sang was cultivating as usual, he heard the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird call out.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the Azure-Crested Bird's voice was clearer than before. As his cultivation progressed, their communication became increasingly smoother.</p><p>The mysterious Azure-Crested Bird initiated a conversation about Qin Sang's current cultivation level. Upon hearing the answer, it was greatly astonished. “You… you broke through again?”</p><p>To a powerful being like the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird, ten years were just a blink of an eye. It only felt like an eternity due to the difficult circumstances and the constant threat of powerful enemies.</p><p>“The Azure Sky Thunder is truly compatible with me! I’m deeply grateful to you, Senior, for guiding me here and giving me the chance to refine it.”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was filled with gratitude, giving all the credit to the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird and the Azure Sky Thunder.</p><p>The mysterious Azure-Crested Bird fell silent for a moment. Qin Sang's previous performance had gradually ignited a spark of hope in it from its initial despair, but it had still underestimated his potential.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to dwell on this topic for too long and eagerly asked, “Senior, how's the refinement of the divine ability coming along?”</p><p>“There's progress…”</p><p>Replied the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly said, “Is there anything I can do to help, Senior?”</p><p>“If successful, I can… send you in…”</p><p>The mysterious Azure-Crested Bird explained haltingly to Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon understanding, Qin Sang's spirits soared.</p><p>Over the ten years, the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird had been fending off attacks while refining the Azure-Star Illumination divine ability, achieving some success.</p><p>Initially, it could only transmit its thoughts. Now, it could attempt to transmit a spell to Qin Sang, who would then cast it! Moreover, this could only be done between them, as it relied on their connection as a 'bridge'.</p><p>However, problems remained, as only ten years had passed, and the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird had been constantly attacked, preventing it from focusing.</p><p>There were three main problems.</p><p>Firstly, the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird couldn't guarantee success. The transmission had to be extremely cautious, as any leak would alert its enemies.</p><p>If the enemies cut off their connection or discovered Qin Sang's existence and sent their minions to hunt him down, it would completely ruin their hopes, beyond redemption.</p><p>Therefore, after transmitting the spell, the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird couldn't do much more; it would all depend on Qin Sang from then on.</p><p>Secondly, the transmitted spell would inevitably be weakened, and its final power in Qin Sang's hands was uncertain.</p><p>Thirdly, regardless of its power, it came from a powerful being. Since it would be cast through Qin Sang, he would inevitably bear an extraordinary burden, posing a great test for him.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang had broken through again, his endurance had also improved, so the mysterious Azure-Crested Bird decided to make an attempt.</p><p>If the experiment was successful, it could send Qin Sang to the depths of the Azure Sky Void, to the source of the Azure Sky Thunder.</p><p>That was the birthplace of the Azure Sky Thunder, or more precisely, where the Azure-Crested Bird clan created it.  Besides complex formations, there was one crucial item there.</p><p>“I wonder what this item you want me to retrieve is, Senior?”</p><p>Qin Sang was curious.</p><p>The mysterious Azure-Crested Bird didn't hide it.  “A… part of our clan's sacred artifact…”</p><p>“Sacred artifact?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly amazed. No wonder the Azure Sky Thunder was so mysterious; it was connected to the Azure-Crested Bird clan's sacred artifact.</p><p>It can be said that without this sacred artifact, Qingxiao Lightning would never have existed.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan's goal is simple: Qin Sang's rapid cultivation speed after refining Qingxiao Lightning shows a natural affinity between him, the lightning, and the artifact.</p><p>If Qin Sang could directly refine the artifact, his cultivation speed would undoubtedly increase dramatically.</p><p>This sounds incredible.  The Qingluan clan hasn't appeared before, but that doesn't mean they won't in the future.  A new era has begun; some beings are always chosen by fate, destined for greatness. Why not Qin Sang?</p><p>The fact that Qin Sang can hear its call proves his extraordinary nature.  The mysterious Qingluan has no other choice; it must try.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan told Qin Sang to prepare.  During a lull in the enemy attacks, the transference would begin!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately left his cave, moving stealthily north to a misty area.  He knew the way, easily entering a hidden marsh.</p><p>The water was crystal clear, devoid of fish, with only a few scattered spirit trees.  These trees were unusual, each bearing a single, enormous flower atop its branches, resembling a lotus.  A blue lotus fruit grew in the heart of each flower.</p><p>Another batch of blue lotus fruits was about to ripen. Qin Sang harvested them and returned to his cave to wait.</p><p>Ten days later, the mysterious Qingluan contacted Qin Sang again.</p><p>"Summon... the Dharma Image... still your mind..."</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in his cave, facing the distant Qingxiao sky, and slowly closed his eyes.  The Qingluan Dharma Image appeared behind him, its wings fluttering gently before merging into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Instantly, blue lightning illuminated the cave, surrounding Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind calmed completely, experiencing utter emptiness. There was nothing, not even the mysterious Qingluan's voice.</p><p>He patiently waited. After an unknown time, he felt a strange sensation.</p><p>A light appeared in the void, seeming both bluish and ethereal, like starlight.</p><p>The light came from nowhere, descending in an instant!</p><p>Inside the cave...</p><p>Qin Sang remained with his eyes closed, but his body suddenly stood, facing the Qingxiao sky.  He raised his right arm, extending his index finger, and drew a line downwards.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang seemed to suffer a grievous injury. His breathing grew shallow, his face contorted in pain, blood flowing from his orifices—a horrifying sight.</p><p>"Is this the power of a Great Being?"</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly shocked.</p><p>Even though the mysterious Qingluan had carefully controlled the power, considering his cultivation level and weakening it multiple times, and even with Qin Sang's Nascent Soul-level perception and control, it was still incredibly difficult.</p><p>At the peak of the pressure, Qin Sang nearly thought he would explode and die.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Both Qin Sang and the mysterious Qingluan breathed a sigh of relief, filled with exhilaration. This success was incredibly significant, meaning the Qingluan could now directly assist Qin Sang, finally ensuring his safety.</p><p>The same was true for Qin Sang; he was a step closer to finding the Liuli.</p><p>However, they had only glimpsed a ray of hope. Qin Sang could only endure one transference. The Qingluan feared detection by the enemy and dared not perform it consecutively.  In a crucial moment, a single spell wouldn't solve the problem; they needed further refinement.</p><p>Though suffering from backlash and weakness, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  He quickly swallowed a handful of pills and took a step forward.</p><p>Before him, where his finger had passed, a blue light flickered, resembling a streak of blue lightning.  A closer look revealed a fissure in space, a breach in the Qingxiao sky array!</p><p>Despite the weakened power, the mysterious Qingluan knew the array intimately.  This was akin to it personally intervening, achieving a significant effect with minimal effort, directly sending Qin Sang to the core of the secret realm.</p><p>The blue light parted, revealing a gateway.  Qin Sang stepped through.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang found himself above a pool of clear spring water.</p><p>In all directions, it was empty, except for this floating spring.  The water was exceptionally pure; gazing at the calm surface, Qin Sang felt his mind settle.</p><p>"Take it out."</p><p>said the mysterious Qingluan.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something in the spring. Following the secret technique imparted by the Qingluan, he carefully drew the object.</p><p>Slowly, ripples disturbed the water's surface.  An item, accompanied by a blue light, gently rose to the top.</p><p>This object was ethereal as smoke, soft as water, pure as the purest azure light. It seemed not to truly exist in this world, utterly sacred, prompting an urge to prostrate oneself in reverence, forbidding any casual handling.</p><p>It also resembled a beating heart, constantly pulsing.</p><p>This object was formed from the extracted power of the Qingluan clan's sacred artifact, equivalent to a part of the artifact itself.</p><p>To protect it, the Qingluan clan had set up numerous safeguards.</p><p>Alas, even the most careful precautions couldn't prevent an internal thief, especially one more powerful than the clan leader.</p><p>"Attempt... to refine it..."</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan's tone held anticipation.</p><p>"What repercussions would I face if I refine it?" Qin Sang gazed at the sacred object, hesitant.</p><p>Artifacts that create Qingxiao Thunder always carry risks during refinement.</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan pondered, then informed Qin Sang of the potential consequences.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was too low. Forcibly refining the sacred object might drain his potential, preventing him from progressing beyond the peak of the Fazhang realm.</p><p>If their plan succeeded in driving away the extra-dimensional demons, the mysterious Qingluan promised to help him resolve the hidden dangers. If it failed, everything was irrelevant; whether Qin Sang could break through would no longer matter.</p><p>Of course, these were only the mysterious Qingluan's speculations, and might not come to pass.</p><p>"You should leave..."</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan urged.</p><p>Qin Sang understood he couldn't stay long.  Previously, he'd only stolen Qingxiao Thunder; now he'd gone further, directly stealing the sacred object. If the Qingluan clan discovered this, their entire clan would undoubtedly be enraged.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang didn't forget to collect more Qingxiao Thunder and harvest a batch of Blue Lotus Fruits.</p><p>From Qin Sang's arrival to his departure, over a decade passed. The Qingluan strong one guarding the place remained asleep, oblivious, completely unaware that the sacred realm had become empty.</p><p>"Senior, where are we going now?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He was full of expectation.  If he could raid a few more such sacred realms and holy lands, wouldn't he become incredibly wealthy?</p><p>"Those holy lands... are more heavily guarded... not something you can breach... don't be... too greedy... focus on refining the sacred object... its benefits are immeasurable..."</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan imparted this lesson to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Qingluan clan's holy lands were different from this sacred realm. They were crucial to the clan's rise and fall, and even using Qin Sang, the mysterious Qingluan had no guarantee of success.</p><p>As for other sacred realms, it hadn't paid attention to them before and didn't want Qin Sang to waste his energy there.</p><p>Qin Sang's only task now was to quickly improve his cultivation. The higher his cultivation, the more he could withstand the transmission of stronger divine abilities and techniques, and contend with the extra-dimensional demons' minions.</p><p>"...go to the battlefield... the greatest treasures are most likely... born on... the battlefield..."</p><p>Leaving this cryptic message, the mysterious Qingluan fell silent again, having expended considerable effort for this transmission.</p><p>"Then let's go back."</p><p>Qin Sang mused, his gains far exceeding expectations. He wondered what surprises this Qingluan clan sacred object would bring.</p><p>Qin Sang then headed west.  He didn't rush to refine the Qingluan clan sacred object on the road, but instead used various methods to comprehend its characteristics.</p><p>Since no Qingluan had ever done this before, the mysterious Qingluan couldn't guide Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled relentlessly, day and night.</p><p>One day, flying through the sky, halfway to the battlefield, he disguised himself, a strand of Qingxiao Thunder hidden in his palm, refining it as he traveled.</p><p>Deep into the night, under a cloudless sky, the Milky Way shone brilliantly.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. He abruptly stopped mid-air, feeling a sudden pang of foreboding. He was certain it wasn't from himself, but from the outside world; a moment ago, the heavens seemed to tremble.</p><p>Even in the darkness, everything below was clearly visible to Qin Sang.</p><p>The mountains, rivers, plants, and animals showed no abnormalities.</p><p>Qin Sang also saw several demon cultivators gathering together, absorbing starlight, and they too showed no unusual signs.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang heard the mysterious Qingluan's cry.</p><p>Clearly, it hadn't been Qin Sang's imagination; the mysterious Qingluan had also sensed it.</p><p>Could only he and the mysterious Qingluan sense it, while other beings couldn't?</p><p>Qin Sang thought quickly; the mysterious Qingluan was a powerful being, and he was an extra-dimensional demon.</p><p>Could it be...?</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed the reason, feigning confusion and bewilderment, saying, "Senior, what do you mean? Did the clan discover that I stole the sacred object and are chasing after me?"</p><p>His voice then changed to one of alarm, perfectly believable.</p><p>"It's not pursuers... the Heavenly Mandate is trembling... an omen... the omen has appeared!"</p><p>The mysterious Qingluan urged repeatedly, "The omen of a supreme treasure's appearance... quickly... quickly go to the battlefield!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.  It was indeed the imminent appearance of a supreme treasure that could trigger the trembling of the Heavenly Mandate.</p><p>It seemed that the method deduced by the powerful beings of this world through the Heavenly Mandate's divination had worked.  During his ten years of seclusion in Qingxiao Bixu, the two sides had been engaged in ceaseless warfare, the battlefield already awash in blood.  Finally, it was about to draw out the supreme treasure!</p>
