<h1>Chapter 1002:  Unrequited Affection</h1><p>Chapter 1002:  Unrequited Affection</p><p>Afterwards, the two exchanged cultivation insights on the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique*, enjoying a lively discussion.  A cultivator and a descendant of a Jiao dragon, their understandings of the technique differed greatly, each having their own strengths.  After a session of discussion, both gained something from the exchange.</p><p>"Since I don't need to go to the Seal Land, I won't trouble you further," Qin Sang bowed slightly.</p><p>Then, he remembered something, retrieving a Xuanjia Talisman from his Qianjun Ring.  "In ten years, the Seven Killing Hall will reappear.  The Nine Phoenix King drove a long feather into the Inner Hall; I suspect she might lead people into the Seven Killing Hall again.  Do you have a way to integrate my essence blood into this Xuanjia Talisman? If I encounter a similar situation again, it might give me some room to maneuver…"</p><p>Qin Sang was being proactive.</p><p>No one knew how many demon kings had infiltrated the Inner Sea, nor what their plans were.</p><p>He suspected it wasn't just the Nine Phoenix King.</p><p>If he encountered other demon kings at the Seven Killing Hall, he wouldn't have Yuan Zhu to help him conceal his actions this time.</p><p>Yuan Zhu paced back and forth, lost in thought for a long time, before shaking his head. "These Xuanjia Talismans were personally refined by the Jiao King. Although I've intentionally and unintentionally inquired about them, I actually know very little.  Tampering with the restrictions could easily damage the talisman itself.  Trying to deceive the demon kings this way will likely be difficult."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed but understood that this couldn't be forced.</p><p>He put away the Xuanjia Talisman, about to take his leave.</p><p>Yuan Zhu hesitated, then suddenly said, "If you're worried about being recognized by the demon kings, I do have a method. It might make them hesitant to act rashly against you."</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. "Please tell me."</p><p>"I have an unnamed secret technique I unexpectedly obtained.  You've cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique*, and the demonic aura on you is extremely pure. Using this technique, you might fool the demon kings into thinking you're a transformed great demon. After all, the Nine Phoenix King and the others are from the Demon Sea and don't understand the power dynamics of the Canglang Sea's demon tribes. Here, surrounded by enemies, if they see a member of their own kind, they'll likely try to win you over rather than offend you.  By stabilizing the situation, you can then find a chance to escape."</p><p>As Yuan Zhu spoke, he produced a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"This technique can only be used to bluff, to feign the cultivation of a Transformed Demon. Otherwise, it's useless. When using it, you can't use your true essence; the moment you do, you'll be exposed. Only we demons can detect this subtle difference; it won't work on Yuan Ying cultivators among the human cultivators.  Furthermore, whether it can fool the demon kings is still unknown, so don't be careless."</p><p>Qin Sang used his divine sense to examine the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>As Yuan Zhu said, it was a rather useless technique.</p><p>Activating it only caused a peculiar change in one's demonic aura, making it seem similar to that of a transformed great demon—deep, restrained, and enigmatic—but it didn't enhance one's strength at all.</p><p>It was easy to be discovered.</p><p>Even so, it was still a viable option.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Yuan."</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, deciding to master this technique later.</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled. "If you can cause the Nine Phoenix King and the others some trouble, it would be considered revenge for me."</p><p>…</p><p>After bidding farewell to Yuan Zhu, Qin Sang returned to the Inner Sea.</p><p>Ten years—not long, nor short.</p><p>He needed to prepare as much as possible for his next trip to the Seven Killing Hall and gather some resources that he could use after returning to the Little Cold Domain.</p><p>"I should go to the Demon Sea…"</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang made his decision.</p><p>Further comprehension of the killing talisman also required battling demons and beasts in the Demon Sea.</p><p>He would consider these ten years as laying a foundation for the future.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't go directly to Tianxing City; he took a long detour, first visiting Lingchun Island.</p><p>Lingchun Island was the location of the Wang sisters' sect.  They had gone into hiding after being implicated by him; he wondered how they were doing now.</p><p>Although Tianfeng Island had been destroyed, the crisis wasn't entirely over.</p><p>Qin Sang indirectly inquired about the results of the Tianfeng Island battle from Ning Wu-hui. He learned that even within the Heavenly Dao Sect, rumors were rife, with no definitive conclusion on what happened to Old Devil Mu.</p><p>If Old Devil Mu had been killed on the spot, wouldn't the righteous and demonic paths have announced it to the world, to deter others?</p><p>There must be some hidden circumstances.</p><p>Lingchun Island was not large, but its scenery was picturesque.</p><p>The Wang sisters' sect was actually an insignificant small sect; otherwise, the Wang sisters wouldn't have had to venture into the Demon Sea during their Foundation Establishment stage to hunt for Demonic Corpse Pills.</p><p>Only ordinary people lived on Lingchun Island.</p><p>Qin Sang, following clues left by the Wang sisters, passed through several mortal towns and located their sect hidden within a treacherous mountain range inaccessible to ordinary mortals.</p><p>Two mountains embraced a murmuring river; a breathtakingly beautiful scene unfolded before him.  From a mountain peak, Qin Sang used his celestial vision to quickly detect something amiss.  He swiftly moved to a stone wall, pressed his hand against it, and channeled his energy into the stone.  The hidden mechanism within the wall responded.</p><p>A bamboo pavilion appeared. Inside, a beautifully dressed young woman meditated, eyes closed.  Suddenly, a mirror beside her blazed with light, startling her awake.  A look of alarm flashed across her eyes. She brushed the mirror, saw its reflection, gasped, and cried out:</p><p>"Sister! Sister! Look who's here!"</p><p>This was Wang Xiang.</p><p>Moments later, two sisters, as lovely as twin lotuses, rushed out of the pavilion, their faces etched with urgency. Several younger girls were playing outside; they were astonished by their senior sisters' flustered state.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed as the stone wall split open, revealing two joyous cries from within:</p><p>"Master Daoist!"</p><p>The two sisters stood side-by-side, their faces radiant.  Wang Shi, the elder sister, was reserved, while Wang Xiang's smile was unrestrained.</p><p>Before their astonished gazes, Qin Sang removed his cloak and smiled gently. "My surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang.  My identity as Daoist Qingfeng attracted powerful enemies, forcing me into hiding and putting you both at risk. I've come to apologize and am relieved to find you both unharmed."</p><p>"Yes, yes!" Wang Xiang patted her chest, still shaken. "We only learned later that the one pursuing you was the monstrous Lao Mo!  Even the Qiong Yu Trading Company fell to him. Luckily, we've had little contact with outsiders since our return, or the consequences would have been unthinkable. Master Daoist, how did you attract such a powerful demon?"</p><p>Wang Shi remained silent, a hint of melancholy in her eyes, before uttering unexpected words: "So, if this hadn't happened, Master Daoist wouldn't have come to see us?"</p><p>Wang Xiang's bright eyes darted between her sister and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang touched his nose, momentarily speechless.</p><p>Wang Shi, however, recovered her composure and invited Qin Sang inside.  As he entered, a flicker of disappointment crossed her eyes, followed by a sigh of relief, as if a burden had been lifted.</p>
