<h1>Chapter 2124: The Six Harmonious Decrees</h1><p>“My Lord Patriarch, the foul miasma is receding!”</p><p>The elder whispered, his heart pounding, unsure if this was the right moment.</p><p>Min Zhuo’s expression shifted slightly. He nodded. “You and the Tenth Elder immediately return to the Sacred Lake. Lead a contingent to the miasma-affected area, awaiting my command!”</p><p>“Yes, my Lord!”</p><p>The elder departed.</p><p>The cave closed again. Min Zhuo rose from his meditation cushion, gazing east, his face grave.</p><p>For him, the miasma’s retreat during the conflict was an ideal opportunity; the only drawback was the insufficient intensity of the battle.</p><p>How could he make that Qin Zhenren spread his forces thin?</p><p>Min Zhuo’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Regardless, he had to escape, go to the miasma-affected area personally, and retrieve the Da Yu Immortal Mountain!</p><p>He paced back and forth in the cave, pondering for a long time.  He returned to his cushion and waited patiently for several days. Upon learning that the assault party had returned, he left the cave and flew towards Lu Wang’s palanquin.</p><p>The army was arrayed before the palanquin, their morale somewhat low, suggesting the battle hadn’t yielded good results.</p><p>Scanning the ranks, Min Zhuo recognized some familiar faces—Chang You’s elite warriors—but many others were missing.</p><p>A year ago, Chang You’s elite were integrated into Lu Wang’s army, suffering heavy losses in the great war. The number of fallen experts was possibly higher than in the previous century combined. He himself had been in many battles and had been injured several times.  It was a necessary price; the Si You suffered even greater losses.</p><p>Entering the palanquin, Min Zhuo overheard a discussion of the battle. He quietly entered the main hall. Lu Wang and several Si You experts looked over and gave him a friendly nod.</p><p>In this assault on the Storm Realm, Min Zhuo had not only sent his clan to fight but also participated personally.  While his contribution might be small, Lu Wang and the others appreciated his efforts, increasing their favor towards him.</p><p>Min Zhuo stood silently, listening to Si Lan, a Si You expert, describe the battle. Learning that they’d found a way to counter the five-colored crown, he rejoiced inwardly.</p><p>Since the war began, they hadn't even left the desert, largely due to fear of the crown. Now that they had a countermeasure and were close to the Da Bei Buddhist Temple, a forceful attack might be possible when the time was right.</p><p>Min Zhuo saw an opportunity, but remained outwardly calm. He wouldn’t abruptly urge an attack; indirect suggestions would be better to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Si Lan finished recounting the battle, and everyone turned to the Grand Attendant.</p><p>How to counter the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm Technique was secondary; their primary concern was enhancing the power of the token to truly neutralize the crown.</p><p>The Grand Attendant fell into thought.  After a moment, everyone sensed a subtle fluctuation emanating from the Grand Attendant’s fingertips, indicating a solution was forming, being refined.</p><p>Lu Wang said softly, “Let’s not disturb the Grand Attendant. Everyone, come with me to the side hall.”</p><p>In the side hall, Lu Wang said, “Refining treasures isn’t quick. Meanwhile, please continue testing the enemy’s thunderstorm techniques. Clan Chief Min Zhuo…”</p><p>Min Zhuo stepped forward.</p><p>“The Da Bei Buddhist Temple was the leading sect in the Western Lands?” Lu Wang asked.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Min Zhuo nodded, his voice filled with hatred.  “The Western Lands are dominated by Buddhist sects, with the Da Bei Temple held in highest esteem.  Abbot Huai Yin is the foremost monk in the West; he’s slaughtered countless warriors of my clan!”</p><p>Lu Wang pondered. “Clan Chief Min Zhuo, do you think one of the three subsidiary altars might be hidden in the Da Bei Temple?”</p><p>Previously, Lu Wang had informed everyone of the Grand Attendant’s deduction regarding the thunder altars: one main and three subsidiary altars, with the main altar most likely located in the Central Plains or the East Sea, and the other three realms each having a subsidiary altar.</p><p>However, the enemy had hidden the subsidiary altars extremely well; they still hadn’t pinpointed their locations. Destroying even one subsidiary altar would be a major victory!</p><p>Hearing this, Min Zhuo’s heart stirred.  He feigned contemplation.  “There’s a considerable possibility. The Da Bei Temple initially faced destruction, only surviving thanks to the rescue by the Glass Fairy. Though a Buddhist sect, it has close ties to the Qingyang School.  It is rumored that Abbot Huai Yin and Qin Zhenren also have connections. There is no force in the Western Lands more trustworthy to Qin Zhenren than the Da Bei Temple!”</p><p>After a pause, Min Zhuo continued, “After several clashes, fellow daoists must have noticed that Qin Zhenren is cunning and skilled in deception. To ordinary people, placing an altar in the Da Bei Temple would seem unwise; but Qin Zhenren might do the opposite. This is merely my opinion; Lu Wang should consider carefully.”</p><p>Min Zhuo knew the time was right. He had planted the seed of doubt, and now, he bowed and withdrew.</p><p>Those present were all seasoned strategists.  His suggestions were plausible; any hasty, unfounded speculations would have raised suspicion.</p><p>As expected, someone nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Da Bei Temple holds such a high position; even if it's not a main altar, it certainly houses an important one.  Taking the temple is essential!"  Mo Shan Zhu declared firmly.</p><p>Lu Wang neither confirmed nor denied this. As usual, he outlined the battle plan and then dismissed everyone.</p><p>For nearly two months afterward, Lu Wang's forces repeatedly attacked. When they emerged from a torrential downpour, the Grand Minister finally broke his seclusion and presented a new token.</p><p>The token was similar in size and shape to the previous one, but its center now held a gemstone emitting a blue glow.</p><p>"I've named these tokens the 'Six Harmonies Tokens,' and the gemstone within, the 'Six Harmonies Gem.'  It's a rare treasure I unexpectedly obtained.  Integrating it into the tokens enhances their power.  Each of you should infuse a drop of your blood into a token and carefully refine it; the token will then recognize its master. During combat, combine the power of the Six Harmonies Tokens to restrict the crown!"</p><p>The Grand Minister spoke with confidence, waving his hand; tokens flew toward the assembled individuals.</p><p>Some immediately offered a drop of their blood to refine the tokens, while others cautiously observed before putting them away.</p><p>The Grand Minister surveyed the gathering. "The King and I have decided: Da Bei Temple is the foremost sect in the West.  Conquering it is of paramount significance and we must strive to achieve it!  Daoist Li..."</p><p>He turned to a side of the hall where a man sat on a high chair.  The man looked young but possessed a weathered, seasoned demeanor.  He sat there, unremarkable and easily overlooked.</p><p>Of course, no one in the hall overlooked him.</p><p>This man, Li Yue, had reached the mid-stage of the second level of the Void Realm. He wasn't under Lu Wang's command and was unaffiliated with any of the major factions. He was known for his discreet actions and low profile within the Si You tribe, but everyone still gave him considerable respect.</p><p>Initially, everyone was surprised that Lu Wang managed to enlist his services.</p><p>Li Yue had only participated in several key battles, and his performance lived up to his reputation.</p><p>"Grand Minister, what are your instructions?" Li Yue rose, his voice as calm as his bearing.</p><p>"This battle is crucial.  I ask that you lead the charge, Daoist Li! I will personally support you from the flanks," the Grand Minister said gravely.</p><p>The conflict had raged for over a year, with both sides using various tactics to uncover the other's strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>As Lu Wang's army pressed forward, aside from Qin Sang and Si Lu's spirit beasts, a sinister stone statue and a firebird spirit appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>Four cultivators at the Transcending Void Realm had been revealed.</p><p>With the army at the gates, if Qin Zhenren planned to defend Da Bei Temple, whatever hidden assets he had, it was time to reveal them.</p><p>Their greatest concern was Xia Changshi, whose whereabouts remained unknown.  The Grand Minister had been waiting for his appearance.</p><p>Li Yue nodded readily. "I will do my utmost!"</p><p>He then addressed the others. "I ask for the support of all fellow Daoists!"</p><p>With the commander appointed, the next step was the deployment of troops. The Grand Minister's sleeve released a burst of white light—a jade slip.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense, he revealed its contents in mid-air.</p><p>Everyone's gaze was drawn to it. They scrutinized the ethereal depiction of a formation.</p><p>"Thanks to your repeated ventures into the storm to scout, the King and I have deduced a method to break the enemy's formation: we will use a formation to counter a formation! Unless Qin Zhenren has other unforeseen tactics, with this formation, we have a better than 70% chance of success. However..."</p><p>The Grand Minister paused, ensuring everyone understood the formation before continuing. "This formation has a critical point, the eye, that requires a high-level cultivator to guard constantly. Once the formation is activated, this position will be exposed and thus a prime target. Is there anyone willing to volunteer?  I will bestow significant rewards!"</p><p>Silence fell within the carriage.</p><p>The Grand Minister's meaning was clear: if Xia Changshi remained hidden, any attack would likely target the formation's eye first.  While the formation battled the storm, others would be hard-pressed to protect it—making it the most dangerous position.</p><p>While rewards were enticing, personal safety was paramount.  No one wanted to fail at the last hurdle.</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>Disappointment washed over the Grand Minister. He was about to select a trusted subordinate when Min Zhuo stepped forward.</p><p>The Grand Elder rejoiced, "Min Zhuo, the clan leader, wishes to hold the central position?"</p><p>Min Zhuo replied, "Indeed! I will accept this task. The monks of Great Compassion Temple have stained their hands with the blood of my clan. I have sworn to slaughter every last one of them and raze all their temples to appease the spirits of my people!"</p><p>He bowed again, saying, "I was ordered to fully assist the King of Reeds, but his forces are brimming with experts. I haven't had the opportunity to contribute, which has been frustrating.  After this is done, I hope the Grand Elder will put in a good word for me to…the one above."</p><p>Even now, Min Zhuo didn't know the true identity of 'the one above,' only guessing their background from hints dropped by Zai Zhen.  But that didn't stop him from using 'the one above' to justify his actions.</p><p>With the foul energy receding, he needed to get out quickly.  Suffering a serious injury on the battlefield and retreating to the rear for treatment was the most legitimate excuse, the one least likely to raise suspicion.</p><p>However, these experts were all sharp-eyed.  Faking an injury wouldn't work; he needed an opportunity!</p><p>Now, the opportunity had arrived.</p><p>Min Zhuo believed the Eight Extremes Diagram wasn't that simple; even if it was countered, there was a way to escape.  He deliberately mentioned 'the one above' to increase his importance in the Grand Elder's eyes.</p><p>For Mount Taiyu, it was worth the gamble!</p><p>The Grand Elder indeed harbored no suspicion.</p><p>He didn't know that Min Zhuo had never directly interacted with 'the one above'. In his view, Min Zhuo's subservience and obedience were perfectly normal. The Changyou clan had already offended the Zhuyan clan; in this land, only 'the one above' could protect them. Min Zhuo had no other choice.</p><p>The others were unsure about the cryptic exchange between Min Zhuo and the Grand Elder.  Knowing it concerned some great secret, they pretended not to hear, avoiding potential trouble.</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>West of Great Compassion Temple.</p><p>Four figures hovered in the air.</p><p>Among them were Qin Sang and Si Lu's frost weasel, a black stone statue, and a fire bird.</p><p>The statue, a gift from Su Nu, was a kind of puppet that could be remotely controlled.  Called the Stone Demon General, it possessed considerable power.</p><p>The fire bird was a fragment of the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>They looked westward, seeing shadowy figures beyond the rain curtain. The battle array, like a cloud that blotted out the sun, advanced towards the rain.</p><p>It was impossible to count the number of soldiers the King of Reeds had deployed, nor the number of experts hidden within the array.  This was undoubtedly the largest offensive since the war began!</p><p>The enemy clearly intended to win at all costs.</p><p>"Brother Qin, your foresight was brilliant. The enemy is indeed launching a major assault," the statue's mouth moved, emitting Su Nu's clear and pleasant voice.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no pride; this was not difficult to guess.</p><p>The enemy had found a way to counter the Five Elements Divine Light and had arrived near Great Compassion Temple; a general attack was highly probable.</p><p>"Hehe…"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird fragment, eager for a fight, let out an excited cackle, "Unfortunately, they didn't expect you to cultivate both body and spirit, not only possessing a Dharma Image, but also a Dharma Body, and the power of your Dharma Body far surpasses your Dharma Image!"</p><p>Su Nu also laughed, "This time we will surely give them a big surprise.  I wonder if we can take out a few of them first!"</p><p>"Difficult!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "Killing companion beasts is easy; killing people is not!"</p><p>He gazed at the continuous mountains beyond the rain curtain.  Having sensed something was amiss earlier, he had switched the positions of his Dharma Body and Dharma Image, leaving the Dharma Image to guard the main altar and returning the Dharma Body.</p><p>Though seemingly the same body, they were already completely different.</p><p>The thunder rune was inscribed in the altar.  The Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunder Rain Great Technique was cast by the thunder altar, not Qin Sang himself. The Dharma Image could also activate it.</p><p>While the enemy was seeking ways to counter the Five Elements Divine Light, Qin Sang was trying to prevent their rescue, with some success.  But he felt this was not the full extent of the mysterious land's power.</p><p>This deployment of his Dharma Body, if all went well, might be the final test.</p><p>Great Compassion Temple held a special position in the western lands. Qin Sang knew the enemy would attack with all their might. Retreating outside the temple was to use this opportunity to his advantage!</p><p>The situation was developing as he had predicted, except for one unexpected event: the foul energy's retreat.</p><p>"The enemy is here!"</p><p>Si Lu, the most anxious of the four, pointed out the King of Reeds' vanguard entering the rain curtain.</p><p>Once the vanguard was fully inside the rain curtain, it would be their turn to act.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his lips, transmitting instructions, then his figure flickered and he vanished into the depths of the storm. The other three figures followed suit.</p>
