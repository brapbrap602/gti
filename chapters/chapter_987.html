<h1>Chapter 979: Elder Zou Lives</h1><p>Chapter 979: Elder Zou Lives</p><p>Qiong Yu Trading Company.</p><p>Private Room.</p><p>The manager surnamed Liu looked gloomy and restless. He paced back and forth in the room, occasionally glancing outside, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Daybreak arrived.</p><p>Seeing a figure approaching in the distance, Manager Liu's expression changed slightly.  He quickly put on a smiling face, hurried downstairs, and greeted the newcomer warmly.</p><p>"Master Daoist, please come in!"</p><p>Manager Liu was very friendly, leading Qin Sang into the private room.</p><p>He was about to pour tea when Qin Sang stopped him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>"Manager Liu, how is the preparation of the spirit herbs coming along?"</p><p>Qin Sang got straight to the point, intending to buy the herbs and leave. He was now proficient in controlling the six demonic banners and didn't want to waste time.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Manager Liu froze, holding the teacup high, a look of difficulty on his face, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and said in a low voice, "Manager Liu, is there a problem?"</p><p>Manager Liu sighed softly and put down the tea set, saying, "To be honest, Master Daoist, I thought that by buying some from other trading companies and adding to our warehouse stock, I could gather most of the herbs you require. Unexpectedly, because the herbs you need are quite rare, the stock of several trading companies on the island is very low. To avoid delaying your important matters, I immediately sent a message to Ying Huan Island to have them urgently dispatch the herbs. It's estimated that it will take a few more days…"</p><p>"Ying Huan Island?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that Ying Huan Island was an island southwest of Dayu Island, not too far away, only a few days' journey.</p><p>"That's right," Manager Liu nodded. "Master Daoist may not know, after the demonic disturbance, the trading company has undergone several changes, and it only recently stabilized. I am merely a small manager stationed in Dayu Island. The one who truly manages the East Sea branch is the Deputy Envoy. Ying Huan Island is highly valued by the Deputy Envoy, who has sent a trusted person to manage it. They should be able to gather the herbs you need…"</p><p>Since joining the Qiong Yu Trading Company, Qin Sang had been following Elder Zou in the Demon Sea and knew little about the members in the inner sea.  He couldn't recall who the Deputy Envoy was.</p><p>However, anyone who could hold the position of Deputy Envoy in the Qiong Yu Trading Company was not simple. There weren't many such positions in the entire company. Before leaving for the Demon Sea, Elder Zou himself had been a Deputy Envoy.</p><p>"Manager Liu, how many spirit herbs have you gathered?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p>"Less than thirty percent."</p><p>Manager Liu said apologetically.</p><p>"Thirty percent… indeed a little less…"</p><p>Tapping his fingers on the table, Qin Sang thought for a moment and said, "I have urgent business to attend to and cannot wait too long. Let's do this: please send another message to Ying Huan Island, instructing them to go directly north and deliver the herbs to Dong Jia Island. I will be traveling west and will pass by Dong Jia Island. We can meet there, and it will save us both time."</p><p>Dong Jia Island was located northwest of Dayu Island, directly north of Ying Huan Island.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Sect was to his northwest, and going there would conveniently take him through Dong Jia Island, thus saving much time.</p><p>Manager Liu was startled. He hadn't expected Qin Sang to say this, his brow furrowed, and a hesitant look appeared on his face.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, his mind clear, and said calmly, "Manager Liu, rest assured, no matter where the transaction takes place, this deal will be made with you, not Ying Huan Island."</p><p>Manager Liu chuckled, echoing, "Master Daoist's plan is excellent, but…"</p><p>Manager Liu paused slightly, his voice tinged with delight, "I almost forgot, three days ago, Master Daoist asked me to inquire about Elder Zou. When I was sending the message to Ying Huan Island, I mentioned it.  It's a coincidence, they just received news that Elder Zou is safe and sound, and not far from here. It seems he had great gains at the Seven Kills Hall and has been in seclusion, only recently emerging.  Elder Zou originally intended to return to Tianxing Island, but upon learning that you are in Dayu Island, he immediately changed his mind and decided to visit you, showing how much he values you. If you leave early, you might miss…"</p><p>Manager Liu spoke eloquently and confidently.</p><p>He didn't notice that the other person's demeanor had changed.</p><p>The moment Manager Liu mentioned Elder Zou, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. His body tensed, he stared intently at Manager Liu, a dangerous glint in his eyes, and felt an extreme sense of alert.</p><p>Elder Zou was dead, his body cremated by his own hands.  </p><p>This was undeniable!</p><p>Yet this man was adamant that Elder Zou was alive and would come to see him.</p><p>Could Elder Zou have been resurrected? Was his experience at the Flower Fairy Lake an illusion, a dream?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>Manager Liu was clearly up to no good, but Qin Sang couldn't figure out the problem.  They had no grievances, just a simple herb purchase. If all the members of the Qiong Yu Trading Company were people who would turn on their colleagues for profit, the company would have collapsed long ago.</p><p>"Heh heh…"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "I wonder where Old Man Zou is now?  Since he's coming, I can wait a few days…"</p><p>He outwardly remained calm, secretly clenching the magic banner in his palm. He awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly, activating its divine ability to quickly scan the room.  No hidden personnel were detected.</p><p>The Liu family steward was overjoyed at the news, repeatedly saying, "Old Man Zou has probably already left Camp Ring Island and is on his way, Daoist Master…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Qin Sang suddenly attacked.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Sword light tore through his cloak, instantly illuminating the entire room.</p><p>The two men were seated opposite each other, very close.</p><p>The Liu family steward was shocked. He hadn't expected Qin Sang to attack so unexpectedly.</p><p>His reaction was swift. He pressed his palm downward, activating the room's protective barrier.  A curtain of countless runes descended from the ceiling, rapidly pressing towards the ebony sword.</p><p>Simultaneously, thick vines surged around Qin Sang, writhing like pythons, instantly forming a vine cage.</p><p>The vines coiled and squeezed inward.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng, I have no grievance with you…"</p><p>The Liu family steward, still feigning surprise, anger, and confusion—a perfect act—shouted his question at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, remaining silent.  With a thought, he tapped the ebony sword.</p><p>The Liu family steward had hastily activated the room's barrier, but its flaws were exposed under the Sky-Eye divine ability.</p><p>The ebony sword flashed, its sword light exploding, instantly splitting into countless sword energies and lights, transforming into a dazzling sword wheel.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The sword wheel and the rune curtain collided violently. A piercing 'shriek' echoed, and a shocking sight unfolded: the ebony sword pierced through the barrier and slashed down, witnessed by the horrified Liu family steward.</p><p>The Liu family steward cried out, retreating towards the door. He quickly summoned his life-saving treasure—a square mirror—striking it out forcefully to try to block the sword wheel.</p><p>At that moment, a ripping sound came from within the vine cage.</p><p>A black demonic fire burst from the cage, surging out with a terrifying aura. It shot towards the doorway, cutting off the Liu family steward's escape route.</p>
