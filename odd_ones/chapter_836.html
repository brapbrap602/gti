  Chapter 836 - Spacetime Amber
 </h1>
 <div class="chapter-c" id="calibre_link-2223">
  <p class="calibre5">
   Some of the universal social studies scholars believed that there were
          three factors of building a lawful galactic society from nothing.
          First, communication in the form of a galactic war where part of the
          civilizations survived and obtained knowledge of each other. Second,
          one or more powerful rulers that had the strength to forcefully decide
          rules for other civilizations, forming laws. Third, the reduction of
          distance achieved through hyperdrive, stargate, and quantum
          communication technology.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In the eyes of some scholars, these three technologies were the
          greatest inventions of the universe era. They allowed civilizations to
          communicate with each other while being countless light years apart.
          These were what formed the stable galactic societal structure of the
          entire known universe.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After pioneering in the Flickering World for four months, including
          Han Xiao, the Black Star Army started to agree more and more with this
          statement.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Special Task Force led by Hadavy took four whole months to arrive
          at the east of the Garu Star Cluster from the south, while Han Xiao’s
          main ship fleet crossed that distance through the stargates built by
          the Special Task Force in less than two days.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the eastern border Star System, two fleets rendezvoused in space.
          The Special Task Force spaceships returned to the main ship.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao waited for a while in the command room, and very soon, Hadavy
          and his subordinates came from the dock.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Army Commander!” Hadavy opened his arms wide and pounced over with
          excitement on his face.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao’s mouth twitched. He hesitated for a moment but decided not
          to back away and gave Hadavy a hug.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “It’s been four whole months,” Hadavy said with an overjoyed tone.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Do you have to be so excited?” Feeling Hadavy’s arms tightly wrapped
          around his waist, Han Xiao casually patted his shoulder and dragged
          him off with one hand.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   What he did not know was that these four months had been extremely
          tough for Hadavy. His Harden Esper Ability could only be improved
          through powerful external stimulation. As a Beyond Grade A seed, he
          had become Han Xiao’s subordinate for the opportunity to spar with a
          Beyond Grade A. After he came under Han Xiao’s command, he had felt
          his Esper Ability grow again after being stagnant for an exceptionally
          long time. This made him overjoyed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, the sign of becoming stronger disappeared once again in these
          four months away. Furthermore, there was not even a Calamity Grade
          officer in the Special Task Force, so he could not even find a
          sparring opponent. To a battle maniac like him, this was unbearable.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   When he saw Han Xiao again, in Hadavy’s eyes, it was as if a halo was
          hovering above Han Xiao’s head. He realized just how much he missed
          Han Xiao… ‘s fists.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hadavy was in a particularly good mood. He looked at Hila, who was
          beside them, grinned, and opened his arms, attempting to give her a
          hug too.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Try touching me.” Death energy appeared in Hila’s eyes as she glared
          at Hadavy.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hadavy’s expression became stiff, and he awkwardly lowered his arms,
          thinking, There’s no way I, a Beyond Grade A seed, would treat you
          this kindly if not for the army commander.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Come on, Hadavy is at least a Beyond Grade A seed. Don’t be so harsh
          with your words.” Han Xiao, however, was the one who felt that Hila’s
          attitude toward a member of the Black Star Guards needed improvement.
          He patted her shoulder and pressed her shoulder bone.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hmm, quite nice.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hila’s expression tensed up. She glanced at Han Xiao’s palm, and the
          overflowing red energy in her eyes vanished.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Okay,” she said reluctantly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hadavy greeted Feidin and the other Black Star Guards. He then looked
          at Han Xiao and asked, “Following your orders, the Special Task Force
          has already set up the long distance stargates—what do we do next?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao did not reply directly but snapped his fingers and summoned
          the 3D star map in front of everyone. He carefully searched through
          the star map and finally confirmed the planet with the ownerless
          Universal Treasure that was in the desolate universe belt outside the
          Garu Star Cluster.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In his previous life, this planet was called Planet Amber. Now, it was
          still a planet with just a serial number and no name.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Are we going to this planet?” Aurora asked curiously. “Is there
          anything special about it?”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao nodded and randomly made up some reasons. “Some time ago,
          when a group of army members were exploring desolate planets, they
          discovered some information left by aliens. It seemed to be the
          travelling records of a certain explorer, and it had information about
          this planet, which stated that there was a civilization on it. Since
          we’re here, we shall go and take a look.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This reason was completely logical. Since Han Xiao was the one who
          said it, despite the others being somewhat puzzled, they had no
          doubts. After all, given what had happened with the Great Cosmos
          Corps, the existence of natives in the Flickering World was no longer
          shocking to them.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao did not exactly lie—Planet Amber was indeed the ruins of an
          extinct native civilization, and that Universal Treasure was in those
          ruins.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   [Spacetime Amber] was the name of this Universal Treasure. It was not
          built by this native civilization but an extraterrestrial object that
          landed on the planet accidentally. This civilization had once viewed
          it as their holy relic.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In his previous life, as the dynasty’s allies steadily developed
          forward, the Spacetime Amber ended up in the hands of one of the
          dynasty’s allies who took part in the exploration. That person was
          Ravenlaude, one of the Beyond Grade As whom Han Xiao had met on the
          Crimson Dynasty’s mother planet, the member of the Ancient Ones who
          had a bad relationship with Aesop.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After that, Ravenlaude was defeated by another Beyond Grade A in the
          Calamity of the Supers version, and the Spacetime Amber was taken
          away. After many incidents, the owner of the Spacetime Amber changed
          many times, one of them even being someone from the World Tree
          Civilization. In the end, it landed in the hands of the Federation of
          Light.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The origin of the Spacetime Amber was very mysterious. The players in
          his previous life only found out about its origin at the late stages
          through special intelligence channels. It was not some shocking secret
          but involved the Primordial Ones and had a story to it.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As for the effects of the Spacetime Amber, only one word could
          describe it—’unique’.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It basically would not increase one’s strength at all, but its
          effects… were terrifying even for Beyond Grade As!
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   According to Han Xiao’s memories of the storyline in his previous
          life, after the Spacetime Amber was discovered, more than five Beyond
          Grade As were ‘defeated’ by it!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Since this thing had no owner, other than him, no one else even knew
          about the existence of the Spacetime Amber. He would be able to obtain
          it easily.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A few days later, the fleet arrived at Planet Amber and entered its
          atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Fixed Star was relatively close to this planet, and the burning
          sun shone from the sky. The surface of Planet Amber was mainly desert
          with everlasting dull gray sandstorms roaming across the land. No
          signs of any civilizations could be seen.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was just about to send out detection ships when Aurora closed
          her eyes for a moment and shook her head.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “There are no vital signs on this planet.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Your vital sign detection range can now cover an entire planet?”
          Shock flashed across Hila’s face.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Seeing that everyone was looking, Aurora gave a shy smile but said
          with somewhat a proud tone, “I’ve grown too.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Not bad, not bad.” Han Xiao smiled with satisfaction.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Every time Aurora became stronger, he would always be quite happy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After all, this meant that Aurora’s healing power had become stronger.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Aurora Character Summon Card’s effect was full recovery, but that
          came from the interface, and Aurora’s healing power was limited. The
          cost of her ability was her own life force. With the astronomical
          amount of energy in his cells as a Beyond Grade A, Aurora would most
          likely be drained just from fully healing him one or two times.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Since there are no vital signs, the civilization you mentioned might
          have gone extinct, only leaving ruins,” Feidin said.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao nodded. He looked at the yellow desert and sent out detection
          ships to collect information of the planet’s underground environment.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In the dynasty’s records, the civilization ruins that the Spacetime
          Amber was in were buried under the sand. As for the details of
          discovering the Spacetime Amber, there were no records. Therefore, he
          did not know its exact location. However, with the galactic grade
          detection devices he had, finding the civilization’s ruins was just a
          matter of time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As expected, before Han Xiao finished spectating a match of Wayne Card
          between Hadavy and another Black Star Guard, he received a message
          from the detection ships—many city-like ruins had been discovered
          under the desert.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, no special energy source was detected.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   No abnormal energy signal detected? Hmm, the Spacetime Amber should be
          on this planet. Maybe it’s because it hasn’t been charged for a very
          long time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao looked at the ruins marked on the planet map and shook his
          head with resignation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Looks like I have to search all of them… Tsk, why didn’t the dynasty
          record the details of discovering the Spacetime Amber? Now I have to
          spend time searching for it slowly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao told the fleet to standby outside the atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Looking down at the ground under his feet, Han Xiao waved his hand. An
          enormous mass of Mechanical Force gushed out, stirring up energy
          ripples. A gigantic light gate opened behind him, and inside were
          countless mechanical soldiers. This was the secondary dimensional army
          base that he had with him at all times.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Clank!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Countless mechanical soldiers swarmed out, with Psionic Prime and the
          thousands of mechanical lives at the front. They all looked at Han
          Xiao.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After releasing millions of machines, Han Xiao then closed the
          secondary dimensional army base. The mechanical army aligned neatly in
          front of him, covering the sky.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “You guys, search through the ruins, report any special discovery to
          me, and also look for this thing.” Han Xiao drew out the appearance of
          the Spacetime Amber in the quantum network and sent out this order to
          all the machines through Phillip.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hu!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, the mechanical army before him split up and dug into
          the desert to explore the ruins.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   With so many helpful machinery assistants, Han Xiao did not want to
          waste time personally searching through so many ruins.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Master, we’ve discovered something special.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Not long after, Psionic Prime sent back some good news together with
          images.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao glanced at it. On the image was a huge room like some sort of
          a hall. The walls and the pillars were covered in drawings. In the
          middle of the room was a gigantic black disc with circuit-like
          patterns on it. It might be a product of mixing magic and technology.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   On the ground around the disc, there were many translucent spherical
          crystals, each about 1.5 meters tall with creatures of a certain
          species in them. Their bodies had no signs of rotting, but their
          expressions and movements were all completely still. They had no vital
          signs, like beings solidified by amber.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This phenomenon is the effect of the Spacetime Amber…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was surprised. He had visited Planet Amber in his previous
          life, but there were only ruins at that time, and these amber
          creatures were not there. These creatures must be the race that had
          once lived there.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Maybe when Ravenlaude discovered the Spacetime Amber, he took away
          those specimens.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, this was good news. It meant that he was near the Spacetime
          Amber.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao called the fleet down. The spaceships used their traction
          beams and sucked this area of the desert dry, exposing the ruins where
          Psionic Prime was.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The group of them quickly descended and landed in the ruins, following
          Psionic Prime’s signal deep into the heart of the ruins while
          observing the city on the way.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although the ruins seemed to be ancient, the original look of this
          civilization could still somewhat be seen.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The patterns could still display their sense of beauty. This
          civilization seemed to be quite good at art.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “They must’ve been quite a beautiful civilization,” Feidin said.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Maybe.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao did not deny it. Very soon, they came to the center of the
          ruins. This was an enormous fortress, like it was a gigantic safehouse
          or sanctuary assembled from tons of tough materials.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Psionic Prime’s team was in this fortress. Han Xiao and the others
          entered the hall in the image very soon. With a rough look, they
          realized that there were at least twenty thousand ambers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “What are these? It looks like amber.” Hadavy touched a piece of amber
          beside him with curiosity. The texture was very strange. He could not
          feel any temperature on the amber, but his hand could not move an inch
          further.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao causally came before a piece of amber and looked at the
          creature inside it. These creatures should be carbon-based mammals.
          They looked hairy and somewhat similar to sloths. It was about one
          meter tall, its eyes were wide open, and it had this constant anxious
          and uneasy expression on its face.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao turned around and glanced at Hila. He then signaled with his
          lips and said, “Try attacking it.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Swoosh!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Without hesitation, a wave of energy gushed out from Hila’s eyes and
          landed on one piece of amber.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, something strange happened. Although the amber was
          blown away, it was completely undamaged. The energy Hila released
          dissipated on the smooth surface of the amber completely.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Hmm?” Hila frowned. Unconvinced, energy concentrated once again as
          she planned to launch a much more powerful attack.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Seeing this, Han Xiao hastily stopped her. “Enough, you don’t have to
          try again, or you’re going to destroy this entire room.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hila had no choice but to stop then wondered, “This thing is immune to
          my attacks. Even my spiritual attack could not penetrate it.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Not just that.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao pressed on one piece of amber, and Mechanical Force gushed
          out from his palm. However, the lightning only swam on the surface of
          the amber; the amber itself was not damaged at all.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “More accurately, this thing should be immune to all kinds of energy.
          It can’t be destroyed or damaged.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao raised one piece of amber up and weighed it; it was not
          heavy. He put it down, shook his head, and said, “Beyond Grade As, or
          even the strongest Planetary Obliteration weapons of universal
          civilizations, can’t damage this amber.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Everyone was shocked.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “How can there be such powerful material in the world?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Even Beyond Grade As can’t destroy it? Impossible!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Could it be…” Hila had a flash of insight. “Is this another Space
          Wonder?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao caressed his chin and pretended to be thinking. “Hmm,
          possibly. It feels like the Evolution Cube, like a manmade product.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He was not very clear on how this kind of amber formed, but Space
          Wonders were always difficult to explain. According to the data in his
          previous life, this amber seemed to have solidified the time and space
          of a small area.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Objects inside the amber would be isolated from reality, as if
          existing in another dimension that had no factor of time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   According to that logic, the bodies of beings covered in this amber
          should not change; they should have a long or even infinite life span,
          like sleeping in a capsule, and their mind should be frozen as well…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, according to the NPCs who fought against it in his previous
          life, when they were trapped by the Spacetime Amber, they were indeed
          unable to control their bodies, and their energy could not escape it
          as well, but their mind was active. They could even see and hear what
          was happening outside the amber. They could even feel the passage of
          time in the outside world. It was like their minds were trapped in
          their bodies. This was what contradicted the logic and one of the
          important reasons this was one of the Space Wonders.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Only the minds of individuals trapped too long by the Spacetime Amber
          would enter stagnation and vanish in the end, giving up on maintaining
          thoughts. Stronger individuals would be able to last longer.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Therefore, this thing could create a cell that could trap any beings
          and not worry about the prisoner running away, while at the same time
          being a terrible torture.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Even if the target was a Beyond Grade A!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The only problem was that the process of activating the Spacetime
          Amber was quite long. It would be extremely difficult to trap a Beyond
          Grade A with it.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If this falls into the hands of an enemy, it’s very threatening to me.
          I will have one less thing to worry about if it’s in my hands.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   All kinds of thoughts flashed past Han Xiao’s mind. He turned around
          and looked at the roughly ten-meter-wide black disc in the middle of
          the room. He observed the patterns on the disc for a while and roughly
          confirmed that this was some kind of pattern to transmit energy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Looks like this thing needs energy to be activated.”
  </p>

   Han Xiao waved. Psionic Prime obediently turned into many hovering
          guards and shot out beams at the disc, transferring energy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hum!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The disc suddenly shivered. As if some kind of device had been
          activated, the patterns lit up, and the dust on it fell off.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, this disc lit up entirely and displayed its real
          function… it was a screen.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A video started playing on the screen. A creature of this civilization
          appeared and slowly spoke.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the time, their translators had yet to record this language, so
          they had no idea what it was saying. However, this did not prevent
          them from understanding the images. The images of this civilization
          before it went extinct appeared on the screen, as if it was displaying
          its entire history from the beginning. They started as primal beings,
          gradually learned to use tools. They invented airplanes and hovering
          cars, and they were trying to build galactic spaceships. The cities
          were beautiful, and the people were living peacefully.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, due to the abnormal activity of their Fixed Star, the
          environment of this planet changed drastically. A disaster that was
          more than enough to wipe out all lives on the planet occurred. In
          order to preserve their civilization, they used their ‘holy relic’ to
          seal their people and saved all the information of their civilization
          in the database. There were databases in every ruin to make sure
          whoever discovered this would receive this information.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The appearance of that ‘holy relic’ was indeed the Spacetime Amber in
          Han Xiao’s memories. Realizing that he had come to the right place,
          Han Xiao was secretly relieved and continued watching.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A large amount of energy was needed in order to use the Spacetime
          Amber. This civilization had almost depleted all their energy sources
          just to charge it so that they could use it multiple times. There were
          ambers not just in this city’s ruins but in every ruin. While they
          were watching this recording, the teams that were exploring the other
          ruins discovered more and more amber as well.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the end of the recording, the whereabouts of the Spacetime Amber
          was finally mentioned. It seemed to be placed in a huge city, but that
          was before the civilization went extinct, so they did not know which
          ruin it was.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   I’ll have Phillip copy their database first. If their language is
          deciphered, I will be able to understand what this recording was
          talking about and find the ruins the Spacetime Amber is at.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was just about to act when a notification popped up on the
          interface.
