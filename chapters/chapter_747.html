<h1>Chapter 739: A Fork in the Path of Cultivation</h1><p>One month later.</p><p>A soft gasp echoed from within the cave. Qin Sang awoke from his meditative trance, gazing with delight at his dantian.</p><p>His hard work had paid off. After a month of secluded cultivation, his cultivation base had finally stabilized, allowing him to proceed to the next stage.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's expression turned solemn.  The viability of the cultivation method created by Senior Qingzhu was about to be tested.</p><p>He didn't rush into meditation. After careful preparations, he summoned his two spirit insects.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly looked quite different from before, while the Fat Silkworm remained slumbering within its cocoon.</p><p>After devouring the lightning on Red Leaf Island, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had slept for five years before awakening. Many spirit insects didn't slumber for so long during their fourth transformation.</p><p>Upon awakening, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, as hoped, gained the ability to control lightning.</p><p>Its appearance had also changed, especially its wings.  Lightning seemed to flicker within them, and with each flap, electric sparks would flash. The two large eye-like patterns on its wings were now even more vibrant and captivating, almost as if they were about to come alive!</p><p>It had transformed into a Sky-Eyed Lightning Butterfly!</p><p>However, its newfound ability to control lightning wasn't as potent as its innate abilities.</p><p>Spirit insects typically possessed a single, powerful ability that often surpassed their cultivation level.  Some rare and extraordinary insects could even exceed their level by a significant margin.</p><p>For example, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's concealment ability was undetectable even to Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly could now manipulate lightning to attack and could also perform Lightning Evasion. Although both were powerful, they weren't beyond its current cultivation level.  These abilities simply enhanced its combat prowess.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was currently in the late stage of its second transformation. Previously, it would have only been able to flee from a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, but now it could put up a fight.</p><p>This delighted Qin Sang. With the Sky-Eyed Butterfly capable of defending itself, he wouldn't have to be so cautious when deploying it.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang was confident in the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's future.</p><p>The ability to control lightning was rare, even among cultivators. Only those from powerful sects with rich heritages might possess such techniques. Lightning was the most yang and unyielding force in the world, coveted by countless individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Three Disasters Heart-Devouring Formation he encountered while stealing the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid from the Yuanzhao Sect's forbidden grounds.</p><p>The formation simulated the Nascent Soul tribulation.</p><p>It was said that the Nascent Soul tribulation encompassed not only lightning, but also fire and wind, making it incredibly perilous.  Countless cultivators perished during this tribulation.</p><p>As his life-bound insect, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could assist him in overcoming the tribulation.  Its lightning control would undoubtedly prove invaluable.</p><p>Of course, it was too early to contemplate such matters. He hadn't even reached the Nascent Soul stage, yet he was already thinking about the tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.</p><p>The only downside was that, despite slumbering for five years, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's cultivation hadn't progressed at all.  The white mist and lightning it devoured seemed to have been entirely consumed during its transformation.</p><p>Originally, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had a chance to reach its third transformation before the Seven Killing Halls opened. Due to the transformation, it had lost too much time.  Reaching the peak of the second transformation and breaking through to the third within the next five years was almost impossible.</p><p>He likely wouldn't be able to rely on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's power within the Seven Killing Halls.</p><p>Perhaps this was the price of gain.</p><p>Qin Sang fed the Sky-Eyed Butterfly some medicinal pills, then turned his attention to the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's transformation had been surprisingly smooth.  Qin Sang had only tentatively fed it a few drops of Redfire Liquid Gold, and it had immediately begun to spin a cocoon and enter its transformation.</p><p>While the Redfire Liquid Gold was undoubtedly effective, it was also possible that feeding it the Venomous Beast's core at the mid-stage of its second transformation contributed to this.  It had absorbed several such cores over the years.</p><p>Throughout its second transformation, the Fat Silkworm had consumed nothing less than the cores of peak Spirit Demon beasts.  His other spirit insects didn't have such fortunate opportunities.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had slumbered for over half a year during its second transformation.  This time, it hadn't disappointed Qin Sang either. It had entered its slumber three years ago and showed no signs of awakening.</p><p>"Five years should be enough. I haven't heard of any spirit insect slumbering for so long during its third transformation. The Fat Silkworm can dispel poisons, and after its third transformation, it'll gain new abilities.  Those secret realms and ancient halls are filled with miasma. Within the Seven Killing Halls, the Fat Silkworm should be more useful than the Sky-Eyed Butterfly."</p><p>Qin Sang gently touched the shimmering cocoon, sensing the Fat Silkworm's aura, then stored both spirit insects.</p><p>"I can begin my attempt. Before cultivating, I need to comprehend the method..."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and calmed his mind.</p><p>The two Killing Talismans left by Senior Qingzhu appeared in his mind.  Previously, they had seemed obscure and difficult to understand.  After his breakthrough, he could finally see through the fog and begin to grasp their meaning.</p><p>Silence reigned within the cave as Qin Sang sat motionless, like a pine tree.</p><p>Time passed, and who knew how long it had been.</p><p>Qin Sang was immersed in the world of the cultivation method, completely engrossed. He was at times captivated, at times awestruck by Senior Qingzhu's genius.  He had actually forged his own path based on the original method!</p><p>Compared to the "Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter," Senior Qingzhu's method was more obscure and narrow, lacking the grandeur and directness of the original, which pointed straight to the Great Dao.</p><p>This was because the creation of the method was limited by Senior Qingzhu's knowledge and experience.</p><p>This was unavoidable.</p><p>The creator of the "Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter" must have been a supremely powerful senior with an understanding of the Dao's end.  They could simplify complexity while encompassing all things, distilling the true meaning of the Killing Dao.</p><p>Every cultivator of this method could find their own suitable path.</p><p>Compared to that senior, Senior Qingzhu was like a firefly to the moon, yet he could continue the method at the Core Formation stage, even if he only grasped a part of its essence.</p><p>The word 'genius' was insufficient to describe him.</p><p>The deeper he delved into his comprehension, the more Qin Sang admired and yearned for Senior Qingzhu, hoping to witness his brilliance firsthand.</p><p>But then he felt a pang of sadness.  Senior Qingzhu had vanished without a trace, and despite years of searching, no information about him could be found.  He didn't know if he was still alive.</p><p>He quickly regained his composure and dispelled his distracting thoughts, resolving to cultivate this method.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang had gained many insights and realized that the method was feasible. Under the Jade Buddha's protection, he could follow Senior Qingzhu's path.</p><p>He also understood that the method did indeed have flaws.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, cultivating the "Soul Nurturing Sword Chapter" would grant new abilities, perhaps a second sword ray or something else.</p><p>But Senior Qingzhu's method wouldn't.  It would only allow cultivators to barely continue on their path, stumbling along without the energy to focus on other things.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected there were other differences, only discoverable through actual cultivation.</p><p>After briefly awakening, Qin Sang consumed a medicinal pill and adjusted his state of mind, achieving a state of tranquility. Only then did he carefully guard his mind and look inward at his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Within the depths of the cave, Qin Sang's aura fluctuated erratically, but it was concealed by the restrictive formation, preventing any disturbances.</p>
