<h1>Chapter 1337: The Artifact of Memory</h1><p>Chapter 1337: The Artifact of Memory</p><p>The Solar God Tree.</p><p>This is the name Qin Sang gave his new artifact.</p><p>Its shape is inspired by an artifact from his past life—a bronze god tree.  He had the privilege of observing this divine tree once, and the impact it had on him remains vivid.</p><p>When considering the artifact's form, Qin Sang decided to emulate the bronze god tree, a kind of homage.</p><p>On a base crafted from the shell of a Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, three roots support the main body of the god tree.</p><p>The trunk is straight, with branches arranged in three tiers, each tier branching into three, for a total of nine branches.</p><p>All branches gently droop, adorned with flickering runes that resemble ancient embellishments.</p><p>However, these are not the focal points.</p><p>Most striking are the small, slightly upward-curving twigs extending from each branch, supporting a small disc, which in turn cradles a bud.</p><p>Qin Sang envisions that after subduing the Vermilion Bird feather, the South Ming Flame will be channeled into the white bronze tree body, ultimately condensing into nine proud, elegant birds within these buds!</p><p>This way, he can utilize the artifact to control the South Ming Flame, rather than simply using it as a container for the Vermilion Bird feather.</p><p>The first step is now complete.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird feather has been drawn into the base forged from the Xuan Turtle shell.</p><p>Deprived of its source, the South Ming Flame is no longer a match for the Golden Thread Restriction. The flames rapidly weaken, suppressed by the intense golden light, with most of the South Ming Flame flowing into the Solar God Tree along with its core.</p><p>The entire chamber is now revealed.</p><p>In the center of the chamber sits a circular stone platform, hollow in the middle, its surface etched with dense Golden Thread Restrictions, and glowing red within.</p><p>The remaining flames have retracted, becoming a small, gently flickering fire, remarkably subdued.</p><p>They are now rootless flames, destined to gradually dissipate.</p><p>As expected, this place was once an alchemy chamber.</p><p>The chamber is there, but the alchemy furnace is not.</p><p>There are also no channels for earth fire, indicating that the ancient cultivators used the South Ming Flame for their alchemy.</p><p>Qin Sang, unable to spare any attention to his surroundings, sits cross-legged, eyes closed.</p><p>The Solar God Tree slowly rotates before him.</p><p>At the base of the Solar God Tree,</p><p>after the Vermilion Bird feather is pulled into the Xuan Water space, the Xuan Water power contained within the Xuan Turtle shell surges forth.</p><p>The Xuan Turtle shell comes from a Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle in its transformation stage.  While not of the same level as the Vermilion Bird, the Xuan Water power does have a certain restraining effect on flames, and can integrate with the energy of the green bronze piece.</p><p>Of course, the majority of the credit goes to the green bronze piece.</p><p>Qin Sang focuses all his attention, fully activating the artifact. The green bronze piece materializes in the Xuan Water space, its green light intensifying. The Vermilion Bird feather trembles slightly, attempting to escape its natural enemy.</p><p>However, escape is no longer possible. The green bronze piece slowly descends onto the Vermilion Bird feather, subduing it. The two artifacts cling tightly together.</p><p>Subduing the feather's core is half the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang dares not relax, immediately shifting his attention to the god tree.</p><p>Under his guidance, the South Ming Flame flows into the tree's body.  The white bronze god tree immediately turns 'red,' its state highly unstable.  It glows intensely red, with a glaze-like sheen on its surface, seemingly flowing, raising concerns that it might melt.</p><p>This is another major hurdle. Until this moment, Qin Sang had no certainty.</p><p>The mysterious white bronze has an unusual origin, with no relevant records in extant texts; no one knows if its material can withstand the power of the South Ming Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang can only do his best, utilizing all his knowledge and incorporating various precious spiritual materials to shape the tree body.</p><p>The rest is up to fate.</p><p>Qin Sang is tense, watching every change in the god tree.</p><p>The flames flow slowly over the tree’s surface, making the body translucent, allowing the inner flow of flames to be seen. Although the surface appears calm, Qin Sang knows the true nature of its raging power.</p><p>The South Ming Flame’s impact and destruction of the tree are expected by Qin Sang.</p><p>The runes on the surface flicker and fade in patches. Qin Sang is exceptionally busy, desperately trying to repair the runes but still struggling.</p><p>The situation seems extremely perilous, with the god tree shaking violently.</p><p>Yet, the joy on Qin Sang's face grows stronger.</p><p>Against all odds, the body of the god tree, forged from the mysterious white bronze, does not collapse; it perseveres.  Indeed, in this process, the god tree's core has become even more refined.</p><p>Simultaneously, the flame energy gathers in the centers of the nine buds on the god tree.</p><p>These flames surge and writhe, gradually coalescing over time into a ball of red fire, and the god tree's shaking gradually stops.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, a gleam in them.</p><p>The crimson divine tree, its surface seemingly perpetually wreathed in ethereal flames, gently swayed, scattering cascades of fiery red tassels—a breathtaking sight.</p><p>The fireballs in the heart of the blossoms were even more dazzling, like nine miniature suns.</p><p>It resembled the legendary Fusang tree, he thought.</p><p>After a thorough examination, Qin Sang was satisfied.  This magical artifact was of his own design and creation, a remarkable feat in this era.</p><p>Despite many setbacks, he had finally succeeded.</p><p>He cautiously extended his spiritual sense into the Sun God Tree, attempting to manipulate the fireballs in the blossoms.  The tree shuddered, the Nanming Li Fire showing signs of violent instability.</p><p>If the fireballs collapsed and the balance was broken, all his previous efforts would be wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he quickly withdrew.</p><p>His gaze fell upon the nine blossoms.  The fireballs, once formed, could not be further refined. This differed from his expectations. After several unsuccessful attempts, he realized it was due to his insufficient cultivation.</p><p>"It seems I need to refine the fireballs into the form of firebirds, stabilizing them before I can control the Nanming Li Fire," he murmured.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, weariness washing over him.</p><p>Every step in the secret passage had been fraught with danger.</p><p>Comprehending the Golden Silk Ancient Restriction and suppressing the Vermillion Bird's true feather had greatly depleted his spiritual energy.</p><p>He lingered, gazing at the Sun God Tree, a clear look of joy on his face.  All his hard work had finally paid off.</p><p>He put the tree away.</p><p>Qin Sang then surveyed the alchemy chamber.</p><p>Aside from the Golden Silk Ancient Restriction, there was nothing else of use.  Anything left behind by ancient cultivators had long since been destroyed by the Vermillion Bird's feather.</p><p>A wisp of Nanming Li Fire remained in the furnace.</p><p>Qin Sang lacked the ability to contain it, so he left it there to dissipate.</p><p>Then, a wave of chill swept over him.</p><p>Without the Nanming Li Fire's protection, the sword energy and killing wind assaulted him.</p><p>He couldn't stay.  Qin Sang turned and left the chamber, briefly checking the other alchemy chambers.  They were even more severely damaged, yielding nothing.</p><p>There were no other treasures on Sword Scar Mountain worth his time. After meditating and recovering in the stone hall, he decided to leave immediately.</p><p>Employing the same tactic, he lured and killed the red fox, traversing the most dangerous forest.</p><p>Qin Sang retraced his steps, fleeing the mountain.
