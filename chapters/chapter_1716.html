<h1>Chapter 1707: The Heavenly Demon Illuminates the Deity</h1><p>A hazy mist hung in the air.</p><p>The incarnation stood before the temple gate, his gaze sweeping past Master Xingji and the other high monks.</p><p>The apricot-yellow temple walls, the gray roof ridges, the ink-black mountains—the ancient temple, a shadowy silhouette amidst the clouds, exuded serenity and solemnity.</p><p>Monks filed out, standing by the path.</p><p>Inside and outside the temple, many non-Buddhist individuals were present.</p><p>Everyone was scrutinizing the incarnation, assessing this Xie family ancestor's true nature. Naturally, some eyed the Five Elements Pill with ulterior motives.</p><p>While the incarnation and Master Xingji conversed, some impatiently sent messages.</p><p>Their dialogue left the onlookers astonished, then enlightened.  No wonder the Holy One Hui Guang had specifically cleared his name; it turned out he’d become a Buddhist lackey.</p><p>That was precisely Qin Sang's intention.</p><p>He harbored no sectarian bias, treating Daoists and Buddhists equally.</p><p>By publicly declaring his temporary residence at Ganlu Temple, he bound the incarnation with Buddhism and established a righteous stance.  At least within Ganlu Temple, his safety would be somewhat guaranteed.</p><p>After the transaction, the incarnation wouldn't leave immediately, planning to remain at Ganlu Temple to break through his bottleneck.</p><p>Thereafter, if all went well, the incarnation would leverage Ganlu Temple's resources to gather the items his true body needed in Central State, allowing the true body to focus solely on cultivation in Luye.</p><p>Before his arrival, Qin Sang had carefully screened the incarnation's memories and placed restrictions on him.</p><p>In case of unforeseen circumstances, the incarnation would be decisively abandoned!</p><p>The amicable conversation between the incarnation and Master Xingji appeared, to those with malicious intent, to be a collusion of sorts.</p><p>After the pleasantries.</p><p>Both entered the temple.</p><p>Ganlu Temple had prepared a grand reception, fulfilling the Holy One Hui Guang's promise without reservation. While Qin Sang disliked such displays, he cooperated.</p><p>The incarnation acted like a puppet, bustling from morning till noon, playing his part before the guests.</p><p>The guests dispersed.</p><p>Master Xingji personally led the incarnation to a cave dwelling for rest.  It was evident that the preparations were hasty; they hadn't expected the incarnation to stay at the temple.</p><p>The cave was located on a secluded mountain behind Ganlu Temple.  It was tranquil and elegant, a truly superior cultivation site.</p><p>The incarnation was quite pleased, thinking it worthy of a holy land.</p><p>In North Sea, perhaps only the Xuan Tian Palace’s Lingxiao Peak could surpass it, and this cave certainly wasn’t the best Ganlu Temple had to offer.</p><p>The only drawback was that he didn't have exclusive access to the mountain; another high monk from Ganlu Temple was also cultivating there.</p><p>Declining further arrangements, the incarnation saw off Master Xingji.  As he sat pondering, a lay monk led Xie An, Zhou Ruan, and others who had been waiting elsewhere.</p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p>…</p><p>Several knelt and prostrated themselves, their excitement palpable.</p><p>They still seemed to be in a dream.</p><p>The incarnation calmly said, "Xie Yi and Zhou Li have been accepted as disciples by Shen Chen. As for you, carry on as before. The Xie family and Loutai View must cooperate to govern the three prefectures. I will not interfere with secular matters anymore. If you encounter any trouble, come cry to Ganlu Temple…"</p><p>After dismissing them, the incarnation sat quietly for a while before leaving the cave.</p><p>The lay monk stood guard outside.</p><p>"I wish to visit the Holy One at Little Fangcun Mountain. Would the monk please guide me?" the incarnation casually asked.</p><p>The lay monk nodded without further questions, silently leading the way.</p><p>They walked side-by-side through the mountains, taking in the scenery.</p><p>This area was the core of Ganlu Temple, heavily guarded.  The incarnation sensed powerful auras lurking in the shadows more than once.</p><p>However, these individuals seemed to have received instructions; none stopped them.</p><p>Their passage was unobstructed.</p><p>Until they reached a green mountain, where the lay monk stopped at the foot, hands clasped together.</p><p>The incarnation expressed his thanks and approached the mountain, when he heard, "Master Qin is expecting you."</p><p>A stone path suddenly appeared in the woods.</p><p>The mountain initially appeared unremarkable, but entering revealed a hidden splendor that dwarfed his own cave dwelling. It was worthy of a Nascent Soul cultivator's training ground.</p><p>The stone path wound through the forest, birds chirping merrily.</p><p>The incarnation saw no statues or carvings, and upon reaching the end of the path, he arrived at the summit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, there were no temples on the peak. Only two meditation cushions were placed on rocks, one occupied by the Holy One Hui Guang, the other by the Qinghu Holy King, with a sacrificial altar nearby.</p><p>They were meditating with their eyes closed, then opened their eyes in unison to look at him.</p><p>Under the gaze of Nascent Soul cultivators, the incarnation remained unfazed.  He noticed that the Qinghu Holy King had grown three more furry tails, though they appeared somewhat ethereal.</p><p>"Greetings, Holy Monk, Holy King."</p><p>The incarnation paid his respects.</p><p>"Master Qin, please," the Holy One Hui Guang slightly bowed, gesturing to the cushions with a finger.</p><p>The Saint King Qinghu smiled faintly.  "You're quite daring!"</p><p>The incarnation sat down without ceremony and immediately stated his request, "Will you two refrain from interfering in the transactions between Qin and Daoist Mo in the future?"</p><p>"We will not interfere in any way," Saint Hui Guang pledged.</p><p>The incarnation nodded, took out a jade slip, and handed it to Saint Hui Guang. "Please, Venerable Monk, arrange a spirit formation according to the instructions on this slip."</p><p>Saint Hui Guang examined it, then flicked his finger, sending the jade slip flying out of the mountain as a streak of light.</p><p>"This formation is rather complex; it will take some time."</p><p>"That's fine."</p><p>The incarnation inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. At least the first step went smoothly.</p><p>This formation, known as the Wanli Qingming Array, was a communication spirit formation.  The incarnation was residing at the Ganlu Monastery; his true body couldn't easily approach, so he would use this array to communicate. The Ganlu Monastery certainly possessed similar secret techniques, but only his own could he truly trust.</p><p>Qin Sang had obtained this array from the Xuantian Palace.  Its setup was incredibly complex, requiring extremely valuable materials, yet it only served for communication and had a limited number of uses, making it rather underwhelming.</p><p>Only the Ganlu Monastery was wealthy enough to afford it.</p><p>Then, the three began to discuss the karmic oath.</p><p>Mainly, the incarnation and Saint King Qinghu argued, with Saint Hui Guang occasionally interjecting, always maintaining fairness.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to ensure his own safety.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu generally accepted the incarnation's demands, but fiercely debated one condition:  all promises were limited to this realm, and he guaranteed not to bully Qin Sang until he broke through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The oath was agreed upon.</p><p>An altar was set up, and the oath was sworn.</p><p>The ritual for the karmic oath was complex, taking three days to complete.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu's lips curled into a smile. "Have you decided what you want?"</p><p>The incarnation said solemnly, "Qin would like to examine the Saint King's treasures more closely."</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Saint King Qinghu smiled radiantly, instantly exuding charm.  With a pat to his jade belt, streams of light shot out, floating in the air between the three, allowing the incarnation to choose freely.</p><p>The incarnation quickly scanned the treasures, showing a puzzled expression. There was no Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>Saint King Qinghu explained languidly, "An ancient Spirit Gathering Array is hidden in a secluded realm in the East Sea. Whether I move it out or tell you its location depends on your preference. Forcibly removing it risks damaging it. Of course, if the array is damaged, I will provide compensation."</p><p>The incarnation nodded slightly, though he didn't answer, a decision already made in his heart.</p><p>He definitely had to have Saint King Qinghu move the Spirit Gathering Array; otherwise, it would be like walking into a trap!</p><p>He looked again at the treasures before him.</p><p>A dazzling array of celestial trees, rare flowers, jade slips, ancient scrolls, pills, and treasures filled the space. Their value varied, but each was a unique wonder of the world.</p><p>The incarnation secretly marveled at the wealth of a Nascent Soul cultivator. He gestured, causing the light before him to tremble. An object flew out and landed in his palm.</p><p>It was a jade-like spirit bamboo, only three feet tall, resembling a flute. The bamboo was straight, with seven perfectly even sections.</p><p>Even the base was the same, only slightly paler.</p><p>Strangely, there were no leaves; only a luminous flower bloomed at the top.</p><p>It was a seven-grade Bi Ling Bamboo!</p><p>The flower without leaves was a sign of the seven-grade Bi Ling Bamboo's maturity.  The flower could be used in medicine, but if the bamboo was used for refining, the flower would be refined along with it to increase its power.</p><p>The incarnation carefully examined it, primarily checking for any damage; this was a requirement of the *Houtian Muren Stele*: the spirit wood used as a spiritual medium must be intact.</p><p>After the inspection, the incarnation returned the bamboo and then selected a silver flower the size of a plate, a crescent-shaped green fruit, and a tree root with a knobby surface…</p><p>Saint King Qinghu had preserved them exceptionally well; they looked as if they had just been picked, vibrant and fresh.</p><p>These spirit herbs and the pills in the bottles had various effects; for example, the green fruit enhanced spiritual awareness, its potency not inferior to a Bi Luo Immortal Fruit.</p><p>The incarnation held the green fruit, seeming reluctant to put it down, before finally returning it.</p><p>Then, he turned his attention to the jade slips, which contained the post-Nascent Soul cultivation techniques mentioned by Saint King Qinghu, as well as other secret arts.</p><p>The *Gu Hua Sutra*, *Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder*, *Four Secret Divine Records*…</p><p>Truly, they were all top-tier human cultivation techniques.</p><p>The *Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder* in particular was a top-tier secret technique of Xuan Shui Dao, only cultivatable after reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  It created Xuan Shui Yin Thunder, stacking multiple layers, which was not only terrifyingly powerful but also drew upon the power of heaven and earth when released, making it difficult for enemies to dodge.</p><p>It required the cultivation of water-elemental techniques and extremely pure water-elemental true essence, otherwise the difficulty of cultivation was extreme.</p><p>It was perfect for the incarnation.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar wasn't sure if he could reach the Divine Transformation stage, let alone create an avatar; even the most alluring secret techniques had to be regretfully abandoned.</p><p>He returned the "Hundred-Fold Yin Thunder" and took another jade slip.  Seeing the name on it, his spirits immediately lifted – this was the technique that had finally made him decide to risk this venture.</p><p>《Tian Mo Zhao Shen Jing》! (The Heavenly Demon Illuminating Spirit Scripture)</p><p>Five large characters met his eyes, followed by a summary of the secret technique. The jade slip had restrictions; he could only see parts of it, but he understood the technique's core principle.  It involved actively drawing a wisp of demonic energy from an extraterrestrial demon into one's body to illuminate the primordial spirit.</p><p>He finally looked at the remaining objects.  While there were no true spiritual treasures, there were pseudo-spiritual treasures.</p><p>After examining everything, the avatar hesitated.  He wanted the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array, the 《Tian Mo Zhao Shen Jing》, and the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo.  He also wanted a piece of Seven-Star Root, a key ingredient in a pill described in the 《Pan Hu Zhen Jing》 (Pan Hu True Scripture) that would enhance the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The compensation from the Azure Fox Saint King, along with the formula for Tranquil Spirit Incense, wasn't enough to exchange for everything.  He planned to keep the Tranquil Spirit Incense for Liuli.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King had been rude first, so he could ask for a higher price.  However, she had offered compensation, and he needed to respect the mediating Hui Guang Saint, so he couldn't be too unreasonable.</p><p>The avatar said, "I received the Water Phase Hall alchemical lineage from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect. The ancestor who created Tranquil Spirit Incense might also have come from the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, perhaps I could get some help in refining it."</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King's beautiful eyes flickered as she watched the avatar select items.  Without batting an eyelid, she said, "Exchanged."</p><p>"And the main ingredient for Tranquil Spirit Incense, including two Wan Ling Fruits…"</p><p>He had three Wan Ling Fruits left and planned to offer two.</p><p>Before the avatar could finish, the Azure Fox Saint King decisively said, "All exchanged."</p><p>Both parties were eager to trade, and the process went smoothly. The avatar took the 《Tian Mo Zhao Shen Jing》 and the Seventh-Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo, and requested that the Azure Fox Saint King move the Ancient Spirit Gathering Array.</p><p>He then exchanged the Wan Ling Fruits and other collected spiritual herbs for the Seven-Star Root and asked the Azure Fox Saint King to help find the various herbs needed for the 《Pan Hu Zhen Jing》 and the core spiritual materials for the Taiji Immortal Stage.</p><p>He could collect the Ice and Fire Order at his leisure.</p><p>This action might be considered aiding his enemy, but Qin Sang didn't care how strong his opponents were. As long as he kept moving forward, one day he would surpass them!</p><p>"Once the Myriad Li Azure Sky Array is complete, I will inform my true body to send the formula and treasures," the avatar bowed slightly, then floated down the mountain, his mission accomplished.</p><p>Watching the avatar disappear into the mountains, the Azure Fox Saint King chuckled, "I thought I'd have to subtly give him the 《Tian Mo Zhao Shen Jing》, but he picked it himself, saving me the trouble."</p><p>She turned to Hui Guang Saint, "They say extraterrestrial demons appear when cultivators experience the tribulation to ascend to the Void Refinement stage, because the tribulation is too strong, causing Heaven and Earth to shake, attracting external evils. When a cultivator faces a heart demon tribulation, extraterrestrial demons can invade.  Cultivators dread these demons. Yet, someone dares to actively invite them. Old monk, you didn't tamper with anything, aren't you worried he'll notice something amiss and abandon it?"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint replied, "This technique is a Divine Transformation stage secret technique. I don't have the ability to alter it. Any change would have flaws, easily detected.  Ancient Buddhist practitioners with unwavering willpower dared to actively utilize extraterrestrial demons to find weaknesses in their own minds, hoping for perfection. This scripture was created for that purpose. However, it focuses more on strengthening the spirit. Since they didn't dare to truly invite the demons, the effect of tempering the mind was greatly reduced."</p><p>"You suspect the Heavenly Demon Sound is related to extraterrestrial demons?"  the Azure Fox Saint King exclaimed.</p><p>"What a poisonous scheme!  That person's spirit sense far surpasses those of the same level, even exceeding his own cultivation.  He isn't a spiritual cultivator, but his spiritual cultivation is extremely deep. His spirit sense might leap ahead and rival that of a Divine Transformation cultivator.</p><p>It seems the Heavenly Demon Sound is compatible with Heaven. Unless he breaks through to the Divine Transformation realm and achieves harmony with Heaven, even a greatly enhanced spirit sense won't be able to perceive it.</p><p>Breaking through to Divine Transformation will inevitably lead to death from the heart demon tribulation.</p><p>If he fails to break through and is trapped by the bottleneck, he will be desperate and think of the 《Tian Mo Zhao Shen Jing》, further strengthening his spirit sense to find a breakthrough.  If, as you suspect, the extraterrestrial demon is the source of the Heavenly Demon Sound, he won't be inviting just a wisp of demonic energy, but attracting the demon's attention!</p><p>His sudden death would confirm the source of the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>Even if this world's changes are unrelated to extraterrestrial demons, with demonic energy from this demon always with him, if the Heavenly Demon Sound continues to strengthen, he will be the first affected. His demonic nature will erupt, and he will die without fail.</p><p>Spiritual cultivators are rare, and those who know about the Heavenly Demon Sound wouldn't dare practice this technique. He is unique, nobody is more suitable than him.</p><p>Old monk, you truly fear him greatly,  you don't intend for him to live even if he can't break through to Divine Transformation!"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint twirled his prayer beads, his eyes lowered, saying nothing.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King sighed, "In the past, though I disliked you, I thought you were quite magnanimous.  I never imagined you'd resort to such underhanded tactics!"</p><p>Finally, she shook her head, "Worried and indecisive, that's all.  Too many entanglements are indeed not a good thing…"</p><p>…</p><p>Far away in the Northern Wasteland, Luye.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body wasn't cultivating, but was constantly deducing something, with the 《Wu Sheng Mo Yin》(The Invincible Demon Seal) given to him by his senior sister Qing Jun appearing in his mind.</p><p>Since obtaining this secret technique, Qin Sang had a certain idea, but he hadn't found any techniques or secret arts to confirm this in the North Sea or Central Plains.</p><p>Extraterrestrial demons, also known as external celestial demons, are terrifying beings that can transform into a cultivator's heart demon, killing them invisibly.</p><p>Internal demons don't arise.</p><p>What about external demons?</p>
