<h1>Chapter 2122: Strategy</h1><p>Shi Mu and the others retreated from the Lake of Thunder once more, their initial high spirits replaced by dejection.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Grand Attendant faced off, neither making a move. However, the Thunder Gods’ offensive remained fierce, seizing the opportunity to claim enemy lives.</p><p>Finally, the Grand Attendant’s eyes narrowed slightly before he withdrew his gaze and returned to the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram with everyone else.</p><p>The green thunder dissipated.</p><p>The Thunder Gods vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze followed the Grand Attendant’s movements, watching them retreat deep into the land before lingering for a long time.</p><p>Currently, he had three ways to counter the Si You Clan’s mutual transformation technique: the Sword from the Heart Sea technique combined with the Thunder Altar, the Void-Breaking Spirit Tower, and the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>He chose to reveal the Five Elements Crown proactively. Firstly, to pressure the enemy, making them hesitant and allowing the charade to play out longer and more realistically. Secondly, to test the enemy’s hidden strengths.</p><p>This time, he failed to kill the elder, but successfully forced the enemy's escape method into the open.</p><p>It was certain that the elder’s escape was not due to his own abilities, but to the Xuan Huang light on him, originating from that landmass—Qin Sang's current biggest concern.</p><p>The Xuan Huang light could directly transport people away.  When attacking the Grand Attendant next time, he would first need to suppress this treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang now wondered if the elder's escape was due to the person controlling the landmass sensing the elder's danger and intervening. Or, if the Xuan Huang light itself had the ability to avoid danger, activating automatically when the elder was in crisis.</p><p>Or even, if it was the Grand Attendant secretly using the Xuan Huang light as a cover.</p><p>The countermeasures varied drastically depending on which of the three scenarios was true. Before finding out, Qin Sang wouldn't act rashly.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze, looking back once. The exposure of the Azure Vermillion True Thunder power meant that the twelve Thunder God talismans were about to be broken, and he should start preparing the second line of defense.</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Wang's carriage.</p><p>The Grand Attendant and other masters gathered.</p><p>The hall was silent, the atmosphere heavy.</p><p>Shi Mu and the others, invited by the Grand Attendant to assist, all wore grim expressions. Even Lu Wang's confidants looked uneasy.</p><p>Lu Wang remained impassive, surveying everyone. He had already learned of the events and understood their thoughts.</p><p>The Si You Clan's life-saving technique was unparalleled. Upon receiving the summons, Shi Mu and the others readily agreed.  Firstly, the reward was attractive, and they could curry favor with the Grand Attendant. Secondly, the Lu family and the Imperial family had an understanding, so the Yan Shan Si family couldn't cause any significant trouble. Most importantly, they were confident that even if they encountered unexpected events on the battlefield, their own safety would be ensured.</p><p>However, this battle shattered their confidence. The enemy could counter their mutual transformation technique; if not for the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram, Elder Duan Chun would be a ghost now.</p><p>Elder Duan Chun's face was ashen, still shaken.</p><p>Even with the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram's immense power, which saved Elder Duan Chun, these top experts only trusted themselves. Who would willingly entrust their lives to others?</p><p>Moreover, the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram wasn’t unbreakable. If the enemy found a way to counter it, and the mutual transformation technique failed, death was a real possibility.</p><p>Unlike Si Lu, who was the master of the Dharma Altar and had a clear understanding of the situation, repeatedly sending out his companion beasts only to harass, they were the ones charging into the formation.</p><p>They were completely unaware of the situation, only sending out companion beasts while their true forms hid in the rear, which was impractical. Their perception was limited, greatly affecting their strength.  Previously, several companion beasts were killed by Qin Sang. Though they wouldn't completely perish, restoring them to their former state would take considerable time and resources.  The loss of a companion beast weakened the owner.  If all four companion beasts were lost, any cultivator of the same level could easily defeat them.</p><p>Furthermore, the Si You Clan could not be equated with true beast-controlling cultivators. Many of their superior techniques required the true form to cooperate with the companion beast.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the Five Elements Crown caused fear, and some were already considering retreat.</p><p>Lu Wang saw their expressions. "That Qin Zhenren can counter our clan's mutual transformation technique. We must be careful. But on the bright side, he doesn’t know about the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram; exposing this treasure resulted in no casualties on our side! The most dangerous moment has passed.  As long as everyone remains vigilant and we find a way to counter this treasure, there's no need to fear!"</p><p>Hearing Lu Wang's words, everyone contemplated, their spirits lifting somewhat.</p><p>Then, Lu Wang turned to the silver-armored cultivator, “Several Daoist friends have engaged Qin Zhenren multiple times, expending considerable energy. Please rest and recuperate.  Mountain Master Mo will lead the charge into the formation!”</p><p>Lu Wang knew he couldn’t force the guest cultivators, so he had to rely on his own loyalists.</p><p>The silver-armored cultivator readily agreed, “This subordinate obeys!”</p><p>The Grand Protector interjected, “If Qin Zhenren continues to evade, we needn’t rush. Let’s breach the first formation first!  I and Lu Gan will monitor you constantly; you needn’t worry.”</p><p>Having steadied everyone's spirits, the Grand Protector returned to the matter at hand, “I’ve never witnessed the Green Thunder Qin Zhenren commands firsthand. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>The assembled experts, aware of the gravity of the situation, set aside distractions and shared their ideas.  After discussion, as usual, they devised several strategies to break the formation and then sent people to test them.</p><p>The back-and-forth continued as before.  Lu Wang's forces fought steadily, while Qin Sang refrained from using the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>More than twenty days passed. The twelve Thunder God talismans reached their limit; Qin Sang could no longer effectively utilize them.</p><p>Lu Wang’s side noticed this, so Shi Mu and others launched a full-scale assault.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Thunder Gods finally faltered, unleashing a torrent of thunder and fire before retreating.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>Shi Mu and the cultivators stood amidst the ocean of thunder and fire.  Except for a few unlucky ones, the thunder and fire no longer posed a threat. They could clearly feel the power of the lightning rapidly receding.</p><p>Before the palanquin,</p><p>Lu Wang and the Grand Protector stood suspended in mid-air, gazing towards the horizon. The thunder in the sky gradually dimmed, and the lightning became sparse.</p><p>The Thunder Marsh finally subsided. The sky and earth reappeared. Shortly afterward, Shi Mu and the others emerged.</p><p>“It’s been over three months since the first assault,” Lu Wang sighed.</p><p>The first formation alone had held them back for more than three months; countless more lay ahead.</p><p>Although no second-stage Void Realm experts had perished, they'd lost several companion beasts, and the Jiu Gui tribe and others had suffered heavy casualties. Fortunately, he’d brought most of his clan's elite, so manpower wasn’t an immediate concern.</p><p>“Your Majesty, do not worry!”</p><p>The Grand Protector bowed, “It can now be determined that Qin Zhenren has forged a Thunder Altar and practices thunder techniques.  Thunder techniques are numerous, yet they follow patterns. Once we breach the first formation, it will become progressively easier.”</p><p>“Let’s hope so.”</p><p>Lu Wang nodded, gazing into the distance as the Thunder Marsh retreated, “What should we do next?”</p><p>“No need to rush.”</p><p>The Grand Protector lowered his head, looking at the ground. He flicked his finger, and a stream of light sank into the earth.</p><p>Moments later, the land trembled slightly, the tremor transmitted through the Celestial Pillars to the earth.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Gigantic waves surged on the sea, their crests towering over the land created by the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram, forming a terrifying tsunami.</p><p>The earth shook violently, as if about to hurl the seawater into the sky. Amidst the wind and waves, new peaks emerged from the seabed.</p><p>As the peaks continued to rise, the land beneath their feet also expanded, stretching towards the coast.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>…</p><p>Peak after peak, landmass after landmass seamlessly connected.  Soon, the coast appeared before them.</p><p>Beyond the shore lay the territory of the Western Lands of the Storm Realm.</p><p>The land remained desolate.  Because of the higher humidity, it wasn't entirely desert, but a gobi, with sparse vegetation.  Had it not been for the near-millennial war with the Changyou tribe, and had the Western Lands' monks cultivated this land properly, it could have become a fertile and prosperous region.</p><p>Sadly, it remained a battlefield, frequently changing hands and left neglected.</p><p>Finally, the landmass reached the shore, connecting with the mainland.</p><p>‘Rumbling!’</p><p>Like two continents colliding, the world turned upside down.  Intense Xuanhuang light erupted from the point of contact.</p><p>When the Xuanhuang light dimmed slightly, the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram was completely integrated with the mainland.  The original landmass, however, remained elevated above the sea, like a detached territory extending from the Western Lands.</p><p>The Xuanhuang light continued to pulsate, eventually spreading across the land of the Western Lands.</p><p>The subsequent changes to the land astonished everyone.</p><p>A gentle breeze swept across the earth, carrying life. Seeds and saplings, buried deep underground, lodged in crevices, or inherently weak, had been dormant for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, destined, it seemed, never to sprout.</p><p>Now, they were revitalized.  On hills and rocks, tender shoots pushed through the soil, swaying gently as they strove towards the sky.</p><p>In an instant, the gobi transformed into a verdant plain. The barren mountains became dark green hills. Seeds grew into trees, and flowers and grass wove a green carpet, bursting with life.</p><p>A wondrous spectacle unfolded before them.</p><p>For cultivators who can effortlessly manipulate the world, these events were insignificant.</p><p>The landscape had drastically changed, and the land felt utterly different from the desert on the other side of the plains, as if they belonged to separate realms. It was as if a large chunk of the western territories had been swallowed by the Unstable Eight Extremes Chart, severing its connection to the rest of the land.</p><p>That’s exactly what happened.  For every step the enemy retreated, their forces advanced, consolidating their gains with the Unstable Eight Extremes Chart, gradually encroaching upon enemy territory.</p><p>Reclaiming lost ground would become increasingly difficult for the enemy in the future.</p><p>As Lei Ze retreated into the desert, Qin Sang observed these changes, secretly marveling at the profound resources of the Si You royal family. This unnamed treasure was undoubtedly a divine weapon for conquering and expanding territories.</p><p>Fortunately, the Thunder Altar was complete; otherwise, Qin Sang couldn't imagine a good countermeasure.</p><p>The expansion of territory didn't diminish the power of the Unstable Eight Extremes Chart; everyone within its boundaries remained protected.</p><p>Shi Mu and others descended from the sky, ordering their troops to rest while they flew towards the royal carriage.</p><p>The Unstable Eight Extremes Chart's expansion was holistic; the royal carriage and the mountain where Lu Gan was located moved forward together.</p><p>"With this treasure map, victory is assured!"</p><p>King Lu's spirits soared, a flicker of greed flashing in his eyes before he suppressed it.</p><p>The royal family's collection far surpassed the Unstable Eight Extremes Chart.  Only if the Sacred Land was in turmoil, the royal family suffered a devastating loss, or even complete annihilation, would the major clans have a chance to challenge their dominance. Previous major upheavals within the Si You clan had all stemmed from such circumstances.</p><p>The surprise attack on the Yan Shan Si family had already alerted the royal family. He didn't want them to turn their attention to the Lu family now.</p><p>After Shi Mu and the others returned, the Grand Priest said, "That Qin Zhenren is probably waiting at the second array barrier. Let's ignore him for now. Everyone, take some time to rest and recuperate."</p><p>The others were relieved and after a brief discussion, dispersed.</p><p>After seeing them off, the Grand Priest said to King Lu, "I've had a recent insight.  I'll take this opportunity to visit the North Sea and other regions to examine other altars."</p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>King Lu nodded, concernedly adding, "Be careful on your journey, Grand Priest."</p><p>"I will be."</p><p>The Grand Priest smiled confidently, took a step forward, and vanished.</p><p>Following the destruction of the twelve Thunder God Talismans, a period of relative calm settled over the battlefield. Qin Sang remained vigilant, unsure of the enemy's intentions.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's Dharma body, stationed at the main altar, suddenly felt a premonition and abruptly looked north!</p><p>North Sea.</p><p>On the edge of the Yin Ri Realm, within the territory of the Xuan Tian Palace lineage, the Grand Priest seemed to sense something as well. After hesitating, he cast one last deep look at the distant mountains, refrained from stepping onto the land, and quietly retreated.</p><p>Over the following period, Qin Sang frequently felt a looming sense of danger, a threat that shifted erratically from the North Sea to the East Sea, and then to the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>The opponent was undoubtedly a top-tier expert, and their identity was easy to guess: the Grand Priest, personally investigating.</p><p>The first instance might have been accidental exposure; the subsequent ones were clearly acts of provocation.</p><p>Qin Sang was not worried.  The completion of the Thunder Altar meant he could harness its power to strike at any location.</p><p>It was clear that the Grand Priest was acting alone, without any assistants.</p><p>Qin Sang was not only unafraid of the Grand Priest's investigation but was even calculating his chances of success in an all-out attack.</p><p>Unfortunately, he still hadn't fully grasped the nature of the Xuan Huang Light and ultimately decided against it, allowing the Grand Priest to circle the Storm Realm, granting him a little more freedom.</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, both sides remained peaceful.</p><p>The Grand Priest returned safely, easing King Lu's mind.  He inquired about the findings of his journey.</p><p>The Grand Priest mused, "In my opinion, this Thunder Altar array has a main and subsidiary structure. If Qin Zhenren arranged it geographically, the most likely configuration is one main and three auxiliary arrays. The entire western territory could be considered an auxiliary array!"</p><p>King Lu's expression shifted slightly.  "An auxiliary array? If so, if we occupy the western territory, wouldn't we…?"</p><p>"Precisely! By destroying that auxiliary array, we can create a massive weakness in the array, bringing the enemy close to defeat! We should then press our advantage, using the Unstable Eight Extremes Chart to gradually erode the western territories, forcing the enemy to reveal the location of the main array!"</p><p>King Lu rejoiced at this news.  Since their arrival in the West, they finally had a clear objective.</p><p>Several days later, a detachment of King Lu's army entered the desert, launching a new offensive.</p><p>Time flew.</p><p>For nearly a year afterward, the West was embroiled in war. Qin Sang's carefully prepared talismans were repeatedly broken, forcing him to retreat steadily.</p>
