<h1>Chapter 1676: Convergence from All Directions</h1><p>The illusory image of the Wordless Jade Wall towered several dozen feet high, visible not only to those on the mountain but also to the cultivators flying towards it.  The hastily drawn Dao Mark vanished in an instant, causing a ripple of commotion.</p><p>At this moment, countless cultivators lamented, yearning to fly directly to Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  The Dao Mark lingered for too short a time, disrupted by various influences, leaving them with practically nothing.  Yet, they could sense its extraordinary nature, imbued with Dao韵 , and could only sigh towards the heavens.</p><p>This feeling reached its peak as Patriarch Zilei ascended the nine steps, invoking the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>This was a Dao Mark that could help one break through the bottleneck to Deity Transformation!</p><p>"Deity Transformation Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>"Someone is breaking through!"</p><p>……</p><p>The crowd's expressions were varied, their emotions complex. Almost everyone present was witnessing a Deity Transformation Heavenly Tribulation for the first time.</p><p>From afar, Emperor Bestowal Mountain was shrouded in dark clouds.  Soon, vibrant clouds of various hues descended, encircling the mountain and merging into a single expanse.</p><p>The winds and clouds shifted abruptly!</p><p>A terrifying pressure descended. The cultivators within the Formless Immortal Sect's faces paled, their hearts trembling.</p><p>They had experienced this feeling during their Nascent Soul Tribulations, but how could a Nascent Soul Tribulation compare to a Deity Transformation Tribulation?</p><p>Atop Emperor Bestowal Mountain, the clouds surged like a raging sea, the colorful clouds swirling chaotically.</p><p>In an instant, a storm took shape.</p><p>Wind and thunder intertwined!</p><p>This was a terrifying storm imbued with the might of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth was mobilized by an unseen force, the entire Legacy Realm trembling.</p><p>A spiritual tide surged, visible to the naked eye.</p><p>During a Nascent Soul Tribulation, one could see the spiritual energy being drawn in from near to far, forming distinct layers of spiritual tides.  Now, it wasn't so clear. The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was mobilized simultaneously, forming a sea of spiritual energy suspended in the sky.</p><p>The spiritual tide surged with towering waves, emitting deafening roars. Then, the spiritual tide crashed down, like collapsing mountains, crushing everything in its path. The figure suspended above Emperor Bestowal Mountain, at the heart of the spiritual tide, was finally engulfed!</p><p>Witnessing this scene, everyone's hearts were filled with terror.</p><p>Even without the tribulation, if it were them, they would have been injured by the impact of the spiritual tide. Those with weaker cultivation bases could have been shattered into pieces on the spot.</p><p>Exclamations arose, but they were cut short by what followed.</p><p>The scene at the center of the spiritual tide became strangely distorted, quickly affecting its surroundings. A familiar fluctuation emanated, evoking painful memories in those who had experienced the Nascent Soul Tribulation.</p><p>"It's Yin Fire!"</p><p>"The Heavenly Tribulation has arrived!"</p><p>……</p><p>Invisible Yin Fire descended from the heavens.</p><p>It seemed that the Deity Transformation Tribulation was not that different from the Nascent Soul Tribulation, both consisting of the Three Disasters and the Heart Demon Tribulation. However, their power was incomparable. If one were to be touched by this Yin Fire, they would be incinerated from the inside out in an instant.</p><p>Under the pressure of the Heavenly Tribulation, the cultivators fell silent, holding their breaths.  Those who were fastest had almost reached Emperor Bestowal Mountain, but they subconsciously slowed down, not daring to get too close.</p><p>The influence of the Deity Transformation Tribulation didn't end there.</p><p>Although the anomalies within the Legacy Realm were concealed by Emperor Bestowal Mountain's protective formation, some celestial phenomena appeared in the surrounding Taiyue Mountain Range.</p><p>Moreover, due to the immense amount of Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi mobilized by the Deity Transformation Tribulation, the resulting fluctuations spread even further, attracting the attention of those with keen senses.</p><p>Northwest of the Taiyue Mountain Range.</p><p>Rivers carved valleys between towering mountains and steep cliffs.  The currents were swift, and occasionally, poisonous miasma formed into fog clusters, sealing off large sections of the river, lingering for years.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of light flew through the sky above these valleys, their direction clearly indicating they were heading towards the Taiyue Mountain Range.</p><p>Similar scenes had been unfolding throughout the Southern Barbarian Two States. As news of the Formless Immortal Sect's emergence spread, countless cultivators were drawn to seek treasures.</p><p>"Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>The leading streak of light suddenly stopped, revealing the figure of an old monk.</p><p>The old monk had white eyebrows and a white beard, a benevolent countenance. At first glance, he appeared to be an enlightened monk, yet his aura wasn't particularly strong. Any of those behind him seemed more powerful.</p><p>Another streak of light traveling alongside the old monk also stopped, revealing a seductive woman.</p><p>They were Sage Huiguang and Saintess Qinghu, who had rushed here upon hearing the news.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu sensed for a moment, then smiled charmingly. "It's a Deity Transformation Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>Her voice carried a hint of amusement, as if she were gloating, her gaze towards Sage Huiguang like that of a spectator watching a play.  "Old monk, you had ambitions to catch them all in one net, but you didn't expect someone to break through on the spot, did you?"</p><p>They were far away in the Jinyu State, the news reaching them late. Even with the speed of a Deity Transformation cultivator, by the time they arrived, the event would likely be over.  For this reason, Sage Huiguang had commandeered an ancient teleportation formation controlled by the Dragon Dwelling Cave Heaven, saving some time.</p><p>However, Sage Huiguang hadn't rushed on his way, instead gathering some Nascent Soul cultivators first.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu knew Sage Huiguang's intention was to use the Formless Immortal Sect to lure more evildoers in, catching them all in one net.  She hadn't expected this unforeseen variable.</p><p>Judging by the direction of the fluctuations, someone was undergoing a Deity Transformation Tribulation within the Formless Immortal Sect!</p><p>Another Deity Transformation cultivator would actually be a good thing. They would gain more strength to resist the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>However, based on her and Sage Huiguang's deductions, as long as the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound remained, no cultivator in this realm, regardless of their mental fortitude, could withstand the final Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>When facing the Deity Transformation Tribulation, a cultivator's journey through the tribulation was also a process of gradual comprehension and approaching the Great Dao. By the time they overcame the Three Disasters and the Heart Demon Tribulation arrived, they would be able to perceive the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>At that time, the Demonic Sound and the Heart Demon Tribulation would arrive together, leaving no chance of survival.</p><p>This was destiny, insurmountable by human power.</p><p>Seeing the unprecedentedly solemn expression on Sage Huiguang's face, Saintess Qinghu knew what he was worried about. It wasn't the fear of a new powerful adversary.</p><p>The person undergoing the tribulation under everyone's eyes, on the verge of death, might reveal the secrets of the heavens, causing the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound to be prematurely exposed!</p><p>Sage Huiguang, deeply concerned for his sect, wished to arrange the world before chaos erupted, ensuring the dominant position of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery for tens of thousands of years.</p><p>Once the news spread, the cultivation world would be in an uproar.</p><p>The cultivators of this realm, having lost the hope of Deity Transformation ascension, would surely fall into chaos, reshaping the existing order!</p><p>Even with Sage Huiguang present, how long could he suppress it?  He couldn't stop the undercurrents from surging.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A spiritual wind arose out of nowhere.</p><p>Sage Huiguang suddenly transformed into light and departed, leaving behind a multicolored ripple that lingered for a long time. He had actually employed a profound Buddhist light escape technique.</p><p>Saintess Qinghu chuckled softly, her figure like smoke, following closely behind.</p><p>The others exchanged glances, not daring to delay, and flew with all their might.</p><p>The two remaining Deity Transformation powerhouses in this realm, exerting their full strength, possessed incredible speed.  Thousands of mountains and rivers were like child's play, and soon, the Taiyue Mountains were within sight.</p><p>At this moment, above the former site of the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The swirling passage formed by the Formless Immortal Sect remained, figures swarming around it like ants, or moths drawn to a flame, desperately seeking that illusory sliver of opportunity for enlightenment.</p><p>As the cloud wall weakened, Nascent Soul cultivators had already entered the Legacy Realm. Occasionally, newcomers arrived, and with a mere release of their aura, the crowd would part to create a path.</p><p>Most Golden Core cultivators had also entered the passage, rushing into the cloud wall.</p><p>The turbulent flow within the passage gradually subsided, and Foundation Establishment cultivators began to move. Outside, even more ambitious cultivators with insufficient cultivation were anxiously waiting.</p><p>Sage Huiguang and Saintess Qinghu didn't reveal their auras, entering the passage one after the other. The surrounding cultivators only felt a gentle breeze brush past them, completely unaware that the two powerhouses standing at the pinnacle of this realm had just passed by them.</p><p>Facing the cloud wall blocking the mountain gate, Saintess Qinghu disregarded it, charging straight through.  However, upon entering, she sensed something, her expression shifting slightly, and she changed direction.</p><p>Within the cloud wall, in the most remote corner.</p><p>A group of figures were cautiously navigating the area.</p><p>Their clothing was ordinary, but their physiques and attire were somewhat unusual. Some were incredibly robust, while others were short and thin like monkeys. Most wore cloaks, almost completely covering their bodies.</p><p>Although they were suppressing their auras and deliberately avoiding the crowd, some of them still exuded an undeniable aura, different from ordinary people. It was demonic Qi!</p><p>Among this group of transformed demon kings, one stood out, appearing鹤立鸡群 .</p><p>This demon was tall and thin, wearing a mask that concealed his features. His white hair was particularly striking, complemented by a white robe, giving him a rather otherworldly appearance.</p><p>His aura was also the most concealed among the group, much like the Greenfur Rat Demon who had participated in the human trade fair. Even standing before human cultivators, it was difficult to discern his demonic identity.</p><p>As they were flying through the cloud wall, the Fish Demon approached and said, "Great Sage, we're nearing the end of the cloud wall. Why not linger here for a while, hunt a few Nascent Souls, and let the brothers have a feast?"</p><p>The White-Robed Great Sage's expression was pleasant, and he smiled faintly. "You and Liyuan discovered this secret realm and promptly informed me, even uncovering its secrets.  Is such a great contribution satisfied with just a few Nascent Souls? If we find our race's treasures in the Immortal Palace, you will have the first pick."</p><p>The Fish Demon was overjoyed.</p><p>The Bird Demon beside him was also extremely excited.</p><p>The other demon kings cast envious glances.</p><p>However, as they communicated, their expressions held vigilance. The Heavenly Tribulation fluctuations emanating from the Legacy Realm made them feel uneasy, eager to enter and investigate. If someone was truly undergoing a Deity Transformation Tribulation, they would likely have to turn back.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the White-Robed Great Sage suddenly looked up, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>At the same time, a laughter descended from above. "Baixiao, you are quite bold, daring to stir up trouble in the heart of human territory. Are you not afraid of losing all of White溟 Mountain's elite here?"</p><p>The laughter was seductive and alluring, but the demons who heard it were greatly alarmed.</p><p>Including the White-Robed Great Sage, whose name was Baixiao, all the demon kings bowed in unison, respectfully saying, "Greetings, Saintess!"</p><p>In the next moment, the clouds and mist before them trembled, and Saintess Qinghu appeared.</p><p>Sensing the Saintess's gaze, Baixiao's heart skipped a beat, and he hastily explained, "Reporting to Saintess, the Saintess Palace spread rumors of your disappearance, and I was worried…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Saintess Qinghu impatiently waved her hand, interrupting him. "This is the ruins of a human sect, teeming with human experts. What are you doing here?"</p><p>Baixiao knew the Saintess's temper well and didn't dare to ask where she had been. He immediately fell silent, glanced at the Fish Demon, and honestly explained, "When this Legacy Realm opened, a few of my subordinates happened to be nearby.  They took advantage of the chaos to capture some human cultivators and learned that this Legacy Realm was once the mountain gate of a top human sect. That sect was related to the legendary South Sea Immortal Palace, and there might be a passage leading to it."</p><p>The demon race was not short of legends regarding the South Sea Immortal Palace.</p><p>It was just that the Immortal Palace was located in the South Sea, controlled by humans, and out of the demon race's reach.</p><p>Only Deity Transformation powerhouses of the demon race had the opportunity to be invited into the Immortal Palace. Learning of the connection between the Formless Immortal Sect and the South Sea Immortal Palace, Baixiao was greatly intrigued.</p><p>Out of caution, they waited until most of the human experts had entered before taking action.</p><p>The Immortal Palace was vast, filled with layers of restrictions. Once inside, they wouldn't fear being surrounded by humans.</p><p>"The Immortal Palace."</p><p>Saintess Qinghu snorted, her laughter carrying a meaning that Baixiao and the other demons couldn't fathom.</p><p>"The Immortal Palace is out of the question, but I happen to be in need of manpower. Follow me."</p><p>With that, Saintess Qinghu turned and flew towards the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The demons exchanged glances, somewhat surprised, but they didn't dare to disobey and followed.</p><p>"It truly is a Deity Transformation Tribulation…"</p><p>Passing through the cloud wall and entering the Formless Immortal Sect, seeing the scene in the direction of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, even the powerful Demon King Baixiao was utterly shocked.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the depths of the Legacy Realm.</p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky there, with thunderbolts spanning thousands of feet and lightning falling like rain.</p><p>Not only was it a Deity Transformation Tribulation, but it had already successfully passed through the Yin Fire and the Gale. Judging by the momentum of the tribulation from afar, the final disaster was likely approaching.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Demon King Baixiao looked at Saintess Qinghu's back, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p>They were about to witness the birth of another human Deity Transformation cultivator!</p><p>Saintess Qinghu led her subordinates to land on a mountain peak where Sage Huiguang stood, gazing at the horizon. The demons, seeing the old monk, fell silent, as quiet as cicadas in winter.</p><p>"It's Zilei."</p><p>Sage Huiguang sighed deeply. "This child possesses exceptional talent. Patriarch Danyu once declared that, looking at all the past Patriarchs of the Eight Sceneries Palace, he could be ranked among the top three. He should have soared to the Ninth Heaven…"</p><p>Saintess Qinghu also lost her smile when she looked at the figure amidst the tribulation lightning, her expression turning solemn.</p><p>It wasn't about anything else, but respect for a fellow cultivator, and regret.</p><p>Sage Huiguang vanished in a flash, and Saintess Qinghu, along with the demons, flew into the sky, speeding towards Emperor Bestowal Mountain through the flight-restricting formations and sword formations.</p><p>……</p><p>On Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Patriarch Zilei, clad in a lightning robe, with the Eight Sceneries Palace Lantern above his head, and the Purple Thunder disciples protecting him, remained unharmed even as the Heavenly Thunder descended, transforming the surroundings into an endless domain of lightning.</p><p>The illusory scenes of the palace lantern unfolded in the void, displaying all his divine abilities. He had passed through the Three Disasters with unstoppable momentum, showing no signs of weakness.</p><p>……</p><p>While one ascended the mountain through tribulation, others below struggled to cross.</p><p>Zhu Wudao suddenly pulled the divine statue back towards himself.</p><p>As the chains tightened, the Demonic Son was pulled out.</p><p>Now, it could be seen that the Demonic Son's body was covered in blood-red runes. Zhu Wudao, having orchestrated the blood sacrifice and personally refined the divine statue, knew it inside and out. It wasn't difficult for him to manipulate it now.</p><p>Of course, his greatest reliance was his deep understanding of Ancient Demons.</p><p>His eyes had turned black, exuding an intimidating aura, staring directly at the Demonic Son as if seeing through his very essence. In an instant, countless runes surged into the Demonic Son's body.  It appeared brutal, yet it was like unraveling a cocoon, extracting the Demonic Son's origin.</p><p>His timing was impeccable, his movements swift. Before those above could figure out what was happening, he had already completed the process, suppressing it with a demonic seal.</p><p>His other reliance was the Spirit Suppressing Incense.</p><p>For him, a Nascent Soul cultivator, to swallow the Demonic Son's origin was like a snake swallowing an elephant. The Spirit Suppressing Incense stabilized his Nascent Soul, ensuring the successful execution of the secret technique and blocking the most ferocious initial impact of the Demonic Son's origin.</p><p>The demonic seal, carrying the Demonic Son's origin, merged into Zhu Wudao's body.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's aura surged!</p>
