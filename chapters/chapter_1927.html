<h1>Chapter 1918: The Leixiao Assembly</h1><p>Arriving at the city of Tanzhou Prefecture, Qin Sang took out eight taels of silver, paid the boat fare, and upon reaching the city gates, reported his origins to the ghostly officials. He smoothly obtained an audience with the City God of Tanzhou Prefecture.</p><p>The City God's attitude was enthusiastic, yet tinged with a hint of wariness.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger long, claiming his intention to explore the world's Thunder Arts. He requested the City God's assistance in keeping an eye out for nearby cultivators and factions renowned for their Thunder Arts, and then took his leave.</p><p>Returning to the Fuchun River, Qin Sang boarded a multi-storied passenger vessel.</p><p>The Fuchun River flowed into another great river within the borders of the Ji Kingdom. This ship sailed directly to the Ji Kingdom, passing through two nations along the way, stopping for resupply at every major prefectural city.  Under normal circumstances, it sailed day and night, a true long-voyage vessel.</p><p>This ship could carry over a thousand people.  With passengers embarking and disembarking along the way, even at its least crowded, there were hundreds of guests on board.</p><p>Passengers came from all corners of the land, offering a vibrant tapestry of humanity, even more diverse than a bustling city.</p><p>While the ship was underway, all necessities were taken care of on board, with dining areas on both upper and lower decks.</p><p>The upper deck was elegant and expensive. Qin Sang preferred the lower deck, often spending the entire day there with Xiao Wu.  He set up a "Healing the World" banner and actually began treating people's illnesses.</p><p>Seeing that he offered free medical care, the ship owner waived his fees and even set up a separate table for him in a corner, partially out of curiosity.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang's request was quite peculiar.  He didn't charge for treatment, but asked each patient to tell him a deeply moving story.</p><p>Initially, everyone took him for a charlatan, coming to see him with a playful attitude, making up stories as they pleased. Qin Sang didn't mind.</p><p>Later, they discovered that this Daoist priest seemed to possess genuine skill, often able to pinpoint the root of their ailments with just a few words.  Some hailed him as a divine physician.</p><p>The reputation of the divine physician gradually spread throughout the ship.  Even the passengers who usually dined on the upper deck heard the rumors and, disregarding their status, flocked to the lower deck.</p><p>Not only could they receive medical treatment, but they could also listen to stories.  The hall became so overcrowded that it disrupted normal operations.</p><p>The ship owner had to limit the flow of people, intending to create a separate clinic for Qin Sang, but Qin Sang declined.</p><p>Later, new passengers would receive well-meaning reminders from the ship's crew and would come, skeptical yet curious. Qin Sang was never short of patients.</p><p>Some quick-witted crew members even wanted to spread the word when the ship docked, using Qin Sang's reputation to make a fortune. The officials and nobles in the port cities could afford to pay handsomely.</p><p>But as soon as the ship docked, Qin Sang would disembark, vanishing without a trace, only to reappear suddenly when the ship set sail, leaving people baffled.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang came into contact with many City Gods of prefectures and provinces.  Unfortunately, the Fuchun River didn't pass through the national capital, and Qin Sang didn't specifically visit.</p><p>Throughout their journey, Qin Sang and Xiao Wu listened to countless stories, some true, some fabricated, some poignant and touching, others infuriating and heartbreaking.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang treated patients, Xiao Wu remained by his side, playing the role of his medicine boy.</p><p>One evening,</p><p>The ship had long since left the Liu Kingdom and was nearing the Ji Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang's fame grew, becoming a household name on the ship.</p><p>Before dinner time, even the crew crowded into the hall to watch the spectacle.</p><p>A plainly dressed older woman was tearfully recounting her life's hardships, from marrying the wrong man in her youth, to being bullied by her in-laws, neighbors, and siblings, to choosing the wrong daughter-in-law in her old age. She rambled on and on, occasionally wailing loudly.</p><p>Finally finding a willing listener, the older woman chattered on for over half an hour with no sign of stopping.</p><p>The audience had long grown impatient. Some wanted to shoo the woman away, but saw Qin Sang listening with rapt attention.</p><p>This was the benefit of a great reputation. Now the entire ship, from the owner to the passengers, treated Qin Sang with utmost respect.</p><p>Xiao Wu also stared intently at the woman, witnessing such loquaciousness for the first time.</p><p>Even the gods had had enough.</p><p>Beside Qin Sang's table, a chair remained empty. The people nearby seemed oblivious to the vacant seat, no one sitting down, subconsciously leaving a space around it.</p><p>Unseen by anyone, a refined man in white sat languidly in the chair.</p><p>The refined man stood up, brushed off his clothes, and sighed.</p><p>“Daoist Priest, if you wish for Fu to leave, simply say so. Why endure this torment? It's mutually detrimental.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. “This woman suffers from chronic stagnation of Qi, accumulated over many years, which has manifested as illness.  Allowing her to fully vent will alleviate seventy percent of her symptoms.  I am treating her illness.  How can the River God call it torment? Besides, Xiao Wu is listening with great interest."</p><p>Xiao Wu leaned closer to Qin Sang, indicating she was listening attentively.</p><p>This was the River God of the Fuchun River, who had learned of the arrival of an unusual individual on the ship and come to investigate.</p><p>The refined man shook his head repeatedly. “If the Daoist Priest enjoys listening to these stale, insignificant tales, why not visit Fu's river shrine? I guarantee you'll be entertained! Fu doesn't share the Daoist Priest's enthusiasm. I won't disturb you any further. Farewell.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in farewell.  "Rest assured, River God. I am merely acting on a whim and won't excessively interfere with the natural cycle of life and death."</p><p>“As long as the Daoist Priest doesn't use his cultivation to harm others, what you do is of no concern to Fu. It is their good fortune to encounter the Daoist Priest…"</p><p>The refined man walked towards the exit, the crowd parting unconsciously to create a path.</p><p>“By the way,” the refined man recalled something, asking Qin Sang to produce his travel documents and stamping them with the River God's seal.</p><p>“A major event is about to unfold in the Ji Kingdom.  The divine realm is on high alert. With Fu's seal, the Daoist Priest should be able to travel unimpeded…”</p><p>With that, the refined man vanished beyond the doorway, not specifying the nature of the event, and Qin Sang didn't ask.</p><p>…</p><p>The multi-storied vessel sliced through the waves, sailing swiftly, finally reaching the Ji Kingdom.</p><p>At the border between the two countries, there were checkpoints on the great river, both for the mortal realm and the spiritual.</p><p>Several ghostly officials boarded the ship, located Qin Sang, and upon seeing the River God's seal on his documents, bowed respectfully.</p><p>“We are merely following orders. We apologize for any inconvenience caused to the Daoist Priest.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the river outside and asked, “What has happened in the Ji Kingdom? Is everywhere as heavily guarded as here?”</p><p>The ghostly officials exchanged glances, and their leader asked, “Is the Daoist Priest not here for the Leixiao Assembly?”</p><p>“Leixiao Assembly?”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. It sounded related to the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>His purpose in coming here was to investigate the legacy of the Thunder Department. He cupped his hands and said, “I humbly request you enlighten me.”</p><p>The ghostly official explained the situation.</p><p>“After the Leixiao Sect fragmented, its legacy scattered.  Those who obtained fragments of the Leixiao inheritance all claim to be the rightful successors, engaging in endless disputes for many years with no resolution.</p><p>“Among them, three factions are the most powerful: the Manlei School, the Wuhui Gate, and the Jindu Mountain. The Wuhui Gate is a renowned sect within our Ji Kingdom.</p><p>"If it were merely a dispute over legitimacy, it wouldn't be a major issue.  However, a blessed land was later discovered at the former site of the Leixiao Sect, possibly containing ancient treasures of the sect, immediately causing a great uproar.</p><p>“Those factions with ties to the Leixiao Sect united to prevent outsiders from interfering, yet continued to fight amongst themselves, nearly causing widespread chaos.</p><p>“Later, somehow, they agreed upon a Leixiao Assembly.</p><p>“In two months, the Wuhui Gate will host the Leixiao Assembly at the former site of the Leixiao Sect.  All sects, clans, and rogue cultivators within the Ji Kingdom and surrounding areas, who have connections to the Leixiao Sect, will be present.</p><p>“There will be people from all walks of life, including some with cruel temperaments and erratic behavior.  Caution is advised!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang thought, "So that's how it is."</p><p>When that young man left the Ji Kingdom, he had heard rumors of someone obtaining treasures at the former site of the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>The turmoil hadn't subsided and had even led to a Leixiao Assembly. It seemed they had made another significant discovery at the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>Better to arrive at the right time than early. Qin Sang had originally intended to visit the Wuhui Gate first, but now he would go directly to the former site of the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>After seeing off the ghostly officials, Qin Sang led his horse off the ship.</p><p>The ship owner, a portly gentleman, was standing on the deck, watching the steward negotiate with the border guards.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang disembark, the ship owner greeted him with a beaming smile. “Is the Daoist Priest going ashore to admire the scenery again? The border is a place of conflict.  We are only stopping here for one night and setting sail tomorrow morning.  The Daoist Priest must not miss the departure.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands. “Thank you for your hospitality these past days. I must disembark now.”</p><p>On the ship, his food and drink were complimentary, and his requests were always fulfilled. The steward even returned his fare.</p><p>“Disembark?”</p><p>The ship owner was startled. “Is the Daoist Priest leaving?”</p><p>“No gathering lasts forever.  We shall meet again," Qin Sang said, leading his horse towards the shore.</p><p>‘Clang! Clang! Clang!’</p><p>The ship owner hurried after him, saying urgently, "Daoist Priest, traveling the jianghu with young Xiao Wu is fraught with inconvenience. Why not find a place to settle down, so Xiao Wu doesn't have to endure the hardships of the road with you?  You can stay on my ship, with all your needs provided for, and do as you please.  I'll even find a tutor for Xiao Wu to teach her how to read and write, ensuring her future livelihood…"</p><p>Qin Sang showed no sign of stopping. “Rest assured, ship owner.  If you take the medicine according to my prescription, your vitality will be restored to that of your prime.  However, all medicine carries some risk.  Given your age, moderation is still advisable."</p><p>The ship owner flushed crimson, chuckling awkwardly. "I blame my youthful ignorance, not understanding the ferocity of tigers and wolves.  Now my fists are no match for four hands… Are you truly determined to leave?”</p><p>Qin Sang reached the shore, looking back at the vast expanse of the river, his words carrying a deeper meaning. "The scenery of the Fuchun River is indeed beautiful, but once is enough."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang led his horse into the crowd.</p><p>The ship owner and the people on board watched him depart until he disappeared from sight.</p><p>…</p><p>Two months remained until the Leixiao Assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled at a leisurely pace, sightseeing with Xiao Wu, arriving at the former site of the Leixiao Sect three days before the assembly.</p><p>The Leixiao Sect was located on the western border of the Ji Kingdom, bordering the wilderness.</p><p>West of the Ji Kingdom lay numerous mountains, sparsely populated.  Beyond vast stretches of wild mountains and forests lay other nations.</p><p>For the mortal realm, this area presented little threat of border incursions, requiring only vigilance against bandits and raiders.</p><p>The spiritual realm, however, needed to guard against cultivators and demons from the mountains causing trouble downstream.</p><p>Recently, three City Gods of the provinces had personally led their troops to the area, standing ready.</p><p>During its heyday, the Leixiao Sect wasn't only the foremost sect in the Ji Kingdom, but also held considerable influence in the surrounding nations, rarely encountering a rival.</p><p>The Leixiao Sect occupied an entire mountain range. After its fragmentation, it gave rise to numerous factions of varying sizes, scattered throughout the mountains.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't reveal himself openly.</p><p>As the Leixiao Assembly approached, the Wuhui Gate and other sects established strict checkpoints at the foot of the mountains.</p><p>All those entering the mountains had to verify their identities and confirm their connection to the Leixiao Sect before being granted entry.</p><p>The cultivators in the mountains, with the highest cultivation level being Nascent Soul, were naturally unaware of Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>Before even reaching the location of the assembly, Qin Sang had already ascertained the complete proceedings of the event.</p><p>It turned out that someone had unearthed treasures at a former site of the Leixiao Sect, along with a suspected entrance to a secret realm.</p><p>This secret realm wasn't recorded in the Leixiao Sect's scriptures, and none of the numerous Leixiao descendants knew of its existence.</p><p>News of the secret realm spread, attracting the attention of countless individuals, with the Leixiao descendants being the most eager.</p><p>After all, many scriptures and treasures of the Leixiao Sect had been scattered, some of which remained lost, including invaluable artifacts.  It had long been suspected that they were hidden within a secret realm.</p><p>This matter nearly triggered a brutal conflict. The Wuhui Gate and the other two major sects joined forces to drive away outsiders. After some unknown deliberation, they decided to hold a Leixiao Assembly every sixty years, sending disciples into the secret realm, with cultivation levels restricted to Foundation Establishment Initial Stage and below.</p><p>Inside, the disciples were permitted to fight, relying on their own abilities.  Regardless of the treasures they brought out, others were forbidden from interfering.</p><p>However, the Wuhui Gate and other sects would issue rewards.  Rogue cultivators and cultivation families who obtained valuable treasures within the secret realm and were willing to offer them could directly join the sect.</p><p>For rogue cultivators without a sect to rely on, this was undoubtedly an opportunity to ascend to greater heights. The Leixiao Assembly was their ascension assembly.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a boulder, gazing at the bustling mountain peak opposite him.</p><p>The entrance to the secret realm was at the summit of that mountain.</p><p>His gaze fell upon the outermost circle, where young cultivators in coarse robes stood, hesitant and apprehensive, yet filled with anticipation. He saw a reflection of his younger self.</p><p>In the final two days, fewer and fewer people entered the mountains.</p><p>The day of the Leixiao Assembly arrived.</p><p>At dawn,</p><p>Rumbling thunder echoed from the west, the wind and clouds churning. A treasure ship and a gigantic golden eagle arrived together, representing the Manlei School and the Jindu Mountain.</p><p>A powerful aura descended, instantly silencing the mountains.</p><p>At that moment, an old man slowly ascended, resisting the pressure. It was the Sect Master of the Wuhui Gate.</p><p>With all parties assembled, the Leixiao Assembly began.</p><p>The ceremony was simple.  Half an hour later, the cultivators chosen to enter the secret realm were brought before a stone wall.</p><p>The entrance to the secret realm was here!</p><p>The three Sect Masters combined their powers to open the secret realm, and the disciples filed inside.</p><p>The experts from each sect watched with sharp eyes, scanning the disciples entering the secret realm to prevent anyone from sneaking in.</p><p>Yet no one noticed Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, following closely behind the crowd.</p><p>As they passed through the entrance, the secret realm rippled, the intensity increasing with higher cultivation levels.</p><p>This indicated that the secret realm's restrictions were unstable. The three major sects feared that if powerful cultivators entered and fought inside, it could cause the secret realm to collapse, and so used this method to resolve the dispute.</p><p>However, as Qin Sang and Xiao Wu entered the secret realm, there wasn't the slightest ripple.</p><p>Entering the secret realm meant the beginning of the carnage.</p><p>Two Qi Refining stage youths happened to land in the same spot and immediately began to fight.</p><p>Both were rogue cultivators, their treasures and spells unremarkable.</p><p>Finally, one youth prevailed with a desperate ferocity, slaying his opponent.  He wiped the blood from his face, sat in a daze for a moment before remembering to loot the spoils, his expression gradually lighting up with excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang stood nearby, silently watching this crude and rudimentary duel.</p><p>“What’s so interesting about two little brats?!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird snorted impatiently.</p>
