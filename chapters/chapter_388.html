Chapter 381: Nascent Soul

Qin Sang followed instructions, hurrying a few steps forward.  The view suddenly opened up.

It turned out that this grassland was just a small corner of a vast expanse, a place of peace and tranquility amidst chaos. Beyond the grassland, radiant clouds filled the sky, obscuring the light. The earth was shattered, filled with treacherous mountains, broken cliffs, and deep ravines.  Even the space itself felt unstable.

This feeling wasn't an illusion.  Within sight, more than a dozen places were constantly ravaged by violent storms.

Standing in a crevice, the roar of the storms was inaudible, yet their power was terrifyingly evident.  These powerful storms, however, couldn't shake the clouds and radiant light, which remained firmly in place.  The radiant clouds and swirling mists intertwined, yet never dispersed.  These were undoubtedly incredibly dangerous ancient prohibitions.

Scattered among them were white, black, and silver threads, some so large they were more like ribbons, dozens of meters long and several meters wide, floating in the air like clouds.  Qin Sang recognized these; he’d seen similar black lines in ancient cultivator’s ruins—spatial rifts!

For foundation establishment cultivators like them, danger lurked everywhere; there was barely anywhere to stand. It was hard to imagine how Yun Youzi found a safe route.

Seeing the sights of the inner valley, and realizing they had to traverse this place to reach its depths, even Qin Sang, who wasn't easily frightened, felt a touch of fear.  He hesitated, his foot poised to leave the crevice, then retracted it as if burned.

“This grassland is a rare peaceful place within the inner valley, Qin Lao Di. Don’t worry…”

Yun Youzi strode forward, standing on the grassland.  His gaze swept across the various phenomena, finally settling on two swirling storms.  He pointed, his voice slightly excited.

“There. We’ve been traveling for some time, and still have a long way to go.  Thanks to that senior's pathfinding, we haven't been overly depleted. Let's go now before anything else happens.  Qin Lao Di, stay close; don't stray.  It's easy to trigger a prohibition or fall into a spatial rift.”

Without waiting for a response, Yun Youzi launched his escape technique and flew towards their destination.

Qin Sang breathed out, and followed without hesitation.  Having come this far, there was no turning back. He only hoped Yun Youzi's route remained unchanged.

In the blink of an eye, they crossed the grassland and reached the storms.  Two tornadoes, formed from swirling sand and stones, rose from the ground, incredibly close but not merging.

Yun Youzi seemed to ignore the rocks being torn apart by the storms, flashing through the gap between the two tornadoes.  Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then followed.

The expected destructive power was absent.  Between the raging tornadoes, it was surprisingly calm.

Qin Sang was amazed, glancing around.  Seeing Yun Youzi’s escape technique still in motion, already flying past the gap, he hurriedly followed.

Thus, two escape techniques, one after the other, passed through countless places that could easily kill them.  Their speed varied; sometimes they had to take long detours to find a safe path.

Qin Sang remained vigilant, carefully following Yun Youzi's instructions, never stepping a foot out of line.  Gradually, he felt reassured; Yun Youzi seemed confident and unhesitating, always finding a way around what seemed like impossible dead ends.

However, Qin Sang didn’t dare relax. He memorized the route.  Once they reached their destination, if Qin Sang could restrain the strange person and allow Yun Youzi to proceed, they would part ways. He couldn't stay in this place indefinitely waiting for Yun Youzi.

They had agreed that after leaving the Wuyaya Valley, Qin Sang would return to Qingyang Market and wait.  If Yun Youzi didn't appear within a month, Qin Sang would give the token to Li Yu Fu.

After many twists and turns, they delved deeper into the valley. Qin Sang expertly followed Yun Youzi's route, finding time to observe the surroundings. He was most curious about the origin of the Wuyaya Valley.

Legend said the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was formed when ancient immortals shattered space during their battles.  Was Wuyaya Valley also a result of that war?  What was inside those ancient prohibitions? Were there ancient treasures?

Yun Youzi had mentioned that most of the prohibitions were empty.  Some Nascent Soul cultivators spent years and vast resources preparing to break them, only to find nothing.  This happened often.

As Qin Sang pondered these things, Yun Youzi suddenly stopped, turning his head, his expression grave, towards the left.


Qin Sang, thinking she was in danger, was startled.  She was about to ask a question when Yun Youzi made a silencing gesture.  Looking around, he flew to a steep hillside, hiding behind a yellowish-brown rock, gazing at the horizon.

Qin Sang followed, looking in the same direction as Yun Youzi.  In the distance, mountains stood tall. At the far edge of her vision, two mountains were close together, forming a gap that faced their direction.

Spiritual energy from the gap converged into a vast, surging wave, eventually forming a river of spiritual energy.  Suddenly, it plunged downwards, like a celestial river descending, crashing heavily into the depths of the gap.

Lying on the hillside, they couldn't see what the "river" was striking, guessing it might be an ancient restriction.

Qin Sang's heart tightened. This spiritual energy fluctuation didn't seem natural.

Could it be…?

The thought had barely crossed her mind when, after the spiritual energy dissipated, two figures in long black robes appeared.

The two stood in mid-air, their robes obscuring their faces.  They were looking down, seemingly in discussion.

Yun Youzi turned, his expression grave, mouthing a word.

"Yuan Ying!"

He then gestured to Qin Sang, indicating not to look directly.

Qin Sang remembered that Yuan Ying cultivators have sharp spiritual senses and might detect her gaze.  She quickly looked away, glancing discreetly.  She was relieved that they were far away, and an ancient restriction separated their auras, otherwise they would have been discovered.

This was the first time Qin Sang had ever seen Yuan Ying cultivators, and two at once!

She had imagined countless times what it would be like to see a Yuan Ying cultivator in action.

Would the earth shatter, or rivers flow backward?

It seemed the spiritual energy river hadn't caused terrible destruction.  Perhaps they had held back?

Qin Sang made a "sword" gesture to Yun Youzi.

Asking if the Wuji Sect expert who killed the Star Poison Frog was one of them.

Yun Youzi slowly shook his head, indicating he didn't know.
