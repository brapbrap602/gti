<h1>Chapter 1985: The Alliance</h1><p>A pocket world!</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised by the grand gesture of the Jitian Sect.</p><p>According to the Ghost Mother, the pocket worlds in the Greater Thousand World aren't the kind of secret realms sealed off by spirit arrays; they might be Lesser Thousand Worlds!</p><p>For cultivators at the Void Refinement stage, the allure of a Lesser Thousand World isn't that great. After all, most Lesser Thousand Worlds can't compare to the Greater Thousand World and can't support the cultivation of Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>But for a sect, controlling a Lesser Thousand World has extraordinary significance for its development.</p><p>The value of a Lesser Thousand World is immeasurable.  They possess abundant resources; some support billions of people, some nurture unique creatures, and some produce special treasures…</p><p>The Jitian Sect's generosity shows how much they value the Panlong Ancient Array; they're determined to obtain it.</p><p>A generous reward attracts brave warriors.</p><p>Those factions that found the ruins of the ancient array, kept the news secret, and stayed behind to study it themselves will probably find it hard to resist the temptation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Panlong Heavenly Pillar in his hand, and he was also tempted.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had considered whether to keep the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.  By thoroughly understanding this pillar, although he couldn't restore the Panlong Ancient Array, his understanding of array restrictions would significantly improve.  He might even be able to create a small Panlong Array around it.</p><p>"It might not be a complete pocket world,"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The evolution of Lesser Thousand Worlds varies.</p><p>Those that haven't evolved life, are barren, are severely fragmented, or have been thoroughly plundered by the Jitian Sect will be significantly less valuable.</p><p>"Daoist is insightful," said Gu Yun Sou,  "The Jitian Sect only released a message.  The exact nature of the pocket world and its remaining value will only be revealed at the Jitian Assembly.  Existing Panlong Heavenly Pillars are extremely rare. If Daoist offers the Panlong Heavenly Pillar, the chances of obtaining the pocket world will be very high."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was quite envious.</p><p>Since the Jitian Sect used it as a reward, it certainly wouldn't be a derelict pocket world, leaving them open to ridicule.</p><p>At the very least, a pocket world can serve as a last resort; in times of crisis, one could hide in a Lesser Thousand World and seal the boundary gate to avoid disaster.</p><p>It's a pity the Panlong Heavenly Pillar fell into this person's hands.</p><p>This person killed the ancestor of the冥鹘 Sect, a feat of incredible power. He wouldn't dare to think that the other party would share it with the Yun Du Sect.</p><p>"If I had teamed up with the ancestor of the冥鹘 Sect that day, would things have been better?"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou had this fleeting thought.</p><p>For many years, the Yun Du Sect and the Luohun Abyss have been entangled in grievances, often ending in compromise.</p><p>If it were the ancestor of the冥鹘 Sect, he would probably still compromise.  The two sects would cooperate to obtain the pocket world and then divide it.</p><p>But it's also uncertain. If he perished or was seriously injured, the Yun Du Sect would also decline like the Luohun Abyss.</p><p>Firstly, he had too many concerns. Secondly, Qin Sang acted decisively, preventing him from daring to act. Now that the situation is settled, it's too late to regret it.</p><p>Qin Sang changed the subject and asked, "When is the next Jitian Assembly?"</p><p>"The Jitian Assembly has no fixed date, only a rough time frame. Ten years in advance, they will send someone to deliver the Jitian Order. The Jitian Sect is so eager, the sooner the better. It will probably be within a hundred years," Gu Yun Sou pondered.</p><p>"When the time comes, Daoist friend must not forget this poor cultivator. Take me along to broaden my horizons," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"To be able to travel with Daoist, this old man would be honored."</p><p>Gu Yun Sou readily agreed, but pondered the deeper meaning of Qin Sang's words.</p><p>Taking him along, he doesn't intend to participate in the Jitian Assembly under the name of the Qingyang Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang himself is a Void Refinement cultivator, with a mysterious and unfathomable background. Although the Qingyang Sect's foundation is somewhat lacking, obtaining a Jitian Order shouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Did I guess right before? Does this person really have some secret that he doesn't want to expose to the Jitian Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want the Qingyang Sect to come to the forefront.</p><p>An unknown person, an obscure sect, suddenly appearing and directly obtaining a Jitian Order and offering a Panlong Heavenly Pillar, would be too conspicuous, too eye-catching, and too easy to attract attention.</p><p>If the secret of the Thunder Altar were discovered, it would cause a huge uproar.</p><p>Besides him, the Qingyang Sect's four Nascent Soul cultivators are all far from the later stages and are far inferior to other forces.</p><p>His disciple only has the Foundation Establishment cultivation.</p><p>Once he leaves, the Qingyang Sect won't even have anyone to oversee the main altar.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect should have grown steadily. Qin Sang ruthlessly eliminated demons for the sake of enlightenment, causing the Qingyang Sect to suddenly become a force on par with the Yun Du Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang founded the Qingyang Temple, initially hoping to leave a legacy in the vast world. Now, he's no longer bound by it, confined to a single place.  This Celestial Ascension Ceremony is a chance to gather information about the outside world.  When the time is right, he will leave.  But after he's gone, how will the Qingyang Temple survive, how can it avoid being bullied?</p><p>An alliance with the Yun Du sect will secure their position in this region.  However, this alliance needs to be carefully managed; Yun Du must be wary of Qingyang Temple, preventing them from treating it as a mere subordinate.</p><p>Qin Sang's carefully constructed background keeps Gu Yun Sou hesitant, but mutual benefit is the strongest foundation for an alliance. The蟠龙天柱  is the best bargaining chip.</p><p>Qin Sang said meaningfully, "During the Celestial Ascension Ceremony, I would be grateful for your assistance in securing a Minor Paradise for my temple. I hope you won't refuse."  He simply doesn't have the resources to do it alone.</p><p>Qin Sang has already decided to offer the Panlong Heavenly Pillar to the Celestial Ascension Sect, and he will do so through Gu Yun Sou!</p><p>"Is this true?"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was startled, his expression serious as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "I've spent many years in seclusion, rarely traveling. I lack external support. Securing a Minor Paradise requires your assistance at the Celestial Ascension Ceremony."</p><p>Many covet a Minor Paradise; even offering the Panlong Heavenly Pillar doesn't guarantee success.  Furthermore, one needs the strength to hold onto it once obtained.  If the Minor Paradise's marker is well-hidden, that's fine, but if it's discovered by malicious individuals, the Qingyang Temple won't be able to defend it.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou was greatly interested. If he helps Qingyang Temple obtain a Minor Paradise, wouldn't Qingyang Temple share it with Yun Du? Even a small portion would be highly desirable for any sect.</p><p>His only concern was whether this Qingfeng Daoist had ulterior motives against the Celestial Ascension Sect. An alliance with Qingyang Temple would implicate Yun Du.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Gu Yun Sou's concerns. His gaze was distant, penetrating, reaching beyond the horizon. "After many years of cultivation, I've reached the Void Refinement stage, escaping the shackles of lifespan. I've heard tales of the vastness of the world. To not travel and experience its wonders would be a great regret."</p><p>This was partly true. Qin Sang isn't necessarily impatient, as long as he can achieve immortality, he doesn't mind being confined to one place. However, he's involved in significant affairs, requiring him to seek out the Sword Pavilion, and he can't remain in one location indefinitely.  More importantly, the Great Completion Killing Dao, while the path of the Ziwei Sword Master and the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, is not necessarily his path.  Traveling the world, experiencing different Dao, searching for his own path through experience, is better than sitting in seclusion.</p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yun Sou's expression shifted. His doubts weren't completely erased, but greatly lessened.  No wonder he couldn't find this Qingfeng Daoist's background; it was as if he'd sprung from the rocks. He might have left his sect to travel and gain enlightenment, now seeking confirmation of his insights.  He may have used the conflict between Yun Du and the Falling Soul Abyss to achieve enlightenment.  It wasn't as scheming as he'd thought.</p><p>This isn't uncommon, especially for cultivators newly entering the Void Refinement stage. The path ahead is shrouded in mist; travel is often the best option.  Gu Yun Sou had done the same.  Even after breaking through to Void Refinement, he traveled extensively after mastering the fundamental Yun Du cultivation techniques. This explanation was logical.</p><p>Given Qingfeng Daoist's words, he wouldn't stay long but would continue traveling. However, he needs a place for enlightenment, making an alliance with Yun Du to protect Qingyang Temple seem reasonable.</p><p>Even if Qingfeng Daoist leaves, Gu Yun Sou wouldn't underestimate Qingyang Temple.  Regardless of Qingfeng Daoist's mysterious background, his strength alone makes him worthy of cultivation of a strong alliance.</p><p>Understanding this, Gu Yun Sou began to weigh the pros and cons. The two forces were becoming closer.  However, without Qingfeng Daoist, Qingyang Temple's growth would be difficult, posing little threat to Yun Du.</p><p>He said, partly agreeing, partly sighing, "I understand! I wish you safe travels, Daoist.  Unfortunately, I cannot abandon my sect's legacy and travel with you.  If I'm still alive when you return, I'd love to hear about your journey."</p><p>"You're dismissing me so quickly?  I'll be your neighbor for quite a while, perhaps for hundreds of years,"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily.</p><p>He needs to achieve breakthroughs in body refinement, sword arrays, and thunder techniques – at least one – for self-preservation before considering his departure.</p><p>Gu Yunshou smiled slightly.  "Once things settle down here, Daoist, when you have the time, perhaps you could take a trip to the Fire Region. We could work together to uncover all the remaining ruins. Afterward, I will go out to gather information and visit a few fellow Daoists to prepare for the Jitian Dharma Assembly."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "This disciple should accompany you, Daoist. However, I’ve recently had a breakthrough and need to close myself off for consolidation. I plan to emerge from seclusion by the time of the Jitian Dharma Assembly."</p><p>"Very well."</p><p>Gu Yunshou nodded. "Your cultivation, Daoist, surely requires external resources. I can look into that as well."</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang’s relinquishing of the Lesser Heaven must have other conditions attached, so he decided to proactively address it, prompting Qin Sang to state his requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate and produced a jade slip.</p><p>"These spirit herbs and materials are secondary.  This dose of Biyuan Shuanghua Elixir – I hope you can put in some effort to procure this."</p><p>Gu Yunshou’s spiritual sense penetrated the jade slip. He had prepared himself for Qin Sang’s exorbitant demands, but seeing the extensive list, his eyelids still twitched.</p><p>The Biyuan Shuanghua Elixir was recorded in the *Panhu True Scripture*, a miraculous medicine that could help a life-bound insect-蛊  break through its sixth transformation.</p><p>Previously, Tianmu Butterfly's cultivation had not reached that level, so Qin Sang had not rushed to collect the herbs. Today, however, the Tianmu Butterfly has reached the peak of its fifth transformation, only needing to refine its cultivation before attempting the breakthrough.</p><p>The other spirit herbs were also carefully selected by Qin Sang, greatly beneficial for physical cultivation, preparing for the breakthrough to the sixth level of the *Heavenly Demon Refining Form*.</p><p>To break through in strength, his treasures also needed upgrading. Previously focused on refining the Huying Sword and Mingshan Armor, their power wasn't befitting of a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Only by upgrading them to true spiritual treasures could his strength reach its peak.</p><p>These were invaluable items; even for a Nascent Soul cultivator, gathering them would require considerable effort.</p><p>"Daoist, there’s no need to rush. The Jitian Dharma Assembly is the perfect opportunity for fellow Daoists to exchange and share resources. I believe there will be trading sessions where various spiritual items will appear."</p><p>Seeing Gu Yunshou nod, Qin Sang smiled. "I wish to attend as well, and I hope you will introduce me."</p><p>Gu Yunshou nodded gravely.</p><p>He understood Qin Sang’s implication: this was merely advance preparation. The final exchange would depend on the confirmation of the Lesser Heaven’s value and the allocation between them.</p><p>Yundutian would definitely be taking a hit. However, in the long run, it would be worthwhile.</p><p>The two conversed for a while longer. Gu Yunshou and Qin Sang agreed on a time to go to the Fire Region together, then Gu Yunshou took his leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air, surveying the silent Luohun Abyss.</p><p>The Yundutian cultivators had already retreated.</p><p>The Luohun Abyss’s Corpse Demons were either killed or captured. The once powerful force that rivaled Yundutian in Mulu Mountain had vanished into thin air.</p><p>Several streams of light raced toward him. Upon seeing Qin Sang, they all bowed.</p><p>These were the two great Demon Marquises, Jing Zang caught in the middle.</p><p>Gui Hou stepped forward, presenting a circular mirror. Infusing it with true energy, the mirror emitted a beam of light, expanding in the void to reveal a map that encompassed the entire Mulu Mountain.</p><p>The map showed numerous bright spots, each representing a hidden realm, medicinal garden, or similar location.</p><p>Over these days, the two Demon Marquises, along with Jing Zang, had meticulously cataloged everything.</p><p>The Luohun Abyss, having been cultivated for generations, had accumulated unimaginable resources.  Qingyang Temple inheriting the Luohun Abyss's legacy paved a smooth road ahead, relieving Qin Sang from further concerns.</p><p>"Where is Ling Shi?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked.</p><p>Gui Hou sent out a message talisman.  Shortly after, Ling Shi arrived.</p><p>"Senior, what are your orders?" Ling Shi bowed respectfully.</p><p>"What are your plans for the future?" Qin Sang wouldn't restrict Ling Shi’s freedom. Once he was no longer needed to refine potent poisons, he could go as he pleased.</p><p>Ling Shi hesitated for a moment, then said, "Junior wishes to join Qingyang Temple, hoping for Senior’s approval."</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised, nodding. "From now on, you will oversee this place. Tell the cultivators of Mulu Mountain that as long as they behave themselves and don't disturb the human world, I will not bother with them."</p><p>"Yes!" Ling Shi bowed in response.</p><p>"You may go up first."</p><p>Qin Sang gave an order and slowly flew upward.</p><p>The spiritual energy of the Luohun Abyss was naturally far stronger than in his cave abode in the Fire Region.  The main altar must be built here; this could become a branch temple.</p><p>This place was too gloomy and uninviting, not befitting the demeanor of a righteous Xuanmen sect.</p><p>Qin Sang flew above ground and raised his hands.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>The ground trembled, and the rock walls cracked.</p><p>The fissures grew larger, seemingly about to collapse, yet began to bulge upwards.</p><p>Then, a huge shadow rose from the chasm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a gigantic mountain rose from the chasm, supporting the old site of the Luohun Abyss, reaching for the clouds.</p><p>Several Nascent Soul cultivators witnessed the sight of a Void Refinement cultivator altering heaven and earth, their eyes filled with deep shock and awe.</p>
