<h1>Chapter 1959: Dire News</h1><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind had form, the form of flames.</p><p>Blazing flames drifted like flotsam on the surface of magma, howling as they came and went.</p><p>Heaven and earth, save for crimson, held no other color.</p><p>Within the magma, occasional "splashes" revealed strange figures, flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>This was a pure ocean of magma, devoid of land, where only fire beasts with unique bloodlines and fire spirits born of the flames could survive.</p><p>Unafraid of the harsh environment, they traversed the magma like fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery wind stilled for a moment, revealing two illusory figures.</p><p>These two were Ling E and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou, a Fire Jade Centipede coiled around his arm, seemed to communicate with it, then pointed downwards.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ling, it's here! Lord Zhuque mentioned before that some Dark Devil Lilies grow beneath this magma. I just don't know if their medicinal properties will meet your requirements."</p><p>"Dark Devil Lilies thrive in places where fire energy is most potent and volatile, absorbing fire poison as nourishment. The environment greatly influences their quality. If I were using them myself, high-grade Dark Devil Lilies would suffice. However, this time, I need to refine a potent poison requested by Senior, requiring the highest quality."</p><p>Ling E gently twitched his nose, using a secret technique to sense the surroundings, then nodded. "This place is suitable, it has the potential to nurture top-grade Dark Devil Lilies. Let's go, let's take a look!"</p><p>The two plunged downwards, the magma parting before them and closing seamlessly behind.</p><p>The magma was bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou led the way, continuously descending, and asked via sound transmission, "Fellow Daoist Ling, do you mean that, at most, only a few plants in the entire patch can reach top-grade quality? How many are needed to refine the potent poison?"</p><p>"The more, the better!" Ling E replied.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Gui Hou furrowed his brow. "In the entire Fire Domain, I'm afraid there aren't many such places. Moreover, once they reach a certain size, they're usually claimed. The three major sects of the Fire Domain are all proficient in fire-based Dao Arts, and there are numerous other factions. Even if they don't cultivate Dark Devil Lilies, they can still develop the area into medicinal fields."</p><p>"Let's do our best; this isn't the only option! Besides, Senior possesses great divine abilities, he'll certainly have a way. If he wants to unify the Fire Domain, wouldn't it be a simple matter?" Ling E said casually.</p><p>Brought back by Qin Sang, Ling E was initially apprehensive, but now felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he only needed to focus on comprehending the Dao of Poisons and developing various potent toxins.  No matter the request, Qin Sang would fully support him.</p><p>Such treatment was usually reserved for Alchemy Grandmasters.</p><p>Although there was a saying that alchemy and poison were two sides of the same coin, and Ling E did understand some alchemy, his cultivation of poison arts wasn't solely for concocting poisons, and lacking an alchemical heritage, he ultimately couldn't compare to a true Alchemy Grandmaster.</p><p>The price was restricted freedom, but he was already targeted by the Soulfall Abyss, leaving him no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou, however, couldn't be as carefree as Ling E. He shook his head and said, "That being said, as subordinates, we must do our utmost to alleviate Master's worries."</p><p>As they spoke, the two descended to a great depth.</p><p>Not only did the temperature not decrease, but the blazing, violent aura nurtured by heaven and earth grew even more intense.</p><p>Gradually, the magma became indistinguishable to the naked eye, transforming into pure streams of fire flowing from all directions.</p><p>It was hard to imagine the apocalyptic scene that would unfold should these forces erupt.</p><p>"Fire Domain cultivators call such places Blaze Pools. Fire energy undergoes transformation here. Within powerful Blaze Pools, we must also be cautious. Dark Devil Lilies are linked to the Blaze Pool's energy. We must be careful when harvesting them, lest we trigger a violent eruption."</p><p>Gui Hou cautioned.</p><p>As they spoke, they descended further, deliberately slowing down.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed dramatically, and even these two Nascent Soul cultivators felt a primal sense of oppression.</p><p>Without any warning, the surroundings suddenly calmed.</p><p>Here, no turbulent currents could be seen.</p><p>Yet, this tranquility felt incredibly eerie, as if immense power was accumulating, ready to explode and annihilate everything.</p><p>Fire existed here as well, burning quietly. The flames were a faint blue, gently swaying, giving a deceptive impression of fragility.</p><p>They cautiously entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a patch of shadow within the blue flames.</p><p>The shadow wasn't entirely dark, emitting a dim blue light.</p><p>Within the light, scattered sparsely, were flowers resembling lilies, their petals also a dark blue, some deep, some lighter.</p><p>There was no soil here. They floated, and one could clearly see countless blue roots extending from their base, reaching into the flames to absorb "nourishment."</p><p>"One, two... there are actually five top-grade Dark Devil Lilies!"</p><p>Ling E's face lit up with joy. He had expected two or three at most.</p><p>He flashed to the side of a top-grade Dark Devil Lily and extended his right hand towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers flicked gently, emitting peculiar fluctuations that enveloped the root ball.</p><p>Ling E focused intently, his movements gentle yet decisive. He gently cupped the root ball, then patiently, one by one, extracted the roots from the flames.</p><p>Harvesting a single Dark Devil Lily took about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou watched him retrieve a complete plant, then offered his assistance.</p><p>Just as the two were engrossed in harvesting the spirit flowers, they suddenly sensed something and paused, exchanging glances.</p><p>"Someone's coming!" Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma, teeming with countless fire beasts and fire spirits, was inherently chaotic.</p><p>While harvesting herbs in the Blaze Pool, they couldn't be acutely aware of every fluctuation outside. If someone merely passed by nearby, they wouldn't be alerted.</p><p>However, the newcomer seemed unusual, fleeing here in a panic, as if being pursued, plunging headlong into the area.</p><p>Both Gui Hou and Ling E possessed ample composure. They didn't act rashly and judged the direction of the uninvited guest's movement based on the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>"He's not coming here," Gui Hou said, his expression easing slightly.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, they sensed another aura, following closely behind.</p><p>Ling E uttered, "As expected," then added in surprise, "It's actually two Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators weren't numerous in the Fire Domain. To encounter two at once, engaged in a chase, was unusual.</p><p>"There might be people from the three major sects of the Fire Domain, but it's none of our business. The important matter at hand…" Gui Hou shook his head, but noticed the change in Ling E's expression.</p><p>"The one behind is a Corpse Devil from the Soulfall Abyss!"</p><p>Ling E's eyes flashed with cold light, and he sneered, "These things, neither human nor ghost, I can smell their corpse stench even through the magma!"</p><p>…</p><p>Upper level.</p><p>A crimson streak of light zipped through the magma.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a powerfully built man. If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize him as Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect, whom Qin Sang's avatar had lured over during the annihilation of the Sand Bandits.</p><p>Now, Fu Xiao's robust and sturdy frame was hunched, his face ashen, clearly suffering from grievous injuries.</p><p>A gaping wound, piercing his robes, marred his chest.</p><p>The wound nearly penetrated through to his back, undoubtedly causing severe internal damage.</p><p>The most troublesome aspect wasn't the injury itself, but a layer of green flames clinging to its surface.</p><p>Like a malignant growth, these green flames adhered to his flesh, preventing the wound from healing and devouring his life force. Even consuming numerous healing pills was futile.</p><p>'Huff! Huff! Huff!'</p><p>As he fled, Fu Xiao formed hand seals and spewed a ball of spirit fire.</p><p>The spirit fire landed on his chest, intertwining with the green flames, but failed to eradicate them.</p><p>He repeatedly expelled several more fireballs, managing only to temporarily suppress the green flames.</p><p>Moreover, he discovered a more terrifying phenomenon: the green flames were silently invading his internal organs.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he had several methods to extinguish the green flames, but now, severely injured and with pursuers on his tail, his situation was perilous, and no method seemed effective.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, his anxiety mounting. At this rate, he would perish before reaching safety.</p><p>He had stumbled upon the Corpse Devil's whereabouts but hadn't anticipated another lurking in ambush.  Caught off guard and ambushed, his sect communication talisman was destroyed, leaving him with no recourse.</p><p>From behind, the sinister aura relentlessly pursued him, rapidly closing the distance.</p><p>Chasing him was a streak of green flame, strikingly conspicuous within the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao, cultivating the Six Harmonies Sect's core techniques, was like a fish in water within the magma, his escape speed lightning-fast. Yet, the green flames were no less swift!</p><p>Within the green flames was another tall figure, appearing even more imposing than Fu Xiao. It was one of those whom Qin Sang had startled when he activated the bronze pillar.</p><p>The others were nowhere to be seen; only this tall man pursued Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>"Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn't returned to report and Rou Ji hadn't been injured, you wouldn't have escaped alive! Stay put!"</p><p>The tall man snarled, his robes billowing.  His entire body suddenly erupted with surges of green flames, instantly transforming him into a man of fire.</p><p>The green flames spread, rapidly dyeing the surrounding magma green.  The green magma instantly shifted from scorching hot to chillingly cold.</p><p>The green flames spread with astonishing speed. Just as Fu Xiao sensed something amiss, he was already surrounded by green magma, a primal alarm ringing within him.</p><p>Without warning, a ghastly white claw emerged from the green flames, its five fingers like sharp swords, reaching for his back.</p><p>If this strike connected, Fu Xiao's fate would be sealed.</p><p>Fortunately, he had been wary. A crimson pattern, formed of flames, appeared on his back, resembling a Bagua but with subtle differences.</p><p>As the Bagua fire diagram manifested, a muffled thunderclap resounded.</p><p>Struck by the ghost claw, the fire diagram trembled violently, cracks appearing, but it successfully blocked the ghost claw for an instant.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity and dashed forward.  He should have been able to distance himself from his pursuer, but he felt another gust of sinister wind.</p><p>The ghost claw, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, materialized before him, aiming straight for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was aghast, but amidst his panic, a hint of ruthlessness flickered.  He opened his mouth wide, expelling not flames, but a bead.</p><p>This bead, radiating exceptionally brilliant light, was the Crimson Seal Bead, a treasure Fu Xiao greatly relied upon. Now, to escape, he could only bear the pain of destroying it!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Crimson Seal Bead shot towards the ghost claw, which immediately detected the anomaly. Its five fingers curled, preparing to retreat into the green magma.</p><p>However, the ghost claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao, having planned this for some time, had timed it perfectly.</p><p>With a 'Boom,' the Crimson Seal Bead exploded, a fire serpent, entwined with fragments, erupted.</p><p>A furious roar echoed from within the magma. The ghost claw, unable to escape in time, remained extended, its five fingers spreading wide, revealing a black eye embedded in its palm, swiveling left and right like a living creature, utterly bizarre.</p><p>With a blink, a black beam shot from the pupil, meeting the fire serpent formed by the Crimson Seal Bead.</p><p>The instant the two forces collided, a shadowy figure vaguely appeared behind the ghost claw, retreating backward.</p><p>The Crimson Seal Bead's power was immense, instantly destroying the black beam.</p><p>The tall man appeared somewhat dishevelled, but he hadn't sustained significant injuries, having dodged most of the blast.</p><p>However, the green flames engulfing the magma faltered.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the chance to escape, flicking his sleeves, sending several streaks of light towards his enemy.  Without looking back, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered an ancient Six Harmonies Sect ruin from millennia past.</p><p>The brief clash had drastically worsened his injuries.  He knew that relying solely on his own strength, escaping the devil's clutches was near impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruin still existed; it was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling E temporarily ceased their harvest and quietly left the Blaze Pool.</p><p>They hadn't approached the battlefield too closely, but based on the fluctuations emanating from there, they could deduce the situation with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>"That's the Six Harmonies Sect's Azure Sky Art!"  Gui Hou seldom ventured out, but he was familiar with the surrounding forces, especially the three major sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>"A Corpse Devil from the Soulfall Abyss, chasing down a Six Harmonies Sect expert here… don't you find it suspicious, Fellow Daoist?"</p><p>Ling E appeared eager. "The Soulfall Abyss is extending its clutches into the Fire Domain again; there must be a sinister plot! We'd best investigate this thoroughly and be prepared, lest we disturb Senior's cultivation later!"</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling E, aware of the grudge between Ling E and the Soulfall Abyss.  He was certainly eager for revenge.</p><p>Ling E's words held some merit.</p><p>However, Gui Hou also had to consider whether their intervention, while seemingly harmless, might attract the attention of a Soulfall Abyss ancestor.</p><p>Having followed Qin Sang from the Talisman World to the Great Thousand World, Gui Hou knew that Qin Sang hadn't reached the Void Refinement stage through conventional means.  Facing a true Void Refinement cultivator, he might not gain the upper hand, and it was best to consolidate his foundation and delay such encounters as long as possible.</p><p>"Rest assured, Fellow Daoist. That fellow isn't particularly important in the Soulfall Abyss.  He's certainly not the only one who infiltrated the Fire Domain.  That old devil has several Nascent Soul late-stage devils under his command; the loss of a single Corpse Devil wouldn't even make him blink," Ling E asserted confidently.</p><p>Just as they were at an impasse, they suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, expressions of respect appearing on their faces.  Listening intently for a moment, they bowed towards the void in unison.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Only after the voice faded did they straighten up.</p><p>Ling E chuckled. "As expected, Senior has already seen through everything!"</p><p>Gui Hou offered no comment, then looked ahead and hurried after the voice. "Fellow Daoist Ling, we need to discuss our strategy carefully. Master wants him captured alive; we must ensure success. We'll have to rely on your poison skills."</p><p>"Certainly! Soulfall Abyss Corpse Devils constantly refine corpse poison; ordinary toxins are ineffective against them.  However, my poison arts are a different story. I'll make sure he doesn't leave alive!"</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Dao Field.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by a constellation of shimmering stars.</p>
