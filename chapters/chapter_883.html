<h1>Chapter 875: One Body</h1><p>Qin Sang's thoughts swirled.  The more she considered it, the more feasible the plan seemed. The problem was how to get her external avatar chosen by the Yanmiao Sect and infiltrate it.</p><p>This body's aptitude was ordinary, only a four-spirit root.  In its previous life, it had good luck, receiving a fortuitous encounter and cultivating to the fifth level of Qi Condensation before dying, stuck at the sixth-level bottleneck.</p><p>Even if it were to somehow break through that bottleneck in the future, it wouldn't achieve much.</p><p>The external avatar mainly relied on blood feeding and secret techniques for improvement. The *Seed Yuan Demon Fetus* technique doesn't require specific bodily aptitudes; that's why Qin Sang chose this corpse as the vessel.</p><p>With such an aptitude, it was impossible to be chosen by the Yanmiao Sect. So, cultivation was the only way.</p><p>The three major bottlenecks of the Qi Condensation stage are three major hurdles for cultivators.</p><p>Successfully breaking through these three bottlenecks, even with poor aptitude, at least demonstrates either unwavering determination or profound good fortune, suggesting potential for Foundation Establishment in the future.</p><p>These factors alone would be sufficient reasons for selection.</p><p>With such a mindset, even if Foundation Establishment failed, the individual could learn a craft, make a contribution to the sect, and avoid being seen as useless.</p><p>After all, the Yanmiao Sect isn't like the Lan Dou Sect—a prestigious sect.  Their disciple selection criteria wouldn't be overly strict, otherwise they'd barely attract anyone.</p><p>The external avatar's cultivation progress was extremely fast, nearing the peak of the seventh level of Qi Condensation.</p><p>The Yanmiao Sect's disciple recruitment ceremony was only a month away. Breaking through to the ninth level in a month was difficult, requiring Qin Sang to use her essence blood to push it forcefully.</p><p>“Continuous blood feeding should forcibly push it to the ninth level of Qi Condensation within a month.  However, this quick advancement might cause instability in the external avatar's mental state.  However, with this low cultivation, and the sword soul containing a trace of Jade Buddha power, a backlash is unlikely…”</p><p>Qin Sang had made her decision. She instructed her assistant to buy demonic corpses at a high price, then returned to her cave abode, sitting opposite her external avatar.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the secret technique and slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>Her face was slightly pale, but it quickly returned to normal.</p><p>The external avatar's aura was unstable. In just one month, its cultivation had reached the peak of the eighth level and was attempting a breakthrough.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The true essence in the external avatar's energy sea suddenly expanded, then abruptly compressed inward, before quickly calming down.</p><p>The sound of bones cracking emanated from it, as its body was tempered during the breakthrough. As its aura stabilized, the tempering quickly completed.</p><p>At this point, its cultivation had successfully broken through to the ninth level of Qi Condensation.</p><p>If other cultivators witnessed such an easy and smooth breakthrough, especially at the ninth-level bottleneck, they would be green with envy.</p><p>Qin Sang checked the external avatar's condition, confirming there were no problems, and relaxed slightly.</p><p>This past month, the most tiring wasn't the external avatar but her main body. She not only had to maintain the secret technique but also provide essence blood. Luckily, the results were good.</p><p>However, this blood-feeding method of elevating cultivation would become less effective as the difference in cultivation between the external avatar and the main body narrowed. When their cultivation levels became similar, there was only one way to quickly improve the external avatar's cultivation—to transform the avatar into a true demon, devouring the essence of other cultivators.</p><p>The *Seed Yuan Demon Fetus* is essentially a demonic and evil art.  Thanks to improvements by Senior Qingzhu, it seems less evil, but its nature remains bloody.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time, “The Yanmiao Sect's disciple recruitment ceremony is in six days.  It's best to go early. Let the external avatar consolidate its cultivation. I'll quickly refine the Devouring Yuan Cone and prepare more defensive measures.”</p><p>Qin Sang set up a restriction, separating a quiet chamber for the external avatar, while she activated the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, refining the demonic corpses her assistant delivered, then took out several oddly glowing pieces of demonic bone from her Qianjun Ring.</p><p>To ensure the external avatar's safety, Qin Sang spared no expense, using her treasured demonic bones.  These were from demonic beasts at the Core Formation stage, a slight waste for refining the Devouring Yuan Cone, but its power would be undeniable.</p><p>Without rest, she began refining them without delay.</p><p>The demon fire gathered into a ball, floating before Qin Sang.</p><p>Now, her control of the demon fire and her refining skills were far superior to before.  She calmly watched the bones roll in the demon fire, impurities being refined away, melting into their purest form, ultimately shaping into the Devouring Yuan Cone.</p><p>Drawing on her past experience, she added other insidious techniques to the Devouring Yuan Cone, such as poison needles.</p><p>After much effort, Qin Sang had more than ten Devouring Yuan Cones before her.</p><p>Qin Sang stored the items in a pouch, then selected several suitable magical artifacts for his external avatar and gave them to him to refine.</p><p>Qin Sang observed his avatar, pondering any possible oversights.</p><p>Three days later, late at night.</p><p>Qin Sang set off with his external avatar.</p><p>The market town was a considerable distance from the Yanmiao Pavilion, but this was no issue for Qin Sang; he reached the Lan Dou Mountains before dawn.</p><p>The Lan Dou Mountains were the territory of the Lan Dou Sect, along with several smaller sects affiliated with it, occupying various parts of the mountains.</p><p>On a mountaintop.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the endless mountain ranges ahead, his expressionless avatar by his side.</p><p>"Let's separate here. Take this."</p><p>Qin Sang turned, handing his avatar a special coin. He decided to part ways with his avatar here, allowing the avatar to proceed to the Yanmiao Pavilion alone while his true form provided covert protection.</p><p>The avatar's expression remained unchanged; he silently accepted the coin.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang summoned a butterfly-like magical creature, his lips moving slightly as if giving instructions. The creature circled his true form, reluctant to leave.</p><p>Finally, sensing an identical aura to Qin Sang's, the creature's resistance lessened, its wings fluttering, before vanishing into his dantian.</p><p>"With the creature's concealment abilities, it's enough to evade detection, but it's best not to reveal it unnecessarily…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.</p><p>Both were immensely important to him, yet now they had to separate.</p><p>The avatar nodded to his true form, then propelled himself upward using a leaf-shaped artifact, flying away and quickly disappearing into the morning mist.</p><p>The true form inhaled deeply, then vanished, silently following.</p><p>The leaf-shaped artifact carried the avatar through the mountains.</p><p>The avatar wore a simple gray robe, a jade belt cinched at his waist, and a long sword on his back.  The sword was a high-quality artifact, reasonably powerful.  Its unique feature was that Qin Sang had crafted it from a special jade, giving it the ability to become invisible, allowing for surprise attacks.</p><p>Apart from the sword, the avatar's other artifacts were unremarkable, yet still quite good for a wandering cultivator.</p><p>The avatar pinched the coin and put it into his pouch. He gazed towards the Yanmiao Pavilion and murmured, "From now on, my name is Zhang Yue."</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>His gaze and expression were remarkably similar to Qin Sang's.</p><p>After all, they were essentially one.</p>
