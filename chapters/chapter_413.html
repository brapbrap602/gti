<h1>Chapter 406: A Ruse</h1><p>(A new year has finally arrived, I wish everyone good health and all the best!</p><p>Unexpectedly, it's even busier and more chaotic back home.</p><p>I estimate that the updates won't be too regular these few days, but I can definitely guarantee two updates a day, please bear with me! Thank you!)</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted between the chick and the Thunder Orb. The chick itself was quite powerful, and it could also control the Thunder Orb. Trying to forcibly seize the Bloodsoul Mulberry under its watchful eye was definitely not advisable.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, a daring plan formed in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He urged the Ten Yama Banners, and the Yin Soul Threads formed a large net, layers of black fire surging towards the chick.</p><p>Facing the aggressive Yin Soul Threads, the chick showed no fear. Its round eyes darted around, instead flashing with an excited look, like a child who had finally found a toy.</p><p>The chick stood at the edge of the jade pool, motionless like a great general, raising a small, fleshy wing and pointing it at Qin Sang.</p><p>Silver light shimmered on the fleshy wing, and a ball of lightning shot out.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning and the black fire collided.</p><p>Even though the chick hadn't used the power of the Thunder Orb, its peak Demon Spirit stage power was very formidable.  Qin Sang exerted all his strength to maintain the formation, the black fire erupted, bit by bit, painstakingly devouring the lightning.</p><p>When Qin Sang finally extinguished the lightning, he suddenly realized that the chick had vanished from the edge of the jade pool.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled but not panicked. Without a second thought, he decisively redirected the Yin Soul Threads, driving the black fire towards the left side of his body.</p><p>'Slap!'</p><p>A round figure was knocked out of the void by the black fire, tumbling in the air, flapping its small wings before barely managing to stabilize itself.</p><p>Lightning flowed between the chick's feathers. Its Lightning Escape hadn't been fully prepared before Qin Sang discovered it.</p><p>The black fire blazed fiercely, continuing to pursue the chick.</p><p>Forced by the black fire to tumble and dodge in the air, the chick suddenly cried out loud.</p><p>Countless lightning bolts suddenly shot out from the Thunder Orb, but instead of attacking the black fire to rescue the chick, they went straight for the Ten Yama Formation, aiming directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>The chick was not stupid; it knew how to besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. A sneak attack wouldn't work.</p><p>The lightning released by the Thunder Orb was extremely fast, arriving in an instant. Qin Sang also reacted quickly, decisively abandoning the attempt to sneak into the jade pool and retreating rapidly.</p><p>Having escaped the danger, the chick tilted its small head, seemingly puzzled as to how Qin Sang had discovered its tracks.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had observed the Thunder Swallow's battle against the two Nascent Soul cultivators, and he had already understood the Thunder Swallow's abilities. He had anticipated how the chick would react.</p><p>Qin Sang's combat experience far surpassed the chick's. Unfortunately, the difference in strength between them was too great. The chick's cultivation base was significant, and possessing the bloodline of a demon beast, its combat instincts were also strong.</p><p>Coupled with the existence of the Thunder Orb, which disrupted the balance, no amount of combat experience could translate into an advantage.</p><p>The chick didn't use the Thunder Orb to directly kill Qin Sang. It raised its head and spat out a lightning bolt, then its figure vanished again.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly. The chick was using him as a training dummy to hone its combat abilities. The Crimson Pill in his hand was like a death warrant, constantly burning.  He couldn't keep sparring with the chick forever.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang stopped dodging and directly controlled the black fire to clash head-on with the chick.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Loud booms echoed through the cave.</p><p>The chick appeared and disappeared unpredictably, living up to its name as a Thunder Swallow.  Although it was a newborn, its control over lightning was still supernatural. This talent made Qin Sang incredibly envious.</p><p>The Ten Yama Formation trembled. Qin Sang remained motionless, acting as a target, allowing the chick to pummel him.</p><p>The chick hadn't used the Thunder Orb, but its power was substantial.  After just a few hits, the black fire had thinned considerably, and the core formation flags could vaguely be seen, vibrating incessantly, making the formation appear on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The chick had probably never had so much fun. Its chirps became increasingly cheerful, and its small wings flapped more and more frequently, flying erratically around the Ten Yama Formation. However, it remained cautious, keeping a safe distance from Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as the chick was getting carried away, an illusory sword shadow suddenly appeared from the void – the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had secretly controlled the Ebony Sword to lurk in the shadows, finally waiting for an opportunity to strike from an extremely insidious angle.</p><p>The flying sword's speed was astonishing, appearing behind the chick's neck in an instant.</p><p>Just as the sharp sword energy was about to pierce through the chick’s downy feathers, in this critical moment, the chick didn't panic at all. Its round eyes darted around, a cunning glint flashing within them.  It suddenly turned its head, its small yellow beak wide open, a torrent of lightning, accumulated at some unknown point, gushing out.</p><p>The chick's timing was too perfect. At such close range, the Ebony Sword couldn't dodge and was engulfed by the lightning bolt.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Ebony Sword was directly knocked away by the lightning, the spiritual light on its surface dimming for a moment.</p><p>However, the Ebony Sword was Qin Sang's natal flying sword, refined with his mind and spirit. Damage to the sword meant Qin Sang wouldn't be spared either.</p><p>A cry of pain was heard. The already weak black fire instantly dissipated for the most part, almost extinguishing.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure was exposed from within the black fire.  His face was pale, his breath ragged, clearly affected by the damage to his natal flying sword. At this moment, he looked as if he was struggling to maintain the Ten Yama Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang stumbled, glanced at the chick, and with an expression of utter terror on his face, gritted his teeth, hastily gathered his remaining strength, wrapped the Ten Yama Formation around himself for protection, and fled.</p><p>The chick, having not only thwarted the sneak attack but also turned the tables with a counterattack, was in high spirits. How could it allow its toy to escape so easily?</p><p>Immediately, it transformed into a bolt of lightning without hesitation, rushing in front of Qin Sang at a speed even faster than his, blocking his path.</p><p>Almost at the same moment the chick reappeared from its Lightning Escape, the black fire of the Ten Yama Formation suddenly dispersed on its own.  Man and bird were very close, their eyes meeting.</p><p>The chick suddenly realized that the terror on Qin Sang's face was gone, replaced by a playful look.</p><p>His complexion seemed to have grown even paler, but his breath wasn't the least bit ragged.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was made of Dharma treasure material, and with Qin Sang’s meticulous control, how could it be easily damaged?  It was all just a ruse.</p><p>The chick's instincts sensed danger approaching.</p><p>But before it could react, a ghostly wail emanated from within the black fire, followed by a surge of Nine Nether Demonic Flame, even more profound than the black fire, that fiercely rushed towards the chick.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, the chick's already round eyes widened, an uncontrollable panic spreading within them.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Flame engulfed the chick.</p><p>The chick only had time to activate its lightning power, coating its body.</p><p>How could a peak Demon Spirit stage chick withstand the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, which even the Night Fiends feared? The chick shrieked miserably, its cries seemingly laced with sobs.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, showed no mercy.  Because at the same time as the chick's cries, he felt an incredibly terrifying and violent power appear behind him, already within striking distance.</p><p>If struck by this power, Qin Sang had no doubt that he would be instantly obliterated!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.  Fortunately, he had prepared beforehand, hastily shifting his body to dodge.</p><p>But his hands didn't stop moving. The Sky Venom Silk appeared in his palm at some unknown point.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting. Qin Sang steeled his resolve. The spiritual power within his body surged into the Sky Venom Silk without reservation, shattering the top-grade Dharma artifact.</p>
