<h1>Chapter 1225: The Attempt</h1><p>The Primordial Sacred Flame was unruly, wild, and arrogant, exuding an overwhelming aura of dominance. This was Qin Sang's first time coming into close contact with the true form of the Primordial Sacred Flame, allowing him to experience its genuine power. </p><p>The closest he had ever been before was when he refined the Profound Jade near the mountain's peak. Back then, what he had seen and felt was merely an illusory shadow formed by the overflow of the Primordial Sacred Flame. Only now, seeing its true form, did he realize its power far surpassed his previous understanding. Among all the spiritual flames Qin Sang had encountered, the Primordial Sacred Flame ranked second only to the Nine Nether Devil Flame and the Southern Brightness Fire.</p><p>Compared to the true Primordial Sacred Flame, the Winter Nether Cold Flame paled in comparison. Perhaps when the founder of the Azure Sun Devil Sect first sealed it within the Divine Profound Peak, the Primordial Sacred Flame was indeed on par with the Winter Nether Cold Flame, as the sect founder's cultivation level was similar to that of the Winter Nether Sage. The Azure Sun Devil Sect's founder was once the top expert in the Xiaohan Domain's cultivation world, while the Winter Nether Sage had perished during a failed attempt to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Over time, as the Primordial Sacred Flame continuously absorbed the Azure Sun Profound Qi, its power grew exponentially, even undergoing a qualitative transformation. This accumulation of power had reached a point where even the Azure Sun Devil Sect was helpless, and even Xiang Qing could not handle it. The Winter Nether Sage, a figure of the previous generation, had his Winter Nether Cold Flame trapped on a demonic island. After emerging, it was quickly seized by the old devil Mou, leaving it without a constant source of cold flame to devour.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the Primordial Sacred Flame, assessing whether he could subdue it. As an unowned flame, its foundation was the Azure Sun Devil Flame, which was inherently inferior to the Nine Nether Devil Flame. Moreover, it was restrained by the Profound Jade Formation, giving him a good chance.</p><p>"Worth a try," Qin Sang said after a long moment of contemplation, though he left room for doubt.</p><p>Xiang Qing was overjoyed to hear this. Qin Sang's willingness to attempt it far exceeded his expectations. A demon king of Qin Sang's stature would not make empty boasts. No one could guarantee absolute success in subduing the Primordial Sacred Flame. Xiang Qing and Bing Han had tried several times using various secret techniques, nearly suffering backlash each time. They could only restrain the flame here, let alone refine it. Seeing Qin Sang dare to attempt it after witnessing the flame's true form suggested he had some confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the jade platform, summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, and planted them into the ground before sitting down cross-legged. Xiang Qing watched intently, a fire seal clutched in his palm in case Qin Sang provoked the flame and caused chaos. Bing Han stood nearby, her fingers surrounded by fiery energy, a faint fire talisman flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>After setting up the formation, Qin Sang tapped his forehead, summoning a flame seed. The seed, composed of the Nine Nether Devil Flame, took the form of a lotus seed, still ethereal and far from solidifying into a true seed. Both Xiang Qing and Bing Han could sense the aura of the lotus-shaped flame seed, identical to the devil flames within the banners, sparking their curiosity about Qin Sang's flame-controlling techniques. Unfortunately, nothing could be discerned from the seed itself.</p><p>Ignoring them, Qin Sang focused on the Primordial Sacred Flame, activating the devil flames within the banners and using his spiritual sense to guide the flame seed forward. Xiang Qing adjusted the Profound Jade Formation to allow the seed entry while he and Bing Han worked together to suppress the Primordial Sacred Flame.</p><p>Compared to the true form of the Primordial Sacred Flame, the unformed seed seemed insignificant, like a candle flame next to the moon. Fortunately, the other Nine Nether Devil Flames provided enough resistance to withstand the flame's impact. Qin Sang proceeded with extreme caution, carefully controlling the seed's approach.</p><p>The Nine Nether Devil Flame held a hierarchical advantage over the Primordial Sacred Flame, but the effect seemed counterproductive as the flame's movements grew more erratic and its aura more violent. Seeing this, all three tensed up. Qin Sang quickly withdrew the seed, waiting for the flame to stabilize before attempting again, while ordering the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe even the slightest changes in the flame.</p><p>Time passed slowly as the three remained motionless, like wooden statues. Under their coordinated efforts, the flame seed drew closer to the Primordial Sacred Flame. At this point, Qin Sang halted its progress, closed his eyes, and fully activated the *Seed of Golden Lotus* technique, gently casting a series of seals.</p><p>Before long, Xiang Qing noticed with delight that the deep green Primordial Sacred Flame seemed drawn to the seed, forming a protrusion as a wisp of the flame made contact, as if being devoured by the seed.</p><p>Suddenly, the wisp of flame trembled violently, causing the main body to show signs of eruption, threatening to break the formation. The three were alarmed, but their seamless coordination allowed Xiang Qing and Bing Han to stabilize the formation while Qin Sang swiftly withdrew the seed, avoiding the backlash.</p><p>Only when the Primordial Sacred Flame calmed down did the tension on their faces ease.</p><p>"The world is truly full of wonders. Fellow Daoist Mingyue's technique can actually refine an unowned spiritual flame directly. By gradually weakening the Primordial Sacred Flame's power, Fellow Daoist Xiang's task of suppressing it will become much easier. Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Xiang, for finally resolving your sect's long-standing problem!" Bing Han first praised the *Seed of Golden Lotus* technique before congratulating Xiang Qing.</p><p>Xiang Qing's face was filled with joy. Although the first attempt had failed, the signs suggested that Qin Sang's method had a real chance of success.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, I must trouble you to put in the effort during this time!" Xiang Qing clasped his hands toward Qin Sang and then produced a jade slip. "This secret technique is used to refine the Azure Sun Devil Flame and may aid you in refining the Primordial Sacred Flame. Please take a look. However, it is one of the core techniques of our sect's foundational methods, so it is of great importance. I hope you can understand and first make an oath not to disclose it in the future."</p><p>"Refining the essence... is this the technique your sect uses to refine flame seeds?" Qin Sang asked, intrigued.</p><p>Xiang Qing nodded. "Indeed, our sect has passed down flame seeds through generations, but not by direct absorption. Each person's Azure Sun Devil Flame carries their unique imprint, growing alongside the cultivator until the two become one. The Primordial Sacred Flame's aura is far more chaotic, even disordered. By using this technique to refine the flame first, you can reduce its resistance, increasing your chances of success. There's another benefit: directly absorbing another's spiritual flame can quickly boost one's strength but leaves hidden dangers. Refining the flame to retain only its purest essence before absorbing it may not provide immediate gains, but it allows for gradual improvement over time and greatly reduces the risk of future backlash."</p><p>This matter concerned the survival of the Azure Sun Devil Sect. The higher Qin Sang's chances of success, the greater the hope of suppressing the Primordial Sacred Flame. Not only would it resolve the sect's crisis, but Xiang Qing could also enhance his own strength by refining the flame. It was a win-win situation, so Xiang Qing had no reason to withhold the technique.</p><p>After making an oath, Qin Sang eagerly took the jade slip and immersed his spiritual sense into it, quickly scanning its contents. As Xiang Qing explained the technique's purpose, Qin Sang recalled some of his earlier thoughts while cultivating the *Seed of Golden Lotus*.</p>
