<h1>Chapter 1823: The Mirror Surface</h1><p>Mo Xingdao's belongings lacked a key, indicating he had been completely controlled by Hong Yuzi. Not only had he divulged the secret of the Postnatal Spirit Treasure, but he had also surrendered the key.</p><p>This was the worst-case scenario they had anticipated.</p><p>With the key in Hong Yuzi's possession, they either had to slay him outright and seize it, or restrain him long enough to retrieve the treasure quickly.</p><p>The latter, however, carried risks. Their divine abilities might not confine Hong Yuzi for long. Should he escape and interfere, further complications would arise.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint remained silent, her gaze fixed on the battlefield, awaiting Xia Hou's decision.</p><p>She couldn't command Xia Hou, only observe his willingness to engage in a deathmatch with Hong Yuzi.</p><p>Four celestial pillars stood within the lake, their tops reaching towards the bright moon.</p><p>A Dao Court official of the Fourth Rank, and a demon lord following the Heavenly Loach King, known as the second Demon Marquis under his command.</p><p>Neither of these apex cultivators' figures were currently visible.</p><p>Between the pillars, vital energy swirled, black and white energies continuously intertwining, forming a two-toned vortex.</p><p>At the vortex's core, radiant light overflowed, seemingly attempting to pierce through the black and white energies, clearly the precious light emanating from the Nine Revolutions Pearl.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint's eyes shimmered with divine light, discerning the battlefield's situation.</p><p>Xia Hou was nowhere to be seen, only the Divine Deer.  It was unclear whether he had remained merged with the Divine Deer's illusory form or had manifested his true body.</p><p>Atop the Divine Deer's head, two antlers, one black and one white, pulsed with respective lights, the source of the ceaseless black and white energies.</p><p>Complementing each other, the black and white energies fused, generating a peculiar absorbing force.</p><p>The Nine Revolutions Pearl bobbed within the vortex, repeatedly attempting to escape, but was pulled back by the black and white energies, firmly ensnared.</p><p>Meanwhile, like its antlers, the Divine Deer's eyes, one pitch black and the other pure white, gazed upon the black mountain conjured by the Thousand Mountains Pictorial Record, projecting two tangible beams of light.</p><p>Strange patterns surfaced within the light beams, landing upon the black mountain.</p><p>Whether a divine ability of the Divine Deer or a unique treasure, these patterns twisted and contorted, outlining an eye-like shape, and a giant eye was born from nothingness.</p><p>Half black and half white, resembling a Heavenly Eye, it locked onto the black mountain, emitting an invisible force, resisting the mountain's relentless collisions.</p><p>The Divine Deer's true form stood between Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao, employing a strategy of offense and defense, not seeking to kill but to prevent Hong Yuzi from approaching the other battlefield.</p><p>Hong Yuzi stood beneath the Nine Revolutions Pearl. Though his spirit soldiers were damaged, he remained unscathed.</p><p>He brandished his dust whisk with one hand, while the fingers of his other hand formed a wheel, rapidly changing hand seals.</p><p>Almost instantaneously, the Nine Revolutions Pearl shimmered with seven different colors.</p><p>These seven lights, brimming with power, continuously assaulted the black and white energies, finally coalescing into a seven-colored rainbow, fiercely crashing into the vortex's core.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The vortex abruptly solidified, the black and white energies showing signs of dissipation.</p><p>Seeing this, Xia Hou knew the situation was dire. With a furious roar, he spewed a crimson breath, which suddenly contracted, shooting out a red lightning bolt.  With a crack, it pierced the void, striking the Nine Revolutions Pearl.</p><p>Xia Hou's true form reared up, his aura surging.  With a mighty stomp forward!</p><p>A terrifying pressure erupted, warping the void.  A black shadow descended from the sky, a colossal deer leg, descending with void-shattering force.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, seemingly about to be trampled into paste, remained remarkably calm. A strange glint flashed in his eyes as he seized this opportunity, secretly forming a hand seal.  His figure flickered, becoming as ethereal as a shadow.</p><p>The next moment, Hong Yuzi froze, his gaze snapping towards the other battlefield, his face etched with surprise.</p><p>With Xia Hou entangled with him, Mo Xingdao only faced the other Demon Marquis.</p><p>This demon was a minor realm higher than Mo Xingdao. Even if outmatched, Mo Xingdao should have been able to resist for a while.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, finally stabilizing his footing, was preparing a combo secret technique, communicating with Mo Xingdao for a joint attack.  Once unleashed, this technique promised to repel the two demons and break the unfavorable situation.</p><p>Never did he expect Mo Xingdao to be so easily defeated, practically instantly killed by the Demon Marquis!</p><p>This revealed that the ambush was no accident; their opponent undoubtedly knew Mo Xingdao and his weaknesses.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's death worsened Hong Yuzi's predicament, his expression grave.</p><p>Xia Hou, also aware of the other battlefield's outcome, received a transmission from the Azure Fox Saint.</p><p>He stared at Hong Yuzi, his gaze flickering.</p><p>Had he brought reinforcements, he would have chosen to stay and hunt down Hong Yuzi!</p><p>But now, he had to consider the cost of slaying Hong Yuzi and whether it would affect retrieving the treasure.</p><p>Though at a disadvantage, Hong Yuzi still possessed fighting strength, and his spirit soldiers were only injured. Should he resort to sacrificing them and unleashing a desperate technique, its power would be unpredictable.</p><p>Without further hesitation, Xia Hou made his decision, commanding, “Deploy the formation!”</p><p>A flicker of disappointment crossed the Azure Fox Saint's eyes, but she offered no objection, obedient to Xia Hou.  She sprang towards the bright moon.</p><p>Mid-flight, she manifested her fox form, like a celestial fox amidst the moon. Her tails swayed gently, instantly splitting into four fox shadows.</p><p>Bathed in moonlight, lifelike and agile, the fox shadows descended onto the four celestial pillars, assuming a moon-worshipping posture, standing atop the pillars like sculptures.</p><p>Having split her shadows, the Azure Fox Saint's demeanor became slightly listless.  She urged, “Quickly!”</p><p>The Divine Deer, already prepared, leaped with all four hooves, retreating. He forced out a mass of essence blood, dividing it into four, merging each portion into a celestial pillar.</p><p>Four crimson deer shadows emerged within the pillars, coordinating with the fox images, forming a sealing formation.</p><p>Hong Yuzi's expression shifted slightly, sensing impending danger. He directed the Nine Revolutions Pearl and the black mountain to charge outwards, but he was a step too late.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Lake water surged upwards, the bright moon descended, and the sealing formation fully materialized, trapping Hong Yuzi within.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint landed gracefully.</p><p>Xia Hou also reverted to his human form, his face tinged with pallor.  Deploying the formation with essence blood had taken a toll on him, but compared to injury, this price was negligible.</p><p>The sealing formation, jointly cast by the two demons, couldn't severely injure its captive, but its strength lay in its resilience.  Moreover, more and more shadowy figures were drawn towards the demonic blood, throwing themselves into the formation, hindering Hong Yuzi's escape attempts.</p><p>Hong Yuzi's escape was unlikely in the short term!</p><p>“Let's go!”</p><p>Time was of the essence. Xia Hou glanced at the formation and immediately instructed the Azure Fox Saint to lead the way.</p><p>They swiftly withdrew, rapidly traversing the illusory landscape, venturing deeper and deeper.  Soon, they arrived before a peculiar illusion.</p><p>This illusion resembled a mirror, its surface circular, placed horizontally in the void.</p><p>From directly in front, only a thin line was visible.</p><p>Whether above or below the mirror, its surface and the reflected images within could be seen.</p><p>The mirror's surface was perfectly still, and despite their proximity, they felt no sense of danger.</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint pointed at the mirror.</p><p>Xia Hou scanned the surroundings, frowning, “Where is the hall you mentioned?”</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint paused, then said, “I need to see the Nine-tailed Celestial Fox Saint Blood first!”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist still doesn't trust this Marquis?”</p><p>Xia Hou snorted coldly, flicking his sleeve. A jade bottle appeared, held within his grasp.</p><p>Inside the jade bottle resided a crimson pill.  Closer inspection revealed it wasn't a pill, but congealed blood.</p><p>Even through the jade bottle, a faint, unique aura emanated. Sensing this aura, a yearning resonated from within the Azure Fox Saint's bloodline.</p><p>She gazed at the jade bottle, her eyes filled with greed. Taking a deep breath, she declared, “The hall is within the mirror!”</p><p>With that, the Azure Fox Saint took the lead, flying above the mirror, lightly tapping its surface with her toes, creating subtle ripples.</p><p>The next moment, a startling force abruptly erupted.</p><p>Anticipating this, the Azure Fox Saint shifted her footing, effortlessly evading the force.  As the ripples subsided, she tapped the mirror again.</p><p>Chaotic forces seemed to fill the mirror's interior, triggered by the Azure Fox Saint's repeated touches.</p><p>She patiently dodged, persistently interacting with the mirror, soon eliciting a different reaction.</p><p>This time, the ripple's center, defying expectations, formed a suction force, as if an unknown space existed within the mirror.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint nodded towards Xia Hou, forgoing evasion, allowing herself to be drawn into the mirror by the suction.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes gleamed. He followed the Azure Fox Saint into the mirror's space.</p><p>…</p><p>Before their arrival, Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao had already been here.</p><p>“The spatial turbulence caused the surrounding illusions to shift.  I last saw an ancient palace appear within the mirror, accompanied by an incredibly strong suction force that instantly pulled the Five Elements Crown inside…”</p><p>Mo Xingdao gestured towards the mirror below.</p><p>“How do we enter?” Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>Mo Xingdao hesitated, “When the palace gates were open before, I saw a strange rune. I've remembered it, wondering if it's the method to open this place…”</p><p>He had fallen into Hong Yuzi's hands after losing consciousness, and this was his first time returning.</p><p>Mo Xingdao approached the mirror, raising his hand, drawing the rune in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang also examined the mirror, summoning the Heavenly Eye Butterfly and activating its divine ability, attempting to discern the mirror's inner workings.</p><p>However, his efforts were unnecessary. As Mo Xingdao completed the rune and imbued it into the mirror, ripples spread across its surface.</p><p>Then, the mirror flickered with light and darkness, revealing a vortex, deep and swirling with suction.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed into the vortex and instructed, “Fellow Daoist Mo, please transform back into the Kingfisher.”</p><p>With only Nascent Soul realm strength, Mo Xingdao couldn't assist him here and instead required his protection.</p><p>If not for needing Mo Xingdao's guidance, it would be best for him to wait outside.</p><p>Mo Xingdao complied, transforming into a Kingfisher and perching on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Grey Warbler Sword, his body trembling as he stepped into the vortex.</p><p>A sensation of being pulled downwards intensified, his descent accelerating.</p><p>The further he descended, the stronger the suction became, eventually turning into a tearing sensation.  Intermingled with the suction were chaotic forces.</p><p>‘Hummmm…’</p><p>The sword hummed incessantly, sword energies slicing through the space around Qin Sang, warding off the chaotic forces.</p><p>At times, Qin Sang had to evade their onslaught, his progress fluctuating, yet his descent remained swift.</p><p>He continued downwards, following the suction.</p><p>After a while, the light and shadows around him rapidly shifted.</p><p>With a resounding boom, Qin Sang felt as though he had collided with an invisible door, forcing it open.</p><p>The next moment, darkness engulfed him, nearly crashing into a tightly closed palace gate.</p><p>Forcefully steadying himself, his gaze swept across the surroundings, revealing a circular, ancient palace.</p><p>…</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint gently swayed her tails, a soft force enveloping her body.  She gracefully turned, coming to a stop just before the palace gate.</p><p>Xia Hou, following close behind, nearly collided with her, caught off guard.</p><p>A flash of annoyance crossed his eyes, but he refrained from confronting the Azure Fox Saint, his gaze fixed on the ancient palace before them.</p><p>The space within the mirror was remarkably vast, with only this solitary palace suspended in the void.</p><p>Two black palace gates stood before them, tightly shut.</p><p>The palace appeared simple, devoid of ornate decorations, with only two dragon-like patterns carved upon the gates.</p><p>The carvings were crude, easily mistaken for serpents or pythons if not examined closely.</p><p>“The Postnatal Spirit Treasure is kept here?”</p><p>Xia Hou frowned. This palace didn't match his expectations, not resembling a treasure vault.</p><p>“Indeed, but we must open the gates first.” The Azure Fox Saint looked at the two dragon patterns on the gates, sensing the danger they emanated.</p><p>She struck out with a palm, her palm wind hitting the gates squarely.  A soul-shaking roar suddenly echoed.</p><p>Black light erupted from the gates, two black dragons bursting forth.  Covered in black scales, with five claws and dragon horns, they were majestic and imposing, vastly different from their depicted forms.</p><p>These black dragons possessed not only the form of true dragons but also their oppressive aura.  Both demons momentarily froze under the dragons' gaze.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint had already summoned a ring of light before her attack.</p><p>The ring expanded, instantly ensnaring one of the black dragons.  However, a rapid trembling sound immediately followed.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint retreated continuously.</p><p>Xia Hou targeted the other black dragon, his eyes turning black and white as the Heavenly Eye reappeared, its immense pressure locking onto the dragon.</p><p>The black dragon stiffened, its body abruptly sinking, roaring furiously as it struggled against the force.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the two demons, working together, might have subdued the dragons.  But here, the intense suction and chaotic forces hampered their movements.</p><p>“Go open the gate!”</p><p>Xia Hou roared, spewing a red lightning bolt that struck the black dragon attacking the Azure Fox Saint, drawing both dragons' attention.</p><p>Freed from the dragon's assault, the Azure Fox Saint dashed towards the gate, her palms striking repeatedly.</p><p>Yet, the gates remained unmoved.</p><p>Xia Hou, facing both dragons alone, fought fiercely to buy time for the Azure Fox Saint.</p><p>“How much longer?”</p><p>Finally, Xia Hou's patience wore thin, his angry bellow echoing.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint's eyes flickered, and she calmly stated, “It's open!”</p><p>As her words fell, a rumble shook the air, the palace gates swinging open.  Simultaneously, a thunderous boom resounded from behind.</p><p>A look of joy crossed Xia Hou's face.  Black and white energies swiftly formed a vortex above his head.  Caught off guard, the two black dragons stumbled.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Xia Hou broke free and dashed towards the palace gates.  But just as he was about to enter, he deliberately lagged behind the Azure Fox Saint.</p><p>The two black dragons pursued relentlessly, seemingly restricted by a barrier, unable to enter the palace.  They roared furiously outside before flying back towards the stone gates, reverting to their depicted forms.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint stepped into the palace, standing firmly just beyond the threshold.  She pointed towards the center of the palace, “This is the treasure!”</p><p>At the palace's center, a faint, multicolored light swirled. At the heart of the light, a magnificent crown hovered.</p><p>True to her word, the Azure Fox Saint didn't vie for the treasure.  She looked at Xia Hou, “Give me the Saint Blood!”</p><p>At this moment, a subtle fluctuation emanated from her, undetectable even to Xia Hou.</p><p>Only after the Azure Fox Saint entered did Xia Hou cross the threshold, his gaze fixated on the Five Elements Crown, his face alight with elation.</p><p>The instant he stepped into the palace, disaster struck!</p><p>The Five Elements Crown suddenly unleashed a blinding flash of light, hurtling towards Xia Hou's face with such speed that he had no time to react!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
