<h1>Chapter 2003: On the Journey</h1><p>A gust of wind swept across the sea.</p><p>Amidst the azure waves, a white tiger, its body elongated to a grotesque yet strangely agile form, ran across the water's surface.</p><p>The white tiger trod upon the water without leaving a trace, seemingly sprinting with its four legs, but in reality, it was employing a sophisticated遁术, escape technique.  If anyone were present along the white tiger's path, even as it passed by, they would only sense a gentle breeze, unable to discern even its shadow.</p><p>Even cultivators, unless their cultivation was sufficient, couldn't penetrate the white tiger's disguise.</p><p>The white tiger headed due north, leaping effortlessly over entire islands in its path, as if flying across the sea, never deviating for any obstacle.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out the window, seeing only the monotonous seascape. After Li'er set off, the ship fell utterly silent.  The passengers remained in their respective quiet chambers, each, without exception, having set up restrictive formations to isolate themselves from the outside world.</p><p>Their current location was roughly southwest of Gen Province, yet Li'er was heading straight north. It seemed the sea was not peaceful once they left Extreme Heaven Peak.  There would likely be frequent detours to avoid danger, explaining why the journey would take a decade.</p><p>For a Void Refinement cultivator, a decade could often pass in the blink of an eye, perhaps just from comprehending a single divine ability. As long as safety was ensured, Qin Sang didn't mind a slower pace.</p><p>However, he wasn't planning to simply 'sleep' through the journey. He tasked Vermilion Bird with monitoring the outside world, instructing it to wake him if anything novel appeared. After all, one purpose of his travels was to broaden his horizons.</p><p>This also served to memorize the route, which might prove useful for returning to Mooncry Bay in the future.</p><p>Vermilion Bird, well aware of the numerous powerful cultivators aboard the ship, any of whom could crush it with a single finger, was now exceedingly obedient.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly channeled his Dharma Idol's power, controlling a wisp of Azure Roc True Lightning. The lightning power flowed like water into his palm.</p><p>With his current abilities, he could control the Azure Roc True Lightning without leaking the slightest trace of its aura.</p><p>Spreading his palm, the Azure Roc True Lightning gathered in his hand, forming a small pool. Qin Sang gazed at the lightning, silently circulating the Palm Lightning Observation Technique. His eyes shone with a peculiar light, as if this wisp of lightning had birthed an entire world, deeply captivating him. He maintained this posture for a long time, through sunrise and sunset, motionless.</p><p>His mind was completely immersed, oblivious to time and his surroundings.</p><p>With the Azure Roc Dharma Idol combined with the Palm Lightning Observation Technique, Qin Sang experienced the power of True Lightning, reaching a minute level of understanding. He sensed every subtle change, striving to familiarize himself with, control, and utilize it.</p><p>The deeper his comprehension, the more Qin Sang marveled at the profound mysteries of the Azure Roc True Lightning. The Azure Roc that left behind this True Lightning was at least at the Body Integration stage, perhaps even higher, but beyond Qin Sang's current understanding, he couldn't accurately judge. The ancient mighty beings sealed within the Storm Realm were likely no weaker than the Azure Roc.  He wondered what great secrets the Storm Realm held.</p><p>This tiny wisp of True Lightning, when Qin Sang's consciousness delved into it, felt like entering a vast azure ocean composed entirely of lightning. Yet, this wasn't ordinary celestial lightning; it was the unique Demonic Lightning of the Azure Roc divine beast, defying conventional understanding.</p><p>It was like a bottomless abyss, waiting for Qin Sang to explore. Even with the aid of the Azure Roc Dharma Idol and the Palm Lightning Observation Technique, he couldn't touch the ocean floor, only treading the surface layers. The depths remained profound and mysterious.</p><p>Indeed, he could currently use the Azure Roc True Lightning to condense the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, greatly enhancing the power of his lightning techniques. But this was only a superficial application, his understanding of the true principles still rudimentary, much like when he manipulated the Nine Nether Demonic Fire with the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The difference was that the Azure Roc Dharma Idol and the Palm Lightning Observation Technique could guide him, allowing him to gradually approach the ocean floor.  The path ahead was clear, and perhaps he could master this power without reaching an exceedingly high cultivation level.</p><p>Qin Sang's current task was to familiarize himself with the Azure Roc True Lightning as much as possible, making his execution of lightning techniques smoother and swifter.</p><p>Slight ripples appeared on the surface of the azure lightning, condensing into runes. The runes dispersed as soon as they formed, constantly shifting and changing.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed before Qin Sang was abruptly awakened by Vermilion Bird.  His mind returned to his body, and he heard the sound of mechanisms clicking.</p><p>Releasing a strand of divine sense to probe outside his chamber, he immediately sensed the divine senses of the other passengers, clearly alerted by Li'er.</p><p>It turned out Li'er was transforming.  Its white tiger body curled up, mechanisms interlocking, only its chamber remaining stationary while the rest of its form underwent a drastic change, shifting from a tiger into a sphere.</p><p>The sphere's surface was angular, pieced together from countless thin plates, finally covered by a layer of fluff.  This form was entirely devoid of flesh and blood.  It then rose with the wind, ascending towards the sky.</p><p>It was deep night, the moon bright in the sky.</p><p>Li'er flew towards the moon, following the moonlight, stopping only at an extreme altitude.  Then, it continued north.</p><p>Like an inflated bladder, pulled by a beam of moonlight, it hung from the crescent moon, drifting with the wind, its speed greatly reduced.</p><p>There was definitely a reason for this.  Qin Sang looked at the sea below, and soon he made a discovery. The color of the seawater darkened, becoming deeper the further north they traveled, until it was as black as ink.</p><p>He wondered what lay beneath the sea, transforming this area into a sea of ink.</p><p>A hint of vigilance arose in Qin Sang.  Though no abnormalities occurred until dawn, the moment the moon disappeared, Li'er stopped.  Ahead lay a deserted island. Li'er landed on the island, remaining there until nightfall, resuming its journey only when the moon rose.</p><p>Alternating between day and night, resting by day and traveling by night, they journeyed for two months without leaving the Ink Sea.</p><p>Then, one evening, as Li'er was about to take flight, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>"Let me off."</p><p>The other passengers also heard it.  Qin Sang frowned slightly.  He recognized the speaker as the man in the bamboo hat, Wen Sheng.</p><p>This person had always been mysterious. What did he want to do by disembarking here?</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>Li'er hadn't expected anyone to disembark, expressing surprise.  "Honored guest, you cannot disembark here. It will attract dangers from the seabed. Moreover, Li'er cannot wait for a single guest."</p><p>"I no longer wish to go to Gen Province. Am I not allowed to disembark midway?" Wen Sheng questioned in a hoarse voice.</p><p>"Of course you can disembark, but the fare is non-refundable. And it truly is very dangerous here.  Honored guest, are you certain you wish to disembark here?" Li'er kindly reminded him.</p><p>"Open the door."</p><p>Wen Sheng's tone was resolute.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, watching through the window as Wen Sheng, without looking back, flickered momentarily and escaped towards the depths of the Ink Sea.</p><p>With one passenger fewer, as Li'er was about to adjust its structure, Qin Sang suddenly spoke, "Wait! See if this person left anything behind."</p><p>"Indeed, Fellow Daoist is thoughtful," a calm voice echoed in agreement.</p><p>The others immediately understood. Wen Sheng's departure was suspicious. They feared he might be carrying something incriminating, attempting to shift blame onto them.</p><p>Instantly, strands of divine sense swept through Wen Sheng's former chamber, even the places he had walked, leaving no area unchecked.</p><p>"That honored guest didn't go anywhere else," Li'er said timidly.</p><p>Despite finding nothing, no one considered it a wasted effort.  Silence returned to the ship as it continued its journey.</p><p>Finally, they flew out of the Ink Sea. The color of the seawater returned to normal, and Li'er descended from the sky, transforming once more, this time into a ship.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others 'resided' within the hull, its top surface flat except for a single, tall mast.</p><p>The mast bore no flag, standing solitary, with a glittering bell hanging from its top.</p><p>Contrary to its usual behavior, Li'er didn't conceal itself but instead deliberately exposed its presence.</p><p>'Ding-a-ling...'</p><p>As the ship sailed, the light shone for dozens of miles around, as conspicuous as the moon. The melodious ringing of the bell spread far and wide on the wind.</p><p>Accompanied by the bell, they journeyed day and night, encountering no danger, not even a single beast approaching them, as if sailing through a dead sea.</p><p>Qin Sang speculated that the bell was a token of safe passage. Golden Citadel likely had an agreement with some entity in this sea region, allowing them unimpeded travel.</p><p>As expected, until Li'er stowed the bell and transformed into another form, nothing happened.</p><p>In this manner, along the way, Li'er shifted through various forms, employing all sorts of peculiar methods to smoothly navigate different sea regions.</p><p>"Only a major power like Golden Citadel could be so thorough. Even if others memorized this route, they wouldn't be able to pass safely..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly, once again realizing the weight of Golden Citadel's influence.</p><p>Five years after departing from Extreme Heaven Peak, they arrived at an ordinary sea region.  However, Li'er stopped at a small island.</p><p>Everyone initially thought it was a brief stop, similar to the Ink Sea.  Unexpectedly, Li'er remained there for months, showing no sign of departure.</p><p>"Miss Li'er, what are we waiting for?"</p><p>Finally, someone couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"Li'er is waiting for a great tide. The elder instructed that we must wait for the tide, no matter what," Li'er replied.</p><p>"Is there danger ahead?" someone inquired further.</p><p>"Li'er doesn't know what dangers lie ahead. Honored guests, please wait patiently," Li'er tried to reassure them.</p><p>Fortunately, everyone was reasonable. Understanding the reason, they stopped urging and patiently awaited the great tide.</p><p>Several more months passed. They had been waiting idly on the island for nearly a year.  They didn't wait for the tide, but they did wait for an uninvited guest.</p><p>At noon that day, as Qin Sang was comprehending the Azure Roc True Lightning, he felt a sudden inexplicable palpitation and abruptly awoke.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang sensed a powerful aura rapidly approaching.</p><p>The other party made no attempt to conceal themselves.  The surging, overwhelming aura filled the heavens and earth, its target clear, heading straight for the small island.</p><p>"Hiss! Late Void Refinement!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He abruptly stood, looking out the window to see a sudden change in the sea and sky.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A hurricane surged from the sea, waves towering into the sky. A boundless storm engulfed the island, instantly plunging the sky into darkness.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The fierce wind swept across the small island, uprooting trees and sending sand and stones flying.</p><p>A terrifying aura descended.</p><p>Gray winds whipped through the sky. This wasn't an ordinary wind, but a terrifying spiritual wind formed by manipulating the world's spiritual energy, capable of annihilating everything.  Cultivators with slightly weaker strength would be reduced to ashes upon entering this wind.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The small island trembled violently, unable to bear the immense pressure.</p><p>Seawater churned from all directions, gigantic waves rising like mountains, easily capable of shattering the island. The seawater and spiritual wind ultimately formed eight enormous waterspouts, reaching the sky and grounding themselves on the earth, like a colossal cage, imprisoning the island.</p><p>Li'er was the trapped beast within.</p><p>Everyone aboard felt the immense pressure, a wave of unease spreading among them.  However, they remained calm, secretly on guard.</p><p>Facing such celestial might, it was remarkable that Li'er remained composed. It raised its tiger head and spat out a jade token. "Golden Citadel Branch Division Twenty-Ninth Steward Li'er, acting under the orders of Golden Citadel's Third Elder, passing through this area.  Unaware of any offense to Senior, I offer my sincerest apologies and beg for your forgiveness."</p><p>The jade token flew towards the storm, only to be repelled by a gust of wind.</p><p>A human figure faintly appeared atop one of the waterspouts, and a cold snort echoed, "I don't care what your background is. The person I'm looking for was taken by you. Hand him over immediately!"</p><p>Someone seeking revenge had arrived!</p><p>This thought flashed through the minds of Qin Sang and the others.  They simultaneously thought of Wen Sheng, who had disembarked earlier.</p><p>Throughout Mooncry Bay and the other major cultivation worlds, Late Void Refinement cultivators were exceedingly rare. They wondered what Wen Sheng had done to provoke such a powerful individual. No wonder he had been so mysterious.</p><p>"May I ask who Senior is looking for?" Li'er inquired.</p><p>"So much nonsense!"</p><p>A vast divine sense surged forth, attempting to tear through Li'er's protective barrier.</p><p>"Senior, please calm your anger.  This junior means no offense. If that person is on board, Li'er will not obstruct you.  However, the others are all honored guests of Golden Citadel.  Li'er has a duty..."</p><p>Li'er responded urgently, its entire body igniting with pale flames, emitting peculiar fluctuations, daring to resist.</p><p>The divine sense paused momentarily, and the mysterious person snorted coldly, "Do you really think I can't kill you?"</p><p>"Senior could crush Li'er with a single finger, but this is Li'er's duty. If Li'er dies, I will die without regret, believing that the Third Elder will seek justice for Li'er," Li'er's reply was neither subservient nor arrogant.</p><p>Just then, a sigh emanated from one of the quiet chambers.  "Alas, after so many years, Island Master Meng's temper remains as fiery as ever."</p><p>This voice belonged to the person who had earlier agreed with Qin Sang.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The mysterious person focused their attention, recognizing the other's identity. "Why are you here?"</p><p>"My junior brother has secured the position of Sect Master. My remaining here, as the defeated, would only be an eyesore.  I've long wished to travel to the Great Zhou, never expecting to encounter Island Master Meng here," the person in the chamber said faintly. "Is the person Island Master Meng seeks this one?"</p><p>An image of a person wearing a bamboo hat materialized in the void, mimicking Wen Sheng's aura.</p><p>"It's him! Where is he now?" the mysterious person's voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>The person in the chamber sighed, "Island Master Meng has arrived a step too late. This person is cunning and disembarked earlier.  Everyone can testify to this.  Please do not make things difficult for Miss Li'er."</p><p>"Indeed, this one can also testify. I've long heard of Island Master Meng's prestigious name, and finally, I have the honor of meeting you."</p><p>"It is indeed so..."</p><p>"Had we known, we would have certainly detained this person for Island Master Meng."</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone voiced their agreement, describing in detail where Wen Sheng had disembarked, hoping to send this plague god away as quickly as possible.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't know who this Island Master Meng was. Among the few major powers he knew of, there was no such person.  He presumed this must be a reclusive expert.</p><p>As Island Master Meng's figure faded, the cage that had imprisoned the heavens and earth vanished. The wind calmed, and the sea became tranquil.</p><p>"This person's strength far surpasses the Black Roc!"</p><p>This could be considered Qin Sang's first direct encounter with a Late Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Although Island Master Meng wasn't targeting him, the feeling of the world being under the other's control, while he was like a trapped beast, left a deep impression.</p><p>This was a minor interlude. A month after Island Master Meng's departure, a white line appeared where the sky met the sea, and a tide rolled in with a deafening roar. Beneath the surface, currents surged, a vast ocean current flowing through this area.</p><p>The great tide had finally arrived!</p>
