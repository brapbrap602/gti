<h1>Chapter 1852: The Southern Heavenly Gate</h1><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The half-talisman emitted a muffled sound, like a bronze bell.</p><p>All the cultivators, both human and demonic, felt their hearts tremble upon hearing the bell, a strange throb resonating within them.</p><p>The old Daoist reached for the other half of the Imperial Decree before him, but it was too late.</p><p>The half-talisman vibrated violently, the spirit inscriptions sealing it flickering with ethereal light before suddenly bursting into flames, spontaneously combusting, and instantly incinerating their power.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>Two bell tolls rang out, one after the other, so close together they almost merged into a single sound echoing through the auspicious clouds.</p><p>The bell tolls not only tugged at everyone’s hearts but also caused the auspicious clouds to churn, birthing a hurricane out of thin air.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>The wind howled, swirling the clouds.</p><p>The two halves of the talisman almost simultaneously erupted with golden light. The old Daoist’s expression changed drastically, but he was powerless to stop it, watching helplessly as the golden light shot towards the sky.</p><p>The two beams of golden light converged in the void, forming a complete golden character, ‘Decree,’ before everyone's eyes.</p><p>Golden light flowed over the surface of the ‘Decree,’ imbued with divine intent.</p><p>The surrounding phenomena intensified.</p><p>The corners of the middle-aged scholar's mouth curled upwards in a smug smile as he glanced at the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist’s face was grim. Ignoring the enemy's provocation and ceasing further futile actions, he stopped trying to seal the Decree, his gaze fixed on the depths of the auspicious clouds, his expression grave.</p><p>At this moment, all eyes were drawn to the large golden character.</p><p>As the ‘Decree’ materialized, all cultivators present felt an unprecedented, peculiar fluctuation emanating from the depths of the auspicious clouds.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar rose to his feet, hands clasped behind his back as he gazed onward, excitement evident in his eyes.</p><p>Though somewhat unwilling, the old Daoist couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. What wonders awaited them in the legendary Divine Court?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The golden light of the ‘Decree’ intensified, then shattered.</p><p>What followed was unexpected, leaving both humans and demons with bewildered expressions.</p><p>The extraordinary phenomena abruptly subsided, the fluctuations from the depths of the auspicious clouds waning and vanishing in an instant.</p><p>The Grand Elders and Demon Kings, poised to give the order to charge into the Divine Court, were caught completely off guard by this unforeseen turn of events.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar's face paled, his gaze fixed on the half-talisman in front of the old Daoist.</p><p>The old Daoist, realizing the incompleteness of the Decree might be the cause, was not alarmed but rather delighted.  With only four Grand Elders present on their side, they were clearly at a disadvantage. Delaying the inevitable would be to their benefit!</p><p>Secretly issuing orders to be on guard, the old Daoist waved his sleeve, shielding the half-talisman from the middle-aged scholar's covetous gaze, and prepared to retrieve it.</p><p>Just then, another change occurred.</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>The clouds roiled, muffled rumbles like thunder echoing from the depths of the Ritual Platform, as if the earth itself was shaking.</p><p>The weaker demonic soldiers felt their blood surge within them, barely able to maintain their composure.</p><p>Simultaneously, all cultivators felt the entire Ritual Platform tremble!</p><p>This tremor was far more violent than the one caused by the emergence of the Vajra Bodhi Tree.</p><p>The Grand Elders who hadn't yet arrived hastened their pace, fearing the demons might beat them to it.</p><p>Grand Elder Liu glanced at Grand Elder Zuo, who sat meditating beside him, his heart filled with anxiety.</p><p>Grand Elder Zuo was severely injured, and healing would take time. He feared he wouldn’t make it in time.</p><p>Indeed, as the tremors intensified, Grand Elder Zuo’s eyelids merely fluttered; he did not awaken.</p><p>At the bottom of the sea of blue light, Qin Sang and the demons also sensed the anomaly.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was weaving through the waves of light, paused, sensing for a moment before looking up towards the surface.</p><p>Since the tremors originated from outside and were unrelated to the Vajra Bodhi Tree, Qin Sang didn't pay much attention, glancing briefly before returning his focus to the task at hand.</p><p>However, this tremor was clearly extraordinary. Grand Elders and Demon Kings were severing their cultivation to enter the platform. Matters were more complex than he had imagined. It was best to obtain the Vajra Fruit quickly and return to his cave dwelling.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang moved even faster.</p><p>In the distance, Demon King Lingyou and the other demons also stopped, looking up.</p><p>“Your Highness, Prince Yan and the others might have found the entrance to the Divine Court,” Marquis Dingxiang whispered.</p><p>Demon King Lingyou’s expression remained indifferent. He hummed in acknowledgment, unconcernedly withdrawing his gaze and continuing to guide the Stygian Wave forward.</p><p>Watching Demon King Lingyou’s receding figure, a hint of helplessness flashed in Marquis Dingxiang’s eyes. He did not agree with the Demon King’s approach.</p><p>The struggle for the Divine Court was not merely a matter of merit, but one that concerned the Great Dao itself.</p><p>If they could control the Divine Court and restore the Gangshan Governance Seal’s connection to it, its power would be fully restored. Whether they chose the path of divinity or continued their previous cultivation, they would no longer be limited by the Governance Seal, and their future would be limitless.</p><p>The implications were clear, and Marquis Dingxiang believed Demon King Lingyou understood them.</p><p>If they could achieve great merit, earning the Great Sage's favor and generous rewards, perhaps Demon King Lingyou would be the next to ascend to Great Sagehood.</p><p>One person’s ascension benefits all those connected to them – it was the natural order of things.</p><p>Yet, he had chosen to follow a Demon King with no grand ambitions.  Marquis Dingxiang sighed inwardly, following closely behind with the other Demon Marquises.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Waves of tremors assaulted them.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic clouds, the old Daoist and the middle-aged scholar temporarily abandoned their conflict.</p><p>Soon, both humans and demons saw golden light spreading from the depths of the Ritual Platform.</p><p>They had witnessed countless scenes of golden light filling the sky these past few days, but this time was different.</p><p>The golden light was gentle, like a soft breeze as it washed over them, instilling a sense of serenity.</p><p>Then, they saw radiant light rising from within the golden light, revealing a strange spectacle.</p><p>Its outline resembled a divine gate.</p><p>Even before its true form was revealed, myriad golden rays painted the sky with crimson rainbows, and a thousand strands of auspicious energy sprayed purple mist. Three clusters of golden light atop the gate’s outline were particularly striking, resembling three large golden characters.</p><p>Beyond the divine gate, rosy clouds shimmered, and the azure expanse was hazy, hinting at celestial palaces and magnificent halls, as if it led to a celestial realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to the distance, no matter how wide they opened their eyes or how they utilized their Dharma Eyes, they couldn’t see clearly.</p><p>For a moment, all the cultivators, both human and demonic, were captivated.</p><p>“Could this… Could this be the legendary Southern Heavenly Gate?”</p><p>The old Daoist gripped the half-talisman in his hand, feeling it vibrate, as if struggling to break free and fly towards the celestial realm beyond the divine gate.</p><p>“It truly is the Divine Court… The great chaos at the Ritual Platform over a hundred years ago was indeed a sign of the Divine Court’s emergence…”</p><p>Grand Elder Ruoquan murmured, finally believing it to be true.</p><p>When she heard the rumors of the Divine Court’s imminent appearance, she had not fully believed them. Even if these Daoist legends were real, the sudden emergence of the Divine Court after countless years of dormancy naturally aroused suspicion.</p><p>As far as she knew, after the chaos at the Ritual Platform over a century ago, the Dao Court had dispatched people to investigate, finding no anomalies.</p><p>Decades after the chaos, the Decree appeared out of nowhere, and it was the Ghostfang Kingdom that discovered it first, not the Daoists who had created the Divine Court.</p><p>Later, the Dao Court had sent people with half of the Decree into the Ritual Platform multiple times, but nothing unusual occurred. It was through other means, taking nearly a century, that they confirmed the residual aura within the Decree was related to the Divine Court.</p><p>From the discovery of the Decree to the confirmation of its origins, demons were involved every step of the way.</p><p>Now, witnessing the legendary Southern Heavenly Gate with her own eyes, she couldn’t help but believe.</p><p>The location of the Southern Heavenly Gate corresponded with the origin of the chaos at the Ritual Platform over a hundred years ago, clearly indicating a connection.</p><p>Grand Elder Ruoquan could hardly contain her excitement.  Those who weren’t Grand Elders couldn't understand the extent of their suppressed feelings – a feeling of having a path but not daring to tread it, a feeling of seeing no future.</p><p>Finally, a glimmer of hope appeared!</p><p>Just then, the golden light began to recede, and the image of the celestial realm gradually blurred.</p><p>The Grand Elders' hearts tightened, fearing the Southern Heavenly Gate would vanish in a fleeting moment, their hopes dashed.</p><p>However, the half-talisman in the old Daoist’s hand continued to tremble, providing them with a clear direction.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a command from the old Daoist, the giant black sword of Qi changed direction and pierced through the clouds.</p><p>The demons were not to be outdone. They formed a battle formation around the middle-aged scholar, several Demon King Dharma Bodies arrayed in all directions, leading the Demon Marquises as they soared through the air, their speed matching the giant sword.</p><p>As they flew, those within both camps who knew the details exchanged information covertly.</p><p>“Is that the legendary Southern Heavenly Gate?”</p><p>“His Highness said the Southern Heavenly Gate is the entrance to the Divine Court.  However, although this gate is wondrous, why does it seem… incomplete?”</p><p>“Didn't His Highness say the Divine Court was cast down from the Nine Heavens, collapsing upon the world? The Southern Heavenly Gate must have borne the brunt of the impact.  What's so strange about it being incomplete?  I fear the inside is also in ruins.”</p><p>“Even if it’s in ruins, it’s still the Divine Court. The Great Sage’s Mansion surely has a way to restore it, otherwise, why would so many Princes willingly sever their cultivation…”</p><p>Humans and demons alike harbored their own thoughts as they traversed the layers of illusions.</p><p>If Qin Sang were present and saw the direction they were heading, he would undoubtedly be shocked.</p><p>The location of the Southern Heavenly Gate seemed to be near the illusions of the Crimson Gold Spirit Needle and the Ancient Mirror!</p><p>…</p><p>Unaware of this, Qin Sang continued to traverse the bottom of the sea of light, focused on finding the Vajra Bodhi Tree.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>As the external tremors ceased, the sea of light began to tremble once more.</p><p>The impact on Qin Sang was even more violent than before. He could only do his best to resist the waves of light, lest he be pushed too far away, rendering his previous efforts futile.</p><p>His figure bobbed up and down within the waves of light, unable to find stable footing.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Celestial Eye Butterfly to stay vigilant, diverting a sliver of his consciousness to sense the waves of light, attempting to find a pattern within the chaos.</p><p>This was inspired by Demon King Lingyou.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang’s current location could already be considered the source of the tremors.</p><p>The source wasn't a single point, but a vast area at the bottom of the sea of light. The scenery here was monotonous, devoid of any landmarks, requiring him to search inch by inch.</p><p>Qin Sang had already explored for some time, with little success in finding the Vajra Bodhi Tree.</p><p>Demon King Lingyou and the other demons were also here.  Because of Qin Sang, they dared not split up.  Furthermore, since Qin Sang was deliberately avoiding them, the two sides hadn't encountered each other.</p><p>As time passed, the power of the light waves reached its peak. Qin Sang had a sudden realization, patiently waiting until the tremors subsided to a tolerable level.</p><p>With a flap of his phoenix wings, he chose a direction and soared through the air.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw a deep blue line appear in the distance.</p><p>The blue line wasn't straight, but winding, with no visible ends. As he drew closer, he could see light and darkness alternating at the blue line, waves of impact surging towards him. The waves of light were emanating from this blue line.</p><p>It resembled a deep trench, continuously spewing forth torrents.</p><p>Qin Sang headed straight for the blue line. As he approached, his expression shifted slightly, and he turned to look at the other end of the blue line.</p><p>Even with his Celestial Eye power at full strength, he could only vaguely discern a Stygian Wave disappearing into the blue line.</p><p>“Such speed!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank.  That Stygian Wave could only belong to Demon King Lingyou.</p><p>He had assumed Demon King Lingyou would be slowed by the need to regroup his scattered Demon Marquises, but he hadn't expected him to be even faster.</p><p>The methods of a Demon King were truly unfathomable!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, but he had no intention of retreating.  With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, he arrived at the blue line in an instant.</p><p>Before him was a blue fissure, its interior filled with swirling blue light, like a mysterious blue valley.</p><p>Waves of light continuously surged from the valley, as if trying to push him away.</p><p>The force of the light waves weakened with each surge, and the valley was rapidly closing.</p><p>Clearly, when the valley closed, the sea of light would temporarily stabilize.  When the valley opened, it would cause the sea of light to tremble.</p><p>However, how many more times could the valley open?</p><p>Once the valley was completely sealed, could those inside still come out?</p><p>These questions arose in Qin Sang’s mind, but no one could answer them.  These were the risks one had to bear in pursuit of treasures.</p><p>He was always cautious, yet when opportunity presented itself, he never lacked courage and determination, which had led him to where he was today.</p><p>His gaze hardened, and without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged into the blue valley!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Only after entering did Qin Sang realize the interior of the valley was far more chaotic than the outside.  He was immediately struck by three converging waves of light, as if hit by three giant hammers simultaneously.</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator would have been crushed into a pulp.</p><p>The Bright Mountain Armor radiated brilliant light. Qin Sang’s arms trembled as he unleashed powerful punches, shattering the waves of light in front of him and breaking free.</p><p>His vision was filled with surging waves of light, an endless expanse of deep blue, but he couldn’t see any tangible objects.</p><p>The valley seemed to be a void, its boundaries unknown. Searching for a tree here was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Spiritwood Body, sensing for a moment.  Finding no Wood Spirit Qi nearby, he continued to descend, intending to reach the bottom of the valley first.</p><p>He weaved through the gaps between the waves of light, a strenuous endeavor.</p><p>However, Qin Sang considered this a good thing. It would be difficult for the demons to maintain their formation here unless Demon King Lingyou continuously utilized his great divine powers, willingly enduring the expenditure.</p><p>The valley seemed bottomless, and the demons likely had to split up to search as well.</p><p>He probably didn’t need to worry about facing a group of demons at once.</p><p>Descending for an unknown distance, a point of light suddenly flashed before his eyes.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he charged towards it, immediately spotting a bubble bobbing amidst the waves of light.</p><p>He had seen such bubbles outside the valley, but only fleetingly.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to approach, he noticed cracks appearing on the bubble’s surface, indicating its imminent rupture.  He paused, activating his Celestial Eye power to observe.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he saw a mountain within the bubble, lush with greenery. Near the summit was a thatched hut with its door ajar.</p><p>The scene within the bubble was remarkably realistic, every tree appearing lifelike.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The bubble burst, and the image of the mountain and hut vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly moved forward, focusing his senses.  The burst bubble left no trace behind.</p><p>It was all like a fleeting dream.</p><p>He didn’t understand, but he suppressed his doubts for the moment and continued his descent.</p><p>Gradually, he encountered more and more bubbles.</p><p>Each bubble contained an almost realistic scene, yet each was different.  There were mountains, rivers, plains, deserted villages, and even palaces and pavilions – a myriad of landscapes, but devoid of any living beings.</p><p>If they were real, why would they vanish without a trace when the bubbles burst?</p><p>If they were illusions, why were the details so vivid and lifelike?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A wave of light surged towards him, carrying a bubble within its embrace.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, seeing an octagonal pavilion within the bubble, its pillars adorned with exquisite murals.</p><p>He approached the bubble and reached out, expecting to grasp at nothing, as he had several times before.</p><p>The next moment, his expression changed slightly as he abruptly retracted his hand. He felt a weight in his palm, finding himself holding a red tile, clearly from the octagonal pavilion’s roof.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The bubble burst, and the pavilion vanished.</p><p>Still, it left no trace behind, except for the tile in his hand!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
