<h1>Chapter 1744: Blood Sun</h1><p>The Wu tribe, the weakest of the three, desperately needed time to recover and rebuild.  They most certainly did not want another war. Qin Sang’s intervention in mediating the conflict was perfectly aligned with the Wu tribe's wishes, encountering virtually no opposition.  Elder Fang deliberated briefly with a few Wu elders, then immediately made his decision. Though currently confined to a small territory, the Wu tribe had ruled the Canglang Sea far longer than the human race, possessing knowledge of many secrets unknown to humans; this made them especially valuable to Qin Sang.</p><p>The meeting concluded amicably, but they still needed to wait for Elder Fang to inform the various factions and locate the items Qin Sang required. Qin Sang stayed at Mount Wushen that night.</p><p>A protective barrier enveloped Mount Wushen, shielding it from the lightning.  Within the courtyard, shadows danced, but even looking up, Qin Sang could still see the streaks of silver lightning arcing across the sky.</p><p>At that moment, someone approached the courtyard. It was Elder Fang. “True Cultivator Qin summoned me.  What is your business?”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, produced a jade slip he had prepared, and sent it over.</p><p>Elder Fang was slightly surprised. He took it, glancing at it; instantly, he was completely engrossed, finally tearing himself away with difficulty.  He took a deep breath.  “Thank you for this generous gift, True Cultivator. I hardly deserve it. What are your instructions? Please speak plainly.”</p><p>The jade slip contained the divine runes Qin Sang had learned from Gui Mu. One was especially unique—a trace taken from Gui Mu's physical body after her ascension.  While Elder Fang might not possess Gui Mu's abilities in refining a physical body using these runes, a complete understanding would be incredibly beneficial to him in his current state.</p><p>“I have no other requests, only a few medicinal herbs. They're all listed there,” Qin Sang said, his eyes on the jade slip.</p><p>Overwhelmed by joy, Elder Fang had overlooked the list.  He quickly checked again. Seeing that most were herbs beneficial to spirit insects, he understood Qin Sang was cultivating them.  He mused, “Our tribe’s collection should have most of them, but we lack a Sky Centipede Root.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, “Do you also have the Stillwater Lotus?”</p><p>The Sky Centipede Root and Stillwater Lotus were two of the three main ingredients for the Qingshuang Pill. He had already obtained the Hundred Insects Grass.</p><p>From Elder Fang’s tone, it seemed he could supply the missing auxiliary herbs and the Stillwater Lotus.</p><p>Seeing Elder Fang’s affirmative response, Qin Sang rejoiced.  He only needed the Sky Centipede Root to complete the Qingshuang Pill!</p><p>Although he wasn’t ready to push the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to its fifth transformation yet, refining the Qingshuang Pill was still a positive step.</p><p>He had already asked before; the Wu tribe didn’t have the herbs needed for superior Spirit-Calming Incense.  Obtaining these herbs was at least some consolation.</p><p>Elder Fang immediately ordered his trusted subordinates to retrieve the herbs. He subtly inquired about the origin of the runes. Qin Sang, unable to reveal Gui Mu's identity, vaguely deflected the question, leaving Elder Fang considerably disappointed.</p><p>Shortly after, the herbs arrived.  Qin Sang accepted them.  After everyone else withdrew, he swiped his finger across his storage ring, presenting the Star Platform. “Elder Fang, do you recognize this object?”</p><p>He had just tested it in the room; the Star Platform hadn’t shown any reaction.</p><p>Elder Fang looked at the Star Platform, initially puzzled. Then, as if remembering something, he abruptly stood up, exclaiming, “This object…”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes at Elder Fang. He noticed the Star-Winged Cicada, usually hidden within Elder Fang's mind palace, seemed to have been awakened and was staring intently at the Star Platform.</p><p>Aware of Qin Sang's gaze, Elder Fang instinctively looked over. Their eyes met, and Elder Fang felt as if his thoughts were being seen through.  He felt a chill, understanding that Qin Sang wouldn’t let the matter rest unless he revealed the truth.</p><p>Hesitating slightly, he bowed.  “True Cultivator, this object strongly resembles a treasure depicted in a mural on the wall of our tribe’s sacred mountain shrine. We’ve been searching for it for a long time without success.  Unexpectedly, you have obtained it.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the mountaintop, where an ancient stone hall stood. “Is that the Wushen Shrine? Since this treasure is related to the shrine, what power does it possess?”</p><p>“Since the shrine became our sacred hall, it has been the site of our tribe’s grand ceremonies.  However, the shrine itself hasn’t shown any supernatural powers.  We don't even know if the treasure depicted in the mural actually exists, let alone its abilities,” Elder Fang replied.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him intently. “May I enter the shrine to take a look?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Elder Fang nodded.</p><p>Both possessed exceptionally high cultivation levels, so they reached the shrine without alarming anyone.</p><p>The shrine held more symbolic than practical value; it didn't contain any extraordinary treasures and thus lacked strong protective barriers.</p><p>Elder Fang opened the shrine, and Qin Sang stepped inside. Lightning illuminated the interior.</p><p>The hall was built of square stones. Crude walls featured a vibrantly colored mural.</p><p>The lines were straight, the brushstrokes simple, yet it possessed an ancient and majestic beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently. He saw that the mural depicted a group of people gathered before a stone hall, and there seemed to be some writing, but it had long been erased.</p><p>The stone hall was the shrine they found themselves in.  The figures in the murals were sketched with just a few strokes, lacking distinct features, making it impossible to tell if they depicted members of the Wu tribe or humans.</p><p>Inside the shrine, a person stood with their back to the others, bowed before a circular stone altar.  Starlight poured from the altar, reaching towards the heavens.</p><p>That was the entirety of the mural.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down. The ground was smooth, without any pits, but it was engraved with complex, indecipherable patterns.  In the center of the patterns was a circle, the exact size of the star altar in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>He carefully examined the patterns.  The dots and lines seemed to be some kind of unfamiliar rune.  After studying them for a while without understanding, he glanced at Old Master Fang, hesitated no longer, and sent the star altar towards the center, propelled by his true energy.</p><p>Before it landed, Qin Sang sensed something unusual. His gaze sharpened.</p><p>The star altar seemed to be drawn downwards, falling directly onto the ground.  The ground shook violently.  Instantly, starlight blazed; not only the altar but the entire pattern on the ground shone brightly, an inexplicable rhythm flowing between them, making the shrine seem dreamlike.</p><p>Qin Sang and Old Master Fang exchanged a look of surprise, both secretly on guard against any unforeseen changes.</p><p>Then, a familiar feeling washed over him.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly looked up, utterly astonished.  He could see the Milky Way, the vast starry sky, with his naked eyes.</p><p>The shrine's ceiling and the clouds and thunder in the sky had disappeared. Thousands of stars seemed to be directly above them, shimmering brightly. And this was no illusion!</p><p>The starlight pulsed, like breathing, echoing something else.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze, fixing it on the star altar.  Now, the entire altar had become one with the ground pattern, autonomously gathering starlight.  The ethereal light spread along the pattern throughout the shrine.</p><p>The two subconsciously took two steps back, to the shrine entrance.</p><p>Looking up again, they saw that the dark clouds and lightning were still there, yet the other Nascent Soul cultivators practicing in the Wushen Mountain cave dwelling remained oblivious!</p><p>Qin Sang moved his lips, about to ask something, when he saw the changes inside the shrine suddenly accelerate.</p><p>One after another, runes were illuminated by the starlight, jumping out from the ground like living things, writhing like earthworms.</p><p>Countless runes floated up, filling the shrine, all composed of starlight, scattering brilliance.</p><p>In an instant, the runes solidified. Fine threads of starlight appeared between them, eventually connecting to the star altar.  With the altar as the center, they formed an incredibly complex array.</p><p>As soon as the array was formed, the stars in the sky seemed to sense it, suddenly brightening. Starlight poured down, the threads tightening, pulling the runes together, quickly forming small circular platforms of light that floated in the air—miniature versions of the star altar.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the arrangement of the altars. There were twenty-eight of them, corresponding to the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, a celestial array.</p><p>No, there were twenty-nine!</p><p>The star altar had become completely transparent, seeming to be made entirely of starlight.</p><p>By this time, the shrine had stabilized, but the array's function remained unclear. Qin Sang subtly sensed the energy within, his expression shifting.</p><p>Old Master Fang looked over.  "True Lord?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, nodding slightly.</p><p>Old Master Fang immediately produced twenty-nine mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p>He and Qin Sang had both sensed it: the twenty-eight floating platforms were likely meant for the spirit stones, including the main star altar, whose surface starlight had a gap.</p><p>The array's purpose was unknown; they would start with low-grade stones.</p><p>Old Master Fang flicked his fingers.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>The stones fell into place.</p><p>A dazzling light filled the shrine. As the two stood on alert, the light dimmed and returned to normal.</p><p>Looking at the spirit stones on the platforms, they were all pale and cracked, their luster gone, their spiritual energy completely drained.</p><p>Old Master Fang wasn't surprised, about to take out high-grade stones.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed brilliantly.  "Wait!"</p><p>Old Master Fang paused, then saw Qin Sang send out several streams of light, transforming into eight large banners that he planted in the eight directions of the shrine.  The banners waved, releasing a thick white mist that sealed the shrine.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang must have discovered something, Old Master Fang didn't ask, sending out his high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>The high-grade stones were indeed different. The array's brilliance persisted. Qin Sang faintly felt a strange fluctuation, connecting to a distant star palace.</p><p>Looking at the shrine ceiling, the thousands of stars seemed to be drawn to the array, moving closer to the ground.  Starlight filled the shrine like an abyss, powerful star energy flowing through the array.</p><p>Qin Sang and Old Master Fang both had the illusion that they were being pulled towards the stars, sensing a vast, boundless feeling.</p><p>Before they could fully appreciate it, they heard a 'crack'.</p><p>Two men's faces changed, and they quickly looked towards the center of the star array.  They saw that the spirit stones in the twenty-eight constellations were intact, but the one on the central star platform was cracked.</p><p>Fang quickly tried to replace the spirit stone, but it was too late. The star array's energy went haywire, with a loud boom.  Twenty-eight high-grade spirit stones shattered simultaneously, and a violent energy nearly destroyed the formation, almost toppling the shrine.</p><p>Looking at the chaotic shrine, Qin Sang didn't act hastily. He stopped Fang, who was rather anxious. "Are there any top-grade spirit stones in the mountain?"</p><p>"Top-grade spirit stones?"</p><p>Fang was stunned. He had intended to try maintaining the array with a few more high-grade stones.  Qin Sang's words implied that only top-grade ones would do!</p><p>Top-grade spirit stones are extremely rare. Cultivators consider them invaluable treasures.  Even a top-tier spirit mine might not produce one, and they are few and far between throughout a region.</p><p>Even if the Wu tribe once had a collection, after numerous battles, they now possess none.</p><p>The Wu tribe's legacy includes several incredibly powerful ancient formations.  Activating them would make both humans and demons wary, but they all require top-grade spirit stones, so they are kept unused.</p><p>Humans and demons are likely in a similar situation.</p><p>That this array required top-grade spirit stones greatly diminished Fang's hopes. He frowned and asked, "True Master, can you tell the origin of this array?"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, "After a long search, I found it unexpectedly!"</p><p>"What? This is the Ascension Platform?"</p><p>Fang was both surprised and delighted, taking a deep breath to compose himself before asking, "Why is this array different from your description, True Master?"</p><p>"Indeed, it is different," Qin Sang nodded. "May I ask, what is the origin of this shrine?"</p><p>Fang hesitated for a moment, then revealed a secret.</p><p>It turns out that whether Wushan and the Wushu Shrine were truly where the Wu God resided is still debated. One theory is that during times of unrest within the Wu tribe, the current Grand Shaman used the Wu God's name to stabilize the people.</p><p>But regardless of truth or fiction, the sacred site's status in the hearts of Wu cultivators was unshakeable.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. No wonder he couldn't find obvious Wu tribe markings on the formation; even the Wu tribe wasn't certain.</p><p>He looked up at the sky and said softly, "This array shouldn't be called the Ascension Platform;  'Conduction Platform' would be more appropriate!"</p><p>When the star array was activated earlier, he had a familiar feeling. It was similar to when the Ghost Mother broke through the boundary and flew into the sky, which is why he was so certain.</p><p>A mysterious power seemed to be emanating from deep within the star sea, resonating with the star array, particularly noticeable just before the spirit stones shattered.  The Ascension Platform showed no such phenomenon.</p><p>This world was clearly communicating using stellar energy, even using it to build a starlight channel to break through the barrier. No wonder the star platform could draw on the stars.</p><p>Qin Sang was now both pleased and worried.</p><p>He was pleased that his efforts had paid off; after traveling across many regions, he had finally found a way out.  Moreover, if this was a Conduction Platform, it should be easier than an Ascension Platform.</p><p>He was worried about who would be conducting the transfer.</p><p>One thing was certain: he was no match for them. If it were a powerful human cultivator or a Wu cultivator allied with the Ghost Mother, it would be fine. But if it were a demon or a monster, he would be escaping one cage only to enter another.</p><p>While he pondered, the shrine calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the star array, his mind stirred.  His true energy formed a hand that reached out and grasped the star platform. With a resounding clang, he pulled the platform out piece by piece.</p><p>Without the star platform, the shrine became an ordinary stone hall.  Qin Sang had already memorized the star array and the runes in the pattern, and he prepared to make a copy.</p><p>Putting away the star platform, he saw Fang about to speak. Qin Sang said solemnly, "The origins of this array are unclear. I will investigate. If we can determine its origins, you will have a place when the time comes to ascend."</p><p>Fang looked pleased, about to say something when Qin Sang stopped him with a wave of his hand. "Although this place is a Wu tribe shrine, and may be this world's only way out, it cannot be monopolized by the Wu tribe. I will set up a large formation in the shrine.  In the future, regardless of origin or race, everyone will ascend from here.”</p><p>"From now on, this mountain will be a sacred site of this world. Our tribe swears to protect this sacred site, treating all cultivators equally, without any restrictions,” Fang immediately understood the benefits. The Wu tribe would become guardians, with the True Master's decree, who would dare to provoke them?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. "Send word to Palace Master Bao and the Sea of Demons. You must work together to discover the shrine's origins and collect top-grade spirit stones. I will return to Central State soon, and will also summon cultivators from other regions to search ancient texts.  I will be back within a hundred years at most."</p><p>Not that he only had one top-grade spirit stone; even if he had more, he couldn't act rashly.</p><p>Extremely rare high-grade spirit stones; not a single one can be wasted.  The exact purpose of the star array beyond summoning is unknown, so preparations must be made in advance.</p><p>Even if I decide to take this path, I must enhance my adaptability before ascension.  The Kirin Origin Seed and the Taiyi Star Chart plans haven't been completed, so Qin Sang isn't in a hurry.</p><p>……</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>A streak of light flew out of the Witch God Continent, heading west. Qin Sang prepared to immediately return to Central State and make arrangements.</p><p>He already knew the locations of the various states and could take a shortcut, without strictly following the nautical chart.</p><p>Top clans in Central State must have high-grade spirit stones in their treasuries.  At least, the first batch of ascendants should be guaranteed access to them.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about a lack of scouts; those nearing the end of their lifespans would certainly volunteer to be the vanguard.</p><p>However, the separation between the two realms might greatly limit their usefulness.</p><p>Regardless, finding the summoning platform would be good news for him and Liuli.</p><p>This trip was truly worthwhile; he now has more options!</p><p>As he pondered, Qin Sang flew across the ocean, briefly stopping at the Riftwind Islands.</p><p>The Peach Blossom Island where Elder Qingzhu had once resided had a new owner. Qin Sang didn't reveal himself, only paying his respects from afar.</p><p>Flying out of the Riftwind Islands, he was close to the storm belt.</p><p>"If I had the time, I could look for shelters and create a sea route, allowing high-level cultivators to travel to the Canglang Sea.  However, high-grade spirit stones are ultimately limited; it's just a thought..."</p><p>Qin Sang mused. With the Witch tribe's divine transformation nautical chart, it wouldn't take much effort, just some time.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The storm was no longer a threat to him. Qin Sang casually activated his protective spiritual energy, without stopping, and passed through the barrier, rushing into the storm belt.</p><p>Not long after flying, Qin Sang suddenly felt something was wrong, waking from his reverie, and abruptly looked up.</p><p>The surrounding storm had inexplicably turned blood-red.  In the heavens, a blood moon appeared out of nowhere, initially blurry, but growing increasingly clear, piercing the storm and shining upon this place!</p><p>Illuminated by the blood moon, Qin Sang immediately felt a chill, experiencing an instinctive tremor.</p><p>Even more shocking, as the blood moon gradually took shape, demonic sounds in his ears became increasingly frantic and urgent.  If not for the jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang would have had to fight back with all his might against the onslaught of madness.</p><p>It seemed the blood moon was the source of the demonic sounds!</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>Zhuque shrieked, also sensing the threat.</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to think, hastily retreating.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as he retreated to the Canglang Sea, the blood light pursued him, the twisted blood light covering the barrier, forming a blood curtain before Qin Sang.  Twisted by the storm, it seemed covered in countless bloodworms, causing nausea.</p><p>Even having escaped, the demonic sounds showed no sign of weakening.</p><p>Then, an even more terrifying scene unfolded.  ‘Bloodworms’ were actually penetrating the barrier.</p><p>The barrier that had protected countless cultivators of this realm for years, had been pierced!</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, seeing an even more horrifying sight: a trace of blood light appeared at the edge of the moon high above.</p><p>"Do you know what this is?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, asking Zhuque.</p><p>"I've never seen anything like it…"</p><p>Zhuque's voice trembled, "We're going to die!"</p><p>Qin Sang, however, coldly snorted. Seeing more and more 'bloodworms' seeping in, he no longer hesitated, immediately revealing his phoenix wings, activating his thunder escape technique, and breaking through the air to flee.</p><p>He didn't know the origin of the blood moon, but it was certainly related to the demonic sounds.</p><p>Qin Sang was self-aware; even with the jade Buddha, he was absolutely no match for it in a single confrontation. Yet, it clearly had its eyes on him, and could even pierce the barrier to pursue him.</p><p>No matter what, he must not fall into the hands of this demonic entity!</p><p>A lightning bolt cut across the night sky beneath the moon.</p><p>At this moment, elsewhere in the Canglang Sea, others also noticed the moon's abnormality.</p><p>From the initial trace of blood light, it gradually spread across the full moon, eventually engulfing more than half of it. More terrifyingly, as the moon set and the sun rose, even the sun was infected, spreading blood-red sunlight.</p><p>"Could it be the legendary celestial dog devouring the sun?"</p><p>"Blood-red… what kind of demon is this! The sun and moon are being swallowed, could this be the legendary apocalyptic calamity?"</p><p>…</p><p>For a time, the entire Canglang Sea was filled with fear and anxiety; both mortals and cultivators were terrified.</p><p>On Witch God Mountain.</p><p>Old Master Fang, leading a group of elders, flew out of the range of the dark clouds, looking at the sky with worried expressions.</p><p>They didn't understand what this celestial phenomenon represented, whether it was auspicious or ominous.</p><p>"If only we had kept True Cultivator Qin for a few more days, perhaps…"</p><p>An elder couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>Before he could finish, the sound of thunder interrupted him.</p><p>Old Master Fang's gaze sharpened. He subconsciously turned towards the thunder, and in a moment, he saw a streak of lightning breaking through the air – it was True Cultivator Qin, returning.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up; it was daytime, the sun high in the sky, yet swallowed by a bloody light, leaving only the brightness of a crescent moon.</p><p>The demonic sound grew increasingly urgent and frantic.  Soon, it would likely assault a Yuan Ying cultivator.  His ominous premonition intensified.</p><p>“Open the shrine quickly!” he shouted.</p><p>Fang Laomo, sensing something amiss, his face changed, flew back to the Witch God Mountain, and just as he opened the shrine, a flash of lightning shot inside.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, Fang Laomo felt an inexplicable pressure and fear, his mind wavering, causing him to instinctively retreat.</p><p>“What happened?” Fang Laomo asked urgently.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the cause, transmitted what he knew, flicked his sleeve, and the star platform descended rapidly.</p><p>The star array formed, twenty-eight high-grade spirit stones and one top-grade spirit stone taking their places, restoring the old scene.  Though it was day, the shrine's dome still reflected the stars across the sky.  Deep within the star sea, the power resonating with the star array gradually became clear.</p><p>“Will you come with me?”</p><p>Sensing that the platform wasn't limited to one person, Qin Sang looked at Fang Laomo. Even with the celestial guidance, he could only protect at most a Grand Cultivator; the other Witch Clan cultivators would not be protected.</p><p>Fang Laomo showed signs of struggle, eventually shaking his head with a long sigh.  “The Witch Clan cannot be without its Grand Shaman!”</p><p>Qin Sang was clearly being hunted by a terrifying demon; the journey ahead was fraught with peril. Regardless of this unexpected turn of events, he couldn't leave.  Especially now, in these turbulent times, he couldn't abandon his entire clan.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press the issue. In this situation, he dared not delay, stepping onto the star platform.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang was instantly engulfed by intense starlight.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Witch Clan cultivators outside the mountain saw another celestial phenomenon.  On the peak of Witch God Mountain, above the clear sky, stars shone brightly, forming a stark contrast to the ominous bloody sun.  The stars circled Witch God Mountain, their light converging into a clear rainbow descending from the heavens.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang's figure vanished from the star platform.</p><p>He had used teleportation arrays to escape many times before.  But this time, luck wasn't on his side!</p><p>The bloody light above the blood-red sun suddenly intensified, separating from the sun and shooting downwards, transforming into a blood wind.  Wherever the blood wind passed, cracks appeared in the void, causing ceaseless turmoil.</p><p>Just as the starlight fell, the blood wind arrived first, dyeing the top of Witch God Mountain crimson.  Fortunately, Fang Laomo was quick-witted.  Having opened the shrine, he immediately retreated, narrowly escaping.</p><p>He looked towards the shrine in horror, seeing a fissure in the void there, the blood wind violently surging into the void crack.  A bloody light appeared amidst the void storm, within which a distorted and struggling figure seemed to be visible.  The void fissure closed instantly.  The starlight swirled for a moment before dissipating.  The stars disappeared.</p><p>Then, the blazing sun reappeared, as if nothing had happened.  But the top of Witch God Mountain was empty. The shrine and the summit of Witch God Mountain had been wiped away by the blood wind. If the mountain's cultivators hadn't been alerted by the celestial phenomena and left their caves, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p>The dark clouds and thunder that had shrouded the peak of Witch God Mountain for countless years vanished.  Sunlight shone on the broken mountain remnants.</p><p>(Volume Five Complete!)</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>1. Volume Six:  "The Fisherman," Coming Soon.</p><p>2.
