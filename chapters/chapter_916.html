<h1>Chapter 908: The Star Altar</h1><p>Chapter 908: The Star Altar</p><p>The rest were just odds and ends.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the messy ground.  On the stone platform bathed in the last rays of sunlight, only one object caught his eye. Though it looked incredibly dilapidated, it emanated an unusual aura, clearly an ancient artifact.</p><p>Was this what the Black Serpent Mountain sect had gone to such lengths to steal?</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly kept watch; the black-robed man couldn't have transferred it to anyone else unless he'd failed.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang picked up the other items one by one, probing them with his spiritual sense and True Qi.  He confirmed they were ordinary objects, leaving only the stone platform.</p><p>He lifted the platform in his palm, releasing his True Qi. It was completely absorbed.</p><p>The platform was like a bottomless pit, accepting everything without refusal. As the True Qi continued to flow in, a faint glow emanated from the platform, illuminating Qin Sang's surprised face.</p><p>"This is the power of the celestial constellations…"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  "This thing can actually connect to the stars on its own!"</p><p>Then, he suddenly realized something, his eyes flashed, and he abruptly increased his True Qi input, continuously feeding it into the platform. The platform's glow only brightened slightly; its form remained unchanged, yet the celestial energy grew stronger.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang's True Qi was nearly depleted. He stopped the infusion, placed the platform on the ground, and gazed at it with a face full of delight. This artifact might solve his biggest problem.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang, neglecting his exhaustion, searched every corner meticulously, countless times over. He even tried attacking the platform with Daoist techniques and magical artifacts, to no avail.</p><p>He found no runes on the platform; it seemed like a purely ordinary stone, except for its ability to resonate with the celestial constellations.</p><p>Qin Sang exhausted all his methods before finally stopping, lost in thought.</p><p>“The Lan Dou Gate stored the platform in the Dongming Island cavern. Either this thing is too important, and moving it would trigger another explosion like yesterday, or they didn't understand its true value, treating it as a tool to aid in cultivating the 'Lei Technique'.</p><p>“But the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch sent all his disciples out; he surely knew its secrets. The Patriarch's efforts to obtain this platform are far more complex than they seem.</p><p>“Could it be some kind of ancient Wu-tribe treasure, one that humans can't resonate with?</p><p>“It seems the Wu tribe also has similar secret arts! In ancient times, not only was spiritual energy incredibly abundant, and heavenly treasures plentiful, there were also countless experts.  Among all races, countless brilliant cultivators were born.  Unlike now, the various cultivation worlds are stagnant, like prisons.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, looking at the platform.</p><p>He then summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, but his attempts were still fruitless.  Besides their innate insect Gu and bloodline, Wu-tribe cultivators possess something humans don't—divine runes.</p><p>“If only Ya Gu would wake up; I could ask for her help…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, suddenly remembering Ya Gu, sighing, and finding his joy diminished.</p><p>“I'll look for an opportunity later. Anyway, the Wu-tribe's Divine Rune Dao is almost completely lost; grabbing any low-level Wu-tribe cultivator will do. For other human cultivators, unless they cultivate stellar energy, the platform's use is minimal, but for me, it's incredibly useful. I'll call it the Star Altar!”</p><p>Qin Sang gathered his thoughts, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p>He discovered that the more True Qi he infused, the more profound the celestial energy the platform drew.  With sufficient True Qi, he might achieve star energy body refinement.</p><p>“Myself, plus the two-headed… and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and Fat Silkworm, that's four Nascent Soul-level cultivators.  If they all attack at once, it should barely meet the requirements.  Unfortunately, the Flying Night Rakshasa is still at the Seven Killing Hall.  But if that's not enough, I can just refine more Flying Night Rakshasas; Soul-引魂草 is easier to obtain than Scorpion Venom Grass…”</p><p>Qin Sang estimated.</p><p>After all, it was only to break through to the third level of the 'Heavenly Demon Transformation', so the requirements shouldn't be too strict.</p><p>The Star Altar was highly sensitive; the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch before, and now the Lan Dou Gate's Yuan Ying cultivator certainly knows its value; revealing its existence would be fatal, making it impossible to ask for help.</p><p>Fortunately, he had learned many unconventional skills during his cultivation journey, enough to gather these helpers.</p><p>“I didn't find a solution through cultivation techniques, but from a stone!”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the Star Altar, feeling the chaotic scars looked much better. A smile unconsciously crept onto his lips.</p><p>From that point on, his cultivation had no more obstacles.</p><p>A heavy weight lifted from Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>He quickly regained his composure and considered his situation.</p><p>“This isn't a place to stay long. I should quickly recover and find a hidden place to lay low.</p><p>“Since I have a direction for star energy body refinement, I don't need to run around anymore.”</p><p>Landu Gate and Black Snake Mountain are after me.  I can't go to major cities like Tianxing City. I need a remote or chaotic place, somewhere inconspicuous.  It also needs to be an island with abundant spiritual energy, and unclaimed by any sect.</p><p>If it were in the Demon Sea, such a place wouldn't be hard to find.</p><p>But in the Inner Sea, almost all islands with good spirit veins are already claimed.  Trying to seize one would only expose me faster.  Only the Rain Desert of the North Sea and the Riftwind Archipelago are suitable.</p><p>The Rain Desert is in the far north of the North Sea; it's too far, and the journey would take a long time.  Plus, it’s extremely barren. If I run into trouble, getting supplies, medicine, or help would be difficult.  So it has to be the Riftwind Archipelago.</p><p>The Riftwind Archipelago is incredibly chaotic, filled with constant killing. Neither righteous nor demonic forces have much influence there.</p><p>I won't start trouble, but I won't be a pushover either.  With my strength, I should be able to carve out a niche.  After a few decades, once the heat dies down, I can return to my activities.</p><p>Also, Senior Qingzhu's cave is there. Perhaps I can find out more about things I don't know.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, quickly settling on her destination.</p><p>She couldn't help but reflect that Senior Qingzhu must have been in a similar situation, forcing her to flee to the Riftwind Archipelago and live in hiding for two hundred years.</p><p>By chance, Qin Sang found herself on a similar path.</p><p>Two strangers, inexplicably intertwined.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the stone platform, burned the worthless items, destroyed two storage pouches, then took out spirit stones, started cultivating, and entered meditation.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang was at her peak. Under the moonlight, she began her westward journey.</p><p>Along the way, she and her two-headed… (creature's name - unable to translate without original characters) took turns traveling.</p><p>She focused on cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique and improving her external avatar.</p><p>By the time she reached the waters of the Riftwind Archipelago, the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* had reached the late second stage, greatly strengthening her physical body.</p><p>Her external avatar also successfully broke through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, with Golden Core advancement imminent.</p>
