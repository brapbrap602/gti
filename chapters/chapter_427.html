<h1>Chapter Four Hundred and Twenty: The Devilfire Sect</h1><p>The Ebony Sword swept up the silver-clad man's corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended into the clouds, taking advantage of the others' momentary confusion to make his escape.</p><p>Several auras flickered within the mountain range, but after a moment of hesitation and some hushed exchanges, they retreated back into hiding.</p><p>Firstly, the battle had ended too swiftly. By the time they reacted, Qin Sang was already far gone.</p><p>Secondly, the Ebony Sword's display of power in slaying the silver-clad man was truly shocking.  Uncertain of Qin Sang's true strength, they dared not provoke him so readily.</p><p>Qin Sang, assured that no one was following, descended in a secluded spot.  He stumbled slightly, then examined his inner sea. His spiritual energy was almost depleted.</p><p>Evidently, wielding two magical treasures consecutively had taken a significant toll.</p><p>Fortunately, he had only activated them briefly.  Moreover, the Ebony Sword was his lifebound spirit sword, intimately connected to him, allowing for precise control.</p><p>By carefully modulating its power, he could avoid the devastating energy drain of the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>Naturally, unleashing the Ebony Sword's full might would have to wait until he reached the Gold Core stage.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a jade bottle and consumed a blood-replenishing pill he had prepared beforehand.  He sat cross-legged in meditation, and only after his spiritual energy had recovered did he open his eyes and regard the silver-clad man's corpse.</p><p>Fake Core Realm cultivators were top-tier in terms of combat prowess, battle experience, and decision-making. Reaching this realm marked them as elites among cultivators.</p><p>Killing them might not be difficult, but capturing them alive required meticulous planning, favorable circumstances, and a bit of luck.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing that capture was impossible, had been forced to kill him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt little regret. Whether he killed the silver-clad man or not, the outcome likely would have been the same.</p><p>"The fourth."</p><p>Qin Sang crouched down, placing his hand on the wound on the silver-clad man's chest, and muttered to himself.</p><p>This man was the fourth Devilshadow Sect remnant he had slain in recent years.</p><p>Ever since learning about the sect's remnants from Yu Hua, Qin Sang had been discreetly investigating them. He now possessed a thorough understanding of their disguised sect, the Devilfire Sect.</p><p>Though not insignificant in strength, the Devilfire Sect's numbers were limited.  With the Everbright Sect keeping a watchful eye, they dared not openly recruit disciples on a large scale.</p><p>Their leader was Priest Jiu Pao, who used the alias "Devilfire," likely a reference to his Nine Netherworld Devilfire magical treasure.</p><p>Under him were four disciples known as the Four Devilfire Emissaries. The silver-clad man, known as Silverfire, was one of them.</p><p>Of these four emissaries, two were at the Fake Core Realm, and the other two were not far behind.  Three, including Silverfire, were Devilshadow Sect remnants.</p><p>However, only Silverfire was Priest Jiu Pao's direct disciple. The other two were Yi Tiannie and another Gold Core disciple.</p><p>Those who had survived the Everbright Sect's relentless purge were formidable individuals, truly the cream of the crop.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't recognize the last emissary. After some investigation, he suspected this disciple had joined the Devilfire Sect after its establishment, rising through the ranks to become one of the Four Devilfire Emissaries.</p><p>Whether this person knew the sect's true nature remained unknown to Qin Sang.</p><p>The four disciples kept a low profile. Though Qin Sang knew their identities, opportunities to find them alone were rare.  The three he had previously killed were ordinary disciples beneath the emissaries.</p><p>Of course, these three had been carefully chosen by Qin Sang, with considerable time between each killing. His goal was to subtly weaken Priest Jiu Pao and delay his recovery.</p><p>His discovery of Silverfire's movements was linked to the Blood Essence.</p><p>In recent years, with the shifting landscape of the Small Cold Region, the Everbright Sect's pressure had eased, allowing the Devilfire Sect to recover and operate in the shadows. Its disciples were focused on finding healing remedies.</p><p>They certainly wouldn't miss out on a healing treasure like the Blood Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been active near Green Sun City, noticed Silverfire's unusual activity. Connecting it to the news of the Blood Essence auction at Skydark Pass, he formulated his ambush plan.</p><p>This also indirectly confirmed that Priest Jiu Pao's injuries had not yet fully healed, which was excellent news for Qin Sang.</p><p>What excited him even more was that Silverfire himself had come to purchase the Blood Essence.</p><p>Eliminating Silverfire meant his mission was mostly complete.</p><p>Among the Four Devilfire Emissaries, Silverfire was Priest Jiu Pao's most favored and loyal disciple.  Killing him was akin to severing one of Jiu Pao's arms.</p><p>However, this was the first time in his four ambushes that using Heart-Eating Insect Gu as bait had proved effective.</p><p>This suggested that few within the Devilshadow Sect were proficient in poison and gu techniques.</p><p>Unlike Silverfire, the previous three had been captured alive.</p><p>But when Qin Sang attempted to restrain their nascent souls, all three had inexplicably suffered soul collapse and perished before he could cast the Soul Snatching Curse. He was powerless to stop it.</p><p>One instance could be considered an accident.</p><p>Three consecutive occurrences were no coincidence.</p><p>There was only one explanation: Priest Jiu Pao had planted restrictions on their nascent souls to prevent soul searching, thus protecting his hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished by this discovery.</p><p>Not only did Yu Hua possess knowledge of the Heart-Eating Insect Gu, but he also knew the movements of Priest Jiu Pao and the other remnants despite Jiu Pao's caution. His identity was clearly more than just a traitor of the Everbright Sect.</p><p>Yu Hua, coveting both the Nine Illusion Orchid and Priest Jiu Pao, had grand ambitions. However, with Yu Hua now a living corpse embryo, those ambitions were irrelevant.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be certain whether the Four Devilfire Emissaries carried such restrictions. Given Jiu Pao's prudence, even without them, he likely employed other methods of control.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>Dealing with ordinary disciples was one thing, but ambushing the Four Devilfire Emissaries required careful planning and a plausible "reason" to avoid arousing Priest Jiu Pao's suspicion.</p><p>Alerting Jiu Pao could lead him to change his hiding place, making him much harder to track.</p><p>This was why Qin Sang had acted so aggressively at the auction, publicly creating animosity with the silver-clad man.</p><p>When the silver-clad man disappeared, "Devilfire," upon investigating, would find a "reasonable" explanation.</p><p>In the perilous world of cultivation, unforeseen incidents were commonplace.</p><p>Qin Sang placed a mask on Silverfire's corpse, preparing to refine him into a corpse soldier upon his return. Then, he examined Silverfire's storage pouch.</p><p>Inside, the Blood Essence was the most eye-catching item.</p><p>This treasure was difficult to sell, so he could keep it for personal use.</p><p>With tensions rising in the Cloudmire Great Marsh, healing remedies were essential.</p><p>Silverfire, having spent fifteen thousand low-grade spirit stones on the Blood Essence, still had nearly ten thousand remaining. Priest Jiu Pao had truly spared no expense to obtain it.</p><p>How furious would Jiu Pao be upon learning of his most trusted disciple's demise and the theft of the Blood Essence?</p>
