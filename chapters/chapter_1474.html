<h1>Chapter 1466:  Liuli (6k, extra chapter for the alliance leader Tong Lingyu!)</h1><p>Listening Snow Peak.</p><p>Liuli returned to her cave dwelling for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Shi Xue summoned her disciples, dealing with accumulated matters, becoming extremely busy.  Late into the night, Shi Xue let out a long sigh, dismissed her attendants, and left the main hall.</p><p>The night was deep.</p><p>From her high vantage point, Shi Xue admired the night view of Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Some mountain peaks were covered in snow, while others were warm and verdant, each unique due to the protective spirit arrays shielding them from the cold.</p><p>The scenery was entirely dependent on the mountain lord's whim.</p><p>Palaces and pavilions stood among the mountains.</p><p>Jade bridges arched between the peaks, resembling flying rainbows.</p><p>Flight was prohibited on the main peak, even for Shi Xue, the tower's leader.</p><p>She gazed for a long time, took a deep breath, and descended the jade steps.</p><p>Her and Liuli's cave dwellings were both on the main peak, not far from each other.</p><p>Shi Xue first arrived at Liuli's dwelling, hesitated, then, without disturbing Liuli's cultivation, continued towards her own. Passing a secluded hall, her expression shifted, her footsteps paused, and she entered.</p><p>This hall was where Listening Snow Tower venerated their ancestral spirits. Two disciples guarded the ever-burning lamps. Seeing the leader enter, they quickly bowed.</p><p>She dismissed the disciples, closed the door, lit three incense sticks, and bowed before the spirit tablets behind the altar, inserting the incense into the burner.</p><p>The smoke curled upwards.</p><p>Shi Xue's gaze, through the incense smoke, fell upon one particular spirit tablet.</p><p>This tablet bore the name Bing Yao, the name of her and Liuli's master.</p><p>Shi Xue's expression softened, revealing an unprecedented vulnerability.  She knelt, speaking as a child might to her master, murmuring, “Master, I have made complete preparations for my junior sister.  All that remains is for her to reach peak condition before her breakthrough.  Not only will her Ice Soul Divine Light reach its peak, but she will also overcome her bottleneck and advance to mid-Yuan Ying stage before the first Heavenly Tribulation. Then, she will qualify for the Cleansing Pool. With her talent and this opportunity, she will surely become a great cultivator, reviving Listening Snow Tower.  But…”</p><p>The joy in Shi Xue's eyes faded, replaced by worry.</p><p>“My junior sister is stubborn. To solidify her Dao heart, she used Ice Soul to suppress her emotions, severing her attachments. Yet, a karmic entanglement persists. At this critical juncture, that heartless man has reappeared. My junior sister seems outwardly unaffected, but suppressing emotions doesn’t mean extinguishing them. I fear her Dao heart will be shaken. And…and…”</p><p>A sigh echoed through the hall.</p><p>“An ordinary person would be different. But this man…he is unparalleled. Can my junior sister truly let him go? I can’t help her, I can only offer ineffective advice. And that heartless man is unlikely to allow himself to be manipulated.”</p><p>Confusion clouded Shi Xue's eyes.  “Master, if you are watching, could you tell your disciple what my junior sister’s true heart knot is? What should I do?”</p><p>The night was silent.</p><p>In the depths of winter, not a bird or beast was heard.</p><p>Shi Xue sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, silent for a long time.</p><p>The hall was dim, only the flickering candlelight illuminating her slender figure.</p><p>…</p><p>The following evening.</p><p>Qin Sang was meditating when she sensed the activation of the formation outside her small building.  Her spiritual sense swept out, revealing Shi Xue’s presence.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Shi.”</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the building, bowing in greeting.</p><p>Shi Xue returned the bow, glanced at the building, and smiled. “Are you satisfied with this place, Daoist?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “The scenery is exquisite; it's a truly exceptional dwelling.”</p><p>“I'm glad you don't feel slighted.”</p><p>Shi Xue paused before the building, not entering.  She spoke seriously.  “There is one more matter requiring your cooperation, which I didn't mention yesterday due to our journey. According to Listening Snow Tower's rules, the appointment of an honorary elder requires a ceremony before the ancestral spirits. While your honorary elder status is merely temporary, we shouldn't violate tradition.”</p><p>“Is that so? Please tell me what is needed, Master Shi.  Just give your instructions.”</p><p>Since she was already here, Qin Sang would naturally cooperate fully.</p><p>“You don't need to do much, simply offer a stick of incense before the ancestral spirits.”</p><p>Shi Xue led Qin Sang towards the hall where the ancestral spirits were venerated, explaining, “As long as I and Jiang Dianzhu approve, we don’t need anyone else’s consent. The Grand Elder will explain to Jiang Dianzhu. I hear you're planning a trip soon, so I want to complete this quietly beforehand and give you the Elder's token.  If you encounter trouble while traveling, you can use this token to call upon the forces outside Xuan Tian Palace.  We can publicly reveal your identity later when a suitable opportunity arises.”</p><p>Jiang, the hall master, is a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator from the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>As they spoke, the two women walked from the back mountain to the main peak.  It seemed Shi Xue had deliberately chosen the route, as they didn't encounter anyone else along the way.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around.</p><p>The several peaks surrounding the main peak were places with the most concentrated spiritual energy.  </p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the restrictions in many pavilions were flickering, clearly indicating occupancy.  These were likely the pillars of the Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>At this point, Shi Xue, who was leading the way, slowed her pace and asked casually, "Master Daoist, do you have a partner? Even if they are not a Yuan Ying cultivator, they can still enjoy the same preferential treatment as you, as an honored guest elder."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shi Xue and said, "This Daoist is alone, without a partner."</p><p>Shi Xue showed surprise.  "With your cultivation, finding a partner shouldn't be difficult, should it?"</p><p>"Isn't the headmaster also alone?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, sensing something odd about Shi Xue's behavior.</p><p>If Shi Xue was probing on behalf of Liuli, Qin Sang didn't believe it.  Although he hadn't interacted much with Liuli, he understood her character very well.</p><p>In both their perspectives, their past encounter was simply a transaction.</p><p>If not for a chance reunion, they would have had no further connection.</p><p>"If I'm still stuck at this bottleneck a hundred years from now, I will find a partner and try dual cultivation,"</p><p>Shi Xue said frankly, without any shame, her expression calm. She even discussed it with Qin Sang.  "Master Daoist wouldn't have any prejudice against the Way of Dual Cultivation, would you?"</p><p>"Yin and Yang complement each other, constantly generating and transforming; it's a righteous path. How could this Daoist reject it? However, male and female dual cultivation, with intertwined lives, is the true Way. But firstly, most cultivation methods of this kind are flawed, bordering on the heretical; and secondly, finding a compatible partner is as difficult as reaching the heavens.  The difficulty of the Way of Dual Cultivation is not a bit less than that of other Ways."</p><p>Qin Sang, having cultivated for so long and even experimenting with corpse pills, couldn't possibly not have researched the Way of Dual Cultivation.</p><p>In the eyes of many cultivators, dual cultivation is a shortcut, equivalent to sexual exploitation, often involving manipulative techniques. Even many self-proclaimed orthodox dual cultivation methods cannot escape this trap.</p><p>There's immediate benefit, but endless repercussions.</p><p>Truly righteous dual cultivation methods are rare, demanding high talent from both cultivators, and amplifying both their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>"Master Daoist is right. That's why I've been hesitant,"</p><p>Shi Xue glanced at Qin Sang, thoughtfully nodding in agreement.</p><p>As they spoke, the great hall came into view.</p><p>The two entered the hall.</p><p>Liuli was in the hall, kneeling with her hands clasped. Seeing them enter, she stood up to greet them.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the hall, noticing Bing Yao's memorial tablet.</p><p>He already knew that Bing Yao was Liuli's master.</p><p>This person was clearly trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, her life or death unknown, yet the Listening Snow Tower had already erected a memorial tablet for her. Shi Xue and Liuli were as close as sisters, yet even she was kept in the dark.</p><p>Some time ago, Liuli had secretly asked Qin Sang not to reveal this matter.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more curious about Liuli's intentions, wondering if there was some hidden reason behind Bing Yao's disappearance, or if Bing Yao had some powerful enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang only cared about the Sacred Land and didn't intend to investigate further, lest he cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Shi Xue lit three incense sticks.</p><p>Qin Sang paid his respects with three bows, inserting the incense into the incense burner, receiving the witness of the ancestor, and then accepted the elder's token from Shi Xue.</p><p>Inside the token was a unique mark.  Activating it could summon nearby Xuan Tian Palace disciples for his use.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked them, put away the token, exchanged a few more words with the two women, and returned to his small building.</p><p>…</p><p>Eastern region of the Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>Here lies a large city, extremely rare in the mortal world.</p><p>Even in the cold season, the city is bustling with people, extremely prosperous.</p><p>From time to time, a streak of light flew over the city. The mortals were already used to it, only glancing up before returning their envious gaze and continuing with their lives.</p><p>Mortals and cultivators co-exist in this city.</p><p>In the center of the city, there is an inner city, inaccessible to mortals. Even the independent cultivators attached to this city are not allowed to enter without permission.</p><p>Because this is Luo family territory.</p><p>The Luo family, a cultivator family of the Xuan Tian Palace, although not as powerful as the four main branches, is quite famous in the Hidden Sun Realm because Luo family cultivators excel in dual cultivation. The current head of the Luo family is a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>The Yuan Ying ancestor is high and mighty, rarely seen.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Wan, the head of the Luo family, was personally receiving a distinguished guest.</p><p>"I wondered why the magpies were chattering outside. It turns out it's Headmaster Shi who has graced us with her presence."</p><p>"I'm surprised to see you, Mistress Shi.  What brings you to my humble abode?"</p><p>Luo Wan, in a robe resembling a qipao, exuded an alluring charm in every movement. Even other women, lacking sufficient willpower, would blush in her presence.</p><p>Seated opposite her was Shi Xue.  It seemed Shi Xue had left the Listening Snow Tower and visited Luo Wan without anyone noticing.  They were clearly very familiar.  Shi Xue's eyes narrowed slightly as she retorted, "What kind of clueless magpie dares approach this vixen's lair?  Don't you fear having your life force sucked dry?"</p><p>"You know I'm a vixen, and you still dare to come in?"</p><p>Luo Wan remained unperturbed, her eyes like silken threads, her breath soft as a sigh. Leaning slightly, she increased her alluring demeanor. Shi Xue was lively and spirited, but compared to this woman, she was a mere child. She scoffed, "Stop the act. I have serious business. Otherwise, you could beg me, and I wouldn't come to your den."</p><p>After a pause, Shi Xue asked somewhat uncomfortably, "Do you still have the Luo family's *Divine Maiden's Heart Sutra*?"</p><p>Luo Wan was startled, sat up straight, and scrutinized Shi Xue, giggling. "Old hag, you've finally fallen for someone! Is it some sort of May-December romance? I wonder which unlucky young man it is?"</p><p>"Enough nonsense!"</p><p>Shi Xue was impatient. "I'm here on behalf of someone seeking this dual cultivation technique. I swear it will only be passed to a couple, and never leaked. If you agree, I will secure an Ice Wind Cave quota for the Luo family at the next Sacred Grounds opening."</p><p>"A quota for a late Golden Core disciple to enter the Ice Wind Cave?  Are you serious?"</p><p>All traces of Luo Wan's allure vanished. She seemed like a different person, her aura now befitting a Yuan Ying ancestor.</p><p>Shi Xue snorted. "Do you think I'd lie? I can swear an oath on my inner demons, but you mustn't reveal this. The Luo family is affiliated with the Heavenly Mountain lineage, but that lineage—formed from a union of sects, factions, and cultivators from the Heavenly Mountain region—is internally divided and rife with conflict.  They're unlikely to spare a quota for your family."</p><p>"I don't need you to explain that."</p><p>Luo Wan tapped the table with a finger. "The Luo family hasn't successfully cultivated the *Divine Maiden's Heart Sutra* for two thousand years. It's become useless. Trading it for an Ice Wind Cave quota isn't a bad deal. However, I must warn you to avoid complications.</p><p>"Firstly, only two people in the Luo family have ever mastered the *Divine Maiden's Heart Sutra*—its difficulty is self-evident.</p><p>"This technique not only demands extremely high talent but also requires the cultivator's emotions to fluctuate wildly.  This cannot be feigned; it must be genuine, deeply rooted in passionate love. Only when these emotions reach their peak can one begin cultivation.</p><p>"Secondly, the slightest mistake in cultivation will shatter the cultivator's Dao heart, harming both partners, making them share a common fate.</p><p>"Countless Luo family geniuses have been ruined this way.  It’s been largely ignored.</p><p>"If you're seeking it for a younger generation, I advise you to reconsider. If you ruin a promising talent, don't blame the Luo family."</p><p>Shi Xue hesitated. She’d heard Luo Wan describe the *Divine Maiden's Heart Sutra* and thought her junior sister, Liuli, was currently in the right emotional state for it, leading her to seek it.  She hadn't expected such severe consequences.</p><p>Liuli and her former lover were both top-tier cultivators, so talent wasn't a concern. Liuli’s passionate devotion was undeniable.  This was the hardest condition to meet.</p><p>Cultivators reaching the Yuan Ying stage, having seen the world and weathered many storms, rarely experience such intense emotional upheaval, let alone being consumed by love.</p><p>Thus, the *Divine Maiden's Heart Sutra* is generally suited only to young, inexperienced cultivators, whose cultivation base is naturally lower.</p><p>Unlike them, Liuli and her lover were both Yuan Ying cultivators. If they sense danger, they could stop the dual cultivation, making the Luo family's tragic outcomes unlikely.</p><p>With this in mind, Shi Xue made up her mind. Opening her hand, she said, "Thank you for the warning! Whether it's suitable, we'll only know after trying."</p><p>Her actions weren't meant to force her junior sister and Qin Sang together, knowing she couldn't decide for them, but were a precaution.  Since Qin Sang’s reappearance, she worried that Liuli’s Dao heart would waver upon encountering her old lover.</p><p>It was a crucial moment for Liuli’s cultivation; this issue couldn't be ignored. At the moment of breakthrough, Liuli couldn’t be distracted. The ice heart seal couldn't completely block her emotions.  If the seal failed, and her emotions surged, she would fail to break through.</p><p>Severe cases could even lead to the collapse of Liuli's Dao heart, making enlightenment impossible.</p><p>Shi Xue was very worried but couldn't directly mention it to Liuli, so she could only hint at it, letting Liuli understand herself; otherwise, it would only backfire.</p><p>After much thought, the only thing she could do was obtain the *Divine Maiden Heart Scripture*.</p><p>Once the Ice Soul Sealing Affection technique wears off, Liuli's long-suppressed emotions will erupt, it's not ordinary, and this is the best opportunity for her to achieve enlightenment.</p><p>Then, Shi Xue will bring out the *Divine Maiden Heart Scripture* and let the two of them decide whether or not to cultivate it.</p><p>To this end, Shi Xue deliberately probed Qin Sang's opinion, learning that Qin Sang didn't have a Dao partner yet and had no prejudice against dual cultivation, but she just couldn't find a suitable technique or partner.</p><p>Among all the women in the world, who can match her in looks, talent, and aptitude?</p><p>Countless people in the Xuan Tian Palace adore her.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang and Liuli had a past entanglement; it’s a natural fit.</p><p>Shi Xue couldn't think of a reason for Qin Sang to refuse.</p><p>Luo Wan said so much earlier because she was afraid the technique would cause problems, destroying the Yuan Ying relative of someone in the Listening Snow Pavilion and bringing retribution to the Luo family. Since Shi Xue was determined, she was naturally delighted, immediately taking out a jade slip and giving it to Shi Xue.</p><p>"The requirements for enlightenment are so extreme. Is this a dual cultivation technique, or the kind of exploitative evil technique you cultivate?"</p><p>Shi Xue asked casually.</p><p>"Of course not," Luo Wan gave a charming laugh, her voice suddenly becoming alluring, "This technique can be practiced not only by male and female Dao partners but also by two women, although one woman needs to cultivate the Yang extreme secret technique to receive Yang energy. If you don't believe me, shall we two try it first?"</p><p>Shi Xue showed a look of disgust, spat, and got up to leave.</p><p>Luo Wan wouldn't let her go, stopping her until a written agreement was made.</p><p>…</p><p>Shi Xue left the Luo family and hurried back.</p><p>As soon as she returned to the Listening Snow Pavilion, she saw a voice transmission token left by Liuli in her cave, and quickly went to Liuli's cave.</p><p>"Junior Sister, are you ready to break through the bottleneck now?"</p><p>Shi Xue pushed open the door and saw Liuli sitting cross-legged, with Yin Li Pearls, Di Tong fruits, and other spiritual items lined up in front of her.</p><p>Liuli opened her eyes, her gaze profound, her eyes like deep pools, and she nodded gently.</p><p>Her aura was also unusually calm, having made the best possible preparations for the breakthrough.</p><p>Shi Xue carefully observed for a while, seeing that her junior sister showed no abnormalities, reassured herself that she might be overthinking, "Let's go to the Floating Snow Pavilion. There are restrictions left by Master; no one can disturb us. I'll protect you."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Liuli gathered the spiritual items with a gesture, followed Shi Xue out of the cave, turned towards the back mountain, passed through the snowy path, and arrived at a mountain hollow, inside which stood a solitary wooden building amidst the falling snow.</p><p>The interior of the wooden building was spacious but simply furnished. A cold jade bed was placed in the center, and a six-petaled snowflake pattern was engraved on the ground beneath the bed. Once activated, it would form a protective barrier.</p><p>Combined with the formation around the wooden building, it provided double protection, ensuring foolproof security.</p><p>Liuli went to the cold jade bed, lightly tapped her finger, and a stream of light entered the ground. A semicircular protective barrier burst forth, exceptionally strong.</p><p>Shi Xue guarded the entrance to the wooden building, controlling the formation.</p><p>Liuli and Shi Xue exchanged a glance, sat cross-legged on the cold jade bed, took out the spiritual items, and closed their eyes.</p><p>For a time, the wooden building was silent.</p><p>Shi Xue dared not relax, constantly monitoring Liuli's changes.</p><p>After some time passed…</p><p>Liuli placed her hands on her knees in a moon-holding posture, and white mist suddenly emerged from her palms.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Shi Xue's gaze sharpened. She was also very familiar with the Ice Soul Divine Light, knowing that this cold air was caused by the Ice Soul Divine Light affecting the environment, and her junior sister was nearing the most critical moment.</p><p>The cold air gathered into a ball in Liuli's palm, crystal clear and condensed. At this moment, she seemed to be holding an ice ball.</p><p>At this time…</p><p>The Yin Li Pearl in front of Liuli trembled slightly, automatically flying up and entering the middle of the cold air.</p><p>Despite being enveloped by the Ice Soul Divine Light, the Yin Li Pearl didn't melt, rotating on its own, very firm.</p><p>A core appeared within the cold air.</p><p>At this point, Liuli stopped focusing on the Yin Li Pearl and changed her target, drawing in secondary cold items, successively merging them into the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>These spiritual items were not as hard as the Yin Li Pearl; upon impact with the Ice Soul Divine Light, they immediately transformed into the purest cold air and were refined by Liuli.</p><p>The spiritual items in front of her disappeared one by one.</p><p>Finally, only several kinds of spirit pills and elixirs like the Di Tong fruit remained.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>One by one, the jade bottles opened, Liuli slightly opened her mouth, swallowed the spirit pills, and immediately, the cold air in her palm surged, like a cold air storm.</p><p>Under the impact of the storm, the Yin Li Pearl finally couldn't hold on, its surface gleaming, as if it was about to melt, gradually showing white cracks.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Yin Lizhu shattered into pieces, instantly swept away by the storm and vanishing without a trace. Only the purest chill remained, strikingly visible within the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Three Di Tong fruits flew towards Liuli, transforming into three globules of pure spiritual liquid.</p><p>After consuming the fruits, Liuli closed her eyes, her aura fluctuating violently.</p><p>The icy energy in her palm retracted rapidly.  The chill left by Yin Lizhu, unable to withstand the pressure, suddenly burst forth, completely merging with the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Simultaneously, Liuli's true essence circulated wildly, like raging waves, yet her body remained motionless. She was seizing the moment before the secret technique reached its peak to break through her cultivation bottleneck!</p><p>Liuli's aura climbed steadily without hindrance, proceeding as smoothly as expected.</p><p>Shi Xue's eyes widened, her heart pounding.  Seeing this, her expression softened slightly, and she was about to smile when her face suddenly changed.</p><p>An unnatural crimson blush bloomed on Liuli's snow-white cheeks.</p><p>Her tightly closed eyes trembled violently, indicating an overwhelming emotional turmoil she couldn't control.</p><p>Instantly, Liuli's rising aura abruptly stopped.</p><p>Liuli persevered, but her emotional fluctuations became increasingly apparent, her breathing grew erratic, her body trembled slightly, and even the Ice Soul Divine Light in her palm showed signs of instability.</p><p>Shi Xue was horrified; her greatest fear had come true!</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was searching for an underground Yin vein in the snowy mountains north of the Listening Snow Tower, preparing for the refinement of his external avatar.</p><p>While flying between the peaks, Qin Sang paused mid-air, his Qianjun Ring flashing. The Elder's Token leaped out, emitting a white light.</p><p>A message from the sect leader, summoning him urgently!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He turned towards the Listening Snow Tower, suspecting a mishap with the sacred ceremony. Without hesitation, he flew back.</p><p>Following the Elder's Token's guidance, Qin Sang found the mountain hollow and the wooden tower.</p><p>He scanned the surroundings with his divine sense, confirming there was nothing amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared before the tower.  A creak sounded as Shi Xue opened the door, giving him a complex look before handing him a jade slip.  "I hope you can help Liuli," she said earnestly. "The Listening Snow Tower will be eternally grateful."</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered.  His confusion deepened after reading the jade slip's contents, and he looked inside the room.</p><p>At that moment, a tiny ice sword formed from condensed chill descended towards his nose, stopping him at the door.</p><p>Inside the room.</p><p>Liuli sat cross-legged on a piece of cold jade, having apparently awakened. She looked pale, watching Qin Sang and Shi Xue.</p><p>She allowed her energy to rapidly subside, biting her lip stubbornly.</p><p>Her eyes were as pure as glass.</p>
