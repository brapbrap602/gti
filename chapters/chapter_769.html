<h1>Chapter 761: The Ninth Person</h1><p>After they left, lightning and thunder raged around the Ancient Altar.  </p><p>Lei Suo vented his fury, celestial lightning danced wildly, and the monstrous beasts cried out in agony, their bodies turned to dust by the heavenly bolts.</p><p>When Lei Suo calmed down, silence returned to the area surrounding the Ancient Altar.</p><p>After a while, a figure appeared near the altar; it was Qin Sang.</p><p>From the moment Xiang Yi and the others began to break the ancient restriction to the beast attack, Qin Sang had been nearby, but couldn't find an opportunity to intervene. He could only watch them complete their mission and leave.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't follow them because there would be even fewer opportunities to act later. He decided to give up.</p><p>Based on their earlier conversation, Xiang Yi had promised to help Cui Ji and Fatty retrieve treasures, and the three wouldn't separate for the time being.  Following them alone after they left the Purple Mist was too risky.</p><p>Besides, Qin Sang had his own matters to attend to and couldn't follow them indefinitely.</p><p>This didn't mean he had given up on revenge. There was plenty of time in the future, and while his enemies were in the light, he remained hidden. He would eventually find an opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the foot of the Ancient Altar, not daring to get too close.</p><p>Having just witnessed Lei Suo slaughtering the beasts, he was still shaken.</p><p>He hadn't seen what Xiang Yi had done.  Noticing the restriction on the Ancient Altar was intact, he was puzzled. He circled it but couldn't figure anything out.</p><p>If there were any treasures, Xiang Yi had already taken them.</p><p>Knowing Lei Suo's power, Qin Sang didn't dare touch the ancient restriction on the altar. After a moment of hesitation, he decided to leave.</p><p>"Let's put other matters aside and go directly to the Celestial Tower. There's still plenty of time. This time, I need to at least find a clue to the ancient teleportation formation, though finding it directly would be even better…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, about to summon his Two-Headed Vulture to leave the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone as quickly as possible, when he suddenly sensed something and spun around.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>He stared intently into the purple mist, his heart pounding and his expression changing.</p><p>A figure flickered within the mist, slowly approaching him. Qin Sang felt himself locked onto by two gazes. It was a stranger!</p><p>Someone had been following him, and he hadn't noticed at all.</p><p>Qin Sang had only appeared after confirming Xiang Yi and the others had left. Could it be that there was a ninth person who entered the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone?</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>Were they attracted by the commotion caused by Lei Suo's celestial lightning, or had they been following them all along?</p><p>Were they merely passing by, or did they have some other purpose?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, his nerves taut. He realized he was locked onto by a faint aura. The other party seemed confident, strolling towards him without attempting a sneak attack.</p><p>Of course, within the purple mist, it was difficult to launch a completely undetected sneak attack, unless, like Cui Ji, one chose to strike when their target was besieged by beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly summoned his Two-Headed Vulture and prepared for battle.</p><p>The figure grew clearer, finally stopping before Qin Sang.  It was a young man with a hooked nose and sharp, hawk-like eyes that scrutinized him.</p><p>Seeing this person, Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>This person's aura was even stronger than Xiang Yi's, very likely a peak Core Formation cultivator, the strongest opponent Qin Sang had encountered since reaching Core Formation himself!</p><p>"Who are you! Why are you following me?"</p><p>Qin Sang took the initiative, his voice low and demanding.</p><p>The poisonous mist of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone was formidable, known as one of the three deadliest areas in the Seven Kills Palace. Very few cultivators dared to venture within.  Meeting someone in this vast expanse of purple mist couldn't be a coincidence!</p><p>The young man glanced at Qin Sang and the Two-Headed Vulture, his expression somewhat disdainful. In fact, he was only a step away from Nascent Soul, and his cultivation level was indeed enough to look down on Qin Sang.</p><p>"Are you with the Northern Constellation Alliance, the Righteous and Demonic Sects, or perhaps a spy bought by the Wu Tribe?  Three-Transformation Spirit Insects aren't common among our human race."</p><p>The young man spoke, asking a question that left Qin Sang baffled.</p><p>He noticed the young man staring at his sleeve and immediately realized the man knew about Fatty Silkworm's existence. His heart tightened, and he quickly signaled Fatty Silkworm to hide.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm was his reliance for navigating the purple mist. If Fatty Silkworm were killed, he might as well surrender.</p><p>Northern Constellation Alliance, Righteous and Demonic Sects, Wu Tribe…</p><p>Whether the young man had overlooked it or done it intentionally, he'd mentioned almost all the major known powers in the Canglang Sea region, omitting only the Western幽Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled, but his expression remained unchanged. He countered, "So, you are from the Western幽Alliance?"</p><p>The young man neither confirmed nor denied, stating coldly, "To infiltrate Xiang Yi's group and escape during the beast chaos shows you have some cunning. I'm curious, which other power has set its sights on the Eastern Apex Alliance, and how much do they know? If you confess honestly, I may grant you a quick death. Your escape technique is decent, but shaking me off is a fool's errand."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, picking up something from the young man's words.</p><p>The young man seemed to have been following them all along, and none of the eight, including himself, had noticed anything unusual, which spoke volumes about his strength.</p><p>He seemed to have also been affected by the beast chaos and was unaware that Cui Ji’s attempt to kill him had forced him from the group. He assumed Qin Sang had other motives and had seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>"I've heard that the three great merchant alliances stand together, sharing weal and woe.  With your strength, your position in the Western幽Alliance must be quite significant.  Cui Ji is carrying out the Alliance Leader's orders, yet you follow in secret.  If the Eastern Apex Alliance Leader were to find out…"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, trying to stall for time and gather more information.</p><p>The young man appeared confident and unhurried. Qin Sang continued to observe him discreetly.</p><p>The young man held a spirit sword and didn't seem to possess a treasure like the Bone Lotus, yet he moved freely within the poisonous mist. Qin Sang noticed a faint, greenish light surrounding him, seemingly warding off the poison.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang thought the greenish light came from the young man's robes.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized it emanated from the jade bracelet on his left wrist.</p><p>The jade bracelet was a poison-repelling treasure!</p><p>If he used the Fire Pearl directly, there was a good chance he could kill this person instantly.  However, this was the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone; dealing with him might not require using his trump card immediately.</p><p>Unlike Cui Ji, who had never witnessed the power of the Bloodfiend Divine Light and was thus caught off guard, this young man was different.</p><p>Destroying the jade bracelet… If the young man didn't have a second poison-repelling treasure, how much of his strength would he be able to utilize?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Ancient Altar and said in a deep voice, "The treasure on the altar has already been taken by Xiang Yi.  You didn't dare show yourself before, and now you're not rushing after him. Even if you kill me, what good will it do?"</p><p>"Treasure?  So, you don't know the secret of the altar?"</p><p>The young man frowned at Qin Sang, looking surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He hadn't seen what Xiang Yi did on the altar and didn't know if he'd taken anything.</p><p>The young man saw through him, a sneer appearing on his face. He scoffed, "So you're a useless fool who knows nothing. What use are you?"</p>
