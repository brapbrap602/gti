<h1>Chapter 1488:  Decrepit Old Age (4k, Added Chapter)</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Two streaks of light tore through the dark clouds.</p><p>One was golden, a lifelike miniature golden peng bird, sharp beak and claws, its feathers like gold iron, extremely fierce.</p><p>The other was black, the Hun Mo Order.</p><p>The golden peng bird and the Hun Mo Order arrived simultaneously, breaking through the dark clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with the Hun Mo Order.</p><p>The moment he saw this magic treasure, Qin Sang’s pupils contracted, and many things became clear.</p><p>The Hun Mo Old Man’s invitation was for the Xuan Tian Palace’s sacred grounds!</p><p>No wonder the Hun Mo Old Man invited so many experts, actively resolving grievances; it wasn’t that the place he was going to was dangerous, but that the Xuan Tian Palace was too strong.</p><p>He needed another Grand Cultivator-level expert to stand a chance.</p><p>Qin Sang had a grudge against the Xuan Tian Palace, making him the perfect candidate.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, if he hadn't been persuaded by Liuli with the offer of the Cleansing Pool, and ignored the Hun Mo Old Man’s invitation, he could have been a double agent.</p><p>That golden peng bird must be a divine ability of the Great Peng Saint.</p><p>It seemed the Yaozu's sudden attack a month ago, their posturing, had ulterior motives.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The next moment, the Hun Mo Order and the golden peng bird dimmed, and a wild laugh came from the dark clouds; two figures burst into the sacred grounds, followed by a stream of escaping figures.</p><p>“Hun Mo Old Man!”</p><p>“Great Peng Saint!”</p><p>“Blood Yao King!”</p><p>“Gui General!”</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing these faces, the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators cried out in shock.</p><p>They were all famous and powerful demons and monsters.</p><p>At this moment, they understood that the war a month ago was a calculated move by the other side, leading to many of the sect's experts being left to guard the Juyao Island.</p><p>A comparison.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace was now at a disadvantage, the weaker party.</p><p>The void seethed with undercurrents.</p><p>The Hun Mo Old Man’s side also saw the Xuan Tian Palace cultivators.</p><p>The two sides looked at each other across the void, their expressions varied.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stood together, silent.</p><p>With the situation as it was, Qin Sang couldn't tell if it was good or bad.</p><p>Earlier, he had subtly inquired, discovering that Grandmaster Jiang and Liuli knew very little about the depths of the sacred grounds; there were still unknown secrets hidden within.</p><p>The unexpected appearance of the Hun Mo Old Man and the Great Peng Saint had disrupted the situation; it might be an opportunity for him to obtain the Killing Sword fragment, but it could also mean two more powerful opponents.</p><p>For now, he could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons, and quickly made a decision.</p><p>Regardless, he would get the Cleansing Pool spot first, and then act according to the situation.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the Killing Sword fragment wasn't urgent.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, the cultivation technique stored with the fragment would certainly be for the stage after the Divine Transformation stage; he definitely wouldn’t be able to use it for several hundred years.</p><p>The Killing Sword fragment's greatest use was to help the sword spirit recover.</p><p>However, the sword spirit's recovery was too slow; there was no need to rush.</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>Qin Sang thought clearly, whether the Killing Sword fragment remained in the sacred grounds or fell into the hands of the Hun Mo Old Man and others, it wouldn't matter much.</p><p>They couldn't destroy the Killing Sword fragment, nor could they cultivate the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*; they were simply keeping it for him.</p><p>Finding this Killing Sword fragment that fell into the North Sea was Qin Sang's goal.</p><p>He could lock onto the location of the Killing Sword fragment through the sword spirit; others couldn't hide it.</p><p>Qin Sang had plenty of patience.</p><p>He would retrieve the treasure when he had enough strength!</p><p>This opportunity to enhance his talent was a once-in-a-lifetime great opportunity that couldn't be missed.</p><p>Of course, if there was a chance to seize the Killing Sword fragment, he would do his best to prevent any accidents with the cultivation technique, and he had the strength to participate in the fight!</p><p>Having figured this out, Qin Sang became much calmer.</p><p>He looked deeply at the Hun Mo Old Man and the Great Peng Saint, his gaze sweeping towards the group of demons and monsters behind them; when he saw two of them, a look of surprise flashed across his face.</p><p>They were an old man and a young man.</p><p>The two stood not far behind the Hun Mo Old Man.</p><p>The old man had silver hair, and looked decrepit, but his brows still showed traces of his younger self; his cloudy eyes occasionally flashed with a sharp light, making him impossible to underestimate.</p><p>The young man was a handsome young man, with a refined appearance, a gentle gentleman. Even strangers would feel a sense of goodwill towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes showed a strange look; this young man was Qiu Mu Bai, his long-lost senior brother Qiu.</p><p>The only disciple Dongyang Bo took away when he left the Shaohua Mountain!</p><p>His current cultivation was already at the peak of the late Golden Core stage, comparable to Tan Hao.</p><p>However, Tan Hao, guided by Gui Mu, and further aided by medicinal herbs and the serene sounds of morning bells and evening drums at Jing Hai Sect, had accumulated numerous fortuitous opportunities.  His breakthrough to Yuan Ying stage was only a matter of time.</p><p>“Could that elder be…?”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the elder carefully, his heart trembling.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The elder was none other than Dongyang Bo!</p><p>Qin Sang last saw Dongyang Bo at the founding of the Northern Star Alliance, shortly after Zi Wei Palace's ascension.  Back then, Dongyang Bo looked much the same, still dressed in brocade robes, exuding the bearing of a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator and sect leader.</p><p>But in just a few decades, Dongyang Bo had aged drastically, his body heavy with the weariness of old age, almost unrecognizable.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what Liuli had said earlier.</p><p>Bing Yao had passed on a secret technique to Dongyang Bo, allowing him to break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, but it would accelerate the decay of his vital energy, ensuring his death even if he somehow survived until the next heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Dongyang Bo clearly hadn't found a solution. The hidden dangers had begun to manifest. He wasn't dead yet, but his appearance was that of an aged man, indistinguishable from an octogenarian.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Liuli's gaze and exchanged a glance with her.</p><p>“His time is short,”</p><p>Liuli, recognizing Dongyang Bo, transmitted her words.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>His heart was a mixture of emotions.  While the imminent death of his enemy brought satisfaction, seeing the once formidable patriarch of Shao Hua Mountain nearing his end also evoked a sense of sadness – a feeling of shared fate.  If he remained stagnant, the same would befall him one day!</p><p>Since arriving in the North Sea, Qin Sang hadn't found any trace of Dongyang Bo, thinking his earlier deduction had been wrong.  He never expected this reunion.</p><p>At this moment, Dongyang Bo also saw Liuli among the Xuan Tian Palace crowd. Liuli was too striking, even with a veil.</p><p>Seeing that Liuli was still trapped at the early Yuan Ying stage did not surprise Dongyang Bo at all. The origin of the *Xuan Pin Jade Cauldron Scripture* was unusual; it was something that even the Demon Sect would relegate to the shelf.  The hidden dangers of this heretical technique were not so easily solved.</p><p>As the originator of the problem, even he had no good solution. That was one of the reasons why he avoided meeting Liuli.</p><p>Then, Dongyang Bo noticed the unfamiliar man beside Liuli.  Their proximity was unusual.  With her unresolved cultivation problem, it was improbable that Liuli would have formed a couple with someone.</p><p>A flicker of unusual color crossed Dongyang Bo's eyes. Although Qin Sang had changed his appearance, Dongyang Bo had studied him extensively after his earlier encounter, and he was far too familiar with him.</p><p>…</p><p>The two sides faced each other from a distance.</p><p>Within the sacred grounds, only the sound of moving dark clouds could be heard.</p><p>Hun Mo and Tian Peng, their gazes fixed on the divine bird palanquin, looked uncertain.  The Xuan Tian Palace Master had truly emerged from seclusion.</p><p>Exchanging glances, they no longer hesitated, immediately using their escape techniques to lead their forces into the sacred grounds. They didn’t wish to engage in an open battle with Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Tong Lingyu coldly swept her gaze over the group of demons, showing no sign of panic.  She moved to the side of the palanquin, whispering a few words.</p><p>After a silent exchange with the Palace Master, Tong Lingyu nodded slightly and turned to the crowd. Her tone was calm, “Everyone, remain calm. There's no need for worry. Hun Mo and Tian Peng will be dealt with by the Palace Master and myself! The Kan Shen Pearl and other crucial treasures cannot be lost.  After retrieving the treasures, all Hall Masters and Elders should regroup quickly. Remember to proceed cautiously…”</p><p>Tong Lingyu made orderly arrangements. It was evident that, while guarding against the demons, her primary goal was still the retrieval of treasures.</p><p>A murmur arose in the crowd. Some were puzzled by the decision to not engage in direct combat, expel the demons, but instead allow them to run rampant.  They feared that such a strategy would leave them vulnerable to being picked off one by one.</p><p>The Palace Master's cultivation was unmatched in the North Sea, and together with the Great Elder they would command the divine artifacts, undoubtedly achieving victory.  Though the demons held the advantage, it was not decisive. They were a disorganized mob, mutually suspicious of each other. By contrast, Xuan Tian Palace was united and their resolve was strong.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly praised their wisdom. Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu had a clear head. Xuan Tian Palace feared the demons, but the demons were equally wary of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>These demons sought opportunities, they weren't under Hun Mo’s direct command.  They would prefer to avoid an open conflict with Xuan Tian Palace unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>With Hun Mo and Tian Peng present, a decisive extermination was impossible for Xuan Tian Palace. It would only cause unnecessary casualties.</p><p>The exposure of the sacred ground was a fait accompli. It was better to consider countermeasures later.  The priority now was the retrieval of the treasures. Xuan Tian Palace knew the sacred ground best; even with luck on their side, the demons could only seize a small portion.</p><p>The location had been kept secret before to avoid trouble.  Now that it was revealed, Xuan Tian Palace had nothing to fear.</p><p>The key to the Sacred Land remains in the hands of Xuan Tian Palace.  Xuan Tian Palace alone decides when to open the Sacred Land, and the opening time will be kept strictly confidential from now on, unless these people do nothing but constantly guard the vicinity.  As the foremost sect in Beihai, Xuan Tian Palace has the confidence to dominate the Sacred Land!</p><p>Understanding this, Tong Lingyu and the Palace Master quickly made a decision.  The treasures of the Sacred Land will be taken by whoever is capable!</p><p>All the Yuan Ying cultivators understood the gravity of the situation and followed orders.  Xuan Tian Palace mobilized its entire force and entered the Sacred Land.</p><p>This arrangement suited Qin Sang perfectly. He immediately sent a voice transmission to Liuli, and the two immediately launched their flight, heading towards the Floating Mountain where the Cleansing Pool was located.</p><p>Just as they were about to leave,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly heard a faint, almost whispered voice transmission in his ear, “After the Daoist leaves the Cleansing Pool, I hope you will meet me at the last Floating Mountain. I have important matters to discuss. You will not be disappointed…”</p><p>It was Tong Lingyu's voice.</p><p>Upon hearing this, a gleam flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, and his figure paused slightly.</p><p>There were indeed secrets hidden deep within the Sacred Land!</p><p>Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu were worried about the possibility of the Hunmo Elder and the Tianpeng Saint seizing them.</p><p>Within the Sacred Land, only he was qualified to participate in the battle of powerful cultivators.</p><p>This was exactly the opportunity Qin Sang had been hoping for.</p><p>He nodded imperceptibly and, along with Liuli, flew away.</p><p>The situation was unpredictable. The Cleansing Pool would only be open for a short time; they didn't have time to deal with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>On the other side,</p><p>Dongyang Bo silently observed Liuli and Qin Sang's movements.</p><p>He couldn't be entirely sure that it was Qin Sang.</p><p>Discovering that this person's cultivation was actually at the mid-Yuan Ying stage, Dongyang Bo was greatly shocked, filled with disbelief, and only his strong willpower prevented him from showing it outwardly.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang had only formed his golden core less than a hundred years ago!</p><p>How could this be possible?!</p><p>Could this person really be a five-element root cultivator?</p><p>Did the person who tested his aptitude back then make a mistake?</p><p>Dongyang Bo fell into deep doubt and profound regret.</p><p>He, along with Qiu Mu Bai, followed the strongest force led by the Hunmo Elder and the Tianpeng Saint. Seeing Liuli and Qin Sang moving further away, his expression eased slightly.</p><p>“Master, where are we going now?”</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai was protected by Dongyang Bo's King Kong Zhuo.</p><p>Dongyang Bo deliberately did this. The King Kong Zhuo emitted a white light, obscuring Qiu Mu Bai's vision, making it blurry, so that he didn't see Liuli and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai couldn't see what was happening outside and felt a little uneasy. He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Dongyang Bo glanced at the direction where Qin Sang and Liuli had disappeared, retracted the King Kong Zhuo, quietly changed direction, and said in a low voice, “Let's go to Ice Wind Cave first!”</p><p>It was said that a late-stage Golden Core cultivator could increase their chances of forming a Yuan Ying core after passing through the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai was facing this difficult challenge.</p><p>For decades, the master and disciple had traveled far and wide, receiving some fortuitous encounters, but none were as significant as the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai's eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p>Then, seeing Dongyang Bo's aging face, Qiu Mu Bai suddenly remembered his master's condition, his heart ached. Fearing that he would delay his master, he hurriedly said, “Master, let me go and compete for the opportunity to enter the Ice Wind Cave myself.  Aren't you with the Ghost General…”</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>“Do you think you only need to compete with cultivators of the same level? With so many demon and devil cultivators entering the Sacred Land, how could Xuan Tian Palace not send experts to protect them? Stop talking nonsense!”</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai dared not argue, a resolute expression on his face.</p><p>The master and disciple separated from the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>Several others made the same choice, meeting up halfway, forming an alliance, and heading straight for the Floating Mountain where the Ice Wind Cave was located.</p><p>…</p><p>The Floating Mountains at the entrance were as small as pebbles.</p><p>Only up close could one see that each Floating Mountain was immensely huge.</p><p>One could imagine how vast the space of the Sacred Land was.</p><p>Even with so many people scattered throughout the Sacred Land, there was no change; it remained empty and vast.</p><p>Qin Sang was in front, Liuli behind.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly could easily spot the gaps between the ancient prohibitions and the turbulent currents.</p><p>Assisted by the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang maintained an extremely fast speed, dodging and weaving, appearing incredibly perilous to others, yet managing to avoid danger every time.</p><p>Liuli didn't need to worry; she just followed Qin Sang.</p><p>They passed Floating Mountain after Floating Mountain.</p><p>The Cleansing Pool was getting closer.</p><p>The path they had chosen was relatively secluded; they could only see faint lights in the dark distance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced behind him, thinking that except for a few people like the Hunmo Elder, no one should be faster than them. He spoke, “Let’s go to the Gluttonous Lake first.”</p><p>Liuli nodded.</p><p>The Gluttonous Lake and the Cleansing Pool were on the same Floating Mountain, located at opposite ends.  There were ancient prohibitions outside the Gluttonous Lake; one of them was particularly strong, requiring Qin Sang and her to work together to break it. It wouldn't take long.</p><p>The two of them flew silently, without speaking.</p><p>They encountered no obstacles along the way; no one was foolish enough to intercept them.</p><p>Finally, the Floating Mountain was in sight.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>The pandemic has recurred, and I haven't been home for a long time.</p><p>It's a holiday tomorrow, and my parents traveled a long way to see me. I'll spend time with them and take a day off.</p><p>I wish everyone a happy holiday and a happy reunion with their families!</p>
