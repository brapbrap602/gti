<h1>Chapter 885: Jade Finger Peak</h1><p>Chapter 885: Jade Finger Peak</p><p>A young disciple activated a small, orb-shaped artifact, generating a ball of white light that enveloped the two of them, carrying them towards Lan Dou Gate.  </p><p>The disciple seemed increasingly fond of the newcomer, his tone softening considerably due to the newcomer's skillful flattery.</p><p>Of course, the newcomer understood this was merely a superficial show of friendliness. One wrong word, one slight offense, and the disciple's favor would vanish instantly.  </p><p>Having successfully entered Lan Dou Gate, there was no need to rush. He could take his time to uncover its secrets.</p><p>Therefore, the newcomer patiently answered the disciple's questions, rarely initiating conversation himself.</p><p>The place where Elder Hua Yang had left them was already quite close to Lan Dou Gate. After a short flight, they arrived before a mountain range shrouded in mist.</p><p>The disciple produced a token, and with a gentle wave, the mist parted, revealing a path leading directly to the summit. He then whisked the newcomer up, and in the blink of an eye, they traversed the path.</p><p>Simultaneously, the newcomer exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>"This is the Lan Dou Gate mountain gate! Those three peaks are the Azure Clouds Peaks, and the two mountains facing each other are our Yin-Yang Peaks…"</p><p>The disciple pointed and gestured, a smile playing on his lips, seemingly pleased with the newcomer's reaction.</p><p>The newcomer's astonishment wasn't entirely feigned.</p><p>The grandeur of Lan Dou Gate far surpassed even Shao Hua Mountain, making it the most impressive sect he had ever witnessed.  Indeed, Lan Dou Gate, despite its decline, still possessed astonishing resources, worthy of its place in the Cang Lang Sea.</p><p>The sky was clear, and white clouds drifted lazily.</p><p>Amidst this idyllic scene, five towering peaks pierced the heavens like sharp swords, rivaling Shao Hua Mountain's main peak in height. The disciple pointed towards these five peaks.</p><p>The Azure Clouds peaks were somewhat scattered, while the Yin-Yang Peaks stood close together, separated only by a narrow gap; from a different angle, they looked like a single mountain.</p><p>This reminded the newcomer of the Sword Gate Pass of Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Apart from these five peaks, the other mountains, while still beautiful, were unremarkable. The disciple altered their course, diverting them from the Yin-Yang Peaks towards a nearby cluster of peaks.</p><p>These peaks were tall and slender, lush and green, with low-level cultivators occasionally appearing among them.</p><p>As if snapping back to reality, his gaze still lingering on the five great peaks, the newcomer suddenly asked casually, "Senior Brother Yang, which peak is the Dou Niu Peak that Grandmaster obtained while at the Yan Miao Pavilion?"</p><p>"Dou Niu Peak?"</p><p>The disciple paused, his eyes scanning his familiar sect grounds.  He looked puzzled. "I'd forgotten about that! I've never heard of a Dou Niu Peak before. I don't know which peak Master is referring to. I'll ask a senior brother later…"</p><p>Seeing the disciple's genuine confusion, the newcomer was surprised.</p><p>Even this Foundation Establishment cultivator, who had spent years in Lan Dou Gate, hadn't heard of Dou Niu Peak.  No wonder his own inquiries had yielded nothing.</p><p>Lan Dou Gate's strict secrecy surrounding Dou Niu Peak was baffling.</p><p>The newcomer felt a twinge of apprehension.</p><p>His journey was based on a rumor, a sliver of hope for Dou Niu Peak. Now it seemed the lineage was completely severed, and the technique he sought might be problematic. Would he find what he wanted?  Perhaps the Scorpion Poison Grass held more promise.</p><p>Still, he'd come this far.</p><p>He had gone to great lengths to infiltrate Lan Dou Gate; he would find out the truth before leaving.</p><p>"That's Jade Finger Peak ahead.  According to sect rules, you'll cultivate there until you refine your Yin-Yang Armor.  Jade Finger Peak is also called the outer gate; only after receiving true teachings can one cultivate on the Yin-Yang Peaks. I'll take you to meet Senior Brother Lu…"</p><p>Having failed to recall anything about Dou Niu Peak, the disciple dismissed it from his mind and continued his introduction of the sect.</p><p>"Junior Brother Yang!"</p><p>Suddenly, a voice called from a distance.  A streak of sword light flashed towards them, arriving in an instant, revealing a middle-aged cultivator.</p><p>He was unusually enthusiastic towards the disciple. "I heard Junior Brother Yang has achieved Foundation Establishment! I was planning to visit and congratulate you, but then I heard you left the mountain with Elder Hua Yang.  I didn't expect to run into you at Jade Finger Peak. Has the Elder already accepted you as a direct disciple?"</p><p>"Senior Brother Lu!"</p><p>The disciple bowed.  "I was on my way to find you. My breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was fortunate… Master did mention it, but I haven't yet officially been accepted as a direct disciple."</p><p>Senior Brother Lu, his face full of envy, offered his congratulations: "Isn't that just a matter of time?  I congratulate you, Junior Brother. With Grandmaster Huayang's personal guidance, you're sure to soar to great heights; Golden Core cultivation is just around the corner…"</p><p>After a brief chat, Senior Brother Lu seemed to notice Zhang Yue. "Hmm, this person looks unfamiliar. Is he a new disciple you've taken on, Junior Brother?"</p><p>The attendant shook his head slowly. "Junior Brother isn't so presumptuous as to take on disciples yet. He's just recently established his foundation; his priority is to consolidate his cultivation. He has no capacity to train disciples. I've come to see you, Senior Brother, because of him. His name is Zhang Yue. Grandmaster just accepted him as a disciple, and sent me to register him in the jade register…"</p><p>"Since Grandmaster Huayang accepted him and Junior Brother Yang personally brought him, his talent must be quite good.  Come with me, both of you…"</p><p>Senior Brother Lu didn't seem surprised at all and immediately took them flying back to Jade Finger Peak.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three of them landed before a wooden hall on one of the peaks.</p><p>Senior Brother Lu waved his hand to open the hall's restriction and, as he walked inside, reminded them, "Junior Brother Yang, although Zhang Yue was accepted by Grandmaster Huayang, we can't skip the sect's regulations."</p><p>"Senior Brother Lu, don't worry. I understand. I brought him here for this very reason. Please follow the rules. However, there's one thing I need your help with."</p><p>The attendant gestured for Zhang Yue to come forward and answer Senior Brother Lu's questions.</p><p>As Senior Brother Lu busied himself, he smiled slightly and asked, "What is it, Junior Brother?"</p><p>The attendant sighed helplessly. "Senior Brother, why pretend you don't know?  The situation of our Yin-Yang lineage is known to everyone in the sect. According to the rules, all disciples sent to Jade Finger Peak must undertake a mundane task. But those of our Yin-Yang lineage must focus on refining the Yin-Yang armor after entry; if burdened with additional work, when will we ever find the time?"</p><p>Senior Brother Lu looked troubled. "At the beginning of the year, when the new disciples entered, I did the same thing, but this matter is closely watched, attracting much criticism. Why doesn't Grandmaster Huayang simply issue a decree, saving me, a lowly Foundation Establishment cultivator, from this predicament?"</p><p>"Grandmaster said that ancestral laws cannot be easily discarded…"</p><p>The attendant sighed softly.  "Grandmaster and the others plan to petition this matter once the Grand Patriarch returns. Until then, we can only ask for your understanding, Senior Brother Lu."</p>
