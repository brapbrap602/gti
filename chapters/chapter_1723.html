<h1>Chapter 1714: The Path</h1><p>True Essence circulated.</p><p>After a full cycle, Qin Sang roused himself from meditative trance.</p><p>The Skygaze Butterfly flitted to Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings opening and closing, casting a faint, pure light within the dim cavern dwelling.</p><p>After devouring Qin Sang's tribulation lightning, the patterns on its wings had undergone subtle changes, becoming not only more exquisite but also imbued with a sharper edge.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways. Unlike the carefree Skygaze Butterfly, he couldn't afford such tranquility.</p><p>After reaching Nascent Soul, the path ahead should have been smooth.</p><p>Just as Ghost Mother had said, upon breaking through to the corresponding realm, Qin Sang sensed the Dao Marker Gate of this world, pointing towards the east.</p><p>Following that inexplicable sensation, even without a sea chart, he wouldn't have to worry about getting lost in the storm belt.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, like his predecessors, Qin Sang would continue cultivating in this world for a period, make ample preparations, then cross the Eastern Sea to the Returning Ruins, ascend through the Dao Marker, and enter a brand new world.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound had disrupted everything!</p><p>His Natal Spirit Insect, the Skygaze Butterfly, was already at the peak of the Fourth Transformation's late stage. After Qin Sang reached Nascent Soul, by using the spirit nurturing method from the *Panhu True Scripture* to cultivate the Skygaze Butterfly, even if he couldn't refine the Azure Frost Pill, there was still hope for it to break through to the Fifth Transformation. Now, however, he had to be cautious.</p><p>Because spirit insects lacked sentience, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound should affect them even more severely than cultivators and妖族 .</p><p>"I can only start with myself... How can I quickly increase my strength?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>If he was forced to cross the Returning Ruins, only with sufficient strength would he have a hope of survival.</p><p>His mind retreated inward as he silently practiced the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*.</p><p>The contents of the eleventh level of the cultivation method surfaced in his mind.</p><p>When comprehending the Nascent Soul stage portion, Qin Sang had already sensed that the killing intent of this Slaughter Path cultivation method seemed to be weakening. Throughout the entire Nascent Soul stage, he hadn't deliberately leaned towards the Slaughter Path, engaging in wanton killing.</p><p>The gains from repeatedly challenging stronger opponents across realms were enough to support his comprehension of the cultivation method.</p><p>Obtaining the subsequent levels of the method confirmed this point.</p><p>The eleventh level of the cultivation method was the process of condensing the Sword Phantasm. It shifted from continuously killing to condense Killing Seals and Sword Souls, to integrating the Slaughter Path into oneself and separating out Sword Phantasms!</p><p>"Rather than saying the killing intent weakened, it's more like the creator of this cultivation method no longer needed to use 'killing' as a means, having stepped into a higher realm, reaching a loftier level! No need for indiscriminate slaughter, no need to pursue external things like Killing Seals and Sword Souls. The Slaughter Path is one's own path!"</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang vaguely grasped the essence of this cultivation method, sensing the journey of the creator in creating this method.  Closely following this realization was astonishment.</p><p>Before the tenth level, the Sword Seals, Sword Souls, and so on, were like the creator's repeated attempts.</p><p>Enlightenment through slaughter, but at first, only external things were gained, progress was arduous. Until breaking through to Nascent Soul, that senior finally found his own Dao!</p><p>Qin Sang could even sense his arduous process of seeking.</p><p>"Could it be that that senior created this cultivation method from scratch, taking every step on his own?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p>He could now create his own cultivation methods. Before Golden Core, it shouldn't be difficult. But after reaching Nascent Soul, it would require careful consideration and a vast amount of energy for deduction.</p><p>This was because his realm was high enough, with a profound accumulation of hundreds of years, allowing him to take a broader perspective.</p><p>After Nascent Soul, beyond his current realm, Qin Sang would find it difficult to control the direction. If he went astray, he could potentially ruin centuries of painstaking cultivation, leaving him with endless regret.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his own limitations. Creating his own cultivation method might not be suitable for him, it was better to follow established practices for stability.</p><p>During Foundation Establishment or even Qi Refining, when life was precarious and understanding was hazy, not yet comprehending the true meaning of the Dao, unable to see the path ahead, and without other cultivation methods for reference, how could one have the ability to create their own methods?</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the number of cultivators in the world was as vast as the sands of the Ganges, and how many brilliant and talented individuals existed? So-called geniuses were as common as crucian carp crossing a river.</p><p>The senior who created the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, if it was truly as Qin Sang speculated, would be a peerless genius, standing out even in the vast world.</p><p>What was the outcome for such a figure?</p><p>Ascension to immortality, or...</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the pieced-together Earth Slaughter Sword in his dantian.</p><p>Hopefully, it wasn't a case of the sword breaking and the person perishing!</p><p>Having broken through to Nascent Soul, Qin Sang greatly anticipated a response from the sword spirit.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword spirit remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the thought transmitted to him by the sword spirit, urging him to find more fragments.</p><p>Obtaining two Earth Slaughter Sword fragments in the Xuan Tian Palace's sacred grounds, the fragments automatically joined to form the Earth Slaughter Sword, yet it was still insufficient to awaken the sword spirit.</p><p>"Can the sword spirit hear the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of this question.</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword's main body had only recently been restored, and it was unclear whether there were still fragments of the hilt scattered elsewhere. The sword spirit should still be in a weakened state, and its current realm was unknown.</p><p>"The sword spirit definitely knows many secrets. When it awakens, I might be able to control this peerless treasure sword and inquire about the secret of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound."</p><p>Qin Sang realized that there were actually several paths before him.</p><p>The Eastern Sea's Returning Ruins, the Ascension Platform, the sword spirit, he could also go to the Cang Lang Sea to see if the Seven Kills Hall had ascended.  Succeeding on any one of these paths could resolve his predicament.</p><p>Speaking of sword spirits...</p><p>He had one too!</p><p>With a thought, the Cloudroaming Sword emerged from between his eyebrows.</p><p>Qin Sang silently practiced the *Sacrificial Yuan Technique*. Performing the secret technique once, the effect was far greater than during Nascent Soul, and he couldn't help but feel joy.</p><p>Once the Scorched Wood True Spirit finished gestating, he would be able to utilize his Natal Spirit Sword.</p><p>From his comprehension of the cultivation method, he knew that once the Sword Phantasms were born and integrated into the killing formation, the power of the Seven Phantasms Killing Formation would greatly increase, giving him a better chance of survival in the Returning Ruins.</p><p>But without the Natal Spirit Sword at its core, its power would always be lacking.</p><p>Both the Earth Slaughter Sword's sword spirit and the Cloudroaming Sword's true spirit required patient waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers lightly on his knee, recalling another sword formation, the *Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation* obtained from the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>After obtaining this sword formation, Qin Sang hadn't cultivated it, but he had studied it a bit, grasping its key points.</p><p>Judging from their encounter within the Five Elements Divine Restriction at Emperor Bestowal Mountain, it was clear that this sword formation was extraordinary.  If Zhu Wudao hadn't used a scheme to shake the foundation of the sword formation, they might still be trapped within the Five Elements Divine Restriction until a Nascent Soul cultivator arrived.</p><p>Unless the enemy was extremely powerful, using brute force to overcome the formation, or finding the main star, which was the sword star where the formation master was hiding, they would have to endure the sword formation's assault.</p><p>The Seven Lunar Mansions corresponded to the White Tiger's Seven Constellations.</p><p>The positions of the seven constellations could all serve as formation eyes. With one person controlling the formation, its power was strong, but it wasn't the complete sword formation.</p><p>Gathering seven top-tier sword cultivators, each controlling a constellation, the sword formation could then possess infinite variations. It was a core inheritance of the Formless Immortal Sect's Golden Phase lineage.</p><p>The *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* happened to be able to differentiate into seven Sword Phantasms. At that time, the Sword Phantasm avatars could each preside over a constellation, with his main body controlling the overall situation, transforming between the real and illusory, making it difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</p><p>Qin Sang alone could deploy this grand sword formation!</p><p>Moreover, the *Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation* didn't require a Natal Spirit Sword.</p><p>In addition to this, the most immediate method was definitely to continue refining the *Seed of Fire Golden Lotus*. As long as he obtained suitable spiritual flames, he could continuously enhance his divine sense. This secret technique wouldn't be limited by the insufficient spiritual energy of this world.</p><p>After stepping into Nascent Soul, Qin Sang felt that he was approaching the limit of this world.</p><p>Still in the early stage of Nascent Soul, his cultivation was already faintly restricted. Influenced by the external environment, the broken Four Saints Spirit Gathering Formation was far less effective for Nascent Soul cultivators compared to Golden Core, and moreover, this formation wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that it was extremely difficult for cultivators to break through to the mid-stage of Nascent Soul in this world. Even if they managed to force a breakthrough, upon entering the upper realm, they would face the pressure of heavenly tribulation and lifespan, making it a loss rather than a gain.</p><p>He guessed that the Nascent Soul cultivators of this world should all ascend eastward during the early stage of Nascent Soul.  With the exception of a very few who obtained heaven-defying opportunities, there might be exceptions.</p><p>Now, ordinary spiritual flames couldn't satisfy the requirements of the *Seed of Fire Golden Lotus*.</p><p>Qin Sang once again set his sights on the Southern Bright Emberfire, hoping for a turnaround.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang withdrew the Cloudroaming Sword and once again circulated the *Seed of Fire Golden Lotus*. The fire lotus and the Sun God Tree both floated before him.</p><p>The fire lotus was completely under his control.</p><p>Controlling the Sun God Tree was also much easier than before.</p><p>Qin Sang first used the fire lotus to try and draw upon the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>Black and crimson flames danced within the cavern dwelling, reflecting on Qin Sang's face, sometimes dim, sometimes bright.</p><p>The fire lotus hovered above the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Regrettably, even with his utmost effort, Qin Sang still couldn't make the fire lotus devour even a sliver of the Southern Bright Emberfire. This showed that the rank of this fire was far above the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>No wonder the firebirds condensed from merely the aura of the demonfire possessed such terrifying power.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, abandoning the attempt. He held the Sun God Tree in his palm, gazed at it for a moment, then closed his eyes slightly, urging his divine sense to activate the Sun God Birds.</p><p>On the branches, the flames on the nine Sun God Birds flickered in sequence.</p><p>He was actually attempting to unleash all nine birds simultaneously!</p><p>The next moment...</p><p>Qin Sang's body trembled, his expression changing slightly. He hurriedly ceased his efforts.</p><p>"Can't be too ambitious!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. His current goal should be to control six Sun God Birds with ease, which would be sufficient to deal with most situations in this world.</p><p>"It seems a trip to the Cang Lang Sea is inevitable. I hope the Nine Phoenix King's broken feather is still there..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, but he didn't plan to set off immediately, at least not until the matters in the Central Continent were settled.</p><p>How to deal with Saint Hui Guang and Saintess Qing Hu next, Qin Sang hadn't decided yet. Personal grudges, the path to ascension, the overall situation of the world, too many things were intertwined.</p><p>After the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the *Seed of Fire Golden Lotus* came the *Demonic Transformation*.</p><p>These three cultivation methods and secret techniques were carefully selected by Qin Sang over hundreds of years from numerous scriptures. They suited him, maximized the Jade Buddha's effects, avoided danger, and achieved the simultaneous cultivation of essence, qi, and spirit.</p><p>The *Demonic Transformation* was temporarily lagging behind, but it shouldn't be difficult to catch up.</p><p>During the tribulation, Qin Sang had utilized the Yin Fire Tribulation for body tempering, with remarkable results.</p><p>He took out the Star Platform and sat cross-legged upon it.</p><p>Slightly circulating the *Demonic Transformation*, Qin Sang immediately felt the difference. His physical body was breaking down and rebuilding, progressing rapidly. He estimated that he could soon advance to the mid-stage of the fourth level.</p><p>If he could elevate his physical body to the Nascent Soul level before ascending, it would undoubtedly greatly increase his chances of survival in the Returning Ruins.</p><p>A figure appeared in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Back then, at the Formless Immortal Sect's Emperor Bestowal Mountain, that female Daoist had set up a trap within the Five Elements Divine Restriction, luring them to enter the Nine Abyss Earthly Magnetism to compete for treasures. Master Huai Yin was the first to be ambushed.</p><p>Master Huai Yin was severely injured, in a certain death situation, but he somehow employed a secret technique, instantly recovering from his injuries and regaining his peak combat strength, causing the female Daoist's plan to fail.</p><p>Qin Sang was present at the time, and Master Huai Yin left a deep impression on him.</p><p>He guessed that it should be a rare body tempering secret technique.</p><p>"This secret technique is enough to reverse life and death!  After the *Demonic Transformation* breaks through to the late stage of the fourth level, when I have time, using the Seventh Grade Azure Spirit Bamboo as a medium, I'll cultivate the *Acquired Wood Golem Stele*, obtaining a spirit wood body.  Coupled with this secret technique, as well as the Thunder Escape Technique at its peak, my methods in body cultivation won't be lacking!  In the future, I must definitely make a trip to the Western Lands and visit Master Huai Yin..."</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let go of any life-saving methods.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was also very curious, were there any Immortal Halls in the Western Lands?</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea had the Seven Kills Hall, the North Sea had the Purple Star Palace, and the Central Continent had the Heavenly Fellowship and Heavenly Accord. It shouldn't be a coincidence.</p><p>Each Immortal Hall contained a fragment of the Slaughter Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the hilt of the Earth Slaughter Sword was still out there, possibly, like in the Central Continent, retrieved by cultivators from the Western Lands.</p><p>Obtain the complete Earth Slaughter Sword and help the sword spirit recover as soon as possible.</p><p>Traveling to the Western Lands was imperative!</p><p>"Right, there's also the Poison Bead."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind sank into his dantian, summoning the Poison Bead.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, within the Poison Bead was a mass of white light, shaped like a cocoon of light, with the faint outline of the Jade Armored Insect still discernible.</p><p>Over hundreds of years, the Poison Bead had subtly and continuously devoured, and the Gu King's power had unknowingly dissipated.  Compared to before, the change was very obvious.</p><p>After Qin Sang reached Nascent Soul, he could easily suppress the Gu King without resorting to the Cloudroaming Sword. There was no need to be so cautious anymore. It was time for the Poison Bead to bare its fangs and forcibly devour the Gu King!</p><p>Devouring the Gu King wasn't enough to satisfy Qin Sang.</p><p>The Gu King's poison, fused with the poison of the Myriad Venom Mountain's sacred object, was extremely potent.</p><p>Thinking of the strange-faced man's final fate, Qin Sang felt that, without the Poison Bead, even he would have to be cautious when facing such potent poison. Utilizing this poison to cultivate the *Heaven Severing Soul Stirring Needles* was also a powerful poison path divine ability, capable of threatening ferocious beasts at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Besides his main body, there was also his avatar.</p><p>The Second Primordial Spirit, imbued with the Jade Buddha's Buddha light, also had some resistance to the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound. Qin Sang was considering how to help his avatar break through.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang meticulously reviewed his path.</p><p>The road ahead was very clear.</p><p>With essence, qi, and spirit progressing together, various divine abilities, secret techniques, and treasures working in concert, he might not even need to reach the mid-stage of Nascent Soul to possess formidable strength.</p><p>Except for the *Demonic Transformation*, there were no bottlenecks. He only needed to travel from Myriad Venom Mountain to the Western Lands, then to the Cang Lang Sea, exploring and cultivating diligently for a period.</p><p>The problem was, did he have that much time?</p><p>These days, Qin Sang had already adapted to the presence of the Demonic Sound, finding it merely irritating.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the Demonic Sound was like this from the beginning, or if it was gradually intensifying over time.</p><p>If there was only the Demonic Sound, he naturally wouldn't fear it. He could patiently focus on strengthening his own power.</p><p>But what if one day, the heavens and earth underwent another transformation, no longer limited to the level of the soul? What would he do then?</p><p>...</p><p>The avatar entered the Central Continent and arrived once again at the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>The monks of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery were no longer surprised by Daoist Qing Feng's arrival. The guest monk didn't even report to the higher-ups of the monastery, greeting him familiarly and allowing him to come and go as he pleased.</p><p>His cavern dwelling was still preserved.</p><p>The avatar proceeded skillfully, passing through halls and alleys, heading towards the back mountain. Along the way, he encountered several eminent monks, some of whom he had interacted with to varying degrees, and they could all exchange a few words with him.</p><p>Some had even given him guidance.</p><p>Unfortunately, his mindset had already changed.</p><p>Before this, he had wanted to build good relationships with the Buddhist sect.</p><p>Parting with a familiar monk, the avatar put away his smile, his gaze sweeping across the ancient temple hidden in the mist and haze. He sighed softly in his heart, walked to his cavern dwelling, and gazed towards Small Boundless Mountain, staring for a long time.</p>
