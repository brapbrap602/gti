Chapter 474: Self-Created Cultivation Technique


The Xuantian Thunder, suspended by spiritual energy, drifted toward Qin Sang.  Qin Sang looked at it, resisting the temptation to reach for it. Instead, she used an inquiring gaze to look at Granny Jing.


"I had no intention of involving you.  Fate is fickle; I just happened to encounter them coming in…"


Granny Jing said calmly, her gaze sweeping over the Xuantian Thunder. "This is your spoils of war, it should rightfully belong to you. The Xuantian Thunder is indeed a fine artifact, powerful, capable of severely injuring a mid-Golden Core cultivator; even a late Golden Core cultivator would have to be very careful facing it. Of course, this is only if you can hit them; the Xuantian Thunder's range isn't large…"


Qin Sang looked down at the stone platform beneath her feet.


The runes on the stone platform were identical to those on another platform, only reversed. The door on this platform was now closed, the runes silent.


Everything seemed normal, but she wondered if she could return.


After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang said, "If it weren't for Senior's rescue, I would have been swallowed by the spatial storm caused by the Palm Star Elder. Moreover, Senior paid such a great price, the divine beast Qingluan died…"


Granny Jing suddenly chuckled softly.


This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Granny Jing smile.  It didn't detract from her aura; instead, it added a touch of warmth, making her seem less aloof and distant.


Interrupting Qin Sang, Granny Jing extended her right hand forward, palm up.


Spiritual energy surged in her palm, like surging waves.


When the waves subsided, a Qingluan wooden carving appeared, identical to the previous one.


Accompanied by a phoenix-like cry, the Qingluan came alive, dancing gracefully around Granny Jing, chirping affectionately.


Then, the Qingluan, with a graceful twist of its long neck, spread its wings and flew to Qin Sang's shoulder, preening its feathers and rubbing its cheek against Qin Sang's face.


Its blue feathers were fine and soft, like the finest silk.


Qin Sang didn't dare move. After the Qingluan left, a soft coolness remained on her cheek.


Noticing Qin Sang's shocked expression, Granny Jing smiled, extended a slender jade finger, tapped the Qingluan's head, and softly said, "She likes you…"


Qin Sang was certain that the Qingluan had been swallowed by the spatial storm.


Now, an identical Qingluan appeared!


"Is it really a puppet?"


Qin Sang couldn't help but exclaim, "Senior's puppetry skills are incredibly realistic. I've never heard of anything like it!"


"It's not that my puppetry is so exquisite. I once had the fortune to see Qingluan's true form and personally feel its aura, although not the true body of the divine beast."


Granny Jing explained, her hand stroking the Qingluan's beautiful wings. Her lips parted slightly, and she softly said, "Go!"


Although the Qingluan's aura, like Qin Sang's, was suppressed to the level of a common spirit beast, its speed was still extremely fast, disappearing in the blink of an eye at the entrance of the hall.


Watching the Qingluan disappear, Qin Sang took the Xuantian Thunder, bowed slightly, and said, "Then junior will accept it gratefully."


"I said it was your spoils of war."


Granny Jing nodded indifferently, then her eyes flashed, and she said faintly, "That was the Blood Profane Divine Light, wasn't it? Given the characteristics of the cultivation technique you practice, by melting the Seamless Blood Mulberry into your life essence sword, you can raise it to the level of a magic treasure.  To have obtained one of the Ten Divine Woods… your luck is truly exceptional. No wonder you’ve been reluctant to use your life essence sword, were you afraid I'd take your treasure?"


Granny Jing let out a slight laugh, as if mocking Qin Sang's cowardice.


Qin Sang was prepared, but when Granny Jing mentioned the Ebony Sword, her heart still tensed.


However, Qin Sang hadn't expected Granny Jing to say these words.


Qin Sang repeatedly asked, "Senior knows the 'Chapter of Soul Cultivation of the Sword'?"


Granny Jing stood with her hands behind her back, looking outside the hall, her gaze distant, as if recalling something. After a moment of silence, she said softly, "I not only know the 'Chapter of Soul Cultivation of the Sword' treasured by Mount Shaohua, but I also know that technique is incomplete, only the first five layers, at most reaching the early Golden Core stage…"


The 'Chapter of Soul Cultivation of the Sword' is a cultivation technique treasured by Mount Shaohua. Although disciples are allowed to view it, outsiders only know the basics if they haven't cultivated it.


Grandma Jing’s words revealed an understanding of the “Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation” scripture that was on par with Qin Sang’s.  Only someone who had deeply cultivated this scripture could possess such knowledge.

Just who was Grandma Jing?  What connection did she have to Mount Shao Hua?  Could she herself have cultivated the “Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation”?

While Qin Sang was silently shocked, Grandma Jing’s gaze fell upon him.  “Do you wish for the follow-up cultivation techniques of the ‘Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation’?”

Even Qin Sang, known for his strong will, felt a jolt at those words.

How could he *not* want the follow-up techniques? This scripture had been transformative, showing him a path to the Dao. He couldn’t imagine a more suitable cultivation method, despite it being incomplete.

Reaching the fifth level, his path was blocked. He had two choices: either forge his own continuation of the “Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation,” stumbling forward blindly; or switch to a different scripture.

Self-creation was unlikely. Qin Sang knew his own limitations. His success with the “Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation” was entirely due to the jade Buddha.

Even when comprehending the killing talismans, he relied heavily on the jade Buddha to steady his mind and shield him from the corrosive killing intent, allowing him to follow the scripture methodically.  His understanding of the scripture and the Dao of Killing was far from sufficient for independent creation. This path was too difficult.

Changing scriptures meant abandoning all his previous efforts, losing not only his innate spirit sword, but also the cultivation speed boost provided by the killing talismans.

Unless he could find a similar scripture.

For Qin Sang, this was a challenge comparable to forming his golden core.

However, forming his golden core had consumed most of his energy.  He was fully focused on that, leaving no room for considering what came next.

“Does the senior have the latter half of the ‘Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation’?”

Qin Sang urgently asked, yet remained doubtful. He secretly pondered Grandma Jing’s background, quickly recalling prominent figures in Mount Shao Hua’s history, hoping to find a match.  With her beauty and bearing, she couldn’t have been an unknown figure.

“Not the latter half, but subsequent techniques,”

Grandma Jing looked at Qin Sang, correcting him earnestly.  “Created by another cultivator of the ‘Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation’.”

Independently created techniques!

Qin Sang was startled.

Many Mount Shao Hua disciples had attempted the “Soul-Nourishing Sword Cultivation,” almost all abandoning it early on. The pain of soul-devouring sword energy and corrosive killing intent was unimaginable.  These individuals certainly couldn't have created their own techniques.
