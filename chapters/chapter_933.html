<h1>Chapter 925: Crimson Yuan Sha</h1><p>Chapter 925: Crimson Yuan Sha</p><p>Two figures clashed and separated instantly.</p><p>One stumbled back, unsteady on his feet.</p><p>The other seemed strained as well, pausing momentarily before counterattacking, shouting,  "Let's do this together!"</p><p>After confirming his current strength, Qin Sang didn't want to continue the prolonged fight with the young man from the Fang family. He signaled his avatar and the two-headed insect to join forces and eliminate him.</p><p>The young man from the Fang family, a true disciple of a Yuan Ying-stage Witch Clan master, displayed endless tricks and techniques. His insect armor, formed from a mutated insect, made it difficult to harm his body.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Blood-Pollution Divine Light, unexpectedly destroying the young man's blood sword, but without the Star Conch, he could only suppress him, not kill him.</p><p>By now, the battlefield had moved far from the islet. The young man from the Fang family tried repeatedly to escape Qin Sang’s pursuit, but was easily intercepted every time.</p><p>The two-headed insect joined the fight, immediately changing the tide.  The avatar, a late-stage Jindan cultivator, also wore armor. The two-headed insect had been waiting for the perfect moment to unleash its Azure Shadow divine ability.</p><p>The situation turned favorable.  The young man from the Fang family, facing enemies from three directions, became overwhelmed. Defeat was inevitable.</p><p>With Qin Sang's supreme escape techniques, he had no chance of escape.</p><p>At that moment, a strange glint flashed in the young man’s eyes. A dazzling light erupted from one of his hands, revealing a peculiar talisman, which transformed into a sharp cone.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, a crimson spot bloomed on the chest of the purple insect armor, like a blood flower, instantly spreading across his whole body.</p><p>The already crumbling phantom of the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor unexpectedly began to re-form at a visible speed, but also turned into a monstrous blood-red shadow, like the insect armor.</p><p>The blood-red Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor opened its gigantic eyes, releasing an intensely ferocious aura.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed, a sense of foreboding filling him.</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>The young man from the Fang family roared, wielding the sharp cone, charging straight at Qin Sang.</p><p>The cone instantly drained the surrounding spiritual energy, becoming unstoppable and terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang could only see the vortex-like outline at the tip of the cone, as if it could even suck in his very soul.</p><p>Simultaneously, the blood-red Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor let out a deafening cry, its blood light exploding outward. It lunged forward, knocking Qin Sang's avatar away, then pounced towards Qin Sang, merging with the young man from the Fang family, targeting Qin Sang directly.</p><p>The young man from the Fang family used a forbidden technique from his sect to enhance the power of his insect-gu at the cost of his own potential.</p><p>But his current situation left him no room to consider the future.</p><p>He targeted Qin Sang's body because he knew that killing Qin Sang would remove the last obstacle to his escape.  The other two opponents would become insignificant.</p><p>This was his last desperate gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression was serious, but a cold smile played on his lips.</p><p>On the other side, the two-headed insect roared, its body arching, launching an Azure Shadow attack at the young man from the Fang family.</p><p>The young man seemed to ignore the Azure Shadow, making no attempt to dodge.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Azure Shadow struck directly, causing the blood-red Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor to wail, its blood-red shadow wavering. The young man exerted every ounce of his strength to maintain his balance, his eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, the young man’s face suddenly changed.</p><p>A blue light rapidly expanded in his eyes.  Seizing a momentary opening created by the Azure Shadow’s impact, it easily pierced through the blood-red Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A loud crash followed by the sound of shattering.</p><p>The young man groaned, flying backward. The cone in his hand was almost broken, and his insect armor was cracked, the blood-red shadow of the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor becoming motionless.</p><p>His face was pale, a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.  He attempted another move, but felt a chill at the back of his neck, as a tremendous force struck him, completely shattering his insect armor.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted the Star Conch, soaring towards the young man, he and his avatar attacking the young man from the front and the rear, their attacks never straying from his vital points.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang held the young man’s lifeless body in his hand.</p><p>"After cultivating both body and spirit, and then using the Sword Wheel, my combat power is already comparable to a peak Jindan cultivator.  The Sword Wheel's power should still have room for improvement, probably through the Sword Path..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the battle.  He had essentially dominated the opponent, only facing a slight unexpected turn of events at the end, but even that had been easily resolved.</p><p>This was normal.  The young man from the Fang family was, after all, a disciple of a Yuan Ying cultivator, it would be strange if he didn't have some last-ditch effort.</p><p>Then, he flipped his hand and took out the Star Platform.</p><p>I had hoped to extract information about the young man surnamed Fang and discover how to activate this treasure, but alas, it was not to be.</p><p>"This man apparently didn't know the true origin of the Star Platform either. The Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch claimed it was a Wu tribe treasure.  That's why the Lan Dou Sect, despite possessing it for so long, never uncovered its true nature, using it only as a tool to cultivate the 'Control Thunder Technique'. A Wu tribe treasure...what kind of treasure warrants such drastic action from the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch?  And the Star Platform's shape is so peculiar, a half-moon. I tested it on a hapless Wu cultivator in the Crackwind Archipelago using divine runes, but to no avail..."</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Star Platform again and again.</p><p>He had tried countless times over the years, yet remained unable to unlock its secrets.</p><p>"Forget it!  It already helped me cultivate the 'Sky Demon Transformation,' that's more than enough good fortune," Qin Sang shook his head, putting away the Star Platform and gathering the young man's belongings.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the Blood Corpse Insects have been retrieved by the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch! This blood sword is a valuable mid-grade magic weapon, though not as handy as my natal spirit sword.  I'll give it to my clone for now.  This Crimson Yuan Shawl is quite interesting, though, not of this world..."</p><p>Qin Sang held a piece of soft red gauze. Even he, a master artificer, couldn't fathom the materials used, a fact that even the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch couldn't rectify.  </p><p>This treasure could conceal one's aura.  The young man surnamed Fang had used it to move freely throughout the human realm.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Qin Sang tossed the corpse to his clone, then returned to the island, carefully erasing all traces of his presence before departing.</p><p>Relying on the 'Sky Demon Transformation', Qin Sang moved freely through the Demon Sea. Instead of returning to Sea Toad Island by ship, he journeyed home alone, deliberately avoiding contact with other cultivators.</p><p>Even if the Black Serpent Mountain Patriarch himself arrived, he would be unable to trace him.</p><p>With this matter concluded, Qin Sang awaited the opening of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Before that, helping his clone refine the previously absorbed blood beads would allow it to reach the peak of the Core Formation stage.  With time to spare before the Seven Killing Hall's opening, Qin Sang found a deserted island in the Demon Sea, establishing a secluded cave and entering closed cultivation with his clone.</p><p>During his seclusion, Qin Sang reflected.</p><p>He had done everything he could. Whether he would achieve his goal in the Seven Killing Hall remained in the hands of fate.</p>
