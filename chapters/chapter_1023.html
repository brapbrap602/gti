<h1>Chapter 1115: The Life Talisman</h1><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>After an unsuccessful search, the High Priestess pondered for a moment, then gently placed the stone disc onto the recess.</p><p>‘Click… click…’</p><p>Without any further action, the stone disc began to rotate on its own, its speed steadily increasing.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>In the next moment, the heavy stone slabs slowly parted to the sides, revealing a doorway before the assembled crowd.</p><p>Witnessing this, everyone exchanged glances.  They hadn't expected the stone door to open so easily.</p><p>No one dared to be careless. Instead of rushing into the stone hall, they each summoned their protective talismans and magical treasures, their eyes fixed on the hall, ready for anything.</p><p>The stone hall was dim and silent.</p><p>An unknown barrier seemed to be present within, blocking their divine senses and preventing them from probing its depths.</p><p>The High Priestess hesitated for a moment, gesturing for the others to remain outside as she prepared to enter.</p><p>Ku Yechan flashed to the front, saying calmly, "My遁术 isn't as good as yours. I'll scout ahead. However, let's be clear, if what you seek isn't here, I'll leave immediately. Regarding the conditions you agreed to…"</p><p>The High Priestess interrupted, her voice firm, "Fellow Daoist Fang, you needn't worry. Regardless of the outcome, I will honor my promise."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Ku Yechan flew silently into the stone hall, disappearing from everyone's sight.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Seven Kills Hall, on the white jade plaza.</p><p>The entrance to the inner hall opened.</p><p>Spiritual Master's gaze fell upon the assembled Nascent Soul Grandmasters. "The inner hall is currently without a master, so I'll take the liberty of overseeing things. I presume you are all familiar with the rules of the Trial Realm. Within the Boundless Sea, all fellow Daoists who successfully break through to the Nascent Soul stage have one opportunity to enter the Trial Realm. If you haven't participated in the trials before and wish to enter now, please step forward."</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>More than twenty cultivators stepped forward from the front ranks of the Nascent Soul Grandmasters.</p><p>Seeing this, a hint of surprise flickered in Spiritual Master's eyes. "The number of fellow Daoists participating in the trials this time is higher than in previous openings. Fellow Daoist Wen Xian, if I recall correctly, you only formed your Nascent Soul some forty years ago. Isn't it a bit hasty to participate in the trials so soon?"</p><p>Spiritual Master looked at a Daoist and asked directly.</p><p>The Daoist, with a Seven Star Sword strapped to his back and an ancient appearance, seemed to have some prior connection with Spiritual Master. He respectfully bowed before answering, "Rumors abound that the shortening intervals between the Seven Kills Hall openings are due to changes in the Immortal Restrictions, and no one knows what changes the future holds.  Even if I cultivate diligently for several hundred more years, my chances of passing the trials remain uncertain. By then, the Trial Realm's very existence might be in question. I fear that if I miss this opportunity, there may be no further trials. Even if I don't obtain any rewards, broadening my horizons is valuable…"</p><p>"Indeed, we share Fellow Daoist Wen Xian's concerns. If we wait any longer, the Seven Kills Hall might cease to exist.  You two, being far more knowledgeable about the Seven Kills Hall than us, could you shed some light on why these changes are occurring?"</p><p>Other Nascent Soul cultivators voiced their agreement with Wen Xian, some looking at Spiritual Master, others at the Demonic Lord.</p><p>Spiritual Master chuckled. "The Trial Realm was established by our predecessors, drawing upon the power of the Immortal Restrictions, as a boon for future generations.  Once formed, it cannot be altered. The depths of the inner hall are layered with ancient restrictions, concealing countless secrets. The areas explored by us human cultivators account for less than a tenth of the whole. I know no more than you do. However, based on my observations, aside from the shortened intervals between appearances, there are no other anomalies with the Seven Kills Hall. The timing of the inner hall's emergence was never fixed, though the fluctuations have been more pronounced recently. More frequent appearances of the Seven Kills Hall simply mean more opportunities for us to enter the inner hall, which is not necessarily a bad thing…"</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Nascent Soul cultivators fell into contemplation, but none withdrew.</p><p>Spiritual Master paused, then continued, "Since you are all resolved, please enter through the right-side door…"</p><p>His words were abruptly cut short.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>A wealthy-looking elder bowed to Spiritual Master.  "Master Spiritual Master, I wish to forgo the trials and offer my qualification to a junior."</p><p>Spiritual Master looked at him curiously. "Fellow Daoist Mu, your junior can freely enter the Trial Realm for training, without restriction… Wait… Do you mean…?"</p><p>The wealthy-looking elder nodded. "Indeed. I recall that there's a rule in the Trial Realm: if I relinquish my qualification, I can exchange it for a Life Talisman to bestow upon a junior."</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>A nearby elder in gray robes sighed, "Old Mu, no wonder you brought that young lady! Everyone only has one chance to participate in the trials. You're truly willing to give yours up!"</p><p>The wealthy-looking elder replied calmly, "If the Seven Kills Hall emerged at its normal intervals, I might still have a chance to obtain a reward after another hundred years or so. Forcing my way in now would only be a waste of an opportunity."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mu, you are mistaken. Even without obtaining a reward, entering the Trial Realm once would be beneficial. Throughout history, very few have made the same choice as you."</p><p>Spiritual Master shook his head, trying to dissuade the elder.</p><p>The wealthy-looking elder cupped his hands. "My mind is made up. Please instruct me on how to condense a Life Talisman."</p><p>Seeing this, Spiritual Master offered no further objections, pointing towards the plaque.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do it this way…"</p><p>The wealthy-looking elder stepped forward, reaching into the beam of light.</p><p>A moment later, the light pulsed, and a speck of azure light flew out from the plaque, slowly descending into the elder's palm. It was a glistening jade token.</p><p>In the center of the token was a blood-red ancient character—'生' (Life).</p><p>The wealthy-looking elder's face lit up with joy. He descended the steps and handed the Life Talisman to a young maiden.</p><p>The young maiden, now realizing the immense sacrifice her grandfather had made for her, clutched the Life Talisman tightly, her gaze resolute.</p><p>Envious gazes fell upon the young maiden.</p><p>Although most didn't know the purpose of the Life Talisman, the fact that it required a Nascent Soul Grandmaster to sacrifice their opportunity suggested its immense value within the Trial Realm.</p><p>She had a Nascent Soul Grandmaster looking out for her.</p><p>That was something to envy.</p><p>Qin Sang, overhearing the surrounding cultivators' discussions, couldn't quite grasp the specifics, but it was clear that this Life Talisman was exceedingly rare, with limited knowledge of its true function.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please proceed…"</p><p>Spiritual Master gestured.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators prepared to participate in the trials and entered the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>At the entrance to the hall, an invisible barrier shimmered as each person walked through, their figures vanishing instantly.</p><p>After the last Nascent Soul Grandmaster entered, Spiritual Master turned to the assembled Core Formation cultivators. His voice was calm.  "With your level of cultivation, wandering freely within the inner hall is no different from courting death. According to the rules, only Core Formation cultivators who complete at least three trials will be recognized. Therefore, to enter the inner hall, you must first enter the Trial Realm."</p>
