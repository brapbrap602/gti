<h1>Chapter 501: Human Endeavor Has Its Limits; Do Not Force Matters</h1><p>Chapter 501: Human Endeavor Has Its Limits; Do Not Force Matters</p><p>After all, this is the most effective auxiliary spirit herb in today's cultivation world for forming Golden Core. Even a prodigiously talented dual-spirit-root cultivator wouldn't pass up the chance to obtain such a medicine.</p><p>More hope means more possibilities.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A stream of light suddenly flew out from the crack in the door, flashing before Qin Sang before splitting into three, each flying in a different direction.</p><p>Three!</p><p>Qin Sang was fortunate that he hadn't directly returned to his sect. Otherwise, facing the pressure of three Golden Core cultivators, it would be uncertain whether he could keep the spirit herb.</p><p>Although he ultimately failed, he wouldn't just hand over the opportunity.</p><p>The cave remained silent for a moment before Qi Yuanshou's voice echoed again, "What are your plans now?"</p><p>What are my plans?</p><p>A trace of dejection appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. He bowed and said, "I beg Master Qi to guide me. Is it still possible for me… to form a Golden Core?"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou didn't answer directly. "Tell me in detail about the changes in your cultivation after taking those two spirit herbs, and your own insights."</p><p>"After taking the herbs, the effect was slightly better than the Kanli Golden Core Pill…"</p><p>While Qi Yuanshou still hadn't opened the cave, Qin Sang stood outside, facing the stone door, and detailed every change in his body from the moment he took the medicine to when its effects wore off.</p><p>He dared not conceal anything; his future depended on it.</p><p>"A five-spirit-root cultivator…"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou sighed softly. "It seems that the spirit fruit didn't completely break the limitations of your talent…"</p><p>He even knows this?</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly surprised.  A casual remark he made during a conversation with Senior Brother Wen when he first entered the sect had reached Qi Yuanshou's ears.</p><p>He didn't expect Qi Yuanshou to be so concerned about him.</p><p>"Talent…"</p><p>Qin Sang was unwilling to accept this. "Is there truly no path left for me? Are there any Golden Core cultivation methods among the other Masters and Grandmasters that they can teach me? I will do anything!"</p><p>He possessed three Ten Directions Yan Luo Banners.  Since the majority of Kuiyin Ancestor's Ten Directions Yan Luo Banners were destroyed, it was impossible to assemble the complete formation, so one was sufficient.</p><p>Even Golden Core cultivators from Mount Shaohua would find it hard to refuse the temptation of such a treasure.</p><p>And there was the iron ring left by the Dove Robe Daoist.</p><p>He wasn't greedy; he only sought to form his Golden Core.</p><p>For Golden Core cultivators, exchanging a Golden Core cultivation method for a magic treasure was an incredibly profitable deal, and they wouldn't refuse.</p><p>He could offer these things!</p><p>As for the Nine Illusory Heavenly Orchid, unless truly desperate, Qin Sang would never trade it. This spirit herb represented a glimmer of hope for forming a Nascent Soul.</p><p>Having come this far, as long as he could form a Golden Core, the Nascent Soul stage wouldn't be unattainable.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou chuckled. "If there were truly superior Golden Core cultivation methods, would they still covet your Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris? Today's cultivation world is but a fragmented world, not the prosperous ancient times where heavenly treasures were abundant and secret cultivation methods readily available. Those two spirit herbs are the best medicines available now. If it weren't for the inter-region duel, how could they have fallen into your hands? Yet, you only achieved this much with them.  Even if you obtained other spirit herbs, what difference would it make?"</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>After a period of silence.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou's tone softened slightly.</p><p>"I'll give you two pieces of advice, gained from my decades guarding the Skull Hanging Pass.</p><p>"Firstly, human endeavor has its limits; do not force matters.</p><p>"Failing to form a Golden Core and dying with regrets has been the fate of countless cultivators, including many dual-spirit-root and triple-spirit-root cultivators, let alone you?</p><p>"Don't let obsession lead you into the demonic path. I don't want to personally purge the sect.</p><p>"Secondly, everyone has their own destiny.</p><p>"With your five-spirit-root aptitude, you reached the False Golden Core stage in a hundred years; outsiders may deem this a miracle. Only those in the know understand that your ability to persevere through the '玄牝玉鼎真经' (Xuánpìn Yùdǐng Zhēnjīng) in the early stages of foundation building and endure the pain of the '元神养剑章' (Yuánshén Yǎngjiàn Zhāng) was perfectly normal. These cultivation methods were your destiny.</p><p>"In the future, perhaps another destiny will help you form your Golden Core.</p><p>"However… time passes, and those who lose their fighting spirit due to a lack of hope are far more numerous. You should ask yourself honestly, is your Dao heart firm?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and said without hesitation, "Disciple's heart is wholly devoted to the Dao!"</p><p>Qi Yuanshou responded with a hum.</p><p>"If that's the case, I'll give you a Skull Hanging Guard token. Take this token to Skull Hanging Pass and join the Skull Hanging Guard, gaining some experience.</p><p>"Three years later, the spiritual tide will be nearing its end. You can then use your identity as a Skull Hanging Guard to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and inspect the hidden realms as soon as possible.</p><p>"At that time, with the spiritual tide receding, some hidden restrictions will be revealed. If you're lucky enough to discover a few newly opened realms and gain a head start, you might encounter an extraordinary opportunity to change your destiny."</p><p>For the past three years, you needn't venture out to fight the cloud beasts. Stay within the borders and rest.  Since you've reached the False Core stage, you don't need to train relentlessly.  Mix with the common folk, experience the joys of mortal life; there's much to discover...</p><p>A streak of light flew from the cave and landed in Qin Sang's palm. The light dissipated, revealing a Hanging Skull Guard token.</p><p>Three years.</p><p>Qin Sang held the token, noting the timeframe in Qi Yuan Shou's words.</p><p>Three years later, the spiritual tide would reach its peak and then end.  The third year is when the Zi Wei Palace opens.</p><p>The war between the two realms suddenly ceased at its height—certainly related to the opening of the Zi Wei Palace. This timing is as I expected.</p><p>Musing on this, Qin Sang glanced at the token.  He'd seen a Hanging Skull Guard token from Yu Yangzi; this one is identical, signifying a captain's rank.</p><p>Since the spiritual tide began, the ancient teleportation array of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace has remained open, transporting people in groups as they gather.  There's no rush to travel.</p><p>Still, it's best to reach Hanging Skull Pass as soon as possible.</p><p>My agreements with Jing Po Po and Yun Youzi require careful planning and early preparation.</p><p>With this token, I won't be unexpectedly conscripted to hunt cloud beasts upon entering Hanging Skull Pass. And after the spiritual tide ends, I can immediately enter the ancient fairy battlefield to seek opportunities.</p><p>This is a significant favor; Qi Yuan Shou has clearly gone to great lengths.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply grateful.  He respectfully said, "Disciple will always remember Master Qi's kindness."</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou began to speak, then paused, letting out a barely perceptible sigh. He abruptly dismissed him, "I'm entering seclusion and will see no one. Take the token and go to Hanging Skull Pass quickly. Don't delay.  From now on…take care of yourself! Go!"</p><p>"Alas…"</p><p>Taken aback, Qin Sang felt a tightening, then a blur, as he was transported to the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The mist closed in, obscuring the peak.</p><p>Gao Yang stood within the mist, waving to Qin Sang before hurrying back.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to postpone his questions for Qi Yuan Shou until later.</p><p>Leaving his sect.</p><p>Qin Sang reached an unnamed mountain, standing on the peak for a day and a night.</p><p>Watching the sun rise and set, the moon wax and wane.</p><p>His gaze grew increasingly resolute.</p>
