Chapter 482: The False Core Realm


Ji Wu's choice caught Qin Sang off guard, completely disrupting his plans.


Obtaining the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower didn't guarantee successful core formation.  Qin Sang hadn't personally experienced it, but judging from the abysmal success rate of countless predecessors, he knew how difficult it was.


He had no confidence and needed a backup plan.


Jiu Pao Dao Ren's golden core was the only one Qin Sang foresaw a chance of obtaining.


Opportunity knocks but once.


Before leaving Stargazing Island, the Serpent Woman had explicitly told them that the battles ahead wouldn't be intense.  Given their hard work and contributions, they could use the pretext of sensing a breakthrough opportunity and returning to the sect for closed-door cultivation to temporarily leave the Turbulent Island waters—a kind of special reward.


Having obtained the Gui Fu Pill, Ji Wu likely wouldn't stay in the Turbulent Island waters for long.  Jiu Pao Dao Ren needed urgent treatment, so the sooner he was sent back, the better.


However, Ji Wu was solitary and rarely interacted with outsiders.  With such a precious item as the Gui Fu Pill on him, he wouldn't dare flaunt it; any departure would be clandestine and unnoticed.


Qin Sang couldn't track his exact whereabouts.


After sitting in his cave for a while, Qin Sang abruptly rose, left a note, and silently exited.  After circling for a long time to ensure no one was following, he flew out of the True Water Thousand Illusions Array.


Leaving the Turbulent Island waters was risky.  The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were far more tempting than the Gui Fu Pill, and he couldn't consume them until he reached the False Core Realm.  Someone might try to take a gamble.


Therefore, he was extremely cautious. Fortunately, he wasn't followed.


Others probably wouldn't have imagined Qin Sang daring to leave the Turbulent Island waters at this time.


After flying out of the array, Qin Sang hid in the shadows, maintaining utmost vigilance.  After flying northeast for a distance, he arrived at a desolate islet.


This island was only slightly larger than his cave in the Turbulent Island waters, quite inconspicuous.


It was already dawn on the second day.  The morning sun shone on the island's withered grass; a gentle breeze bent the stems, resembling a golden carpet.


Unfortunately, this area was thin on spiritual energy. While scenic, it wasn't suitable for a cave dwelling.


Unexpectedly, after inspecting the area, Qin Sang decided to establish his cave here.


Protecting himself with spiritual energy, he dove into the water and continued to descend until he reached the bottom.  Qin Sang cleared away the dense aquatic plants and carved out a cave at the base of the island.  He carefully set up arrays and restrictions, focusing on protection, concealment, and early warning.


The narrow cave could barely accommodate a spirit gathering array.


Qin Sang had made a small fortune at the Heavenly Finger Peak and didn't stint on spirit stones. He set up the best spirit gathering array, and the cave's spiritual energy rapidly thickened.


After circulating his cultivation method for one cycle, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction.


Then, he focused his mind on his spiritual space, removed the Xu Yuan Seal from the Heart-Eating Insect, unsealed it, and exposed it, allowing the insect's aura to freely disperse.


This cave wasn't randomly chosen. Qin Sang had carefully surveyed the area.


If Ji Wu wanted to return to the Demon Flame Sect as quickly as possible, there was a high probability he would pass through these waters.


A Heart-Eating Insect was like a slave; most people couldn't resist such a temptation.


Qin Sang hadn't ruled out setting ambushes elsewhere, or even luring Ji Wu near the Demon Flame Sect. However, his cultivation was inferior to Ji Wu's, and Ji Wu possessed a flying artifact far superior to the You Luo Cloud. Even with all-out effort, he couldn't outpace Ji Wu.


Furthermore, attracting Jiu Pao Dao Ren would be a disaster.


After weighing the pros and cons, Qin Sang chose to carve a cave here, waiting for Ji Wu while refining the pills obtained from the handsome young man, without delaying his cultivation progress.


Even if the assassination failed, he could quickly reach the False Core Realm and implement a backup plan.


The cave was hidden underwater, with Qin Sang's meticulously prepared arrays. Even if cultivators passed by, they wouldn't suspect anyone would establish a cave in such a barren place.


Only someone familiar with Heart-Eating Insects would discover Qin Sang's presence.


The Kui Yin Sect's Golden Core cultivators were all dead, so Qin Sang wasn't afraid of attracting opponents he couldn't handle. If any other Kui Yin Sect remnants were foolish enough to show up, he would welcome them.


Having made his preparations, Qin Sang set aside his worries, took out the pills from his storage pouch, and entered deep meditation.


As he refined pill after pill, Qin Sang's aura steadily increased.  He was already close to the False Core Realm, and these pills accelerated his cultivation even more.


The cave was silent, the passage of time unmarked.  In the dim light, faint traces of sword slashes scarred the walls.  Within this rough-hewn stone chamber, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the cold stone, motionless except to replace the spirit stones when their energy depleted, wholly absorbed in his cultivation.

After an unknown period, a soft sigh echoed through the cave.  It wasn't a sigh of regret, but of relief, tinged with unconcealed joy.

Qin Sang sat up straight, stretching languidly. He awoke fully, his eyes bright with an unusual gleam as he examined his body.

Finally, Foundation Establishment complete; the False Core stage!

His cultivation had stagnated, reaching its limit, now only awaiting Core Formation.

However, Qin Sang sensed a residual restlessness in his aura, advising a period of consolidation before attempting the next breakthrough.

The lingering damage to his foundation was a minor drawback, insignificant compared to the elation of reaching the False Core stage.

Sitting casually on the ground, chin in hand, Qin Sang savored this rare tranquility.  Peaceful moments are fleeting; the path ahead remained fraught with peril.

He reflected on the years gone by.

From his arrival in this world, to Foundation Establishment, and beyond.

Since achieving Foundation Establishment, over seventy years had passed.  Seventy years without a moment's respite, facing countless dangers, seizing every opportunity.

Morning Smoke Fairy, the Corpse Cave, Hanging Skull Pass, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Boundless Valley, the Turbulent Islands, Sky Point Peak…

One by one, fragments of memory flashed through his mind.

No joy, no sorrow, only remembrance.

He had not wasted his time, nor betrayed himself, reaching this point.

The future was uncertain.

But at least, looking back, he could proudly say – no regrets.

“Hmph!”

Lost in thought for at least an hour, Qin Sang collected his scattered thoughts, exhaling deeply. He steadied himself, his eyes sharpening.

He estimated that nearly a month had passed since he established this cave.  During that time, he’d sensed several cultivators flying overhead, but not Ji Wu.

The cave's prohibitions remained undisturbed.  Ji Wu was either still within the Turbulent Islands or had taken a different route, remaining elusive.

Qin Sang had deliberately left the Heart-Eating Insect unsealed, yet Ji Wu hadn't taken the bait. His normally infallible lure had failed!
