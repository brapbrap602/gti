<h1>Chapter 1873: Trivial Matters</h1><p>Learning that Qin Sang intended to stay, Jian Nu happily said, "This old servant frequently cleans the Real Person's cave…"</p><p>He quickly led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang silently shook his head.  The cave, inside and out, was protected by spirit arrays and spotless; what need was there for cleaning?</p><p>When he first met Jian Nu, the latter already possessed late-Yuan Ying cultivation. Now, observing his aura, he was only a step away from becoming a Divine Transformation cultivator.  In the Storm World, he would be a dominant figure, yet Jian Nu truly considered himself a servant. Qin Sang wondered just how great the favor was that the Sword Real Person had bestowed upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang found it inappropriate to comment, understanding that Jian Nu's heartfelt reverence was for the Sword Real Person, and his feelings towards him stemmed from this devotion.</p><p>Reaching the cave's entrance, Qin Sang saw that rare and exotic flowers bloomed vibrantly, fresh and elegant, just as he remembered them.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist friend," Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Jian Nu responded humbly, bowing before retreating.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Sword Real Person's cave, waved his hand to open the protective formation, and entered.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, Qin Sang pondered his next tasks.  He needed to handle these minor matters before he could fully dedicate himself to seclusion and cultivation.</p><p>War was imminent, and Star Island and Immortal Lake might not escape the conflict. He wondered how much peaceful time remained.</p><p>Tapping his knees lightly, Qin Sang's mind stirred, summoning the Refining Altar.</p><p>The altar's door swung open, and two spirits flew out – the two demon lords he had captured.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The two demons landed heavily on the ground, their senses sealed by a restrictive formation, as if asleep.</p><p>Both were now only spirits, manifesting in their beast forms.</p><p>Gui Hou belonged to the cinnamon dog tribe; a cursory glance might mistake him for a fox demon.</p><p>The female demon was a beast covered in green scales, resembling a horse, yet distinct upon closer inspection.</p><p>*Pfft! Pfft!*</p><p>Qin Sang flicked two beams of light, which pierced the demons' brows.</p><p>The two demons shuddered, abruptly awakening. Instinctively, they leaped up, alert and wary. Upon recognizing Qin Sang and realizing they were only spirits, they recalled their ordeal on the Refining Altar, their expressions falling into dejection.</p><p>Gui Hou instantly decided to prostrate himself before Qin Sang, his forepaws covering his head, not daring to move.</p><p>The female demon was stunned for a moment, then sighed, her four legs planted firmly on the ground, her head bowed.</p><p>She remembered Qin Sang's earlier promise not to kill her, and understood that he wouldn't easily release her.</p><p>Both demons adopted a submissive posture.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the female demon's title, Luo Hou.  His gaze swept over them as he asked, "Your physical bodies are destroyed. Is there any way to recover them?"</p><p>For demon cultivators, their physical bodies and bloodline powers were paramount. Qin Sang wasn't sure if the demons of this world possessed methods to cultivate their spirits; otherwise, their usefulness would be greatly diminished.</p><p>Hearing this, the two demons stirred.  This tone didn't sound like he was about to kill them.</p><p>Could it be…?</p><p>Gui Hou cautiously raised a forepaw, poked out his head, hesitated, then gritted his teeth. "This small demon has comprehended a lifeblood supernatural power. As long as some essence blood remains, there's hope of rebuilding the physical body. When…when the Upper Immortal shattered my body, this small demon secretly used this power to extract some essence blood…"</p><p>This clearly wasn't the Refining Altar in Guishan. Their king hadn't rescued him; Gui Hou's only hope was dashed.</p><p>He didn't want to die. He sensed a different meaning in Qin Sang's words, vaguely guessing the truth, and decided to reveal everything to seize this last chance.</p><p>In fact, in the Gui Fang Kingdom, not all beasts resisted servitude; some would rather die than submit.</p><p>After all, their ancestors had served as soldiers under Daoist Real Persons.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Gui Hou, his gaze peculiar, making Gui Hou feel uneasy.</p><p>He had been completely unaware when Qin Sang had imprisoned his spirit.</p><p>Recalling his previous encounters with Xia Hou and Ding Xiang Hou, he realized the supernatural powers of the demons in this realm were exceptionally profound.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, neither confirming nor denying, then turned to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou, despite her rough exterior, was thoughtful. She also guessed that Qin Sang wanted to subdue them.</p><p>Her expression shifted from joy to worry. She didn't possess Gui Hou's mystical ability.  "Reporting to the Upper Immortal, this small demon originally belonged to the Shadow Horse tribe of Luo River. My bloodline underwent a mutation, awakening a trace of the Azure Lightning Beast bloodline, resulting in my current state. To seize a new body, I would need a Shadow Horse body that has awakened, or is about to awaken, the same bloodline. Only then could I hope to restore my full strength…"</p><p>Shadow Horses with awakened Azure Lightning Beast bloodlines were incredibly rare – at least she couldn't think of a suitable one now.</p><p>After learning Luo River's location in Gui Fang Kingdom, Qin Sang temporarily abandoned the idea of helping her, saying indifferently, "Are you willing to open your minds and allow me to set a restrictive formation? Follow me, and past transgressions will be forgotten. In the future, crimes will be punished, and merits rewarded!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't promise great opportunities, nor did he immediately produce the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique*. His tone even carried a chilling coldness.</p><p>Two demons, upon hearing this, felt strangely reassured.  They exchanged a glance and simultaneously bowed, "We pledge our allegiance to you, Master."</p><p>Having subdued the two demons, Qin Sang pointed to a corner of the cave dwelling and instructed them to cultivate there independently.</p><p>Luo Hou was currently refining his spirit essence, while Gui Hou was materializing his blood essence to begin restoring his physical body.  They would freely request anything they needed from Qin Sang.</p><p>Looking at the two demons, Qin Sang mused, "Including Mo Xingdao, that makes four…"</p><p>To navigate the Illusory Storm, four Nascent Soul cultivators were still insufficient, especially since Mo Xingdao and the two demons were only at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"War isn't entirely bad; it's a time for opportunistic gains.  We can take advantage of the chaos to subdue a few demon lords…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>Even without cultivating an army, one could still use the military training grounds to train troops.</p><p>Newly subdued demon cultivators wouldn't necessarily be completely loyal. As long as they helped him find the path to ascension, their disloyalty didn't matter.</p><p>…</p><p>After staying several days on Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang activated his flying talisman and flew towards the Kettle Island.</p><p>Kettle Island's defenses were far stricter; Qin Sang passed through several checkpoints before reaching Master Qi's residence.</p><p>Master Qi had passed away, yet the ‘Qi Residence’ plaque still hung on the gate.</p><p>"Senior has returned!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Master Qi’s disciples were overjoyed.  They immediately went to wake their fellow disciples who were in seclusion, and the mansion instantly became bustling.</p><p>Master Qi’s eldest disciple arrived last, hurrying to Qin Sang and presenting a letter, "Senior, this is a letter for you, delivered to the residence not long ago."</p><p>Qin Sang took it, scanned it with his divine sense, and saw that it was from Master Gu.</p><p>After reading it, Qin Sang frowned, pondered for a moment, put away the letter, and headed towards Master Qi’s former fire chamber, instructing his eldest disciple to call the other disciples over.</p><p>Though Qin Sang only permitted them to call him "Senior," the disciples still revered him as their master, behaving respectfully in his presence.  Qin Sang did not disappoint their expectations, testing their abilities one by one.</p><p>Master Qi had three direct disciples, all present at the residence. Their natural talent was inferior to Master Qi’s, but they were diligent.  Qin Sang saw them as competent and capable of maintaining the status quo, but unlikely to restore the Qi Residence’s former glory in this generation.</p><p>After the examination, Qin Sang kept the three disciples, handing them a jade slip and a storage device.  "Use these treasures to acquire the spiritual materials listed on this jade slip.  I will be staying at the residence for a while; you may observe me during the refining process."</p><p>The three were ecstatic and immediately accepted their task.</p><p>The materials Qin Sang asked them to gather were used for refining array components, to repair the Flower Field Formation. The principles were similar.</p><p>With war approaching, people’s hearts were unsettled, and many cultivators were trading away their long-held treasures for life-saving items.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at the Qi Residence for a year, successfully refining all the array components—even faster than anticipated—and fortunately obtained several precious materials needed to re-refine the Mingshan Armor.</p><p>The disciples reluctantly saw Qin Sang off.</p><p>Leaving Kettle Island, Qin Sang flew calmly over the water, playing with a jade token.</p><p>Using the teleportation array to enter the northern region of Star Island's Immortal North Lake, he flew further north until a misty spirit island appeared in view.</p><p>This island was much larger than Sword Heart Island, but less spiritually abundant; it could only support the cultivation of one Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Previously, such islands always had owners, and finding an unclaimed one in Star Island's Immortal Lake wasn't easy.</p><p>Due to the turmoil, cultivators were fleeing to the inner lake for refuge. Qin Sang managed to rent this island from a sect, paying fifty years' rent in advance.</p><p>"Friend Mo, you’ve finally arrived.”</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the shore, activating the jade token to open the island's restriction.</p><p>The mist parted, revealing the stone path and pavilion within. Before Qin Sang finished speaking, a figure darted from the pavilion—Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"Thanks to the hospitality of that wolf demon, I couldn't just freeload. I had to contribute to my master's cause. I helped it clear a few obstacles before leaving, which delayed me," Mo Xingdao explained.</p><p>Qin Sang had sent a message to Mo Xingdao several months ago, instructing him to leave the demon kingdom.</p><p>Staying in the demon kingdom during the upcoming war would be inconvenient, as the Gui Fang Kingdom would certainly conduct thorough checks.</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang chuckled.  “Isn't it already a national teacher? What obstacles could there be?  Is it aiming to seize control of the demon kingdom?"</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang gestured to Mo Xingdao, stepping forward and pointing at the island's peak,  "See what kind of cave dwelling I've prepared for you…"</p><p>Mo Xingdao followed, chuckling.  "It's thanks to your guidance. Given more time, cooperating with the snake demon, it might really be able to usurp power and become the ruler of a nation."</p><p>Mo Xingdao seemed in good spirits. Qin Sang glanced at him, clasped his hands, and offered his congratulations: "Congratulations, Daoist Mo, on overcoming your difficulties and restoring your Nascent Soul cultivation!"</p><p>Daoist Mo's appearance was identical to his former physical body; there was no sign of his puppet-like form.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mo Xingdao looked at Qin Sang and offered a wry smile.  The last time they had met, Qin Sang had yet to break through in his cultivation of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.  Although Qin Sang didn't outwardly display any signs of his power, Mo Xingdao felt an even greater pressure emanating from Qin Sang than before, indicating significant progress that was completely unfathomable to him. The two, once equals, were now increasingly distant.</p><p>Reaching a stone pavilion on the island, they sat down casually. Mo Xingdao eagerly asked, "Friend Qin, how did your exploration of the Jushan altar progress?"  The original plan was for Mo Xingdao to join Qin Sang after recovering his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly and briefly recounted the events at the altar to Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"The rumors were true!" Mo Xingdao murmured.  Hidden in the Yao Kingdom, he was isolated from information. Over the past year, he'd heard many rumors, holding onto a sliver of hope, only to find the reality far worse than he imagined. He looked towards the northern horizon, appearing distraught.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Mo Xingdao's feelings and offered comfort: "The Great Sage's attack shouldn't have destroyed the path to ascension. I believe there's always a way, and I'll do everything I can.  Daoist Mo, rest assured."</p><p>Mo Xingdao suddenly stood up, bowed deeply to Qin Sang, and said hoarsely, "All my hope rests on you, Daoist Qin.  Command me as you see fit; I would gladly die for you!"</p><p>"There's no need for such talk," Qin Sang said, shaking his head and sighing as he helped Mo Xingdao up.</p><p>After further discussion, Qin Sang left the jade tablet controlling the island's restrictions with Mo Xingdao, then soared away on his magic light. He first returned to Sword Heart Island. Learning that the Sword Master was still in seclusion, he left Star Island and headed southwest.  He visited True Ru Venerable at the New Mirror Terrace Temple, discussing the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>After a month, he bid farewell to True Ru Venerable and continued westward.  Upon reaching Baishi, Qin Sang first visited Master Lingxu, presenting a new formula and receiving newly refined Yinghua Pills. Finally, he came to the Baishi altar, bowing to the golden-armored guards: "I am Qingfeng. I have a prior engagement with Left Venerable. I humbly request you announce my arrival."</p><p>The golden-armored guard, initially wary, looked intently at Qin Sang upon hearing this. "Left Venerable has instructed us to watch for you. Since you are Daoist Qingfeng, there is no need for announcement. Please, come with me."</p><p>As he spoke, clouds formed beneath the guard's feet, gesturing for Qin Sang to join him, and they flew into the air.</p><p>From the clouds, Qin Sang looked down and saw the Merit and Instruction Halls he had visited before.  They continued towards the golden hall deep within the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the passage through several layers of formations; the view ahead became clearer, revealing a majestic golden hall.  Its scale was comparable to the Jushan altar, yet it showed no signs of damage.</p><p>Approaching, Qin Sang felt the powerful aura emanating from several of the golden halls – evidently, the residences of the Grand Masters.  While the golden-armored guard seemed unfazed, Qin Sang remained tense.</p><p>They descended to a platform, and the guard led Qin Sang on foot to a golden hall before withdrawing.</p><p>Left Venerable, already informed of Qin Sang’s arrival, stood before the hall and greeted him with a smile: "Daoist Qingfeng, it's been a while."</p><p>Surprised by the personal welcome, Qin Sang quickly stepped forward, bowing deeply: "Qingfeng greets Senior Left. I've been preoccupied with various matters this past year and haven't been able to fulfill our agreement promptly. I hope you will forgive me."  Qin Sang had intended to wait for the Sword Master's emergence to visit Left Venerable together, but the delay had become excessive.</p><p>They entered the hall and sat down. Qin Sang produced a jade box and presented it: "The Lingyou King's demon pill is here."</p><p>Left Venerable treated it as an ordinary item, neither opening the box nor examining it, casually placing it on the table: "The Great Sage's attack caused chaos at the altar, and I was preoccupied with saving people.  I couldn't attend to you. Were you injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang covertly observed Left Venerable, noticing little change in his aura compared to the altar. This showed how difficult it was to recover after self-reducing one's cultivation.</p><p>"Thanks to your care, Senior, I found a place to hide when things turned dangerous. I'm unharmed.  But I wonder about the Heavenly Court in the end…" Qin Sang probed cautiously.</p><p>"The Heavenly Court's emergence was a fabrication, a plot by the Guifang Kingdom," Left Venerable said calmly, his tone revealing no emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled; he hadn't anticipated this, unable to guess Guifang's true intentions. Seeing that Left Venerable was unwilling to explain further, he refrained from pressing the matter.</p><p>Left Venerable handed Qin Sang a jade slip: "The Dao Court has reached a decision regarding your contributions. Presenting the demon pill will suffice to receive your reward."</p><p>Qin Sang had accomplished his task and earned his reward; what remained was merely a formality.  As Qin Sang examined the jade slip, Left Venerable paused and added: "Daoist Qingfeng, do you remember what I said before? Your abilities are best suited for battlefield combat. You would be an invaluable general!  If you are willing to serve the Dao Court, I am willing to personally recommend you."</p>
