<h1>Chapter 1555: Instantaneous Movement</h1><p>Chapter 1555: Instantaneous Movement</p><p>The commotion behind them grew louder, the battle incredibly fierce.</p><p>It seemed Ning Wuhuai truly had the strength to fight Ye Xiao.</p><p>Especially since Ye Xiao was already injured.</p><p>Qin Sang felt less worried.</p><p>Then, he noticed subtle changes in the stone forest—it became increasingly sinister and terrifying.  The chilling wind carried mournful howls, intensifying the ominous atmosphere.</p><p>Rustling sounds came from afar, unlike the wind.</p><p>"The beasts have been alerted…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He dared not linger, quickly moving through the stone forest towards the dark valley.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang encountered two groups of beasts. Fortunately, they weren't top-tier creatures. He swiftly killed them with his sword, and after some twists and turns, he finally escaped the stone forest.</p><p>"I wonder how Ning Wuhuai is doing."</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at their meeting point, but Ning Wuhuai was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Thanks to his Heavenly Eye ability, he consistently spotted enemies in time, so Qin Sang wasn't injured, only consuming some spiritual energy, easily recovered with a short rest.</p><p>He couldn't do anything but wait patiently.</p><p>Across the stone forest lay a boundless desert, equally barren and desolate.</p><p>He flew to the top of a stone tree, gazing into the distance. He vaguely saw a range of mountains to the left, with countless rays of light emanating from deep within the mountains.</p><p>Among the light, he clearly saw numerous space fissures, crisscrossing and overlapping. The void there seemed to be torn apart, a terrifying sight.</p><p>Compared to these space fissures, the flickering lights of the ancient restriction paled in significance.</p><p>No wonder human cultivators haven't uncovered the true secrets of the Seven Killing Hall. In such a place, even Nascent Soul cultivators would struggle to move, and it was even more dangerous within.</p><p>Fortunately, the space deep within the desert seemed much more stable, the space fissures less dense.</p><p>As Qin Sang was looking around, observing the terrain, he suddenly sensed a rapid approaching energy fluctuation. Focusing his gaze, he saw Ning Wuhuai, and his face lit up with joy.</p><p>"Daoist Ning, are you injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, examining Ning Wuhuai. He only seemed to be depleted of spiritual energy, showing no external wounds.</p><p>"I'm fine. That Night Owl was injured, its power diminished, and the terrain of the stone forest was favorable for escape…"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai looked relaxed, sat cross-legged, and used spirit stones to recover his spiritual energy.</p><p>"Daoist friend, your current strength is comparable to a Nascent Soul master?"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before asking.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai shook his head. "Now that things have come to this, there's no need to hide it. My heterodox Nascent Soul is inferior to a true Nascent Soul, lacking corresponding divine abilities. If a powerful enemy targets me, I would be in great danger.  And apart from the primordial spirit within the Nascent Soul, I cannot benefit from it, my Golden Core cannot transform, everything originates from the heterodox Nascent Soul itself. My own cultivation is insufficient, controlling the heterodox Nascent Soul is extremely difficult; each activation requires the Nascent Soul to leave my body…"</p><p>Hearing Ning Wuhuai's explanation, Qin Sang understood, gradually grasping the situation.</p><p>A heterodox Nascent Soul, after all, wasn't his own; it was more like an external force, similar in some ways to the Corpse Pill he once cultivated.</p><p>It was said that true Nascent Souls possess the ability of instantaneous movement, a vital life-saving divine ability. From Ning Wuhuai's tone, it seemed the heterodox Nascent Soul lacked this.</p><p>However, possessing the combat power of a Nascent Soul alone was enough to drive countless Foundation Establishment cultivators mad.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's interest, Ning Wuhuai smiled slightly. "This secret technique was passed down to me by a senior.  Its cultivation was purely fortuitous. It not only requires a mature Earth Blood Ginseng but also other stringent conditions. In the current world, it's almost impossible to replicate…"</p><p>"Earth Blood Ginseng?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He wasn't skilled in alchemy and only had superficial knowledge of herbs. He couldn't recall ever hearing of Earth Blood Ginseng.</p><p>The heterodox Nascent Soul secret technique came from Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu entrusted Ning Wuhuai with a heavy responsibility, clearly indicating a deep relationship.  With Senior Qingzhu's cultivation, obtaining one or two top-tier secret techniques wasn't unusual.</p><p>It seems Senior Qingzhu's plan is far-reaching, requiring Ning Wuhuai to possess sufficient cultivation.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivation can't be achieved overnight.</p><p>The heterodox Nascent Soul allowed Ning Wuhuai's strength to skyrocket instantly.</p><p>"Earth Blood Ginseng is extinct in the current world. I found traces of it in the Heavenly Dao Sect, confirming there was one in the trial realm. This herb resembles an infant. Once mature, it can move freely, its escape technique surpassing even Nascent Soul cultivators; it's elusive and possesses powerful protective spiritual energy. Even in the trial realm, I made thorough preparations, using every means to barely capture it, nearly suffering severe injuries in the process."</p><p>Ning Wuhu sighed, "Refining it into an Outer Dao Nascent Soul is no easy feat. This secret technique was originally intended for Nascent Soul masters; I alone cannot accomplish it.  It requires a spirit array and various rare treasures…"</p><p>A shady spot under a big tree is a welcome respite!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel envious.  Those harsh conditions must have been arranged beforehand by Elder Qingzhu for Ning Wuhu.  He, on the other hand, lacked a trustworthy guide and had to forge his own path.</p><p>"I cannot privately pass on this secret technique, please understand,"</p><p>Ning Wuhu said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in understanding.</p><p>If he truly wanted it, he would have to wait until he met Elder Qingzhu and find a way to obtain it.</p><p>However, after hearing Ning Wuhu's description, Qin Sang's interest in the secret technique waned considerably.  The conditions were so harsh; it would be impossible to refine it at the Core Formation stage.  Even if he successfully broke through to the Nascent Soul realm, expending so much effort on preparations, it would still be difficult to obtain the Earth Blood Ginseng.</p><p>In comparison, it would be better to fully assist Bai in advancing to Corpse King.  That would also be a Nascent Soul-level aid, offering a much greater chance of success. At least until the Heavenly Corpse Talisman was solved, Bai would remain by his side.</p><p>Ning Wuhu sat cross-legged, eyes closed, while Qin Sang stood guard nearby.</p><p>Once his True Essence recovered to 90%, Ning Wuhu stood up and looked towards the depths of the desert, "I didn't expect to encounter so many setbacks. We need to pick up the pace."</p><p>The two set off again.</p><p>The desert terrain was undulating, but it wasn't composed of towering mountains; only low hills.  There were no places to hide, so they had to be extra cautious.</p><p>The further they went, the colder it became.</p><p>Soon, they discovered a faint grey mist floating in the void ahead.  The mist wasn't dense and didn't severely obstruct their vision. The terrain remained a vast desert, not much different from the outside.</p><p>The two stopped and stared ahead.</p><p>The grey mist stretched endlessly, forming a sea of mist with no visible boundaries. It appeared far more extensive than the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>"That's the Silent Valley ahead,"</p><p>Ning Wuhu said solemnly.</p><p>"I didn't expect it to be so vast!"</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, "This hardly looks like a valley!"</p><p>"The 'valley' in Silent Valley isn't relative to mountains, but to the void itself,"</p><p>Ning Wuhu pointed to the left horizon.  "Look there; it's practically a dead end. On the other side of the Silent Valley, the scene is similar—like two cliffs, enclosing the valley in between."</p>
