<h1>Chapter 1021: An Encounter</h1><p>“It's a pity there's only one set of the spirit array.”</p><p>Su Nü looked down at the jade bracelet fragments, her face etched with regret.</p><p>Her strength was somewhat inferior to the young man's. She was able to kill him only by taking him by surprise and utilizing the forbidden magical tool.</p><p>Recalling the young man's last words,</p><p>Su Nü's eyes flickered, wondering if she had truly overthought things and misunderstood something.</p><p>But when she remembered her tragic past, those young girls with lives as vibrant as flowers who died under the influence of dark magic, and Yue Xianggu's hideous face, she couldn't help but shudder.</p><p>That experience was a nightmare she could never escape.</p><p>If not for these memories, she would undoubtedly have believed in the Eastern Alliance Leader's regard for her and treated those people as true friends and family.</p><p>Su Nü sighed, waved her hand to erase all traces, and rummaged through the young man's storage pouch.  She took what was usable and destroyed the rest.</p><p>She glanced around, about to use her movement technique to escape.</p><p>A rumbling sound suddenly emanated from beneath the ice, rapidly approaching her.</p><p>Initially, Su Nü didn't pay much attention, assuming it was ordinary beasts drawn by the commotion.</p><p>She had slain two Ice Lizards here, then battled fiercely with her senior brother, and finally detonated the forbidden magical tool, creating quite a disturbance.</p><p>But in the next moment, Su Nü's expression drastically changed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ice in the distance suddenly exploded.</p><p>An Ice Jiao burst out of the ice surface, its body crystalline and translucent, its blood and bones visible to the naked eye. The Ice Jiao soared into the air, looking down at Su Nü, its eyes filled with intense madness and killing intent, a ferocious and menacing sight.</p><p>“Comparable to late Core Formation…”</p><p>Sensing the Ice Jiao's aura, Su Nü's heart tightened.</p><p>To gain the young man's trust and lure him into the trap, she had deliberately injured herself as a disguise and then fought a fierce battle with him, greatly diminishing her strength compared to her peak condition.</p><p>Suddenly encountering such a powerful beast, she truly felt apprehensive.</p><p>Just as this thought flashed through her mind, an even more alarming scene unfolded.</p><p>The surrounding ice began to creak and crack; in an instant, fissures spread across the entire ice surface.</p><p>Beneath the ice, white shadows swam, converging on her at an astonishing speed. They were Ice Jiaos of varying sizes.</p><p>She hadn't alerted just one beast, but an entire Jiao swarm!</p><p>Within the Trial Realm, there existed not only powerful beasts comparable to late Core Formation cultivators but also apex predators.  It was a matter of ill luck to encounter one, but alarming so many beasts at once was exceptionally rare.</p><p>It was all because she had stayed in one place for too long.</p><p>Su Nü felt incredibly bitter. She had truly overthought things.  Perhaps she wouldn't even live to see the Merchant Alliance's schemes unfold, but would perish here instead.</p><p>“Demon Wings!”</p><p>Su Nü's lips moved slightly as she quickly formed hand seals. Demonic Qi surged out of her body, coalescing behind her back and finally forming a pair of black wings.</p><p>The demonic wings were quite peculiar, resembling skeletal wings without skin or feathers.</p><p>Demonic Qi formed black bones, pieced together into an ugly skeletal wing.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With a flap of her demonic wings, Su Nü charged towards the weakest point of the Ice Jiao swarm, the opposite direction of the Ice Jiao King in the air.</p><p>The Ice Jiao King roared, its voice piercing. It sprang forward, swiftly pouncing towards her.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>The ice shattered repeatedly, and white shadows rushed out, vying to reach Su Nü.</p><p>“Demonic Yuan Slash!”</p><p>Su Nü gritted her teeth, changing her hand seals. Demonic Qi gathered in her palm, instantly transforming into a massive black demonic blade nearly two zhang long.</p><p>Knowing that if she couldn't escape in time, her chances of survival would be slim, Su Nü used her full strength.</p><p>Compared to the enormous demonic blade, Su Nü's body appeared slender and small.  She soared into the air, wielding the blade with both hands, and slashed down towards the Ice Jiao swarm!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The shadow of the demonic blade was like a black ray of light, exceptionally conspicuous against the pristine white ice field.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The two medium-sized Ice Jiaos at the forefront were cleaved in two almost without resistance.</p><p>But alarmingly, the other Ice Jiaos were not deterred but were instead further enraged by the scent of blood.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>The shattered corpses crashed onto the ice surface.</p><p>Su Nü used the demonic blade to carve a path, charging forward. The Ice Jiao King behind her drew closer and closer, making her hair stand on end.  More Ice Jiaos were converging on her from beneath the ice.</p><p>Finally, after the demonic blade slew another Ice Jiao, the path ahead cleared.</p><p>“I'm out!”</p><p>Su Nü's heart leaped with joy.  With a flap of her demonic wings, her figure flashed out of the encirclement.  She then unhesitatingly withdrew the demonic blade, transforming into a black streak of light as she fled.</p><p>The Ice Jiao King roared in fury, its figure like lightning, relentlessly pursuing Su Nü.</p><p>Beneath the ice, white shadows darted in and out.</p><p>After flying for a while, Su Nü glanced back and discovered that the Ice Jiao King was pursuing her with a vengeance.</p><p>What worried her most was that this commotion had grown even larger, alerting other beasts. If a few more powerful demons like the Ice Jiao King were attracted, her situation would become perilous.</p><p>Thinking of this, Su Nü retrieved a spirit talisman from her storage pouch, one of the life-saving measures the Merchant Alliance had given her before her departure.</p><p>Activating the spirit talisman, Su Nü's body was enveloped in green Qi, her escape speed increasing significantly.</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere in the Glacial Ice Field.</p><p>Qin Sang, unfazed by the cold, casually slew a beast and then continued on his way as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Of course, he wasn't entirely reckless.</p><p>Within the Glacial Ice Field, there were beings that posed a threat to him.</p><p>As far as he knew, there might even be apex demonic beasts comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators within the Trial Realm. No one could be certain whether they resided within the Glacial Ice Field.</p><p>Those who were too arrogant would not meet a good end.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang seemed to sense something. He suddenly halted his flight and looked towards the rear right.</p><p>He then frowned slightly, glanced around, and flew to a distant location before vanishing from sight, seemingly having become invisible.</p><p>A short while later, a monstrous roar mixed with piercing sounds of something tearing through the air came from the direction Qin Sang was watching.</p><p>Moments later, a black streak of light appeared in Qin Sang's field of vision.</p><p>Clearly, a cultivator was being pursued by a beast!</p><p>“The Glacial Ice Field truly has powerful beasts lurking within!”</p><p>Qin Sang hid in the shadows, thinking to himself. His gaze swept over the cultivator, intending to see what kind of beast was chasing her, but his eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>“How is it her?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised to find that the person being chased was Su Nü!</p><p>Su Nü had become a confidante of the Eastern Alliance Leader, her cultivation soaring to late Core Formation in a short period.  This wasn't something achievable solely through talent.  The Eastern Alliance must have provided resources and heavily cultivated her.</p><p>With the Merchant Alliance's support, Su Nü should have been able to pass the first three trials without much difficulty. But to Qin Sang's surprise, Su Nü was injured for some reason, being pursued by a beast yet not daring to retaliate, appearing quite distressed.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>At this moment, Bai's voice suddenly came from the Corpse Puppet Pouch, “This girl… her cultivation technique is rather peculiar. The wings on her back… give me a… familiar feeling!”</p>
