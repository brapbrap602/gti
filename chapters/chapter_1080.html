<h1>Chapter 1722: Divided Attention</h1><p>Chapter 1722: Divided Attention</p><p>The Demon Lord was delighted. He immediately tossed a token to Madam Li.  "Madam Li, this is the Demon Island token. Take a few people with you to repair the altar. The faster, the better."</p><p>"Here are the altar's layout and repair methods. The three main altars are the most important.  With this talisman, you can enter the trial realm; there's also a main altar inside."</p><p>Lady Nan Gui handed the jade slip and talisman to Madam Li, informing her of the locations of the three main altars.</p><p>With Lady Nan Gui's guidance, it wouldn't be as troublesome and dangerous as it was for the three alliance leaders.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi didn't say much.</p><p>Madam Li nodded, suppressed her injuries, gathered her belongings, and flew down the mountain.</p><p>Lady Nan Gui, the Demon Lord, and Ling Zhuzi's gazes shifted to Gu Mo.</p><p>Facing the three masters, Gu Mo ignored them. Instead, he looked towards the area outside the mountain pass, as if he had sensed something unusual, his eyes strange.</p><p>Then, a trace of anger appeared on Gu Mo's face. He gritted his teeth, "I never thought that I, too, would one day be betrayed by my demonic servants and become bait!"</p><p>The three were startled.</p><p>At that moment, the mountain rocks suddenly shook violently.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Around the mountain pass, sections of the stone walls peeled off, huge rocks tumbling down, deafeningly loud.</p><p>The earth quaked.</p><p>Countless petrified spirit trees shattered and fell to the ground, rocks flying everywhere.</p><p>Those ancient palaces, already extremely decayed and precarious, were immediately affected by the tremors, collapsing in swathes, raising clouds of dust.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A sudden thunderbolt in broad daylight!</p><p>A fissure suddenly split open on Yitian Peak.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The fissure rapidly spread from afar, crossing the hillside, piercing the entire mountain wall, growing larger and larger.  Rocks crashed into the abyss below, the interior pitch black.</p><p>Looking down from above, the mountain pass was right at the center of the fissure, completely torn open.</p><p>Everyone was startled, quickly flying up to avoid the falling rocks.</p><p>However, they hadn't forgotten Gu Mo, keeping him surrounded to prevent him from escaping in the chaos.</p><p>Gu Mo had no intention of leaving. He stood motionless on the ground, enveloped in demonic energy, the falling rocks shattered by the energy.</p><p>He was unharmed, staring intently at the fissure, his expression shifting.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Lady Nan Gui frowned, gazing into the depths of the fissure.</p><p>A dark expanse was visible deep within the fissure, with a faint, black curtain emerging.</p><p>Inside the curtain, countless runes flickered alternately, ancient forbidden power covering the ground, finally forming an airtight curtain.</p><p>However, there was a crack in the curtain.</p><p>The crack was as thin as a hair, barely visible to the naked eye, but it signified a breach in the ancient prohibition!</p><p>Underneath the stele in the mountain pass, there was another altar.</p><p>At this moment, the altar was situated above the crack in the curtain.</p><p>Seeing this, Lady Nan Gui exclaimed, "A rift in the ancient prohibition!"</p><p>The old man's gaze swept towards the origin of the spreading fissure, discovering it was coming from the direction of the cliff face. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>The young man and woman were still in the main hall.</p><p>The change originated from there. The two inheritors were in unknown peril.</p><p>The old man quickly sent a voice transmission to Lady Nan Gui, disregarding his own injuries. He grabbed the Demon Suppressing Stele, his figure flashing as he darted towards the cliff.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A large black net suddenly flew out from the depths of the fissure, as fast as lightning, heading towards the old man.</p><p>Having already suffered a sneak attack, the old man naturally wouldn't be unprepared. He immediately noticed the anomaly, roared, and unleashed a beam of rainbow light, striking the black net.</p><p>The old man was furious; this was the second time he’d been ambushed.</p><p>These people were all targeting him.</p><p>Almost all of the most powerful factions in the human race had arrived, but who was this person?</p><p>Although the old man was on guard, his old wounds hadn't healed, and the attacker's strength was clearly no weaker than his own. The rainbow light didn't break through the net; instead, it was swallowed up.</p><p>The old man was forced back.</p><p>"Where are you going, friend?"</p><p>A figure flashed out of the fissure, retracting the black light and smiling at the old man. "I've put a lot of effort into luring you into moving the Demon Suppressing Stele."</p><p>This person revealed his form—it was Qing Zhu!</p><p>However, his eyes held unconcealed madness and bloodlust. It was clearly a body controlled by a demonic soul, not the real Qing Zhu.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Seeing the demonic Qing Zhu, all four present were surprised.</p><p>They had originally thought that other factions were involved, but it turned out to be a stranger.</p><p>The Demon Lord, the Heavenly Dao Sect Master, and the Four Saints Palace inheritors represented the pinnacle of human power, yet none of them had ever seen this person.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Gu Mo's face contorted, his eyes blazing with rage at Mo Qingzhu. "I freed you, I taught you my techniques, and you dare betray me!"</p><p>"Not at all..."</p><p>Mo Qingzhu shook his head repeatedly. "My actions have always been in accordance with the Demon Lord's orders.  It's just... not *your* orders, as a fragment."</p><p>A slight smirk played on his lips. "Even if I pledged allegiance, it would be to the true Demon Lord.  A mere fragment thinks it can command me?"</p><p>Gu Mo was startled. "Him! When did he sway you?"</p><p>Mo Qingzhu scoffed. "Before I met you, I already swore an oath to him. The main body sacrificed its essence to release you.  Trapped for years, you developed ulterior motives, a divided heart. Instead of breaking the altar and the ancient seals, you aimed to usurp power and establish your own dominion!"</p><p>Gu Mo's expression shifted, his tone dismissive. "He is me, I am him. We share the same source. Who serves whom, what difference does it make!"</p><p>He glanced at the figures in the air, suddenly understanding, and he exploded with frustration. "You brought these people here!"</p><p>Gu Mo was furious.  His plan had been to lure the three Grand Masters to break the seal, then have Mo Qingzhu ambush the descendants of the Four Saints, seizing the Demon Suppressing Stele.  He would then be free to conquer the land. Once his power was restored, he would release his true form and devour his original self, becoming the true Demon Lord.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu had ruined everything.  Sealed for years, his power was far less than before.  With his seals unbroken, he was now facing the combined might of three late-Yuan Ying cultivators; his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>"It was simply a matter of using the situation to my advantage. If it weren't for using you as bait to lure the Four Saints Palace into taking the Demon Suppressing Stele, allowing me to prepare, and requiring your assistance to break the seal, there was no need to release you."</p><p>Mo Qingzhu said calmly. "When I left the Seven Killing Hall and infiltrated the Canglang Sea, I discovered some clues, so I decided to turn the tables and bring you a few more opponents, lest you truly escape."</p><p>The four people in the air listened to the exchange between Mo Qingzhu and Gu Mo, their expressions varying.</p><p>The Demon Lord's eyes narrowed as he studied Mo Qingzhu, a thought suddenly striking him.  The man's face was unfamiliar, yet he felt a sense of familiarity; he seemed to have seen him before.</p><p>"Are you the Sword Demon?"</p><p>The Demon Lord finally remembered.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu turned his gaze, nodding slightly. "Daoist Yin held the Demon Lord in such high regard; it's truly well-deserved. Unfortunately, I encountered some unexpected circumstances back then and couldn't cultivate a deeper relationship with you, Daoist."</p>
