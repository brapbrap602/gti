<h1>Chapter 1878: Initial Exploration of the Storm</h1><p>Qin Sang left behind Qi's most accomplished disciple and two strong, registered disciples.  These two registered disciples of Master Qi were specifically chosen by Qin Sang to inherit the *Chongxuan Codex*. However, Qin Sang had no intention of re-establishing the Chongxuan Temple, nor did he want them to call him Master.  He planned for them to establish their own schools after mastering their skills.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence, activating the Fire Chamber Array. The power of the flames grew stronger, becoming incredibly intense.</p><p>Though the five disciples had witnessed Qin Sang refining artifacts before, those were merely practice runs.  They stood stiffly to the side, not daring to breathe too loudly, afraid of making a mistake.</p><p>"Don't be nervous," Qin Sang said calmly, glancing at them. "Your skills already surpass your master's.  As long as you don't slack off, remain calm, and follow my instructions, there will be no problems."</p><p>"We will remember your teachings and not be negligent," the five responded in unison, bowing respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang said no more. With a flick of his finger, streams of light shot out, revealing fragments of the Mingshan Armor and various spiritual materials. The most precious items were all obtained from the Dao Court.</p><p>He planned to re-refine the Mingshan Armor into inner armor, but not completely revert it to its raw form. Master Qi had laid a solid foundation, and many of his ideas were limited by his capabilities; Qin Sang now had the means to realize them.</p><p>Except for the most crucial ingredients, the refining process was largely handled by the five disciples. Qin Sang constantly held the Mingshan Armor, continuously inscribing it.</p><p>The five disciples knew this was a rare opportunity and worked diligently. Qin Sang offered occasional guidance, and they made no significant errors.</p><p>After completing the initial preparations, the five disciples were exhausted, but none wanted to leave.  Instead, they were excited because Qin Sang was about to start the furnace.</p><p>They had little involvement in the subsequent refining process, but Qin Sang provided explanations from time to time.  Every word and action proved invaluable to them.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>The flames gradually subsided. Qin Sang gazed at the red flames, reached out, and grasped a red light. The flames burned his palm.</p><p>The five disciples watched Qin Sang's hand with anticipation.</p><p>An object slowly emerged from the fire: a piece of inner armor, seemingly soft and light, easily held in one hand. It felt weightless, yet was neither silk nor cloth.  Residual flames flickered on its surface without causing any damage.</p><p>As the flames dissipated, Qin Sang felt a cool sensation in his palm.  He infused it with true essence, and it unfolded into a piece of armor thin as a cicada's wing.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his palm sword and stabbed at the armor.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A sound like the clash of gold resonated. The armor merely swayed slightly, completely unharmed, without a single scratch.</p><p>"Excellent! There's no need to change the name.  It will still be called the Mingshan Armor."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, nodding in satisfaction.  After a brief refinement, he activated the Mingshan Armor, wearing it under his robes. It felt weightless.</p><p>"Continue your cultivation diligently. I will test your progress when I have time."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang deactivated the Fire Chamber Array, and left.</p><p>The five disciples responded respectfully, escorting Qin Sang out of the manor before hurrying into seclusion.</p><p>Leaving Qi's Manor, Qin Sang traveled west alone, first visiting Venerable Zhenru as usual to discuss the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>Through years of study by Qin Sang and the monks of Jingtai Temple, their understanding of the Sun Wheel Seal had deepened.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed that once he grasped the principles of inner and outer scenes and began to comprehend the Dharma Image, his comprehension of the Sun Wheel Seal accelerated significantly.</p><p>After a brief stay at Jingtai Temple, Qin Sang continued westward, entering the Baishi Altar and meeting Master Yuan.</p><p>"Decided then? Oh? Your cultivation has broken through again. It seems you're quite confident this time," Master Yuan said with surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, "Whether I succeed or fail, I can't delay any longer.  If I miss the opportunity, I'll be guilty of a hundred deaths."</p><p>"The situation isn't that dire yet, but preparing early is good," Master Yuan said. He didn't offer any encouragement, but instead produced a jade slip. "This contains my insights from these years. Take it and study it. Before starting the furnace, you must make adjustments to the fire array for better compatibility with the artifact. The *Chongxuan Codex* also describes this. There are many restrictions within the altar; only I can perform this personally."</p><p>"Thank you for your consideration," Qin Sang said, accepting the jade slip and bowing before being led by a golden-armored guard to a golden hall for secluded cultivation.</p><p>This seclusion lasted nearly half a year.  Qin Sang effectively received guidance from both Master Gu and Master Yuan, boosting his confidence.</p><p>Inside the altar's fire chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beside the flames, Master Yuan sitting opposite, gazing at Qin Sang through the firelight. "Let's begin."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and tossed the war drum into the flames.  Master Yuan had already restored it to its damaged state.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang offered up various precious spiritual materials for refining.</p><p>With Master Yuan assisting with fire control, Qin Sang found the task much easier. He wasn’t arrogant enough to believe that inheriting the Chongxuan Temple's legacy and receiving Master Yuan's guidance would allow him to repair the innate spiritual treasure alone.</p><p>Without the insights of the two master refiners who had passed down their knowledge and provided clear direction, guiding him from the start, Qin Sang couldn't imagine how much longer the process would have taken.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully memorized every word from Master Gu and Master Yuan. His goal was growth through this experience, not self-reliance.</p><p>The spiritual flames danced in Qin Sang's hands, extracting the essence from the spiritual materials.  Master Yuan had prepared three sets to account for potential failures, but Qin Sang performed far better than expected.</p><p>Gradually, Master Yuan loosened his control over the flames, observing Qin Sang's continued ease and exceptional fire control skills and keen spiritual awareness.  He couldn't help but show his approval.</p><p>Once the spiritual materials were refined, Qin Sang focused his mind on the war drum, unburdened by distractions.</p><p>He then manipulated wisps of flame, striking the drumhead with varying degrees of force.</p><p>*Dong! Dong! Dong!*</p><p>The drumbeats resonated, contained within the fire chamber by the spirit array.</p><p>Soon, the war drum's surface glowed red, the light intensifying until it almost rivaled the spiritual flames.</p><p>Surprisingly, Qin Sang broke into a fine sweat, indicating the difficulty of this step.</p><p>As time passed, the war drum changed again.  Fine threads, intricate restrictive runes, appeared within the red glow—so complex that even an ordinary cultivator would suffer a headache from a single glance.</p><p>Qin Sang tirelessly watched the drumhead with unwavering focus.</p><p>A crucial step in refining, known as 'connecting the energy pathways,' is also vital in repairing artifacts. Qin Sang's current task was to activate and repair the war drum's remaining energy pathways.</p><p>The damaged drum had withered, chaotic energy pathways.  Despite guidance from two master refiners, Qin Sang still felt immense pressure.</p><p>Days and nights blurred in the fire chamber.</p><p>Lost in his work, Qin Sang meticulously performed each step.</p><p>The essence extracted from the spiritual materials floated around Qin Sang. After some time, he drew in a wisp of azure spiritual energy and guided it towards the drum's hole.</p><p>The azure energy hovered over the hole, swirling.  Qin Sang changed his hand seals, directing streams of light towards the opening.  The drumhead and azure energy vibrated in resonance, their energies gradually coalescing into a thin veil, perfectly sealing the hole.</p><p>Completing this step, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief, his face alight with excitement.</p><p>"Excellent! I prepared five strands of Source Silk Grass for you, yet you succeeded on the first try. You have considerable talent, though you lacked proper guidance before. Rest now," Master Yuan nodded repeatedly, helping to stabilize the war drum.</p><p>Though Qin Sang was no longer a young apprentice needing encouragement, he felt invigorated by the master's praise and immediately entered meditation to recover his energy.</p><p>As more refined spiritual material essence was fed into the flames, the hole in the drumhead gradually filled, nearly erasing the damage.</p><p>Minor mistakes occurred, but they were inconsequential.</p><p>However, the process was far from complete. The most difficult step – completely merging the materials and drum, and opening the energy pathways – remained.</p><p>"Haaah!"</p><p>Qin Sang meditated again, then exhaled slowly, his face serious. He plunged his hands into the flames.</p><p>The spiritual flames blazed brightly. Initially, the war drum showed no change, but then it seemed to melt, developing a glaze-like luster that spread over the repaired area, flowing across the entire drum.</p><p>The war drum’s original form was gone, replaced by a glowing crimson spiritual embryo.</p><p>"Seize this opportunity! Don't hesitate!"</p><p>Master Yuan urged.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately imprinted the prepared hand seal into the crimson spiritual embryo.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The crimson embryo emitted a wave that shook the spiritual flames, quickly suppressed by Master Yuan.</p><p>Qin Sang, no longer distracted, intently observed every change in the crimson spiritual embryo, his hands moving rapidly.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The crimson spiritual embryo contracted with each vibration, the glaze flowing faster, indicating internal fusion.</p><p>Finally, when the spiritual embryo shrunk to a certain extent, no matter what hand seals Qin Sang used, it wouldn't change in the slightest.  Sweat dripped from Qin Sang's forehead; it was extremely energy-consuming, and it wasn't going as smoothly as planned—he'd hit a snag.</p><p>*啪!*</p><p>Qin Sang clasped the crimson spiritual embryo tightly in both hands.  A rich blood energy surged forth.  He spared no effort, using a secret technique of the Chongxuan Sect, pouring the blood energy into the embryo.  Finally, the embryo twisted, vaguely taking the shape of a war drum.</p><p>Each subsequent step was incredibly difficult.</p><p>Towards the end, the repaired war drum was almost ready to be born, but Qin Sang found that no matter what he did, he was always one breath short.</p><p>Seeing his energy depleting rapidly, and unable to continue, Qin Sang finally shifted his gaze towards Yuan Zhenren.</p><p>The next moment, powerful true energy gushed from Yuan Zhenren's palm. The temperature in the fire chamber soared, the spiritual fire instantly reaching its peak, completely merging into the crimson spiritual embryo.</p><p>*轰!*</p><p>A wave of fire swept through the fire chamber.</p><p>In the center of the fire wave, a spirit drum appeared. The hole in the drumhead was gone, and the treasure light emanating from its body was even richer and more lustrous than after Master Gu's repair.</p><p>Qin Sang held and examined it, sensing it for a while before handing it to Yuan Zhenren.  Reflecting on the refining process, he felt some regret. Master Gu would have done a better job; and yet, Master Gu's cultivation was inferior. So, it wasn't a lack of cultivation, but rather a lack of understanding of the Dao of Refinement.</p><p>However, this experience brought Qin Sang many insights.  He couldn't wait to find a place to cultivate and comprehend them. Once he digested his gains, his refining skills would surely improve dramatically.</p><p>*咚!*</p><p>The sound of the drum startled Qin Sang from his thoughts.</p><p>Yuan Zhenren struck it a few times, murmuring, "The residual power is close to that of a spiritual treasure. I'll need to close myself off for a long time... Fellow Daoist, you're probably also eager to retreat; I won't keep you."</p><p>"Thank you, Yuan Zhenren, for your guidance."</p><p>Qin Sang rose, offered his thanks, and left the fire chamber.  He calculated that more than three months had passed.  His transaction with the Dao Court was complete; the war drum no longer belonged to him, though Yuan Zhenren hadn't refused his future requests for guidance.  From any perspective, Qin Sang felt he had profited greatly.</p><p>With Yuan Zhenren in seclusion, he didn't stay long in Baishi's Daoist precinct. He borrowed a quiet room from Master Gu.</p><p>...</p><p>A year later.</p><p>Qin Sang left seclusion and departed from Baishi, traveling north alone.  His journey was uneventful until he returned to the Jushan Daoist precinct.</p><p>Passing through auspicious clouds, entering the Golden Hall, Qin Sang sent a signal.  Shortly after, a streak of light rushed towards him – it was Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"Discussions on the art of refining with Master Gu delayed me somewhat," Qin Sang apologized.</p><p>"No problem! Upon receiving your message, I came here. I went to investigate myself, but before I got close to the storm illusion you mentioned, I found it too difficult and dared not continue," Mo Xingdao sighed.  "Indeed, it's completely different inside!"</p><p>As they spoke, the two passed through the Nine-Bend Star River, traveling through the illusion, arriving at the edge of the storm.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stood before the storm, silent for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "We'll only know what the inside of the storm looks like once we enter!"</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang summoned his altar, opened the eight gates, and called forth Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou's supernatural powers were indeed extraordinary; in just a few decades, he had restored his physical body, and his strength had recovered to eighty percent.</p><p>Upon learning that they were to enter the storm illusion, Gui Hou's heart sank, but he dared not disobey Qin Sang's orders.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out some protective talismans. The three of them used their respective abilities, forming a Three Talents Formation, tentatively flying towards the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, deploying all his defensive supernatural powers – the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, the Separating and Combining Divine Light, the Ming Shan Armor – his Yunyou Sword hanging above his head, its sword light enveloping the three of them.</p><p>The moment they entered the storm, chaotic energies assaulted them. The wind was like knives.  Qin Sang's body shuddered, but he firmly planted his feet in the void, forcibly stabilizing his form. The Yunyou Sword's light flared, shielding the three.</p><p>With Qin Sang bearing the brunt, Gui Hou and Mo Xingdao felt much less pressure, focusing on maintaining the formation and assisting Qin Sang, slowly flying towards the storm's center.</p><p>Their speed was slow, proceeding cautiously, ensuring safety before continuing.</p><p>The situation was better than expected. They could still find the original boundaries of the illusion at the outer edge of the storm, suggesting that restoration was possible.</p><p>However, as the three went deeper, the sights became increasingly horrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the route he remembered, but eventually, even the traces of the illusion disappeared. It was almost complete chaos, a devouring storm, increasingly dangerous.</p><p>In the end, still quite a distance from the Crimson Gold Spirit Needle, Gui Hou and Mo Xingdao felt exhausted and had to retreat.</p><p>Gui Hou, the weakest of the three, gasped for breath, his heart still pounding.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression was somber; he remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang knew what he was thinking, so he offered some comfort, saying that the Dao Court possessed refining techniques similar to puppetry; even if they couldn't find the path to ascension, they could try to help him obtain it.</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang thought of the Taiyi Star Chariot.</p><p>It seemed that to enter the storm, even with sufficient manpower, a powerful protective treasure was needed. According to Bao Gu's message, the Taiyi Star Chariot combined escape and protection abilities. It was time to repair it. </p>
