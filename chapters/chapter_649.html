Chapter 641: The End of the Divine Rune Path


“How many resources can a mere Qi Refinement disciple consume? We can cultivate her in secret. There were so many saintesses in the Winged Serpent Village, but Old Ghost Qin specifically chose the mute girl. Perhaps she will become a link between us and him.”
Emerald Profound Master waved his hand, dismissing Junior Brother Tong.
The secret chamber was silent. Emerald Profound Master summoned his natal insect, a scorpion as big as his palm.
The scorpion was snow-white, its skin smooth and jade-like, but the stinger on its tail was almost illusory.
This was the Phantom Tail Scorpion, one of the Five Insects that the Five Insects Sect specialized in cultivating.
Emerald Profound Master gently stroked the Phantom Tail Scorpion.  A moment later, a smaller Phantom Tail Scorpion crawled out from the larger one’s abdomen and nuzzled against his finger affectionately.
This one's aura was much weaker, only at the peak of the first transformation.
Looking at the two scorpions, Emerald Profound Master sighed softly.
Both of these scorpions were his natal insects.
Back then, when Emerald Profound Master used the blood refinement method to refine his natal insect, he discovered that the egg contained two larvae, twins.
There are two methods for blood refining insects.
One is to refine an adult insect. After the blood refinement, no matter how high its previous realm, it will regress to a larval state.
This method has a low success rate, as adult insects will resist fiercely, and the stronger they are, the more intense their resistance. Cultivators can only rely on their own strength to suppress the spirit insect. If the insect’s strength exceeds the cultivator’s, it is impossible to succeed.
However, there is one advantage: after being refined into a natal insect, it's easier for the insect to transform again.
The second method is to directly choose a larva. This is the choice of the vast majority.
If a larva is chosen for blood refinement, the occurrence of twins or multiple births is not uncommon.  The strongest one must be selected, and the rest abandoned, as one can only have one natal insect.
But for some reason, Emerald Profound Master had muddled through and refined both Phantom Tail Scorpions into natal insects, possessing twin insects.
This had made him ecstatic. His talent wasn't exceptional, so having two natal insects, despite the increased difficulty in cultivating them, was equivalent to doubling his combat power.
He knew his situation was unique and couldn't be revealed, so he never displayed it in front of others. Only his master knew.
During the Qi Refinement stage, relying on his two natal insects, Emerald Profound Master possessed exceptional combat power and made numerous contributions, earning him focused cultivation from the sect, and he quickly reached Foundation Establishment.
Unexpectedly, after reaching Foundation Establishment, when he tried to improve his natal insects, he found that while one transformed smoothly, the other's growth stagnated, unable to begin its second transformation.
Emerald Profound Master never gave up, piling countless resources onto it, but to no avail.
Finally, he had to admit that this Phantom Tail Scorpion had completely lost its potential for transformation. Perhaps this was the price of twin natal insects.
Now, the second insect was like a chicken rib, increasingly useless, yet he was reluctant to discard it.
…
Amidst a thousand mountains and valleys, a land rife with miasma and devoid of human presence, a figure effortlessly traversed the poisonous fog and jungle, more agile than a bird.
"This is it."
Qin Sang landed on a rock and looked up at the mountain before him.
Atop the mountain, clouds formed a ring-shaped barrier, sealing the summit, perpetually unchanging.
It was said that there was an ancient temple on the mountain, where some had received inheritances.
It had been nearly two months since Qin Sang left the Bear Mountain region, and over half a year since he had first awakened while drifting on the water.
Over these two months, Qin Sang had explored the surrounding dangerous lands and secret realms.
Except for one exceptionally perilous area, which he dared not venture too deep into yet, he had investigated every rumor collected by the Five Insects Sect, regardless of their veracity.
This mountain was the last one.
He still hadn't found any trace of the ancient teleportation formation.
Although he hadn't reached the core of that dangerous area, Qin Sang could tell that the possibility of a teleportation formation existing there was extremely slim.
His journey hadn't been fruitless. He had harvested several spirit herbs usable by Foundation Establishment cultivators, so it wasn't a wasted trip.
"This is the last place. If it's not here, I'll put it aside for now and go to the heartland of the Western Frontier to search for insects."
Qin Sang muttered to himself, making a decision. "I wonder how the Five Insects Sect is doing with their task? Once I've chosen my natal insect, I'll return to the Bear Mountain region, then leave the Western Frontier. Cultivating while searching for news of Senior Qing Zhu wouldn't be a bad idea. Senior Qing Zhu is so talented, even more so than Hao Yue, there must be some trace of him somewhere."
Qin Sang pushed off the ground, soaring like an eagle towards the mountaintop.
"This seems to be a unique kind of restriction used by the Wu Clan. If only I knew the Wu Clan's Divine Runes, deciphering these cloud barriers would be much easier."
Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, staring at the cloud ring, pondering how to break it.
He now had a good understanding of the Wu Clan and had finally unravelled the mystery of the Divine Runes.
The power of the Wu Clan’s Divine Runes was only slightly stronger than peak Qi Refinement spells, useful only during the Qi Refinement and early Foundation Establishment stages.  Beyond that, they were useless.
Completely useless!
Throughout the Wu Clan, countless brilliant individuals had dedicated their lives to studying Divine Runes, attempting to find a path forward and rebuild the Wu Clan's Divine Rune Dao, even including Nascent Soul ancestors, but all had failed.
Wu Clan cultivators beyond the Foundation Establishment stage could only abandon Divine Runes.
Even sect disciples, confident in their future prospects, didn't cultivate Divine Runes during the Qi Refinement stage to avoid wasting time.
Qin Sang had previously felt that Divine Runes, as the Wu Clan's unique power, highly compatible with their bloodline, might be even more orthodox than natal insects.
Now it seemed that many Wu Clan sages had shared similar thoughts.
Unfortunately, the path was broken.
Summoning the Flying Night Devil for protection, Qin Sang took out the Ten Yama Banners.  Three banners formed a formation, and the Nine Nether Devil Fire gathered into a fireball, which he then shot towards the cloud ring.
'Boom!'
The black flames plunged into the cloud ring, like a drop of ink on white paper, quickly spreading.
The cloud ring trembled, and where the Nine Nether Devil Fire struck, the clouds rapidly dissipated, becoming extremely thin.
The Flying Night Devil and Qin Sang, one after the other, broke through the clouds and clearly saw the ancient temple on the summit, bathed in sunlight, shining with golden light.
An hour later, Qin Sang shook his head and left the temple.
This place had been visited by countless people, its treasures long since plundered. It was completely empty.
Empty-handed once again, Qin Sang officially entered the heartland of the Western Frontier, embarking on his insect hunt.
…
One month later.
In a vast wasteland, the wild grass grew as tall as a person.
Holding a geomantic map, Qin Sang had been searching the wasteland for several days, looking for the entrance to a cavern.
The geomantic map only roughly marked the locations of spirit insect nests. Often, someone had seen such insects nearby and marked an approximate area without actually seeing the nest.
Coupled with the passage of time and changes in terrain,
finding the exact location required considerable effort.
