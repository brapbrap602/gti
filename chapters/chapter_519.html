<h1>Chapter 512: Finally, News Arrives</h1><p>During this period, Qin Sang sold several corpse refiners.  He repeatedly requested payment in specific spiritual herbs.  Anyone perceptive would guess the owner of these refiners might be suffering from backlash, hence the urgency to trade, even at a steep price.</p><p>It's not uncommon for corpse-refining cultivators to suffer backlash from their creations.  It's perfectly plausible.</p><p>Because of this, no one suspected Qin Sang's true intentions.</p><p>A Firethorn herb certainly isn't worth a Refined Corpse made from a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, but in the cultivation world, trades are rarely about equal value.  It's all about what each party needs.</p><p>Wen Yanjie clearly intended to capitalize on Qin Sang's predicament.  Holding the Firethorn herb aloft, he looked at Qin Sang with a confident smile.</p><p>Qin Sang was already determined to sell. Even without the Firethorn, Wen Yanjie was a very suitable target.</p><p>He dropped his feigned anger, stood still, fists clenched, head slightly bowed.  He appeared conflicted, torn between his need and his attachment to his creations.</p><p>Seeing this, Wen Yanjie smiled and offered some kind words, "Fellow Daoist, to refine so many corpses, you are clearly no ordinary cultivator.  A Refined Corpse is merely a tool.  Your own path and a mere corpse, which is more important? You must know the answer.  As the saying goes, 'Wealth lost can be regained.'  Once you resolve the backlash, what kind of Refined Corpse can't you create?  This Firethorn herb is not easy to obtain, especially given your current situation..."</p><p>"Hmph! Easy to say.  Do you think refining a corpse is so simple? Do you know how much effort I've put into this? If it weren't for a moment of carelessness, I..."</p><p>Qin Sang gritted his teeth, glanced at Wen Yanjie, and summoned the Refined Corpse made from Luo Xiao's body.  He said coldly, "You're lucky you caught me at a vulnerable moment!  Give me the Firethorn, and this Refined Corpse is yours!"</p><p>Wen Yanjie examined the Refined Corpse, carefully sensing it with his divine sense.  Confirming it was indeed stronger than the previous one, his eyes lit up.</p><p>His skill in corpse refinement was far inferior to Manager Bao's; he couldn't easily see the flaw in the corpse's dantian.</p><p>Of course, unless facing a highly experienced veteran, this flaw was practically inconsequential.</p><p>Even with his cultivation level, Wen Yanjie had to admit this Refined Corpse would be an excellent asset in battle.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang reached for the Firethorn, Wen Yanjie suddenly withdrew his hand.  His tone playful, he said, "Fellow Daoist, have you misunderstood something? I offered to trade for your Refined Corpse, but I didn't say just this one.  The one you showed earlier was also quite good.  I'll generously take that one as well..."</p><p>"Wen, you're trying to take advantage of me!"</p><p>Qin Sang flew into a rage.</p><p>He had underestimated Wen Yanjie's greed.  Trading a Firethorn herb for a Refined Corpse was already a bargain, yet he still wasn't satisfied!</p><p>If he agreed to this unreasonable demand, Wen Yanjie would surely push further.  If things spiraled out of control and affected his plan, it would be disastrous.</p><p>"I'd rather die from the poison than let you have your way!"</p><p>Qin Sang would rather not sell at all.  He immediately withdrew the Refined Corpse and stormed towards the door, furious.</p><p>Judging by his posture, if Wen Yanjie dared to stop him, it would be a fight to the death.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's genuine anger, Wen Yanjie's expression changed slightly.  His eyes flickered, and suddenly his face was wreathed in smiles, his tone softening, "I was just joking, Fellow Daoist.  Why so angry...?  As you say, the Firethorn for that Refined Corpse."</p><p>To demonstrate his sincerity, Wen Yanjie tossed the Firethorn herb to Qin Sang first.</p><p>"I don't think you were joking..."</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, his tone stiff. He took the Firethorn, examined it carefully for a long time, then summoned the Refined Corpse again.  After erasing his soul mark and instructing Wen Yanjie on how to control it, he left without looking back.</p><p>[Reader Benefits] Read and get cash or coins!

He wore a satisfied smile.</p><p>Suddenly, hurried footsteps approached, and the door burst open.  Three people entered.</p><p>"Senior Brother Wen, that guy disappeared."</p><p>The three stopped before Wen Yanjie, speaking urgently.</p><p>Wen Yanjie frowned slightly. "Where did you lose him?"</p><p>One of them said shamefully, "We lost him in the city.  The men guarding the exits haven't seen anyone suspicious either."</p><p>Wen Yanjie glared at him. "You lost him in our own city? Useless!"</p><p>The three looked embarrassed. The one on the left muttered in defense, "The three of us split up, very cautiously.  We couldn't have been exposed. He seemed to know the city better than we did.  He twisted and turned, then suddenly vanished.  I suspect someone helped him.  Those big trading companies are all scheming.  Without orders from the elders, we can't search them..."</p><p>After listening carefully, Wen Yanjie snorted, "It seems he was very cautious, having planned his escape route beforehand.  What a pity.  I had already ascertained he likely only has one Refined Corpse of that level. He's also suffering from the backlash, his body weakened by the corpse poison... Forget it, initiate the plan.  Leave him alive."</p><p>...</p><p>In an unnoticed corner of Azure Sun City.</p><p>Qin Sang reappeared, watching coldly as those who had been following him withdrew.</p><p>Having seen through Wen Yanjie's nature, he had been wary after leaving Treasure Pavilion and indeed noticed he was being followed.</p><p>Their methods were sophisticated; if he hadn't been careful, he would have missed them.</p><p>Qin Sang was no saint. At any other time, if Wen Yanjie had dared to target him, he would have taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget.</p><p>But now, the greater plan took precedence.  Qin Sang decided to endure.</p><p>...</p><p>Finding another opportunity, he sold the mid Foundation Establishment Refined Corpse to another Azure Sun Demonic Sect cultivator.  Qin Sang's initial goals were achieved.  Now he just had to wait and see.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang worked diligently as a tool refiner in that shop.</p><p>He didn't display any exceptional refining skills.  He mostly interacted with low-level Qi Refining cultivators.  It was from these people that information was easiest to glean, and he wouldn't attract attention.</p><p>He kept an eye on those who had bought his Refined Corpses.</p><p>Ten days passed quickly.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang intentionally befriended Azure Sun Demonic Sect disciples and finally learned two things.</p><p>First, both Wen Yanjie and the other disciples who purchased the Refined Corpses had been acting normally, entering and leaving the sect with their corpses.</p><p>The Azure Sun Demonic Sect seemed unconcerned about its disciples controlling Refined Corpses; their elders hadn't intervened.</p><p>Second, just a few days ago, they had all received warnings from their elders to avoid venturing too far from the sect!</p>
