<h1>Chapter 1231: Unsealing</h1><p>The ancient forbidden cloud mass had been dyed into a blood cloud, with blood energy permeating everywhere. Qin Sang suspected that the blood miasma at the edge of the Boundless Valley was formed under the influence of this blood energy. Through the ancient restrictions, the boundary of the blood lake could be faintly seen. It was less than half the size of the Abyssal Ruins, but the aura emanating from the blood lake was identical to that place, which was why Fat Chicken could recognize it at a glance. The blood water in the lake seemed to flow out from the void, as if it had no source.</p><p>At this moment, the seal of the blood lake was in turmoil, with waves of blood rising one after another. The disturbance not only affected the surrounding area but also other parts of the inner valley. Qin Sang carefully observed the seal of the blood lake, feeling that this was only the tip of the iceberg of the entire seal. He secretly ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to activate its divine ability, staring intently at the blood lake, but within his field of vision, there was only an endless expanse of blood water, and nothing else could be seen.</p><p>"After you brought back the news last time, we collected various secrets about the Boundless Valley and the blood lake from everywhere and studied them together. We have a few speculations about the blood lake," Xiang Qing followed up, standing with his hands behind his back as he gazed at the blood lake. "In ancient times, the two blood lakes were likely one. For some reason, they were separated into two places. Since the seal has not completely split them apart, even though they are half a North Star Realm apart, their internal spaces should still be connected. The great divine abilities of ancient cultivators are truly awe-inspiring."</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "So, are you saying that these two forbidden lands come from the same place? One fell to the Sky Scar, forming the Abyssal Ruins, while the other fell here, forming the Boundless Valley?"</p><p>Xiang Qing nodded, "That's highly likely. Last time, you mentioned that you suspected the Abyssal Ruins were used to suppress an ancient demon. Little did we know, the Boundless Valley was also like the Abyssal Ruins in the past, with independent seals scattered throughout. However, they were severely damaged and not as intact as the Abyssal Ruins. That's why the inner valley has become a dangerous forbidden land filled with fragments of seals. Even if there were ancient cultivators suppressed here, they would have died long ago."</p><p>As he spoke, Xiang Qing raised his head and looked toward the endless north. "Don't forget, the Purple Palace and the Sin God Palace are even farther apart, yet they are connected through the Demon Cave. This proves that the Sin God Palace, and even the Abyssal Ruins, are part of the Purple Palace. It seems now that the famous secret realms of the North Star Realm are all related to the Purple Palace. The Purple Palace is different from the ancient cultivator caves in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. It likely did not originally belong to the North Star Realm but was instead cast down here from an unknown place. Back then, a great calamity befell the Purple Palace. Perhaps the master of the Purple Palace encountered an unbeatable enemy, and even the mountain gate was shattered, with countless fragments falling into the world."</p><p>The speculation Xiang Qing mentioned was also the most widely accepted and plausible one. The endless storm surrounding the North Star Realm was evidence that a terrifying battle had occurred in ancient times, causing destruction that could not be quelled for millennia. It was no surprise that the Purple Palace was shattered. The main body of the Purple Palace fell into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, while the Sin God Palace landed in the Sky Scar, spanning the entire North Star Realm. The Boundless Valley might be a slightly larger fragment, while other smaller fragments had their traces erased after the restrictions were broken.</p><p>Qin Sang knew more. Besides the Sin God Palace, there was also the Seven Slaughter Palace, which had a deep connection with the Purple Palace and fell into the distant Canglang Sea.</p><p>Xiang Qing looked up at the sky, his face filled with longing. "Above the nine heavens, or deep within the storm, there must be a vaster world. I wonder if I will have the chance in this lifetime to escape this cage..."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent. He had traveled through the Little Cold Domain, the Canglang Sea, and the Demon Sea. Every cultivator who knew of the storm belt regarded it as a cage, hoping to one day break free.</p><p>After expressing their sentiments, the two returned to the topic of the blood lake. "If that's the case, could there also be an ancient demon suppressed within the blood lake?" Qin Sang stared at the blood lake, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>Xiang Qing hummed in agreement, "We've considered this possibility before. However, any ancient demon that could survive until now would be well aware of the consequences of being released. Even if Old Demon Ye has gone mad, others wouldn't follow him in his madness. Of course, we've still made some preparations..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subtly. In the Seven Slaughter Palace, the release of the ancient demon was purely a coincidence. Only the leaders of the three great merchant alliances and the Green Bamboo Demon Soul were bewitched by the ancient demon, and each had their own ulterior motives. If the Dragon King, the Great Shaman, the Demon Lord, and Spirit Pearl had known in advance how terrifying the ancient demon monarch was, they would never have dared to entertain such thoughts. The demon might be able to bewitch Old Demon Ye alone, but it couldn't possibly control the entire Sin Abyss to do its bidding. Otherwise, why go through so much trouble? Nascent Soul ancestors are all shrewd individuals, not easily deceived.</p><p>"There's another piece of evidence. When the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld appeared, the seal of the blood lake was opened once, and the inside was like a hellish inferno. If there were any ancient demons that had survived until now, they would have escaped at that time," the cultivator surnamed Hong added as he walked over. The righteous and demonic factions of the Little Cold Domain had joined forces to uncover a record from the relics of a Nascent Soul cultivator who had once participated in the struggle for the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld.</p><p>While the three were speaking, the Golden Core cultivators stood obediently on the periphery, not daring to approach. Several hours later, the Netherworld Demon Lord, Qing Jun, and others arrived together. Qin Sang, being the only demon king present, stood outside leisurely, watching their actions. His gaze occasionally swept over Dongyang Bo, a glint of sharpness flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The enemy is in the open, while I am in the dark. In a perilous and unknown place like the blood lake, it would be easier to find an opportunity. If a Nascent Soul ancestor were unlucky and died inside, it would be entirely normal, and no one would be able to find any traces afterward. It must be said, this is the best time for revenge.</p><p>With the Eighteen Demon Banners forming a grand formation, Qin Sang was confident that his strength was not inferior to that of the Netherworld Demon Lord and the others, and he should be able to surpass Dongyang Bo. However, that did not mean he could kill Dongyang Bo. Manipulating demonic flames through the demon banners was difficult to do flawlessly. Dongyang Bo, as the leader of a prestigious sect, possessed countless treasures and no shortage of life-preserving methods. If he were determined to escape, the chances of stopping him were slim. If that happened, Qin Sang would be exposed, moving from the shadows into the light. Once Dongyang Bo became wary, it would be even harder to find an opportunity in the future.</p><p>In Qin Sang's mind, the most suitable time to act would be after the Fire Lotus Seed sprouted and Bai advanced to the Corpse King stage. Qin Sang secretly lamented. The timing of finding the Bone Curse was too late, and it wasn't a complete curse. Unfortunately, it coincided with the critical moment when Bai was comprehending the Bone Curse. If only Old Demon Ye's actions were a bit slower. Otherwise, with Bai's assistance, they could wait for Dongyang Bo to be alone and find the right moment to take him down. Even if they killed Dongyang Bo, with Bai around, their side wouldn't lose too much combat power. Bai's origins were mysterious and not to be underestimated. After breaking through, his strength would far surpass that of an ordinary Corpse King. Bai, who was searching for his lost memories, was very interested in secret realms and would surely be willing to come.</p><p>...</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord and the others set up a spirit formation above the blood lake. The Golden Core cultivators retreated far away, and during this time, a few more arrived. Qin Sang stepped aside and saw Dongyang Bo and the Netherworld Demon Lord each guarding the formation's core, jointly activating the formation and forcefully striking the seal!</p>
